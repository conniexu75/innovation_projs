https://openalex.org/W2758187157,"MiRNAs are regulatory molecules that can be packaged into exosomes and secreted from cells. Here, we show that adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) in obese mice secrete miRNA-containing exosomes (Exos), which cause glucose intolerance and insulin resistance when administered to lean mice. Conversely, ATM Exos obtained from lean mice improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity when administered to obese recipients. miR-155 is one of the miRNAs overexpressed in obese ATM Exos, and earlier studies have shown that PPARγ is a miR-155 target. Our results show that miR-155KO animals are insulin sensitive and glucose tolerant compared to controls. Furthermore, transplantation of WT bone marrow into miR-155KO mice mitigated this phenotype. Taken together, these studies show that ATMs secrete exosomes containing miRNA cargo. These miRNAs can be transferred to insulin target cell types through mechanisms of paracrine or endocrine regulation with robust effects on cellular insulin action, in vivo insulin sensitivity, and overall glucose homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2758396775,"Polymerization and phase separation of proteins containing low-complexity (LC) domains are important factors in gene expression, mRNA processing and trafficking, and localization of translation. We have used solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance methods to characterize the molecular structure of self-assembling fibrils formed by the LC domain of the fused in sarcoma (FUS) RNA-binding protein. From the 214-residue LC domain of FUS (FUS-LC), a segment of only 57 residues forms the fibril core, while other segments remain dynamically disordered. Unlike pathogenic amyloid fibrils, FUS-LC fibrils lack hydrophobic interactions within the core and are not polymorphic at the molecular structural level. Phosphorylation of core-forming residues by DNA-dependent protein kinase blocks binding of soluble FUS-LC to FUS-LC hydrogels and dissolves phase-separated, liquid-like FUS-LC droplets. These studies offer a structural basis for understanding LC domain self-assembly, phase separation, and regulation by post-translational modification."

Combinatorial expression of select members across families shapes a multi-layered molecular scaffold along the cell membrane that may customize synaptic connectivity patterns and input-output signaling properties. This molecular genetic framework of neuronal identity integrates cell phenotypes along multiple axes and provides a foundation for discovering and classifying neuron types. Since the discovery that individual neurons are the basic building blocks of the nervous system (Cajal, 1892Cajal S.R.y. El nuevo concepto de la histologia de los centros nerviousos.Rev. Cienc. Med. 1892; 18: 457-476Google Scholar), the diversity and heterogeneity of nerve cells have remained a challenge in deciphering the organization of neural circuits (Armañanzas and Ascoli, 2015Armañanzas R. Ascoli G.A. Towards the automatic classification of neurons.Trends Neurosci. 2015; 38: 307-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Recent technical advances in anatomical, physiological, and functional studies increasingly reveal multi-modal and multi-dimensional variations of neuronal phenotypes (Huang and Zeng, 2013Huang Z.J. Zeng H. Genetic approaches to neural circuits in the mouse.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 36: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A fundamental question is whether these variations are largely subjective to measurements and only can be managed by operational grouping, or whether multiple distinct and congruent cell features can be integrated to define discrete “cells types” that reflect biological reality and mechanisms. The problem of neuronal diversity is unlikely to be solved without solving the equal, if not more fundamental, problem of neuronal identity that is the flip side of the cell-type coin (Seung and Sümbül, 2014Seung H.S. Sümbül U. Neuronal cell types and connectivity: lessons from the retina.Neuron. 2014; 83: 1262-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, the biological basis of neuronal identity is poorly understood and cell definition and classification schemes in the brain remain contentious (DeFelipe et al., 2013DeFelipe J. López-Cruz P.L. Benavides-Piccione R. Bielza C. Larrañaga P. Anderson S. Burkhalter A. Cauli B. Fairén A. Feldmeyer D. et al.New insights into the classification and nomenclature of cortical GABAergic interneurons.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 14: 202-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). As individual neurons constitute basic units of gene regulation, a major determinant of each neuron’s phenotype and function likely lies in its transcription programs. Recent studies classify neurons using high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) (Tasic et al., 2016Tasic B. Menon V. Nguyen T.N. Kim T.K. Jarsky T. Yao Z. Levi B. Gray L.T. Sorensen S.A. Dolbeare T. et al.Adult mouse cortical cell taxonomy revealed by single cell transcriptomics.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar, Zeisel et al., 2015Zeisel A. Muñoz-Manchado A.B. Codeluppi S. Lönnerberg P. La Manno G. Juréus A. Marques S. Munguba H. He L. Betsholtz C. et al.Brain structure. Cell types in the mouse cortex and hippocampus revealed by single-cell RNA-seq.Science. 2015; 347: 1138-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). A major challenge is to map transcriptome-based statistical clusters, which are prone to technical noise and methodological bias, to the biological ground truth: their anatomical and physiological properties that constrain and contribute to cell function in neural circuits. In the retina, where cell types are among the best understood in the mammalian nervous system, scRNA-seq has identified distinct markers that correlate to known types and suggested novel types (Shekhar et al., 2016Shekhar K. Lapan S.W. Whitney I.E. Tran N.M. Macosko E.Z. Kowalczyk M. Adiconis X. Levin J.Z. Nemesh J. Goldman M. et al.Comprehensive classification of retinal bipolar neurons by single-cell transcriptomics.Cell. 2016; 166: 1308-1323.e1330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). In the cerebral cortex, where cell type definition is often ambiguous and controversial, scRNA-seq analyses have parsed multiple “transcriptional types” (Tasic et al., 2016Tasic B. Menon V. Nguyen T.N. Kim T.K. Jarsky T. Yao Z. Levi B. Gray L.T. Sorensen S.A. Dolbeare T. et al.Adult mouse cortical cell taxonomy revealed by single cell transcriptomics.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar, Zeisel et al., 2015Zeisel A. Muñoz-Manchado A.B. Codeluppi S. Lönnerberg P. La Manno G. Juréus A. Marques S. Munguba H. He L. Betsholtz C. et al.Brain structure. Cell types in the mouse cortex and hippocampus revealed by single-cell RNA-seq.Science. 2015; 347: 1138-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar), but their correlations to bona fide biological types jointly defined by anatomical and physiological features remain unclear. Thus although scRNA-seq allows comprehensive and quantitative measurements of gene expression, a fundamental unresolved issue is how transcription profiles might contribute to the molecular genetic basis of neuron types. Discovering the transcriptional basis of neuronal identity is prerequisite to deciphering neuronal diversity and enumerating cell census. Furthermore, high-resolution transcriptional portraits that mechanistically explain and predict the multi-faceted yet functionally congruent cell phenotypes have yet to be achieved. Here, we have explored the transcriptional architecture underlying the core identity of GABAergic neurons in the cerebral cortex. Unlike recent studies that classify neurons using unsupervised statistical clustering of transcriptomes from unbiased (Zeisel et al., 2015Zeisel A. Muñoz-Manchado A.B. Codeluppi S. Lönnerberg P. La Manno G. Juréus A. Marques S. Munguba H. He L. Betsholtz C. et al.Brain structure. Cell types in the mouse cortex and hippocampus revealed by single-cell RNA-seq.Science. 2015; 347: 1138-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar) or relatively broad populations (Tasic et al., 2016Tasic B. Menon V. Nguyen T.N. Kim T.K. Jarsky T. Yao Z. Levi B. Gray L.T. Sorensen S.A. Dolbeare T. et al.Adult mouse cortical cell taxonomy revealed by single cell transcriptomics.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar), we analyzed single-cell transcriptomes of 6 genetically labeled and phenotypically well-characterized GABAergic types or subpopulations to discover their core molecular features. Using these anatomically and physiologically defined subpopulations as an assay, we designed a computational genomics strategy to screen through the ∼620 HGNC (Human Genome Nomenclature Committee) gene families for those whose differential expression reliably distinguish these subpopulations. Remarkably, approximately 40 gene families implicated in regulating synaptic communication best distinguish these subpopulations. These gene families constitute 6 functional categories that include cell-adhesion molecules, neurotransmitter and modulator receptors, ion channels, regulatory components of membrane-proximal signaling pathways, neuropeptides and vesicular release components, and transcription factors. Combinatorial and coordinated expression of select family members across these categories shapes a molecular scaffold along the cell membrane that appears to customize the pattern and property of synaptic communication for each cell population. We further provide evidence that transcription factor profiles register the developmental history of GABAergic neurons and contribute to concerted gene expression patterns that shape cell phenotypes. These findings suggest that neuronal identity is encoded in a transcriptional architecture that orchestrates functionally congruent expression across multiple gene families to customize the patterns and properties of their input-output communication. Our overall strategy is to compare high-resolution transcription profiles of a set of well-characterized GABAergic neurons defined by their anatomical, physiological, and developmental attributes. We developed combinatorial recombinase driver lines to capture 6 GABAergic subpopulations (He et al., 2016He M. Tucciarone J. Lee S. Nigro M.J. Kim Y. Levine J.M. Kelly S.M. Krugikov I. Wu P.

Lu J. Huang Z.J. The spatial and temporal origin of chandelier cells in mouse neocortex.Science. 2013; 339: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar); (2) the PV-Cre driver labels fast-spiking basket cells (PVBCs) that innervate the perisomatic region (Hu et al., 2014Hu H. Gan J. Jonas P. Interneurons. Fast-spiking, parvalbumin+ GABAergic interneurons: from cellular design to microcircuit function.Science. 2014; 345: 1255263Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar); (3) the SST-Flp;NOS1-CreER drivers target a unique type of long-projecting GABAergic cells (LPCs) (Kilduff et al., 2011Kilduff T.S. Cauli B. Gerashchenko D.

Markram H. Disynaptic inhibition between neocortical pyramidal cells mediated by Martinotti cells.Neuron. 2007; 53: 735-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) and likely another cell type; (5) the VIP-Flp;CR-Cre drivers include interneuron-selective cells (ISC) (Staiger et al., 2004Staiger J.F. Masanneck C. Schleicher A. Zuschratter W. Calbindin-containing interneurons are a target for VIP-immunoreactive synapses in rat primary somatosensory cortex.J. Comp. Neurol. 2004; 468: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and likely other types; and (6) the VIP-Flp;CCK-Cre drivers include CCK basket cells (CCKC) (Armstrong and Soltesz, 2012Armstrong C. Soltesz I. Basket cell dichotomy in microcircuit function.J. Physiol. 2012; 590: 683-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and likely other types. Accumulated anatomical, physiological, and molecular evidence indicate that these are non-overlapping subpopulations, and CHCs, LPCs, and PVBCs are considered cardinal types (He et al., 2016He M. Tucciarone J. Lee S. Nigro M.J. Kim Y. Levine J.M. Kelly S.M. Krugikov I. Wu P. Chen Y. et al.Strategies and tools for combinatorial targeting of GABAergic neurons in mouse cerebral cortex.Neuron. 2016; 91: 1228-1243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We define these 6 populations as phenotype characterized populations, or PCPs. Using manual sorting of single red fluorescent protein (RFP)-labeled cells from microdissected motor and somatosensory cortex of 6-week-old mice (Figure 1C), we obtained a high-resolution transcriptome dataset of ∼584 cells (CHC1 = 80, CHC2 = 52, PVBCs = 127, LPCs = 136, MNCs = 62, ISCs = 63, and CCKCs = 64 cells) from the 6 PCPs (Figure S1D; STAR Methods). Compared with previous methods (Shekhar et al., 2016Shekhar K. Lapan S.W. Whitney I.E. Tran N.M. Macosko E.Z. Kowalczyk M. Adiconis X. Levin J.Z. Nemesh J.

Cell types in the mouse cortex and hippocampus revealed by single-cell RNA-seq.Science. 2015; 347: 1138-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar), our linear amplification with 10-bp unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) achieved more comprehensive and quantitative transcriptome measurements (detecting ∼9,000 genes/cell; Figure S1H; STAR Methods); this facilitated more in-depth analysis of molecular profiles that contribute to the phenotypes and identity of PCPs. Our analysis revealed 190 genes differentially expressed (DE) among PCPs with each gene expressed at >50 uTPM (unique transcript per million), >4-fold enrichment, and with a p value < 5 × 10−4 (Figure 1D; Table S1). We confirmed known markers for medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)- and caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE)-derived interneurons and the 6 PCPs (Figure 1E). We further profiled CHCs from upper (L2/3, CHC1) and deeper (L5/6, CHC2) layers and identified ∼11 genes enriched in CHC2 over CHC1 (Figure 1F; Table S1). We validated PCP-specific expression of ∼10 transcripts by mRNA in situ hybridization (Figures 1G and S2A). We discovered a putative pan-CHC transcript Pthlh: ∼95% of RFP-labeled CHCs were positive for Pthlh (136/143 cells), and their laminar distribution recapitulates CHC pattern in frontal cortex (Figures 1G and S2A). To validate CCK expression in CHCs (Figure 1E), we demonstrated that an intersection of Nkx2.1-Flp and CCK-Cre labeled CHCs at the L1, L2 border (Figure 1H). Cellular properties emerge from operations of macromolecular machineries comprising interacting components, each often implemented as one of multiple variants encoded by a gene family. Thus variations of cell properties often result from differential expression of select gene family members with characteristic biochemical and biophysical properties that confer customized features to cellular machines (Hartwell et al., 1999Hartwell L.H. Hopfield J.J. Leibler S. Murray A.W. From molecular to modular cell biology.Nature. 1999; 402: C47-C52Crossref PubMed Scopus (2777) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that phenotypic differences among PCPs result from systematic differential transcription across multiple gene families. Our experimental design, whereby single-cell transcriptomes derive from 6 PCPs, provided an effective assay to systematically screen for such gene ensembles that distinguish PCPs. The essence of our computational screen, driven by a supervised, machine-learning-based algorithm, MetaNeighbor (Crow et al., 2017Crow M. Paul A. Ballouz S. Huang Z.J. Gillis J. Addressing the looming identity crisis in single cell RNA-seq.bioRxiv. 2017; https://doi.org/10.1101/150524Crossref Google Scholar), is to detect whether a given set of genes shows correlated expression among cells of the same identity (Figure 2A). As our single-cell transcriptomes derive from 6 PCPs, this data structure allowed characterizing the similarity between all cell pairs using co-variation of expression level in many known gene sets and measure whether a given set correctly links cells of known identity. In network formalism, cells are linked as probabilistically related based on the similarity of their transcriptional profiles across a given set of genes (Figure 2A). This network classifies cells based on their proximity: closely linked neighbors are predicted to share an identity (see the STAR Methods). A subset of PCP labels is first applied to cells, giving a subnetwork with known identities that can classify unlabeled cells. We then hold back the PCP identity of some cells and attempt to predict their identities using this subnetwork of known identities. The efficacy of this test, reported as mean area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC), maps to the probability of a correct assignment when making a single binary choice (Figure 2A). Having constructed a computational assay for cell identity, we vary the transcriptomic features (e.g., gene families) used to characterize cells as neighbors. This computation screen thus selects gene ensemble features which jointly distinguish cell identities. We first screened for gene ensembles according to gene ontology (GO) terms, using randomized labels (AUROC∼0.5) as controls. GO terms containing the keyword “synaptic” gave the highest AUROC score (0.91–0.98), suggesting that genes implicated in synaptic connectivity and function are most discriminating for PCPs (Figure 2B; Table S2). To identify more specific gene categories, we screened through all ∼620 gene families annotated in the HGNC database (see the STAR Methods). We identified ∼40 gene families (i.e., 7% of all gene families) with AUROC scores >0.75, generally regarded as a stringent threshold (Figure 2C; Tables S3 and S4). Strikingly, these gene families all fell into only 6 functional categories (Figures 2C and 2D): (1) cell-adhesion molecules, (2) receptors for neurotransmitters and modulators, (3) voltage-gated ion channels, (4) regulatory signaling proteins, (5) neuropeptides and vesicle release machinery, and (6) transcription factors. It is immediately evident from this list that, except for transcription factors (TFs), all gene categories encode proteins that localize along or close to cell and synaptic membrane (Figure 2D) and contribute to a singular aspect of neuronal biology—synaptic communication—which is implemented through synaptic connectivity and input-output signaling properties (Figure 2E). To validate this discovery, we applied MetaNeighbor to two independent scRNA-seq datasets (Tasic et al., 2016Tasic B. Menon V. Nguyen T.N. Kim T.K. Jarsky T. Yao Z. Levi B. Gray L.T. Sorensen S.A. Dolbeare T. et al.Adult mouse cortical cell taxonomy revealed by single cell transcriptomics.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar, Zeisel et al., 2015Zeisel A. Muñoz-Manchado A.B. Codeluppi S. Lönnerberg P. La Manno G. Juréus A. Marques S. Munguba H. He L. Betsholtz C. et al.Brain structure. Cell types in the mouse cortex and hippocampus revealed by single-cell RNA-seq.Science. 2015; 347: 1138-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). Despite differences in experimental design and methods our meta-analysis yielded high replicability on PCP-distinguishing gene families (Figure 2F). Nearly identical gene families also discriminated the 6 PCP-equivalent cell populations in all three datasets, and the AUROC values of these families (Figure 2C) were well correlated in pair wise comparisons even though the scores from the other two datasets were modestly lower (Figure 2F). We then examined gene families that were not predictive of PCP identity. ∼243 families with AUROC <0.6 (Table S5) were mostly implicated in generic cell functions ranging from DNA replication to energy conversion, etc. This analysis also revealed gene families that a priori might be assumed to predict PCP identity but did not. These include (1) a substantial set of cytoplasmic signaling kinases (e.g., the entire mitogen-activated kinase cascade), phosolipases (30 members); (2) most cytoskeleton components (actins, myosin, dyneins, kinesins); and (3) core components of vesicle release machinery (Table S5). These non-predictive gene families contrasted with the top 40 predictive families in two major properties: they are all cytosolic instead of membrane or membrane proximal, and they often make up the generic scaffold of macromolecular complexes or pathways instead of the key regulatory components. Each GABAergic neuron receives inputs from and extends output to diverse pre- and post-synaptic neurons, respectively (Figure 3A). The cell-adhesion molecules (CAMs) that regulate their morphology, connectivity, synaptic transmission and plasticity are largely unknown. Our computational screen identified multiple CAM families that effectively discriminate PCPs (Figures 3B–3E). Based on broadly annotated HGNC families and the literature (de Wit and Ghosh, 2016de Wit J. Ghosh A. Specification of synaptic connectivity by cell surface interactions.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2016; 17: 22-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, Kolodkin and Tessier-Lavigne, 2011Kolodkin A.L. Tessier-Lavigne M.

Protein tyrosine phosphatases PTPδ, PTPσ, and LAR: presynaptic hubs for synapse organization.Trends Neurosci. 2013; 36: 522-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), we selected ∼275 genes encoding all major neuronal CAMs and organized them into 12 adhesion groups according to sequence homology and receptor-ligand relationships (Figure 3B; Table S4). Nearly all major groups of neuronal CAMs implicated in different aspects of neural development are expressed in PCPs, and each PCP expresses ∼200 CAM genes (Figure 3C). This was an underestimate of CAM diversity as our RNA-seq method does not detect splicing variants. Among the ∼275 CAM genes, 130 show highly distinct subpopulation profiles (Figure 3E; Table S6). Strikingly, multiple CAM families each manifest differential expression among PCPs (Figures 3F and S3A–S3D ). For example, UNC5 members and their ligand netrin1 are differentially expressed; UNC5b is highly specific to CHCs (Figures S2B and S3C); these receptor-ligand pairs might mediate cell-cell recognition (Figure S3A).Figure S3Differential Expression of Netrin-unc5 and Carbohydrate-Modifying Enzymes among PCPs, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Approximately 20 immunoglobulin cell adhesion molecule are differentially expressed (also see Figure 3F) and may contribute to the cellular, subcellular and synaptic specificity of PCPs.

Each of the major synaptic adhesion families (e.g., neurexin, neuroligin, protein tyrosine phosphatases, leucine-rich repeat proteins, and Slitrks) is differentially expressed among PCPs (Figures 3D–3F and S3E). Cell-specific expression of LRRs might contribute to post- and trans-synaptic specializations that customize the property of synapse types defined by pre- and post-synaptic neuron identities. Together, cell- and synaptic adhesion families likely constitute a comprehensive mosaic of multi-faceted cell-surface code throughout the neuronal membrane. We further discovered prominent differential expression in two families of carbohydrate modifying enzymes, sulfotransferases (AUROC = 0.88) and sialyltransferases (AUROC = 0.85), that may increase the molecular diversity of glycosylated CAMs and proteoglycans on the cell membrane and in extracellular matrix (Figures 3F and S3D). This suggests that each PCP might produce a characteristic cell coat through distinct carbohydrate modification patterns to diversify proteoglycans that facilitates or prevents cell interaction at a distance. Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) play key roles in excitatory synaptic signaling and plasticity. Glutamatergic synapses in GABAergic interneurons often contain higher proportions of CP-AMPARs (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor) and GluN2B-NMDARs, although the ratio between the two types of AMPARs and NMDARs vary significantly among different cell populations (Akgül and McBain, 2016Akgül G.

We have imaged an axially symmetric flow field around individual particles on a uniform electrode surface. The flow is induced by distortions in the applied electric field owing to inhomogeneities in the 'double layer' of ions and counterions at the electrode surface. The beads themselves can create these inhomogeneities, or alternatively, we can modify the electrode surfaces by lithographic patterning so as to introduce specified patterns into the aggregated structures."
https://openalex.org/W2760207683,"Approximately 30%-40% of global CO2 fixation occurs inside a non-membrane-bound organelle called the pyrenoid, which is found within the chloroplasts of most eukaryotic algae. The pyrenoid matrix is densely packed with the CO2-fixing enzyme Rubisco and is thought to be a crystalline or amorphous solid. Here, we show that the pyrenoid matrix of the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is not crystalline but behaves as a liquid that dissolves and condenses during cell division. Furthermore, we show that new pyrenoids are formed both by fission and de novo assembly. Our modeling predicts the existence of a ""magic number"" effect associated with special, highly stable heterocomplexes that influences phase separation in liquid-like organelles. This view of the pyrenoid matrix as a phase-separated compartment provides a paradigm for understanding its structure, biogenesis, and regulation. More broadly, our findings expand our understanding of the principles that govern the architecture and inheritance of liquid-like organelles."
https://openalex.org/W2760489309,"We assembled genome-wide data from 16 prehistoric Africans. We show that the anciently divergent lineage that comprises the primary ancestry of the southern African San had a wider distribution in the past, contributing approximately two-thirds of the ancestry of Malawi hunter-gatherers ∼8,100-2,500 years ago and approximately one-third of the ancestry of Tanzanian hunter-gatherers ∼1,400 years ago. We document how the spread of farmers from western Africa involved complete replacement of local hunter-gatherers in some regions, and we track the spread of herders by showing that the population of a ∼3,100-year-old pastoralist from Tanzania contributed ancestry to people from northeastern to southern Africa, including a ∼1,200-year-old southern African pastoralist. The deepest diversifications of African lineages were complex, involving either repeated gene flow among geographically disparate groups or a lineage more deeply diverging than that of the San contributing more to some western African populations than to others. We finally leverage ancient genomes to document episodes of natural selection in southern African populations. PAPERCLIP."
https://openalex.org/W2759693465,"It is now established that Bcl11b specifies T cell fate. Here, we show that in developing T cells, the Bcl11b enhancer repositioned from the lamina to the nuclear interior. Our search for factors that relocalized the Bcl11b enhancer identified a non-coding RNA named ThymoD (thymocyte differentiation factor). ThymoD-deficient mice displayed a block at the onset of T cell development and developed lymphoid malignancies. We found that ThymoD transcription promoted demethylation at CTCF bound sites and activated cohesin-dependent looping to reposition the Bcl11b enhancer from the lamina to the nuclear interior and to juxtapose the Bcl11b enhancer and promoter into a single-loop domain. These large-scale changes in nuclear architecture were associated with the deposition of activating epigenetic marks across the loop domain, plausibly facilitating phase separation. These data indicate how, during developmental progression and tumor suppression, non-coding transcription orchestrates chromatin folding and compartmentalization to direct with high precision enhancer-promoter communication."

Phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells (ACs), or efferocytosis, is a critical process in normal physiology that prevents necrosis of dead cells and triggers anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving responses in phagocytes (Vandivier et al., 2006Vandivier R.W.

Mechanisms and consequences of efferocytosis in advanced atherosclerosis.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2009; 86: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Efferocytosis involves recognition of ACs by cell receptors and then phagocytosis and phagolysosomal digestion of the ACs (Hochreiter-Hufford and Ravichandran, 2013Hochreiter-Hufford A. Ravichandran K.S. Clearing the dead: Apoptotic cell sensing, recognition, engulfment, and digestion.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5: a008748Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). While there has been great progress in understanding these processes, much less is known about the mechanisms that enable phagocytes to internalize multiple ACs over relatively short periods of time. In settings where cell death is rampant, the high ratio of ACs to phagocytes demands multiple, rapid AC uptake by individual phagocytes, which raises two key questions: (1) what regulates cellular membrane recycling to allow new phagosome formation after a previous round of phagocytosis (Aderem, 2002Aderem A. How to eat something bigger than your head.Cell. 2002; 110: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); and (2) how do phagocytes process the metabolic cargo of multiple ACs (Han and Ravichandran, 2011Han C.Z. Ravichandran K.S. Metabolic connections during apoptotic cell engulfment.Cell. 2011; 147: 1442-1445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). While investigating these areas, we made the surprising observation that AC uptake by macrophages triggers a mitochondrial fission response that was associated with and dependent on a marked increase in the mitochondrial fission protein dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) (Chan, 2012Chan D.C. Fusion and fission: Interlinked processes critical for mitochondrial health.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2012; 46: 265-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, Ishihara et al., 2009Ishihara N. Nomura M. Jofuku A. Kato H. Suzuki S.O. Masuda K. Otera H. Nakanishi Y. Nonaka I. Goto Y. et al.Mitochondrial fission factor Drp1 is essential for embryonic development and synapse formation in mice.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 958-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Most importantly, when mitochondrial fission was prevented in macrophages exposed to a first round of ACs, subsequent AC uptake was compromised. Moreover, mice with compromised mitochondrial fission in myeloid cells showed evidence of defective efferocytosis and its pathologic consequences in vivo. Mechanistic studies revealed that mitochondrial fission enables efficient AC corpse degradation in phagolysosomes as well as calcium-dependent vesicular trafficking, both of which are required for continued AC phagocytosis. These studies reveal a critical series of intracellular reactions during efferocytosis that facilitate multiple AC uptake and demonstrate the importance of this process in clearance of ACs in vivo. When macrophages are incubated with ACs, some of the macrophages take up the ACs (AC+) and some do not (AC–). We observed that the mitochondria were shorter and more fragmented in AC+ versus AC– macrophages (Figure 1A), which was accompanied by an increase in the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 both in the cytoplasm and mitochondria (Figures 1B and 1C). The source of the increased Drp1 was the phagocyte, not the AC, because the Drp1 increase was similar when phagocytes were exposed to Drp1-deficient ACs versus control ACs, i.e., apoptotic macrophages from Drp1fl/fl Lysmcre+/− (Cre+/−) versus control Cre−/− mice (Ishihara et al., 2009Ishihara N. Nomura M. Jofuku A. Kato H. Suzuki S.O. Masuda K. Otera H. Nakanishi Y. Nonaka I. Goto Y. et al.Mitochondrial fission factor Drp1 is essential for embryonic development and synapse formation in mice.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 958-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar) (Figures S1A and S1B–S1E confirms Drp1 deficiency in Cre+/− macrophages). The increase in Drp1 in macrophages exposed to ACs was not observed at the mRNA level (Figure S2F) and was not blocked by actinomycin D but was inhibited by cycloheximide, indicating post-transcriptional regulation (Figure S1G). To determine whether Drp1 was causally important in AC-induced mitochondrial fission, we treated macrophages with MDIVI-1, a selective inhibitor of Drp1 (Cassidy-Stone et al., 2008Cassidy-Stone A. Chipuk J.E. Ingerman E. Song C. Yoo C. Kuwana T. Kurth M.J. Shaw J.T. Hinshaw J.E. Green D.R. Nunnari J.

In both cases, mitochondrial length was increased and, most importantly, not decreased in response to AC uptake (Figure 1D). Thus, efferocytosis triggers Drp1-induced mitochondrial fission in macrophages exposed to ACs.Figure S1Interaction of Macrophages with Apoptotic Cells Leads to an Increase in Drp1, which Promotes Efferocytosis, Related to Figures 1 and 2Show full caption(A) Cre−/− and Cre+/− bone marrow-derived macrophages were rendered apoptotic by treatment with 35 μM 7-ketocholesterol and then incubated with WT bone marrow-derived macrophages at a ratio of 10:1 for 45 min.

Efferocytosis was measured as the total percent of macrophages positive for PKH67-labeled ACs (n = 4 biological replicates). To explore the functional significance of these findings, we compared the interaction of Cre−/− and Cre+/− macrophages with Calcein AM-labeled ACs. At relatively early time points or low AC:macrophage ratios, AC association with Cre−/− and Cre+/− macrophages appeared similar, but this was decreased in Cre+/− macrophages at longer time points or higher AC:macrophage ratios (Figure 2A). These results were confirmed by flow cytometry using PKH67-labeled macrophages and CypHer5E-labeled ACs, which become fluorescent in acidic phagolysosomes (Figure S1H). Similar defects in efferocytosis were seen in MDIVI-1-treated mouse macrophages (Figure S1I) and in human monocyte-derived macrophages transfected with Drp1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) (Figure 2B). Loss of Drp1 did not affect macrophage differentiation or polarization in response to lipolysaccharide (LPS) + interferon (IFN)-γ or interleukin-4 (IL-4) (Figures S2A–S2C).Figure S2Drp1-Deficient Macrophages Differentiate Normally and Show Expected Patterns of Polarization to Stimuli and Effect of MDIVI-1 on Mitochondrial Length, Related to Figures 1 and 2Show full caption(A) Macrophages differentiated from bone marrow cells of Cre−/− and Cre+/− mice were analyzed by flow cytometry for cell-surface F4/80, CD68, and FcγRI.

For all panels, values are mean + S.E.M.; ∗p < 0.05; n.s., not significant. Based on these data, we hypothesized that mitochondrial fission enabled macrophages to internalize multiple ACs (“high-burden efferocytosis”). To test this hypothesis, we conducted a two-stage efferocytosis experiment in which macrophages were first incubated for 45 min with ACs labeled with PKH67 (green) and then, after AC removal and a 120-min interval, incubated with a second round of ACs labeled with PKH26 (red). Consistent with the hypothesis, the percentage of macrophages that had internalized both labels was significantly less in MDIVI-1-treated or Cre+/− macrophages than in control cells (Figure 2C). As designed, MDIVI-1 increased mitochondrial length in macrophages with two ACs to a level approaching that of macrophages with no ACs (Figure S2D). Note that MDIVI-1 did not further decrease second AC uptake when added to Cre+/− macrophages (Figure S2E), as expected for an on-target effect of the inhibitor. We next asked whether the defect in second AC uptake was due to a decrease in AC binding or AC internalization. For this purpose, the actin polymerization inhibitor cytochalasin D was added after the first round to block second AC internalization, i.e., to assay second AC binding. The data show that second AC binding was similar between Cre−/− and Cre+/− macrophages (Figure 2D), indicating that the decrease in second AC efferocytosis in Drp1-deficient macrophages was due to a defect in AC internalization. To verify that the above data were due to effects on mitochondrial fission rather than some other effect of Drp1, we silenced mitochondrial fission factor (Mff) (Otera et al., 2010Otera H. Wang C. Cleland M.M. Setoguchi K. Yokota S. Youle R.J. Mihara K. Mff is an essential factor for mitochondrial recruitment of Drp1 during mitochondrial fission in mammalian cells.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 1141-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar) and confirmed that it impaired mitochondrial fission in AC+ macrophages (Figure S3A). As with Drp1 depletion, Mff silencing decreased second AC uptake (Figure S3B). Further, silencing the fusion mediator Mfn1 resulted in hyper-fragmented mitochondria and enhanced efferocytosis (Figures S3C–S3E) at a 10:1 AC:macrophage ratio. These combined data indicate that mitochondrial fission per se enables efficient high-burden efferocytosis. Although efferocytosis of a first-encountered AC appeared normal in mitochondrial fission-deficient macrophages, a subtle defect in phagosomal sealing could have escaped detection. To test for this possibility, we incubated wild-type (WT) or Drp1-deficient macrophages with ACs that were both PKH67-labeled and biotinylated. After 15, 30, or 60 min, unbound ACs were removed and the macrophages were fixed. Alexa-Fluor-568-labeled streptavidin (SA-AF568) was then added to the cells, and macrophage AF568 labeling was quantified. This method distinguishes fully internalized from partially engulfed ACs, as fully engulfed ACs are not accessible to SA-AF568. We found that there was a higher fraction of AF568-labeled ACs in Drp1-deficient (Cre+/−) versus Cre−/− control macrophages at 30 and 60 min, indicating a defect in phagosome sealing (Figure 3A). Similar results were found in macrophages in which Mff was silenced (Figure S3F). We reasoned that a defect in phagosome sealing would cause a delay in acidification of AC-containing phagosomes (Lu and Zhou, 2012Lu N. Zhou Z. Membrane trafficking and phagosome maturation during the clearance of apoptotic cells.Int. Rev. Cell Mol. Biol. 2012; 293: 269-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To test this prediction, we incubated Cre−/− and Cre+/− macrophages with CypHer5E-labeled ACs and then recorded the time interval from initial AC-macrophage interaction to CypHer5E-positivity using live-cell fluorescence microscopic imaging. The data show a clear defect in time to CypHer5E-positivity in Cre+/− versus Cre−/− macrophages (Figures 3B and S3G), consistent with a delay in acidification of AC-containing phagosomes. In contrast, there was no defect in lysosomal acidification in Cre+/− macrophages (Figure S3H). These combined data indicate that Drp1-deficient macrophages have a defect in phagosome sealing around newly encountered ACs. To investigate the potential relevance of this finding to other types of phagocytosis, we assayed phagosome sealing in macrophages exposed to 10-μm latex beads, which are similar in size to the apoptotic Jurkat cells used in our assays. Cre+/− macrophages showed a defect in phagosome sealing around these latex beads, similar to the situation with ACs (Figure S3I, graph 1). Phagocytosis processes can differ depending on size of cargo (Kubota et al., 1983Kubota Y. Takahashi S. Matsuoka O. Dependence on particle size in the phagocytosis of latex particles by rabbit alveolar macrophages cultured in vitro.J. Toxicol. Sci. 1983; 8: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We therefore examined phagocytic sealing in macrophages exposed to 4-μm latex beads and similarly sized immunoglobulin G (IgG)-opsonized sheep red blood cells (IgG-sRBCs). As a control for the IgG-sRBCs, we also tested larger sized IgG-coated Jurkat cells. In contrast to what we saw with 10-μm beads, and now shown as well for IgG-coated Jurkat cells (Figure S3I, graph 4), plasma membrane sealing around the smaller beads and sRBCs was similar in Cre−/− and Cre+/− macrophages (Figure S3I, graphs 2 and 3). Thus, the sealing defect in Drp1-deficient macrophages is specific to larger particles. Finally, to determine whether Cre+/− macrophages have defective sealing around a secondarily encountered AC, we used biotinylated second ACs in the two-stage AC assay described in the previous section. SA-AF568 accessibility was greater in the Cre+/− cells, indicating a sealing defect around the second AC in Drp1-deficient macrophages (Figure 3C). In summary, mitochondrial fission is necessary for proper phagosome sealing during efferocytosis. This defect causes a subtle defect in efferocytosis when macrophages interact with a first AC and likely contributes to the more marked defect in efferocytosis when the phagocytes encounter additional ACs, as explained in the following sections. In those Drp1-deficient macrophages that had successfully internalized an AC, we observed that there was less fragmentation of the labeled AC corpse compared with control macrophages, suggesting defective corpse degradation. To quantify corpse degradation, we incubated Cre−/− and Cre+/− macrophages for 45 min with PKH26-labeled ACs. After rinsing away unbound ACs, we then counted the percentage of AC+ macrophages that showed non-fragmented PKH26 staining over the ensuing 3 hr. Confirming our subjective observations, the percentage of macrophages with non-fragmented ACs was greater in Cre+/− versus Cre−/− macrophages (Figure 4A). Moreover, in a time-lapse fluorescence microscopy experiment, we observed that the first time point at which the internalized CypHer5E ACs showed evidence of fragmentation was significantly delayed in Cre+/− versus Cre−/− macrophages (Figure S4A).Figure S4Drp1-Deficient Macrophages Have Defects in AC Corpse Degradation and Phagosomal ROS, Quantification of ATP, and Illustrative Images of GCaMP6f Fluorescence Over Time, Related to Figures 4 and 5Show full caption(A) Time-lapse confocal fluorescence microscopy of Cre−/− and Cre+/− macrophages incubated with apoptotic PMNs labeled with CypHer5E.

These results provide an overview of proteins operating in the eukaryotic algal CCM, a key process that drives global carbon fixation. Over the past three billion years, the carbon-fixing enzyme Rubisco drew down atmospheric concentrations of CO2 to trace levels (Dismukes et al., 2001Dismukes G.C. Klimov V.V. Baranov S.V. Kozlov Y.N. DasGupta J. Tyryshkin A. The origin of atmospheric oxygen on Earth: the innovation of oxygenic photosynthesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 2170-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), in effect starving itself of its substrate. In parallel, the oxygenic reactions of photosynthesis have caused the appearance of abundant O2, which competes with CO2 for the active site of Rubisco and results in a loss of fixed CO2 via photorespiration (Bauwe et al., 2010Bauwe H. Hagemann M. Fernie A.R. Photorespiration: players, partners and origin.Trends Plant Sci. 2010; 15: 330-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). To overcome these challenges of CO2 assimilation in today’s atmosphere, many photosynthetic organisms increase CO2 levels in the vicinity of Rubisco by operating CO2-concentrating mechanisms (CCMs). Such mechanisms increase the CO2:O2 ratio at the active site of Rubisco, enhancing CO2 fixation and decreasing photorespiration. CCMs are found in nearly all marine photoautotrophs, including cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae (Reinfelder, 2011Reinfelder J.R. Carbon concentrating mechanisms in eukaryotic marine phytoplankton.Annu. Rev. Mar. Sci. 2011; 3: 291-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), which together account for ∼50% of global carbon fixation (Field et al., 1998Field C.B. Behrenfeld M.J. Randerson J.T. Falkowski P. Primary production of the biosphere: integrating terrestrial and oceanic components.Science. 1998; 281: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (3800) Google Scholar). In cyanobacterial CCMs, inorganic carbon in the form of bicarbonate (HCO3−) is pumped into the cytosol to a high concentration. This HCO3− is then converted into CO2 in specialized icosahedral compartments called carboxysomes, which are packed with Rubisco (Price and Badger, 1989Price G.D. Badger M.R. Expression of human carbonic anhydrase in the Cyanobacterium Synechococcus PCC7942 creates a high CO2-requiring phenotype: evidence for a central role for carboxysomes in the CO2 concentrating mechanism.Plant Physiol. 1989; 91: 505-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The components of the cyanobacterial CCMs have largely been identified, facilitated in part by the organization of the genes encoding them into operons (Price et al., 2008Price G.D. Badger M.R. Woodger F.J. Long B.M. Advances in understanding the cyanobacterial CO2-concentrating-mechanism (CCM): functional components, Ci transporters, diversity, genetic regulation and prospects for engineering into plants.J. Exp. Bot. 2008; 59: 1441-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Knowledge of these components has enabled the detailed characterization of the structure and assembly pathway of the beta carboxysome (Cameron et al., 2013Cameron J.C. Wilson S.C. Bernstein S.L. Kerfeld C.A. Biogenesis of a bacterial organelle: the carboxysome assembly pathway.Cell. 2013; 155: 1131-1140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Analogous to the cyanobacterial CCM, the eukaryotic green algal CCM concentrates HCO3− in a microcompartment containing tightly-packed Rubisco, called the pyrenoid. The pyrenoid is located in the chloroplast, surrounded by a starch sheath and traversed by membrane tubules that are continuous with the surrounding photosynthetic thylakoid membranes (Engel et al., 2015Engel B.D. Schaffer M. Kuhn Cuellar L. Villa E. Plitzko J.M. Baumeister W. Native architecture of the Chlamydomonas chloroplast revealed by in situ cryo-electron tomography.eLife. 2015; 4: e04889PubMed Google Scholar). Associated with the pyrenoid tubules is a carbonic anhydrase that converts HCO3− to CO2 for fixation by Rubisco (Karlsson et al., 1998Karlsson J. Clarke A.K. Chen Z.Y. Hugghins S.Y. Park Y.I. Husic H.D. Moroney J.V. Samuelsson G. A novel α-type carbonic anhydrase associated with the thylakoid membrane in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is required for growth at ambient CO2.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1208-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The mechanism of delivery of HCO3− to the pyrenoid thylakoids remains unknown. In contrast to the prokaryotic CCM, the protein composition of the eukaryotic algal CCM and the structural organization of the pyrenoid remain largely uncharacterized. In this study, we developed a high-throughput fluorescence protein tagging and affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) pipeline for the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Figure 1A). With this pipeline, we determined the localizations of 135 candidate CCM proteins and the physical interactions of 38 core CCM components. Our microscopy data reveals an unexpected localization for the carbonic anhydrase CAH6, identifies three previously undescribed pyrenoid protein layers and suggests that the pyrenoid shows size selectivity for stromal proteins. The AP-MS data produce a spatially resolved protein-protein interaction map of the CCM and pyrenoid, identifying novel protein complexes including a complex between inorganic carbon transporters LCI1 and HLA3 and suggesting CCM functions for multiple proteins. These results transform our basic knowledge of the eukaryotic CCM and advance the prospects of transferring this system into higher plants to improve crop production (Atkinson et al., 2016Atkinson N. Feike D. Mackinder L.C.M. Meyer M.T. Griffiths H. Jonikas M.C. Smith A.M. McCormick A.J.

Meeting the global food demand of the future by engineering crop photosynthesis and yield potential.Cell. 2015; 161: 56-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). To allow the parallel cloning of hundreds of genes, we designed an expression cassette that enabled high-throughput seamless cloning via Gibson assembly (Gibson et al., 2009Gibson D.G. Young L. Chuang R.Y. Venter J.C. Hutchison 3rd, C.A. Smith H.O. Enzymatic assembly of DNA molecules up to several hundred kilobases.Nat. Methods. 2009; 6: 343-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (5450) Google Scholar). Open reading frames (ORFs) were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA and cloned in frame with a C-terminal Venus YFP and a 3xFLAG epitope, driven by the strong PsaD promoter. These constructs were transformed into wild-type Chlamydomonas, where they inserted into random locations in the genome (Figure 1B). To allow dual tagging of different proteins in the same cell, we developed a second expression vector with an mCherry fluorophore and a hygromycin selection marker (Figure S1A). Potential caveats of our system include loss of the endogenous transcriptional regulation of the protein, including information encoded in the promoter, terminator, and genomic locus. Additionally, the C-terminal protein tag could obscure subcellular targeting signals or disrupt functional domains. Given the notorious difficulties with expressing tagged genes in Chlamydomonas (Fuhrmann et al., 1999Fuhrmann M. Oertel W. Hegemann P.

Karcher D. Bock R. Generation of Chlamydomonas strains that efficiently express nuclear transgenes.Plant J. 2009; 57: 1140-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), we started with the understanding that we would only succeed in a fraction of cases and sought to maximize the total number of proteins localized. We selected target genes from three sources: (1) genes currently thought to be involved in the CCM (see Wang et al., 2015Wang Y. Stessman D.J. Spalding M.H. The CO2 concentrating mechanism and photosynthetic carbon assimilation in limiting CO2: how Chlamydomonas works against the gradient.Plant J. 2015; 82: 429-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar for a review), (2) candidate CCM genes, including those identified from both transcriptomic (Brueggeman et al., 2012Brueggeman A.J.

Meyer M.T. Mettler-Altmann T. Chen V.K. Mitchell M.C. Caspari O. Freeman Rosenzweig E.S. Pallesen L. Reeves G. Itakura A. et al.A repeat protein links Rubisco to form the eukaryotic carbon-concentrating organelle.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113: 5958-5963Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) studies, and (3) organelle markers (Figure 1B; Table S1). We were able to determine the localizations of 146 out of the 624 target genes (23%). We sought to leverage the large scale of this study to uncover factors that may contribute to cloning and tagging success in Chlamydomonas. We successfully cloned 298 of the 624 target genes (48%). Our cloning success rate decreased with gene size (Figure S1B). Intriguingly, cloning success was higher for genes with high expression levels (Figures S1C and S1D) (p = 4 × 10−13, Mann-Whitney U test), suggesting that intrinsic properties of a gene that influence endogenous expression may also affect PCR efficiency. We successfully transformed and acquired protein localization data for 146 of the 298 cloned genes (49%). The two main factors correlated with our ability to obtain localization data were: (1) high endogenous gene expression level (Figures S1E and S1F) (p = 6 × 10−14, Mann-Whitney U test), and (2) absence of upstream in-frame ATGs (Figure S1G) (Cross, 2016Cross F.R. Tying down loose ends in the Chlamydomonas genome: functional significance of abundant upstream open reading frames.G3 (Bethesda). 2016; 6: 435-446Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The failure to obtain localization data for genes with in-frame uATGs is likely due to the absence of the correct translational start site in the cloned construct, resulting in a truncated protein that can be functionally impaired, structurally unstable or lacking essential organelle targeting sequence(s). These data suggest that transcript abundance is predictive for localization success and that future protein expression studies will benefit substantially from improved annotation of Chlamydomonas translation start sites. To aid in the classification of unknown proteins to subcellular regions, we tagged a series of conserved, well-characterized organelle and cellular structure proteins (Table S1). We then employed a decision tree (Figure 2A) to classify visually the localization of 135 additional proteins into 29 distinct subcellular regions, representing nearly all of the known organelles and cellular structures of Chlamydomonas (Figure 2B). The protein localizations from our study are available at https://sites.google.com/site/chlamyspatialinteractome/. Interestingly, 12 proteins were not confined to one organelle but were seen in multiple compartments (Figure 2C; Table S2). If these multiple localizations are not artifacts of our expression system, they may represent proteins that function in multiple compartments or are involved in inter-organelle signaling. Additionally, we observed diverse cytosolic localizations, with subtle differences between localization patterns (Figure S2A). To evaluate the accuracy of our method, we compared our results with published localizations of individual proteins. Our data shared 25 proteins with the validated “training” set of chloroplast, mitochondria, and secretory pathway proteins from Tardif et al., 2012Tardif M. Atteia A. Specht M. Cogne G. Rolland N. Brugière S. Hippler M. Ferro M. Bruley C. Peltier G. et al.PredAlgo: a new subcellular localization prediction tool dedicated to green algae.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2012; 29: 3625-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar. Nearly all (24/25) matched our localization data, with the only exception being ACP2 (Cre13.g577100). Whereas we saw ACP2 in the chloroplast (Figure 2D), Tardif et al., 2012Tardif M. Atteia A. Specht M. Cogne G. Rolland N. Brugière S. Hippler M. Ferro M. Bruley C. Peltier G. et al.PredAlgo: a new subcellular localization prediction tool dedicated to green algae.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2012; 29: 3625-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar saw ACP2 in isolated mitochondria. However, previous studies have either failed to detect ACP2 in mitochondria (Atteia et al., 2009Atteia A. Adrait A. Brugière S. Tardif M. van Lis R. Deusch O. Dagan T. Kuhn L. Gontero B. Martin W. et al.A proteomic survey of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mitochondria sheds new light on the metabolic plasticity of the organelle and on the nature of the α-proteobacterial mitochondrial ancestor.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2009; 26: 1533-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) or saw it in approximately equal abundances in isolated chloroplasts and mitochondria (Terashima et al., 2010Terashima M. Specht M. Naumann B. Hippler M. Characterizing the anaerobic response of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by quantitative proteomics.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2010; 9: 1514-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The ambiguity in the previously published data leaves open the possibility that our ACP2 localization data may in fact be correct. We further compared our data with previously published localizations of CCM components and found that 15 of 16 localizations matched. The strong overlap with previously known localizations indicates that our dataset is of high quality (>95% accurate) and that C-terminal tagging of Chlamydomonas proteins results in minimal localization artifacts. Carbonic anhydrases, which catalyze the reversible reaction of HCO3− to CO2, play a critical role in CCMs (Badger, 2003Badger M. The roles of carbonic anhydrases in photosynthetic CO2 concentrating mechanisms.Photosynth. Res. 2003; 77: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Our successful localization of nine Chlamydomonas carbonic anhydrases shows that they are found in a diverse range of cellular locations (Figure S2B). In all current models of the CCM (Moroney et al., 2011Moroney J.V. Ma Y. Frey W.D. Fusilier K.A. Pham T.T. Simms T.A. DiMario R.J. Yang J. Mukherjee B.

The CO2 concentrating mechanism and photosynthetic carbon assimilation in limiting CO2: how Chlamydomonas works against the gradient.Plant J. 2015; 82: 429-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), the carbonic anhydrase CAH6 is in the chloroplast stroma, where it has been proposed to convert CO2 to HCO3−. Surprisingly, in our study, CAH6 localized to the flagella in two independent transformation lines (Figures 2D and S2B) and produced no detectable signal in the chloroplast. To exclude the possibility that our observation is due to an artifact (e.g., due to the C-terminal Venus tag), we analyzed the localization of CAH6 in existing proteomic datasets. CAH6 is present in the flagellar proteome (Pazour et al., 2005Pazour G.J. Agrin N. Leszyk J. Witman G.B. Proteomic analysis of a eukaryotic cilium.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar) and has been shown to be an abundant intraflagellar transport (IFT) cargo (Engel et al., 2012Engel B.D. Ishikawa H. Wemmer K.A. Geimer S. Wakabayashi K. Hirono M. Craige B. Pazour G.J. Witman G.B. Kamiya R. Marshall W.F. The role of retrograde intraflagellar transport in flagellar assembly, maintenance, and function.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 199: 151-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), providing independent validation of CAH6 localization to the flagella. Additionally, CAH6 is absent from both the chloroplast proteome (Terashima et al., 2010Terashima M. Specht M. Naumann B. Hippler M. Characterizing the anaerobic response of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by quantitative proteomics.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2010; 9: 1514-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and the mitochondrial proteome (Atteia et al., 2009Atteia A. Adrait A. Brugière S. Tardif M. van Lis R. Deusch O. Dagan T. Kuhn L. Gontero B. Martin W. et al.A proteomic survey of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mitochondria sheds new light on the metabolic plasticity of the organelle and on the nature of the α-proteobacterial mitochondrial ancestor.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2009; 26: 1533-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), further suggesting that levels in the chloroplast are low or non-existent. Previous evidence for CAH6 in the stroma came from immunogold labeling experiments, in which Mitra et al., 2004Mitra M. Lato S.M. Ynalvez R.A. Xiao Y. Moroney J.V. Identification of a new chloroplast carbonic anhydrase in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar found a 4.7-fold enrichment of gold particles associated with chloroplast starch relative to control pre-immune serum. This could be an artifact due to cross-reactivity of the immunized serum with another epitope. Alternatively, CAH6 may be an abundant flagellar protein, but present at very low levels in the chloroplast. The apparent absence of carbonic anhydrase in the stroma may be a requirement of the Chlamydomonas CCM. A stromal carbonic anhydrase could risk short-circuiting the CCM by promoting the release of CO2 from HCO3− in areas that are not in close proximity to Rubisco. In fact, it has been shown that the expression of carbonic anhydrase in the cyanobacterial cytosol, the likely functional equivalent of the chloroplast stroma, results in the disruption of the cyanobacterial CCM (Price and Badger, 1989Price G.D. Badger M.R. Expression of human carbonic anhydrase in the Cyanobacterium Synechococcus PCC7942 creates a high CO2-requiring phenotype: evidence for a central role for carboxysomes in the CO2 concentrating mechanism.Plant Physiol. 1989; 91: 505-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Instead of directly participating in the CCM, CAH6 could be involved in inorganic carbon sensing. Chlamydomonas was recently shown to chemotax toward HCO3− (Choi et al., 2016Choi H.I. Kim J.Y.H. Kwak H.S. Sung Y.J. Sim S.J. Quantitative analysis of the chemotaxis of a green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, to bicarbonate using diffusion-based microfluidic device.Biomicrofluidics. 2016; 10: 014121Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and carbonic anhydrases have been previously implicated in inorganic carbon sensing (Hu et al., 2010Hu H. Boisson-Dernier A. Israelsson-Nordström M. Böhmer M. Xue S. Ries A. Godoski J. Kuhn J.M. Schroeder J.I. Carbonic anhydrases are upstream regulators of CO2-controlled stomatal movements in guard cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12 (1–18): 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Localization of sensing machinery to the flagella, which are found at the leading edge of swimming cells, could facilitate chemotaxis. The excellent agreement of our localization data with previous studies provided an opportunity to test the accuracy of the two main localization prediction algorithms used for Chlamydomonas proteins, PredAlgo (Tardif et al., 2012Tardif M. Atteia A. Specht M. Cogne G. Rolland N. Brugière S. Hippler M. Ferro M. Bruley C. Peltier G. et al.PredAlgo: a new subcellular localization prediction tool dedicated to green algae.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2012; 29: 3625-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and TargetP (Emanuelsson et al., 2000Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Predicting subcellular localization of proteins based on their N-terminal amino acid sequence.J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3608) Google Scholar). For proteins that we observed in the chloroplast, PredAlgo predicted a chloroplast localization for 90% of them, whereas TargetP only predicted a chloroplast localization for 31% (Figure 2E). For mitochondrial proteins, the accuracy dropped to 31% for PredAlgo and 15% for TargetP. For secretory pathway proteins, the accuracy was 38% for PredAlgo and 24% for TargetP. These results highlight that PredAlgo is the best localization predictor for Chlamydomonas proteins, but its accuracy drops off significantly when proteins localize to compartments other than the chloroplast. Approximately 56% (82/146) of our proteins localized to the chloroplast. We assigned these 82 proteins to 13 sub-chloroplast locations (Figures 2A and 3A ; Table S1). Chloroplast envelope proteins showed three subcategories of localization: (1) envelope homogeneous (signal observed evenly throughout the chloroplast envelope), (2) envelope non-homogeneous, and (3) envelope plus chloroplast homogeneous (signal observed throughout the chloroplast in addition to the envelope). LCIA (low CO2 Inducible A) and LCI20 both showed some homogeneous chloroplast signal in addition to a clear envelope signal, suggesting the possibility that these proteins are functional in both the chloroplast envelope and thylakoid membranes. Three proteins produced similar patterns of punctate dots throughout the chloroplast (Figure S3A): a protein with predicted 50S ribosome-binding GTPase activity (Cre12.g524950), histone-like protein 1 (HLP1; Cre06.g285400) (Karcher et al., 2009Karcher D. Köster D. Schadach A. Klevesath A. Bock R. The Chlamydomonas chloroplast HLP protein is required for nucleoid organization and genome maintenance.Mol. Plant. 2009; 2: 1223-1232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and the fatty acid biosynthesis enzyme acetyl-CoA biotin carboxyl carrier (BCC2; Cre01.g037850). The similarity of the localization patterns of these proteins suggests that chloroplast translation, chloroplast DNA, and fatty acid synthesis may be co-localized in the chloroplast. We found that proteins with specific patterns of localization were often enriched in certain physical properties. As expected, all eight chloroplast envelope proteins contained one or more transmembrane domains (Table S1). Interestingly, proteins showing homogeneous chloroplast localization (Figure 3B) were enriched in transmembrane domains, found in 9/14 homogeneous proteins versus 4/39 for chloroplast non-homogeneous proteins (p = 0.0002, Fisher’s exact test). This observation suggests that proteins with homogeneous localization are most likely thylakoid membrane-associated. Because the pyrenoid is a non-membrane-bound organelle, its protein composition cannot be regulated by a membrane translocation step. We therefore sought to understand whether pyrenoid proteins are enriched for any specific physicochemical properties. We classified chloroplast localized proteins into two groups: (1) pyrenoid-depleted, where the signal from the pyrenoid was weaker than the surrounding chloroplast, and (2) not pyrenoid-depleted, where the signal from the pyrenoid was comparable to or brighter than the surrounding chloroplast. Interestingly, the two groups showed different protein molecular weight distributions (p = 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test). The 39 proteins that are not pyrenoid-depleted are almost all smaller than ∼50 kDa (Figure 3C; the value of ∼50 kDa excludes the Venus YFP region, therefore the effective molecular weight is ∼78 kDa), suggesting that the pyrenoid may exclude larger proteins. Electron microscopy-based techniques have shown that the Chlamydomonas pyrenoid contains a dense matrix of Rubisco surrounded by a starch sheath and traversed by membrane tubules formed from merged thylakoids (Figure 4A) (Engel et al., 2015Engel B.D. Schaffer M. Kuhn Cuellar L. Villa E. Plitzko J.M. Baumeister W. Native architecture of the Chlamydomonas chloroplast revealed by in situ cryo-electron tomography.eLife. 2015; 4: e04889PubMed Google Scholar). Currently, seven proteins have been unambiguously localized to three different regions of the pyrenoid: the pyrenoid matrix, periphery, and tubules. The pyrenoid matrix contains the Rubisco holoenzyme (RBCS/RbcL), its chaperone Rubisco activase (RCA1), essential pyrenoid component 1 (EPYC1), a Rubisco linker protein important for Rubisco packaging in the pyrenoid (Mackinder et al., 2016Mackinder L.C.M.

Cousins A.B. Sze S.K. Mueller-Cajar O. Gao Y.-G. Structural insights into the LCIB protein family reveals a new group of β-carbonic anhydrases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Recently, a Ca2+-binding protein, CAS, has been shown to specifically localize to the pyrenoid tubules at low CO2 (Wang et al., 2016Wang L. Yamano T. Takane S. Niikawa Y. Toyokawa C. Ozawa S.I. Tokutsu R. Takahashi Y. Minagawa J. Kanesaki Y. et al.Chloroplast-mediated regulation of CO2-concentrating mechanism by Ca2+-binding protein CAS in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Proc.

Here, we identify seven additional pyrenoid-localized components and three previously undescribed sub-pyrenoid localization patterns (Figures 4B–4D). Our data suggest that the pyrenoid is surrounded by at least four distinct outer protein layers: (1) LCIB and LCIC localize to puncta around the periphery, (2) PSBP4 (photosystem II subunit P4) localizes to a different set of puncta, (3) STA2 (starch synthase 2) and SBE3 (starch branching enzyme 3) localize to plate-like structures, and (4) LCI9 localizes to a mesh-like structure (Figures 4C–4E).

Astrocytes functionally interact with neurons, but their role in the amygdala remains largely unknown. We show that astrocytes in the medial subdivision of the central amygdala (CeM) determine the synaptic and behavioral outputs of amygdala circuits. To investigate the role of astrocytes in amygdala-related behavior and identify the underlying synaptic mechanisms, we used exogenous or endogenous signaling to selectively activate CeM astrocytes. Astrocytes depressed excitatory synapses from basolateral amygdala via A1 adenosine receptor activation and enhanced inhibitory synapses from the lateral subdivision of the central amygdala via A2A receptor activation. Furthermore, astrocytic activation decreased the firing rate of CeM neurons and reduced fear expression in a fear-conditioning paradigm. Therefore, we conclude that astrocyte activity determines fear responses by selectively regulating specific synapses, which indicates that animal behavior results from the coordinated activity of neurons and astrocytes."

Our results uncover a coordinated EC-IEL response to enteric infections that modulates lymphocyte energy utilization and dynamics and supports maintenance of the intestinal epithelial barrier. In order to function properly, the immune system depends on the capacity of its cells to surveil compartments of the body and respond to particular environmental cues. Intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) comprise one of the most abundant T cell populations and potentially provide a first line of immune defense against pathogens via their location at the critical interface between the intestinal lumen and the core of the body (Jabri and Abadie, 2015Jabri B. Abadie V. IL-15 functions as a danger signal to regulate tissue-resident T cells and tissue destruction.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 15: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). IELs constitute a heterogeneous group of “activated yet resting” T lymphocytes characterized by high expression levels of activation markers, gut-homing integrins, NK-like receptors, cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-related genes, and anti-inflammatory or inhibitory receptors (Cheroutre et al., 2011Cheroutre H. Lambolez F. Mucida D. The light and dark sides of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 11: 445-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The main populations of “natural” IELs are TCRγδ+CD8αα+ and TCRαβ+CD8αα+ cells. Additionally, peripheral, mature TCRαβ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells can acquire IEL markers upon migration to the intestine (“peripheral” IELs) (Cheroutre et al., 2011Cheroutre H. Lambolez F. Mucida D. The light and dark sides of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 11: 445-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Irrespective of subtype, tightly regulated control of IEL function is crucial for the maintenance of the epithelial cell barrier and gut physiological inflammation (Tang et al., 2009Tang F. Chen Z.

Med. 2009; 206: 707-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Inappropriate activation of the CTL capacity of IELs can induce chronic inflammatory disorders such as celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (Meresse et al., 2006Meresse B. Curran S.A.

Although marker-based studies underscore several features related to the phenotype, development, and migration of IELs (Meresse et al., 2004Meresse B. Chen Z. Ciszewski C. Tretiakova M. Bhagat G.

To investigate how IELs respond to enteric microbes, we established intravital and 3D deep-tissue imaging tools in mouse models of infection or microbiota manipulation. We found that γδ IELs are predominantly located in the middle and upper regions of intestinal villi, are highly motile, and display a structured migration pattern, suggesting an epithelial surveillance program. Pathogenic bacterial or protozoan infections induced a dynamic response by γδ IELs, rapidly changing their motility and pattern of movement between intestinal epithelial cells (ECs). This swift γδ IEL response was associated with enhanced antimicrobial gene expression and a metabolic switch toward glycolysis even in the absence of active proliferation. Pharmacological and genetic manipulation of energy utilization pathways recapitulated infection-induced changes and resulted in altered susceptibility to early pathogen invasion. Using inducible, EC-specific Myd88 conditional knockout mice, we demonstrated that the γδ IEL metabolic switch, movement behavior, and immune response required pathogen sensing by surrounding ECs. Our results uncover a coordinated EC-IEL response to luminal microbes that modulates lymphocyte energy utilization and cell dynamics within the epithelium, thus supporting the maintenance of epithelial barrier defense. The gut epithelial compartment represents a spectrum of increasingly differentiated intestinal ECs, from crypt to villus tip, which corresponds to increasing levels of microbe exposure (Ismail et al., 2011Ismail A.S. Severson K.M. Vaishnava S. Behrendt C.L. Yu X. Benjamin J.L. Ruhn K.A. Hou B. DeFranco A.L. Yarovinsky F. Hooper L.V. Gammadelta intraepithelial lymphocytes are essential mediators of host-microbial homeostasis at the intestinal mucosal surface.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 8743-8748Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Likewise, microbial content and diversity increase from proximal (duodenum) to distal (ileum) small intestine and large intestine. Additionally, the number and distribution of IEL subpopulations also significantly change along the intestine. While germ-free (GF) mice show drastic reductions in peripheral IEL numbers and frequency along the intestine when compared to their conventionally housed, specific pathogen-free (SPF) counterparts (Bandeira et al., 1990Bandeira A. Mota-Santos T. Itohara S. Degermann S. Heusser C. Tonegawa S. Coutinho A. Localization of gamma/delta T cells to the intestinal epithelium is independent of normal microbial colonization.J. Exp.

Tissue adaptation of regulatory and intraepithelial CD4+ T cells controls gut inflammation.Science. 2016; 352: 1581-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), overall numbers of natural IELs, particularly γδ IELs, remain mostly intact (Figure S1A). To define γδ IEL localization within the intact epithelial compartment, we performed tissue clearing using iDISCO (stronger fixation, leading to loss of endogenous fluorescence) or FocusClear (milder fixation protocol by which endogenous fluorescence is maintained) and subsequent 3D deep-tissue imaging of intact small intestine segments from TCRγδGFP reporter mice using light-sheet, confocal, and multiphoton microscopy (Gabanyi et al., 2016Gabanyi I. Muller P.A. Feighery L. Oliveira T.Y. Costa-Pinto F.A. Mucida D. Neuro-immune Interactions Drive Tissue Programming in Intestinal Macrophages.Cell. 2016; 164: 378-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Resulting images and automated quantification revealed that the majority of γδ IELs accumulate in the middle of the villus, with fewer cells in the tip or bottom of the villus, including the crypts (Figures 1A and 1B ; Figures S1B and S1C; Movies S1A and S1B). Both iDISCO and FocusClear identified similar IEL localization in the tissue, and this localization was also seen by conventional immunofluorescence analysis (Figure S1D). To address how luminal microbes influence γδ IEL localization, we rederived TCRγδGFP reporter mice into GF conditions. A significant shift toward the crypts was observed for γδ IELs in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum of GF animals. We did not observe γδ IEL accumulation in one region of the villus (Figures 1A and 1B; Figures S1B and S1C), in contrast to SPF mice. Conventionalization of GF TCRγδGFP mice with microbiota from SPF TCRγδGFP mice rescued IEL positioning in the ileum, while broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment of SPF TCRγδGFP mice mirrored GF IEL positioning (Figure 1B; Figure S1E). A microbe-dependent IEL repositioning in the tissue was also observed in GF mice monoassociated with segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), a commensal bacterium that primarily associates with ileal ECs (Sano et al., 2015Sano T. Huang W. Hall J.A. Yang Y. Chen A. Gavzy S.J. Lee J.Y. Ziel J.W. Miraldi E.R.

To a lesser extent (not significant), IEL repositioning was also observed in the ileum of GF mice biassociated with Bacteroides vulgatus and Enterococcus faecalis—commensal bacterial species that primarily colonize distal small intestine and large intestine—or in GF and antibiotics (ABX)-treated SPF mice exposed to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in their drinking water (Figure 1C; Figures S1E–S1G). These results suggest that a microbiota-sensing mechanism operates in the intestine to determine γδ IEL intratissue distribution.Figure 1Steady-State Behavior of Intestinal IELsShow full caption(A) Representative image of cleared (FocusClear) duodenum villi of SPF and GF TCRγδGFP mice (see Movies S1A and S1B).

See also Figure S1. We next used deep (± 80 μm) multiphoton intravital microscopy (IVM) to gain insight into the cell dynamics associated with γδ IEL distribution. Previous reports using time-lapse live imaging of superficial 15 μm villus sections revealed that γδ IELs are highly dynamic and able to respond to directly applied pathogenic bacteria (Edelblum et al., 2012Edelblum K.L.

Our live 4D imaging and supervised quantification showed that under homeostatic conditions, γδ IELs migrate almost exclusively in the space between the epithelial layer and the basement membrane, rapidly covering the entirety of the villous epithelium (Movie S2A). Both 3D and live 4D analyses failed to detect a substantial presence of γδ IELs in the center axis of the villus or lamina propria compartment, contrasting previous analyses that utilized 15 μm tissue sections (Edelblum et al., 2012Edelblum K.L.

We found that in naive SPF mice, a single γδ IEL covered about 950 μm2 of unique basolateral epithelial surface area (or ∼2.2% of a villus) per hr. In contrast, each γδ IEL from GF or SPF mice treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics covered only roughly 650 μm2 of unique area (or 1.5% of the villus epithelium) per hr (Movies S2B and S2C; Figures 1D–1F), despite the overall maintenance of a cell speed of ∼6 μm/min (Figure S1H). Furthermore, at one week postconventionalization of GF mice, we observed a partial recovery of γδ IEL area coverage (Movie S2D; Figure 1F). Similar to their tissue distribution, IEL dynamics required specific microbial cues. SFB monoassociated, but neither B.v. + E.f. biassociated, LPS-treated GF mice, nor LPS-exposed ABX-pretreated SPF mice, showed recovery of IEL area coverage, suggesting that attachment to ECs may be a determinant (Figure 1F; Figure S1I). Because our cleared tissue analyses indicated that γδ IEL positioning within the villi is influenced by the microbiota, we also quantified their vertical displacement using IVM. IELs occupying the tips of villi or the regions closer to the crypt showed a strong vertical migration pattern (Figures 1G and 1H). Nevertheless, the γδ IEL downward displacement exceeded the upward displacement, with net displacement for γδ IELs around 4–6 μm/hr toward the crypts. GF mice showed a significantly altered γδ IEL vertical displacement and reduced total net displacement to roughly 0.5 μm/hr (Figures 1G and 1H). Conventionalization of GF mice with total SPF microbiota or with SFB rescued γδ IEL vertical displacement, while 4 week treatment of SPF mice with broad-spectrum antibiotics mirrored GF γδ IEL dynamics (Figures 1G and 1H; Figure S1J). These results suggest that population migration dynamics of non-renewing γδ IELs may represent an active mechanism for their retention in the rapidly renewing epithelial layer that is modulated by microbe exposure. Together, the above data indicate that the motility of γδ IELs along the epithelial layer is directed by commensal bacteria, resulting in an organized surveillance behavior able to cover the entire epithelial surface within hours. The observation of a microbiota-dependent IEL epithelial motility pattern in the steady state led us to speculate about a possible role for this behavior in responses to enteric infections, previously suggested by studies using TCRγδ-deficient mice (Ismail et al., 2011Ismail A.S.

We first analyzed γδ IEL behavior after oral infection with either wild-type (WT) Salmonella enterica Typhimurium or a mutant invA strain with reduced pathogenicity due to its impaired invasion capacity. While γδ T cells in both naive and infected mice maintained their presence almost exclusively in the epithelial compartment, the motility pattern of these cells changed sharply upon infection. As early as 2 hr post-infection with Salmonella, γδ IELs covered a reduced area, and their movement became serpentine with significantly increased movement between ECs and into the lateral intercellular spaces, a behavior we denominated “flossing.” This flossing movement doubled upon infection despite the overall maintenance of a cell speed of ∼6 μm/min (Figures 2A–2D; Figure S2A; Movie S3A). This pattern persisted for at least 18 hr in mice infected with WT Salmonella but was significantly reduced in mice infected with the invA mutant, suggesting that invasion or persistence of the pathogen is required to sustain this behavior (Figures 2A–2D; Movie S3B). While flossing occurred sporadically and at a lower frequency (around 35 flosses per 100 cells) in naive mice, regions with a high frequency of flossing (“hotspots”) were observed in Salmonella-infected animals, particularly at lower regions of the villi (Figure 2E; Figure S2B). To address whether these flossing hotspots correlated with areas with high-pathogen burden, we infected TCRγδGFP mice with SalmonellamCherry and performed IVM. We observed flossing hotspots near Salmonella-rich areas, although both hotspots and Salmonella appeared evenly distributed (Figure 2F; Movie S3C). While SalmonellamCherry were found only in the ileum (toward the crypt region) at this time point, Salmonella infection triggered general changes in IEL distribution, including in the proximal small intestine (Figure 2G; Figures S2C and S2D). γδ IELs from WT Salmonella-infected mice showed reduced vertical displacement with an increased shift of γδ IEL distribution toward the bottom parts of villi (Figure 2H; Figures S2C and S2D). These analyses indicate that Salmonella infection swiftly induces a set of motility changes in γδ IELs that is distinct from the one observed in response to commensal microbes.Figure S2Influence of Enteric Infections on IEL Behavior, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Quantification (means and SEM) of unique area covered/IEL/hr (measured with IVM) after infection with Salmonella and Toxoplasma at indicated time points. ∗∗∗ = p < 0.001 with ANOVA and post hoc Bonferroni multiple comparison test.(B) Unbiased computational quantification of flossing movements after infection with Salmonella or Toxoplasma at indicated time points and visualized by IVM (see Movies S3A–S3C).

However, their organizational principle remains unclear. By using a retrograde labeling system, we defined the requirement of CSNs in the execution of a skilled forelimb food-pellet retrieval task in mice. In vivo imaging of CSN activity during performance revealed the sequential activation of topographically ordered functional ensembles with moderate local mixing. Region-specific manipulations indicate that CSNs from caudal or rostral forelimb area control reaching or grasping, respectively, and both are required in the transitional pronation step. These region-specific CSNs terminate in different spinal levels and locations, therefore preferentially connecting with the premotor neurons of muscles engaged in different steps of the task. Together, our findings suggest that spatially defined groups of CSNs encode different movement modules, providing a logic for parallel-ordered corticospinal circuits to orchestrate multistep motor skills."

Here, we show that, in mouse mammary gland, kidney, and human prostate, these features can be explained quantitatively within a single unifying framework of branching and annihilating random walks.

Branching morphogenesis has fascinated biologists and mathematicians for centuries, both because of its complexity and ubiquity (Hogan, 1999Hogan B.L.

In higher organisms, many organs are organized into ductal tree-like structures comprising tens of thousands of branches, which typically function to maximize the surface of exchange between the epithelium and its lumen. Examples include lung, kidney, prostate, liver, pancreas, the circulatory system and the mammary gland epithelium. Alongside metazoa, tree crowns and root systems as well as coral reefs often display a similar branched organization (Harrison, 2010Harrison L.G. The Shaping of Life: the Generation of Biological Pattern. Cambridge University Press, 2010Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) raising the question of whether common mechanisms could underlie their formation. Extensive investigations have identified features shared by all branched organs, which are formed by repeated cycles of branching (either through side-branching or tip-splitting), together with phases of ductal elongation (Iber and Menshykau, 2013Iber D. Menshykau D. The control of branching morphogenesis.Open Biol. 2013; 3: 130088Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Attempts to resolve the regulatory basis of branching morphogenesis have been targeted at different length scales, offering contrasting perspectives. First, at the molecular scale, key regulatory signaling pathways, for instance controlling proliferation and cell fate, have been resolved in multiple organs (Iber and Menshykau, 2013Iber D. Menshykau D. The control of branching morphogenesis.Open Biol. 2013; 3: 130088Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Second, at the cellular and mesoscopic scale, measurements of gene expression patterns and branching shape have implicated Turing-like mechanisms in the regulation of the first rounds of repetitive branching in the lung and kidney (Iber and Menshykau, 2013Iber D.

Yet, even a perfect understanding of how single branching events occur would not explain how thousands of tips and branches become coordinated at the organ scale, to specify a complex ductal network. Therefore, here, we adopt an alternative “non-reductionist” approach and test whether the statistical properties of branched networks can be predicted without extensively addressing the detailed underlying molecular and cellular regulatory processes. Historically, the development of such statistical approaches has been limited by the lack of high resolution biological data on the complete organ structure. However, this problem is becoming alleviated by advances in imaging techniques (Metzger et al., 2008Metzger R.J. Klein O.D. Martin G.R.

Cell. 2014; 29: 188-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), which provide an ideal platform to question how a complex 3D organ structure is encoded. Does it form from the unfolding of an intrinsic deterministic program or is it shaped by extrinsic influences and stochastic processes? In the following, we use detailed whole-organ imaging and 3D reconstructions of the mouse mammary gland epithelium, mouse kidney, and human prostate to address the spatiotemporal dynamics of branching morphogenesis. We show that the detailed statistical properties of these organs share key underlying features, which can be explained quantitatively through a remarkably simple and conserved design principle, based on the theory of branching and annihilating random walks (BARWs). In this model, growing ductal tips follow the same, time-invariant, statistical rules based on stochastic ductal branching and random exploration of space. However, when an active tip comes into proximity with a neighboring duct, it becomes irreversibly inactive (differentiating and exiting cell cycle), leading to the termination of the duct. We show that, together, these simple local rules are enough to allow the epithelium to grow in a self-organized manner, into a complex ductal network with conserved statistical properties that are quantitatively predicted by the model. Notably, these isotropic rules predict the emergence of directional bias in the expansion of the ductal network, in the absence of any external guiding signaling gradients. Finally, to further challenge the model, we predict, and discover experimentally, novel signatures of the inferred dynamics, which are consistent with an out-of-equilibrium “phase transition.” Moreover, by adjusting experimentally the microenvironment of the branching tips through local or systemic perturbations, we further test the predictive capacity of the model and gain insight into the molecular regulatory basis of the inferred collective cell dynamics. To develop a model of tip-driven ductal morphogenesis, we began by considering the mammary gland epithelium. At birth, the mouse mammary gland is specified as a small rudimentary tree-like structure (Figure S1A). During puberty, precursors localized at ductal tips (termed terminal end-buds) drive the expansion of a complex network through multiple rounds of tip bifurcation and ductal elongation (Sternlicht, 2006Sternlicht M.D. Key stages in mammary gland development: the cues that regulate ductal branching morphogenesis.Breast Cancer Res. 2006; 8: 201Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) (Figure S1A). These networks are characterized by the structural heterogeneity of their subtrees (that we defined formally as the parts of the ductal tree sharing a common branch ancestor at branch level le = 6—that reflects the approximate extent of the rudimentary structure prior to pubertal morphogenesis). Indeed, some ductal subtrees become extremely large, containing as many as 30 generations of consecutive branching events, while neighboring subtrees may terminate precipitously (Scheele et al., 2017Scheele C.L. Hannezo E. Muraro M.J. Zomer A. Langedijk N.S. van Oudenaarden A. Simons B.D. van Rheenen J. Identity and dynamics of mammary stem cells during branching morphogenesis.Nature. 2017; 542: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed through quantitative genetic lineage tracing methods that the complexity of the mammary epithelium does not derive from intrinsic heterogeneity of tip precursor populations, but from the stochastic fate decisions of equipotent tips, which either branch (bifurcate) or terminate (through cell-cycle exit) with near equal-probability (Scheele et al., 2017Scheele C.L. Hannezo E. Muraro M.J. Zomer A. Langedijk N.S. van Oudenaarden A. Simons B.D. van Rheenen J. Identity and dynamics of mammary stem cells during branching morphogenesis.Nature. 2017; 542: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), suggestive of a local control of tip fate. However, such a focus on spatially averaged models of branching morphogenesis (Zubkov et al., 2015Zubkov V.S. Combes A.N. Short K.M. Lefevre J. Hamilton N.A. Smyth I.M. Little M.H. Byrne H.M. A spatially-averaged mathematical model of kidney branching morphogenesis.J. Theor. Biol. 2015; 379: 24-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) cannot resolve the spatiotemporal dynamics and mechanistic basis of the underlying regulatory program, nor its potential conservation in other organs. How can such a balance between tip termination and branching be regulated at the population level? One possibility is that tip branching and termination rates are dependent on the local epithelial density. Indeed, an increase in the termination rate and/or a decrease in the branching rate with local density can ensure that the system reaches a robust steady state, characterized by a balance between tip branching and termination (Method Details). Interestingly, such behavior generically produces glands of uniform spatial density, a feature that we verified experimentally by reconstructions of whole adult mammary glands (n = 14 glands, Figures 1A and 1B ). However, to understand whether it is branching or termination events that are actively regulated, we turned to quantitative measurements. In particular, parameterization of the distribution of mammary branch lengths (defined as the distance between consecutive branching points) revealed a strikingly exponential dependence, with an average branch length that remains approximately constant over time (Scheele et al., 2017Scheele C.L. Hannezo E. Muraro M.J. Zomer A. Langedijk N.S. van Oudenaarden A. Simons B.D. van Rheenen J. Identity and dynamics of mammary stem cells during branching morphogenesis.Nature. 2017; 542: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that the timing between consecutive branching events is random and statistically uncorrelated, pointing to a stochastic and time-invariant program of tip branching. This behavior stands in stark contrast with the early stages of lung morphogenesis, where branch lengths for a given branching level are tightly controlled (Iber and Menshykau, 2013Iber D. Menshykau D. The control of branching morphogenesis.Open Biol. 2013; 3: 130088Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We then examined the spatial organization of the ductal network. As the mammary fat pad constrains growth to a thin pancake-like geometry, ductal morphogenesis of the mammary epithelium takes place in a near 2D setting. Against this background, inspection of whole gland reconstructions revealed a strikingly low frequency of ductal crossovers (Figures 1A, 1C, 1D, and S1) with terminated tips often residing close to an existing duct or the fat pad boundary (Silberstein, 2001Silberstein G.B. Postnatal mammary gland morphogenesis.Microsc. Res. Tech. 2001; 52: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that ductal elongation and branching may proceed as a “default state,” with tip termination occurring only when tips come into proximity with existing ducts. Such behavior is consistent with in vitro measurements (Nelson et al., 2006Nelson C.M. Vanduijn M.M. Inman J.L. Fletcher D.A. Bissell M.J. Tissue geometry determines sites of mammary branching morphogenesis in organotypic cultures.Science. 2006; 314: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), which show that ductal branching only occurs when remote from the other ducts, with tips close to neighbors remaining inactive. Interestingly, such a model of branching morphogenesis maps directly onto the theory of “branching and annihilating random walks,” a class of models studied extensively by physicists (Cardy and Täuber, 1996Cardy J. Täuber U.C. Theory of branching and annihilating random walks.Phys. Rev. Lett. 1996; 77: 4780-4783Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) showing that the dynamics of binary tip-splitting models converge over time onto a common statistical behavior belonging to the universality class of “directed percolation.” Here, we implemented a minimal model of branching morphogenesis, inspired by the theory of BARWs, where tip dynamics involves only three processes (depicted in Figure 2A): (1) ducts elongate from active tips in a random direction with a speed v—“a persistent random walk”—leaving behind a trail of static, non-proliferative ducts; (2) at any instant, ducts can branch through stochastic tip bifurcation with a constant probability rb; and (3) ducts terminate through tip inactivation when tips come within an annihilation radius Ra of an existing duct. Significantly, numerical simulations of the model dynamics in the absence of physical boundary constraints shows that the system reaches robustly a non-equilibrium steady state in which the frequency of branching and termination events becomes naturally balanced (Figures S2A and S2B; Method Details). As tips are not observed to cross the boundary of the fat pad and frequently terminate in their proximity (Figure 1A), we further implemented simulations of branching morphogenesis in a rectangular box of length Lx and width Lz to mimic these geometric constraints. Thus, the only key parameter of the model is the ratio between the dimensions of the fat pad and the average branch length ld (the latter fixed by the ratio v/rb) (Figure 1D). Indeed, this geometrical parameter was fitted to its measured value (Figure S2; Method Details), so all subsequent comparisons with experiment represent the result of model predictions that do not involve the adjustment of any free parameter. While a visual inspection of a typical simulation output revealed good qualitative agreement between the experiment and the theoretical predictions of the spatial organization (Figure 2B) and topology (Figure 2C) of the mammary ductal network, can such a simple model dynamics also provide quantitative insights? To address this question, we first quantified how the predicted frequency of tip bifurcation versus termination events evolves with branch level (i.e., the number of generations since the origin). Interestingly, as well as recapitulating long-term balance in the frequency of tip bifurcation and termination, we found that the model faithfully reproduced the dynamics of convergence toward balance, from an initial stage of symmetric branching early in pubertal development, where the ductal density is low (Figure 2D, R2 = 0.73). Strikingly, the model also predicted with high precision the heterogeneity of subtrees in mammary glands (defined in Figure 2C), quantified both by the subtree size distribution (Figure 2E, R2 = 0.96) and the subtree persistence to a given level (Figure 2F, R2 = 0.99). Importantly, the spatial model accounted more accurately for the abundance of very large subtrees, which appear due to spatial “priming” in low density regions, than the previously published “zero-dimensional” model (Scheele et al., 2017Scheele C.L. Hannezo E. Muraro M.J. Zomer A. Langedijk N.S. van Oudenaarden A. Simons B.D. van Rheenen J. Identity and dynamics of mammary stem cells during branching morphogenesis.Nature. 2017; 542: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) in which tip branching and termination events are defined intrinsically and probabilistically. More generally, to explore the specificity of the model, we also considered the quantitative predictions made by eight further classes of models, corresponding to various alternative proposals from the literature. In each case, their applicability to the experimental data was found to be limited (see Figures S3 and S4A–S4D; Method Details). Having established how the final state of the mammary epithelium is specified, we turned to examine whether the full dynamics of growth could also be predicted quantitatively. To gain insight into the nature and parametric dependences of the growth dynamics, we considered the hydrodynamic limit of the model in which the kinetics is captured by a mean-field theory, a manifestation of a “two-species Fisher-KPP equation” (Fisher, 1937Fisher R.A. The wave of advance of advantageous genes.Ann. Eugen. 1937; 7: 355-369Crossref Google Scholar) (Method Details):{∂ta=D∇2a+rba(1−a+in0)∂ti=rea+rbn0a(a+i),(1) where a(x,t) and i(x,t) denote, respectively, the local concentration of active (tip) and inactive (duct) segments or “particles.” Referring to the description of the model dynamics above, active particles diffuse with diffusion constant D while producing inactive segments at rate re (reflecting the process of ductal elongation), branch at rate rb, and annihilate when they meet another particle (reflecting the process of tip inactivation), giving rise to a logistic growth term saturating at a total steady-state density, n0 (for details of how Equation 1 emerges from the stochastic model and can be related to biological signaling pathways, see Method Details). Within this framework, both theory and numerical simulations predict that, during expansion, active tips become self-organized into a narrow pulse at the growing front of the developing epithelium, traveling at constant speed as a solitary wave and leaving in its wake an inactive ductal network of constant density (Figures 3A, 3B , and S4D–S4I ; Movie S1).Figure S4Numerical Simulations of Branching and Annihilating Random Walks Are Captured by a Fisher-KPP Mean-Field Theory, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Typical simulation output for branching and annihilating random walks with a regulation on the branching probability, and constant and uniform annihilation probability.

For r¯ = 0.1, one notices that the approximation matches very well the integration of the full equation. Increasing r¯ = 1 produces sharper pulses as expected, but still leads to the same phenomenology discussed in the r¯ → 0 limit of a pulse which decays slower in the back that in the front.(I) Experimental density of ducts (black) and proliferative tips (same as Figure 3D), overlaid with the fitted analytical prediction of an exponential decay at the front for both tips and ducts (dashed line).

(D) The key aspects of (C) are well-captured by a mean field Fisher-KPP theory, for which we show a typical numerical integration output (rescaled branching rate r¯ = 1), for different time points (red, orange, green and blue represent successive times). The full lines represent the density of active tips, while the dashed lines represent the density of inactive particles, i.e., ducts. (E) Kymograph of the numerical integration of Figure 3B, showing the propagation of a solitary pulse of active tips, traveling at constant density (rescaled branching rate r¯ = 0.1). The dashed line represents the analytical prediction for a speed of V = 2r¯1/2, which fits very well the numerical simulation. (F) Stationary shape of the KPP pulse in the same numerical simulation as E/, with the x axis rescaled around 0 (red). The dashed black lines represent of the analytical prediction for the exponential decay length of the back and front of the front, fitting very well with the numerical simulations. (G) Numerical integration of the Fisher-KPP equations, with the same parameters as Figure 3B, but making the approximation discussed in the STAR Methods that i≪a and ra(a+i)≪¯a. We observe very similar results, validating the approximation scheme, for different time points (red, orange, green and blue represent successive times). The full lines represent the density of active tips, while the dashed lines represent the density of inactive particles, i.e., ducts. (H) Stationary shape of the KPP pulse, comparing three conditions: numerical integration of the full KPP equations as in (D) (full red line, r¯ = 0.1), approximation discussed in (F) (dashed orange line, r¯ = 0.1), and numerical integration of the full KPP equations for larger r¯ = 1, where the approximation becomes invalid (thin black line). For r¯ = 0.1, one notices that the approximation matches very well the integration of the full equation. Increasing r¯ = 1 produces sharper pulses as expected, but still leads to the same phenomenology discussed in the r¯ → 0 limit of a pulse which decays slower in the back that in the front. (I) Experimental density of ducts (black) and proliferative tips (same as Figure 3D), overlaid with the fitted analytical prediction of an exponential decay at the front for both tips and ducts (dashed line). Importantly, the back of the pulse was well-fitted by the theoretical prediction of a slope √2 − 1 (less steep, dashed line). (J) Reconstruction of a 5w third mammary gland following an Edu pulse, showing a similar result as Figure 3C, with a pulse of tips at the invasion front and large density fluctuations. (K) Zoom on representative terminal end bud structures, i.e., active tips containing highly proliferative cells, from the boxes shown on I. Error bars represent mean and s.e.m. Scale bars: 5 mm (I) and 100μ m (J). K14 in white, EdU in red. From a biological perspective, this behavior provides a natural explanation for the constant speed of invasion, a robust feature"
https://openalex.org/W2756839240,"The periodic segmentation of the vertebrate body axis into somites, and later vertebrae, relies on a genetic oscillator (the segmentation clock) driving the rhythmic activity of signaling pathways in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM). To understand whether oscillations are an intrinsic property of individual cells or represent a population-level phenomenon, we established culture conditions for stable oscillations at the cellular level. This system was used to demonstrate that oscillations are a collective property of PSM cells that can be actively triggered in vitro by a dynamical quorum sensing signal involving Yap and Notch signaling. Manipulation of Yap-dependent mechanical cues is sufficient to predictably switch isolated PSM cells from a quiescent to an oscillatory state in vitro, a behavior reminiscent of excitability in other systems. Together, our work argues that the segmentation clock behaves as an excitable system, introducing a broader paradigm to study such dynamics in vertebrate morphogenesis."

We isolated a human monoclonal antibody (mAb), ZKA190, that potently cross-neutralizes multi-lineage ZIKV strains. ZKA190 is highly effective in vivo in preventing morbidity and mortality of ZIKV-infected mice. NMR and cryo-electron microscopy show its binding to an exposed epitope on DIII of the E protein. ZKA190 Fab binds all 180 E protein copies, altering the virus quaternary arrangement and surface curvature.

To counter this problem, we developed a bispecific antibody (FIT-1) comprising ZKA190 and a second mAb specific for DII of E protein. In addition to retaining high in vitro and in vivo potencies, FIT-1 robustly prevented viral escape, warranting its development as a ZIKV immunotherapy."

Establishing specific chromosomal linkages depends on cohesin recruitment to defined loci. One such locus is the budding yeast centromere, which is a paradigm for targeted cohesin loading. The kinetochore, a multiprotein complex that connects centromeres to microtubules, drives the recruitment of high levels of cohesin to link sister chromatids together. We have exploited this system to determine the mechanism of specific cohesin recruitment. We show that phosphorylation of the Ctf19 kinetochore protein by a conserved kinase, DDK, provides a binding site for the Scc2/4 cohesin loading complex, thereby directing cohesin loading to centromeres. A similar mechanism targets cohesin to chromosomes in vertebrates. These findings represent a complete molecular description of targeted cohesin loading, a phenomenon with wide-ranging importance in chromosome segregation and, in multicellular organisms, transcription regulation.

A similar mechanism targets cohesin to chromosomes in vertebrates. These findings represent a complete molecular description of targeted cohesin loading, a phenomenon with wide-ranging importance in chromosome segregation and, in multicellular organisms, transcription regulation. Genome maintenance, expression, and transmission depend on organization of chromosomes into functional domains. At the heart of this organization, in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, are protein complexes in the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) family: cohesin, condensin, and SMC5/6 (Uhlmann, 2016Uhlmann F. SMC complexes: from DNA to chromosomes.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2016; 17: 399-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). These complexes must be targeted to specific regions of the chromosome, including areas of damage, transcriptional units, and centromeres. Biological control of SMC complex activity thus relies on interactions that direct these complexes to particular chromosomal sites at appropriate times. The best understood of the SMC complexes is cohesin, which links newly duplicated chromosomes in preparation for their segregation during cell division. At the core of the cohesin complex is a three-protein ring (Smc1, Smc3, and Scc1) (Losada and Hirano, 2005Losada A. Hirano T.

A separate and broadly conserved two-protein complex called Scc2/4 in yeast and NIPBL/Mau2 in humans loads cohesin onto chromosomes (Ciosk et al., 2000Ciosk R. Shirayama M. Shevchenko A. Tanaka T.

Cell. 2000; 5: 243-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). While the yeast Scc2 and Scc4 genes were cloned initially due to their role in sister chromatid cohesion, the fly homolog of Scc2, Nipped-B, was first identified as a gene required for proper enhancer function (Rollins et al., 1999Rollins R.A. Morcillo P. Dorsett D. Nipped-B, a Drosophila homologue of chromosomal adherins, participates in activation by remote enhancers in the cut and Ultrabithorax genes.Genetics. 1999; 152: 577-593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Heterozygous mutations in NIPBL cause Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS), a developmental disorder associated with aberrant transcription across the genome (Kawauchi et al., 2009Kawauchi S. Calof A.L.

Li J. Schaaf C.A. Gause M. Gilmour D.S. Dorsett D. Cohesin selectively binds and regulates genes with paused RNA polymerase.Curr. Biol. 2011; 21: 1624-1634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) makes determining molecular pathways for targeted cohesin loading an issue of broad interest. Genomic locations of cohesin enrichment exist in all eukaryotes, but the phenomenon is best understood in the context of the yeast centromere. Cohesin density peaks at or near centromeres and extends to nearby pericentromeric regions (Glynn et al., 2004Glynn E.F. Megee P.C. Yu H.G. Mistrot C. Unal E. Koshland D.E. DeRisi J.L. Gerton J.L.

In mitosis, pericentromeric cohesin complexes enable spindle assembly checkpoint silencing by resisting the poleward forces exerted by kinetochore microtubules (Stern and Murray, 2001Stern B.M. Murray A.W. Lack of tension at kinetochores activates the spindle checkpoint in budding yeast.Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1462-1467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, Tanaka et al., 2000Tanaka T. Fuchs J. Loidl J. Nasmyth K. Cohesin ensures bipolar attachment of microtubules to sister centromeres and resists their precocious separation.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Disabling this process causes high rates of chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy, both pervasive features of cancer (Holland and Cleveland, 2012Holland A.J. Cleveland D.W. Losing balance: the origin and impact of aneuploidy in cancer.EMBO Rep. 2012; 13: 501-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In meiosis, high pericentromeric cohesin occupancy serves at least three functions critical for avoiding aneuploidy (Nasmyth, 2001Nasmyth K. Disseminating the genome: joining, resolving, and separating sister chromatids during mitosis and meiosis.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 673-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). First, at least in fission yeast, it prevents biorientation of sister kinetochores in meiosis I, thus facilitating reductional chromosome segregation (Sakuno et al., 2009Sakuno T. Tada K. Watanabe Y.

Cohesin Rec8 is required for reductional chromosome segregation at meiosis.Nature. 1999; 400: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Second, its selective preservation at centromeres throughout meiosis I is required for accurate chromosome segregation in meiosis II (Lee and Orr-Weaver, 2001Lee J.Y. Orr-Weaver T.L. The molecular basis of sister-chromatid cohesion.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 753-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Third, it represses crossover recombination close to centromeres (Vincenten et al., 2015Vincenten N. Kuhl L.M. Lam I. Oke A. Kerr A.R. Hochwagen A. Fung J. Keeney S. Vader G. Marston A.L. The kinetochore prevents centromere-proximal crossover recombination during meiosis.eLife. 2015; 4: e10850Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), which would otherwise lead to meiosis II nondisjunction (Rockmill et al., 2006Rockmill B. Voelkel-Meiman K. Roeder G.S. Centromere-proximal crossovers are associated with precocious separation of sister chromatids during meiosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 2006; 174: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Preferential cohesin loading at centromeres is a kinetochore-dependent process (Megee and Koshland, 1999Megee P.C. Koshland D.

The yeast Ctf19 complex, the homolog of the human Constitutive Centromere Associated Network (CCAN), enables this function by recruiting the cohesin loader to centromeres (Eckert et al., 2007Eckert C.A.

We have shown previously that Scc2 recruitment to centromeres requires a conserved surface on the Scc4 protein (Hinshaw et al., 2015Hinshaw S.M. Makrantoni V. Kerr A. Marston A.L. Harrison S.C. Structural evidence for Scc4-dependent localization of cohesin loading.eLife. 2015; 4: e06057Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Mutation of amino acid residues at this surface abrogates Scc2/4 recruitment to centromeres, causes loss of cohesion specifically at centromeres, and leads to elevated rates of minichromosome missegregation. In the work reported here, we sought to identify the kinetochore factor mediating Scc2/4 recruitment, to describe the mode of regulation that restricts specific centromeric cohesin loading to a narrow window of the cell cycle, and to understand whether a similar recruitment process operates in other species. One factor likely to play a broad role in regulating targeted cohesin loading is the Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK). DDK is a cell-cycle-regulated kinase that is required for the preferential association of cohesin with centromeres in budding and fission yeast and with unreplicated chromatin in vertebrates (Bailis et al., 2003Bailis J.M. Bernard P. Antonelli R. Allshire R.C. Forsburg S.L. Hsk1-Dfp1 is required for heterochromatin-mediated cohesion at centromeres.Nat.

Cdc7-Drf1 kinase links chromosome cohesion to the initiation of DNA replication in Xenopus egg extracts.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1894-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The essential function of DDK is to activate the Mcm2-7 helicase for DNA replication (Sheu and Stillman, 2010Sheu Y.J. Stillman B. The Dbf4-Cdc7 kinase promotes S phase by alleviating an inhibitory activity in Mcm4.Nature. 2010; 463: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In yeast, the Ctf19 complex recruits DDK to kinetochores in G1, where its activity enables subsequent Scc2 recruitment and robust centromere cohesion independently of its role in DNA replication (Natsume et al., 2013Natsume T. Müller C.A. Katou Y. Retkute R. Gierliński M. Araki H. Blow J.J. Shirahige K. Nieduszynski C.A. Tanaka T.U.

Cell. 2013; 50: 661-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In Xenopus laevis egg extracts, DDK activity is required for the association of Scc2/4 with replication origins (Takahashi et al., 2008Takahashi T.S. Basu A. Bermudez V. Hurwitz J. Walter J.C. Cdc7-Drf1 kinase links chromosome cohesion to the initiation of DNA replication in Xenopus egg extracts.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1894-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that DDK is part of a common mechanism for directing cohesin loading activity to defined chromosomal locations and for coupling this activity with the onset of DNA replication. Using the budding yeast centromere as a model, we have determined the molecular pathway that drives targeted cohesin loading. We report here that DDK phosphorylates the Ctf19 protein. Phosphorylated Ctf19 interacts directly with the previously identified conserved surface of Scc4, explaining both the requirement for DDK in centromeric cohesion establishment and the nature of Scc4-mediated targeting of cohesin loading to centromeres. Our results thus provide a full description of the molecular events required to recruit cohesin to a defined chromosomal locus. Several observations suggest that DDK phosphorylates a component of the Ctf19 complex (Figure 1A) and that this signal recruits Scc2 to centromeres. First, DDK localization at kinetochores immediately precedes Scc2 localization and subsequent cohesin loading (Natsume et al., 2013Natsume T. Müller C.A. Katou Y. Retkute R. Gierliński M. Araki H. Blow J.J. Shirahige K. Nieduszynski C.A. Tanaka T.U. Kinetochores coordinate pericentromeric cohesion and early DNA replication by Cdc7-Dbf4 kinase recruitment.Mol. Cell. 2013; 50: 661-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Second, Scc4 has a conserved, positively charged, surface patch important for Scc2 localization, leading to the suggestion that this patch might be a phosphopeptide binding motif (Chao et al., 2015Chao W.C. Murayama Y. Muñoz S. Costa A. Uhlmann F. Singleton M.R.

Makrantoni V. Kerr A. Marston A.L. Harrison S.C. Structural evidence for Scc4-dependent localization of cohesin loading.eLife. 2015; 4: e06057Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Third, the interaction between Scc2/4 and DDK is probably indirect in yeast, as it is not observable in a reconstituted pulldown system (our unpublished observations). To determine whether DDK can bind proteins of the Ctf19 complex, we performed pulldowns using recombinant Ctf19 complex proteins and detected associated radiolabeled DDK produced by in vitro translation (Figure S1). We identified two candidate DDK interaction partners: the Ctf19-Mcm21 dimer and the Ctf3 complex. Although the Ctf19-Mcm21 dimer associates with the Okp1 and Ame1 proteins to make the COMA tetramer (CENP-P/O/Q/U in humans) (De Wulf et al., 2003De Wulf P. McAinsh A.D. Sorger P.K.

The Ctf3 complex is a trimeric assembly of Ctf3, Mcm16, and Mcm22 (CENP-I/H/K in humans) (Measday et al., 2002Measday V. Hailey D.W. Pot I. Givan S.A. Hyland K.M. Cagney G. Fields S. Davis T.N.

Bead-bound proteins after Ni2+-affinity pulldowns were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (top). Purified bait proteins were analyzed separately by Coomassie stain (bottom). DDK associates with the Ctf3 trimer and with the Ctf19-Mcm21 dimer. The identification of Ctf19-Mcm21 and Ctf3 as DDK binding partners suggested that they could be the kinetochore substrates that generate the signal for recruitment of Scc2 to centromeres. We therefore purified DDK from yeast and performed kinase activity assays using Ctf19 complex proteins as substrates. Purified DDK phosphorylated Ctf19-Mcm21 but not the Ctf3 trimer or the Chl4-Iml3 dimer (Figure 1B). To confirm that phosphate transfer to Ctf19-Mcm21 depended on the catalytic activity of Cdc7 and not a co-purifying kinase, we purified an ATP analog (PP1)-sensitive mutant of DDK (Wan et al., 2006Wan L. Zhang C. Shokat K.M. Hollingsworth N.M. Chemical inactivation of cdc7 kinase in budding yeast results in a reversible arrest that allows efficient cell synchronization prior to meiotic recombination.Genetics. 2006; 174: 1767-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Phosphate transfer to Ctf19 was inhibited by PP1 at concentrations (∼25 μM) similar to those that inhibit kinase activity in vivo (Figure S2A) (Wan et al., 2006Wan L. Zhang C. Shokat K.M. Hollingsworth N.M. Chemical inactivation of cdc7 kinase in budding yeast results in a reversible arrest that allows efficient cell synchronization prior to meiotic recombination.Genetics. 2006; 174: 1767-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These experiments confirm that Ctf19-Mcm21, but not Ctf3, is a DDK substrate in vitro. We next sought to identify the Ctf19-Mcm21 residues targeted by DDK. A crystal structure of the Ctf19-Mcm21 dimer showed that N-terminal segments of both proteins are flexible (Schmitzberger and Harrison, 2012Schmitzberger F. Harrison S.C. RWD domain: a recurring module in kinetochore architecture shown by a Ctf19-Mcm21 complex structure.EMBO Rep. 2012; 13: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We found that trypsin digestion of phosphorylated Ctf19-Mcm21 removed the phosphorylated residues under conditions that preferentially cleave the N-terminal tails from both proteins (Figure S2B), indicating that DDK phosphorylates residues in these unstructured regions. Inspection of the N-terminal region of Ctf19 revealed three clusters of candidate phosphorylation sites (Figure 1C), and we found no candidates in the N-terminal region of Mcm21. DDK did not phosphorylate Ctf19-Mcm21 lacking the first 30 amino acids of Ctf19 (ctf19-Δ30), confirming that the DDK target site lies in this region. A Ctf19-Mcm21 complex in which Ctf19 was N-terminally tagged with MBP was also not phosphorylated in vitro, suggesting that residues very close to the N terminus of Ctf19 are important for phosphorylation by DDK. The serine and threonine residues near the Ctf19 N terminus are arranged in three near-repeat sequences, reminiscent of DDK target sites in Mcm4 and Rif1 (Hiraga et al., 2014Hiraga S. Alvino G.M.

We mutated to alanine all candidate phosphate acceptors in the Ctf19 N-terminal region (ctf19-9A) or just a single candidate in each of the three near-repeat sequences (ctf19-3A-1) and tested for phosphate transfer to these complexes in vitro (Figures 1D and 1E). In all cases, phosphorylation was reduced to background levels. Mutation of just the first two candidate sites (T4, T5) to generate the ctf19-2A mutant (Figure 1D) did not abolish phosphorylation (Figure S2C). Finally, we also tested the effect of the Ctf3 complex on Ctf19 phosphorylation and found that it did not enhance phosphate transfer to Ctf19 in vitro (Figure S2D). We conclude that the Ctf19 N-terminal region is a specific substrate of DDK. To test for phosphorylation in vivo, we purified Ctf19 from yeast and examined its mobility through a phostag-acrylamide matrix. We observed a slowly migrating species of wild-type Ctf19, which was susceptible to phosphatase treatment (Figure 2A, arrow). This Ctf19 mobility shift was evident in cells arrested in G1 (Figure 2C), S phase, and metaphase (Figures S3A and S3B). Ctf19 purified from ctf19-9A cells did not show this shift, indicating that the sites required for phosphorylation in vitro are also required for phosphorylation in vivo (Figure 2A). Mutating only the potential phosphorylation sites closest to the N terminus of Ctf19 (Figure 1D) did not eliminate the Ctf19 mobility shift (Figure 2B; Ctf19-2A; Ctf19-3A-2). Indeed, the Ctf19-2A protein with substitutions only at residues T4 and S5 was phosphorylated robustly in vivo as it was in vitro (Figures 2B and S2C).Figure S3In Vivo Analysis of Ctf19 Phosphorylation, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Ctf19 phosphorylation in arrested cultures (2h in arresting conditions; G1 – alpha factor; S phase – hydroxyurea; Metaphase – nocodazole and benomyl; arrows – phosphorylated Ctf19; ∗ – non-specific band).

To determine whether DDK localization is important for Ctf19 phosphorylation in vivo, we tested the effect of appending a C-terminal 9-myc tag to Dbf4, which perturbs DDK recruitment to the kinetochore in G1 (Natsume et al., 2013Natsume T. Müller C.A. Katou Y. Retkute R. Gierliński M. Araki H. Blow J.J. Shirahige K. Nieduszynski C.A. Tanaka T.U.

Cell. 2013; 50: 661-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Although the effect was subtle, we found decreased Ctf19 phosphorylation levels in this background (Figure S3C), supporting the idea that recruitment of DDK to kinetochores in G1 is important for robust Ctf19 phosphorylation. In the absence of Chl4, a Ctf19 complex protein required for DDK association with centromeres in G1 (Natsume et al., 2013Natsume T. Müller C.A. Katou Y. Retkute R. Gierliński M. Araki H. Blow J.J. Shirahige K. Nieduszynski C.A. Tanaka T.U. Kinetochores coordinate pericentromeric cohesion and early DNA replication by Cdc7-Dbf4 kinase recruitment.Mol. Cell. 2013; 50: 661-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), Ctf19 phosphorylation was only partly perturbed in asynchronous cultures but completely eliminated in G1-arrested cultures (Figures 2C and S3D). We conclude that the N-terminal region of Ctf19 is phosphorylated in vivo, and Chl4 determines the extent and timing of this phosphorylation. If Chl4, which is not required for Ctf19 localization (Pot et al., 2003Pot I. Measday V. Snydsman B. Cagney G. Fields S. Davis T.N. Muller E.G. Hieter P. Chl4p and iml3p are two new members of the budding yeast outer kinetochore.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 460-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), determines Ctf19 phosphorylation levels by enabling DDK recruitment to kinetochores in G1, then overproduction of DDK should bypass this effect. To test this hypothesis, we overexpressed both DDK subunits from a galactose-inducible expression cassette and probed for Ctf19 phosphorylation (Figure 2D). Ctf19 phosphorylation was readily observable upon DDK overexpression in cells lacking Chl4 but not in the ctf19-9A strain. This result shows that Chl4 is dispensable for Ctf19 phosphorylation when DDK levels are not limiting. In addition to the Ctf19 complex, robust centromere cohesion requires additional factors including Csm3 and Dcc1, members of the fork protection complex (FPC) and an alternative PCNA loading complex, respectively (Fernius and Marston, 2009Fernius J.

These results have implications for manipulating tissue-resident memory T cells through vaccination and open up new lines of inquiry for the analysis of immune responses at the organism level. No metazoan cell or organ is an island. Cells and organs must coordinate their actions at the whole-organism scale, both locally and systemically (Droujinine and Perrimon, 2016Droujinine I.A. Perrimon N. Interorgan communication pathways in physiology: focus on Drosophila.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2016; 50: 539-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). For example, the mammalian immune system opposes infection through secreted and cellular factors that transcend organ boundaries. Secreted factors, such as cytokines and growth factors, can act on local and distant tissues to trigger inflammation (e.g., tumor necrosis factor [TNF] and interleukin-1 [IL-1]) (Medzhitov, 2008Medzhitov R. Origin and physiological roles of inflammation.Nature. 2008; 454: 428-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (3919) Google Scholar), antiviral responses (e.g., type I interferons [IFNs]) (López and Hermesh, 2011López C.B. Hermesh T. Systemic responses during local viral infections: type I IFNs sound the alarm.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2011; 23: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), or to modify the cellular output of hematopoiesis (e.g., granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF] and IL-6) (Manz and Boettcher, 2014Manz M.G. Boettcher S. Emergency granulopoiesis.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14: 302-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). In addition, cellular factors such as memory T cells can act as systemic or local safeguards against infection by patrolling across organs or residing in a previously infected tissue (Schenkel and Masopust, 2014Schenkel J.M. Masopust D. Tissue-resident memory T cells.Immunity. 2014; 41: 886-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Yet, despite this knowledge, many basic questions about how mammalian immune responses operate at the organism level remain unanswered, such as when and where immune pathways are activated throughout the body upon local or systemic infection and how these pathways contribute to host protection. To answer these questions, we need to tackle the challenges posed by the ubiquitous nature of immune factors by developing new ways to observe and quantify immune responses at the level of the entire organism. Current approaches to study immunity in vivo mostly focus on measuring changes at the level of proteins, RNAs or chromatin in one or more immune cell types in one organ (Brandes et al., 2013Brandes M.

However, to dissect organismal immunity, it is also critical (1) to capture the dynamic changes of an immune response, as opposed to static snapshots, (2) to include all potential players from immune to non-immune cells, and (3) to maintain the links to the rest of the system that spans across all tissues. We reasoned that gene expression analyses of whole organs can help to address these challenges as this methodology successfully found shared and tissue-specific expression patterns that vary across healthy individuals (Melé et al., 2015Melé M.

In addition, organ-level expression can detect immunological changes driven by cell composition or direct gene regulation, even in rare cells (Ariotti et al., 2014Ariotti S.

A systems analysis identifies a feedforward inflammatory circuit leading to lethal influenza infection.Cell. 2013; 154: 197-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Based on these evidence, we hypothesized that systematically measuring gene expression over time in whole organs can track immune processes across a mammalian organism. To test this hypothesis, we focused on immune processes leading to protective immunity at the organism level. We used a comparative mouse infection model based on two poxvirus strains with vaccinating (modified Vaccinia Ankara [MVA]) and pathogenic (Western Reserve [WR]) properties. The DNA genome of WR is 85% (165,427/194,710 bp) identical to MVA, which is explained by the loss of 94 genes encoding virulence factors from the MVA genome (Figure 1A) (Meyer et al., 1991Meyer H. Sutter G. Mayr A. Mapping of deletions in the genome of the highly attenuated vaccinia virus MVA and their influence on virulence.J. Gen. Virol. 1991; 72: 1031-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). As a result, MVA is non-virulent and non-replicative in most mammalian cells, which makes it a live attenuated vaccine and vector of choice in clinical settings (Moss, 2011Moss B. Smallpox vaccines: targets of protective immunity.Immunol. Rev. 2011; 239: 8-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Here, using this comparative viral infection model, we successfully observed immune signal propagation across organs, and obtained a dynamic map of immune processes at the organism level. We discovered and functionally validated two inter-organ mechanisms mediated by secreted and cellular factors—type I IFNs and tissue-resident memory T cells, respectively—that protect the host from systemic viral pathogenesis. To study the dynamics of immune responses at the organism level, we used poxvirus strains MVA and WR to compare three types of immune responses in vivo: (1) vaccinating (MVA only), (2) lethal (WR only), and (3) protective (MVA followed by WR challenge) (Figure 1B). MVA was administered subcutaneously (s.c.) and WR intranasally (i.n.) to mimic routes of vaccination and natural infection, respectively. WR infection was lethal within 8 days, on average, whereas MVA had no effect on animal weight and survival (Figure 1C), consistent with previous work (Wyatt et al., 2004Wyatt L.S. Earl P.L. Eller L.A. Moss B. Highly attenuated smallpox vaccine protects mice with and without immune deficiencies against pathogenic vaccinia virus challenge.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 4590-4595Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). We collected 17 tissues per animal, including blood, at 11 time points after infection (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 days) for all three cohorts and from uninfected controls using four biological replicates per condition (Figure 1D). To track viral spread across tissues, we measured the RNA levels of the viral gene E3L encoded in both MVA and WR genomes (Table S1). MVA-derived E3L RNAs were detected at skin and, to a lesser extent, in the inguinal draining lymph node (dLN) (Figures 1E, S1A, and S1B). Importantly, absolute quantifications of viral DNA and RNA across tissues confirmed that MVA did not spread beyond skin and the dLN (Figures S1C–S1F), in agreement with previous studies (Gómez et al., 2007Gómez C.E. Nájera J.L. Domingo-Gil E. Ochoa-Callejero L. González-Aseguinolaza G. Esteban M. Virus distribution of the attenuated MVA and NYVAC poxvirus strains in mice.J. Gen. Virol. 2007; 88: 2473-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). By contrast, WR rapidly spread to most tissues within a time frame (36–72 hr) preceding the appearance of body weight changes (>72 hr) (Figures 1E, S1A, and S1B). Interestingly, the early dissemination of WR was similar in MVA-vaccinated hosts in terms of target tissues (lung, liver, spleen, and brain), but was followed by immediate viral clearance (Figures 1E, S1A, and S1B). The signal present at skin in the MVA-WR cohort was due to remaining MVA mRNAs in infected cells (Figures 1E and S1A). Whole-mount tissue imaging confirmed the patterns of viral spread and revealed key aspects of viral pathogenesis that cannot be inferred from viral gene expression alone (Figures 1F–1I). For example, MVA infected many skin cells, including stromal and immune cells, such as major histocompatibility complex class II positive (MHC class II+) cells (Figure 1F), as reported by others (Mahe et al., 2009Mahe B. Vogt A. Liard C. Duffy D. Abadie V. Bonduelle O. Boissonnas A. Sterry W. Verrier B. Blume-Peytavi U. Combadiere B.

Dermatol. 2009; 129: 1156-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). MVA also reached the subcapsular sinus area of the dLN (Figure S1G), in agreement with previous work (Eickhoff et al., 2015Eickhoff S. Brewitz A. Gerner M.Y. Klauschen F. Komander K. Hemmi H. Garbi N. Kaisho T. Germain R.N. Kastenmüller W. Robust anti-viral immunity requires multiple distinct T cell-dendritic cell interactions.Cell. 2015; 162: 1322-1337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). After WR entry, lungs were infected in multiple foci, whereas infected brain cells were limited to the olfactory bulb, suggesting that WR’s access to the brain is likely limited to the nasal cavity (Figures 1H–1I). Lastly, the presence of infectious WR virions was confirmed in whole-tissue lysates (Figure S1H). Next, we sought to study host gene expression dynamics across the organism in lethal, vaccinating, and protective contexts. We performed whole-tissue RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on 9 out of the 17 tissues collected at 5 time points (0, 0.5, 1.5, 3, and 5 days), which were selected based on (1) MVA presence for skin and dLN, (2) WR presence for brain, lung, liver, spleen, bone marrow, and blood, and (3) pathological signs despite little to no detectable WR presence for small intestine. All measured profiles clustered by tissue type in principal component analysis (PCA) and showed a separation between blood and solid tissues, with brain and liver being the most distinct (Figure 2A). MVA and WR did not modify the transcriptional boundaries existing between tissues, but distinct responses were readily detectable at the single-tissue level. For example, skin and liver transcriptional signatures changed within hours following MVA immunization, whereas WR affected the transcriptional outputs of these two tissues at later times (Figures 2B and 2C), in agreement with the timing and geography of WR propagation (Figure S1B). In total, we identified 2,018 genes differentially expressed between infected and matching, uninfected samples across all 9 tissues, which were mostly tissue specific with some exceptions (Figures 2D and S2A; Table S2). Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that all tissue types regulated genes associated with immune processes in at least one of the three cohorts (Figure S2B; Table S2). For example, some MVA-regulated genes pointed to well-known processes, such as the early induction of the monocyte chemoattractant Ccl2 and surface markers Ccr2 and Ly6c1 (Figure 2E), which mirrors the influx of monocytes observed at skin (Figure S2C). In addition, genes known as markers for T cell activation (Cd69), proliferation (Mki67) and effector function (Gzma) were upregulated in dLN upon MVA infection (Figure 2E), reflecting the increase in virus-specific CD8+ T cells in dLN and skin (Figures S2C and S2D). For the protective response (MVA/WR), we identified pro-inflammatory genes encoding secreted factors in lung (Il1b) and liver (acute phase protein Cfh), and genes involved in eosinopoiesis in bone marrow (Ear1) (Figure 2F). Lastly, WR pathogenesis in naive mice downregulated genes important for the extracellular matrix at lung (Col3a1), metabolism at liver (Lipc) and hematopoiesis at bone marrow (Klf1), suggesting that WR replication negatively affects basic tissue functions, likely through cell death (Figure 2G). To tease apart direct transcriptional changes through gene regulation from indirect effects due to cell recruitment or proliferation, we measured the proportions of 7 immune cell subsets at lung and liver (Figure S2E). While MVA led to little changes at lung and liver, WR triggered an increase in neutrophils and decrease in B cells (Figure S2F). The rapid influx of neutrophils at lung and liver in the WR cohort preceded disease symptoms (moribund state, weight loss), similar to influenza (Brandes et al., 2013Brandes M. Klauschen F. Kuchen S. Germain R.N. A systems analysis identifies a feedforward inflammatory circuit leading to lethal influenza infection.Cell. 2013; 154: 197-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In the protective response (MVA/WR), myeloid cells, such as neutrophils, showed a rapid (36 hr) but transient increase, whereas CD8+ T cells increased after days 3–5 (Figure S2F). Importantly, for MVA and MVA/WR cohorts, the changes in expression detected within the first 12 hr at lung and liver are likely due to active gene regulation, given that no significant changes in cellular composition were detectable at that time (Figure S2F). Skin MVA vaccination led to changes in gene expression in most tissues despite the limited presence of MVA in skin and dLN (Figure 3A), suggesting that secreted factors are likely acting systemically upon local release. To test this idea, we assembled a list of 2,198 cognate, secreted ligand-receptor pairs, and examined their expression in tissues (Figure 3B). We identified 92 out of 2,198 unique ligand-receptor pairs responsible for 452 putative connections within and between tissues in all cohorts (Table S3). In the MVA cohort, most of the ligands emanated from skin and dLN (Figures 3C and 3D), whereas, in the WR and MVA/WR cohorts, many connections originated from lung, liver, and spleen (Figures S3A and S3B). Skin, liver, and lymphoid tissues (dLN, BM, and spleen) were the most interconnected tissues with responses including wound repair, inflammation, or chemotaxis (Figures S3C and S3D; Table S3).Figure S3Ligand-Receptor Connectivity across Tissues upon Lethal and Protective Responses, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Inter-organ connectivity of ligand-receptor pairs upon skin vaccination shown as circos plots for indicated times.

Among these connections, type I IFNs were produced only in skin and the dLN, yet induced IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) across tissues within 12 hr upon MVA vaccination (Figures 3E and 3F; Table S3). We asked if systemic ISG induction could confer host protection by comparing the survival of wild-type (WT) versus Ifnar1−/− or anti-IFNAR1 antibody-treated mice challenged with WR at 24 hr or 7 days after skin MVA vaccination. WT, but not knockout or antibody-treated, animals were protected against WR challenge within 24 hr, whereas all groups were protected at day 7 (Figures 3G, 3H, S3E, and S3F). Locally produced type I IFNs can thus trigger a whole-body antiviral state protective for the host, which helps explain the systemic effects of MVA in newborn mice (Mayr et al., 1986Mayr A.

Mice were challenged with WR 3 weeks after MVA vaccination, a time frame consistent with a memory recall response as effector T cells had vanished by then (Figures 4A, 4B, and S4A–S4C ) (Pillai et al., 2011Pillai V.K.B.

We observed changes in mRNA expression in lung, liver, and, to a minor extent, spleen at 12 and 36 hr after WR challenge, whereas mediastinal LN, brain, small intestine, skin, and bone marrow showed little to no changes (Figures 4C, S4D, and S4E). Collectively, lung, liver, and spleen displayed 178 differentially expressed genes, including ISGs across all three organs, and genes linked to leukocyte migration at lung or inflammatory and complement responses at liver (Figures 4D, S4F, and S4G; Table S4). Interestingly, whole-lung and whole-liver responses were driven by T cell immunity (Figure 4E; Table S4). In addition, such rapid and organ-wide activation of antiviral genes is reminiscent of the effects of tissue-resident memory CD8+ T (TRM) cells (Ariotti et al., 2014Ariotti S.

To test the hypothesis that CD8+ TRM cells could confer systemic host protection, we first asked if T cells were necessary for protection against WR challenge. Using Tcra−/− mice and CD8+ T cell depletion, we found that T cells are critical for host protection in our MVA/WR model (Figures 5A, 5B, and S5A), in agreement with previous work (Salek-Ardakani et al., 2011Salek-Ardakani S.

The currently available sources of human intestinal organoids, tissue fragments or pluripotent stem cells, involve invasive procedures or complex differentiation protocols, respectively. Here, we show that a set of four transcription factors, Hnf4α, Foxa3, Gata6, and Cdx2, can directly reprogram mouse fibroblasts to acquire the identity of fetal intestine-derived progenitor cells (FIPCs). These induced FIPCs (iFIPCs) form spherical organoids that develop into adult-type budding organoids containing cells with intestinal stem cell properties. The resulting stem cells produce all intestinal epithelial cell lineages and undergo self-renewing cell divisions. After transplantation, the induced spherical and budding organoids can reconstitute colonic and intestinal epithelia, respectively. The same combination of four defined transcription factors can also induce human iFIPCs. This alternative approach for producing intestinal organoids may well facilitate application for disease analysis and therapy development."

Here, we report that miR-125a-3p inhibits ERα transcriptional activity and, thus, ER+ breast cancer cell proliferation, which causes cell-cycle arrest at the G1/S stage, inducing apoptosis and suppressing tumor growth by targeting cyclin-dependent kinase 3 (CDK3) in vitro and in vivo. In addition, CDK3 and miR-125a-3p expression levels were measured in 37 cancerous tissues paired with noncancerous samples, and their expression levels were negatively associated with miR-125a-3p level. Of interest, miR-125a-3p level is down-regulated in MCF-7 TAM-resistant (TamR) cells. Of more importance, up-regulation of miR-125a-3p resensitizes MCF-7 TamR cells to TAM, which is dependent on CDK3 expression. These results suggest that miR-125a-3p can function as a novel tumor suppressor in ER+ breast cancer by targeting CDK3, which may be a potential therapeutic approach for TamR breast cancer therapy.—Zheng, L., Meng, X., Li, X., Zhang, Y., Li, C., Xiang, C., Xing, Y., Xia, Y., Xi, T. miR-125a-3p inhibits ERα transactivation and overrides tamoxifen resistance by targeting CDK3 in estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2757457042,"Faithful chromosome segregation in meiosis requires crossover (CO) recombination, which is regulated to ensure at least one CO per homolog pair. We investigate the failure to ensure COs in juvenile male mice. By monitoring recombination genome-wide using cytological assays and at hotspots using molecular assays, we show that juvenile mouse spermatocytes have fewer COs relative to adults. Analysis of recombination in the absence of MLH3 provides evidence for greater utilization in juveniles of pathways involving structure-selective nucleases and alternative complexes, which can act upon precursors to generate noncrossovers (NCOs) at the expense of COs. We propose that some designated CO sites fail to mature efficiently in juveniles owing to inappropriate activity of these alternative repair pathways, leading to chromosome mis-segregation. We also find lower MutLγ focus density in juvenile human spermatocytes, suggesting that weaker CO maturation efficiency may explain why younger men have a higher risk of fathering children with Down syndrome."

Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase that regulates cell growth, metabolism, and survival. We have shown previously that mTOR activity is increased in response to myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury. However, whether Trx1 interacts with mTOR to preserve heart function remains unknown. Using a substrate-trapping mutant of Trx1 (Trx1C35S), we show here that mTOR is a direct interacting partner of Trx1 in the heart. In response to H2O2 treatment in cardiomyocytes, mTOR exhibited a high molecular weight shift in non-reducing SDS-PAGE in a 2-mercaptoethanol-sensitive manner, suggesting that mTOR is oxidized and forms disulfide bonds with itself or other proteins. The mTOR oxidation was accompanied by reduced phosphorylation of endogenous substrates, such as S6 kinase (S6K) and 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) in cardiomyocytes. Immune complex kinase assays disclosed that H2O2 treatment diminished mTOR kinase activity, indicating that mTOR is inhibited by oxidation. Of note, Trx1 overexpression attenuated both H2O2-mediated mTOR oxidation and inhibition, whereas Trx1 knockdown increased mTOR oxidation and inhibition. Moreover, Trx1 normalized H2O2-induced down-regulation of metabolic genes and stimulation of cell death, and an mTOR inhibitor abolished Trx1-mediated rescue of gene expression. H2O2-induced oxidation and inhibition of mTOR were attenuated when Cys-1483 of mTOR was mutated to phenylalanine.

https://openalex.org/W2759011794,"Exogenous fatty acids provide substrates for energy production and biogenesis of the cytoplasmic membrane, but they also enhance cellular signaling during cancer cell proliferation. However, it remains controversial whether dietary fatty acids are correlated with tumor progression. In this study, we demonstrate that increased Src kinase activity is associated with high-fat diet–accelerated progression of prostate tumors and that Src kinases mediate this pathological process. Moreover, in the in vivo prostate regeneration assay, host SCID mice carrying Src(Y529F)-transduced regeneration tissues were fed a low-fat diet or a high-fat diet and treated with vehicle or dasatinib. The high-fat diet not only accelerated Src-induced prostate tumorigenesis in mice but also compromised the inhibitory effect of the anticancer drug dasatinib on Src kinase oncogenic potential in vivo. We further show that myristoylation of Src kinase is essential to facilitate Src-induced and high-fat diet–accelerated tumor progression. Mechanistically, metabolism of exogenous myristic acid increased the biosynthesis of myristoyl CoA and myristoylated Src and promoted Src kinase–mediated oncogenic signaling in human cells. Of the fatty acids tested, only exogenous myristic acid contributed to increased intracellular myristoyl CoA levels. Our results suggest that targeting Src kinase myristoylation, which is required for Src kinase association at the cellular membrane, blocks dietary fat–accelerated tumorigenesis in vivo. Our findings uncover the molecular basis of how the metabolism of myristic acid stimulates high-fat diet–mediated prostate tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2759162449,"Accurate inference of relatedness between individuals in breeding population contributes to the precision of genetic parameter estimates, effectiveness of inbreeding management and the amount of genetic progress delivered from breeding programs. Pedigree reconstruction has been proven to be an efficient tool to correct pedigree errors and recover hidden relatedness in open pollinated progeny tests but the method can be limited by the lack of parental genotypes and the high proportion of alien pollen from outside the breeding population. Our study investigates the efficiency of sib-ship reconstruction in an advanced breeding population of Eucalyptus nitens with only partially tracked pedigree. The sib-ship reconstruction allowed the identification of selfs (4% of the sample) and the exploration of their potential effect on inbreeding depression in the traits studied. We detected signs of inbreeding depression in diameter at breast height and growth strain while no indications were observed in wood density, wood stiffness and tangential air-dry shrinkage. After the application of a corrected sib-ship relationship matrix, additive genetic variance and heritability were observed to increase where signs of inbreeding depression were initially detected. Conversely, the same genetic parameters for traits that appeared to be free of inbreeding depression decreased in size. It therefore appeared that greater genetic variance may be due, at least in part, to contributions from inbreeding in these studied populations rather than a removal of inbreeding as is traditionally thought."
https://openalex.org/W2758622699,"Skeletal muscle atrophy due to excessive protein degradation is the main cause for muscle dysfunction, fatigue, and weakening of athletic ability. Endurance exercise is effective to attenuate muscle atrophy, but the underlying mechanism has not been fully investigated. α-Ketoglutarate (AKG) is a key intermediate of tricarboxylic acid cycle, which is generated during endurance exercise. Here, we demonstrated that AKG effectively attenuated corticosterone-induced protein degradation and rescued the muscle atrophy and dysfunction in a Duchenne muscular dystrophy mouse model. Interestingly, AKG also inhibited the expression of proline hydroxylase 3 (PHD3), one of the important oxidoreductases expressed under hypoxic conditions. Subsequently, we identified the β2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) as a downstream target for PHD3. We found AKG inhibited PHD3/ADRB2 interaction and therefore increased the stability of ADRB2. In addition, combining pharmacologic and genetic approaches, we showed that AKG rescues skeletal muscle atrophy and protein degradation through a PHD3/ADRB2 mediated mechanism. Taken together, these data reveal a mechanism for inhibitory effects of AKG on muscle atrophy and protein degradation. These findings not only provide a molecular basis for the potential use of exercise-generated metabolite AKG in muscle atrophy treatment, but also identify PHD3 as a potential target for the development of therapies for muscle wasting.-Cai, X., Yuan, Y., Liao, Z., Xing, K., Zhu, C., Xu, Y., Yu, L., Wang, L., Wang, S., Zhu, X., Gao, P., Zhang, Y., Jiang, Q., Xu, P., Shu, G. α-Ketoglutarate prevents skeletal muscle protein degradation and muscle atrophy through PHD3/ADRB2 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2756946297,"To better understand biophysical mechanisms of mechanosensory processing, we investigated two cell types in the Drosophila brain (A2 and B1 cells) that are postsynaptic to antennal vibration receptors. A2 cells receive excitatory synaptic currents in response to both directions of movement: thus, twice per vibration cycle. The membrane acts as a low-pass filter, so that voltage and spiking mainly track the vibration envelope rather than individual cycles. By contrast, B1 cells are excited by only forward or backward movement, meaning they are sensitive to vibration phase. They receive oscillatory synaptic currents at the stimulus frequency, and they bandpass filter these inputs to favor specific frequencies. Different cells prefer different frequencies, due to differences in their voltage-gated conductances. Both Na+ and K+ conductances suppress low-frequency synaptic inputs, so cells with larger voltage-gated conductances prefer higher frequencies. These results illustrate how membrane properties and voltage-gated conductances can extract distinct stimulus features into parallel channels."
https://openalex.org/W2759543907,"Many biological processes, including cell division, growth, and motility, rely on rapid remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and on actin filament severing by the regulatory protein cofilin. Phosphorylation of vertebrate cofilin at Ser-3 regulates both actin binding and severing. Substitution of serine with aspartate at position 3 (S3D) is widely used to mimic cofilin phosphorylation in cells and in vitro The S3D substitution weakens cofilin binding to filaments, and it is presumed that subsequent reduction in cofilin occupancy inhibits filament severing, but this hypothesis has remained untested. Here, using time-resolved phosphorescence anisotropy, electron cryomicroscopy, and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we show that S3D cofilin indeed binds filaments with lower affinity, but also with a higher cooperativity than wild-type cofilin, and severs actin weakly across a broad range of occupancies. We found that three factors contribute to the severing deficiency of S3D cofilin. First, the high cooperativity of S3D cofilin generates fewer boundaries between bare and decorated actin segments where severing occurs preferentially. Second, S3D cofilin only weakly alters filament bending and twisting dynamics and therefore does not introduce the mechanical discontinuities required for efficient filament severing at boundaries. Third, Ser-3 modification (i.e. substitution with Asp or phosphorylation) undocks and repositions the cofilin N terminus away from the filament axis, which compromises S3D cofilin's ability to weaken longitudinal filament subunit interactions. Collectively, our results demonstrate that, in addition to inhibiting actin binding, Ser-3 modification favors formation of a cofilin-binding mode that is unable to sufficiently alter filament mechanical properties and promote severing."

We found that CK2 interacts with Brg1, and mutation of putative phosphorylation sites to non-phosphorylatable (Ser to Ala, SA) or phosphomimetic residues (Ser to Glu, SE) reduced Brg1 phosphorylation by CK2. Although BRG1-deleted myoblasts that ectopically express the SA-Brg1 mutant proliferated similarly to the parental cells or cells ectopically expressing wild-type (WT) Brg1, ectopic expression of the SE-Brg1 mutant reduced proliferation and increased cell death, similar to observations from cells lacking Brg1.

Here we analyzed the roles of translesion synthesis (TLS) Pols in the replication of 3-MeA-damaged DNA in human cells. Because 3-MeA has a short half-life in vitro, we used the stable 3-deaza analog, 3-deaza-3-methyladenine (3-dMeA), which blocks the DNA minor groove similarly to 3-MeA. We found that replication through the 3-dMeA adduct is mediated via three different pathways, dependent upon Polι/Polκ, Polθ, and Polζ.

In the Polθ pathway, Polθ carries out both the insertion and extension steps of TLS opposite 3-dMeA, and in the Polζ pathway, Polζ extends synthesis following nt insertion by an as yet unidentified Pol.

U.S.A. 1981; 78: 856-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). 3-MeA is highly cytotoxic because it blocks DNA synthesis by the replicative DNA polymerases (4Sedgwick B. Bates P.A. Paik J. Jacobs S.C. Lindahl T. Repair of alkylated DNA: recent advances.DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Structural studies with the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase (Pol) δ, the major eukaryotic replicative Pol, have shown that a number of residues in its active site interact with bases in the DNA minor groove, such that a mispaired base can be sensed up to 4 bases away from the primer terminus (5Swan M.K. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Aggarwal A.K. Structural basis of high-fidelity DNA synthesis by yeast DNA polymerase δ.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 979-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Thus, an infringement of the minor groove at the N3 position of a purine would be highly blocking to replication by Polδ, necessitating the requirement of translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA Pols for inserting a nucleotide (nt) opposite 3-MeA and then extending synthesis from the inserted nt for a distance of at least 4–5 nts before Polδ could take over. N3-methyladenine 3-deaza-3-methyladenine polymerase translesion synthesis nucleotide kanamycin. Among the human TLS Pols, Pols η, ι, κ, and Rev1, Polι is most suited to incorporate a nt opposite lesions that protrude into the minor groove. The active site of Polι is much narrower than that of other TLS Pols; consequently, the purine template A or G is pushed into the syn conformation by the incoming nt, and two hydrogen bonds are formed between the Hoogsteen edge of the purine template and the Watson-Crick edge of the incoming nt (6Nair D.T.

An incoming nucleotide imposes an anti to syn conformational change on the templating purine in the human DNA polymerase-ι active site.Structure. 2006; 14: 749-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Because the adoption of a syn conformation by 3-MeA would move this minor groove lesion into the more spacious major groove, Polι could incorporate the correct nt T opposite 3-MeA by Hoogsteen base pairing. Structural studies with Polκ have indicated that its active site can accommodate lesions that protrude into the minor groove at the template-primer junction, whereby it could proficiently extend synthesis from the 3-MeA·T base pair at the template-primer junction (9Lone S. Townson S.A. Uljon S.N. Johnson R.E. Brahma A. Nair D.T. Prakash L. Prakash S. Aggarwal A.K. Human DNA polymerase κ encircles DNA: implications for mismatch extension and lesion bypass.Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 601-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Thus, proficient and error-free replication through the 3-MeA lesion could be performed by the sequential action of Pols ι and κ. To analyze the genetic control of TLS through 3-MeA in human cells, we used the stable 3-deaza analog of this adduct, 3-dMeA. We show that TLS through this adduct occurs via three different pathways. As expected from structural studies, we provide evidence that Pols ι and κ function together in mediating TLS through this lesion. In addition, we find that Polθ and Polζ are also required and they mediate replication through this lesion via two independent pathways. Even though Pols ι and θ incorporate nts opposite 3-dMeA with a low fidelity, replication through the lesion occurs in an error-free manner in human cells. We discuss the implications of these and other observations for the role of TLS in promoting proficient and predominantly error-free replication through DNA lesions in human cells. 3-dMeA was incorporated in the lacZ target sequence in the leading strand (Fig. 1A) and the schematic of siRNA depletions and the various steps for the analyses of TLS frequency and for mutation analyses is shown in Fig. 1B. In the plasmid system, TLS through the lesion generates Kan+ blue colonies and the frequency of Kan+ blue colonies among the total Kan+ colonies gives a very reliable and highly repeatable estimate of TLS frequency. To identify the TLS pols required for replicating through the 3-dMeA lesion, we examined the effects of siRNA depletion of various TLS Pols, including Pols ι, κ, θ, and ζ. For all the TLS Pols analyzed, we ascertained that siRNA treatment led to a highly efficient depletion of the intended protein similar to that shown previously (10Yoon J.H. Park J. Conde J.

The TLS data we obtained from independent TLS assays in human cells are highly reproducible as evidenced from the high repeatability of data for TLS opposite UV-induced lesions, cis-syn TT dimer, and the (6–4)-TT photoproduct reported in different studies (10Yoon J.H. Park J. Conde J. Wakamiya M. Prakash L. Prakash S.

TLS opposite 3-dMeA in normal human fibroblasts treated with control (NC) siRNA occurs with a frequency of ∼46% (Table 1), and the TLS frequency remains the same in Polη-depleted cells indicating that Polη is not required. By contrast, TLS frequency is reduced to ∼27% in Polι- or Polκ-depleted cells. To determine whether Pols ι and κ function together or independently, we examined the effects of their simultaneous depletion on TLS frequency. Our observation that their simultaneous depletion causes no further reduction in TLS frequency than that conferred by their individual depletion indicates that they function together in mediating replication through the 3-dMeA lesion. Depletion of Polθ or the Rev3 catalytic or Rev7 accessory subunit of Polζ also led to a reduction in TLS frequency to ∼25%. To determine whether Polθ and Polζ function together in one TLS pathway or whether they constitute independent pathways, we examined the effects of their co-depletion on TLS frequency. Our results that TLS frequency is reduced to ∼13% upon the simultaneous depletion of Pols θ and ζ indicate that these Pols act independently.Table 1Effects of siRNA knockdowns of TLS polymerases on the replicative bypass of 3-dMeA carried on the leading strand template in human fibroblastssiRNANo. Kan+ coloniesNo. blue colonies among Kan+TLS%NC44620646.2Polη35816145.0Polι3269027.6Polκ2687226.9Polι + Polκ3859424.4Polθ41510525.3Rev342710825.3Rev73057825.6Polθ + Rev34055212.8Polι + Polθ3064314.1Polκ + Polθ3484713.5Polι + Rev33504813.7Polι + Rev72954214.2Polκ + Rev34085212.7 Open table in a new tab Our genetic results suggested that replication through 3-dMeA is mediated via three independent pathways in which Pols ι and κ function together in one pathway and Polθ and Polζ function in two additional pathways. To verify this inference, we determined whether simultaneous depletion of Polι or Polκ together with Polθ or with Polζ leads to a further reduction in TLS frequency. In accord with this inference, co-depletion of Polι or Polκ with Polθ confers a reduction in TLS frequency to ∼14%, and a similar reduction in TLS frequency occurs upon the simultaneous depletion of Polι or Polκ with Polζ (Table 1). Thus, TLS opposite 3-dMeA occurs via three independent Polι/κ, Polθ, and Polζ pathways (Fig. 2), and each of these pathways contributes about equally to the replication of 3-deMeA-damaged DNA. Rev1 specifically incorporates a C opposite template G (14Prakash S. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Eukaryotic translesion synthesis DNA polymerases: specificity of structure and function.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 317-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). In the Rev1 active site, G does not form a base pair with the incoming C; instead, template G is pushed out into a solvent-filled cavity and a conserved Arg residue in Rev1 then pairs with the incoming C (15Nair D.T. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Aggarwal A.K. Rev1 employs a novel mechanism of DNA synthesis using a protein template.Science. 2005; 309: 2219-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 16Swan M.K. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Aggarwal A.K. Structure of the human REV1-DNA-dNTP ternary complex.J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 390: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, Rev1 DNA polymerase activity is specifically adapted to insert a C opposite N2-dG DNA adducts and would play no role in TLS opposite 3-dMeA. However, in mammalian cells, Rev1 also plays an indispensable role as a scaffolding component of Y-family Pols η, ι, and κ (10Yoon J.H. Park J. Conde J. Wakamiya M. Prakash L. Prakash S. Rev1 promotes replication through UV lesions in conjunction with DNA polymerases η, ι, and κ but not DNA polymerase ζ.Genes Dev. 2015; 29: 2588-2602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, even though the Rev1 catalytic activity would play no role in TLS opposite 3-dMeA, its scaffolding role would be required for TLS mediated by the Polι/Polκ pathway but not for TLS mediated by the Polθ or Polζ pathways. To confirm this, we examined the effects of co-depletion of Rev1 with Polι, Polκ, Polθ, or Polζ. As shown in Table 2, Rev1 depletion reduces the TLS frequency to ∼23%, and this frequency remained the same upon co-depletion of Rev1 with Polι or Polκ. By contrast, simultaneous depletion of Rev1 with Polθ or Rev3 reduced TLS frequency to ∼12%. The epistasis of Rev1 with Polι or Polκ and the reduction in TLS frequency upon co-depletion of Rev1 with Polθ or Polζ is consistent with the requirement of Rev1 for Polι/Polκ-dependent TLS but not for TLS mediated by Polθ or Polζ.Table 2Effect of siRNA knockdowns of Rev1 in combination with other TLS Pols on the replicative bypass of 3-dMeA carried on the leading strand template in human fibroblastssiRNANo. Kan+ coloniesNo. blue colonies among Kan+TLS%NC41219046.1Rev14089623.5Rev1 + Poι3719024.3Rev1 + Polκ4159522.9Rev1 + Polθ4025112.7Rev1 + Rev33904812.3 Open table in a new tab Sequence analyses of TLS products from cells treated with control siRNA revealed no mutational events, and we also found no evidence of mutational events among the TLS products obtained from Polι-, Rev1-, Polθ-, or Polζ-depleted cells (Table 3).

Using steady-state kinetic analyses, we determined the catalytic efficiency and fidelity of Polι for nt insertion opposite undamaged A versus 3-dMeA. As shown in Table 4, Polι inserts a T nt opposite an undamaged A with over 1000-fold higher catalytic efficiency than an incorrect nt. However, compared with the incorporation of a T opposite undamaged A, T is incorporated opposite 3-dMeA with an ∼8-fold lower efficiency. Moreover, compared with the efficiency for T incorporation opposite 3-dMeA, the efficiency for incorporating the incorrect nt A or G opposite 3-dMeA is reduced by only ∼25–30-fold, and the efficiency for incorporating a C is reduced by ∼90-fold. Thus, the catalytic efficiency of Polι for incorporating the correct nt opposite 3-dMeA is reduced and the efficiency for incorporating an incorrect nt is enhanced. As determined by steady-state kinetic analyses, Polκ extends synthesis from the 3-dMeA:T base pair by incorporating dATP opposite the next 5′ template base with an ∼10-fold reduced efficiency compared with that for the undamaged A:T base pair (Table 5).Table 4Steady-state kinetic analyses of nucleotide incorporation opposite undamaged A or 3-dMeA by human PolιTemplate nucleotideIncoming nucleotidekcatKmkcat/KmCatalytic efficiency relative to Tmin−1μmT10.7 ± 0.65.3 ± 0.921AA0.54 ± 0.02220 ± 38.40.0021 × 10−3 (↓ 1000 × )G0.48 ± 0.04332 ± 700.00147 × 10−4 (↓ 1428 × )CNDNDT3.2 ± 0.0912.4 ± 1.20.2513-dMeAA1.5 ± 0.22192 ± 960.00783.1 × 10−2 (↓ 32 × )G0.62 ± 0.0259 ± 12.00.014 × 10−2 (↓ 25 × )C0.37 ± 0.02131.6 ± 290.00281.1 × 10−2 (↓ 89 × ) Open table in a new tab Table 5Kinetic parameters of extension reaction catalyzed by human Polκ from A:T or 3-dMeA:T base pairPrimer:template base pairdNTP addedkcatKmkcat/KmRelative catalytic efficiencymin−1μmA:TdATP56.8 ± 2.40.5 ± 0.02113.613-dMeA:TdATP14 ± 0.51.46 ± 0.110.311 ↓ Open table in a new tab Polθ primarily incorporates a T opposite 3-dMeA; however, it incorporates an A also, albeit not as well, and in the presence of 4 dNTPs, Polθ replicates DNA through the 3-dMeA lesion (Fig. 4).

Moreover, compared with the efficiency for T incorporation opposite 3-dMeA, Polθ incorporates an A opposite this lesion with only an ∼10-fold reduction in efficiency, a G with an ∼30-fold reduction in efficiency, and a C with an ∼120-fold reduction in efficiency (Table 6). Thus, the catalytic efficiency and fidelity of Polθ for incorporating the correct nt opposite 3-dMeA is greatly reduced.

We find that the proficiency of Polζ for extension of synthesis from the 3-dMeA:T base pair is reduced ∼30-fold compared with that for extending the undamaged A:T base pair (Table 8). Because Polζ exhibits poor proficiency for inserting nts opposite DNA lesions, we presume that another as yet unidentified TLS Pol inserts nts opposite 3-dMeA from which Polζ then extends synthesis.Table 8Kinetic parameters of extension reaction catalyzed by yeast Polζ from A:T or 3-dMeA:T base pairPrimer:template base pairdNTP addedkcatKmkcat/KmRelative catalytic efficiencymin−1μmA:TdATP0.5 ± 0.0120.04 ± 0.00512.513-dMeA:TdATP0.7 ± 0.071.7 ± 0.640.4133 ↓ Open table in a new tab Our results indicating that TLS in normal human fibroblasts accounts for almost 50% lesion bypass strongly suggest that TLS provides a primary means for replicating through this DNA lesion. Because the 3-dMeA lesion could have been removed from the plasmid by the 3-alkyladenine DNA glycosylase (22Shrivastav N. Li D. Essigmann J.M. Chemical biology of mutagenesis and DNA repair: cellular responses to DNA alkyaltion.Carcinogenesis. 2010; 31: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), or by nucleotide excision repair, and because removal of the lesion by these repair processes will generate Kan+ white colonies, the proportion of Kan+ blue colonies, indicative of TLS, will be correspondingly reduced. Thus, the TLS frequency in excision repair proficient cells underestimates the frequency with which TLS actually occurs. The high frequency of TLS in repair proficient cells supports the premise that TLS provides the primary mechanism for replicating through the 3-dMeA lesion and that alternative lesion bypass mechanisms such as filling-in of the gap opposite the lesion site by template switching play a much less significant and subsidiary role. TLS also plays a prominent role in promoting replication through other DNA lesions such as UV induced cis-syn TT dimer (12Yoon J.-H. Prakash L. Prakash S.

In the absence of structural information, it is unclear whether Polθ pushes the 3-dMeA lesion into a syn conformation for forming a Hoogsteen base pair with the incoming dTTP and then it extends synthesis from the 3-dMeA:T Hoogsteen base pair; or whether the minor groove disruption by 3-dMeA presents no steric hindrance to the Polθ active site; consequently, it forms a 3-dMeA:T Watson-Crick (W-C) base pair and then extends synthesis from the W-C base pair. For the Polζ-dependent pathway, we expect Polζ to extend synthesis from the T nt inserted opposite 3-dMeA by a DNA polymerase whose identity remains to be determined. However, the possibility that human Polζ can insert a nt opposite 3-dMeA as well as extend synthesis from the inserted nt cannot be entirely excluded at this point. Sequence analysis of TLS products has indicated that all three pathways dependent upon Polι/Polκ, Polθ, and Polζ, respectively, conduct TLS opposite 3-dMeA in an error-free manner. In striking contrast to the lack of mutational TLS products in human cells, in vitro biochemical studies have indicated that TLS Pols synthesize DNA opposite 3-dMeA with a low fidelity. Thus, whereas Polι incorporates a T opposite undamaged A with a 1000-fold or even higher catalytic efficiency than an incorrect nt, it incorporates a T opposite 3-dMeA with a reduced efficiency than opposite undamaged A and the catalytic efficiency for inserting the incorrect nt opposite 3-dMeA is enhanced. For Polθ, the proficiency for incorporating a T opposite 3-dMeA is greatly reduced compared with that opposite undamaged A, and the catalytic efficiency of Polθ for inserting an incorrect nt opposite 3-dMeA is increased. The striking discrepancy between the low fidelity of DNA synthesis by Polι or Polθ opposite 3-dMeA observed in in vitro biochemical studies versus the high fidelity of TLS opposite this lesion observed in human cells strongly suggests that the fidelity of TLS Pols is tightly regulated during replication through this DNA lesion in human cells. We have previously noted that TLS opposite DNA lesions such as cis-syn TT dimer (12Yoon J.-H. Prakash L. Prakash S.

This accumulating evidence reinforces the notion that the catalytic efficiency and fidelity of TLS Pols opposite DNA lesions are regulated such that replication through DNA lesions occurs in a predominantly error-free manner in human cells. Since the half-life of 3-MeA in vitro has been established to be between 12 and 24 h (3Singer B. Brent T.P. Human lymphoblasts contain DNA glycosylase activity excising N-3 and N-7-methyl and ethyl purines but not O6-alkylguanines.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

To circumvent this problem, a stable 3-deaza analog of the nucleoside 3′-methyl-2′-deoxyadenosine was incorporated into oligos as 3-dMeA. 3-dMeA projects into the DNA minor groove and blocks synthesis by replicative Pols. Hence, for all the genetic and biochemical studies, we used 3-dMeA lesion-containing DNAs. 3-Deaza-3-methyldeoxyadenosine oligonucleotides were synthesized on a Model 8909 Expedite DNA synthesizer using standard DNA synthesis chemistry. The 3-deaza-3-methyl-deoxyadenosine was incorporated using an offline coupling mode for incorporation of the 3-deaza-3-Me-dA-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite (purchased from Berry and Associates, Inc., Dexter, MI 48130). The oligos were deprotected using standard concentrated ammonia deprotection, and purified and analyzed by reverse phase HPLC on a Beckman System Gold HPLC. Oligonucleotides were additionally analyzed and confirmed by MALDI-MS on a Bruker Autoflex MALDI mass spectrophotometer. The in-frame target sequence of the lacz′ gene containing 3-dMeA is shown in Fig. 1A. Because the lacz′ sequence in the 3-dMeA-containing DNA strand is in-frame, it encodes functional β-galactosidase (β-gal); the opposite DNA strand harbors an SpeI restriction site containing a +1 frameshift, which makes it non-functional for β-gal. The 3-dMeA-containing strand carries the kanamycin gene (Kan+), whereas the other DNA strand has the kan− gene (Fig. 1A). The detailed methods for the construction of lesion-containing SV40-based duplex plasmids have been published previously (12Yoon J.-H. Prakash L. Prakash S.

The schematic of TLS assay is shown in Fig. 1B and the detailed methods for TLS assays have been published previously (12Yoon J.-H. Prakash L. Prakash S.

Briefly, human fibroblast GM637 cells were transfected with the particular siRNA and after 48 h of incubation, the target vector DNA and siRNA (second transfection) were co-transfected. After 30 h of incubation, plasmid DNA was transfected into Escherichia coli XL1-Blue super competent cells (Stratagene) and cells plated on LB/kan plates containing isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (GenDEPOT) and 100 μg/ml of X-gal (GenDEPOT). TLS frequency is determined from the number of blue colonies among total colonies growing on LB/Kan plates and mutation frequencies and mutational changes were analyzed by DNA sequencing. DNA substrates consisted of a radiolabeled oligonucleotide primer annealed to a 75-nt oligonucleotide DNA template by heating a mixture of primer/template at a 1:1.5 molar ratio to 95 °C and allowing it to cool to room temperature for several hours. The template 75-mer oligonucleotide contained the sequence 5′-AGC AAG TCA CCA ATG TCT AAG AGT TCG TAT AAT GCC TAC ACT GGA GTA CCG GAG CAT CGT CGT GAC TGG GAA AAC-3′ and it contained an undamaged A or 3-dMeA at the underlined position. For examining the incorporation of dATP, dTTP, dCTP, or dGTP nucleotides individually, or of all 4 dNTPs, a 44-mer primer 5′-GTT TTC CCA GTC ACG ACG ATG CTC CGG TAC TCC AGT GTA GGC AT-3′ was annealed to the above 75-mer template. The standard DNA polymerase reaction (5 μl) contained 25 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml of BSA, 10% glycerol, 10 nm DNA substrate, and 0.2 nm Polι or 1 nm Polθ. For nucleotide incorporation assays, 50 or 25 μm dATP, dTTP, dCTP, or dGTP (Roche Biochemicals) were used for Polι and Polθ, respectively, and for examining synthesis through the 3-dMeA lesion, 50 or 25 μm each of all 4 dNTPs were used for Polι and Polθ, respectively. Reactions were carried out for 10 min at 37 °C. Reaction products were resolved on a 12% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea and analyzed by a PhosphorImager. Steady-state kinetic analyses for deoxynucleotide incorporation were performed as described (25Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Yeast and human translesion DNA synthesis polymerases: expression, purification, and biochemical characterization.Methods Enzymol. 2006; 408: 390-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Gel band intensities of the substrate and products of the deoxynucleotide incorporation reactions were quantified using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The observed rate of deoxynucleotide incorporation, vobs, was determined by dividing the amount of product formed by the reaction time and protein concentration. The vobs was graphed as a function of the deoxynucleotide concentration, and the data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation describing a hyperbola: vobs = (kcat[E] × [dNTP])/(Km + [dNTP]). From the best fit curve, the apparent Km and kcat steady-state kinetics parameter were obtained for the incorporation of dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP and the efficiencies of the nucleotide incorporation (kcat/Km) were determined.

We used long-term field experiments to explore how the leaf, stem and root carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) concentrations and their stoichiometry changed with growth and stand age in a L. principis-rupprechtii Mayr. plantation from 2012–2015 in the Qinling Mountains, China. Our results showed that the C, N and P concentrations and stoichiometric ratios in different tissues of larch stands were affected by stand age, organ type and sampling month and displayed multiple correlations with increased stand age in different growing seasons. Generally, leaf C and N concentrations were greatest in the fast-growing season, but leaf P concentrations were greatest in the early growing season. However, no clear seasonal tendencies in the stem and root C, N and P concentrations were observed with growth. In contrast to N and P, few differences were found in organ-specific C concentrations. Leaf N:P was greatest in the fast-growing season, while C:N and C:P were greatest in the late-growing season. No clear variations were observed in stem and root C:N, C:P and N:P throughout the entire growing season, but leaf N:P was less than 14, suggesting that the growth of larch stands was limited by N in our study region. Compared to global plant element concentrations and stoichiometry, the leaves of larch stands had higher C, P, C:N and C:P but lower N and N:P, and the roots had greater P and C:N but lower N, C:P and N:P. Our study provides baseline information for describing the changes in nutritional elements with plant growth, which will facilitates plantation forest management and restoration, and makes a valuable contribution to the global data pool on leaf nutrition and stoichiometry."
https://openalex.org/W2757183309,"p97 is an essential ATPase associated with various cellular activities (AAA+) that functions as a segregase in diverse cellular processes, including the maintenance of proteostasis. p97 interacts with different cofactors that target it to distinct pathways; an important example is the deubiquitinase ataxin3, which collaborates with p97 in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation. However, the molecular details of this interaction have been unclear. Here, we characterized the binding of ataxin3 to p97, showing that ataxin3 binds with low-micromolar affinity to both wild-type p97 and mutants linked to degenerative disorders known as multisystem proteinopathy 1 (MSP1); we further showed that the stoichiometry of binding is one ataxin3 molecule per p97 hexamer. We mapped the binding determinants on each protein, demonstrating that ataxin3’s p97/VCP-binding motif interacts with the inter-lobe cleft in the N-domain of p97. We also probed the nucleotide dependence of this interaction, confirming that ataxin3 and p97 associate in the presence of ATP and in the absence of nucleotide, but not in the presence of ADP. Our experiments suggest that an ADP-driven downward movement of the p97 N-terminal domain dislodges ataxin3 by inducing a steric clash between the D1-domain and ataxin3’s C terminus. In contrast, MSP1 mutants of p97 bind ataxin3 irrespective of their nucleotide state, indicating a failure by these mutants to translate ADP binding into a movement of the N-terminal domain. Our model provides a mechanistic explanation for how nucleotides regulate the p97–ataxin3 interaction and why atypical cofactor binding is observed with MSP1 mutants. p97 is an essential ATPase associated with various cellular activities (AAA+) that functions as a segregase in diverse cellular processes, including the maintenance of proteostasis. p97 interacts with different cofactors that target it to distinct pathways; an important example is the deubiquitinase ataxin3, which collaborates with p97 in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation.

Involvement of p97 in diverse cellular processes is coordinated by a multitude of cofactors that regulate its activity. These cofactors are roughly categorized into substrate recruiters, which direct p97 to specific pathways, and substrate processors, which are typically enzymes that fine-tune p97 function (31Jentsch S.

The assembly of p97–cofactor complexes drives the subcellular localization of p97, its specificity for substrates, and the ultimate fate of these substrates (32Buchberger A. Schindelin H. Hänzelmann P. Control of p97 function by cofactor binding.FEBS Lett. 2015; 589: 2578-2589Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). An important substrate-processing cofactor is ataxin3, a member of the Machado-Joseph disease class of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) (33Li X. Liu H. Fischhaber P.L. Tang T.S.

Cell. 2005; 18: 37-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In particular, ataxin3 collaborates with p97 in the process of ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (44Liu Y. Ye Y. Roles of p97-associated deubiquitinases in protein quality control at the endoplasmic reticulum.Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2012; 13: 436-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), in which proteins that are misfolded or otherwise marked for destruction are removed from the ER and targeted to proteasomes. In addition, ataxin3 and p97 cooperate outside ERAD in other processes involving protein degradation, such as the control of protein levels involved in the DNA damage response (45Ackermann L.

For example, ataxin3 knock-out animals feature increased levels of polyubiquitinated proteins and increased levels of the stress response (46Schmitt I. Linden M. Khazneh H. Evert B.O. Breuer P.

The p97–ataxin3 interaction was first observed via immunoprecipitation from cell extracts (24Boeddrich A. Gaumer S. Haacke A. Tzvetkov N. Albrecht M. Evert B.O. Müller E.C. Lurz R. Breuer P.

Pittman R.N. Ataxin-3 binds VCP/p97 and regulates retrotranslocation of ERAD substrates.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 2409-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Overexpression of a catalytically-inactive form of ataxin3 strongly inhibits the processing of ERAD substrates, whereas overexpression of the wild-type enzyme has a less pronounced but still inhibitory effect, possibly due to a dominant-negative effect (36Wang Q.

The functionality of this interaction has been demonstrated in worms, where p97 and ataxin3 operate synergistically to promote degradation of key substrates (57Kuhlbrodt K. Janiesch P.C. Kevei É.

The p97–ataxin3 interaction is perturbed by mutations in p97 associated with MSP-1, as significantly elevated amounts of ataxin3 are associated with the mutant p97, as compared with wild-type protein (58Fernández-Sáiz V. Buchberger A. Imbalances in p97 co-factor interactions in human proteinopathy.EMBO Rep. 2010; 11: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The molecular details of how p97 interacts with cofactors such as ataxin3 are only now being elucidated. It is becoming clear that different cofactors assemble into complexes with differing stoichiometries (59Pye V.E. Beuron F. Keetch C.A. McKeown C. Robinson C.V. Meyer H.H. Zhang X. Freemont P.S.

It is also apparent that cofactor binding is influenced by major conformational changes within p97, which are driven by nucleotide binding and hydrolysis (3Banerjee S. Bartesaghi A. Merk A. Rao P.

Most p97 cofactors interact with the protein’s N-domain (64Yeung H.O. Kloppsteck P. Niwa H. Isaacson R.L. Matthews S. Zhang X. Freemont P.S. Insights into adaptor binding to the AAA protein p97.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2008; 36: 62-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), which is significant because the N-domain can undergo large “up-down” motions relative to the D1 ring (3Banerjee S. Bartesaghi A.

These conformational changes are largely induced by the nucleotide bound in the D1-domain, with ATP favoring the “up” position, whereas ADP induces a “down” position. The up-down equilibrium is disrupted in MSP1 mutants (65Tang W.K. Li D. Li C.C. Esser L. Dai R. Guo L. Xia D.

In cells, sensing of increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) activates many defensive mechanisms that limit or repair damage to cell components. The ROS-signaling responses necessary for cell survival under oxidative stress conditions remain incompletely understood, especially for the translational machinery. Here, we found that drug treatments or a genetic deficiency in the thioredoxin system that increase levels of endogenous hydrogen peroxide in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae promote site-specific endonucleolytic cleavage in 25S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) adjacent to the c loop of the expansion segment 7 (ES7), a putative regulatory region located on the surface of the 60S ribosomal subunit. Our data also show that ES7c is cleaved at early stages of the gene expression program that enables cells to successfully counteract oxidative stress and is not a prerequisite or consequence of apoptosis. Moreover, the 60S subunits containing ES7c-cleaved rRNA cofractionate with intact subunits in sucrose gradients and repopulate polysomes after a short starvation-induced translational block, indicating their active role in translation. These results demonstrate that ES7c cleavage in rRNA is an early and sensitive marker of increased ROS levels in yeast cells and suggest that changes in ribosomes may be involved in the adaptive response to oxidative stress.

Cells of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae regularly encounter stressful conditions in their environment, including fluctuations in temperature, pH, nutrient availability, and exposure to toxic compounds. It is not surprising that these unicellular eukaryotes have evolved a wide range of sophisticated survival mechanisms to combat adverse effects of stress and adapt to new conditions. One of the best-studied environmental stressors is the exposure to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), 2The abbreviations used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciesrRNAribosomal RNAESexpansion segmentUPRunfolded protein responseTmtunicamycinCHXcycloheximideqPCRquantitative PCR. a condition also known as oxidative stress. In addition to extracellular environment, ROS can be also generated from intracellular sources, such as mitochondria and the ER (reviewed in Ref. 1Strich R. Programmed cell death initiation and execution in budding yeast.Genetics. 2015; 200: 1003-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). ROS are highly reactive chemical products that include superoxide anions (O2−.), H2O2, and the hydroxyl radicals (OH•), formed upon incomplete reduction of oxygen. ROS-induced damage to cellular components including DNA, lipids, and proteins contributes to a variety of pathologies and aging (2Cook J.A. Gius D. Wink D.A. Krishna M.C. Russo A. Mitchell J.B.

Mitochondrial dysfunction and type 2 diabetes.Science. 2005; 307: 384-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). To fight deleterious effects of ROS, cells possess an arsenal of enzymatic and non-enzymatic defense systems (4Jamieson D.J. Oxidative stress responses of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Yeast. 1998; 14: 1511-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 5Klaunig J.E. Kamendulis L.M. The role of oxidative stress in carcinogenesis.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2004; 44: 239-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Enzymatic components for scavenging ROS and maintaining the proper redox state include thioredoxin-dependent peroxiredoxins, superoxide dismutases, glutathione peroxidases, and catalases. These enzymes often have specialized functions within the cell that differ by the target substrate on which they act, cellular compartment where they function, mode of expression, and mechanism of catalysis (4Jamieson D.J. Oxidative stress responses of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Yeast. 1998; 14: 1511-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). reactive oxygen species ribosomal RNA expansion segment unfolded protein response tunicamycin cycloheximide quantitative PCR. Aside from causing cell damage, ROS also play roles beneficial for the organism. For example, at low concentration, ROS can provide protection from invading pathogens, participate in tissue repair, and control gene expression (discussed in Ref. 6Bhattacharyya A. Chattopadhyay R. Mitra S. Crowe S.E. Oxidative stress: an essential factor in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal mucosal diseases.Physiol. Rev. 2014; 94: 329-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). Moreover, the accumulated body of evidence indicates that ROS, especially H2O2, can serve as intracellular messengers to regulate various physiological processes (7D'Autréaux B. Toledano M.B. ROS as signalling molecules: mechanisms that generate specificity in ROS homeostasis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 813-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (2481) Google Scholar). At low doses, hydrogen peroxide specifically reacts with sensor molecules in the cell in a process termed redox signaling (8Schieber M. Chandel N.S. ROS function in redox signaling and oxidative stress.Curr. Biol. 2014; 24: R453-R462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3582) Google Scholar). In its role of a signal transducer, H2O2 regulates a range of cellular responses that help cells to adapt to the continuously changing environment (9Marinho H.S. Real C. Cyrne L. Soares H. Antunes F. Hydrogen peroxide sensing, signaling and regulation of transcription factors.Redox Biol. 2014; 2: 535-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Although cellular H2O2-sensing pathways are still not completely understood, one well-characterized mechanism in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes relies on transcription factors that regulate expression of antioxidant genes (9Marinho H.S. Real C. Cyrne L. Soares H. Antunes F. Hydrogen peroxide sensing, signaling and regulation of transcription factors.Redox Biol. 2014; 2: 535-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). For example, H2O2-mediated oxidation promotes formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond between two Cys residues of the yeast transcription factor Yap1 and its cofactor Gpx3 (10Delaunay A.

This interaction results in oxidized Yap1 that retains nuclear localization (12Kuge S. Toda T. Iizuka N. Nomoto A. Crm1 (XpoI) dependent nuclear export of the budding yeast transcription factor yAP-1 is sensitive to oxidative stress.Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and up-regulates transcription of a large number of stress-responsive genes (reviewed in Ref. 13Temple M.D. Perrone G.G. Dawes I.W. Complex cellular responses to reactive oxygen species.Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 319-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Among other proteins identified as H2O2-signal sensors are components of the antioxidant machinery (thioredoxins, peroxiredoxins), glycolytic enzymes, structural proteins (actin, myosin), and protein folding and degradation factors (heat shock proteins and components of the proteasome). Translation, the process of protein synthesis that occurs in every living cell, is affected by elevated levels of ROS on many levels. Multiple studies have described oxidation of protein factors and enzymes involved in the initiation, elongation, and termination of translation (14Doronina V.A. Staniforth G.L. Speldewinde S.H.

Other examples include oxidation of mRNAs resulting in ribosome stalling and production of misfolded proteins prompted to aggregation (21Simms C.L. Hudson B.H. Mosior J.W. Rangwala A.S. Zaher H.S.

The phloem-delivered RNA pool contains small noncoding RNAs and interferes with translation.Plant Physiol. 2009; 150: 378-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), thereby fine-tuning protein synthesis during stress conditions. In contrast to tRNAs, the question of how ROS may affect the abundant ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) has received limited experimental attention. Ribosomal RNAs (25S, 18S, 5.8S, and 5S rRNAs in yeast) constitute the structural and functional core of the ribosome (30Yusupova G. Yusupov M. High-resolution structure of the eukaryotic 80S ribosome.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2014; 83: 467-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and are essential for ribosome function in translation. Previous studies found that high-level oxidative stress capable of inducing cell apoptosis results in extensive fragmentation and subsequent degradation of 25S and 5.8S rRNAs (31Mroczek S. Kufel J. Apoptotic signals induce specific degradation of ribosomal RNA in yeast.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 2874-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, little is known about how these complex macromolecules are affected by disruptions in redox homeostasis that are not accompanied by cell lethality. In this study, we demonstrate that treatment of yeast cells with sublethal doses of oxidants causes cleavage in expansion segment 7 (ES7) of 25S rRNA. ES7 is an rRNA extension that is universally present in eukaryotic ribosomes and predicted to possess a regulatory function (32Gómez Ramos L.M. Smeekens J.M. Kovacs N.A. Bowman J.C. Wartell R.M. Wu R. Williams L.D. Yeast rRNA expansion segments: folding and function.J. Mol. Biol. 2016; 428: 4048-4059Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 33Melnikov S. Ben-Shem A. Garreau de Loubresse N.

Biol. 2012; 19: 560-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), although its precise role remains unknown. Remarkably, our data indicate that ES7 undergoes hydrolysis following even slight perturbations in redox balance. Moreover, ES7c cleavage is not a part of cell death but coincides with early events in the gene expression program that leads to the successful adaptation to oxidative stress. This is the first study to describe a direct involvement of an rRNA molecule in the oxidative stress response. The initial question we were addressing in our studies was how cells deal with ribosomes stalled in translation because of aberrations/misfolding of nascent peptide chains. We subjected cells to various conditions known to cause nascent chain misfolding, including high temperature (38 and 40 °C), treatments with ethanol, aminoglycosides (hygromycin B and G418), and proteotoxic derivatives of proline (l-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid) and arginine (canavanine) (34Zhao Y.

Notably, none of these conditions affected the integrity of rRNAs, as assessed by hybridization analysis of RNA extracted from the stressed cells (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, treatment of cells with DTT, an agent known to reduce cysteine thiols and cause protein misfolding (34Zhao Y. Macgurn J.A. Liu M. Emr S. The ART-Rsp5 ubiquitin ligase network comprises a plasma membrane quality control system that protects yeast cells from proteotoxic stress.eLife. 2013; 2: e00459Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), resulted in the appearance of a distinct rRNA-derived fragment (Fig. 1A) detected with the rRNA-specific probe y540 complementary to the 5′ end of 25S rRNA (Fig. 1B). This effect of DTT was dose-dependent and affected 25S rRNA but not 18S rRNA (Fig. 1A), suggesting that it is specific to the large ribosomal subunit. To investigate the rRNA-destabilizing effect of DTT further, we performed a time course analysis using a strain lacking TSA1, a gene that provides tolerance to DTT exposure (35Rand J.D. Grant C.M. The thioredoxin system protects ribosomes against stress-induced aggregation.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 387-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The tsa1Δ mutant, previously identified in a genetic screen for increased DTT sensitivity, was confirmed to be highly sensitive to this drug (Fig. 1C) and showed increased generation of the 25S rRNA fragment over time (Fig. 1D). Next, we used experimental conditions upon which 25S rRNA was excessively cleaved in tsa1Δ, but not in wild-type cells (2 h of treatment with 20 mm DTT; Fig. 1D) to map the cleavage site in 25S rRNA. First, we hybridized RNA prepared from DTT-treated and untreated wild-type and tsa1Δ cells with radiolabeled 25S rRNA probes y540 and y503 (Fig. 1B). The 5′ rRNA probe y540 detected a 5′ shorter fragment (∼600 bases) of 25S rRNA (Fig. 1, D and E), whereas probe y503, which anneals ∼1500 nucleotides downstream of y540 (Fig. 1B), detected a larger 3′ fragment (∼2.8 kb) in DTT-treated tsa1Δ cells (Fig. 1E). This result indicates that in response to DTT treatment, 25S rRNA undergoes endonucleolytic cleavage in the region located between the y540 and y503 hybridization sites (Fig. 1B). Using primer extensions on 25S rRNA from wild-type and tsa1Δ cells, we detected novel reverse transcriptase stops appearing after 20 mm DTT treatment at positions corresponding to cleavage after nucleotides 610 and 611 (Fig. 1F). This site is located within ES7c (Fig. 1G), one of the largest rRNA extensions present in the eukaryotic ribosome (36Armache J.-P. Jarasch A. Anger A.M. Villa E. Becker T. Bhushan S. Jossinet F.

Comprehensive molecular structure of the eukaryotic ribosome.Structure. 2009; 17: 1591-1604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Hereafter, we will refer to the identified cleavage of 25S rRNA within the ES7 region as “ES7c cleavage.” Although the precise role of ES7 in ribosome function is unknown, structural studies have revealed its high accessibility on the 60S subunit surface and predicted its involvement in recruitment of various protein factors (33Melnikov S. Ben-Shem A. Garreau de Loubresse N. Jenner L. Yusupova G. Yusupov M. One core, two shells: bacterial and eukaryotic ribosomes.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 560-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In support of the structural analysis data, recent in vitro pulldown assays identified 36 proteins that interact with the ES7 region, including aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, protein quality control factors, and chaperones (32Gómez Ramos L.M. Smeekens J.M. Kovacs N.A. Bowman J.C. Wartell R.M. Wu R. Williams L.D. Yeast rRNA expansion segments: folding and function.J. Mol. Biol. 2016; 428: 4048-4059Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), supporting the idea that ES7 functions as a regulatory part in the ribosome. Stability of rRNA in cells subjected to multiple proteotoxic stress conditions (Fig. 1A) indicated that ES7c cleavage was not triggered by nascent chains misfolding and that DTT induces 25S rRNA cleavage by a different mechanism. Given that DTT causes ER stress and activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) (38Back S.H. Schröder M. Lee K. Zhang K. Kaufman R.J. ER stress signaling by regulated splicing: IRE1/HAC1/XBP1.Methods. 2005; 35: 395-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), we asked whether cleavage of 25S rRNA was a consequence of an activated UPR. To address this possibility, we examined the effects of deleting the ER-stress transmitter gene IRE1, critical for mounting the UPR (39Sidrauski C. Walter P. The transmembrane kinase Ire1p is a site-specific endonuclease that initiates mRNA splicing in the unfolded protein response.Cell. 1997; 90: 1031-1039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar), using tsa1Δ cells, which showed efficient ES7c cleavage formation in response to DTT (Fig. 1, D and E). To confirm that the UPR was suppressed in the generated ire1Δ strains, we monitored the formation of the spliced form of the HAC1 gene, HAC1i, which gives rise to the transcriptionally competent Hac1 factor necessary for transcription of UPR-responsive genes (40Cox J.S. Walter P. A novel mechanism for regulating activity of a transcription factor that controls the unfolded protein response.Cell. 1996; 87: 391-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). As expected, HAC1i formation was completely blocked in ire1Δ and tsa1Δire1Δ strains after ER stress induced by treatment with DTT or another classic ER stress inducer, tunicamycin (Tm; Fig. 2, bottom panel). An ES7c cleavage fragment formation induced by DTT still occurred in the tsa1Δire1Δ cells, but it was not observed after Tm treatment in either of the strains (Fig. 2, top panel). Taken together, these data indicate that cleavage of 25S rRNA in the ES7c region is not part of the UPR. Having established that ES7c cleavage does not occur because of DTT acting as an activator of proteotoxic stress or the UPR, we next sought to investigate whether it may be related to the property of DTT to generate hydrogen peroxide as a by-product of its oxidation (41Kachur A.V.

Apoptosis induced by dithiothreitol in HL-60 cells shows early activation of caspase 3 and is independent of mitochondria.Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1002-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The ability of DTT and other thiols to act as a source of ROS in cells depends on multiple environmental and cellular factors including thiol concentration and the availability of metal ions, chelators, and activity of radical scavengers in the cell (43Held K.D. Sylvester F.C. Hopcia K.L. Biaglow J.E. Role of Fenton chemistry in thiol-induced toxicity and apoptosis.Radiat. Res. 1996; 145: 542-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This side of DTT was investigated primarily in mammalian cell culture studies (42Amrolia P. Sullivan S.G. Stern A. Munday R. Toxicity of aromatic thiols in the human red blood cell.J. Appl. Toxicol. 1989; 9: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 43Held K.D. Sylvester F.C. Hopcia K.L. Biaglow J.E. Role of Fenton chemistry in thiol-induced toxicity and apoptosis.Radiat.

Apoptosis induced by dithiothreitol in HL-60 cells shows early activation of caspase 3 and is independent of mitochondria.Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1002-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and the extent of this potential effect of DTT in yeast cells was unclear. To address the hypothesis that ROS production mediates the effects of DTT treatment on RNA integrity, we first measured H2O2 levels in yeast cultures treated with DTT using Amplex Red hydrogen peroxide assays. Because H2O2 readily diffuses through the plasma membrane and exists in the intra/extracellular equilibrium, Amplex Red measurements of extracellular H2O2 reflect its presence inside the cell (43Held K.D. Sylvester F.C. Hopcia K.L. Biaglow J.E. Role of Fenton chemistry in thiol-induced toxicity and apoptosis.Radiat. Res. 1996; 145: 542-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 47Karthikeyan G. Lewis L.K. Resnick M.A. The mitochondrial protein frataxin prevents nuclear damage.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that treatment of wild-type cells with DTT resulted in a significant increase of H2O2 over time when compared with control untreated cells (Fig. 3A). To confirm a functional connection between DTT-induced H2O2 production and DTT-induced ES7c cleavage, we used a dual approach. First, we examined ES7c cleavage in response to DTT in cells pretreated with the hydrogen peroxide scavenger ebselen (48Satheeshkumar K. Mugesh G. Synthesis and antioxidant activity of peptide-based ebselen analogues.Chemistry. 2011; 17: 4849-4857Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because of ebselen sensitivity to light, this assay was conducted in a tsa1Δ strain, which demonstrates fast kinetics of ES7c cleavage in response to DTT (Fig. 1D). Hybridization analysis of rRNA revealed that the presence of ebselen in media before and during incubation of tsa1Δ with DTT significantly decreased ES7c-fragment formation (Fig. 3B). This is consistent with the idea that DTT causes ES7c cleavage by promoting generation of H2O2. As a second approach, we tested rRNAs extracted from wild-type cells treated with various drugs known to increase cellular H2O2 levels. Similar to DTT, treatments with redox-cycling agents (menadione and plumbagin) or inorganic hydrogen peroxide promoted formation of ES7c-cleaved fragments (Fig. 3C). The combination of these data strongly supported the possibility that production of hydrogen peroxide mediates 25S rRNA cleavage in the ES7c region in response to DTT. Menadione and hydrogen peroxide are two oxidants often used as extracellular stressors of yeast cells because of their good stability in medium and high cell wall/membrane permeability. Interestingly, these drugs can trigger different cellular responses depending on the drug concentration and duration of treatment (49Jin C. Strich R. Cooper K.F. Slt2p phosphorylation induces cyclin C nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation in response to oxidative stress.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2014; 25: 1396-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that rRNA fragmentation can occur in response to activation of an apoptotic program in yeast cells (31Mroczek S. Kufel J. Apoptotic signals induce specific degradation of ribosomal RNA in yeast.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 2874-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although much harsher conditions were used in the previous studies to induce apoptosis (e.g. 600 μm menadione for 200 min) (31Mroczek S. Kufel J. Apoptotic signals induce specific degradation of ribosomal RNA in yeast.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 2874-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we asked whether treatment of cells with the lower oxidant doses that induced ES7c cleavage (Fig. 3C) might also be inducing the yeast death program. First, we tested whether deletion of genes involved in yeast apoptosis might prevent or decrease the formation of the ES7c cleavage. To this end, we analyzed strains deficient for the mitochondrial cell death effector gene AIF1 (50Wissing S. Ludovico P. Herker E. Büttner S. Engelhardt S.M. Decker T. Link A. Proksch A. Rodrigues F.

Post-translational lipid modification of Ras proteins plays an important role in their recruitment to the PM. Electrostatic interactions between negatively charged PM phospholipids and basic amino acids found in K-Ras4B (K-Ras) but not in H-Ras are important for permanent K-Ras localization to the PM. Here, we investigated how acute depletion of negatively charged PM polyphosphoinositides (PPIns) from the PM alters the intracellular distribution and activity of K- and H-Ras proteins. PPIns depletion from the PM was achieved either by agonist-induced activation of phospholipase C β or with a rapamycin-inducible system in which various phosphatidylinositol phosphatases were recruited to the PM. Redistribution of the two Ras proteins was monitored with confocal microscopy or with a recently developed bioluminescence resonance energy transfer-based approach involving fusion of the Ras C-terminal targeting sequences or the entire Ras proteins to Venus fluorescent protein. We found that PM PPIns depletion caused rapid translocation of K-Ras but not H-Ras from the PM to the Golgi. PM depletion of either phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) or PtdIns(4,5)P2 but not PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was sufficient to evoke K-Ras translocation. This effect was diminished by deltarasin, an inhibitor of the Ras–phosphodiesterase interaction, or by simultaneous depletion of the Golgi PtdIns4P. The PPIns depletion decreased incorporation of [3H]leucine in K-Ras–expressing cells, suggesting that Golgi-localized K-Ras is not as signaling-competent as its PM-bound form. We conclude that PPIns in the PM are important regulators of K-Ras–mediated signals. Plasma membrane (PM) localization of Ras proteins is crucial for transmitting signals upon mitogen stimulation.

The interaction of intracellular signaling proteins with the hydrophobic membranes of eukaryotic cells is critical for the signaling competence of these proteins. In the case of the peripheral PM 3The abbreviations used are: PMplasma membranePPInspolyphosphoinositide(s)PLCphospholipase CBRETbioluminescence resonance energy transferPtdInsphosphatidylinositolPSphosphatidylserineERendoplasmic reticulumFKBPFK506 binding-proteinPJpseudojaninPHpleckstrin homologyLucluciferasePDEphosphodiesteraseFRBFKBP-rapamycin-bindingWmwortmanninptasephosphataseM3RM3 muscarinic receptormTORmechanistic target of rapamycinPtdSerphosphatidylserineAAamino acidsEEAearly endosome antigenmRFPmonomeric red fluorescent proteinANOVAanalysis of variance. proteins, such interaction with the PM can occur via different mechanisms. Proteins that contain an amphipathic α-helix or hydrophobic loops can directly penetrate into the inner surface of the membrane. Others, however, do not contain enough clustered hydrophobic amino acids to maintain a stable membrane interaction. In this case, other mechanisms are necessary to attach the protein to the PM. Many signaling proteins undergo post-translational lipid modifications, attaching a myristoyl, palmitoyl, or prenyl group on specific amino acid residues. These modifications provide the lipophilicity of the proteins ensuring proper PM localization (1Whited A.M. Johs A. The interactions of peripheral membrane proteins with biological membranes.Chem.

Ras protein mutations are one of the most common causes in cancer and hence have attracted a lot of attention. These small globular proteins are molecular switches that change conformation upon GTP binding relative to their GDP-bound forms (2Wennerberg K. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. The Ras superfamily at a glance.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 843-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar, 3Lu S. Jang H. Muratcioglu S. Gursoy A. Keskin O. Nussinov R. Zhang J. Ras conformational ensembles, allostery, and signaling.Chem. Rev. 2016; 116: 6607-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Their C termini contain their localization signal providing for membrane attachment due to post-translational modifications. Numerous oncogenic mutations of Ras proteins have been identified, many of which affect GTP binding of these proteins, but naturally occurring mutations in the C-terminal anchoring domains have not been reported yet, showing the uniquely significant role of this conserved essential segment in Ras protein functions (4Prior I.A. Lewis P.D. Mattos C. A comprehensive survey of Ras mutations in cancer.Cancer Res. 2012; 72: 2457-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). H-Ras proteins undergo two lipid modifications: in addition to their C-terminal prenylation, they are also palmitoylated in their C-terminal tails (5Rocks O. Peyker A. Kahms M. Verveer P.J. Koerner C. Lumbierres M. Kuhlmann J. Waldmann H. Wittinghofer A. Bastiaens P.I. An acylation cycle regulates localization and activity of palmitoylated Ras isoforms.Science. 2005; 307: 1746-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). In contrast, K-Ras proteins contain only the prenyl modification, and their PM anchoring is highly dependent on a polybasic amino acid sequence as a “second signal” located in their C-terminal tails (6Wright L.P. Philips M.R. Thematic review series: lipid posttranslational modifications. CAAX modification and membrane targeting of Ras.J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 883-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that changing the positively charged amino acids to neutral amino acids by site-directed mutagenesis can fully abolish the PM localization of the K-Ras protein. Such mutated K-Ras proteins show nonspecific endomembrane localization similar to that of proteins that have only a prenyl or myristoyl group as targeting signals (7Silvius J.R. Bhagatji P.

J. 2009; 96: 3663-3672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). At cytoplasmic pH, the cytosolic face of the PM is enriched in two types of anionic phospholipids. Phosphatidylserine (PS) is the most abundant anionic phospholipid, amounting to 3–10% of the total phospholipid pool of the cells (10Kay J.G. Koivusalo M. Ma X. Wohland T. Grinstein S. Phosphatidylserine dynamics in cellular membranes.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2012; 23: 2198-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) found in the inner leaflet of the PM. The other is the various polyphosphoinositides (PPIns) that account for less than 1% of total anionic phospholipids (11Stahelin R.V. Scott J.L. Frick C.T. Cellular and molecular interactions of phosphoinositides and peripheral proteins.Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2014; 182: 3-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Although PS is found in a relative high amount in the PM, providing the bulk negativity for the inner leaflet of the membrane (12Yeung T. Gilbert G.E. Shi J. Silvius J. Kapus A. Grinstein S. Membrane phosphatidylserine regulates surface charge and protein localization.Science. 2008; 319: 210-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar), its precise role in controlling cellular processes is vastly underexplored. In contrast, the impact of the PPIns in the regulation of a variety of cellular processes is well-established. Of the three PPIns, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) equally share the majority role, whereas phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) is present only in a very small amount even in stimulated cells. Although these lipids have substantial roles in the regulation of ion channels, cell motility, and vesicular trafficking and they also represent molecular clues for targeting signaling proteins to membranes (13Yeung T. Terebiznik M. Yu L. Silvius J. Abidi W.M. Philips M. Levine T. Kapus A. Grinstein S.

In this study, we investigated how the rapid depletion of PM PPIns can regulate the intracellular distribution of lipid-anchored PM proteins, namely the K- and H-Ras proteins. Using a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based method suitable to monitor the movement of PM-bound proteins after they are released from the PM, we show the translocation of K-Ras or its isolated targeting sequence to either the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or Golgi upon rapid PM PPIns depletion. The method is highly sensitive, can be easily quantified, and therefore allows the comparison of the involvement of the various PPIns in the PM localization of the Ras proteins. This analysis also reveals that PM PPIns depletion significantly attenuates the proliferation of the cells expressing constitutively active K- but not H-Ras mutants, which highlights the different functional role of the PPIns-dependent PM anchoring in K-Ras and H-Ras signaling. We designed several constructs to target the Venus protein to the inner leaflet of the PM using targeting signal sequences either added to the N or C termini of the fluorescent protein (Fig. 1A). These included the N-terminal 14 amino acids of Lyn kinase, which has a single palmitoyl and single myristoyl modification (Lyn(1–14)-Venus), the N-terminal 10 amino acids of Lck kinase, which has a double palmitoyl and a single myristoyl residue (Lck(1–10)-Venus), and the N-terminal 15 amino acids of c-Src kinase, which contains only a single myristoyl (c-Src(1–15)-Venus). As for C-terminal signal sequences, we used the C-terminal 22 residues of K-Ras modified by prenylation (Venus-K-Ras-CAAX) or the C-terminal 22 amino acid signal sequence of H-Ras, which possesses double palmitoylation and prenylation (Venus-H-Ras-CAAX). Notably, in addition to the lipid modification, the targeting sequences of c-Src and K-Ras also contained a number of positively charged amino acids. As expected and shown previously by various reports (14Heo W.D. Inoue T. Park W.S. Kim M.L. Park B.O. Wandless T.J. Meyer T.

Importantly, most of the constructs also displayed a small but consistent endomembrane localization, the amount of which was minimal relative to the total amount of the proteins. Recently we developed a BRET-based method monitoring the proximity of luciferase-tagged PM receptors and the Venus protein targeted to the surface of various intracellular organelles. This method was successfully used to follow the intracellular trafficking route of G protein–coupled receptors from the PM to different intracellular compartments (18Tóth D.J. Tóth J.T. Gulyás G.

To investigate the dynamic changes of the membrane localization of peripheral membrane proteins that bind the PM and follow their intracellular fates, we utilized the same approach with some modifications. The most important modification was that now we targeted the luciferase enzyme itself to the cytoplasmic surface of the different intracellular organelles to serve as donor and used the Venus protein tagged with the various PM-targeting sequences (see above) as the acceptor (Fig. 1B). Moreover, we used an improved version of Renilla luciferase and fused it to well-characterized resident protein sequences defining various organelles. These included targeting sequences of TGN38 (N-terminal target of the full-length protein) for Golgi, TOM70 (N-terminal amino acids 1–30) for mitochondria, Sac1 (C-terminal amino acids 521–58) for ER, and EEA1 (amino acids 1253–1411 that correspond to its FYVE (Fab1/YOTB/Vac1/EEA1) domain) for early endosomes (Fig. 1C). To validate proper localization, luciferase enzyme was replaced by Cerulean in all of the constructs, and the constructs were expressed in HEK 293T cells to confirm their proper localization (Fig. 1C). To achieve the PM PPIns depletion, a previously described rapamycin-induced heterodimerization system was used (20Várnai P. Thyagarajan B. Rohacs T. Balla T. Rapidly inducible changes in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate levels influence multiple regulatory functions of the lipid in intact living cells.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In most of the experiments, the FKBP-fused version of the bifunctional phosphatase pseudojanin (PJ) containing a 4- and a 5-phosphatase domain (15Hammond G.R. Fischer M.J. Anderson K.E. Holdich J.

FRB was targeted to the PM using the targeting sequence of the Lck protein (Fig. 2A). When the role of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was studied, a low (100 nm) concentration of wortmannin was used to inhibit class I PtdIns 3-kinase activity. Effects of these manipulations on PM PPIns levels were validated using specific biosensors based on the following lipid-binding domains: SidM-2xP4M as the PtdIns4P sensor (21Hammond G.R. Machner M.P. Balla T. A novel probe for phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate reveals multiple pools beyond the Golgi.J. Cell Biol. 2014; 205: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), PLCδ1-PH as the PtdIns(4,5)P2 sensor (22Várnai P. Balla T.

As shown on Fig. 2B by confocal microscopy in HEK 293T cells, rapamycin-induced PJ recruitment resulted in the decrease in both PtdIns4P and PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels. This was confirmed by using the more quantitative BRET-based biosensors (24Tóth J.T. Gulyás G. Tóth D.J. Balla A. Hammond G.R. Hunyady L. Balla T. Várnai P. BRET-monitoring of the dynamic changes of inositol lipid pools in living cells reveals a PKC-dependent PtdIns4P increase upon EGF and M3 receptor activation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1861: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Recruitment of PJ enzymes of various activities with 300 nm rapamycin resulted in a rapid decrease of the PM PtdIns4P, PtdIns(4,5)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (Fig. 2C, red curves). Wortmannin pretreatment did not affect the PM PtdIns4P or PtdIns(4,5)P2 but induced maximal depletion of PM PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Notably, wortmannin treatment reduced PM PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 to a lower level than the rapamycin-induced depletion of its precursor, PtdIns(4,5)P2, indicating that the removal of the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 precursor may not have been complete and that the inhibition of the PI3K enzyme is more effective under these conditions. Although these results were mostly confirmatory of previous similar studies, they were important for proper evaluation of the subsequent experiments. Hammond et al. (15Hammond G.R. Fischer M.J. Anderson K.E. Holdich J. Koteci A. Balla T. Irvine R.F. PI4P and PI(4,5)P2 are essential but independent lipid determinants of membrane identity.Science. 2012; 337: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) found that peripheral proteins containing positively charged amino acids are released from the PM after combined PtdIns4P and PtdIns(4,5)P2 depletion. To investigate this phenomenon in further details using the various PM-targeted Venus constructs, we initially performed confocal measurements. As shown on Fig. 3A, depletion of PM PtdIns4P, PtdIns(4,5)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels by the addition of rapamycin clearly reduced the PM localization of Venus-K-Ras-CAAX, whereas the localization of the other PM-targeted Venus constructs (Lyn(1–14)-Venus, Lck(1–10)-Venus, and Venus-H-Ras-CAAX) remained unchanged (Fig. 3A). In the case of c-Src(1–15)-Venus, the reduction of PM localization is not so clear, but there is a tendency of the fluorescent signal to show an endomembrane pattern upon rapamycin treatment (Fig. 3A). To obtain more information about the fate of the proteins after their release from the PM, we next performed BRET measurement between the proteins and various intracellular organelles. First, we used HEK 293T cells coexpressing endoplasmic reticulum-targeted luciferase construct (Luc-ER), the components of the lipid depletion system, and the PM-targeted Venus proteins. Because the ER has a large surface, we reasoned that proteins released from the PM would generate a signal with the ER-targeted luciferase. As shown in Fig. 3B, upon PM PPIns depletion, we did detect increased energy transfer in cells expressing the Venus-K-Ras-CAAX or c-Src(1–15)-Venus constructs (2.73 × 10−2 ± 0.723 × 10−2, p < 0.001 and 1.61 × 10−2 ± 0.284 × 10−2, p = 0.027, respectively). There was no significant change, however, in the case of the other PM targeting sequences. Next, we investigated whether these two targeting motifs can generate energy transfer with luciferase targeted to the surface of other organelles. As shown in Fig. 3C, releasing Venus-K-Ras-CAAX from the PM generated a significant increase in the BRET signal in the Golgi (9.0 × 10−2 ± 0.256 × 10−2, p = 0.001) but not in early endosomes. In the case of the mitochondria, we detected a very small but still significant increase (0.712 × 10−2 ± 0.15 × 10−2, p = 0.026). c-Src(1–15)-tagged Venus resulted in a similar change (data not shown). Importantly, we did not detect any interaction between trans-Golgi-targeted luciferase (Golgi-Luc) and Venus-H-Ras-CAAX after PM PPIns depletion (Fig. 3D). As an important control experiment, we determined that PM PPIns depletion did affect the localization of the organelle-targeted luciferases. As shown in supplemental Fig. S1, confocal microscopy did not reveal any detectable change in the localization of the constructs (here luciferase was replaced by Cerulean). Previous studies have shown that rather than using vesicle trafficking the K-Ras proteins move between intracellular membranes through binding to “solubilizing factors,” such as Galectin-3 and PDEδ, to prevent random attachment to the endomembranes (6Wright L.P.

Structural analysis showed that these transport proteins provide a hydrophobic groove suitable to accommodate the hydrophobic farnesyl group on the K-Ras protein, thereby increasing its water solubility (26Zimmermann G.

KRas localizes to the plasma membrane by spatial cycles of solubilization, trapping and vesicular transport.Cell. 2014; 157: 459-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To test how this process affects the translocation of the protein from the PM to the Golgi, we pretreated cells with deltarasin, a compound that competes with Ras binding by mimicking the structure of farnesyl groups (26Zimmermann G. Papke B. Ismail S. Vartak N. Chandra A. Hoffmann M. Hahn S.A. Triola G. Wittinghofer A. Bastiaens P.I. Waldmann H. Small molecule inhibition of the KRAS-PDEδ interaction impairs oncogenic KRAS signalling.Nature. 2013; 497: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Deltarasin treatment significantly reduced (from 7.47 × 10−2 ± 0.218 × 10−2 to 3.29 × 10−2 ± 0.692 × 10−2, p = 0.005) the appearance of Venus-K-Ras-CAAX at the Golgi upon PM PPIns depletion (Fig. 4A). Confocal images in Fig. 4B also show that in deltarasin-pretreated COS-7 cells a reduced amount of Venus-K-Ras-CAAX reached the Golgi upon rapamycin treatment. Instead, Venus-K-Ras-CAAX remained bound to intracellular vesicular structures. Notably, deltarasin treatment alone significantly reduced K-Ras-CAAX–Golgi interaction (−1.94 × 10−2 ± 0.374 × 10−2, p = 0.039), suggesting that even in resting cells (without PM PPIns depletion) there is a rapid cycling of K-Ras-CAAX-tagged proteins between the Golgi and the PM (supplemental Fig. S2A). To confirm that Venus-K-Ras-CAAX can exist in the cytoplasm, not in a membrane-bound but in a free, solubilized form, we carried out a simple experiment. Cells that expressed Venus-K-Ras-CAAX were treated with the permeabilization agent digitonin, allowing the release of small cytoplasmic proteins from the cell. As shown in Fig. 4D, upon permeabilization, Venus-K-Ras-CAAX also appeared in the membrane of the other non-transfected cells of the culture, supporting the hypothesis of membrane-independent cytoplasmic trafficking. This phenomenon was not observed when H-Ras-CAAX was used instead of K-Ras-CAAX (Fig. 4D). To examine whether it is the Golgi PtdIns4P that recruits the Venus-K-Ras-CAAX during its Golgi translocation, we performed BRET measurements in which, in addition to depletion of PM PPIns, the PtdIns4P pool of the Golgi was also reduced. To do this, we cotransfected HEK 293T cells with plasmids that targeted FRB to both the PM and the Golgi for the rapamycin-dependent PJ translocation to both compartments (Fig. 4D). As shown in Fig. 4D, upper plot, concomitant Golgi PtdIns4P depletion resulted in a significantly lower (from 3.99 × 10−2 ± 0.422 × 10−2 to 1.81 × 10−2 ± 0.0704 × 10−2, p = 0.007) translocation of the K-Ras-CAAX-tagged Venus compared with PPIns depletion only at the PM. Control measurements of PM PtdIns(4,5)P2 were carried out to show that the decrease of the Golgi translocation of Venus-K-Ras-CAAX was not due to lesser PM phospholipid depletion (Fig. 4E, lower plot). As shown in Fig. 2, rapamycin-induced PJ recruitment led to acute depletion of PtdIns4P, PtdIns(4,5)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in the PM. To investigate whether any of these lipids has a specific role in keeping the K-Ras-CAAX-tagged Venus in the PM, we depleted these PPIns individually. As shown in Fig. 5A, the robust PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 depletion in the PM achieved by wortmannin (Wm) treatment (see Fig. 2C) did not cause Venus-K-Ras-CAAX to appear in the Golgi compartment nor did it affect the Golgi translocation response following PJ recruitment to the PM. This suggests that PM PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 plays a negligible role in the stabilization of the Venus-K-Ras-CAAX protein at the PM. Next, we depleted PM PtdIns4P and PtdIns(4,5)P2 separately to examine the contribution of these lipids individually to the PM localization of K-Ras. For this, we used PJ enzyme inactivated in either its 5-phosphatase (FKBP-PJ-4ptase) or 4-phosphatase (FKBP-PJ-5ptase) activity (15Hammond G.R. Fischer M.J. Anderson K.E. Holdich J. Koteci A. Balla T. Irvine R.F. PI4P and PI(4,5)P2 are essential but independent lipid determinants of membrane identity.Science. 2012; 337: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5B, FKBP-PJ-5ptase recruitment, which reduced only the PM PtdIns(4,5)P2 level (with a slight increase in PM PtdIns4P), caused an ∼40% reduction (from 7.67 × 10−2 ± 0.71 × 10−2 to 4.58 × 10−2 ± 1.21 × 10−2, p = 0.00287) of Venus-K-Ras-CAAX translocation to the Golgi when compared with the effect of FKBP-PJ. Recruitment of the FKBP-PJ-4ptase, which reduced only PM PtdIns4P, was less effective (85% reduction) but still caused a significant increase (1.25 × 10−2 ± 0.041 × 10−2, p = 0.003) of K-Ras-CAAX Golgi appearance (Fig. 5B). In the previous experiments, we examined the isolated targeting sequences of the Ras proteins. To study the behavior of the full-length Ras proteins, we created N-terminally Venus-tagged versions of the full-length K- and H-Ras proteins and investigated their movements under conditions of PPIns manipulations. In these experiments, the constitutively active form, G12V, of both Ras proteins was used. As shown in Fig. 6, the full-length proteins showed the same changes in response to PPIns depletion as their isolated targeting sequences examined by both confocal microscopy (Fig. 6A) and BRET (Fig. 6, B and C) in HEK 293T cells (1.34 × 10−2 ± 0.275 × 10−2, p = 0.049 and 3.56 × 10−2 ± 0.567 × 10−2, p = 0.02, respectively). Wild-type or dominant-negative forms of the Ras proteins behaved the same way, indicating that the translocation process is independent of the activity state of these proteins (supplemental Fig. S3)."
https://openalex.org/W2756635978,"Pleiotrophin (PTN) is a multifunctional, cationic, glycosaminoglycan-binding cytokine and growth factor involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes, including tissue repair and inflammation-related diseases. PTN has been shown to promote leukocyte responses by inducing their migration and expression of inflammatory cytokines. However, the mechanisms through which PTN mediates these responses remain unclear. Here, we identified the integrin Mac-1 (αMβ2, CD11b/CD18) as the receptor mediating macrophage adhesion and migration to PTN. We also found that expression of Mac-1 on the surface of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells induced their adhesion and migration to PTN. Accordingly, PTN promoted Mac-1–dependent cell spreading and initiated intracellular signaling manifested in phosphorylation of Erk1/2. While binding to PTN, Mac-1 on Mac-1–expressing HEK293 cells appears to cooperate with cell-surface proteoglycans because both anti-Mac-1 function-blocking mAb and heparin were required to block adhesion. Moreover, biolayer interferometry and NMR indicated a direct interaction between the αMI domain, the major ligand-binding region of Mac-1, and PTN. Using peptide libraries, we found that in PTN the αMI domain bound sequences enriched in basic and hydrophobic residues, indicating that PTN conforms to the general principle of ligand-recognition specificity of the αMI domain toward cationic proteins/peptides. Finally, using recombinant PTN-derived fragments, we show that PTN contains two distinct Mac-1–binding sites in each of its constitutive domains. Collectively, these results identify PTN as a ligand for the integrin Mac-1 on the surface of leukocytes and suggest that this interaction may play a role in inflammatory responses.

It is thought that the basic nature of PTN is crucial to its ability to interact with receptors and initiate signaling. Although the role of PTN in mitogenesis and angiogenesis has been extensively researched, its function in inflammation has not been widely explored. Given the fact that injured tissues express PTN, it is likely that leukocytes are exposed to it at sites of inflammation. Indeed, some studies have suggested that PTN plays a role in recruitment of leukocytes during inflammation (13Yokoi H. Kasahara M. Mori K. Ogawa Y. Kuwabara T. Imamaki H. Kawanishi T. Koga K. Ishii A. Kato Y. Mori K.P. Toda N. Ohno S. Muramatsu H.

However, the identity of the PTN receptor(s) on leukocytes that mediate this response and the role of PTN signaling in these cells remain unknown. We hypothesized that integrin αMβ2 (Mac-1, CD11b/CD18, CR3) can serve as a receptor for PTN. This hypothesis was based on our recent finding that Mac-1 binds cationic proteins, many of which, similar to PTN, interact with heparin (28Schober J.M. Chen N. Grzeszkiewicz T.M. Jovanovic I.

Mac-1 is an adhesion receptor expressed on the surface of myeloid cells such as monocyte/macrophages and neutrophils. As an adhesion receptor, Mac-1 is crucial to numerous leukocyte responses, including migration, phagocytosis, degranulation, adherence to microorganisms, and others (31Coxon A. Rieu P. Barkalow F.J.

Among integrins, which are in general notorious for their capacity to recognize multiple ligands, Mac-1 is its most promiscuous member. In contrast to many other integrins that recognize the RGD motif, Mac-1 does not bind this sequence. Instead, as we have recently revealed, Mac-1 has preferences for sequences enriched in basic and hydrophobic amino acid residues (29Podolnikova N.P. Podolnikov A.V. Haas T.A. Lishko V.K. Ugarova T.P.

Rep. Biochem. 2016; 2016: 39-55PubMed Google Scholar). The identification of Mac-1 recognition motifs has led to the prediction that other cationic proteins and peptides released from leukocytes and other cells during tissue injury can serve as Mac-1 ligands (29Podolnikova N.P. Podolnikov A.V. Haas T.A. Lishko V.K. Ugarova T.P.

Most of Mac-1’s ligand binding and thus its broad ligand binding specificity can be attributed to the αMI domain, a region of ∼200 amino acid residues inserted into the αM subunit, inasmuch as its removal in Mac-1 eliminates ∼85% of ligand binding (35Luo B.H. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Structural basis of integrin regulation and signaling.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 25: 619-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). In this study, we present biochemical and cell biology evidence that PTN is a ligand for Mac-1. Using various Mac-1–expressing cells, we demonstrate that Mac-1 supports adhesion to PTN, promotes spreading, and induces activation of the MAP kinase Erk1/2. Furthermore, PTN induces a potent migratory response in Mac-1–expressing human embryonic kidney 293 (Mac-1 HEK293) cells and in isolated murine macrophages. Direct interaction between PTN and the αMI domain, the major ligand-binding region of Mac-1, has been shown using biolayer interferometry analyses and confirmed by solution NMR spectroscopy. Finally, using peptide array analysis, we identified the putative αMI domain-binding sites in both TSR domains of PTN and validated their importance in cell adhesion and signaling assays with individual recombinant PTN fragments. To assess whether PTN can bind Mac-1, we initially examined the ability of Mac-1 HEK293 to adhere to immobilized PTN. As shown in Fig. 1A, Mac-1 HEK293 cells adhered to immobilized PTN in a concentration-dependent manner with saturable adhesion achieved with a PTN coating concentration of ∼100 nm. Wild-type HEK293 cells also strongly adhered to PTN. However, the presence of Mac-1 significantly augmented adhesion (Fig. 1A). Because PTN has high affinity for glycosaminoglycans and HSPG N-syndecan binds PTN, we examined the possibility that HSPGs on wild-type HEK293 cells mediate adhesion to PTN. Preincubation of cells with heparin (1 μg/ml) almost completely eliminated adhesion (Fig. 1B), indicating that on the surface of these cells HSPGs are entirely responsible for PTN binding. However, adhesion of Mac-1 HEK293 cells was reduced by only ∼60%, suggesting that Mac-1 on these cells may be involved in binding PTN. To investigate this possibility, Mac-1 HEK293 cells were treated with the function-blocking mAb 44a (directed against the αMI domain of Mac-1). Although adhesion tended to decrease, it was not significantly altered with the maximal blocking effect (19 ± 10%) observed at 10 μg/ml of mAb. Likewise, although heparin inhibited adhesion in a dose-dependent manner, the maximal blocking effect attained did not exceed 59 ± 6%. However, when Mac-1 HEK293 cells were treated with both mAb 44a and heparin, cell adhesion was inhibited by >95%. These results suggest both HSPG and Mac-1 can act as receptors for PTN. Consistent with the role of Mac-1 in adhesion to PTN, Mac-1 HEK293 cells spread with the formation of actin filaments as detected by staining with Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated phalloidin (Fig. 1C, upper panels). By contrast, spreading of wild-type HEK293 cells was visibly less even after 24 h (Fig. 1C, bottom panels). Quantification of cell spreading confirmed this observation (Fig. 1D). To investigate the relevance of PTN–Mac-1 interaction in immune cells, we performed adhesion assays using IC-21 cells, a murine macrophage cell line naturally expressing Mac-1. As shown in Fig. 1E, IC-21 cells adhered to immobilized PTN, and ∼65% of adhesion was inhibited by mAb M1/70 against the murine αM integrin subunit. This is in contrast to Mac-1 HEK293 cells whose adhesion to PTN was reduced modestly by mAb 44a (Fig. 1B). Moreover, heparin, which greatly decreased adhesion of Mac-1 HEK293 cells to PTN, had little effect on adhesion of IC-21, suggesting that Mac-1 on the surface of IC-21 cells largely contributes to the interaction with PTN. Together, these results identify PTN as an adhesive ligand for Mac-1 and suggest that on the surface of different cells both Mac-1 and HSPGs are involved in PTN adhesion, albeit to a different extent. Because PTN is secreted from cells and deposited into the ECM, we explored whether PTN bound to the ECM components is capable of supporting adhesion. Because Mac-1 is known to interact with a number of ECM proteins, including fibronectin, vitronectin, collagens, Cyr61, and others (36Lishko V.K. Yakubenko V.P. Ugarova T.P. The interplay between integrins αMβ2 and α5β1 during cell migration to fibronectin.Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 283: 116-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), a heterogeneous mixture of these molecules such as those found in Matrigel was not suitable as a substrate for investigations of PTN–Mac-1 interactions. PTN is only known to bind proteoglycans; therefore, the most relevant form of PTN encountered by immune cells in vivo is likely to be PTN anchored to ECM proteoglycans. To simulate such an environment, we studied cell adhesion to PTN prebound to aggrecan, a common proteoglycan found in the ECM. Fig. 2 shows that at two concentrations of PTN tested both Mac-1 HEK293 and wild-type HEK293 (HEK293) cells adhered to aggrecan-bound PTN with Mac-1 HEK293 cells adhering at a significantly higher level than HEK293 cells (p < 0.001). Neither type of cells had affinity for aggrecan itself. Notably, binding of PTN to aggrecan did not reduce cell adhesion, indicating that PTN in its aggrecan-bound form remains an efficient Mac-1 ligand. PTN is known to induce cell migration, and in some instances, this effect has been shown to be integrin-dependent (24Mikelis C. Sfaelou E. Koutsioumpa M. Kieffer N. Papadimitriou E. Integrin αvβ3 is a pleiotrophin receptor required for pleiotrophin-induced endothelial cell migration through receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase β/ζ.FASEB J. 2009; 23: 1459-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 37Lu K.V.

Chem. 2005; 280: 26953-26964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether Mac-1 can support PTN-induced migration. In particular, using a Transwell system, we compared the ability of wild-type and Mac-1 HEK293 cells to migrate toward PTN. Previous studies reported that these cell lines are a useful system for assessing the role of Mac-1 in migration (38Forsyth C.B. Solovjov D.A. Ugarova T.P. Plow E.F. Integrin αMβ2-mediated cell migration to fibrinogen and its recognition peptides.J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). PTN induced a potent migratory response (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, wild-type HEK293 migrated only slightly. Direct evidence that migration of Mac-1 HEK293 cells was dependent on Mac-1 was obtained in the experiments in which anti-Mac-1 mAb 44a was tested. Although mAb 44a eliminated cell migration, an IgG1 isotype control for this mAb had no significant effect (Fig. 3B). Heparin (1 μg/ml) also inhibited migration to a modest but significant degree. In a separate set of experiments, we tested whether PTN can induce migration of mouse macrophages isolated from the peritoneum of wild-type and Mac-1–deficient mice. Macrophages were purified from a total population of peritoneal cells, and their migration was examined in a Transwell system. As shown in Fig. 3, C and D, PTN induced a strong migratory response in wild-type macrophages. PTN also induced migration of Mac-1–deficient macrophages. However, compared with wild-type cells, migration of Mac-1–deficient macrophages was significantly impaired (by 76 ± 21%). These results indicate that Mac-1 is a crucial mediator of PTN-induced cell migration. Furthermore, because macrophages lacking Mac-1 can migrate, albeit at a significantly reduced rate, other integrins (most likely αVβ3) may contribute to migration. The interaction of integrins with ligands is known to induce activation of MAP kinases. To determine whether PTN activates MAPKs via binding to Mac-1, adherent Mac-1 HEK293 cells were treated with different concentrations of PTN, and phosphorylation of Erk1/2 was examined. A PTN concentration of 0.7 μm induced a significant increase in phosphorylation of Erk1/2, and this response was blocked by mAb 44a and heparin (Fig. 4, A and B). The simultaneous use of two reagents increased the inhibitory effect; however, the cumulative effect did not reach a statistical significance. Treatment of control HEK293 cells with PTN did not induce phosphorylation of Erk1/2 (Fig. 4A). These data suggest that in this system initiation of intracellular signaling by PTN requires both Mac-1 and HSPGs. To further characterize the Mac-1–PTN interactions and determine domains of Mac-1 responsible for PTN binding, we analyzed the binding parameters of the interaction between the αMI domain and PTN. We focused on the αMI domain because this domain is the major ligand-binding region in Mac-1, and previous studies have shown that several basic proteins and peptides interact with it (28Schober J.M.

To measure the affinity of the αMI domain–PTN interaction, we used biolayer interferometry (BLI) in which PTN was coupled to the matrix coating the biosensor via lysines.

Reuptake is regulated by kinase pathways and drug exposure, allowing for fine-tuning of clearance in response to specific conditions, and here we examine the impact of transporter ligands on DAT residue Thr-53, a proline-directed phosphorylation site previously implicated in AMPH-stimulated efflux mechanisms. Our findings show that Thr-53 phosphorylation is stimulated in a transporter-dependent manner by AMPH and METH in model cells and rat striatal synaptosomes, and in striatum of rats given subcutaneous injection of METH. Rotating disc electrode voltammetry revealed that initial rates of uptake and AMPH-induced efflux were elevated in phosphorylation-null T53A DAT relative to WT and charge-substituted T53D DATs, consistent with functions related to charge or polarity. These effects occurred without alterations of surface transporter levels, and mutants also showed reduced cocaine analog binding affinity that was not rescued by Zn2+. Together these findings support a role for Thr-53 phosphorylation in regulation of transporter kinetic properties that could impact DAT responses to amphetamines and cocaine."

However, the intrinsic self-organizing behavior of organoids and gastruloids may pose a slight challenge to this novel ethical approach. Incorporating engineering ethics early during the planning stages of organoid and gastruloid research may help prevent future confusion about the moral status of complex models of human development. However, the intrinsic self-organizing behavior of organoids and gastruloids may pose a slight challenge to this novel ethical approach. The Blaschka Glass Models of Plants—a.k.a. the “glass flowers” at the Harvard Museum of Natural History—is a renowned collection of 4,400 models of over 830 plant species commissioned for the benefit of Harvard botany students more than a century ago. Thanks to the unprecedented realism of Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka’s craftsmanship, these life-sized replicas and enlarged flower parts offered scholars perpetual specimens of plant vigor and disease that could be studied year-round in lieu of their natural counterparts. Today, in a building next to the museum, and in stem cell laboratories around the world, researchers are using pluripotent and multipotent stem cells to create exciting new models of human biology. Organoids (small stem cell-derived 3D structures that self-organize into functional cell types and recapitulate basic organ functions) and gastruloids (pluripotent stem cell-derived in vitro simulations of gastrulating embryos) comprise a growing trend to create stem cell-based models of human development. Although nowhere near as representative of their referents as the Blaschka glass models—organoids and gastruloids are morphologically and functionally incomplete at present—these small stem cell-based model systems might be used to advance knowledge in several ways. Organoids could be used to model diseases, screen and develop new drugs, or explore the mysteries of human organ and tissue formation (Huch et al., 2017Huch M. Knoblich J.A. Lutolf M.P. Martinez-Arias A. Development. 2017; 144: 938-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). And gastruloids hold the promise of expanding knowledge of the biophysical and self-organizing principles of gastrulating human embryos (Simunovic and Brivanlou, 2017Simunovic M. Brivanlou A.H. Development. 2017; 144: 976-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). As the Blaschka glass flowers had done for botanists years ago, stem cell-based models of human development today may allow researchers to study biological details that were previously out of reach, and to do so repeatedly without having to access “real” human organs or embryos. However, unlike the glass flowers that have delighted Harvard visitors for generations, organoids and gastruloids have the potential to evoke ethical unease in the near and further future. My aim in this Forum is to call attention to one unique ethical concern and to propose a novel strategy for addressing it. Many ethical issues surrounding organoid and gastruloid research have already been identified and discussed at length elsewhere, so I shall not delve into these matters here. Among these are the informed consent requirements for ethically procuring the human cells necessary to generate organoids and gastruloids, the biobanking and research sharing of organoids, the impact of organoid technology on animal research and clinical trials, and the potential role of organoids in personalized medicine (Bredenoord et al., 2017Bredenoord A.L. Clevers H. Knoblich J.A. Science. 2017; 355https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaf9414Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In my view, each of these areas can be addressed using the standard toolkit of ethical concepts and analyses typically employed by regulators and bioethicists today. One need not reinvent the wheel of research ethics to tackle these issues, challenging as they may be. That said, I believe the wheel of research ethics might need a new spoke or two—borrowed from engineering ethics—if organoids and gastruloids are made to be more complex and functionally complete in this rapidly advancing area of research. Why? Until recently, the objects of biomedical research have been relatively easy to fit into clear-cut classifications for research review and ethical consideration—categories such as human being, animal, embryo, genome, etc. While some may debate the philosophical coherence of maintaining the ethical distinctions that separate the first three categories, it is not an oversimplification to say that each of these “natural kinds” has compelled a proportionate measure of moral consideration, and that bioethicists have responded to this call by furrowing well-worn pathways of research ethics within each of these areas of study. But organoids and gastruloids are not natural kinds, and this fact complicates how we might think of their moral status as research objects (unsurprising, since these models are generated from pluripotent stem cells that themselves have no true equivalent in nature). Organoids, for instance, need the spatial constraints of reconstructed 3D basement membrane matrices, artificially synthesized biomaterials of different densities, or other microtechnologies to enable their creation in vitro. And since organoids lack the vasculature of “natural” human organs, they will need the aid of microfluidic pumps or externally enhanced diffusion to mimic nutrient delivery and waste removal necessary for long-term maintenance and growth. Engineering refinements will also be required for more complex model systems made by linking organoids together to emulate the integrated functioning of the human body. Gastruloid research likewise will depend on the continued work of engineers, as more sophisticated biomaterial-based induction systems are needed to better enable stem cells to recapitulate the complex architecture of human embryos. These new culture systems might also have to incorporate precise morphogen delivery systems via microinjection or microfluidic gradient generators to trigger the symmetry-breaking events involved in early body plan formation (Simunovic and Brivanlou, 2017Simunovic M. Brivanlou A.H. Development. 2017; 144: 976-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Given the considerable engineering aspects of organoids and gastruloids, it may be tempting to assume that their associated ethical issues will be limited to their uses and societal impacts, as is the case with many other artifacts or tools created for biomedical research. Granted, apart from the ethical consequences of their use, very few people are likely to consider simple organoids—e.g., those representing the kidney, liver, gut, eye, or lung—as deserving of serious moral consideration in their own right (or at least any more than we might afford to removed solid organs). But what about the possibility of more developmentally accurate gastruloid models, or more complete cerebral organoids, or even linked organoids designed to mimic complex integrated systems of the human body, such as a linked organoid version of a recently described microfluidic culture model of the female reproductive tract and full menstrual cycle (Xiao et al., 2017Xiao S. Coppeta J.R. Rogers H.B. Isenberg B.C. Zhu J. Olalekan S.A. McKinnon K.E. Dokic D. Rashedi A.S. Haisenleder D.J. et al.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 14584Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar)? As models of human development become more biologically similar to natural kinds—especially those that have traditionally been ethically quite sensitive, such as later-stage embryos, the brain, the human reproductive system, and anencephalic neonates—questions will undoubtedly arise about their moral status as objects of research. This kind of ontological confusion is uncommon in research ethics, and failure to address it proactively, either by researchers or regulators, could hinder scientific progress in this emerging area. Others have made a similar point about complex synthetic tissue assemblies built for biomedical research (Aach et al., 2017Aach J. Lunshof J. Iyer E. Church G. eLife. 2017; 6https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20674Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). I believe researchers can help avert the potential for moral confusion by incorporating elements of engineering ethics early in their work. By engineering ethics I do not mean its traditional focus on issues that are already familiar to many scientists, such as anticipating the negative social implications of engineered products, or assigning blame for bad outcomes, or promoting the professional virtues of whistleblowing or public education. Rather, I mean more recent versions of engineering ethics, which commonly recognize that engineering itself is a value-driven activity and that, as such, there exists a range of possible values, including moral values, that can inform the choices engineers make during the design process (Vermaas et al., 2008Vermaas P.E. Kroes P. Light A. Moore S.A. Philosophy and Design: From Engineering to Architecture. Springer, New York2008Google Scholar). Of course, there will always exist some restrictions on the range of engineering choices available based, for example, on regulatory requirements, intended uses and goals, safety, cost, and—with respect to our present topic—biological relevance. Nevertheless, there will also typically exist more choices than can be simultaneously fulfilled, and an engineer’s decision of which trade-offs are acceptable will not be a value-neutral one. Doing engineering ethics in this modern sense involves actively contemplating which values ought to guide the engineering task at hand and being aware of how trade-offs between design choices are being framed. A good illustration of this engineering approach occurred when multidisciplinary designers of the lightweight city car DutchEVO realized that their desires for car safety and sustainability diverged as competing goals. Decisions about how far to compromise one goal for the other were recognized as engineering choices that required critical reflection of existing conceptions of sustainability and safety. The final car design was finally agreed upon only after the team was able to acknowledge and discuss explicitly the value-laden nature of their work (van de Poel and van Gorp, 2006van de Poel I. van Gorp A.C. Sci. Technol. Human Values. 2006; 31: 333-360Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For organoid and gastruloid research to proceed responsibly, I believe research ethics should incorporate the principle (borrowed from engineering ethics) that stem cell teams and their collaborating engineers must actively deliberate about their guiding values during the design stage of their experiments, along with ethicists who can assist in these engineering deliberations. Although many different biomedical researchers could benefit from taking such a multi-perspectival approach to experimental design, one chief advantage of bringing engineering ethics into the mix for organoid and gastruloid research is that investigators in these areas could be encouraged to reflect openly on ways to reduce the moral ambiguity of their developmental models while still satisfying their research aims. A newly published study nicely illustrates how such an engineering ethics approach might work. Scientists recently created a human pluripotent stem cell-based 3D model that faithfully recapitulates the biological events around post-implantation amniotic sac development (Shao et al., 2017Shao Y. Taniguchi K. Townshend R.F. Miki T. Gumucio D.L. Fu J. Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 208Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Importantly, the model that they developed lacked a primitive endoderm and trophoblast and therefore—despite its resemblance to a central developmental structure in the early human embryo—did not have complete human organismal form and potential. While fulfilling the purpose of this model to recapitulate previously inaccessible early embryogenic events, the team intentionally did not recreate the entire post-implantation human embryo because they did not want to provoke any ethical concerns that a complete embryo model might raise for yet-not-clear scientific necessity (Y. Shao, personal communication). While not explicitly informed by the engineering ethics approach I am advocating here, this example illustrates how making trade-off choices early and explicitly in the experimental design phase is not a concept foreign to researchers. I believe this ethical approach can be operationally refined and adopted by other teams working on organoids and gastruloids. The prospect of incorporating engineering ethics in this manner is not without its challenges, however. A crucial point I have reserved for discussion here is the self-organizing aspect of the human cells that give rise to organoids and gastruloids. The latter are not static models like the Blaschka glass flowers; in fact, as developmental models they are essentially the opposite of glass flowers in many ways. Organoids and gastruloids grow and are biologically dynamic. Remarkable cell-to-cell interactions enable malleable stem cells to recapitulate complex, differentiated organ or embryo-like structures (albeit with the aid of engineered components as discussed above). This biological self-organizing ability of stem cells is largely what makes organoids and gastruloids scientifically so fascinating (and perhaps a bit disturbing to some). Since little is known about the intrinsic organizing principles of these models of human development, it will not always be possible to know in advance whether the design choices engineered into the experiment will in fact avoid producing morally problematic constructs. Biological surprises can disrupt one’s best-laid plans. A good illustration of this latter point occurred during the stem cell battles of the Bush administration, when William Hurlbut, a member of the President’s Council on Bioethics, proposed altered nuclear transfer (ANT) as a non-embryonic source for human pluripotent stem cells. Hurlbut argued that by knocking out the CDX2 gene in a human somatic cell prior to nuclear transfer into an enucleated ooctye, researchers could create an embryo-like entity that would generate pluripotent stem cells but would lack “the most basic features of human organismal infrastructure” and thus would be more akin to a bioengineered teratoma than a viable human embryo (Hyun and Jung, 2006Hyun I. Jung K.W. Hastings Cent. Rep. 2006; 36: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Soon thereafter, Alexander Meissner and Rudolf Jaenisch proved in a mouse study that indeed pluripotent (murine) stem cells could be derived after ANT (Meissner and Jaenisch, 2006Meissner A. Jaenisch R. Nature. 2006; 439: 212-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). However, two important details from their study undermined Hurlbut’s proposal. First, ANT constructs were observed to be not as haphazardly disorganized as Hurlbut had hoped: they formed into mouse blastocysts, albeit non-viable ones due to their Cdx2 deficiency. Second, Meissner and Jaenisch showed they were able to switch this fatal genetic defect on and off at will, which was a necessary feature because Cdx2 had to be turned back on for the optimal health of the resulting stem cell lines. Unfortunately, these experimental results entailed that, if applied to humans, ANT could be criticized as being tantamount to creating a developmentally disabled cloned human embryo and then willfully deciding not to reverse its genetic defect prior to harvesting its stem cells. Thus, Hurlbut’s engineering approach failed to avert conservatives’ concerns about embryonic stem cell research due to the resilient self-organizing behavior of early human cells. This is an important cautionary tale. However, the possibility that biology might surprise us is no reason to dismiss the engineering ethics approach I have outlined here. As knowledge of organoids and gastruloids grows, I am confident that researchers will become better positioned to design model systems that avoid producing morally ambiguous outcomes. Progress will also depend on the fact that, since early attempts at incorporating engineering ethics into design choices will themselves be experimental, researchers will have to watch iterations of these early attempts closely and learn from them. Ultimately, it is my hope that various organoid models focused on isolated developmental events, together with purposefully incomplete gastruloid models, will provide, in the aggregate, a beautifully unified portrait of human development such that singular, more biologically complete but morally confusing human models will not be necessary. If this were to happen, then all should find reason to be delighted indeed. I thank John Aach, Jeantine Lunshof, and Yue Shao for their helpful comments on an earlier draft of this essay."

However, interactions with the excluded strand on the exterior surface of hexameric helicases have also been shown to be important for DNA unwinding, giving rise to the steric exclusion and wrapping (SEW) model. For example, the archaeal Sulfolobus solfataricus minichromosome maintenance (SsoMCM) helicase has been shown to unwind DNA via a SEW mode to enhance unwinding efficiency. Using single-molecule FRET, we now show that the analogous Escherichia coli (Ec) DnaB helicase also interacts specifically with the excluded DNA strand during unwinding. Mutation of several conserved and positively charged residues on the exterior surface of EcDnaB resulted in increased interaction dynamics and states compared with wild type. Surprisingly, these mutations also increased the DNA unwinding rate, suggesting that electrostatic contacts with the excluded strand act as a regulator for unwinding activity. In support of this, experiments neutralizing the charge of the excluded strand with a morpholino substrate instead of DNA also dramatically increased the unwinding rate. Of note, although the stability of the excluded strand was nearly identical for EcDnaB and SsoMCM, these enzymes are from different superfamilies and unwind DNA with opposite polarities.

They utilize the inherent energy from ATP hydrolysis to translocate along an encircled strand, physically displacing the opposing excluded strand.

In addition to specific DNA contacts that exist within the central channel, further exterior contact sites are proposed to exist for hexameric helicases to aid in DNA loading and unwinding (2Trakselis M.A. Structural mechanisms of hexameric helicase loading, assembly, and unwinding.F1000Res. 2016; 5 (F1000 Faculty Rev-111)Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Previously, we have identified an interaction path on the external surface of the archaeal (AAA+) SsoMCM helicase with the excluded strand that both protects and stabilizes the complex in a forward unwinding mode (11Graham B.W.

This interaction expanded the widely accepted SE model of unwinding to include contributions of the excluded strand in the mechanism. This new unwinding model was termed steric exclusion and wrapping (SEW).

It is hypothesized that external interactions with the excluded strand will not only protect ssDNA but also stabilize the helicase/DNA complex and modulate the unwinding rate. In this study, we examined whether EcDnaB has a similar specificity for exterior interactions with the excluded single-strand DNA. Single-molecule FRET (smFRET) experiments were used to directly detect EcDnaB binding to the excluded strand and to compare it with SsoMCM binding. The absolute FRET states, transition probabilities, and dwell times were strikingly similar between EcDnaB and SsoMCM even though they reside in different superfamilies and have opposite unwinding polarities. Mutation of several conserved external positively charged residues on EcDnaB differentially altered the observed FRET states and binding dynamics, consistent with disruption of the excluded strand binding path. Notably, those external SEW mutations on EcDnaB dramatically increased the dsDNA unwinding rate compared with wild type (WT). Neutralizing the negative charge on the excluded stand with a morpholino substrate increased the unwinding rate for wild-type EcDnaB, consistent with electrostatic interactions regulating activity. This is the first molecular explanation for regulation of the rate of DNA unwinding through specific external surface interactions on the helicase with the excluded strand. Previously, we have shown that interactions with the excluded strand exist for the 3′–5′ hexameric SsoMCM helicase (11Graham B.W. Schauer G.D. Leuba S.H. Trakselis M.A. Steric exclusion and wrapping of the excluded DNA strand occurs along discrete external binding paths during MCM helicase unwinding.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 6585-6595Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Graham B.W.

Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 12467-12480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Using a similar smFRET approach, we sought to examine whether analogous contacts on the exterior of EcDnaB also interact with the excluded strand despite the opposing 5′–3′ translocation polarity. Three separate model fork substrates, 30/30 (DNA43/DNA44), 40/30 (DNA111/DNA44), and 50/30 (DNA116/DNA44) composed of an 18-bp duplex with (dT)30 on the 5′-lagging strand and (dT)30, (dT)40, and (dT)50 on the 3′-leading strand, respectively, were used. DNA forks alone result in low FRET signals as a result of Cy3 and Cy5 on the termini of the fork arms not being in close proximity (Fig. 1A). Additional nucleotides on the leading strand 3′-arm of the fork further decrease the FRET efficiency as expected. Addition of EcDnaB to each of these substrates shifts the signal to higher FRET states (Fig. 1B). EcDnaB preferentially encircles the 5′-strand (3Jezewska M.J. Rajendran S. Bujalowska D. Bujalowski W. Does single-stranded DNA pass through the inner channel of the protein hexamer in the complex with the Escherichia coli DnaB Helicase? Fluorescence energy transfer studies.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10515-10529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and a titration of EcDnaB onto 30/30 showed little to no variation in the resulting histogram profiles, suggesting that only one hexamer can be accommodated by the fork substrate over a large concentration range (Fig. 1C). Should a second hexamer encircle the opposing 3′-strand, the FRET values would decrease. The occurrence of a high-FRET state is consistent with an interaction of the excluded Cy3 3′-strand on the external surface of EcDnaB, analogous to SsoMCM binding to DNA and consistent with the proposed SEW model of helicase interaction and unwinding (11Graham B.W. Schauer G.D. Leuba S.H. Trakselis M.A. Steric exclusion and wrapping of the excluded DNA strand occurs along discrete external binding paths during MCM helicase unwinding.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 6585-6595Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). EcDnaB loaded onto the 40/30 substrate produced an almost exclusively high-FRET state (>0.9), the 50/30 fork produced a bimodal distribution of high- (>0.9) and medium (∼0.5)-FRET states, and the 30/30 fork yielded a bimodal distribution of two high-FRET (0.8 and >0.9) states in the presence of EcDnaB. The interaction with the excluded strand likely differs from varying excluded strand lengths sampling slightly different external binding paths. However, in all cases, the shifts to high-FRET states correspond to a stably wrapped excluded strand that places the Cy3 dye near the Cy5 dye on the encircled strand. To better visualize the FRET states, explicit transition probabilities, and dwell times on a single plot to compare different conditions, mutants, and helicases, we developed ExPRT plots (Fig. 2A). The positions of the circular markers correspond to transitions between specific FRET states with the initial FRET state on the x axis and the final FRET state on the y axis. The initial and final FRET states for a particular transition refer to the observed FRET states immediately preceding and immediately following the transition of interest, respectively. The size and color of each marker correspond to the probability of that transition occurring within a measured trace and the average dwell time of the state preceding the transition, respectively. A comparison of analyses between established programs, the HaMMY and transition density plot (TDP) programs (Fig. 2B) (23McKinney S.A. Joo C. Ha T. Analysis of single-molecule FRET trajectories using hidden Markov modeling.Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 1941-1951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) as well as the population-weighted and kinetically indexed transition (POKIT) density program (Fig. 2C) (24Abelson J. Blanco M. Ditzler M.A. Fuller F. Aravamudhan P. Wood M. Villa T. Ryan D.E. Pleiss J.A. Maeder C. Guthrie C. Walter N.G. Conformational dynamics of single pre-mRNA molecules during in vitro splicing.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and the ExPRT program is shown. Each program analyzed and visualized identical data corresponding to EcDnaB bound to the 30/30 substrate and can distinguish states (Fig. 2D). Each plot illustrates that the transitions between FRET states of ∼0.8 and ∼0.95 are the most frequent. The TDP program analysis works on a trace-by-trace basis and is able to reveal heterogeneities in the transition data that can be missed by programs that work on stitched data sets such as the POKIT and ExPRT programs. However, despite the TDP program’s ability to gather probability and rate values, these values are not directly visualized by the resulting plot. The POKIT program bins the probabilities and rates of each transition into user-defined ranges and produces plots that allow for some level of quantitative comparison between experimental conditions. However, these plots fail to display explicit probabilities and rate values. Determining explicit transitions, probabilities, and rates without binning is an inherent advantage of single-molecule methods that allows for extensive insights into the dynamics and kinetics of molecular interactions and enzymatic activities. The ExPRT analysis program extracts these explicit values from the smFRET data and visualizes them directly in a single plot. This allows users and readers to easily make comparisons between data sets on the most detailed level. Therefore, the ExPRT plots provide a useful advance in the investigation and comparison of the probability and kinetics of smFRET dynamics. The bimodal distribution observed for EcDnaB on 30/30 fork substrate was very similar to the distribution produced by the archaeal MCM helicase on the same substrate (Fig. 3A) (11Graham B.W. Schauer G.D. Leuba S.H. Trakselis M.A. Steric exclusion and wrapping of the excluded DNA strand occurs along discrete external binding paths during MCM helicase unwinding.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 6585-6595Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In fact, the single-molecule traces for EcDnaB and SsoMCM exhibited strikingly similar dynamics between two high-FRET states (∼0.95 and ∼0.8) (Fig. 3, B and C). This is highlighted by the ExPRT plots for EcDnaB compared with SsoMCM on the 30/30 fork substrate (Fig. 3, D–F). In both cases, the excluded strand has a reversible transition between two high-FRET states (∼0.8 and ∼0.95) that is exhibited by ∼70% of the molecules analyzed. For both EcDnaB and SsoMCM, there is a preference for the ∼0.95 FRET state, indicated by the longer dwell times measured for that state (shades of orange versus green/yellow). In addition, both data sets exhibit a reversible lower probability transition between each of the high-FRET states and a medium-FRET state of ∼0.55. Altogether, it is noteworthy that similarities in the FRET states, transitions, and dwell times exist for EcDnaB and SsoMCM on the 30/30 fork even though these two helicases belong to different superfamilies with low sequence homology, exist in different domains of life (Bacteria versus Archaea), and have opposite unwinding polarities. The similarities are suggestive of a common SEW unwinding mechanism across diverse replicative helicases. As positively charged residues on the surface of SsoMCM had previously been shown to support an external interaction with the excluded strand (11Graham B.W. Schauer G.D. Leuba S.H. Trakselis M.A. Steric exclusion and wrapping of the excluded DNA strand occurs along discrete external binding paths during MCM helicase unwinding.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 6585-6595Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), similar surface-exposed and conserved residues were identified based on a homology model for EcDnaB (Fig. 4). Four EcDnaB surface positions (Arg-74, Arg-164, Lys-180, and Arg-328/Arg-329) that exist in positively charged electrostatic patches were mutated to alanine, overexpressed, and purified. All mutant proteins were consistent with a hexamer as the major peak after gel filtration (data not shown). smFRET DNA fork binding assays were performed for the wild type and each mutant on each of the three fork templates (30/30, 40/30, and 50/30). The results were analyzed and compared using traditional histograms and ExPRT plots. The mutations gave rise to several important differences in the hexamer-excluded strand interactions and dynamics. Across all the excluded strand lengths tested, EcDnaB (R74A) does not sample the highest observed FRET state (Eapp = ∼0.95) observed for the WT and the other mutants. This can be seen clearly in the histograms (Fig. 5, B versus A) and the ExPRT plots (Fig. 5, G, L, and Q versus F, K, and P). R74A also produces fewer transitions between FRET states compared with the WT for the 30/30 and 40/30 forks because the most frequent transitions observed for the WT data are those between the highest FRET state (Eapp = ∼0.95) and lower FRET states. The absence of the 0.95 FRET state for R74A across all substrates tested suggests that Arg-74 is necessary to close the connection of the excluded strand to the NTD traversing the entire longitudinal length of EcDnaB (9Itsathitphaisarn O.

Corresponding ExPRT plots are shown for 30/30 (F–J), 40/30 (K–O), and 50/30 (P–T) forks for each of the respective EcDnaB helicases.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) EcDnaB (K180A) bound to the 30/30 fork produces similar FRET states and dynamics when compared with the WT EcDnaB; however, there are now five states compared with three (Fig. 5, I versus F). Examples traces for individual molecules for WT compared with K180A as well as other mutants are shown in Fig. 6. As an example, for molecule 51, there are 10 transitions between two states, and for molecule 177, there are 17 transitions between three states. A greater number of FRET states and transitions are indicative of a less stable and less precise interaction between the exterior surface of the helicase and the excluded strand, leading to alternative binding paths. Similarly, the R164A mutant also samples a greater number of states than WT on the 40/30 (five versus two states) and 50/30 substrates (four versus two states) (Fig. 5, M and R versus K and P). The ExPRT plots for both K180A (Fig. 5, I versus F) and R164A (Fig. 5, H and F) on the 30/30 substrate somewhat resemble the WT on the same substrate. However, the histograms of K180A and R164A (Fig. 5, C and D) show populations that are broader than those seen for the WT and R74A (Fig. 5, A and B), which is indicative of less stable or precise interactions between the helicase and the excluded strand as visualized in the ExPRT plots. For the R164A mutation on the 30/30 substrate (Fig. 5H), the most probable transitions occur at approximately the same rate reversibly. Similar to the WT, K180A on 40/30 and 50/30 substrates show fewer transitions to and from the high-FRET state and a significantly longer dwell time for the high-FRET state (Fig. 5, N and S). This may indicate greater stabilization of an interaction toward the NTD of the helicase. Therefore, Lys-180 and Arg-164 contribute to but do not solely mediate the helicase-excluded strand interactions that give rise to the FRET states we observe for the WT. The EcDnaB (R328A/R329A) mutant shows similar FRET state transitions, probabilities of those transitions, and dwell times on the 30/30 fork when compared with the WT (Fig. 5, J versus F). However, there are extreme differences in the binding states and dynamics on the longer DNA strands compared with WT (Fig. 5, T versus P). WT EcDnaB bound to the 50/30 fork shows a small fraction of traces that transition between high- and medium-FRET states. In comparison, EcDnaB (R328A/R329A) produces almost entirely medium-FRET states that are very dynamic with many transitions and relatively short dwell times, indicative of severe destabilization of binding. In contrast to WT, very little high-FRET signal from the R328A/R329A mutant on the 30/50 substrate is observed. These results indicate that Arg-328 and Arg-329 may be required to stabilize longer excluded strands (40- and 50-mers) along the waist of the hexamer and mediate interactions between the excluded strand and other regions such as NTD where Arg-74 is located and responsible for the highest FRET state (Eapp = ∼0.95). Although we primarily tested the effect of eliminating positive charge on the exterior surface of EcDnaB and its effect on excluded strand binding, there may also be additional noncovalent binding interactions defining a path. To directly test whether electrostatic interactions exclusively define the excluded strand binding path, we titrated NaCl into WTEcDnaB prebound to a 30/30 fork in our smFRET experiments. Increased salt concentrations resulted in increased dynamics (shorter dwell times), but the FRET states were not significantly affected as visualized using ExPRT plots (Fig. 7). Even though the FRET states and transition probabilities remained constant, the decreased dwell times suggest that EcDnaB utilizes electrostatic interactions to mediate wrapping but that other noncovalent interactions are also important. Mutating positively charged residues involved in the excluded strand interaction inhibited SsoMCM’s unwinding activity (11Graham B.W. Schauer G.D. Leuba S.H.

https://openalex.org/W2759957374,"Previously, we showed that Killer Immunoglobulin-like Receptor (KIR)3DS1 homozygotes (hmz) are more frequent in HIV exposed seronegative (HESN) than in recently HIV infected (HIV+) individuals. KIR3DS1 encodes an activating Natural Killer (NK) cell receptor (NKR). The link between KIR genotype and HIV outcomes likely arises from the function that NK cells acquire through expression of particular NKRs. An initial screen of 97 HESN and 123 HIV+ subjects for the frequency of KIR region gene carriage observed between-group differences for several telomeric KIR region loci. In a larger set of up to 106 HESN and 439 HIV+ individuals, more HESN than HIV+ subjects were KIR3DS1 homozygotes, lacked a full length KIR2DS4 gene and carried the telomeric group B KIR haplotype motif, TB01. TB01 is characterized by the presence of KIR3DS1, KIR2DL5A, KIR2DS3/5 and KIR2DS1, in linkage disequilibrium with each other. We assessed which of the TB01 encoded KIR gene products contributed to NK cell responsiveness by stimulating NK cells from 8 HIV seronegative KIR3DS1 and TB01 motif homozygotes with 721.221 HLA null cells and evaluating the frequency of KIR3DS1+/-KIR2DL5+/-, KIR3DS1+/-KIR2DS1+/-, KIR3DS1+/-KIR2DS5+/- NK cells secreting IFN-γ and/or expressing CD107a. A higher frequency of NK cells expressing, versus not, KIR3DS1 responded to 721.221 stimulation. KIR2DL5A+, KIR2DS1+ and KIR2DS5+ NK cells did not contribute to 721.221 responses or modulate those by KIR3DS1+ NK cells. Thus, of the TB01 KIR gene products, only KIR3DS1 conferred responsiveness to HLA-null stimulation, demonstrating its ligation can activate ex vivo NK cells"

The objective of this study was to analyze the spatial distribution of CL in Paraná between 2001 and 2015, based on data from the Sistema de Informação de Agravos de Notificação (Information System for Notifiable Diseases) regarding autochthonous CL cases. Spatial autocorrelation was performed using Moran’s Global Index and the Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA). The construction of maps was based on categories of association (high-high, low-low, high-low, and low-high). A total of 4,557 autochthonous cases of CL were registered in the state of Paraná, with an annual average of 303.8 (± 135.2) and a detection coefficient of 2.91. No correlation was found between global indices and their respective significance in 2001 (I = -0.456, p = 0.676), but evidence of spatial autocorrelation was found in other years (p< 0.05). In the construction and analysis of the cluster maps, areas with a high-high positive association were found in the Ivaí-Pirapó, Tibagi, Cinzas-Laranjinha, and Ribeira areas. The state of Paraná should keep a constant surveillance over CL due to the prominent presence of socioeconomic and environmental factors such as the favorable circumstances for the vectors present in peri-urban and agriculture áreas."
https://openalex.org/W2760143502,"If you are a cancer researcher, chances are you’ve been asked by your relatives and friends, or even that inquisitive passenger sitting next to you on an airplane, about cures for cancer. Is there one for this cancer? Does that drug really work? Needless to say, the recent success of immune checkpoint inhibitors ignites much discussion and hope. Lately, the curiosity turns to “can you tell me what CAR-T is”? As curious as it might be, CAR-T does not really have an automobile origin, let alone the Ford Model T. It is a type of gene- and cell-based immunotherapy that utilizes chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. But beyond that, let’s just say that both the curiosity and the analogy are rather justifiable. Only 3 weeks ago, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel, formerly known as CTL019), a CAR-T therapy, for children and young adult patients with refractory or relapsing B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Calling it “a historic action” by the FDA, this approval not only “brings the first gene therapy to the United States” but also marks “a new frontier in medical innovation with the ability to reprogram a patient’s own cells to attack a deadly cancer,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb (U.S. Food & Drug Administration, 2017U.S. Food & Drug Administration (2017). FDA approval brings first gene therapy to the United States [Press Release]. Retrieved from https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm574058.htm.Google Scholar). For the first time, we now have a medicine that is powered by a “live engine”—living cells—and has a good number of moving parts built into it. CAR-T cells are living T cells genetically engineered to express synthetic, target-specific chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) on the cell surface. In the case of tisagenlecleucel, the CAR-T cells are autologous T cells coming from the patients themselves, modified to be CD19-targeting, a critical step that needs to be done in a manufacturing center. Engineered T cells are then sent back to the hospital where they can be reinfused to the same patient to perform the magic trick: recognize the target antigen present on tumor cells of the patient, proliferate, and kill the tumor cells upon antigen contact. Why CD19? CD19 is a surface antigen highly expressed in many B cell leukemias and lymphomas, enabling the clinical efficacy of CD19-targeting CAR-T cells. Interestingly, complete remission of a brain metastasis was observed in a patient with primary refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) participating in a clinical trial of another CD19-targeting CAR-T therapy (JCAR017), the first case of a CAR-T response in a central nervous system lymphoma (Abramson et al., 2017Abramson J.S. McGree B. Noyes S. Plummer S. Wong C. Chen Y.B. Palmer E. Albertson T. Ferry J.A. Arrillaga-Romany I.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 2017; 377: 783-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). More remarkably, when a subcutaneous lesion developed two months after the initial infusion and a biopsy was performed, the anti-CD19 CAR-T cells spontaneously reexpanded in vivo and the tumor abated without further treatment. Identifying the underlying mechanism and designing strategies to reactivate CAR-T cells with prolonged antitumor activity will be of tremendous interest. One unique and major bottleneck for the current CAR-T procedure is the isolation, storage, and manufacturing of the T cells, as mentioned earlier, whether they be autologous (patient’s own) or allogenic (from healthy donors as an “off-the-shelf” product), and the safety and cost concerns that are associated with these steps. Matthias Stephan and colleagues recently made biodegradable polymer-based nanoparticles that can target T cells. When loaded with DNA designed to render host T cells to express a specific CAR, these nanocarriers can efficiently program the host’s T cells and exert therapeutic efficacy in an immunocompetent mouse model of B cell ALL (Smith et al., 2017aSmith T.T. Stephan S.B. Moffett H.F. McKnight L.E. Ji W. Reiman D. Bonagofski E. Wohlfahrt M.E. Pillai S.P.S. Stephan M.T. Nat. Nanotechnol. 2017; 12: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The new approach, therefore, has the potential to eliminate the need to isolate T cells from people, simplify the storage, and reduce treatment cost. Innovations in biomaterials and immunoengineering will be a key in the future development of CAR-T therapy and other “living drugs.” It also remains to be seen whether CAR-T can work equally well in solid tumors, which account for the majority of human cancers and whose complex microenvironment and heterogeneity present formidable challenges at multiple levels for the design and the effectiveness of the CAR-T cells. Brown et al. recently reported that a patient with recurrent multifocal glioblastoma showed regression of all intracranial and spinal tumors after multiple infusions of IL13Rα2-specific CAR-T cells (Brown et al., 2016Brown C.E. Alizadeh D. Starr R. Weng L. Wagner J.R. Naranjo A. Ostberg J.R. Blanchard M.S. Kilpatrick J. Simpson J. et al.N. Engl. J. Med. 2016; 375: 2561-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). The clinical response also continued for 7.5 months after therapy initiation. In another clinical study of patients with recurrent glioblastoma, a single dose of autologous EGFRvIII-targeting CAR-T cells was intravenously administered to patients. The clinical experience of the first ten patients treated suggests that intravenous infusion achieves on-target activity in the brain with no evidence of off-tumor toxicity or cytokine release syndrome, which can be significant safety concerns. However, it also reveals that the microenvironment seems to become more immunosuppressive. Strategies to overcome the adaptive changes and the antigen heterogeneity observed are still needed in this setting (O’Rourke et al., 2017O’Rourke D.M. Nasrallah M.P. Desai A. Melenhorst J.J. Mansfield K. Morrissette J.J.D. Martinez-Lage M. Brem S. Maloney E. Shen A. et al.Sci. Transl. Med. 2017; 9: eaaa0984Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). In another clever study, Matthias Stephan and colleagues tested a strategy to improve CAR-T’s efficacy in solid tumors. Implantable biopolymer devices were designed to codeliverer both engineered CAR T cells directly to the surfaces of solid tumors and STING agonists to locally boost immune response. The goal is to combat solid tumors’ immunosuppressive microenvironment and eliminate tumors cells that don’t express the targeted antigen. In immunocompetent orthotopic mouse models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and melanoma, the strategy led to tumor regression and prolonged survival (Smith et al., 2017bSmith T.T. Moffett H.F. Stephan S.B. Opel C.F. Dumigan A.G. Jiang X. Pillarisetty V.G. Pillai S.P.S. Wittrup K.D. Stephan M.T. J. Clin. Invest. 2017; 127: 2176-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). A hundred years ago, Henry Ford’s Model T forever transformed the American way of living and going places. He did it with innovations and the achievement of large-scale, assembly-line manufacturing capability. Time will tell whether CAR-T will be a new “Model T” on the horizon and with what we already witnessed, there is much to look forward to."

https://openalex.org/W2758076242,"c-Jun, c-Jun N-terminal kinase(JNK) and endothelin B (ETB) receptor have been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of glaucoma. Previously, we reported that an increase of c-Jun and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β (C/EBPβ) immunohistostaining is associated with upregulation of the ETB receptor within the ganglion cell layer of rats with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). In addition, both transcription factors regulate the expression of the ETB receptor in human non-pigmented ciliary epithelial cells (HNPE). The current study addressed the mechanisms by which ET-1 produced upregulation of ET receptors in primary rat retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and HNPE cells. Treatment of ET-1 and ET-3 increased the immunocytochemical staining of c-Jun and C/EBPβ in primary rat RGCs and co-localization of both transcription factors was observed. A marked increase in DNA binding activity of AP-1 and C/EBPβ as well as elevated protein levels of c-Jun and c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) were detected following ET-1 treatment in HNPE cells. Overexpression of ETA or ETB receptor promoted the upregulation of c-Jun and also elevated its promoter activity. In addition, upregulation of C/EBPβ augmented DNA binding and mRNA expression of c-Jun, and furthermore, the interaction of c-Jun and C/EBPβ was confirmed using co-immunoprecipitation. Apoptosis of HNPE cells was identified following ET-1 treatment, and overexpression of the ETA or ETB receptor produced enhanced apoptosis. ET-1 mediated upregulation of c-Jun and C/EBPβ and their interaction may represent a novel mechanism contributing to the regulation of endothelin receptor expression. Reciprocally, c-Jun was also found to regulate the ET receptors and C/EBPβ appeared to play a regulatory role in promoting expression of c-Jun. Taken together, the data suggests that ET-1 triggers the upregulation of c-Jun through both ETA and ETB receptors, and conversely c-Jun also upregulates endothelin receptor expression, thereby generating a positive feed-forward loop of endothelin receptor activation and expression. This feed-forward regulation may contribute to RGC death and astrocyte proliferation following ET-1 treatment."

In the present study, we evaluated whether balance maintenance can be improved with the use of stochastic resonance whole body vibration (SR-WBV).An examination of balance, involving 187 women aged 19-74 years, was conducted using double-plate posturography pre and post SR-WBV. The SR-WBV trainings were performed using the SRT Zeptor Medical-plus noise device. The entire study lasted 6 weeks, with a total of 12 training sessions, each consisting of nine 45 second series, with a 45 second pause between them.Post SR-WBV there was a reduction in the value of: the resultant mean velocity (MV) of the movement of COP (centre of pressure) for both lower limbs (B) and in the right lower limb (R) during the test with eyes closed (EC), the mean velocity and mean amplitude (MA) of the movement of COP along the x-axis (ML) of the left lower limb (L) during the test with eyes open (EO) and closed and some additional parameters. Negative correlations between age/index of improvement of MV-EC-B, MV-EC-L and MVML-EC-L, and BMI/index of improvement of MV-EC-B, MVML-EC-B appeared. Height correlated positively with the index of improvement of MV-EC-B and MVML-EC-B.As a result of SR-WBV, the left leg is more stable along the x-axis and the disproportion between the stability of both legs is reduced. Consequently, body stability is higher. The SR-WBV is more effective in younger, taller and slimmer women. SR-WBV parameters should be optimized so that the training is more beneficial for elderly and shorter women, and for women with a higher BMI."

https://openalex.org/W2758708279,"ATP binding cassette type-C (ABCC) transporters move molecules across cell membranes upon hydrolysis of ATP; however, their coupling of ATP hydrolysis to substrate transport remains elusive. Drosophila multidrug resistance-associated protein (DMRP) is the functional ortholog of human long ABCC transporters, with similar substrate and inhibitor specificity, but higher activity. Exploiting its high activity, we kinetically dissected the catalytic mechanism of DMRP by using E2-d-glucuronide (E2G), the physiologic substrate of human ABCC. We examined the DMRP-mediated interdependence of ATP and E2G in biochemical assays. We observed E2G-dependent ATPase activity to be biphasic at subsaturating ATP concentrations, which implies at least 2 E2G binding sites on DMRP. Furthermore, transport measurements indicated strong nonreciprocal cooperativity between ATP and E2G. In addition to confirming these findings, our kinetic modeling with the Complex Pathway Simulator indicated a 10-fold decrease in the E2G-mediated activation of ATP hydrolysis upon saturation of the second E2G binding site. Surprisingly, the binding of the second E2G allowed for substrate transport with a constant rate, which tightly coupled ATP hydrolysis to transport. In summary, we show that the second E2G binding-similar to human ABCC2-allosterically stimulates transport activity of DMRP. Our data suggest that this is achieved by a significant increase in the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to transport.-Karasik, A., Ledwitch, K. V., Arányi, T., Váradi, A., Roberts, A., Szeri, F.

https://openalex.org/W2760154283,"Most types of crime are known to exhibit seasonal oscillations, yet the annual variations in the amplitude of this seasonality and their causes are still uncertain. Using a large collection of data from the Houston and Los Angeles Metropolitan areas, we extract and study the seasonal variations in aggravated assault, break in and theft from vehicles, burglary, grand theft auto, rape, robbery, theft, and vandalism for many years from the raw daily data. Our approach allows us to see various long term and seasonal trends and aberrations in crime rates that have not been reported before. We then apply an ecologically motivated stochastic differential equation to reproduce the data. Our model relies only on social interaction terms, and not on any exigent factors, to reproduce both the seasonality, and the seasonal aberrations observed in our data set. Furthermore, the stochasticity in the system is sufficient to reproduce the variations seen in the seasonal oscillations from year to year. Researchers should be very careful about trying to correlate these oscillations with external factors."
