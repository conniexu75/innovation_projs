https://openalex.org/W2115605381,"Doil Choi and colleagues report the genome sequence of the hot pepper, Capsicum annuum, as well as the resequencing of two cultivated peppers and a wild species, Capsicum chinense. Comparative genomic analysis across Solanaceae provides insights into genome expansion, pungency, ripening and disease resistance in hot peppers. Hot pepper (Capsicum annuum), one of the oldest domesticated crops in the Americas, is the most widely grown spice crop in the world. We report whole-genome sequencing and assembly of the hot pepper (Mexican landrace of Capsicum annuum cv. CM334) at 186.6× coverage. We also report resequencing of two cultivated peppers and de novo sequencing of the wild species Capsicum chinense. The genome size of the hot pepper was approximately fourfold larger than that of its close relative tomato, and the genome showed an accumulation of Gypsy and Caulimoviridae family elements. Integrative genomic and transcriptomic analyses suggested that change in gene expression and neofunctionalization of capsaicin synthase have shaped capsaicinoid biosynthesis. We found differential molecular patterns of ripening regulators and ethylene synthesis in hot pepper and tomato. The reference genome will serve as a platform for improving the nutritional and medicinal values of Capsicum species."
https://openalex.org/W2134957137,"A new algorithm learns features of chromatin profiles left by transcription factors, shedding light on when DNA sequence motifs are bound. We describe protein interaction quantitation (PIQ), a computational method for modeling the magnitude and shape of genome-wide DNase I hypersensitivity profiles to identify transcription factor (TF) binding sites. Through the use of machine-learning techniques, PIQ identified binding sites for >700 TFs from one DNase I hypersensitivity analysis followed by sequencing (DNase-seq) experiment with accuracy comparable to that of chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq). We applied PIQ to analyze DNase-seq data from mouse embryonic stem cells differentiating into prepancreatic and intestinal endoderm. We identified 120 and experimentally validated eight 'pioneer' TF families that dynamically open chromatin. Four pioneer TF families only opened chromatin in one direction from their motifs. Furthermore, we identified 'settler' TFs whose genomic binding is principally governed by proximity to open chromatin. Our results support a model of hierarchical TF binding in which directional and nondirectional pioneer activity shapes the chromatin landscape for population by settler TFs."
https://openalex.org/W1991918456,"Activation of myofibroblast rich stroma is a rate-limiting step essential for cancer progression. The responsible factors are not fully understood, but TGFβ1 is probably critical. A proportion of TGFβ1 is associated with extracellular nano-vesicles termed exosomes, secreted by carcinoma cells, and the relative importance of soluble and vesicular TGFβ in stromal activation is presented. Prostate cancer exosomes triggered TGFβ1-dependent fibroblast differentiation, to a distinctive myofibroblast phenotype resembling stromal cells isolated from cancerous prostate tissue; supporting angiogenesis in vitro and accelerating tumour growth in vivo. Myofibroblasts generated using soluble TGFβ1 were not pro-angiogenic or tumour-promoting. Cleaving heparan sulphate side chains from the exosome surface had no impact on TGFβ levels yet attenuated SMAD-dependent signalling and myofibroblastic differentiation. Eliminating exosomes from the cancer cell secretome, targeting Rab27a, abolished differentiation and lead to failure in stroma-assisted tumour growth in vivo. Exosomal TGFβ1 is therefore required for the formation of tumour-promoting stroma."

A model protein, thioredoxin, was phosphorylated at two adjacent sites. Analysis of the ionic current amplitude and noise, as the protein unfolds and moves through an α-hemolysin pore, enables the distinction between unphosphorylated, monophosphorylated and diphosphorylated variants. Our results provide a step toward nanopore proteomics."
https://openalex.org/W2078677190,"Spontaneous Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores is important for various physiological and pathological processes. In cardiac muscle cells, spontaneous store overload-induced Ca(2+) release (SOICR) can result in Ca(2+) waves, a major cause of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTs) and sudden death. The molecular mechanism underlying SOICR has been a mystery for decades. Here we show that a point mutation, E4872A, in the helix bundle crossing region (the proposed gate) of the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) completely abolishes luminal, but not cytosolic, Ca(2+) activation of RyR2. The introduction of metal-binding histidines at this site converts RyR2 into a luminal Ni(2+)-gated channel. Mouse hearts harboring a heterozygous RyR2 mutation at this site (E4872Q) are resistant to SOICR and are completely protected against Ca(2+)-triggered VTs. These data show that the RyR2 gate directly senses luminal (store) Ca(2+), explaining the regulation of RyR2 by luminal Ca(2+), the initiation of Ca(2+) waves and Ca(2+)-triggered arrhythmias. This newly identified store-sensing gate structure is conserved in all RyR and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor isoforms."
https://openalex.org/W2080212479,"Mutations in the metabolic enzymes isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) and IDH2 that produce the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) occur frequently in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML). 2-HG modulates numerous biological pathways implicated in malignant transformation, but the contribution of mutant IDH proteins to maintenance and progression of AML in vivo is currently unknown. To answer this crucial question we have generated transgenic mice that express IDH2(R140Q) in an on/off- and tissue-specific manner using a tetracycline-inducible system. We found that IDH2(R140Q) can cooperate with overexpression of HoxA9 and Meis1a and with mutations in FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) to drive acute leukemia in vivo. Critically, we show that genetic deinduction of mutant IDH2 in leukemic cells in vivo has profound effects on their growth and/or maintenance. Our data demonstrate the proto-oncogenic role of mutant IDH2 and support its relevance as a therapeutic target for the treatment of human AML."
https://openalex.org/W1974741591,"Although the prefrontal cortex influences motivated behavior, its role in food intake remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate a role for D1-type dopamine receptor-expressing neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in the regulation of feeding. Food intake increases activity in D1 neurons of the mPFC in mice, and optogenetic photostimulation of D1 neurons increases feeding. Conversely, inhibition of D1 neurons decreases intake. Stimulation-based mapping of prefrontal D1 neuron projections implicates the medial basolateral amygdala (mBLA) as a downstream target of these afferents. mBLA neurons activated by prefrontal D1 stimulation are CaMKII positive and closely juxtaposed to prefrontal D1 axon terminals. Finally, photostimulating these axons in the mBLA is sufficient to increase feeding, recapitulating the effects of mPFC D1 stimulation. These data describe a new circuit for top-down control of food intake."
https://openalex.org/W2046649749,"Makedonka Mitreva and colleagues report the genome sequence and transcriptome analysis of the hookworm Necator americanus, a prevalent soil-transmitted human parasite and the cause of necatoriasis. They develop a hookworm protein microarray to examine the host parasite interaction and immune response, tested on blood samples from 200 individuals in an endemic region. The hookworm Necator americanus is the predominant soil-transmitted human parasite. Adult worms feed on blood in the small intestine, causing iron-deficiency anemia, malnutrition, growth and development stunting in children, and severe morbidity and mortality during pregnancy in women. We report sequencing and assembly of the N. americanus genome (244 Mb, 19,151 genes). Characterization of this first hookworm genome sequence identified genes orchestrating the hookworm's invasion of the human host, genes involved in blood feeding and development, and genes encoding proteins that represent new potential drug targets against hookworms. N. americanus has undergone a considerable and unique expansion of immunomodulator proteins, some of which we highlight as potential treatments against inflammatory diseases. We also used a protein microarray to demonstrate a postgenomic application of the hookworm genome sequence. This genome provides an invaluable resource to boost ongoing efforts toward fundamental and applied postgenomic research, including the development of new methods to control hookworm and human immunological diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1963782724,"The production of hydrocarbons in nature has been documented for only a limited set of organisms, with many of the molecular components underpinning these processes only recently identified. There is an obvious scope for application of these catalysts and engineered variants thereof in the future production of biofuels. Here we present biochemical characterization and crystal structures of a cytochrome P450 fatty acid peroxygenase: the terminal alkene forming OleTJE (CYP152L1) from Jeotgalicoccus sp. 8456. OleTJE is stabilized at high ionic strength, but aggregation and precipitation of OleTJE in low salt buffer can be turned to advantage for purification, because resolubilized OleTJE is fully active and extensively dissociated from lipids. OleTJE binds avidly to a range of long chain fatty acids, and structures of both ligand-free and arachidic acid-bound OleTJE reveal that the P450 active site is preformed for fatty acid binding. OleTJE heme iron has an unusually positive redox potential (−103 mV versus normal hydrogen electrode), which is not significantly affected by substrate binding, despite extensive conversion of the heme iron to a high spin ferric state. Terminal alkenes are produced from a range of saturated fatty acids (C12–C20), and stopped-flow spectroscopy indicates a rapid reaction between peroxide and fatty acid-bound OleTJE (167 s−1 at 200 μm H2O2). Surprisingly, the active site is highly similar in structure to the related P450BSβ, which catalyzes hydroxylation of fatty acids as opposed to decarboxylation.

These hemoproteins are found in virtually all organisms, from bacteria and archaea to humans, and are responsible for several chemical transformations that are essential, for instance, in the microbial biosynthesis of antibiotics (e.g. erythromycin in Saccharopolyspora erythraea and vancomycin in Amycolatopsis orientalis) (2Cupp-Vickery J.R.

The majority of characterized P450s are monooxygenases that interact with one or more redox partners to provide them with the two electrons (typically derived from NAD(P)H) required for oxidative catalysis (6Munro A.W. Girvan H.M. McLean K.J. Cytochrome P450-redox partner fusion enzymes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1770: 345-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The first electron reduces the P450 cysteine thiolate-coordinated heme iron from ferric to ferrous, enabling dioxygen binding to the ferrous iron. The second electron reduces the resulting ferric-superoxo complex to the ferric-peroxo state. Two successive protonations produce first the ferric-hydroperoxo species (compound 0) and then (following the loss of a water molecule) the ferryl-oxo compound I (7Denisov I.G. Makris T.M. Sligar S.G. Schlichting I. Structure and chemistry of cytochrome P450.Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 2253-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The transient and highly reactive nature of compound I prevented its definitive characterization for many years, until Rittle and Green (8Rittle J. Green M.T. Cytochrome P450 compound I. Capture, characterization, and C–H bond activation kinetics.Science. 2010; 330: 933-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar) produced compound I in a large yield following rapid mixing of CYP119 (from the thermoacidophilic crenarchaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius) with the oxidant m-chloroperbenzoic acid and confirmed its identity using Mössbauer, EPR, and UV-visible spectroscopy. Compound I is considered to be the major oxidizing species in the P450 catalytic cycle and to be responsible for the bulk of oxidative reactions (e.g. hydroxylation, epoxidation, oxidative demethylation, etc.) observed throughout the P450 superfamily (9Guengerich F.P.

The vast majority of P450s use NAD(P)H-dependent redox systems consisting of either (i) an FAD-binding reductase that shuttles electrons to the P450 via a ferredoxin (or a flavodoxin in a small number of cases) or (ii) an FAD- and FMN-binding cytochrome P450 reductase, the individual flavin-binding domains of which are evolutionarily related to NAD(P)H-binding ferredoxin oxidoreductases and flavodoxins (5Munro A.W.

However, other types of P450 redox partner systems exist (e.g. P450-redox partner fusion enzymes, such as the CYP116B family of P450:phthalate dioxygenase reductase fusions) (12Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Oxygen activation and reactivity.in: Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1995: 245-303Crossref Google Scholar). In addition, other P450s catalyze isomerization (e.g. mammalian thromboxane synthase, CYP5A1) and dehydration (e.g. flax allene oxide synthase, CYP74A1) reactions that do not require an external source of electrons and which are completed entirely within the P450 active site (13Warman A.J.

Further, through exploration of in vitro routes to driving P450 catalysis, it is now well established that the addition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or organic peroxides (e.g. cumene hydroperoxide) to P450s can facilitate substrate oxidation by directly producing compound 0, which is then protonated to generate compound I (15Song W.C. Brash A.R. Purification of an allene oxide synthase and identification of the enzyme as a cytochrome P-450.Science. 1991; 253: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). This “peroxide shunt” procedure is rarely an efficient means of driving P450s, because the peroxides oxidize heme and protein. However, a small number of P450s that have evolved to exploit the peroxide shunt are now known. Notably, the Bacillus subtilis CYP152A1 (P450BSβ) and the Sphingomonas paucimobilis CYP152B1 (P450SPα) naturally use H2O2 to catalyze long chain fatty acid hydroxylation and are thus referred to as peroxygenases (16Lee D.-S.

P450SPα catalyzes nearly exclusively hydroxylation at the α-position, whereas P450BSβ catalyzes hydroxylation at α- and β-positions but with the majority at the β-position (∼60:40 ratio) (16Lee D.-S.

ATCC 8456 (OleTJE) that is 41% identical in amino sequence to P450BSβ and 37% identical to P450SPα. OleTJE was identified as a P450 based on this sequence similarity and designated by the authors as a CYP152 P450 family member (18Rude M.A. Baron T.S. Brubaker S. Alibhai M. Del Cardayre S.B.

The Jeotgalicoccus ATCC 8456 host strain was shown to produce a number of C18–C20 linear and branched chain terminal alkenes, and other Jeotgalicoccus strains were shown to generate a similar spectrum of terminal alkenes in the C18–C21 range. A His-tagged version of OleTJE was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column chromatography and shown to catalyze formation of n-1 alkenes through H2O2-dependent decarboxylation of C14, C16, C18, and C20 saturated fatty acids (18Rude M.A. Baron T.S.

In view of the potential importance of the OleTJE enzyme as a producer of terminal alkenes for exploitation in areas such as biofuels and fine chemical production, we have undertaken a study of the biochemical and biophysical properties of the isolated OleTJE (CYP152L1) enzyme and have determined its crystal structure in complex with arachidic acid. These data reveal novel properties of this biotechnologically important P450 peroxygenase. These include (i) the high catalytic efficiency of OleTJE and its capacity to be resolubilized from a precipitated form as a fully active enzyme, (ii) the extensive development of high spin (HS) heme iron in OleTJE on binding various long chain fatty acids (distinguishing it from related bacterial peroxygenases), and (iii) its unusually positive heme iron reduction potential, which is also negligibly affected by fatty acid binding despite the substrate inducing extensive HS ferric heme iron formation. The OleTJE sequence and additional members of the CYP152 family, including all known subfamilies, were BLAST-searched against a set of all the prokaryotic P450 sequences. Members of the highest scoring CYP families from these searches were used to build a tree. Sequence alignments were computed using ClustalW and checked manually for consistent alignment of known CYP motifs. Neighbor-joining trees were generated with the Phylip package (version 3.6; distributed by the author, J. Felsenstein (University of Washington, Seattle)) using ProtDist (a program in Phylip) to compute difference matrices. Trees were drawn and colored with FigTree version 1.3.1 (available on the World Wide Web) and labeled in Adobe Illustrator CS version 11.0.0 (Adobe Systems Inc.). Sequences producing long branches on the tree were removed, and the tree was recomputed. The gene encoding OleTJE from Jeotgalicoccus sp. ATCC 8456 was codon-optimized (for expression in E. coli), synthesized, and cloned into the pET47b (Merck Millipore, Madison, WI) vector by GenScript. The E. coli strain C41 (DE3) (Lucigen, Middleton, WI) was used as the expression host. Cells transformed with the pET47b-OleTJE plasmid were grown at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm in total volumes of 500 ml to 3 liters of 2YT broth containing kanamycin (30 μg/ml) supplemented with 500 μm δ-aminolevulinic acid. Expression of OleTJE was induced by the addition of 100 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when an optical density of 0.5 (at 600 nm) was reached, at which point the incubation temperature was lowered to 25 °C, and the cells were grown for a further 16 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 rpm, 4 °C, using a JLA-8.1000 rotor in an Avanti J-26 XP centrifuge. Pellets were resuspended in a minimal volume of ice-cold buffer A (100 mm potassium phosphate (KPi), pH 8.0), combined, and centrifuged as before. The cell pellet was then frozen at −80 °C until required. Cells were thawed at 4 °C and resuspended in 3 volumes of extraction buffer/g of cell pellet. The extraction buffer consisted of buffer A containing 1 m NaCl, 20% glycerol, with a CompleteTM EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science) per 50 ml of cell suspension, DNase I (100 μg/ml, bovine pancreas, Sigma-Aldrich), and lysozyme (100 μg/ml, hen egg white, Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were disrupted by two passes through a French press (Thermo Scientific, Hemel Hempstead, UK), and the homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 rpm, 4 °C, for 90 min using a JA-25.50 rotor. Alternatively, cells were lysed by sonication using a Bandelin Sonopuls sonicator set to 45% amplitude with 30 30-s pulses, at 60-s intervals, with the cell suspension kept on ice throughout. The homogenate was then centrifuged as previously. The supernatant was removed, and the pH was reset to 8.0 as necessary. The sample was then incubated overnight with 10 ml (per 100 g of cell pellet) of nickel-iminodiacetic acid (Ni-IDA) chromatographic medium (Generon, Maidenhead, UK) on a rolling table at 4 °C. The mixture was then poured into a column, and the collected bed of OleTJE-bound medium was washed with 10 column volumes (CV) of 100 mm KPi (pH 8.0) containing 750 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol (buffer B), and 50 mm imidazole to remove weakly bound contaminants. The column was then washed with 2 CV of the buffer B containing 125 mm imidazole, followed by 5 CV of buffer B plus 150 mm imidazole, which eluted the bulk of the OleTJE protein. The partially purified OleTJE sample was dialyzed overnight against 15 liters of buffer A at 4 °C, which caused OleTJE to precipitate. Post-dialysis, precipitated protein was isolated by centrifugation at 4000 rpm, 4 °C, using an A-4-62 rotor in an Eppendorf 5810 R centrifuge. The pellet was washed gently with 50 ml of buffer A, and centrifugation was repeated. OleTJE was resuspended in 5 ml of buffer A containing 1 m NaCl and 10% glycerol, which produced OleTJE at high purity (Method 1). For OleTJE destined for crystallographic studies, HRV 3C protease (Merck Millipore) was incubated with OleTJE for ∼16 h at 4 °C (50:1 μg of protein/unit of protease) to remove the N-terminal polyhistidine tag. The proteolysed protein was applied to 5 ml of pre-equilibrated nickel-Sepharose resin (GE Healthcare) to bind the cleaved His tag and the tagged HRV 3C. The cleaved OleTJE was eluted from the column by washing with 100 mm KPi (pH 8.0) plus 750 mm NaCl and 10% glycerol (buffer C). In separate preparations (avoiding the OleTJE precipitation step; Method 2), the dialysis step post-Ni-IDA chromatography was removed, and the OleTJE eluate was instead diluted (5×) in buffer C and concentrated in an Amicon ultrafiltration device. The OleTJE sample was then centrifuged to clarify the sample (16,000 rpm, 4 °C, using the JA-25.50 rotor), and the supernatant was then applied again to a 5-ml Ni-IDA column. The column was washed with 5 CV of buffer C containing 50 mm imidazole and then 10 CV of buffer C plus 100 mm imidazole. The His-tagged OleTJE was then eluted with 150 mm imidazole in the same buffer. All procedures generated highly purified OleTJE protein. In both cases, the pure OleTJE protein was concentrated to >20 mg/ml using a Vivaspin centrifugal concentrator (Generon), snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Analysis of the UV-visible spectroscopic properties of OleTJE was done on a Cary 60 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian UK). Spectra were recorded using ∼4–10 μm OleTJE in 100 mm KPi (pH 8.0) plus 750 mm NaCl (buffer D). Reduction of OleTJE was achieved by the addition of sodium dithionite to enzyme in buffer D made anaerobic by extensive bubbling with oxygen-free nitrogen. The ferrous-CO complex of OleTJE was formed by slow bubbling of gas into anaerobically reduced enzyme until no further absorbance change occurred. The NO complex was formed by the addition of 5–8 bubbles of NO into a sample of ferric OleTJE in anaerobic buffer. Spectral binding titrations of OleTJE with saturated fatty acids (C12, C14, C16, C18, and C20) were performed at 25 °C in buffer D. Fatty acids were from Sigma-Aldrich. Substrates (typically 0.25 mg/ml) were dissolved in 70% (v/v) EtOH (for C18 and C20) or 70% methanol (with the sodium salts of C12, C14, and C16 fatty acids) and 30% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich). A parallel set of binding titrations was also performed using fatty acids (1 mg/ml) dissolved in 100% EtOH or methanol without Triton X-100. Prior to titrations, OleTJE samples (∼50 μl at >20 mg/ml) in buffer C were passed through a Lipidx column of dimensions 5 × 1 cm (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in order to remove any residual lipid retained during purification of the protein from E. coli. OleTJE recovered from the column was in an extensively low spin (LS) ferric state and was used directly for titration at a final P450 concentration in the range from 5 to 10 μm. Titrations were performed by stepwise additions of aliquots (0.1–1 μl) of the fatty acids to the OleTJE sample (substrate additions to <1% of total volume). Spectra (800–300 nm) were recorded for the ligand-free OleTJE and following each addition of substrate using a Cary 60 UV-visible spectrophotometer. Difference spectra at each stage in the titration were computed by subtracting the spectrum of ligand-free OleTJE from each successive fatty acid-bound spectrum collected during the titration. A pair of wavelengths were identified that defined the absorbance maximum (Apeak) and minimum (Atrough) in the difference spectra from each titration set. The overall absorbance change (Amax) at each substrate concentration point was calculated as Apeak minus Atrough, and Amax was plotted versus [substrate]. These data were fitted using either a hyperbolic (Michaelis-Menten) function, the Morrison equation for tight binding ligands, or the Hill function (where sigmoidal behavior was observed) in order to determine dissociation constants (Kd values), as described previously (19McLean K.J.

Titrations and data fitting for OleTJE with dithiothreitol (DTT), imidazole, and cyanide (sodium salt) inhibitors were done in the same way as for the fatty acids, with ligands dissolved in buffer D. Stopped-flow absorption measurements were made using an Applied Photophysics SX18 MR stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Leatherhead, UK). Stopped-flow spectral accumulation was done using a photodiode array (PDA) detector on the same instrument. Fatty acid substrate-bound OleTJE was mixed versus different concentrations of H2O2 in 100 mm KPi (pH 8.0) containing 750 mm NaCl at 25 °C. OleTJE (9.2 μm) was converted to an extensively HS heme iron form by mixing with arachidic acid (12 μm) from a concentrated stock prepared in 80% EtOH, 20% Triton X-100. Reactions were initiated by mixing the arachidic acid bound OleTJE (4.6 μm final concentration) with H2O2 (3.29–200 μm final concentration). Stopped-flow traces at single wavelengths reporting on the conversion of HS OleTJE heme iron toward LS were collected over periods of up to 30 s to follow depletion of HS (390 nm) and formation of LS heme iron (418 nm). Data were analyzed and fitted using a single exponential function with the Pro-Data SX software suite (Applied Photophysics). The observed reaction rate constants (kobs values) were plotted versus the relevant H2O2 concentrations, and the resultant data plot was fitted using a linear function to obtain the second order rate constant reporting on H2O2-dependent decarboxylation of substrate and the consequent heme iron spin state conversion. Entire spectral acquisition (750–280 nm) was also done using the PDA detector for the same set of stopped-flow reactions analyzed in single wavelength mode. To determine the midpoint potential for the OleTJE Fe3+/Fe2+ couple, redox titrations were performed at 25 °C in an anaerobic glove box (Belle Technology, Weymouth, UK) under a nitrogen atmosphere with O2 levels maintained at less than 2 ppm. All solutions were deoxygenated by sparging with nitrogen gas. For substrate-free OleTJE, the titration was done using 9.3 μm OleTJE in 100 mm KPi (pH 7.0) plus 10% glycerol. For substrate-bound OleTJE, the titration was done under the same conditions, following the addition of arachidic acid (from a 32 mm stock in 80% EtOH, 20% Triton X-100) until no further conversion of the heme iron to the HS heme state was observed (∼12 μm arachidic acid). Mediators were added to expedite electronic equilibration in the system (2 μm phenazine methosulfate, 7 μm 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, 0.3 μm methyl viologen, and 1 μm benzyl viologen to mediate in the range from +100 to −480 mV versus normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)) and data fitting (using the Nernst equation), and analysis was done as described previously (21Dutton P.L.

Continuous wave X-band electron paramagnetic resonance EPR spectra of OleTJE were obtained at 10 K using a Bruker ELEXSYS E500 EPR spectrometer equipped with an ER 4122SHQ Super High Q cavity. Temperature control was effected using an Oxford Instruments ESR900 cryostat connected to an ITC 503 temperature controller. Microwave power was 0.5 milliwatt, modulation frequency was 100 kHz, and the modulation amplitude was 5 G. EPR spectra were collected for OleTJE (305 μm) in the substrate-free form and for OleTJE (205 μm) bound to arachidic (C20:0) acid (at a saturating concentration). Crystallization trials for OleTJE were performed using 400 nl (200 nl of protein plus 200 nl of precipitant) sitting drops in Art Robbins 96-well plates, using Molecular Dimensions 96-deep well crystallization screens (Clear Strategy Screen I (CSS1), Clear Strategy Screen II, PACT premier, JCSG-plus and Morpheus) and a Mosquito nanoliter pipetting robot (TTP Labtech, Melbourn, UK). Crystals formed between 2 days and 1 month at 4 °C in several conditions. The crystals giving best diffraction were formed under the following conditions: 35 mg/ml OleTJE in 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.5) containing 0.2 m MgCl2 and 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 2000 monomethyl ether (substrate-free OleTJE) and 43 mg/ml OleTJE incubated with 235 μm arachidic acid in 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.5) containing 0.2 m MgCl2, 15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 20,000 and 15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 550 mono-methyl ether (substrate-bound OleTJE). For preparation of substrate-bound OleTJE, P450 samples were concentrated by ultrafiltration, and a stock solution of arachidic acid (32 mm) dissolved in 100% EtOH was added to a final concentration of 235 μm. The concentration of EtOH did not exceed 1% of the total volume. The mother liquor was supplemented with 10% PEG 200, where an additional cryoprotectant was required, and crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen prior to data collection. Data were collected at Diamond synchrotron beamline IO4-1 and reduced and scaled using XDS (24Kabsch W.

https://openalex.org/W4249138713,"The serum response factor (SRF) binds to coactivators, such as myocardin-related transcription factor-A (MRTF-A), and mediates gene transcription elicited by diverse signaling pathways. SRF/MRTF-A-dependent gene transcription is activated when nuclear MRTF-A levels increase, enabling the formation of transcriptionally active SRF/MRTF-A complexes. The level of nuclear MRTF-A is regulated by nuclear G-actin, which binds to MRTF-A and promotes its nuclear export. However, pathways that regulate nuclear actin levels are poorly understood. Here, we show that MICAL-2, an atypical actin-regulatory protein, mediates SRF/MRTF-A-dependent gene transcription elicited by nerve growth factor and serum. MICAL-2 induces redox-dependent depolymerization of nuclear actin, which decreases nuclear G-actin and increases MRTF-A in the nucleus. Furthermore, we show that MICAL-2 is a target of CCG-1423, a small molecule inhibitor of SRF/MRTF-A-dependent transcription that exhibits efficacy in various preclinical disease models. These data identify redox modification of nuclear actin as a regulatory switch that mediates SRF/MRTF-A-dependent gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2128325220,"The ability of injured axons to regenerate declines with age, yet the mechanisms that regulate axon regeneration in response to age are not known. Here we show that axon regeneration in aging C. elegans motor neurons is inhibited by the conserved insulin/IGF1 receptor DAF-2. DAF-2's function in regeneration is mediated by intrinsic neuronal activity of the forkhead transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO. DAF-16 regulates regeneration independently of lifespan, indicating that neuronal aging is an intrinsic, neuron-specific, and genetically regulated process. In addition, we found that DAF-18/PTEN inhibits regeneration independently of age and FOXO signaling via the TOR pathway. Finally, DLK-1, a conserved regulator of regeneration, is downregulated by insulin/IGF1 signaling, bound by DAF-16 in neurons, and required for both DAF-16- and DAF-18-mediated regeneration. Together, our data establish that insulin signaling specifically inhibits regeneration in aging adult neurons and that this mechanism is independent of PTEN and TOR."
https://openalex.org/W2024610036,"Mutations in PINK1 cause early-onset Parkinson’s disease (PD). Studies in Drosophila melanogaster have highlighted mitochondrial dysfunction on loss of Pink1 as a central mechanism of PD pathogenesis. Here we show that global analysis of transcriptional changes in Drosophila pink1 mutants reveals an upregulation of genes involved in nucleotide metabolism, critical for neuronal mitochondrial DNA synthesis. These key transcriptional changes were also detected in brains of PD patients harbouring PINK1 mutations. We demonstrate that genetic enhancement of the nucleotide salvage pathway in neurons of pink1 mutant flies rescues mitochondrial impairment. In addition, pharmacological approaches enhancing nucleotide pools reduce mitochondrial dysfunction caused by Pink1 deficiency. We conclude that loss of Pink1 evokes the activation of a previously unidentified metabolic reprogramming pathway to increase nucleotide pools and promote mitochondrial biogenesis. We propose that targeting strategies enhancing nucleotide synthesis pathways may reverse mitochondrial dysfunction and rescue neurodegeneration in PD and, potentially, other diseases linked to mitochondrial impairment. Mutations in PINK1 cause early-onset Parkinson’s disease. Martins and colleagues find that the expression levels of genes involved in nucleotide metabolism are upregulated in a Drosophila pink1 mutant, and that this affects neuronal mitochondrial DNA synthesis. They find that enhancing nucleotide synthesis through genetics or pharmacological approaches rescues mitochondrial defects associated with PINK1 mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2009918043,"Genome-wide association studies have revealed numerous risk loci associated with diverse diseases. However, identification of disease-causing variants within association loci remains a major challenge. Divergence in gene expression due to cis-regulatory variants in noncoding regions is central to disease susceptibility. We show that integrative computational analysis of phylogenetic conservation with a complexity assessment of co-occurring transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) can identify cis-regulatory variants and elucidate their mechanistic role in disease. Analysis of established type 2 diabetes risk loci revealed a striking clustering of distinct homeobox TFBS. We identified the PRRX1 homeobox factor as a repressor of PPARG2 expression in adipose cells and demonstrate its adverse effect on lipid metabolism and systemic insulin sensitivity, dependent on the rs4684847 risk allele that triggers PRRX1 binding. Thus, cross-species conservation analysis at the level of co-occurring TFBS provides a valuable contribution to the translation of genetic association signals to disease-related molecular mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2135292150,"Animals track fluctuating stimuli over multiple timescales during natural olfactory behaviors. Here, we define mechanisms underlying these computations in Caenorhabditis elegans. By characterizing neuronal calcium responses to rapidly fluctuating odor sequences, we show that sensory neurons reliably track stimulus fluctuations relevant to behavior. AWC olfactory neurons respond to multiple odors with subsecond precision required for chemotaxis, whereas ASH nociceptive neurons integrate noxious cues over several seconds to reach a threshold for avoidance behavior. Each neuron's response to fluctuating stimuli is largely linear and can be described by a biphasic temporal filter and dynamical model. A calcium channel mutation alters temporal filtering and avoidance behaviors initiated by ASH on similar timescales. A sensory G-alpha protein mutation affects temporal filtering in AWC and alters steering behavior in a way that supports an active sensing model for chemotaxis. Thus, temporal features of sensory neurons can be propagated across circuits to specify behavioral dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2063358818,"MutLγ, a heterodimer of the MutL homologues Mlh1 and Mlh3, plays a critical role during meiotic homologous recombination. The meiotic function of Mlh3 is fully dependent on the integrity of a putative nuclease motif DQHAX2EX4E, inferring that the anticipated nuclease activity of Mlh1-Mlh3 is involved in the processing of joint molecules to generate crossover recombination products. Although a vast body of genetic and cell biological data regarding Mlh1-Mlh3 is available, mechanistic insights into its function have been lacking due to the unavailability of the recombinant protein complex. Here we expressed the yeast Mlh1-Mlh3 heterodimer and purified it into near homogeneity. We show that recombinant MutLγ is a nuclease that nicks double-stranded DNA. We demonstrate that MutLγ binds DNA with a high affinity and shows a marked preference for Holliday junctions. We also expressed the human MLH1-MLH3 complex and show that preferential binding to Holliday junctions is a conserved capacity of eukaryotic MutLγ complexes. Specific DNA recognition has never been observed with any other eukaryotic MutL homologue. MutLγ thus represents a new paradigm for the function of the eukaryotic MutL protein family. We provide insights into the mode of Holliday junction recognition and show that Mlh1-Mlh3 prefers to bind the open unstacked Holliday junction form. This further supports the model where MutLγ is part of a complex acting on joint molecules to generate crossovers in meiosis."
https://openalex.org/W2026017489,"AKT/PKB kinases transmit insulin and growth factor signals downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). AKT activation involves phosphorylation at two residues, Thr(308) and Ser(473), mediated by PDK1 and the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2), respectively. Impaired AKT activation is a key factor in metabolic disorders involving insulin resistance, whereas hyperactivation of AKT is linked to cancer pathogenesis. Here, we identify the cytoplasmic NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase, Sirt2, as a novel AKT interactor, required for optimal AKT activation. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic down-regulation of Sirt2 diminished AKT activation in insulin and growth factor-responsive cells, whereas Sirt2 overexpression enhanced the activation of AKT and its downstream targets. AKT was prebound with Sirt2 in serum or glucose-deprived cells, and the complex dissociated following insulin treatment. The binding was mediated by the pleckstrin homology and the kinase domains of AKT and was dependent on AMP-activated kinase. This regulation involved a novel AMP-activated kinase-dependent Sirt2 phosphorylation at Thr(101). In cells with constitutive PI3K activation, we found that AKT also associated with a nuclear sirtuin, Sirt1; however, inhibition of PI3K resulted in dissociation from Sirt1 and increased association with Sirt2. Sirt1 and Sirt2 inhibitors additively inhibited the constitutive AKT activity in these cells. Our results suggest potential usefulness of Sirt1 and Sirt2 inhibitors in the treatment of cancer cells with up-regulated PI3K activity and of Sirt2 activators in the treatment of insulin-resistant metabolic disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2036653587,"In a new study by Kamran Atabai and colleagues, the milk fat globule protein, Mfge8, is found to promote the uptake of dietary fat and the absorption of fatty acids by peripheral organs via activation of integrin signaling and the expression of fatty acid transporters. They also found that genetic deletion of Mfge8 protected mice from diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Fatty acids are integral mediators of energy storage, membrane formation and cell signaling. The pathways that orchestrate uptake of fatty acids remain incompletely understood. Expression of the integrin ligand Mfge8 is increased in human obesity and in mice on a high-fat diet, but its role in obesity is unknown. We show here that Mfge8 promotes the absorption of dietary triglycerides and the cellular uptake of fatty acid and that Mfge8-deficient (Mfge8−/−) mice are protected from diet-induced obesity, steatohepatitis and insulin resistance. Mechanistically, we found that Mfge8 coordinates fatty acid uptake through αvβ3 integrin– and αvβ5 integrin–dependent phosphorylation of Akt by phosphatidylinositide-3 kinase and mTOR complex 2, leading to translocation of Cd36 and Fatp1 from cytoplasmic vesicles to the cell surface. Collectively, our results imply a role for Mfge8 in regulating the absorption and storage of dietary fats, as well as in the development of obesity and its complications."
https://openalex.org/W1971152332,"The reciprocal synapse between photoreceptors and horizontal cells underlies lateral inhibition and establishes the antagonistic center-surround receptive fields of retinal neurons to enhance visual contrast. Despite decades of study, the signal mediating the negative feedback from horizontal cells to cones has remained under debate because the small, invaginated synaptic cleft has precluded measurement. Using zebrafish retinas, we show that light elicits a change in synaptic proton concentration with the correct magnitude, kinetics and spatial dependence to account for lateral inhibition. Light, which hyperpolarizes horizontal cells, causes synaptic alkalinization, whereas activating an exogenously expressed ligand-gated Na(+) channel, which depolarizes horizontal cells, causes synaptic acidification. Whereas acidification was prevented by blocking a proton pump, re-alkalinization was prevented by blocking proton-permeant ion channels, suggesting that distinct mechanisms underlie proton efflux and influx. These findings reveal that protons mediate lateral inhibition in the retina, raising the possibility that protons are unrecognized retrograde messengers elsewhere in the nervous system."

Based on the cellular phenotypes, we further construct a model for how fate differentiation progresses in progenitor cells and predict cell-specific gene modules and cell-to-cell signaling events that regulate the series of fate choices. We validate our approach in C. elegans embryogenesis by perturbing 20 genes in over 300 embryos. The result not only recapitulates current knowledge but also provides insights into gene function and regulated fate choice, including an unexpected self-renewal.

Resistance exercise has been shown to increase in plasma sex steroid hormone levels. However, it remains unclear whether resistance training can restore impaired steroidogenic enzyme expressions in older individuals. Six young and 13 older men were recruited, and muscle biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis at basal state. The same group of older subjects underwent resistance training involving knee extension and flexion exercises for 12 wk, and post-training biopsies were performed 4–5 d after the last exercise session. Muscular sex steroid hormone levels and sex steroidgenesis-related enzyme expressions were significantly lower in older subjects than younger ones at baseline, but 12 wk of resistance training significantly restored hormone levels (DHEA: 432±26 at baseline, 682±31 pg/μg protein, DHT: 6.2±0.9 at baseline, 9.8±1.4 pg/μg protein). Furthermore, the steroidogenesis-related enzymes such as 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD), 17β-HSD, and 5α-reductase expressions were significantly restored by resistance training.

This barcoding methodology has thus revealed conservation between mice and humans of a previously unknown diversity in the growth and differentiation activities of their basal mammary epithelial cells stimulated to grow in transplanted hosts. The output of specialized cells in many tissues involves a hierarchical differentiation process (Doulatov et al., 2012Doulatov S. Notta F. Laurenti E. Dick J.E.

Although many approaches have helped to delineate the properties of individual cells within these tissue hierarchies, all have limitations. In vitro systems are generally unable to be sustained for the long periods of mature cell output required to identify the most primitive elements, and in vivo approaches are constrained by the large numbers of animals needed to accrue data about the regenerative properties of single cells. The use of DNA-based genome markers facilitates clonal analyses, historically, most frequently applied to the study of hematopoiesis by detecting the semirandom genomic sites of integration of a viral vector in the progeny of initially transduced hematopoietic stem cells (Schmidt et al., 2009Schmidt M. Schwarzwaelder K. Bartholomae C.C. Glimm H. von Kalle C. Detection of retroviral integration sites by linear amplification-mediated PCR and tracking of individual integration clones in different samples.Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 506: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The resolution of this approach has been increased substantially with the advent of linear amplification-mediated PCR (LAM-PCR) (Kustikova et al., 2008Kustikova O.S. Baum C. Fehse B. Retroviral integration site analysis in hematopoietic stem cells.Methods Mol.

However, LAM-PCR-based methodologies are not well suited to deriving clone size estimates and do not sensitively detect small clones. The use of libraries of barcoded vectors can overcome many of these limitations provided appropriate analytical methods are used to circumvent library-specific molecular biases, accumulated errors inherent in MPS, and transduction of cells with more than a single integrated barcode sequence, as recently shown for tracking clones derived from barcoded mouse (Bystrykh et al., 2012Bystrykh L.V.

We constructed a library of MNDU3-PGK-GFP (Logan et al., 2004Logan A.C. Nightingale S.J. Haas D.L. Cho G.J. Pepper K.A. Kohn D.B. Factors influencing the titer and infectivity of lentiviral vectors.Hum.

Cellular barcoding tool for clonal analysis in the hematopoietic system.Blood. 2010; 115: 2610-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). From >106 bacterial colonies, Sanger sequencing confirmed the accuracy and efficiency of the plasmid cloning (Table S1 available online) and MPS data indicated a diversity of 2 × 105 unique barcodes (Figure S1A) and no systematic bias in read abundance. Analysis of PCR-amplified barcodes from genomic DNA extracted from primary human mammary cells transduced with the virus library generated from these plasmids showed these were contained within a 2-fold range of sequence reads (mean ± SD = 624 ± 157; Figure S1A). To correct for variables inherent in genomic DNA extraction and/or construction of molecular libraries for sequencing, we added a set of control samples to each experimental sample to serve as an internal calibration. These “spiked-in” controls consisted of defined numbers of cells containing known barcodes and covered the expected range of experimental clone sizes (Table S2). To normalize barcode abundance values that vary in sequence coverage between libraries, each spiked-in control was converted to its fraction of sequences for all of the spiked-in controls in its respective indexed library (Table S3). For a total of 80 sets of spiked-in controls from three experimental data sets, we used regression analyses to establish the relationship between the fractional representation of each barcode and the number of cells from which the spiked-in sequences had been obtained (Figure 1B; Tables S2 and S3; Figure S1B). To establish a confidence threshold for the first two MPS runs, which had an SD of less than three cells across all groups (Table S4), we calculated the fractional representation of sequence reads in the spiked-in controls (the minimal fractional representation after normalization) using a single-cell threshold. In the third MPS run, an increased sensitivity and reduced specificity was observed (revealed by a larger SD, <44 cells, and wider 95% confidence interval [CI] across all groups; Table S4). Hence, a lower threshold corresponding to 20 cells was used in this case. The variation in regression data obtained from these different MPS runs highlights the importance of the spiked-in controls. Application of these thresholds to virtual data sets from each of the three corresponding MPS runs (a total of 28 sets of control libraries constructed from the spiked-in control cells) showed that all clones of >500 cells were detected (100% sensitivity; Figure 1C), the 100-cell clones were detected with 55%–100% sensitivity, and the 20-cell clones were detected with 18%–67% sensitivity. The specificity of detecting “true” clones was shown to be >99% (Table S4), based on finding only 1 of the 2,687 false-positive barcodes in the 28 control libraries to be above the defined threshold. Reproducibility of clone detection was determined from an analysis of seven pairs of replicate data sets obtained from the DNA of transduced mouse mammary epithelial cells that had undergone clonal expansion in vivo followed by 1 week of further amplification of the cells in vitro. Paired data sets were generated by splitting each of the seven DNA extracts into two equal fractions that were then individually subjected to library construction and sequencing. Of the 113 clones identified in these 14 data sets, 88 were detected in both replicates of each pair (Table S5) and yielded clone size values of 26 to 12,235 cells. Clones detected in only one replicate were generally smaller (mean ± SD = 34 ± 31 cells) than clones detected in both (mean ± SD = 1,091 ± 2,091 cells), consistent with an increased likelihood of uneven sampling for clones containing <100 cells (Figure 1D). Previously described vector-based genomic barcoding strategies have relied on statistical modeling to determine conditions for lentiviral transduction that minimize the incidence of multiple barcode integrations by reducing the transduction efficiency to ≤30% (Lu et al., 2011Lu R. Neff N.F. Quake S.R. Weissman I.L. Tracking single hematopoietic stem cells in vivo using high-throughput sequencing in conjunction with viral genetic barcoding.Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 928-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). We mimicked this approach using a slightly different transduction protocol (Imren et al., 2004Imren S. Fabry M.E. Westerman K.A. Pawliuk R. Tang P. Rosten P.M. Nagel R.L. Leboulch P. Eaves C.J. Humphries R.K. High-level beta-globin expression and preferred intragenic integration after lentiviral transduction of human cord blood stem cells.J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 953-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and then examined this issue directly by determining the 95% CI of the sizes estimated for each of our known spiked-in control samples. From the correlations obtained (R2 = 0.94, R2 = 0.86, and R2 = 0.70 for the three MPS runs, respectively; Table S4), we calculated the 95% CI associated with each individual value and grouped clones to eliminate redundant barcodes (likely derived from a single cell) where the 95% CI overlapped (Table S6). To measure directly the frequency of cells that would contain more than one integrated barcode under the conditions used for the primary cells, we applied this transduction protocol to cells from the 184-hTERT immortalized “normal” human mammary epithelial cell line (Raouf et al., 2005Raouf A. Brown L. Vrcelj N. To K. Kwok W. Huntsman D. Eaves C.J. Genomic instability of human mammary epithelial cells overexpressing a truncated form of EMSY.J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2005; 97: 1302-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), 48 hr later isolated single GFP+ cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), expanded them individually in vitro, and then examined the number of viral integration sites in each clone by Southern blotting. Analysis of 23 such clones showed 21 (90%) contained a single integrant (Figure S1C). This represents a lower frequency than identified by overlapping 95% CI (Table S6), indicating that a CI-based methodology is effective at removing multiple barcode integration events. We first investigated the clonal patterns of growth and differentiation obtained when barcoded basal mammary epithelial cells isolated from normal adult virgin mice are transplanted at nonlimiting numbers into the cleared fat pad of primary and secondary syngeneic recipients (Figure 1E). CD45−Ter119−BP-1−CD31−EpCAM+CD49f++ (operationally referred to hereafter as “basal”) mammary epithelial cells were obtained by FACS at >97% purity (Figure S1D) using gates previously shown to enrich for both mammary repopulating units (MRUs) (Shackleton et al., 2006Shackleton M.

We then transduced these cells using a 4 hr infection protocol expected to deliver a single integrated viral gene in >90% of the transduced cells (Figure S1C). In a first experiment, the cells were cultured for 7 days to allow expression of the GFP reporter with minimal expansion, and the GFP+ cells (30%) present at the end of that period were then isolated by FACS and transplanted (6 × 104/fat pad, grafts 1–4). Seven weeks later, the regenerated glands were removed and the total GFP+EpCAM+CD49f++ (basal) and GFP+EpCAM++CD49f+ (operationally referred to hereafter as “luminal”) cell populations were isolated from each fat pad by FACS (>97% purity; Table S7). DNA extracts were then prepared directly from 40% and 90% of these GFP+ cells, respectively, to determine their barcode composition directly by MPS. Another 10% of each sorted fraction was first expanded in vitro (under CFC assay conditions) and then DNA extracts obtained and sequenced to extend the primary clone data. The remaining 50% of the original regenerated basal cells harvested from each primary fat pad were transplanted into a cleared fat pad in a secondary mouse and their outputs assessed another 12 weeks later (Figure 1E). In a second experiment, barcoded basal cells were transplanted immediately following the 4 hr exposure to virus at cell doses of 5 × 104 and 104 per fat pad (two fat pads per cell dose for grafts 5, 6 and 7, 8, respectively). FACS analysis of a separate aliquot of these cells cultured for another 48 hr demonstrated 36% of the cells to be GFP+. Eight weeks posttransplant, histological, immunochemical, and in vitro CFC content analysis of the regenerated mammary structures confirmed their normal organization and composition (Figure 2). This included the presence of the recently described (Shehata et al., 2012Shehata M. Teschendorff A. Sharp G. Novcic N. Russell A. Avril S. Prater M. Eirew P. Caldas C. Watson C.J. Stingl J. Phenotypic and functional characterization of the luminal cell hierarchy of the mammary gland.Breast Cancer Res. 2012; 14: R134Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) Sca1+ (non-CFC-containing) and Sca1− (CFC-containing) subsets of luminal cells (Figure S1E). Approximately 90% of the total barcoded (GFP+Sca1+ and GFP+Sca1−) luminal cells and 50% of the matching GFP+ basal cells harvested from the remaining fat pads in this second experiment were then analyzed directly for their barcode content by MPS. Analysis of the barcode sequences in the cells obtained from the primary mice transplanted with cells cultured for 7 days following transduction identified a total of 144 clones (112 from the directly analyzed cells and another 32 from the cells that were expanded in vitro prior to DNA extraction; Figure 3A; Table S8) with a maximum clone size of 8,660 cells (Figure 4A). Approximately 40% (45/112) of the regenerated clones and all of the 27 largest clones (>400 cells/clone) were bilineage containing basal and luminal progeny in approximately equivalent numbers over a large range of clone sizes (Figures 4A and 4B). In the other 67 primary clones in this experiment, only luminal cells (56/112), or only basal cells (11/112), were detected (Figure 4A). Although the average size of these single-lineage clones was smaller than that of the bilineage clones, some contained as many as 380 cells, thus arguing against the detection of a restricted lineage content being explained by a smaller clone size. However, a number of clones of <100 cells must have been missed, because not all the GFP+ cells detected could be confidently assigned to a particular clone (Table S7).Figure 4Different Patterns of Growth and Differentiation in Mouse Mammary Clones Produced in Primary and Secondary RecipientsShow full caption(A) Distributions of total clone size (binned by log2 increments) for clones detected in primary (left) and secondary mice (right).

In the mice transplanted with cells directly following transduction, we identified a total of 611 primary clones (374 in the fat pads injected with 5 × 104 cells each and 237 in the fat pads injected with 104 cells each; Figure 3B) and the results for the two transplant doses were similar (Figure 4C). On average, all three different types of clones were larger than in the first experiment (some single-lineage clones containing up to 6,000 cells), but their overall representation remained similar to the results obtained in the first experiment, with the clones containing only luminal cells being the most prevalent and those containing only basal cells being the least prevalent. As in the previous experiment, many bilineage clones contained equivalent numbers of basal and luminal cells, although examples of greater bias were noted in the second experiment. More detailed analysis of the Sca1+ and Sca1− fractions within the luminal populations present in both the bilineage and luminal-restricted clones showed that both included some in which only Sca1+ or only Sca1− cells were detected, but these were generally small, near the limit of detection. In contrast, those in which both Sca1+ and Sca1− cells were detected were a common feature of the largest clones containing luminal cells, regardless of whether basal cells were also detectable in them (Figures 5A and 5B ). However, the presence of the more primitive Sca1− luminal cells was a significantly more common feature of the luminal-restricted clones compared to the bilineage clones (47% versus 18%; p = 0.023). Secondary recipients of barcoded mouse mammary cells were also set up in the first experiment (where 50% of the basal cells harvested from each of the four primary fat pads were injected into two secondary fat pads and the pairs pooled 12 weeks later, at which time the regenerated cells were again isolated by phenotype and analyzed by MPS; Figure 1E). From these analyses, we identified a total of 63 clones in the secondary mice (Figures 3A, 3B, and 6A ) and found that they spanned the same range of sizes (up to 8,160 cells) and types as the clones obtained in the primary mice from which they had been derived (Figure 4A). Strikingly, 48% (30/63) of the clones detected in the secondary mice had not attained a detectable size in the primary mice (Figure 6A). Moreover, the features of the corresponding primary clones predicted neither the differentiation pattern nor the size of the other 33 clones evident in the secondary mice. In fact, very few primary clones that were exclusively basal were self-perpetuating and most clones detected in the secondary mice were small (100 cells) and only contained a single lineage. On the other hand, 15 clones that initially appeared to be luminal restricted and small (<200 cells) became robustly bilineage (300–8,000 cells) in secondary hosts (a 300-fold expansion in clone size in some instances; Figure 6B). Conversely, four initially bilineage clones produced only a single lineage in secondary hosts, with 11 continuing to display robust bilineage activity. These results show that a display of bilineage differentiation activity in primary mice is not a universal feature of cells with serially transplantable regenerative activity, nor does the differentiation activity displayed after 7 weeks by transplanted basal cells necessarily reflect their full differentiation potential. Interestingly, most of the 30 clones that first became evident in the secondary mice were either bilineage (53%) or basal restricted (37%) and the three clones (10%) that appeared luminal restricted were small, making it difficult to exclude a potential content of basal cells. Thus, delayed clonal growth at least in transplants of nonlimiting numbers of cells with regenerative potential may be associated with predominantly basal or bilineage differentiation ability. We also examined the outputs of clones obtained from nonlimiting numbers of barcoded human basal mammary epithelial cells transplanted into immune-deficient mice using a protocol that allows bipotent human mammary “stem” cells to be detected and quantified (Eirew et al., 2008Eirew P.

In the first two experiments, the transduced human cells were cultured for another 3 days prior to isolating the GFP+ subset (35%–38%) of cells with the same CD45−CD31−CD10+CD90+CD49f+ phenotype (retained by >95% of the cells under these conditions) before being transplanted.

https://openalex.org/W2144855932,"The use of monoclonal antibodies to target functionally important cell-surface proteins on bone-resorbing osteoclasts represents a promising approach for treatment of cancer-associated bone loss and other skeletal pathologies. Previously, we identified Siglec-15, a little studied sialic acid-binding receptor, as a candidate target that is highly up-regulated during osteoclast differentiation induced by the cytokine receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL). In this report, we confirm that Siglec-15 is localized to the plasma membrane where it can be targeted by monoclonal antibodies to inhibit differentiation of functional osteoclasts in vitro. Furthermore, we found that treatment of mice with these antibodies led to a marked increase in bone mineral density, consistent with inhibition of osteoclast activity. Interestingly, osteoblast numbers were maintained despite the anti-resorptive activity. At the molecular level, Siglec-15 interacts with the adapter protein DAP12 and can induce Akt activation when clustered on the osteoclast cell surface, which likely represents its normal signaling function. Importantly, we discovered that monoclonal antibodies induce rapid internalization, lysosomal targeting, and degradation of Siglec-15 by inducing receptor dimerization. This study defines a key regulatory node that controls osteoclast differentiation and activity downstream of RANKL and supports further development of Siglec-15 antibodies as a novel class of bone loss therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2028870703,"Coagulation factor XIII (FXIII) is a transglutaminase with a well defined role in the final stages of blood coagulation. Active FXIII (FXIIIa) catalyzes the formation of ε-(γ-glutamyl)lysine isopeptide bonds between specific Gln and Lys residues. The primary physiological outcome of this catalytic activity is stabilization of the fibrin clot during coagulation. The stabilization is achieved through the introduction of cross-links between fibrin monomers and through cross-linking of proteins with anti-fibrinolytic activity to fibrin. FXIIIa additionally cross-links several proteins with other functionalities to the clot. Cross-linking of proteins to the clot is generally believed to modify clot characteristics such as proteolytic susceptibility and hereby affect the outcome of tissue damage. In the present study, we use a proteomic approach in combination with transglutaminase-specific labeling to identify FXIIIa plasma protein substrates and their reactive residues. The results revealed a total of 147 FXIIIa substrates, of which 132 have not previously been described. We confirm that 48 of the FXIIIa substrates were indeed incorporated into the insoluble fibrin clot during the coagulation of plasma. The identified substrates are involved in, among other activities, complement activation, coagulation, inflammatory and immune responses, and extracellular matrix organization."

We identified Tyr-852.64 in transmembrane domain 2 (TMII), Tyr-179 and Phe-182 in the second extracellular loop (ECL2), and Glu-3977.32 and Trp-4007.35 in TMVII as residues that contribute to the BQCA binding pocket at the M1 mAChR, as well as to the transmission of cooperativity with the orthosteric agonist carbachol. As such, the BQCA binding pocket partially overlaps with the previously described “common” allosteric site in the extracellular vestibule of the M1 mAChR, suggesting that its high subtype selectivity derives from either additional contacts outside this region or through a subtype-specific cooperativity mechanism. Mutation of amino acid residues that form the orthosteric binding pocket caused a loss of carbachol response that could be rescued by BQCA. Two of these residues (Leu-1023.29 and Asp-1053.32) were also identified as indirect contributors to the binding affinity of the modulator.

https://openalex.org/W1981650365,"The PSO4 core complex is composed of PSO4/PRP19/SNEV, CDC5L, PLRG1, and BCAS2/SPF27. Besides its well defined functions in pre-mRNA splicing, the PSO4 complex has been shown recently to participate in the DNA damage response. However, the specific role for the PSO4 complex in the DNA damage response pathways is still not clear. Here we show that both the BCAS2 and PSO4 subunits of the PSO4 complex directly interact and colocalize with replication protein A (RPA). Depletion of BCAS2 or PSO4 impairs the recruitment of ATR-interacting protein (ATRIP) to DNA damage sites and compromises CHK1 activation and RPA2 phosphorylation. Moreover, we demonstrate that both the RPA1-binding ability of BCAS2 and the E3 ligase activity of PSO4 are required for efficient accumulation of ATRIP at DNA damage sites and the subsequent CHK1 activation and RPA2 phosphorylation. Our results suggest that the PSO4 complex functionally interacts with RPA and plays an important role in the DNA damage response."
https://openalex.org/W2056501544,"The protein deacetylase SIRT1 regulates various pathways in metabolism, aging and cancer. However, the role of SIRT1 in skin cancer remains unclear. Here, using mice with targeted deletions of SIRT1 in their epidermis in both resistant B6 and sensitive SKH1 hairless backgrounds, we show that the role of SIRT1 in skin cancer development induced by ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation is dependent on its gene dose. Keratinocyte-specific heterozygous deletion of SIRT1 promotes UVB-induced skin tumorigenesis, whereas homozygous deletion of SIRT1 suppresses skin tumor development but sensitizes the B6 mice to chronic solar injury. In mouse skin, SIRT1 is haploinsufficient for UVB-induced DNA damage repair and expression of xeroderma pigmentosum C (XPC), a protein critical for repairing UVB-induced DNA damage. As compared with normal human skin, downregulation of SIRT1 is in parallel with downregulation of XPC in human cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma at both the protein and mRNA levels. In contrast, homozygous SIRT1 deletion in mouse skin augments p53 acetylation and expression of its transcriptional target Noxa, and sensitizes the epidermis to UVB-induced apoptosis in vivo, while heterozygous SIRT1 deletion has no such effect. The gene dosage-dependent function of SIRT1 in DNA repair and cell survival is consistent with the dual roles of SIRT1 in UVB-induced skin tumorigenesis. Our results reveal the gene dosage-dependent in vivo functions of SIRT1 in skin tumorigenesis and may shed light on the role of SIRT1 in epithelial cancer induced by DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W1989875004,"EmrE, a small multidrug resistance transporter, serves as an ideal model to study coupling between multidrug recognition and protein function. EmrE has a single small binding pocket that must accommodate the full range of diverse substrates recognized by this transporter. We have studied a series of tetrahedral compounds, as well as several planar substrates, to examine multidrug recognition and transport by EmrE. Here we show that even within this limited series, the rate of interconversion between the inward- and outward-facing states of EmrE varies over 3 orders of magnitude. Thus, the identity of the bound substrate controls the rate of this critical step in the transport process. The binding affinity also varies over a similar range and is correlated with substrate hydrophobicity within the tetrahedral substrate series. Substrate identity influences both the ground-state and transition-state energies for the conformational exchange process, highlighting the coupling between substrate binding and transport required for alternating access antiport."
https://openalex.org/W2013076639,"Distinguishing between allostery and competition among modulating ligands is challenging for large target molecules. Out of practical necessity, inferences are often drawn from in vitro assays on target fragments, but such inferences may belie actual mechanisms. One key example of such ambiguity concerns calcium-binding proteins (CaBPs) that tune signaling molecules regulated by calmodulin (CaM). As CaBPs resemble CaM, CaBPs are believed to competitively replace CaM on targets. Yet, brain CaM expression far surpasses that of CaBPs, raising questions as to whether CaBPs can exert appreciable biological actions. Here, we devise a live-cell, holomolecule approach that reveals an allosteric mechanism for calcium channels whose CaM-mediated inactivation is eliminated by CaBP4. Our strategy is to covalently link CaM and/or CaBP to holochannels, enabling live-cell fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays to resolve a cyclical allosteric binding scheme for CaM and CaBP4 to channels, thus explaining how trace CaBPs prevail. This approach may apply generally for discerning allostery in live cells."
https://openalex.org/W2037178605,"Amino acid uptake in yeast cells is mediated by about 16 plasma membrane permeases, most of which belong to the amino acid-polyamine-organocation (APC) transporter family. These proteins display various substrate specificity ranges. For instance, the general amino acid permease Gap1 transports all amino acids, whereas Can1 and Lyp1 catalyze specific uptake of arginine and lysine, respectively. Although Can1 and Lyp1 have different narrow substrate specificities, they are close homologs. Here we investigated the molecular rules determining the substrate specificity of the H+-driven arginine-specific permease Can1. Using a Can1-Lyp1 sequence alignment as a guideline and a three-dimensional Can1 structural model based on the crystal structure of the bacterial APC family arginine/agmatine antiporter, we introduced amino acid substitutions liable to alter Can1 substrate specificity. We show that the single substitution T456S results in a Can1 variant transporting lysine in addition to arginine and that the combined substitutions T456S and S176N convert Can1 to a Lyp1-like permease. Replacement of a highly conserved glutamate in the Can1 binding site leads to variants (E184Q and E184A) incapable of any amino acid transport, pointing to a potential role for this glutamate in H+ coupling. Measurements of the kinetic parameters of arginine and lysine uptake by the wild-type and mutant Can1 permeases, together with docking calculations for each amino acid in their binding site, suggest a model in which residues at positions 176 and 456 confer substrate selectivity at the ligand-binding stage and/or in the course of conformational changes required for transport.

Transmembrane amino acid transporters are crucial to supplying amino acids to all cells. Most of these transporters belong to one of the largest families of secondary transporters, found in all living organisms, including mammals, plants, and prokaryotes: the amino acid-polyamine-organocation (APC) 7The abbreviations used are:APCamino acid-polyamine-organocationyAAPyeast amino acid permeasesAdiCarginine/agmatine transporterGadCglutamate/γ-aminobutyric acidMM-GBSAmolecular mechanics/generalized Born surface areaTMtransmembraneOFoutward facingLAOlysine-, arginine-, and ornithine-binding proteinPDBProtein Data Bank. superfamily (1Jeschke G.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, about 16 plasma membrane amino acid permeases (yAAPs) have been characterized, displaying various substrate specificity ranges and affinities. All but one of these proteins are highly similar in sequence and are members of the APC superfamily (3Van Belle D. André B. A genomic view of yeast membrane transporters.Curr. Opin.

Many of them are regulated according to the content of the medium in amino acids and other nitrogenous compounds. The corresponding controls act at various levels: intracellular permease traffic, permease activity, and gene transcription (5Ljungdahl P.O. Daignan-Fornier B.

The wide variety of yAAPs and their differential control probably enable yeast to adapt its uptake of amino acids to very diverse environmental conditions. Detailed structural information about yAAPs is still lacking. This precludes a detailed understanding of the molecular basis of their substrate specificity and transport mechanism(s). However, the atomic level structures of three bacterial proteins of the APC family have recently been resolved: those of the arginine/agmatine (AdiC) and glutamate/γ-aminobutyric acid (GadC) antiporters and of ApcT, a broad specificity proton/amino acid symporter (7Gao X.

These structures provide the long awaited structural framework for deciphering structure-function relationships in APC superfamily transporters. All three proteins adopt the so-called “5 + 5” fold, consisting of a core of two inverted repeats of five α-helical transmembrane (TM) segments that shape the substrate binding site. This fold is shared by transporters of several different families (1Jeschke G. A comparative study of structures and structural transitions of secondary transporters with the LeuT fold.Eur. Biophys. J. 2013; 42: 181-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Structural studies of different “5 + 5” transporters, including the bacterial Na+/amino acid symporter LeuT, have provided major insights into the successive conformations adopted by this category of transporters during substrate transport via an alternative access mechanism (1Jeschke G.

The specific arginine (Can1) and lysine (Lyp1) permeases were the first two amino acid transporters to be characterized in yeast, by means of uptake assays combined with the isolation of mutants (14Grenson M.

Can1 transports arginine much more efficiently (Km ∼10 μm) than lysine (Km ∼200 μm), whereas Lyp1 mediates efficiently only lysine transport (Km ∼25 μm) (14Grenson M. Mousset M. Wiame J.M. Bechet J.

Cloning and sequencing of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene LYP1 coding for a lysine-specific permease.Yeast. 1993; 9: 771-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) has revealed that they encode highly similar proteins made of 12 TM helices flanked by hydrophilic tails facing the cytosol, and later studies on yAAPs have shown that most of these proteins, including Can1 and Lyp1, are close homologs (3Van Belle D.

Assays of Can1-mediated arginine uptake in reconstituted plasma membrane vesicles show a strict dependence on the proton-motive force (18Opekarová M. Caspari T. Tanner W. Unidirectional arginine transport in reconstituted plasma-membrane vesicles from yeast overexpressing CAN1.Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), suggesting that Can1 catalyzes H+/arginine symport. Like other yAAPs, Can1 and Lyp1 provide convenient systems for exploring various facets of the function and regulation of plasma membrane proteins, including their lateral distribution in the membrane (19Malinsky J.

In this study, we have combined molecular modeling and experimental approaches to investigate the determinants of specific recognition of arginine by Can1. We find that replacing only two residues, Ser-176 and Thr-456, in Can1 can switch the selectivity of this permease to that of Lyp1. A BLAST search (23Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J.

The Protein Data Bank.Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27319) Google Scholar) identified three bacterial APC transporters similar to Can1. One is AdiC of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica whose structures were solved either in the outward facing (OF) open or occluded states, in the apo or holo forms (7Gao X. Lu F. Zhou L. Dang S.

Molecular basis of substrate-induced permeation by an amino acid antiporter.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 3935-3940Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The others are GadC of E. coli, available in the apo inward facing conformation (11Ma D. Lu P. Yan C. Fan C. Yin P. Wang J. Shi Y. Structure and mechanism of a glutamate-GABA antiporter.Nature. 2012; 483: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and ApcT of Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, adopting a fully apo occluded state (10Shaffer P.L. Goehring A. Shankaranarayanan A. Gouaux E. Structure and mechanism of a Na+-independent amino acid transporter.Science. 2009; 325: 1010-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). To build a three-dimensional structure of Can1 by comparative modeling, we chose AdiC as a template, rather than GadC or ApcT, because the structure of this transporter has been solved for the transporter bound to its arginine substrate, which is also the substrate of Can1. The AdiC structure employed was the conformation trapped in the OF occluded state, where the binding site is configured for a tight fit with the arginine substrate (PDB code 3L1L (8Gao X. Zhou L. Jiao X. Lu F. Yan C. Zeng X. Wang J. Shi Y. Mechanism of substrate recognition and transport by an amino acid antiporter.Nature. 2010; 463: 828-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar)). The AdiC sequence can be accessed at the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) (25UniProt Consortium Reorganizing the protein space at the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt).Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40: D71-D75Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). An alignment of the AdiC and Can1 sequences was performed with PROMALS3D (26Pei J. Kim B.H. Grishin N.V. PROMALS3D. A tool for multiple protein sequence and structure alignments.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 2295-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar), also using information from the OF occluded crystal structure of AdiC (8Gao X. Zhou L. Jiao X. Lu F. Yan C. Zeng X. Wang J. Shi Y. Mechanism of substrate recognition and transport by an amino acid antiporter.Nature. 2010; 463: 828-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Sequence identity/similarity was calculated with the LALIGN program (27Huang X. Miller W. A time-efficient, linear-space local similarity algorithm.Adv. Appl. Math. 1991; 12: 337-357Crossref Scopus (839) Google Scholar) using standard parameters. Transmembrane domain predictions were performed on the Can1 sequence with HMMTOP (28Tusnády G.E. Simon I. The HMMTOP transmembrane topology prediction server.Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 849-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar) and TMpred (29Hofmann K. Stoffel W. TMbase. A database of membrane spanning protein segments.Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 166Google Scholar). Five models describing Can1 in the arginine-bound OF occluded state were thus built with MODELLER 9v1 (30Fiser A. Sali A. Modeller. Generation and refinement of homology-based protein structure models.Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 461-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar) on the basis of the PROMALS3D (26Pei J. Kim B.H. Grishin N.V. PROMALS3D. A tool for multiple protein sequence and structure alignments.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 2295-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar) alignment of Can1 with AdiC. They lack the N- and C-cytosolic tails that are not present in AdiC. The stereochemistry of the model was assessed with PROCHECK (31Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. PROCHECK. A program to check the stereochemical quality of protein structures.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Docking of arginine and lysine was performed with inclusion of protein flexibility (Induced Fit Protocol of Schrödinger, LLC (New York), Impact version 5.8) in the form of flexible residue side chains rather than with a rigid transporter. Ligand input files were prepared with the LigPrep module of Schrödinger (Schrödinger Suite 2012). Prior to docking, transporter preparation was carried out with Schrödinger's Protein Preparation Wizard protocol, whose included PROPKA module (32Li H. Robertson A.D. Jensen J.H. Very fast empirical prediction and rationalization of protein pKa values.Proteins. 2005; 61: 704-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar) was used to adjust the ionization state of all titratable residues in the protein. The Glide XP function was chosen to score the docking poses of the ligand (33Friesner R.A. Murphy R.B. Repasky M.P. Frye L.L. Greenwood J.R. Halgren T.A. Sanschagrin P.C. Mainz D.T. Extra precision glide. Docking and scoring incorporating a model of hydrophobic enclosure for protein-ligand complexes.J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 6177-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (4257) Google Scholar). The remaining parameters were set at their default values. Selected docked poses were also scored with the molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) module (34Lyne P.D. Lamb M.L.

The accuracy of binding free energy calculations based on molecular dynamics simulations.J. Chem. Inf.

For instance, the continuum electrostatics models used in this scoring method ignore the detailed molecular structure of the solvent, and neglect of the entropic contribution may be a source of errors, although the benefit of including this contribution has been disputed (40Greenidge P.A.

The pH-dependent protonation probability of all titratable protein residues in selected protein-ligand complexes was calculated by a continuum electrostatics/Monte Carlo approach (41Ullmann R.T.

Point mutations (S176N, T456S, and S176N/T456S) were introduced into the best scored OF occluded model of Can1 bound to either lysine or arginine using Maestro (Schrödinger Suite 2012). The mutated residue rotamers with the least steric hindrance were selected, and the complex was scored with the MM-GBSA module. Orthologs of Can1 were detected as described previously (44Brohée S.

The bidirectional best hits were viewed as putative orthologs when the E-value was smaller than 10−6.

https://openalex.org/W2055346100,"γ-herpesviruses (γHVs) are common human pathogens that encode homologs of the anti-apoptotic cellular Bcl-2 proteins, which are critical to viral reactivation and oncogenic transformation. The murine γHV68 provides a tractable in vivo model for understanding general features of these important human pathogens. Bcl-XL, a cellular Bcl-2 homolog, and the murine γHV68 Bcl-2 homolog, M11, both bind to a BH3 domain within the key autophagy effector Beclin 1 with comparable affinities, resulting in the down-regulation of Beclin 1-mediated autophagy. Despite this similarity, differences in residues lining the binding site of M11 and Bcl-XL dictate varying affinities for the different BH3 domain-containing proteins. Here we delineate Beclin 1 differential specificity determinants for binding to M11 or Bcl-XL by quantifying autophagy levels in cells expressing different Beclin 1 mutants and either M11 or Bcl-XL, and we show that a G120E/D121A Beclin 1 mutant selectively prevents down-regulation of Beclin 1-mediated autophagy by Bcl-XL, but not by M11. We use isothermal titration calorimetry to identify a Beclin 1 BH3 domain-derived peptide that selectively binds to M11, but not to Bcl-XL. The x-ray crystal structure of this peptide bound to M11 reveals the mechanism by which the M11 BH3 domain-binding groove accommodates this M11-specific peptide. This information was used to develop a cell-permeable peptide inhibitor that selectively inhibits M11-mediated, but not Bcl-XL-mediated, down-regulation of autophagy. γ-herpesviruses (γHVs) are common human pathogens that encode homologs of the anti-apoptotic cellular Bcl-2 proteins, which are critical to viral reactivation and oncogenic transformation.

Epstein-Barr virus, first isolated from Burkitt's lymphoma, has been detected in several malignant tumors originating in both lymphoid and epithelial tissues (1.Roizman B. Pellet P.E. The family herpesviridae. A brief introduction.in: Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Field's Virology. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2001: 2381-2398Google Scholar). Epstein-Barr virus is also the causative agent for infectious mononucleosis and may be responsible for chronic fatigue syndrome. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is associated with Kaposi sarcoma tumors, which show a high incidence among immunocompromised individuals, such as patients with HIV infection and transplant recipients. Another mammalian γHV, murine γHV68 does not infect humans but provides a tractable model for studying γHV infections in vivo. A murine model has been developed to study the mechanisms and pathogenesis of γHV induction of lympho-proliferative disease (2.Tarakanova V.L. Suarez F. Tibbetts S.A. Jacoby M.A. Weck K.E. Hess J.L. Speck S.H. Virgin H.W. Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 infection is associated with lymphoproliferative disease and lymphoma in BALB beta2 microglobulin-deficient mice.J. Virol. 2005; 79: 14668-14679Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). All γHVs encode homologs of the anti-apoptotic, cellular Bcl-2 proteins (3.Gangappa S. van Dyk L.F. Jewett T.J. Speck S.H. Virgin H.W. Identification of the in vivo role of a viral Bcl-2.J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 931-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 4.Cuconati A. White E. Viral homologs of Bcl-2.

Bcl-2 was the first cellular protein shown to function as an oncogene by blocking apoptotic cell death rather than by increasing cellular proliferation (5.Vaux D.L. Cory S. Adams J.M.

Korsmeyer S.J. bcl-2-immunoglobulin transgenic mice demonstrate extended B cell survival and follicular lymphoproliferation.Cell. 1989; 57: 79-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 family members have now been shown to be multifunctional proteins influencing diverse cellular processes such as autophagy, cell cycle progression, calcineurin signaling, glucose homeostasis, and transcription regulation (7.Reed J.C. Bcl-2 family proteins.Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3225-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar, 8.Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell death. Critical control points.Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4024) Google Scholar). Members of the Bcl-2 family are identified by the presence of different Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains. This family includes several, pro-apoptotic, BH3-only proteins, such as BIM and BAD; pro-apoptotic homologs with three BH domains (BH3, BH1, and BH2), such as BAX and BAK; and anti-apoptotic homologs with four BH domains (BH4, BH3, BH1, and BH2), such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 homologs down-regulate apoptosis by binding to the BH3 domain of pro-apoptotic proteins to inhibit their pro-apoptotic function. The anti-apoptotic γHV Bcl-2 homologs appear to be critical for viral reactivation from latency and replication in immunocompromised hosts (3.Gangappa S. van Dyk L.F. Jewett T.J. Speck S.H. Virgin H.W. Identification of the in vivo role of a viral Bcl-2.J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 931-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 9.Hardwick J.M. Viral interference with apoptosis.Semin.

Immunol. 2002; 3: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Thus, they play important roles in latent and chronic infection. One mechanism by which γHV Bcl-2 homologs may accomplish these physiological functions is by the down-regulation of apoptosis. KSHV Bcl-2 blocks apoptosis stimulated by overexpression of Bax or v-cyclin or by Sindbis virus infection (11.Sarid R. Sato T. Bohenzky R.A. Russo J.J. Chang Y. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus encodes a functional bcl-2 homologue.Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 12.Ojala P.M. Tiainen M. Salven P. Veikkola T.

Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-encoded v-cyclin triggers apoptosis in cells with high levels of cyclin-dependent kinase 6.Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4984-4989PubMed Google Scholar); however, in cellular assays, it does not appear to heterodimerize with pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, such as Bax and Bak (13.Cheng E.H. Nicholas J. Bellows D.S. Hayward G.S. Guo H.-G. Reitz M.S. Hardwick J.M. A Bcl-2 homolog encoded by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated virus, human herpesvirus 8, inhibits apoptosis but does not heterodimerize with Bax or Bak.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 690-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Epstein-Barr virus encodes a Bcl-2 homolog, BHRF1, which is expressed as an early lytic cycle protein, has anti-apoptotic activity, heterodimerizes with Bax and Bak, and also disrupts the differentiation of epithelial cells (14.Henderson S.

The γHV68 Bcl-2 homolog, M11, has been shown to down-regulate apoptosis induced by Fas, TNFα, and Sindbis virus infection (18.Wang G.-H. Garvey T.L. Cohen J.I.

More recently it has been shown that KSHV Bcl-2 and γHV68 M11 also down-regulate autophagy in cell culture by binding to an essential autophagy effector, Beclin 1 (20.Pattingre S. Tassa A. Qu X. Garuti R. Liang X.H. Mizushima N. Packer M. Schneider M.D. Levine B.

M11 is the only γHV Bcl-2 that has been demonstrated to play a role during infection in vivo (3.Gangappa S. van Dyk L.F. Jewett T.J. Speck S.H. Virgin H.W.

Thus, the γHV and cellular Bcl-2 homologs are dual regulators of autophagy and apoptosis and serve as a node of cross-talk between these pathways (23.Wei Y. Sinha S. Levine B.

Although human cellular Bcl-2 paralogs share less than 50% sequence identity, known human and murine Bcl-2 ortholog pairs share >85% sequence identity. All anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 homologs have similar three-dimensional structures, consisting of a central hydrophobic α-helix surrounded by six or seven amphipathic helices (28.Muchmore S.W. Sattler M.

The hypothesis behind this study was that despite the similar general mode of binding of the Beclin 1 BH3 domain to viral M11 and cellular Bcl-XL, the BH3 domain binding grooves of these two homologs are lined by different residues, which results in different atomic details of interaction and different thermodynamic contributions from the interactions of each residue, that would lead to differential affinities for mutant BH3 domain-derived peptides. Further, based on the promiscuity of M11 relative to Bcl-XL for different BH3 domains that has been previously reported (19.Loh J. Huang Q. Petros A.M. Nettesheim D. van Dyk L.F. Labrada L.

Therefore, we used cellular assays to identify Beclin 1 mutations that selectively abrogate down-regulation of autophagy by Bcl-XL, but not M11, then used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to identify a peptide that binds selectively to M11, but not to Bcl-XL. Further, we determined the x-ray crystal structure of this selective peptide bound to M11 to elucidate the mechanism by which it binds to M11. Lastly, we demonstrate that a cell-permeable version of this selective peptide serves as an M11-specific inhibitor that abrogates M11-mediated down-regulation of autophagy in cells. These combined results help explain the atomic bases of the differential specificity of M11 and Bcl-XL and provide a unique tool to target M11-BH3 domain interactions in vivo. This study reports the rational design of an inhibitor that selectively targets M11, which will be valuable in studying its interactions and roles in cell culture and in vivo. cDNA sequences corresponding to the γHV68 M11 and Bcl-XL genes lacking the C-terminal transmembrane helix were cloned and expressed to enable purification of soluble constructs similar to those used for previous structural studies (22.Sinha S.

The double mutant variant of Bcl-XL (N52D/N66D) was created by two rounds of site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies) and then cloned, along with a C-terminal His6 tag for purification, into the NdeI and NotI restriction sites of pET 29b. The His6-tagged Bcl-XL (residues 1–208, N52D/N66D) was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells, and soluble protein in the cell lysate was purified to homogeneity by immobilized metal affinity chromatography using two tandem 5-ml His-Trap HP columns (GE Healthcare) followed by ion exchange chromatography using a Mono Q HR 10/10 column (GE Healthcare) and size exclusion chromatography using a preparative 16/60 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare). Various Beclin 1 BH3 domain-derived peptides were chemically synthesized and HPLC-purified to >95% purity, with peptide purity confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry (RSSynthesis/Protein Chemistry Technology Core at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). ITC was performed using a Low Volume Nano ITC (TA Instruments). For all ITC experiments, samples were loaded into separate dialysis cassettes, and co-dialyzed into ITC buffer. The ITC buffer for all experiments comprised of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. ITC was performed at 25 °C with 25 injections of 2 μl each. The data were analyzed using NanoAnalyze Software (TA Instruments) with an independent model. The poor solubility of the D121A peptide in aqueous buffers necessitated a different solubilization and data analysis protocol for ITC. The D121A peptide was mixed into ITC buffer to a concentration of 1 mm and rocked at room temperature overnight. Despite this, a significant fraction of the peptide remained insoluble. This insoluble fraction was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and co-dialyzed with M11 or Bcl-XL as described above and then used for ITC. Stoichiometry was forced to 1 during data analysis, and the concentration of the D121A peptide was estimated from the fit. The M11-DS peptide complex was crystallized at 20 °C by hanging drop vapor diffusion from a 1:1 mixture of protein stock (5 mg/ml complex in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm TCEP) and well solution (2.5 m (NH4)2SO4 and 8% v/v 2-propanol). Plate-shaped crystals were harvested and cryoprotected in a cryosolution consisting of 2.5 m (NH4)2SO4 and 25% (v/v) glycerol and then immediately flash-frozen in liquid N2. Diffraction intensities from these crystals were recorded at 100 K using 1-s exposures over 0.5° crystal rotation per image, on a 4 × 4 tiled MARmosaic CCD detector (Rayonix) at a crystal to detector distance of 250 mm at Beamline 23ID-D of [email protected] (Argonne National Laboratory, Chicago, IL).

It is well known that adequate mechanical stress is essential for the maintenance of bone mass, whereas excess mechanical stress induces bone resorption. However, it has not been clarified how osteoblasts respond to different magnitudes of mechanical stress. Here we report that large-magnitude (12%) cyclic stretch induced Ca2+ influx, which activated reactive oxygen species generation in MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts. Reactive oxygen species then activated the ASK1-JNK/p38 pathways. The activated JNK led to transiently enhanced expression of FGF-inducible 14 (Fn14, a member of the TNF receptor superfamily) gene. Cells with enhanced expression of Fn14 subsequently acquired sensitivity to the ligand of Fn14, TNF-related weak inducer of apoptosis, and underwent apoptosis. On the other hand, the ASK1-p38 pathway induced expression of the monocyte chemoattractant protein 3 (MCP-3) gene, which promoted chemotaxis of preosteoclasts. In contrast, the ERK pathway was activated by small-magnitude stretching (1%) and induced expression of two osteogenic genes, collagen Ia (Col1a) and osteopontin (OPN). Moreover, activated JNK suppressed Col1a and OPN induction in large-magnitude mechanical stretch-loaded cells. The enhanced expression of Fn14 and MCP-3 by 12% stretch and the enhanced expression of Col1a and OPN by 1% stretch were also observed in mouse primary osteoblasts. These results suggest that differences in the response of osteoblasts to varying magnitudes of mechanical stress play a key role in switching the mode of bone metabolism between formation and resorption.

https://openalex.org/W2017580000,"SecA is an ATP-dependent molecular motor pumping secretory and outer membrane proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane in bacteria. SecA associates with the protein-conducting channel, the heterotrimeric SecYEG complex, in a so-called posttranslational manner. A recent study further showed binding of a monomeric state of SecA to the ribosome. However, the true oligomeric state of SecA remains controversial because SecA can also form functional dimers, and high-resolution crystal structures exist for both the monomer and the dimer. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structures of Escherichia coli SecA bound to the ribosome. We show that not only a monomeric SecA binds to the ribosome but also that two copies of SecA can be observed that form an elongated dimer. Two copies of SecA completely surround the tunnel exit, providing a unique environment to the nascent polypeptides emerging from the ribosome. We identified the N-terminal helix of SecA required for a stable association with the ribosome. The structures indicate a possible function of the dimeric form of SecA at the ribosome."
https://openalex.org/W2120206255,"Effective dosages for enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in Pompe disease are much higher than for other lysosomal storage disorders, which has been attributed to low cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) in skeletal muscle. We have previously demonstrated the benefit of increased CI-MPR-mediated uptake of recombinant human acid-α-glucosidase during ERT in mice with Pompe disease following addition of albuterol therapy. Currently we have completed a pilot study of albuterol in patients with late-onset Pompe disease already on ERT for >2 yr, who were not improving further. The 6-min walk test (6MWT) distance increased in all 7 subjects at wk 6 (30±13 m; P=0.002), wk 12 (34±14 m; P=0.004), and wk 24 (42±37 m; P=0.02), in comparison with baseline. Grip strength was improved significantly for both hands at wk 12. Furthermore, individual subjects reported benefits; e.g., a female patient could stand up from sitting on the floor much more easily (time for supine to standing position decreased from 30 to 11 s), and a male patient could readily swing his legs out of his van seat (hip abduction increased from 1 to 2+ on manual muscle testing). Finally, analysis of the quadriceps biopsies suggested increased CI-MPR at wk 12 (P=0.08), compared with baseline. With the exception of 1 patient who succumbed to respiratory complications of Pompe disease in the first week, only mild adverse events have been reported, including tremor, transient difficulty falling asleep, and mild urinary retention (requiring early morning voiding). Therefore, this pilot study revealed initial safety and efficacy in an open label study of adjunctive albuterol therapy in patients with late-onset Pompe disease who had been stable on ERT with no improvements noted over the previous several years.—Koeberl, D.

https://openalex.org/W2055392833,"The three deleted in liver cancer genes (DLC1-3) encode Rho-specific GTPase-activating proteins (RhoGAPs). Their expression is frequently silenced in a variety of cancers. The RhoGAP activity, which is required for full DLC-dependent tumor suppressor activity, can be inhibited by the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of a Ras-specific GAP (p120RasGAP). Here, we comprehensively investigated the molecular mechanism underlying cross-talk between two distinct regulators of small GTP-binding proteins using structural and biochemical methods. We demonstrate that only the SH3 domain of p120 selectively inhibits the RhoGAP activity of all three DLC isoforms as compared with a large set of other representative SH3 or RhoGAP proteins. Structural and mutational analyses provide new insights into a putative interaction mode of the p120 SH3 domain with the DLC1 RhoGAP domain that is atypical and does not follow the classical PXXP-directed interaction. Hence, p120 associates with the DLC1 RhoGAP domain by targeting the catalytic arginine finger and thus by competitively and very potently inhibiting RhoGAP activity. The novel findings of this study shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the DLC inhibitory effects of p120 and suggest a functional cross-talk between Ras and Rho proteins at the level of regulatory proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2000524616,"Benzothiazinones (BTZs) are a new class of sulfur containing heterocyclic compounds that target DprE1, an oxidoreductase involved in the epimerization of decaprenyl-phosphoribose (DPR) to decaprenyl-phosphoarabinose (DPA) in the Corynebacterineae, such as Corynebacterium glutamicum and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. As a result, BTZ inhibition leads to inhibition of cell wall arabinan biosynthesis. Previous studies have demonstrated the essentiality of dprE1. In contrast, Cg-UbiA a ribosyltransferase, which catalyzes the first step of DPR biosynthesis prior to DprE1, when genetically disrupted, produced a viable mutant, suggesting that although BTZ biochemically targets DprE1, killing also occurs through chemical synthetic lethality, presumably through the lack of decaprenyl phosphate recycling. To test this hypothesis, a derivative of BTZ, BTZ043, was examined in detail against C. glutamicum and C. glutamicum::ubiA. The wild type strain was sensitive to BTZ043; however, C. glutamicum::ubiA was found to be resistant, despite possessing a functional DprE1. When the gene encoding C. glutamicum Z-decaprenyl-diphosphate synthase (NCgl2203) was overexpressed in wild type C. glutamicum, resistance to BTZ043 was further increased. This data demonstrates that in the presence of BTZ, the bacilli accumulate DPR and fail to recycle decaprenyl phosphate, which results in the depletion of decaprenyl phosphate and ultimately leads to cell death."
https://openalex.org/W1994659363,"Oxidation of DNA is a frequent and constantly occurring event. One of the best characterized oxidative DNA lesions is 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxo-G). It instructs most DNA polymerases to preferentially insert an adenine (A) opposite 8-oxo-G instead of the appropriate cytosine (C) thus showing miscoding potential. The MutY DNA glycosylase homologue (MutYH) recognizes A:8-oxo-G mispairs and removes the mispaired A giving way to the canonical base excision repair that ultimately restores undamaged guanine (G). Here we characterize for the first time in detail a posttranslational modification of the human MutYH DNA glycosylase. We show that MutYH is ubiquitinated in vitro and in vivo by the E3 ligase Mule between amino acids 475 and 535. Mutation of five lysine residues in this region significantly stabilizes MutYH, suggesting that these are the target sites for ubiquitination. The endogenous MutYH protein levels depend on the amount of expressed Mule. Furthermore, MutYH and Mule physically interact. We found that a ubiquitination-deficient MutYH mutant shows enhanced binding to chromatin. The mutation frequency of the ovarian cancer cell line A2780, analyzed at the HPRT locus can be increased upon oxidative stress and depends on the MutYH levels that are regulated by Mule. This reflects the importance of tightly regulated MutYH levels in the cell. In summary our data show that ubiquitination is an important regulatory mechanism for the essential MutYH DNA glycosylase in human cells."

In the present study, we aimed to identify novel modulators of ERα-mediated transcriptional regulation via a custom-built siRNA library screen. This screen was directed against a variety of coregulators, transcription modifiers, signaling molecules and DNA damage response proteins. By utilizing a microscopy-based, multi-end point, estrogen responsive biosensor cell line platform, the primary screen identified a wide range of factors that altered ERα protein levels, chromatin remodeling and mRNA output. We then focused on UBR5, a ubiquitin ligase and known oncogene that modulates ERα protein levels and transcriptional output. Finally, we demonstrated that UBR5 also affects endogenous ERα target genes and E2-mediated cell proliferation in breast cancer cells. In conclusion, our multi-end point RNAi screen identified novel modulators of ERα levels and activity, and provided a robust systems level view of factors involved in mechanisms of nuclear receptor action and pathophysiology. Utilizing a high throughput RNAi screening approach we identified UBR5, a protein commonly amplified in breast cancer, as a novel regulator of ERα protein levels and transcriptional activity."

Proteomic analyses of the chicken egg revealed the presence of AvBDs, especially AvBD9, AvBD10, and AvBD11, identified in the egg yolk, eggshell, and eggshell/egg white/vitelline membrane, respectively (26Mann K.

In addition to these AvBDs, another cysteine-rich and cationic peptide of 41 residues (4731.68 Da), named gallin, was also detected in the hen egg white and vitelline membrane (27Mann K. Proteomic analysis of the chicken egg vitelline membrane.Proteomics. 2008; 8: 2322-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 30Mann K. Olsen J.V. Macek B. Gnad F. Mann M. Identification of new chicken egg proteins by mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis.Worlds Poult. Sci. J. 2008; 64: 209-218Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This peptide was named gallin because of its sequence homology with meleagrin and cygnin, two peptides present in the egg whites of turkey (Meleagris) and swan (Cygnus), respectively (31Simpson R.J.

Structural and physicochemical characteristics of novel basic proteins isolated from duck egg white.Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2008; 72: 2082-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Their cysteine spacing (CX3–5CX3CX11C3–4CC) provides evidence that they are related to defensins, but the gallin gene does not belong to the cluster of AvBD genes, and its primary structure differs from typical AvBD sequences (34Gong D. Wilson P.W. Bain M.M. McDade K. Kalina J. Hervé-Grépinet V. Nys Y. Dunn I.C. Gallin. An antimicrobial peptide member of a new avian defensin family, the ovodefensins, has been subject to recent gene duplication.BMC Immunol. 2010; 11: 12Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This new subfamily of defensins was therefore termed ovodefensins. In view of the slight difference in cysteine spacing, it has been proposed that ovodefensins and avian defensins may have diverged from a common ancestor (34Gong D. Wilson P.W. Bain M.M. McDade K. Kalina J. Hervé-Grépinet V. Nys Y. Dunn I.C. Gallin. An antimicrobial peptide member of a new avian defensin family, the ovodefensins, has been subject to recent gene duplication.BMC Immunol. 2010; 11: 12Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Interestingly, gallin is potentially coded by three different genes (34Gong D. Wilson P.W. Bain M.M. McDade K. Kalina J. Hervé-Grépinet V. Nys Y. Dunn I.C. Gallin. An antimicrobial peptide member of a new avian defensin family, the ovodefensins, has been subject to recent gene duplication.BMC Immunol. 2010; 11: 12Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which are clustered on chromosome 3 and separated from the cluster of AvBD genes. To date, the ovodefensin subfamily counts seven members, including the two sequences, taeniopygin-1 and taeniopygin-2, predicted from the zebra finch genome (34Gong D. Wilson P.W. Bain M.M. McDade K. Kalina J. Hervé-Grépinet V. Nys Y. Dunn I.C. Gallin. An antimicrobial peptide member of a new avian defensin family, the ovodefensins, has been subject to recent gene duplication.BMC Immunol. 2010; 11: 12Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Besides the classical members of the ovodefensin subfamily, it is noteworthy that the cysteine spacings of dBPS1 and taeniopygin-2 are slightly different and were first described as “related to ovodefensins” (34Gong D. Wilson P.W. Bain M.M. McDade K. Kalina J. Hervé-Grépinet V. Nys Y. Dunn I.C. Gallin. An antimicrobial peptide member of a new avian defensin family, the ovodefensins, has been subject to recent gene duplication.BMC Immunol. 2010; 11: 12Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). From a functional point of view, recombinant gallin was shown to be able to inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli (34Gong D. Wilson P.W. Bain M.M. McDade K. Kalina J. Hervé-Grépinet V. Nys Y. Dunn I.C. Gallin. An antimicrobial peptide member of a new avian defensin family, the ovodefensins, has been subject to recent gene duplication.BMC Immunol. 2010; 11: 12Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that this defensin belongs to the antimicrobial innate immune system. However, its potency against other bacteria, especially Gram-positive bacteria, is still unknown. The purpose of the present work is therefore to further characterize the functional and structural features of gallin. This study successively describes the chemical synthesis of gallin and then its use for the screening of its antibacterial spectrum and for the resolution of its three-dimensional structure. HPLC analyses were carried out on either an Elite LaChrom system, composed of a Hitachi L-2130 pump, a Hitachi L-2455 diode array detector, and a Hitachi L-2200 autosampler, or on a LaChrom 7000 system, composed of a Merck-Hitachi L-7100 pump, a Merck-Hitachi L-7455 diode array detector, and a Merck-Hitachi D-7000 interface, which was also used for semipreparative purification. The machines were equipped with C18 reversed phase columns (Nucleosil), 300 Å, 5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm for the analytical separations or 250 × 10.5 mm for purification. Solvents A and B containing 0.1% TFA were H2O and MeCN, respectively. MS analyses were performed on an Autoflex MALDI-TOF instrument (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a 337-nm nitrogen laser and a gridless delayed extraction ion source. The instrument was used in reflector positive ion mode with a 150-ns delay and an accelerating voltage of 19 kV. Instrument control and external calibration were accomplished using Flex-Control software (Bruker). The observed m/z values correspond to the monoisotopic ions. The sample was co-crystallized with a solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as a matrix, using the dry droplet method. Synthetic gallin was further analyzed by MS and MS/MS on a nanoESI-Q-TOF Ultima Global mass spectrometer (Waters, Manchester, UK), as described previously (15Hervé-Grépinet V. Réhault-Godbert S. Labas V. Magallon T. Derache C. Lavergne M. Gautron J. Lalmanach A.C. Nys Y. Purification and characterization of avian β-defensin 11, an antimicrobial peptide of the hen egg.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2010; 54: 4401-4409Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A multicharged precursor ion with an m/z value of 788.42 (charge state 6 (+6)) was selected for the fragmentation (data not shown). Solid-phase peptide synthesis was run on an automated synthesizer 433A from Applied Biosystems using Fmoc/tBu chemistry at a 0.1-mmol scale with hexafluorophosphate salt O-(benzotriazol-lyl)-tetramethyl uronium/1-hydroxybenzotriazole as coupling reagents. Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-methylphenoxyproprionic acid (PolyPeptide) (122.37 mg, 0.25 mmol) was manually coupled onto the aminomethyl polyethylene glycol dimethylacrylamide resin (3 g, wet weight, 0.1 mmol) in the presence of hexafluorophosphate O-(7-azabenzotriazol-lyl)-tetramethyl uronium (95 mg, 0.25 mmol) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (86 μl, 0.5 mmol) for 2 h. The elongation was then carried out automatically using a 10-fold excess of protected amino acids and coupling reagents. The side-chain protecting groups used were Asn(Trt), Cys(Trt), Gln(Trt), His(Trt), Lys(Boc), Ser(tBu), Thr(tBu), Trp(Boc), and Tyr(tBu). The 0.1-mmol scale program purchased from the manufacturer was used, and each coupling step was followed by capping with acetic anhydride. Fmoc deprotection was performed with 20% piperidine in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone. The peptide resin was then treated for 3 h at room temperature with TFA/H2O/iPr3SiH/phenol (87.5:5:2.5:5). The released peptide was precipitated with ice-cold diethyl ether, recovered by centrifugation, washed three times with ether, dried under vacuum, and analyzed by HPLC and mass spectrometry. The main peak corresponds to the fully reduced form of gallin with a [MH]+ of 4729.5 Da. Calculated [MH+] for C213 H327 N54 O54 S7 was 4729.25 Da. For purification, the crude reduced product was dissolved in distilled water containing 0.1% TFA, oxidized, and purified by semipreparative C18 reversed-phase HPLC. The oxidative folding was performed by mixing the crude reduced form of gallin at 500 μg/ml with reduced and oxidized glutathione at a molar ratio of 1:100:10 (peptide/GSH/GSSG) in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing 1 mm EDTA. The gallin concentration was measured using UV spectrophotometry at 280 nm (ϵ = 21,345 m−1 cm−1). The time course of an analytical oxidative folding reaction was determined by taking, at intervals, aliquots from the reaction mixture, quenching the oxidation by acidifying the sample using TFA (final concentration 2%), and then analyzing the sample by analytical C18 reversed phase HPLC. Oxidized gallin was eluted earlier than its reduced form, 12 min versus 24.6 min, respectively. Mass spectrometry analysis of the oxidized form of gallin was [MH]+ 4723.38 ± 38 Da in accordance with the calculated [MH+] for C213 H321 N54 O54 S7 (4723.1998 Da with the three theoretical disulfide bonds). Eight different strains were used to assess the antimicrobial activity: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29740, Listeria monocytogenes strain EGD, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, E. coli BEN3578, E. coli CFT073, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis ATCC 13076, S. enterica serovar Enteritidis LA5, and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028. S. enterica serovar Enteritidis LA5 is a wild-type strain (nalidixic acid-resistant at 20 μg/ml) isolated from natural chicken infections. S. enterica serovar Enteritidis ATCC 13076, and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028 were purchased from the Centre de Ressources Biologiques de l'Institut Pasteur (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). S. aureus ATCC 29740 was kindly provided by Dr. Pascal Rainard (INRA, UR1282, Nouzilly, France), L. monocytogenes strain EGD and S. enterica serovar Enteritidis LA5 were kindly provided by Dr. Philippe Velge (INRA, UR1282, Nouzilly, France). E. coli BEN3578, an avian pathogenic strain isolated from the oviduct of a hen with colibacillosis in France in 2010, was kindly provided by Dr. Catherine Schouler (INRA, UR1282, Nouzilly, France). E. coli CFT073 is a human uropathogenic strain whose genome has been sequenced (35Welch R.A. Burland V. Plunkett 3rd, G. Redford P. Roesch P. Rasko D. Buckles E.L. Liou S.R. Boutin A. Hackett J.

Antibacterial activities of gallin were measured by a radial diffusion assay according to the method described by Lehrer et al. (36Lehrer R.I. Rosenman M. Harwig S.S. Jackson R. Eisenhauer P. Ultrasensitive assays for endogenous antimicrobial polypeptides.J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 137: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Bacteria incubated overnight were diluted in trypticase soy broth or brain heart infusion at an absorbance of 0.02 and were incubated for 2.5–4 h, depending on the bacterial strain, at 37 °C to obtain a mid-logarithmic phase culture. Bacterial concentrations were determined by plating serial 10-fold dilutions of bacterial suspension on trypticase soy agar plates and by counting colony-forming units (cfu) after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C. A volume containing bacteria at 1 × 107 cfu was centrifuged at 900 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and bacteria were washed once with cold 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), resuspended in a small volume of cold sodium phosphate buffer, and mixed with 25 ml of previously autoclaved, warm (42 °C) 10 mm phosphate buffer, containing 0.03% trypticase soy broth medium, 1% (w/v) low endosmosis-type agarose (Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.02% Tween 20. The agarose solution containing bacteria was poured into a Petri dish to form a 1-mm-deep uniform layer. A 2.5-mm-diameter gel punch was used to make 36 evenly spaced wells. In each well, 5 μl of peptide dilutions or control solutions were added. MSI-94 (a linear amphipathic magainin variant displaying a broad antimicrobial spectrum) was used as a positive control. MSI-94 was a kind gift from Dr. Philippe Bulet (BioPark, Archamps, France). The peptides were allowed to diffuse in the bacteria-containing gel while the plates were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. The gel was then overlaid with 25 ml of agar consisting of a double strength (6% (w/v)) solution of trypticase soy broth containing 1% (w/v) agarose. After an overnight incubation at 37 °C, the diameter of the clearing zone surrounding each well was measured. For each bacterial strain, three identical independent measurements of antibacterial activity were performed. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each peptide was determined as described by Lehrer et al. (36Lehrer R.I. Rosenman M. Harwig S.S. Jackson R. Eisenhauer P. Ultrasensitive assays for endogenous antimicrobial polypeptides.J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 137: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). The best fit straight line was determined using linear regression with Excel Microsoft 2003 software. The MIC was calculated by finding the intersection of the line with the x axis, indicating the lowest peptide concentration at which no clear zone was obtained. A standard set of two-dimensional 1H NMR experiments (COSY, 80-ms TOCSY, and 160-ms NOESY) was performed on a 1 mm aqueous solution of the synthetic gallin (H2O/D2O (90:10) and 100% D2O) at pH 5.5 and at 293 K. All spectra were recorded on a 600-MHz VARIAN INOVA NMR spectrometer and processed with the NMRPipe/NMRDraw software package (37Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. NMRPipe. A multidimensional spectral processing system based on UNIX pipes.J Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11529) Google Scholar, 38Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. NMRview. A computer program for the visualization and analysis of NMR data.J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2677) Google Scholar). 1H chemical shifts were assigned according to classical procedures, and NOE cross-peaks were assigned within the NMRView software (37Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. NMRPipe. A multidimensional spectral processing system based on UNIX pipes.J Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11529) Google Scholar). 13C-1H HSQC spectra were acquired in natural abundance, and 13C chemical shifts were combined with 1H chemical shifts to deduce 31 (φ,ψ) angular restraints within the TALOS software (39Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. Protein backbone angle restraints from searching a database for chemical shift and sequence homology.J Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). Distance constraints were obtained from the volume integration of NOE correlations, using the NMRView software. The calculations were initiated using the default parameters of ARIA1.1 software (40Linge J.P. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Automated assignment of ambiguous nuclear overhauser effects with ARIA.Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 71-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) and a first set of easily assigned NOEs. At the end of each run, the new assignments proposed by ARIA were checked manually and introduced (or not) in the following calculation. Ambiguous intersulfur distances, an option assuming that a given half-cystine is part of a bridge without supposing a particular partner, were used in the first runs. With this “ambiguous disulfide bridges” protocol, each half-cystine is allowed to be linked to one of the five others, leading to 15 possibilities of pairing. During the calculations, each disulfide bridge floats freely, and the protocol is driven to the most compatible disulfide bridge array, under the influence of all the other NMR restraints. When enough experimental data had been introduced into the iterative ARIA process to converge to a specific disulfide bridge pairing, covalent bonds were added between sulfur atoms involved in each bridge. Final structures were displayed and analyzed using the MOLMOL program (41Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. MOLMOL. A program for display and analysis of macromolecular structures.J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (29–32): 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6487) Google Scholar), and their quality was evaluated using the PROCHECK and PROMOTIF software packages (42Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M."

Microbiological and biochemical studies on the class D β-lactamases OXA-1 and OXA-24 showed that the two enzymes behave differently when reacting with two 6-methylidene penems (penem 1 and penem 3): the penems are good inhibitors of OXA-1 but act more like substrates for OXA-24. UV difference and Raman spectroscopy revealed that the respective reaction mechanisms are different. The penems form an unusual intermediate, a 1,4-thiazepine derivative in OXA-1, and undergo deacylation followed by the decarboxylation of Lys-70, rendering OXA-1 inactive. This inactivation could not be reversed by the addition of 100 mm NaHCO3. In OXA-24, under mild conditions (enzyme:inhibitor = 1:4), only hydrolyzed products were detected, and the enzyme remained active.

https://openalex.org/W2017080476,"Expression of fetal γ-globin in adulthood ameliorates symptoms of β-hemoglobinopathies by compensating for the mutant β-globin. Reactivation of the silenced γ-globin gene is therefore of substantial clinical interest. To study the regulation of γ-globin expression, we created the GG mice, which carry an intact 183-kb human β-globin locus modified to express enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) from the Gγ-globin promoter. GG embryos express eGFP first in the yolk sac blood islands and then in the aorta–gonad mesonephros and the fetal liver, the sites of normal embryonic hematopoiesis. eGFP expression in erythroid cells peaks at E9.5 and then is rapidly silenced (>95%) and maintained at low levels into adulthood, demonstrating appropriate developmental regulation of the human β-globin locus. In vitro knockdown of the epigenetic regulator DNA methyltransferase-1 in GG primary erythroid cells increases the proportion of eGFP+ cells in culture from 41.9 to 74.1%. Furthermore, eGFP fluorescence is induced > 3-fold after treatment of erythroid precursors with epigenetic drugs known to induce γ-globin expression, demonstrating the suitability of the Gγ-globin eGFP reporter for evaluation of γ-globin inducers. The GG mouse model is therefore a valuable model system for genetic and pharmacologic studies of the regulation of the β-globin locus and for discovery of novel therapies for the P-hemoglobinopathies.—McColl, B., Kao, B.
