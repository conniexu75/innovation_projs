In 2007, humankind was able to store 2.9 × 10(20) optimally compressed bytes, communicate almost 2 × 10(21) bytes, and carry out 6.4 × 10(18) instructions per second on general-purpose computers. General-purpose computing capacity grew at an annual rate of 58%. The world's capacity for bidirectional telecommunication grew at 28% per year, closely followed by the increase in globally stored information (23%). Humankind's capacity for unidirectional information diffusion through broadcasting channels has experienced comparatively modest annual growth (6%). Telecommunication has been dominated by digital technologies since 1990 (99.9% in digital format in 2007), and the majority of our technological memory has been in digital format since the early 2000s (94% digital in 2007)."

Technological challenges exist, however, due to the dispersed and heterogeneous nature of these data. Standardization of methods and development of robust metadata can increase data access but are not sufficient. Reproducibility of analyses is also important, and executable workflows are addressing this issue by capturing data provenance. Sociological challenges, including inadequate rewards for sharing data, must also be resolved. The establishment of well-curated, federated data repositories will provide a means to preserve data while promoting attribution and acknowledgement of its use."

Using an integrated in vitro and in vivo comparative miRNA expression array, we identified miR-29c as a signature miRNA in the diabetic environment. We validated our profiling array data by examining miR-29c expression in the kidney glomeruli obtained from db/db mice in vivo and in kidney microvascular endothelial cells and podocytes treated with high glucose in vitro. Functionally, we found that miR-29c induces cell apoptosis and increases extracellular matrix protein accumulation. Indeed, forced expression of miR-29c strongly induced podocyte apoptosis. Conversely, knockdown of miR-29c prevented high glucose-induced cell apoptosis. We also identified Sprouty homolog 1 (Spry1) as a direct target of miR-29c with a nearly perfect complementarity between miR-29c and the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of mouse Spry1. Expression of miR-29c decreased the luciferase activity of Spry1 when co-transfected with the mouse Spry1 3′-UTR reporter construct. Overexpression of miR-29c decreased the levels of Spry1 protein and promoted activation of Rho kinase. Importantly, knockdown of miR-29c by a specific antisense oligonucleotide significantly reduced albuminuria and kidney mesangial matrix accumulation in the db/db mice model in vivo. These findings identify miR-29c as a novel target in diabetic nephropathy and provide new insights into the role of miR-29c in a previously unrecognized signaling cascade involving Spry1 and Rho kinase activation.

An emerging body of evidence suggests that miRNAs serve as important therapeutic targets in a wide range of complex human diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases, by targeting multiple transcripts (3Croce C.M.

Recent studies have also revealed the involvement of miRNAs in diabetic nephropathy (DN) (7Kato M. Zhang J. Wang M. Lanting L. Yuan H. Rossi J.J. Natarajan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We hypothesized that an unbiased global miRNA expression profiling might reveal novel miRNAs, which may play critical regulatory roles in the pathogenesis of DN. Accordingly, by using an integrated in vitro and in vivo comparative miRNA expression profiling, we identified up-regulated miR-29c as a signature miRNA in the diabetic environment. Previously published work suggested that down-regulation of miR-29c resulted in cardiac fibrosis (10van Rooij E. Sutherland L.B. Thatcher J.E. DiMaio J.M. Naseem R.H. Marshall W.S. Hill J.A.

In contrast, herein we identified miR-29c as a signature miRNA in the diabetic milieu whose expression was increased in hyperglycemic conditions both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, our objective was to explore the role of increased miR-29c expression in DN. We found that miR-29c targets Sprouty homolog 1 (Spry1) in hyperglycemic conditions. Spry1 is a cytoplasmic protein that plays a critical role in kidney development (12Gross I. Morrison D.J. Hyink D.P. Georgas K. English M.A. Mericskay M. Hosono S. Sassoon D. Wilson P.D. Little M.

Spry1 and its related proteins have also been implicated as negative regulators of RhoA and its downstream effector Rho kinase through the non-canonical Wnt signaling (17Wang Y. Mol.

Published studies from our laboratory and others have shown that pharmacological inhibition of Rho kinase in experimental models of diabetes results in a significant reduction in albuminuria and accumulation of glomerular matrix accumulation (22Kolavennu V.

Diabetes. 2008; 57: 1683-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). At the cellular level, Rho kinase has been implicated in cell proliferation, fibrosis, and apoptosis via multiple signaling pathways (24Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3823) Google Scholar, 25Loirand G. Guérin P. Pacaud P. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 322-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 26Narumiya S. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms that regulate Rho kinase activation in DN are not fully understood. Here, we report the identification of miR-29c as a signature miRNA in DN. Together with functional studies, our results establish the role of miR-29c as a key miRNA governing kidney remodeling through a coordinated coupling of Spry1 with Rho kinase activation. Conditionally immortalized mouse podocytes were kindly provided by Dr. Jochen Reiser (University of Miami, Miami, FL) and cultured as reported previously (27Mundel P. Reiser J. Zúñiga Mejía Borja A. Pavenstädt H. Davidson G.R. Kriz W. Zeller R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Briefly, podocytes were cultured on BD BioCoat Collagen I plates (BD Biosciences) at 33 °C in the presence of 20 units/ml mouse recombinant IFN-γ (Invitrogen) to enhance expression of a thermosensitive T antigen. To induce differentiation, podocytes were maintained at 37 °C without IFN-γ for 10–12 days. A conditionally immortalized renal microvascular endothelial cell line was a kind gift of Dr. Robert Langley (M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas, Houston, TX) (28Langley R.R. Ramirez K.M. Tsan R.Z. Van Arsdall M. Nilsson M.B. Fidler I.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2971-2976PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse mesangial cells (CRL-1927) were purchased from ATCC and cultured as reported previously (22Kolavennu V. Zeng L. Peng H. Wang Y. Danesh F.R. Diabetes. 2008; 57: 714-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). miRNAs were extracted using the miRNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The miRNA microarray was performed using μParaflo microfluidic chips (LC Sciences, Houston, TX). Data were analyzed by normalizing the signals using a LOWESS filter (locally weighted regression) (29Bolstad B.M. Irizarry R.A. Astrand M. Speed T.P. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (6354) Google Scholar). For two-color experiments, the ratio of the two sets of detected signals (log2-transformed, balanced) and p values of the Student's t test were calculated. Those with p < 0.05 were considered as differentially expressed miRNAs. miRCURY LNA universal RT microRNA PCR system (Exiqon, Woburn, MA) was used in conjunction with qPCR and SYBR Green supermix (Bio-Rad) for quantification of miRNA transcripts according to the manufacturer's instructions. U6 snRNA was used as an internal control with the following primers: 5′-CGCTTCGGCAGCACATATAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTCACGAATTTGCGTGTCAT-3′ (reverse). The reactions were incubated in a 96-well plate at 95 °C for 3 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Individual samples were run in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated at least three times. Relative gene expression was calculated using the 2−ΔΔCT method (30Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (121088) Google Scholar). Northern blots were carried out using [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) end-labeled miRNA locked nucleic acid (LNA) probes (Exiqon) (31Várallyay E. Burgyán J. Havelda Z. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The full-length mRNA of mouse Spry1 (NM_011896) was obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. The miRNA sequence database (miRBase) was obtained from the University of Manchester. Three separate algorithms (miRanda, TargetScan, and PicTar) were used to assess potential targets sites for miR-29c. The RNA Hybrid program (32Rehmsmeier M. Steffen P. Hochsmann M. Giegerich R. RNA. 2004; 10: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1819) Google Scholar) was used to predict the secondary structure of the RNA/miRNA duplex. The 3′-UTR of the mouse Spry1 gene (NM_011896) was amplified from podocyte genomic DNA by PCR using the HotMaster Taq DNA polymerase (5 PRIME), with the following primers: 5′-GTCTCGAGCGGTGTTGGTCTTCACATCAGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAGAATTCAGACATGAGTACATTTCAACAGTC-3′ (reverse). The 1048-bp PCR product was cloned between the XhoI and EcoRI site of the luciferase reporter vector 3.1-luc, kindly provided by Dr. Ralph Nicholas (Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH) (33Du M. Roy K.M. Zhong L. Shen Z. Meyers H.E. Nichols R.C. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 732-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), to generate 3.1-luc-Spry1. Putative miR-29c binding site UGGUGCU (nucleotides 773–779) was mutated into GAUGUGC by oligonucleotide-directed PCR. The open reading frame (without the 3′-UTR) of mouse Spry1 gene was amplified from podocyte genomic DNA by PCR with the following primers: 5′-GTGAATTCGATTCCCCAAGTCAGCATGGCGCCAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACGGATCCTCATGACAGTTTGCCCTGAGCTTGA-3′ (reverse). The 942-bp PCR product was cloned between the EcoRI and SalI site of a modified FLAG-tagged mammalian expression vector pRK5 (34Lin X. Duan X. Liang Y.Y. Su Y. Wrighton K.H. Long J. Hu M. Davis C.M.

Mouse miR-29c precursor was amplified from mouse podocyte genomic DNA by PCR using AccuPrime Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen), with the following primers: 5′-GACTCGAGGACTGAGATCCATGGAGCACC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAGAATTCGACTTGAAGTTAGGAACTGGATC-3′ (reverse). The 310-bp PCR product was cloned between the XhoI and EcoRI site of lentiviral vector pLB2 CAG P2Gm (Addgene, Cambridge, MA) to generate pLB2-CAG-miR29c. All constructs were verified by sequencing. The pEGP-miR-29c was obtained from Cell Biolabs (San Diego, CA). The luciferase reporter vector pGL4.10 [luc2] was from Promega. Pre-miRNA precursor and anti-miR miRNA molecules were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). These include: pre-miR negative control 1 (AM17110); pre-miR-29c (AM17100); anti-miRNA inhibitor negative control 1 (AM17010); and anti-miR-29c (AM10518). Spry1 siRNA was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. miRNA mimics, miRNA inhibitors, and siRNAs were transfected into podocytes using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) at a final concentration of 30 nm. For experiments using 3.1-luc luciferase reporter constructs in vitro, 2.0 × 105 podocytes were plated onto 10-cm plates and well differentiated for 7–10 days. 4.0 μg of 3.1-luc empty vector or 3.1-luc-Spry1 construct, 200 ng of pSV-β-gal control vector (Promega), and 30 nm pre-miRNA mimics were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Following 48 h of transfections, luciferase activity was measured using a Dual-Glo luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega) on a FLUOstar Omega luminometer (BMG Labtech, Cary, NC) as reported previously (35Long J. Matsuura I. He D. Wang G. Shuai K. Liu F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 9791-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), using β-gal as internal control. Lentiviral miR-29c and control lentivirus were prepared from lentiviral construct pLB2-CAG-miR29c or empty pLB2-CAG-P2Gm vector by the Gene Vector Core Laboratory at the Baylor College of Medicine. Lentiviral constructs were then used to infect undifferentiated podocytes with 0.8 mg/ml Polybrene (Sigma) and were subsequently selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) in the presence of 20 units/ml IFN-γ at 33 °C. Mouse mesangial cells were also infected with the same lentiviral constructs and selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin at 37 °C. Overexpression of miR-29c in the stable cells was confirmed by real-time qPCR analysis of miR-29c. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). First-strand cDNAs were generated using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). SYBR Green-based qPCR on a DNA Engine Opticon (Bio-Rad) were used to analyze the relative expression levels of the following genes with the following primer sets: fibronectin (Fn1), 5′-GCGGTTGTCTGACGCTGGCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGGGTTCAGCAGCCCCAGGT-3′ (reverse); GAPDH, 5′-CCTTCATTGACCTCAACTAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGAAGGCCATGCCAGTGAGC-3′ (reverse). Immunofluorescent staining was performed as described previously (9Long J. Wang Y. Wang W. Chang B.H. Danesh F.R. J. Biol.

Briefly, expression of miR-29c and endogenous Spry1 in the stable Lenti-miR-29c-infected podocytes were detected using GFP and anti-Spry1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Coverslips were imaged on an Applied Precision SoftWoRx Image using a deconvolution restoration microscope. For immunostaining, rabbit anti-Spry1 and anti-fibronectin antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used. Sections were incubated at 4 °C overnight. Sections were imaged on a Zeiss LSM 510 inverted laser scanning microscope. All animal studies were conducted according to the “Principles of Laboratory Animal Care” (National Institutes of Health publication number 85023, revised 1985) and the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Baylor College of Medicine. The diabetic db/db mice and their control littermates db/m mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). All animals were maintained on a normal chow diet and housed in a room with a 12:12-h light/dark cycle and an ambient temperature of 22 °C. Kidney glomeruli were isolated by perfusion using Dynabeads (Invitrogen) as described previously (37Takemoto M. Asker N. Gerhardt H. Lundkvist A. Johansson B.R. Saito Y. Betsholtz C. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 799-805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). For biochemical and histological analyses, mice were housed in individual metabolic cages for collection of urine. Urinary albumin and creatinine were measured using the Albuwell M and Creatinine Companion assay kits (Exocell, Philadelphia, PA), respectively. Blood glucose was measured after a 12-h fast using the OneTouch UltraSmart blood glucose meter (Lifescan, Milpitas, CA). For morphometric studies, the kidneys were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and subsequently embedded in paraffin. The 4-μm sections of paraffin-embedded tissues were stained with periodic acid-Schiff. Light microscopic views of 50 consecutive glomerular cross-sections per mouse were scanned into a computer. Mesangial matrix was quantified in a blinded fashion using an image analysis system (MetaMorph version 6.1; Universal Imaging). The mesangial matrix index was calculated as the ratio of mesangial area to glomerular area × 100 (percentage of area) as described previously (22Kolavennu V. Zeng L. Peng H. Wang Y. Danesh F.R. Diabetes. 2008; 57: 714-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Chemically modified antisense RNA oligonucleotides (ASOs) complementary to the mature miR-29c sequence were used to inhibit miR-29c activity in vivo as suggested previously (10van Rooij E.

Protoc. 2007; 2: 2295-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected podocytes were serum-starved overnight before treating with normal or high glucose for 36 h. Cells were then resuspended in 0.5 ml of FACS binding buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 5 mm Ca2+ and Mg2+ with 1% BSA) and counterstained with Sytox Red and annexin V-phycoerythrin (Invitrogen) for 15 min at room temperature. At last, samples were run on a CantoII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Rho kinase activity was measured as described previously (22Kolavennu V. Zeng L. Peng H. Wang Y. Danesh F.R. Diabetes. 2008; 57: 714-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Briefly, kidney cortex or podocytes were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (Sigma). To assess Rho kinase activity, 500 ng of myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1) (654-880, Millipore) and Tris/ATP (final concentration: 1 mm ATP, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 m DTT, 10 mm MgCl2) were added to the lysate. The lysates were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 2× Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) and by subsequent boiling for 5 min. Phosphorylation of MYPT1 by Rho kinase was detected by running the samples on an SDS-PAGE gel and by subsequent immunoblotting with an anti-phospho-MYPT1 (Thr-850, Millipore). As a loading control, internal β-actin was detected by immunoblotting with an anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma). Appropriate DyLight Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were chosen for signal detection on an Odyssey infrared imager (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). All data are shown as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was assessed by performing analysis of variance followed by the Tukey-Kramer post hoc analysis for multiple comparisons using an α value of 0.05 in GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA). Western blot signals were quantitated using software National Institutes of Health ImageJ version 1.42q. We have previously described an unbiased approach to identify regulatory miRNAs in DN by examining the expression profiles of miRNAs in samples obtained from glomeruli from db/db mice, an established mouse model of type 2 diabetes, and in kidney cell lines exposed to hyperglycemic conditions (9Long J. Wang Y. Wang W. Chang B.H. Danesh F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 23457-23465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Here, by employing an integrated in vitro and in vivo approach, we analyzed the expression of miRNAs at several time points (6, 12, and 24 h) following stimulation with high glucose (25 mm) in cultured podocytes and kidney microvascular endothelial cells as well as in glomeruli from diabetic db/db mice at 24 weeks of age when the animals develop biochemical and histological changes consistent with DN. We found that nine miRNAs were differentially up-regulated in our experimental conditions both in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 1, Table 1 and supplemental Table 1). Among these up-regulated miRNAs, we focused on miR-29c, which was differentially expressed in all samples with a significant fold of induction in our experimental models both in vitro and in vivo.TABLE 1Identification of nine miRNAs that are differentially up-regulated in db/db glomeruli and high glucose-treated kidney microvascular endothelial cells and cultured podocytesmiRNA IDKidney glomeruliMouse kidney microvascular endothelial cellsMouse cultured podocytesGroup1 (db/m)Group2 (db/db)Log2pGroup1 (NG)Group2 (HG)Log2pGroup1 (NG)Group2 (HG)Log2pmmu-miR-1923611,9022.400.002901902.400.0041334921.880.050mmu-miR-29c3951,6932.100.002676933.370.0052924170.510.049mmu-miR-26b1683871.210.0051,1321,9140.760.0034,8268,3360.790.042mmu-miR-11961893180.750.0161624111.350.0012827931.490.000mmu-miR-11951652660.690.0042867411.380.0065807500.370.032mmu-miR-200b1422170.610.015955032.400.0051,8713,7561.010.007mmu-let-7g1,2351,8900.610.0072,1623,2690.600.0109352,0711.150.023mmu-miR-200a1822650.540.0162125471.370.0273229901.620.017mmu-miR-7055577160.360.0132433360.470.00611,92820,9790.810.001 Open table in a new tab Northern blot analysis of multiple mouse tissues from control db/m mice for miR-29c indicated that the expression of miR-29c was highest in the brain and lung with significant expression patterns in the kidney and the heart (Fig. 2A). Next, we validated our preliminary profiling data on miR-29c in the db/db model of DN by Northern blot. miR-29c levels were significantly increased in the kidney glomeruli from db/db diabetic mice as compared with their littermates db/m mice (Fig. 2B). Northern blot analysis also indicated increased miR-29c expression in several other tissues in db/db mice (supplemental Fig. S1). Similarly, in the streptozotocin-induced murine model of DN, miR-29c expression in the kidney was also significantly increased (supplemental Fig. S2). Using qPCR analysis, we confirmed that the expression level of miR-29c was about 3-fold higher in the kidney cortices of db/db mice as compared with that in db/m control mice (Fig. 2C). We also validated the expression levels of miR-29c in kidney podocytes and kidney microvascular endothelial cells stimulated with high glucose (25 mm). Northern blot analysis indicated that miR-29c was significantly increased following 24 h of exposure to high glucose (Fig. 2D). Similarly, real-time qPCR analysis demonstrated that high glucose treatment led to ∼3-fold increase in miR-29c expression in podocytes and kidney microvascular endothelial cells, whereas mannitol had no effect on miR-29c expression (Fig. 2E and supplemental Fig. S3). Taken together, these findings validated our initial observations confirming that miR-29c is up-regulated in response to hyperglycemic conditions both in vitro and in vivo. We next set out to identify the potential target(s) of miR-29c under hyperglycemic conditions. There were at least six previously reported targets for the miR-29 family members, which include: DNA methyltransferase 3 (44Fabbri M. Garzon R. Cimmino A. Liu Z. Zanesi N. Callegari E. Liu S.

However, its regulation by upstream regulators remains poorly characterized. Although phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) is known to regulate the phosphorylation of AKT Ser473, the hydrophobic motif (HM) site, by mTORC2, it is not clear whether PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 can directly regulate mTORC2 kinase activity. Here, we used two membrane-docked AKT mutant proteins, one with and the other without the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, as substrates for mTORC2 to dissect the roles of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in AKT HM phosphorylation in cultured cells and in vitro kinase assays. In HEK293T cells, insulin and constitutively active mutants of small GTPase H-Ras and PI3K could induce HM phosphorylation of both AKT mutants, which was blocked by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Importantly, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 was able to stimulate the phosphorylation of both AKT mutants by immunoprecipitated mTOR2 complexes in an in vitro kinase assay. In both in vivo and in vitro assays, the AKT mutant containing the PH domain appeared to be a better substrate than the one without the PH domain.

Many extracellular stimuli, including growth factors, G protein-coupled receptor ligands, and cytokines, stimulate AKT HM phosphorylation in a PI3K-dependent manner. The PI3K-mediated regulation of AKT HM phosphorylation was initially attributed to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-mediated membrane translocation and conformational changes of AKT. However, recent evidence suggests that the mTORC2 kinase can be directly regulated. The mTORC2 protein immunoprecipitated from growth factor-treated cells shows higher kinase activity in an in vitro kinase assay, and growth factors was initially reported to stimulate the phosphorylation of Ser2481 of mTOR presented in mTORC2 but not mTORC1 (29Copp J. Manning G. Hunter T. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 1821-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). However, more recently insulin was shown to stimulate the phosphorylation of Ser2481 of mTOR associated with both mTORC1 and -2 in a wortmannin-dependent manner (30Soliman G.A. Acosta-Jaquez H.A.

Furthermore, mTORC2 phosphorylates SGK1 in response to growth factors even though SGK1 lacks a PH domain and is activated independently of membrane recruitment.

In this report, we characterized the role of PI3K and its product PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in regulation of AKT HM phosphorylation using two membrane-docked AKT mutant proteins. We found that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 regulates AKT HM phosphorylation via at least three mechanisms. We confirmed that membrane translocation and conformation changes may contribute to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-stimulated AKT HM phosphorylation, but importantly, we demonstrated for the first time that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 could directly stimulate the intrinsic mTORC2 kinase activity. Reagents were obtained from the following sources: protein A/G-PLUS-Sepharose and the antibody to Ras from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; the antibodies to mTOR, phospho-mTOR (Ser2481), AKT, and phospho-AKT (Ser473) from Cell Signaling Technology; Lipofectamine Plus transfection reagent and insulin from Invitrogen; LY294002 from ALEXIS Biochemicals; 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3 (phospho-l-serine), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho- (1′-myo-inositol 3′,4′,5′-trisphosphate) (18:1 PI(3,4,5)P3), and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-myo-inositol-4′,5′-bisphosphate) (18:1 PI(4,5)P2) from Avanti Polar Lipid. HEK293T cells were maintained in DMEM with 4.5 g/liter glucose supplemented with 10% FBS. Transient transfection was performed using the Lipofectamine Plus reagent. Three hours post transfection, cells were changed to serum-free DMEM medium for overnight. Before insulin (2 μg/ml) or LY294002 (10 μm) treatment, the cells were incubated with phosphate-buffered saline for 60 min. Human GST-AKT(KT) and GST-ΔPH-AKT(KT) were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). After isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (100 μm) induction at 22 °C for 24 h, proteins were extracted with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme. After high speed centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded on glutathione-agarose beads and eluted with the buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, and 5 mm reduced glutathione. Human GST-PKCα was acquired from SignalChem. Immunoprecipitation of mTOR complexes and kinase assays were performed as described previously (23Sarbassov D.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar). HEK293T cell extracts harvested from a 10-cm plate were used for each immunoprecipitation condition. The cells were lysed on ice for 20 min in the lysis buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 0.3% CHAPS, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm pyrophosphate, 10 mm glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, and EDTA-free protease inhibitors). After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with the Rictor antibody at 4 °C for 90 min, followed by incubation with protein A/G-PLUS-agarose for another hour. Immunocomplexes were washed four times in the lysis buffer and twice with mTORC2 kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm MgCl2). For the kinase assay reaction, immunocomplexes were incubated in a final volume of 30 μl for 30 min at 37 °C in the mTORC2 kinase buffer containing 500 ng of GST fusion substrates and 500 μm ATP. The reaction was terminated by adding 10 μl of 4× SDS sample buffer, followed by Western analysis. The ultimate goal of this study was to examine the effect of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 on mTORC2 kinase activity. Although the HM site of AKT (Ser473) is an excellent substrate for mTORC2 kinase, simple examination of HM phosphorylation of the full-length AKT may not allow us to assess the effect of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 on mTORC2 kinase activity. This is because PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 has a role in AKT recruitment to plasma membranes, where mTORC2 phosphorylates AKT HM. To eliminate this membrane translocation effect on AKT, we attached the myristylation signal to AKT. To avoid possible autophosphorylation of AKT HM, we also mutated Lys179, which is involved in ATP binding, and Thr308, which contributes to kinase activation after its phosphorylation by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1. The resultant AKT mutant, designated Myr-AKT(KT) (Fig. 1A), was expressed in HEK293T cells that were stimulated with insulin and/or treated with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. The phosphorylation of Myr-AKT(KT) HM detected by an phospho-Thr473 AKT antibody was enhanced by insulin and inhibited by LY294002 (Fig. 1B). This result suggests that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 has a role more than substrate translocation in regulating HM phosphorylation. The PH domain of AKT binds to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and is involved in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-mediated AKT translocation. In addition to this translocation role, the PH domain, upon interaction with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, can induce AKT conformational change (31Milburn C.C. Deak M. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Alessi D.R. Van Aalten D.M. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), which may make the AKT a better substrate for phosphorylation by mTORC2. To eliminate any possible effect of the PH domain, we generated the Myr-ΔPH-AKT(KT) mutant that lacks the PH domain (Fig. 1A). When this mutant was tested, the phospho-Thr473 AKT antibody detected weaker HM phosphorylation of this mutant than that of Myr-AKT(KT) (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that the AKT PH domain may render AKT a better substrate for HM phosphorylation. Nonetheless, insulin could still induce HM phosphorylation on Myr-ΔPH-AKT(KT), which was inhibited by LY294002 (Fig. 1B). We also examined the effects of insulin and LY294002 treatment on Ser450 phosphorylation of both AKT substrates. Consistent with previous findings (19Facchinetti V. Ouyang W. Wei H. Soto N. Lazorchak A. Gould C. Lowry C. Newton A.C. Mao Y. Miao R.Q. Sessa W.C. Qin J. Zhang P. Su B. Jacinto E. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1932-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 21Ikenoue T. Inoki K. Yang Q. Zhou X. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1919-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), phospho-Ser450 contents were not affected by either treatment (Fig. 1B). Thus, these results together suggest that insulin can regulate AKT HM phosphorylation independently of the PH domain, but in a PI3K-dependent manner. The Ras protein is one of the signaling molecules for growth factors, including insulin, and has been implicated in the regulation of mTORC2 (32Lee S. Comer F.I. Sasaki A. McLeod I.X. Duong Y. Okumura K. Yates 3rd, J.R. Parent C.A. Firtel R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4572-4583Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 33Lee S. Parent C.A. Insall R. Firtel R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2829-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We examined the role of Ras in the HM phosphorylation of Myr-ΔPH-AKT(KT). Expression of a constitutive active mutant of H-Ras (G12V) strongly induced HM phosphorylation of Myr-ΔPH-AKT(KT) (Fig. 1C), whereas expression of a dominant negative mutant of H-Ras (S17N) markedly blocked insulin-induced HM phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). Because Ras can activate PI3K (34Li W. Zhu T. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37398-37406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 35Pollock C.B. Shirasawa S.

Immunol. 2006; 176: 1668-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we tested the effect of LY294002 on active Ras-mediated HM phosphorylation. LY294002 almost completely blocked Ras-G12V-induced HM phosphorylation (Fig. 1D). To more directly demonstrate that PI3K can induce HM phosphorylation of Myr-ΔPH-AKT(KT), a constitutive active PI3K (PI3K-CAAX) (37Bondeva T. Pirola L. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Rubio I. Wetzker R. Wymann M.P. Science. 1998; 282: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) was expressed, and it increased the HM phosphorylation (Fig. 1D). These results together support a conclusion that insulin and its downstream signaling molecule Ras may stimulate AKT HM phosphorylation via PI3K. Given that mTORC2 is an upstream kinase for phosphorylation of AKT HM, we tested whether LY294002 could affect mTOR-Ser2481 phosphorylation. This phosphorylation is stimulated by insulin, and its phosphorylation in mTORC2 may require the intact complex (29Copp J. Manning G. Hunter T. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 1821-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), even though the phosphorylation also occurs in mTORC1 (30Soliman G.A. Acosta-Jaquez H.A. Dunlop E.A. Ekim B. Maj N.E. Tee A.R. Fingar D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 7866-7879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). We found that insulin could induce the phosphorylation in HEK293T cells, which could be inhibited by LY294002 (Fig. 2A). In addition, expression of the constitutive active PI3K or H-Ras in HEK293T cells increased mTOR-Ser2481 phosphorylation, which could also be blocked by LY294002 (Fig. 2B). These results are consistent with the conclusion that Ras and PI3K may be upstream regulators of mTOR in response to insulin. To more directly assess the roles of PI3K in insulin-mediated regulation of mTORC2 kinase activity, we immunoprecipitated mTORC2 using a RICTOR antibody from serum/nutrient-starved cells stimulated with insulin and treated with/without LY294002 and carried out an in vitro kinase assay using recombinant GSK-AKT(KT) prepared from E. coli as the substrate. The immunocomplexes pulled down from cells treated with insulin caused significantly greater HM phosphorylation of GST-AKT(KT) than those from nontreated cells (Fig. 3A). In addition, treatment of cells with LY294002 prior to insulin stimulation could block insulin-mediated increases in HM phosphorylation by immunoprecipitated mTOR (Fig. 3A). We also tested another known mTORC2 substrate, PKCα. Immunoprecipitated mTORC2 stimulated phosphorylation of recombinant GST-PKCα at Ser638, which was blocked by LY294002 treatment (Fig. 3A). Because LY294002 inhibits PI3K activity by competitively inhibiting ATP binding to the catalytic subunit of PI3K, there is a possibility that LY294002 might directly inhibit ATP binding to mTOR. To exclude this possibility, we treated the immunocomplexes pulled down by the mTOR antibody with LY294002 before the substrate and ATP were added to initiate the kinase assay. Direct treatment of immunoprecipitated mTOR by LY294002 did not inhibit its phosphorylation of GST-AKT(KT) at HM (Fig. 3B). Therefore, these results indicate that insulin can stimulate mTORC2 kinase activity via PI3K. To determine whether the PI3K product PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 can directly regulate mTOR-mediated HM phosphorylation in vitro, we tested the effects of lipid vesicles containing PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in the in vitro kinase assays with immunoprecipitated mTORC2. In addition to recombinant GST-AKT(KT) and GST-PKCα, GST-ΔPH-AKT(KT) was also used as a substrate. The immunocomplexes pulled down by the RICTOR antibody from serum/nutrient-starved HEK293T cells were incubated with or without phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) vesicles containing 0, 5, and 25 ng/ml of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 before the kinase assay was initiated by adding the substrates and ATP. HM phosphorylation of GST-ΔPH-AKT(KT), GST-AKT(KT) (Fig. 4A), and GST-PKCa (Fig. 4B) was increased significantly in the samples treated with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-containing PE vesicles compared with those treated with the PE vesicle alone. The PE vesicle itself, or the one containing PtdIns(4,5)P2, had little effect on the phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). In addition, the increase in HM phosphorylation was dependent on the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 dose. Moreover, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-containing PE vesicles induced significantly stronger HM phosphorylation of GST-AKT(KT) than that of GST-ΔPH-AKT(KT), whereas HM phosphorylation of GST-AKT(KT) and GST-ΔPH-AKT(KT) remained the same in the absence of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 regardless of the presence of PE vesicles (Fig. 4A). These results indicate that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 can directly activate the kinase activity of immunoprecipitated mTORC2. In addition, they confirm that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 has additional roles in mTORC2-mediated HM phosphorylation probably via its interaction with the PH domain of the substrate. In this report, we used two AKT mutants as probes to investigate the role of PI3K and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in their regulation of mTORC2-mediated HM phosphorylation and found that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 regulates the phosphorylation via at least three different mechanisms as illustrated in Fig. 4B. Previous studies have demonstrated that the PH domain at the AKT N terminus has an important role in membrane translocation of the AKT molecule and is thus required for ligand-stimulated HM phosphorylation. Our studies indicate that the PH domain may have an additional role, i.e. its presence may make a better substrate for HM phosphorylation. Although we postulate that this may be the result of a conformational change induced upon the interaction of the PH domain with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, other possible explanations may exist. Although Ras has been implicated in the regulation of mTORC2, our results suggest that it may primarily act through PI3K and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. In addition to the effects mediated by the PH domain, our in vitro kinase assay results clearly demonstrated that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 directly regulates the kinase activity of mTORC2. However, we do not know the precise mechanisms by which PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 regulates mTORC2 kinase activity. PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, may directly regulate the kinase activity of mTOR or one of the components of the complex. Several of the mTORC2 components contain PH domains and may subject to regulation by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Further work is needed to characterize these detailed mechanisms."

The fundamental challenge is to decipher the “neural choreography” associated with complex behaviors and functions, including thoughts, memories, actions, and emotions. This demands the acquisition and integration of vast amounts of data of many types, at multiple scales in time and in space. Here we discuss the need for neuroinformatics approaches to accelerate progress, using several illustrative examples. The nascent field of “connectomics” aims to comprehensively describe neuronal connectivity at either a macroscopic level (in long-distance pathways for the entire brain) or a microscopic level (among axons, dendrites, and synapses in a small brain region). The Neuroscience Information Framework (NIF) encompasses all of neuroscience and facilitates the integration of existing knowledge and databases of many types. These examples illustrate the opportunities and challenges of data mining across multiple tiers of neuroscience information and underscore the need for cultural and infrastructure changes if neuroinformatics is to fulfill its potential to advance our understanding of the brain."

https://openalex.org/W2062212264,"Diabetes mellitus predisposes the host to bacterial infections. Moreover, hyperglycemia has been shown to be an independent risk factor for respiratory infections. The luminal surface of airway epithelia is covered by a thin layer of airway surface liquid (ASL) and is normally sterile despite constant exposure to bacteria. The balance between bacterial growth and killing in the airway determines the outcome of exposure to inhaled or aspirated bacteria: infection or sterility. We hypothesized that restriction of carbon sources –including glucose– in the ASL is required for sterility of the lungs. We found that airway epithelia deplete glucose from the ASL via a novel mechanism involving polarized expression of GLUT-1 and GLUT-10, intracellular glucose phosphorylation, and low relative paracellular glucose permeability in well-differentiated cultures of human airway epithelia and in segments of airway epithelia excised from human tracheas. Moreover, we found that increased glucose concentration in the ASL augments growth of P. aeruginosa in vitro and in the lungs of hyperglycemic ob/ob and db/db mice in vivo. In contrast, hyperglycemia had no effect on intrapulmonary bacterial growth of a P. aeruginosa mutant that is unable to utilize glucose as a carbon source. Our data suggest that depletion of glucose in the airway epithelial surface is a novel mechanism for innate immunity. This mechanism is important for sterility of the airways and has implications in hyperglycemia and conditions that result in disruption of the epithelial barrier in the lung."

In this study, we investigated whether this variability could be influenced by age or sex hormones in humans. To this end, we studied LINE-1 methylation in vivo in blood-derived DNA from individuals aged 18 to 64 years and from young healthy females at various hormone levels during the menstrual cycle. Our results show that no significant association with age was observed. However, the previously reported increase of LINE-1 methylation in males was reconfirmed. In females, although no correlation between LINE-1 or Alu methylation and hormone levels was observed, a significant stable individual specific level of methylation was noted. In vitro results largely confirmed these findings, as neither estrogen nor dihydrotestosterone affected LINE-1 or Alu methylation in Hek293T, HUVEC, or MDA-kb2 cell lines. In contrast, a decrease in methylation was observed in estrogen-treated T47-Kbluc cell lines strongly expressing estrogen receptor. The very low expression of estrogen receptor in blood cells could explain the observed insensitivity of methylation at LINE-1 to natural hormonal variations in females. In conclusion, neither natural cycle of hormones nor age has a detectable effect on the LINE-1 methylation in peripheral blood cells, while gender remains an important factor."

Safety was assessed by comparing genitourinary (GU) adverse events (AEs), colposcopy findings, vaginal lactobacilli and laboratory abnormalities by arm. Results Fifty-four women were enrolled; 35 in the VivaGel arm and 19 in the placebo arm. Twenty-six (74%) and 10 (53%) women reported taking all doses of VivaGel and placebo, respectively. No grade 3 or 4 AEs, or serious AEs occurred. Twenty-five (71%) participants in the VivaGel arm compared to 10 (53%) participants in the placebo arm had at least one grade 1 or 2 GU AE associated with product use (RR = 1.4, 95% CI 0.8-2.2). All seven grade 2 GU AEs associated with product use occurred among four women in the VivaGel arm. Vulvar and cervical erythema, cervical lesions, symptomatic BV, urinary frequency and metrorrhagia were more common in the VivaGel arm than the placebo arm. Twenty-nine (83%) participants in the VivaGel arm had a colposcopic finding compared to 10 (53%) participants in the placebo arm (RR = 1.6, 95%CI = 1.0-2.5). Two women in the VivaGel arm prematurely discontinued product use themselves due to a reported GU AE. Persistence of H2O2-producing and non-producing lactobacilli did not differ by study arm.

In several pathogenic bacteria, c-di-GMP has been associated with the regulation of virulence factors and the development of chronic infections. During long term cystic fibrosis lung infections, increased persistence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa correlates with the generation of adaptive colony morphotypes. This includes mucoid colonies and small colony variants, auto-aggregative, hyper-adherent cells whose appearance correlates with poor lung function and persistence of infection. Both morphotypes are strongly linked to elevated levels of c-di-GMP, implicating a central role for this second messenger in chronic P. aeruginosa infections (8Malone J.G. Jaeger T. Spangler C.

These studies emphasize the clinical significance of c-di-GMP and stress the importance for understanding c-di-GMP signaling in the pseudomonads.c-di-GMP comprises two guanosine monophosphate molecules that are symmetrically connected by 5′-3′ phosphodiester bonds, forming a 12-membered ring (see Fig. 1A). It is synthesized from two molecules of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) by diguanylate cyclases (GGDEF-containing domains) and hydrolyzed into the linear dinucleotide 5′-phosphoguanylyl-(3′-5′)-guanosine by the activity of c-di-GMP-specific phosphodiesterases (EAL-containing domains) (15Schirmer T. Jenal U. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 724-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The opposing activities of diguanylate cyclases and phosphodiesterases control the intracellular c-di-GMP concentrations, and hence c-di-GMP signaling. Several classes of c-di-GMP effector proteins have been identified so far, including PilZ domain proteins, response regulators, and degenerate GGDEF proteins that have lost catalytic activity (9Duerig A.

The PilZ protein family (named after the type IV pilus control protein in P. aeruginosa) represents the best studied class of effectors. Members of this family have been implicated in a diverse range of cellular functions including exopolysaccharide biosynthesis, flagellar motor activity, and virulence gene expression. However, little information is available about the mechanistic details involved in c-di-GMP-mediated PilZ activation of these cellular processes.Several structures of PilZ domain proteins have been solved in their apo and holo forms. One is the two-domain Vibrio cholerae protein VCA0042. A comparison of apo VCA0042 with its holo structure (20Benach J. Swaminathan S.S. Tamayo R. Handelman S.K. Folta-Stogniew E. Ramos J.E. Forouhar F. Neely H. Seetharaman J. Camilli A. Hunt J.F. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 5153-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) shows that binding of a single c-di-GMP molecule induces a conformational change in the loop connecting the C-terminal PilZ domain to the N-terminal YcgR-N domain. This brings the two domains into close proximity, thereby forming a new allosteric interaction surface with c-di-GMP at their mutual interface. It has been shown recently that YcgR, a homolog of VCA0042 in Escherichia coli, is able to bind to the flagellar motor in its c-di-GMP-bound form (21Boehm A. Kaiser M. Li H. Spangler C. Kasper C.A. Ackermann M. Kaever V. Sourjik V. Roth V. Jenal U. Cell. 2010; 141: 107-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Although VCA0042 appears to bind only one molecule of c-di-GMP and does not alter its quaternary structure upon ligand binding, PP4397 from Pseudomonas putida binding of two molecules of c-di-GMP in the junction of its YcgR-N and PilZ domains results in a dimer-monomer transition (22Ko J. Ryu K.S. Kim H. Shin J.S. Lee J.O. Cheong C. Choi B.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 398: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This suggested that different PilZ domain proteins exhibit distinct binding stoichiometries and mechanistic principles.All structures of c-di-GMP protein complexes solved until today involve multidomain proteins (for review, see Ref. 15Schirmer T. Jenal U. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 724-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). In these structures, the binding of c-di-GMP within a hinge-like region induces an allosteric rearrangement of the neighboring domains via fixation to the ligand. It was proposed that this c-di-GMP-induced domain immobilization represents a general mechanism for signal transduction. In contrast to these multidomain proteins, the PilZ domain PA4608 from P. aeruginosa is a single domain c-di-GMP-binding protein. The apo solution structure of PA4608 was solved by Ramelot et al.

Kennedy M.A. Proteins. 2007; 66: 266-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), who also confirmed binding of c-di-GMP by chemical shift analysis. NMR chemical shift mapping was then used to localize the ligand binding site of PA4608 to one side of the protein surface and to demonstrate that c-di-GMP binds to PA4608 as a dimer (16Christen M. Christen B. Allan M.G. Folcher M. Jenö P. Grzesiek S. Jenal U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 4112-4117Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these analyses demonstrated that PA4608 remains monomeric after ligand binding (16Christen M. Christen B. Allan M.G. Folcher M. Jenö P. Grzesiek S. Jenal U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 4112-4117Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar).Here we report the structure of the complex of PA4608 with c-di-GMP solved by advanced solution NMR techniques. Uniform 13C, 15N isotope labeling of both c-di-GMP and PA4608 allowed the observation of a large number of intermolecular and intraligand NOE contacts, 1DHN and 1DCH ligand and protein residual dipolar couplings (RDCs), and intermolecular hydrogen bond scalar couplings. Both termini of the protein undergo large structural changes upon ligand binding while retaining a certain amount of flexibility. In particular, the C-terminal helix is displaced by the ligand, thereby opening one side of the β-barrel as a binding site, and the N terminus containing the RXXXR PilZ domain motif wraps around the ligand and in turn ties the C-terminal helix in a loose conformation induced by a number of hydrophobic contacts. The rearranged termini expose a highly negatively charged surface on one side of the complex to a possible effector protein. This induced folding of the flexible N terminus containing the PilZ signature RXXXR and the resulting clustering of surface charges may present a general mechanism for c-di-GMP readout by PilZ domains.

Elevated intracellular levels of c-di-GMP generally cause bacteria to change from a motile single-cell state to an adhesive surface-attached multicellular state called biofilm (1Jenal U. Malone J.

Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 7653-7662Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and other cellular functions. In several pathogenic bacteria, c-di-GMP has been associated with the regulation of virulence factors and the development of chronic infections. During long term cystic fibrosis lung infections, increased persistence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa correlates with the generation of adaptive colony morphotypes. This includes mucoid colonies and small colony variants, auto-aggregative, hyper-adherent cells whose appearance correlates with poor lung function and persistence of infection. Both morphotypes are strongly linked to elevated levels of c-di-GMP, implicating a central role for this second messenger in chronic P. aeruginosa infections (8Malone J.G. Jaeger T. Spangler C.

These studies emphasize the clinical significance of c-di-GMP and stress the importance for understanding c-di-GMP signaling in the pseudomonads.c-di-GMP comprises two guanosine monophosphate molecules that are symmetrically connected by 5′-3′ phosphodiester bonds, forming a 12-membered ring (see Fig. 1A). It is synthesized from two molecules of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) by diguanylate cyclases (GGDEF-containing domains) and hydrolyzed into the linear dinucleotide 5′-phosphoguanylyl-(3′-5′)-guanosine by the activity of c-di-GMP-specific phosphodiesterases (EAL-containing domains) (15Schirmer T. Jenal U. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 724-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The opposing activities of diguanylate cyclases and phosphodiesterases control the intracellular c-di-GMP concentrations, and hence c-di-GMP signaling. Several classes of c-di-GMP effector proteins have been identified so far, including PilZ domain proteins, response regulators, and degenerate GGDEF proteins that have lost catalytic activity (9Duerig A.

Fong J.C. Shikuma N.J. Beyhan S. Navarro M.V. Yildiz F.H. Sondermann H. Science. 2010; 327: 866-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The PilZ protein family (named after the type IV pilus control protein in P. aeruginosa) represents the best studied class of effectors. Members of this family have been implicated in a diverse range of cellular functions including exopolysaccharide biosynthesis, flagellar motor activity, and virulence gene expression. However, little information is available about the mechanistic details involved in c-di-GMP-mediated PilZ activation of these cellular processes.Several structures of PilZ domain proteins have been solved in their apo and holo forms. One is the two-domain Vibrio cholerae protein VCA0042. A comparison of apo VCA0042 with its holo structure (20Benach J. Swaminathan S.S. Tamayo R. Handelman S.K. Folta-Stogniew E. Ramos J.E. Forouhar F. Neely H. Seetharaman J. Camilli A. Hunt J.F. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 5153-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) shows that binding of a single c-di-GMP molecule induces a conformational change in the loop connecting the C-terminal PilZ domain to the N-terminal YcgR-N domain. This brings the two domains into close proximity, thereby forming a new allosteric interaction surface with c-di-GMP at their mutual interface. It has been shown recently that YcgR, a homolog of VCA0042 in Escherichia coli, is able to bind to the flagellar motor in its c-di-GMP-bound form (21Boehm A. Kaiser M. Li H. Spangler C. Kasper C.A. Ackermann M. Kaever V. Sourjik V. Roth V. Jenal U. Cell. 2010; 141: 107-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Although VCA0042 appears to bind only one molecule of c-di-GMP and does not alter its quaternary structure upon ligand binding, PP4397 from Pseudomonas putida binding of two molecules of c-di-GMP in the junction of its YcgR-N and PilZ domains results in a dimer-monomer transition (22Ko J. Ryu K.S. Kim H. Shin J.S. Lee J.O. Cheong C. Choi B.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 398: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This suggested that different PilZ domain proteins exhibit distinct binding stoichiometries and mechanistic principles.All structures of c-di-GMP protein complexes solved until today involve multidomain proteins (for review, see Ref. 15Schirmer T. Jenal U. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 724-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). In these structures, the binding of c-di-GMP within a hinge-like region induces an allosteric rearrangement of the neighboring domains via fixation to the ligand. It was proposed that this c-di-GMP-induced domain immobilization represents a general mechanism for signal transduction. In contrast to these multidomain proteins, the PilZ domain PA4608 from P. aeruginosa is a single domain c-di-GMP-binding protein. The apo solution structure of PA4608 was solved by Ramelot et al.

https://openalex.org/W2134656515,"The identities of the digits of the avian forelimb are disputed. Whereas paleontological findings support the position that the digits correspond to digits one, two, and three, embryological evidence points to digit two, three, and four identities. By using transplantation and cell-labeling experiments, we found that the posteriormost digit in the wing does not correspond to digit four in the hindlimb; its progenitor segregates early from the zone of polarizing activity, placing it in the domain of digit three specification. We suggest that an avian-specific shift uncouples the digit anlagen from the molecular mechanisms that pattern them, resulting in the imposition of digit one, two, and three identities on the second, third, and fourth anlagens."
https://openalex.org/W2021125816,"Megalin is a large endocytic receptor with relevant functions during development and adult life. It is expressed at the apical surface of several epithelial cell types, including proximal tubule cells (PTCs) in the kidney, where it internalizes apolipoproteins, vitamins and hormones with their corresponding carrier proteins and signaling molecules. Despite the important physiological roles of megalin little is known about the regulation of its expression. By analyzing the human megalin promoter, we found three response elements for the peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR). The objective of this study was to test whether megalin expression is regulated by the PPARs.Treatment of epithelial cell lines with PPARα or PPARγ ligands increased megalin mRNA and protein expression. The stimulation of megalin mRNA expression was blocked by the addition of specific PPARα or PPARγ antagonists. Furthermore, PPAR bound to three PPAR response elements located in the megalin promoter, as shown by EMSA, and PPARα and its agonist activated a luciferase construct containing a portion of the megalin promoter and the first response element. Accordingly, the activation of PPARα and PPARγ enhanced megalin expression in mouse kidney. As previously observed, high concentrations of bovine serum albumin (BSA) decreased megalin in PTCs in vitro; however, PTCs pretreated with PPARα and PPARγ agonists avoided this BSA-mediated reduction of megalin expression. Finally, we found that megalin expression was significantly inhibited in the PTCs of rats that were injected with BSA to induce tubulointerstitial damage and proteinuria. Treatment of these rats with PPARγ agonists counteracted the reduction in megalin expression and the proteinuria induced by BSA.PPARα/γ and their agonists positively control megalin expression. This regulation could have an important impact on several megalin-mediated physiological processes and on pathophysiologies such as chronic kidney disease associated with diabetes and hypertension, in which megalin expression is impaired."

https://openalex.org/W2155367811,"The majority of bird species studied to date have molt schedules that are not concurrent with other energy demanding life history stages, an outcome assumed to arise from energetic trade-offs. Empirical studies reveal that molt is one of the most energetically demanding and perplexingly inefficient growth processes measured. Furthermore, small birds, which have the highest mass-specific basal metabolic rates (BMR(m)), have the highest costs of molt per gram of feathers produced. However, many small passerines, including white-plumed honeyeaters (WPHE; Lichenostomus penicillatus), breed in response to resource availability at any time of year, and do so without interrupting their annual molt. We examined the energetic cost of molt in WPHE by quantifying weekly changes in minimum resting metabolic rate (RMR(min)) during a natural-molt period in 7 wild-caught birds. We also measured the energetic cost of feather replacement in a second group of WPHEs that we forced to replace an additional 25% of their plumage at the start of their natural molt period. Energy expenditure during natural molt revealed an energy conversion efficiency of just 6.9% (±0.57) close to values reported for similar-sized birds from more predictable north-temperate environments. Maximum increases in RMR(min) during the molt of WPHE, at 82% (±5.59) above individual pre-molt levels, were some of the highest yet reported. Yet RMR(min) maxima during molt were not coincident with the peak period of feather replacement in naturally molting or plucked birds. Given the tight relationship between molt efficiency and mass-specific metabolic rate in all species studied to date, regardless of life-history pattern (Efficiency (%) = 35.720 x 10(-0.494BMRm); r² = 0.944; p = or < 0.0001), there appears to be concomitant physiological costs entrained in the molt period that is not directly due to feather replacement. Despite these high total expenditures, the protracted molt period of WPHE significantly reduces these added costs on a daily basis."
https://openalex.org/W2083300500,"Background False truffles are ecologically important as mycorrhizal partners of trees and evolutionarily highly interesting as the result of a shift from epigeous mushroom-like to underground fruiting bodies. Since its first description by Vittadini in 1831, inappropriate species concepts in the highly diverse false truffle genus Hymenogaster has led to continued confusion, caused by a large variety of prevailing taxonomical opinions. Methodology In this study, we reconsidered the species delimitations in Hymenogaster based on a comprehensive collection of Central European taxa comprising more than 140 fruiting bodies from 20 years of field work. The ITS rDNA sequence dataset was subjected to phylogenetic analysis as well as clustering optimization using OPTSIL software. Conclusions Among distinct species concepts from the literature used to create reference partitions for clustering optimization, the broadest concept resulted in the highest agreement with the ITS data. Our results indicate a highly variable morphology of H. citrinus and H. griseus, most likely linked to environmental influences on the phenology (maturity, habitat, soil type and growing season). In particular, taxa described in the 19th century frequently appear as conspecific. Conversely, H. niveus appears as species complex comprising seven cryptic species with almost identical macro- and micromorphology. H. intermedius and H. huthii are described as novel species, each of which with a distinct morphology intermediate between two species complexes. A revised taxonomy for one of the most taxonomically difficult genera of Basidiomycetes is proposed, including an updated identification key. The (semi-)automated selection among species concepts used here is of importance for the revision of taxonomically problematic organism groups in general."
https://openalex.org/W2099456549,"RPB5-mediating protein (RMP) is associated with the RNA polymerase II subunit RPB5. RMP functionally counteracts the transcriptional activation of hepatitis B virus X protein that has been shown to play a role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the effect of RMP on the growth of HCC remains unclear. In this study, we characterized the potential role of RMP in the proliferation of human HCC cells using two cell lines, SMMC-7721 and HepG2. We found that RMP expression increased when HCC cells were treated with 60Co γ-irradiation. Cell growth and colony formation assays suggest that RMP plays an antiapoptotic role in the proliferation and growth of HCC cells. We also show that RMP depletion induced the G2 arrest of HCC cells characterized by the decreased expression of Cdk1 and Cyclin B. Tumor formation assays further confirmed the in vivo requirement of RMP during HCC growth. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that RMP is a radiation-sensitive factor, and it may play essential roles in HCC growth by affecting the proliferation and apoptosis of HCC cells.

Eukaryotic RNA polymerase II transcribes mRNA and microRNA genes (1Venters B.J. Pugh B.F. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2009; 44: 117-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 2Sims 3rd, R.J.

RMP is a RPB5-associated protein. The RMP gene was first isolated and cloned from a human HepG2 cDNA library more than a decade ago (11Dorjsuren D. Lin Y. Wei W. Yamashita T. Nomura T. Hayashi N. Murakami S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7546-7555Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Since then, multiple RMP variants or homologs have been reported in humans and other species. These RMP variants play multiple functions during development. The unconventional prefoldin RPB5 interactor (URI), an alternative form of RMP, was shown to participate in a nutrient-related signaling pathway that is required for gene expression (12Gstaiger M. Luke B. Hess D. Oakeley E.J. Wirbelauer C. Blondel M. Vigneron M. Peter M. Krek W. Science. 2003; 302: 1208-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). URI-1 is the RMP homolog in Caenorhabditis elegans. It has been demonstrated that URI-1 is required to maintain genome stability by playing an important function in controlling cell cycle (13Parusel C.T. Kritikou E.A. Hengartner M.O. Krek W. Gotta M. Development. 2006; 133: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Depletion of URI-1 increases DNA breaks and induces G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (13Parusel C.T. Kritikou E.A. Hengartner M.O. Krek W. Gotta M. Development. 2006; 133: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Uri, the RMP homolog in Drosophila, has also been shown to be required for normal development by playing essential roles in transcriptional regulation and genome integrity maintenance (14Kirchner J. Vissi E. Gross S. Szoor B. Rudenko A. Alphey L. White-Cooper H. BMC Mol. Biol. 2008; 9: 36Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In humans, RMP/URI is a component of the multiprotein PAF1 complex that is involved in histone methylation, gene expression, and cell cycle regulation. URI interacts with Paf1 and parafibromin, a tumor suppressor. Dysfunction of parafibromin and Paf1 promotes cell progression into S phase, suggesting that RMP/URI is involved in cell cycle regulation (15Yart A. Gstaiger M. Wirbelauer C. Pecnik M. Anastasiou D. Hess D. Krek W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5052-5060Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). As a major regulator of transcription and the cell cycle, RMP may also play a role in tumor formation. It has been reported that NNX3, a variant of RMP that lacks the first 50 N-terminal amino acids, is a potential marker for Reed-Sternberg cells in Hodgkin lymphoma (16Van Leuven F. Torrekens S. Moechars D. Hilliker C. Buellens M. Bollen M. Delabie J. Genomics. 1998; 54: 511-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that RMP associates with RPB5, suppressing transcriptional activation via HBx. In addition, we have shown that the overexpression of HBx releases the inhibitory effect of RMP on transcriptional activation (11Dorjsuren D. Lin Y. Wei W. Yamashita T. Nomura T. Hayashi N. Murakami S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7546-7555Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 17Wei W. Gu J.X. Zhu C.Q. Sun F.Y. Dorjsuren D. Lin Y. Murakami S. Cell Res. 2003; 13: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Given the multiple functions of RMP, we surmised that RMP might be involved in the growth of HCC by affecting proliferation, transformation, or apoptosis. To investigate the biological functions of RMP, we generated the human HCC cell lines SMMC-721 and HepG2, whereby RMP was either overexpressed or depleted. The potential role of RMP in tumor cell proliferation was examined in these HCC cell lines. Our results showed that RMP strongly promoted the proliferation of HCC cells, whereas the depletion of RMP resulted in growth inhibition and apoptosis. Moreover, our tumor formation assays further demonstrated that RMP is required for HCC growth in vivo. The plasmid pFLAGCMV4 was a gift from Dr. Danny Reinberg (University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey). NKCFLAG-RMP was obtained from Dr. Seishi Murakami (Kanazawa University, Japan). pGPU6-Neo was purchased from Jima Co. (Shanghai, China). SMMC-7721 and HepG2 human HCC cell lines were obtained from the laboratory of the Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology at Soochow University. Cells were maintained in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sino-American Biotechnology Co, Shanghai, China). The Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide (PI) apoptosis detection kit was purchased from BD Biosciences (Shanghai, China). 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) was purchased from Sigma. Antibodies against Bax, Bcl-2, c-Myc, α-fetal protein (AFP), and Cyclin B1 were purchased from Boster Company (Wuhan, China). Antibodies for p53, p21, Cdk1, and β-actin were purchased from Biosynthesis Biotechnology Company (Beijing, China). The RMP antibody was a gift from Dr. Seishi Murakami. For depletion of RMP, three small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting different regions of human RMP were designed and commercially synthesized (Jima Co., Shanghai, China). The sequences of the sense strand of three siRNAs are as follows: RMPi, 5′-GGA UUU GCU AGC UGA UAA ATT-3′; RMPi1, 5;-GGU AGA UAA UGA CUA UAA UTT-3′; and RMPi2, 5′-AGA GGG UUU CAA AGU UUA ATT-3′. To generate double-stranded siRNAs, equal molar amounts of complementary sense and antisense strands were mixed, annealed, and cooled slowly to 10 °C in 50 μl of reaction buffer (100 mm NaCl and 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Because RMPi showed the most efficient depletion of RMP, its complimentary sense strand DNA was synthesized (5′-CAC CGG ATT TGC TAG CTG ATA AAT TCA AGA GAT TTA TCA GCT AGC AA A TCC TTT TTT GGA TCC-3′). As a control, a scrambled sequence (SCR) of RMPi was also synthesized. The forward sequence of SCR was 5′-CAC CGT TCT CCG AAC GTG TCA CGT CAA GAG ATT ACG TGA CAC GTT CGG AGA ATT TTT TG-3′. The annealed, double-stranded oligomers were digested and inserted into the BamHI and BbsI sites of pGPU6-Neo. For the overexpression construct, RMP was amplified by PCR with the following primers: 5′-TCA AGC TTA TGA GGC TAG GAA ATG-3′ and 5′-ATG GAT CCC TAG TCT TTC TGT TGC-3′. The RMP fragment was digested and inserted into the BamHI and HindIII sites of plasmid pFLAGCMV4. A total of 2 × 105 SMMC-7721 or HepG2 cells were seeded into each well of a 24-well plate. After incubating for 24 h, these cells were transfected with LipofectamaineTM2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were transfected with plasmids pGPU6/Neo-RMPi for RMP depletion and pFLAGCMV4-RMP for RMP overexpression. Both pGPU6/Neo-SCR and vector alone (pFLAGCMV4) were used as negative controls. Selection of stably transfected cells and Western blot analysis were conducted as described previously (18Gu J. Sun D. Zheng Q. Wang X. Yang H. Miao J. Jiang J. Wei W. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. 2009; 41: 831-838Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis of xenograft tumors, tissue samples were first homogenized and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C for 1 h. Then, crude lysates were collected and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were then subjected to Western blot analysis. MTT assays were carried out as described previously (18Gu J. Sun D. Zheng Q. Wang X. Yang H. Miao J. Jiang J. Wei W. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. 2009; 41: 831-838Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, after SMMC-7721 and HepG2 cells were cultured for 24 h, 30 μl of MTT (5 mg/ml) was added to each well. Crystals were formed and then dissolved by adding 300 μl of isopropyl alcohol acidified with HCl (0.04 n) containing 10% Triton X-100. Then, 200 μl of the blue formazan mixtures was transferred to 96-well plates. The plates were read at 570 nm using a Microplate Reader (model 550; Bio-Rad). A total of 1 × 105 SMMC-7721 cells were seeded into each well of a 24-well plate and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. After incubation, the cultures were fixed in 100% ethanol and stained with 0.005% crystal violet (Sigma). Cell colonies were visualized by microscopy. Colony-forming efficiency was performed by counting the number of colonies that had at least 50 cells. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and colony numbers are an average of these three experiments. SMMC-7721 cells were exposed to ionizing radiation using a 60Co γ-irradiator at a dose of 2 or 6 Gy. Cells were then stained with Annexin V-FITC and PI and analyzed for apoptosis according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, after two treatments with washing buffer, cells were resuspended in 400 μl of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Then, 100 μl of this cell suspension was incubated with 10 μl of PI (50 μg/ml) and 5 μl of Annexin V-FITC for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. Cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells that stained positive for only Annexin V-FITC were in the early stage of apoptosis, whereas cells that stained positive for both Annexin V-FITC and PI were in the stage of late apoptosis or primary necrosis. Hoechst 33258 staining was used to investigate the changes in the nucleus of apoptotic cells. Apoptotic bodies containing nuclear fragments were found in apoptotic cells by fluorescence microscopy. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry was carried out as described (18Gu J. Sun D. Zheng Q. Wang X. Yang H. Miao J. Jiang J. Wei W. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. 2009; 41: 831-838Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For the in vivo tumor formation assay, 5 × 106 SMMC-7721 cells in 0.1 ml of PBS were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of 15–20-g female nude mice (Animal Center of Soochow University). Each group consisted of five mice. Tumor size and volume were measured every 2 days. To examine the effect of RMP on the growth of established tumors, mice with established xenograft tumors were subjected to RMP treatment 2 weeks later. Briefly, 100 μg of various RMP expression vectors was injected into tumors every other day for 2 weeks. The tumor size and volume were also measured every 2 days. At the end of the 4th week, tumors from mice with or without RMP treatment were dissociated and evaluated. The animal operations and procedures were approved by the Committee on the Use of Live Animals in Teaching and Research of Soochow University. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) and was reverse-transcribed using the Thermoscript RT system (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR was performed using 2 μl of complementary DNA and 0.2 unit of Hot start TaqDNA polymerase in a 20-μl reaction volume. The reaction was performed for 30 cycles with 94 °C denaturation for 30 s, 56 °C annealing for 30 s, and 72 °C elongation for 45 s. Primers for RMP were 5′-TCA AGC TTA TGA GGC TAG GAA ATG-3′ and 5′-ATG GAT CCC TAG TCT TTC TGT TGC-3′. Primers for GAPDH were 5′-TGA TGA CAT CAA GAA GGT GGT GAA-3′ and 5′-TCC TTG GAG GCC ATG TGG GCC AT-3′. Slides for both cultured cells and xenograft tumors were prepared for subsequent immunohistochemistry assays. Specifically, SMMC-7721 cells cultured on slides for 48 h were washed with PBST (0.2% Triton-X) and then fixed for 4 min in 1% formaldehyde in PBST before being freeze-cracked. The slides were transferred to −20 °C cold methanol for 6 min and washed in PBS three times for 5 min each. Meanwhile, xenograft tumors dissociated from nude mice were subjected to formalin fixation, paraffin embedding, and sectioning. The slides were blocked for 30 min in PBST containing 3% BSA (PBST-BSA) at 37 °C and incubated overnight at 4 °C with mouse monoclonal antibodies (1:500 in PBST-BSA). Slides were then washed three times in PBST (10 min at room temperature) and incubated for 2 h with the secondary antibody (anti-mouse HRP, 1:200) in PBST at room temperature. After incubation, slides were washed three times (10 min each) in PBST and mounted with 3 μl of Vectashield for further analysis. SMMC-7721 cells, either exposed to 6 Gy of irradiation or not, were cultured for 72 h in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were arrested in mitosis by a 30-min treatment of colcemid (0.12 mg/ml; Invitrogen) before being harvested and incubated in 75 mm KCl for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were centrifuged, and 107 cells were incubated in 5 ml of freshly prepared fixative (acetic acid/methanol at a 1:3 v/v ratio). The fixation step was repeated twice, and cells were dropped on ethanol-cleaned microscope slides. Slides were aged for a minimum of 1 week in ambient air at 20 °C and then sealed in plastic bags and stored at −20 °C. Slides were stained by Giemsa and observed under a microscope. The mitotic index was calculated as the percentage of dividing cells of the total HCC cells counted. Values are expressed as the means ± S.E. Student's t test was used to determine the significance of the difference between compared groups. p < 0.05 indicated significant differences. URI-1, the homolog of human RMP in C. elegans, is associated with the maintenance of genome stability (13Parusel C.T. Kritikou E.A. Hengartner M.O. Krek W. Gotta M. Development. 2006; 133: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We investigated whether human RMP responded to DNA damage in a similar way. DNA damage was induced in SMMC-7721 cells by 60Co γ-irradiation, after which RMP expression was examined. As shown in Fig. 1A, SMMC-7721 cells that were γ-irradiated at 2 and 6 Gy appeared shrunken and displayed fewer intercellular connections compared with untreated cells (left upper panel). Flow cytometry analyses showed that increasing amounts of γ-irradiation resulted in more apoptotic cells in SMMC-7721 cultures (Fig. 1A, left lower and right panels). The expression level of the proapoptotic factor Bax and the antiapoptotic factor Bcl-2 was examined by Western blotting. The results demonstrated that Bax expression was increased and Bcl-2 expression was decreased sharply after increasing amounts of irradiation (Fig. 1B). Notably, the expression of RMP in SMMC-7721 cells significantly increased upon exposure to γ-irradiation (Fig. 1B), suggesting that RMP is a radiation-sensitive gene and may play a role in the apoptosis of HCC cells. To investigate the biological function of RMP, three double-stranded siRNAs (RMPi, RMPi1, and RMPi2) were synthesized and examined for their ability to knock down RMP expression in SMMC-7721 cells. Among the three interfering sequences, RMPi showed the highest efficiency for the depletion of RMP (Fig. 2A). Therefore, we established a stable cell line that constantly expresses RMPi, effectively knocking down RMP expression. As seen in Fig. 2B, RMPi resulted in a dramatic inhibition of RMP expression compared with a SCR interference sequence. We also generated a stable SMMC-7721 cell line that overexpressed RMP (RMPo) compared with control cells transfected with vector alone or untransfected cells (Fig. 2B). Notably, when HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with the RMPi or RMPo expression plasmids, RMP depletion or expression was also observed (Fig. 2C). Using SMMC-7721 stable cell lines, we examined the effects of RMP on the proliferation of HCC cells. As shown in Fig. 3Aa, MTT assays revealed that RMP depletion resulted in decreased cell proliferation, whereas control cells transfected with SCR or vector alone were unaffected compared with the untransfected SMMC-7721 cells. SMMC-7721 cells overexpressing RMP showed the highest growth rate of all stable cell lines examined (Fig. 3Aa). HepG2 cells were also transfected with the RMP-depleting vector (RMPi). However, we failed to establish a HepG2 cell line with a stable depletion of RMP. All transfected cells died within 3 weeks of selection, suggesting that HepG2 cells are more sensitive to RMP depletion than are the SMMC-7721 cells. To examine the effect of RMP on the growth of HepG2 cells, we performed MTT assays with transiently transfected HepG2 cells. As shown in Fig. 3Ab, HepG2 cells transfected with RMPi demonstrated delayed growth, whereas cells overexpressing RMP grew faster than control cells either transfected with vector alone or untransfected. A dose-dependent effect of RMP on HepG2 cell growth was also observed. Increasing amounts of RMP-depleting vector (RMPi) resulted in stronger growth inhibition, as shown in Fig. 3Ac. Additionally, increasing amounts of the RMP-expressing vector (RMPo) promoted proliferation of HepG2 cells, as shown in Fig. 3Ad. To confirm the finding that RMP is required for the proliferation of HCC cells, we performed colony formation assays. The results showed that the colony-forming capacity of RMP-depleted transfectants (RMPi) was significantly lower than that of controls (Fig. 3B). However, SMMC-7721 cells overexpressing RMP (RMPo) demonstrated a significantly higher colony formation capacity than controls (Fig. 3B). To investigate the biological impact of RMP on HCC growth in vivo, xenograft tumors were generated in nude mice. SMMC-7721 cells stably transfected with RMPi, RMPo, SCR, or vector alone were injected into 6-week-old female nude mice. As expected, mice injected with cells overexpressing RMP developed much larger solid tumors compared with mice injected with SCR or vector only. However, no tumors developed in any of the mice injected with SMMC-7721 cells depleted of RMP (RMPi cells) (Fig. 4A, upper and lower left panels). There was no change in the mean body weight of mice treated with RMPo and RMPi compared with mice treated with control cells (Fig. 4A, lower right panel). We also examined the effects of RMP on the growth of established tumors in nude mice. Xenograft tumors formed in nude mice 2 weeks after injection. Then, we locally administered either the RMP-depleting vector (RMPi) or the RMP-expressing vector (RMPo) by intratumor injection. Our results demonstrated that the growth of tumors treated with RMPi was significantly inhibited compared with that of the controls treated with SCR vector or PBS (Fig. 4B). In contrast, tumors injected with RMPo grew at the fastest rate of all groups examined (Fig. 4B). These results demonstrated that RMP is a critical modulator in the growth of xenograft tumors, which is consistent with the in vitro results as shown in Fig. 3. As the results above suggested that RMP was required for the proliferation of HCC cells, we tested its effect on apoptosis with stable SMMC-7721 cell lines expressing RMPi, RMPo, or SCR. Cells were exposed to 60Co γ-irradiation (6 Gy) to induce DNA damage and apoptosis. Then, the apoptosis level was analyzed by flow cytometry at 0, 24, and 48 h after irradiation. Although both early and late apoptotic cells were increased in all groups after irradiation, many more apoptotic cells were observed when RMP was down-regulated compared with SCR control cells. In contrast, the smallest increase in the apoptotic rate was seen in cells overexpressing RMP (RMPo) compared with cells transfected with RMPi and SCR (Fig. 5, A and B). To confirm the effect of RMP knockdown on apoptosis, SMMC-7721 cells were also stained with Hoechst. These studies demonstrated that cells with RMP depletion showed significant DNA condensation and more fragmented nuclei compared with control cells with or without SCR transfection (Fig. 5C). These observations indicated that RMP depletion could induce apoptosis in SMMC-7721 cells. To investigate the mechanism of RMP on HCC proliferation, SMMC-7721 cells were subjected to cell cycle analysis. SMMC-7721 cells depleted of RMP were compared with the SCR control cells and untransfected SMMC-7721 cells. As shown in Fig. 6, A and B, more cells with RMP depletion were arrested in the G2/M phase than control cells with or without SCR transfection. These results indicate that RMP plays a critical role in regulating the G2/M phase transition during the cell cycle. To confirm further the effect of RMP depletion on G2/M arrest, SMMC-7721 cells were exposed to 60Co γ-irradiation because G2 is a radiosensitive phase of the cell cycle (19Stark G.R. Taylor W.R. Mol. Biotechnol. 2006; 32: 227-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 20Stark G.R. Taylor W.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 280: 51-82PubMed Google Scholar, 21Turner J. Koumenis C. Kute T.E.

Cell cycle analysis was carried out by flow cytometry at 24, 48, and 72 h after irradiation. As shown in Fig. 6, A and B, increasing numbers of cells were arrested in the G2/M phase after irradiation. However, there were more RMP-depleted cells that were arrested in the G2/M phase compared with control cells (untransfected and SCR) (Fig. 6, A and B). To test whether this arrest occurred in the G2 or M phase, the cells with RMP depletion were subjected to mitotic chromosome analysis (22Golfier S. Jost G. Pietsch H. Lengsfeld P. Eckardt-Schupp F. Schmid E. Voth M. Radiat. Prot. Dosimetry. 2009; 134: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The results showed that the mitotic index was 1.2% before irradiation and 1.8% at 72 h after irradiation (Fig. 6C). There was no significant difference between these mitotic indexes, indicating that cells were arrested in the G2 phase rather than in M phase. To elucidate the mechanism of RMP in apoptosis, we examined the expression of apoptotic genes in xenograft tumors by immunohistochemistry. As expected, the expression of RMP and Bcl-2 was elevated in tumors overexpressing RMP, whereas Bax expression was decreased in the RMPo tumors compared with the vector only control (Fig. 7A). Notably, we also observed an increased expression of AFP in tumors overexpressing RMP (Fig. 7A). Western blot analysis was also performed to confirm the expression of apoptotic genes in xenograft tumors. As shown in Fig. 7B, RMP expression increased in the tumor that was transfected with the RMP expression plasmid (RMPo), whereas the expression level of Bax was lower in the RMPo tumor compared with the vector control (Fig. 7B). In contrast, the expression of the antiapoptotic factor Bcl-2 in RMPo tumors was higher than that in the tumors treated with vector alone. Because no tumors developed in nude mice injected with RMPi cells, we examined the expression of apoptotic genes in the cultured RMPi cells by immunostaining. We found that the expression of both Bax and p53 was increased, but Bcl-2 expression was decreased in cells depleted of RMP compared with the SCR control (Fig. 7C). RMP depletion also reduced the expression of AFP (Fig. 7C). We further investigated the expression of apoptotic factors in the SMMC-7721 cells by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 7D, the expression of the proapoptotic factor Bax was elevated in the RMP-depleted cells (RMPi) compared with SCR or untransfected cells. The expression of the proapoptotic factor c-Myc was also increased by RMP depletion, in a manner similar to Bax. In contrast, the expression of the antiapoptotic factor Bcl-2 was decreased in RMPi cells (Fig. 7D). Additionally, Western blot analysis also showed the down-regulation of AFP in RMPi cells, consistent with the immunostaining studies shown in Fig. 7C. We also examined the expression of G2 relevant checkpoint regulators. The Cdk1/Cyclin B complex is the most critical regulator for the G2 checkpoint (19Stark G.R. Taylor W.R. Mol. Biotechnol. 2006; 32: 227-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 20Stark G.R. Taylor W.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 280: 51-82PubMed Google Scholar, 21Turner J. Koumenis C. Kute T.E.

We observed a significantly decreased expression of both Cdk1 and Cyclin B1 in the RMP-depleted cells compared with the control cells (Fig. 7D). However, the expression of p53 and p21, the upstream regulators of the Cdk1/Cyclin B complex, was up-regulated by RMP depletion (Fig. 7D). Overall, these observations suggest that RMP may play an important role in the proliferation and apopotosis of HCC cells. Given the regenerative characteristics of the liver and the hypothesis that RMP might be a cell cycle regulator, we investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms regulating HCC cell cycle, apoptosis and proliferation. RMP appears to compete with HBx for RPB5 binding and antagonize the coactivation of HBx. Here, we provide evidence that RMP is an antiapoptotic factor in HCC. As demonstrated in the HCC cells SMMC-7721 and HepG2, RMP promoted cell proliferation. RMP depletion suppressed HCC cell growth, whereas overexpression of RMP promoted the proliferation of HCC cells, which was confirmed by both HCC cell proliferation and colony formation assays. Overexpression of RMP inhibited the apoptosis of HCC cells, and the depletion of RMP induced apoptosis. Enhanced apoptosis by RMP depletion was also observed when HCC cells were treated by irradiation, whereas the overexpression of RMP suppressed apoptosis. This antiapoptotic property of RMP could also be attributed, at least in part, to its role in the regulation of the G2 cell cycle checkpoint. Bax and Bcl-2 are key factors that regulate apoptosis. Bax homodimers are known to promote apoptosis, whereas Bcl-2 homodimers block apoptosis. The relative expression levels of Bax and Bcl-2 play a critical role in the apoptotic response. Higher levels of Bax promote apoptosis, but higher levels of Bcl-2 block apoptosis to support cell survival. In our study, the depletion of RMP in SMMC-7721 cells up-regulated Bax expression, whereas Bcl-2 expression was down-regulated. This result explains the observed apoptosis in these RMP-depleted cells and the increased apoptosis induced by irradiation. However, overexpression of RMP inhibited apoptosis and favored cell survival, which supports the antiapoptotic role of RMP in HCC cells. SMMC-7721 cells contain wild-type p53 (23Li X. Pan Y. Fan R. Jin H. Han S. Liu J. Wu K. Fan D. Carcinogenesis. 2008; 29: 1587-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), which activates transcription of the Bax gene and inhibits transcription of the Bcl-2 gene. We found that the depletion of RMP down-regulated the expression of Bcl-2, but up-regulated Bax, p53 and p21. These results suggest that RMP regulation of Bax and Bcl-2 in SMMC-7721 cells might be through a p53-dependent pathway. The c-Myc oncogene plays dual functions both in apoptosis and in cell proliferation (24Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 6462-6472Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Our data show that RMP knockdown decreases Bcl-2 expression and at the same time increases the expression of Bax and c-Myc. This result suggests that RMP may promote HCC cell survival by increasing the expression of Bcl-2 while decreasing the expression of Bax and c-Myc. c-Myc might play a proapoptotic rather than a proliferative role in HCC cells under the regulation of RMP. These data also imply that RMP-induced proliferation of HCC cells might work through a c-Myc-independent mechanism. Cell cycle progression is regulated primarily at the G1/S and G2/M phase transitions by a series of checkpoint regulators, including Cdk1 and Cyclin B. Cdk1 (cdc2) is responsible for controlling the transition of G1/S and G2/M (25Dong Y. Sui L. Watanabe Y. Sugimoto K. Tokuda M. Cancer Lett. 2002; 177: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 26Jin P. Hardy S. Morgan D.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The kinase activity of Cdk1 is controlled during the cell cycle by association with Cyclin B, another cell cycle regulator overexpressed in multiple tumors (25Dong Y. Sui L. Watanabe Y. Sugimoto K. Tokuda M. Cancer Lett. 2002; 177: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 26Jin P. Hardy S. Morgan D.O. J.

Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1475-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In our studies, we found that RMP contributes to the regulation of the G2 checkpoint in response to radiation-induced DNA damage. A possible mechanism of RMP at this checkpoint is through regulating the expression of the Cyclin B/Cdk1 complex because depletion of RMP in HCC cells significantly decreased both Cdk1 and Cyclin B1 levels, whereas the overexpression of RMP up-regulated Cdk1 and Cyclin B1. The transcriptional functions of RMP might be distinct from its roles in hepatocarcinogenesis. RMP was previously shown to counteract transcriptional activation by HBx (11Dorjsuren D. Lin Y. Wei W. Yamashita T. Nomura T. Hayashi N. Murakami S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7546-7555Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, both RMP and HBx might possess oncogenic properties, although cooperative or overlapping oncogenic effects could exist between RMP and HBx. Although further investigation is required, our novel discovery that RMP affects the proliferation of HCC cells suggests that RMP plays important roles in the pathways controlling apoptosis and cell cycle. This function makes RMP a candidate molecule that is essential for the elucidation of hepatocarcinogenesis and might also facilitate the identification of novel therapeutic targets of HCC.

There is growing recognition that the field of stem cell science, in part because of its complex IPRs landscape and the importance of cell line collections, may require collective action to facilitate basic and translational research. Access to pluripotent stem cell lines and the information associated with them is critical to the progress of stem cell science, but simple notions of access are substantially complicated by shifting boundaries between what is considered information versus material, person versus artifact, and private property versus the public domain."
https://openalex.org/W2091105623,"Grass is a clip domain serine protease (SP) involved in a proteolytic cascade triggering the Toll pathway activation of Drosophila during an immune response. Epistasic studies position it downstream of the apical protease ModSP and upstream of the terminal protease Spaetzle-processing enzyme. Here, we report the crystal structure of Grass zymogen. We found that Grass displays a rather deep active site cleft comparable with that of proteases of coagulation and complement cascades. A key distinctive feature is the presence of an additional loop (75-loop) in the proximity of the activation site localized on a protruding loop. All biochemical attempts to hydrolyze the activation site of Grass failed, strongly suggesting restricted access to this region. The 75-loop is thus proposed to constitute an original mechanism to prevent spontaneous activation. A comparison of Grass with clip serine proteases of known function involved in analogous proteolytic cascades allowed us to define two groups, according to the presence of the 75-loop and the conformation of the clip domain. One group (devoid of the 75-loop) contains penultimate proteases whereas the other contains terminal proteases. Using this classification, Grass appears to be a terminal protease. This result is evaluated according to the genetic data documenting Grass function."
https://openalex.org/W2027920846,"Many tRNA synthetases are homodimers that are catalytically inactive as monomers. An example is the 528-amino acid human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, which is made up of an N-terminal catalytic unit (TyrRS(Mini)) and a 164-amino acid C-domain. Although native TyrRS has no known cytokine functions, natural proteolysis of secreted TyrRS releases TyrRS(Mini), which not only has the same aminoacylation activity as native TyrRS but also has strong activity for stimulating migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The migration-stimulating activity is dependent on an ELR tripeptide motif, similar to that in CXC cytokines like IL-8, and also has the familiar bell-shaped concentration dependence seen for CXC cytokines. Here we show that in contrast to IL-8, where the bell-shaped dependence arises from the effects of CXCR1/2 receptor internalization, TyrRS(Mini) does not induce internalization of CXCR1/2. A rationally designed non-associating monomer and a non-dissociating dimer were constructed. With these constructs, the bell-shaped concentration dependence of leukocyte migration was shown to arise from the agonist (for migration) activity of the catalytically inactive monomer and the antagonist activity of the catalytically active dimer. Thus, the dissociating quaternary structure of TyrRS(Mini) regulates two opposing cytokine activities and suggests the possibility of dissociating quaternary structures regulating novel functions of other tRNA synthetases."
https://openalex.org/W2085404742,"The yeast Ssy5 protein is a serine-type endoprotease autoprocessed into a catalytic domain and a large inhibitory prodomain. When external amino acids are detected by the plasma membrane Ssy1 sensor, Ssy5 is activated and catalyzes endoproteolytic processing of the Stp1 and Stp2 transcription factors. These Stp proteins then migrate into the nucleus and activate transcription of several amino acid permease genes. Previous studies showed that Ssy5 activation involves the SCFGrr1 ubiquitin ligase complex, but the molecular mechanisms of this activation remain unclear. We here report that the prodomain of Ssy5 is phosphorylated in a casein kinase I-dependent manner in response to amino acid detection. We describe a mutant form of Ssy5 whose prodomain is not phosphorylated and show that it is nonfunctional. Amino acid detection also induces ubiquitylation of the Ssy5 prodomain. This prodomain ubiquitylation requires its prior phosphorylation and the SCFGrr1 complex. When this ubiquitylation is defective, Ssy5 accumulates as a phosphorylated form but remains inactive. A constitutive Ssy5 form in which the prodomain fails to inhibit the catalytic domain does not need to be phosphorylated or ubiquitylated to be active. Finally, we provide evidence that ubiquitylation of the inhibitory prodomain rather than its subsequent degradation is the key step in the Ssy5 activation mechanism. We propose that the Ssy5 protease is activated by phosphorylation-induced ubiquitylation, the effect of which is relief from inhibition by its prodomain."
https://openalex.org/W2020719862,"Bacterial nitric-oxide synthase (NOS)-like proteins are believed to be genuine NOSs. As for cytochromes P450 (CYPs), NOS-proximal ligand is a thiolate that exerts a push effect crucial for the process of dioxygen activation. Unlike CYPs, this catalytic electron donation seems controlled by a hydrogen bond (H-bond) interaction between the thiolate ligand and a vicinal tryptophan. Variations of the strength of this H-bond could provide a direct way to tune the stability along with the electronic and structural properties of NOS. We generated five different mutations of bsNOS Trp66, which can modulate this proximal H-bond. We investigated the effects of these mutations on different NOS complexes (FeIII, FeIICO, and FeIINO), using a combination of UV-visible absorption, EPR, FTIR, and resonance Raman spectroscopies. Our results indicate that (i) the proximal H-bond modulation can selectively decrease or increase the electron donating properties of the proximal thiolate, (ii) this modulation controls the σ-competition between distal and proximal ligands, (iii) this H-bond controls the stability of various NOS intermediates, and (iv) a fine tuning of the electron donation by the proximal ligand is required to allow at the same time oxygen activation and to prevent uncoupling reactions."

The data reveal, in combination with computational models, that the upper halves of both TMDs, which face toward the external medium, are rather rigid, whereas the inner parts are more flexible. The rigidity of the outer TMD is conferred by a number of essential aromatic amino acids that face the membrane and probably anchor this domain in the bilayer.

This structural principle is conserved within the viral K+ channels and also present in Kir2.2, implying a general importance of this architecture for K+ channel function. K+ channels are transmembrane proteins, which catalyze the selective and regulated flux of potassium ions across membranes. A breakthrough in understanding of structure/function correlates in these important proteins occurred with the high-resolution structures determined for several K+ channels (1Doyle D.A.

Many functional properties such as selectivity and gating of K+ channels are now understood on the basis of the specific architecture of these channel proteins. Still, many aspects of function and regulation cannot be explained only on the basis of the protein structure. The performance of the protein also depends on the lipid environment and on the organization of the protein in this environment. Indeed, there is increasing evidence that many different properties of K+ channels are depending on the interaction between the protein and the surrounding host membranes (5Marius P. Zagnoni M.

As a consequence of this dependence, many amphiphilic drugs, which target ion channels, have dual effects, one effect being directly related to an interaction with the protein and a secondary effect being mediated by modification of the bilayer properties (8Lundbaek J.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2008; 131: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A good model system for understanding the interplay of membrane proteins with the membrane is provided by the viral potassium channel Kcv (9Plugge B. Gazzarrini S. Nelson M. Cerana R. Van Etten J.L.

The protein is almost completely embedded in the membrane. Only a small, 15 amino acid-long domain at the N terminus and a short turret domain between the two transmembrane domains stick out of the membrane into aqueous solution (11Tayefeh S. Kloss T.

It can be assumed that in this arrangement any protein/membrane interaction strongly reflects back on function. Unbiased information on the structural significance of the two transmembrane domains (TMDs) 2The abbreviations used are: TMDtransmembrane domainTMD1first, outer transmembrane domainTMD2second, inner transmembrane domainMDmolecular dynamic. and their importance for channel function can be obtained by an alanine scan of the relevant domains. In this approach, each amino acid in a primary sequence is individually replaced by the amino acid alanine, and the effect of this mutation is tested in a functional assay. In this way, it is possible to eliminate all side chain interactions, except for the Cβ atom, without altering the main chain conformation or the insertion of steric effects (12Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar, 13Holst B. Zoffmann S. Elling C.E. Hjorth S.A. Schwartz T.W. Mol.

For these reasons, alanine is the amino acid of choice in the mutagenesis scan. Hence, the replacement of a residue with alanine should reveal the contribution of the replaced residue to the overall stability and fold of the protein (15Clackson T. Wells J.A.

In the present study, we use alanine scanning mutagenesis of the two transmembrane domains of Kcv in conjunction with a structural Kcv model (11Tayefeh S. Kloss T. Kreim M. Gebhardt M. Baumeister D.

The upper part of the outer transmembrane domain is anchored via aromatic side chains with the membrane. A mutual interaction between a pair of amino acids on the two TMDs attaches the inner TMD to the outer TMD and in this way also immobilizes the upper part of TMD2. The application of an elastic network model supports the structural significance of a mutual interaction of these amino acids (17Atilgan A.R. Durell S.R. Jernigan R.L. Demirel M.C. Keskin O. Bahar I.

The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene) was used to insert the point mutations. The point mutations were designed on the primer level or randomized on the primer level by using the wobble base codon NNK (where N is AGCT and K is GT), which codes for all possible amino acids. The resulting constructs were checked by DNA sequencing. Yeast complementation experiments were done with the yeast strain SGY1528 (Mat a ade 2–1 can 1–100 his 3–11,15 leu 2–3,112 trp 1–1 ura 3–1 trk 1::HIS3 trk 2::TRP1) (19Minor Jr., D.L. Masseling S.J.

For the complementation assay, yeasts were grown in parallel under selective (1 mm and 0.5 mm KCl agar plates) and non-selective (100 mm KCl agar plates) conditions for 3 days at 30 °C. To analyze the spatial distribution of amino acids in the channel protein, the MD model of Kcv based on the tetrameric form of the KirBac1.1 (PDB code 1P7B) x-ray template structure was used (11Tayefeh S.

Elastic network models (18Tozzini V. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2010; 43: 333-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) have already been successfully applied to determine vibrational dynamics and kinetically hot residues, avoiding time-consuming molecular dynamics simulations (21Hamacher K. McCammon J.A. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2006; 2: 873-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Such network models use a coarse-grained representation for amino acids by substituting the complex amino acid by a bead on the respective Cα position. Interactions between residues are modeled as harmonic springs for contacts within a cutoff distance. Anisotropic network models (17Atilgan A.R. Durell S.R. Jernigan R.L. Demirel M.C. Keskin O. Bahar I. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 505-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar) additionally invoke anisotropy of positional fluctuations to assess the directions of collective motions. Eigenmodes and eigenfrequencies are derived from the so-called Hessian matrix by diagonalization techniques. The approach to quantify the impact of thought-experiment-style mutations, e.g. altering intramolecular forces up to the full deletion of contacts, is described elsewhere (22Hamacher K. Gene. 2008; 422: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We expanded this approach by computing overlaps of corresponding eigenvectors belonging to eigenvalues greater than zero. This allows us to qualitatively assess the effect the presence or absence of an amino acid pair interaction has on the functional mechanics of the protein. To detect functionally important side chains in the amino acid composition of the transmembrane domains of Kcv, the respective amino acids were replaced one by one by alanine. The two alanines (Ala-22 and Ala-82), which are already present in the TMDs of the wild-type channel (Fig. 1A), were replaced by glycine. All channel mutants were expressed individually in a yeast strain, which lacks a functional K+ uptake system. These yeasts are only able to survive in medium with a high K+ concentration. They do not grow on a selective low K+ medium unless they are expressing a heterologous K+ uptake system (19Minor Jr., D.L. Masseling S.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Fig. 2 shows representative data from a growth assay of the yeast mutants expressing only the vector (pYES2), the Kcv-WT channel, or its mutants. All yeasts transfected with either of the constructs were able to grow on high (100 mm) K+ medium, meaning that the expression of the mutations was deleterious for the cells. The two top rows show that the yeast strain transfected with the vector is, as expected, not able to grow under selective conditions with only 1 mm or 0.5 mm K+. Growth under selective conditions can be rescued by expressing the Kcv-WT channel. Hence, an active viral K+ channel in the plasma membrane provides a sufficient K+ influx for yeast growth under selective pressure.FIGURE 2Yeast complementation assay of Kcv mutants. The amino acids of the first transmembrane domain (left panel) and of the second transmembrane domain (right panel) were individually mutated to alanine. The two endogenous alanines were replaced by Gly. When the K+ uptake deficient yeast strain SGY1528 was transfected with the vector only (pYES2), it was only able to grow on medium with high (100 mm) K+. Transfection of the yeast strain with the WT Kcv channel allowed growth on selective media with low (1 mm or 0.5 mm) K+. Mutations in the transmembrane domains resulted in variable growth under selective conditions. The yeasts transfected with Kcv-WT, Kcv mutants, and with empty vector were plotted in different dilutions: 1 (undiluted), 1:10, and 1:100.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A scrutiny of the yeasts transfected with Kcv mutants shows that many mutants also grew under the selective conditions (Fig. 2). This implies that a large number of amino acid positions in the TMDs tolerate a mutation into alanine without loss of function. The data also highlight several important amino acids that are crucial for channel function in yeast. The substitutions of nearly all phenylalanines (Phe-14, Phe-24, Phe-30, and Phe-31), histidine (His-17), isoleucine (Ile-20), tyrosine (Tyr-28), and proline (Pro-32) in the first outer transmembrane (TMD1) domain showed the most dramatic effects. In these cases, the substitution results in a near or complete loss of channel function. The picture is different in the second, inner transmembrane domain (TMD2). In this domain, alanine scanning revealed that nearly all of the amino acid side chains were not essential for channel function. Only the substitution of histidine (His-83) caused a total loss of function, whereas substitution of leucine (Leu-94) leads only to a significantly reduced function of yeast growth (Fig. 2). To understand the spatial organization of the sensitive amino acids in the context of the three-dimensional structure of the channel, we localized their positions in the simulation model of Kcv (11Tayefeh S. Kloss T. Kreim M. Gebhardt M. Baumeister D. Hertel B. Richter C. Schwalbe H. Moroni A. Thiel G. Kast S.M. Biophys. J. 2009; 96: 485-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows the Kcv structure with the respective amino acids highlighted. It seems that the relevant amino acids of TMD1 nearly all present their side chains to the membrane. Fig. 1A illustrates that nearly all of the sensitive amino acids shown in Fig. 2, with the exception of Phe-31 and Ile-20, are also conserved (24Ashkenazy H. Erez E. Martz E. Pupko T. Ben-Tal N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: W529-W533Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar, 25Landau M. Mayrose I. Rosenberg Y. Glaser F. Martz E. Pupko T. Ben-Tal N.

Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 163-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar) within the sequences of all viral potassium channels. This emphasizes that the overall architecture of the channel is maintained throughout this family of channels. The conservation and orientation together with the aromatic side chain character suggests that these amino acids are involved in an anchoring of TMD1 in the lipid. An alternative explanation for the loss of function in the mutants could be the reduced hydrophobicity that is introduced with the alanine. To test the importance of a hydrophobic flavor of the critical amino acids, one of them, Phe-24, was mutated to Leu. This eliminates the aromatic side chain but preserves the hydrophobic character of this amino acid. A test of the mutant in the yeast system revealed that the substitution of Phe-24 with leucine failed to recover channel function (Fig. 3A). Hence, the hydrophobic nature of the amino acid in this position is not the only requirement. To test the alternative hypothesis, namely the importance of the aromatic side chains, the amino acids Phe-24 and Tyr-28 were replaced by tryptophan or tyrosine for position 24 or with tryptophan, histidine, or phenylalanine for position 28, respectively. The results of the yeast complementation assay in Fig. 3B imply that the presence of an aromatic side chain in these positions is indeed sufficient for channel function. All aromatic substitutions were able to rescue channel function with varying degrees. The results of these experiments stress that proper channel function requires the presence of aromatic amino acids in TMD1, which are oriented toward the membrane for anchoring of the protein in the bilayer. In further experiments we also tested the significance of another aromatic amino acid, His-17, in TMD1. In this case we replaced His-17 with a randomization approach, meaning that in principle any of the 20 possible amino acids could occur at this position. Twelve of the 60 tested yeast colonies transformed with the randomized plasmids showed growth on selective media with 0.5 mm KCl. After eliminating false positives and WT-like channels, we found that a mutant in which histidine was substituted by tryptophan was able to rescue channel function. The results of these experiments imply that the amino acid tryptophan with its aromatic side chain can replace the aromatic histidine in a functional channel. The results of these experiments are in agreement with the findings of Fig. 1B and underscore the importance of the aromatic side chains for anchoring of the protein in the membrane. Hence, the essential features of the critical amino acids are exposure and geometric orientation of the side chains toward the lipid bilayer. This kind of anchoring of transmembrane domains seems to be a general feature and has been described for several transmembrane domains (27Yau W.M. Wimley W.C. Gawrisch K. White S.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14713-14718Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 28Killian J.A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 29De Planque M.R. Killian J.A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2003; 20: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Among the critical amino acids in TMD1, Ile-20 is an exception in that it does not carry an aromatic side chain. Yeasts expressing a channel with an Ala substitution are barely growing (Fig. 2). Previous studies already revealed that this position in TMD1 influences functional properties of the Kcv channel via long-distance interactions with the pore (30Gazzarrini S. Kang M. Van Etten J.L. Tayefeh S. Kast S.M. DiFrancesco D. Thiel G. Moroni A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28443-28449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This mutant is, for example, more sensitive to cesium than the wild-type channel in voltage clamp measurements in Xenopus oocytes (30Gazzarrini S. Kang M. Van Etten J.L. Tayefeh S. Kast S.M. DiFrancesco D. Thiel G. Moroni A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28443-28449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because of this critical role of Ile-20, further mutations were made to test the influence of the position on channel function and behavior. Fig. 4 shows the complementation assay of a series of different mutants. The data support a critical role of this position in channel function in the sense that channel performance is sensitive to the amino acid flavor in this position. The Kcv-I20V mutant is, as expected from previous experiments (30Gazzarrini S. Kang M. Van Etten J.L. Tayefeh S. Kast S.M. DiFrancesco D. Thiel G. Moroni A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28443-28449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), functional. It is able to rescue yeast growth on selection media with 0.5 mm and 1 mm K+. However, the exchange with Trp or Gly modifies channel function. The substitution of Ile to Trp leads to a mutant that can still support yeast growth on 1 mm K+ selective media but not on 0.5 mm KCl. The second mutant, Kcv-I20G, completely fails to rescue yeast growth under selective conditions. An important feature that is highlighted with the help of the MD model is the interaction of the two TMDs of Kcv. Although TMD2 is very tolerant to exchanges in amino acids, the substitution of His-83 caused a total loss of function (Fig. 2). The reason for the critical role of this amino acid becomes apparent from the MD model, which shows that this residue is in close contact with another essential amino acid in the TMD1, namely Phe-30. The structure reveals that Phe-30 and His-83 are interacting via a π-stack over a distance of only 3.3–3.4 Å (Fig. 5A). Such a stack of π-electron-rich residues occurs if two or more aromatic molecules are oriented in a parallel manner over a distance of about 3.3 Å. London dispersion forces, which dominate these π···π interactions, play important roles for correct folding and stability of many proteins (31Shoemaker K.R. Fairman R. Schultz D.A. Robertson A.D. York E.J. Stewart J.M. Baldwin R.L. Biopolymers. 1990; 29: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and for mutual interactions between helices in many membrane proteins (32Popot J.L. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4031-4037Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar, 33Bowie J.U. Nature. 2005; 438: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Evidence for the contribution of these aromatic side chain interactions were already found for acid-sensing ion channels, where the π-π-stacking between the extracellular and transmembrane domain is essential for proton gating (34Li T. Yang Y. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4689-4694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 35Yang H. Yu Y. Li W.G. Yu F. Cao H. Xu T.L. Jiang H. PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e1000151Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Also, the architecture of synthetic ion channels relies on this kind of π-π-stacking interactions (36Bhosale S. Sisson A.L. Sakai N. Matile S. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2006; 4: 3031-3039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is hence possible that the aromatic-aromatic interaction between Phe-30 and His-83 is an essential factor for structure and function in the Kcv channel. The presumed interaction between Phe and His in Kcv is not a frequently occurring pairing in membrane proteins for interhelical contact points (37Adamian L. Liang J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 891-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). An alignment of viral potassium channels (Fig. 1A), however, shows that the His in TMD2 is highly conserved throughout all viral potassium channels. Even the distantly related potassium channel Kesv of the Ectocarpus siliculosus virus (EsV-1) (38Delaroque N. Müller D.G. Bothe G. Pohl T. Knippers R. Boland W. Virology. 2001; 287: 112-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) is conserved at this position. The complementary amino acid in TMD1, e.g. Phe-30 in Kcv, is only semi-conserved (Fig. 1A). In Kesv, we find a glutamine in this position, i.e. an amino acid that is uncharged and aliphatic. All other viral ion channels contain a phenylalanine or methionine in this position. In the case of methionine, it seems possible that the long and extended thiomethyl group is able to stabilize the channel structure through C-H···π interactions, where methionine is the aliphatic C-H donor and histidine is the aromatic π-acceptor (39Brandl M. Weiss M.S. Jabs A. Sühnel J. Hilgenfeld R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 357-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). To test the importance of π···π or C-H···π interactions for channel structure and function, different substitutions of positions Phe-30 and His-83 with Ala, Gly, Phe, His, Met, Trp, and Gln were made. Note that the F30Q mutant mimics the amino acid pair in the Kesv channel (Fig. 1A). Fig. 6A shows that only two of the 14 substitutions were able to rescue yeast growth on selection media. The substitutions, which generate a functional channel, agree with the idea of a π···π interaction in this site. One of the two positive substitutions of Phe-30 is tryptophan, i.e. an amino acid with an aromatic side chain. As already expected from the alignments (Fig. 1A), Phe-30 could also be replaced by methionine. C-H···π interactions, like the Met-His interaction, can contribute to the stability of proteins with the overall stabilization energy of about 0.5 to 1.0 kcal mol−1 per interaction. They are therefore an important factor for protein stability (39Brandl M. Weiss M.S. Jabs A. Sühnel J. Hilgenfeld R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 357-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Also, almost all tryptophan residues in proteins are involved in C-H···π or π···π interactions (39Brandl M. Weiss M.S. Jabs A. Sühnel J. Hilgenfeld R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 357-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 40Wang L. Sun N. Terzyan S. Zhang X. Benson D.R. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 13750-13759Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The Trp-His interaction can stabilize a structure by about 1.0 to 4 kcal mol−1 (41Fernández-Recio J. Vázquez A. Civera C. Sevilla P. Sancho J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 184-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This is in the same range as the Met-His interaction. Hence, it is quite reasonable that the substitution of either methionine or tryptophan can rescue channel function in yeast. This finding highlights the concept of a functional conservation in proteins. This means that the conservation in a protein is not on the level of the specific amino acid but rather on the maintenance of a structural interaction. In the present case, the important factor is the interaction between the two TMDs, which can be brought about either by a π···π interaction or, alternatively, also by the weaker C-H···π-interaction (42Nishio M. Hirota M. Umezawa Y. The CH/π Interaction: Evidence, Nature and Consequences. Wiley-VCH, New York1998: 175-202Google Scholar). Additional data show that three other mutations, namely F30H, F30Q, and F30G rescued yeast growth on selective media. However, in these cases, yeast growth could only be detected at high, undiluted yeast concentration on the selective plates (Fig. 6B). The data imply that these channel mutants are in principle also functional. They may provide a lower conductance for K+ uptake and hence a reduced rescue efficiency. Important to note is that the amino acids Gln and His in position 30 are potential partners for a side chain pairing with His-83 (43Bhattacharyya R. Saha R.P. Samanta U. Chakrabarti P. J. Prot. Res. 2003; 2: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 44Heyda J. Mason P.E. Jungwirth P. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2010; 114: 8744-8749Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Only the mutant F30G does not follow this pattern. Collectively, the results show that the two positions Phe-30 and His-83 are essential for proper channel function. The structural importance is given by the formation of intra-subunit interactions between the two TMDs. Furthermore, these positions are highly conserved throughout the viral K+ channels and are susceptible to changes. Moreover, the results emphasize an even higher complexity because there is no reciprocity between the two positions, as the mutual exchange of Phe and His leads to a non-functional mutant (Fig. 6A). Additionally, these results demonstrate that the MD model of Kcv (11Tayefeh S. Kloss T. Kreim M. Gebhardt M. Baumeister D. Hertel B. Richter C. Schwalbe H. Moroni A. Thiel G. Kast S.M. Biophys. J. 2009; 96: 485-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) reproduces the real conditions in the protein quite well. Delicate interactions such as the π-π-stacking would not have occurred in an inappropriate model that differs from the more realistic one, for instance by a small helix rotation. The information from the alanine scanning mutagenesis is together with the structural model of Kcv able to provide details on the three-dimensional model of the Kcv channel. More information can be gained by analyzing thermal B-factors originating from the MD simulations (11Tayefeh S. Kloss T. Kreim M. Gebhardt M. Baumeister D. Hertel B. Richter C. Schwalbe H. Moroni A. Thiel G. Kast S.M. Biophys. J. 2009; 96: 485-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) that measure the average atomic fluctuations around the equilibrium position and therefore the flexibility of each amino acid in the Kcv protein. Fig. 5B shows Cα atom B-factors that indicate a pronounced dichotomy in both TMDs. Both membrane-spanning domains exhibit a high degree of flexibility toward the cytosolic side. The upper halves, which face the extracellular side, are far less flexible. The present data imply that the more or less rigid nature of TMD1 is achieved by an anchoring of this part of the protein in the membrane. Most of the aforementioned critical aromatic amino acids that face the membrane are located in this rigid part of TMD1 (Fig. 5B). TMD2 on the other hand does not have such a direct anchor in the membrane. The rigid character of the upper part of TMD2 can therefore be best explained by the contact between the two TMDs via the π···π interactions between Phe-30 and His-83. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the mobility of TMD2 indeed increases downstream of His-83, e.g. the point at which the two transmembrane domains are in intimate contact (Fig. 5B). The fact that any disturbance of the architecture that affects the rigidity of the TMDs results in a loss of channel function implies a certain importance for channel function. It is reasonable to speculate that the maintenance of the rigid nature of the TMDs in this part of the protein is connected to the function of the selectivity filter. The delicate structure of the selectivity filter, which has to maintain its structure to select between cations, probably requires this suspension by the two TMDs. The relevance of the π···π-interactions between the two TMDs for channel structure and stability is further supported by an application of the theory of anisotropic network models to the Kcv model (11Tayefeh S. Kloss T. Kreim M. Gebhardt M. Baumeister D. Hertel B. Richter C. Schwalbe H. Moroni A. Thiel G. Kast S.M. Biophys. J. 2009; 96: 485-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). By using a homogeneous parameterization of the network model, we performed a purely structural-topological sensitivity analysis of the channel: we artificially deleted the mutual contact of amino acids 30–83 within each subunit at the same time. This mutation has no experimental analog and can therefore be performed in silico only. To assess the effect of this deletion on the mechanics of the potassium channel, we computed the difference between the wild-type and mutant covariance matrix using the Frobenius norm. The covariance matrix contains information on correlated motions of all the residues in the tetramer. To avoid obscuration effects that may emerge by summing up the absolute differences of the whole matrix, we defined distinct channel elements and thus, by extension, different subparts of the above-mentioned covariance matrix, which describe local mechanics for relevant parts of the channel (11Tayefeh S. Kloss T. Kreim M. Gebhardt M. Baumeister D. Hertel B. Richter C. Schwalbe H. Moroni A. Thiel G. Kast S.M. Biophys. J. 2009; 96: 485-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The Frobenius norm of a mutant with respect to the wild type increases whenever a mutation has a significant impact on the mechanics of the region under consideration. We detected here a major influence of the contact deletion on both TMDs and the turret region (data not shown). Another measure of the biomechanical effect that is invariant under rotation is the overlap distance. It is derived for all mechanical modes of the channel. The similarity of corresponding eigenvectors denoting distinct fluctuations of each residue of the wild-type and mutant system can be quantified by the angle between the vectors. We defined the overlap distance dij as dij = 1-cos(αij), with αij being the angle between each of the two eigenvectors (i in the wild type and j in the mutant). A pairing with similar fluctuation vectors shows a distance close to zero, whereas a distance close to 1 indicates large differences between the eigenvectors. In the present case, we identified corresponding modes from the wild type and mutant by using the frequencies of the mechanical motions. The final results for mechano-dynamical similarity of modes of motions upon mutation of the 30–83 contacts are depicted in Fig. 7. Clearly, large deviations (dij) between wild type and mutant eigenvectors are present for large indices only. Small indices denote small frequencies and represent functional motions of the channel. Such global mechanics are mainly because of function, whereas high-frequency motions, which are populated with only a small probability, describe localized motions having effects mainly on the structure and stability of the protein (45Bahar I. Atilgan A.R. Demirel M.C. Erman B. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1998; 80: 2733-2736Crossref Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The data show that the contact between residues 30 and 83 has a major impact on local dynamics as expressed by high-frequency modes and, hence, influences the structure rather than the functionality of the Kcv channel. The present data support a model for the functional architecture of the small viral K+ channels in which the upper part of the outer transmembrane domain must be anchored via aromatic side chains with the surrounding membrane. Such an anchoring is typical for many membrane proteins (27Yau W.M. Wimley W.C. Gawrisch K. White S.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14713-14718Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 28Killian J.A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 29De Planque M.R. Killian J.A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2003; 20: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Mutual interaction of an amino acid pair attaches the inner TMD of the channels to the outer TMD and immobilizes in this way also the upper part of the former TMD. An elastic network model of the Kcv channel underscores the structural significance of this amino acid pairing and reveals that its disruption results in modified protein stability. The experimental data further imply that the respective interaction between the two TMDs supports optimal function of the channel, although it does not seem to be essential. Loss of channel function was induced by the disruption of the pair-wise interaction in most of the mutants that were tested in the rescue assay. The fact that mutants that maintained the stronger π···π interaction or the weaker C-H···π interaction between the TMDs still support proper rescue efficiency implies that the amino acid pairing motive that connects the two TMDs is beneficial for channel function. Interesting to note is that the F30Q mutant, which mimics the amino acid sequence of the Kesv channel, is able to rescue, albeit with a low efficiency, growth of yeast mutants. This observation implies that a general motive of interactions between the two transmembrane domains is indeed conserved within the small viral K+ channels. One mutant, F30G, in which Gly-30 does not interact with His-83, is also able to rescue yeast growth with a low efficiency. The results of these experiments suggest that a close interaction between positions 30 and 83 is not obligatory for basic channel function. The structural connection between the two TMDs may, in the case of the F30G mutant with the small and flexible Gly, be taken over by other interactions between the TMDs, e.g. between Phe-31 and His-83. The overall architecture and dynamics we find here for the TMDs in Kcvs is not restricted to the small viral K+ channel. The same bipartite organization of the two TMDs, which is characteristic for Kcvs (Fig. 5B), is also present in the Kir2.2 channel. In the latter channel (4Tao X. Avalos J.L. Chen J. MacKinnon R. Science. 2009; 326: 1668-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), the B-factors imply that those parts of the TMDs that face the external medium are fairly rigid (Fig. 5C). Like in Kcv, the parts of the Kir2.2 TMDs, which are directed toward the cytosol, are more flexible (compare Fig. 5, B and C). A scrutiny of its crystal structure shows that the amino acid pair Phe-97 and Gln-165 can in Kir2.2 generate the contact between the two TMDs and hence a mutual fixation of the two helices in Kir2.2. The XH··π interaction between the two amino acids over a distance of 3 Å is in the same range as the π-stacking interaction in Kcv. Moreover, the two critical amino acids of Kir2.2 are located as in Kcv in the rigid parts of the TMDs at the transition to the flexible parts (Fig. 5C). The mutual interaction between the two amino acids together with their location is consistent with the idea that they generate a close contact between the two transmembrane domains in Kir2.2. The finding of a similar architectural principle in the Kcv and Kir channels implies that the interhelical contact between the two TMDs and the rigid character of the outer part of the TMDs are important features for channel function.

https://openalex.org/W2163538040,"Background Human societies exhibit a rich array of gestures with cultural origins. Often these gestures are found exclusively in local populations, where their meaning has been crafted by a community into a shared convention. In nonhuman primates like African monkeys, little evidence exists for such culturally-conventionalized gestures. Methodology/Principal Findings Here I report a striking gesture unique to a single community of mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx) among nineteen studied across North America, Africa, and Europe. The gesture was found within a community of 23 mandrills where individuals old and young, female and male covered their eyes with their hands for periods which could exceed 30 min, often while simultaneously raising their elbow prominently into the air. This ‘Eye covering’ gesture has been performed within the community for a decade, enduring deaths, removals, and births, and it persists into the present. Differential responses to Eye covering versus controls suggested that the gesture might have a locally-respected meaning, potentially functioning over a distance to inhibit interruptions as a ‘do not disturb’ sign operates. Conclusions/Significance The creation of this gesture by monkeys suggests that the ability to cultivate shared meanings using novel manual acts may be distributed more broadly beyond the human species. Although logistically difficult with primates, the translocation of gesturers between communities remains critical to experimentally establishing the possible cultural origin and transmission of nonhuman gestures."

Thanks to immense technological improvements in the 10 years since the draft of the first human reference genome was published, we are now seeing the dawning of the personal genomics era. Breakthroughs in medical genomics and genomics-guided medicine allow ever deeper interpretation and application of the information contained in a personal genome. The accumulation of individual genomes with clearly documented phenotypes that are available for research significantly facilitates such breakthroughs and discoveries. This virtuous circle is likely to spin faster in the coming years.

Although the benefits of a personal genome for the owner are clear, profiling everyone's DNA is mutually beneficial, acting with a strong network effect. Human populations are largely phylogenetically related as a result of recent population explosion. Considering that any two of us have common ancestry back to a certain point, people nearly always share a significant fraction of genetic variation sites and allele types. Therefore, the health profile and personal genetic information of one individual will, to a certain extent, provide clues to better understand other's genomes and their medical implications. In this sense, a personal genome is not only for one, but also for all humanity.

https://openalex.org/W1975874873,"When the announcement was made that teams led by Francis Collins and J. Craig Venter had jointly produced a rough map of the human genome, I was way in the back of a room crowded with a starry-eyed horde of media, NIH officials, representatives from the White House, and a variety of university and corporate scientists. I am fairly certain I was the only person at that press conference from the field of ethics. In the decade since the human genome map was published, efforts to apply that knowledge to human health have greatly and appropriately increased the presence of ethics in the world of human genomics.

Most thought that the ability to predict an individual's risk of developing diseases would drive the use of genomic information. That did not turn out to be so.

Efforts to move personalized risk-testing to the Internet and into pharmacies did quickly follow the publication of the map and the creation of better array-based technology. A variety of companies jumped on the “spitomics” bandwagon—encouraging individuals to spit in a cup in order to find out whether they were at risk for cancer, diabetes, and drug dependency; to gain insight into the identity of their forebears; or to find out if their kids were likely to have food allergies or become star athletes.

These activities met with little enthusiasm. The lack of standards about the accuracy and sensitivity of claims about genetic tests, the absence of serious efforts to ensure competent counseling, and indifference to simply having information about risk slowed the growth of interest in personal risk assessment.

Fear of repercussions has been an obstacle as well. Only in the past few years, with the enactment of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act last year, has the requisite ethical and legal infrastructure for personal genetic risk analysis been created.

It is not the analysis of risk factors that shows the most immediate promise for human genomics but the application of genetic information to permit the safer and more efficacious use of drugs. Pharmacogenomics is poised to capture the promise of the discovery and publication of our genome. Cure, not diagnosis, is the value driving human genetics and is likely to do so into the future."

DNA variations and their interaction with diverse environmental pressures are how nature's fundamental forces shape nearly every facet of life. The first human genome sequence, published in 2001, provided a canonical reference from which to understand genome structure, as well as a registry of functional units. Before 2001, only a handful of examples of genetic risk factors existed for common human diseases. At present, thousands of genes that influence susceptibility to hundreds of disease-associated phenotypes have been identified. Today, with advanced, low-cost technologies, we have embarked on the characterization of genomic variation and associated gene networks. However, our understanding of complex phenotypes is far from complete. Knowledge of the human genome has led to a wave of discoveries (e.g., transgenerational epigenetic inheritance) that have shaken some of the foundations upon which biology is built. We have learned that the human genome is much more dynamic than previously thought. Elucidating its complexity will require a more systems-level approach, including comprehensive integration with other data dimensions, such as RNA, metabolite, protein, and clinical data. For me, although this past decade has exposed many amazing aspects of the genome, it has revealed the existence of a world about which we know very little. We will have to become masters of information if we ever hope to go from the big data sets coming to dominate biology to knowledge and to understanding.

In the pregenomic era, evolutionary genetics was a painstaking process. From observations of the natural world, scientists hypothesized instances of selection and sought confirmation on a case-by-case basis. As of 2000, only a handful of such cases had been identified. Technological and analytical advances in the past decade, however, have enabled us to progress from hypothesis-testing to hypothesis-generating science. Rather than examining single-candidate genes, we can scan the entire genome to identify variants under natural selection. In the initial phase of the postgenomic era, we have confirmed earlier hypotheses of evolution for malaria resistance, skin pigmentation, and lactose tolerance, and we have identified new adaptations for the formation of hair, resistance to trypanasomes, and response to high altitude. The challenge now is to uncover how hundreds of newly discovered candidate loci have shaped our evolution. In my laboratory's own recent scans, we identified more than 200 loci with strong evidence of selection. Of these, roughly half point to genes, and the other half point to large, intervening, noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs), other regulatory elements, and many yet-unknown regions. It is intriguing that whole new adaptive pathways are coming into view, such as those regulating sensory perception and thermoregulation in Asia, and metabolism and infectious disease in all populations. In the next decade, scientists can look forward to investigating these pathways and many other new hypotheses being generated through genome scans to uncover the vast landscape of human evolution.
