https://openalex.org/W2794844698,"The endogenous metabolite itaconate has recently emerged as a regulator of macrophage function, but its precise mechanism of action remains poorly understood. Here we show that itaconate is required for the activation of the anti-inflammatory transcription factor Nrf2 (also known as NFE2L2) by lipopolysaccharide in mouse and human macrophages. We find that itaconate directly modifies proteins via alkylation of cysteine residues. Itaconate alkylates cysteine residues 151, 257, 288, 273 and 297 on the protein KEAP1, enabling Nrf2 to increase the expression of downstream genes with anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory capacities. The activation of Nrf2 is required for the anti-inflammatory action of itaconate. We describe the use of a new cell-permeable itaconate derivative, 4-octyl itaconate, which is protective against lipopolysaccharide-induced lethality in vivo and decreases cytokine production. We show that type I interferons boost the expression of Irg1 (also known as Acod1) and itaconate production. Furthermore, we find that itaconate production limits the type I interferon response, indicating a negative feedback loop that involves interferons and itaconate. Our findings demonstrate that itaconate is a crucial anti-inflammatory metabolite that acts via Nrf2 to limit inflammation and modulate type I interferons."

Leeman et al. isolated quiescent and activated stem cells from mice and compared their transcriptomes. The findings emphasize the role of large lysosomes in quiescent neuronal stem cells in which aggregated proteins accumulate. Treatments that stimulated lysosomal function allowed aged quiescent stem cells to clear protein aggregates and restored the cells' ability to be activated. Such restoration of stem cell function might alleviate compromised proteostasis in aging. Science , this issue p. 1277"

https://openalex.org/W2795324556,"A challenge in the treatment of Staphylococcus aureus infections is the high prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains and the formation of non-growing, dormant 'persister' subpopulations that exhibit high levels of tolerance to antibiotics and have a role in chronic or recurrent infections. As conventional antibiotics are not effective in the treatment of infections caused by such bacteria, novel antibacterial therapeutics are urgently required. Here we used a Caenorhabditis elegans-MRSA infection screen to identify two synthetic retinoids, CD437 and CD1530, which kill both growing and persister MRSA cells by disrupting lipid bilayers. CD437 and CD1530 exhibit high killing rates, synergism with gentamicin, and a low probability of resistance selection. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the ability of retinoids to penetrate and embed in lipid bilayers correlates with their bactericidal ability. An analogue of CD437 was found to retain anti-persister activity and show an improved cytotoxicity profile. Both CD437 and this analogue, alone or in combination with gentamicin, exhibit considerable efficacy in a mouse model of chronic MRSA infection. With further development and optimization, synthetic retinoids have the potential to become a new class of antimicrobials for the treatment of Gram-positive bacterial infections that are currently difficult to cure."
https://openalex.org/W2794495549,"Neocortical areas communicate through extensive axonal projections, but the logic of information transfer remains poorly understood, because the projections of individual neurons have not been systematically characterized. It is not known whether individual neurons send projections only to single cortical areas or distribute signals across multiple targets. Here we determine the projection patterns of 591 individual neurons in the mouse primary visual cortex using whole-brain fluorescence-based axonal tracing and high-throughput DNA sequencing of genetically barcoded neurons (MAPseq). Projections were highly diverse and divergent, collectively targeting at least 18 cortical and subcortical areas. Most neurons targeted multiple cortical areas, often in non-random combinations, suggesting that sub-classes of intracortical projection neurons exist. Our results indicate that the dominant mode of intracortical information transfer is not based on 'one neuron-one target area' mapping. Instead, signals carried by individual cortical neurons are shared across subsets of target areas, and thus concurrently contribute to multiple functional pathways."

Panganiban et al. designed random copolymers with polar and nonpolar groups, using many of the features found in proteins (see the Perspective by Alexander-Katz and Van Lehn). Their structures could serve as “broad spectrum” surfactants, able to promote the solubilization of proteins in organic solvents and help preserve the functionality of proteins in aqueous environments.

https://openalex.org/W2790348370,"Sexual development in Plasmodium Malaria-causing parasites ( Plasmodium ) have complex life histories in the tissues of humans. For the most part, the parasites focus their efforts on replication within the human host cells. However, occasionally, some replicating cells release gametes into the bloodstream, which are picked up by biting mosquitoes. Filarsky et al. discovered that the Plasmodium parasite keeps the production of gametes under tight epigenetic control using heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). Plasmodium gametocytogenesis is initiated when HP1 is evicted from upstream of gamete-specific genes by gametocyte development 1 (GDV1) protein. GDV1 is in turn regulated by its antisense RNA. What triggers GDV1 expression remains unclear. Elucidating this pathway could provide a target for interrupting malaria transmission. Science , this issue p. 1259"

In these cases, two non- or low-functioning genes contribute to disease. However, Mendelian effects of lesser strength have generally been ignored when looking at genomic consequences in human health. Bastarache et al. used electronic records to identify the phenotypic effects of previously unidentified Mendelian variations. Their analysis suggests that individuals with undiagnosed Mendelian diseases may be more prevalent in the general population than assumed. Because of this, genetic analysis may be able to assist clinicians in arriving at a diagnosis. Science , this issue p. 1233"

https://openalex.org/W2794845581,"Nutrients, such as amino acids and glucose, signal through the Rag GTPases to activate mTORC1. The GATOR1 protein complex—comprising DEPDC5, NPRL2 and NPRL3—regulates the Rag GTPases as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for RAGA; loss of GATOR1 desensitizes mTORC1 signalling to nutrient starvation. GATOR1 components have no sequence homology to other proteins, so the function of GATOR1 at the molecular level is currently unknown. Here we used cryo-electron microscopy to solve structures of GATOR1 and GATOR1–Rag GTPases complexes. GATOR1 adopts an extended architecture with a cavity in the middle; NPRL2 links DEPDC5 and NPRL3, and DEPDC5 contacts the Rag GTPase heterodimer. Biochemical analyses reveal that our GATOR1–Rag GTPases structure is inhibitory, and that at least two binding modes must exist between the Rag GTPases and GATOR1. Direct interaction of DEPDC5 with RAGA inhibits GATOR1-mediated stimulation of GTP hydrolysis by RAGA, whereas weaker interactions between the NPRL2–NPRL3 heterodimer and RAGA execute GAP activity. These data reveal the structure of a component of the nutrient-sensing mTORC1 pathway and a non-canonical interaction between a GAP and its substrate GTPase. Cryo-electron microscopy and biochemical analyses of the GATOR1 protein complex reveal that two binding modes underpin its ability to regulate Rag GTPases as a GTPase-activating protein for RAGA. mTORC1 is a master growth regulator that senses nutrient signals such as amino acids and glucose to coordinate many cellular processes. mTORC1 is regulated by the Rag GTPases, which are in turn regulated by several protein complexes including GATOR1, which serves as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for RAGA. Here, David Sabatini and colleagues use cryo-electron microscropy to determine the structures of GATOR1 and of GATOR1 bound to the Rag GTPases, and perform biochemical experiments to investigate GAP function. They find that GATOR1 adopts an extended architecture with the NPRL2 subunit linking the two other subunits DEPDC5 and NPRL3. Unexpectedly, the GATOR1–Rag GTPases structure represents an inhibitory state, where an interaction of DEPDC5 with RAGA inhibits GATOR1 GAP activity. Instead, a weaker interaction of the NPRL2–NPRL3 heterodimer with RAGA executes GAP function. Such an inhibitory mechanism has not been seen before for other GAPs."

https://openalex.org/W2795292973,"The shape, elongation, division and sporulation (SEDS) proteins are a large family of ubiquitous and essential transmembrane enzymes with critical roles in bacterial cell wall biology. The exact function of SEDS proteins was for a long time poorly understood, but recent work has revealed that the prototypical SEDS family member RodA is a peptidoglycan polymerase-a role previously attributed exclusively to members of the penicillin-binding protein family. This discovery has made RodA and other SEDS proteins promising targets for the development of next-generation antibiotics. However, little is known regarding the molecular basis of SEDS activity, and no structural data are available for RodA or any homologue thereof. Here we report the crystal structure of Thermus thermophilus RodA at a resolution of 2.9 Å, determined using evolutionary covariance-based fold prediction to enable molecular replacement. The structure reveals a ten-pass transmembrane fold with large extracellular loops, one of which is partially disordered. The protein contains a highly conserved cavity in the transmembrane domain, reminiscent of ligand-binding sites in transmembrane receptors. Mutagenesis experiments in Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli show that perturbation of this cavity abolishes RodA function both in vitro and in vivo, indicating that this cavity is catalytically essential. These results provide a framework for understanding bacterial cell wall synthesis and SEDS protein function."

Although stream chemistry and biology have been considered the dominant controls on how quickly DIN is removed, Grant et al. show that physics is what sets the limits on removal rates of nitrate (a component of DIN). Residence time in the hyporheic zone (the region below the sediment surface where groundwater and surface water mix) determines the maximum rate at which nitrate can be removed from stream water. Nevertheless, at local scales, chemistry and biology modify how closely to that maximum rate removal occurs. Science , this issue p. 1266"

Twenty-seven young team sports male players performed a 4 sets of 7 repetitions of inertial eccentric overload training, biweekly for 6 weeks, distributed in unilateral lunge group (UG: age: 22.8 ± 2.9 years; body mass: 75.3 ± 8.8 kg; height: 177.3 ± 3.7 cm) and bilateral squat group (BG: age: 22.6 ± 2.7 years; body mass: 79.5 ± 12.8 kg; height: 164.2 ± 7 cm). Lower limb muscle volume, counter movement jump (CMJ), power with both (POWER), dominant (POWERd) and no-dominant leg (POWERnd), change of direction turn of 90° with dominant (COD90d) and no-dominant leg (COD90nd) and 180° (COD180d and COD180nd), and 10m sprint time (T-10m) were measured pre and post-intervention. The UG obtained an increase of adductor major (+11.1%) and vastus medialis (+12.6%) higher than BG. The BG obtained an increase of vastus lateralis (+9.9%) and lateral gastrocnemius (+9.1%) higher than UG. Both groups improved CMJ, POWER, POWERd, POWERnd, COD90 and DEC-COD90, without changes in T-10m. The UG decrease DEC-COD90nd (-21.1%) and BG increase POWER (+38.6%) substantially more than the other group. Six-weeks of unilateral / bilateral EO training induce substantial improvements in lower limbs muscle volume and functional performance, although unilateral training seems to be more effective in improving COD90 performance."

https://openalex.org/W2795005430,"Increasing evidence indicates that obesity is highly associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist has shown benefits on kidney diseases, but its direct role on kidney metabolism in obesity is still not clear. This study aims to investigate the protection and metabolic modulation role of liraglutide (Lira) on kidney of obesity. Rats were induced obese by high-fat diet (HFD), and renal function and metabolism changes were evaluated by metabolomic, biological and histological methods. HFD rats exhibited systemic metabolic disorders such as obesity, hyperlipidemia and impaired glucose tolerance, as well as renal histological and function damages, while Lira significantly ameliorated these adverse effects in HFD rats. Metabolomic data showed that Lira directly reduced renal lipids including fatty acid residues, cholesterol, phospholipids and triglycerides, and improved mitochondria metabolites such as succinate, citrate, taurine, fumarate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) in the kidney of HFD rats. Furthermore, we revealed that Lira inhibited renal lipid accumulation by coordinating lipogenic and lipolytic signals, and partly rescued renal mitochondria function via Sirt1/AMPK/PGC1α pathways in HFD rats. This study suggested that Lira alleviated HFD-induced kidney injury at least partly via directly restoring renal metabolism, thus GLP-1R agonist is a promising therapy for obesity-associated CKD."

Dong et al. used rapid freeze-quench methods to trap two intermediates formed by a noncanonical radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzyme: a fragmented SAM molecule bound to the iron-sulfur cluster through an iron-carbon bond and a product-like radical. The structure of the SAM-bound enzyme reveals a noncolinear arrangement of carbon, sulfur, and iron atoms. The arrangement of bonds suggests that the organometallic intermediate may be created through a two-electron nucleophilic mechanism. A subsequent radical intermediate is formed on the protein substrate and resolves by oxidation to form the amino acid product diphthamide. Science , this issue p. 1247"

https://openalex.org/W2794523607,"Background Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension who achieve a six-minute walk distance of 380–440 m may have improved prognosis. Using the randomized controlled trial of macitentan in pulmonary arterial hypertension (SERAPHIN), the association between six-minute walk distance and long-term outcomes was explored. Methods Patients with six-minute walk distance data at Month 6 were dichotomized as above or below the median six-minute walk distance (400 m) and assessed for future risk of pulmonary arterial hypertension-related death or hospitalization and all-cause death. Additionally, six-minute walk distance values at baseline, Month 6 and the change from baseline to Month 6 were categorized by quartiles. All associations were analyzed by the Kaplan–Meier method using a log-rank test and Cox regression models. Results Patients with a six-minute walk distance >400 m vs. ≤400 m at Month 6 have a reduced risk of pulmonary arterial hypertension-related death or hospitalization (hazard ratio 0.48; 95% confidence interval 0.33–0.69). The risk was also lower for patients with higher quartiles of six-minute walk distance at baseline or Month 6 (baseline: hazard ratio [Q4 (>430 m) vs. Q1 (≤300 m)] 0.23; 95% confidence interval 0.15–0.36; Month 6: hazard ratio [Q4 (>455 m) vs. Q1 (≤348 m)] 0.33; 95% confidence interval 0.19–0.55). In contrast, six-minute walk distance changes at Month 6 were not associated with the risk of pulmonary arterial hypertension-related death or hospitalization (p = 0.477). These findings were consistent when adjusted for known confounders. Similar results were observed for the risk of all-cause death up to end of study. Conclusions Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension walking >400 m had better long-term prognosis. Although changes in six-minute walk distance were not associated with long-term outcomes, assessing absolute six-minute walk distance values remains important in the clinical management of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension."

We ask whether such reductions would also be sufficient to protect non-target species threatened as bycatch. We compare changes in fishing pressure needed to maximize profits from 4713 target fish stocks-accounting for >75% of global catch-to changes in fishing pressure needed to reverse ongoing declines of 20 marine mammal, sea turtle, and seabird populations threatened as bycatch. We project that maximizing fishery profits would halt or reverse declines of approximately half of these threatened populations. Recovering the other populations would require substantially greater effort reductions or targeting improvements. Improving commercial fishery management could thus yield important collateral benefits for threatened bycatch species globally."
https://openalex.org/W2794960162,"Background and aims Species’ habitat affinities along environmental gradients should be determined by a combination of physiological (hard) and morpho-anatomical (soft) traits. Using a gradient of soil water availability, we address three questions: How well can we predict habitat affinities from hard traits, from soft traits, and from a combination of the two? How well can we predict species' physiological responses to drought (hard traits) from their soft traits? Can we model a causal sequence as soft traits → hard traits → species distributions? Methods We chose 25 species of herbaceous dicots whose affinities for soil moisture have already been linked to 5 physiological traits (stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis measured at soil field capacity, water use efficiency, stomatal conductance and soil water potential measured when leaves begin to wilt). Under controlled conditions in soils at field capacity, we measured five soft traits (leaf dry matter content, specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen content, stomatal area, specific root length). Key results Soft traits alone were poor predictors (R2 = 0.129) while hard traits explained 48% of species habitat affinities. Moreover, hard traits were significantly related to combinations of soft traits. From a priori biological knowledge and hypothesized ecological links we built a path model showing a sequential pattern soft traits → hard traits → species distributions and accounting for 59.6% (p = 0.782) of habitat wetness. Conclusions Both direct and indirect causal relationships existed between soft traits, hard traits and species’ habitat preferences. The poor predictive abilities of soft traits alone were due to the existence of antagonistic and synergistic direct and indirect effects of soft traits on habitat preferences mediated by the hard traits. To obtain a more realistic model applicable to a population level, it has to be tested in an experiment including species competition for water supply."
https://openalex.org/W2794851013,"Osthole is an active compound isolated from Chinese herb Cnidium monnieri (L.) Cusson, and had been reported to possess antitumor effect. However, the effect of osthole on the gastric cancer cells has not been investigated. In this study, the effects of osthole on the proliferation of human gastric cancer cells were tested. The data showed that osthole treatment significantly inhibited the proliferation of gastric cancer cells and resulted in the cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase in a dose-dependent manner. Western-blot study showed that the expression of cyclin B1 and cdc2 was markedly reduced by osthole. Moreover, expression of PI3K and pAKT was also significantly suppressed, and the results indicated that the inhibition of pAKT, cyclin B1, and cdc2 levels by osthole was notably enhanced by a PI3K inhibitor. These results demonstrate that osthole could inhibit gastric cancer cells proliferation via induction of cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase by the reduction of PI3K/AKT."
https://openalex.org/W2794570415,"Upon a first encounter, individuals spontaneously associate faces with certain personality dimensions. Such first impressions can strongly impact judgments and decisions and may prove highly consequential. Researchers investigating the impact of facial information often rely on (a) real photographs that have been selected to vary on the dimension of interest, (b) morphed photographs, or (c) computer-generated faces (avatars). All three approaches have distinct advantages. Here we present the Basel Face Database, which combines these advantages. In particular, the Basel Face Database consists of real photographs that are subtly, but systematically manipulated to show variations in the perception of the Big Two and the Big Five personality dimensions. To this end, the information specific to each psychological dimension is isolated and modeled in new photographs. Two studies serve as systematic validation of the Basel Face Database. The Basel Face Database opens a new pathway for researchers across psychological disciplines to investigate effects of perceived personality."
https://openalex.org/W2795218504,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening condition for which there are currently no medical therapies other than supportive care involving the application of mechanical ventilation. However, mechanical ventilation itself can worsen ARDS by damaging the alveolocapillary barrier in the lungs. This allows plasma-derived fluid and proteins to leak into the airspaces of the lung where they interfere with the functioning of pulmonary surfactant, which increases the stresses of mechanical ventilation and worsens lung injury. Once such ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) is underway, managing ARDS and saving the patient becomes increasingly problematic. Maintaining an intact alveolar barrier thus represents a crucial management goal, but the biophysical processes that perforate this barrier remain incompletely understood. To study the dynamics of barrier perforation, we subjected initially normal mice to an injurious ventilation regimen that imposed both volutrauma (overdistension injury) and atelectrauma (injury from repetitive reopening of closed airspaces) on the lung, and observed the rate at which macromolecules of various sizes leaked into the airspaces as a function of the degree of overall injury. Computational modeling applied to our findings suggests that perforations in the alveolocapillary barrier appear and progress according to a rich-get-richer mechanism in which the likelihood of a perforation getting larger increases with the size of the perforation. We suggest that atelectrauma causes the perforations after which volutrauma expands them. This mechanism explains why atelectrauma appears to be essential to the initiation of VILI in a normal lung, and why atelectrauma and volutrauma then act synergistically once VILI is underway."
https://openalex.org/W2794471229,"Obesity in women of reproductive age has deleterious effects on reproductive and offspring health. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the association between the magnitude of periconceptional body-mass index (BMI) change and maternal and neonatal outcomes in obese infertile women who participated in the LIFEstyle study. The LIFEstyle study was a randomized controlled trial, evaluating if a six-month lifestyle intervention program prior to infertility treatment in obese infertile women improved birth rates, compared to prompt infertility treatment.This is an exploratory post hoc analysis of the LIFEstyle study. We recorded periconceptional BMI change in women with an ongoing pregnancy, pooling data of all women, regardless of randomization arm. Periconceptional BMI change was calculated using weight at randomization and the periconceptional weight (measured in kilograms 12 weeks before or after conception and expressed as BMI change in units BMI (kg/m2)). Subsequently, women were categorized into quartiles according to the magnitude of their periconceptional change in BMI. The odds of maternal and neonatal outcomes were calculated using logistic regression analysis, comparing women in each of the first three weight change quartiles separately, and combined, to women in the fourth quartile. The fourth quartile was chosen as reference group, since these women had the least weight loss. We adjusted for periconceptional BMI, nulliparity and smoking status. In addition, we performed a subgroup analysis for singleton pregnancies. In the LIFEstyle study, 321 obese infertile women achieved an ongoing pregnancy which was conceived within 24 months after randomization. Periconceptional BMI change was available in 244 of these women (76%). Median BMI at randomization was 35.9 kg/m2. Women in the first quartile (Q1) had a periconceptional BMI change of <-2.1 kg/m2, women in the second quartile (Q2) -2.1 to -0.9 kg/m2, women in the third quartile (Q3) -0.9 to 0.1 kg/m2 and women in the fourth quartile (Q4) gained ≥0.1 kg/m2. There were no significant differences between women in the quartiles regarding rates of excessive gestational weight gain (in term pregnancies), gestational diabetes, preterm birth, induction of labor, spontaneous vaginal birth and Caesarean section. Compared to women in Q4, the adjusted odds ratios, aOR, and 95% confidence interval for a hypertensive complication were; 0.55 (0.22-1.42) for women in Q1, 0.30 (0.12-0.78) for women in Q2, 0.39 (0.16-0.96) for women in Q3 and 0.39 (0.19-0.82) for women in Q1 to Q3 combined. In the subgroup analysis, investigating singleton pregnancies only, the statistically significant decreased rate of a hypertensive complication remained in women in Q2 (aOR 0.27, 95% CI 0.10-0.72) and Q3 (aOR 0.39, 95%CI 0.16-0.98) and when comparing women in Q1 to Q3 together to women in Q4 (aOR 0.38, 95%CI 0.18-0.80). Furthermore, there was a significantly decreased aOR (95%CI) of preterm birth in women in Q2 (0.24, 0.06-0.98) and when combining women in Q1 to Q3 (0.37, 0.14-0.97) compared to women in Q4.These results suggest that a periconceptional decrease in BMI in obese infertile women could lead to a decrease of the rates of hypertensive pregnancy complications and preterm birth. The results are limited by the exploratory nature of the analyses and further evidence is necessary to provide more definitive conclusions."

The roles of NF90 and NF110 in regulating transcription as chromatin-interacting proteins have not been comprehensively characterized. Here, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) identified 9,081 genomic sites specifically occupied by NF90/NF110 in K562 cells. One third of NF90/NF110 peaks occurred at promoters of annotated genes. NF90/NF110 occupancy colocalized with chromatin marks associated with active promoters and strong enhancers. Comparison with 150 ENCODE ChIP-seq experiments revealed that NF90/NF110 clustered with transcription factors exhibiting preference for promoters over enhancers (POLR2A, MYC, YY1). Differential gene expression analysis following shRNA knockdown of NF90/NF110 in K562 cells revealed that NF90/NF110 activates transcription factors that drive growth and proliferation (EGR1, MYC), while attenuating differentiation along the erythroid lineage (KLF1). NF90/NF110 associates with chromatin to hierarchically regulate transcription factors that promote proliferation and suppress differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2795247901,"The distance individuals maintain between themselves and others can be defined as 'interpersonal space'. This distance can be modulated both by situational factors and individual characteristics. Here we investigated the influence that the interpretation of other people interaction, in which one is not directly involved, may have on a person's interpersonal space. In the current study we measured, for the first time, whether the size of interpersonal space changes after listening to other people conversations with neutral or aggressive content. The results showed that the interpersonal space expands after listening to a conversation with aggressive content relative to a conversation with a neutral content. This finding suggests that participants tend to distance themselves from an aggressive confrontation even if they are not involved in it. These results are in line with the view of the interpersonal space as a safety zone surrounding one's body."
https://openalex.org/W2795223799,"In the present study, we examined the effects of different drying conditions on the composition, structure and function of benthic invertebrate assemblages. We approached this objective by comparing invertebrate assemblages in perennial and intermittent sites along two intermittent Mediterranean streams with contrasting predictability, duration, and spatial patterns of drying: Fuirosos (high predictability, short duration, downstream drying pattern) and Rogativa (low predictability, long duration, patchy drying pattern). Specifically, we quantified the contribution of individual taxa to those differences, the degree of nestedness, and shifts in the composition, structure and function of benthic invertebrate assemblages along flow intermittence gradients. We observed greater effects of drying on the benthic invertebrate composition in Fuirosos than in Rogativa, resulting in a higher dissimilarity of assemblages between perennial and intermittent sites, as well as a lower degree of nestedness. Furthermore, a higher number of biotic metrics related to richness, abundance and biological traits were significantly different between perennial and intermittent sites in Fuirosos, despite a shorter dry period compared to Rogativa. At the same time, slightly different responses were detected during post-drying (autumn) than pre-drying (spring) conditions in this stream. In Rogativa, shifts in benthic invertebrate assemblages along increasing gradients of flow intermittence were found for three metrics (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) and Odonata, Coleoptera and Heteroptera (OCH) abundances and aerial active dispersal. Furthermore, we demonstrated that combined gradients of dry period duration and distance to nearest perennial reach can generate complex, and different, responses of benthic invertebrate assemblages, depending on the flow intermittence metric. Our study advances the notion that special attention should be paid to the predictability, duration and spatial patterns of drying in intermittent streams in order to disentangle the effects of drying on benthic invertebrate assemblages, in particular in areas subject to high spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability in drying conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2794466962,"Background Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) results from a lack of nutrients transferred to the developing fetus, particularly oxygen and glucose. Increased expression of the cytoprotective mitochondrial peptide, humanin (HN), and the glucose transporter 8, GLUT8, has been reported under conditions of hypoxic stress. However, the presence and cellular localization of HN and GLUT8 in IUGR-related placental pathology remain unexplored. Thus, we undertook this study to investigate placental expression of HN and GLUT8 in IUGR-affected versus normal pregnancies. Results We found 1) increased HN expression in human IUGR-affected pregnancies on the maternal aspect of the placenta (extravillous trophoblastic (EVT) cytoplasm) compared to control (i.e. appropriate for gestational age) pregnancies, and a concomitant increase in GLUT8 expression in the same compartment, 2) HN and GLUT8 showed a protein-protein interaction by co-immunoprecipitation, 3) elevated HN and GLUT8 levels in vitro under simulated hypoxia in human EVT cells, HTR8/SVneo, and 4) increased HN expression but attenuated GLUT8 expression in vitro under serum deprivation in HTR8/SVneo cells. Conclusions There was elevated HN expression with cytoplasmic localization to EVTs on the maternal aspect of the human placenta affected by IUGR, also associated with increased GLUT8 expression. We found that while hypoxia increased both HN and GLUT8, serum deprivation increased HN expression alone. Also, a protein-protein interaction between HN and GLUT8 suggests that their interaction may fulfill a biologic role that requires interdependency. Future investigations delineating molecular interactions between these proteins are required to fully uncover their role in IUGR-affected pregnancies."
https://openalex.org/W2794510478,"Background Sessile serrated polyps (SSPs) have emerged as important precursors for a large number of sporadic colorectal cancers. They are difficult to detect during colonoscopy due to their flat shape and the excessive amounts of secreted mucin that cover the polyps. The underlying genetic and epigenetic basis for the emergence of SSPs is largely unknown with existing genetic studies confined to a limited number of oncogenes and tumor suppressors. A full characterization of the genetic and epigenetic landscape of SSPs would provide insight into their origin and potentially offer new biomarkers useful for detection of SSPs in stool samples. Methods We used a combination of genome-wide mutation detection, exome sequencing and DNA methylation profiling (via methyl-array and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing) to analyze multiple samples of sessile serrated polyps and compared these to familial adenomatous polyps. Results Our analysis revealed BRAF-V600E as the sole recurring somatic mutation in SSPs with no additional major genetic mutations detected. The occurrence of BRAF-V600E was coincident with a unique DNA methylation pattern revealing a set of DNA methylation markers showing significant (~3 to 30 fold) increase in their methylation levels, exclusively in SSP samples. These methylation patterns effectively distinguished sessile serrated polys from adenomatous polyps and did so more effectively than parallel gene expression profiles. Conclusions This study provides an important example of a single oncogenic mutation leading to reproducible global DNA methylation changes. These methylated markers are specific to SSPs and could be of important clinical relevance for the early diagnosis of SSPs using non-invasive approaches such as fecal DNA testing."
https://openalex.org/W2795010423,"Myeloperoxidase (MPO)-derived oxidants have emerged as a key contributor to tissue damage in inflammatory conditions such as cardiovascular disease. Pro-myeloperoxidase (pro-MPO), an enzymatically active precursor of myeloperoxidase (MPO), is known to be secreted from cultured bone marrow and promyelocytic leukemia cells, but evidence for the presence of pro-MPO in circulation is lacking. In the present study, we used a LC-MS/MS in addition to immunoblot analyses to show that pro-MPO is present in human blood plasma. Furthermore, we found that pro-MPO was more frequently detected in plasma from patients with myocardial infarction compared to plasma from control donors. Our study suggests that in addition to mature MPO, circulating pro-MPO may cause oxidative modifications of proteins thereby contributing to cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W4234727354,"Background Crop response to the changing climate and unpredictable effects of global warming with adverse conditions such as drought stress has brought concerns about food security to the fore; crop yield loss is a major cause of concern in this regard. Identification of genes with multiple responses across environmental stresses is the genetic foundation that leads to crop adaptation to environmental perturbations. Methods In this paper, we introduce an integrated approach to assess candidate genes for multiple stress responses across-species. The approach combines ontology based semantic data integration with expression profiling, comparative genomics, phylogenomics, functional gene enrichment and gene enrichment network analysis to identify genes associated with plant stress phenotypes. Five different ontologies, viz., Gene Ontology (GO), Trait Ontology (TO), Plant Ontology (PO), Growth Ontology (GRO) and Environment Ontology (EO) were used to semantically integrate drought related information. Results Target genes linked to Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) controlling yield and stress tolerance in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) and closely related species were identified. Based on the enriched GO terms of the biological processes, 1116 sorghum genes with potential responses to 5 different stresses, such as drought (18%), salt (32%), cold (20%), heat (8%) and oxidative stress (25%) were identified to be over-expressed. Out of 169 sorghum drought responsive QTLs associated genes that were identified based on expression datasets, 56% were shown to have multiple stress responses. On the other hand, out of 168 additional genes that have been evaluated for orthologous pairs, 90% were conserved across species for drought tolerance. Over 50% of identified maize and rice genes were responsive to drought and salt stresses and were co-located within multifunctional QTLs. Among the total identified multi-stress responsive genes, 272 targets were shown to be co-localized within QTLs associated with different traits that are responsive to multiple stresses. Ontology mapping was used to validate the identified genes, while reconstruction of the phylogenetic tree was instrumental to infer the evolutionary relationship of the sorghum orthologs. The results also show specific genes responsible for various interrelated components of drought response mechanism such as drought tolerance, drought avoidance and drought escape. Conclusions We submit that this approach is novel and to our knowledge, has not been used previously in any other research; it enables us to perform cross-species queries for genes that are likely to be associated with multiple stress tolerance, as a means to identify novel targets for engineering stress resistance in sorghum and possibly, in other crop species."
https://openalex.org/W2795254207,"The Pleistocene vertebrate assemblage of Aldabra Atoll has been comparatively well studied. Three Upper Pleistocene fossil localities have been described yielding birds, reptiles and terrestrial molluscs. Those of Bassin Cabri and Bassin Lebine on Ile Picard are undated but must be in excess of 136,000 YBP, whereas Point Hodoul on Malabar Island is circa 100,000 YBP. Aldabra was seemingly completely submerged between deposition of the Ile Picard and Point Hodoul deposits, resulting in local faunal extinctions. Here we present the results of an ongoing study of fossil material collected on Ile Picard in 1987, which reveals a more diverse assemblage than previously realised. Notable discoveries are an Ardeola heron, three Procellariformes, tropic-bird Phaethon, gull Larus, rail Dryolimnas, harrier Circus and owl Tyto, plus evidence of recolonisation of the atoll by some seabirds, rail, harrier, owl, giant tortoises and lizards after the Ile Picard/Point Hodoul submergence event."
https://openalex.org/W2795265319,"Background Patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) are at risk of thrombosis and bleeding. Data on the risks during rehabilitation are inconsistent, and thromboprophylactic strategies are heterogeneous. We aimed to evaluate the thrombotic risk and bleeding events of SCI patients during rehabilitation. Methods We retrospectively collected hospital record data of 263 consecutive SCI patients admitted at a rehabilitation clinic. 78 patients with acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) at the primary center, without acute trauma or lower extremity paresis, less than one month rehabilitation, or reasons for long-term therapeutic anticoagulation, were excluded. All patients received pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis throughout rehabilitation. Primary endpoint was objectively diagnosed VTE; secondary endpoint was bleeding. Results Of 185 patients, 162 (88%) were men; mean age was 47.8 years. 94 patients were tetraplegic, 91 paraplegic. During a mean (±SD) time of 5.1±2.1 months, VTE was diagnosed in 8 patients. After excluding five patients with VTE detected within 2 days after admission, the probability of developing VTE after 6 months of rehabilitation was 2% (95% CI 0–4.4%). Only high D-Dimer upon admission was associated with risk of VTE (adjusted HR 2.3, 95% CI 1.4–4.1). Of 24 bleedings, 14 (64%) occurred at the heparin injection site. Two patients had major bleeding and five had clinically relevant non major bleeding. Conclusion SCI patients are at risk of VTE and bleeding during rehabilitation. Strategies need to be developed to identify these patients in order to initiate adequate anticoagulation. Direct oral anticoagulants, which have a favourable risk-benefit profile and are convenient, should be explored."
https://openalex.org/W2794566101,"It is widely known that individuals frequently imitate each other in social situations and that such mimicry fulfills an important social role in the sense that it functions as a social glue. With reference to the anticipated action effect, it has recently been demonstrated that individuals do not only imitate others, but also engage in anticipated action before the observed person starts engaging in that action. Interestingly, both phenomena (i.e., mimicry and anticipated action) rely on tracking others' social behavior. Therefore, in the present research we investigated whether mimicry and anticipated action are related to social abilities as indicated by measures of social intelligence. The results demonstrate for the first time that mimicry as well as anticipated action is correlated with an important aspect of social intelligence-namely the ability to process social information. Theoretical implications and limitations are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2794762196,"Women are routinely exposed to images of extremely slim female bodies (the thin ideal) in advertisements, even if they do not necessarily pay much attention to these images. We hypothesized that paradoxically, it is precisely in such conditions of low attention that the impact of the social comparison with the thin ideal might be the most pronounced. To test this prediction, one hundred and seventy-three young female participants were exposed to images of the thin ideal or of women's fashion accessories. They were allocated to either a condition of high (memorizing 10 digits) or low cognitive load (memorizing 4 digits). The main dependent measure was implicit: mean recognition latency of negative words, relative to neutral words, as assessed by a lexical decision task. The results showed that thin-ideal exposure did not affect negative word accessibility under low cognitive load but that it increased it under high cognitive load. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that social comparison with the thin ideal is an automatic process, and contribute to explain why some strategies to prevent negative effects of thin-ideal exposure are inefficient."
https://openalex.org/W2795082565,"Background Multiple drug resistant (MDR) intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) are associated with notable direct and societal costs. As previous studies have not considered the impact of MDR on the total medical costs (TMCs) of IAIs, the present one examines this, as well as further estimates the additional costs at a national level. Methods This is a retrospective study. Firstly, we randomly selected a sample of 40% of all inpatients discharged between 2014 and 2015 from a teaching hospital, due to limits in budget and the large number of patients. Then, we manually selected 254 patients with IAIs according to the International Classification of Disease, 10th revision, using electronic medical records. Eventually, 101 patients with IAIs (64 MDR patients and 37 non-MDR patients) were included after excluding cases without laboratory test results, any pathogens detected, or antimicrobial resistant pathogens. Univariate analysis and a generalized linear model were applied to assess the parameters associated with TMCs. Results Compared to non-MDR patients, those with MDR pathogens were significantly associated with higher TMCs, higher antimicrobial costs, higher antimicrobial usage, larger number of pathogens, and longer length of stay and were more likely to have insurance and combination antimicrobial therapy. In addition, the average TMC among patients with MDR pathogens was ¥ 131801, which is ¥ 90201 higher than those without MDR pathogens. If our results are applied to the whole country, the sum of all attributable TMCs was ¥ 37 billion. The societal costs, furthermore, were ¥111 billion in 2015. Conclusion Our results provide information that should lead to increased efforts to reduce inappropriate antimicrobial therapy, in order to decrease the emergence of MDR pathogens and to reduce their economic burden."
https://openalex.org/W2794887391,"Background Different outcomes among patients hospitalized for bleeding after starting anticoagulation could influence choice of anticoagulant. We compared length of hospitalization, proportion of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions, ICU length of stay, and 30- and 90-day mortality for adults with atrial fibrillation hospitalized for bleeding after starting warfarin, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban. Methods An US commercial database of 38 million members from 1 November 2010 to 31 March 2014 was used to examine adults with atrial fibrillation hospitalized for bleeding after starting warfarin (2,446), dabigatran (442), or rivaroxaban (256). Outcomes included difference in mean total length of hospitalization, proportion of ICU admissions, mean length of ICU stay, and all-cause 30- and 90-day mortality. Results Warfarin users were older and had more comorbidities. Multivariable regression modeling with propensity score weighting showed warfarin users were hospitalized 2.0 days longer (95% CI 1.8–2.3; p < 0.001) than dabigatran users and 2.6 days longer (95% CI 2.4–2.9; p < 0.001) than rivaroxaban users. Dabigatran users were hospitalized 0.6 days longer (95% CI 0.2–1.0; p = 0.001) than rivaroxaban users. There were no differences in the proportion of ICU admissions. Among ICU admissions, warfarin users stayed 3.0 days (95% CI 1.9–3.9; p < 0.001) longer than dabigatran users and 2.4 days longer (95% CI 0.9–3.7; p = 0.003) than rivaroxaban users. There was no difference in ICU stay between dabigatran and rivaroxaban users. There were no differences in 30- and 90-day all-cause mortality. Conclusions Rivaroxaban and dabigatran were associated with shorter hospitalizations; however, there were no differences in 30- and 90-day mortality. These findings suggest bleeding associated with the newer agents is not more dangerous than bleeding associated with warfarin."
https://openalex.org/W2794982632,"Angiogenesis plays an essential role in tumors development. In case of central nervous system tumors, the most important role in this process plays VEGF-A. The purpose of this study was to determine the plasma concentration of this agent in patients treated surgically because of intracranial tumors. The study involved 48 adult patients, both sexes, treated surgically because of a brain tumor. The control group consisted of 50 adult volunteers of both sexes, without cancer diagnosis. Based on the studies, it was found that serum VEGF-A levels before surgery are higher in patients with central nervous system tumors (10.39–150.57 pg/ml, median 41.70 pg/ml) than in non-cancer patients (0.00–130.77 pg/ml, median 22.56 pg/ml). The association between serum VEGF-A level and malignancy and histological type of intracranial tumor has not beed confirmed. The highest average preoperative serum VEGF-A level was found in patients with low grade gliomas, slightly lower (close to each other) in those with high grade gliomas and meningiomas, while the lowest level was characteristic for metastatic tumors. High variation in results was observed in patients with low grade gliomas (52.56 pg/ml)—higher than those reported in patients with high grade gliomas (32.38 pg/ml). In the rest types of tumors the differentiation was similar and oscillated within 23.08–27.50 pg/ml."
https://openalex.org/W2794931190,"The gills of juvenile freshwater bivalves undergo a complex morphogenesis that may correlate with changes in feeding ecology, but ontogenic studies on juvenile mussels are rare. Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine the ultrastructure and ontogeny of 117 juvenile freshwater pearl mussels (Margaritifera margaritifera) ranging in age from 1-44 months and length from 0.49-8.90 mm. Three stages of gill development are described. In Stage 1 (5-9 inner demibranch filaments), only unreflected inner demibranch filaments were present. In Stage 2 (9-17 inner demibranch filaments), inner demibranch filaments began to reflect when shell length exceeded 1.13 mm, at 13-16 months old. Reflection began in medial filaments and then proceeded anterior and posterior. In Stage 3 (28-94 inner demibranch filaments), outer demibranch filaments began developing at shell length > 3.1 mm and about 34 months of age. The oral groove on the inner demibranch was first observed in 34 month old specimens > 2.66 mm but was never observed on the outer demibranch. Shell length (R2 = 0.99) was a better predictor of developmental stage compared to age (R2 = 0.84). The full suite of gill ciliation was present on filaments in all stages. Interfilamentary distance averaged 31.3 μm and did not change with age (4-44 months) or with size (0.75-8.9 mm). Distance between laterofrontal cirri couplets averaged 1.54 μm and did not change significantly with size or age. Labial palp primordia were present in even the youngest individuals but ciliature became more diverse in more developed individuals. Information presented here is valuable to captive rearing programmes as it provides insight in to when juveniles may be particularly vulnerable to stressors due to specific ontogenic changes. The data are compared with two other recent studies of Margaritifera development."
https://openalex.org/W2795078176,"In Experiment 1, the symbol interdependency hypothesis was tested with both concrete and abstract stimuli. Symbolic (i.e., semantic neighbourhood distance) and embodied (i.e., iconicity) factors were manipulated in two tasks—one that tapped symbolic relations (i.e., semantic relatedness judgment) and another that tapped embodied relations (i.e., iconicity judgment). Results supported the symbol interdependency hypothesis in that the symbolic factor was recruited for the semantic relatedness task and the embodied factor was recruited for the iconicity task. Across tasks, and especially in the iconicity task, abstract stimuli resulted in shorter RTs. This finding was in contrast to the concreteness effect where concrete words result in shorter RTs. Experiment 2 followed up on this finding by replicating the iconicity task from Experiment 1 in an ERP paradigm. Behavioural results continued to show a reverse concreteness effect with shorter RTs for abstract stimuli. However, ERP results paralleled the N400 and anterior N700 concreteness effects found in the literature, with more negative amplitudes for concrete stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2792604746,"British Culex pipiens complex [Culex pipiens sensu lato) mosquito distribution, abundance, and potential for disease transmission are intimately linked to their environment. Pond and lake dyes that block light to restrict algal photosynthesis are a relatively new product assumed to be an environmentally friendly since they are based on food dyes. Their use in urban garden ponds raises questions linked to mosquito oviposition, since coloured water can be an attractant. Culex (mostly pipiens) is commonly found in UK gardens and is a potential vector of viruses including the West Nile Virus (WNV). Any factors that significantly change the distribution and population of Cx pipiens could impact future risks of disease transmission. A gravid trap was used to catch female Cx pipiens mosquitoes for use in oviposition choice tests in laboratory and semi-field conditions. Two types of pond dye, blue and shadow (which looks slightly red), were tested for their impact on oviposition and survival of wild caught Cx pipiens. There were no significant differences in the number of egg batches laid when gravid mosquitoes were given a choice between either blue dye and clear water or shadow dye and clear water indicating that these dyes are not attractants. Larvae hatched from egg batches laid by wild-caught gravid females were used to measure survival to adulthood with or without dye, in a habitat controlled to prevent further colonisation. The experiment was run twice, once in the summer and again in the autumn, whereas the dyes had no impact on emergence in the summer, there were highly significant reductions in emergence of adults in both dye treated habitats in the autumn. Containers with or without shadow dye were placed outside to colonise naturally and were sampled weekly for larvae and pupae over a 6 month period through summer and autumn. There was a significant negative effect of shadow dye on pupal abundance in a three week period over the summer, but otherwise there was no effect. It is likely that population abundance and food was a more powerful factor for mosquito survival than the dye."

This study aimed to investigate how much two consecutive sunscreen applications increased the quantity of sunscreen applied and decreased the skin area left without sunscreen (missed area) compared to a single application. Thirty-one healthy volunteers wearing swimwear were included and applied sunscreen two consecutive times in a laboratory environment. Participants had pictures taken in black light before and after each application. As sunscreens absorb black light, the darkness of the skin increased with increasing amounts of sunscreen applied. We conducted a standard curve establishing a link between change in picture darkness and quantity of sunscreen. The quantity of sunscreen at selected skin sites as well as the percentage of missed area was determined after each application. Participants had missed a median of 20% of their available body surface after a single application. After double application they had missed 9%. The decrease in missed areas was significant for the whole body surface and for each of the body regions separately. The median participant had applied between 13% and 100% more sunscreen at the selected skin sites after double application than after single application. We recommend double application, especially before intense sun exposure."

Discrete choice experiment method was used in the present study to identify and prioritize those attributes that are of interest to MS patients and increases the utility of the use of IFN-β in their treatment. Questionnaires were given to 358 patients in Isfahan-Iran, who were asked to choose between the two treatment choices in each scenario. The results of the logit model showed that the changes in the efficacy lead to the most changes in the patient utility. Changes in side effects and ease of injection have been placed in the next rankings. Considering the drug attributes considered more desirable by patients can lead to greater medication adherence and possibly better treatment outcomes. Also, pharmaceutical companies, the health ministry, the Food and Drug Administration, insurance organizations, and neurologists can benefit from this information in production and importation, policymaking, and prescription."
https://openalex.org/W2795284060,"Peer-to-peer lending is hypothesized to help equalize economic opportunities for the world's poor. We empirically investigate the ""flat-world"" hypothesis, the idea that globalization eventually leads to economic equality, using crowdfinancing data for over 660,000 loans in 220 nations and territories made between 2005 and 2013. Contrary to the flat-world hypothesis, we find that peer-to-peer lending networks are moving away from flatness. Furthermore, decreasing flatness is strongly associated with multiple variables: relatively stable patterns in the difference in the per capita GDP between borrowing and lending nations, ongoing migration flows from borrowing to lending nations worldwide, and the existence of a tie as a historic colonial. Our regression analysis also indicates a spatial preference in lending for geographically proximal borrowers. To estimate the robustness for these patterns for future changes, we construct a network of borrower and lending nations based on the observed data. Then, to perturb the network, we stochastically simulate policy and event shocks (e.g., erecting walls) or regulatory shocks (e.g., Brexit). The simulations project a drift towards rather than away from flatness. However, levels of flatness persist only for randomly distributed shocks. By contrast, loss of the top borrowing nations produces more flatness, not less, indicating how the welfare of the overall system is tied to a few distinctive and critical country-pair relationships."
https://openalex.org/W2795067466,"Plants that lack chlorophyll are rare and typically restricted to holoparasites that obtain their carbon, water and mineral resources from a host plant. Although not parasites in the traditional sense, albino foliage, such as the sprouts that sometimes develop from redwood tree trunks, are comparable in function. They occur sporadically, and can reach the size of shrubs and in rare cases, trees. Albino redwoods are interesting because in addition to their reduced carbon resources, the absence of chloroplasts may impede proper stomatal function, and both aspects may have upstream consequences on water transport and xylem quality. We examined the water relations, water transport and xylem anatomical attributes of albino redwoods and show that similar to achlorophyllous and parasitic plants, albino redwoods have notably higher stomatal conductance than green sprouts. Given that stem xylem tracheid size as well as water transport efficiency are nearly equivalent in both albino and green individuals, we attribute the increased leaf water loss in albino sprouts to lower leaf to xylem area ratios, which favour improved hydration relative to green sprouts. The stems of albino redwoods were more vulnerable to drought-induced embolism than green stems, and this was consistent with the albino's weaker tracheids, as characterized by wall thickness to lumen diameter measures. Our results are both complementary and consistent with previous research on achlorophyllous plants, and suggest that the loss of stomatal control and photosynthetic capacity results in substantial vascular and anatomical adjustments."

Given a set of candidate road projects with associated costs, finding the best subset with respect to a limited budget is known as a bilevel Discrete Network Design Problem (DNDP) of NP-hard computationally complexity. We engage with the complexity with a hybrid exact-heuristic methodology based on a two-stage relaxation as follows: (i) the bilevel feature is relaxed to a single-level problem by taking the network performance function of the upper level into the user equilibrium traffic assignment problem (UE-TAP) in the lower level as a constraint. It results in a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem which is then solved using the Outer Approximation (OA) algorithm (ii) we further relax the multi-commodity UE-TAP to a single-commodity MILP problem, that is, the multiple OD pairs are aggregated to a single OD pair. This methodology has two main advantages: (i) the method is proven to be highly efficient to solve the DNDP for a large-sized network of Winnipeg, Canada. The results suggest that within a limited number of iterations (as termination criterion), global optimum solutions are quickly reached in most of the cases; otherwise, good solutions (close to global optimum solutions) are found in early iterations. Comparative analysis of the networks of Gao and Sioux-Falls shows that for such a non-exact method the global optimum solutions are found in fewer iterations than those found in some analytically exact algorithms in the literature. (ii) Integration of the objective function among the constraints provides a commensurate capability to tackle the multi-objective (or multi-criteria) DNDP as well."
https://openalex.org/W2795224202,"RAF kinases are major constituents of the mitogen activated signaling pathway, regulating cell proliferation, differentiation and cell survival of many cell types, including neurons. In mammals, the family of RAF proteins consists of three members, ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF. Ablation of CRAF kinase in inbred mouse strains causes major developmental defects during fetal growth and embryonic or perinatal lethality. Heterozygous germline mutations in CRAF result in Noonan syndrome, which is characterized by neurocognitive impairment that may involve hippocampal physiology. The role of CRAF signaling during hippocampal development and generation of new postnatal hippocampal granule neurons has not been examined and may provide novel insight into the cause of hippocampal dysfunction in Noonan syndrome. In this study, by crossing CRAF-deficiency to CD-1 outbred mice, a CRAF mouse model was established which enabled us to investigate the interplay of neural progenitor proliferation and postmitotic differentiation during adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Albeit the general morphology of the hippocampus was unchanged, CRAF-deficient mice displayed smaller granule cell layer (GCL) volume at postnatal day 30 (P30). In CRAF-deficient mice a substantial number of abnormal, chromophilic, fast dividing cells were found in the subgranular zone (SGZ) and hilus of the dentate gyrus (DG), indicating that CRAF signaling contributes to hippocampal neural progenitor proliferation. CRAF-deficient neural progenitor cells showed an increased cell death rate and reduced neuronal maturation. These results indicate that CRAF function affects postmitotic neural cell differentiation and points to a critical role of CRAF-dependent growth factor signaling pathway in the postmitotic development of adult-born neurons."

Clinical risk factors associated with a significantly increased likelihood of testing included HIV, immunosuppressive therapy, exposure to tuberculosis, a history of tuberculosis, diabetes, tobacco use, end stage renal disease, and alcohol use disorder. Other significant variables included gender, age, asthma, the state tuberculosis rate, population density, and percent of foreign-born persons in a county.Private sector TST/IGRA testing is not uncommon and testing varies with clinical risk indicators. Thus, the private sector can be a powerful resource in the fight against tuberculosis.
