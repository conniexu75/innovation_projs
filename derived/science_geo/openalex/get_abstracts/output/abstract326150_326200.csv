https://openalex.org/W2141155302,"Distinct plaques, each of which is due to the release of hemolysin by a single antibody-forming cell, are revealed by complement after incubation, in an agar layer, of a mixture of sheep red cells and lymphoid cells from a rabbit immunized with sheep red cells."
https://openalex.org/W1964349698,"A Penicillium urticae Bainer, isolated from subsurface-tilled plots showing reduced wheat growth, produced a phytotoxic substance. The melting point and infrared and ultraviolet spectra of the crystalline material showed this substance to be patulin. Wheat shoot growth inhibition of 50 percent required 20, 20, and 75 parts per million of patulin in solution, sand, and soil culture, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2030896346,"Microgram quantities of copper, manganese, and zinc, corresponding to concentrations greater than 100 parts per million, were found in milligram quantities of primary inclusion fluid extracted from samples of quartz and fluorite from two types of ore deposits. The results indicate that neutron activation is a useful analytical method for studying the content of heavy metal in fluid inclusions."

https://openalex.org/W2047081340,"Seed germination of Melampyrum lineare proceeds only after activation followed by an extended period of chilling. Up to one-third of seeds can be activated by storage at room temperature, while all seeds are activated if treated with gibberellic acid. Chilling before activation is ineffective."

https://openalex.org/W2025501547,"The 200-inch Hale telescope has been used to make high-resolution maps of the brightness temperature of Venus at wavelengths 8 to 14 microns. Resolution of about 1/30 of the disk reveals a general symmetry about the plane of the orbit, no daynight temperature effects, and a transient temperature anomaly in the southern hemisphere."
https://openalex.org/W2040527180,"Cytochrome is present in the autotrophic sulfur bacterium, Thiobacillus thiooxidans. As mediator in the final electron transfer to oxygen, the cytochrome participates in the oxidation of sulfur compounds by extracts of the organism."
https://openalex.org/W2081222748,"The vibrations of animals digging in a dry or moist substratum may be picked up and recorded continuously by a microphone, amplifier, and recorder setup. The apparatus permits a large region, such as an activity cage, to be monitored without disturbance of the animals or special requirements for soil conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2028191767,"When Tribolium confusum pupae were exposed continuously to temperatures from 10 degrees C to 40 degrees C, the adults which finally emerged exhibited wing abnormalities typical of those obtained with x-irradiation. The data indicate the implication of two processes. Two mathematical models are suggested to account for this phenomenon."
