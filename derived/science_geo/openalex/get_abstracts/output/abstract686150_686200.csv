https://openalex.org/W4200309699,"Biased signaling of G protein-coupled receptors describes an ability of different ligands that preferentially activate an alternative downstream signaling pathway. In this work, we identified and characterized different N-terminal truncations of endogenous chemokine CCL15 as balanced or biased agonists targeting CCR1, and presented three cryogenic-electron microscopy structures of the CCR1-Gi complex in the ligand-free form or bound to different CCL15 truncations with a resolution of 2.6-2.9 Å, illustrating the structural basis of natural biased signaling that initiates an inflammation response. Complemented with pharmacological and computational studies, these structures revealed it was the conformational change of Tyr291 (Y2917.43) in CCR1 that triggered its polar network rearrangement in the orthosteric binding pocket and allosterically regulated the activation of β-arrestin signaling. Our structure of CCL15-bound CCR1 also exhibited a critical site for ligand binding distinct from many other chemokine-receptor complexes, providing new insights into the mode of chemokine recognition."

However, the delivery of in vitro-produced DNA to target cells can be inefficient, and low abundance of template DNA may underlie the low rate of precise editing. One potential tool to produce template DNA inside cells is a retron, a bacterial retroelement involved in phage defense. However, little effort has been directed at optimizing retrons to produce designed sequences. Here, we identify modifications to the retron non-coding RNA (ncRNA) that result in more abundant reverse-transcribed DNA (RT-DNA). By testing architectures of the retron operon that enable efficient reverse transcription, we find that gains in DNA production are portable from prokaryotic to eukaryotic cells and result in more efficient genome editing. Finally, we show that retron RT-DNA can be used to precisely edit cultured human cells. These experiments provide a general framework to produce DNA using retrons for genome modification."
https://openalex.org/W4221040699,"Remdesivir (RDV) is a direct-acting antiviral agent that is approved in several countries for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. RDV exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity against positive-sense RNA viruses, for example, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and hepatitis C virus, and nonsegmented negative-sense RNA viruses, for example, Nipah virus, whereas segmented negative-sense RNA viruses such as influenza virus or Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus are not sensitive to the drug. The reasons for this apparent efficacy pattern are unknown. Here, we expressed and purified representative RNA-dependent RNA polymerases and studied three biochemical parameters that have been associated with the inhibitory effects of RDV-triphosphate (TP): (i) selective incorporation of the nucleotide substrate RDV-TP, (ii) the effect of the incorporated RDV-monophosphate (MP) on primer extension, and (iii) the effect of RDV-MP in the template during incorporation of the complementary UTP. We found a strong correlation between antiviral effects and efficient incorporation of RDV-TP. Inhibition in primer extension reactions was heterogeneous and usually inefficient at higher NTP concentrations. In contrast, template-dependent inhibition of UTP incorporation opposite the embedded RDV-MP was seen with all polymerases. Molecular modeling suggests a steric conflict between the 1'-cyano group of the inhibitor and residues of the structurally conserved RNA-dependent RNA polymerase motif F. We conclude that future efforts in the development of nucleotide analogs with a broader spectrum of antiviral activities should focus on improving rates of incorporation while capitalizing on the inhibitory effects of a bulky 1'-modification."
https://openalex.org/W4200143954,"Cancer cells frequently exhibit uncoupling of the glycolytic pathway from the TCA cycle (i.e., the ""Warburg effect"") and as a result, often become dependent on their ability to increase glutamine catabolism. The mitochondrial enzyme Glutaminase C (GAC) helps to satisfy this 'glutamine addiction' of cancer cells by catalyzing the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate, which is then converted to the TCA-cycle intermediate α-ketoglutarate. This makes GAC an intriguing drug target and spurred the molecules derived from bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide (the so-called BPTES class of allosteric GAC inhibitors), including CB-839, which is currently in clinical trials. However, none of the drugs targeting GAC are yet approved for cancer treatment and their mechanism of action is not well understood. Here, we shed new light on the underlying basis for the differential potencies exhibited by members of the BPTES/CB-839 family of compounds, which could not previously be explained with standard cryo-cooled X-ray crystal structures of GAC bound to CB-839 or its analogs. Using an emerging technique known as serial room temperature crystallography, we were able to observe clear differences between the binding conformations of inhibitors with significantly different potencies. We also developed a computational model to further elucidate the molecular basis of differential inhibitor potency. We then corroborated the results from our modeling efforts using recently established fluorescence assays that directly read out inhibitor binding to GAC. Together, these findings should aid in future design of more potent GAC inhibitors with better clinical outlook."
https://openalex.org/W4200140420,"Oxidative stress, inflammation, and aberrant activation of microglia in the retina are commonly observed in ocular pathologies. In glaucoma or age-related macular degeneration, the chronic activation of microglia affects retinal ganglion cells and photoreceptors, respectively, contributing to gradual vision loss. However, the molecular mechanisms that cause activation of microglia in the retina are not fully understood. Here we show that exposure of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells to chronic low-level oxidative stress induces mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-specific damage, and the subsequent translocation of damaged mtDNA to the cytoplasm results in the binding and activation of intracellular DNA receptor Z-DNA-binding protein 1 (ZBP1). Activation of the mtDNA/ZBP1 pathway triggers the expression of proinflammatory markers in RPE cells. In addition, we show that the enhanced release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing fragments of mtDNA derived from the apical site of RPE cells induces a proinflammatory phenotype of microglia via activation of ZBP1 signaling. Collectively, our report establishes oxidatively damaged mtDNA as an important signaling molecule with ZBP1 as its intracellular receptor in the development of an inflammatory response in the retina. We propose that this novel mtDNA-mediated autocrine and paracrine mechanism for triggering and maintaining inflammation in the retina may play an important role in ocular pathologies. Therefore, the molecular mechanisms identified in this report are potentially suitable therapeutic targets to ameliorate development of ocular pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W4200466215,"Persistent inactivity promotes skeletal muscle atrophy, marked by mitochondrial aberrations that affect strength, mobility, and metabolic health leading to the advancement of disease. Mitochondrial quality control (MQC) pathways include biogenesis (synthesis), mitophagy/lysosomal turnover, and the mitochondrial unfolded protein response, which serve to maintain an optimal organelle network. Tumor suppressor p53 has been implicated in regulating muscle mitochondria in response to cellular stress; however, its role in the context of muscle disuse has yet to be explored, and whether p53 is necessary for MQC remains unclear. To address this, we subjected p53 muscle-specific KO (mKO) and WT mice to unilateral denervation. Transcriptomic and pathway analyses revealed dysregulation of pathways pertaining to mitochondrial function, and especially turnover, in mKO muscle following denervation. Protein and mRNA data of the MQC pathways indicated activation of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response and mitophagy-lysosome systems along with reductions in mitochondrial biogenesis and content in WT and mKO tissue following chronic denervation. However, p53 ablation also attenuated the expression of autophagy-mitophagy machinery, reduced autophagic flux, and enhanced lysosomal dysfunction. While similar reductions in mitochondrial biogenesis and content were observed between genotypes, MQC dysregulation exacerbated mitochondrial dysfunction in mKO fibers, evidenced by elevated reactive oxygen species. Moreover, acute experiments indicate that p53 mediates the expression of transcriptional regulators of MQC pathways as early as 1 day following denervation. Together, our data illustrate exacerbated mitochondrial dysregulation with denervation stress in p53 mKO tissue, thus indicating that p53 contributes to organellar maintenance via regulation of MQC pathways during muscle atrophy."
https://openalex.org/W4200242705,"Histone variants and the associated post-translational modifications that govern the stemness of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and differentiation thereof into progenitors (HSPCs) have not been well defined. H3.3 is a replication-independent H3 histone variant in mammalian systems that is enriched at both H3K4me3- and H3K27me3-marked bivalent genes as well as H3K9me3-marked endogenous retroviral repeats. Here we show that H3.3, but not its chaperone Hira, prevents premature HSC exhaustion and differentiation into granulocyte-macrophage progenitors. H3.3-null HSPCs display reduced expression of stemness and lineage-specific genes with a predominant gain of H3K27me3 marks at their promoter regions. Concomitantly, loss of H3.3 leads to a reduction of H3K9me3 marks at endogenous retroviral repeats, opening up binding sites for the interferon regulatory factor family of transcription factors, allowing the survival of rare, persisting H3.3-null HSCs. We propose a model whereby H3.3 maintains adult HSC stemness by safeguarding the delicate interplay between H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 marks, enforcing chromatin adaptability."
https://openalex.org/W4200573032,"Small-molecule kinase inhibitors represent a major group of cancer therapeutics, but tumor responses are often incomplete. To identify pathways that modulate kinase inhibitor response, we conducted a genome-wide knockout (KO) screen in glioblastoma cells treated with the pan-ErbB inhibitor neratinib. Loss of general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) kinase rendered cells resistant to neratinib, whereas depletion of the GADD34 phosphatase increased neratinib sensitivity. Loss of GCN2 conferred neratinib resistance by preventing binding and activation of GCN2 by neratinib. Several other Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved inhibitors, such erlotinib and sunitinib, also bound and activated GCN2. Our results highlight the utility of genome-wide functional screens to uncover novel mechanisms of drug action and document the role of the integrated stress response (ISR) in modulating the response to inhibitors of oncogenic kinases."
https://openalex.org/W4200405620,"Numerous rodent studies demonstrate developmental programming of offspring cognition by maternal choline intake, with prenatal choline deprivation causing lasting adverse effects and supplemental choline producing lasting benefits. Few human studies have evaluated the effect of maternal choline supplementation on offspring cognition, with none following children to school age. Here, we report results from a controlled feeding study in which pregnant women were randomized to consume 480 mg choline/d (approximately the Adequate Intake [AI]) or 930 mg choline/d during the 3rd trimester. Sustained attention was assessed in the offspring at age 7 years (n = 20) using a signal detection task that showed benefits of maternal choline supplementation in a murine model. Children in the 930 mg/d group showed superior performance (vs. 480 mg/d group) on the primary endpoint (SAT score, p = .02) and a superior ability to maintain correct signal detections (hits) across the 12-min session (p = .02), indicative of improved sustained attention. This group difference in vigilance decrement varied by signal duration (p = .04). For the briefest (17 ms) signals, the 480 mg/d group showed a 22.9% decline in hits across the session compared to a 1.5% increase in hits for the 930 mg/d group (p = .04). The groups did not differ in vigilance decrement for 29 or 50 ms signals. This pattern suggests an enhanced ability to sustain perceptual amplification of a brief low-contrast visual signal by children in the 930 mg/d group. This inference of improved sustained attention by the 930 mg/d group is strengthened by the absence of group differences for false alarms, omissions, and off-task behaviors. This pattern of results indicates that maternal 3rd trimester consumption of the choline AI for pregnancy (vs. double the AI) produces offspring with a poorer ability to sustain attention—reinforcing concerns that, on average, choline consumption by pregnant women is approximately 70% of the AI."
https://openalex.org/W4200350778,"Cancer is often characterized by aberrant gene expression patterns caused by the inappropriate activation of transcription factors. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a key transcriptional regulator of many protumorigenic processes and is persistently activated in many types of human cancer. However, like many transcription factors, STAT3 has proven difficult to target clinically. To address this unmet clinical need, we previously developed a cell-based assay of STAT3 transcriptional activity and performed an unbiased and high-throughput screen of small molecules known to be biologically active in humans. We identified the antimicrobial drug pyrimethamine as a novel and specific inhibitor of STAT3 transcriptional activity. Here, we show that pyrimethamine does not significantly affect STAT3 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, or DNA binding at concentrations sufficient to inhibit STAT3 transcriptional activity, suggesting a potentially novel mechanism of inhibition. To identify the direct molecular target of pyrimethamine and further elucidate the mechanism of action, we used a new quantitative proteome profiling approach called proteome integral solubility alteration coupled with a metabolomic analysis. We identified human dihydrofolate reductase as a target of pyrimethamine and demonstrated that the STAT3-inhibitory effects of pyrimethamine are the result of a deficiency in reduced folate downstream of dihydrofolate reductase inhibition, implicating folate metabolism in the regulation of STAT3 transcriptional activity. This study reveals a previously unknown regulatory node of the STAT3 pathway that may be important for the development of novel strategies to treat STAT3-driven cancers."
https://openalex.org/W4200495924,"Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is an inflammation-mediated process arising from ischemia/reperfusion-elicited stress in multiple cell types, causing liver damage during surgical procedures and often resulting in liver failure. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress triggers the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and is implicated in tissue injuries, including hepatic I/R injury. However, the cellular mechanism that links the UPR signaling to local inflammatory responses during hepatic I/R injury remains largely obscure. Here, we report that IRE1α, a critical ER-resident transmembrane signal transducer of the UPR, plays an important role in promoting Kupffer-cell-mediated liver inflammation and hepatic I/R injury. Utilizing a mouse model in which IRE1α is specifically ablated in myeloid cells, we found that abrogation of IRE1α markedly attenuated necrosis and cell death in the liver, accompanied by reduced neutrophil infiltration and liver inflammation following hepatic I/R injury. Mechanistic investigations in mice as well as in primary Kupffer cells revealed that loss of IRE1α in Kupffer cells not only blunted the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1β production, but also suppressed the expression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNos) and proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of IRE1α's RNase activity was able to attenuate inflammasome activation and iNos expression in Kupffer cells, leading to alleviation of hepatic I/R injury. Collectively, these results demonstrate that Kupffer cell IRE1α mediates local inflammatory damage during hepatic I/R injury. Our findings suggest that IRE1α RNase activity may serve as a promising target for therapeutic treatment of ischemia/reperfusion-associated liver inflammation and dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W4226161835,"Liver injury is the first step in causing fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer, leading to mortality. However, the drivers of progressive liver injury are still incompletely defined. Here, we identify GBP5 as a major factor causing liver injury and inflammation. We show that the expression of GBP5 is abnormally elevated in the damaged liver, and its expression depends at least partially on the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK)/NF-κB2 signaling pathway. Knockout of Gbp5 ameliorates D-galactosamine/lipopolysaccharide (GalN/LPS)-induced liver injury and inflammation. Conversely, liver-specific overexpression of GBP5 induces liver injury and inflammation. Mechanistically, GBP5 induces hepatocyte apoptosis through the activation of both calpain/caspase 12/caspase 3 and TNFα/caspase 8/caspase 3 signaling pathways. Inhibition of either calpain activity or caspase 3 prevents GBP5-induced cell death. Our data demonstrate that GBP5 expression is induced by toxins or the NIK signaling pathway, which promotes both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis signaling pathways and further induces liver injury, providing a novel drug target for the treatment of liver injury and inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W4200158123,"Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is a biological phenomenon wherein a metastable and concentrated droplet phase of biomolecules spontaneously forms. A link may exist between LLPS of proteins and the disease-related process of amyloid fibril formation; however, this connection is not fully understood. Here, we investigated the relationship between LLPS and aggregation of the C-terminal domain of TAR DNA-binding protein 43, an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-related protein known to both phase separate and form amyloids, by monitoring conformational changes during droplet aging using Raman spectroscopy. We found that the earliest aggregation events occurred within droplets as indicated by the development of β-sheet structure and increased thioflavin-T emission. Interestingly, filamentous aggregates appeared outside the solidified droplets at a later time, suggestive that amyloid formation is a heterogeneous process under LLPS solution conditions. Furthermore, the secondary structure content of aggregated structures inside droplets is distinct from that in de novo fibrils, implying that fibril polymorphism develops as a result of different environments (LLPS versus bulk solution), which may have pathological significance."
https://openalex.org/W4200227286,"The mineralization capability of cementoblasts is the foundation for repairing orthodontic treatment-induced root resorption. It is essential to investigate the regulatory mechanism of mineralization in cementoblasts under mechanical compression to improve orthodontic therapy. Autophagy has a protective role in maintaining cell homeostasis under environmental stress and was reported to be involved in the mineralization process. Long noncoding RNAs are important regulators of biological processes, but their functions in compressed cementoblasts during orthodontic tooth movement remain unclear. In this study, we showed that compressive force downregulated the expression of mineralization-related markers. LincRNA-p21 was strongly enhanced by compressive force. Overexpression of lincRNA-p21 downregulated the expression of mineralization-related markers, while knockdown of lincRNA-p21 reversed the compressive force-induced decrease in mineralization. Furthermore, we found that autophagy was impeded in compressed cementoblasts. Then, overexpression of lincRNA-p21 decreased autophagic activity, while knockdown of lincRNA-p21 reversed the autophagic process decreased by mechanical compression. However, the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine abolished the lincRNA-p21 knockdown-promoted mineralization, and the autophagy activator rapamycin rescued the mineralization inhibited by lincRNA-p21 overexpression. Mechanistically, the direct binding between lincRNA-p21 and FoxO3 blocked the expression of autophagy-related genes. In a mouse orthodontic tooth movement model, knockdown of lincRNA-p21 rescued the impeded autophagic process in cementoblasts, enhanced cementogenesis, and alleviated orthodontic force-induced root resorption. Overall, compressive force-induced lincRNA-p21 inhibits the mineralization capability of cementoblasts by impeding the autophagic process."
https://openalex.org/W4206615517,"Class B G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are notoriously difficult to target by small molecules because their large orthosteric peptide-binding pocket embedded deep within the transmembrane domain limits the identification and development of nonpeptide small molecule ligands. Using the parathyroid hormone type 1 receptor (PTHR) as a prototypic class B GPCR target, and a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and elastic network model-based methods, we demonstrate that PTHR druggability can be effectively addressed. Here we found a key mechanical site that modulates the collective dynamics of the receptor and used this ensemble of PTHR conformers to identify selective small molecules with strong negative allosteric and biased properties for PTHR signaling in cell and PTH actions in vivo. This study provides a computational pipeline to detect precise druggable sites and identify allosteric modulators of PTHR signaling that could be extended to GPCRs to expedite discoveries of small molecules as novel therapeutic candidates."
https://openalex.org/W4200054805,"Plasmodium falciparum Malaria and Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection are risk factors in the development of Burkitt's lymphoma. In Indonesia, 100% of the population is persistently infected with EBV early in life and at risk of developing EBV-linked cancers. Currently, 10.7 million people in Indonesia are living in Malaria-endemic areas. This cross-sectional study was initiated to investigate how acute Malaria dysregulates immune control over latent EBV infection. Using blood and plasma samples of 68 patients with acute Malaria and 27 healthy controls, we measured the level of parasitemia for each plasmodium type (P. falciparum, P. vivax, and mixed) by microscopy and rapid test. The level of 4 regulatory cytokines was determined by quantitative ELISA and the level of circulating EBV genome by real-time PCR targeting the single copy EBNA-1 sequence. All Plasmodium-infected cases had high-level parasitemia (>1000 parasites/ul blood) except for one case. EBV-DNA levels were significantly more elevated in P. falciparum and P. vivax infections (P<0.05) compared to controls. EBV-DNA levels were not related to age, gender, Malaria symptoms, or plasmodium type. TNF-α and IL-10 levels were increased in Malaria cases versus controls, but IFN-γ and TGF- β levels were comparable between the groups. Only TNF-α levels in P. falciparum cases showed a clear correlation with elevated EBV DNA levels (R2 = 0.8915). This is the first study addressing the relation between EBV (re)activation and cytokine responses during acute Malaria, revealing a clear correlation between pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α and EBV-DNA levels, specifically in P. falciparum cases, suggesting this cytokine to be key in dysregulating EBV homeostasis during acute P. falciparum Malaria."
https://openalex.org/W4200075926,"Lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD1) as the first identified histone/lysine demethylase regulates gene expression and protein functions in diverse diseases. In this study, we show that the expression of LSD1 is increased in mouse kidneys with unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and in cultured NRK-52E cells undergoing TGF-β1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Inhibition of LSD1 with its specific inhibitor ORY1001 attenuated renal EMT and fibrosis, which was associated with decreased the deposition of extracellular matrix proteins and the expression of fibrotic markers, including α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and fibronectin, and the recovery of E-cadherin expression and decrease of N-cadherin expression in UUO kidneys and in NRK-52E cells induced with TGF-β1. Targeting LSD1 also decreased the expression of Snail family transcriptional repressor 1 (Snail-1) and its interaction with LSD1 in UUO kidneys and in NRK-52E cells treated with TGF-β1. In addition, we identified a novel LSD1-14-3-3ζ-PKCα axis in the regulation of the activation of AKT and Stat3 and then the activation of fibroblasts. This study suggests that LSD1 plays a critical role in regulation of renal EMT and fibrosis through activation of diverse signaling pathways and places an emphasis that LSD1 has potential as a therapeutic target for the treatment of renal fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W4200174206,"Contactins (CNTNs) are neural cell adhesion molecules that encode axon-target specificity during the patterning of the vertebrate visual and olfactory systems. Because CNTNs are tethered to the plasma membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, they lack an intracellular region to communicate across the membrane. Instead, they form coreceptor complexes with distinct transmembrane proteins to transmit signals inside the cell. In particular, a complex of CNTN4 and amyloid precursor protein (APP) is known to guide the assembly of specific circuits in the visual system. Here, using in situ hybridization in zebrafish embryos, we show that CNTN4, CNTN5, and the APP homologs, amyloid beta precursor like protein 1 and amyloid beta precursor like protein 2, are expressed in olfactory pits, suggesting that these receptors may also function together in the organization of olfactory tissues. Furthermore, we use biochemical and structural approaches to characterize interactions between members of these two receptor families. In particular, APP and amyloid beta precursor like protein 1 interact with CNTN3-5, whereas amyloid beta precursor like protein 2 only binds to CNTN4 and CNTN5. Finally, structural analyses of five CNTN-amyloid pairs indicate that these proteins interact through a conserved interface involving the second fibronectin type III repeat of CNTNs and the copper-binding domain of amyloid proteins. Overall, this work sets the stage for analyzing CNTN-amyloid-mediated connectivity in vertebrate sensory circuits."
https://openalex.org/W4200262590,"The autotrophic acetogen Clostridium ljungdahlii has emerged as a major candidate in the biological conversion of one-carbon gases (CO2/CO) to bulk chemicals and fuels. Nevertheless, the regulatory pathways and downstream metabolic changes responsible for product formation and distribution in this bacterium remain minimally explored. Protein lysine acetylation (PLA), a prevalent posttranslational modification, controls numerous crucial cellular functions. Herein, we revealed a novel cross-regulatory mechanism that uses both the PLA system and transcription factors to regulate the carbon flow distribution for product formation in C. ljungdahlii. The dominant acetylation/deacetylation system (At2/Dat1) in C. ljungdahlii was found to regulate the ratio of two major products, acetic acid and ethanol. Subsequent genetic and biochemical analyses revealed that the activities of Pta and AdhE1, two crucial enzymes responsible for acetic acid and ethanol synthesis, respectively, were greatly affected by their levels of PLA. We found that the acetylation statuses of Pta and AdhE1 underwent significant dynamic changes during the fermentation process, leading to differential synthesis of acetic acid and ethanol. Furthermore, the crucial redox-sensing protein Rex was shown to be regulated by PLA, which subsequently altered its transcriptional regulation on genes responsible for acetic acid and ethanol formation and distribution. Based on our understanding of this cross-regulatory module, we optimized the ethanol synthetic pathway by modifying the acetylation status (deacetylation-mimicked mutations of crucial lysine residues) of the related key enzyme, achieving significantly increased titer and yield of ethanol, an important chemical and fuel, by C. ljungdahlii in gas fermentation."
https://openalex.org/W4200496834,"RNA-binding protein RBM28 (RBM28), as a nucleolar component of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, is involved in the nucleolar stress response. Whether and how RBM28 regulates tumor progression remains unclear. Here, we report that RBM28 is frequently overexpressed in various types of cancer and that its upregulation is associated with a poor prognosis. Functional and mechanistic assays revealed that RBM28 promotes the survival and growth of cancer cells by interacting with the DNA-binding domain of tumor suppressor p53 to inhibit p53 transcriptional activity. Upon treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs (e.g., adriamycin), RBM28 is translocated from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm, which is likely mediated via phosphorylation of RBM28 at Ser122 by DNA checkpoint kinases 1 and 2 (Chk1/2), indicating that RBM28 may act as a nucleolar stress sensor in response to DNA damage stress. Our findings not only reveal RBM28 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for cancers but also provide mechanistic insights into how cancer cells convert stress signals into a cellular response linking the nucleolus to regulation of the tumor suppressor p53.

Our findings not only reveal RBM28 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for cancers but also provide mechanistic insights into how cancer cells convert stress signals into a cellular response linking the nucleolus to regulation of the tumor suppressor p53. The nucleolus is associated with the regulation of several major physiological cellular processes including ribosome assembly, cell mitosis, stress responses, and ribonucleoprotein complex generation (1Nousbeck J.

Recent landmark proteomic studies have led to the discovery of more than 4500 nucleolus-associated proteins, and 70% of nucleolar proteins have functions unrelated to the production of ribosome subunits, including the regulation of cell cycle progression, DNA damage sensing and repair, genomic organization, nuclear architecture establishment, and global gene expression, suggesting that nucleolar functions might be significantly broader than previously thought (2Orsolic I. Jurada D. Pullen N. Oren M. Eliopoulos A.G. Volarevic S. The relationship between the nucleolus and cancer: Current evidence and emerging paradigms.Semin. Cancer Biol. 2016; 37-38: 36-50Google Scholar). Recently, the nucleolus has gained attention for its novel role in the regulation of cellular stress (3Liu Y. Deisenroth C. Zhang Y. RP–MDM2–p53 pathway: Linking ribosomal biogenesis and tumor surveillance.Trends Cancer. 2016; 2: 191-204Google Scholar). Nucleolar stress is emerging as a new concept and is characterized by various stressor-induced impairments in nucleolar morphology and function that ultimately lead to disturbances in cell homeostasis through the activation of p53 or other stress signaling pathways (4Yang K. Yang J. Yi J. Nucleolar stress: Hallmarks, sensing mechanism and diseases.Cell Stress. 2018; 2: 125-140Google Scholar). The following elements are described as hallmarks of nucleolar stress: a wide range of stimuli as stressors cause disturbances in ribosome biogenesis, nucleoplasmic translocation of nucleolar proteins, morphological alterations in nucleolar stress, impaired rRNA transcription and processing, and activation of p53 signaling and involvement of p53-independent stress signaling (4Yang K. Yang J. Yi J. Nucleolar stress: Hallmarks, sensing mechanism and diseases.Cell Stress. 2018; 2: 125-140Google Scholar). Theoretically, nucleoli do not possess defined structural barriers and thus may not have a system akin to nuclear transport machinery (such as importins, a nuclear pore complex, and exportins); proteins that localize to nucleoli can potentially traffic in and out of the nucleolus in a relatively free manner (5Kodiha M. Banski P. Stochaj U. Computer-based fluorescence quantification: A novel approach to study nucleolar biology.BMC Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 25Google Scholar). Present studies have shown that the translocation of nucleolar proteins in nucleolar stress signaling mainly relies on specific interactions with binding sites within nucleolar components, which raises the question of the identity of the molecular mechanism involved in protein nucleolar targeting. Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of nucleolar proteins are also speculated to play a major role in stress-induced changes in protein localization. For instance, during nucleolar oxidation, NPM1 undergoes S-glutathionylation on cysteine 275, which triggers the dissociation of NPM1 from nucleolar nucleic acids, resulting in the nucleoplasmic translocation and activation of p53 (6Yang K.

RBPs are highly conserved across species and play key roles in maintaining gene expression homeostasis. Mounting evidence has shown that RBPs are involved in various important cellular processes, such as cell transport, localization, differentiation, and metabolism by regulating RNA splicing, polyadenylation, mRNA stability, mRNA localization, and translation through interactions with coding and noncoding RNAs and other proteins (7Qin H.

Recent studies also found that RBPs have some nontraditional functions, such as participating in gene transcription regulation and acting as sensors for cellular stress signals through p53 activation (3Liu Y. Deisenroth C. Zhang Y. RP–MDM2–p53 pathway: Linking ribosomal biogenesis and tumor surveillance.Trends Cancer. 2016; 2: 191-204Google Scholar, 8Xiao R. Chen J.-Y. Liang Z. Luo D. Chen G. Lu Z.J. Chen Y. Zhou B. Li H. Du X. Yang Y. San M. Wei X. Liu W. Lécuyer E. et al.Pervasive chromatin-RNA binding protein interactions enable RNA-based regulation of transcription.Cell. 2019; 178: 107-121.e18Google Scholar). Several studies have provided evidence to link known cancer drivers to abnormal expression or altered activity of RBPs; however, the extent to which RBPs act on cancer progression remains unclear, and further exploration of RBP functions and their regulatory networks may provide new molecular targets for cancer therapy. RBPs are well documented to be subjected to a variety of PTMs including acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation, and ubiquitination (9Pereira B. Billaud M. Almeida R. RNA-binding proteins in cancer: Old players and new actors.Trends Cancer. 2017; 3: 506-528Google Scholar). PTMs alter RBP binding properties, functions, or subcellular localization. Notably, the PTMs of RNA-binding elements in RBPs are particularly prominent (7Qin H. Ni H.W. Liu Y.C. Yuan Y.Q. Xi T. Li X.M. Zheng L.F. RNA-binding proteins in tumor progression.J. Hematol. Oncol. 2020; 13: 90Google Scholar). Abnormal modification of these sites may be one of the main factors leading to RBP dysfunction in tumors (7Qin H. Ni H.W. Liu Y.C. Yuan Y.Q. Xi T. Li X.M. Zheng L.F. RNA-binding proteins in tumor progression.J. Hematol. Oncol. 2020; 13: 90Google Scholar), and many studies have shown that abnormal expression or mutation in the RNA- binding motif family plays a very important role in the occurrence and metastasis of tumors (10Sutherland L.C. Rintala-Maki N.D. White R.D. Morin C.D. RNA binding motif (RBM) proteins: A novel family of apoptosis modulators?.J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 94: 5-24Google Scholar). For example, RBM10 activates key proliferative signaling pathways, including the epidermal growth factor receptor, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway and inhibits apoptotic pathways in lung adenocarcinoma (11Sun X.N. Jia M.Q. Sun W. Feng L. Gu C.D. Wu T.H. Functional role of RBM10 in lung adenocarcinoma proliferation.Int. J. Oncol. 2019; 54: 467-478Google Scholar). RBM14 promotes radioresistance in glioblastoma by regulating DNA damage repair and cell differentiation (12Yuan M. Eberhart C.G. Kai M. RNA binding protein RBM14 promotes radio-resistance in glioblastoma by regulating DNA repair and cell differentiation.Oncotarget. 2014; 5: 2820-2826Google Scholar). RBM28, as a nucleolar component of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) may also play roles in cancer progression by involving in the nucleolar stress response. According to bioinformatics analysis, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma share common splicing alterations, nearly half of which are associated with RBM28 (13Sebestyen E. Singh B. Minana B. Pages A. Mateo F. Pujana M.A. Valcarcel J. Eyras E. Large-scale analysis of genome and transcriptome alterations in multiple tumors unveils novel cancer-relevant splicing networks.Genome Res. 2016; 26: 732-744Google Scholar). The binding motifs of RBM28 were significantly enriched in the 3′UTR of nonsmall cell lung cancer patient’s platelet RNAs (14Best M.G. Sol N. In 't Veld S.G.J.G. Vancura A. Muller M. Niemeijer A.L.N. Fejes A.V. Fat L.A.T.K. In 't Veld A.E.H. Leurs C. Le Large T.Y. Meijer L.L. Kooi I.E. Rustenburg F. Schellen P. et al.Swarm intelligence-enhanced detection of non-small-cell lung cancer using tumor-educated platelets.Cancer Cell. 2017; 32: 238-252Google Scholar). However, whether and how RBM28 regulates tumor progression remain unclear. In this report, we found that Chk1 and Chk2 phosphorylate RBM28 at S122 upon DNA damage, promoting RBM28 nucleolar–nucleoplasmic translocation, where RBM28 directly binds to p53 to suppress the transcriptional activity of p53. To explore the potential cancer driver genes in the RNA-binding motif family, we analyzed gene dependency scores in 903 cancer cell lines from the DepMap database and found that RBM28 is one of the highest cancer-dependent genes (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, as shown in the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium proteome database, RBM28 protein levels were upregulated in a variety of cancers, such as colon cancer, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and lung adenocarcinoma (Fig. 1B). According to The Cancer Genome Atlas transcriptome data and patient survival information, a high mRNA level of RBM28 was associated with a poor prognosis in multiple cancer types, including breast cancer, uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and all types of sarcomas (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that RBM28 may act as an oncogene in various cancers. To investigate the role of RBM28 in cancer progression, we constructed constitutive HCT116 and U2OS cell lines with RBM28 KO using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. The knockout efficiency was determined by Western blot (Fig. 2A). According to 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and colony formation assay, RBM28 KO significantly reduced the proliferation of both HCT116 and U2OS cells (Fig. 2, B and C). More importantly, RBM28 KO significantly reduced the growth of subcutaneous tumors, as determined using xenografts of HCT116 cells in mice (Fig. 2, D and F), which was supported by the finding that RBM28 KO decreased the cell proliferation index, determined by Ki-67 immunohistochemistry staining using these xenografts (Fig. 2G). These results indicated that RBM28 plays a crucial role in the growth of cancer cells. Next, we explored how RBM28 promotes cell proliferation. We conducted an RNA-seq in RBM28 KO U2OS cells, which identified 1525 different expression genes, with 1003 upregulated and 522 downregulated. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that p53-related pathways were significantly enriched in RBM28 KO cells versus control cells (Fig. 3A). A representative heatmap from global comparative transcriptome analysis indicated that p53 target genes were upregulated upon RBM28 KO (Fig. 3B). These results were validated by our qPCR results, showing that RBM28 depletion and ectopic RBM28 increased and decreased the expression of CDKN1A, FAS, GADD45A, and SERPINE1, respectively (Fig. 3, C and D). We further confirmed the effect of RBM28 on p53 using CDKN1A as the representative. According to dual luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, RBM28 depletion increased CDKN1A promoter activity and the binding of p53 to the CDKN1A promoter in U2OS cells (Fig. 3, E and F). More importantly, p21, which is the protein product encoded by CDKN1A was upregulated in p53 WT cells but not p53 null cells, suggesting that the effect of RBM28 on p53 target genes was p53-dependent (Fig. 3G). Collectively, these results suggested that RBM28 may impair the transcriptional activity of p53 by reducing the binding of p53 to its target gene promoters. In addition, reduction in the colony formation by depletion of RBM28 was weaker in HCT116 p53−/− cells than that in HCT116 p53+/+ cells, as shown in Fig. S1, indicating that RBM28 has other downstream effectors besides p53. This is consistent with the DepMap data results that RBM28 is required for cancer proliferation both in p53 WT and mutant cell lines, as shown in Fig. S2. Together, these results indicated that p53 is one of the downstream effectors of RBM28 to maintain cell proliferation. Upon DNA damage, acetylation at Lys382 and phosphorylation at Ser15 are critical events in p53 activation (15Zhao Y. Lu S.L. Wu L.P. Chai G.L. Wang H.Y. Chen Y.Q. Sun J. Yu Y. Zhou W. Zheng Q.H. Wu M. Otterson G.A. Zhu W.G. Acetylation of p53 at lysine 373/382 by the histone deacetylase inhibitor depsipeptide induces expression of p21(Waf1/Cip1).Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2782-2790Google Scholar, 16Sabapathy K. Lane D.P. Understanding p53 functions through p53 antibodies.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2019; 11: 317-329Google Scholar). However, depletion of RBM28 did not affect p53 acetylation at Lys382, phosphorylation at Ser15, or the total p53 level with or without adriamycin (ADR) treatment (Fig. S3). RBM28 KO did not affect the half-life of CDKN1A mRNA (Fig. S4). Given that RBM28 may impair the transcriptional activity of p53 by reducing the binding of p53 to its target gene promoters, as shown above (Fig. 3, E and F), we surmised that RBM28 may bind to p53. Indeed, RBM28 interacts with p53 at their endogenous levels (Fig. 4A), and this interaction using exogenous RBM28 and p53 was not affected by the RNase A treatment, indicating that the interaction of RBM28 with p53 is RNA-independent (Fig. 4B). Next, we attempted to determine the regions responsible for the interaction between RBM28 and p53. A series of fragments of p53 and RBM28 were generated, and coimmunoprecipitation was performed (Fig. S5, A and B). The DNA-binding domain of p53 (residues 100–300) was necessary and sufficient to bind to RBM28 (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, three separate regions of RBM28, residues 1 to 95, 96 to 258, and 468 to 759, could interact with p53 (Fig. 4D). We further generated several mutants of RBM28 by depleting different regions (Fig. S5C). The interaction between RBM28 and p53 was not diminished by truncation of any particular region (Fig. 4E). These results revealed that RBM28 may interact with the DNA-binding domain of p53 through multiple regions. The nucleolus is considered a major hub in coordination of the stress response (17Boulon S. Westman B.J. Hutten S. Boisvert F.-M. Lamond A.I. The nucleolus under stress.Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 216-227Google Scholar). Nucleolar stress causes many nucleolar molecules to redistribute in the nucleus, that is, to be released from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm (4Yang K. Yang J. Yi J. Nucleolar stress: Hallmarks, sensing mechanism and diseases.Cell Stress. 2018; 2: 125-140Google Scholar). Given that RBM28 is a nucleolar protein (Fig. S6) whereas p53 serves as a transcription factor in the nucleoplasm, we speculated whether RBM28 might undergo nucleolar–nucleoplasmic translocation upon cellular stress. After applying a series of stressors, as shown in Figure 5A, we found that nucleoplasmic localization of RBM28 significantly increased upon treatment with DNA-damaging agents commonly used in cancer chemotherapy, such as ADR, camptothecin, actinomycin D (ActD), and etoposide (18Cheung-Ong K. Giaever G. Nislow C. DNA-damaging agents in cancer chemotherapy: Serendipity and chemical biology.Chem. Biol. 2013; 20: 648-659Google Scholar, 19Rao B. Lain S. Thompson A.M. p53-based cyclotherapy: Exploiting the 'guardian of the genome' to protect normal cells from cytotoxic therapy.Br. J. Cancer. 2013; 109: 2954-2958Google Scholar). The DNA damage induced by each agent was determined by the detection of γH2AX expression (Fig. 5B). In response to the ADR treatment, ectopic RBM28-mCherry was distributed throughout the nucleoplasm, where it partially colocalized with GFP-p53 (Fig. 5C). Meanwhile, the proximity labeling assay showed that the binding of p53 and RBM28 was increased in response to ADR in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5D). These findings revealed that RBM28 translocated from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm, where it interacts with p53, upon DNA-damaging agent treatment. The DNA damage response is a signal transduction pathway involved in many processes of kinase cascade activation (20Ciccia A. Elledge S.J. The DNA damage response: Making it safe to play with knives.Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 179-204Google Scholar), reflecting the possibility that RBM28 is regulated by some key molecules through posttranslational modification in the DNA damage pathway. Both an ATM inhibitor (AZD1390) and a Chk1 inhibitor (LY2606368) reduced nucleoplasmic localization of RBM28 in HCT116 cells upon ADR treatment (Fig. 5E). Likewise, siRNAs targeting both Chk1 and Chk2 also impeded nucleoplasmic localization of RBM28 in HCT116 cells upon ADR treatment (Fig. 5, F and G), as AZD1390 and LY2606368 could also suppress the activity of both Chk1 and Chk2 (21Jin M.H. Oha D.Y. ATM in DNA repair in cancer.Pharmacol. Ther. 2019; 203: 107391Google Scholar), indicating that Chk1/Chk2 promote the nucleolar–nucleoplasmic translocation of RBM28 induced by ADR. Then, we analyzed the amino acid sequence of RBM28 and found three potential Chk1/Chk2 phosphorylation sites, namely, Thr86 (T86), Ser122 (S122), and Ser343 (S343), according to a phosphorylation prediction tool called the Grouped-based Prediction System (GPS5.0) (22Wang C.W. Xu H.D. Lin S.F. Deng W.K. Zhou J.Q. Zhang Y. Shi Y. Peng D. Xue Y. GPS 5.0: An update on the prediction of kinase-specific phosphorylation sites in proteins.Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics. 2020; 18: 72-80Google Scholar). Phospho-defective mutants (S/T to A) and phospho-mimetic mutants (S/T to D) of these putative phosphorylation sites were generated. Interestingly, only the RBM28 S122A mutant was predominantly localized in the nucleolus, whereas other mutants were distributed throughout the nucleus (Fig. 6A), indicating that the phosphorylation status of RBM28 at S122 may be crucial to determine the subcellular localization of RBM28. Indeed, using anti-phospho-S/T Chk1/Chk2 substrate antibody, the phosphorylation of WT RBM28 was enhanced when cotransfected with HA-Chk1 or HA-Chk2 (Fig. 6B), and only the S122A mutant diminished the Chk1/Chk2-induced phosphorylation of RBM28 (Fig. 6C), demonstrating that S122 is the key site for phosphorylation by Chk1/Chk2. Notably, S122 status did not affect the interaction of RBM28 with Chk1/Chk2 (Fig. S7). Furthermore, we generated a specific anti-phospho-Ser122 (p-S122) antibody and found that S122 phosphorylation of RBM28 was dramatically increased by either Chk1 or Chk2 in cells transiently cotransfected with their plasmids (Fig. 6D). More importantly, ADR treatment was found to increase RBM28-S122 phosphorylation (Fig. 6E) using an anti-p-S122 antibody. Immunofluorescence assay showed that the nucleoplasmic localization of WT RBM28, but not the RBM28 S122A mutant, was increased upon cotransfection with either HA-Chk1 or HA-Chk2 (Fig. 6F), whereas the RBM28 S122A mutant prevented the nucleoplasmic localization of RBM28 induced by ADR (Fig. 6G). These results revealed that Chk1/Chk2 may phosphorylate S122 of RBM28 to induce nucleolar–nucleoplasmic translocation of RBM28 upon ADR treatment. In this report, as illustrated in Figure 7, chemotherapeutic drugs (e.g., ADR) could activate Chk1/2 to phosphorylate S122 of RBM28, promoting the translocation of RBM28 from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm, where RBM28 interacts with the DNA-binding domain of p53 to inhibit p53 transcriptional activity. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into how cancer cells convert stress signals into a cellular response linking the nucleolus to regulation of the tumor suppressor p53. As a nucleolar component of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), RBM28 is involved in snRNP maturation and comprises four RNA recognition motifs (RRMs 1–4) and an extremely acidic region of 32 amino acids between RRM2 and RRM3 (23Damianov A. Kann M. Lane W.S. Bindereif A. Human RBM28 protein is a specific nucleolar component of the spliceosomal snRNPs.Biol. Chem. 2006; 387: 1455-1460Google Scholar). A homozygous loss-of function mutation in RBM28 was reported to underlie alopecia, neurological defects, and endocrinopathy syndrome (1Nousbeck J. Spiegel R. Ishida-Yamamoto A. Indelman M. Shani-Adir A. Adir N. Lipkin E. Bercovici S. Geiger D. van Steensel M.A. Steijlen P.M. Bergman R. Bindereif A. Choder M. Shalev S. et al.Alopecia, neurological defects, and endocrinopathy syndrome caused by decreased expression of RBM28, a nucleolar protein associated with ribosome biogenesis.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2008; 82: 1114-1121Google Scholar, 24Spiegel R. Shalev S.A. Adawi A. Sprecher E. Tenenbaum-Rakover Y. ANE syndrome caused by mutated RBM28 gene: A novel etiology of combined pituitary hormone deficiency.Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2010; 162: 1021-1025Google Scholar). A deleterious mutation in the RRM3 domain of Nop4p, its yeast ortholog, was found to confer growth and pre-rRNA processing defects, suggesting a role for RBM28 in ribosome biogenesis (25McCann K.L. Teramoto T. Zhang J. Tanaka Hall T.M. Baserga S.J. The molecular basis for ANE syndrome revealed by the large ribosomal subunit processome interactome.Elife. 2016; 5e16381Google Scholar). Here, we determined for the first time that RBM28 may act as an oncogene to promote growth of cancer cells, as RBM28 depletion significantly activates the p53 pathway and inhibits cancer cell survival and growth, and that high RBM28 expression predicts a poor prognosis in cancer patients. These findings indicate that RBM28 may be a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for cancers. Links between the nucleolus and cellular stress were proposed based on the finding that the nucleolus participates in regulating the abundance of stress-responsive p53 (4Yang K. Yang J. Yi J. Nucleolar stress: Hallmarks, sensing mechanism and diseases.Cell Stress. 2018; 2: 125-140Google Scholar). The notion that the nucleolus plays a role in regulating cellular stress represents at least two aspects of the same idea: p53 activation by nucleolar proteins. One hypothesis emphasizes mechanisms mainly involved in changes in the protein–protein interactions, in which the nucleolus is a sensor for cellular stress, with stress-induced nucleoplasmic translocation of nucleolar proteins, such as NPM1 and GLTSCR2, initiating p53 activation (6Yang K. Wang M. Zhao Y.Z. Sun X.X. Yang Y. Li X. Zhou A.W. Chu H.L. Zhou H. Xu J.R. Wu M. Yang J. Yi J. A redox mechanism underlying nucleolar stress sensing by nucleophosmin.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 13599Google Scholar, 26Lee S. Kim J.Y. Kim Y.J. Seok K.O. Kim J.H. Chang Y.J. Kang H.Y. Park J.H. Nucleolar protein GLTSCR2 stabilizes p53 in response to ribosomal stresses.Cell Death Differ. 2012; 19: 1613-1622Google Scholar). The other hypothesis focuses on a translation-mediated mechanism, where the engagement of ribosomal proteins (RPs), mainly RPL5, RPL11, and RPL23, is implicated in increased mRNA translation, with less emphasis on their translocation (27Golomb L. Volarevic S. Oren M. p53 and ribosome biogenesis stress: The essentials.FEBS Lett. 2014; 588: 2571-2579Google Scholar). In this report, upon nucleolar stress, such as the ADR treatment, we uncovered a novel repressive mechanism of RBM28 on p53 activity, where RBM28 is translocated to the nucleoplasm from the nucleolus, which is mediated by phosphorylation of RBM28 at S122 by Chk1/Chk2. These findings indicate that RBM28 may act as a nucleolar stress sensor in response to DNA damage stress. p53, as the “guardian of the genome”, is an established tumor suppressor gene that activates the transcription of multiple target genes (28Lane D.P. p53, guardian of the genome.Nature. 1992; 358: 15-16Google Scholar). The most common and well-characterized TP53 mutations are missense mutations in the DNA-binding domain, implying that this feature of p53 is crucial for tumor suppression (29Giacomelli A.O. Yang X.P. Lintner R.E. McFarland J.M. Duby M. Kim J. Howard T.P. Takeda D.Y. Ly S.H. Kim E. Gannon H.S. Hurhula B. Sharpe T. Goodale A. Fritchman B. et al.Mutational processes shape the landscape of TP53 mutations in human cancer.Nat. Genet. 2018; 50: 1381-1387Google Scholar). In this study, we found that nucleoplasmic translocation of RBM28 is essential for its binding to p53, which could be induced by chemotherapeutic drugs (e.g., ADR). This finding may provide a novel explanation for WT p53 cancer cells’ greater resistance to chemotherapy. Therefore, some compounds that disrupt the RBM28–p53 interaction may be used to increase the sensitivity of cancer cells with WT p53 to chemotherapy. Notably, Chk1 has been proposed as an attractive target in p53-deficient tumors but not WT p53 cancers, because p53 can partially compensate for the loss of Chk1-mediated cell cycle regulation (30Ferrao P.T. Bukczynska E.P. Johnstone R.W. McArthur G.A. Efficacy of CHK inhibitors as single agents in MYC-driven lymphoma cells.Oncogene. 2012; 31: 1661-1672Google Scholar, 31Chen Z.H. Xiao Z. Gul W.Z. Xue J. Bui M.H. Kovar P. Li G.Q. Wang G. Tao Z.F. Tong Y.S. Lin N.H. Sham H.L. Wang J.Y.J. Sowin T.J. Rosenberg S.H. et al.Selective Chk1 inhibitors differentially sensitize p53-deficient cancer cells to cancer therapeutics.Int. J. Cancer. 2006; 119: 2784-2794Google Scholar). Here, we found that a Chk1 inhibitor (LY2606368) could block the translocation of RBM28 from the nucleolar to the nucleoplasm, which in turn leads to lack the inhibition of RBM28 on p53. In this situation, cancer cells with higher RBM28 levels may be more sensitive to Chk1 inhibitors, suggesting that RBM28 may serve as a useful biomarker for predicting Chk1/Chk2 inhibitors sensitivity in cancer patients with WT p53. The following reagents were used for cells: MG132 (Selleck; S2619), AZD1390 (Selleck; S8680), LY2606368 (Selleck; S7178), ADR (Selleck, S1208), ActD (APExbio, A4448), etoposide (Selleck; S1225), and camptothecin (Selleck; S1288). The human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293T), U2OS, HCT116, A375, and SaOS2 were obtained from ATCC, HCT116 p53−/− cells were from Dr Yuxin Yin (Peking University Health Science Center), and all the cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’ medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies) with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. All cell lines used in this study were authenticated using short-tandem repeat profiling less than 6 months prior when this project was initiated, and the cells were not cultured for more than 2 months. The cells were negative for mycoplasma and tested by PCR monthly. HA-Chk1, HA-Chk2, Myc-p53, HA-p53, and related truncation constructs were cloned into a pCDNA3.1 vector. SFB-RBM28, the related truncation constructs, and S/T to A/D mutants were cloned into a pSIN vector through infusion. Sequences targeting RBM28 were cloned into a lenti-CRISPR V2 plasmid (Addgene, 52961). The shRNA expression constructs were in the pLKO.1-puro backbone. Chk1 and Chk2 siRNAs were synthesized by RiboBio. Transfection was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent (Invitrogen) and 50 nM siRNA. Transient transfection of HEK293T cells was performed with PEI (25 kDa), and the cells were collected after 48 h for subsequent assay and lentiviral packaging. The siRNAs used for RT–PCR are listed in Table S1. Stable HCT116 and U2OS cells were seeded at a density of 500 per well in 6-well plates. After 2 weeks, the cell clones were fixed in methanol and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Cell clones containing more than 50 cells were counted. Immunohistochemistry staining was performed using 3 μm sections. The primary antibodies against Ki-67 were diluted 1:400 and then incubated at 4 °C overnight in a humidified container. After three washes with PBS, the tissue slides were treated with a nonbiotin horseradish peroxidase detection system according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Dako). For Western blot analysis, the cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.5% NP-40) containing protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Thermo Scientific). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The cleared lysates were incubated with antibody beads or agarose overnight at 4 °C or with antibodies at 4 °C for 2 h followed by incubation with protein A/G PLUS-Agarose (Santa Cruz) at 4 °C for 2 h. Precipitates were then washed five times with cold RIPA buffer and eluted with 5× SDS sample buffer. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS–PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore). The membranes were blocked in TBS containing 5% nonfat milk and 0.1% Tween-20, probed with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, washed five times with TBS containing 5% nonfat milk and 0.1% Tween-20, and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Promega). Clarity Western ECL substrate (Bio–Rad) was used for detection. Stable HCT116 and U2OS cells were seeded in 96-well microplates at a density of 2000 cells per well, and 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay was used to assess cell viability per day for five continuous days. Cells were seeded into confocal dishes (NEST Biotechnology) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. After permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min, the cells were blocked with 5% goat serum and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. The next day, the cells were washed and incubated with secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h, and then the nuclei were labeled by using Hoechst 33342 for 5 min. Briefly, HCT116 and U2OS cells were plated in 24-well plates and then transiently transfected with 250 ng CDKN1A promoter containing Firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega E1330). To normalize the transfection efficiency, the cells were also cotransfected with 8 ng of pRL-TK (Renilla luciferase). Luciferase activity was measured in at least three independent experiments using a Dual-Luciferase Assay kit (Promega) after transfection for 48 h. This procedure was performed, as described by the ChIP kit (Millipore, 17–10085 & 17–1008). Briefly, 15-cm plates were seeded with cells of each of the tested cell lines and allowed to grow to 70% to 80% confluence. To fix cells, complete cell fixative solution (1/10th the volume of the growth medium volume) was added to the existing culture medium. The fixation reaction was stopped by adding stop solution (1/20th the volume of the growth medium volume) to the existing culture medium. The cells were collected by centrifugation, and the nuclear pellet was resuspended in ChIP buffer. The cell lysate was subjected to sonication and then incubated with 3 μg of antibodies overnight, followed by incubation with protein A/G agarose overnight at 4 °C. Bound DNA-protein complexes were eluted, and cross-links were reversed after a series of washes. The purified DNA was resuspended in TE buffer for PCR. The primers for the indicated promoters are shown in Table S1. Total RNA was extracted from the samples (RNAprep pure cell/bacteria kit; TIANGEN), quantified by using a Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer, and stored at −80 °C. One microgram of RNA was reverse transcribed using a HiScript II first Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Vazyme) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. The transcripts were quantified by real-time qPCR using a LightCycler 480 instrument (Roche Diagnostics) and ChamQ SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Animal studies were approved by the Animal Research Committee of Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. Male athymic BALB/C nude mice (4 weeks old) were obtained from NBRI of Nanjing University. Briefly, 4 × 106 HCT116 cells were resuspended in 0.1 ml of PBS and subcutaneously injected into the flanks of the mice. Tumor volumes were measured twice a week and were calculated using the formula V = 0.5 × length × width2. All mice were sacrificed 19 days after injection, and the xenograft tumors were isolated, photographed, and weighed. To determine the CDKN1A mRNA half-life, RBM28-KO U2OS cells were incubated with ActD (5 μg/ml) and then collected at the indicated times. Total RNA was extracted by an RNAprep pure cell/bacteria kit (TIANGEN) and analyzed by RT-PCR. All statistical experiments were performed independently and in triplicate. Statistical analysis was carried out using GraphPad Prism software (version 8.0 for Windows). Two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test was performed between two groups. The survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method and analyzed by the log-rank test. Tumor growth for different groups was analyzed by two-way ANOVA. The data are the mean ± SD.

https://openalex.org/W4200290690,"Vietnam is one the most vulnerable region to climate change and extreme climatic events, such as flash floods and droughts. This present research aims to explore the farm households' beliefs, risk perception, adaptive attitude and climate change adaptation measures that they currently utilize in their farms to cope with climatic risks. Further, this study analyzed effect of climate change belief, awareness and adaptive attitudes on farmers' adaptive behavior. By using structured questionnaire, the data from 816 respondents were collected from seven provinces of Vietnam. We used ordinary least squares regression and logistic regression approach to analyze farmers' belief, perception of climatic change, and risk attitude towards climatic hazards. Results revealed that farmers in the study area are using the most common climatic risk management strategies including applying new technologies, adjustment of the seasonal calendar, and diversification. Findings further revealed that that farm households were mostly concerned about the risk in soil erosion and washout, followed by the stress of prolonging dry season and droughts. The study participants also reported a decrease in precipitation and increase in temperature and frequency and incidence of other extreme climatic events. A positive significant relationship was found between farm management practices and ecological communities. Risk perceptions and attitude toward climate change are essential factors among farm households of northern mountains of Vietnam. Thus, the climate strain linked with the institutional stress and socio-economic has serious insinuations for farm households' livelihood bases, a universal climate change adaptation scheme is required to endure farmers' livelihood."
https://openalex.org/W4200464529,"The objective of this retrospective cohort study was to describe pre-treatment characteristics, treatment patterns, health resource use, and clinical outcomes among adults hospitalized with COVID-19 in the United States (US) who initiated common treatments for COVID-19. The Optum® COVID-19 electronic health records database was used to identify patients >18 years, diagnosed with COVID-19, who were admitted to an inpatient setting and received treatments of interest for COVID-19 between September 2020 and January 2021. Patients were stratified into cohorts based on index treatment use. Patient demographics, medical history, care setting, medical procedures, subsequent treatment use, patient disposition, clinical improvement, and outcomes were summarized descriptively. Among a total of 26,192 patients identified, the most prevalent treatments initiated were dexamethasone (35.4%) and dexamethasone + remdesivir (14.9%), and dexamethasone was the most common subsequent treatment. At day 14 post-index, <10% of patients received any treatments of interest. Mean (standard deviation [SD]) patient age was 65.6 (15.6) years, and the most prevalent comorbidities included hypertension (44.8%), obesity (35.4%), and diabetes (25.7%). At the end of follow-up, patients had a mean (SD) 8.1 (6.6) inpatient days and 1.4 (4.1) days with ICU care. Oxygen supplementation, non-invasive, or invasive ventilation was required by 4.5%, 3.0%, and 3.1% of patients, respectively. At the end of follow-up, 84.2% of patients had evidence of clinical improvement, 3.1% remained hospitalized, 83.8% were discharged, 4% died in hospital, and 9.1% died after discharge. Although the majority of patients were discharged alive, no treatments appeared to alleviate the inpatient morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19. This highlights an unmet need for effective treatment options for patients hospitalized with COVID-19."

Truenat assays (MTB, MTB Plus, and MTB-RIF Dx) are new TB molecular diagnostic tools for the detection of TB and Rifampicin (RIF)-resistance from sputum samples. The diagnostic accuracy of the assays is needed prior to implementation in clinical use in Ethiopia. This study aimed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of Truenat assays; and aimed to compare the assays to the Xpert MTB/RIF assay.A prospective evaluation study was conducted among 200 presumptive TB patients in microscopy centers in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia from May 2019 to December 2020. Culture (Solid and Liquid methods) and phenotypic (liquid method) drug susceptibility testing (DST) were used as a reference standard.Of 200 adult participants, culture confirmed TB cases were 25 (12.5%), and only one isolate was resistant to RIF by phenotypic DST. The sensitivity of Truenat MTB was 88.0% [95% CI 70.1, 95.8], while 91.7 [95% CI 74.2, 97.7] for Truenat MTB Plus at the microscopy centers. The specificity of Truenat MTB was 97.2% [95% CI 93.1, 98.9], while for Truenat MTB Plus was 97.2% [95% CI 93.0, 99.0]. The sensitivity of Truenat MTB was 90.5% while for MTB Plus, 100% compared to the Xpert MTB/RIF assay.Truenat assays were found to have high diagnostic accuracy. The assays have the potential to be used as a point of care (POC) TB diagnostic tests."
https://openalex.org/W4200617655,"The human genome contains at least 35 genes that encode Golgi sulfotransferases that function in the secretory pathway, where they are involved in decorating glycosaminoglycans, glycolipids, and glycoproteins with sulfate groups. Although a number of important interactions by proteins such as selectins, galectins, and sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins are thought to mainly rely on sulfated O-glycans, our insight into the sulfotransferases that modify these glycoproteins, and in particular GalNAc-type O-glycoproteins, is limited. Moreover, sulfated mucins appear to accumulate in respiratory diseases, arthritis, and cancer. To explore further the genetic and biosynthetic regulation of sulfated O-glycans, here we expanded a cell-based glycan array in the human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cell line with sulfation capacities. We stably engineered O-glycan sulfation capacities in HEK293 cells by site-directed knockin of sulfotransferase genes in combination with knockout of genes to eliminate endogenous O-glycan branching (core2 synthase gene GCNT1) and/or sialylation capacities in order to provide simplified substrates (core1 Galβ1-3GalNAcα1-O-Ser/Thr) for the introduced sulfotransferases. Expression of the galactose 3-O-sulfotransferase 2 in HEK293 cells resulted in sulfation of core1 and core2 O-glycans, whereas expression of galactose 3-O-sulfotransferase 4 resulted in sulfation of core1 only. We used the engineered cell library to dissect the binding specificity of galectin-4 and confirmed binding to the 3-O-sulfo-core1 O-glycan. This is a first step toward expanding the emerging cell-based glycan arrays with the important sulfation modification for display and production of glycoconjugates with sulfated O-glycans."
https://openalex.org/W4210724679,"This study aimed to investigate the causal relationship between chronic ingestion of a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced secretion of glucocorticoids (GCs) and the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We have produced a strain of transgenic mice (termed L/L mice) that have normal levels of circulating corticosterone (CORT), the major type of GCs in rodents, but unlike wild-type (WT) mice, their circulating CORT was not affected by HFD. Compared to WT mice, 12-week HFD-induced fatty liver was less pronounced with higher plasma levels of triglycerides in L/L mice. These changes were reversed by CORT supplement to L/L mice. By analyzing a sort of lipid metabolism-related proteins, we found that expressions of the hepatic cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) were upregulated by HFD-induced CORT and involved in CORT-mediated fatty liver. Dexamethasone, an agonist of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), upregulated expressions of CD36 in HepG2 hepatocytes and facilitated lipid accumulation in the cells. In conclusion, the fat ingestion-induced release of CORT contributes to NAFLD. This study highlights the pathogenic role of CORT-mediated upregulation of hepatic CD 36 in diet-induced NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W4200264812,"Recent advances in upper limb prosthetics include sensory restoration techniques and osseointegration technology that introduce additional risks, higher costs, and longer periods of rehabilitation. To inform regulatory and clinical decision making, validated patient reported outcome measures are required to understand the relative benefits of these interventions. The Patient Experience Measure (PEM) was developed to quantify psychosocial outcomes for research studies on sensory-enabled upper limb prostheses. While the PEM was responsive to changes in prosthesis experience in prior studies, its psychometric properties had not been assessed. Here, the PEM was examined for structural validity and reliability across a large sample of people with upper limb loss (n = 677). The PEM was modified and tested in three phases: initial refinement and cognitive testing, pilot testing, and field testing. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to discover the underlying factor structure of the PEM items and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) verified the structure. Rasch partial credit modeling evaluated monotonicity, fit, and magnitude of differential item functioning by age, sex, and prosthesis use for all scales. EFA resulted in a seven-factor solution that was reduced to the following six scales after CFA: social interaction, self-efficacy, embodiment, intuitiveness, wellbeing, and self-consciousness. After removal of two items during Rasch analyses, the overall model fit was acceptable (CFI = 0.973, TLI = 0.979, RMSEA = 0.038). The social interaction, self-efficacy and embodiment scales had strong person reliability (0.81, 0.80 and 0.77), Cronbach's alpha (0.90, 0.80 and 0.71), and intraclass correlation coefficients (0.82, 0.85 and 0.74), respectively. The large sample size and use of contemporary measurement methods enabled identification of unidimensional constructs, differential item functioning by participant characteristics, and the rank ordering of the difficulty of each item in the scales. The PEM enables quantification of critical psychosocial impacts of advanced prosthetic technologies and provides a rigorous foundation for future studies of clinical and prosthetic interventions."

https://openalex.org/W4200406441,"Glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit 1 (G6PC1) plays a critical role in hepatic glucose production during fasting by mediating the terminal step of the gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis pathways. In concert with accessory transport proteins, this membrane-integrated enzyme catalyzes glucose production from glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) to support blood glucose homeostasis. Consistent with its metabolic function, dysregulation of G6PC1 gene expression contributes to diabetes, and mutations that impair phosphohydrolase activity form the clinical basis of glycogen storage disease type 1a. Despite its relevance to health and disease, a comprehensive view of G6PC1 structure and mechanism has been limited by the absence of expression and purification strategies that isolate the enzyme in a functional form. In this report, we apply a suite of biophysical and biochemical tools to fingerprint the in vitro attributes of catalytically active G6PC1 solubilized in lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG) detergent micelles. When purified from Sf9 insect cell membranes, the glycosylated mouse ortholog (mG6PC1) recapitulated functional properties observed previously in intact hepatic microsomes and displayed the highest specific activity reported to date. Additionally, our results establish a direct correlation between the catalytic and structural stability of mG6PC1, which is underscored by the enhanced thermostability conferred by phosphatidylcholine and the cholesterol analog cholesteryl hemisuccinate. In contrast, the N96A variant, which blocks N-linked glycosylation, reduced thermostability. The methodologies described here overcome long-standing obstacles in the field and lay the necessary groundwork for a detailed analysis of the mechanistic structural biology of G6PC1 and its role in complex metabolic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W4200474641,"As a first line of defense to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people reduced social contacts to avoid pathogen exposure. Using a panel of countries, this research suggests that this was amplified in societies characterized by high social support and future orientation. People reacted more strongly in dense environments; government orders had more effect in high power distance societies. Conversely, a focus on accomplishments was associated with lower changes. Understanding people's actual behaviors in response to health threats across societies is of great importance for epidemiology, public health, international business, and for the functioning of humanity as a whole."
https://openalex.org/W4200482070,"G6PC2 encodes a glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) catalytic subunit that modulates the sensitivity of insulin secretion to glucose and thereby regulates fasting blood glucose (FBG). A common single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in G6PC2, rs560887 is an important determinant of human FBG variability. This SNP has a subtle effect on G6PC2 RNA splicing, which raises the question as to whether nonsynonymous SNPs with a major impact on G6PC2 stability or enzyme activity might have a broader disease/metabolic impact. Previous attempts to characterize such SNPs were limited by the very low inherent G6Pase activity and expression of G6PC2 protein in islet-derived cell lines. In this study, we describe the use of a plasmid vector that confers high G6PC2 protein expression in islet cells, allowing for a functional analysis of 22 nonsynonymous G6PC2 SNPs, 19 of which alter amino acids that are conserved in mouse G6PC2 and the human and mouse variants of the related G6PC1 isoform. We show that 16 of these SNPs markedly impair G6PC2 protein expression (>50% decrease). These SNPs have variable effects on the stability of human and mouse G6PC1, despite the high sequence homology between these isoforms. Four of the remaining six SNPs impaired G6PC2 enzyme activity. Electronic health record–derived phenotype analyses showed an association between high-impact SNPs and FBG, but not other diseases/metabolites. While homozygous G6pc2 deletion in mice increases the risk of hypoglycemia, these human data reveal no evidence that the beneficial use of partial G6PC2 inhibitors to lower FBG would be associated with unintended negative consequences.

Glucose-6-phosphatase catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) to glucose and inorganic phosphate and is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (1Hutton J.C. O'Brien R.M.

It exists as a multicomponent enzyme system in which a G6P transporter, encoded by the SLC37A4 gene, delivers substrate from the cytosol to the active site of a glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit (G6PC) in the lumen of the ER, with transporters for inorganic phosphate and glucose returning the reaction products back to the cytosol (1Hutton J.C.

Experiments in mice suggest that the nature of the physiological benefits associated with G6PC2 are that it confers a transient, beneficial elevation in FBG during periods of stress (17Boortz K.A.

Metab. 2020; 41: 101043Google Scholar). Previous biobank analyses have confirmed the association between G6PC2 and FBG and have also linked G6PC2 to an altered risk for acute pancreatitis (9Bosma K.J. Rahim M. Singh K. Goleva S.B. Wall M.L. Xia J. Syring K.E. Oeser J.K. Poffenberger G. McGuinness O.P. Means A.L. Powers A.C. Lee W.H. Davis L.K. Young J.D. et al.Pancreatic islet beta cell-specific deletion of G6pc2 reduces fasting blood glucose.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2020; 64: 235-248Google Scholar). However, a caveat with these studies is that they were performed using the rs560887 G6PC2 SNP that has a mild effect on G6PC2 RNA splicing (16Baerenwald D.A. Bonnefond A. Bouatia-Naji N. Flemming B.P. Umunakwe O.C. Oeser J.K. Pound L.D. Conley N.L. Cauchi S. Lobbens S. Eury E. Balkau B. Lantieri O. Dadi P.K. Jacobson D.A. et al.Multiple functional polymorphisms in the G6PC2 gene contribute to the association with higher fasting plasma glucose levels.Diabetologia. 2013; 56: 1306-1316Google Scholar) such that other deleterious consequences of altered G6PC2 expression might have been missed. The present studies addressed that caveat by first identifying nonsynonymous G6PC2 SNPs that have a major effect on G6PC2 protein expression or activity in islet cells and then assessing the impact of these SNPs on human health through biobank analyses. Analyses of the functional effects of nonsynonymous G6PC2 SNPs have been limited by an inability to drive high G6PC2 protein expression in islet-derived cell lines, preventing the detection of G6PC2 enzyme activity in vitro (3Arden S.D. Zahn T. Steegers S. Webb S. Bergman B. O'Brien R.M. Hutton J.C.

To overcome this limitation, we compared the level of human G6PC2 protein expression driven by a number of plasmid vectors in the islet-derived 832/13 cell line (23Hohmeier H.E. Mulder H. Chen G. Henkel-Rieger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B. Isolation of INS-1-derived cell lines with robust ATP-sensitive K+ channel-dependent and -independent glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.Diabetes. 2000; 49: 424-430Google Scholar). Western blotting analyses demonstrated that enhanced expression of G6PC2 protein could be achieved when the human G6PC2 open reading frame (ORF) with a V5 C terminal tag was ligated into the pJPA5 vector (24Doherty J.K. Bond C. Jardim A. Adelman J.P. Clinton G.M. The HER-2/neu receptor tyrosine kinase gene encodes a secreted autoinhibitor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10869-10874Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Under the experimental conditions used, these Western blotting assays were semiquantitative (Fig. 1B) (Fig. S1). The pJPA5 vector contains additional cytomegalovirus (CMV) 5′ untranslated region and linker sequence relative to the pcDNA3.1D vector used in our initial experiments (Fig. S2). In contrast to G6PC2, when the human G6PC1 ORF was ligated into the pJPA5 plasmid, G6PC1 protein expression was only enhanced modestly relative to that achieved with the pcDNA3.1D vector (Fig. 1A). Similar levels of G6PC1 and G6PC2 protein expression were achieved using the pJPA5 vector (Fig. 1A). We previously attempted to circumvent the prior limitations associated with low G6PC2 protein overexpression in islet-derived cell lines by indirectly examining the effects of 22 nonsynonymous G6PC2 SNPs that alter amino acids that are conserved between mouse and human G6PC1 and G6PC2, on mouse G6PC1 protein expression and enzyme activity in 832/13 cells, and/or human G6PC2 protein expression in COS cells (22Boortz K.A. Syring K.E. Pound L.D. Wang Y. Oeser J.K. O'Brien R.M. Functional analysis of mouse G6pc1 mutations using a novel in situ assay for glucose-6-phosphatase activity and the effect of mutations in conserved human G6PC1/G6PC2 amino acids on G6PC2 protein expression.PLoS One. 2016; 11e0162439Google Scholar). This approach exploited the much greater catalytic activity of G6PC1 versus G6PC2 (25Petrolonis A.J. Yang Q. Tummino P.J. Fish S.M. Prack A.E. Jain S. Parsons T.F. Li P. Dales N.A. Ge L. Langston S.P. Schuller A.G. An W.F. Tartaglia L.A. Chen H. et al.Enzymatic characterization of the pancreatic islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase-related protein (IGRP).J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13976-13983Google Scholar), but a major caveat is the fact that G6PC1 and G6PC2 share only 50% sequence identity (Fig. 2), so even mutations of conserved amino acids (AAs) may have differential effects on G6PC1 and G6PC2 activity and stability. In addition, COS cells, a fibroblast-like cell line derived from kidney tissue, may lack factors in islets that impact protein folding or stability, alter interactions between G6PC2 and other proteins, or alter posttranslational modifications, all of which could affect the impact of specific SNPs. Of the 22 SNPs previously examined using this indirect approach, nine of them (Gln16His, Val53Ile, Asn68Ile, Tyr124Cys, Ser203Arg, Phe215Ser, Tyr222His, His250Tyr, and Leu301Ser) resulted in a less than 15% change in mouse G6PC1 activity in a novel, intact cell glucose-6-phosphatase assay (22Boortz K.A. Syring K.E. Pound L.D. Wang Y. Oeser J.K. O'Brien R.M. Functional analysis of mouse G6pc1 mutations using a novel in situ assay for glucose-6-phosphatase activity and the effect of mutations in conserved human G6PC1/G6PC2 amino acids on G6PC2 protein expression.PLoS One. 2016; 11e0162439Google Scholar), and so were not reanalyzed in this study. The remaining 13 G6PC2 SNPs either impaired mouse G6PC1 activity more than 15% or were associated with reduced human G6PC2 protein expression in COS cells (Gln8Glu, Ser30Phe, Arg79Gln, Thr107Arg, Gly114Arg, Met126Val, His177Tyr, Tyr207Ser, Phe256Leu, Arg293Trp, Pro313Leu, Ser324Pro, and Pro340Leu) (22Boortz K.A.

Having now achieved relatively high expression of human G6PC2 protein in an islet-derived cell line using the pJPA5 vector, we reanalyzed the direct effects of these 13 SNPs on G6PC2 protein expression and activity. We also analyzed an additional six nonsynonymous G6PC2 SNPs (Trp59Arg, Gly64Arg, Trp73Arg, Leu148Pro, His174Tyr, and Gly186Asp) that were identified in various databases (see Experimental procedures) since our previous study. These SNPs also affect AAs that are conserved in mouse and human G6PC1 and mouse G6PC2 (Fig. 2). We hypothesized that the conservation of these 19 AAs indicated that they were likely to be functionally important. In addition, we also analyzed three additional SNPs, which affect AAs that are not conserved in mouse or human G6PC1. Two are missense changes (Leu219Val and Ile273Val) (Fig. 2) and one generates a termination mutation (Arg283STOP) lacking the C terminal 72 AAs. We hypothesized that studying the functional effect of these three variants was important because they have relatively high minor allele frequencies (MAFs). Therefore, if they were found to affect G6PC2 function, they would likely be amenable to further analysis using human biobanks linked to medical records. For a subset of 9 of the 19 SNPs that affect AAs conserved in mouse and human G6PC1, mutation of these AAs in human G6PC1 has been shown to cause glycogen storage disease type 1a (GSD1a) (26Chou J.Y. Mansfield B.C. Mutations in the glucose-6-phosphatase-alpha (G6PC) gene that cause type Ia glycogen storage disease.Hum. Mutat. 2008; 29: 921-930Google Scholar), directly demonstrating that they are functionally important (Fig. 2; Table 1). We assessed the impact of these nine human G6PC2 SNPs on G6PC2 protein expression in 832/13 cells using Western blotting (Figs. 3 and 4) (Table 1). All nine AA changes were associated with a substantial (>50%) reduction in G6PC2 protein expression (Figs. 3 and 4) (Table 1).Table 1Analysis of the effect of human G6PC2 SNPs that affect conserved amino acids associated with GSD1a in the context of human G6PC1G6PC2 SNPG6PC2 AA#Mutation in human G6PC1 causing GSD1aDomainLocationG6PC2 protein expression (%WT)G6PC2 SIFT predictionG6PC1 AA#G6PC1 protein expression (%WT)rs369755574Trp59ArgArgTM 225.9 ± 8.5ap < 0.05 vs. WT.Deleterious631.7 ± 1.1ap < 0.05 vs. WT.rs762205787Gly64ArgArgTM 232.0 ± 11.4ap < 0.05 vs. WT.Deleterious681.9 ± 1.9ap < 0.05 vs. WT.rs756028690Trp73ArgArgTM 233.7 ± 9.3ap < 0.05 vs. WT.Deleterious7725.7 ± 7.1ap < 0.05 vs. WT.rs144254880Arg79GlnHis or CysLoop27.1 ± 6.8ap < 0.05 vs. WT.Deleterious8350.7 ± 23.8ap < 0.05 vs. WT.rs371234742Thr107ArgIleLoop15.2 ± 6.2ap < 0.05 vs. WT.Deleterious1113.6 ± 3.8ap < 0.05 vs. WT.rs138726309His177TyrProLoop17.9 ± 5.4ap < 0.05 vs. WT.Deleterious17930.2 ± 19.0ap < 0.05 vs. WT.rs764817338Gly186AspAsp or Arg or SerTM 515.9 ± 10.9ap < 0.05 vs. WT.Deleterious18826.5 ± 14.0ap < 0.05 vs. WT.rs2232323Tyr207SerCysTM 614.1 ± 6.3ap < 0.05 vs. WT.Deleterious20912.7 ± 8.8ap < 0.05 vs. WT.rs374055555Arg293TrpCysTM 816.0 ± 4.3ap < 0.05 vs. WT.Deleterious2955.5 ± 0.5ap < 0.05 vs. WT.Human G6PC2 SNPs were identified that affect amino acids (AAs) conserved between mouse and human G6PC1 and mouse and human G6PC2 where a mutation is known to cause GSD1a in the context of human G6PC1.

https://openalex.org/W4200494997,"Copper (Cu) is essential for all life forms; however, in excess, it becomes toxic. Toxic properties of Cu are known to be utilized by host species against various pathogenic invasions. Leishmania, in both free-living and intracellular forms, exhibits appreciable tolerance toward Cu stress. While determining the mechanism of Cu-stress evasion employed by Leishmania, we identified and characterized a hitherto unknown Cu-ATPase in Leishmania major and established its role in parasite survival in host macrophages. This novel L. major Cu-ATPase, LmATP7, exhibits homology with its orthologs at multiple motifs. In promastigotes, LmATP7 primarily localized at the plasma membrane. We also show that LmATP7 exhibits Cu-dependent expression patterns and complements Cu transport in a Cu-ATPase-deficient yeast strain. Promastigotes overexpressing LmATP7 exhibited higher survival upon Cu stress, indicating efficacious Cu export compared with Wt and heterozygous LmATP7 knockout parasites. We further explored macrophage-Leishmania interactions with respect to Cu stress. We found that Leishmania infection triggers upregulation of major mammalian Cu exporter, ATP7A, in macrophages, and trafficking of ATP7A from the trans-Golgi network to endolysosomes in macrophages harboring amastigotes. Simultaneously, in Leishmania, we observed a multifold increase in LmATP7 transcripts as the promastigote becomes established in macrophages and morphs to the amastigote form. Finally, overexpressing LmATP7 in parasites increases amastigote survivability within macrophages, whereas knocking it down reduces survivability drastically. Mice injected in their footpads with an LmATP7-overexpressing strain showed significantly larger lesions and higher amastigote loads as compared with controls and knockouts. These data establish the role of LmATP7 in parasite infectivity and intramacrophagic survivability."
https://openalex.org/W4210389046,"Visually induced changes in the expression of early growth response-1 (EGR1), FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene (FOS), and NGFI-A binding protein-2 (NAB2) appear to form a part of a retinal network fundamental to ocular growth regulation, and thus, the development of myopia (short-sightedness). However, it is unclear how environmental (visual) cues are translated into these molecular changes. One possibility is through epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation, a known regulator of such processes. By sequencing bisulfite-converted DNA amplicons, this study examined whether changes in DNA methylation occur within specific regulatory and promoter regions of EGR1, FOS, and NAB2 during the periods of increased and decreased ocular growth in chicks. Visually induced changes in ocular growth rates were associated with single-point, but not large-scale, shifts in methylation levels within the investigated regions. Analysis of methylation pattern variability (entropy) demonstrated that the observed methylation changes are occurring within small subpopulations of retinal cells. This concurs with previous observations that EGR1 and FOS are differentially regulated at the peptide level within specific retinal cell types. Together, the findings of this study support a potential role for DNA methylation in the translation of external visual cues into molecular changes critical for ocular growth regulation and myopia development."

This study aims to explore the incidence and risk factors for developing postoperative pulmonary complications after cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy and to analyze how these complications affect overall survival.Data were collected on 417 patients undergoing surgery between 2007 and2017 at Uppsala University Hospital, Sweden. Postoperative pulmonary complications were graded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification system where Grade ≥ 3 was considered a severe complication. A logistic regression analysis was used to analyze risk factors for postoperative pulmonary complications and a Cox proportional hazards model to assess impact on survival.Seventy-two patients (17%) developed severe postoperative pulmonary complications. Risk factors were full thickness diaphragmatic injury and/or diaphragmatic resection [OR 5.393, 95% CI 2.924-9.948, p = < 0.001]. Severe postoperative pulmonary complications, in combination with non-pulmonary complications, contributed to decreased overall survival [HR 2.285, 95% CI 1.232-4.241, p = 0.009].Severe postoperative pulmonary complications were common and contributed to decreased overall survival. Full thickness diaphragmatic injury and/or diaphragmatic resection were the main risk factors. This finding emphasizes the need for further research on the mechanisms behind pulmonary complications and their association with mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4200170271,"Protein aggregation and degradation via autophagy (aggrephagy) are major strategies adopted by cells to remove misfolded polypeptides when there is proteasome dysfunction. The functional protein complex consisting of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), cochaperone ubiquitin ligase carboxyl-terminal of Hsp70/Hsp90 interacting protein (CHIP), and co-chaperone Bcl-2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) has been associated with the activation of protein aggregation. However, data on the mechanisms of action of the complex in the protein degradation remains scant. Here, we report that upon proteasome stress, the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) promotes the aggregation of ubiquitinated proteins and its knockout or knockdown aggravates the sensitivity of cells to proteasome inhibitors. Besides, following proteasome inhibition, PKM2 promotes the interaction of BAG3 with CHIP and HSP70. Interestingly, re-expression of loss-of-function mutants in PKM2-knockout cells showed that the regulatory function of PKM2 in this progress does not depend on the activity of glycolytic enzymes or protein kinases. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that PKM2 mediates the formation of the CHIP-HSP70-BAG3 protein complex and promotes the aggregation of ubiquitinated misfolded proteins, thus compensating for proteasome stress in cells."

As a country seriously affected by the pandemic, the health of the Indian higher education system urgently requires assessment to achieve sustainable development and maximize educational externalities. This research systematically proposes a health assessment model from four perspectives, including educational volume, efficiency, equality, and sustainability, by employing the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution Model, Principal Component Analysis, DEA-Tobit Model, and Augmented Solow Model. Empirical results demonstrate that India has high efficiency and an absolute health score in the higher education system through multiple comparisons between India and the other selected countries while having certain deficiencies in equality and sustainability. Additionally, single-target and multiple-target path are simultaneously proposed to enhance the Indian current education system. The multiple-target approach of the India-China-Japan-Europe-USA process is more feasible to achieve sustainable development, which would improve the overall health score from .351 to .716. This finding also reveals that the changes are relatively complex and would take 91.5 years considering the relationship between economic growth rates and crucial indicators. Four targeted policies are suggested for each catching-up period, including expanding and increasing the social funding sources, striving for government expenditure support to improve infrastructures, imposing gender equality in education, and accelerating the construction of high-quality teachers."

One such intervention has been provided for seven years within a region in England. This study reports upon the implementation process and fidelity of this intervention.The process evaluation guidance issued by the Medical Research Council has informed this study. A logic model to describe the intervention and causal assumptions was developed from preliminary semi-structured interviews with project team members. Further semi-structured interviews were undertaken with intervention providers from hospital and community pharmacy, and with patient and public representatives. These aimed to investigate intervention implementation process and fidelity. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and the Consolidated Framework for Intervention Fidelity informed interview topic guides and underpinned the thematic framework analysis using a combined inductive and deductive approach.Themes provided information about intervention fidelity and implementation that were mapped across the sub processes of implementation: planning, execution, reflection and evaluation, and engagement. Interviewees described factors such as lack of training, awareness, clarity on the service specification, governance and monitoring and information and feedback which caused significant issues with the process of intervention implementation and suboptimal intervention fidelity.This provides in-depth insight into the implementation process and fidelity of a ToC intervention, and the extant barriers and facilitators. The findings offer learning to inform the design and implementation of similar interventions, contribute to the evidence base about barriers and facilitators to such interventions and provides in-depth description of the implementation and mechanisms of impact which have the potential to influence clinical and economic outcome evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W4225784254,"The cytokinetic contractile ring (CR) was first described some 50 years ago, however our understanding of the assembly and structure of the animal cell CR remains incomplete. We recently reported that mature CRs in sea urchin embryos contain myosin II mini-filaments organized into aligned concatenated arrays, and that in early CRs myosin II formed discrete clusters that transformed into the linearized structure over time. The present study extends our previous work by addressing the hypothesis that these myosin II clusters also contain the crucial scaffolding proteins anillin and septin, known to help link actin, myosin II, RhoA, and the membrane during cytokinesis. Super-resolution imaging of cortices from dividing embryos indicates that within each cluster, anillin and septin2 occupy a centralized position relative to the myosin II mini-filaments. As CR formation progresses, the myosin II, septin and anillin containing clusters enlarge and coalesce into patchy and faintly linear patterns. Our super-resolution images provide the initial visualization of anillin and septin nanostructure within an animal cell CR, including evidence of a septin filament-like network. Furthermore, Latrunculin-treated embryos indicated that the localization of septin or anillin to the myosin II clusters in the early CR was not dependent on actin filaments. These results highlight the structural progression of the CR in sea urchin embryos from an array of clusters to a linearized purse string, the association of anillin and septin with this process, and provide the visualization of an apparent septin filament network with the CR structure of an animal cell."
https://openalex.org/W4200018746,"CD200R1 is an inhibitory surface receptor expressed in microglia and blood macrophages. Microglial CD200R1 is known to control neuroinflammation by keeping the microglia in resting state, and therefore, tight regulation of its expression is important. CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (CEBPβ) is the known regulator of CD200R1 transcription. In the present study, our specific intention was to find a possible posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism of CD200R1 expression. Here we investigated a novel regulatory mechanism of CD200R1 expression following exposure to an environmental stressor, arsenic, combining in silico analysis, in vitro, and in vivo experiments, as well as validation in human samples. The in silico analysis and in vitro studies with primary neonatal microglia and BV2 microglia revealed that arsenic demethylates the promoter of a microRNA, miR-129-5p, thereby increasing its expression, which subsequently represses CD200R1 by binding to its 3'-untranslated region and shuttling the CD200R1 mRNA to the cytoplasmic-processing body in mouse microglia. The role of miR-129-5p was further validated in BALB/c mouse by stereotaxically injecting anti-miR-129. We found that anti-miR-129 reversed the expression of CD200R1, as well as levels of inflammatory molecules IL-6 and TNF-α. Experiments with a CD200R1 siRNA-induced loss-of-function mouse model confirmed an miR-129-5p→CD200R1→IL-6/TNF-α signaling axis. These main findings were replicated in a human cell line and validated in human samples. Taken together, our study revealed miR-129-5p as a novel posttranscriptional regulator of CD200R1 expression with potential implications in neuroinflammation and related complications."
https://openalex.org/W4200126728,"Understanding health delivery service from a patient´s perspective, including factors influencing healthcare seeking behaviour, is crucial when treating diseases, particularly infectious ones, like tuberculosis. This study aims to trace and contextualise the trajectories patients pursued towards diagnosis and treatment, while discussing key factors associated with treatment delays. Tuberculosis patients' pathways may serve as indicator of the difficulties the more vulnerable sections of society experience in obtaining adequate care.We conducted 27 semi-structured interviews with tuberculosis patients attending a treatment centre in a suburban area of Lisbon. We invited nationals and migrant patients in active treatment to participate by sharing their illness experiences since the onset of symptoms until the present. The Health Belief Model was used as a reference framework to consolidate the qualitative findings.By inductive analysis of all interviews, we categorised participants' healthcare seeking behaviour into 4 main types, related to the time participants took to actively search for healthcare (patient delay) and time the health system spent to diagnose and initiate treatment (health system delay). Each type of healthcare seeking behaviour identified (inhibited, timely, prolonged, and absent) expressed a mindset influencing the way participants sought healthcare. The emergency room was the main entry point where diagnostic care cascade was initiated. Primary Health Care was underused by participants.The findings support that healthcare seeking behaviour is not homogeneous and influences diagnostic delays. If diagnostic delays are to be reduced, the identification of behavioural patterns should be considered when designing measures to improve health services' delivery. Healthcare professionals should be sensitised and perform continuous capacity development training to deal with patients´ needs. Inhibited and prolonged healthcare seeking behaviour contributes significantly to diagnostic delays. These behaviours should be detected and reverted. Timely responses, from patients and the healthcare system, should be promoted."
https://openalex.org/W4200285415,"Patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) exhibit a wide spectrum of clinical and laboratory features when presenting to hospital and pathophysiologic mechanisms differentiating low-risk and high-risk PE are poorly understood.To investigate the prognostic value of clinical, laboratory and radiological information that is available within routine tests undertaken for patients with acute PE.Electronic patient records (EPR) of patients who underwent Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) scan for the investigation of acute PE during 6-month period (01.01.2016-30.06.2016) were examined. Data was gathered from EPR for patients that met inclusion criteria and all CTPA scans were re-evaluated. Biochemical thresholds of low-grade and high-grade inflammation, serum CRP >10mg/L and >150mg/L and serum albumin concentrations <35g/L and <25 g/L, were combined in the Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS) and peri-operative Glasgow Prognostic Score (poGPS) respectively. Neutrophil Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was also calculated. Pulmonary Embolus Severity Index score was calculated.Of the total CTPA reports (n = 2129) examined, 245 patients were eligible for inclusion. Of these, 20 (8%) patients had died at 28-days and 43 (18%) at 6-months. Of the 197 non-cancer related presentations, 28-day and 6-month mortality were 3% and 8% respectively. Of the 48 cancer related presentations, 28-day and 6-month mortality were 29% and 58% respectively. On univariate analysis, age ≥65 years (p<0.01), PESI score ≥100(p = <0.001), NLR ≥3(p<0.001) and Coronary Artery Calcification (CAC) score ≥ 6 (p<0.001) were associated with higher 28-day and 6-month mortality. PESI score ≥100 (OR 5.2, 95% CI: 1.1, 24.2, P <0.05), poGPS ≥1 (OR 2.5, 95% CI: 1.2-5.0, P = 0.01) and NLR ≥3 (OR 3.7, 95% CI: 1.0-3.4, P <0.05) remained independently associated with 28-day mortality. On multivariate binary logistic regression analysis of factors associated with 6-month mortality, PESI score ≥100 (OR 6.2, 95% CI: 2.3-17.0, p<0.001) and coronary artery calcification score ≥6 (OR 2.3, 95% CI: 1.1-4.8, p = 0.030) remained independently associated with death at 6-months. When patients who had an underlying cancer diagnosis were excluded from the analysis only GPS≥1 remained independently associated with 6-month mortality (OR 5.0, 95% CI 1.2-22.0, p<0.05).PESI score >100, poGPS≥1, NLR ≥3 and CAC score ≥6 were associated with 28-day and 6-month mortality. PESI score ≥100, poGPS≥1 and NLR ≥3 remained independently associated with 28-day mortality. PESI score ≥100 and CAC score ≥6 remained independently associated with 6-month mortality. When patients with underlying cancer were excluded from the analysis, GPS≥1 remained independently associated with 6-month mortality. The role of the systemic inflammatory response (SIR) in determining treatment and prognosis requires further study. Routine reporting of CAC scores in CTPA scans for acute PE may have a role in aiding clinical decision-making regarding treatment and prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W4200331338,"The aim of this study was to examine whether positive and negative mood states affect auditory distraction in a serial-recall task. The duplex-mechanism account differentiates two types of auditory distraction. The changing-state effect is postulated to be rooted in interference-by-process and to be automatic. The auditory-deviant effect is attributed to attentional capture by the deviant distractors. Only the auditory-deviant effect, but not the changing-state effect, should be influenced by emotional mood states according to the duplex-mechanism account. Four experiments were conducted to test how auditory distraction is affected by emotional mood states. Mood was induced by autobiographical recall (Experiments 1 and 2) or the presentation of emotional pictures (Experiments 3 and 4). Even though the manipulations were successful in inducing changes in mood, neither positive mood (Experiments 1 and 3) nor negative mood (Experiments 2 and 4) had any effect on distraction despite large samples sizes (N = 851 in total). The results thus are not in line with the hypothesis that auditory distraction is affected by changes in mood state. The results support an automatic-capture account according to which the auditory-deviant effect and the changing-state effect are mainly stimulus-driven effects that are rooted in the automatic processing of the to-be-ignored auditory stream."

Here, we report that human microsomal dehydrogenase reductase 9 (DHRS9, also known as SDR9C4 of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily) exhibits a robust oxidative activity toward oxylipins with hydroxyl groups located at carbons C9 and C13 of octadecanoids, C12 and C15 carbons of eicosanoids, and C14 carbon of docosanoids. DHRS9/SDR9C4 is also active toward lipid inflammatory mediator dihydroxylated Leukotriene B4 and proresolving mediators such as tri-hydroxylated Resolvin D1 and Lipoxin A4, although notably, with lack of activity on the 15-hydroxyl of prostaglandins. We also found that the SDR enzymes phylogenetically related to DHRS9, i.e., human SDR9C8 (or retinol dehydrogenase 16), the rat SDR9C family member known as retinol dehydrogenase 7, and the mouse ortholog of human DHRS9 display similar activity toward oxylipin substrates. Mice deficient in DHRS9 protein are viable, fertile, and display no apparent phenotype under normal conditions. However, the oxidative activity of microsomal membranes from the skin, lung, and trachea of Dhrs9−/− mice toward 1 μM Leukotriene B4 is 1.7- to 6-fold lower than that of microsomes from wild-type littermates. In addition, the oxidative activity toward 1 μM Resolvin D1 is reduced by about 2.5-fold with DHRS9-null microsomes from the skin and trachea. These results strongly suggest that DHRS9 might play an important role in the metabolism of a wide range of bioactive oxylipins in vivo.

Members are assigned on the basis of SDR signature features, including the TGX3GXG motif of the nucleotide-binding region and the catalytically active tetrad N-S-Y-K, which constitutes the active site. Typically, these proteins function as dimeric or tetrameric NAD(P)(H)-dependent oxidoreductases with a subunit molecular mass of 25 to 35 kDa. SDR enzymes are found in the cytoplasm, mitochondria, nuclei, peroxisomes, and endoplasmic reticulum where they participate in the metabolism of sugars, steroids, prostaglandins, retinoids, aliphatic alcohols, and xenobiotics. DHRS9 belongs to SDR9C, the largest subfamily of SDRs with many as eight human members and at least 13 mouse homologs. The additional mouse homologs likely appeared as a result of multiple rounds of lineage-specific gene duplications (Fig. 1) (3Persson B. Kallberg Y. Bray J.E. Bruford E. Dellaporta S.L. Favia A.D.

The two founding members were named retinol dehydrogenases (RDH), based on the initial assays that demonstrated their activities toward 11-cis-retinol (human RDH5), (5Simon A. Hellman U. Wernstedt C.

However, later analysis revealed that both RDH5 and RDH7 displayed activities toward 3α-hydroxysteroids (7Wang J. Chai X. Eriksson U. Napoli J.L.

In the case of rat RDH7, its 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity significantly exceeded that with all-trans-retinol. Similarly, human homologs of rat RDH7, i.e., human RDH16 (SDR9C8), which shares 72% protein sequence identity with rat RDH7, and human 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 6 (HSD17B6/SDR9C6) with 66% sequence identity (Fig. 1) to rat RDH7 were shown to oxidize the hydroxyl groups on steroid molecules (9Gough W.H.

Furthermore, like human RDH5 and rat RDH7, human RDH16 and HSD17B6 were also capable of oxidizing retinoid substrates, suggesting that active sites of these enzymes can accommodate structurally unrelated substrates (names of these SDRs assigned by different researchers who independently cloned the corresponding genes are listed in Table S1). Although in vitro human RDH5 (SDR9C5) displays dual substrate specificity toward 11-cis-retinol and 3α-hydroxysteroids, its in vivo role in the oxidation of 11-cis-retinol to 11-cis-retinaldehyde in the visual cycle has been supported by genetic linkage evidence (11Yamamoto H. Simon A. Eriksson U. Harris E. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. Mutations in the gene encoding 11-cis retinol dehydrogenase cause delayed dark adaptation and fundus albipunctatus.Nat.

In addition to the established role of RDH5 in 11-cis-retinol metabolism, a recent study uncovered the role of SDR9C7, previously known as SDR-orphan (SDR-O), in dehydrogenation of acylceramides for skin barrier formation (13Chen W.

This finding further emphasized the idea that members of SDR9C family can accommodate various structurally unrelated substrates. DHRS9 (SDR9C4) is one of the least understood proteins of the 9C family. Originally identified based on its sequence similarity to RDHs (∼50%), DHRS9 was initially tested with retinoids and hydroxysteroids as candidate substrates. Data from this laboratory showed that DHRS9 catalyzed the oxidation of 3α-hydroxyl group on androgenic 3α-hydroxysteroids and neurosteroids (15Chetyrkin S.V. Belyaeva O.V. Gough W.H. Kedishvili N.Y.

Accordingly, DHRS9 has been known under several different names (see Table S1), and it is currently believed that DHRS9 functions as a retinol dehydrogenase (19Zhao Y. Vuckovic M. Yoo H.S. Fox N.

However, as indicated by our previous studies, the activity of DHRS9 toward neurosteroid allopregnanolone or androsterone was significantly lower than that of either HSD17B6 or RDH16 (21Belyaeva O.V.

Consistent with our kinetic measurements, it was shown that unlike the well-established retinol dehydrogenase RDH10 of the SDR16C family (22Sandell L.L. Sanderson B.W. Moiseyev G. Johnson T. Mushegian A. Young K. Rey J.P. Ma J.X. Staehling-Hampton K. Trainor P.A.

Thus, taking into account that DHRS9 displayed fairly modest activity with steroid substrates and little if any activity with retinoid substrates, these findings suggested that DHRS9 might naturally utilize substrates other than steroids and/or retinoids.

The relative levels of each protein in Sf9 microsomes were assessed using Coomassie Blue stained SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 2A). The identities of each SDR were verified by Western blotting (Fig. 2, B and C) and quantified by scanning densitometry. Although the microsomal preparations contained somewhat different protein amounts of individual SDRs, considering that protein levels of RDH16, DHRS9, and RDH7 were fairly close, some ideas about their relative catalytic efficiencies and substrate specificities can be drawn from the kinetic parameters. As summarized in Table 1, DHRS9 displayed a very robust activity toward hydroxylated oxylipins (structures of substrates tested are shown in Fig. S1). Of significance regarding substrate specificity, within the arachidonic acid series of HETEs, we were unable to detect any activity with 5(S)-HETE, whereas both 12(S)-HETE and 15(S)-HETE were well oxidized, suggesting that DHRS9 preferentially oxidizes secondary alcohol groups located along the CH3-terminal tail of the carbon chain. This was supported by the relative oxidation rates of the two hydroxy-C18:2ω6 oxylipins: both were effective substrates, with a fivefold higher rate for 13(S)-HODE compared with 9(S)-HODE. In line with this specificity, 14(S)-HDoHE of the C22:6ω3 series was also a good substrate.Table 1Substrate specificity of human DHRS9 (SDR9C4)SubstrateKm, μMVmaxaTo facilitate the comparison of catalytic efficiency of DHRS9 toward various oxylipin substrates, its Vmax values were calculated based on the activity in samples containing 1 μg of total microsomal protein., pmol × min−1Vmax/Km pmol/(min × μM)12(S)-HETE0.43 ± 0.16220 ± 3351215(S)-HETE0.36 ± 0.18140 ± 213909(S)-HODE0.57 ± 0.2524 ± 34213(S)-HODE0.46 ± 0.19110 ± 1424014(S)-HDoHE0.17 ± 0.0680 ± 8471LTB40.76 ± 0.44170 ± 43224LXA44.6 ± 2.7230 ± 7650RvD11.6 ± 0.585 ± 1253All-trans-retinolND0.32bThe reaction rate was determined using 10 μM all-trans-retinol and 1 mM NAD+ with 5 μg of DHRS9 Sf9 microsomes.-AndrosteroneND6.8cThe reaction rate was determined using 20 μM androsterone and 1 mM NAD+ with 5 μg of DHRS9 Sf9 microsomes.-Abbreviation: ND, not determined.a To facilitate the comparison of catalytic efficiency of DHRS9 toward various oxylipin substrates, its Vmax values were calculated based on the activity in samples containing 1 μg of total microsomal protein.b The reaction rate was determined using 10 μM all-trans-retinol and 1 mM NAD+ with 5 μg of DHRS9 Sf9 microsomes.c The reaction rate was determined using 20 μM androsterone and 1 mM NAD+ with 5 μg of DHRS9 Sf9 microsomes.

With polyhydroxylated substrates (Fig. S1), DHRS9 demonstrated the greatest Vmax value toward LXA4, followed by LTB4 and RvD1 in the order: LXA4 > LTB4 >> RvD1. However, its Km value for LXA4 was sixfold greater than that for LTB4 (Table 1). Consequently, the catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km) of DHRS9 for LTB4 exceeded that of LXA4 and RvD1 by a factor of 4.5 and 4.2, respectively, suggesting that among LXA4, LTB4, and RvD1, LTB4 might be the preferred substrate of human DHRS9. In designating DHRS9-catalyzed oxidation to classes of potential substrates, it is notable that the activity with the top oxylipin substrates greatly exceeded the rates with androsterone and all-trans-retinol, by 20-fold and 500-fold, respectively, compared with 12(S)-HETE (Table 1 and Fig. S2). These observations strongly suggest that hydroxylated oxylipins are the preferred, natural substrates of DHRS9. Comparable studies with the mouse enzyme used microsomes from DHRS9-expressing HEK293 cells. Qualitatively, the activity on oxylipins was similar to the human enzyme (Fig. 3 and Table 2). Among the monohydroxylated oxylipins, the highest rate of conversion was observed with 12(S)-HETE. 15(S)-HETE, 9(S)-HODE, and 13(S)-HODE were oxidized at approximately similar rates that were about twofold lower than with 12(S)-HETE (Table 2). With polyhydroxylated substrates, mouse DHRS9 demonstrated the highest oxidation rate toward 17(R)-RvD1, followed by LTB4. The reaction rate was about threefold lower with 1 μM LXA4 as substrate compared with 1 μM RvD1, and no activity was detected toward LXB4. On account of the relatively low expression level in HEK293 cells, a means to quantify mouse DHRS9 protein levels was lacking, obviating direct comparison of rates with human DHRS9, although the substrate specificities were an excellent match.Table 2Activity of mouse DHRS9 toward oxylipinsSubstrateProductRate, nmol × min−1 × mg−1 of microsomal protein12(S)-HETE12-oxo-ETE1.9 ± 0.215(S)-HETE15-oxo-ETE1.1 ± 0.19(S)-HODE9-KODE0.82 ± 0.0513(S)-HODE13-KODE0.70 ± 0.03RvD1Oxo-RvD11.2 ± 0.117(R)-RvD1Oxo-RvD11.3 ± 0.1LXA4Oxo-LXA40.30 ± 0.02LXB4Oxo-LTB40.0LTB4Oxo-LTB40.88 ± 0.04Microsomes (5 μg) isolated from HEK293 cells transfected with mouse DHRS9 expression construct were incubated with substrates (1 μM each) as indicated.

The values represent the reaction rates after subtracting the rates obtained with microsomes from HEK293 cells transfected with empty vector. Similar analysis carried out with another member of the SDR9C family human RDH16 (SDR9C8) yielded significant differences. Although 15(S)-HETE and the two C18:2 HODEs were oxidized by RDH16 (Table 3), the enzyme displayed 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower rates compared with DHRS9, even after accounting for the 1.6-fold lower level of RDH16 protein expression in Sf9 microsomes (see Fig. 2A); furthermore, there was negligible activity with 12(S)-HETE. RDH16 also exhibited marginal activities with LTB4, LXA4, RvD1, and all-trans-retinol, making it highly unlikely that RDH16 can successfully compete in vivo with DHRS9 for these oxylipins, or with RDH10, the proven retinol dehydrogenase (22Sandell L.L.

Open table in a new tab Abbreviation: ND, not determined. #To facilitate the comparison of catalytic efficiency of RDH16 toward various oxylipin substrates, its Vmax values were calculated based on the activity in samples containing 1 μg of total microsomal protein. In fact, the Vmax/Km values of RDH16 for monohydroxylated oxylipins were lower than its Vmax/Km value for androsterone (Table 3 and Fig. S2) that we reported previously (34Lapshina E.A. Belyaeva O.V.

Taken together, these observations suggest that it is highly unlikely that RDH16 can directly compete for monohydroxylated oxylipins with DHRS9 or for androsterone with other more specialized sterol dehydrogenases. It is still possible that RDH16 might occupy some specialized niche where it can metabolize oxylipins and/or steroids without directly competing with other better suited enzymes. Alternatively, it might indicate that natural substrates of RDH16 remain to be identified. Kinetic analysis of human HSD17B6 revealed marginal activities with the majority of oxylipin substrates as well as with all-trans-retinol (Table 4). Therefore, it is highly unlikely that HSD17B6 can compete with DHRS9 for any biologically active oxylipin substrates. It is also unlikely that HSD17B6 can compete with specialized retinol dehydrogenases, like RDH10, for all-trans-retinol. In fact, these outcomes are not particularly surprising because our earlier study (10Chetyrkin S.V. Hu J. Gough W.H. Dumaual N. Kedishvili N.Y.

https://openalex.org/W4200416207,"SEC23B is one of two vertebrate paralogs of SEC23, a key component of the coat protein complex II vesicles. Complete deficiency of SEC23B in mice leads to perinatal death caused by massive degeneration of professional secretory tissues. However, functions of SEC23B in postnatal mice and outside professional secretory tissues are unclear. In this study, we generated a Sec23b KO mouse and a knockin (KI) mouse with the E109K mutation, the most common human mutation in congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II patients. We found that E109K mutation led to decreases in SEC23B levels and protein mislocalization. However, Sec23bki/ki mice showed no obvious abnormalities. Sec23b hemizygosity (Sec23bki/ko) was partially lethal, with only half of expected hemizygous mice surviving past weaning. Surviving Sec23bki/ko mice exhibited exocrine insufficiency, increased endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis in the pancreas, and phenotypes consistent with chronic pancreatitis. Sec23bki/ko mice had mild to moderate anemia without other typical congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II features, likely resulting from exocrine insufficiency. Moreover, Sec23bki/ko mice exhibited severe growth restriction accompanied by growth hormone (GH) insensitivity, reminiscent of Laron syndrome. Growth restriction is not associated with hepatocyte-specific Sec23b deletion, suggesting a nonliver origin of this phenotype. We propose that inflammation associated with chronic pancreatic deficiency may explain GH insensitivity in Sec23bki/ko mice. Our results reveal a genotype-phenotype correlation in SEC23B deficiency and indicate that pancreatic acinar is most sensitive to SEC23B deficiency in adult mice. The Sec23bki/ko mice provide a novel model of chronic pancreatitis and growth retardation with GH insensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W4200423407,"The present study utilized digestives tracts from adult largemouth bass (LMB) to hydrolyze Bighead carp muscle and obtain an optimal profile of muscle protein hydrolysates that would be easily assimilated within the primitive digestive tract of larval LMB. Specifically, muscle protein source was digested for the larva using the fully developed digestive system of the same species. The objectives of this study were: 1) to develop an optimal in vitro methodology for carp muscle hydrolysis using LMB endogenous digestive enzymes, and 2) to evaluate the effect of dietary inclusion of the carp muscle protein hydrolysate on LMB growth, survival, occurrence of skeletal deformities, and whole-body free amino acid composition. The study found that the in vitro hydrolysis method using carp intact muscle and LMB digestive tracts incubated at both acid and alkaline pH (to mimic digestive process of LMB) yielded a wide range of low molecular weight fractions (peptides), as opposed to the non-hydrolyzed muscle protein or muscle treated only with acid pH or alkaline pH without enzymes from LMB digestive tracts, which were comprised of large molecular weight fractions (polypeptides above 150 kDa). Overall, the dietary inclusion of the carp muscle hydrolysate improved growth performance of larval LMB in terms of final average weight, weight gain, DGC, SGR, and body length after 21 days of feeding compared to fish that received the diet based on non-hydrolyzed carp muscle. The study also found that hydrolysate-based feed significantly reduced skeletal deformities. The positive growth performance presented by fish in the hydrolysate-fed group possibly resulted from matching the specific requirements of the larvae with respect to their digestive organ development, levels of digestive enzymes present in the gut, and nutritional requirements."
https://openalex.org/W4200603087,"This study evaluates the diversity of the so-called 'Moroccan Royal lions' using genealogical information. Lions are no longer extant in North Africa, but the previous wild population was an important element of the now-recognised northern subspecies (Panthera leo leo) that ranged across West Africa, North Africa and the Middle East into India. The remaining captive population of 'Moroccan Royal lions' seems to be significantly endangered by the loss of diversity due to the effective population size decrease. The pedigree file of this captive lion population consisted of 454 individuals, while the reference population included 98 animals (47 males and 51 females). The completeness of the pedigree data significantly decreased with an increasing number of generations. The highest percentage of pedigree completeness (over 70%) was achieved in the first generation of the reference population. Pedigree-based parameters derived from the common ancestor and gene origin were used to estimate the state of diversity. In the reference population, the average inbreeding coefficient was 2.14%, while the individual increase in inbreeding over generations was 2.31%. Overall, the reference population showed lower average inbreeding and average relatedness compared with the pedigree file. The number of founders (47), the effective number of founders (24) and the effective number of ancestors (22) were estimated in the reference population. The effective population size of 14.02 individuals confirms the critically endangered status of the population and rapid loss of diversity in the future. Thus, continuous monitoring of the genetic diversity of the 'Moroccan Royal lion' group is required, especially for long-term conservation management purposes, as it would be an important captive group should further DNA studies establish an affinity to P. leo leo."
https://openalex.org/W4200346231,"Rancho La Brea (California, USA) is the most emblematic Quaternary fossiliferous locality in the world, since both the high number and diversity of the specimens recovered and their excellent preservational quality. In the last decades, paleobiological and paleoecological knowledge of the different groups of mammals from this site has increased notably; however, some aspects have not yet been inquired or there is little information. In this work we provide information on one of the most abundant mammals of this site, the equid Equus occidentalis, based on the study, from osteohistological and histotaphonomic perspectives, of thin sections of different limb bones. On the one hand, from an osteohistological viewpoint, we observe that the distribution and characterization of bone tissues in the different skeletal elements are, in general lines, similar to that mentioned for other extant and extinct equids. Cyclical growth marks allowed us to propose preliminary skeletochronological interpretations. On the other hand, from a taphonomic viewpoint, we note that all the samples reflect an excellent preservation of the bone microstructure, slightly altered by different pre- and post-burial processes. The variations recorded evidence different taphonomic history and preservation conditions among pits. This is the first study including fossil material from Rancho La Brea exclusively based on the analysis of the bone microstructure features."
https://openalex.org/W4200495563,"Actinobacterial 2-hydroxyacyl-CoA lyase reversibly catalyzes the thiamine diphosphate-dependent cleavage of 2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA to formyl-CoA and acetone. This enzyme has great potential for use in synthetic one-carbon assimilation pathways for sustainable production of chemicals, but lacks details of substrate binding and reaction mechanism for biochemical reengineering. We determined crystal structures of the tetrameric enzyme in the closed conformation with bound substrate, covalent postcleavage intermediate, and products, shedding light on active site architecture and substrate interactions. Together with molecular dynamics simulations of the covalent precleavage complex, the complete catalytic cycle is structurally portrayed, revealing a proton transfer from the substrate acyl Cβ hydroxyl to residue E493 that returns it subsequently to the postcleavage Cα-carbanion intermediate. Kinetic parameters obtained for mutants E493A, E493Q, and E493K confirm the catalytic role of E493 in the WT enzyme. However, the 10- and 50-fold reduction in lyase activity in the E493A and E493Q mutants, respectively, compared with WT suggests that water molecules may contribute to proton transfer. The putative catalytic glutamate is located on a short α-helix close to the active site. This structural feature appears to be conserved in related lyases, such as human 2-hydroxyacyl-CoA lyase 2. Interestingly, a unique feature of the actinobacterial 2-hydroxyacyl-CoA lyase is a large C-terminal lid domain that, together with active site residues L127 and I492, restricts substrate size to ≤C5 2-hydroxyacyl residues. These details about the catalytic mechanism and determinants of substrate specificity pave the ground for designing tailored catalysts for acyloin condensations for one-carbon and short-chain substrates in biotechnological applications."
https://openalex.org/W4200578714,"We examined keratin aggregate formation and the possible mechanisms involved. With this aim, we observed the effect that different ratios between mutant and wild-type keratins expressed in cultured keratinocytes may have on aggregate formation in vitro, as well as how keratin aggregate formation affects the mechanical properties of cells at the cell cortex. To this end we prepared clones with expression rates as close as possible to 25%, 50% and 100% of the EGFP-K14 proteins (either WT or R125P and V270M mutants). Our results showed that only in the case of the 25% EGFP-K14 R125P mutant significant differences could be seen. Namely, we observed in this case the largest accumulation of keratin aggregates and a significant reduction in cell stiffness. To gain insight into the possible mechanisms behind this observation, we extended our previous mathematical model of keratin dynamics by implementing a more complex reaction network that considers the coexistence of wild-type and mutant keratins in the cell. The new model, consisting of a set of coupled, non-linear, ordinary differential equations, allowed us to draw conclusions regarding the relative amounts of intermediate filaments and aggregates in cells, and suggested that aggregate formation by asymmetric binding between wild-type and mutant keratins could explain the data obtained on cells grown in culture."
https://openalex.org/W4200464889,"The diagnosis of mood disorders (MD) during pregnancy is challenging and may bring negative consequences to the maternal-fetal binomial. The long waitlist for specialized psychiatric evaluation in Brazil contributes to the treatment omission. Almost 20.0% of women treated with antidepressants have a positive screening for bipolar disorder. Therefore, it has been recommended the investigation of depressive and bipolar disorder during prenatal care. Unfortunately, the screening for mood disorders is not a reality in Brazil and many childbearing women remain undiagnosed. The objective of this study is to observe the frequency of MD and the effectiveness of screening scales for routine use by health professionals during prenatal care in high-risk pregnancies.This cross-sectional study included 61 childbearing women in their second trimester who were interviewed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ). The cut-off point was EPDS ≥ 13 and MDQ ≥ 7 and the SCID-5 was the gold standard diagnosis. MD were diagnosed in 24.6% of the high-risk pregnancies. EDPS was positive in 19.7% and the frequency of major depression was 8.2%. 16.4% of the childbearing women were diagnosed with bipolar disorder, while MDQ was positive in 36.1%. 11.5% of the women had EPDS and MDQ positive. EPDS sensitivity was 80.0% and specificity 92.1%, whereas MDQ presented a sensitivity of 70.0% and specificity of 70.6%.There is a high prevalence of MD in high-risk pregnancies. The routine use of EPDS simultaneously to MDQ during antenatal care is effective and plays an important role in early diagnosis, counselling, and promotion of perinatal mental health."
