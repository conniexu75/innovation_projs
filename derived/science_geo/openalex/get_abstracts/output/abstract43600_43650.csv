https://openalex.org/W1560452279,"Laminin (Mr = 800,000) is a glycoprotein consisting of three chains, A, B1, and B2, and has diverse biological activities. Previously we reported the complete primary structure of the B1 and B2 chains of mouse laminin deduced from cDNA sequence (Sasaki, M., Kohno, K., Kato, S., Martin, G. R., and Yamada, Y. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 935-939; Sasaki, M., and Yamada, Y. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 17111-17117). Here we describe the isolation, characterization, and sequence of cDNA clones spanning 9,520 bases which encode the entire A chain of mouse laminin. The nucleotide sequence of the clones contains an open reading frame of 3,084 amino acids including 24 amino acids of a signal peptide. The A chain contains some eight distinct domains including alpha-helices, cysteine-rich repeats and globules. There is considerable sequence and structural homology between the A chain and the B1 and B2 chains. However, the A chain has a unique globular structure containing homologous repeats at the carboxyl terminus and constituting one third of the molecular mass of the chain. Furthermore, the A chain contains three globules and three cysteine-rich domains at the amino terminus, whereas the B1 and B2 chains have only two each of such domains. The A chain shows homology to the basement membrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan core protein and the extracellular domain of the Drosophila neurogenic protein Notch. There is an RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) sequence in one of the cysteine-rich domains of the A chain. This potential cell binding sequence could be active as another adhesion signal in addition to the previously identified cell binding sequence YIGSR (Tyr-Ile-Gly-Ser-Arg) of the B1 chain."
https://openalex.org/W1544043865,"The isolation of a novel complementary DNA (cDNA) clone coding for human calmodulin (CaM) is reported. Although it encodes a protein indistinguishable from the only known higher vertebrate calmodulin, its nucleotide sequence varies extensively from that of two previously reported human CaM cDNAs (Wawrzynczak and Perham, 1984; SenGupta et al., 1987). Only 82 and 81% identity, respectively, is found between the newly isolated and the two known human mRNAs in their coding regions. No striking homology is present in their noncoding regions. Codon usage in the three CaM mRNAs is also surprisingly divergent. A 2.3-kilobase mRNA corresponding to the newly isolated clone is expressed to varying extents in several human tissues, together with an approximately 0.8-kilobase mRNA species presumably arising from alternative polyadenylation of the same primary transcript. The results indicate that the human genome contains at least three divergent CaM genes that are under selective pressure to encode an identical protein while maintaining maximally divergent nucleotide sequences. Partial characterization of a genomic clone specifying the 3â€² portion of the newly identified CaM mRNA shows that this gene contains introns at identical positions as the previously characterized bona fide vertebrate CaM genes. Evolutionary implications of the presence of a CaM multigene family are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1599093134,"A small metalloproteinase that digests Azocoll was found in the uterus of the rat. Its activity increased to high levels during the postpartum period in parallel with the breakdown of the extracellular matrix exclusive of collagen (Sellers, A., and Woessner, J.F., Jr. (1980) Biochem. J. 189, 521-531). This enzyme has now been purified almost 7,000-fold to homogeneity from 12 g of tissue using molecular sieve chromatography, blue sepharose chromatography, and zinc-chelate chromatography. Gel electrophoresis with sodium dodecyl sulfate and dithiothreitol gives Mr = 28,000 for the latent form of the enzyme and Mr = 19,000 for the active form that arises spontaneously or by treatment with aminophenylmercuric acetate. The enzyme digests components of the extracellular matrix including gelatins of types I, III, IV, and V, fibronectin, and proteoglycan. It digests the alpha 2(I) chain of gelatin in preference to the alpha 1(I) chain and cleaves dinitrophenyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Ile-Ala-Gly-Pro-D-Arg. It cleaves the B chain of insulin at two points: Ala14-Leu15 and Tyr16-Leu17. It has no action on collagens of types I, III, IV, or V at 26 degrees C and no action on elastin or phenylazo-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-D-Arg. The pH optimum is at pH 7 and the pI at 5.9. The enzyme requires zinc and calcium ions for activity; cobalt and strontium can partially replace these metal ions. The enzyme is not inhibited by low levels of phosphoramidon or Zincov. Its properties clearly distinguish it from collagenase, gelatinase (matrix metalloproteinase 2), and stromelysin (matrix metalloproteinase 3); it therefore constitutes a further member of the family of extracellular matrix metalloendopeptidases. The name matrix metalloproteinase 7 is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1574912127,"Three antibacterial proteins were purified from the culture medium of NIH-Sape-4, an embryonic cell line of Sarcophaga peregrina (flesh fly). Sequencing studies showed that two of these proteins belong to the sarcotoxin I family, potent antibacterial proteins purified from the hemolymph of Sarcophaga larvae, whereas the other protein, named sapecin, is a new protein consisting of 40 amino acid residues including 6 cysteine residues. Unlike sarcotoxin I, sapecin preferentially represses the growth of various Gram-positive bacteria. The proteins of the sarcotoxin I family produced by this cell line were found to have carboxyl-terminal glycine, whereas sarcotoxin I in the hemolymph has amidated amino acids. This suggests that the embryonic cells lack an enzyme that cleaves off carboxyl-terminal glycine to form a new amidated carboxyl terminus."
https://openalex.org/W1560118688,"Anion exchange is a nearly ubiquitous cellular transport function which contributes to the regulation of cell pH and of cell volume. However, the only plasma membrane anion exchanger of known identity and sequence is erythroid band 3. Both hybridization and immunologic data support the presence of band 3-related mRNAs and proteins in nonerythroid tissues. We have used low stringency hybridization with the murine band 3 cDNA to clone a band 3-related cDNA from murine kidney and from 70Z/3 pre-B cells. The cDNA encodes a band 3-related protein (B3RP) of 1237 amino acids, with a predicted mass of 137 kDa. The carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain of B3RP has an amino acid sequence 67% identical to that of band 3, with a very similar predicted secondary structure. The amino-terminal hydrophilic domain of B3RP has two sections. The section adjacent to the putative membrane-associated segment is 33% identical in amino acid sequence to the amino-terminal, cytoplasmic domain of band 3. The other, far amino-terminal section of B3RP has no correspondent in the band 3 sequence. B3RP mRNA is present in a variety of epithelial and other tissues and probably encodes an anion exchange protein of wide distribution."
https://openalex.org/W1523977751,"Abstract The mitochondrial isoform of creatine kinase (Mi-CK, EC 2.7.3.2) purified to homogeneity from chicken cardiac muscle by the mild and efficient technique described in this article was greater than or equal to 99.5% pure and consisted of greater than or equal to 95% of a distinct, octameric Mi-CK protein species, with a Mr of 364,000 +/- 30,000 and an apparent subunit Mr of 42,000. The remaining 5% were dimeric Mi-CK with an apparent Mr of 86,000 +/- 8,000. Octamerization was not due to covalent linkages or intermolecular disulfide bonding. Upon dilution into buffers of low ionic strength and alkaline pH, octameric Mi-CK slowly dissociated in a time-dependent manner (weeks-months) into dimeric Mi-CK. However, the time scale of dimerization was reduced to minutes by the addition to diluted Mi-CK octamers of a mixture of Mg2+, ADP, creatine and nitrate known to induce a transition-state analogue complex (Milner-White, E.J., and Watts, D. C. (1971) Biochem. J. 122, 727-740). The conversion was fully reversible, and octamers were reformed by simple concentrations of Mi-CK dimer solutions to greater than or equal to 1 mg/ml at near neutral pH and physiological salt concentrations in the absence of adenine nucleotide. After separation of the two Mi-CK species by gel filtration, electron microscopic analysis revealed uniform square-shaped particles with a central negative-stain-filled cavity in the octamer fractions and banana-shaped structures in the dimer fractions. Mi-CK was localized inside the mitochondria by immunogold labeling with polyclonal antibodies. A dynamic model of the octamer-dimer equilibrium of Mi-CK and the preferential association of the octameric Mi-CK form with the inner mitochondrial membrane is discussed in the context of regulation of Mi-CK activity, mitochondrial respiration, and the CP shuttle."
https://openalex.org/W1552480409,"A complementary DNA (cDNA) copy of the aromatase P-450 has been isolated from a chicken ovary library using as probe a partial cDNA believed to encode the human placental aromatase. The predicted amino acid sequence of the chicken aromatase cDNA possesses regions of homology to that of its human counterpart, but only limited homology to other cytochrome P-450 enzymes. The introduction of the cDNA clone into COS-1 cells results in the production of high levels of aromatase activity. The chicken enzyme is targeted to the appropriate subcellular fraction in the transfected COS cells, and the apparent Km of the chicken aromatase activity, measured in microsomes prepared from the transfected cells, is similar to that of the enzyme prepared from chicken ovary microsomes. These findings establish that the cDNA clone encodes chicken ovarian aromatase and demonstrate that this protein can catalyze the three successive oxidation reactions necessary to form estrogen from androgen."
https://openalex.org/W1673586429,"To study the effect of triglyceride content of low density lipoprotein (LDL) on its physicochemical and biological properties, we have depleted the triglyceride by incubation with hepatic lipase (HL-LDL) and raised the triglyceride by incubation of HL-LDL with very low density lipoprotein and lipoprotein-deficient serum. HL-LDL was taken up by human monocyte-derived macrophages and by human skin fibroblasts at an increased rate compared to untreated LDL. Incubation of the various LDL preparations revealed that cellular LDL degradation as well as LDL-mediated cholesterol esterification were inversely related to the triglyceride content of the LDL preparation. Modification of the triglyceride content of LDL also was associated with changes in the free fatty acid content, but the interaction of the LDL with cells was unaffected by the level of this component. The triglyceride content of LDL was found to be reciprocally related to the number of free lysine amino groups of LDL apolipoprotein B (apoB) which could be labeled with trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid. 13C-Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of native LDL and HL-LDL samples containing [13CH3]2 lysine residues formed by reductive methylation (11-13% modification) showed that the arrangement of apoB lysines is perturbed by the exposure to hepatic lipase. The ratio of labeled lysines with pK 8.9 to those with pK 10.5 exposed on the surface of LDL particles was decreased by about 40% by lipase treatment. These effects are apparently due to changes in local apoB conformation because circular dichroism spectra revealed that the average secondary structure of the entire apoB molecule is the same in native LDL and HL-LDL. The triglyceride content of LDL reciprocally affected its binding to a monoclonal antibody which recognizes epitopes around the LDL receptor binding domain of apoB. The above evidence indicates that modulation of the core triglyceride and possibly also surface phospholipid content of LDL can alter the conformation of apoB on the surface of the particle, thereby influencing the interaction with cell surface LDL receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2104887669,"We have isolated several overlapping cDNA clones encoding alpha 1(XI) collagen chains from human and rat cDNA libraries. Together the human cDNAs code for 335 uninterrupted Gly-X-Y triplets, and a 264-amino acid C-propeptide, while the rat cDNAs cover the entire C-propeptide and about a third of the triple-helical domain. Comparison of the human and rodent nucleotide sequences showed a 95% sequence similarity. The identification of the clones as alpha 1(XI) cDNAs was based on the complete identity between the amino acid sequences of three human alpha 1(XI) cyanogen bromide peptides and the cDNA-derived sequence. Examination of and the cDNA-derived amino acid sequence showed a variety of structural features characteristic of fibrillar-forming collagens. In addition, nucleotide sequence analysis of a selected portion of the corresponding human gene revealed the characteristic 54-base pair exon motif. We conclude therefore that pro-alpha 1 (XI) collagen belongs to the group of fibrillar collagen genes. We also suggest that the expression of this gene is not restricted to cartilage, as previously thought, since the cDNA libraries from which the clones were isolated, originated from both cartilagenous and noncartilaginous tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1504713469,"A detailed study of the qualitative and quantitative composition of bile acids in human fetal gallbladder bile is described. Bile was collected during early gestation (weeks 16-19) and analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, fast atom bombardment ionization mass spectrometry, and high performance liquid chromatography. Bile acids were separated into different conjugate groups by chromatography on the lipophilic anion exchange gel, diethylaminohydroxypropyl Sephadex LH-20. Quantitatively more than 80% of the bile acids were secreted into bile conjugated to taurine. Unconjugated bile acids and glycine conjugates accounted for 5-10% of the total biliary bile acids. Bile acid sulfates were present only in trace amounts indicating that quantitatively sulfation is not an important pathway in bile acid metabolism during development. Total biliary bile acid concentrations were low (0.1-0.4 mM) when compared to reported values for adult bile (greater than 10 mM). Chenodeoxycholic acid was the major biliary bile acid and exceeded cholic acid concentrations by 1.43-fold indicating either a relative immaturity in 12 alpha-hydroxylase activity during early life or a dominance of alternative pathways for chenodeoxycholic acid synthesis. A relatively large proportion of the biliary bile acids comprised metabolites not found in adult bile. The presence of relatively high proportions of hyocholic acid (often greater than cholic acid) and several 1 beta-hydroxycholanoic acid isomers indicates that C-1 and C-6 hydroxylation are important pathways in bile acid synthesis during development. We describe, for the first time, evidence for the existence of a C-4 hydroxylation pathway in the metabolism of bile acids, which may be unique to early human development. Mass spectrometry was used to confirm the identification of 3 alpha,4 beta,7 alpha-trihydroxy-5 beta-cholanoic and 3 alpha,4 beta-dihydroxy-5 beta-cholanoic acids. Quantitatively, these C-4 hydroxylated bile acids accounted for 5-15% of the total biliary bile acids of the fetus, suggesting that C-4 hydroxylation is quantitatively an important pathway in the bile acid metabolism during early life."
https://openalex.org/W1485407443,"We have induced drug resistance against methotrexate, an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase, and CB3717, an inhibitor of thymidylate synthetase in a strain of Leishmania tarentolae. The drug-resistant strains contain extrachromosomal DNA circles of 68 kilobases with a 30-kilobase inverted duplication flanked by 4- and 5 kilobase unique segments. We show that these circles are highly homologous to the drug-induced H circles of L. tropica (1). All three L. tarentolae strains analyzed contain a chromosomal copy of the H region without duplication, but two of the three strains contain extrachromosomal H circles as well, predominantly present as H circle dimers in one strain and as tetramers in the other. After induction of methotrexate resistance, monomeric circles, presumably derived from the oligomers, become the major type of circle. Our results indicate that the H region represents a genomic region that can be copied at very low frequency to yield circles by a precise, but unusual mechanism under natural conditions in wild-type cells. Although superficially analogous to the episomes of bacteria, the system is without precedent in nature."
https://openalex.org/W1553347455,"Abstract Many of the genes of simple organisms with small genomes are encoded on opposite DNA strands so that the genes either overlap or one gene is nested within another gene (Normark, S., Bergstrom, S., Edlund, T., Grundstrom, T., Jaurin, B., Lindberg, F.P., and Olsson, D. (1983) Annu. Rev. Genet. 17, 499-525; Chen, C., Malone, T., Beckendorf, S.K., and Davis, R.L. Nature (1987) 329, 721-724). In contrast, most of the genes of complex organisms are dispersed in the genome in widely separated locations. Here, we report that the genes for the alpha 1 and alpha 2 chains of human type IV collagen are encoded on opposite DNA strands from loci that are so closely located that they may be separated by as little as 42 base pairs. The results provide the first description of two structural genes from a complex organism that code for two polypeptide chains of the same protein molecule but have overlapping 5'-flanking regions."
https://openalex.org/W1586237384,"A cDNA clone for sapecin, an antibacterial protein produced by an embryonic cell line of Sarcophaga peregrina, was isolated and characterized. This clone was found to encode a precursor of sapecin consisting of 94 residues, with sapecin (40 residues) constituting its carboxyl-terminal half. RNA blot hybridization revealed that the gene for the sapecin precursor is activated in the hemocytes of the third instar larvae of Sarcophaga in response to body injury. Thus, sapecin is probably a defense protein synthesized by Sarcophaga to prevent bacterial infection through the damaged body wall. This gene was also found to be activated in the embryonic and early pupal stages, suggesting that sapecin also plays a role in the ontogenetic processes of Sarcophaga."
https://openalex.org/W1509817645,"Regulated glucose transport is necessary for controlled cellular proliferation. In this communication, we demonstrate that a growth factor, namely platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), regulates expression of the glucose transporter gene. PDGF induced a 1.7-fold increase in both the rate of glucose transport and the amount of membrane-associated glucose transporter protein in mouse fibroblasts 6 h after treatment. This was accompanied by a 5-fold increase in the accumulation of the HepG-2/rat brain glucose transporter mRNA. PDGF induced both an increase in the rate of transcription of the glucose transporter gene and an increase in the stability of its mRNA. This induction could be achieved in the presence of cycloheximide. The glucose transporter is therefore a member of the class of PDGF-inducible genes known as competence genes."
https://openalex.org/W1558439525,"DNA polymerase beta (beta-pol) is a housekeeping enzyme considered to be involved in DNA repair in vertebrate cells. We cloned a fragment of genomic DNA spanning the first two exons of the human beta-pol gene and approximately 11 kilobases of the flanking region. The segment just 5â€² of the transcription start site can direct expression of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene in HeLa cells. A sequence containing only 113 base pairs of flanking DNA has promoter activity, and various constructs containing up to 4.8 kilobases of flanking sequence are expressed at a similar level, indicating that with this assay the important regulatory elements are located within or proximal to the approximately 100-bp core promoter. S1 nuclease mapping was used to show that transcription of the transfected genes is initiated at the same position as the endogenous beta-pol gene. The region upstream of the transcription start site is G + C rich and contains neither CAAT nor TATA boxes, but does have three decanucleotide elements matching high affinity binding sites for the RNA polymerase II transcription factor Sp1. Extending 5â€² from position -39 and surrounded by Sp1 consensus binding elements, there is a 10-nucleotide sequence with perfect dyad symmetry, GTGACGTCAC. Similar sequences are found in a number of cellular and viral promoters, including several adenovirus promoters. Experiments to test whether the core beta-pol promoter is activated by the adenovirus early region products showed that cotransfection with an adenovirus expression plasmid strongly activates expression of the beta-pol promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1597321121,"Human serum albumin binds tightly and noncovalently to a wide variety of hydrophobic bilirubins, including (4Z,15Z)-bilirubin-IX alpha, its dimethyl ester and mono methyl esters, its mono 2-butyl esters and amides, the dimethyl ester of (4Z,15Z)-mesobilirubin-IV alpha, and even (4Z,15Z)-etiobilirubin-IV gamma. The heteroassociation complexes formed from these highly water-insoluble pigments and the protein can be prepared in pH 7.4 aqueous by using a small quantity of dimethyl sulfoxide as amphiphilic carrier. In those solutions the protein acts as a water-soluble chiral complexation agent to induce an asymmetric transformation of the bound pigment. This is recognized by positive chirality, bisignate induced circular dichroism (CD) Cotton effects that fall in the region of the bichromophoric pigment's long wavelength UV-visible absorption band and are characteristic of intramolecular exciton coupling of the bilirubin component pyrromethenone chromophores. The same-signed CD spectra shared by all the pigments of this work indicate selection at the protein binding site for a positive chirality conformer and suggest a common binding site. The CD intensities, which are greatest ([delta epsilon[congruent to 50) for pigments with one or two free carboxyl groups, are consistent with a binding model where one salt linkage plays a major role in the enantioselectivity of the right-handed folded conformation stabilized by inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds."
https://openalex.org/W1504653172,"Electron micrographs of negatively stained and metal-shadowed mitochondrial creatine kinase (Mi-CK) molecules purified as described by Schlegel et al. (Schlegel, J., Zurbriggen, B., Wegmann, E., Wyss, M., Eppenberger, H. M., and Wallimann, T. (1988) J. Biol Chem. 263, 16942-16953) revealed a homogeneous population (greater than or equal to 95%) of distinctly sized square-shaped, octameric particles with a side length of 10 nm that frequently exhibited a pronounced 4-fold axis of symmetry. The cube-like molecules consist of four dimers that are arranged around a stain-accumulating central cavity of 2.5-3 nm in diameter. This interpretation is supported by single particle averaging including correlation analysis by computer. Upon prolonged storage or high dilution, the cube-like octamers tended to dissociate into dimers. Sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium experiments yielded an s value of 12.8-13.5 S and an Mr of 328,000 +/- 25,000 for the octameric cubes. An s value of 5.0 S and a Mr of 83,000 +/- 8,000 was found under conditions which revealed banana-shaped dimers. These dimers proved to be very stable, as their dissociation into monomers of 45 kDa (s value = 2.0 S) required 6 M guanidine HCl. Thus, the oligomeric structures observed in the electron microscope are identified as Mi-CK dimers (banana-shaped structures) and cubical Mi-CK octamers assembled from four Mi-CK dimers. The octameric nature of native Mi-CK and the formation of Mi-CK dimers were confirmed by direct mass measurements of individual molecules by scanning transmission electron microscopy yielding a molecular mass of 340 +/- 55 kDa for the octamer and 89 +/- 27 kDa for the dimer. A structural model of Mi-CK octamers and the possible interaction with ATP/ADP-translocator molecules as well as with the outer mitochondrial membrane is proposed. The implications with respect to the physiological function of Mi-CK as an energy-channeling molecule at the producing side of the phosphoryl creatine shuttle are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1551566993,"Mitochondrial creatine kinase (Mi-CK) from chicken cardiac muscle and brain, recently shown to differ in their N-terminal amino acid sequences and to be encoded by multiple mRNAs (Hossle, H.P., Schlegel, J., Wegmann, G., Wyss, M., Bohlen, P., Eppenberger, H. M., Wallimann, T., and Perriard, J.C. (1988) Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 151, 408-416) were separated on two-dimensional nonequilibrium pH-gradient electrophoresis gels and visualized as two distinct protein spots by immunoblotting. Analysis of the two proteins purified by specific elution from Blue-Sepharose with ADP (Wallimann, T., Zurbriggen, B., and Eppenberger, H. M. (1985) Enzyme 33, 226-231) followed by fast protein liquid chromatography cation exchange chromatography showed obvious differences in peptide maps, in immunological cross-reactivity with monoclonal antibodies, and in kinetic parameters. However, even though the two proteins were different, tissue-specific mitochondrial isoforms, both formed regularly-sized, perforated cube-like octameric structures with Mr of 364,000 +/- 25,000 and 352,000 +/- 20,000 for the cardiac and brain isoform, respectively. Electron microscopy of cardiac and brain Mi-CK octamers revealed cube-like molecules with a central cavity or transverse channel filled by negative stain. The octameric molecular structure of Mi-CK isoforms differs from the generally accepted dimeric arrangement of cytosolic muscle MM- and brain BB-CK."
https://openalex.org/W1606989763,"The uptake of iron from transferrin by isolated rat hepatocytes and rat reticulocytes has been compared. The results show the following. 1) Reticulocytes and hepatocytes express plasma membrane NADH:ferricyanide oxidoreductase activity. The activity, expressed per 10(6) cells, is approximately 60-fold higher in the hepatocyte than in the reticulocyte. 2) Hepatocyte plasma membrane NADH:ferricyanide oxidoreductase activity and uptake of iron from transferrin are stimulated by low oxygen concentration and inhibited by iodoacetate. In reticulocytes, similar changes are seen in NADH:ferricyanide oxidoreductase activity, but not on iron uptake. 3) Ferricyanide inhibits the uptake of iron from transferrin by hepatocytes, but has no effect on iron uptake by reticulocytes. 4) Perturbants of endocytosis and endosomal acidification have no inhibitory effect on hepatocyte iron uptake, but inhibit reticulocyte iron uptake. 5) Hydrophilic iron chelators effectively inhibit hepatocyte iron uptake, but have no effect on reticulocyte iron uptake. Hydrophobic iron chelators generally inhibit both hepatocyte and reticulocyte iron uptake. 6) Divalent metal cations with ionic radii similar to or less than the ferrous iron ion are effective inhibitors of hepatocyte iron uptake with no effect on reticulocyte iron uptake. The results are compatible with hepatocyte uptake of iron from transferrin by a reductive process at the cell surface and reticulocyte iron uptake by receptor-mediated endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1520800548,"Light chain phosphorylation causes the folded monomeric form of myosin to extend and assemble into filaments. This observation established the involvement of the 20-kDa regulatory light chain (LC20) in conformational transitions of smooth muscle myosin. To further assess the role of this subunit in the intramolecular folding of myosin, LC20 was removed from turkey gizzard myosin at elevated temperatures in the presence of EDTA through the use of an antibody affinity column. Metal-shadowed images showed that LC20-deficient myosin had a tendency to aggregate through the neck region. When MgATP was added to filaments formed from this myosin, less than 10% of the myosin was solubilized, indicating that myosin could not fold in the absence of light chain. Readdition of native regulatory light chain restored the myosin to its original solubility properties, thus establishing reversibility. Addition of foreign light chains from skeletal muscle myosin or a chymotryptic-cleaved gizzard light chain produced the same amount of monomeric myosin in high salt that was obtained by recombination with the homologous light chain. However, the ability of the hybrid myosins to assume the folded conformation was impaired, and only a partially folded species was obtained. Single-headed myosin, like rod and light chain-deficient myosin, remained filamentous in the presence of MgATP. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the regulatory light chain in the neck region of myosin contributes to a binding site for the myosin tail."
https://openalex.org/W2123057651,"Aphrodisin is a protein which is secreted in hamster vaginal discharge and acts via the vomeronasal organ of the accessory olfactory system to elicit copulatory behavior in male hamsters. The complete primary structure of aphrodisin was determined by sequence analysis of intact aphrodisin after unblocking the amino terminus with pyroglutamate aminopeptidase and from peptides generated by trypsin and Lys-C digests. Alignment of the peptides was obtained from sequence analysis of peptides from cyanogen bromide and hydroxylamine cleavages. The protein consists of 151 residues of Mr = 17,000. It has disulfide bonds linking cysteine residues at positions 38 and 42 and at 57 and 149. N-acetylglucosamine residues are linked to asparagines at positions 41 and 69.

The hydroxyacids that have been found to be substrates for this enzyme are gamma-hydroxybutyrate, D-alpha-hydroxyglutarate, and L-beta-hydroxybutyrate. The oxoacids that are the best substrates for this enzyme are alpha-ketoglutarate and succinic semialdehyde; alpha-ketoadipate and oxalacetate are also substrates. This enzyme is located in the mitochondrial fraction of the cell and is not dependent on added NAD+ or NADP+."
https://openalex.org/W1560980146,"Extrachromosomal DNA elements have been identified in wild-type populations of the parasitic protozoan Leishmania. Elements from L. major and L. tropica were detected using orthogonal-field-alternation-gel electrophoresis. They are nonhomologous, supercoiled circular DNA molecules derived from different chromosomes in the Leishmania genome. Electron microscopy revealed that the elements have very similar physical properties; both are 80-kilobase supercoiled DNA molecules that contain large inverted repeat structures. The extrachromosomal DNAs are amplified in the Leishmania populations and show a fluctuation in copy number, from undetectable to around 20 copies per cell. After exposure of the L. tropica population to the drug methotrexate (MTX), a second amplified DNA was observed that is homologous to the extrachromosomal DNA found in L. major. Furthermore, wild-type Leishmania populations containing extrachromosomal DNA adapt more readily to MTX selection than populations with no amplified DNA. From these observations, there appears to be a relationship between the presence of extrachromosomal elements in wild-type Leishmania and the genesis and maintenance of MTX resistance in these organisms."
https://openalex.org/W1506746400,"We have investigated the kinetic mechanism of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) N-methyltransferase purified from rat liver using PE, phosphatidyl-N-monomethylethanolamine (PMME), and phosphatidyl-N,N-dimethylethanolamine (PDME) as substrates. We previously reported (Ridgway, N. D., and Vance, D. E. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 17231-17239) that initial velocity curves with PE, PMME, and PDME at a fixed concentration of Triton X-100 were sigmoidal, thus generating nonlinear inverse plots. Comparison with other integral membrane enzymes suggested this response resulted from the enzyme's requirement for a complete boundary layer of phospholipid. Hence, the effect of a nonsubstrate phospholipid on initial velocity patterns for PE, PMME, and PDME was examined. The sigmoidicity of initial velocity curves at constant Triton X-100 concentration and increasing PE, PMME, and PDME were converted to the more familiar hyperbolic response by the addition of egg phosphatidylcholine (PC). Hill coefficients for PE, PMME, and PDME at a fixed Triton concentration were 3.6, 2.5, and 4.7, respectively, but with the addition of 30 or 40 mol % of egg PC, coefficients were close to unity (0.9-1.2). The activation by egg PC of PE, PMME, and PDME methylation indicates that a secondary phospholipid binding site(s) plays a role in catalysis in mixed micelles. This site(s) may represent a transmembrane segment(s) in close association with a boundary layer of phospholipid. Kinetic analysis of initial velocity and product inhibition patterns for PMME and PDME methylation fit an ordered Bi Bi mechanism. Phospholipid substrates and products were the first to bind and the last to dissociate from the active site, respectively. As well, PE, PMME, and PDME compete for a single active site. The overall kinetic scheme for the methylation of PE to PC in mixed micelles involves the initial binding of PE, followed by successive steps where S-adenosyl-L-methionine is bound, the sulfonium methyl group is transferred, and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine is released."
https://openalex.org/W1563881139,"Recent reports have suggested that the majority of the molecular traffic through the Golgi apparatus is comprised of recycling, rather than newly synthesized, molecules. To evaluate the importance of this recycling pathway in greater detail, we examined the internalization and recycling of cell surface glycoproteins on EL-4 cells, a murine T-cell lymphoma, using sialic acids as covalent markers. Sialic acids were removed from the surface of living cells by exhaustive treatment with Vibrio cholerae sialidase at 4 degrees C and shown to be derived primarily from glycoproteins (93%), with only a small amount from glycolipids (7%). Cells were recultured at 37 degrees C over time and monitored for the resialylation of the cell surface using a sensitive high pressure liquid chromatography adaptation of the thiobarbituric acid assay for sialic acids. The return of sialic acid to the cell surface was found to be contingent upon de novo protein synthesis indicating that the bulk of plasma membrane sialoglycoconjugates do not recycle to an endogenous sialyltransferase-containing compartment for oligosaccharide reprocessing. Identical results were found for K562 cells, a human erythroleukemia cell line. The movement of specific glycoproteins was followed using the enzyme rat liver alpha 2-6Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc sialyltransferase together with CMP-[3H]NeuAc as an impermeant probe of the cell surface. Surface sialoglycoproteins were internalized slowly, a process unaffected by cycloheximide treatment. Only a few of these internalized glycoproteins were found to return to a trans-Golgi compartment followed by recycling to the cell surface. Taken together, these data indicate that the majority of replacement of sialic acids on the cell surface is due to de novo synthesis of glycoproteins and that only a small number of glycoproteins recycle through a trans-Golgi compartment."
https://openalex.org/W1586494288,"The specificity of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) N-methyltransferase for molecular species of PE has been investigated. Phosphatidylcholine (PC), synthesized by incubation of [methyl-3H]S-adenosyl-L-methionine with microsomes or pure enzyme (Ridgway, N. D., and Vance, D. E. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 17231-17239) plus microsomal PE, had a distribution of methyl label in molecular species similar to the mole percent distribution of molecular species in the precursor PE. A similar lack of specificity was observed with PE that was synthesized from egg PC by transphosphatidylation with phospholipase D. Phosphatidyl-N-monomethylethanolamine (PMME) and phosphatidyl-N,N-dimethylethanolamine (PDME), both with the acyl composition of egg PC, were methylated by the pure enzyme and showed a distribution of labeled molecular species in PDME and PC, respectively, similar to the mole percent distribution of egg PC. Results with synthetic PEs and pure methyltransferase showed higher rates of methylation with more unsaturated species. Long chain saturated PEs (e.g. dipalmitoyl-PE) were not methylated by the enzyme. Maximal methylation rates were obtained with two or more double bonds in the substrate PE. Rates of methylation of the saturated and monoenoic PEs could be enhanced when 40 mol % polyunsaturated-rich microsomal PC was included in the mixed micelles. PC isolated from primary cultures of rat hepatocytes pulsed with [methyl-3H]methionine was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Initially, the labeling pattern of PC molecular species varied slightly from that of total hepatocyte PE and hepatocyte microsomal PE. 1-Palmitoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-PC had the highest specific activity at the end of the pulse and was preferentially labeled relative to the mole percent distribution of hepatocyte PE molecular species. During the 24-h chase period both the percent distribution of label and specific activity of this species of PC declined. In the same time period, there was a corresponding increase in specific activity and percent distribution of label in 1-palmitoyl and 1-stearoyl species with linoleate and arachidonate in the sn-2 position."
https://openalex.org/W1487821657,"A one-step purification method for halorhodopsin was developed. Functional proteoliposomes were prepared from this preparation using cholate, which is removed by dialysis in the presence of asolectin or the polar halobacterial lipids. Light-induced outward directed transport of chloride by halorhodopsin was followed by measuring passive proton efflux in the presence of uncoupler; initial rates and extents amounted to significant fractions of values obtained for halorhodopsin-containing cell envelope vesicles. The transport activity was much higher when cholate rather than octyl glucoside was used in the reconstitution. Since CD spectra in cholate but not in octyl glucoside showed band-splitting in the visible region, suggestive of exciton interaction between halorhodopsin monomers, the reconstitution may depend on an aggregate state of the halorhodopsin. The rate constants for three thermal steps in the halorhodopsin photocycle were greatly reduced in the detergent-solubilized samples, but they increased in the proteoliposomes to values similar to those for halorhodopsin in cell envelope vesicles. Thus, the reconstitution yields halorhodopsin with both photochemical and transport activities restored. Freeze-fracture electron micrographs of the proteoliposomes showed unilammellar liposomes with numerous particles of 100-150 A diameter at the fracture faces. These should correspond to halorhodopsin aggregates, formed in the bilayer in an apparently concentration-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W1518160992,"Deletion analysis of the 5â€² flank of the Chinese hamster dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) gene reveals a promoter region starting 48 base pairs upstream of the major transcriptional start site. A dhfr minigene containing approximately 900 base pairs of 5â€² flank and one small intron was used as a wild-type standard. Seven deletions were created with BAL-31. Promoter activity was measured in three ways: 1) transient expression of the dhfr gene; 2) frequence of transfection of dhfr- Chinese hamster cells to a dhfr+ phenotype; and 3) RNase protection analysis of dhfr transcripts in pooled populations of permanently transfected cells. The transient expression assay was developed in this work for the rapid analysis of dhfr promoter mutants; this assay could be of general use for analyzing constructs carrying dhfr as a reporter gene. Two of the deletions define a requirement for part or all of the sequence GGGCGT located 48 base pairs upstream of the major transcriptional start site. This site has been shown to bind transcription factor Sp1 in the mouse dhfr gene. The function of the major promoter is independent of the function of the minor promoter. These minigene constructs also contain cryptic promoters located upstream of the natural start sites, probably in the plasmid vector. Transcripts originating from these upstream sites are inefficiently spliced, but do result in messenger RNA molecules that are translated into active dihydrofolate reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1535618293,"12-Hydroperoxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (12-HPETE), a lipoxygenase product, simulates the synaptic responses produced by the modulatory transmitter, histamine, and the neuroactive peptide, Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-amide (FMRFamide), in identified neurons of the marine mollusk, Aplysia californica (Piomelli, D., Shapiro, E., Feinmark, S. J., and Schwartz, J. H. (1987) J. Neurosci. 7, 3675-3886; Shapiro, E., Piomelli, D., Feinmark, S., Vogel, S., Chin, G., and Schwartz, J. H. (1988) Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 53, in press). The 12-lipoxygenase pathway has not yet been fully characterized, but 12-HPETE is known to be metabolized further. We therefore began to search for other metabolites in order to investigate whether the actions of 12-HPETE might require its conversion to other active products. Here we report the identification of 12-keto-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (12-KETE), a metabolite of 12-HPETE formed by Aplysia nervous tissue. This product was identified in incubations of the tissue with arachidonic acid using high performance liquid chromatography, UV spectrometry, and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. [3H]12-KETE was formed from endogenous lipid stores in nervous tissue, labeled by incubation with [3H]arachidonic acid, when stimulated by application of histamine. In L14 and L10 cells, identified neurons in the abdominal ganglion, applications of 12-KETE elicit changes in membrane potential similar to those evoked by histamine. 12(S)-Hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid, another metabolite of 12-HPETE, is inactive. These results support the hypothesis that 12-HPETE and its metabolite, 12-KETE, participate in transduction of histamine responses in Aplysia neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1776128767,"Abstract The kinetics of ATP hydrolysis and tension responses were studied simultaneously in a permeabilized preparation of cardiac tissue of the guinea pig. This was achieved by combining laserflash photolysis of P3-1-(2-nitrophenyl)ethyladenosine 5'-triphosphate (caged-ATP) and a rapid freezing technique. In the presence of calcium ions, tension increased following the photolytic production of ATP with a half-time of 0.3 s. The timecourse of ATP hydrolysis consisted of an initial rapid phase followed by a steady-state hydrolysis rate of 0.4 s-1, indicating that the rate-limiting step of the ATPase in isometric fibers is slower and subsequent to the nucleotide hydrolysis step: the isometric steady state intermediate is probably an actomyosin-ADP complex. In the absence of calcium ions, rigor tension decreased upon the photolytic production of ATP with a half-time of 0.45 s. The time course of ATP hydrolysis was biphasic with a rapid initial phase of ATP hydrolysis, followed by a steady-state hydrolysis rate which was too slow to measure over the time scale of these experiments (less than 0.04 s-1). A comparison of the results obtained in this study with those reported for rabbit skeletal muscle reveals qualitative similarities between cardiac and skeletal muscle and also quantitative differences in their physiological and kinetic behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2141966916,"Human transferrin receptor (tfR) is a covalent homodimer of 90-kDa transmembrane subunits, which transits an endocytotic pathway involving exposure to low pH. Digestion of purified tfR at neutral pH generates a soluble noncovalent dimer of 70-kDa fragment subunits containing 95% of the extracellular tfR sequence, including the transferrin binding sites. Below pH 6, the 70-kDa fragment undergoes a conformational transition, which causes reversible association of the dimers in solution. Transferrin binding prevents both the conformational transition and the self-association. We suggest that tfR clustering in acidic compartments results from self-association due to a conformational change that is sensitive to transferrin binding. This and other observations support a concentration mechanism based on interactions between ectodomains in intracellular lumina."
https://openalex.org/W1516305795,"We have isolated cDNA clones for rat liver uricase using an oligonucleotide corresponding to the N-terminal sequence of 8 amino acids. The nucleotide sequences of the cDNAs have been determined, and the amino acid sequence of the protein deduced. A 867-base open reading frame coding for 289 amino acids, corresponding to a molecular mass of 33,274 daltons, was confirmed by matching eight sequences of a total of 53 amino acids from peptide sequence analyses of the fragments generated by lysyl endopeptidase digestion of purified rat liver uricase. The deduced amino acid sequence of rat liver uricase shares 40% homology with that of soybean nodulin-specific uricase and has an N-terminal extension of 7 amino acids. In contrast, soybean uricase has a C-terminal extension of 12 amino acids, which is presumably the result of local gene duplication. Completely different N- and C-terminal structures of the two uricases suggest that the signals for targeting the proteins to the peroxisome are not located on the terminal continuous stretches of amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W1575004669,"Receptor-mediated endocytosis involves the transport of receptor-ligand complexes from the cell surface to an intracellular endocytic compartment. This study shows that plasma membrane-derived vesicles containing receptor-bound ligands (e.g. aggregated anti-dinitrophenol (DNP) IgG bound to Fc receptors) fuse with early endosomes containing DNP-beta-glucuronidase in a cell-free system. Plasma membrane vesicles were generated by homogenization of cells that had been allowed to bind ligands at 4 degrees C. Fusion between vesicles containing the two probes was assessed by (i) the formation of anti-DNP IgG-DNP-beta-glucuronidase complexes and (ii) the colocalization within closed vesicles of two different sizes of colloidal gold coated with ligands. Fusion required ATP, cytosol, and KCl. The requirements were similar to those described for endosome-endosome fusion in in vitro systems. Mild trypsinization of vesicles prior to their addition to the assay inhibited fusion. When DNP-beta-glucuronidase was chased into more mature endocytic compartments, fusion was not observed. The results indicate that cell surface regions involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis are capable of fusing to early endosomes. This fusion event may constitute the first step in the transport of ligands to an intracellular endocytic compartment."
https://openalex.org/W1492498680,"Abstract Although several pathways contribute to the catabolism of L-cysteine, the products formed are few--taurine + CO2 and pyruvate + ammonia + sulfate. L-Cysteinesulfinate is a key intermediate that is either decarboxylated to ultimately yield taurine or transaminated to yield pyruvate. There is strong evidence that pyruvate is also formed by several cysteinesulfinate-independent pathways collectively referred to as cysteine desulfhydrase. The quantitative importance of cysteinesulfinate-independent pathways of taurine synthesis is less clear, but it has been suggested that taurine synthesis from the cysteamine released during phosphopantetheine and CoASH turnover accounts for the high taurine content of tissues with very low levels of cysteinesulfinate decarboxylase activity (e.g. skeletal muscle and heart). In the present studies, the metabolic flux through each of these pathways was quantitated in vivo by monitoring the formation of respiratory 14CO2 in mice administered L-[1-14C]- or L-[3-14C]cyst(e)ine. Mice given 0.05 mmol/kg of L-cystine or 0.5 or 2.5 mmol/kg of L-cysteine catabolize 35, 51, and 72% of the dose, respectively, in 6 h; the relative contribution of taurine synthesis to total catabolism decreases from 63 to 51 to 42% as the L-cyst(e)ine dose is increased. To evaluate the role of L-cysteinesulfinate in taurine synthesis, D-cysteinesulfinate was characterized and used as a metabolism-resistant, potent, and specific inhibitor of cysteinesulfinate decarboxylase. Studies with L-[1-14C]- and L-[3-14C]cysteine in the presence of inhibitor indicate that 85-93% of taurine synthesis occurs from L-cysteinesulfinate: the calculated contribution of the phosphopantetheine pathway is small and may approximate zero. L-Cysteinesulfinate transmamination accounts for 25% of pyruvate synthesis from L-[14C]cystine (0.05 mmol/kg) but only 11% of pyruvate synthesis from L-[14C]cysteine (2.5 mmol/kg). Cysteine desulfhydrase reactions account for most of the pyruvate synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1568569367,"Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency in humans is one cause of severe combined immunodeficiency disease. Single base mutations affecting the ADA protein have been identified for both alleles of the ADA-deficient cell line GM2606 and for one allele of the ADA-deficient cell line GM2825A. One allele of GM2606 has a mutation altering amino acid 101 from Arg to Trp, and the other allele has a mutation altering amino acid 211 from Arg to His. As previously reported, one ADA allele of GM2825A has a single base mutation changing Ala-329 to Val-329, and the other allele has a mutation which eliminates exon 4 from the mature mRNA. Sequence analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified GM2825A DNA showed a single base change of A to G within the invariant bases of the 3' splice site of intron 3 that can account for the mis-splicing of exon 4. To test the effect on ADA catalytic activity of these mutations and the mutations previously found in the ADA-deficient line GM2756, expression vectors containing normal and mutant ADA-coding sequences under transcriptional regulation of the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat were constructed and transfected into human fibroblasts. All transfected cells had levels of ADA mRNA 15-25 times higher than the endogenous ADA message. Yet, cells transfected with the normal ADA-coding sequences had ADA enzymatic levels 40 times higher than cells transfected with any of the mutant ADA sequences. This analysis demonstrates that while the mutant ADA-coding sequences are transcribed, they do not encode a functional ADA protein."
https://openalex.org/W1603290827,"A mutant calmodulin, in which phenylalanine 99 of calcium binding site III was changed to a tryptophan by using cassette-based, site-directed mutagenesis, has been used to analyze the mechanism of calcium binding. The combined study of direct calcium binding, modification of tryptophan fluorescence properties upon calcium binding, and terbium titration allows some discrimination among proposed mechanisms of cation binding to calmodulin. Calmodulin appears to have six cation binding sites, four of which are selective for calcium, that seem to be coupled. Under a given set of conditions, these calcium-selective sites are not identical. In addition to providing insight into the mechanisms of calcium modulation of calmodulin, these studies demonstrate the feasibility of using isofunctional, tryptophan-containing mutants of proteins to gain insight into protein-ligand interaction."

Both crystals are monoclinic P2(1), with unit cell dimensions a = 90.3 A, b = 82.9 A, c = 73.4 A, beta = 122.5 degrees for the native Fab and a = 63.9 A, b = 73.0 A, c = 49.1 A, beta = 120.6 degrees for the complex. The peptide sequence corresponds to residues 100-108 of all influenza virus hemagglutinins (HA1) of the H3 subtype (1968-1987).

Knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the complex will elucidate the details of how anti-peptide antibodies recognize a small peptide antigen and provide insights into the recognition of the same sequence in the intact protein antigen. As both native Fab and the peptide-Fab complex have been crystallized, we can also determine in addition whether changes in the structure of the antibody accompany antigen binding. The nucleotide sequence of the mRNA coding region of the anti-peptide Fab has been determined to provide the amino acid sequence ultimately required for the high resolution three-dimensional structure determination."

https://openalex.org/W1522094478,"We have studied the transcription of the argininosuccinate synthetase gene in cultured RPMI 2650 cells under conditions where the enzyme is subject to metabolite regulation and in canavanine-resistant variants (Canr1 cells) which overproduce the enzyme greater than 200-fold. When grown continuously in medium with citrulline substituted for arginine, the argininosuccinate synthetase activity of RPMI 2650 cells increases 5- to 10-fold. In these cells, expression of a transfected minigene containing the 5â€²-flanking region of the argininosuccinate synthetase gene was increased 20-fold by short term starvation for arginine and 10-fold by short term starvation for leucine. Levels of nuclear RNA from the first intron of the gene correlated with enzyme activity; i.e. RPMI 2650 cells cultured in arginine medium less than RPMI 2650 cells cultured in citrulline medium less than Canr1 cells. Run-off transcription experiments showed that the transcription of argininosuccinate synthetase increased in RPMI 2650 cells starved for either arginine or leucine. While expression of the minigene and the transcription rate for argininosuccinate synthetase were increased during 48 to 72 h of starvation, the endogenous enzyme activity did not increase in RPMI 2650 cells. Amino acid starvation did not affect the rate of transcription of argininosuccinate synthetase in Canr1 cells. The results indicate that the steady state levels of argininosuccinate synthetase expression in Canr1 cells and in citrulline-adapted RPMI 2650 cells are largely determined by the rate of transcription. The failure of increased transcription rate to correlate with increased enzyme activity during acute starvation for arginine or leucine may suggest the involvement of post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms for argininosuccinate synthetase or may merely be due to amino acid deprivation. The finding that leucine starvation has effects similar to arginine starvation raises the question of whether mammalian cells have general control mechanisms which are similar to the general control of amino acid biosynthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae."
https://openalex.org/W1503198992,"Accurate transcription by RNA polymerase II has been shown to require multiple factors which participate in a number of intermediate steps prior to initiation. The last detectable step before initiation is the formation of an activated or rapid start complex which is template-associated. In this study we used two phenotypically distinguishable forms of mammalian RNA polymerase II to examine the requirement for specific factors in the formation of the activated complex. RNA polymerase II was purified from a mutant cell line which was resistant to levels of alpha-amanitin that are toxic for normal cells. When added to a polymerase-dependent transcription system consisting of HeLa factors and adenovirus DNA, the mutant polymerase accurately transcribed the template in an amanitin-resistant fashion. This amanitin-resistant transcription was competitively inhibited when wild-type polymerase was also added to the system. Preincubation of amanitin-resistant polymerase with DNA and factors produced a polymerase-associated complex, defined by its resistance to exchange for the amanitin-sensitive polymerase. Complex formation required the presence of polymerase, DNA, and the HeLa factors during the preincubation but did not require the presence of nucleotides. Complexes were template-associated, as shown by their inability to exchange onto a second template. Thus, prior to initiation, RNA polymerase II forms a stable association with the DNA template in an activated complex."
https://openalex.org/W1590073393,"The Spec1 and Spec2 proteins of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus are related to calmodulin, troponin C, and myosin light chains by sequence similarity in their four calcium binding domains. These domains, the EF-hands, are distinct helix-loop-helix structures of about 40 amino acids. The Spec1 and Spec2 genes are expressed specifically in aboral ectoderm cells of the developing embryo; however, the function of the Spec proteins in these cells is unknown. To find conserved regions of the proteins that might be important for structure and function, Spec homologues from Lytechinus pictus, a distantly related sea urchin, were sought. L. pictus embryos do not synthesize detectable amounts of the 14,000-17,000-Da Spec proteins as determined by two-dimensional gel electro-phoresis, but do synthesize three 34,000-Da proteins that cross-react with Spec1 antibodies and display a similar ontogenetic pattern of expression. cDNA clones were isolated by hybridization to a synthetic oligonucleotide corresponding to the EF-hand. One clone, LpS1, encodes an mRNA with developmental properties like those of the S. purpuratus Spec mRNAs. However, LpS1 contains an open reading frame for a protein of 34,000 Da rather than 17,000 Da, and antibodies raised against part of the LpS1 reading frame demonstrate that LpS1 encodes a 34,000-Da protein in L. pictus embryos. The sequence of LpS1 reveals the presence of eight EF-hand domains, which share structural homology with the Spec1 or Spec2 EF-hands; however, little else in the protein sequence is conserved. The results support the hypothesis that the LpS1 gene arose from a duplication of an ancestral Spec gene and that the overall structural features of the Spec family of proteins are more conserved than the amino acid sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1521810753,"Tryptic digestion of the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes in sucrose but not NaCl buffer leads to complete loss of ryanodine binding capacity. The presence of MgCl2 in the sucrose buffer prevents the loss of ryanodine binding by the trypsin treatment. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the treated membranes reveal that the 400-kDa protein band disappeared under all the different digestion conditions. However, the presence of 135-kDa tryptic fragment is observed only when ryanodine binding is retained. Quantitative analysis of the gels shows that the loss of ryanodine binding is well correlated with the cleavage of the 135-kDa tryptic fragment. This correlation is obtained when the cleavage was controlled either by the digestion time or by NaCl or MgCl2 concentrations. The same concentrations of MgCl2 and NaCl affect the ryanodine binding activity, the cleavage of the 135-kDa tryptic fragment, and the solubility and stability of the [3H]ryanodine-receptor complex in a detergent-containing medium. Tryptic digestion of the ryanodine receptor/junctional Ca2+ release channel, which leads to complete loss of ryanodine binding capacity, has no effect or slightly stimulates the Ca2+ accumulation activity of these membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1604554550,"We have recently isolated a full-length cDNA clone for a membrane glycoprotein with apparent Mr of 110,000, denoted gp110, that is expressed in rat liver, kidney, small intestine, and lung. Analysis of the amino acid sequence derived from cDNA sequencing demonstrated that there is a highly hydrophobic domain at the amino terminus (amino acid residues 1-29) that looks like the amino-terminal signal sequence. Using in vitro transcription and translation systems, we have expressed the full-length gp110 cDNA transcript, as well as transcripts derived from truncated gp110 cDNA that terminate translation at different sites. As expected, the amino-terminal signal sequence can promote the translocation across microsomal membranes of the downstream sequence. Like most translocations, the cotranslational translocation of the downstream sequence initiated by the gp110 amino-terminal signal sequence is mediated by signal recognition particle and docking protein. Unlike most amino-terminal signal sequences of lysosomal, secretory, and membrane proteins, the amino-terminal signal sequence of gp110 is not cleaved and may be involved in anchoring the polypeptide to the membrane. We, therefore, predict that the membrane orientation of gp110 is of type II with an extremely small amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain (6 residues)."
https://openalex.org/W1547523843,"Abstract The toxin alpha-sarcin specifically cuts 28 S rRNA at a single position 393 nucleotides from its 3' end in isolated rat liver polysomes, provided the ribosomes are pretreated with EDTA or puromycin (Endo, Y. & Wool, I. G. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 9054-9060). In addition, alpha-sarcin behaves as a purine-specific RNase on deproteinized RNA, cleaving on the 3' side of purines in both single- and double-stranded RNA (Endo, Y., Huber, P. W., and Wool, I. G. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 2662-2667). Since alpha-sarcin does not readily enter tissue culture cells, we have injected it into Xenopus oocytes in order to determine whether the toxin cleaves after all purines or if it specifically makes a single cut in 28 S rRNA in intact cells. We report here that in oocytes alpha-sarcin specifically cuts 28 S rRNA 377 nucleotides from its 3' end, even when used at concentrations that would degrade deproteinized RNA. alpha-Sarcin does not behave as a general nuclease when injected into Xenopus oocytes nor does it operate by another means such as initiating proteolytic digestion of endogenous oocyte proteins. We demonstrate that injected alpha-sarcin causes a rapid decline in oocyte protein synthesis for soluble cytoplasmic proteins, similar in effect to injection of cycloheximide or puromycin."
https://openalex.org/W1504554298,"Specific chemical cleavage of diphtheria toxin with hydroxylamine was performed to remove peptides of 10 and 7 kDa from the carboxyl terminus. The resulting modified proteins of 51 and 48 kDa (HA51DT and HA48DT, respectively) were purified and characterized with respect to structural and biological properties. The 51-kDa toxin binds to ATP-agarose, as does intact diphtheria toxin, while HA48DT does not bind to the nucleotide matrix. Neither modified toxin binds to the membranes of diptheria toxin-sensitive cells, and, consequently, neither is toxic. However, when covalently linked to a membrane binding moiety, both HA51DT and HA48DT are toxic. Cell-killing ability during a short exposure time indicated that concanavalin A (Con A) derivatives of diphtheria toxin and HA51DT are equally toxic, ConA HA48DT being somewhat less toxic, while the conjugate of ConA to A-chain kills a small number of cells only at inordinately high concentration (1 microM). We have thus separated the cell membrane binding function of diphtheria toxin from its membrane permeation function by removing specific small peptides from the carboxyl terminus. These modified toxins may have applications in the preparation of highly potent hybrid toxins."

https://openalex.org/W1535625287,"The intracellular concentrations of polyphosphoinositides and inositol phosphates were determined, and their role in growth factor-initiated cell division was investigated in a Chinese hamster ovary cell inositol auxotroph (CHO-K1-Ins). Metabolic labeling experiments during inositol starvation of CHO-K1-Ins cells showed that 1) the lipid-linked inositol component was maintained at the expense of the soluble inositol pool, 2) the decreasing cellular content of phosphatidylinositol was replaced by phosphatidylglycerol, and 3) the concentrations of inositol polyphosphates and polyphosphoinositides were conserved at the expense of inositol and phosphatidylinositol. These data show that homeostatic mechanisms exist for the maintenance of the polyphosphoinositide and inositol phosphate pools at the expense of inositol and phosphatidylinositol. The addition of alpha-thrombin to growth-arrested (serum-starved) CHO-K1-Ins cells stimulated the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA to the same extent as that observed following serum readdition. gamma-Thrombin was also an effective mitogen, but active site-inhibited alpha-thrombin was not. Both alpha- and gamma-thrombin, but not catalytic site-inhibited alpha-thrombin, initiated phosphatidylinositol turnover in vivo and increased phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate phospholipase C activity in vitro. Serum and insulin were potent CHO-K1-Ins cell mitogens, but neither triggered phosphatidylinositol turnover in vivo nor activated phospholipase C in vitro. The activation of phospholipase C plays a determinant role in thrombin-initiated cell cycle progression in Chinese hamster ovary cells, although other growth factor-signaling pathways exist that are independent of polyphosphoinositide catabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1558099557,"Crystals were produced from variant surface glycoproteins (VSG) of Trypanosoma brucei brucei antigenic variants MITat 1.2, 1.6, and ILTat 1.22, 1.23, 1.24, 1.25, and 1.26. Purified VSGs had molecular weights from 60,000 to 68,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, whereas the crystals obtained were composed of polypeptides of approximate Mr 40,000-50,000. Amino-terminal amino acid sequences determined from the crystallized VSGs were identical to sequences obtained from the respective intact proteins, indicating that the crystals contained VSG amino-terminal fragments. Crystallization conditions and lattice dimensions of the crystals are given."
https://openalex.org/W1523367591,"The first branch point in gluconeogenesis occurs at the conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate. To determine the amount of lactate carbon reaching glucose via the direct pyruvate carboxylase pathway versus the tricarboxylic acid cycle, adult rat hepatocytes in primary culture were incubated for 2 h with one of the following isotopic substrates: [1-14C]lactate, [U-14C]lactate, or [1,2-14C]acetate. Production of 14CO2 and [14C]glucose from each substrate was assessed. The amount of lactate carbon 2 and 3 incorporated into glucose or oxidized to CO2 was determined by subtracting values using [1-14C]lactate from those using [U-14C]lactate. After quantitation of CO2 formed from carbons 2 and 3 of lactate, the amount of these carbons incorporated into glucose via the tricarboxylic acid cycle can be determined by simple proportionality from the ratio of label incorporated into glucose or CO2 from [1,2-14C]acetate. The remaining carbons 2 and 3 of lactate incorporated into glucose are derived from the pyruvate carboxylase pathway directly. Ethanol which on oxidation provides NADH and acetate decreased lactate oxidation and enhanced the pyruvate carboxylase pathway. Glucagon increased carbon flux through both pathways but primarily through the pyruvate carboxylase pathway. In summary, a simple model is presented to examine carbon flux from lactate via the pyruvate carboxylase and tricarboxylic acid pathways during gluconeogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1499844680,"The enzymatic characteristics of a protein kinase purified from thylakoids are further described. ATP (KM approximately 30 microM) and Mg2+ ion (greater than 1.0 mM) were required for activity, while ADP was a competitive inhibitor (Ki = 100 microM). Activity was 55% inhibited by the sulfhydryl inhibitor p-chloromercuribenzoate (1 mM) and was less sensitive to substituted maleimides. Lysine-rich histones (H1) were utilized as an exogenous phosphorylation substrate both by thylakoid-bound kinase and by isolated enzyme; threonine was predominantly phosphorylated by the in situ enzyme, whereas the isolated enzyme phosphorylated closely related serine residues as determined by peptide mapping. Detergents that proved useful in extracting the kinase from thylakoids markedly inhibited activity of the isolated enzyme, whereas Triton X-100 and 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonic acid had little effect. The enzyme could be freed from detergent and behaved as an active monomer on size-exclusion chromatography. The phosphate contents of the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein complex of photosystem II isolated from maximally phosphorylated thylakoid membranes of spinach and pea were equivalent to approximately 6% and approximately 19% phosphorylation, respectively. Corresponding values for nonphosphorylated membranes were approximately 3% and approximately 14.5%."
