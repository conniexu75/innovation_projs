https://openalex.org/W2048501570,"In male swordtails ((Xiphophorus nigrensis)) there are three size classes that derive from allelic variation at the pituitary locus on the Y chromosome. Progeny analysis and preference tests suggest that females prefer to mate with larger males. In the closely related X. pygmaeus, there is no allelic variation at this locus; this species consists of males similar in size only to smaller X. nigrensis males. In addition to being smaller than most X. nigrensis males, these X.pygmaeus males also lack both the swordtail and a major component of the courtship display common in most X. nigrensis males. Usually, female X. pygmaeus prefer to mate with heterospecific males rather than conspecifics, regardless of body size and the presence of a swordtail. However, the smallest X. nigrensis males lack the same courtship component as do the X. pygmaeus males, and in this comparison female X. pygmaeus show no preference. Although sexual selection, through its action on divergence of courtship displays, has been implicated as a factor leading to speciation, in this case sexual selection could lead to the congealing of gene pools between heterospecifics."

The chapter further discusses the future development of conventional power as it affects the prospects of atomic energy and identifies the areas in nuclear power in which the major improvements may be expected. The results are undoubtedly favorable to much more extensive use of atomic power. Nuclear power must necessarily undergo that filtering mechanism that allows only few innovations to become commercial products. This mechanism of selection has a powerful economic component, which depends upon the interpretations of the cost structure made by the builder of the equipment. The prices for nuclear materials and processing services are established by government fiat. The commercial future of nuclear power will depend on the cost differential between it and conventional power."
