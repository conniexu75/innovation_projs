https://openalex.org/W1975200363,"Autophagy is a cellular catabolic process that relies on the cooperation of autophagosomes and lysosomes. During starvation, the cell expands both compartments to enhance degradation processes. We found that starvation activates a transcriptional program that controls major steps of the autophagic pathway, including autophagosome formation, autophagosome-lysosome fusion, and substrate degradation. The transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master gene for lysosomal biogenesis, coordinated this program by driving expression of autophagy and lysosomal genes. Nuclear localization and activity of TFEB were regulated by serine phosphorylation mediated by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2, whose activity was tuned by the levels of extracellular nutrients. Thus, a mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent mechanism regulates autophagy by controlling the biogenesis and partnership of two distinct cellular organelles."
https://openalex.org/W1995647101,"Despite high heritability, autism is genetically very heterogeneous. This raises the question of whether there are many different pathologies presenting as autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), or whether the myriad genetic causes converge on a few biological pathways affected in most individuals, which could be therapeutically targeted. A study using transcriptome and gene co-expression network analysis suggests that the latter, convergent model is the case. The gene expression patterns that typically distinguish frontal and temporal cortex are much less pronounced in the ASD brain, and specific splicing abnormalities and modules of co-expressed genes associated with autism are enriched for previously identified genetic association signals. This points to transcriptional and splicing dysregulation as underlying mechanisms of neuronal dysfunction in this disorder. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common, highly heritable neurodevelopmental condition characterized by marked genetic heterogeneity1,2,3. Thus, a fundamental question is whether autism represents an aetiologically heterogeneous disorder in which the myriad genetic or environmental risk factors perturb common underlying molecular pathways in the brain4. Here, we demonstrate consistent differences in transcriptome organization between autistic and normal brain by gene co-expression network analysis. Remarkably, regional patterns of gene expression that typically distinguish frontal and temporal cortex are significantly attenuated in the ASD brain, suggesting abnormalities in cortical patterning. We further identify discrete modules of co-expressed genes associated with autism: a neuronal module enriched for known autism susceptibility genes, including the neuronal specific splicing factor A2BP1 (also known as FOX1), and a module enriched for immune genes and glial markers. Using high-throughput RNA sequencing we demonstrate dysregulated splicing of A2BP1-dependent alternative exons in the ASD brain. Moreover, using a published autism genome-wide association study (GWAS) data set, we show that the neuronal module is enriched for genetically associated variants, providing independent support for the causal involvement of these genes in autism. In contrast, the immune-glial module showed no enrichment for autism GWAS signals, indicating a non-genetic aetiology for this process. Collectively, our results provide strong evidence for convergent molecular abnormalities in ASD, and implicate transcriptional and splicing dysregulation as underlying mechanisms of neuronal dysfunction in this disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2069554621,"HIV-1 is unable to replicate efficiently in dendritic cells, the antigen-presenting tissue cells that function in both innate and adaptive immunity. Other primate lentiviruses, including HIV-2 and some simian immunodeficiency viruses, express a protein called Vpx that is able to overcome the block to replication. Two groups now report the identification of the restriction factor in dendritic cells and macrophages that is overcome by Vpx. Vpx is found to induce degradation of the protein SAMHD1. Mutations in SAMHD1 cause Aicardi–Goutières syndrome, a disorder characterized by inappropriate activation of the immune system. Knockdown of SAMHD1 increases HIV-1 replication in dendritic cells, which could be important for generating appropriate immune responses to the virus. The primate lentivirus auxiliary protein Vpx counteracts an unknown restriction factor that renders human dendritic and myeloid cells largely refractory to HIV-1 infection1,2,3,4,5,6. Here we identify SAMHD1 as this restriction factor. SAMHD1 is a protein involved in Aicardi–Goutières syndrome, a genetic encephalopathy with symptoms mimicking congenital viral infection, that has been proposed to act as a negative regulator of the interferon response7. We show that Vpx induces proteasomal degradation of SAMHD1. Silencing of SAMHD1 in non-permissive cell lines alleviates HIV-1 restriction and is associated with a significant accumulation of viral DNA in infected cells. Concurrently, overexpression of SAMHD1 in sensitive cells inhibits HIV-1 infection. The putative phosphohydrolase activity of SAMHD1 is probably required for HIV-1 restriction. Vpx-mediated relief of restriction is abolished in SAMHD1-negative cells. Finally, silencing of SAMHD1 markedly increases the susceptibility of monocytic-derived dendritic cells to infection. Our results demonstrate that SAMHD1 is an antiretroviral protein expressed in cells of the myeloid lineage that inhibits an early step of the viral life cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2075394689,"The pyruvate kinase isoforms PKM1 and PKM2 are alternatively spliced products of the PKM2 gene. PKM2, but not PKM1, alters glucose metabolism in cancer cells and contributes to tumorigenesis by mechanisms that are not explained by its known biochemical activity. We show that PKM2 gene transcription is activated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). PKM2 interacts directly with the HIF-1α subunit and promotes transactivation of HIF-1 target genes by enhancing HIF-1 binding and p300 recruitment to hypoxia response elements, whereas PKM1 fails to regulate HIF-1 activity. Interaction of PKM2 with prolyl hydroxylase 3 (PHD3) enhances PKM2 binding to HIF-1α and PKM2 coactivator function. Mass spectrometry and anti-hydroxyproline antibody assays demonstrate PKM2 hydroxylation on proline-403/408. PHD3 knockdown inhibits PKM2 coactivator function, reduces glucose uptake and lactate production, and increases O2 consumption in cancer cells. Thus, PKM2 participates in a positive feedback loop that promotes HIF-1 transactivation and reprograms glucose metabolism in cancer cells."

https://openalex.org/W2095546080,"Somatic cell nuclear transfer, cell fusion, or expression of lineage-specific factors have been shown to induce cell-fate changes in diverse somatic cell types. We recently observed that forced expression of a combination of three transcription factors, Brn2 (also known as Pou3f2), Ascl1 and Myt1l, can efficiently convert mouse fibroblasts into functional induced neuronal (iN) cells. Here we show that the same three factors can generate functional neurons from human pluripotent stem cells as early as 6 days after transgene activation. When combined with the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor NeuroD1, these factors could also convert fetal and postnatal human fibroblasts into iN cells showing typical neuronal morphologies and expressing multiple neuronal markers, even after downregulation of the exogenous transcription factors. Importantly, the vast majority of human iN cells were able to generate action potentials and many matured to receive synaptic contacts when co-cultured with primary mouse cortical neurons. Our data demonstrate that non-neural human somatic cells, as well as pluripotent stem cells, can be converted directly into neurons by lineage-determining transcription factors. These methods may facilitate robust generation of patient-specific human neurons for in vitro disease modelling or future applications in regenerative medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2021883920,"The electron is predicted to be slightly aspheric, with a distortion characterized by the electric dipole moment (EDM), d(e). No experiment has ever detected this deviation. The standard model of particle physics predicts that d(e) is far too small to detect, being some eleven orders of magnitude smaller than the current experimental sensitivity. However, many extensions to the standard model naturally predict much larger values of d(e) that should be detectable. This makes the search for the electron EDM a powerful way to search for new physics and constrain the possible extensions. In particular, the popular idea that new supersymmetric particles may exist at masses of a few hundred GeV/c(2) (where c is the speed of light) is difficult to reconcile with the absence of an electron EDM at the present limit of sensitivity. The size of the EDM is also intimately related to the question of why the Universe has so little antimatter. If the reason is that some undiscovered particle interaction breaks the symmetry between matter and antimatter, this should result in a measurable EDM in most models of particle physics. Here we use cold polar molecules to measure the electron EDM at the highest level of precision reported so far, providing a constraint on any possible new interactions. We obtain d(e) = (-2.4 ± 5.7(stat) ± 1.5(syst)) × 10(-28)e cm, where e is the charge on the electron, which sets a new upper limit of |d(e)| < 10.5 × 10(-28)e cm with 90 per cent confidence. This result, consistent with zero, indicates that the electron is spherical at this improved level of precision. Our measurement of atto-electronvolt energy shifts in a molecule probes new physics at the tera-electronvolt energy scale."
https://openalex.org/W1991754576,"G-quadruplex (G4) DNA structures are extremely stable four-stranded secondary structures held together by noncanonical G-G base pairs. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to determine the in vivo binding sites of the multifunctional Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pif1 DNA helicase, a potent unwinder of G4 structures in vitro. G4 motifs were a significant subset of the high-confidence Pif1-binding sites. Replication slowed in the vicinity of these motifs, and they were prone to breakage in Pif1-deficient cells, whereas non-G4 Pif1-binding sites did not show this behavior. Introducing many copies of G4 motifs caused slow growth in replication-stressed Pif1-deficient cells, which was relieved by spontaneous mutations that eliminated their ability to form G4 structures, bind Pif1, slow DNA replication, and stimulate DNA breakage. These data suggest that G4 structures form in vivo and that they are resolved by Pif1 to prevent replication fork stalling and DNA breakage."

https://openalex.org/W2051816266,"Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 200 mostly new common low-penetrance susceptibility loci for cancers. The predicted risk associated with each locus is generally modest (with a per-allele odds ratio typically less than 2) and so, presumably, are the functional effects of individual genetic variants conferring disease susceptibility. Perhaps the greatest challenge in the ‘post-GWAS’ era is to understand the functional consequences of these loci. Biological insights can then be translated to clinical benefits, including reliable biomarkers and effective strategies for screening and disease prevention. The purpose of this article is to propose principles for the initial functional characterization of cancer risk loci, with a focus on non-coding variants, and to define ‘post-GWAS’ functional characterization.

By December 2010, there were 1,212 published GWAS studies1 reporting significant (P < 5 × 10−8) associations for 210 traits (Table 1), and the Catalog of Published GWAS states that by March 2011, 812 publications reported 3,977 SNP associations1. This is likely a small fraction of the common susceptibility loci of low penetrance that will eventually be identified. Despite these successes in identifying risk loci, the causal variant and/or the molecular basis of risk etiology has been determined for only a small fraction of these associations2–4. Plausible candidate genes can be based on proximity to risk loci, but few have so far been defined in a more systematic manner (Supplementary Table 1).



Table 1

The genomic context in which a variant is found can be used as preliminary functional analysis



Increased investment in post-GWAS functional characterization of risk loci5 has now been advocated across diseases and for cardiovascular disease and diabetes6. For cancer biology, the complex interplay between genetics and the environment in many cancers poses a particularly exciting challenge for post-GWAS research. Here we suggest a systematic strategy for understanding how cancer-associated variants exert their effects. We mostly refer to SNPs throughout the paper, but we recognize that other types of common genetic (for example, copy number variants) or epigenetic variation may influence risk.

Our understanding of the way in which a risk variant initiates disease pathogenesis progresses from statistical association between genetic variation and trait or disease variation to functionality and causality. The functional consequences of variants in protein-coding regions causing most monogenic disorders are more readily interpreted because we know the genetic code. For non-Mendelian or multifactorial traits, most of the common DNA variants have so far mapped to non-protein–coding regions2, where our understanding of functional consequences and causality is more rudimentary.

Our hypothesis is that the trait-associated alleles exert their effects by influencing transcriptional output (such as transcript levels and splicing) through multiple mechanisms. We emphasize appropriate assays and models to test the functional effects of both SNPs and genes mapping to cancer predisposition loci. Although much of what is written is applicable to alleles discovered for any trait, the section on modeling gene effects will emphasize measuring cancer-related phenotypes.

At some loci, multiple, independently associated risk alleles rather than single risk alleles may be functionally responsible for the occurrence of disease. Genotyping susceptibility loci (and their correlated variants) in multiple populations with different linkage disequilibrium (LD) structures may prove effective in substantially reducing the number of potentially causative variants (that is, the same causal variant may segregate in multiple populations), as shown for the FGFR2 locus in breast cancer7, but for most loci there will remain a set of potentially causative variants that cannot be separated at the statistical level from case-control genotype data.

A susceptibility locus should be re-sequenced to ascertain all genetic variation, identifying candidate functional or causal variants and identifying candidate causal genes. Ideally, the identification of a causal SNP would be the next step to reveal the molecular mechanisms of risk modification. Practically, however, it is unclear what the criteria for causality should be, particularly in non-protein–coding regions. Thus, although we propose a framework set of analyses (Box 1), we acknowledge that the techniques and methods will continue to evolve with the field.

Box 1
Strategies to progress from tag SNP to mechanism


Target resequencing efforts using linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure.


Use other populations to refine LD regions (for example African ancestry with shorter LD and more heterogeneity).


Determine expression levels of nearby genes as a function of genotype at each locus (eQTL).


Characterize gene regulatory regions by multiple empirical techniques bearing in mind that these are tissue and context specific.


Combine regulatory regions with risk loci using coordinates from multiple reference genomes to capture all variation within the shorter regulatory regions that correlates with the tag SNP at each locus.


Multiple experimental manipulations in model systems are needed to progressively implicate transcription units (genes) in mechanisms relevant to the associated loci:


Knockouts of regulatory regions in animal (difficult and may be limited by functional redundancy, but new targeting methods in rat are promising) models followed by genome-wide expression analysis.


Use chromatin association methods (3C, CHIA-PET) of regulatory regions to determine the identity of target genes (compare with eQTL data).


Targeted gene perturbations in somatic cell models.


Explore fully genome-wide eQTL and miRNA quantitative variation correlation in relevant tissues and cells.




Explore epigenetic mechanisms in the context of genome-wide genetic polymorphism.


Employ cell models and tissue reconstructions to evaluate mechanisms using gene perturbations and polymorphic variants. The human cancer cell xenograft has re-emerged as a minimal in vivo validation of these models.


Above all, resist the temptation to equate any partial functional evidence as sufficient. Published claims of functional relevance should be fully evaluated using the steps detailed above."

By preserving weak protein interactions during complex isolation and utilizing high levels of reciprocity in the large dataset, we identified many unreported protein associations, such as a transcriptional network formed by ZMYND8, ZNF687, and ZNF592. Furthermore, our work revealed a tiered interplay within networks that share common proteins, providing a conceptual organization of a cellular proteome composed of minimal endogenous modules (MEMOs), complex isoforms (uniCOREs), and regulatory complex-complex interaction networks (CCIs).

Current ensemble approaches of identifying cellular protein interactions cannot reveal physiological permutations of these interactions. Here we describe a single-molecule pull-down (SiMPull) assay that combines the principles of a conventional pull-down assay with single-molecule fluorescence microscopy and enables direct visualization of individual cellular protein complexes. SiMPull can reveal how many proteins and of which kinds are present in the in vivo complex, as we show using protein kinase A. We then demonstrate a wide applicability to various signalling proteins found in the cytosol, membrane and cellular organelles, and to endogenous protein complexes from animal tissue extracts. The pulled-down proteins are functional and are used, without further processing, for single-molecule biochemical studies. SiMPull should provide a rapid, sensitive and robust platform for analysing protein assemblies in biological pathways. Analysis of protein interactions is crucial for understanding cellular function and regulation. Here, Taekjip Ha and colleagues develop a novel method for elucidating the identity and stoichiometry of protein complexes from cells and tissues at single-molecule resolution. The method, called single molecule pull-down or SiMPull, can discriminate between multiple association states of a protein, and simultaneously allows determination of complex stoichiometry through photobleaching step analysis. The potential of the assay is demonstrated in a variety of contexts, including endogenous proteins from tissue extracts, organelles and membrane proteins."

The plasmodial surface anion channel (PSAC) mediates this transport and is an antimalarial target, but its molecular basis is unknown. We report a parasite gene family responsible for PSAC activity. We used high-throughput screening for nutrient uptake inhibitors to identify a compound highly specific for channels from the Dd2 line of the human pathogen P. falciparum. Inheritance of this compound's affinity in a Dd2 × HB3 genetic cross maps to a single parasite locus on chromosome 3. DNA transfection and in vitro selections indicate that PSAC-inhibitor interactions are encoded by two clag3 genes previously assumed to function in cytoadherence. These genes are conserved in plasmodia, exhibit expression switching, and encode an integral protein on the host membrane, as predicted by functional studies.

Malik Peiris and colleagues present a large data set of hundreds of swine influenza isolates and swine sera collected over 12 years of systematic surveillance in southern China, supplemented with samples stretching back 34 years. The data set provides a detailed picture of the evolutionary dynamics of swine influenza in this region. Swine influenza A viruses (SwIV) cause significant economic losses in animal husbandry as well as instances of human disease1 and occasionally give rise to human pandemics2, including that caused by the H1N1/2009 virus3,4. The lack of systematic and longitudinal influenza surveillance in pigs has hampered attempts to reconstruct the origins of this pandemic4. Most existing swine data were derived from opportunistic samples collected from diseased pigs in disparate geographical regions, not from prospective studies in defined locations, hence the evolutionary and transmission dynamics of SwIV are poorly understood. Here we quantify the epidemiological, genetic and antigenic dynamics of SwIV in Hong Kong using a data set of more than 650 SwIV isolates and more than 800 swine sera from 12 years of systematic surveillance in this region, supplemented with data stretching back 34 years. Intercontinental virus movement has led to reassortment and lineage replacement, creating an antigenically and genetically diverse virus population whose dynamics are quantitatively different from those previously observed for human influenza viruses. Our findings indicate that increased antigenic drift is associated with reassortment events and offer insights into the emergence of influenza viruses with epidemic potential in swine and humans."

A natural product, dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine (DLPC), has now been identified as a possible antisteatosis agent, with therapeutic potential in pre-diabetic people. DLPC activates the orphan nuclear receptor LRH-1, loss of which decreases bile acid levels. Elevated bile acid is known to decrease steatosis. Acting as an LHR-1 agonist, DLPC decreases hepatic steatosis and improves glucose homeostasis in mouse models of insulin resistance. Nuclear hormone receptors regulate diverse metabolic pathways and the orphan nuclear receptor LRH-1 (also known as NR5A2) regulates bile acid biosynthesis1,2. Structural studies have identified phospholipids as potential LRH-1 ligands3,4,5, but their functional relevance is unclear. Here we show that an unusual phosphatidylcholine species with two saturated 12 carbon fatty acid acyl side chains (dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine (DLPC)) is an LRH-1 agonist ligand in vitro. DLPC treatment induces bile acid biosynthetic enzymes in mouse liver, increases bile acid levels, and lowers hepatic triglycerides and serum glucose. DLPC treatment also decreases hepatic steatosis and improves glucose homeostasis in two mouse models of insulin resistance. Both the antidiabetic and lipotropic effects are lost in liver-specific Lrh-1 knockouts.

At the 2–4 cell stage there is a strong, genome-wide dominance of maternal transcripts, although transcripts are contributed by both parental genomes. At the globular stage the relative paternal contribution is higher, largely due to a gradual activation of the paternal genome.

The early Arabidopsis embryonic transcriptome has a dominant maternal contribution The paternal contribution increases gradually during early embryogenesis Parental contributions are maternally controlled by the chromatin siRNA pathway Paternal activation requires maternal activity of histone chaperone complex CAF1 In most animal species, the zygote is transcriptionally quiescent, and early embryogenesis is governed by maternal products stored in the oocyte prior to fertilization (Andéol, 1994Andéol Y. Early transcription in different animal species: implication for transition from maternal to zygotic control in development.Roux. Arch. Dev. Biol. 1994; 204: 3-10Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Depending on the species, zygotic genome activation (ZGA) takes place after one to several cell divisions. ZGA is a gradual process that relies on large-scale chromatin reprogramming leading to an increasing number of zygotically expressed genes (Tadros and Lipshitz, 2009Tadros W. Lipshitz H.D. The maternal-to-zygotic transition: a play in two acts.Development. 2009; 136: 3033-3042Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Maternal transcripts and proteins inherited from the gametes are progressively degraded, and biparental zygotic transcripts gradually take over the control of development. As a result, parental contributions to the embryonic transcriptome dynamically change during early development, with an initial maternal control that is of variable duration (1 to 15 cell cycles) (Baroux et al., 2008Baroux C.

Strikingly, such a maternal influence occurs in animals as evolutionarily divergent as insects, amphibians, and mammals. Understanding the parental contributions and the regulation of zygotic genome expression during early embryogenesis is a key question in developmental and evolutionary biology.

Xenia effect on seed and embryo size in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.).J. Appl. Genet. 2006; 47: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In flowering plants, double fertilization produces the zygote, which develops into the embryo (Movie S1 available online), and the endosperm, an embryo-nurturing tissue. Both fertilization products develop within maternal integuments, forming the seed. Genetic studies have shown that seed development is under maternal influence (Chaudhury and Berger, 2001Chaudhury A.M. Berger F. Maternal control of seed development.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), but the composite nature of the seed makes determining the origin of maternal effects complex. Recently, downregulation of RNA Polymerase II (PolII) in the mature Arabidopsis egg cell revealed that the embryo developed to the preglobular stage in absence of significant de novo transcription (Pillot et al., 2010bPillot M. Baroux C. Vazquez M.A. Autran D. Leblanc O. Vielle-Calzada J.P. Grossniklaus U. Grimanelli D. Embryo and endosperm inherit distinct chromatin and transcriptional states from the female gametes in Arabidopsis.Plant Cell. 2010; 22: 307-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Thus, de novo transcription of parental genomes is not an absolute requirement for early embryogenesis, but the timing, dynamics, and mechanisms of zygotic genome activation have yet to be elucidated. Reporter and profiling studies on whole seeds from Arabidopsis and maize have identified several transcripts with a dominant maternal representation at early stages, whereas paternal transcripts were detected only later (Baroux et al., 2001Baroux C.

Furthermore, near-saturation mutagenesis screens identified a plethora of mutations affecting embryo development at or before the globular stage. The majority of these segregate as zygotic recessive traits, indicating biparental contributions to early embryogenesis (Tzafrir et al., 2004Tzafrir I. Pena-Muralla R. Dickerman A. Berg M. Rogers R. Hutchens S. Sweeney T.C. McElver J. Aux G. Patton D. et al.Identification of genes required for embryo development in Arabidopsis.Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 1206-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Thus, to date there is no clear understanding of the relative parental contributions to plant embryogenesis nor are the mechanisms regulating the respective contributions known. We performed allele-specific profiling of the embryonic transcriptome and quantified relative transcript contributions of the paternal and maternal genomes in Arabidopsis embryos. We demonstrate a strong, genome-wide dominance of maternal transcripts at early stages, although many transcripts are biparentally represented. This finding reconciles the observation made by several laboratories of both maternal and zygotic effects during early embryogenesis. Using reporter and profiling analyses, we found an increasing contribution of paternal products as embryo development proceeds, with kinetics differing on a gene-by-gene basis. We identified two maternal epigenetic pathways, involving the chromatin siRNA pathway and the histone chaperone complex CAF1, which act antagonistically to regulate the paternal contribution. Importantly, we show that these pathways are distinct from those regulating genomic imprinting. To unambiguously define the parental contributions in the early embryo, we profiled the transcriptome of early-stage embryos in an allele-specific manner. We dissected 2–4 cell and globular stage embryos (Figure 1A ) derived from a cross between the polymorphic Landsberg erecta (Ler) and Columbia (Col) accessions. The embryonic transcriptome was sequenced using a SOLiD v3 platform (Figure 1; see Table S1). Reads covering single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (Borevitz et al., 2007Borevitz J.O. Hazen S.P. Michael T.P. Morris G.P. Baxter I.R. Hu T.T. Chen H. Werner J.D. Nordborg M. Salt D.E. et al.Genome-wide patterns of single-feature polymorphisms in Arabidopsis thaliana.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 12057-12062Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) were extracted and are referred to hereafter as informative reads with respect to parental origin. Informative reads were used to quantify parental contributions both globally (Figure 1A), and for each gene individually. Genes were considered biparentally expressed at a given stage whenever both parental alleles were identified in the corresponding transcriptome. The classification of genes for which only a single allelic variant was detected was more ambiguous. Transcripts might be detected from only one parent because of uniparental expression or because of low sampling rates, which is of particular concern for genes expressed at low levels. To circumvent this difficulty, we made a probabilistic model describing the distribution of genes according to the proportion of maternal transcripts, q, which was adjusted to best-fit the observations (Experimental Procedures). From this likelihood-based distribution, we estimated the frequency of genes fitting the biparental class (0 < q < 1, both parental alleles were detected), the paternal class (q = 0, only the paternal alleles were detected), or the maternal class (q = 1, only the maternal alleles were detected). In addition, each gene could be assigned a probability of falling within each class (Table S2). This integrated approach allowed a quantitative and qualitative analysis of parental contributions to the embryonic transcriptome. Strikingly, at the 2–4 cell embryo stage 88.4% of the informative reads (n = 135,142) were of maternal origin (Figure 1A). This was confirmed in an independent biological replicate (Figure S1). The informative reads represented 3973 loci located throughout the genome. The gene distribution drawn for q quantiles showed a strong bias toward maternal overrepresentation (Figure 1B) with 85% of the genes described by q > 0.75 (Figure 1C; Table S1). Transcripts of the biparental class (0 < q < 1; 68.2% of the identified genes) contributed strongly to this maternal dominance with 54.7% genes described by 0.75 < q < 1, i.e., maternal overrepresentation (Figure 1C and Table S1). Furthermore, our analysis revealed 30.2% transcripts of the maternal class (q = 1) against only 1.6% transcripts of the paternal class (q = 0) at the 2–4 cell stage. Thus, in Arabidopsis both parental genomes contribute to the early embryonic transcriptome but overall it is clearly dominated by maternal transcripts. To determine how parental transcript contributions change during embryogenesis, we extended our allele-specific profiling to embryos at the globular stage. Although maternal dominance was maintained, the paternal contribution increased, as shown by 35.9% paternal reads versus 11.6% at the 2–4 cell stage (Figure 1A and Table S1). These informative reads identified 3078 loci, for which the q distribution remained skewed toward maternal overrepresentation, although to a lesser extent than at the 2–4 cell stage (Figure 1B). The maternal class (q = 1) represented 13.8% of the genes (versus 30.2% at the 2–4 cell stage), and the paternal class (q = 0) increased marginally to 2.3% (versus 1.6% at the 2–4 cell stage) (Table S1). Concomitantly, the biparental class increased, now comprising 83.9% of genes, with 34.5% showing maternal overrepresentation (0.75 < q < 1) (versus 54.7% at the 2–4 cell stage) (Figure 1C). Importantly, the globular stage transcriptome shared 2417 genes (78.5%) with that of the 2–4 cell stage, representing 95% of the reads (Figure 2A ). We analyzed the changes of parental contributions among these shared genes by quantifying class transitions (Figure 2B). For instance a transition from the maternal class to the biparental or paternal class indicates de novo activation of the paternal allele and represents 21.5% (515) of the genes (Figure 2C). De novo activation of the maternal allele was less prominent with only 0.8% genes, mostly because few paternally expressed genes were identified at the 2–4 cell stage. This analysis identified loci with a decay of one parental transcript, with 2.5% and 9.7% showing loss of their maternal or paternal transcripts, respectively (Figure 2C). However, most quantitative changes occurred in the biparentally expressed class (54.4%, 1315 genes) where the majority showed a marked increase in the relative paternal contribution (778 genes, Figure 2D). This could result from decay of maternal RNAs, de novo transcription of paternal alleles, or a combination of both. To refine the timing of activation of paternal alleles, we monitored paternal activity of six marker lines expressing a reporter gene under diverse promoters active during early embryogenesis. The lines reflect genes with diverse cellular functions (Table S3) and showed either early, intermediate, or late paternal activity, respectively (e.g., RPS5A, CYCB1;1, and ET1041), but did not appear in our allele-specific transcriptome due to the absence of a referenced SNP in their sequence. The marker lines clearly showed distinct expression depending on whether they were maternally or paternally inherited (Figure 3A and Figure S2A ). We scored the number of F1 embryos showing paternal marker expression at the same developmental stage and in a wild-type maternal background (three to seven biological replicates each, Table S4). For all markers the proportion of stained embryos increased with developmental progression (Figure 3B and Figure S2B). Consistent with our RNA profiling results, paternal expression of the markers displayed gene-specific activation timing (developmental stage at which the first expression was detected) and kinetics (incremental increase in the fraction of progeny showing expression). For instance, in a Ler maternal background the paternal ET1041 marker showed only 4% stained embryos at the 2–4 cell stage, whereas the RPS5A and GRP23 markers showed 58% and 67%, respectively (Figure 3B). In contrast, maternally transmitted markers showed consistent expression in essentially all embryos, even at earliest stages (Figures S2A and S2C).Figure S2Maternal and Paternal Expression of Embryo Markers in Wild-Type, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Differential expression of the indicated reporter transgenes (Table S3), when transmitted maternally (right panel) or paternally (left panel) was detected using histochemical detection of the uidA gene product (GUS) at different stages.(B) Quantification of paternal expression in Arabidopsis accessions.

Taken together with the transcriptome study, these findings strongly suggest that paternally inherited alleles—even those that are detectable at a very early stage—are activated gradually after fertilization. This is consistent with the previous observations made for individual genes in Arabidopsis, and reconciles earlier, apparently conflicting reports. Whether maternal loci follow similar or different activation kinetics cannot be easily resolved because of the potential importance of maternal carryover. Nevertheless, our observations are reminiscent of the gradual, de novo, expression of zygotic genes reported in animals (Tadros and Lipshitz, 2009Tadros W. Lipshitz H.D. The maternal-to-zygotic transition: a play in two acts.Development. 2009; 136: 3033-3042Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). In our marker analyses we observed that expression was influenced by the maternal genotype (i.e., the accession) (Figure S2B). This indicated a maternal control of paternal expression as suggested previously (Ngo et al., 2007Ngo Q.A. Moore J.M. Baskar R. Grossniklaus U. Sundaresan V. Arabidopsis GLAUCE promotes fertilization-independent endosperm development and expression of paternally inherited alleles.Development. 2007; 134: 4107-4117Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The gradual increase in paternal allele expression might reflect the progressive release of a silencing mechanism. In Arabidopsis, silent chromatin is enriched in histone H3 dimethylated at lysine 9 (H3K9me2), a modification principally deposited by the SUVH4 histone methyltransferase KRYPTONITE (KYP) (Jackson et al., 2002Jackson J.P. Lindroth A.M. Cao X. Jacobsen S.E. Control of CpNpG DNA methylation by the KRYPTONITE histone H3 methyltransferase.Nature. 2002; 416: 556-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). To investigate the possibility that maternal KYP regulates the activity of paternal alleles, we quantified reporter gene expression in seeds resulting from a cross between a maternal kyp mutant and wild-type pollen carrying the marker. For all reporters tested, lack of maternal KYP activity significantly increased the proportion of embryos showing early paternal reporter activity (before the 16-cell embryo stage) (Figures 4A and 4B , Figure S2A, and Table S4). We confirmed the maternal effect of the kyp mutation on the endogenous AGP18 locus by allele-specific RT-PCR (Figure 4C). These data strongly suggest a role for maternal KYP activity in repressing the transcription of paternal alleles during early embryogenesis. To investigate the maternal effect of the kyp mutation at the genome-wide level, we performed allele-specific profiling of 2–4 cell embryos dissected from crosses between maternal kyp (Ler) and paternal wild-type (Col) parents (Table S1). Embryos inheriting maternal kyp (kypm/KYPp) showed a strong increase in the proportion of paternal reads (35.9% versus 11.6% in 2–4 cell stage wild-type embryos) (Figure 4D and replicate Figure S1) resulting in a similar paternal contribution as in wild-type embryos at the globular stage (36.1%; Figure 1A). Informative reads in kypm/KYPp embryos identified 3125 genes (Table S1) for which the q distribution was shifted toward a higher paternal representation compared to wild-type embryos at the 2–4 cell stage (Figure 4E). Notably, the proportion of the paternal class increased markedly (10.3% at q = 0, versus 1.6% in wild-type 2–4 cell embryos, Figure 4F) whereas the proportion of genes in the maternal class diminished (Figure 4F). In addition, genes in the biparental class (0 < q < 1) showed a higher paternal contribution compared to wild-type embryos at the 2–4 cell stage (shifted distribution Figure 4E; less maternally dominant genes Figure 4F). Thus, the maternal kyp mutation affected a large number of genes throughout the genome, resulting in a higher paternal contribution to the early embryonic transcriptome. Importantly, 2461 of these 3125 genes were common to the wild-type transcriptome of embryos at the same stage and were covered by 94.6% of the informative reads (Figure S3B ). This suggests that the maternal kyp mutation does not drastically alter the 2–4 cell stage embryonic transcriptome, but instead modifies the relative parental contributions of genes normally expressed at this stage. Interestingly, the maternal kyp mutation induced class transitions similar to those induced by developmental progression (Figures S3C–S3E compared to Figures 2B–2D). The changes in the relative contribution of biparental class genes were highly correlated (Figure 4G), except for a subgroup (158 genes) showing a higher increase of the paternal contribution in kypm/KYPp 2–4 cell embryos as compared to wild-type globular embryos (Figure 4G). The analysis also identified genes showing a gain or a loss of one parental transcript (Figure S3D). We conservatively estimate that the maternal kyp mutation induces an increased paternal and maternal contribution for 1307 and 117 genes, respectively (Figure S3F). Taken together these results strongly suggest that maternal KYP activity downregulates early transcription of many paternal, and some maternal, alleles of loci throughout the genome. This maternal control may be progressively released during embryogenesis, leading to the gradual activation of the paternal genome. Because KYP-dependent H3K9me2 in Arabidopsis is linked to non-CG DNA methylation, we verified the effects of mutations in DOMAIN REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE2 (DRM2) and CHROMOMETHYLASE3 (CMT3), two genes that control non-CG methylation (Feng et al., 2010Feng S. Jacobsen S.E. Reik W. Epigenetic reprogramming in plant and animal development.Science. 2010; 330: 622-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Similar to kyp, both mutations inherited maternally resulted in precocious activation of the paternally inherited markers (Figure 5A and Figures S4A and S4B ). By contrast, maternal mutations in either METHYLTRANSFERASE1 (MET1) or DECREASED DNA METHYLATION1 (DDM1), involved in the maintenance of CG DNA methylation (Feng et al., 2010Feng S. Jacobsen S.E. Reik W. Epigenetic reprogramming in plant and animal development.Science. 2010; 330: 622-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar), had no consistent effect (Figure S4C). Thus, non-CG but not CG DNA methylation participates in the transcriptional repression of paternal marker genes.Figure S4Maternal CMT3 and DRM2, but not MET1 and DDM1, Control Early Expression of Paternally Transmitted Markers, Related to Figure 5Show full captionAdditional control experiments showing maternal but not paternal effect of RdDM mutations and absence of effects on transposon enhancer trap markers.(A) Embryos showing GUS staining were scored in the progeny of crosses between wild-type (Col or Ler) or mutant females and the indicated paternal markers, at the developmental stages indicated above the graphs.

However, operantly driven FEF activity was primarily associated with selective visual attention, and not oculomotor preparation. Attentional effects were untrained and were observed both behaviorally and neurophysiologically. Furthermore, selective attention correlated with voluntary, but not spontaneous, fluctuations in FEF activity.

Currently, CpG islands are defined based on their genomic sequences alone. Here, we develop evolutionary models to show that several distinct evolutionary processes generate and maintain CpG islands. One central evolutionary regime resulting in enriched CpG content is driven by low levels of DNA methylation and consequentially low rates of CpG deamination. Another major force forming CpG islands is biased gene conversion that stabilizes constitutively methylated CpG islands by balancing rapid deamination with CpG fixation. Importantly, evolutionary analysis and population genetics data suggest that selection for high CpG content is not a significant factor contributing to conservation of CpGs in differentially methylated regions. The heterogeneous, but not selective, origins of CpG islands have direct implications for the understanding of DNA methylation patterns in healthy and diseased cells."

https://openalex.org/W2123569576,"Consuming protein following exercise has been shown to stimulate protein synthesis acutely in skeletal muscle and has been recommended to prevent sarcopenia. It is not known, however, whether acute stimulation persists long term or includes muscle cell division. We asked here whether consuming protein following exercise during aerobic training increases long-term protein and DNA synthesis rates in skeletal muscle of adult humans. Sixteen previously untrained participants (50 ± 8 yr) consumed either a carbohydrate or carbohydrate and protein drink following each session during 6 wk of treadmill training. A younger untrained group provided a nonexercising comparison. Participants were administered heavy water (2H2O; deuterium oxide) continuously for 6 wk to isotopically label newly synthesized skeletal muscle proteins and DNA. Muscle biopsies were performed after 6 wk of training. Contrary to acute studies, consuming protein after exercise did not increase skeletal muscle protein synthesis rates. In contrast, muscle protein synthesis, DNA, and phospholipid synthesis were significantly higher in the older exercise groups than the younger sedentary group. The higher DNA replication rate could not be attributed to mitochondrial DNA and may be due to satellite cell activation. We conclude that postexercise protein supplementation does not increase rates of mixed protein synthesis over 6 wk and that aerobic exercise may stimulate long-term cell division (DNA synthesis) in skeletal muscle of humans. Measurements of long-term synthesis rates provide important insights into aging and exercise adaptations.—Robinson, M. M., Turner, S. M., Hellerstein, M. K., Hamilton, K. L., Miller, B. F.

https://openalex.org/W2153448038,"To elucidate the involvement of specific ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths in solar mutagenesis, we used a laser system to investigate the induction of DNA damage, both in the overall genome and at the nucleotide resolution level, in the genomic DNA of transgenic Big Blue mouse fibroblasts irradiated with a series of UV wavelengths, inclusive of UVC (λ<280 nm), UVB (λ=280–320 nm), and UVA (λ>320 nm). Subsequently, we sought correlation between the locations of UV-induced DNA lesions in the cII transgene of irradiated DNA samples and the frequency distribution and codon position of the induced cII mutations in counterpart mouse cells irradiated with simulated sunlight. Using a combination of enzymatic digestion assays coupled with gel electrophoresis, immunodot blot assays, and DNA footprinting assays, we demonstrated a unique wavelength-dependent formation of photodimeric lesions, i.e., cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and (6–4) photoproducts [(6–4)PPs], based on direct UV absorption of DNA, in irradiated mouse genomic DNA, which could partially explain the induction of mutations in mouse cells irradiated with simulated sunlight. Most notably, there was a divergence of CPD and (6–4)PP formation at an irradiation wavelength of 296 nm in mouse genomic DNA. Whereas substantial formation of (6–4)PPs was detectable in samples irradiated at this wavelength, which intensified as the irradiation wavelength decreased, only small quantities of these lesions were found in samples irradiated at wavelengths of 300–305 nm, with no detectable level of (6–4)PPs in samples irradiated with longer wavelengths. Although CPD formation followed the same pattern of increase with decreasing wavelengths of irradiation, there were substantial levels of CPDs in samples irradiated with UVB wavelengths borderlined with UVA, and small but detectable levels of these lesions in samples irradiated with longer wavelengths. Because the terrestrial sunlight spectrum rolls off sharply at wavelengths ~300 nm, our findings suggest that CPDs are the principal lesion responsible for most DNA damage-dependent biological effects of sunlight.—Besaratinia, A., Yoon, J.-I., Schroeder, C., Bradforth, S.

https://openalex.org/W1975312378,"24(S)-Hydroxycholesterol (24S-OHC) produced by cholesterol 24-hydroxylase expressed mainly in neurons plays an important physiological role in the brain. Conversely, it has been reported that 24S-OHC possesses potent cytotoxicity. The molecular mechanisms of 24S-OHC-induced cell death have not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, using human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and primary cortical neuronal cells derived from rat embryo, we characterized the form of cell death induced by 24S-OHC. SH-SY5Y cells treated with 24S-OHC exhibited neither fragmentation of the nucleus nor caspase activation, which are the typical characteristics of apoptosis. 24S-OHC-treated cells showed necrosis-like morphological changes but did not induce ATP depletion, one of the features of necrosis. When cells were treated with necrostatin-1, an inhibitor of receptor-interacting serine/threonine kinase 1 (RIPK1) required for necroptosis, 24S-OHC-induced cell death was significantly suppressed. The knockdown of RIPK1 by transfection of small interfering RNA of RIPK1 effectively attenuated 24S-OHC-induced cell death. It was found that neither SH-SY5Y cells nor primary cortical neuronal cells expressed caspase-8, which was regulated for RIPK1-dependent apoptosis. Collectively, these results suggest that 24S-OHC induces neuronal cell death by necroptosis, a form of programmed necrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2027598214,"Alternative splicing of pre-messenger RNAs diversifies gene products in eukaryotes and is guided by factors that enable spliceosomes to recognize particular splice sites. Here we report that alternative splicing of Saccharomyces cerevisiae SRC1 pre-mRNA is promoted by the conserved ubiquitin-like protein Hub1. Structural and biochemical data show that Hub1 binds non-covalently to a conserved element termed HIND, which is present in the spliceosomal protein Snu66 in yeast and mammals, and Prp38 in plants. Hub1 binding mildly alters spliceosomal protein interactions and barely affects general splicing in S. cerevisiae. However, spliceosomes that lack Hub1, or are defective in Hub1-HIND interaction, cannot use certain non-canonical 5' splice sites and are defective in alternative SRC1 splicing. Hub1 confers alternative splicing not only when bound to HIND, but also when experimentally fused to Snu66, Prp38, or even the core splicing factor Prp8. Our study indicates a novel mechanism for splice site utilization that is guided by non-covalent modification of the spliceosome by an unconventional ubiquitin-like modifier."

HPPD is the molecular target of very effective synthetic herbicides. HPPD inhibitors may also be useful in treating life-threatening tyrosinemia type I and are currently in trials for treatment of Parkinson disease. The reaction mechanism of this key enzyme in both plants and animals has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, using site-directed mutagenesis supported by quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical theoretical calculations, we investigated the role of catalytic residues potentially interacting with the substrate/intermediates. These results highlight the following: (i) the central role of Gln-272, Gln-286, and Gln-358 in HPP binding and the first nucleophilic attack; (ii) the important movement of the aromatic ring of HPP during the reaction, and (iii) the key role played by Asn-261 and Ser-246 in C1 hydroxylation and the final ortho-rearrangement steps (numbering according to the Arabidopsis HPPD crystal structure 1SQD). Furthermore, this study reveals that the last step of the catalytic reaction, the 1,2 shift of the acetate side chain, which was believed to be unique to the HPPD activity, is also catalyzed by a structurally unrelated enzyme. 4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) catalyzes the conversion of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (HPP) into homogentisate.

https://openalex.org/W2088195228,"Extracellular free heme can intercalate into membranes and promote damage to cellular macromolecules. Thus it is likely that specific intercellular pathways exist for the directed transport, trafficking, and delivery of heme to cellular destinations, although none have been found to date. Here we show that Caenorhabditis elegans HRG-3 is required for the delivery of maternal heme to developing embryos. HRG-3 binds heme and is exclusively secreted by maternal intestinal cells into the interstitial fluid for transport of heme to extraintestinal cells, including oocytes. HRG-3 deficiency results either in death during embryogenesis or in developmental arrest immediately post-hatching—phenotypes that are fully suppressed by maternal but not zygotic hrg-3 expression. Our results establish a role for HRG-3 as an intercellular heme-trafficking protein."

Oleic acid and linoleic acid are two major dietary fatty acids, but their effects in diabetes are unclear. We challenged β cell-specific glucokinase haploinsufficient (Gck+/−) mice with a diet containing sucrose and oleic acid (SO) or sucrose and linoleic acid (SL) and analyzed β cell apoptosis. In Gck+/− but not wild-type mice, SL significantly decreased the β cell mass and β cell proportion in islet cells arising from increased apoptosis to a greater degree than did SO. The mRNA expression of SREBP-1c was significantly higher, and that of E-cadherin was significantly lower in the islets of Gck+/− mice fed SL compared with mice fed SO. We next evaluated monotherapy with desfluorositagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, in these mouse groups. DPP-4 inhibitor protected against β cell apoptosis, restored the β cell mass, and normalized islet morphology in Gck+/− mice fed SL. DPP-4 inhibition normalized the changes in the islet expression of SREBP-1c and E-cadherin mRNA induced by the SL diet. Furthermore, linoleic acid induced β cell apoptosis to a greater degree in the presence of high glucose levels than in the presence of low glucose levels in vitro in islets and MIN6 cells, whereas a GLP-1 receptor agonist prevented apoptosis. In conclusion, SL exacerbated β cell apoptosis in diabetic Gck+/− mice but not in euglycemic wild-type mice, and DPP-4 inhibition protected against these effects.

https://openalex.org/W2115937670,"Receptor tyrosine kinases play essential roles in tissue development and homeostasis, and aberrant signaling by these molecules is the basis of many diseases. Understanding the activation mechanism of these receptors is thus of high clinical relevance. We investigated vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) and their receptors (VEGFRs), which regulate blood and lymph vessel formation. We analyzed the structural changes in the extracellular receptor domain that were induced by ligand binding and that represent the initial step in transmembrane signaling, culminating in the activation of the intracellular receptor kinase domain. High-resolution structural information for the ligand binding domain became available recently, but the flexibility of the extracellular domain and inhomogeneous glycosylation of VEGFRs have prevented the production of highly diffracting crystals of the entire extracellular domain so far. Therefore, we chose to further investigate VEGFR structure by small-angle X-ray scattering in solution (SAXS). SAXS data were combined with independent distance restraint determination obtained by mass spectrometric analysis of chemically cross-linked ligand/receptor complexes. With these data, we constructed a structural model of the entire extracellular receptor domain in the unbound form and in complex with VEGF.—Kisko, K., Brozzo, M.

https://openalex.org/W1982540078,"DinB (DNA Pol IV) is a translesion (TLS) DNA polymerase, which inserts a nucleotide opposite an otherwise replication-stalling N(2)-dG lesion in vitro, and confers resistance to nitrofurazone (NFZ), a compound that forms these lesions in vivo. DinB is also known to be part of the cellular response to alkylation DNA damage. Yet it is not known if DinB active site residues, in addition to aminoacids involved in DNA synthesis, are critical in alkylation lesion bypass. It is also unclear which active site aminoacids, if any, might modulate DinB's bypass fidelity of distinct lesions. Here we report that along with the classical catalytic residues, an active site ""aromatic triad"", namely residues F12, F13, and Y79, is critical for cell survival in the presence of the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Strains expressing dinB alleles with single point mutations in the aromatic triad survive poorly in MMS. Remarkably, these strains show fewer MMS- than NFZ-induced mutants, suggesting that the aromatic triad, in addition to its role in TLS, modulates DinB's accuracy in bypassing distinct lesions. The high bypass fidelity of prevalent alkylation lesions is evident even when the DinB active site performs error-prone NFZ-induced lesion bypass. The analyses carried out with the active site aromatic triad suggest that the DinB active site residues are poised to proficiently bypass distinctive DNA lesions, yet they are also malleable so that the accuracy of the bypass is lesion-dependent."

https://openalex.org/W2023766270,"It was reported that some proteins known to cause renal cystic disease (NPHP6; BBS1, and BBS4) also localize to the olfactory epithelium (OE), and that mutations in these proteins can cause anosmia in addition to renal cystic disease. We demonstrate here that a number of other proteins associated with renal cystic diseases - polycystin 1 and 2 (PC1, PC2), and Meckel-Gruber syndrome 1 and 3 (MKS1, MKS3) - localize to the murine OE. PC1, PC2, MKS1 and MKS3 are all detected in the OE by RT-PCR. We find that MKS3 localizes specifically to dendritic knobs of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), while PC1 localizes to both dendritic knobs and cilia of mature OSNs. In mice carrying mutations in MKS1, the expression of the olfactory adenylate cyclase (AC3) is substantially reduced. Moreover, in rats with renal cystic disease caused by a mutation in MKS3, the laminar organization of the OE is perturbed and there is a reduced expression of components of the odor transduction cascade (G(olf), AC3) and α-acetylated tubulin. Furthermore, we show with electron microscopy that cilia in MKS3 mutant animals do not manifest the proper microtubule architecture. Both MKS1 and MKS3 mutant animals show no obvious alterations in odor receptor expression. These data show that multiple renal cystic proteins localize to the OE, where we speculate that they work together to regulate aspects of the development, maintenance or physiological activities of cilia."
