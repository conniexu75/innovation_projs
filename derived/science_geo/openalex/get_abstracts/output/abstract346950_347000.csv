https://openalex.org/W2104477830,"Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein (G protein)–coupled receptors constitute the largest family of eukaryotic signal transduction proteins that communicate across the membrane. We report the crystal structure of a human β 2 -adrenergic receptor–T4 lysozyme fusion protein bound to the partial inverse agonist carazolol at 2.4 angstrom resolution. The structure provides a high-resolution view of a human G protein–coupled receptor bound to a diffusible ligand. Ligand-binding site accessibility is enabled by the second extracellular loop, which is held out of the binding cavity by a pair of closely spaced disulfide bridges and a short helical segment within the loop. Cholesterol, a necessary component for crystallization, mediates an intriguing parallel association of receptor molecules in the crystal lattice. Although the location of carazolol in the β 2 -adrenergic receptor is very similar to that of retinal in rhodopsin, structural differences in the ligand-binding site and other regions highlight the challenges in using rhodopsin as a template model for this large receptor family."
https://openalex.org/W2080231167,"The β 2 -adrenergic receptor (β 2 AR) is a well-studied prototype for heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein (G protein)–coupled receptors (GPCRs) that respond to diffusible hormones and neurotransmitters. To overcome the structural flexibility of the β 2 AR and to facilitate its crystallization, we engineered a β 2 AR fusion protein in which T4 lysozyme (T4L) replaces most of the third intracellular loop of the GPCR (“β 2 AR-T4L”) and showed that this protein retains near-native pharmacologic properties. Analysis of adrenergic receptor ligand-binding mutants within the context of the reported high-resolution structure of β 2 AR-T4L provides insights into inverse-agonist binding and the structural changes required to accommodate catecholamine agonists. Amino acids known to regulate receptor function are linked through packing interactions and a network of hydrogen bonds, suggesting a conformational pathway from the ligand-binding pocket to regions that interact with G proteins."

We showed that DBS selectively interferes with the normal ability to slow down when faced with decision conflict. While on DBS, patients actually sped up their decisions under high-conflict conditions. This form of impulsivity was not affected by dopaminergic medication status. Instead, medication impaired patients' ability to learn from negative decision outcomes. These findings implicate independent mechanisms leading to impulsivity in treated Parkinson's patients and were predicted by a single neurocomputational model of the basal ganglia."
https://openalex.org/W2111240301,"Altruism—benefiting fellow group members at a cost to oneself—and parochialism—hostility toward individuals not of one's own ethnic, racial, or other group—are common human behaviors. The intersection of the two—which we term “parochial altruism”—is puzzling from an evolutionary perspective because altruistic or parochial behavior reduces one's payoffs by comparison to what one would gain by eschewing these behaviors. But parochial altruism could have evolved if parochialism promoted intergroup hostilities and the combination of altruism and parochialism contributed to success in these conflicts. Our game-theoretic analysis and agent-based simulations show that under conditions likely to have been experienced by late Pleistocene and early Holocene humans, neither parochialism nor altruism would have been viable singly, but by promoting group conflict, they could have evolved jointly."
https://openalex.org/W2092632012,"Agricultural soil erosion is thought to perturb the global carbon cycle, but estimates of its effect range from a source of 1 petagram per year –1 to a sink of the same magnitude. By using caesium-137 and carbon inventory measurements from a large-scale survey, we found consistent evidence for an erosion-induced sink of atmospheric carbon equivalent to approximately 26% of the carbon transported by erosion. Based on this relationship, we estimated a global carbon sink of 0.12 (range 0.06 to 0.27) petagrams of carbon per year –1 resulting from erosion in the world's agricultural landscapes. Our analysis directly challenges the view that agricultural erosion represents an important source or sink for atmospheric CO 2 ."
https://openalex.org/W2170486501,"The study of animal foraging behaviour is of practical ecological importance, and exemplifies the wider scientific problem of optimizing search strategies. Lévy flights are random walks, the step lengths of which come from probability distributions with heavy power-law tails, such that clusters of short steps are connected by rare long steps. Lévy flights display fractal properties, have no typical scale, and occur in physical and chemical systems. An attempt to demonstrate their existence in a natural biological system presented evidence that wandering albatrosses perform Lévy flights when searching for prey on the ocean surface. This well known finding was followed by similar inferences about the search strategies of deer and bumblebees. These pioneering studies have triggered much theoretical work in physics (for example, refs 11, 12), as well as empirical ecological analyses regarding reindeer, microzooplankton, grey seals, spider monkeys and fishing boats. Here we analyse a new, high-resolution data set of wandering albatross flights, and find no evidence for Lévy flight behaviour. Instead we find that flight times are gamma distributed, with an exponential decay for the longest flights. We re-analyse the original albatross data using additional information, and conclude that the extremely long flights, essential for demonstrating Lévy flight behaviour, were spurious. Furthermore, we propose a widely applicable method to test for power-law distributions using likelihood and Akaike weights. We apply this to the four original deer and bumblebee data sets, finding that none exhibits evidence of Lévy flights, and that the original graphical approach is insufficient. Such a graphical approach has been adopted to conclude Lévy flight movement for other organisms, and to propose Lévy flight analysis as a potential real-time ecosystem monitoring tool. Our results question the strength of the empirical evidence for biological Lévy flights."
https://openalex.org/W1989619407,"Polar auxin transport is a factor in almost all developmental processes in plants but there is still much to be learned about how it operates. In cells, directional auxin transport is controlled by the PIN protein carrier complex. A new computational model has been developed to describe diffusion and PIN-facilitated auxin transport in and across the cells of the root system. The model addresses two major issues in plant development. First it supports the concept of an auxin maximum and gradient to guide root growth. Second, it shows how a single molecule can generate a field of information: a concentration gradient across the organ growth zone is closely associated with auxin maxima. A related paper shows that four PLETHORA genes are vital for root development and are candidate output factors for the auxin gradient. The PLETHORA (PLT) family of transcription factors are essential for defining the root stem cell niche. The PLT proteins are expressed in gradients with a high point in the stem cell area and act in a dose-dependent manner to dictate the size of the stem cell area and the size of the transit amplifying cells that make up the meristem. High levels of PLT activity promote stem cell identity and maintenance; lower levels promote division of stem cell daughters; and further reduced levels allow cell differentiation. Factors with a graded distribution can program fields of cells in a dose-dependent manner1,2, but no evidence has hitherto surfaced for such mechanisms in plants. In the Arabidopsis thaliana root, two PLETHORA (PLT) genes encoding AP2-domain transcription factors have been shown to maintain the activity of stem cells3. Here we show that a clade of four PLT homologues is necessary for root formation. Promoter activity and protein fusions of PLT homologues display gradient distributions with maxima in the stem cell area. PLT activities are largely additive and dosage dependent. High levels of PLT activity promote stem cell identity and maintenance; lower levels promote mitotic activity of stem cell daughters; and further reduction in levels is required for cell differentiation. Our findings indicate that PLT protein dosage is translated into distinct cellular responses."
https://openalex.org/W2133631519,"Uncertainties in projections of future climate change have not lessened substantially in past decades. Both models and observations yield broad probability distributions for long-term increases in global mean temperature expected from the doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide, with small but finite probabilities of very large increases. We show that the shape of these probability distributions is an inevitable and general consequence of the nature of the climate system, and we derive a simple analytic form for the shape that fits recent published distributions very well. We show that the breadth of the distribution and, in particular, the probability of large temperature increases are relatively insensitive to decreases in uncertainties associated with the underlying climate processes."
https://openalex.org/W1987188990,"Pathogenicity of many Gram-negative bacteria relies on the injection of effector proteins by type III secretion into eukaryotic cells, where they modulate host signaling pathways to the pathogen's benefit. One such effector protein injected by Xanthomonas into plants is AvrBs3, which localizes to the plant cell nucleus and causes hypertrophy of plant mesophyll cells. We show that AvrBs3 induces the expression of a master regulator of cell size, upa20 , which encodes a transcription factor containing a basic helix-loop-helix domain. AvrBs3 binds to a conserved element in the upa20 promoter via its central repeat region and induces gene expression through its activation domain. Thus, AvrBs3 and likely other members of this family provoke developmental reprogramming of host cells by mimicking eukaryotic transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W2050757906,"Plant disease resistance (R) proteins recognize matching pathogen avirulence proteins. Alleles of the pepper R gene Bs3 mediate recognition of the Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria ( Xcv ) type III effector protein AvrBs3 and its deletion derivative AvrBs3Δrep16. Pepper Bs3 and its allelic variant Bs3-E encode flavin monooxygenases with a previously unknown structure and are transcriptionally activated by the Xcv effector proteins AvrBs3 and AvrBs3Δrep16, respectively. We found that recognition specificity resides in the Bs3 and Bs3-E promoters and is determined by binding of AvrBs3 or AvrBs3Δrep16 to a defined promoter region. Our data suggest a recognition mechanism in which the Avr protein binds and activates the promoter of the cognate R gene."

https://openalex.org/W2157740440,"Carbohydrate recognition is biologically important but intrinsically challenging, for both nature and host-guest chemists. Saccharides are complex, subtly variable, and camouflaged by hydroxyl groups that hinder discrimination between substrate and water. We have developed a rational strategy for the biomimetic recognition of carbohydrates with all-equatorial stereochemistry (beta-glucose, analogs, and homologs) and have now applied it to disaccharides such as cellobiose. Our synthetic receptor showed good affinities, not unlike those of some lectins (carbohydrate-binding proteins). Binding was demonstrated by nuclear magnetic resonance, induced circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy, and calorimetry, all methods giving self-consistent results. Selectivity for the target substrates was exceptional; minor changes to disaccharide structure (for instance, cellobiose to lactose) caused almost complete suppression of complex formation."
https://openalex.org/W2055942616,"Polar ice-core records suggest that an arctic or boreal source was responsible for more than 30% of the large increase in global atmospheric methane (CH 4 ) concentration during deglacial climate warming; however, specific sources of that CH 4 are still debated. Here we present an estimate of past CH 4 flux during deglaciation from bubbling from thermokarst (thaw) lakes. Based on high rates of CH 4 bubbling from contemporary arctic thermokarst lakes, high CH 4 production potentials of organic matter from Pleistocene-aged frozen sediments, and estimates of the changing extent of these deposits as thermokarst lakes developed during deglaciation, we find that CH 4 bubbling from newly forming thermokarst lakes comprised 33 to 87% of the high-latitude increase in atmospheric methane concentration and, in turn, contributed to the climate warming at the Pleistocene-Holocene transition."
https://openalex.org/W1966095198,"Addiction profoundly alters motivational circuits so that drugs become powerful reinforcers of behavior. The interoceptive system continuously updates homeostatic and emotional information that are important elements in motivational decisions. We tested the idea that interoceptive information is essential in drug craving and in the behavioral signs of malaise. We inactivated the primary interoceptive cortex in amphetamine-experienced rats, which prevented the urge to seek amphetamine in a place preference task. Interoceptive insula inactivation also blunted the signs of malaise induced by acute lithium administration. Drug-seeking and malaise both induced Fos expression, a marker of neuronal activation, in the insula. We conclude that the insular cortex is a key structure in the perception of bodily needs that provides direction to motivated behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2020823827,"The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) regulates pigmentation in humans and other vertebrates. Variants of MC1R with reduced function are associated with pale skin color and red hair in humans of primarily European origin. We amplified and sequenced a fragment of the MC1R gene ( mc1r ) from two Neanderthal remains. Both specimens have a mutation that was not found in ∼3700 modern humans analyzed. Functional analyses show that this variant reduces MC1R activity to a level that alters hair and/or skin pigmentation in humans. The impaired activity of this variant suggests that Neanderthals varied in pigmentation levels, potentially on the scale observed in modern humans. Our data suggest that inactive MC1R variants evolved independently in both modern humans and Neanderthals."
https://openalex.org/W2120722044,"The conversion of a normal cell to a cancer cell occurs in several steps and typically involves the activation of oncogenes and the inactivation of tumour suppressor and pro-apoptotic genes. In many instances, inactivation of genes critical for cancer development occurs by epigenetic silencing, often involving hypermethylation of CpG-rich promoter regions. It remains to be determined whether silencing occurs by random acquisition of epigenetic marks that confer a selective growth advantage or through a specific pathway initiated by an oncogene. Here we perform a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen in K-ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells and identify 28 genes required for Ras-mediated epigenetic silencing of the pro-apoptotic Fas gene. At least nine of these RESEs (Ras epigenetic silencing effectors), including the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1, are directly associated with specific regions of the Fas promoter in K-ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells but not in untransformed NIH 3T3 cells. RNAi-mediated knockdown of any of the 28 RESEs results in failure to recruit DNMT1 to the Fas promoter, loss of Fas promoter hypermethylation, and derepression of Fas expression. Analysis of five other epigenetically repressed genes indicates that Ras directs the silencing of multiple unrelated genes through a largely common pathway. Last, we show that nine RESEs are required for anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenicity of K-ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells; these nine genes have not previously been implicated in transformation by Ras. Our results show that Ras-mediated epigenetic silencing occurs through a specific, complex, pathway involving components that are required for maintenance of a fully transformed phenotype."

Here, we report that Escherichia coli mazEF -mediated cell death is a population phenomenon requiring a quorum-sensing molecule that we call the extracellular death factor (EDF).

Similar transport has been inferred from telescopic observations of protoplanetary disks around young stars. Models for protoplanetary disks, however, have difficulty explaining the observed levels of transport. Here I report the results of a new two-dimensional model that shows that outward transport of high-temperature materials in protoplanetary disks is a natural outcome of disk formation and evolution. This outward transport occurs around the midplane of the disk."

https://openalex.org/W1998687450,"Our cognitive abilities in performing tasks are influenced by experienced competition/conflict between behavioral choices. To determine the role of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in the conflict detection-resolution process, we conducted complementary lesion and single-cell recording studies in monkeys that were resolving a conflict between two rules. We observed conflict-induced behavioral adjustment that persisted after lesions within the ACC but disappeared after lesions within the DLPFC. In the DLPFC, activity was modulated in some cells by the current conflict level and in other cells by the conflict experienced in the previous trial. These results show that the DLPFC, but not the ACC, is essential for the conflict-induced behavioral adjustment and suggest that encoding and maintenance of information about experienced conflict is mediated by the DLPFC."
https://openalex.org/W1965013631,"Alzheimer disease amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) is generated via proteolytic processing of the β-amyloid precursor protein by β- and γ-secretase. γ-Secretase can be blocked by selective inhibitors but can also be modulated by a subset of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including sulindac sulfide. These drugs selectively reduce the generation of the aggregation-prone 42-amino acid Aβ42 and concomitantly increase the levels of the rather benign Aβ38. Here we show that Aβ42 and Aβ38 generation occur independently from each other. The amount of Aβ42 produced by cells expressing 10 different familial Alzheimer disease (FAD)-associated mutations in presenilin (PS) 1, the catalytic subunit of γ-secretase, appeared to correlate with the respective age of onset in patients. However, Aβ38 levels did not show a negative correlation with the age of onset. Modulation of γ-secretase activity by sulindac sulfide reduced Aβ42 in the case of wild type PS1 and two FAD-associated PS1 mutations (M146L and A285V). The remaining eight PS1 FAD mutants showed either no reduction of Aβ42 or only rather subtle effects. Strikingly, even the mutations that showed no effect on Aβ42 levels allowed a robust increase of Aβ38 upon treatment with sulindac sulfide. Similar observations were made for fenofibrate, a compound known to increase Aβ42 and to decrease Aβ38. For mutants that predominantly produce Aβ42, the ability of fenofibrate to further increase Aβ42 levels became diminished, whereas Aβ38 levels were altered to varying extents for all mutants analyzed. Thus, we conclude that Aβ38 and Aβ42 production do not depend on each other. Using an independent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug derivative, we obtained similar results for PS1 as well as for PS2. These in vitro results were confirmed by in vivo experiments in transgenic mice expressing the PS2 N141I FAD mutant. Our findings therefore have strong implications on the selection of transgenic mouse models used for screening of the Aβ42-lowering capacity of γ-secretase modulators. Furthermore, human patients with certain PS mutations may not respond to γ-secretase modulators.

Originally it was purified as the building block of the disease-defining amyloid plaques. Now it is becoming clear that amyloid plaques are probably not the major neurotoxic entity in the disease rather this is an assembly of soluble oligomeric Aβ species (1Haass C. Selkoe D.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (3772) Google Scholar). These assemblies initiate the so-called amyloid cascade and finally induce abnormal phosphorylation of tau and subsequent formation of paired helical filaments (2Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (10646) Google Scholar). Aβ is generated by proteolytic processing of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP). Two proteases, β-secretase andγ-secretase, perform the cleavages on the N and C termini of the Aβ domain, respectively (3Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). β-Secretase is a conventional aspartyl protease, whereas γ-secretase is a rather unusual aspartyl protease capable of intramembraneous cleavage by utilization of a novel active site (4Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar) that is signified by a highly conserved GXGD motif that includes one of the two active site aspartyl residues (5Steiner H. Kostka M. Romig H. Basset G. Pesold B. Hardy J. Capell A. Meyn L. Grim M.G. Baumeister R. Fechteler K. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 848-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). γ-Secretase is a complex composed of four subunits, presenilin 1 (PS1) or PS2, APH-1a or APH-1b, PEN-2, and nicastrin. PS harbors the catalytically active center of the protease. Numerous familial Alzheimer disease (FAD)-associated mutations occur within the PSs. They all increase the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio. Since Aβ42 aggregates much faster than Aβ40, these mutations affect the kinetics of oligomer formation and aggregation (1Haass C. Selkoe D.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (3772) Google Scholar). amyloid β-peptide β-amyloid precursor protein familial Alzheimer disease non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug presenilin wild type human embryonic kidney matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry γ-secretase modulator 1. amyloid β-peptide β-amyloid precursor protein familial Alzheimer disease non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug presenilin wild type human embryonic kidney matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry γ-secretase modulator 1. Pharmacological inhibition of the secretases is a major therapeutic task. Unfortunately, the development of β-secretase inhibitors seems to be rather complicated (6Citron M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), and γ-secretase inhibitors caused major side effects in animal models and during clinical trials, due to the reduction of the biological function of γ-secretase in Notch signaling (3Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). However, modulators of γ-secretase activity, namely a subset of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or sulindac sulfide, selectively reduce the production of the aggregation-prone Aβ42 while leaving Notch signaling intact (7Beher D.

Nature. 2001; 414: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Concomitantly, they increase Aβ38 production (10Weggen S. Eriksen J.L. Das P. Sagi S.A. Wang R. Pietrzik C.U. Findlay K.A.

Therefore, there seems to be an equilibrium of Aβ42 and Aβ38 generation. Moreover, compounds such as fenofibrate, which are known to exhibit an opposite modulating activity by increasing Aβ42 production, reduce Aβ38 production (11Kukar T. Murphy M.P. Eriksen J.L.

Moreover, their modulating activity in terms of Aβ42 reduction is affected by some FAD-associated PS1 mutations. The PS1 Δexon9 mutation decreases the sensitivity of the γ-secretase to sulindac sulfide, whereas the PS1 M146L mutation enhances its sensitivity (13Weggen S. Eriksen J.L. Sagi S.A. Pietrzik C.U.

We now investigated the equilibrium of Aβ38 and Aβ42 generation in cells expressing wild type (WT) PS or FAD-associated PS mutations as well as in transgenic mice expressing WT PS2 or a FAD-associated PS2 mutation. Surprisingly, we found that Aβ38 and Aβ42 generation do not depend on each other. Moreover, Aβ38 and Aβ42 respond differentially to γ-secretase modulation depending on the PS mutation expressed. Antibodies—Monoclonal antibodies against the PS1 N terminus (PS1N) and against the PS2 large loop (BI.HF5c), as well as the poly- and monoclonal antibodies to Aβ (3552, 2D8), were described previously (16Shirotani K.

Winkler E. Xia X. Edbauer D. Murrell J. Capell A. Kaether C. Zheng H. Ghetti B. Haass C. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8025-8030Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). HEK293/sw cells were stably transfected with the indicated PS cDNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Pools of stably transfected PS cells were investigated to avoid clonal variations. Cells were plated at a density of 200,000 cells/well in poly-l-lysine-coated 24-well plates and incubated for 24 h. Thereafter, cells were incubated in 500 μl of fresh medium containing either 50 μm sulindac sulfide (Sigma), 100 μm fenofibrate (Sigma), 5 μm GSM-1 (Roche Applied Science), or vehicle (Me2SO) for 16 h before analysis of conditioned medium by sandwich immunoassay. Treatments were performed in triplicate, and all media samples were measured in duplicate for Aβ38, Aβ40, and Aβ42. PS Analysis—Cell lysates were obtained with STEN-lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitors (Sigma)) followed by ultra-centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Proteins were separated by 10% urea SDS-PAGE, and PS was analyzed by immunoblotting. Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Immunoprecipitation-MS analysis of Aβ species was carried out as described previously (18Fukumori A. Okochi M. Tagami S. Jiang J. Itoh N. Nakayama T. Yanagida K. Ishizuka-Katsura Y. Morihara T. Kamino K. Tanaka T. Kudo T. Tanii H. Ikuta A. Haass C. Takeda M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4907-4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, Aβ species were immunoprecipitated from conditioned medium from each cell line with antibody 82E1 for 4 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with immunoprecipitation-MS buffer (0.1% N-octylglucoside, 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0) and two times with distilled water. Immunoprecipitated peptides were eluted with 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid in 40% acetonitrile saturated with a-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid. The dissolved samples were dried on a stainless plate and subjected to MALDI-TOF MS analysis using Voyager DE STR (Applied Biosystems). Quantification of Secreted Aβ—Secreted Aβ peptides in conditioned medium were quantified by a sandwich immunoassay using the Meso Scale Discovery Sector Imager 2400. Streptavidin-coated 96-well Multi-Array plates were blocked in blocking buffer (0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) and then incubated with biotinylated 2D8 capture antibody diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer. Plates were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline-Tween before the addition of media samples and Aβ peptide standards (Bachem). Ruthenylated C-terminal-specific anti-Aβ38 (Meso Scale Discovery), anti-Aβ40 (BAP24), or anti-Aβ42 (BAP24) antibodies were diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer and used as detection antibodies. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 2 h before washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline-Tween and twice with phosphate-buffered saline. For detection, Meso Scale Discovery Read buffer was added, and the light emission at 620 nm after electrochemical stimulation was measured using the Meso Scale Discovery Sector Imager 2400 reader. The corresponding concentrations of Aβ peptides were calculated using the Meso Scale Discovery Discovery Workbench software. Ratios of each Aβ species as a percentage of total Aβ (Aβ38, Aβ40, and Aβ42) were then calculated, and graphs were plotted using the GraphPad Prism software.

In Vivo Experiments—Mice homozygous for huAPPSw (line 147.72H) (25Richards J.G. Higgins G.A. Ouagazzal A.M. Ozmen L. Kew J.N. Bohrmann B. Malherbe P. Brockhaus M. Loetscher H. Czech C. Huber G.

In these lines, the expression of human APPSw and human mutant PS2 is driven by the Thy-1 and prion promoters, respectively (25Richards J.G. Higgins G.A. Ouagazzal A.M. Ozmen L. Kew J.N. Bohrmann B. Malherbe P. Brockhaus M. Loetscher H. Czech C. Huber G. Bluethmann H. Jacobsen H. Kemp J.A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8989-9003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies were conducted with mice aged 2–3 months, because at this age cortical Aβ is primarily in a soluble form (27Hyde L.A. Kazdoba T.M. Grilli M. Lozza G. Brusa R. Zhang Q. Wong G.T. McCool M.F. Zhang L. Parker E.M. Higgins G.A. Behav. Brain Res. 2005; 160: 344-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Mice were sacrificed 4 h after a single oral administration of the drugs or vehicle. Brains were collected and frozen on dry ice until analysis of soluble cerebral Aβ. All in vivo experiments were conducted in strict adherence to the Swiss federal regulations on animal protection and to the rules of the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. Extraction and Quantification of Cerebral Aβ—For determination of Aβ38, Aβ40, Aβ42, and total Aβ, brain hemispheres were homogenized in 9 volumes of 1.0% diethylamine/50 mm sodium chloride, incubated for 3 h on ice, and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g (1 h, 4 °C). Supernatants were aliquoted and stored at –80 °C until assayed. Brain Aβ levels were determined using the Liquid Phase Electrochemiluminescent method as described in Narlawar et al. (28Narlawar R. Perez Revuelta B.I. Haass C. Steiner H. Schmidt B. Baumann K. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 7588-7591Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To study whether Aβ42 and Aβ38 production is coupled, we first investigated 10 selected PS1 FAD-linked mutations. Mutations were selected that cover a wide range of disease onsets (from ∼50 years in the case of the PS1 M146L and A285V mutations to less than 30 years in the case of the PS1 P117L and Y256S mutations). cDNA constructs encoding PS1 mutations as well as WT PS1 were stably transfected into HEK293 cells stably expressing Swedish mutant APP to facilitate analysis of secreted Aβ species. Cell lysates were then investigated for the replacement of endogenous PS2, which served as an indicator for successful ectopic expression of PS1 (29Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitsky T. Davenport F. Nordstedt C. Seeger M. Hardy J. Levey A.I. Gandy S.E. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, endogenous PS2 was fully replaced by PS1, demonstrating ectopic expression of all PS1 mutations. Due to overexpression, PS1 holoprotein accumulated for all mutants. In each case PS1 was endoproteolysed, with the exception of PS1 Δexon9, which is known not to undergo proteolytic processing (29Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitsky T. Davenport F. Nordstedt C. Seeger M. Hardy J. Levey A.I. Gandy S.E. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). We then determined the total levels of secreted Aβ38, Aβ40, and Aβ42. As expected, the PS1 mutations cover a wide spectrum of effects on Aβ42 production. This can range from a rather mild increase, as in the case of the PS1 M146L mutation, to a very severe increase as in the case of the PS1 L166P, G384A, M233V, P117L, and Y256S mutations (Fig. 1B). In line with our previous findings (17Moehlmann T. Winkler E. Xia X. Edbauer D. Murrell J. Capell A. Kaether C. Zheng H. Ghetti B. Haass C. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8025-8030Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), the increase of Aβ42 production seems to occur at the expense of Aβ40, because these levels gradually decrease with increased Aβ42 levels. These findings are also largely consistent with an inverse correlation of Aβ42 levels with age of onset (30Duering M. Grimm M.O. Grimm H.S. Schroder J. Hartmann T. Neurobiol. Aging. 2005; 26: 785-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In contrast, Aβ38 levels failed to show any negative correlation to Aβ42 levels (Fig. 1B, enlarged in lower panel), suggesting that Aβ42 is generated independently of Aβ38. Because alternative Aβ species with C termini other than amino acids 38, 40, or 42 could not be detected by the sandwich immunoassay, we also investigated Aβ species by qualitative mass spectrometry analysis. Although some additional species such as Aβ39 and Aβ43 were occasionally observed upon expression of certain mutations, Aβ38, Aβ40, and Aβ42 were the most abundant species for the majority of mutants (Fig. 1C). To further investigate whether Aβ38 and Aβ42 production are directly linked to each other, we treated cells with the NSAID sulindac sulfide. Sulindac sulfide is known to modulate γ-secretase activity by shifting the cleavage from amino acid 42 to amino acid 38 (10Weggen S. Eriksen J.L. Das P. Sagi S.A. Wang R. Pietrzik C.U. Findlay K.A. Smith T.E. Murphy M.P. Bulter T. Kang D.E. Marquez-Sterling N. Golde T.E. Koo E.H. Nature. 2001; 414: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). In line with previous findings, the PS1 M146L mutation showed slightly greater sensitivity to treatment with sulindac sulfide, whereas the PS1 Δexon9 and PS1 L166P mutations failed to respond to the Aβ42-lowering activity (13Weggen S. Eriksen J.L. Sagi S.A. Pietrzik C.U. Ozols V. Fauq A. Golde T.E. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31831-31837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 31Czirr E. Leuchtenberger S. Dorner-Ciossek C. Schneider A. Jucker M. Koo E.H. Pietrzik C.U. Baumann K. Weggen S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24504-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Furthermore, almost all other mutations with the exception of PS1 A285V showed only very little lowering of Aβ42 levels (Fig. 2). This suggests that these mutations render γ-secretase resistant to the modulating activity of sulindac sulfide. However, when we investigated the levels of secreted Aβ38, we found that all PS1 mutations, including those that showed no reduction of Aβ42 upon sulindac sulfide treatment such as PS1 Δexon9, L424R, and L166P, increased Aβ38 generation. Thus, some mutant γ-secretase complexes exhibit a selective resistance to the Aβ42-lowering activity of sulindac sulfide but remain sensitive to the Aβ38-modulating activity. This effect remained robust up to 100 μm sulindac sulfide, the maximum concentration tolerated by the cells (data not shown). Independent Aβ38 and Aβ42 production was further supported by treatment of cells with fenofibrate. Fenofibrate is a lipid-regulating drug that has been shown to exhibit opposite effects onγ-secretase modulation by increasing Aβ42 and decreasing Aβ38 as compared with NSAIDs like sulindac sulfide and indomethacin (11Kukar T. Murphy M.P. Eriksen J.L. Sagi S.A. Weggen S. Smith T.E. Ladd T. Khan M.A. Kache R. Beard J. Dodson M. Merit S. Ozols V.V. Anastasiadis P.Z. Das P. Fauq A. Koo E.H. Golde T.E. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Interestingly, all PS1 mutations were less sensitive to the Aβ42-increasing activity of fenofibrate compared with WT PS1 (Fig. 3). Moreover, the very aggressive mutations such as PS1 L166P, G384A, M233V, P117L, and Y256S showed only a minor increase of Aβ42 (Fig. 3). However, although some of the more aggressive mutations responded to a lesser degree with regard to the Aβ42-increasing activity, they showed similarly robust decreases of Aβ38 (Fig. 3). Other mutations, like PS1 Δexon9, ΔIM, L424R, and L166P, showed a somewhat diminished but still significant reduction of Aβ38 (Fig. 3). Thus, some PS1 mutations render the γ-secretase complex in a way that it becomes more or less resistant to Aβ42 modulation, but, strikingly, this occurs independently of the Aβ38-modulating activity. The observed effects on γ-secretase modulation are not restricted to PS1 mutations and the use of sulindac sulfide. We tested a novel NSAID derivative with a lower IC50 for γ-secretase modulation (Fig. 4A, GSM-1). Treatment of cells expressing WT PS1 with as little as 5 μm of this compound caused a significant increase in Aβ38 and a significant decrease in Aβ42 (Fig. 4B). Consistent with sulindac sulfide treatment, cells expressing L166P showed no change in Aβ42 levels despite a highly robust and significant increase in Aβ38 (Fig. 4B). To determine whether this effect was specific for PS1, we investigated cells expressing WT PS2 and PS2 harboring the “Volga German” mutation (PS2 N141I). Treatment of cells expressing WT PS2 with GSM-1 caused a significant increase in Aβ38 and a significant decrease in Aβ42 (Fig. 4C); however, not much change in Aβ42 was observed for PS2 N141I despite a significant increase in Aβ38 (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, WT PS2-expressing cells showed a much stronger increase of Aβ38 compared with cells expressing WT PS1 (Fig. 4, B and C). To prove that γ-secretase modulators differentially affect Aβ42 and Aβ38 production in vivo, we compared the effect of the in vivo active modulator GSM-1 in transgenic mice expressing APP-Swe or APP-Swe/PS2 N141I (Fig. 5). The modulator GSM-1 significantly reduced brain Aβ42 levels (by 69% at 30 mg/kg) in the APP-Swe mice together with a corresponding increase of brain Aβ38 levels (>4-fold at 30 mg/kg) in a dose-dependent manner. No significant effect on brain Aβ40 could be observed (Fig. 5A). When tested in the double transgenic APP-Swe/PS2 N141I line, GSM-1 did not induce any significant reduction of brain Aβ42. However, it led to a significant dose-dependent increase of brain Aβ38. At the highest dose of 30 mg/kg, a significant reduction of brain Aβ40 of 27% could also be detected in the double transgenic line (Fig. 5B). Additionally, the effect of the γ-secretase inhibitor MRK-560 in these two transgenic lines is different for the mutant PS2; although brain Aβ40 and Aβ42 is reduced to the same extent (86 and 87%, respectively) in the single APP-Swe transgenic line, there is a pronounced difference in the APP-Swe/PS2 N141I double transgenic line (95 and 44% for Aβ40 and Aβ42, respectively). This result is consistent with a previous finding in mice transgenic for the PS1 L166P mutation (31Czirr E. Leuchtenberger S. Dorner-Ciossek C. Schneider A. Jucker M. Koo E.H. Pietrzik C.U. Baumann K. Weggen S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24504-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), suggesting that reduced sensitivity to γ-secretase inhibitors in respect to Aβ42 production may be common among strong FAD-associated PS mutants. Finally, the modulator GSM-1 does not alter the total amount of brain Aβ, although total Aβ is reduced by the inhibitor MRK-560 (by 71% in the single transgenic line and by 64% in the double transgenic line). Since the first description of the γ-secretase-modulating activity of NSAIDs, it was widely assumed that Aβ42 and Aβ38 generation are mutually dependent as decreased/increased Aβ42 production correlated with increased/decreased Aβ38 generation (10Weggen S. Eriksen J.L. Das P. Sagi S.A. Wang R. Pietrzik C.U. Findlay K.A. Smith T.E. Murphy M.P. Bulter T. Kang D.E. Marquez-Sterling N. Golde T.E. Koo E.H.

Ozols V.V. Anastasiadis P.Z. Das P. Fauq A. Koo E.H. Golde T.E. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Our findings now demonstrate that Aβ38 generation is not coupled to Aβ42 production. This is shown by the lack of a negative correlation of Aβ38 levels with Aβ42 levels in the 10 different PS1 mutations investigated. Moreover, some FAD-associated PS mutations make the γ-secretase complex at least partially resistant to the Aβ42-lowering activity of NSAIDs or the Aβ42-increasing activity of fenofibrate, while they are still sensitive to the corresponding Aβ38-modulating activity. There appears to be no correlation between the severity of the mutation and the responsiveness to Aβ38 modulation. Currently, the cellular mechanisms that allow a selective modulation of these cleavages are not fully understood. However, studies using fluorescence resonance energy transfer methods suggest that NSAIDs allosterically affect the conformation of PS and, probably as a consequence, the PS1/APP interaction (15Lleo A.

Moreover, FAD-associated PS mutations also affect the structure of the active site by changing the spatial relation of the PS1 N- and C-terminal fragments, in a manner opposing the effect of Aβ42-lowering NSAIDs (15Lleo A.

All this suggests that NSAIDs directly or indirectly affect PS conformation and γ-secretase activity. However, other data imply that NSAIDs may affect intramembrane dimerization of APP and thereby influence γ-secretase processing at its variable sites (33Munter L.M. Voigt P. Harmeier A. Kaden D. Gottschalk K.E. Weise C. Pipkorn R. Schaefer M. Langosch D. Multhaup G. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1702-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Our data support the idea that NSAIDs affect PS activity directly or indirectly. A conformational change induced by NSAIDs may affect substrate cleavage at selective sites, which is well known for FAD-associated PS mutations. If mutant PS adopts a certain pathological conformation, which in the case of the aggressive mutations allows production of very high levels of Aβ42, this structure may not be changed any more by NSAIDs or fenofibrate. Under these conditions, further and efficient trimming of the substrate at position 38 of the Aβ domain may still be possible, thus still permitting the Aβ38-modulating activity of NSAIDs. In addition, NSAIDs may affect substrate structure/position within the active site by changing its conformation. Our data have strong implications for animal models selected for in vivo analysis of NSAIDs. So far, only transgenic mice with a FAD-associated APP mutation have been investigated, and in these cases NSAIDs show their expected activity (8Eriksen J.L. Sagi S.A. Smith T.E. Weggen S. Das P.

However, many laboratories use transgenic mice overexpressing APP in combination with more or less aggressive PS mutations to enhance and accelerate amyloid plaque formation. Our data from the PS2 N141I mouse are in agreement with recent data from the PS1 L166P mouse (31Czirr E. Leuchtenberger S. Dorner-Ciossek C. Schneider A. Jucker M. Koo E.H. Pietrzik C.U. Baumann K.

Such models will lead to a false interpretation of the in vivo activity of NSAIDs and potentially other drugs, because the Aβ42-modulating activity of such drugs may be strongly compromised. Moreover, our findings also indicate that patients carrying aggressive PS1 or PS2 FAD mutations will not respond to NSAID treatment."

Plant response to cold and freezing involves three distinct phases: cold acclimation, freezing, and post-freezing recovery. Considerable progress has been made toward understanding lipid changes during cold acclimation and freezing, but little is known about lipid alteration during post-freezing recovery. We previously showed that phospholipase D (PLD) is involved in lipid hydrolysis and Arabidopsis thaliana freezing tolerance. This study was undertaken to determine how lipid species change during post-freezing recovery and to determine the effect of two PLDs, PLDα1 and PLDδ, on lipid changes during post-freezing recovery. During post-freezing recovery, hydrolysis of plastidic lipids, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol and plastidic phosphatidylglycerol, is the most prominent change. In contrast, during freezing, hydrolysis of extraplastidic phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, occurs. Suppression of PLDα1 decreased phospholipid hydrolysis and phosphatidic acid production in both the freezing and post-freezing phases, whereas ablation of PLDδ increased lipid hydrolysis and phosphatidic acid production during post-freezing recovery. Thus, distinctly different changes in lipid hydrolysis occur in freezing and post-freezing recovery. The presence of PLDα1 correlates with phospholipid hydrolysis in both freezing and post-freezing phases, whereas the presence of PLDδ correlates with reduced lipid hydrolysis during post-freezing recovery. These data suggest a negative role for PLDα1 and a positive role for PLDδ in freezing tolerance.

This study was undertaken to determine how lipid species change during post-freezing recovery and to determine the effect of two PLDs, PLDα1 and PLDδ, on lipid changes during post-freezing recovery. During post-freezing recovery, hydrolysis of plastidic lipids, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol and plastidic phosphatidylglycerol, is the most prominent change. In contrast, during freezing, hydrolysis of extraplastidic phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, occurs. Suppression of PLDα1 decreased phospholipid hydrolysis and phosphatidic acid production in both the freezing and post-freezing phases, whereas ablation of PLDδ increased lipid hydrolysis and phosphatidic acid production during post-freezing recovery. Thus, distinctly different changes in lipid hydrolysis occur in freezing and post-freezing recovery. The presence of PLDα1 correlates with phospholipid hydrolysis in both freezing and post-freezing phases, whereas the presence of PLDδ correlates with reduced lipid hydrolysis during post-freezing recovery. These data suggest a negative role for PLDα1 and a positive role for PLDδ in freezing tolerance. Low temperature stress, such as freezing, causes great agricultural losses. The ability of plants to endure and survive at low temperatures is a major determinant of plant productivity and geographic distribution (1Boyer J.S. Science. 1982; 218: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (2844) Google Scholar). Membranes are major injury sites during plant freezing (2Levitt J. 2nd Ed. Responses of Plants to Environmental Stresses: Chilling, Freezing and High Temperature Stresses. 1. Academic Press, New York1980: 254-258Google Scholar, 3Sakai A. Larcher W. Frost Survival of Plants. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1987: 41-47Google Scholar), and membrane lipids undergo substantial changes when plants are exposed to low temperatures (4Uemura M. Joseph R.A. Steponkus P.L. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Plant response to cold and freezing can be divided into three distinct phases: cold acclimation, freezing, and post-freezing recovery. During cold acclimation, the degree of fatty acid unsaturation and the content of phospholipids increase (5Welti R. Li W. Li M. Sang Y. Biesiada H. Zhou H.E. Rajashekar C.B. Williams T.D. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31994-32002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Such alterations are thought to enhance membrane fluidity and reduce the propensity of cellular membranes to undergo freezing-induced non-bilayer phase formation, thus enhancing membrane integrity and cellular function during freezing (4Uemura M. Joseph R.A. Steponkus P.L. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). During freezing, dramatic lipid alterations take place in both extraplastidic and plastidic membranes. In extraplastidic membranes, there are increases in PA 2The abbreviations used are:PAphosphatidic acidCAcold acclimationDGDGdigalactosyldiacylglycerolESIelectrospray ionizationlysoPClysophosphatidylcholinelysoPGlysophosphatidylglycerollysoPElysophosphatidylethanolaminelysoPLlysophospholipidsMS/MStandem mass spectrometryMGDGmonogalactosyldiacylglycerolPCphosphatidylcholinePEphosphatidylethanolaminePGphosphatidylglycerolPLAphospholipase APLCphospholipase CPLDphospholipase DColColumbia ecotypeWSWassilewskija ecotypePFRpost-freezing recovery 2The abbreviations used are:PAphosphatidic acidCAcold acclimationDGDGdigalactosyldiacylglycerolESIelectrospray ionizationlysoPClysophosphatidylcholinelysoPGlysophosphatidylglycerollysoPElysophosphatidylethanolaminelysoPLlysophospholipidsMS/MStandem mass spectrometryMGDGmonogalactosyldiacylglycerolPCphosphatidylcholinePEphosphatidylethanolaminePGphosphatidylglycerolPLAphospholipase APLCphospholipase CPLDphospholipase DColColumbia ecotypeWSWassilewskija ecotypePFRpost-freezing recovery and lysophospholipids and decreases in phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE); in plastidic membranes, there are decreases in monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) (5Welti R.

The recovery phase involves tissue thawing, cellular rehydration, restoration of cell structure, and resumption of cellular activities. The ability to successfully undergo these processes, many of which depend on membranes, is critical for cellular survival after freezing. However, little, if anything, is known about metabolism of the membrane lipid species, which were altered during cold acclimation and freezing, in the post-freezing phase. phosphatidic acid cold acclimation digalactosyldiacylglycerol electrospray ionization lysophosphatidylcholine lysophosphatidylglycerol lysophosphatidylethanolamine lysophospholipids tandem mass spectrometry monogalactosyldiacylglycerol phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylglycerol phospholipase A phospholipase C phospholipase D Columbia ecotype Wassilewskija ecotype post-freezing recovery phosphatidic acid cold acclimation digalactosyldiacylglycerol electrospray ionization lysophosphatidylcholine lysophosphatidylglycerol lysophosphatidylethanolamine lysophospholipids tandem mass spectrometry monogalactosyldiacylglycerol phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylglycerol phospholipase A phospholipase C phospholipase D Columbia ecotype Wassilewskija ecotype post-freezing recovery In plants, several lipolytic enzymatic activities have been described, including PLD, PLA, PLC, nonspecific acylhydrolase, and galactolipases (6Wang X. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2004; 7: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). PLDs are involved in the hydrolysis of phospholipids into PA and a head group. Recently, we have shown that PLDα1 and PLDδ, the two most abundant PLDs of the 12-member Arabidopsis PLD family, play important roles in freezing tolerance (5Welti R. Li W. Li M. Sang Y. Biesiada H. Zhou H.E. Rajashekar C.B. Williams T.D. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31994-32002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 7Li W. Li M. Zhang W. Welti R. Wang X. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Comparative profiling of leaves from PLDα1-deficient and wild-type plants led to the conclusion that freezing-induced PA is derived primarily from PC and that PLDα1 is responsible for ∼50% of the PA formed during freezing. The lower ratio of PA to PC after freezing was proposed to be the basis for the greater freezing tolerance of PLDα1-deficient plants (5Welti R. Li W. Li M. Sang Y. Biesiada H. Zhou H.E. Rajashekar C.B. Williams T.D. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31994-32002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). In contrast, ablation of PLDδ rendered Arabidopsis more sensitive to freezing and caused just a subtle reduction in PA levels compared with wild type (7Li W. Li M. Zhang W. Welti R. Wang X. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). It was proposed that PLDδ enhances freezing tolerance by mitigating post-freezing damage and cell death (7Li W. Li M. Zhang W. Welti R. Wang X. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The effects of PLDα1 and PLDδ on lipid changes during post-freezing recovery have not previously been described. This study was undertaken to determine: (i) how membrane glycerolipid species change during post-freezing recovery and (ii) the involvement of PLDα1 and PLDδ in the lipid changes. Plant Materials—A PLDα1-deficient mutant was generated previously by antisense suppression from Arabidopsis (Columbia ecotype (Col)) (19Fan L. Zheng S. Wang X. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 2183-2196PubMed Google Scholar). A PLDδ-knockout mutant was previously isolated from Arabidopsis (Wassilewskija ecotype (WS)) (18Zhang W. Wang C. Qin C. Wood T. Olafsdottir G. Welti R. Wang X. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 2285-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The loss of PLDα1 and PLDδ was confirmed by the absence of the transcript, protein, and activity of PLDα1 or PLDδ (18Zhang W. Wang C. Qin C. Wood T. Olafsdottir G. Welti R. Wang X. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 2285-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 19Fan L. Zheng S. Wang X. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 2183-2196PubMed Google Scholar). Growth Conditions and Treatments—Four Arabidopsis genotypes were grown in Scotts Metromix soil. The pots with seeds were kept at 4 °C for 2 days and then moved to a growth chamber at 23 °C (day) and 19 °C (night) with fluorescent lighting of 120 μmol·m-2·s-1, 60% relative humidity, and a 12-h photoperiod. For cold acclimation, 4-week-old plants were placed at 4 °C for 3 days under light of 30 μmol·m-2·s-1. For freezing, cold-acclimated plants were subjected to a temperature drop from 4 to -2 °C at 3 °C/h in the growth chamber. The temperature was held at -2 °C for 2 h, and ice chips were placed on the soil to induce crystallization and prevent supercooling. The temperature was lowered to -8 °C at 1 °C/h and was held at -8 °C for 2 h before sampling. For post-freezing recovery, the temperature was raised to 4 °C at 1 °C/h and was held at 4 °C for 12 h before sampling. Different plants were used for each analysis. Lipid Extraction and ESI-MS/MS Analysis—The process of lipid extraction, ESI-MS/MS analysis, and quantification was performed as described previously with minor modifications (5Welti R. Li W. Li M. Sang Y. Biesiada H. Zhou H.E. Rajashekar C.B. Williams T.D. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31994-32002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 8Devaiah S.P. Roth M.R. Baughman E. Li M. Tamura P. Jeannotte R. Welti R. Wang X. Phytochemistry. 2006; 67: 1907-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Briefly, the above-ground rosettes of two or three different plants were cut at sampling time and, to inhibit lipolytic activities, were transferred immediately into 3 ml of isopropanol with 0.01% butylated hydroxytoluene at 75 °C. The tissue was extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1) three additional times with 2 h of agitation each time. The remaining plant tissue was heated overnight at 105 °C and weighed. The weights of these extracted and dried tissues are described as “dry weight” of the plants. Lipid samples were analyzed on a triple quadrupole MS/MS equipped for ESI. Data processing was performed as previously described (5Welti R. Li W. Li M. Sang Y. Biesiada H. Zhou H.E. Rajashekar C.B. Williams T.D. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31994-32002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 8Devaiah S.P. Roth M.R. Baughman E. Li M. Tamura P. Jeannotte R. Welti R. Wang X. Phytochemistry. 2006; 67: 1907-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The lipids in each class were quantified in comparison to two internal standards of the class. Five replicates of each treatment for each genotype were analyzed. The Q-test was performed on the total amount of lipid in each head group class, and data from discordant samples were removed (5Welti R. Li W. Li M. Sang Y. Biesiada H. Zhou H.E. Rajashekar C.B. Williams T.D. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31994-32002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Paired values were subjected to the t test to determine statistical significance. Hierarchal clustering analysis was performed using Genespring version 7.2 (Silicon Genetics). RNA Extraction and Microarray Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from three independent Arabidopsis (Col) plants for each treatment using RNAiso reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (TaKaRa). cRNA preparation and microarray hybridization were performed following the manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix). The probe array scanning was performed with GCOS (Affymetrix GeneChip Operating Software, Version 1.4), and data were analyzed with Genespring version 7.2. Large Changes in Lipid Profiles Occur during Freezing and Post-freezing Recovery—Using an ESI-MS/MS-based lipid profiling approach, this study identified and quantified 108 glycerolipid molecular species, during cold acclimation, freezing, and post-freezing recovery (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 and Table 1). Two Arabidopsis ecotypes, Col and WS, were employed to examine the patterns of membrane lipid changes in different ecotypes in freezing responses.FIGURE 2Changes in lipid molecular species during CA, freezing, and PFR in Arabidopsis.

Open table in a new tab The values are means ± S.D. (n = 4 or 5). To gain an overall appreciation of the effects of freezing and post-freezing recovery treatments in conjunction with PLD deficiency, hierarchal clustering of the lipid profiles was applied (Fig. 1). In the left panel, which shows the relationships among lipid profiles of wild-type (Col) and PLDα1-deficient plants subjected to various treatments, the major difference among the treatments and genotypes was between the cold-acclimated plants and plants that have been subjected to freezing, including those that have undergone post-freezing recovery. A close relationship between cold-acclimated wild-type and PLDα1-deficient plants (first two columns) implies that PLDα1 deficiency had little effect on lipid profile during cold acclimation. Among the plants subjected to freezing, the largest difference in lipid profile patterns was between wild-type (third and fourth columns) and PLDα1-deficient plants (fifth and sixth columns), indicating that wild-type and PLDα1-deficient plants responded differently to freezing. The closer relationship between the plants within each genotype subjected to freezing only in comparison to post-freezing recovery (third versus fourth and fifth versus sixth columns) indicates that the lipid compositional changes that occurred during post-freezing recovery were smaller than those that occurred during freezing. In the right panel, which shows the relationships among lipid profiles of wild-type (WS) and PLDδ-deficient plants subjected to various treatments, the major difference among the treatments and genotypes was also between the cold-acclimated and the plants that were subjected to freezing, including those that underwent post-freezing recovery. Again, the close relationship between cold-acclimated wild-type and the PLD-deficient plants (this time PLDδ; first two columns) indicates that the deficiency had little effect on lipid profile during cold acclimation. Among the plants subjected to freezing, the largest differences were among plants within a genotype subjected to freezing only and those subjected to freezing plus post-freezing recovery (third compared with fifth and fourth compared with sixth columns). In comparison to the clustering with PLDα1-deficient plants and the corresponding wild-type (left panel), this arrangement suggests that PLDδ deficiency affects plant leaf response to freezing less than PLDα1 deficiency. Assessing the role of PLDδ deficiency in post-freezing recovery from the hierarchal clustering is difficult; whereas the relationships indicate that PLDδ-deficient plants undergoing post-freezing recovery were slightly less changed than wild-type plants undergoing post-freezing recovery, it is clear that various lipid species were affected differentially and more detailed analysis, as included below, is required. Lipid Changes during Post-freezing Recovery Differ from Changes during Freezing—Detailed analysis of the lipid profiles indicates that changes in phospholipids and galactolipids in the two ecotypes were similar during cold acclimation, freezing, and post-freezing recovery (Figs. 2, 3, 4 and 5, left panels, and Table 1), except for minor differences in PA species 36:4, 36:5, and 36:6 (total acyl chains: double bonds; Figs. 2 and 3), and in lysophospholipid and lysoPE species 18:2 and 18:3 (Figs. 4 and 5). Compared with the lipid levels of cold-acclimated Arabidopsis, at -8 °C, a sublethal-freezing temperature for cold-acclimated Arabidopsis, the amount of almost every molecular species of PG, PC, and PE decreased, with the 36:4 and 36:5 species contributing the most to the decline in PE and PC levels. The level of PC decreased 46%, PE 37%, and PG 36% in Col plants (Table 1). In contrast, the levels of the lipid metabolites, PA and lysophospholipids, increased, and changes during freezing in galactolipids MGDG and DGDG were small. Similar trends were observed in WS plants (Table 1). Changes in lipid species during post-freezing recovery differed from those that occurred during freezing. In the post-freezing phase there was no decrease in PC and PE; in fact the amounts of these lipids tended to increase, suggesting net synthesis of these lipid classes. On the other hand, there was a decrease in the plastidic galactolipid MGDG; in particular, the level of MGDG decreased 35% in Col plants and 31% in WS plants. There also tended to be a decrease in the plastidic components, DGDG and PG. The decline indicates lipid degradation in this compartment during tissue thawing. Thus, plastidic lipids were declining while synthesis of extraplastidic lipids was occurring during post-freezing recovery. Plastidic PG Is Hydrolyzed to PA by PLDα1 during Post-freezing Recovery—Analysis of molecular species in Col, WS, and PLDδ-knockout mutant plants (PLDδ-deficient) reveals that the levels of 34:4 PA during post-freezing recovery were 3- to 15-fold higher than during freezing (Figs. 2 and 3), whereas other PA species were nearly unchanged, or in some cases were decreased (Figs. 2 and 3). Product ion analysis of the 34:4 PA showed that this species contains 18:3 and 16:1 acyl groups (8Devaiah S.P. Roth M.R. Baughman E. Li M. Tamura P. Jeannotte R. Welti R. Wang X. Phytochemistry. 2006; 67: 1907-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). 18:3-16:1 PG is most prevalent PG species, but an 18:3/16:1 combination is found in only minor amounts in other glycerolipids (5Welti R. Li W. Li M. Sang Y. Biesiada H. Zhou H.E. Rajashekar C.B. Williams T.D. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31994-32002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 8Devaiah S.P.

Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2007; 18: 783-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus the 34:4 diacylglycerol moiety serves as a marker for PG, and its presence in PA suggests that the hydrolysis of PG to PA is a specific response of Arabidopsis to post-freezing recovery. Furthermore, because 16:1-containing PG species are specifically produced in plastidic membranes (10Marechal E. Block M.A. Dorne A.J. Joyard J. Physiol Plant. 1997; 100: 65-77Crossref Google Scholar), the hydrolysis of 34:4 PG to 34:4 PA indicates that lipid degradation during post-freezing recovery occurs in plastids. The conclusion that 34:4 PA is derived from 34:4 PG hydrolysis is also supported by quantitative changes in the two lipids during post-freezing recovery (Table 2). Decreases in 34:4 PG were 0.8, 1.5, and 1.6 nmol/mg in Col, WS, and PLDδ-deficient mutant plants, respectively. The decline was matched with increases in 34:4 PA of 0.7, 1.0, an"

SPP-like (SPPL) proteases, such as SPPL2a, SPPL2b, SPPL2c, and SPPL3, also belong to the GXGD family. In contrast to γ-secretase, for which numerous substrates have been identified, very few in vivo substrates are known for SPP and SPPLs. Here we demonstrate that Bri2 (Itm2b), a type II-oriented transmembrane protein associated with familial British and Danish dementia, undergoes regulated intramembrane proteolysis. In addition to the previously described ectodomain processing by furin and related proteases, we now describe that the Bri2 protein, similar to γ-secretase substrates, undergoes an additional cleavage by ADAM10 in its ectodomain. This cleavage releases a soluble variant of Bri2, the BRICHOS domain, which is secreted into the extracellular space. Upon this shedding event, a membrane-bound Bri2 N-terminal fragment remains, which undergoes intramembrane proteolysis to produce an intracellular domain as well as a secreted low molecular weight C-terminal peptide. By expressing all known SPP/SPPL family members as well as their loss of function variants, we demonstrate that selectively SPPL2a and SPPL2b mediate the intramembrane cleavage, whereas neither SPP nor SPPL3 is capable of processing the Bri2 N-terminal fragment.

Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). RIP is required for reverse signaling and degradation of membrane-retained stubs of certain substrates (1Weihofen A. Martoglio B. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 71-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In a typical example, RIP describes two proteolytic processing steps. First, a large part of the ectodomain is shed and secreted. Subsequently, intramembrane proteolysis cleaves the remaining membrane-bound fragment into two peptides, the intracellular domain (ICD) and a small peptide, which is secreted. Until recently, proteolysis within the membrane was believed to be rather impossible because water molecules, known to be required for hydrolysis of peptide bonds, may have difficulties to penetrate the hydrophobic membrane. However, currently members of three different intramembrane-cleaving protease families are known. All are polytopic proteins with their catalytic sites most likely embedded within their transmembrane domains (1Weihofen A. Martoglio B. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 71-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Intramembrane-cleaving metalloproteases are represented by the site-2 protease (3Sakai J.

Site-2 protease (S2P) is required for the regulation of cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis via the liberation of the membrane-bound transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) by intramembrane proteolysis. In addition, site-2 protease is also involved in intramembrane processing of ATF6, a protein required for chaperone expression during unfolded protein response. Prior to intramembrane cleavage, both substrates are first shed by a luminal cleavage via site-1 protease (6Ye J. Rawson R.B. Komuro R. Chen X. Dave U.P. Prywes R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol.

Intramembrane-cleaving serine proteases are represented by the growing family of rhomboids. At least Drosophila rhomboids are known to be involved in intramembrane proteolysis of Spitz, Gurken, and Keren. Their cleavage is required for epidermal growth factor receptor signaling (7Lee J.R. Urban S. Garvey C.F. Freeman M. Cell. 2001; 107: 161-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 8Urban S. Lee J.R. Freeman M.

Rhomboids are the first intramembrane-cleaving proteases for which crystal structures could be resolved (10Wang Y. Zhang Y. Ha Y.

The crystal structures suggest that their catalytically active Ser-His dyad and water molecules are indeed embedded within the interior of the membrane. The family of intramembrane-cleaving aspartyl proteases is represented by γ-secretase, the signal peptide peptidase (SPP) (15Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), its homologues the SPP-like (SPPL) proteases (1Weihofen A. Martoglio B.

Taylor R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1502-1510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). γ-Secretase is a complex composed of presenilin-1 or presenilin-2, nicastrin, APH-1 (anterior pharynx defective-1), and PEN-2 (presenilin enhancer-2) (20Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Presenilin is the catalytically active component of the γ-secretase complex (21Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar) and contains the GXGD protease active site motif (22Steiner H. Kostka M. Romig H. Basset G. Pesold B. Hardy J. Capell A. Meyn L. Grim M.G. Baumeister R. Fechteler K. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 848-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). γ-Secretase cleaves numerous type I substrates including Notch and the β-amyloid precursor protein (20Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 23Mumm J.S. Kopan R. Dev. Biol. 2000; 228: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 24Bentahir M. Nyabi O. Verhamme J. Tolia A. Horre K. Wiltfang J. Esselmann H. De Strooper B. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In both cases, the ICDs of the substrates are released to the cytosol. Although the Notch ICD is required for reverse signaling, a functional role of the β-amyloid precursor protein ICD is currently under debate (20Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 24Bentahir M. Nyabi O. Verhamme J. Tolia A. Horre K. Wiltfang J. Esselmann H. De Strooper B. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), and for a number of other substrates the function of the ICD is unknown. Besides the ICDs, γ-secretase also liberates the amyloid β-peptide and the corresponding Notch β-peptide (25Okochi M. Steiner H. Fukumori A. Tanii H. Tomita T. Tanaka T. Iwatsubo T. Kudo T. Takeda M. Haass C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5408-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Amyloid β-peptide accumulates in amyloid plaques and vascular deposits characteristic for Alzheimer disease. Although γ-secretase only accepts type I-oriented substrates, members of the SPP family are required for intramembrane proteolysis of type II transmembrane proteins (1Weihofen A. Martoglio B. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 71-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). SPP family members are differentially located within the cells (26Krawitz P. Haffner C.

Vreugde S. Lichtenthaler S.F. Kuhn P.H. Stauffer D. Rovelli G. Martoglio B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). SPP and SPPL3 are predominantly observed within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi, whereas SPPL2a and SPPL2b are additionally found in late Golgi compartments and endosomes/lysosomes (26Krawitz P. Haffner C. Fluhrer R. Steiner H. Schmid B. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39515-39523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Consistent with its subcellular localization, SPP is required for the removal of signal peptides from the ER membrane (15Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Beside its function in removal of signal peptides, SPP is also involved in immune surveillance and intramembrane cleavage of the hepatitis C viral core protein (15Weihofen A. Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 28Loureiro J. Lilley B.N. Spooner E. Noriega V. Tortorella D. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 2006; 441: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). No substrate has so far been identified for the ER/Golgi located SPPL3. For SPPL2a and SPPL2b currently two in vivo substrates, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and the Fas ligand, are known (27Friedmann E. Hauben E. Maylandt K. Schleeger S. Vreugde S. Lichtenthaler S.F.

The ectodomains of both substrates undergo shedding by members of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family. TNFα is further processed by intramembrane cleavages of SPPL2a/SPPL2b to produce the TNFα ICD and the secreted TNFα C domain (29Fluhrer R. Grammer G. Israel L. Condron M.M. Haffner C. Friedmann E. Bohland C. Imhof A. Martoglio B. Teplow D.B. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 894-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The TNFα ICD triggers expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-12 in dendritic cells (27Friedmann E. Hauben E. Maylandt K. Schleeger S. Vreugde S. Lichtenthaler S.F. Kuhn P.H. Stauffer D. Rovelli G. Martoglio B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Because of the restricted cell and tissue specific expression of TNFα and FasL, additional substrates for SPPL2a/SPPL2b are to be expected. We therefore investigated the type II-oriented transmembrane protein Bri2, also known as Itm2b, which is the precursor of the ABri amyloid protein (31Vidal R. Frangione B. Rostagno A. Mead S. Revesz T. Plant G. Ghiso J. Nature. 1999; 399: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). For clarity, we will use the term Bri2 throughout the manuscript. Bri2 undergoes processing by furin and related proteases within its ectodomain (32Kim S.H. Creemers J.W. Chu S. Thinakaran G. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1872-1877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 33Kim S.H. Wang R. Gordon D.J. Bass J. Steiner D.F. Lynn D.G. Thinakaran G. Meredith S.C. Sisodia S.S. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 984-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), which leads to the release of its 4-kDa C-terminal propeptide. Mutations of the stop codon in the bri2 (itm2b) gene are responsible for the generation of a longer open reading frame, therefore causing the release of a longer propeptide by furin-mediated proteolysis (31Vidal R. Frangione B. Rostagno A. Mead S. Revesz T. Plant G. Ghiso J. Nature. 1999; 399: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 32Kim S.H. Creemers J.W. Chu S. Thinakaran G. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol.

The mutant Bri2 amyloid propeptides (ABri) tend to aggregate into oligomers, protofibrils, and further into amyloid deposits and cause familial British (31Vidal R. Frangione B. Rostagno A. Mead S.

Surprisingly, in addition to the furin-mediated release of the C-terminal propeptide, a large part of the remaining ectodomain, the so-called BRICHOS domain, is shed by ADAM10 and released to the extracellular space. The remaining membrane-associated N-terminal fragment (NTF) undergoes intramembrane proteolysis mediated by SPPL2a or SPPL2b. This cleavage generates the Bri2 ICD, which is liberated into the cytosol and the secreted Bri2 C domain. Cell Culture, cDNAs, and Transfection—HEK293EBNA, HEK293TR, and SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Glutamax (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). SNKBE cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium (Cambrex Bio Science, Verviers, Belgium) supplemented with 2.5% non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal calf serum. A-431 cells were cultured in Advanced RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin and 10% fetal calf serum. Using PCR, a C-terminal HA tag (AYPYDVPDYA) was added to all constructs. SPPL2a, SPPL2a D412A, SPPL2b, SPPL2b D421A, and SPPL3 D272A were subcloned into the NheI and NotI or EcoRI and XhoI sites of pcDNA 3.1. Zeo- (Invitrogen) and stably transfected into HEK293EBNA cells. SPP, SPP D265A, and SPPL3 were subcloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pcDNA 4/TO A (Invitrogen) and stably transfected into HEK293 TR cells (Invitrogen). Transfection of cells was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and single cell clones were generated by selection in 200 μg/ml zeocine (Invitrogen). To induce expression of SPP, SPP D265A, and SPPL3, cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml doxycycline (BD Biosciences) added to the cell culture medium for at least 48 h. Bri2 cDNA was purchased from RZPD (Deutsches Ressourcezentrum für Genomforschung, Berlin, Germany). After the starting methionine an N-terminal FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) and, at the C terminus of the protein, a V5 tag (GKPIPNPLLGLDST) were added, and the PCR product was subcloned into the HindIII and XbaI sites of pcDNA6.0-V5-His A (Invitrogen). The Bri2ΔE and the Bri2ΔFC constructs were generated by deleting the C-terminal part of the protein after amino acids 94 and 240, respectively. The Bri2 KR 243/244 AA (KR/AA) construct was generated by PCR mutagenesis. These Bri2 constructs also contain an N-terminal FLAG tag and a C-terminal V5 tag and were subcloned into the HindIII and XbaI sites of pcDNA6.0-V5-His A (Invitrogen). All cDNA constructs were sequenced for verification. Bri2 cDNAs were either transiently or stably expressed in cell lines stably expressing SPPs or SPPLs as described above. Antibodies, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—The anti-HA peroxidase-coupled 3F10 antibody was obtained from Roche Diagnostics. The monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 and the polyclonal HA 6908 antibody were obtained from Sigma. Polyclonal and monoclonal V5 antibodies were purchased from Chemicon (Schwalbach, Germany) and Invitrogen, respectively. The polyclonal antibodies against ADAM10, Calnexin, and ADAM17 (TACE) were purchased from Calbiochem, Stressgene/Biomol (Hamburg, Germany), and Oncogene, respectively. The polyclonal anti-Bri2 antibody (ITM2b ab14307) directed against the first 60 amino acids of human Bri2 was obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). The monoclonal SPPL2b-specific antibody CADG-3F9 directed against amino acids 518-535 of the protein was established by Dr. Elisabeth Kremmer (GSF-Forschungszentrum, Munich). Anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, and anti-chicken peroxidase secondary antibodies were purchased from Promega (Madison). Immunoprecipitation assays, gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting experiments, and co-immunoprecipitation assays were carried out as described previously (26Krawitz P. Haffner C. Fluhrer R. Steiner H.

To block specific metalloprotease activities, cells were grown in a 6-well format and treated overnight with either 50 μm TAPI-1 (Peptides International) or 50 μm TAPI-2 (Peptides International). Hydroxamate-based inhibitors GW280264 (5 μm) and GI254023 (5 μm) are described elsewhere (39Hundhausen C. Misztela D. Berkhout T.A. Broadway N. Saftig P. Reiss K. Hartmann D. Fahrenholz F. Postina R.

For quantification, proteins were immunoblotted as described above and detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence technique (GE Healthcare). The chemiluminescence signals of at least three independent experiments were measured with a CD camera-based imaging system (Alpha-Innotec, Kasendorf, Germany). Statistical significance was determined with Student's t test. Statistically significant p values of <0.05 or <0.005 are represented by or, respectively. RNA interference experiments were carried out as follows. 1 × 106 cells/well were plated in a polylysine-coated 6-well format. After a 2-h incubation, cells were transfected with the indicated small interfering RNA (siRNA) (Dharmacon siRNA SMARTpools: catalog numbers M-0040503-01 (ADAM10), M-003453-00 (ADAM17), and D-001206-13 (non-targeting control)), using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h after transfection, the medium was exchanged, and cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Five independent experiments were quantified as described above. BRICHOS and Bri2ΔFC levels were first normalized to the calnexin expression level, and then the ratio of BRICHOS to Bri2ΔFC was determined. Resulting data for control siRNA were set to 100%. Where indicated cells were treated overnight with 10 μg/ml brefeldin A (BFA; Sigma-Aldrich). As a control, cells were incubated with the respective carrier. Shedding of Bri2 by ADAM10—The Bri2 protein is a type II transmembrane protein, known to be processed within its ectodomain by furin and related proteases (Fig. 1A, proBri2) (32Kim S.H. Creemers J.W.

FASEB J. 2004; 18: 373-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Consequently, a membrane-bound fragment, containing the so-called BRICHOS domain, remains after this initial processing (Fig. 1A, Bri2). As expected, Bri2 containing the propeptide (pro-Bri2) was detected at a molecular mass of ∼50 kDa in all cell lines tested. The mature Bri2 variant lacking the propeptide (Bri2) was detected at a slightly lower molecular weight and was most prominently visible in cell lines of neuronal origin (Fig. 1B, SKNBE, SH-SY5Y). However, besides these expected Bri2 species, we additionally detected a lower molecular mass Bri2 NTF of ∼22 kDa in all cell lines investigated (Fig. 1B). We therefore assumed that Bri2 might undergo shedding because such a proteolytic processing step would result in the generation of a small membrane retained stub (Fig. 1A, NTF). If such a shedding event takes place, one would expect a secreted counterpart containing the BRICHOS domain (see Fig. 1A). To allow identification of such a secreted domain, we inserted a V5 tag directly at the C terminus of the BRICHOS domain generating Bri2ΔFC (Fig. 2A). Upon expression of this cDNA construct, we indeed detected the ∼25-kDa BRICHOS domain as a secreted species in the conditioned medium (Fig. 2B). Similar to cells expressing endogenous Bri2 (Fig. 1B), NTF was observed within the cell lysate (Fig. 2B). This suggests that the BRICHOS domain and the Bri2 NTF are generated by a novel shedding event of Bri2 and may explain the observation of a N-terminal Bri2 fragment of unknown origin by Choi et al. (40Choi S.I. Vidal R. Frangione B. Levy E. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 373-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In analogy to many γ-secretase substrates, which require shedding by proteases of the ADAM family, we investigated whether a member of this protease family is involved in shedding of Bri2. Broad ADAM protease inhibitors, such as TAPI-1 and TAPI-2 (41Arribas J. Coodly L. Vollmer P. Kishimoto T.K. Rose-John S. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11376-11382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), strongly reduced the secretion of the BRI-CHOS domain (Fig. 2C). The nature of the metalloprotease activity was narrowed down using two hydroxamate-based inhibitors that differ in their inhibitory profile. The inhibitor GW280264X has been shown to block ADAM17 and ADAM10, whereas the compound GI254023X preferentially blocks ADAM10 (39Hundhausen C. Misztela D. Berkhout T.A. Broadway N. Saftig P.

https://openalex.org/W2006334642,"Understanding the signalling pathways that initiate organ development is of fundamental importance to human medicine. A mechanism that turns on the expression of the genes necessary to make the eye via the purinergic signalling has now been identified. A conserved network of eye field transcription factors (EFTFs) underlies the development of the eye in vertebrates and invertebrates1. To direct eye development, Pax6, a key gene in this network2,3, interacts with genes encoding other EFTFs such as Rx1 and Six3 (refs 4–6). However, the mechanisms that control expression of the EFTFs remain unclear7. Here we show that purine-mediated signalling triggers both EFTF expression and eye development in Xenopus laevis. Overexpression of ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 2 (E-NTPDase2)8, an ectoenzyme that converts ATP to ADP9, caused ectopic eye-like structures, with occasional complete duplication of the eye, and increased expression of Pax6, Rx1 and Six3. In contrast, downregulation of endogenous E-NTPDase2 decreased Rx1 and Pax6 expression. E-NTPDase2 therefore acts upstream of these EFTFs. To test whether ADP (the product of E-NTPDase2) might act to trigger eye development through P2Y1 receptors, selective in Xenopus for ADP10,11, we simultaneously knocked down expression of the genes encoding E-NTPDase2 and the P2Y1 receptor. This could prevent the expression of Rx1 and Pax6 and eye formation completely. We next measured ATP release12,13,14 in the presumptive eye field, demonstrating a transient release of ATP at a time that could plausibly trigger (once converted to ADP) expression of the EFTFs. This surprising role for transient purine-mediated signalling in eye development may be widely conserved, because alterations to the locus of E-NTPDase2 on human chromosome 9 cause severe head and eye defects, including microphthalmia15,16,17,18. Our results suggest a new mechanism for the initiation of eye development."

The TRPML3(A419P) mutation causes a severe form, whereas the TRPML3(I362T/A419P) mutation results in a mild form of the varitint-waddler phenotype.

Cell Calcium. 2005; 38: 233-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The TRPML subfamily consists of three members. Mutations in TRPML1 cause the lysosomal storage disease mucolipidosis type IV (2Bargal R. Avidan N. Ben-Asher E. Olender Z. Zeigler M. Frumkin A. Raas-Rothschild A. Glusman G. Lancet D. Bach G. Nat.

The A419P mutations in the α-helical fifth transmembrane domain of TRPML3 cause the varitint-waddler phenotype, which is characterized by pigmentation defect, hearing loss, circling behavior, and embryonic lethality (4Di Palma F.

We report here that TRPML3 functions as an inward rectifying cation channel that is inactivated by extracytosolic cations. The A419P mutation locks the channel in an open state and eliminates regulation of the channel by extracytosolic cations. The I362T mutation inhibits channel activity and reduces the surface expression and current density of the A419P mutant. We conclude that the varitint-waddler phenotype is the result of a gain-of-function mutation in TRPML3. Plasmid Construction, Mutagenesis, and Reagents—Human TRPML3 was amplified from human placenta and cloned into the pEGFPC1 and p3XFLAG-CMV-7.1 vectors. Mutations were introduced with the QuikChange kit. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Western Blotting—HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 and used 24–48 h post-transfection. Cell extracts were prepared by sonication in homogenization buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and one protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science). Microsomal pellets were extracted with 1% Triton X-100, treated with PNGase F 2The abbreviations used are:PNGase Fpeptide:N-glycosidase FEndo Hendoglycosidase HGFPgreen fluorescent proteinPBSphosphate-buffered salineBAPTA1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acidNMDGN-methyl-d-glucamineERendoplasmic reticulumEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinWTwild-type. or Endo H, and immunoblotted with anti-GFP antibodies. peptide:N-glycosidase F endoglycosidase H green fluorescent protein phosphate-buffered saline 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid N-methyl-d-glucamine endoplasmic reticulum enhanced green fluorescent protein wild-type Surface Biotinylation Assay—Cells were washed with PBS and incubated in 1 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(biotinamido)hexanoate in PBS for 30 min on ice, and free biotin was quenched with 100 mm glycine in PBS. The cells were washed with PBS, and lysates were prepared as described above. The lysates were cleared by centrifuged; protein was equalized; and 12.5% avidin beads were added. After a 2-h incubation at 4 °C, the beads were collected and washed three times with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, and the proteins were Western-blotted with anti-FLAG antibodies. Current Recordings—The whole cell current was recorded at room temperature with an Axopatch 200B amplifier and filtered at 5 kHz. Data were acquired with pCLAMP 9.0 and Digidata 1322. Currents were measured by application of 400-ms ramps from –100 to +100 mV every 5 s from a holding potential of 0 mV or by holding the membrane potential at –100 mV. Results were analyzed with pCLAMP 9.0 and Origin software. The pipette solution contained 140 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 1.13 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MgATP, and 10 mm BAPTA or 10 mm EGTA (pH 7.3) with KOH. When required, KCl was replaced with NaCl or NMDG-Cl. The bath solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) with NaOH. The Na+-free solution contained 140 mm NMDG-Cl, 0.2 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) with HCl. TRPML3 Is an Inward Rectifying Cation Channel Regulated by Extracellular Ions—The predicted structure of TRPML3 and its putative N-glycosylation sites are shown in Fig. 1a. Native TRPML3 is localized in intracellular vesicles and in the plasma membrane of hair cells (4Di Palma F. Belyantseva I.A. Kim H.J. Vogt T.F. Kachar B. Noben-Trauth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14994-14999Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, a recent study reported that TRPML3 tagged at its C terminus with yellow fluorescent protein is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (6Venkatachalam K. Hofmann T. Montell C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17517-17527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This may be because TRPML channels have targeting motifs in their C termini (7Song Y. Dayalu R. Matthews S.A. Scharenberg A.M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 85: 1253-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tagged TRPML3 at its N terminus with EGFP. Biotinylation assay showed that EGFP-TRPML3 was targeted to the plasma membrane and thus was used in all experiments reported below. The current was recorded either by ramps or by holding the membrane potential at –100 mV (see “Experimental Procedures”). Notably, Fig. 1b shows that TRPML3 is not active before exposing the extracytosolic face of the channel to Na+-free solution. However, when the cells were briefly incubated in Na+-free bath solution and then Na+ was re-added, a large, strongly inward rectifying current was observed (Fig. 1b). The current then slowly inactivated. It was necessary to incubate the cells in Na+-free medium because preincubation with 20 mm external Na+ (Na+o) was not sufficient to activate the channel (data not shown). Fig. 1c shows the I/V relationship of TRPML3. Fig. 1d shows that inhibition by cations and channel inactivation are specific to extracytosolic cations. Thus, replacing pipette K+ with NMGD+ did not activate the current, did not overcome the need to expose the cells to Na+-free solution, and did not prevent the spontaneous channel inactivation. Finally, Fig. 1e shows that after each inactivation, the current can be fully reactivated by re-exposing the cells to Na+-free medium. Although the rate and extent of spontaneous current inactivation were somewhat variable, Fig. 1 shows that TRPML3 channel activity is specifically inhibited by extracytosolic Na+. TRPML3(A419P) Is Locked in an Open Unregulated State—To understand how the A419P mutation leads to the varitint-waddler phenotype, we analyzed the function and expression of TRPML3(A419P). Fig. 2 (a–c) shows that TRPML3(A419P) is constitutively active and lost the regulation by Na+o. Thus, the TRPML3(A419P) current is observed without preincubation in Na+-free medium; incubation in Na+-free medium does not increase channel activity; and the current does spontaneously inactivate. The same behavior was observed by recording the TRPML3(A419P) current at a holding potential of –100 mV. Fig. 2c shows that no current is observed in cells expressing TRPML3 upon clamping the membrane potential at –100 mV. A large current developed only after preincubation in Na+-free solution, and the current then spontaneously inactivate. By contrast, with TRPML3(A419P), holding the membrane potential at –100 mV resulted in a large current that did not inactivate. Notably, the I/V relationship in Fig. 2b shows that the A419P mutation does not alter channel properties. Proline introduces a kink or a break in α-helical transmembrane domains because its amide cannot form hydrogen bonds and because its side chain interferes with helix formation (8Samatey F.A. Xu C. Popot J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4577-4581Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The A419P mutation may therefore lock TRPML3 in an open state by destabilizing its α-helical fifth transmembrane domain, preventing the channel from closing. Alternatively, the A419P mutation may prevent channel inactivation by extracytosolic ions, resulting in a spontaneously active channel. To test the effect of α-helix destabilization, we tested whether mutating Ala419 to Gly can reproduce the effect of the A419P mutation. We also tested the effect of mutating Ala419 to Val, which only weakly disrupts α-helices (9Aurora R. Creamer T.P. Srinivasan R. Rose G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1413-1416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). TRPML3(A419V) retains only ∼20% spontaneous activity and was activated by preincubation in Na+-free solution (data not shown). On the other hand, to the extent tested here, the channel properties of TRPML3(A419G) are the same as those of TRPML3(A419P). Fig. 2 (d–f) shows that TRPML3(A419G) is spontaneously active, that incubation in Na+-free medium does not further increase channel activity, and that the TRPML3(A419G) current shows minimal inactivation. The results in Fig. 2 suggest that destabilization of the fifth transmembrane domain of TRPML3 locks the channel in an open state. This can occur by two independent mechanisms. Disruption of the α-helical structure may prevent the conformational change that switches the channel between the open and close states. Alternatively, the fifth transmembrane domain may communicate with the regulatory extracytosolic site that inactivates the channel in the presence of Na+o. Destabilization of the fifth transmembrane domain may disrupt this communication, preventing channel inactivation. Future studies to determining the mechanism by which extracytosolic ions regulate TRPML3 activity should help distinguish between the two mechanisms. Nevertheless, the findings in Fig. 2 indicate that the varitint-waddler phenotype is due to a gain-of-function mutation in TRPML3. These findings also explain why the heterozygous wild-type (WT)/A419P mouse displays the varitint-waddler phenotype. The constitutively active channel is likely to disrupt a key cellular function(s) that results in disruption of multiple cellular activities because homozygous A419P/A419P results in embryonic lethality. TRPML3(I362T) Is Not Active, but TRPML3(I362T/A419P) Is Locked in an Open Unregulated State—The presence of the A419P and I362T mutations in the same allele results in a milder varitint-waddler phenotype (5Atiba-Davies M. Noben-Trauth K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1772: 1028-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In an attempt to understand this phenotype, we analyzed the function of TRPML3(I362T) and TRPML3(I362T/A419P). Fig. 3a shows that TRPML3(I362T) is not active and cannot be activated by incubation in Na+-free solution. Yet, surprisingly, Fig. 3 (b and c) shows that TRPML3(I362T/A419P) is active and that the channel properties of TRPML3(I362T/A419P) are similar to those of TRPML3(A419P). However, Fig. 3d shows that the current density of TRPML3(I362T/A419P) is significantly lower than that of TRPML3(A419P). The biotinylation assay in Fig. 3f shows that although the I362T mutation alone had no effect on the surface expression of TRPML3, it reduced the surface expression of TRPML3(I362T/A419P) relative to that of TRPML3(A419P), which can explain the reduced current density of TRPML3(I362T/A419P) and the milder varitint-waddler phenotype. The A419P Mutation Affects TRPML3 Glycosylation—TRPML3 is predicted to have two N-glycosylation sites, Asn138 and Asn205, at the large extracytosolic loop. Indeed, Fig. 3e shows that TRPML3 is highly glycosylated and that the A419P mutation alters channel glycosylation. These findings have several implications. First, it has been reported that when expressed alone, yellow fluorescent protein-tagged TRPML3 is retained in the ER (6Venkatachalam K. Hofmann T. Montell C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17517-17527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, analysis of TRPML3 glycosylation revealed that, as expected, PNGase F generated the non-glycosylated protein. Significantly, the majority of WT-TRPML3 was not sensitive to Endo H, indicating that TRPML3 must have exited the ER and was modified in the trans-Golgi. This is in agreement with the finding that native TRPML3 is expressed in vesicular compartments and the plasma membrane (4Di Palma F. Belyantseva I.A. Kim H.J. Vogt T.F. Kachar B. Noben-Trauth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14994-14999Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In the previous work, TRPML3 was tagged at its C terminus (6Venkatachalam K. Hofmann T. Montell C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17517-17527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), which contains important targeting sequences (7Song Y. Dayalu R. Matthews S.A. Scharenberg A.M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 85: 1253-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), likely resulting in mistargeting of TRPML3 to the ER. The A419P mutants migrated faster compared with WT-TRPML3 and to a position slightly above the Endo H-sensitive form of WT-TRPML3 (Fig. 3e, bounded by thin white lines). Treatment with PNGase F generated the non-glycosylated proteins. Treatment with Endo H showed that a portion of the A419P mutants are Endo H-resistant (bounded by thick white lines), indicating that at least a portion of these mutants exited the ER. This was further verified by a biotinylation assay, which showed that TRPML3 and the mutants trafficked to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3f). Despite the lower expression level of the mutants, the rate of success in recording TRPML3 current in cells that survived expression of the mutants was the same as that for WT-TRPML3. In the same set of experiments, current was observed in 11/15, 19/20, and 13/14 cells expressing WT-TRPML3, TRPML3(A419P), and TRPML3(I362T/A419P), respectively. These findings suggest that the A419P mutation modifies glycosylation of TRPML3, but it does not prevent its targeting to the plasma membrane and perhaps other organelles. The A419P Mutation Affects Cell Survival—A cellular effect of the A419P mutation became apparent when we noticed that expression of the A419P and I362T/A419P mutants resulted in massive cell death, which was manifested as a large number of floating cells in the culture. A more quantitative estimate of cell death was obtained by collecting all the cells from the culture (attached and floating) and blotting for expression of TRPML3 in the same amount of protein extract. The level of the A419P mutants was <10% that of WT-TRPML3 (data not shown). To reduce cell death, the cells were grown in medium containing 0.3 mm Ca2+. Fig. 3 (d and e) shows that even in reduced medium Ca2+, the expression of the A419P mutants was only ∼23 ± 5% that of WT-TRPML3. The massive cell killing is, of course, an exaggerated effect of the overexpression of the constitutively active A419P mutants. Nevertheless, a lower expression level of the native A419P mutants may kill the cells at a slower rate but should be toxic and kill all cells that express TRPML3. A preliminary reverse transcription-PCR survey showed that all tissues express TRPML3 mRNA and that high levels are found in epithelial tissues and the brain. It is possible that the higher expression of TRPML3 in the inner ear, keratinocytes, and the brain accounts for the higher susceptibility of these tissues to the A419P mutation. In summary, in this work, we have shown that the varitint-waddler phenotype is caused by the gain-of-function mutation TRPML3(A419P), which is toxic and kills cells. The milder phenotype of TRPML3(I362T/A419P) can be explained by the reduced surface expression and thus lower current density of this mutant. We thank Michael Dorwart for useful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2044309887,"Using high-resolution stacks of precursors to the seismic phase SS , we investigated seismic discontinuities associated with mineralogical phase changes approximately 410 and 660 kilometers (km) deep within Earth beneath South America and the surrounding oceans. Detailed maps of phase boundary topography revealed deep 410- and 660-km discontinuities in the down-dip direction of subduction, inconsistent with purely isochemical olivine phase transformation in response to lowered temperatures. Mechanisms invoking chemical heterogeneity within the mantle transition zone were explored to explain this feature. In some regions, multiple reflections from the discontinuities were detected, consistent with partial melt near 410-km depth and/or additional phase changes near 660-km depth. Thus, the origin of upper mantle heterogeneity has both chemical and thermal contributions and is associated with deeply rooted tectonic processes."

https://openalex.org/W1998962476,"Extracellular ATP has recently been identified as an important regulator of cell death in response to pathological insults. When SN4741 cells, which are dopaminergic neurons derived from the substantia nigra of transgenic mouse embryos, are exposed to ATP, cell death occurs. This cell death is associated with prominent cell swelling, loss of ER integrity, the formation of many large cytoplasmic vacuoles, and subsequent cytolysis and DNA release. In addition, the cleavage of caspase-3, a hallmark of apoptosis, is induced by ATP treatment. However, caspase inhibitors do not overcome ATP-induced cell death, indicating that both necrosis and apoptosis are associated with ATP-induced cell death and suggesting that a necrotic event might override the apoptotic process. In this study we also found that P2X7 receptors (P2X7Rs) are abundantly expressed in SN4741 cells, and both ATP-induced swelling and cell death are reversed by pretreatment with the P2X7Rs antagonist, KN62, or by knock-down of P2X7Rs with small interfering RNAs. Therefore, extracellular ATP release from injured tissues may act as an accelerating factor in necrotic SN4741 dopaminergic cell death via P2X7Rs.

West A.B. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 28: 57-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). The symptoms of PD only become apparent when more than 50% of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta are lost, which leads to an over 80% reduction in dopamine levels in the striatum (2Whitton P.S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 150: 963-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Epidemiological studies and pathological analyses demonstrate that sporadic PD with late onset occurs in 95% of patients, whereas the remaining 5% of PD cases are familial diseases with early onset (1Moore D.J. West A.B. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 28: 57-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 2Whitton P.S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 150: 963-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Although the etiological causes of PD have not been fully elucidated, several factors have been suggested as causes of neuronal degeneration. These include environmental toxins, genetic factors, and mitochondrial dysfunction as well as proteasomal impairment and oxidative stress (3Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Science. 2003; 302: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). Recently, however, there has been increasing recognition of the possible role of neuro-inflammation as a major factor in the pathogenesis of PD (4Morale M.C. Serra P.A. L'Episcopo F. Tirolo C. Caniglia S. Testa N. Gennuso F. Giaquinta G. Rocchitta G. Desole M.S. Miele E. Marchetti B. Neuroscience. 2006; 138: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The inflammatory component is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. It is now generally accepted that high levels of extracellular ATP may be released under pathological conditions such as inflammation, trauma, and stress. The role of extracellular ATP and purinergic receptors in neurodegeneration is one of the focus areas of cell death research (5Le Feuvre R. Brough D. Rothwell N. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 447: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).P2X7 receptors (P2X7Rs) are unusual purinergic receptors in that they can exist in two functional states: either as cation-selective channels or as nonselective pores (6Di Virgilio F. Chiozzi P. Ferrari D. Falzoni S. Sanz J.M. Morelli A. Torboli M. Bolognesi G. Baricordi O.R. Blood. 2001; 97: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). The permeability transition of P2X7Rs from channel to pore occurs either upon sustained stimulation with high ATP concentrations or repeated pulses of ATP application (7Liang L. Schwiebert E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C240-C242Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Seven members of the P2X receptor family have been cloned that share the same predicted structure with two transmembrane-spanning domains. These are an extracellular loop and the intracellular N- and C-terminal tails. Unlike other P2X receptor subtypes, P2X7R has an unusually long C-terminal domain that is responsible for the pore-forming property of P2X7Rs (8Adriouch S. Dox C. Welge V. Seman M. Koch-Nolte F. Haag F. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4108-4112Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 9Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar). In addition, P2X7R does not hetero-oligomerize with other members of the P2X family but functions only in the homo-oligomeric form (10Torres G.E. Egan T.M. Voigt M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6653-6659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), most likely as a homotrimer.Activation of this receptor also has dramatic cytotoxic properties that together with its ability to regulate cytokine production and release suggests that it can act as an important regulator of cell death in response to pathological insults (11Inoue K. Glia. 2002; 40: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In most cells that express P2X7Rs, sustained stimulation with ATP leads to membrane blebbing and programmed cell death. However, recent studies have shown that activation of P2X7Rs is involved in necrotic cell death as well as apoptosis. In murine thymocytes, ATP-mediated P2X7Rs activation leads to death via both caspase-dependent apoptosis and necrosis/lysis, even though necrotic cell death is predominant (12Le Stunff H. Auger R. Kanellopoulos J. Raymond M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16918-16926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In microglial N13 cells, inhibitors of caspases specifically suppress DNA fragmentation and other morphological signs of apoptotic damage. In contrast, cytoplasmic vacuolization and cell lysis remain unaffected, and cell death proceeds regardless of caspase activation (13Ferrari D. Los M. Bauer M.K. Vandenabeele P. Wesselborg S. Schulze-Osthoff K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Necrotic cell death is usually accompanied by cell swelling, termed necrotic volume increase, whereas cell shrinkage is a major hallmark of apoptosis (14Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6697) Google Scholar, 15Maeno E. Ishizaki Y. Kanaseki T. Hazama A. Okada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9487-9492Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). The acute excitotoxicity is thought to be mediated by excess depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane. This results in an osmotic imbalance caused by an influx of Na+, Cl–, and water, leading to cell lysis (16Okada Y. Maeno E. Shimizu T. Dezaki K. Wang J. Morishima S. J. Physiol. 2001; 532: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar).Recent studies have shown that P2X7Rs are expressed in the mossy fibers of the CA3 area of the hippocampus (17Armstrong J.N. Brust T.B. Lewis R.G. MacVicar B.A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5938-5945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as in cultured astrocytes, Schwann cells (18Duan S. Anderson C.M. Keung E.C. Chen Y. Chen Y. Swanson R.A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1320-1328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), spinal cord neurons (19Deuchars S.A. Atkinson L. Brooke R.E. Musa H. Milligan C.J. Batten T.F. Buckley N.J. Parson S.H. Deuchars J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7143-7152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and immune cells or microglia. Depending on the cell type, various physiological functions have been attributed to P2X7Rs, most notably, activation of caspase-1 (20Colomar A. Marty V. Medina C. Combe C. Parnet P. Amedee T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30732-30740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), rapid release of mature interleukin-1β from macrophages (21Virginio C. MacKenzie A. North R.A. Surprenant A. J. Physiol. 1999; 519: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), shedding of membrane molecules such as l-selectin and CD23 (22Gu B. Bendall L.J. Wiley J.S. Blood. 1998; 92: 946-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), synaptic transmission in the hippocampus (19Deuchars S.A. Atkinson L. Brooke R.E. Musa H. Milligan C.J. Batten T.F. Buckley N.J. Parson S.H. Deuchars J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7143-7152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and programmed cell death in injured spinal cords (23Wang X. Arcuino G. Takano T. Lin J. Peng W.G. Wan P. Li P. Xu Q. Liu Q.S. Goldman S.A. Nedergaard M. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 821-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). However, the expression of P2X7Rs and their functional role in the dopaminergic neurons, which are selectively degenerated in PD, has remained unexplored. In this study, we report that extracellular ATP induces cell death through P2X7Rs in SN4741 cells, which are derived from substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons of transgenic mouse embryos (24Son J.H. Chun H.S. Joh T.H. Cho S. Conti B. Lee J.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ATP-induced cell death has similar responses to necrosis rather than apoptosis in SN4741 neurons. Thus, P2X7Rs may be involved in degeneration of substantia nigra dopaminergic neuron according to the progression of Parkinson disease through an association with necrotic volume increase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSN4741 Dopaminergic Cell Culture—SN4741, a mouse embryonic substantia nigra-derived cell line, was grown at 33 °C in a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's high glucose medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated calf serum (Hyclone; Logan, UT) and 1% (v/v) antibiotics (Invitrogen). The medium was changed every 2 days, and the cells were subcultured approximately twice a week.Calcium Measurements—Intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was determined using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, fura-2, as previously reported (25Lee H. Jun D.J. Suh B.C. Choi B.H. Lee J.H. Do M.S. Suh B.S. Ha H. Kim K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28556-28563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, SN4741 cells were incubated with 3 μm (final concentration) fura-2 pentaacetoxymethyl ester (fura-2/AM) in complete medium at 37 °C with stirring for 50 min. After incubation, the cells were pelleted and washed twice with Locke's solution (154 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 5.0 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4) to remove the extracellular dye. To prevent dye leakage, sulfinpyrazone (final concentration, 250 nm) was then added to both the loading medium and the washing solution, as previously described (26Di Virgilio F. Fasolato C. Steinberg T.H. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Fluorescence ratios were taken by dual excitation at 340 and 380 nm, and the emission was measured at 500 nm with an alternative wavelength time scanning method. Calibration of the fluorescence signal, in terms of [Ca2+]i, was performed according to Grynkiewicz et al. (27Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).Confocal Microscopy—To record fluorescence images, adipocytes cultured on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips were pre-loaded with 5 μm Fluo-4/AM dye. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the cells were washed two times in Locke's solution to remove excess dye and examined under the confocal microscope. Measurement of intracellular calcium was performed with the Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 confocal microscope equipped with a 40× objective and a 0.75 numerical aperture. The calcium-sensitive Fluo-4 dye was excited by the 488-nm line from an argon laser, and the emission fluorescence was monitored at 515 ± 15 nm and selected by a band pass filter. During the collection of fluorescence data, each scan of a 512 × 512-pixel image took 0.35 s, and the interval between each image scan was ∼2 s. The images were stored and processed using laser pix software. The regions of interest, distributed across the image, provided an intensity versus time graphic output.FACS Analysis—Following treatment of SN4741 cells with ATP for the indicated time, apoptotic cells and necrotic cells were analyzed by staining the cells with annexin V and propidium iodide (PI), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (BD Pharmingen apoptosis kit, San Diego, CA). Briefly, an aliquot of 105 cells was incubated with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and PI for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. The cells were immediately analyzed by FACScalibur (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany). The emission/excitation wavelengths were 530/488 nm for Annexin V FITC (FL1) and 650 nm/488 nm for PI (FL2), according to the manufacturer's specifications of wavelength combinations. The necrotic cells were annexin V- and PI-positive, whereas apoptotic cells were annexin V-positive and PI-negative. The percentage of cells stained in each quadrant was quantified using the CellQuest software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Cell volume changes were also measured using a FACScalibur flow cytometer, and CellQuest software was used for data analysis (28Zholos A. Beck B. Sydorenko V. Lemonnier L. Bordat P. Prevarskaya N. Skryma R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The light scatter channels were set on linear gains. The cells in suspension, in Locke's solutions, were gated for forward angle scatters, and 20,000 particles of each gated population were analyzed. The cells were passed in single file through a laser beam by continuous flow of a fine stream of the suspension. Each cell scatters laser light, and the cytometer can simultaneously measure several typical parameters for each cell. These include flow angle and forward scatter intensity, which is proportional to the cell diameter.RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from SN4741 cells by TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH). One microgram of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). cDNA was amplified with 20 pmol of specific oligonucleotide primers (Bioneer) using Ex Taq polymerase (TaKaRa). The PCR products were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel and by sequencing. Nucleotide sequence analysis confirmed that the amplified DNA product from SN4741 cells was authentic mouse P2X7Rs.RNA Interference—siRNA duplexes targeting P2X7R (5′-GCAGGUGUGUUCCAUAUGA-3′ and 5′-UCACCGUACUCAUCAAGAG-3′) were purchased from Dharmacon. Transfection with siRNA pools was performed by electroporation, and down-regulation of P2X7R was confirmed by Western blot analysis.Western Blot—Immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (25Lee H. Jun D.J. Suh B.C. Choi B.H. Lee J.H. Do M.S. Suh B.S. Ha H. Kim K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28556-28563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). SN4741 cells were plated on 60-mm tissue culture dishes and transfected with siRNA targeting P2X7R as indicated. After transfection, the cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with lysis buffer (250 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.5, 2% SDS, 4% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol). Equivalent amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. The signals were detected with an ECL detection system (Neuronex Co.). The estimated size was 70 kDa in SN4741 cells, which is the appropriate molecular mass of the P2X7R subtype.MTT Viability—Cell viability was assessed by measuring the ability of cells to metabolize MTT. The cells were seeded onto 96-well plates at a density of ∼2 × 104 cells/well in growth medium and cultured to ∼60–70% confluency prior to the initiation of experimental treatment. Following the treatments as indicated, 15 μl of MTT solution (5 mg/ml) was added to each well, and the cells were maintained for 1 h at 37°C. 100 μlof solubilizing solution (50% dimethylformamide and 20% SDS, pH 4.8) was then added. After an overnight incubation at room temperature, absorbance was measured at 570 nm.Measurement of Intracellular Na+ Levels—The level of intracellular Na+ was determined as previously described using the SBFI/AM fluorescence sodium indicator (29Minta A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19449-19457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were harvested and incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 15 μm SBFI/AM, 0.2% pluronic acid, and 250 μm sulfinpyrazone at 37 °C for 90 min under continuous stirring. The cells were then washed with serum-free RPMI 1640 solution containing 250 μm sulfinpyrazone. Before measurement, a small aliquot of the cells (1 × 106 cells) was withdrawn, centrifuged, and resuspended in Locke's solution. In these experiments, the increase in cytosolic Na+ was measured as an increase in the fluorescence ratio determined at the dual excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm and the emission wavelength of 520 nm at 37 °C. The results are expressed as fluorescence ratios.Electron Microscopy—SN4741 cells were stimulated and grown on Vitrogen collagen matrix (Cohesion, Palo Alto, CA). As we described previously (30Park Y.S. Jun D.J. Hur E.M. Lee S.K. Suh B.S. Kim K.T. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 1349-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), these cells were rinsed two times with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde in 50 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were subsequently postfixed with 0.5% osmium tetroxide in 0.05 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were further dehydrated in graded ethanol solutions and embedded in LR White resin (London Resin Co., Berkshire, UK). The resin was cured at 60 °C for 24 h. Silver-gold thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The thin sections were examined under a JEOL 1200 EX2 transmission electron microscope at 80 kV (30Park Y.S. Jun D.J. Hur E.M. Lee S.K. Suh B.S. Kim K.T. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 1349-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).Whole Cell Recordings—Whole cell recordings were made from coronal sections (250-μm thickness) containing the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta and performed using an axopatch 200A instrument (Axon Instruments). The slices were perfused (2 ml/min) with extracellular solution containing 130 mm NaCl, 24 mm NaHCO3, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose saturated with 95% O2, 5%CO2, pH 7.4: ATP, BzATP, and KN62 were added to the extracellular solution. The neurons were visually identified within 80-μm slices using infrared-differential interference contrast video microcopy (Leica), in a voltage clamp mode, at a holding potential of –60 mV. Recording electrodes (3–7 MΩ), pulled from borosilicate glass (World Precision Instruments (WPI, Inc), were filled with 150 mm cesium gluconate, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 3 mm MgCl2, adjusted to pH 7.2 with the addition of CsOH. All of the experiments were performed at room temperature (18–22 °C). Axon DigiData 1332A and pClamp 9.2 software (Axon Instruments) were used to acquire the data and for analysis.Statistics—For statistical analysis, the paired Student's t test was used, and p values of less than 0.05 were regarded as significantly different.RESULTSATP-induced Volume Increase in SN4741 Cells—ATP-induced volume changes in SN4741 cells were assessed by flow cytometry. When SN4741 cells were exposed to millimolar concentrations of ATP, dramatic increases in cell volume were detected within 20 min in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A and B). Under normal physiological conditions, extracellular ATP acts on P2 purinergic receptors in the plasma membrane. However, many cells express ecto-ATPases and CD39 (ecto-ATP diphosphohydrolase), which rapidly hydrolyze ATP into AMP on their plasma membranes. The AMP is subsequently hydrolyzed by 5-nucleotidase to generate adenosines, which acts as ligand for P1 purinergic receptors (6Di Virgilio F. Chiozzi P. Ferrari D. Falzoni S. Sanz J.M. Morelli A. Torboli M. Bolognesi G. Baricordi O.R. Blood. 2001; 97: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). To test whether the ATP-induced volume increase is related to this metabolic conversion of ATP, the changes in cell volume were checked in the presence of the ecto-ATPase inhibitor ARL67156, the 5-nucleotidase inhibitor AMP-CP, and CD39, which metabolizes ATP and ADP to AMP (31Marcus A.J. Broekman M.J. Drosopoulos J.H. Islam N. Pinsky D.J. Sesti C. Levi R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 305: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This experiment showed that ATP-induced cell swelling was completely blocked by pretreatment with CD39, but it was unaffected by AMP-CP and ARL67156 (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, the cell swelling was immediately reversed after the addition of CD39 (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that cell swelling in SN4741 cells as a direct result of ATP and not of its metabolic intermediates such as ADP, AMP, and adenosine.ATP-induced Necrotic Cell Death of SN4741 Cells—Because the dramatic volume increase by ATP stimulation may lead to cell death, we tested cell viability after ATP stimulation using MTT assays. ATP treatment for 12 h resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease in the viability of SN4741 cells, whereas treatment with UTP did not trigger the cell death (Fig. 2A). In addition, the changes in nuclear morphology were observed using Hoechst staining, which is used to identify apoptotic nuclei by the appearance of blue-colored apoptotic bodies present as peripherally clumped or fragmented chromatin in cells (32Namgung U. Xia Z. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6442-6451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, the Hoechst staining results exhibited cytolysis and subsequent DNA release from nucleus into cytosol rather than apoptotic bodies (Fig. 2B). These morphological changes were visible at concentrations as high as 3 mm ATP in SN4741 cells. ATP stimulation also induced the cleavage of caspase-3, a hallmark of apoptosis, by ATP stimulation (Fig. 2C). However, caspase inhibitors, such as zVAD and DEVD, did not block the ATP-induced cell death (Fig. 2D). These results imply that ATP-induced cell death in SN4741 cells was associated with both necrosis and apoptosis, but necrotic events overrode apoptotic events. For precise differentiation between cells undergoing necrosis or apoptosis in the ATP-mediated cell death, the staining pattern of the cells were analyzed with PI and fluorochrome-conjugated annexin V by flow cytometry. Because cell undergoing apoptosis expose phosphatidylserine on their outer plasma membrane in the early processes and lose membrane integrity in the late processes, apoptotic cells are stained with annexin V-FITC, but not with PI. In contrast, because cells undergoing necrosis exhibit both phosphatidylserine exposure and loss of membrane integrity simultaneously, necrotic cells are stained with both PI and annexin V-FITC (4Morale M.C. Serra P.A. L'Episcopo F. Tirolo C. Caniglia S. Testa N. Gennuso F. Giaquinta G. Rocchitta G. Desole M.S. Miele E. Marchetti B. Neuroscience. 2006; 138: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In this experiment, SN4741 cells stimulated with ATP were stained simultaneously with both annexin V-FITC and PI (Fig. 2E), whereas SN4741 cells stimulated with the NO donor sodium nitroprusside as an apoptosis-inducing reagent initially showed phosphatidylserine exposure and, ultimately, PI staining, is quite a different pattern compared with ATP-treated cells. Morphological characteristics visible at the electron microscope level have been accepted as reliable criteria to differentiate between necrosis and apoptosis, because necrosis results in early cell swelling, dilation of the Golgi apparatus and of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and loss of plasma membrane integrity (33Zeng Y.S. Xu Z.C. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 37: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In our study, electron microscopy also provided a clear indication that necrosis had taken place. SN4741 cells displayed dramatic morphological changes accompanied by loss of ER integrity and formation of many large cytoplasmic vacuoles 8 h after ATP stimulation (Fig. 2, F–H). Taken together, these findings show that ATP-induced cell death is accompanied by cell swelling and suggests that cells are dying mainly by necrosis rather than apoptosis.FIGURE 2Extracellular ATP induced necrosis in SN4741 dopaminergic neurons. Concentration-dependent response of ATP-induced cell death in SN4741 cells is shown. The cells were exposed to the indicated concentrations of ATP or UTP for 12 h. A, the viability of the cells was determined by the MTT reduction assay and is expressed as a percentage of untreated control cells. Each point represents the mean ± S.D. of triplicates. B, the cells were fixed and stained with Hoechst dye 33342 (1 μg/ml), and nuclei were visualized by fluorescence microscopy (magnification, 400×). The cells with condensed nuclei were counted and are expressed as a percentage of untreated control cells. The photographs are representative of three experiments. Time course of ATP-induced cell death in SN4741 is shown. The cells were exposed to 3 mm ATP for the indicated periods of time. C, cells were harvested, lysed, and used for Western blot analysis with anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody. D, pretreatment with caspase inhibitors did not affect ATP-induced cell death. The cells were exposed to 3 mm ATP for the indicated periods of time in the presence or absence of the pan-caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk (50 μm), or the specific caspase-3 and caspase-7 inhibitor, DEVD-CHO (50 μm). Cell viability was assessed by the MTT reduction assay and is expressed as a percentage of untreated control cells. Each point represents the mean ± S.D. of triplicates. E, extracellular ATP-induced necrotic cell death in SN4741 cells. Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide staining of SN4741 cells was assessed by flow cytometry at indicated times after treatment. Sodium nitroprusside was used as a typical apoptosis-inducing reagent. Quadrants are defined as: live (lower left), apoptotic (lower right), and necrotic (upper left and right). The results are representative of three independent experiments. F, electron microscopic analysis of vehicle- and ATP-treated SN4741 cells. Typical morphological features of cells exposed to 3 mm ATP for 8 h were observed. Note the lack of ER integrity and the enhanced cytoplasmic swelling in ATP-treated cell. G and H, increases in both numbers and size of cytoplasmic vacuoles were observed in ATP-treated SN4741 cells. Scale bars, 2 μm. Con, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Functional Expression of P2X7Rs in SN4741 Cells—P2X7R activation was examined to determine whether it mediated ATP-induced cell swelling and subsequent cell death. To determine the expression of P2X7Rs, we performed Western blot and RT-PCR analyses with total proteins and RNAs from SN4741 cells, respectively. For comparison, a human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell line was also tested that is known not to express P2X7Rs (34Humphreys B.D. Virginio C. Surprenant A. Rice J. Dubyak G.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In these experiments, SN4741 cells, but not HEK cells, exhibited immunoreactivity with antibodies against P2X7Rs and produce P2X7R-specific DNA fragments with RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 3, A and B). To confirm the functionality of P2X7Rs, we monitored ion flows such as Ca2+ and N"
https://openalex.org/W2020903051,"Mott transitions, which are metal-insulator transitions (MITs) driven by electron-electron interactions, are usually accompanied in bulk by structural phase transitions. In the layered perovskite Ca(1.9)Sr(0.1)RuO4, such a first-order Mott MIT occurs in the bulk at a temperature of 154 kelvin on cooling. In contrast, at the surface, an unusual inherent Mott MIT is observed at 130 kelvin, also on cooling but without a simultaneous lattice distortion. The broken translational symmetry at the surface causes a compressional stress that results in a 150% increase in the buckling of the Ca/Sr-O surface plane as compared to the bulk. The Ca/Sr ions are pulled toward the bulk, which stabilizes a phase more amenable to a Mott insulator ground state than does the bulk structure and also energetically prohibits the structural transition that accompanies the bulk MIT."

Post-translational modifications of NMDARs, such as phosphorylation, alter both the activity and trafficking properties of NMDARs.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3931-3939Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation can also influence which proteins bind to the receptor. For example, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), and phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ) bind to NR2 subunits in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner (24Gurd J.W. Bissoon N. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 25Hisatsune C. Umemori H. Mishina M. Yamamoto T. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and the increased association of PI 3-kinase with phosphorylated NMDARs has been suggested to contribute to altered signaling in the hippocampus after ischemia (20Takagi N. Sasakawa K. Besshoh S. Miyake-Takagi K. Takeo S. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation plays an essential role in both the regulation of NMDAR channel activity and NMDAR-mediated downstream signaling cascades. In addition to phosphorylation, ubiquitination is another post-translational modification that plays an important role in regulating neuronal function. Ubiquitin is a 76-amino acid protein that covalently attaches to substrates in an ATP-dependent enzymatic reaction that requires the concerted efforts of E1, E2, and E3 ubiquitin ligases (26Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar). E3 ubiquitin ligases are the critical components that generate specificity in the reaction via substrate recognition. While many cellular processes are known to involve ubiquitination, its involvement in neuronal synaptic plasticity has only recently been investigated. Hippocampal LTP requires a balance of both protein synthesis and ubiquitin-dependent degradation (27Fonseca R. Vabulas R.M. Hartl F.U. Bonhoeffer T. Nagerl U.V. Neuron. 2006; 52: 239-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), and the stability of multiple proteins at the PSD is regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) (28Ehlers M.D. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 29Patrick G.N. Bingol B. Weld H.A. Schuman E.M. Curr.

Neuron. 2003; 40: 595-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Thus, both phosphorylation and ubiquitination are likely to be important regulators of NMDAR function. Here we report the identification of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mind bomb-2 (Mib2) as a novel NR2B subunit-interacting protein whose interaction with and ubiquitination of the NR2B subunit is enhanced in a Fyn phosphorylation-dependent manner. This leads to the down-regulation of NMDAR activity, suggesting a role for both phosphorylation and ubiquitination in NMDAR modulation. Antibodies and Reagents—Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal sera directed against a peptide sequence of mouse Mib2 (amino acids (aa) 429-443) was generated by New England Peptide (Gardner, MA) (Supplemental Fig. S1). Anti-Mib2 (mouse) antibodies were from Abnova (Taipei, Taiwan). Anti-NR2B (rabbit) antibodies were from Covance (Berkeley, CA). Anti-NR1 (mouse) and MAP2(a,b) and MAP2(a-c) (mouse) antibodies were from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Anti-hemagglutinin (HA, rat) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated digoxigenin antibodies were from Roche Applied Science (Indianapolis, IN), and anti-α-actinin (mouse) antibodies from Sigma. Anti-phosphotyrosine (mouse) and anti-Myc (mouse) antibodies were from Upstate (Lake Placid, NY) and anti-PSD-95 (mouse) antibodies were from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO). Anti-NR2B (goat), NR1 (goat), actin (goat), HA (mouse), Fyn (rabbit and mouse), normal IgG and all horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). Forskolin and MG-132 were purchased from Calbiochem, APV (2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid) was from Tocris (St. Louis, MO), and ketamine HCl was purchased from Henry Schein Inc (Palatine, IL). Construction of Yeast Plasmids—The sequence encoding the cytoplasmic tail of human NR2B (ctNR2B; aa 839-1482) was amplified from cDNA derived from L(-tk) cells expressing human NR1 and NR2B (Merck, Sharp and Dohme, Harlow, UK), and subcloned into the multiple cloning site I (MCS-I) of the pBridge yeast expression plasmid (Clontech, Mountain View). Full-length human Fyn cDNA was amplified from Marathon Race-Ready human brain cDNA (Clontech) and subcloned into pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI). This construct (Fyn WT) was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis of the tyrosine residue 531 to phenylalanine (Y531F), generating a constitutively active form of Fyn (FynCA). After verifying the point mutation by sequencing, FynCA was subcloned into the MCS-II of pBridge-ctNR2B. MCS-I of pBridge is under the control of a CMV promoter, whereas MCS-II is under the control of a conditional methionine promoter. Thus, ctNR2B is constitutively expressed from the pBridge-ctNR2B-FynCA construct, whereas FynCA expression is repressed in the presence of methionine in the growth media. Yeast Three-hybrid Screening—An adult rat brain cDNA library in pACT2 (Clontech; “prey”) was screened using the pBridge-ctNR2B-FynCA plasmid for constitutive expression of the cytoplasmic tail of NR2B as “bait” and inducible expression of FynCA as the third component in the screen. The pBridge-ctNR2B-FynCA construct and cDNA library were sequentially co-transformed into AH109 yeast (Clontech) using standard techniques (31Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). Selection was performed using minimal media plus/minus methionine and colonies that were β-galactosidase positive in the absence of methionine (FynCA expressed) but β-galactosidase negative in the presence of methionine (FynCA repressed) were identified. The β-galactosidase assay was repeated on restreaked positive clones to confirm the initial result. Plasmid DNA from positive yeast colonies was isolated and sequenced. Expression Constructs—Full-length human Mib2 cDNA (IMAGE clone 4341220) was purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and subcloned into phCMV2 vector (Gene Therapy Systems; San Diego, CA) such that the 110-kDa Mib2 protein was fused in-frame with the N-terminal HA epitope. Similar constructs were made to express regions containing the zinc finger domain (aa 1-180), the ankyrin repeats (aa 504-855), and the RING finger domains (aa 857-1000) of Mib2. Each construct was verified by Western blot analysis using HA antibodies to detect the fusion protein after transient transfection of the cDNAs into HEK293 cells. The following cDNAs were kind gifts: GFP-NR2B, Robert Wenthold (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD); NR2B and enhanced-GFP (eGFP), David Lovinger (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD); NR1-1a, Michael Hollman (Ruhr University, Bochum, Germany); Myc-ubiquitin, Jennifer Johnston (Elan, South San Francisco, CA); maltose-binding protein (MBP), MBP-NR1 and MBP-NR2B constructs, Vivian Teichberg (Weizman Institute, Rehovot, Israel). MBP-NR2B was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis of tyrosine residues 1252, 1336, and 1472 to aspartic acids (Y1252D, Y1336D, Y1472D), generating a phosphomimic mutant of NR2B that was verified by sequencing. Recombinant Proteins—MBP-tagged proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli, affinity-purified, and immobilized on amylose resin according to the manufacturer's protocol (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). In Vitro Translation—[35S]methionine-labeled Mib2 was generated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (TnT in vitro translation kit; Promega) using full-length Mib2 cDNA. In vitro translated products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. In Vitro Binding Assays—The assay was performed as previously described (32Thornton C. Tang K.C. Phamluong K. Luong K. Vagts A. Nikanjam D. Yaka R. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31357-31364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Results were visualized by autoradiography using the Typhoon PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified by NIH Image 1.61. Purity of the recombinant proteins was verified by Coomassie staining. Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were cultured on 10-cm plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and GIBCO™ MEM Non-Essential Amino Acids (Invitrogen). When cells reached 70% confluency, they were transiently transfected with cDNA constructs (up to 6 μg total) using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The media was changed 24 h after transfection, and cells harvested 48 h after transfection. For the preparation of primary hippocampal neurons, newborn rats (P0) were decapitated, and hippocampi were dissected bilaterally. Cells were dissociated by enzyme digestion with papain (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) followed by brief mechanical trituration and plated on 2-chamber CC2 glass chamber slides (Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL). Cells were plated (∼1 × 105 cells/chamber) and maintained in Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27, penicillin, streptomycin, and Glutamax-1 (all from Invitrogen), and maintained in culture for up to 21 days. Preparation of Cell Homogenates—HEK293 cells were harvested in PBS (1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 2.7 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl), spun at 2000 rpm for 2 min, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm EDTA, 320 mm sucrose, 1% deoxycholate), 1% SDS, and protease (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma) per the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were sonicated briefly, and lysis was allowed to proceed for 30 min on ice. Following protein concentration determination (using a BCA kit, per manufacturer's instructions; Pierce), samples were diluted to 2 mg/ml with lysis buffer before proceeding with immunoprecipitation assays. Rat hippocampal slices and homogenates were prepared as previously described (5Yaka R. He D.Y. Phamluong K. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9630-9638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation Assays—Immunoprecipitation was performed with 5 μg of the appropriate antibodies and 500 μg of cell homogenate as previously described (5Yaka R. He D.Y. Phamluong K. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9630-9638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked in milk solution (5% milk, PBS, 0.05% Tween-20) except for the detection of phosphorylated proteins when a bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution (5% BSA, 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.9% NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) was used. Membranes were incubated with the specific primary antibody, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunoreactivity was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence ECL (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) and processed using the Typhoon PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Results were quantified by NIH Image 1.61. Ubiquitination Assays—Cells were transiently transfected with cDNA constructs and were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (42 μm) 3 h prior to homogenization. Cell homogenates and immunoprecipitations were prepared as described above, except that 42 μm MG-132 and 5 mmN-ethylmaledimide (Sigma) were added to all buffers. In addition, samples were diluted in lysis buffer containing 2% SDS to dissociate protein-protein interactions. In Situ Hybridization—A fragment of the mouse Mib2 gene (aa 263-428) was generated by PCR using adult mouse brain cDNA (Clontech) as a template. The PCR product was subcloned into pGEM-T (Promega) and used as a template to generate sense and antisense digoxygenin-labeled riboprobes using the Digoxygenin RNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science), as per the manufacturer's instructions. This sequence contained no significant homology to other known cDNAs, as determined by BLAST analysis. Hybridization was performed on 16-20 μm-thick sagittal cryostat sections as previously described (33Ashique A.M. Kharazia V. Yaka R. Phamluong K. Peterson A.S. Ron D. Brain Res. 2006; 1069: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Digoxigenin antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase were used at a concentration of 1:2,000, and the detection of alkaline phosphatase was performed with NBT/BCIP substrate according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Immunocytochemistry—Rats were deeply anesthetized with an overdose of Euthasol® (Virbac, Forth Worth, TX) and perfused with 0.9% NaCl for 2 min, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min. Brains were removed, post-fixed in 4% PFA for 2 h, and sectioned (40 μm) using a vibratome. Free-floating sagittal sections were immunostained as previously described (33Ashique A.M. Kharazia V. Yaka R. Phamluong K. Peterson A.S. Ron D. Brain Res. 2006; 1069: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), using primary antibodies at the following concentrations: anti-Mib2 (rabbit; 1:500), anti-MAP2(a,b) (mouse; 1:500) and anti-NR1 (mouse; 1:500). Secondary antibodies were Cy3-labeled donkey anti-rabbit and FITC-labeled anti-mouse (1:250; Jackson ImmunoResearch, WestGrove, PA). Primary hippocampal neurons were fixed in 4% PFA, followed by incubation in 3% normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 h at room temperature. Fixed neurons were incubated (overnight, 4 °C) in primary antibodies against Mib2 (1:250), MAP(a-c) (1:250), PSD-95 (1:100), or α-actinin (1:500,000) diluted in PBS/0.1% Triton X-100. Alexa Fluor-594 labeled donkey anti-rabbit and Alexa Fluor-488 labeled donkey anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were incubated for 2 h at room temperature, followed by washing 3× in phosphate-buffered saline/0.1% Triton X-100 and coverslipped using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Images were acquired using the LSM 510 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Electrophysiology—HEK293 cells were transfected with cDNA constructs as described above, except that APV (500 μm) and ketamine (0.7 mm) were added to the media to prevent glutamate-induced excitatoxicity. 24 h after transfection, cells were reseeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells in 35-mm plates coated with 1% gelatin. 24-48 h after replating, one dish was transferred to the chamber of an upright microscope (BX50WI, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with epifluorescent optics. Cells were continuously perfused with external solution that contained (in mm): 145 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1.8 BaCl2, 15 HEPES, 10 glucose, 0.05 glycine, and 0.2 sodium orthovanadate (pH 7.3). When testing the effect of MG-132 (10 μm), we added it to the culture media 2-3 h before transferring cells to the recording chamber, and MG-132 (1 μm) was also present in the recording solution. Transfected cells were identified by the fluorescence of eGFP that was co-transfected with the cDNA constructs. NMDA was dissolved into external solution daily at a concentration of 1 mm. Fast switching to NMDA-containing external solution was achieved by piezoelectric control of the lateral movement of a three-barrel square glass application pipette (SF-77B, Warner Instrument, CT). NMDA-elicited currents were measured at -60 mV in the whole cell voltage-clamp mode using Multiclamp 700A (Molecular Device, Union City, CA), as described previously (34Bradley J. Carter S.R. Rao V.R. Wang J. Finkbeiner S. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Recording electrodes (2-3 MΩ) were filled with internal solution containing (in mm): 121 cesium methanesulfate, 10 CsCl, 15 HEPES, 0.6 EGTA, 4 MgATP, 0.3 NaGTP, and 7 Na2CrPO4 (pH 7.25) with an osmolarity of 275 mOsm. Whole cell currents were low-pass filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 2 kHz by Multicamp 700A software and pClamp 9 (Molecular Device, Union City, CA). Cell membrane capacitance was measured and compensated automatically. Series resistance was 50% compensated. Statistical Analysis—All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Electrophysiological results were analyzed by Student's t test. Biochemical results were analyzed using the one-sample t test or one-way analysis of variance, followed by post-hoc tests using Newman-Keuls method. Significance for all tests was set at p < 0.05. Mib2 Interacts with the NR2B Cytoplasmic Tail in a Fyn-dependent Manner in Yeast—Because tyrosine phosphorylation of the NMDAR is a critical mechanism regulating channel activity and signal transduction (7Salter M.W. Kalia L.V. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), we designed a screen to identify proteins that interact with the NMDAR in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner. This yeast three-hybrid screen (35Fuller K.J. Morse M.A. White J.H. Dowell S.J. Sims M.J. BioTechniques. 1998; 25 (90–82): 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) consisted of a bait plasmid containing the cytoplasmic tail of NR2B (ctNR2B), prey proteins expressed from a rat brain cDNA library, and a constitutively active form of Fyn (FynY531F; FynCA (36Harrison S.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar)) whose expression was under the control of a conditional methionine promoter. In the presence of methionine in the growth media, FynCA expression was repressed. In the absence of methionine, FynCA expression was induced, and tyrosine phosphorylation of ctNR2B was observed (data not shown). Approximately 5 × 105 independent transformant clones were screened in the absence and presence of methionine in the growth media. This resulted in the isolation of 32 colonies that were true three-hybrid interactants (i.e. interacted with ctNR2B only when FynCA was expressed; Fig. 1). Three of these colonies contained plasmids encoding the RING finger domain of Mib2, a protein that has previously been reported to have E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (37Koo B.K. Yoon K.J. Yoo K.W.

Because of the recently identified role of the UPS in activity-dependent regulation of excitatory synaptic proteins (28Ehlers M.D. Nat.

Neuron. 2003; 40: 595-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), we were interested in further characterizing whether Mib2 was a phosphorylation-dependent NR2B-interacting protein. Mib2 Interacts with the NR2B Subunit in a Phosphorylation-dependent Manner—Having identified the RING finger domain of Mib2 as a phosphorylation-dependent interactant with the cytoplasmic tail of NR2B in a yeast system, we next set out to determine whether this interaction occurs in mammalian cells. The RING finger domain of Mib2 was expressed as a HA-tagged protein together with GFP-tagged NR2B subunit in HEK293 cells, and the interaction between NR2B and this Mib2 domain was determined by immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 2A (lane 1), anti-NR2B antibodies co-immunoprecipitated the RING finger domain of Mib2, indicating that the two proteins exist as a complex. IgG antibodies did not immunoprecipitate either NR2B or the RING finger domain, demonstrating the specificity of the observed interaction (Fig. 2A, lane 2). Next, we determined whether the interaction between Mib2 and the NR2B subunit is regulated by Fyn phosphorylation. To do so, FynCA was transfected into HEK293 cells in addition to Mib2 and NR2B. Expression of FynCA in HEK293 cells resulted in robust tyrosine phosphorylation of the NR2B subunit (Fig. 2A, lane 4 versus lane 1, top panel). The association of the RING finger domain of Mib2 with NR2B showed a small, but significant, enhancement in the presence of FynCA (Fig. 2A, lane 4 versus lane 1, bottom panel, and Fig. 2B). However, transfection of full-length Mib2 into the same mammalian system resulted in a marked 2-fold increase in association in the presence of Fyn kinase (Fig. 2, C and D), suggesting that additional domains contained in the full-length protein contribute to its binding and regulated interaction with the NR2B subunit. Taken together, we show that the interaction between Mib2 and NR2B is significantly enhanced in a Fyn phosphorylation-dependent manner in mammalian cells. To assess whether the interaction between NR2B and Mib2 is specific, we determined if Mib2 interacts with the NR1 obligatory subunit of the NMDAR. To do so, we expressed Mib2 together with NR1 in HEK293 cells. Anti-NR1 antibodies immunoprecipitated NR1, but failed to co-immunoprecipitate Mib2 (Fig. 2E), suggesting that Mib2 interacts specifically with NR2B, but not the NR1 subunit of the NMDAR. Mib2 Interacts Directly with the Cytoplasmic Tail of NR2B—We next set out to determine if the interaction that we observed in mammalian cells was occurring through a direct protein-protein interaction between Mib2 and NR2B. Proteins encoding the C-terminal regions of the NR1 and NR2B subunit tagged with MBP were expressed in E. coli and incubated with in vitro translated radiolabeled Mib2 (35S-Mib2). As shown in Fig. 3A, 35S-Mib2 binds to MBP-NR2B (lane 3) but not to MBP-NR1 (lane 2) or the MBP tag alone (lane 1). Furthermore, 35S-Mib2 bound strongly to a phosphomimic mutant form of MBP-NR2B (MBP-NR2B-mut) in which the three main sites of tyrosine phosphorylation by Src family kinases (Tyr1252, Tyr1336, Tyr1472) have been mutated to aspartic acids to mimic constitutive phosphorylation (Fig. 3A, lanes 4 versus 3). 35S-Mib2 was also observed to bind significantly more strongly to the distal portio"

Because of the high prevalence of dyslipidemia in the general population (1Ginsberg H.N. Zhang Y.L. Hernandez-Ono A. Obesity (Silver Spring). 2006; 14: 41S-49SCrossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), it is important to identify signaling factors regulating metabolic and regulatory aspects of the TG metabolism.

PKC consists of several isoforms (5Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar, 6Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3535) Google Scholar), and evidence from knock-out studies has indicated that several PKC isoforms can modulate glucose or energy metabolism in an isoform-specific manner. For example, inactivation of PKCα did not alter either basal glucose or energy metabolism (7Leitges M. Plomann M. Standaert M.L. Bandyopadhyay G. Sajan M.P. Kanoh Y. Farese R.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 847-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), whereas inactivation of PKCλ slightly reduced liver TG contents, without affecting muscle TG levels, and caused increased overall insulin sensitivity (8Matsumoto M. Ogawa W. Akimoto K. Inoue H. Miyake K. Furukawa K. Hayashi Y. Iguchi H. Matsuki Y. Hiramatsu R. Shimano H. Yamada N. Ohno S. Kasuga M. Noda T. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). On the other hand, inactivation of PKCθ led to increased susceptibility to obesity and dietary insulin resistance in mice (9Gao Z. Wang Z. Zhang X. Butler A.A. Zuberi A. Gawronska-Kozak B. Lefevre M. York D. Ravussin E. Berthoud H.R. McGuinness O. Cefalu W.T. Ye J. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 292: E84-E91Google Scholar). Unlike many PKC isoforms, PKCβ is expressed as a major isoform in a variety of tissues, and knock out of PKCβ caused subtle changes in glucose homeostasis but significantly increased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes and muscle (10Standaert M.L.

We have previously shown involvement of PKCβ in regulating expression of low density lipoprotein receptor gene in cultured cells (11Kapoor G.S. Golden C. Atkins B.A. Mehta K.D. J.

Jirousek M.R. Koya D. Takagi C. Xia P. Clermont A. Bursell S.E. Kern T.S. Ballas L.M. Heath W.F. Stramm L.E. Feener E.P. King G.L.

How does PKCβ deficiency affect glucose metabolism? As several manifestations of type 2 diabetes are associated with alterations in intracellular lipid partitioning, one plausible mechanism is the modulation of tissue TG metabolism. We hypothesized that PKCβ-/- mice would have reduced levels of tissue TG, causing increased sensitivity to insulin. To test this hypothesis, we studied the metabolism of mice with targeted disruption of the PKCβ gene (PKCβ-/-), with special attention to lipid metabolism. We found that mice lacking PKCβ show decreased fat in adipose tissue, liver, and muscle. These mice consumed 20–30% more food than did the wild type (WT), yet lost body weight. Finally, PKCβ-/- mice exhibit increased fatty acid oxidation with concurrent up-regulation of PGC-1α and UCP-2 genes. These results raise the possibility that pharmacological manipulation of PKCβ may lead to loss of body fat in the context of normal caloric intake. Production and Genotyping of PKCβ-/- Mice in C57BL/6 Background—Generation of PKCβ-/- mice was described earlier (16Leitges M. Schmedt C. Guinamard R. Davoust J. Schaal S. Stabel S. Tarakhovsky A. Science. 1996; 273: 788-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). They were crossed back ten times to the C57BL/6 background. Mice were housed in a pathogen-free barrier facility, 25 °C, 12-h dark/12-h light cycle, and fed regular rodent chow food. All procedures on mice followed the guidelines established by The Ohio State University College of Medicine Animal Care Committee. We developed a PCR method for genotyping using tail tips collected when the mice were weaned at 3 weeks of age. For genotyping, tail DNA was extracted, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was performed using the following primers: PKCβ forward primer, 5′-TGTGCTTTTACAGGGGCTTC-3′; PKCβ reverse primers, 5′-ATTCAGGCTGCGCAACTG T-3′ and 5′-CTTTCCTGGATGGTGCATCT-3′. Polymerase chain reaction conditions were 35 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 50 sec. Products were separated by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel and visualized with ethidium bromide staining. Most of the experiments were performed on animals starved for 16 h. Blood Chemistries—We determined plasma TG and cholesterol concentrations by colorimetric kit assays (Roche Diagnostics). Plasma glucose levels were determined with a kit assay (Sigma). Plasma leptin levels were determined by LINCO, Inc. Tissue Lipids—We measured tissue TG with a TG 320A kit (Sigma) as described. For qualitative analysis of tissue lipids, lipids were extracted from tissues and separated on ALSILG Silica Gel TLC plates (Whatman) using hexane:ethyl ether:acetic acid (83:16:1). Histology—Tissues were fixed by immersion or perfusion in neutral buffered formalin, dehydrated in ethanols, transitioned into xylene, and embedded in paraffin. We stained sections with hematoxylin and eosin. Diet, Feeding, and Weighing—At 32 weeks, the mice were housed individually and allowed to acclimatize for 2 weeks. At 34 weeks of age, the food was weighed three times weekly over a period of 10 weeks, and food intake was determined over the time period of 34–44 weeks of age (n = 6 of each genotype). Gene Expression Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) of WT and PKCβ-/- mice, using the TRIzol method as described previously (17Mehta K.D. Radominska-Pandya A. Kapoor G.S. Dave B. Atkins B.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3783-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (Invitrogen). All RNA samples were digested with DNase I to eliminate any contaminating DNA. Equal amounts of total RNA (1 μg/assay) were reverse-transcribed using the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen, Life Technology, Inc.) and random hexamer primers. The resulting cDNA (reverse transcription mixture) was subjected to real-time PCR using SYBR Green PCR master mix kit (Applied Biosystems). To ensure the validity of the SYBR Green-based mRNA quantifications, most of the mRNA was also quantified using 32P-labeled dCTP. This alternative method and the SYBR Green method gave similar results. Forward and reverse primers for amplification of genes are described in supplemental Table 1. All data are expressed as the -fold induction relative to each control value. Electron Microscopy—Epididymal fat pads and brown adipose tissue from WT and PKCβ-/- mice were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4. The samples were postfixed with OsO4, dehydrated with alcohol, and embedded in epoxy embedding medium. Thin sections were cut at 70-nm thickness with a Leica EM UC6 ultramicrotome. Samples were stained with 2% uranyl acetate followed by Reynold's lead citrate. Electron microscope imaging of all the prepared materials was done with a Tencai G2 Spirit (FEI, Hillsboro, OR) operated at 80 kV. Indirect Calorimetry—Oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) were determined in gender-matched PKCβ-/- and WT littermates using a single-chamber small animal VERSAMAX system (AccuScan Instruments, Inc., Columbus, OH). Mice were continuously assayed during 5-h dark (7:30 p.m.-12:30 a.m.) or 5-h light (9:30 a.m.-2:30 p.m.) cycles after acclimatization to the chambers for 2 h immediately prior to the collection period. The VERSMAX software includes an O2 and CO2 analyzer calibration program and data collection and analysis programs. Production of 14CO2 from [1-14C]Palmitic Acid and [1-14C]Oleic Acid—Palmitate and oleate oxidation was measured by the production of 14CO2 from [1-14C]palmitic acid (0.2 μCi/ml) and [1-14C]oleic acid (0.2 μCi/ml) with unlabeled palmitate and oleate present in the medium. Cells were incubated for 1 h in 20-ml plastic scintillation flasks. The flasks had a centered isolated well containing a loosely folded piece of filter paper moistened with 0.2 ml of 2-phenylethylamine/methanol (1:1, v/v). After the 1-h incubation period, the medium was acidified with 0.25 ml of H2SO4 (5N), and the flasks were maintained sealed at 37 °C for an additional 30 min. At the end of this period, filter papers were carefully removed and transferred into scintillation vials for radioactivity counting. Statistical Analysis—All results are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were by Student's t tests or analysis of variance, as indicated in the text and figure legends. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05, where NS indicates not significant. We first examined body weight of PKCβ-/- mice. Compared with WT mice of the same age and sex, PKCβ-/- mice have lower body weight. As shown in Fig. 1, this is especially pronounced in the older mice (33.34 ± 3.1 WT versus 27.61 ± 2.4 g PKCβ-/-, n = 12, p < 0.002) compared with younger mice (24.9 ± 2.3 WT versus 22.6 ± 1.9 g PKCβ-/-, n = 6, p < 0.05) (Fig. 1, A and B). The loss of PKCβ also led to changes in adipose tissue physiology (Fig. 1, C and D). The epididymal fat pads (WAT) in the PKCβ-/- mice were almost 3-fold smaller than controls (1.2 ± 0.27 WT versus 0.37 ± 0.07 g PKCβ-/-, p < 0.001, Fig. 1, D and E). Likewise, BAT of PKCβ-/- mice were slightly smaller than controls (140 ± 5.3 WT versus 98.5 ± 7.8 mg PKCβ-/-, p < 0.003). The liver (Fig. 1, D and F), kidney, heart, and skeletal muscle (results not shown) of WT and mutant mice appeared grossly normal and were of similar mass. Histological analysis revealed greater numbers of larger adipocytes in WT than PKCβ-/- mice. This difference in frequency distribution was reflected in a ∼2.5-fold reduction in mean surface area of adipocytes from PKCβ-/- mutant mice, suggesting that decreased cell size partly contributed to fat mass decrease. The smaller adipocyte size in WAT of PKCβ-/- mice may reflect a certain population sensitive to lipid accumulation. Adipocytes of WT and PKCβ-/- BAT pads were filled with multilocular lipid droplets that, overall, appeared larger in WT mice (Fig. 1G). Thickness of the adipose tissue beneath the dermis in PKCβ-/- mutant mice was also clearly reduced compared with that in the WT mice (Fig. 1H). The mean thickness of adipose tissues of WT and PKCβ-/- mice was 53.1 ± 13.7 and 19.7 ± 3.1 μm (mean ± S.E.; n = 10 regions for each genotype of mice; p < 0.01), respectively. In addition to epididymal fat pads, total TG content in the liver (21.5 ± 1.3 WT versus 6.4 ± 0.35 mg/g PKCβ-/-, n = 12, p < 0.001) and muscle (13.04 ± 0.90 WT versus 3.29 ± 0.3 mg/g PKCβ-/-, p < 0.003) of PKCβ-/- mice was also dramatically decreased (Fig. 2A). Thin layer chromatography of total lipids extracted from liver and muscle of PKCβ-/- mice demonstrated markedly reduced TG levels compared with the lipids extracted from WT mice (Fig. 2B). The liver cholesterol contents were slightly reduced in mutant mice (1.05 ± 0.09 WT versus 0.90 ± 0.1 mg/g PKCβ-/-, p < 0.05, Fig. 2C). The differences in endogenous tissue TG between WT and PKCβ-/- mice may be secondary to differences in plasma TG levels, since there is a 33% reduction in plasma TG levels (64.5 ± 5.1 WT versus 43.8 ± 2.1 mg/dl PKCβ-/-, n = 8, p < 0.05; Fig. 2D). The plasma cholesterol levels, on the other hand, were similar in both groups of mice (71 ± 4.7 WT versus 73 ± 5.2 mg/dl, PKCβ-/-, n = 8, p = NS; Fig. 2E). Although the body weight of PKCβ-/- mice was less than WT (Fig. 1B), these mice appeared to be mildly hyperphagic and consistently consumed a greater caloric load (21.6 ± 0.7 PKCβ-/-versus 17.5 ± 0.4 calories/day WT, a 20% increase for PKCβ-/-versus WT, n = 6, p < 0.05) (Fig. 3A). When energy intake was calculated relative to an increase in body weight (feed efficiency) over the 10-week period, the PKCβ-/- mice had a lower feed efficiency as compared with the WT mice (0.52 ± 0.02 WT versus 0.73 ± 0.1 calories/g of body weight gained/day PKCβ-/-, 40% increase, p < 0.001) (Fig. 3B). The plasma leptin levels were significantly reduced in PKCβ-/- mice compared with WT (3.7 ± 0.15 WT versus 0.85 ± 0.07 ng/ml, PKCβ-/-, n = 8, p < 0.001) (Fig. 3C). It is clear that the decreased body weight is not a result of decreased food intake and lower plasma leptin level may be sufficient to increase appetite. The interesting phenomenon that the PKCβ-/- mice ate more food than WT mice daily, but gained less weight, suggests that there are important alterations in energy expenditure and disposition. To examine energy expenditure, we compared the weight loss of WT and PKCβ-/- mice after a 16-h fast. Because energy intake is eliminated, the weight loss under fasting conditions provides a simple observation of energy expenditure. Fig. 4A shows that fasting-induced weight loss was higher in PKCβ-/- mice than in the WT (11.7 ± 0.9 PKCβ-/-versus 7.8 ± 0.3% WT, n = 7, p < 0.003). These results suggested that the decreased adiposity of the PKCβ-/- was due to increased energy expenditure.FIGURE 4PKCβ-/- mice lost more weight than WT, possibly because of increased oxygen consumption (metabolic rate).A, PKCβ-/- mice lost more weight as compared with WT on 16-h fasting (n = 7, *, p < 0.003). All values are given as mean ± S.E. B, metabolic rate and oxygen consumption of male mice on a chow diet (n = 6 each genotype).

All values are given as mean ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next carried out indirect calorimetry to investigate whether the resistance to weight gain was caused by increased energy expenditure. The PKCβ-/- mice consistently exhibited a 31% increase in oxygen consumption versus WT littermates (5.1 ± 0.83 liter/kg of body weight of VO2 WT versus 7.4 ± 0.7 liter/kg of body weight of PKCβ-/- during the entire 3 h; n = 6; Fig. 4B). The respiratory exchange ratio of 0.727 ± 0.004 for WT mice and 0.713 ± 0.003 for PKCβ-/- mice showed that both animals were largely using fatty acids as an energy source. Thus, the failure to accumulate fat with age in PKCβ-/- mice seems to stem from a sharp increase in metabolic rates. To understand the molecular basis of fat loss in PKCβ-/- mice, we analyzed the expression levels of several key genes involved in adipose tissue energy homeostasis. Results are presented in Table 1. Neither peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), which targets enzymes of fatty acid oxidation (18Lee Y. Yu X. Gonales F. Mangelsdorf D.J. Wang M.Y. Richardson C. Witters L.A. Unger R.H.

Kang H. Evans R.M. Cell. 2003; 113: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar), were altered in PKCβ-/- mice. The expression of other adipogenic genes, such as CCAAT enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) and CD36, were also unaltered in mutant mice. There was a significant increase in the expression of UCP-2 in BAT. UCP-2 is widely expressed (20Surwit R.S. Wang S. Petro A.E. Sanchis D. Raimbault S. Ricquier D. Collins S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4061-4065Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) and was also increased in WAT. PPARγ-coactivator α (PGC-1α), a key regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration (21Wu Z. Puigserver P. Andersson U. Zhang C. Adelmant G. Mootha V. Troy A. Cinti S. Lowell B. Scarpulla R.C. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3189) Google Scholar), was strikingly elevated in both BAT and WAT. This is in agreement with a recent study showing an inverse relationship between PGC-1α protein expression and TG accumulation in rodent skeletal muscle (22Benton C.R. Han X.X. Febbraio M. Graham T.E. Bonen A. J. Appl. Physiol. 2006; 100: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The increase in PGC-1α may also account for increased expression of UCP-2 (23Oberkofler H.

Consistent with an increase in PGC-1α, expression of medium chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase, a nuclearly encoded mitochondrial fatty acid β oxidation enzyme, regulated in parallel with fatty acid oxidation rates, was also increased. There was also an increase in carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2, which is involved in fatty acid transport to mitochondria. The increase in lipogenic SREBP-1c expression is possibly due to lower endogenous TG levels. The decreased expression of the lipid droplet protein perilipin can promote increased lipolysis in the PKCβ-/- adipocytes. Perilipin has recently been shown to play a key role in determining body habitus as its absence leads to a lean and obesity-resistant phenotype in mice (24Martinez-Botas J. Anderson J.B. Tessier D.

The RNA was pooled, and 10-ng cDNA aliquots were subjected to real-time PCR. Data are representative of four separate experiments.

It is significantly increased in adipocytes of WAT (205 + 15% palmitate and 190 + 10% oleate) and BAT (187 + 10% palmitate and 165 + 9% oleate) from PKCβ-/- mice compared with WT littermates (Fig. 5). This appears to be accompanied by increase in number and size of mitochondria containing numerous cristae in both WAT and BAT of PKCβ-/- mice (Fig. 6). The above results are consistent with a recent demonstration that AMPK activation inhibits adipose fatty acid oxidation (25Gaidhu M.P. Fediuc S. Ceddia R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25956-25964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Leptin is a known activator of AMPK, and low plasma leptin levels in PKCβ-/- mice compared with WT (Fig. 3) are expected to promote adipose fatty acid oxidation in the PKCβ-/- mice.FIGURE 6Increased adipose mitochondrial hypergeneration in PKCβ-/- mice. Adipose tissues were fixed and prepared for electron microscopy (×11,000).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is interesting to note that disruption of PKCβ in mice achieves several outcomes that are typically associated with the inactivation of key components of adipose tissue storage capacity (26Abu-Elheiga L.

Chem. 2002; 277: 45874-45879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), resulting in enhanced lipolysis or a reduced ability to store TG. Importantly, this reduced energy storage consistently results in increased energy expenditure due to repartitioning of energy substrates, to the point where increased food intake cannot compensate. Increased expression of the mitochondrial genes (PGC-1α or UCPs) in PKCβ-/- mice could promote systemic energy expenditure because of thermogenic effects, i.e. generation of heat (reviewed in Ref. 30Lowell B.B. Shulman G.I. Science. 2005; 307: 384-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar) and a concurrent decrease in oxidative phosphorylation (31Cline G.W. Vidal-Puig A.J. Dufour S. Cadman K.S. Lowell B.B. Shulman G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20240-20244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Potential mechanisms for elevated fat loss in PKCβ-/- mice may be related to an increase in PGC-1α expression resulting in enhanced mitochondrial capacity and “internal combustion,” as forced expression of this coactivator in human fat cells enhances fatty acid oxidation (32Tiraby C. Tavernier G. Lefort C. Larrouy D. Bouillaud F. Ricquier D. Langin D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33370-33376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Increase in PGC-1α would thus expand the oxidative machinery required for enhanced oxidation, while increased UCP-2 protein would dissipate the unneeded energy as heat. Involvement of PKCβ in regulating mitochondrial biogenesis is supported by a recent observation that linked PKCβ with mitochondrial survival pathways (33Pinton P. Rimessi A. Marchi S. Orsini F. Migliaccio E. Giorgio M. Contursi C. Minucci S. Mantovani F. Science. 2007; 315: 659-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Taken together, it appears that one of the consequences of PKCβ deficiency is to partition fat toward increased oxidation and the elevation in fatty acid oxidation capacity is powerful enough to overcome increased food intake. It is not clear whether the increased fatty acid oxidation in adipose tissue is sufficient to significantly promote redistribution of fat from liver and muscle into the adipocytes, much as fat transplantation does in fat-deficient lipodystrophic mice (34Gavrilova O. Marcus-Samuels B. Graham D. Kim J.K. Shulman G.I. Castle A.L. Vinson C. Eckhaus M. Reitman M.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). It is also conceivable that central regulatory actions of PKCβ in the brain, especially hypothalamus, may impact body energy expenditure and metabolic control. Various central nervous system-mediated gene targets result in a lean phenotype, often with increased metabolic rate (35Reitman M.L. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2002; 22: 459-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In any event, PKCβ-dependent increased oxidative capacity may have important therapeutic implications for the treatment of obesity and obesity-related disorders. PKCβ antagonists are currently undergoing clinical trials to reduce diabetes-linked complications (14Ishii H. Jirousek M.R. Koya D. Takagi C. Xia P. Clermont A. Bursell S.E. Kern T.S. Ballas L.M.

https://openalex.org/W1977046352,"Chronic inflammation of mucosae is associated with an increased cancer risk. Tumorigenesis in these tissues is associated with the activity of some proteinases, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and β-catenin. Serine proteinases participate in both inflammation and tumorigenesis through the activation of proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR2), which up-regulates COX-2 by an unknown mechanism. We sought to determine whether β-catenin participated in PAR2-induced COX-2 expression and through what cellular mechanism. In A549 epithelial cells, we showed that PAR2 activation increased COX-2 expression through the β-catenin/T cell factor transcription pathway. This effect was dependent upon ERK1/2 MAPK, which inhibited the β-catenin-regulating protein, glycogen synthase kinase-3β, and induced the activity of the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB). Knockdown of CREB by small interfering RNA revealed that PAR2-induced β-catenin transcriptional activity and COX-2 expression were CREB-dependent. A co-immunoprecipitation assay revealed a physical interaction between CREB and β-catenin. Thus, PAR2 up-regulated COX-2 expression via an ERK1/2-mediated activation of the β-catenin/Tcf-4 and CREB pathways. These findings reveal new cellular mechanisms by which serine proteinases may participate in tumor development and are particularly relevant to cancers associated with chronic mucosal inflammation, where serine proteinases are abundant and COX-2 overexpression is a common feature.

The mechanisms by which PAR2 activation induces the expression of COX-2 are still unclear. However, it is known that the cox2 gene can be induced by the transcriptional activity of β-catenin. Many cancers are characterized by mutations of either β-catenin or components of its degradation complex, such that it accumulates in the cytoplasm, translocates to the nucleus, and binds to the nuclear binding protein Tcf-4 to induce the expression of genes associated with cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, including c-myc (19He T.C.

Here, using a human epithelial cancer cell line, we show that a selective PAR2 agonist and endogenous activators of PAR2 increase the expression of COX-2 through the activation of the β-catenin/Tcf-4 signaling pathway and an ERK-dependent pathway. Moreover, PAR2 induced the activation of CREB, which directly interacted with β-catenin in the process of PAR2-induced COX-2 expression. Cell Culture—The human airway epithelial cell line A549 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cells were serum-starved for 1 h prior to stimulation with PAR2-AP, trypsin, or matriptase. Chemicals and Reagents—The inhibitors for MEK, PD98058 and U0126, were purchased from Promega (Nepean, Ontario, Canada). The inhibitors for EGFr tyrosine kinase (AG1478) and Src (PP1) were from Calbiochem. Trypsin was from Sigma, and actinomycin D was from Invitrogen. SLIGRL-NH2 and LRGILS-NH2 were prepared at the peptide synthesis facility of the University of Calgary. The composition and purity of the peptides and the concentrations of stock solutions were verified by using high pressure liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, and amino acid analysis. Matriptase was prepared essentially as described previously (23Desilets A. Longpre J.M. Beaulieu M.E. Leduc R. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2227-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Plasmids—TOPFLASH and FOPFLASH (24Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2896) Google Scholar) were generously provided by Drs. M. C. Hung and J. Deng at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX. Wild-type and mutant κB-luciferase reporters were generously provided by Drs. B. Winston and Y. Huang at the University of Calgary. pTK-RL was purchased from Promega. Immunoblot—Whole cell lysates and cytosolic extracts were prepared as described previously (25Wang H. MacNaughton W.K. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 8604-8607Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The antibodies used and their suppliers were as follows: anti-COX-2 (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI); anti-phospho-ERK1/2, anti-total ERK1/2, and anti-phospho-GSK-3α/β (Ser-21/9) (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Danvers, MA); anti-total β-catenin and anti-total GSK-3β (BD Transduction Laboratories); anti-phospho-CREB (Ser-133) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN); anti-total CREB and anti-actin (Sigma); and anti-active β-catenin and anti-Tcf-4 (Upstate, Temecula, CA). Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgGs conjugated to peroxidase (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were used as secondary antibodies. Immunoblots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). All the membranes were reblotted for actin, which was used as a loading control. The intensity of the bands was analyzed by Quantity One™ software (Bio-Rad). Densitometry data were expressed as the ratio to actin. Enzyme Immunoassay of PGE2—For PGE2 assay, A549 cells were seeded onto 12-well plates. After treatment for 3 h, the media were collected and diluted 10 times, and the amount of PGE2 in the diluted samples was determined using an enzyme immunoassay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cayman Chemical). The amount of PGE2 formed and released in response to stimulation was calculated according to the standard curve established on the same plate. RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The RT reaction was performed using 500 ng of total RNA that was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using a random hexamer primer (Invitrogen). PCR was performed with a HotStarTaq™ master mix kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR for actin was done as an internal control. The annealing temperatures for COX-2 and actin were 65 and 50 °C, respectively. Primer sequences for COX-2 were as follows: sense, 5′-TTCAAATGAGATTGTGGGAAAATTGC-3′; and antisense, 5′-AGATCATCTCTGCCTGAGTATCTT-3′. PCR products were then separated in a 2% agarose gel with ethidium bromide. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Transient transfection was performed with β-catenin-driven luciferase (TOPFLASH) or κB-driven luciferase plasmid as a reporter for transcriptional activity. The transfection agent Lipofectamine™ (Invitrogen) was incubated with DNA in serum-free media for 30 min before being added to cells and incubating for an additional 2 h. Cell lysates for luciferase activity were collected 24 h after transfection, and cells were treated with PAR2-AP for 3 h before harvesting. Plasmids with mutant Tcf-4 sites (FOPFLASH) or with mutant κB binding sites (mutant κB-luciferase) were used as controls in the transfection assays. All data were normalized by pTK-RL. The luciferase assays were performed with a Dual-Luciferase assay kit (Promega). Nuclear Fractionation and Co-immunoprecipitation—After treatment of the cells, nuclear fractionation and co-immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (26Nath N. Kashfi K. Chen J. Rigas B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12584-12589Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were suspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES with 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm EGTA) for 15 min to allow the cells to swell. Nonidet P-40 was then added to the cell suspension, and the mixture was vortexed vigorously for 10 s. The homogenate was centrifuged (10,000 × g) at 4°C for 30 s. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 25 μl of ice-cold nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES with 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). After incubation on ice for 30 min, the samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected as the nuclear fraction. Anti-Tcf-4 or anti-CREB antibody (2 μg) with 40 μl of protein A/G-PLUS-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to 200 μg of nuclear extract in the buffer mentioned above and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed three times with this buffer, and the proteins were dissolved and boiled in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. After transfer, the membranes were blotted for β-catenin and Tcf-4. The nuclear extract without immunoprecipitation was blotted with anti-CREB antibody and used as a loading control for the CREB pulldown assay. Negative controls were conducted in a similar manner, but with either mouse IgG or rabbit serum instead of specific antibody during immunoprecipitation. siRNA for β-Catenin and CREB—siRNA was performed to knock down targeted genes. Duplex oligonucleotide siRNA was purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). The target sequences of siRNA oligonucleotides were as follows: β-catenin, 5′-AAGUCCUGUAUGAGUGGGAAC-3′; CREB, 5′-GCTCGAGAGTGTCGTAGAA-3′; and a nonspecific duplex oligonucleotide control (CONTROL™, Dharmacon). siRNA (400 pmol/well in a 6-well plate) was transfected using 10 μl of Lipofectamine™. Treatment of cells with PAR2-AP occurred 24 h after transfection. Immunocytochemistry—A549 cells were seeded onto 8-well chamber slides. After treatment with or without PAR2-AP for 3 h, cells were fixed in methanol for 30 min at –20 °C. After washing, cells were blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for at least 2 h. The cells were then incubated with anti-β-catenin antibody (1:100 in 2% bovine serum albumin) or anti-active β-catenin antibody (1:50 in 2% bovine serum albumin) overnight at 4 °C. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Invitrogen) was applied at 1:150 for a 2-h incubation. Nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (10 μg/ml) for 5 min. Imaging was performed with an Olympus FluoView 1000 confocal laser scanning microscope. COX-2 Promoter Mutations—The wild-type full-length COX-2 promoter-luciferase construct was provided by Dr. M. C. Hung. Mutations in the TBE site and the CRE site in the promoter were made by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (27Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). The TBE site (–1079/–1073) was mutated from CTTTGAT to CTTGGGC. The CRE site (–60/–56) was mutated from CGTCA to GAGCT. A double mutation was built by inserting the TBE mutation fragment into a HindIII-NcoI-digested CRE-mutated luciferase vector. Clones were verified by restriction digests and sequencing. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as the means ± S.E. Comparison of more than two groups was made using analysis of variance with a post hoc Tukey test. Comparison of two groups was made using Student's t test for unpaired data. An associated probability (p) value of <0.05 was considered significant. Activation of PAR2 Increases COX-2 Expression—We used the human lung carcinoma-derived A549 epithelial cell line as a model for PAR2-induced COX-2 expression (14Kawao N. Nagataki M. Nagasawa K. Kubo S. Cushing K. Wada T. Sekiguchi F. Ichida S. Hollenberg M.D. MacNaughton W.K. Nishikawa H. Kawabata A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 315: 576-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We showed by immunoblotting that the selective PAR2 activating peptide, SLIGRL-NH2, but not the reverse-sequence inactive peptide, LRGILS-NH2, induced a significant increase in COX-2 protein expression (Fig. 1A) 3 h after PAR2 activation. The endogenous activators of PAR2, trypsin and matriptase, also stimulated COX-2 protein expression (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, PAR2 activation by PAR2-AP, trypsin, and matriptase increased PGE2 secretion at this time point (Fig. 1B), indicating that PAR2 activation induced the expression of functional COX-2. RT-PCR showed that the up-regulation of COX-2 enzyme triggered by PAR2-AP, trypsin, and matriptase correlated with an increase in COX-2 mRNA (Fig. 1C). Pretreatment with the inhibitor of transcription, actinomycin D, completely abolished the PAR2-AP-induced increase in COX-2 mRNA (Fig. 1D), indicating that PAR2 induced COX-2 expression at the transcriptional level. β-Catenin/Tcf-4 Pathway Mediates PAR2-induced COX-2 Expression—Activation of PAR2 significantly elevated β-catenin transcriptional activity as demonstrated by the TOPFLASH luciferase reporter assay (Fig. 2A). When Tcf-4 was immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts of A549 cells exposed to PAR2-AP, trypsin, or matriptase, we observed a significant increase of coprecipitated β-catenin compared with control cells (Fig. 2B), indicating that PAR2 activation increased the binding of β-catenin to Tcf-4 in the nucleus. To test whether the activation of β-catenin was required for PAR2-induced COX-2 expression, we used siRNA to selectively knock down β-catenin. Transfection of A549 cells with β-catenin-targeted siRNA substantially reduced the transcriptional activity (Fig. 2C) and protein level (Fig. 2D) of β-catenin and significantly attenuated PAR2-induced COX-2 expression (Fig. 2D). Because NF-κB is also important for transcriptional regulation of COX-2, we tested whether NF-κB was activated by PAR2 signaling by using a κB-driven luciferase reporter. Treatment with tumor necrosis factor-α was used as a positive control for the activation of the NF-κB pathway (Fig. 2E). PAR2-AP at 25 and 50 μm did not significantly change NF-κB activity. However, when the concentration of PAR2-AP was increased to 100 μm, a concentration above that which activated β-catenin transcriptional activity, we did observe an elevation in κB-luciferase activity (Fig. 2E). PAR2 Activation of β-Catenin Occurs through an ERK-dependent Pathway—The activation of PAR2 by activating peptide (PAR2-AP) or trypsin stimulated the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway as determined by an increase in phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Fig. 3A). Inhibitors of MEK (PD98059 and U0126), the kinase that activates ERK1/2, significantly blocked PAR2-induced β-catenin transcriptional activity (Fig. 3B) and reduced the binding of β-catenin to Tcf-4 (Fig. 3C). In addition, the expression of COX-2 induced by PAR2-AP and trypsin was reduced by the inhibition of ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 3D). These data indicated that ERK1/2 activation induced by PAR2 led to β-catenin activation and COX-2 expression. Inactivation of GSK-3β by an ERK-dependent Pathway—GSK-3β is part of the degradation complex that targets β-catenin to the proteasome. Phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser-9 inhibits its activity, and β-catenin transcriptional activity subsequently increases. To test whether ERK1/2 induces β-catenin activation through inactivation of GSK-3β by phosphorylation of Ser-9, we measured the inactivated (phosphorylated Ser-9) form of GSK-3β by immunoblot analysis and found a significant accumulation of inactive GSK-3β (Fig. 4A). Surprisingly, there was no significant change in the total amount of β-catenin (data not shown) or in the nuclear level of β-catenin (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2). However, although total β-catenin did not change, we demonstrated an increase in the N-terminally dephosphorylated, active form of β-catenin after PAR2 activation (Fig. 4A). Significantly, the MEK inhibitor U0126 dramatically blocked the PAR2-stimulated accumulation of both the inactivated phospho-GSK-3β and active N-terminally dephosphorylated β-catenin (Fig. 4B). These results strongly suggested that PAR2 caused an ERK1/2-mediated inhibition of GSK-3β concurrent with the accumulation of N-terminally dephosphorylated, active β-catenin that could translocate to the nucleus to induce COX-2 expression (Fig. 2B). The nuclear accumulation of the active form of β-catenin was demonstrated by immunocytochemistry. The primarily membrane distribution of inactive β-catenin was not affected by exposure of cells to SLIGRL-NH2 (Fig. 4C). However, PAR2 activation resulted in a substantial increase in the nuclear localization of active β-catenin immunoreactivity (Fig. 4C). EGFr Is Not Involved in PAR2-induced β-Catenin Activation—EGFr has been shown to increase β-catenin nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity (28Lu Z. Ghosh S. Wang Z. Hunter T. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 499-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), and PAR2 has been shown to transactivate EGFr through Src (29Darmoul D. Gratio V. Devaud H. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20927-20934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 30Caruso R. Pallone F. Fina D. Gioia V. Peluso I. Caprioli F. Stolfi C.

To test whether the activated EGFr might account for PAR2-induced β-catenin activation, we used inhibitors of EGFr tyrosine kinase activity (AG1478) and Src (PP1). Neither of these inhibitors blocked PAR2-induced β-catenin activation (Fig. 3B). CREB Mediates PAR2-induced COX-2 Expression—CREB is another transcription factor that participates in COX-2 expression. Thus, we tested whether CREB was also involved in PAR2-induced COX-2 expression. We found that PAR2 activation by activating peptide or trypsin triggered CREB phosphorylation at Ser-133 (Fig. 5A, lanes 1, 2, and 5). This effect was abolished by the inhibitors of MEK (PD98059 and U0126) (Fig. 5A). siRNA targeting CREB, which knocked down the protein level of CREB (Fig. 5B), significantly reduced PAR2-induced COX-2 expression (Fig. 5C). Crosstalk between β-Catenin and CREB—Interestingly, CREB siRNA not only blocked PAR2-induced COX-2 expression but also abolished PAR2-induced β-catenin activation (Fig. 6A). Moreover, immunoprecipitation of CREB, followed by immunoblotting for β-catenin, showed that PAR2-AP, trypsin, and matriptase all substantially enhanced the binding of β-catenin to CREB compared with the control group (Fig. 6B, lanes 1–4). Moreover, the MEK inhibitors significantly reduced this interaction (Fig. 6B, lanes 5 and 6), suggesting that CREB not only physically, but also functionally, interacted with β-catenin. Promoter analysis showed that the PAR2 activating peptide dramatically increased the activity of the full-length wild-type COX-2 promoter-driven luciferase reporter (Fig. 6D). Mutation of either the TBE site (T-M, Fig. 6C) or the CRE site (C-M, Fig. 6C) in the COX-2 promoter significantly blocked the PAR2-induced COX-2 promoter activation (Fig. 6D). The mutation of both sites (TC-M, Fig. 6C) did not further reduce COX-2 activation (Fig. 6D). These results suggest there was a crosstalk between β-catenin and CREB and that both are required for PAR2-induced COX-2 expression. Tumorigenesis is a complex, multifactorial process in which proteinases, β-catenin, and COX-2 have been implicated. In the present study, we investigated the effects of two serine proteinases, matriptase and trypsin, both of which signal through PAR2 and have been implicated in tumorigenesis. Our data provide a clear link between these serine proteinases, PAR2, and the β-catenin transcription pathway in the stimulation of COX-2 expression. We found that activation of PAR2 caused an increase in functional COX-2 in the A549 tumor cell line via a mechanism involving β-catenin, the ERK1/2 MAPK, and the interaction of TBE- and CREB-mediated transcription. COX-2 is induced by inflammatory and mitogenic stimuli and is highly expressed in colorectal, gastric, lung, and breast carcinomas. Selective inhibitors of COX-2 are effective in the prevention and treatment of some cancers (31Krysan K. Reckamp K.L. Sharma S. Dubinett S.M. Anticancer Agents Med. Chem. 2006; 6: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 32Chow L.W. Loo W.T. Toi M. Biomed. Pharmacother. 2005; 59: S281-S284Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 33Amir M.

Cancer Investig. 2004; 22: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which the level of COX-2 is enhanced in cancer is not well established. We have previously shown that activation of PAR2 can stimulate the expression of COX-2 in A549 cells through a mechanism involving cytosolic phospholipase A2, increased intracellular calcium, ERK1/2, and Src-mediated EGFr transactivation (14Kawao N. Nagataki M. Nagasawa K. Kubo S. Cushing K. Wada T. Sekiguchi F. Ichida S. Hollenberg M.D. MacNaughton W.K. Nishikawa H. Kawabata A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 315: 576-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Here we show that the activation of ERK1/2 is required for subsequent deactivation of GSK-3β and activation of β-catenin transcriptional activity to induce COX-2 expression. It has been shown that ERK-dependent phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser-9 mediates β-catenin stabilization (36Ding Q. Xia W. Liu J.C. Yang J.Y. Lee D.F. Xia J. Bartholomeusz G. Li Y. Pan Y. Li Z. Bargou R.C. Qin J. Lai C.C. Tsai F.J. Tsai C.H. Hung M.C. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser-9 is usually indicative of inactivation of this kinase (37Cohen P. Frame S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar) and is associated with increased β-catenin stability, although recent studies in mice in which GSK-3β has been mutated suggest that this is not always the case (38McManus E.J. Sakamoto K. Armit L.J. Ronaldson L. Shpiro N. Marquez R. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1571-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although based on our earlier study (14Kawao N. Nagataki M. Nagasawa K. Kubo S. Cushing K. Wada T. Sekiguchi F. Ichida S. Hollenberg M.D. MacNaughton W.K. Nishikawa H. Kawabata A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 315: 576-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), Src-mediated EGFr transactivation seems to be required for COX-2 expression, it is not involved in the PAR2-induced activation of β-catenin transcriptional activity, as demonstrated in the present study. Thus, there appear to be EGFr transactivation-dependent and -independent pathways involved in PAR2-induced COX-2 expression. The EGFr-independent component involves β-catenin. Several studies have implicated β-catenin and its nuclear binding proteins in COX-2 expression. COX-2 was down-regulated after the transfection of full-length APC into HT29 cells, which have truncated APC and thus constitutively high β-catenin (39Hsi L.C. Angerman-Stewart J. Eling T.E. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 2045-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Further studies showed that β-catenin up-regulated COX-2 mRNA through transcriptional regulation by the Tcf-4 binding element (21Araki Y. Okamura S. Hussain S.P. Nagashima M. He P. Shiseki M. Miura K. Harris C.C. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 728-734PubMed Google Scholar) and mRNA stabilization (40Lee H.K. Jeong S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 5705-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and that both the TBE and CRE are important in COX-2 expression (41Appleby S.B. Ristimaki A. Neilson K. Narko K. Hla T. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 42Tang Q. Chen W. Gonzales M.S. Finch J. Inoue H. Bowden G.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5164-5172Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Our findings have confirmed the critical role of β-catenin/Tcf-4 in the transcriptional regulation of COX-2 that follows PAR2 activation. Recent findings have demonstrated the importance of the N-terminally unphosphorylated or “active” form of β-catenin in the activation of the β-catenin/Tcf pathway (43Staal F.J. Noort M.M. Strous G.J. Clevers H.C. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 44van Noort M. Meeldijk J. van der Zee R. Destree O. Clevers H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17901-17905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrated that PAR2 activation significantly increased the level of the active form of β-catenin in the nucleus, which is comparable with the previously observed 2-fold increase induced by Wnt-1 (43Staal F.J. Noort M.M. Strous G.J. Clevers H.C. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). PAR2-induced activation of the β-catenin/Tcf-4 pathway without accumulation of total β-catenin is consistent with previous findings that accumulation of the active form does not require ongoing synthesis of β-catenin (45Nelson R.W. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and that accumulation of total β-catenin is insufficient (43Staal F.J. Noort M.M. Strous G.J. Clevers H.C. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 44van Noort M. Meeldijk J. van der Zee R. Destree O. Clevers H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17901-17905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) or does not account (46Guger K.A. Gumbiner B.M. Dev. Biol. 2000; 223: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) for β-catenin-dependent signaling. CREB, which can be activated by Ser-133 phosphorylation in response to several signaling pathways (47Johannessen M. Delghandi M.P. Moens U. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 1211-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), specifically binds to CRE to regulate transcription of numerous genes (48Mayr B. Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar). We showed that ERK1/2 is required for the activation of CREB. In addition, CREB physically interacts with β-catenin, and this interaction is required for β-catenin to activate COX-2 promoter activity. The crosstalk between β-catenin and CREB, indicated by the co-immunoprecipitation data, is in keeping with a previous study demonstrating a role for the CREB site in β-catenin-dependent transcriptional activation of WISP-1, a Wnt-induced secreted protein (49Xu L. Corcoran R.B. Welsh J.W. Pennica D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 585-595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A CREB/β-catenin interaction has also been documented for gastrin-mediated up-regulation of cyclin D1 (6Pradeep A. Sharma C. Sathyanarayana P. Albanese C. Fleming J.V. Wang T.C. Wolfe M.M. Baker K.M. Pestell R.G. Rana B. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3689-3699Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Compared with single mutations, double mutations of TBE and CRE sites in the COX-2 promoter did not further reduce PAR2-induced COX-2 transcriptional activation. This observation suggested that β-catenin and CREB used the same mechanism to up-regulate COX-2 expression. However, the precise mechanism by which β-catenin and CREB interact with CRE and Tcf-4/TBE to promote COX-2 up-regulation appears quite complex and remains an important topic for further study. One of the implications of this work is that the proteinase-PAR2 signaling pathway we have described may represent a valid therapeutic target for cancer therapy. Specifically, inhibition of PAR2 may block tumorigenic epithelial cell signaling pathways. Unfortunately, despite considerable effort, no suitable PAR2 antagonists are yet available. However, by inhibiting concurrently serine proteinase activity, β-catenin, and COX-2, the growth and metastasis of tumor cells could potentially be attenuated. This triple-target strategy merits consideration in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2068516215,"We report the discovery and characterization of three conantokin peptides from the venom of Conus parius. Each peptide (conantokin-Pr1, -Pr2, and -Pr3) contains 19 amino acids with three γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues, a post-translationally modified amino acid characteristic of conantokins. The new peptides contain several amino acid residues that differ from previous conantokin consensus sequences. Notably, the new conantokins lack Gla at the 3rd position from the N terminus, where the Gla residue is replaced by either aspartate or by another post-translationally modified residue, 4-trans-hydroxyproline. Conantokin-Pr3 is the first conantokin peptide to have three different post-translational modifications. Conantokins-Pr1 and -Pr2 adopt α-helical conformations in the presence of divalent cations (Mg2+ and Ca2+) but are generally unstructured in the absence of divalent cations. Conantokin-Pr3 adopts an α-helical conformation even in the absence of divalent cations. Like other conantokins, the new peptides induced sleep in young mice and hyperactivity in older mice upon intracranial injection. Electrophysiological assays confirmed that conantokins-Pr1, -Pr2, and -Pr3 are N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, with highest potency for NR2B-containing NMDA receptors. Conantokin-Pr3 demonstrated ∼10-fold selectivity for NR2B-containing NMDA receptors. However, conantokin-Pr2 showed minimal differences in potency between NR2B and NR2D. Conantokins-Pr1, -Pr2, and -Pr3 all demonstrated high specificity of block for NMDA receptors, when tested against various ligand-gated ion channels. Conus parius conantokins allow for a better definition of structural and functional features of conantokins as ligands targeting NMDA receptors.

Conus parius conantokins allow for a better definition of structural and functional features of conantokins as ligands targeting NMDA receptors. Most families of peptides extracted from the venoms of marine cone snails (genus Conus) are known as conotoxins; these peptides have an unusually high density of disulfide cross-links. In contrast, the conantokins, which are also Conus venom peptides, typically lack disulfide bonds but characteristically contain several residues of an unusual post-translationally modified amino acid, γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla). 2The abbreviations used are:Glaγ, γ-carboxyglutamateACNacetonitrileconconantokinHypO,4-trans-hydroxyprolineMALDImatrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationNMDAN-methyl-d-aspartateHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographynAChRnicotinic acetylcholine receptor.

However, in the ensuing decades only three additional conantokin peptides have been reported in the scientific literature as follows: conantokin-T (con-T) (3Haack J.A. Rivier J. Parks T.N. Mena E.E.

McCabe R.T. Basbaum A.I. Pain. 2003; 101: 101-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In this work, we have identified three peptides that belong to the conantokin family from the venom of the Indo-Pacific fish-hunting cone snail species, Conus parius. We report the purification, synthesis, and characterization of these conantokin peptides. In all previous cases, only a single conantokin peptide was purified and characterized from the venom of any particular Conus species. The characterization of these novel peptides significantly expands the body of knowledge regarding the conantokin family. The C. parius conantokins contain several amino acids that vary from consensus sequences of previously characterized conantokins, including novel post-translational modifications. Consequently, these peptides allow us to better define significant biochemical features of conantokins for targeting NMDA receptors. Preparation of Venom Extract—Venom ducts of C. parius were dissected from the cone snails as described previously (17Cruz L.J. Corpuz G. Olivera B.M. Veliger. 1976; 18: 302-308Google Scholar). The collected venom ducts were lyophilized and stored at –80 °C. Fifteen lyophilized venom ducts were ground over liquid nitrogen with mortar and pestle. Venom was extracted sequentially with 5 ml of H2O, 3 ml each of 20% acetonitrile (ACN), 40% ACN, and 60% ACN. The venom suspension was sonicated in the extracting solvent five times in 30-s intervals at 0 °C and then centrifuged at 5000 × g for 5 min. The combined supernatant (crude venom extract) was lyophilized and stored at –20 °C until further purification. Peptide Purification—The crude venom extract was resuspended in a mixture of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A) and 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid in 90% ACN (solvent B) and applied into a Vydac C18 analytical column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm particle size). Peptides were eluted with a gradient of ACN using solvents A and B. The effluents were monitored at 220 nm. Individual peptides from various peaks were further purified by analytical HPLC runs. Each peptide solution was lyophilized and stored at –20 °C. Peptide Sequencing—One nmol of each of the purified peptides was separately dissolved in 500 μl of a mixture of 80% solvent A and 20% solvent B. The pH was adjusted to 7.5 with 0.5 m Tris base, and dithiothreitol was then added to a final concentration of 10 mm. The solution was flushed with argon, incubated for 20 min at 65 °C, and cooled to room temperature. Two microliters of 4-vinylpyridine were added to the solution, which was placed in the dark at room temperature for 25 min. The peptide solution was then diluted with 500 μl of solvent A and applied into a C18 analytical column. The purified alkylated peptide was sequenced by automated Edman degradation (18Edman P. Begg G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 1: 80-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2422) Google Scholar) on an Applied Biosystem model 492 sequenator, courtesy of Dr. Robert Schackmann of the DNA/Peptide Facility, University of Utah. The phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives were purified by analytical HPLC. Peptide Synthesis—Based on peptide sequences, three peptides were identified as conantokins. The conantokin peptides were synthesized using standard N-(9-fluorenyl) methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-protected amino acids in an ABI model 430A peptide synthesizer, courtesy of Dr. Scott Endicott of the DNA/Peptide Facility, University of Utah. After synthesis, each peptide was cleaved from 20 mg of resin by treatment with 1 ml of a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid/H2O/1,2-ethanedithiol/phenol/thioanisole (82.5/5/2.5/5/5 by volume) with agitation for 1 h at room temperature. The mixture was filtered under vacuum into methyl-tert-butyl ether at –10 °C. Linear peptide was collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min, washed with methyl-tert-butyl ether, and centrifuged again. The pellet was dissolved in 20% ACN in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and applied into a Vydac C18 semi-preparative column (10 × 250 mm, 5-μm particle size). Elution was carried out at 5 ml/min using a gradient of solvent B. Mass Spectrometry—Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectra were obtained using a Voyager GE STR mass spectrometer at the Mass Spectrometry and Proteomic Core Facility of the University of Utah. Molecular Cloning—cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of RNA isolated from a C. parius venom duct as described previously (19Jacobsen R. Jimenez E.C. Grilley M. Watkins M. Hillyard D. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M. J. Pept. Res. 1998; 51: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This cDNA was used as a template for PCR with oligonucleotides corresponding to the conserved signal sequence and 3′-untranslated region sequences of conantokin prepropeptides. The resulting PCR products were purified using the high pure PCR product purification kit (Roche Diagnostics) following the manufacturer's suggested protocol. The eluted DNA fragments were annealed to pAMP1 vector, and the resulting products were transformed into competent DH5α cells, using the CloneAmp pAMP system for rapid cloning of amplification products (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's suggested protocols. The nucleic acid sequences of the resulting conantokin encoding clones were determined according to the standard protocol for automated sequencing. Bioassay—Mice were injected intracranially with 20 μl of peptide in normal saline solution using a syringe with 29-gauge needle according to the method described earlier (20Clark C. Olivera B.M. Cruz L.J. Toxicon. 1981; 19: 691-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Mice injected intracranially with an equal volume of normal saline solution served as negative controls. After injection, the mice were placed in cages for observation. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD data were collected on an Aviv 62DS circular dichroism spectropolarimeter (instrument belonging to Dr. Michael Kay, University of Utah). All measurements were taken at room temperature in a 0.1-cm path length cuvette between 200 and 250 nm. Peptides were dissolved at 90 μm final concentration in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, with or without 2 mm MgCl2. Peptides were separately dissolved at 90 μm final concentration in 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, with or without 2 mm CaCl2. The molar ellipticity (θ) was calculated by using the following equation: θ = (100 × (CD signal at 222 nm))/((n–1) × L × (concentration of peptide in mm)), where n = number of residues in the peptide; L = pathlength of the cuvette in cm; and the CD signal is in millidegrees. The CD signal was adjusted by subtracting the CD signal for buffer solution alone from the CD signal for the solution containing peptide. Molar ellipticity of–40,000 degrees cm2 dmol–1 was estimated to be a perfect α-helix (100% α-helix). The percent helical conformation was calculated by assuming a linear relationship in comparison with 100% α-helix. Heterologous Expression of Receptors in Xenopus Oocytes—The rat NMDA receptor clones used were NR1–3b, NR2A, NR2B, NR2C, and NR2D (GenBank™ accession numbers U08266, AF001423, U11419, U08259, and U08260, respectively). Dr. Steven M. Sine, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, provided the mouse muscle nAChR clones in the cytomegalovirus-based pRBG4 vector. Dr. Stephen F. Heinemann, The Salk Institute, provided rat neuronal nAChR clones. Human neuronal nAChR clones were provided by Dr. Jim Garrett, Cognetix, Inc. α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate receptor clones were provided by Dr. Erin Meyer and Dr. A. Villu Maricq, University of Utah. With the exception of GluR3 and the mouse muscle nAChR clones, all of the expression clones were used to make capped RNA for injection into the oocytes of Xenopus laevis frogs (most clones expressed genes from a T7 promoter). The harvesting of Xenopus oocytes was described previously in detail (21Cartier G.E. Yoshikami D. Gray W.R. Luo S. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7522-7528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Capped RNA was prepared using in vitro RNA transcription kits from Ambion, Inc., according to the manufacturer's protocols. For expression of NMDA receptors and neuronal nAChRs, typically 5 ng of each subunit capped RNA was injected per oocyte. For expression of skeletal muscle nAChRs and GluR3, 1 ng of each subunit cDNA was injected into the nucleus of each oocyte. The plasmid constructs encoding mouse muscle nAChR subunits and GluR3 contain genes expressed from a cytomegalovirus promoter. Oocyte recordings were obtained 1–6 days post-injection. Electrophysiology—Voltage clamp recording of Xenopus oocytes was conducted as described in detail previously (21Cartier G.E. Yoshikami D. Gray W.R. Luo S. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7522-7528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Briefly, all oocytes were voltage-clamped at –70 mV. Oocytes expressing NMDA receptors were gravity perfused with Mg2+-free ND96 buffer (96.0 mm NaCl, 2.0 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.2–7.5). MgCl2 was not included in ND96 buffer used for testing NMDA receptors because Mg2+ blocks NMDA receptors. For all other electrophysiological tests, oocytes were gravity perfused with ND96 buffer (96.0 mm NaCl, 2.0 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.2–7.5). In all cases, bovine serum albumin was added to buffer at a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml to reduce nonspecific adsorption of peptide. Currents were elicited by 1-s pulses of gravity-perfused agonist solution once per min or once per 2 min, depending on the receptor recovery from desensitization. 200 μm glutamate and 20 μm glycine were used as co-agonists for NMDA receptors; 10–200 μm acetylcholine was employed as the agonist for the various nAChRs. Buffer was perfused continuously over the oocytes between agonist pulses, with the exception of 5–10-min equilibration periods, during which buffer flow was halted for the application of a peptide to an oocyte in a static bath. To identify the effect of a peptide on the receptor heterologously expressed in an oocyte, the amplitude of the elicited current following the peptide application and equilibration period was calculated as a percentage of the amplitude of the elicited current prior to toxin application. All data recordings were conducted at room temperature. Data acquisition was automated by a virtual instrument made by Doju Yoshikami of the University of Utah. Concentration-response curves were generated using Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc.), with the following equation, where nH is the Hill coefficient and IC50 is the concentration of peptide causing half-maximal block: % response = 100/{1 + ([peptide]/IC50)nH}. Purification of Conantokins from C. parius Venom—One strategy employed for identifying the molecular targets of Conus peptides has been to assess HPLC-separated fractions from crude venom extracts for biological activity using a behavioral assay on mice. This approach allowed us to isolate three peptides from a single venom preparation of C. parius that all induced sleep in 10-day-old mice when injected intracranially. Using reverse-phase HPLC, the crude venom extract gave the elution profile shown in Fig. 1A. Three peaks containing the sleep-inducing activities were further fractionated to homogeneity as shown in Fig. 1, B–K, giving rise to three distinct peptides described below. Each of the purified peptides was reduced, alkylated. and sequenced as described under “Experimental Procedures” by Edman chemical analysis. MALDI mass spectrometry was used to confirm the masses, which showed masses that differed by 44 mass units for the three peptides, indicating the presence of Gla residues. In Fig. 1C, the purified peptide has 19 amino acid residues with the sequence GEDγYAγGIRγYQLIHGKI^ where γ indicates Gla and the ^ indicates free acid C terminus. MALDI mass spectrometry of the peptide gave average masses of 2352.8, 2309.4, 2265.9, and 2222.2, indicating the decarboxylation of the three Gla residues, consistent with the calculated mass of 2352.4 of the intact peptide. The peptide was referred to as conantokin-Pr1 (con-Pr1). The purified peptide in Fig. 1G includes 19 amino acid residues and has the sequence DEOγYAγAIRγYQLKYGKI^ where O indicates 4-trans-hydroxyproline (Hyp). Based on MALDI mass spectrometry, the peptide has average masses of 2462.8, 2419.2, 2375.4, and 2331.3, in agreement with the calculated mass of 2463.6 of the intact peptide. The peptide was designated conantokin-Pr2 (con-Pr2). Fig. 1K shows a homogeneous peak of the peptide containing 19 amino acid residues with the sequence GEOγ-VAKWAγGLRγKAASN*, where * indicates C-terminal amidation. The average masses determined by MALDI were 2189.6, 2146.2, 2102.7, and 2058.5 (calculated mass of the intact peptide = 2189.2). The peptide was named conantokin-Pr3 (con-Pr3). The genes encoding two of these conantokins have been cloned, confirming the sequences and indicating that the peptides belong to the conantokin family (Tables 1 and 2). Each of the three peptide sequences isolated was unique and different from all previously characterized conantokins. Thus, further in-depth characterization of these peptides was undertaken at this point.TABLE 2Nucleotides and predicted amino acids for conantokin sequences cloned from C. parius venom-duct cDNA Open table in a new tab Peptide Synthesis—Con-Pr1, -Pr2, and -Pr3 were synthesized on solid support as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Mass spectrometry confirmed that native and synthetic peptides had the same masses. In each case, an HPLC fraction of synthetic peptide that eluted with the same retention time as the native peptide also co-eluted with the native peptide when equal quantities of native and synthetic peptide were co-injected into an HPLC column (Fig. 2). The peptide sequencing, molecular cloning, mass spectrometry, and HPLC co-elution data all indicate that the native and synthetic conantokin peptides are chemically identical. In Vivo Biological Activities—All three conantokins (con-Pr1, -Pr2, and -Pr3) induced a sleep-like state in 10-day-old mice and hyperactivity (continuous walking, excessive grooming, and climbing of cage wall) in 24-day-old mice, characteristic of known conantokins (1McIntosh J.M. Olivera B.M. Cruz L.J. Gray W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14343-14346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Haack J.A. Rivier J. Parks T.N. Mena E.E. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M. J. Biol.

Epilepsy Res. 2002; 51: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). An initial screen of the venom-purified conantokins indicated that 1 nmol of each conantokin injected intracranially into 10-day-old mice (6.8–7.2 g) induced light sleep (easily awakened with a touch), which eventually progressed to deep sleep. The three conantokins initially appeared to be almost equally potent in inducing sleep with onset times of light sleep ∼9–11 min after injection. Two nmol of each conantokin in 24-day-old mice (12.2–12.8 g) generally caused hyperactivity within ∼5–8 min from injection time lasting for ∼40 min. Native and synthetic peptides demonstrated the same biological activity, confirming that native and synthetic peptides are identical. With the synthetic conantokins, we explored the induction of sleep in 10-day-old mice in more quantitative detail, utilizing con-G as a positive control. For this assay (see Table 3), the onset of deep sleep was defined as the time at which mice would no longer attempt to roll to their feet after being rolled onto their backs. Saline-injected negative controls always rolled to their feet immediately upon being rolled onto their backs. As demonstrated in Table 3, higher dosages of each conantokin induced sleep more rapidly than lower dosages. In general, the duration of sleep also appeared to be a function of conantokin dosage, with longer duration of sleep associated with higher dosages. However, it was difficult to quantify recovery time because in many cases, mice injected with 0.5–1.0 nmol of a conantokin would partially recover from their sleep but would eventually return to the deep-sleep state where they would not roll over or struggle upon being rolled onto their backs. We have not provided a quantitative assessment of the hyperactivity induced in older mice because the onset of hyperactivity was difficult to identify with precision, and the hyperactivity (continuous walking, excessive grooming and climbing of cage wall) tended to be interrupted by periods of sleep.TABLE 3IC injections of 10-day-old Swiss-Webster micePeptide injected (or saline)DosageNo. of mice injectedNo. of mice in sleep-like stateAverage onset of deep sleep (Minutes)nmolSaline (- control)NAaNA means not applicable.40NACon-G (+ control)5443.914410.00.54210.5Con-Pr15449.016512.20.55418.0Con-Pr25339.712214.00.52217.5Con-Pr353310.712216.50.53221.0a NA means not applicable. Open table in a new tab Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Because con-Pr1, -Pr2, and -Pr3 all shared common characteristics of conantokins, we hypothesized that they would be structurally related to con-G, which adopts an α-helical conformation in solution in the presence of divalent cations. However, it is nearly structureless in the absence of divalent cations (22Chen Z. Blandl T. Prorok M. Warder S.E. Li L. Zhu Y. Pedersen L.G. Ni F. Castellino F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16248-16258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To estimate the α-helical content of the C. parius conantokins, circular dichroism spectroscopy was employed. The α-helical content of con-Pr1 and -Pr2 was estimated to be much greater in the presence of Mg2+ or Ca2+ than in the absence of divalent cations, like con-G (Fig. 3). The estimated α-helical content of con-G (as a control), con-Pr1, and con-Pr2 was greater in the presence of 2 mm Mg2+ than 2 mm Ca2+, consistent with the previous observation that con-G has higher affinity for Mg2+ than Ca2+ and a more definitive structure in the presence of Mg2+ than Ca2+ (22Chen Z. Blandl T. Prorok M. Warder S.E. Li L. Zhu Y. Pedersen L.G. Ni F. Castellino F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16248-16258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In contrast, con-Pr3 adopted a predominantly α-helical conformation in both the presence and absence of divalent cations (Fig. 3), similar to con-T (23Prorok M. Warder S.E. Blandl T. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16528-16534Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Electrophysiology—Considering their sequence and structural similarity to other conantokins, which are known to inhibit NMDA receptors, we tested con-Pr1, -Pr2, and -Pr3 against rat NMDA receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes. In each case, we expressed the NR1–3b splice variant with one NR2 subunit (A–D). Because con-G is reported to inhibit selectively NMDA receptors expressing the NR2B subunit, we used con-G as a control for our experiments. To simulate synaptic neurotransmission, where high concentrations of neurotransmitter are released transiently and then rapidly cleared from the synaptic cleft, we employed the electrophysiological protocol described under “Experimental Procedures” for testing the conantokin peptides. As shown in Fig. 4, 1 μm concentration of con-Pr1 blocked most of the current elicited from voltage-clamped Xenopus oocytes expressing the rat NR1–3b/NR2B NMDA receptor, similar to con-G. Utilizing the same electrophysiological protocol employed in Fig. 4, concentration-response curves were generated for con-Pr1, -Pr2, -Pr3, and -G for all NR2 subunits in combination with the NR1–3b splice variant (Fig. 5). All of these conantokins inhibited the NR2B-subunit-containing receptors with highest relative potency (Fig. 5 and Table 4). Although con-Pr1 and -Pr2 also inhibited NR2D-containing receptors with relatively high potency, con-Pr3 demonstrated ∼10-fold selectivity for NR2B, similar to con-G in our hands. To determine their selectivity for NMDA receptors, we tested each of these peptides against various ligand-gated ion channels. Based on this testing, each of the peptides appears to be specific for NMDA receptors. At 10 μm concentration, each peptide failed to inhibit, or minimally inhibited, currents elicited from nicotinic acetylcholine receptors or non-NMDA glutamate receptors (Fig. 6).FIGURE 5Concentration-response curves for C. parius conantokins and con-G. Various NMDA NR2 subunits were separately co-expressed with NR1–3b in Xenopus oocytes. The electrophysiology protocol described in Fig. 4 and under “Experimental Procedures” was employed to test various concentrations of each peptide against the different subunit combinations.

In each case, 10 μm peptide was applied to oocytes expressing the various receptors as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All conantokins blocked rat NR1–3b/NR2B NMDA receptors completely or nearly completely at 10 μm. However, these conantokins appeared to have little or no effect on other non-NMDA receptors tested. All the non-NMDA receptors tested are subtypes of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, with the exceptions of GluR1 and GluR3, which are α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate-type glutamate receptors (n ≥ 3 tests for each bar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous discovery work on conantokins yielded a single peptide belonging to the conantokin family from each individual Conus venom examined. However, from the venom of C. parius three different conantokins were identified and characterized. This work has significantly expanded the number of conantokin peptides reported in the scientific literature and has contributed to our knowledge regarding conantokin structure-function relationships. The three newly discovered peptides, con-Pr1, -Pr2, and -Pr3, isolated from C. parius, reveal primary amino acid sequences with some general similarities to previously characterized conantokins (1McIntosh J.M. Olivera B.M. Cruz L.J. Gray W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14343-14346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Haack J.A. Rivier J. Parks T.N. Mena E.E. Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M. J. Biol.

Epilepsy Res. 2002; 51: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), most notably the presence of multiple Gla residues and the absence of disulfide bonds. However, these peptides vary from the previous conantokin consensus sequence at several positions (Table 1), suggesting that the conantokin family is more structurally and functionally diverse than previously thought. In contrast to the previous conantokin consensus sequence, all of the C. parius peptides lack a Gla residue at the 3rd position from the N terminus; a residue of either Asp or Hyp is present at that position. Con-Pr1 and -Pr2 lack Arg and Gla residues at positions 13–14 or 14–15, whereas con-Pr2 has an N-terminal Asp rather than Gly. Furthermore, con-Pr3 is the first example of a conantokin containing three different post-translational modifications: γ-carboxyglutamate, 4-trans-hydroxyproline, and C-terminal amidation (Table 1). Because all conantokin peptides target NMDA receptors, the biochemical characteristics required for their functionality have been further elucidated by this work. Conantokins are known for Ca2+- and Mg2+-induced conformational changes, where the divalent cations produce α-helical conformations from relatively unstructured peptides (24Prorok M. Castellino F.J. Curr. Drug Targets. 2001; 2: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 25Prorok M. Castellino F.J. Curr. Drug Targets. 2007; 8: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The α-helical content of con-Pr1 and -Pr2 increased substantially in the presence of physiologically relevant concentrations of divalent cations, similar to con-G (Fig. 3) (22Chen Z. Blandl T. Prorok M. Warder S.E. Li L. Zhu Y. Pedersen L.G. Ni F. Castellino F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16248-16258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, con-Pr3 is predominantly α-helical even in the absence of divalent cations (Fig. 3), similar to con-T (23Prorok M. Warder S.E. Blandl T. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16528-16534Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Con-G adopts an α-helical conformation along the entire length of the peptide in the presence of Mg2+ because the side chains of the Gla residues coordinate the divalent cations approximately along one face of the α-helix. Substituting a different amino acid for any Gla residue decreased the α-helical content of con-G (22Chen Z. Blandl T. Prorok M. Warder S.E. Li L. Zhu Y. Pedersen L.G. Ni F. Castellino F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16248-16258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Because con-G contains five Gla residues, whereas con-Pr1 and -Pr2 only have three Gla residues, the α-helical content of con-Pr1 and -Pr2 is less than the α-helical content of con-G in the presence of Mg2+ (Fig. 3). The fact that con-Pr3 and con-T are substantially α-helical in the absence of divalent cations may be accounted for by the presence of a Lys residue at the 7th position from the N terminus, whereas con-G, -Pr1, and -Pr2 have a Gla residue at that position (Table 1). We hypothesize that the positively charged side chain of Lys stabilizes the α-helical conformation through favorable electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged side chains of Gla residues that align along the same face of the α-helix, most likely at positions 4 and 10 from the N terminus, significantly reducing the requirement of divalent cations for stabilizing the α-helical conformation. This hypothesis was previously suggested for con-T by other researchers who demonstrated that when Lys at position 7 was replaced by Gla, the peptide had low α-helical content in the absence of divalent cations. They proposed that Gla destabilizes the α-helix in the absence of divalent cations through electrostatic repulsion of the other negatively charged Gla side chains that would align with Gla at position 7 in an α-helical conformation (26Blandl T. Warder S.E. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. J. Pept. Res. 1999; 53: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Con-R also contains a Lys residue at the 7th position from the N terminus (Table 1). However, its structural relationship to the other conantokins is unique because it contains a disulfide bond near the C terminus. Although native con-R was estimated to be less than 35% α-helical, even in the presence of divalent cations, several C-terminal truncations of con-R increased the α-helical content of con-R in both the absence and presence of divalent cations. Some of the C-terminal truncations were estimated to be substantially α-helical in the absence of divalent cations, e.g. 45% α-helix for con-R residues 1–14 (27Blandl T. Zajicek J. Prorok M. Castellino F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7391-7396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that the Lys residue at position 7 stabilizes the α-helical conformation in conantokins that lack a disulfide bond in the absence of divalent cations. There are no structural data available for con-L, which also contains Lys at position 7. Although con-T was found to be substantially α-helical in the absence of divalent cations (∼50%), the presence of divalent cations increased the estimated α-helical content (∼80%) (23Prorok M. Warder S.E. Blandl T. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16528-16534Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 24Prorok M. Castellino F.J. Curr. Drug Targets. 2001; 2: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 25Prorok M. Castellino F.J. Curr. Drug Targets. 2007; 8: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is particularly surprising that con-Pr3 appears to be ∼60% α-helical in both the presence and absence of divalent cations (Fig. 3). One possible explanation for this apparent difference between peptides is the presence of Hyp at the 3rd position from the N terminus in con-Pr3, which may further stabilize the α-helical conformation in the absence of divalent cations, in conjunction with Lys at position 7. Despite structural differences, the C. parius peptides are functionally similar to other conantokins, particularly con-G. Like con-G, all of the C. parius conantokins induce sleep in young mice and hyperactivity in older mice. Furthermore, they all inhibit NMDA receptors that contain an NR2B subunit with highest efficacy. In our hands, con-Pr3 exhibited selectivity for NR2B that is similar in magnitude to the selectivity of con-G. All of the C. parius conantokins, as well as con-G, appear to be specific for NMDA receptors, as they did not affect activity of other ligand-gated ion channels. Con-Pr2 exhibited greater inhibition of NR2D, relative to NR2B, than previously characterized conantokins, as shown in Table 4. Although the basis for this lack of selectivity between NR2B and NR2D is unknown, there are several possibilities that may be explored in future studies. For example, con-Pr2 is the only known conantokin to contain Asp at the N terminus, which may play a role in the relatively higher potency for NR2D. However, con-Pr1 also appears to discriminate less between NR2B and NR2D than either con-Pr3 or con-G (Table 4). Among other similarities between con-Pr1 and -Pr2 (not shared by con-Pr3 or -G), they contain a Tyr at position 5 from the N terminus, which may also play a role in potency for NR2D relative to NR2B. For the five peptides shown in Table 4, all peptides have a bias for NR2B. However, con-R is a more potent antagonist of NR2A than NR2D, as determined previously (15White H.S. McCabe R.T.

In contrast, the C. parius conantokins and con-G are more potent antagonists of NR2D than NR2A, as shown in Fig. 5 and Table 4. Cumulatively, these data provide a concrete basis for exploring the structural features in conantokin peptides that determine relative potency of block for NR2A versus NR2D. The emerging structural diversity of conantokins is likely to reveal more functional diversity among conantokin peptides. Clearly, the characterization of more native conantokin peptides should reveal additional structural determinants that are important for selectivity between NMDA receptor subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W2030131290,"Zinc and copper are atypical modulators of ligand-gated ionic channels in the central nervous system. We sought to identify the amino acids of the rat P2X4 receptor involved in trace metal interaction, specifically in the immediate linear vicinity of His140, a residue previously identified as being critical for copper-induced inhibition of the ATP-evoked currents. Site-directed mutagenesis replaced conspicuous amino acids located within the extracellular domain region between Thr123 and Thr146 for alanines. cDNAs for the wild-type and the receptor mutants were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and examined by the two-electrode technique. Cys132, but not Cys126, proved crucial for zinc-induced potentiation of the receptor activity, but not for copper-induced inhibition. Zinc inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner the ATP-gated currents of the C132A mutant. Likewise, Asp138, but not Asp131 was critical for copper and zinc inhibition; moreover, mutant D138A was 20-fold more reactive to zinc potentiation than wild-type receptors. Asp129, Asp131, and Thr133 had minor roles in metal modulation. We conclude that this region of the P2X4 receptor has a pocket for trace metal coordination with two distinct and separate facilitator and inhibitor metal allosteric sites. In addition, Cys132 does not seem to participate exclusively as a structural receptor channel folding motif but plays a role as a ligand for zinc modulation highlighting the role of trace metals in neuronal excitability.

Extracellular ATP and structurally related nucleotides act as novel cell messengers through the activation of P2X receptors, which belong to the family of ligand-gated ionic channels. In addition, nucleotides, and particularly pyrimidine nucleotides, such as UTP and UDP, act on metabotropic P2Y receptors, members of the G protein-coupled receptor family. Seven subtypes of P2X channels have been identified and have been shown to be involved in a variety of neuronal pathways including pain transmission, the urination reflex, vas deferens contraction favoring sperm migration, etc. (1Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). These receptors are unique among ligand-gated ionic channels because each receptor subunit has only two transmembrane domains, with both the C and N termini facing the cytosol (2Vial C. Roberts J.A.

The role of divalent trace metals as neuromodulators is of interest as zinc and copper are both novel and atypical brain transmitters (18Barañano D.E. Ferris C.D. Snyder S.H.

Yamashita S. Tokunaga M. Nishida K. Hirano T. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The notion that zinc and copper are stored in neurons and are released upon electrical depolarization further highlights their importance in brain excitability with ample physiological and pharmacological implications (21Assaf S. Chung S.H. Nature. 1984; 208: 734-736Crossref Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 22Kardos J. Kovacs I. Hajos F. Kalman M. Simonyi M. Neurosci. Lett. 1989; 103: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The P2X4 receptor is an interesting model of an ionic channel differentially modulated by divalent trace metals. In a series of studies, Acuña-Castillo et al. (16Acuña-Castillo C. Morales B. Huidobro-Toro J.P. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1529-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and Coddou et al.

Huidobro-Toro J.P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 472: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) reported that zinc potentiated the ATP-evoked currents, whereas copper exerts an inhibitory effect on the activity of this receptor. Furthermore, single site-directed mutagenesis of each of the three extracellular histidine residues of the P2X4 receptor revealed that only histidine 140 plays a key role in the inhibitory modulation by copper and high zinc concentrations (13Coddou C. Morales B. González J. Grauso M. Gordillo F. Bull P. Rassendren F. Huidobro-Toro J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36777-36785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The replacement of His140 by an alanine (H140A mutant) was not only resistant to the copper-induced inhibition of the ATP-gated receptor activity but evidenced a dramatic increase in the zinc-induced potentiation. Zinc potentiated more than 20-fold the ATP-evoked currents in the H140A mutant; the metal evidenced in this mutant a sigmoid concentration-response dependence instead of the bell-shaped zinc curve described in the wild-type receptor. This finding brought forth the hypothesis that the P2X4 receptor channel must have a separate and distinct trace metal binding site to account for the facilitator action of zinc. The present research aimed at identifying structural determinants for the binding of zinc and to further assess the hypothesis that zinc and copper modulate the P2X4 receptor by interacting with separate and apparently independent metal binding sites. For this purpose, we mutated several amino acids in the vicinity of His140 and identified residues in the ectodomain of the P2X4 receptor that participate in the facilitator and inhibitor allosteric trace metal sites. We demonstrate that Cys132, but not Cys126, is critical for the modulator role of zinc but not copper, identifying the first critical amino acid residue necessary for zinc potentiation in this receptor channel. The C132A mutant proved not only resistant to the zinc-induced potentiation, but this metal inhibited ATP-gated currents, in full support that large zinc concentrations may also interact with the copper inhibitory site (13Coddou C. Morales B. González J. Grauso M. Gordillo F. Bull P. Rassendren F. Huidobro-Toro J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36777-36785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, we determined the key role of the carboxylic acid group of Asp138 as a second residue critically involved in copper inhibition, establishing a possible metal coordination binding pocket in the extracellular receptor domain region surrounding His140. The finding that the sulfhydryl group of Cys132 is critical for the modulator action of zinc suggests that this residue does not form a disulfide bridge with other cysteines as has been suggested for other P2X subtypes. In our view, Cys132 plays a relevant role in zinc modulation, and contributes to the molecular basis of trace metal modulation of the P2X4 receptor channel.

The double mutants T123A/T146A and S124A/T146A were generated in two steps with the same primers used for individual mutations. The triple mutant T123A/S124A/T146A was generated in two steps: first the T123A/S124A double mutant was generated using a single primer (5′-GTCCAGAGATTCCTGATAAGGCCGCCATTTGTAA-3′), then the T146A mutation was generated with their respective primers. To circumvent unwanted mutations, a region surrounding the targeted amino acid and presenting unique restriction sites was subcloned in the parental cDNA; the exact synthesis of each mutation was verified by automated sequencing. Oocyte Harvesting, Microinjection, ATP Receptor Expression, and Quantification of ATP-evoked Currents—A segment of the ovary was surgically removed under anesthesia from the frog, Xenopus laevis. Oocytes were manually defolliculated and incubated with collagenase as previously detailed by Acuña-Castillo et al. (16Acuña-Castillo C. Morales B. Huidobro-Toro J.P. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1529-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected intranuclearly with 3–5 ng of cDNA coding for the rat P2X4 wild-type and mutated receptors. After a 36–48 h incubation in Barth's solution (NaCl, 88 mm; KCl, 1 mm; NaHCO3, 2.4 mm; HEPES, 10 mm; MgSO4, 0.82 mm; Ca(NO3)2, 0.33 mm; CaCl2, 0.91 mm; pH 7.5) supplemented with 10 international units/liter penicillin/10 mg streptomycin and 2 mm pyruvate, oocytes were clamped at –70 mV using the two-electrode voltage-clamp configuration with an OC-725C clamper (Warner Instruments Corp., Hamden, CT). ATP-gated currents were recorded following regular 10-s ATP applications repeated every 10 min for up to 10 μm ATP; for higher ATP concentrations, the pulses were spaced out to 25 min to avoid receptor desensitization. After metal incubation the recovery of control currents was always assessed. Non-injected oocytes did not evoke currents when exogenous ATP was applied (16Acuña-Castillo C. Morales B. Huidobro-Toro J.P. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1529-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). ATP, metal chloride salts, and amino acids were dissolved in Barth's media and perfused using a pump operating at a constant flow of 2 ml/min. ATP concentration-response curves were performed by applying for 10 s, increasing concentrations of the nucleotide ranging between 1 and 1000 μm. Curves were normalized against the concentration of ATP that evoked the maximal response. For metal modulation experiments, at least 5 control ATP applications were performed; the average of all the control currents was used as the standard response (100%). This procedure allowed us to determine the variation between the control responses, which never exceeded 10%. The ATP median effective concentration (EC50) was interpolated from each concentration-response curve. Likewise, the maximal ATP current (Imax) was obtained from each ATP concentration-response curve. Each protocol was performed in at least two separate batches of oocytes from different frogs; each experiment was repeated at least in four separate oocytes. Special care was taken to complete each protocol in a single oocyte; with incomplete protocols being discarded, to favor correct statistical analysis. ATP and metals solutions were prepared daily before usage. Metal Characterization Protocols—These protocols describe the general outline of the experiments performed in wild-type and mutant receptors. Care was exercised to run the whole protocol in a single oocyte allowing each oocyte as its own internal control, particularly when concentration-response curves were performed. Metal Selectivity—We examined the modulator role of copper and zinc chloride salts on the ATP-gated currents of the P2X4 wild-type and mutant receptors. Reversal of the metal effect was mandatory prior to testing other metal concentrations, or examining the effect of another metal in the same oocyte. The recovery of the ATP-evoked currents following additions of the metals was controlled in all cases by the sequential application of ATP challenges until the full original current was attained. Metal and Ligand Concentration Studies—The metal concentration dependence was assessed by quantifying the ATP-gated currents in the absence and later in the presence of 0.1–300 μm copper and zinc. In these assays, each oocyte served as its own control; reversal of the metal action was carefully controlled as mentioned above. To examine the action of zinc, experiments used a concentration of the nucleotide that elicits only a 5% of the maximal ATP response (EC5), because this protocol favored the facilitator action of the metal (16Acuña-Castillo C. Morales B. Huidobro-Toro J.P. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1529-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For example, the ATP EC5 for the wild-type P2X4 receptor is 1 μm while for the C132A and D138A mutants this value is 3 μm. To assess the copper-induced inhibition, these protocols were systematically performed using the EC50 for each receptor (see Table 1). These ATP concentrations were established previously as optimal to test the effect of each metal (16Acuña-Castillo C. Morales B. Huidobro-Toro J.P. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1529-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).TABLE 1EC50, nH and Imax values for wild-type and mutated P2X4 receptors expressed in X. laevis oocytesReceptorEC50nHImaxμmμAP2X4 wild-type11.4 ± 2.8 (12)1.4 ± 0.24.9 ± 0.8 (18)T123A22.3 ± 6.4 (8)1.2 ± 0.13.3 ± 0.6 (12)S124A24.6 ± 4.8 (5)1.0 ± 0.23.3 ± 0.7 (10)C126A15.4 ± 4.6 (6)1.9 ± 0.29.0 ± 2.8 (8)D129A33.3 ± 8.6 (6)ap < 0.05, compared with the values obtained with the wild-type P2X4 receptor.1.4 ± 0.23.4 ± 0.9 (8)D131A17.5 ± 6.4 (6)1.2 ± 0.16.4 ± 1.7 (9)C132A36.1 ± 13.2 (6)1.3 ± 0.23.4 ± 1.4 (6)T133A13.3 ± 3.7 (4)0.9 ± 0.44.1 ± 1.3 (7)D138A36.8 ± 6.5 (5)bp < 0.01, compared with the values obtained with the wild-type P2X4 receptor.0.9 ± 0.16.2 ± 1.8 (9)D138N19.1 ± 8.7 (5)1.1 ± 0.35.6 ± 2.2 (2)H140A61.2 ± 9.5 (8)bp < 0.01, compared with the values obtained with the wild-type P2X4 receptor.1.4 ± 0.24.3 ± 0.6 (11)T146A29.0 ± 7.0 (5)1.7 ± 0.62.8 ± 1.1 (6)T123/T14613.7 ± 2.3 (4)1.4 ± 0.34.7 ± 0.8 (6)S124/T14619.2 ± 13.2 (3)0.8 ± 0.42.7 ± 1.0 (5)T123A/S124A/T146A24.6 ± 4.1 (4)0.9 ± 0.24.5 ± 0.9 (7)a p < 0.05, compared with the values obtained with the wild-type P2X4 receptor.b p < 0.01, compared with the values obtained with the wild-type P2X4 receptor. Open table in a new tab To investigate how copper or zinc modified the ATP concentration-response curve, ATP concentration-response curves were performed in the absence, and later, in the presence of either 10 μm copper or 10 μm zinc. For these protocols, the metals were pre-applied for 1-min and next co-applied with ATP. Sets of at least 4–6 oocytes from separate batches were studied; complete ATP concentration-response protocols were performed per oocyte. MTSET Studies—Consistent with the role of free thiol groups in the extracellular receptor domain, we used a non-permeable SH reactive agent to chemically modify SH groups in the external surface of the receptor domain. Trimethyl ammoniummethylmethane thiosulfonate (MTSET) was used as a prototype alkylthiosulfonate, an agent that covalently alkylates free thiol groups of cysteine residues. Oocytes were treated with 1 mm MTSET, applied for 3-min period. The effect of zinc, copper, and ivermectin were tested before and after the application of MTSET, in the same oocyte. These protocols were repeated in 4–5 different oocytes from separate oocyte batches. Statistical Data Analysis—Curve fitting was performed with GraphPad software (San Diego, CA). ATP and zinc EC50 values, ATP Hill coefficient (nH), copper median inhibitory concentration (IC50), and the Imax were obtained from each concentration-response curve; values were derived after adjusting experimental values to a sigmoid curve generated using Graph Pad software (San Diego, CA). Statistical studies included the Mann-Whitney test; we had previously determined the convenience of non-parametric analysis procedures in our statistical evaluations (16Acuña-Castillo C. Morales B. Huidobro-Toro J.P. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1529-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis of Critical Amino Acid Residues in the Thr123-Thr146 Region of the P2X4 Receptor—To examine the role of key amino acid residues in the vicinity of His140, an amino acid previously identified to play a critical role in copper-induced modulation (13Coddou C. Morales B. González J. Grauso M. Gordillo F. Bull P. Rassendren F. Huidobro-Toro J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36777-36785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we systematically mutated for alanines selected amino acids localized in the Thr123-Thr146 region (Fig. 1A). As candidates for mutagenesis we choose the following amino acids: aspartic acids, Asp129, Asp131, and Asp138, commonly described in protein metal-binding motifs and two cysteines, Cys126 and Cys132, which through their sulfhydryl groups could interact as metals ligands (25Aitken A. Mol. Biotechnol. 1999; 12: 241-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), particularly zinc. In addition, we also mutated 3 threonines and a serine; based on a theoretical computational model developed by P. Bull. All these P2X4 receptor mutants were functional; their half-maximal ATP potency (EC50) and maximal ATP-gated currents (Imax) were, within experimental error, similar to the wild-type P2X4 receptor. Table 1 summarizes the main parameters examined in the single mutants tested, along with several double mutations and a triple mutant. Modulator Effect of Zinc and Copper in Wild-type and the Receptor Mutants—Each mutant was examined independently to evaluate the modulatory activity of 10 μm zinc and 10 μm copper; a summary of these results is shown in Fig. 1, B and C. Zinc-induced potentiation was completely abolished in the mutant C132A, demonstrating the critical role of this residue for the modulator action of zinc but not copper. The zinc potentiation was also significantly reduced, although not abolished, in the mutant T133A (Fig. 1B, p < 0.01). Additionally, the modulator activity of 10 μm zinc was almost 2-fold larger in mutants D131A and D138A, mimicking the observation previously reported for the H140A mutant (Fig. 1B). In the rest of the mutants examined, the modulator action of zinc was within the experimental variation, not manifesting statistical differences to the wild-type receptor. With regard to the modulator activity of copper, mutant D138A was resistant to the 10 μm copper-induced inhibition of the ATP-gated currents; as indicated above, the modulator action of zinc was significantly augmented 2-fold (Fig. 1B). Mutant D129A demonstrated a significant 50% reduction in copper-induced inhibition (p < 0.05, Fig. 1C), while the modulator activity of zinc was conserved (Fig. 1B). The other mutants examined did not evidence significant deviations from the wild-type phenotype. The C132A Mutant—In view of the novelty of the results derived from the C132A mutant, and to further confirm and study the nature of its resistance to zinc, we investigated in further detail the interaction of this receptor mutant with trace metals. The zinc concentration-response curve in C132A was dramatically modified from a biphasic curve in the wild-type receptor phenotype (Fig. 2B), to a flat curve with negative slope and an estimated IC50 of 18.2 ± 10.1 μm, demonstrating the inhibitory action of zinc. Representative recordings shown in Fig. 2A evidence the zinc-induced reversible inhibition of the ATP-gated currents in oocytes expressing C132A mutant instead of the potentiation observed in the wild-type receptor. A 1-min pre-application of 10 μm zinc in the C132A mutant inhibited the 3 μm ATP-evoked currents; the inhibitor action of zinc was concentration-dependent (Fig. 2B). In further proof of the two independent sites of metal action in the P2X4 receptor, the C132A mutant showed a copper inhibition curve identical to the wild-type phenotype (Fig. 2C). Consonant with these results, 10 μm zinc did not modify the ATP concentration-response curve, while 10 μm copper inhibited non-competitively the ATP curve, much as in the wild-type receptors (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, the C126A mutant showed a wild-type phenotype to the modulation by zinc, evidencing the classical biphasic zinc interaction curve (Fig. 2B) or the non-competitive copper-induced inhibition (data not shown). Taken together, these results allow the conclusion that Cys132 is critical for zinc-induced potentiation, but not for copper inhibition. Based on the notion that Cys132 is part of the zinc-facilitator site, we reasoned that the facilitator action of zinc would be eliminated, at least in part, by reagents such as MTSET, which alkylate free sulfhydryl groups. Oocyte treatment with MTSET halved significantly the maximal zinc-induced potentiation from 5.9 ± 0.4- to 3.1 ± 0.2-fold (p < 0.01) in wild-type P2X4 receptors without altering the magnitude of the ATP-evoked currents (Fig. 3A). The ATP EC50 and maximal response after MTSET-treatment were 19.8 ± 4.0 μm and 6.4 ± 1.9 μA respectively (n = 5, data not shown). MTSET treatment was irreversible; 45 min after the treatment we consistently observed the reduction of the zinc-induced potentiation. As a further control for this set of experiments, MTSET treatment did not modify the ivermectin-induced potentiation (Fig. 3B) or copper inhibition (Fig. 3C). 3 μm IVM potentiated 3.7 ± 0.6, indicating that this agent has a smaller potentiation than that of zinc. After MTSET treatment, the IVM potentiation was 4.4 ± 1.4-fold, a value that did not differ from the non-treated oocytes. These results indicate that the chemical modification of the sulfhydryl of extracellular cysteines affected exclusively the zinc-induced modulation, but not the copper-induced modulation. The D138A Mutant—This mutant was copper-resistant, no significant inhibition was observed with metal concentrations up to 100 μm (Fig. 4B); in contrast, 10 μm copper elicited 75% current inhibition in the wild-type receptors. Further increasing the copper concentration to 300 μm, inhibited the currents ∼40%. Representative tracings illustrate the inhibitory modulation of 10 μm copper in oocytes transfected with either wild-type or the Asp138 mutant (Fig. 4A). Consonant with the finding reported for the H140A mutant (13Coddou C. Morales B. González J. Grauso M. Gordillo F. Bull P. Rassendren F. Huidobro-Toro J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36777-36785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which was also shown to be resistant to the action of copper, the zinc concentration-response curve was dramatically modified from a biphasic curve in wild-type receptors, to a sigmoid, in the D138A mutant (Fig. 4C). The maximal zinc-evoked potentiation in the mutant was at least 3-fold larger than in wild-type receptors (19.0 ± 2.1-versus 6.3 ± 0.7-fold increase, p < 0.01, n = 6). Moreover, when the ATP concentration-response curve was examined in the presence of 10 μm copper, the curve"

However, knowledge on the functionality and localization of many of these enzymes is not available. In this study, we demonstrate that porphobilinogen deaminase encoded by the Plasmodium falciparum genome (PfPBGD) has several unique biochemical properties. Studies carried out with PfPBGD partially purified from parasite membrane fraction, as well as recombinant PfPBGD lacking N-terminal 64 amino acids expressed and purified from Escherichia coli cells (ΔPfPBGD), indicate that both the proteins are catalytically active. Surprisingly, PfPBGD catalyzes the conversion of porphobilinogen to uroporphyrinogen III (UROGEN III), indicating that it also possesses uroporphyrinogen III synthase (UROS) activity, catalyzing the next step. This obviates the necessity to have a separate gene for UROS that has not been so far annotated in the parasite genome. Interestingly, ΔPfP-BGD gives rise to UROGEN III even after heat treatment, although UROS from other sources is known to be heat-sensitive. Based on the analysis of active site residues, a ΔPfPBGDL116K mutant enzyme was created and the specific activity of this recombinant mutant enzyme is 5-fold higher than ΔPfPBGD. More interestingly, ΔPfPBGDL116K catalyzes the formation of uroporphyrinogen I (UROGEN I) in addition to UROGEN III, indicating that with increased PBGD activity the UROS activity of PBGD may perhaps become rate-limiting, thus leading to non-enzymatic cyclization of preuroporphyrinogen to UROGEN I. PfPBGD is localized to the apicoplast and is catalytically very inefficient compared with the host red cell enzyme.

PfPBGD is localized to the apicoplast and is catalytically very inefficient compared with the host red cell enzyme. Detailed studies of the metabolic pathways in the malarial parasite hold promise for the identification of new antimalarial drug targets (1Fidock D.A. Rosenthal P.J. Croft S.L. Brun R. Nwaka S. Nat.

Earlier studies in this laboratory had shown that the malarial parasite synthesizes heme de novo, despite acquiring heme from the host red cell hemoglobin in the intraerythrocytic stage. It has been shown that Plasmodium falciparum contains δ-aminolevulinate dehydratase (ALAD) 2The abbreviations used are:ALADδ-aminolevulinate dehydrataseALASδ-aminolevulinate synthasePBGDporphobilinogen deaminaseUROSuroporphyrinogen III synthaseFCferrochelataseUROGENuroporphyrinogenUROuroporphyrinΔPfPBGDrecombinant parasite genome-coded PBGD lacking N-terminal 64 amino acidsPBSphosphate-buffered salineGFPgreen fluorescent protein of dual origin: one species encoded by the parasite genome (PfALAD) and another imported from the host red cell. Inhibition of ALAD activity in the parasite, the second enzyme of the pathway with a specific inhibitor, succinylacetone, leads to inhibition of heme synthesis and death of the parasite, indicating the potential of the pathway as a drug target (3Surolia N.

Nature. 2002; 419: 498-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (3453) Google Scholar). However, a hemD orthologue has been identified in Toxoplasma gondii and is expected to be targeted to the apicoplast, a chloroplast-like organelle in the parasite (6Ralph S.A. van Dooren G.G.

Based mostly on bioinformatics-based predictions, some experimental data and hypothesis, a hybrid model for heme biosynthesis has been proposed. The model involves shuttling of intermediates of the pathway between mitochondria, apicoplast, and cytoplasm and the localization of the Pf enzymes in the different compartments (6Ralph S.A. van Dooren G.G.

However, experimental evidence for the functionality of the Pf enzymes in the parasite, and their actual site of localization is available only in a few cases. Sato and Wilson (10Sato S. Wilson R.J. Curr. Genet. 2002; 40: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) have shown that PfALAD is functional. Sato et al. (7Sato S. Clough B. Coates L. Wilson R.J. Protist. 2004; 155: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) have also shown that PfALA synthase (ALAS) and PfALAD are targeted to the mitochondrion and apicoplast, respectively, based on transfection studies in P. falciparum cultures involving GFP fusion constructs. Studies in this laboratory have shown that PfALAS is active and the native enzyme is localized to the parasite mitochondrion (11Varadharajan S. Dhanasekaran S. Bonday Z.Q. Rangarajan P.N. Padmanaban G. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). PfALAD and Pf ferrochelatase (PfFC) are also functional, and the native enzymes are localized to the apicoplast (12Dhanasekaran S. Chandra N.R. Sagar B.K.C. Rangarajan P.N. Padmanaban G. J. Biol.

Rev. 2006; 30: 596-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) that in PfFC-GFP fusion gene-transfected parasites, the protein is targeted to the mitochondrion. In the light of the dual origin of the enzymes of the heme-biosynthetic pathway in the parasite (12Dhanasekaran S. Chandra N.R. Sagar B.K.C. Rangarajan P.N. Padmanaban G. J. Biol.

Med. 2000; 6: 898-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), it is of importance to establish the functionality of the Pf enzymes. A difficulty has been to express adequate quantities of recombinant Pf enzymes, perhaps due to the hydrophobic N-terminal targeting sequence, AT-rich codon bias and recovery of recombinant proteins from the inclusion bodies. This laboratory has been able to overcome these limitations by expressing the truncated proteins without the hydrophobic targeting sequence, using E. coli Rosetta strain 2(DE3)pLysS that has seven tRNAs for rare codons permitting universal translation and working out the optimal conditions for expressing the recombinant proteins in the cytosol. In the present study, the unique features of parasite genome-coded porphobilinogen deaminase (PfPBGD) are described. Surprisingly, the recombinant enzyme lacking the N-terminal hydrophobic sequence (ΔPfPBGD) is able to catalyze the formation of UROGEN III, even after heat treatment, rather than UROGEN I that is derived from pre-uroporphyrinogen in the absence of UROS, thus obviating the necessity for a separate PfUROS. All the properties of the recombinant enzyme including formation of UROGEN III, are also shown by the native enzyme in the parasite. Sato et al. (7Sato S. Clough B. Coates L. Wilson R.J. Protist. 2004; 155: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) have shown that the N-terminal sequence of PfPBGD directs the reporter GFP to the apicoplast in fusion gene-transfected parasites. The present study reveals that the native PfPBGD is indeed localized to the apicoplast. The enzyme is catalytically very inefficient, when compared with the host red cell enzyme. Parasite Maintenance and Isolation—P. falciparum culture was maintained on human O+ red cells at 5% hematocrit in RPMI 1640 with glutamine (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% O+ human serum by the candle jar method (15Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). Cultures were synchronized by sorbitol treatment (16Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2839) Google Scholar), and the parasites usually at the trophozoite stage were isolated by treatment with equal volumes of 0.15% (w/v) saponin (17Fitch C.D. Chevli R. Banyal H. Phillips G. Pfaller M.A. Krogstad D.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1982; 21: 819-822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The released parasites were pelleted down and washed four times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The final wash was free of detectable hemoglobin. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of ΔPfPBGD cDNA—The full-length PfPBGD could not be expressed in E. coli Rosetta2(DE3)pLysS strain, but it was possible to express PfP-BGD lacking 64 N-terminal amino acids (ΔPfPBGD). Again, the protein expressed using pRSETA plasmid (Invitrogen) did not bind to the Ni2+-NTA column under non-denaturing conditions, but the species expressed with C-terminal histidine tag using pET-20b(+) plasmid (Invitrogen) bound to Ni2+-NTA column and could be purified. The 1.1-kb cDNA (Fig. 1A) obtained using the primers, 5′-GACCGGATCCGGGAACTCGTGATTCTCCG-3′ and 5′-ACCCTCGAGTTATTTATTATTTAAAAGGTGCAATTCAGCCT-3′, based on the nucleotide sequence of putative PfPBGD gene sequence (PFL0480W) described in PlasmoDB data base, was sequenced (ABI prism, 310 Genetic Analyzer) to confirm in-frame alignment of the cloned cDNA with the vector-encoded His tag as well as for the absence of PCR-based mutations. Recombinant plasmids were transformed into E. coli Rosetta2(DE3)pLysS strain (Novagen), and cells were grown to an A600 of 1.0 at 30 °C in a rotary shaker. The cells were then grown at 18 °C for 30 min, and protein expression was induced with 1 mm 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 13 h at 18 °C. The recombinant protein was recovered in both soluble (20–30%) and membrane (70–80%) fractions. The soluble enzyme with C-terminal histidine tag was purified by Ni2+-NTA chromatography under non-denaturing conditions. Briefly, E. coli cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant was applied to a column packed with Ni2+-NTA resin in the presence of 15 mm imidazole. The column was then washed sequentially with the lysis buffer containing 30, 50, and 75 mm imidazole and finally the ΔPfPBGD protein was eluted from the column with lysis buffer containing 300 mm imidazole and 1% Triton X-100 (Fig. 1B). Following dialysis against lysis buffer, the purified protein was stored at 4 °C up to one month. Host PBGD was partially purified from human erythrocytes using DEAE-cellulose and Q Sepharose as described (18Smythe E. Williams D.C. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 19Lannfelt L. Wetterberg L. Lilius L. Thunnel S. Jornvall H. Pavlu B. Wielburski A. Gellerfors P. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Investig. 1989; 49: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Generation of ΔPfPBGDL116K Mutant—Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out as described (20Weiner M.P. Costa G.L. Schoettlin W. Cline J. Mathur E. Bauer J.C. Gene. 1994; 151: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The following primer pair carrying the required mutations was used for PCR amplification of pET-20b(+) plasmid containing ΔPfPBGD cDNA to generate the plasmid containing ΔPfPBGDL116K cDNA: 5′-GT AAG AGT GTT GGA AAA TAT GGC GGG AAA GG-3′ and 5′-CC TTT CCC GCC ATA TTT TCC AAC ACT CTT AC-3′. The mutant codons are underlined. The PCR product obtained with Phusion High Fidelity Polymerase was treated with DpnI to digest the methylated parental DNA strand, transformed into E. coli DH5α strain and ampicillin-resistant colonies were isolated. The plasmid containing ΔPfPBGDL116K cDNA was isolated, and the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression and purification of ΔPfPBGDL116K mutant protein from E. coli Rosetta2(DE3)pLysS was carried out essentially as described above. Enzyme Assay—PfPBGD was assayed essentially as described by Jordan et. al (21Jordon P.M. Thomas S.D. Warren M.J. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) with 4 mm porphobilinogen (Sigma) in a final volume of 50 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5 containing 40 mm KCl, 0.8% Triton, 8% glycerol, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Incubation was carried out at 37 °C and higher temperatures for different periods of time. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 30 μl of 5 n HCl and porphyrinogens were oxidized to porphyrins by exposure to light for 20 min. The absorbance was measured at 405 nm against buffer blank (Emm = 548 m-1 cm-1). An enzyme-omitted control was included in all the assays. Host PBGD assay was carried out at pH 8.2 with 2 mm porphobilinogen under the same conditions. HPLC Analysis for Product Characterization—HPLC analysis was carried out essentially as described by Lim et al. (22Lim C.K. Rideout J.M. Wright D.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) with Waters HPLC system (model 515, with dual absorbance detector). Briefly, 25 μl of the assay mixture was loaded onto a C18 Sun Fire column (5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm). The solvent system consisted of acetonitrile and 1 m ammonium acetate buffer, pH 5.16. A 15-min linear gradient elution with 13% (v/v) acetonitrile to 30% acetonitrile in ammonium acetate buffer followed by an isocratic elution at 30% acetonitrile for further 15 min was used. Standard uroporphyrin I (URO I) and III (URO III) (Frontier Scientific) were used to spike the reaction products to enable characterization of the isomer (Supplemental Fig. S1A). Identification of Dipyrromethane Cofactor—Purified ΔPfPBGD was treated with modified Ehrlich reagent (1 g of p-dimethylamino benzaldehyde in 8 ml of 70% perchloric acid + 42 ml of glacial acetic acid), and the spectrum was recorded at different intervals. The presence of dipyrromethane in the enzyme is indicated by the formation of a purple color with an absorption maximum around 555 nm within 5 min, with the color fading to an orange-yellow color in about 20 min, with a new absorption maximum around 495 nm (23Jordan P.M. Warren M.J. FEBS Lett. 1987; 225: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Preparation of Parasite Membrane Fraction—PBGD enzyme activity was also assayed in parasite membrane (total organellar) fraction prepared as described by Sharma et al. (24Sharma A. Biswas S. Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 42: 145-151PubMed Google Scholar). For this purpose, parasites were resuspended in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5) containing 250 mm sucrose and sonicated for 1 min at 30% amplitude with alternative cooling. This lysate was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant (cytosol) was removed. The pellet was solubilized in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol. The supernatant obtained after centrifugation at 15,000 × g was used as solubilized membrane fraction. Marker analysis of the parasite membrane and cytosol fractions was carried out as described by Varadharajan et al. (13Varadharajan S. Sagar B.K.C. Rangarajan P.N. Padmanaban G. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The solubilized membrane fraction was routinely heat-treated at 80 °C for 20 min before assaying for PfPBGD activity. Localization of PfPBGD—To study the localization of PfPBGD in P. falciparum the method described by Tonkin et al. (25Tonkin C.J. van Dooren G.G. Spurck T.P. Struck N.S. Good R.T. Handman E. Cowman A.F. Mc Fadden G.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 137: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) was followed. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against ΔPfPBGD in rabbit and IgG was purified using protein A Sepharose chromatography. The parasite-infected red blood cell pellet was washed thrice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (w/v) and 0.0075% glutaraldehyde (v/v) for 30 min. After washing with PBS, the fixed cells were permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 and treated with 0.1 mg/ml (PBS) sodium borohydride for 10 min. Blocking was carried out with 3% bovine serum albumin. Rabbit anti-ΔPfPBGD IgG and mouse anti-ΔPfALAD IgG or mouse anti-PfALAS IgG were used at 1:200 dilution and incubated for 2 h. FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were then added and incubated for 1 h at 1:200 dilution. Cells were then allowed to settle onto poly-l-lysine coated coverslips (Sigma) and mounted in 50% glycerol with 0.1 mg/ml of 1,4-diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane (DABCO, Sigma). Fluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems) was used and images were acquired at ×100 magnification using an oil immersion objective and Leica FW 4000 image acquisition software. Other Procedures—Western blot analysis of ΔPfPBGD and the parasite membrane fraction was carried out with purified IgG (1:1000 dilution) using standard procedures. Purification of ΔPfPBGD—The ΔPfPBGD lacking the 64 N-terminal amino acids of PfPBGD was expressed using pET-20b(+) plasmid and purified from E. coli lysate by Ni2+-NTA chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”). The purified protein appeared as a doublet on SDS gel (Fig. 1B, lane 6), and the faint upper 45-kDa band may be because of the presence of the uncleaved periplasmic localization signal. The doublet (45/43 kDa) reacted with monoclonal anti-histidine tag antibody as well as anti-ΔPfPBGD IgG (Fig. 1, C and D). This recombinant enzyme designated as ΔPfPBGD, and the host enzyme partially purified from red cells were used in all subsequent studies. Properties of ΔPfPBGD—Initial studies with recombinant enzyme purified using Ni2+-NTA column did not show any activity when incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, unlike the host enzyme. Because PBGDs are known to be heat stable (21Jordon P.M. Thomas S.D. Warren M.J. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 26Erlandsen E.J. Jorgensen P.E. Markussen S. Brock A. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Investig. 2000; 60: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), assays were carried out at higher temperatures when the enzyme activity could be detected. The optimum temperature for ΔPfPBGD was around 65 °C (Fig. 2A). The enzyme lost very little activity even when heated to 80 °C and then assayed at 37 °C (Fig. 2B). The enzyme gave a typical spectrum for the presence of dipyrromethane cofactor with Ehrlich reagent (Fig. 2C). In view of these results, assays were carried out for prolonged periods of time at 37 °C. The enzyme activity picked up after a lag of about 2 h and was linear up to 12 h (Fig. 3A). The host enzyme did not show a lag and reached saturation in about 4 h (Fig. 3D). In general, the specific activity of the host enzyme was 25–30-fold higher than that of the ΔPfPBGD. The pH optima of ΔPfPBGD and host PBGDs were found to be in the ranges 7.1–7.5 and 8.1–8.4, respectively (Fig. 3, B and E). There was substantial difference in the Km values for ΔPfPBGD (1.3 mm) and host enzyme (47.4 μm) (Fig. 3, C and F).FIGURE 3Properties of ΔPfPBGD and host red cell PBGD.

Burdon G. Nordlov H. Schneider M.M. Pryde L. Scott A.I. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Comm. 1979; : 204-205Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The UROS gene has not as yet been identified on the parasite genome, and this enzyme activity is essential for the normal functioning of the heme-biosynthetic pathway. Surprisingly, ΔPfPBGD was found to give rise to UROGEN III (URO III after oxidation). While spiking with standard URO III enhanced the peak height of the product, spiking with URO I gave a separate peak (Fig. 4, A–C). The standard method of PBGD purification involves heat inactivation of UROS, but interestingly, ΔPfPBGD gave UROGEN III even after heat treatment (Fig. 4, D–F). This unique property of the enzyme obviates the necessity to have a separate gene for UROS on the parasite genome. As expected, the host red cell enzyme after heat treatment gave rise to UROGEN I (URO I after oxidation) (Supplemental Fig. S1, B–D). Properties of PfPBGD from the Parasite—To carry out the enzyme assay for the parasite genome-coded PBGD in P. falciparum, the parasite pellet was fractionated into membrane and cytosol fractions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Western blot analysis was carried out with anti-ΔPfPBGD IgG. The results presented in Fig. 5, A and B indicate that a 43-kDa protein was detected only in the membrane fraction and not in the cytosol. The total membrane pellet was solubilized as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and PBGD enzyme assays were carried out after heat treatment. All the properties listed for the recombinant enzyme were also seen with the native enzyme in the parasite. The time course kinetics obtained was similar to that obtained with ΔPfPBGD (Fig. 5C). The Km was found to be 1.15 mm (Fig. 5D). Importantly, heat-treated membrane fraction gave UROGEN III as the end product (Fig. 5, E–G). The pH and temperature optima were similar to that of the recombinant enzyme (data not presented). To rule out the outside possibility of the presence of an independent heat-stable PfUROS in the parasite membrane extract and contribution of inadequately inactivated E. coli proteins as contaminants in the purified recombinant PfPBGD to UROS activity, the following control experiments were carried out: The parasite membrane extract was immunoprecipitated with anti-ΔPfPBGD IgG, and the supernatant was assayed for PBGD and UROS activities and neither activity could be detected. The supernatant was also added to partially purified host PBGD to look for UROS activity. The E. coli Rosetta strain, transformed with pET-20b(+) without PfPBGD-cDNA, was assayed for UROS activity after heat denaturation of the extract, as such and in the presence of host PBGD. In all these experiments only URO I was detected as the product of the reaction, and there was no evidence for the formation of URO III. These results rule out any extraneous contribution to the bifunctional character of PfPBGD (data not presented). Attempts to carry out complementation studies with E. coli hemD mutant (28Chartrand P. Tardif D. Sasarman A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 110: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) were not successful, because PfPBGD expression required the use of the Rosetta strain, and no detectable expression could be seen in the mutant strain used. Studies with ΔPfPBGD Mutant—A perusal of the amino acid sequence of PfPBGD (Fig. 6) reveals that it shares most of the essential amino acid residues established with PBGDs from different sources (29Lander M. Pitt A.R. Alefounder P.R. Bardy D. Abell C. Battersby A.R. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 30Jordan P.M. Woodcock S.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, it shares all the 8 arginines, the mutation of which leads to a decrease in activity. In particular, the parasite enzyme manifests the conserved motif VGTSSL followed by arginines 131 and 132 in E. coli. (It is IGTSSL followed by arginines 216 and 217 in the parasite.) It also shares other conserved residues such as Gln19(75), Phe62(123), Asp84(145), Leu159(244), and the active site Cys242(359), the numbers outside and inside the parenthesis indicating the positions in E. coli and parasite enzymes, respectively (31Louie G.V. Brownlie P.D. Lambert R. Cooper J.B. Blundell T.L. Wood S.P. Warren M.J. Woodcock S.C. Jordan P.H. Nature. 1992; 359: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In addition, PfPBGD shares the lysine 59 at an equivalent position, but instead of lysine 55 it has leucine 116. It has been shown that modification of one of the two conserved lysine residues leads to inactivation of PBGD in E. coli (32Miller A.D. Packman L.C. Hart G.J. Alefounder P.R. Abell C. Battersby A.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was of interest to examine the contribution of leucine 116 to the low activity of the parasite enzyme by changing the leucine back to lysine, as is seen in the E. coli enzyme. The results obtained with ΔPfPBGDL116K indicate that the mutant enzyme has at least 5-fold higher activity than ΔPfPBGD (Fig. 7A). More interestingly, the product profile now indicates a significant amount of URO I along with URO III (Fig. 7, B–D). Localization of PfPBGD in P. falciparum—Immunofluorescence studies were carried out to identify the localization of native PfPBGD using anti-ΔPfPBGD IgG. This laboratory has shown earlier that PfALAD is localized to the apicoplast (12Dhanasekaran S. Chandra N.R. Sagar B.K.C. Rangarajan P.N. Padmanaban G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6934-6942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and PfALAS is localized to the mitochondrion (11Varadharajan S. Dhanasekaran S. Bonday Z.Q. Rangarajan P.N. Padmanaban G. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The results presented in Fig. 8 indicate that PfPBGD colocalizes with PfALAD but not with PfALAS, establishing that the native enzyme is localized to the apicoplast in the parasite. In this study, the parasite genome-coded PBGD lacking the hydrophobic N-terminal 64 amino acids containing the presumptive signal and transit peptide targeting sequences was cloned, and the truncated protein (ΔPfPBGD) was overexpressed in E. coli, purified and biochemically characterized. The unique feature is the identification of UROGEN III as the end product, when this recombinant enzyme as well as the native enzyme present in parasite membrane fractions were assayed for porphobilinogen deaminase enzyme activity. Although, Ralph et al. (6Ralph S.A. van Dooren G.G. Waller R.F. Crawford M.J. Fraunholz M.J. Foth B.J. Tonkin C.J. Roos D.S. McFadden G.I. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) and Wilson (8Wilson R.J. Biol. Rev. 2005; 80: 129-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) have alluded to the possible presence of a candidate hemD gene (UROS) in P. falciparum, so far there has been no report on the expression of this gene or characterization of a separate UROS enzyme in the parasite. The present study indicates that PfPBGD also has UROS activity leading to the formation of UROGEN III. While information on an independent UROS gene and purification of the enzyme is available from different sources such as E. coli (33Alwan A.F. Mqbege B.I. Jordan P.M. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), yeast (34Amillet J.M. Labbe-Bois R. Yeast. 1995; 11: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and the human (35Tsai S.F. Bishop D.F. Desnick R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7049-7053Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) including its crystal structure (36Mathews M.A. Schubert H.L. Whitby F.G. Alexander K.J. Schadick K. Bergonia H.A. Phillips J.D. Hill C.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), there have been no reports on the enzyme or gene from algal and plant sources (37Beale S.I. Photosyn. Res. 1999; 60: 43-73Crossref Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been reported that in Leptospira interrogans hemC codes for a bifunctional PBGD/UROS enzyme (38Guegan R. Camadro J.M. Girons I.S. Picardeau M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Further studies are needed to examine whether PfPBGD has segmental homologies to both hemC/hemD genes, or the entire protein is required for the manifestation of both the activities as is the case in Leptospira. It is also interesting to note that PfPBGD manifests both the activities after heat treatment. It is known that in general while PBGD is heat stable, UROS is heat-sensitive, and heat treatment is included as a step in the purification of PBGD (21Jordon P.M. Thomas S.D. Warren M.J. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 26Erlandsen E.J. Jorgensen P.E. Markussen S. Brock A. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Investig. 2000; 60: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Another important feature of PfPBGD is its very low catalytic efficiency when compared with the host enzyme, as assessed using the recombinant enzyme. There is almost a 100-fold difference between the catalytic efficiencies of host PBGD and ΔPfPBGD, the kcat/Km (m-1 s-1) values being 5.43 and 0.0585, respectively. Although, PfPBGD has all the conserved arginines and other amino acid residues considered essential for the enzyme activity (29Lander M. Pitt A.R. Alefounder P.R. Bardy D. Abell C. Battersby A.R. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 30Jordan P.M. Woodcock S.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 31Louie G.V. Brownlie P.D. Lambert R. Cooper J.B. Blundell T.L. Wood S.P. Warren M.J. Woodcock S.C. Jordan P.H. Nature. 1992; 359: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), there could be other contributory regions, because the parasite enzyme has only around 40% homology with the host red cell enzyme. Studies with ΔPfPBGDL116K mutant enzyme indicate that a change from the native leucine to lysine present in other PBGDs leads to an increase in specific activity by 5-fold. More interestingly, a significant amount of UROGEN I is now seen along with UROGEN III as the product. This would indicate that with increased PBGD activity, the UROS activity of PfPBGD, perhaps, becomes rate-limiting and allows the non-enzymatic cyclization of pre-uroporphyrinogen into UROGEN I. Sato et al. (7Sato S. Clough B. Coates L. Wilson R.J. Protist. 2004; 155: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) have earlier shown that the N-terminal 65 amino acid residues of PfPBGD fused with GFP is targeted to the apicoplast, when the fusion gene is transfected into the parasite. The present studies with anti-PfPBGD antibodies reveal that the native enzyme is indeed localized to the apicoplast. Preliminary studies (unpublished) reveal that the parasite cytosol contains imported host red cell PBGD. Earlier studies in this laboratory have demonstrated the import of functional host ALAD (12Dhanasekaran S. Chandra N.R. Sagar B.K.C. Rangarajan P.N. Padmanaban G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6934-6942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and FC (13Varadharajan S. Sagar B.K.C. Rangarajan P.N. Padmanaban G. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) into the parasite cytosol. It appears that the parasite genome-coded heme-biosynthetic enzymes are much less efficient than the imported host enzymes and the two pathways in the parasite may be differently compartmentalized (39Padmanaban G. Nagaraj V.A. Rangarajan P.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 443-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These results call for a detailed assessment of the contribution of imported host Versus PfPBGD in parasite heme biosynthesis. Download .pdf (.03 MB) Help with pdf files"

Recent clinical observations, however, have suggested that ETV may indeed demonstrate anti-HIV-1 activity. To investigate this question at a molecular level, kinetic studies were used to examine the interaction of 5′-triphosphate form of ETV with wild type (WT) HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) and the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-resistant mutation M184V. Using single turnover kinetic assays, we found that HIV-1 WT RT and M184V RT could use the activated ETV triphosphate metabolite as a substrate for incorporation. The mutant displayed a slower incorporation rate, a lower binding affinity, and a lower incorporation efficiency with the 5′-triphosphate form of ETV compared with WT RT, suggesting a kinetic basis for resistance. Our results are supported by cell-based assays in primary human lymphocytes that show inhibition of WT HIV-1 replication by ETV and decreased susceptibility of the HIV-1 containing the M184V mutation. This study has important therapeutic implications as it establishes ETV as an inhibitor for HIV-1 RT and illustrates the mechanism of resistance by the M184V mutant.

The 5′-triphosphate form of ETV (ETVTP) inhibits HBV polymerase. Similar to other nucleoside analogs, upon entry into the cell, metabolic activation of ETV requires phosphorylation by cellular kinases to generate the active triphosphate form of the drug. ETV and the other three other approved nucleoside analogs lamivudine (3TC), adefovir dipivoxil (ADV), and telbivudine also target the HBV polymerase (Pol), which is essential to viral replication. Pol is responsible for converting the plus-strand pre-genomic RNA into a partially double-stranded circular DNA genome during a multi-step process (1Ganem D. Pollack J.R. Tavis J. Infect. Agents Dis. 1994; 3: 85-93PubMed Google Scholar, 2Locarnini S.A. Civitico G.M. Newbold J.E. Antiviral Chem. Chemother. 1996; 7: 53-64Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 3Seeger C. Summers J. Mason W.S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 168: 41-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). ETV-5′ monophosphate is incorporated by HBV Pol resulting in inhibition of the protein-linked priming activity, the reverse transcription of the pre-genomic mRNA, and the DNA-directed DNA synthesis activities of HBV Pol (4Seifer M. Hamatake R.K. Colonno R.J. Standring D.N. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 3200-3208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ETV binds to the HBV Pol with high affinity. Its increased affinity over the other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) may in part be ascribed to its novel structure (see Fig. 1A) (4Seifer M. Hamatake R.K. Colonno R.J. Standring D.N. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 3200-3208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like the other approved drugs, it is potent in cell culture systems and in humans (5Innaimo S.F.

This potency may be attributed to multiple modes of action on several targets essential for viral replication (4Seifer M. Hamatake R.K. Colonno R.J. Standring D.N. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 3200-3208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). human immunodeficiency virus Entecavir 5′-triphosphate ETV hepatitis B virus polymerase nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor reverse transcriptase peripheral blood mononuclear wild type carbovir triphosphate azidothymidine. human immunodeficiency virus Entecavir 5′-triphosphate ETV hepatitis B virus polymerase nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor reverse transcriptase peripheral blood mononuclear wild type carbovir triphosphate azidothymidine. Unlike other nucleoside analogs approved for HBV therapy that are obligate chain terminators of DNA elongation because they lack a 3′-hydroxyl required for nucleotide addition, ETV is a nonobligate chain terminator that has been suggested to stall the HBV Pol at sites two or three residues downstream from dG incorporation sites (4Seifer M. Hamatake R.K. Colonno R.J. Standring D.N. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 3200-3208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1A). Chain termination occurs through the increasing steric constraints that affect the efficiency of subsequent nucleotide additions (8Langley D.R. Walsh A.W. Baldick C.J. Eggers B.J. Rose R.E. Levine S.M. Kapur A.J. Colonno R.J. Tenney D.J. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 3992-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Because of its high potency and selectivity, ETV is recommended as a first line treatment in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and HBV co-infected patients who do not require anti-HIV therapy (9Benson C.A. Kaplan J.E. Masur H. Pau A. Holmes K.K. MMWR Recomm. Rep. 2004; 53: 1-112PubMed Google Scholar, 10Soriano V. Miro J.M. Garcia-Samaniego J. Torre-Cisneros J. Nunez M. del Romero J. Martin-Carbonero L.

Hepat. 2004; 11: 2-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Earlier studies suggested that ETV displays no significant activity against HIV in cell culture (5Innaimo S.F. Seifer M. Bisacchi G.S. Standring D.N. Zahler R. Colonno R.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 1444-1448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although recent clinical data have called this observation into question (11McMahon M.A. Jilek B.L. Brennan T.P. Shen L. Zhou Y. WindRotolo M. Xing S. Bhat S. Hale B. Hegarty R. Chong C.R. Liu J.O. Siliciano R.F. Thio C.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 356: 2614-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Also, it remains unclear whether ETV could inhibit the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) similar to other approved HIV-1 NRTIs or fixed conformation nucleoside analogs (12Boyer P.L. Julias J.G. Marquez V.E. Hughes S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Antiviral therapy against HIV-1 includes the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and the NRTIs. The NRTIs target the HIV-1 RT and act as chain terminators similar to the HBV-approved drugs. They require phosphorylation to become metabolically active and act as substrates for the viral polymerase. They act as obligate chain terminators because of the lack of a 3′-hydroxyl group. 3TC is also approved for use against HIV, whereas adefovir dipivoxil and telbivudine are only approved for HBV infections but can be used for co-infected individuals when treatment of only HBV is needed. A recent report revealed that during ETV therapy of HIV- and HBV-infected persons, a decline in HIV-1 RNA was observed along with appearance in one subject of the NRTI-resistant mutation M184V in HIV-1 RT (11McMahon M.A. Jilek B.L. Brennan T.P. Shen L. Zhou Y. WindRotolo M. Xing S. Bhat S. Hale B. Hegarty R. Chong C.R. Liu J.O. Siliciano R.F. Thio C.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 356: 2614-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In addition, ETV was shown to be a potent, but partial, inhibitor of HIV-1 infectivity in a sensitive in vitro assay and to prevent the accumulation of viral cDNA in recently infected cells (11McMahon M.A. Jilek B.L. Brennan T.P. Shen L. Zhou Y. WindRotolo M. Xing S. Bhat S. Hale B. Hegarty R. Chong C.R. Liu J.O. Siliciano R.F. Thio C.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 356: 2614-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). This suggests that ETV could potentially inhibit HIV replication and target HIV-1 RT. It is unclear whether HIV-1 RT could incorporate the activated ETV triphosphate metabolite, ETVTP. To date, no studies examining the interaction of ETVTP with HIV-1 RT have been reported. Using a kinetic approach that has been previously employed in our laboratory to study nucleotide analog incorporation, the current study was performed to examine the interaction of ETVTP and HIV-1 RT. We also looked at the ability of the NRTI resistant mutation M184V to affect incorporation of ETVTP. In parallel, the ability of ETV to inhibit WT HIV-1 and HIV-1 harboring the M184V mutation in human peripheral blood mononuclear (PBM) cells was re-examined. Our results show that HIV-1 RT can use ETVTP as a substrate for incorporation and that ETVTP has an affinity similar to other HIV-1 NRTIs. HIV-1 RT with the M184V mutation can also incorporate ETVTP but with a reduced efficiency due to a slower incorporation rate and a weaker affinity. The data suggest a unique mechanism of inhibition of RT that is examined by molecular modeling studies. This work provides a molecular and kinetic basis for the HIV-1 inhibition seen in patients. The cell-based results showing inhibition of HIV-1 by ETV and decreased susceptibility to the HIV-1 containing the M184V mutation further supports the cell-free enzymatic results. Expression and Purification of HIV-1 RT—The WT RT and M184V RT clones were generously provided by Stephen Hughes, Paul Boyer, and Andrea Ferris (Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Frederick, MD). N-terminal histidine-tagged heterodimeric p66/p51 reverse transcriptase was purified as previously described (13Kerr S.G. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14064-14070Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Materials—ETVTP was synthesized as previously described (14Ray A.S. Yang Z. Shi J. Hobbs A. Schinazi R.F. Chu C.K. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5150-5162Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). dGTP was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The (–)-CBVTP was generously provided by Dr. William B. Parker (Southern Research Institute, Birmingham, AL) and further purified as previously described (14Ray A.S. Yang Z. Shi J. Hobbs A. Schinazi R.F. Chu C.K. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5150-5162Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Labeling and Annealing of Oligonucleotides—Primers and templates used for incorporation studies are shown in Fig. 1, and all of the DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 380A DNA Synthesizer (Keck DNA synthesis facility, Yale University) and purified using 20% polyacrylamide denaturing gel electrophoresis. Primer/templates were labeled and annealed as previously described (15Murakami E. Basavapathruni A. Bradley W.D. Anderson K.S. Antiviral Res. 2005; 67: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Single-turnover and Pre-steady-state Burst Experiments—Rapid chemical quench experiments were performed as previously described with a KinTek Instruments model RQF-3 rapid quench-flow apparatus (13Kerr S.G. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14064-14070Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 16Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reactions were carried out by rapid mixing of a solution containing the preincubated complex of 250 nm HIV-1 RT (active site concentration) and 50 nm 5′-labeled DNA/DNA duplex with a solution of 10 mm MgCl2 and varying concentrations of either ETVTP alone or along with dNTPs in the presence of 50 mm Tris-Cl, 50 mm NaCl at pH 7.8 and 37 °C (all concentrations represent the final concentrations after mixing). The reactions were stopped by quenching at various time points with 0.3 m (final) EDTA. Pre-steady-state burst experiments were done under the same conditions as those described for a single-turnover experiment, except the amount of primer template (300 nm final) was in 3-fold excess of enzyme (100 nm active sites final). Products were separated on a 20% polyacrylamide gel and quantitated on a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX. Determination of Kd,DNA for Primer/Template—The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd,DNA) for primer/template was determined as described previously (16Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 nm WT HIV-1 RT (active sites) was incubated with varying concentrations of radiolabeled primer/template for 1 min or longer on ice. Reactions were initiated by mixing with a solution containing 10 mm MgCl2 and either 300 μm dGTP or 50 μm ETVTP. All concentrations represent final concentrations after mixing. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.3 m EDTA (final) after 0.5 s for dGTP and 1 min for ETVTP incorporation. Burst amplitudes were determined as described under “Single-turnover and Pre-steady-state Burst Experiments” under “Experimental Procedures” and plotted as a function of primer/template concentration. HIV-1 Antiviral Assay in Primary Human Lymphocytes—This was described previously (17Schinazi R.F. McMillan A. Cannon D. Mathis R. Lloyd R.M. Peck A. Sommadossi J-P. St. Clair M. Wilson J. Furman P.A.

Hart G.C. Smith G.A. Hahn E.F. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1990; 34: 1061-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Data Analysis—Data were fit by nonlinear regression using the program Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Results from single-turnover incorporation experiments were fit to a single exponential equation, [product] = A(1–exp(–kobsdt)), where A represents the amplitude, and kobsd (k observed) is the first-order rate constant for dNTP or analogue incorporation. Data from pre-steady-state burst experiments were fit to a burst equation, [product] = A(1–exp(–kobsdt) + ksst), where kss is the observed steady-state rate constant. The dissociation constant (Kd,dNTP) of dNTP or analogue binding to the complex of RT and primer/template during dNMP incorporation was calculated by fitting the observed rate constants at different concentrations of dNTP or analogue to one of the following hyperbolic equation, kobsd = kpol[dNTP]/Kd,dNTP + [dNTP] or kobsd = A[dNTP]/Kd,dNTP + [dNTP], where kpol is the maximum first-order rate constant for dNMP incorporation, and Kd,dNTP is the equilibrium dissociation constant for the interaction of dNTP or analogue with the E·DNA complex. The data from DNA binding experiments were fitted to the quadratic equation [E·DNA] = [(Kd,DNA + E + D)–((Kd,DNA + E + D)2–4ED)1/2], where E is the active enzyme concentration, and D is the total DNA concentration. Errors reported represent the deviation of points from the curve fit generated by Kaleidagraph or were calculated by standard statistical analysis (19Skoog D.A. Leary J.J. Principles of Instrumental Analysis. 4th Ed. Saunders Collge Publishing, New York1992Google Scholar). Modeling—The modeling efforts were started from the crystal structure of the RT template-primer complex from Huang et al. (20Huang H. Verdine G.L. Chopra R. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar), PDB entry 1RTD. A single molecule of the complex was kept, including the four Mg2+ associated with it. The crystal structure was initially read into the UCSF Chimera program (21Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D. Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Greenblatt D.M. Meng E.C. Ferrin T.E. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (27327) Google Scholar), and the incoming dTTP was replaced for dGTP. Also, the corresponding dAMP in template position 5 was replaced for dC while maintaining the hydrogen bonding within them. Then the dCMPs in primer positions +3, +4, and +6 (17Schinazi R.F. McMillan A. Cannon D. Mathis R. Lloyd R.M. Peck A. Sommadossi J-P. St. Clair M. Wilson J. Furman P.A. Painter G. Choi W.-B. Liotta D.C. Antimicrob.

This completed the first initial model (GA) that features dGMPs in all primer positions from +1 to +7 with minimal amount of disruption from the crystal structure. Separately, the initial structure of ETV was built and optimized at the HF/6–31g(d) level using GaussView and Gaussian 03 (22Frisch M.J. Trucks G.W. Schlegel H.B. Scuseria G.E.

Gaussian 03. 2003; (Revision B.01, Gaussian, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA)Google Scholar). This ETV model was overlaid on the dGTP of the GA model to create E0. The same procedure was used separately on each of the primer dGMPs from +1 to +7 to create models E1 through E7. The creation of the initial models was completed by reading the PDB files created by Chimera in Schrö-dinger's Maestro 7.5 (23Maestro (2006) Version 7.5, Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NYGoogle Scholar) and adding the hydrogen atoms needed at protonation states appropriate to pH 7. All the remaining calculations were done using the Impact program (24Impact(2006) Version 4.0, Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NYGoogle Scholar) through the Maestro interface. For each of the models created in this fashion, the following set of energy minimizations was sequentially run using the truncated Newton-Raphson algorithm with the OPLS_2001 force field, a distance-dependent dielectric ϵ = 4r, and a 12-Å cutoff for non-bonded interactions. First, the position of all the hydrogen atoms was optimized. Then the newly created ETV-C pair was fully minimized while keeping the rest of the atoms fixed. The next minimization optimized the ETV-C pair plus the pair above it (the preceding nucleotide in the primer chain and the next in the template). In the final optimization all nucleotides in primer positions +1 to +7 and their hydrogen-bonding partners in the template dCMP were allowed to move while keeping the chain atoms (P, O3′, C3′, C4′, C5′, and O5′) fixed. The dNTP and the two closer Mg2+ ions were fully optimized as well during this run. In the current study we used a pre-steady-state kinetic approach to determine the kinetic parameters of HIV-1 RT incorporation of the active form of the guanosine analog ETVTP (shown in Fig. 1A). The kinetic constants determined were the maximum rate of polymerization (kpol) and the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd,dNTP). The incorporation efficiency (kpol/Kd,dNTP) was calculated from these values and used to compare WT and M184V mutant forms of the HIV-1 RT enzymes. This analysis was used to assess the ability of HIV-1 RT to use ETVTP as a substrate for incorporation. A single turnover experiment in which HIV-1 RT is in excess of primer/template was performed to determine whether RT could incorporate ETVTP onto the 24/36-mer DNA/DNA primer-template based on the HIV-1 genomic sequence as shown in Fig. 1B. It was found that HIV-1 RT does indeed incorporate ETVMP similar to other nucleotide substrates as illustrated by the elongation of the DNA 24-mer to a 25-mer (Fig. 1C, panel I). It is incorporated similar to the natural substrate dGTP (Fig. 1D, first panel, left) and the NRTI guanosine analog, carbovir triphosphate (CBVTP), the active triphosphate metabolite of abacavir (Fig. 1D, third panel, right). These data directly demonstrate that even though ETV is used to target HBV Pol, it can also be used as substrate for HIV-1 RT similar to the natural dGTP substrate and CBVTP. This has important consequences for the treatment of individuals co-infected by HBV and HIV. Unlike other NRTI inhibitors, ETV has a 3′-hydroxyl group that can be used for subsequent nucleotide addition. To further investigate the molecular mechanism of inhibition, the ability of HIV-1 RT to incorporate additional nucleotides after ETV incorporation was assessed (Fig. 1C, panels II–IV). For this experiment, the next nucleotide, dCTP (100 μm), was added to the reaction mixture containing excess HIV-1 RT (250 nm), DNA/DNA duplex (50 nm), ETVTP (100 μm), and MgCl2 (10 mm). We observed that after ETVMP is incorporated, dCMP could also be incorporated using the ETV 3′-hydroxyl group for addition to form a 26-mer opposite the template dG and at longer times (>2 min) 27-mer likely due to a pyrimidine-purine mismatch from misincorporation opposite the template dA (see gel in Fig. 1C, panel II). The inclusion of the natural nucleotide, dTTP, in addition to dCTP in the reaction resulted in the further elongation to form a 27-mer (see gel in Fig. 1C, panel III). The addition of dCTP, dTTP, and dATP with ETVTP showed that multiple nucleotides are incorporated after ETV to form a 28-mer before chain termination occurred (see gel, Fig. 1C, panel IV). Extension to the end of the template would normally occur when all four natural nucleotides are in the reaction to form a 32-mer (Fig. 1D, second panel, middle). These results establish that ETVMP may be incorporated onto the growing DNA strand by RT during reverse transcription. Moreover, when additional nucleotides are added with ETVTP, multiple nucleotides are incorporated after ETV addition before chain termination occurs. This would suggest a new unique mechanism for inhibition of HIV RT and reverse transcription in which there is a delayed chain termination effect that is somewhat similar to that suggested for HBV Pol inhibition in which the HIV-1 RT stalls after multiple incorporations before another ETV is incorporated (4Seifer M. Hamatake R.K. Colonno R.J. Standring D.N. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 3200-3208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Langley D.R. Walsh A.W. Baldick C.J. Eggers B.J. Rose R.E. Levine S.M. Kapur A.J. Colonno R.J. Tenney D.J. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 3992-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To determine the maximum rate of polymerization (kpol), the binding affinity (Kd,ETVTP), and efficiency of ETVTP incorporation (kpol/Kd,ETVTP), the concentration dependence of ETVTP incorporation was examined with single turnover experiments with HIV-1 RT using increasing concentrations of ETVTP (500 nm to 50 μm). The reaction kinetics for single nucleotide incorporation exhibited complex behavior for incorporation of ETVMP by HIV-1 RT. No change in rate was observed with increasing concentrations of ETVTP. Upon removal of contaminating pyrophosphate, there was an increase in observed rate as a function of ETVTP concentration (Fig. 2A). A hyperbolic fit of the observed rate versus ETVTP concentration (Fig. 2B) suggests that WT HIV-1 RT appears to bind ETVTP with a Kd,ETVTP of 2.23 ± 0.67 μm, kpol of 0.107 ± 0.007 s–1, and corresponding efficiency of 0.048 μm–1 s–1 (see Table 1). The natural nucleotide dGTP is incorporated at a faster rate, kpol of 18.3 ± 1.30 s–1, and binds with a greater affinity, Kd,dGTP of 1.76 ± 0.51 μm, than ETVTP, resulting in a greater efficiency of incorporation of 10.4 ± 3.11 μm–1 s–1. The guanosine analog CBVTP, an effective inhibitor of HIV-1 RT, is also not as efficiently incorporated as dGTP. In comparison to ETVTP, the binding affinity for CBVTP is weaker (Kd,CBVTP of 27.8 ± 7.68 μm). However, the rate of incorporation is much faster (kpol of 2.26 ± 0.24 s–1, Table 1), resulting in a 2-fold higher efficiency.TABLE 1Enzyme assay showing effect of ETVTP on HIV RTHIV RTdNTPkpolKd,dNTPkpol/Kd,dNTPs-1μmμm-1 s-1WTdGTP18.3 ± 1.301.76 ± 0.5110.4 ± 3.11ETVTP0.107 ± 0.0072.23 ± 0.670.048 ± 0.015CBVTP2.26 ± 0.2427.8 ± 7.680.081 ± 0.024M184VdGTP34.4 ± 3.365.93 ± 2.045.8 ± 2.1ETVTP0.019 ± 0.00227.8 ± 6.120.0007 ± 0.0002CBVTP0.887 ± 0.07814.1 ± 3.90.063 ± 0.018 Open table in a new tab A pre-steady-state burst was done to determine whether the rate-limiting step follows chemistry similar to a natural nucleotide. A pre-steady-state burst of product formation was observed for ETVMP incorporation by WT RT (Fig. 2C). The presence of a pre-steady-state burst during incorporation of an analog suggests that it is being incorporated by a comparable kinetic mechanism as natural nucleotides. Slow chemical catalysis and product release, however, were observed with the burst phase (kobsd) equal to 0.125 ± 0.031 s–1 and an observed rate for the linear phase (kss) equal to 0.020 ± 0.006 s–1. A titration of primer/template with WT HIV-1 RT was performed using either dGTP or ETVTP as the substrate for nucleotide incorporation (Fig. 3). A significant difference was noted in the dissociation constant for the primer/template when using 50 μm ETVTP as the substrate (Kd,DNA of 127.5 ± 4.9 nm) versus the natural substrate dGTP (Kd,DNA of 31.3 ± 9.3 nm) indicating that the presence of ETVMP alters the DNA affinity. The appearance of M184V in subjects during ETV therapy (11McMahon M.A. Jilek B.L. Brennan T.P. Shen L. Zhou Y. WindRotolo M. Xing S. Bhat S. Hale B. Hegarty R. Chong C.R. Liu J.O. Siliciano R.F.

In single-round assays, infection of primary CD4+ T cells by the M184V virus is not inhibited by ETV (11McMahon M.A. Jilek B.L. Brennan T.P. Shen L. Zhou Y. WindRotolo M. Xing S. Bhat S. Hale B.

To establish a kinetic basis for M184V resistance to ETV, we determined the kinetic constants for ETVTP incorporation by M184V mutant HIV-1 RT (Table 1). As illustrated in Table 1, M184V has a Kd,ETVTP of 27.8 ± 6.12 μm and a kpol of 0.019 ± 0.002 s–1. This indicates that compared with WT RT, the RT of M184V binds to ETV with a lower affinity and at a slower rate, resulting in an 68-fold lower efficiency of incorporation. The incorporatio"

Cytotoxicity resulting from pathological insults, such as cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury, stroke (1Matsumoto S. Friberg H. Ferrand-Drake M. Wieloch T. J. Cereb.

These events have been hypothesized to be linked biochemically, because mitochondria are a major site for Ca2+ sequestration, normally absorbing excess cytosolic Ca2+ through the Ca2+ uniporter (which is driven by the membrane potential Δφm) 2The abbreviations used are:Δφmmitochondrial membrane potentialmPTmitochondrial permeability transitionmPTPnPT poreTMRMtetramethylrhodamine methyl esterΔ[Ca2+]change(s) in Ca2+ concentration[MH]Aa population of active, unswollen mitochondria[MH]Ian intermediate state[MH]Na population of inactive (swollen) mitochondria[Ca2+]TCa2+ added to the assay medium[Ca2+]outextramitochondrial Ca2+[Ca2+]mCa2+ absorbed by mitochondria. and releasing it via the Na+/Ca2+ and Ca2+/H+ exchangers, resulting in a slow, continuous cycling of Ca2+ across the inner mitochondrial membrane.

From a kinetic point of view, at least three conceptually distinct phases must be resolved during the mPT induction: (i) the initiation phase, which includes the initial intake of excess Ca2+ via the Ca2+ uniporter; (ii) the “lag” phase, during which Ca2+ cycling induces or accompanies a series of reactions in mitochondria (e.g. the pore constituents are recruited and possibly assembled); and (iii) the propagation or termination phase. This final phase is associated with a decrease in membrane potential observable at the population level, release of mitochondrially sequestered Ca2+ (and a resultant increase in the steady-state Ca2+ concentration in the medium, which consequently fuels subsequent Ca2+ uptake by the remaining intact mitochondria, creating a positive feedback loop for damage propagation), final pore assembly, and pore opening. These events result in the loss of integrity of the inner mitochondrial membrane, uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation, and mitochondrial swelling. Notably, at least under conditions in which the concentration of added Ca2+ is relatively low, the termination phase appears to be very short relative to the lag phase when considered at the population level (i.e. at the level typically observed experimentally). Thus, we do not further consider the termination phase in our kinetic model. Thus, the mPT induction may be kinetically described (under low Ca2+ conditions only) as having only two phases, the initiation phase and the lag phase, where the latter is described as the period after the initiation phase and before mitochondrial swelling. In this model, the actual swelling event (step iii above) is all-or-none and takes place nearly instantaneously for each individual mitochondrial particle. Both the initiation and lag phases are complex reactions that involve a multitude of parallel and interrelated processes (e.g. calcium cycling, pyridine nucleotide oxidation, oxidation of other compounds, membrane changes, etc.). Systematic kinetic studies should allow valuable insight into details of these processes and, in particular, how they are altered by compounds or conditions that modulate mPT induction. Interpretation of kinetic data requires an appropriate kinetic model. There are two conceptually distinct (and complementary) approaches to building useful kinetic models of mPT induction. One approach leans heavily on theory and a priori knowledge of the molecular processes during the mPT induction and attempts to describe it in the greatest possible detail by accounting for all physico-chemical and biochemical processes, including, but not limited to, Ca2+ homeostasis, mitochondrial respiration, substrate transfer, energy utilization, substrate concentrations, and cofactor concentrations. To our knowledge, the most comprehensive attempt in this direction was made by Pokhilko et al. (12Pokhilko A.V. Ataullakhanov F.I. Holmuhamedov E.L. J. Theor. Biol. 2006; 243: 152-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The utility of any model of this class, however, is intrinsically limited by our current lack of sufficiently detailed information and knowledge about the system and all of its components and their interactions. An alternative approach, which is utilized in the present work, is to build an empirical kinetic model that involves a minimal number of parameters and yet is capable of describing the experimental kinetic data (i.e. a “minimal kinetic model”). Massari (13Massari S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31942-31948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used a simple, first order kinetic model to describe the swelling of mitochondria subsequent to exposure to phenylarsine oxide, a strong thiol oxidant, or to high levels of calcium. Krasnikov et al. (14Krasnikov B.F. Zorov D.B. Antonenko Y.N. Zaspa A.A. Kulikov I.V. Kristal B.S. Cooper A.J. Brown A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1708: 375-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) expanded this analysis to describe parameters other than swelling but otherwise retained the first order kinetic model developed by Massari (13Massari S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31942-31948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and did not utilize information from multiple data acquisition channels. However, the first order kinetic models developed by Massari (13Massari S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31942-31948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and used by Krasnikov et al. (14Krasnikov B.F. Zorov D.B. Antonenko Y.N. Zaspa A.A. Kulikov I.V. Kristal B.S. Cooper A.J. Brown A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1708: 375-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) are only applicable at saturating concentrations of Ca2+ and fail to account for the lag phase often observed at lower, more (patho)physiologically relevant Ca2+ concentrations. The present study formulates a “minimal kinetic model” of the mPT that involves a minimal number of parameters (i.e. the number of parameters in the model cannot be reduced without loss of information) so as to reduce complexity and reduce the possibility of “overfitting” the data. The model is based on the data obtained from experimental studies of isolated rat liver mitochondria and defines the intrinsic rates of change that describe the coordinated changes in Ca2+ concentration in the assay medium ([Ca2+]out) and swelling. Specifically, we simultaneously measured the kinetic evolution of these two parameters during the mPT and then used these data as the basis for our model. Ca2+ fluxes and swelling were chosen because they are established indicators of mPT induction in liver mitochondria. The model was formulated as a set of simultaneous differential equations that can be solved numerically to fit the experimental kinetics. The model is shown to describe the Ca2+-induced mPT quantitatively as a two-step reaction in energized mitochondria and makes accurate predictions about linear relationships between levels of modulators of the mPT and parameters of mPT induction. In this report, we begin by modeling a specific case, a pure Ca2+ overload model of the mPT. We will then show that the model can be easily generalized to more complex situations, such as when additional mPT modulators (e.g. inhibitors and inducers) are present. The results from different modifiers (e.g. promethazine, Mg2+, ruthenium red) suggest that these modifiers interact with different targets and provide insights into potential mechanisms or sites of action.

Mitochondrial Isolation—Liver mitochondria were isolated from 4–6-month-old male Fischer 344 X Brown Norway F1 rats by differential centrifugation using sucrose-based buffers (14Krasnikov B.F. Zorov D.B. Antonenko Y.N. Zaspa A.A. Kulikov I.V. Kristal B.S. Cooper A.J. Brown A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1708: 375-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 15Zhu S. Stavrovskaya I.G.

Assays of Mitochondrial Function—Mitochondrial experiments were carried out using a buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm succinate (added as succinic acid), 1 mm KH2PO4, and 2.5 μm EDTA adjusted to pH 7.4 with KOH. In all cases, isolated mitochondria were added to a concentration of 0.25 mg of protein/ml. We note that the sensitivity of the fluorimeter described below allowed reliable measurement of the basic mitochondria parameters even at protein concentrations as low as 0.05 mg/ml. Fluorescent dyes, including TMRM (0.06 μm) and Ca-Green-5N (0.3 μm), were used to simultaneously measure Δφm and Δ[Ca2+]out, respectively. Based on known spectroscopic properties of TMRM (17Scaduto R.C. Grotyohann L.W. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 469-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar), we measured changes in dye fluorescence yield using an excitation wavelength of 546 nm and emission at 590 nm. Quenching of the fluorescence has been attributed to binding of TMRM to the mitochondrial membranes. Therefore, loss of fluorescence indicates increased potential-dependent binding of TMRM. Conversely, reduced Δφm results in release of bound TMRM and increased fluorescent signal. For the purpose of the experiments reported here, TMRM was used only as a qualitative indicator and was not directly considered in our kinetic model. The increase of Ca-Green-5N fluorescence caused by complex formation with extramitochondrial Ca2+ (18Rajdev S. Reynolds I.J. Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 162: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) was monitored using an excitation/emission pair (λex/em) of 488/535 nm, respectively. Mitochondrial swelling and NAD(P)H oxidation were also simultaneously measured as changes of light scattering at λex/em = 587 nm and changes in fluorescence at λex/em = 377/440 nm, respectively. Simultaneous measurement of Ca2+ fluxes, mitochondrial Δφm, mitochondrial swelling, and changes in NAD(P)H oxidation were done using a multichannel wheel-based fluorimeter. The set-up was equipped with a temperature-controlled quartz cuvette (optical pathway = 1 cm) and stirrer. Paired excitation/emission filters provide precision comparable with that of monochromator-based fluorescence spectrometers. A full description of the experimental set-up is available on the Web site of the manufacturer, C&L instruments. Mitochondria Swelling and NAD(P)H Calibration—As discussed below, our minimal kinetic model of Ca2+-induced mPT assumes that mitochondria can exist in one of two states: either with mPTP closed (so that mitochondria are not swollen) or mPTP opened (so that mitochondria are swollen). To quantitatively determine what fraction of mitochondria were swollen in kinetic experiments required accurate calibration of the fluorescence system. To obtain a fully swollen fraction, mitochondria were incubated for at least 15 min at 30 °C in the presence of high concentrations of CaCl2 (50 μm). Then an excess of EGTA was added to remove free Ca2+. Another sample of mitochondria was incubated in parallel in the same medium without Ca2+ and with added EGTA to suppress mPT. The intact and swollen mitochondrial samples were mixed in different proportions, and their light scattering properties as well as the autofluorescence of mitochondrial NAD(P)H were measured. After each measurement, the nonspecific poreforming agent alamethicin was added to the sample in order to ensure full-scale swelling of each sample (Fig. 1A, inset). The signal obtained after the addition of alamethicin was then subtracted from the initial fluorescence readings. Thus, the difference in fluorescence obtained from the control sample (i.e. the sample incubated in Ca2+-free medium) before and after the addition of alamethicin represents the maximal fluorescence yield associated with mitochondrial swelling. The intermediate values of fluorescence yield were then plotted versus the percentage of swollen mitochondrial present in the sample to provide a calibrated curve. As shown in Fig. 1A, the values obtained for swollen mitochondria as well as for NAD(P)H were linearly proportional to the fractional content of intact mitochondria in the sample across the full range of optical properties examined in our experiments. We note that the mitochondria in the sample that initially contained 100% swollen mitochondria underwent further changes in scattering (about 5%) after the addition of alamethicin. This additional swelling, however, did not affect our kinetic analysis, although the absolute values of the percentage of mitochondria that have undergone an mPT may be slightly inaccurate because of this phenomenon if it reflects mitochondria that did not undergo mPT as opposed to swelling related specifically to alamethicin-induced pore formation. Calibration of the Ca2+Signal Channel—To calibrate the Ca2+ channel, known amounts of CaCl2 were sequentially added to the assay medium, and the Ca2+ signal was measured as the change in Ca-Green-5N fluorescence. The assay medium contained all of the compounds that were used during the actual kinetic experimental series as well as mitochondria swollen by the addition of alamethicin. The inclusion of mitochondria during calibration helped account for changes in optical properties (light scattering) of the assay medium that we could not otherwise account for, given our use of nonratiometric dyes. The calibration curve, shown in Fig. 1B, was used to scale changes in fluorescence of Ca-Green-5N during the experimental series. Ca-Green is commonly used as a Ca2+ probe, but it also possesses affinity to other divalent cations, such as Mg2+. To account for this secondary affinity, we also calibrated the Ca2+ signal channel with solutions containing each of the Mg2+ concentrations used in our experiments. Kinetic Model of Ca2+-induced mPT—Four parameters (Ca2+ concentration, membrane potential Δφm, concentration of reduced pyridine nucleotides (NAD(P)H), and 90° light scattering (which reflects mitochondria swelling) were simultaneously measured in our experiments. Induction of mPT by the addition of Ca2+ was observed in the experiments as Ca2+ release and swelling of the mitochondria. Typical raw kinetic curves for all four parameters obtained upon the addition of 10 μm Ca2+ are shown in Fig. 2. The data on Ca2+ concentration, reduced pyridine nucleotides (NAD(P)H), and mitochondrial swelling were then rescaled using the calibration curves from Fig. 1 (see Fig. 3). In all experiments presented in this report, the kinetics for the swelling and NAD(P)H channels were equivalent. We therefore discuss only swelling data from this point on. We note, however, that other agents may uncouple these signals and that one or the other or both signals may later be shown to be preferential in some or all situations. We also do not discuss further the changes in Δφm as a stand-alone variable in the context of our current model, because the experimental set-up used was not optimized for quantitative estimation of Δφm. Thus, in the analysis that follows, only the kinetic data for Ca2+ concentration and mitochondria swelling were used to formulate the kinetic model of the mPT process.FIGURE 3Scaled measurements of mitochondrial parameters shown inFig. 2.Ca, NAD(P)H, and Swelling channels were rescaled in accordance with the calibration measurements shown in Fig. 1. RLM, rat liver mitochondria.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The kinetic curve for mitochondria swelling (Fig. 3, bottom right) reveals a monotonic decay, and the rate of decay accelerates noticeably with time. The Ca2+ concentration in the buffer (Fig. 3, top right) is clearly correlated with the mitochondrial swelling curve; however, this correlation is nontrivial and kinetically complex. Within the first 10–20 s after the addition of Ca2+ to the medium (10 μm Ca2+ were added in Fig. 3), the Ca2+ concentration dropped quickly to a submicromolar level, indicating that most of the added Ca2+ was immediately absorbed by mitochondria. This absorbed Ca2+ initiated the mPT reaction. During the next 600 s, the fraction of “active” mitochondria (i.e. the fraction of mitochondria capable of electrogenic Ca2+ uptake) progressively decreased (albeit very slowly during this phase), and the fraction of swollen mitochondria slowly increased. The swollen mitochondria released their absorbed Ca2+ back to the medium through the opened mPTP, but the concentration of free Ca2+ in the medium increased more slowly than the population of swollen mitochondria, because the released Ca2+ was immediately reabsorbed by other active mitochondria. This secondary reabsorption of Ca2+ resulted in an elevated concentration of absorbed Ca2+ in the still active mitochondria that in turn resulted in their accelerated swelling rate, as shown in Fig. 3. The full concentration of Ca2+ was recovered back into the medium only at the end of the mPT reaction when all mitochondria were swollen. To account for this Ca2+ reabsorption phenomenon and its accelerating effect on the rate of the mPT process, we propose the kinetic model shown in Scheme 1, where [MH-(Ca2+)i]A represents a population of active, unswollen mitochondria ([MH]A), and i represents the number of Ca2+ already adsorbed by a given mitochondria. Ca2+ absorption occurs during the k1 step shown in the scheme as formation of [MH-(Ca2+)i+1]A, and it initiates the mPT process that we describe here as a sequence of two steps. The k2 step is a rate-limiting step of the mPT induction that results in the formation of the intermediate state [MH]I. The next step (kp) leads to the formation of a population of inactive (swollen) mitochondria, represented as [MH]N, with all Ca2+ released back to the medium. [Ca2+]out is the concentration of free Ca2+ in the medium, available for absorption by mitochondria. Now we can define Ca2+ absorbed by mitochondria ([Ca2+]M) as the product of a number (i) of absorbed Ca2+ and concentration of “active” mitochondria, [MH]A (i.e. [Ca2+]M = i × [MH]A. It is assumed that total concentration of Ca2+ (e.g. [Ca2+]T = [Ca2+]out + [Ca2+]M) is constant during the reaction (i.e. there is a single addition, after which no further Ca2+ is added). This model involves a number of assumptions that are introduced to reflect specific characteristics of the mPT process. These assumptions are as follows. (i) Ca2+ uptake is a bimolecular reaction with rate constant k1. In other words, the rate of Ca2+ uptake is a product k1 × [MH]A × [Ca2+]out and thus can change during the course of the reaction in proportion with [MH]A and [Ca2+]out. The apparent rate constant (k1) is a complex function that subsumes many processes that are associated with Ca2+ sequestering in mitochondria and that include Ca2+ influx and Ca2+ release mechanisms. In this model, we assume that all active mitochondria are equally capable of absorbing the Ca2+, and, under the conditions used, their absorption rate (k1) is essentially (mathematically) independent of the amount of Ca2+ already absorbed by the given mitochondria. This latter assumption appears valid under the Ca2+ conditions used in this study. (ii) The rate of formation of the intermediate state [MH]I is a complex function of the number of Ca2+ ions absorbed by the mitochondria. k2=k2'×([Ca2+]M/[MH]A)n(Eq. 1) Here [Ca2+]M is the concentration of Ca2+ that has been absorbed by mitochondria; thus, the ratio [Ca2+]M/[MH]A is essentially an average number of Ca2+ ions absorbed per active mitochondrion. n is an apparent order of the k2 step with respect to Ca2+, and k2′ is a reaction constant of this step. mPT induction is a complex chain of interconnected reactions triggered by Ca2+; therefore, describing this complex step with one rate constant (e.g. k2) may be an oversimplification. Our rationale for this oversimplification is that in any complex chain of reactions, there always must be one reaction that is the slowest and thus determines the overall rate (ignoring, for the purpose of this modeling exercise, the situation in which multiple steps have control coefficients >0 and <1(i.e. reactions in which there are multiple partially limiting reactions or when the time frame of the k2 step becomes comparable with or less than that of the kp step). The apparent order n is closely related to the Ca2+ order of this slowest reaction, and k2′ is a rate constant of this slowest step. In principal, n can be a noninteger number, because it can be affected by other reactions in the chain, including, but not limited to, mitochondrial heterogeneity, Ca2+ buffering capacity of energized mitochondria, Δφm, redox status, respiratory chain functioning, etc. (iii) Pore opening followed by mitochondrial swelling (the kp step) is an “all-or-nothing” event that occurs without any other rate-limiting intermediate state(s) that are relevant on the time scale of the overall experiment. In other words, the rate constant kp is much faster than the rate-limiting k2 or the Ca2+ uptake step k1. (iv) When mitochondria undergo Ca2+-induced mPT, Ca2+ is released back to the medium and thus becomes available for uptake by other mitochondria. (v) The rate of formation of [MH]I is a truly rate-limiting step in the reaction sequence (e.g. its rate is slower than the Ca2+ absorption step (k2 < k1). Our proposed model offers several improvements as compared with the earlier models by Massari and others (13Massari S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31942-31948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Krasnikov B.F. Zorov D.B. Antonenko Y.N. Zaspa A.A. Kulikov I.V. Kristal B.S. Cooper A.J. Brown A.M. Biochim.

First, the rate of Ca2+ consumption by mitochondria (the k1 step) is assumed to be a second order reaction; therefore, the rate changes in proportion with [Ca2+]out. As seen in Fig. 3 (top right), [Ca2+]out can change significantly during the time course of the experiment; therefore, the rate of Ca2+ uptake can also change significantly. Our second improvement concerns the rate of transient state formation (the k2 step) triggered in mitochondria by absorbed Ca2+. As stated in assumption ii, our model postulates k2 to be a function of the number of Ca2+ ions absorbed by mitochondria and thus enables k2 to change (accelerate) as more Ca2+ is absorbed by the mitochondria (the model also allows k2 to be independent of the absorbed Ca2+ concentration, which occurs when n = 0). Our final and perhaps most significant improvement is that our model describes the autocatalytic role of Ca2+ in mPT induction. Specifically, the model incorporates the release of Ca2+ back to the medium from swollen inactive mitochondria, where it becomes available for reuptake by other functionally active mitochondria ([MH]A). Thus, although the total amount of Ca2+ ([Ca2+]T) remains consta"

CAR is sequestered in the cytoplasm of liver parenchymal cells in a complex with accessory proteins, including CCRP (CAR cytoplasmic retention protein) and Hsp90 (heat shock protein 90) (30Kobayashi K.

The PPARα ligand-induced nuclear translocation of CAR can occur in the absence of PPARα but requires the presence of coactivator PBP. These studies also show that pretreatment with PPARα ligands does not enhance acetaminophen hepatotoxicity in the mouse. Molecular modeling revealed that PPARα ligands fit well in CAR ligand binding pocket analogous to that of CAR antagonist androstenol (40Forman B.M. Tzameli I. Choi H.-S. Chen J. Simha D. Seol W.

These results indicate that PPARα ligands function as agonists of PPARα and inverse agonists (antagonists) of CAR.

A number of Rab proteins have been implicated in cancer development and/or progression. Here we report the identification of a novel Rab-like protein, which we have named RBEL1 (Rab-like protein 1) for its higher similarity to the Rab subfamily members. We have characterized two isoforms of RBEL1 including the predominant RBEL1A and the less abundant RBEL1B that results from alternative splicing. Both isoforms harbor conserved N-terminal guanine trinucleotide phosphate (GTP) binding domains and, accordingly, are capable of binding to GTP. Both isoforms contain variable C termini and exhibit differential subcellular localization patterns. Unlike known Rabs that are mostly cytosolic, RBEL1B predominantly resides in the nucleus, whereas RBEL1A is localized primarily to the cytosol. Interestingly, a point mutation affecting RBEL1B GTP binding also alters the ability of mutant protein to accumulate in the nucleus, suggesting GTP binding potential to be important for RBEL1B nuclear localization. Our results also indicate that RBEL1A is overexpressed in about 67% of primary breast tumors. Thus, RBEL1A and RBEL1B are novel Rab-like proteins that localize in the nucleus and cytosol and may play an important role in breast tumorigenesis.

The Ras superfamily consists of five structurally distinct subfamilies including Ras, Rho, Rab, Sar1/Arf, and Ran with the Rab group of proteins constituting the largest subfamily (1Pereira-Leal J.B. Seabra M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1077-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Some Rabs are expressed ubiquitously, although others exhibit tissue specificity. In general, the key function of many of the known Rab proteins is to regulate protein transport/trafficking pathways and to determine the specificity of membrane transport steps within the cell (1Pereira-Leal J.B. Seabra M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1077-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 2Pfeffer S.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 487-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). In a manner similar to other GTP-binding proteins, many Rab proteins cycle between a GTP-bound active state and a GDP-bound inactive state. The GTP-bound Rabs interact with their effectors and thereby regulate important steps in the vesicular transport affecting the compartmentalization of their effector proteins. The GDP-bound Rabs, on the other hand, disassociate from their effectors and return to the donor compartment for the next delivery cycle (2Pfeffer S.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 487-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Different Rab members have been shown to regulate different steps in vesicle trafficking including cargo selection and budding, movement, docking, and fusion (2Pfeffer S.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 487-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 3Seabra M.C. Mules E.H. Hume A.N. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 23-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). For example, Rab1, Rab2, Rab5, and Rab9 are implicated in the first stage (selection and budding) of secretory transport; Sec4, Rab5, Rab6, and Rab7 are involved in the second stage (vesicle movement), and Ypt1, Ypt7, Sec4, Rab1, and Rab5 are implicated in the third stage (vesicle tethering/docking). Some Rabs, such as Rab5, are believed to regulate several stages (i.e. stages 1, 2, and 3) of protein transport (3Seabra M.C. Mules E.H. Hume A.N. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 23-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Because Rabs are involved in different steps in the exocytic and endocytic pathways, their subcellular localization also varies. For example, Rab1 and Rab6 are found in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi respectively, whereas Rab5 and Rab7 reside in the early and late endosomes, respectively (2Pfeffer S.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 487-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 4Darchen F. Goud B. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that some Rab proteins are involved in cancer development and/or progression (5Cheng K.W. Lahad J.P. Gray J.W. Mills G.B. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 2516-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). For example, overexpression of Rab1B, Rab4B, Rab10, Rab22A, Rab24, and Rab25 genes has been reported in liver cancers (6He H. Dai F. Yu L. She X. Zhao Y. Jiang J. Chen X. Zhao S.

Increased expression of Rab25 has also been linked to prostate cancer progression (8Calvo A. Xiao N. Kang J. Best C.J. Leiva I. Emmert-Buck M.R. Jorcyk C. Green J.E. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5325-5335PubMed Google Scholar). Elevated levels of Rab25, due to gene amplification, have been found in ovarian and breast cancers and linked to increased aggressiveness and poor prognosis. Enforced expression of Rab25 is reported to also enhance anchorage-independent growth and cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis induced by several genotoxic and nongenotoxic stresses involving UV irradiation, nutrition starvation, and taxol treatment (9Cheng K.W. Lahad J.P. Kuo W.L. Lapuk A. Yamada K. Auersperg N. Liu J. Smith-McCune K. Lu K.H. Fishman D. Gray J.W. Mills G.B. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 1251-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Despite recent progress made in delineating the function of Rabs in protein transport/trafficking, our understanding of the role of this class of proteins in human cancer development and/or progression is still very limited, and thus, further studies are needed. In this manuscript we report the identification and characterization of a novel Rab-like protein that we have named RBEL1 (Rab-Like protein 1). We have characterized two splice variants, RBEL1A and RBEL1B, and demonstrated that they are novel GTP-binding proteins. RBEL1A and RBEL1B reside in the cytosol as well as the nucleus, although to different degrees. Interestingly, the nuclear localization of RBEL1B is associated with its GTP binding ability, as the mutant defective in GTP binding does not accumulate in the nucleus. Our results further indicate that RBEL1A is overexpressed in the majority of primary breast tumors. Thus, RBEL1A and -B, to the best of our knowledge are the first Rab-like proteins that localize to the nucleus and may play an important role in modulating cell survival and tumorigenesis. Reagents and Expression Constructs—GFP 2The abbreviations used are: GFPgreen fluorescent proteinHAhemagglutininRTreverse transcriptionNAHaseβ-N-acetylhexosaminidase antibody was from Roche Applied Science. HA-tag monoclonal antibody (HA.11) was from Covance (Berkeley, CA). β-Actin monoclonal antibody was from Sigma. All RBEL1 point mutations were generated by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Anti-human RBEL1 antibodies were generated through a commercial source (Pocono Rabbit Farm and Laboratory, Canadensis, PA) by immunizing rabbits with a peptide containing 18 amino acids (ALKKLVGSDQAPGRDKNC) specific for both A and B variants of the RBEL1 protein and does not show homology to any known protein including other Rab and Ras family members. green fluorescent protein hemagglutinin reverse transcription β-N-acetylhexosaminidase To generate the GFP-tagged wild type and mutant RBEL1A and RBEL1B constructs, full-length RBEL1A and RBEL1B cDNAs were subcloned into pEGFPc1 expression construct (BD Bioscience Clontech). HA-tagged RBEL1A and RBEL1B were generated by inserting the open reading frame of RBEL1A and -B into the pSRαHA mammalian expression vector. All vectors were sequenced to confirm the correct sequences. HA-tagged RBEL1AT57N and RBEL1BT57N point mutations were generated using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as per the manufacturer's protocol. RT-PCR—RT-PCR was performed as we have previously described (10Huang Y. He Q. Hillman M.J. Rong R. Sheikh M.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6918-6924PubMed Google Scholar). Primers for the PCR reactions included sense primer, 5′-AATGCCGCCCCACCATCCTCTGTG-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-GCTGTCCCCTCCCTTCTTGC-3′. RBEL1A and RBEL1B were simultaneously amplified in the same PCR reaction, and these primers amplified the 1200- and 360-bp products representing RBEL1A and RBEL1B, respectively. RNA Blot Hybridizations—Northern blotting and hybridizations for Cancer Profiling Arrays were performed according to standard procedures as we have previously described (11Luo X. Huang Y. Sheikh M.S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7247-7257Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 12Luo X. He Q. Huang Y. Sheikh M.S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10725-10733Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To detect RBEL1 expression, human RBEL1 cDNA fragments that recognize both RBEL1A and RBEL1B isoforms or are specific to RBEL1A isoform were used as probes. Human multiple tissue Northern blot membrane containing poly-A+ RNA from various human tissues was purchased from Panomics (Fremont, CA). Human cancer profiling arrays carrying the cDNAs of transcripts isolated from matching normal and tumor tissues representing 241 individual patients were purchased from BD Bioscience/Clontech. Western Blotting, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunostaining—Western blotting, immunoprecipitations, and immunostaining were performed by standard procedures as we previously described (13Rong R. Jin W. Zhang J. Sheikh M.S. Huang Y. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 8216-8230Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). β-N-Acetylhexosaminidase (NAHase) Digestion—NAHase digestion was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (New England Biolabs). Briefly, 50 μg of total protein from lysates of 293T- or RKO cell-transfected RBEL1A and RBEL1B expression vectors were incubated in reaction buffer (provided by the vendor) plus NAHase (25 units) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty-four hours after digestion, all samples were analyzed by Western blotting using RBEL1-specific antibodies. RBEL1A Suppression by RNA Interference—To suppress RBEL1A expression, cells were transiently transfected with negative control medium GC content Stealth RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) duplex or a combination of three Stealth RNAi duplexes specific for RBEL1 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The small interfering RNAs used are 5′-UGACGAAGGACAGCAUUUGUGCAGC-3′, 5′-UCGUUCUCCAUCUUUAAGCCGUCGC-3′, and 5′-UCCCGGAGAAUGUAAUUGAAGGUCC-3′. Nuclear and Cytosolic Fractionations—Nuclear and cytosolic fractionations were prepared as previously described (14Corcoran C.A. He Q. Huang Y. Sheikh M.S. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1634-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In Vitro GTPase Assay—RBEL1 binding to GTP was performed by using the procedures as we have previously described (15Huang Y. Saez R. Chao L. Santos E. Aaronson S.A. Chan A.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1255-1260PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells were transiently transfected with either GFP or pSRα-HA empty vectors (negative control), HA-TC21WT (positive control), GFP-tagged RBEL1A and RBEL1B, and HA-tagged RBEL1A or -B (wild type and T57N mutant) and labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described (15Huang Y. Saez R. Chao L. Santos E. Aaronson S.A. Chan A.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1255-1260PubMed Google Scholar). After labeling in cell culture, cells were lysed, and activated charcoal was added to remove excess radioactive phosphorus. GFP, GFP-tagged RBEL1 proteins or HA only, HA-tagged RBEL1A, RBEL1B, or wild type-TC21 were immunoprecipitated with anti-tag antibodies. Bead-bound immunoprecipitants were then eluted, and equal amounts of each immunoprecipitate were spotted and run on a cellulose polyester foil-backed layers (PEI-F) plate and exposed to phosphorimaging. Identification of RBEL1, a Novel Member of the Ras Superfamily—Using a computer-based approach involving alignment of redundant expressed sequence tags (ESTs) to delineate novel open reading frames, we have recently identified and cloned several novel stress-regulated genes that exhibit altered expression in human tumors (11Luo X. Huang Y. Sheikh M.S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7247-7257Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 12Luo X. He Q. Huang Y. Sheikh M.S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10725-10733Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Using a similar approach, we also identified a novel gene encoding a Rab-like protein, which we have named RBEL1 for its unique protein sequence. We have characterized two isoforms of RBEL1 designated as RBEL1A and RBEL1B (Fig. 1, A and B; supplemental Fig. 1, A and B). The RBEL1 gene maps to chromosome 9q34.3, and according to the genomic organization, RBEL1A harbors 15 exons, whereas the splice variant corresponding to RBEL1B is devoid of exons 10-14 and is also missing parts of the exons 9 and 15 (Fig. 1, A and B). Thus, RBEL1A and -B proteins contain identical N-terminal sequences but harbor divergent C termini, and the data base searches revealed the existence of only hypothetical proteins indicating RBEL1 to be a novel protein. At the N termini, both RBEL1A and -B contain the hallmark sequence of all the GTP-binding proteins harboring five highly conserved domains involved in nucleotide binding and hydrolysis (shown in bold and underlined in supplemental Figs. 1, A and B). It is known that the members of the Ras superfamily share a high degree of homology at their N termini but are divergent at their C termini (16Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 799-827Crossref Scopus (3772) Google Scholar, 17Fahrenkrog B. Aebi U. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). We performed an NCBI conserved-domain data base search against RBEL1 and found that the majority of the proteins showing highest homology to RBEL1 were Rab proteins in the Ras superfamily (supplemental Figs. 2 and 3). We also performed a Pairwise alignment to compare RBEL1 with the canonical Ras GTPase, H-Ras, and found that RBEL1, within its GTP binding domain, was 33% homologous to H-Ras GTPase. A similar degree of homology between H-Ras and several other members of Ras superfamily has been reported including, for example, Rnd2 (34%), RHOT1 (38%), Sar1 (35%), and Arf (33%). RBEL1, however, did not show similar homology to non-Ras family GTPases such as eEF1A, GBP1, elF5B, and Dynamin, suggesting that it belongs to the Ras superfamily. Next, we compared the RBEL1 sequence with that of other members in various Ras subfamilies including Ras, Ran, Rab, Rho/Rac, and Arf/Sar subfamilies and found RBEL1 to show a higher degree of homology to the Rab (31-34%) and Ras (30-33%) subfamily members than with the Rac/Rho (26-28%) and Arf/Sar (27-29%) subfamily proteins. Overall, because clearly more Rab proteins align with RBEL1, we have named it so (Rab-like protein 1); however, RBEL1 also harbors several unique features not present in members of these subfamilies. For example, both isoforms of RBEL1 deviate from the Rab canonical GTP binding consensus sequences in the third (DXXG(K/Q)→ DXXDK), fourth (NKXD→ NYXD), and fifth (EXSAX→ EXSMX) GDP/GTP binding domains (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B, and supplemental Table 1). Comparison of the GTP binding domains of RBEL1 with those of other Ras superfamily proteins is shown in supplemental Table 1. Thus, RBEL1 is a novel protein that belongs to a unique and perhaps new subfamily within the Ras superfamily. We also noted that both isoforms of RBEL1 contain proline-rich domains within their central regions (RBEL1A, amino acids 293-397, and RBEL1B, amino acids 293-363). Proline-rich regions have been implicated in protein-protein interactions, subcellular localization, and are often the recognition site for binding SH3 (Src homology 3) and WW domain-containing proteins (18Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar, 19Macias M.J. Wiesner S. Sudol M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In addition, the A isoform also harbors a number of putative nuclear localization signals at its C terminus (shown in bold and shaded in supplemental Fig. 1A) that are absent in RBEL1B. To determine RBEL1 expression and tissue distribution, we performed Northern blot analyses, and as shown in Fig. 1C, the RBEL1 cDNA-specific probe (pan RBEL1 probe), which was expected to detect both A and B isoforms, recognized a predominant transcript of ∼3.6 kilobases in all the tissues examined with stronger signals seen in lung, skeletal muscle, heart, stomach, and testis. The fact that the pan RBEL1 probe predominantly detected ∼3.6-kilobase RBEL1-specific transcripts that corresponded to the RBEL1A isoform, it was likely that RBEL1A was the more abundant variant. To further confirm that the ∼3.6-kilobase transcripts detected by the pan probe were indeed RBEL1A, we next utilized a RBEL1A-specific probe to do Northern blotting. A cDNA probe designated as Probe 2 that corresponds to the region specific for RBEL1A but is absent in RBEL1B (Fig. 1A) was prepared, and Northern analysis was performed on a number of cell lines including MCF-7, T47D, MDA231, MDA468, and Hs578T breast cancer cells and MCF10A normal breast cells as well as RKO colon cancer cells. Fig. 1D, upper panel, shows that the RBEL1A-specific probe detected the ∼3.6-kilobase transcripts in all cell lines, with MCF10A normal breast cells exhibiting a low level of expression. The same blot was also probed (after stripping the first probe and then waiting for the signals of first probe to decay) with the pan RBEL1 probe, and as shown in Fig. 1D, lower panel, the pan RBEL1 probe also predominantly detected the samesize RBEL1A signal. These results, therefore, indicate that RBEL1A is the predominant isoform, whereas the RBEL1B transcripts, not detected by Northern blotting, exists in low abundance. Next, we performed the more sensitive RT-PCR to compare the expression of the A and B isoforms, and as shown in Fig. 1E, the RBEL1B mRNA was indeed expressed at a low level compared with RBEL1A mRNA. Taken together, these results suggest that the RBEL1A transcripts exist in high abundance and that the A isoform is the predominant variant. RBEL1A Is Overexpressed in Human Breast Cancer—Because we noted that RBEL1A expression was higher in the breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, T47D, MDA231, MDA468, and Hs578T) than in normal breast epithelial cells MCF10A (Fig. 1D), next we examined RBEL1A expression in primary breast tissues using cancer profiling arrays representing tumor and matching normal tissue mRNAs of 13 different human tissue types including breast, uterus, colon, stomach, ovary, lung, kidney, rectum, and thyroid. We found that RBEL1A was predominantly overexpressed in primary breast tumors. Fig. 2A shows the results of RBEL1A expression in cancer profiling arrays of representative breast samples, and the overall results for various malignancies are summarized in Fig. 2B. As is shown (Fig. 2, A and B), 32 of 48 (67%) breast tumors exhibited increased expression of RBEL1A mRNA when compared with their matched normal tissues from the same individuals. A relatively fewer number of samples representing colon, gastric, ovarian, and uterine cancers also displayed increased RBEL1A mRNA expression (Fig. 2B). However, we did not find any considerable changes in RBEL1A mRNA expression in primary tumors of the thyroid, prostate, rectum, and lung compared with their corresponding matched normal tissues (data not shown), indicating that RBEL1A was specifically overexpressed in human breast cancers. Ubiquitin expression signals (provided by the vendor) were used as loading controls to ensure comparable loading for the cancer profiling arrays. We also performed Northern blot analysis using four pairs of matched breast normal and tumor samples (three adenocarcinomas and one benign fibroadenoma), and the results revealed that RBEL1A mRNA expression was elevated in all three breast carcinomas (Fig. 2C, lanes 1, 3, and 4) but with no obvious changes in the benign fibroadenoma (Fig. 2C, lane 2). Furthermore, examination of the Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) data base to explore the expression profile of RBEL1A-specific tags revealed that in general, breast cancer tissues expressed much higher levels of RBEL1A mRNA than the normal breast tissues. Together these results indicate that RBEL1A overexpression occurs at a high frequency in human breast cancer and that altered RBEL1A expression and consequently its function could be a common feature of breast cancer. RBEL1A Protein Expression and O-Linked Glycosylation—To study the expression of RBEL1 at protein level, anti-RBEL1 antibodies were generated. Western blot analysis revealed that the endogenous RBEL1 detected by the anti-RBEL1 antibodies (Fig. 3A, lanes 1-7) migrated as four major species of ∼125, ∼110, ∼100, and ∼80 kDa (Fig. 3A) with the 125-kDa species being the predominant one. To further confirm the specificity of the anti-RBEL1 antibody, the expression of HA-tagged RBEL1A was analyzed either by anti-HA Western blotting of the total cell lysates (Fig. 3B) or by anti-HA immunoprecipitation of the cell lysates from HA-RBEL1A-expressing cells followed by anti-RBEL1 Western blotting (Fig. 3C). As shown in Fig. 3, the band pattern of exogenous HA-RBEL1A (Fig. 3, B and C) is largely consistent with that of the endogenous RBEL1 protein detected by anti-RBEL1 antibody (Fig. 3A), thus, confirming the specificity of the anti-RBEL1 antibody. We also used the RBEL1 RNA-mediated interference knockdown approach to further assess the specificity of anti-RBEL1 antibody. Results shown in Fig. 3D indicate that, although control scramble small interfering RNA had no effect on the expression of RBEL1A protein detected by the anti-RBEL1 antibody, RBEL1-specific knockdown of endogenous RBEL1 in RKO cells remarkably suppressed the endogenous RBEL1A protein expression. These results, thus, also confirm the specificity of anti-RBEL1 antibody. RBEL1A has 729 amino acids with predicted molecular masses of ∼80 kDa, which is less than the molecular mass of the ∼125-, ∼110-, and ∼100-kDa species detected by Western blotting. Computer-based glycosylation prediction revealed that the RBEL1A protein harbors a number of potential O-linked glycosylation sites but no N-linked glycosylation sites. Next, we sought to investigate whether the differential molecular mass of the RBEL1A was due to post-translational events involving O-linked N-acetylglucosamine glycosylation. NAHase is an enzyme that is known to hydrolyze O-linked glycan chains (20Zhu W. Leber B. Andrews D.W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5999-6007Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We, therefore, used NAHase to digest the RBEL1A protein to determine whether RBEL1A was indeed a glycosylated protein. Fig. 3E, left panel, shows that the molecular mass of the ∼125-kDa species was significantly reduced in the cell lysates digested with NAHase (lane 2) when compared with the undigested sample (lane 1), and there was a concomitant increase in the abundance of molecular species in the ∼110-kDa to less than 100-kDa range (Fig. 3E, compare lanes 1 and 2). Interestingly, we did not find any noticeable increase in the abundance of ∼80-kDa species in the NAHase-digested sample (lane 2). These results, therefore, suggest that the differential molecular mass of RBEL1A noted on Western blotting appear to occur at least in part due to O-linked glycosylation. However, it is possible that post-translational modifications other than glycosylation may also contribute to the differential molecular mass of RBEL1A. We also sought to investigate the glycosylation status of RBEL1B that contains 520 amino acids and has a predicted mass of 57 kDa. Given that endogenous RBEL1B isoform exists in low abundance and is not detectable by Western blotting, we therefore used vector expressing HA-tagged RBEL1B. The HA-tagged RBEL1B expressed from this construct has a predicted molecular mass of 62 kDa, and we noted that exogenous RBEL1B also displayed multiple bands ranging from ∼62 to ∼75 kDa, with a major band migrating at ∼75 kDa. However, unlike RBEL1A, treatment of RBEL1B with NAHase did not alter the HA-RBEL1B protein band pattern (Fig. 3E, right panel, compare lane 1 and lane 2). These results, therefore, suggest that RBEL1B may not be modified by O-linked glycans. The Nucleocytoplasmic Localization of RBEL1—To determine the subcellular localization of RBEL1, we tagged both isoforms with GFP in a mammalian expression vector and analyzed their localization in a number of cell lines including MCF10A (normal breast), MCF-7 (breast cancer), RKO (colon cancer), and NIH3T3 (mouse fibroblasts). The results for MCF-7 human breast cancer cells presented in Fig. 4A show that although GFP alone is diffusely expressed throughout the cells including the nuclei and cytosol (Fig. 4A, a-a″), GFP-RBEL1A and GFP-RBEL1B-expressing cells displayed a different distribution (Fig. 4). For example, GFP-RBEL1A exhibited two types of distribution, (i) with the majority of the cells expressing GFP-RBEL1A predominantly in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4A, b-b″), (ii) and some cells also exhibiting a nucleocytoplasmic distribution (Fig. 4A, b-b″ and c-c″, arrows). We also quantified the number of cells exhibiting the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of exogenous RBEL1A and noted that 8 and 24 h post-transfections about 27 and 23% (means of two independent experiments) of the cells displayed nucleocytoplasmic patterns, respectively. Nucleocytoplasmic RBEL1A distribution patterns were also seen when RBEL1A was expressed in the normal breast cell line MCF10A (Fig. 4A, d-d″ and e-e″). Interestingly, amino acid sequence analysis revealed that RBEL1A harbors several putative nuclear localization signals at its C terminus (for example, PASKPRR, amino acids 501-507; KKKKKKGKEEEEKAAKK, amino acids 655-671; supplemental Fig. 1A) that may have a role in the nuclear localization of RBEL1A. To ensure that the localization of GFP-tagged RBEL1 proteins was not influenced by the size of GFP, we also generated the HA-tagged RBEL1A expression construct and analyzed its expression in MCF-7 and RKO cells. Anti-HA immunostaining performed on the HA-RBEL1A-expressing cells revealed that the distribution pattern of HA-RBEL1A was largely similar to that seen with the GFP-tagged RBEL1A (Fig. 4B, a-a″ to c-c″). The subcellular localization of GFP- and HA-tagged RBEL1B, on other hand, was predominantly nuclear but excluded from the nucleoli (Fig. 4, B, g-g″ and h-h″, and C, a-a″, b-b″, and d-d″), although a low level of distribution was noted in the cytoplasm in a punctate pattern (Fig. 4C, a and d). Using anti-RBEL1 antibodies, we also performed immunostaining to determine the distribution of endogenous RBEL1. As shown in Fig. 4D, the expression of endogenous RBEL1 in RKO cells was predominantly noted in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4D) with some cells also displaying a nucleocytoplasmic distribution (Fig. 4D, arrows). Thus, the subcellular distribution pattern of endogenous RBEL1 was similar to that noted for GFP-RBEL1A and HA-RBEL1A detected in the same cell line. The anti-RBEL1 antibody is expected to detect both RBEL1A and -B isoforms, but given that RBEL1A is the predominant isoform, whereas RBEL1B is expressed at very low levels, it is, therefore, likely that the signals detected by the anti-RBEL1 antibody mainly represent endogenous RBEL1A. We also performed cell fractionation assays to evaluate the nucleocytoplasmic localization pattern of endogenous RBEL1A. As shown in Fig. 4, E and F, higher levels of endogenous RBEL1A were detected in the cytosolic fraction, whereas modest levels of RBEL1A were seen in the nuclear fraction in MCF-7 and RKO cells. The same blots were probed for β-actin (cytoplasmic) and lamin B (nuclear) to evaluate the purity of the cytosolic and nuclear fractions (Fig. 4, E and F, lower panels). Together these results indicate that RBEL1A and RBEL1B exhibit rather unique nucleocytoplasmic expression patterns. To date, only a few GTPases are known to localize in the nucleus including Ran, Rac1, Rap1, and PIKE-A and MxB (17Fahrenkrog B. Aebi U. Nat. Rev. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W1974212065,"Notch signaling controls diverse eukaryotic differentiation processes in multiple cell types, thus demanding versatile tools with which Notch triggers downstream events. Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis has previously been shown to be one such tool with which Notch regulates the turnover of the basic helix-loophelix transcription factor, E47. Here, we show that Notch signaling also accelerated the degradation of Tal1/SCL (T cell acute leukemia 1/stem cell leukemia) protein, a basic helix-loop-helix protein involved in the development of hematopoietic, vascular, and neuronal tissues. Notch-induced Tal1/SCL degradation was mediated by ubiquitination and proteasomes. The sequence responsible for Tal1 degradation was localized to a region in the C terminus of Tal1, which is evolutionarily conserved, thus suggesting a functional significance. Analogous to the situation for E47, Notch-induced Tal1/SCL degradation not only required Skp2, a substrate-binding subunit of SCF ubiquitin ligase complexes, but also relied on CHIP, a chaperone-binding protein with a ubiquitin ligase activity. In contrast to the fact that the N-terminal tetratricopeptide region (TPR) domain of CHIP is necessary and sufficient for E47 ubiquitination and degradation, CHIP promoted Tal1 degradation with both chaperone binding and ubiquitin ligase activities, which are mediated by its TPR domain and U box, respectively. Although the TPR domain was not involved in Tal1/SCL binding, it was required for enhancing its degradation. Likewise, the ubiquitin ligase activity of CHIP was dispensable for Tal1/SCL binding but essential for degradation. These findings provide both novel mechanistic insights into the operation of cullin-based ubiquitin ligase complexes and potential means by which Notch and Tal1/SCL regulate eukaryotic development.

Signaling through Notch receptors (Notch1–4) plays a pleiotropic role in mammalian development in diverse settings ranging from the neuronal to hematopoietic systems, as well as from stem cell maintenance to terminal differentiation of specific cell types (1Artavanis-Tsakonas S.

Notch signaling is mediated by interaction with their ligands, Delta-like and Jagged, expressed on the surface of adjacent cells, which results in the cleavage of the Notch intracellular domain and its translocation into the nucleus. The intracellular domain of Notch receptors then acts as a transcription coactivator by associating with the DNA-binding subunit, RBP-Jκ (also referred to as CSL), and stimulates transcription of genes, many of which are still unknown (4Radtke F.

Given the variety of cell types and developmental stages where Notch exerts its effect, the collection of genes regulated by these receptors would have to be enormous. Alternatively, Notch signaling could directly or indirectly utilize additional cellular mechanisms to control these developmental processes.

Although the variety of ubiquitin-activating and ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes is limited, numerous E3 ligases are present to ensure substrate specificity. We have previously shown (10Nie L. Xu M. Vladimirova A. Sun X.-H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5780-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) that Notch signaling accelerates ubiquitination and degradation of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors such as E47, encoded by the E2A gene. E47 is ubiquitinated by the SCFSkp2 ubiquitin E3 ligase complexes in a MAPK-dependent manner. SCFSkp2 is a multisubunit complex consisting of cullin1, Skp1, ROC, and the substrate-binding F box protein Skp2 (11Jackson P.K. Eldridge A.G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 923-925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Among the well known substrates of SCFSkp2 are p27, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, and c-Myc (12Ganoth D. Bornstein G. Ko T.K. Larsen B. Tyers M. Pagano M. Hershko A. Nat.

Yin L.Y. Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar) has also been found to facilitate E47 ubiquitination, probably by promoting substrate association with the E3 ligase (16Huang Z. Nie L. Xu M. Sun X.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8951-8962Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Because down-regulation of RBP-Jκ by shRNA diminishes the effect of Notch on E47 degradation, it has been postulated that Notch signaling results in transcriptional activation of genes encoding proteins with positive effects on SCFSkp2 E3 ligase activities (10Nie L. Xu M. Vladimirova A. Sun X.-H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5780-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Given the diverse functions of Notch in cellular differentiation, it is very unlikely that Notch-stimulated protein ubiquitination and degradation are only reserved for E2A transcription factors. Indeed, we show here that Notch signaling also promotes the degradation of Tal1/SCL protein (called Tal1 hereafter for simplicity) through similar but not identical mechanisms. ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase tetratricopeptide region short hairpin RNA mitogen-activated protein kinase hemagglutinin Notch1 intracellular domain. ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase tetratricopeptide region short hairpin RNA mitogen-activated protein kinase hemagglutinin Notch1 intracellular domain. Tal1 was originally discovered through analyses of chromosomal translocations in samples from patients with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (17Brown L. Cheng J.T. Chen Q. Siciliano M.J. Crist W.

The physiological function of Tal1 has been delineated by examinations of either germ line or conditional knock-out mice. Germ line disruption of the Tal1 gene results in embryonic lethality because of failures in production of blood and blood vessels (20Porcher C. Swat W. Rockwell K. Fujiwara Y. Alt F.W. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1996; 86: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Deletion of the gene specifically in hematopoietic lineages reveals that Tal1 is necessary for short term hematopoietic stem cell function but dispensable for long term stem cell activity (21Curtis D.J.

This protein is also thought to play an important role in erythroid differentiation, and its overexpression directs multipotent progenitors to develop along the myeloid lineage (23Reynaud D. Ravet E.

Interestingly, Notch signaling is also thought to be involved in hematopoietic stem cell maintenance (25Burns C.E. Traver D. Mayhall E. Shepard J.L. Zon L.I. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2331-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In addition to the hematopoietic system, Tal1 is also expressed in the central nervous system (26Bradley C.K. Takano E.A.

Biol. 2005; 16: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Taken together, it is possible that post-translational modification of Tal1 induced by Notch signaling is of physiological significance. Tal1 is a basic helix-loop-helix protein but does not form homodimers (18Chen Q. Cheng J.T. Taub R. Schneider N. Buchanan G. Carroll A. Crist W. Ozanne B. Siciliano M.J. Baer R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 31Hsu H.L. Wadman I. Tsan J.T. Baer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5947-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It interacts with E47 avidly and binds DNA as heterodimers. We initially intended to address the question whether Notch signaling induces the degradation of E47 heterodimers such as the E47-Tal1 complex. To our surprise, the level of Tal1 protein diminished more dramatically than that of E47 upon Notch activation, which suggested that Notch signaling had an independent effect on Tal1 itself. Further investigation revealed that activation of Notch enhances the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of Tal1. As in the case of E47, this process involved the SCFSkp2 E3 ligase complex and depended on CHIP. However, the mechanistic details as to how these proteins acted to ubiquitinate Tal1 differed from those utilized in E47 ubiquitination. Therefore, our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of action utilized by SCFSkp2 complexes. Cell Culture, Transient Transfection, and Retroviral Infection—NIH3T3 and 293T cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Jagged1-expressing and control NIH3T3 cells were gifts from Dr. T. Kadesch (University of Pennsylvania). OP42 stromal cells were kindly provided by Dr. P. Kincade. Jurkat-E (expressing ectopic retroviral receptors) cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. Cells were cotransfected with desired constructs along with a GFP-expressing plasmid (Invitrogen) by using a calcium phosphate precipitation method. To transduce Jurkat-E cells with retroviruses, cells were spin-infected as described previously (10Nie L. Xu M. Vladimirova A. Sun X.-H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5780-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Infected Jurkat-E cells were then sorted based on GFP expression. Plasmids—The N-terminal Myc-tagged Tal1 construct was created by inserting a HindIII-XbaI fragment into the pRc/CMV vector as described for the HA-tagged Tal1 (32Mahajan M.A. Park S.T. Sun X.-H. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2343-2350PubMed Google Scholar). This construct was used as the parental vector for all mutants, which were generated by PCR with appropriate primers amplifying the region included in the AscI-XbaI fragment at the 3′ end of the cDNA. N1-IC cloned in pcDNA3 and retroviral vectors, as well as the HA-ubiquitin construct, was described previously (10Nie L. Xu M. Vladimirova A. Sun X.-H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5780-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The HPC4-tagged CHIP and its mutant constructs were detailed by Huang et al. (16Huang Z. Nie L. Xu M. Sun X.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8951-8962Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Generation and validation of shRNA constructs were described previously (10Nie L. Xu M. Vladimirova A. Sun X.-H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5780-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 16Huang Z. Nie L. Xu M. Sun X.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8951-8962Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—For immunoblot analyses, cells were collected 36 h post-transfection and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS in phosphatebuffered saline) plus a mixture of protease inhibitors. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. For immunoprecipitation assays, transfected cells or transduced Jurkat cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and a mixture of protease inhibitors). The resulting supernatants were pre-cleared with protein A-agarose beads and incubated with 5 μg of antibodies against Skp2 or 2 μl of anti-Tal1 serum for 4 h. The precipitates were collected with protein A-agarose beads and washed three times. Bound proteins were released from beads by boiling in SDS loading buffer. Antibodies used for immunoblotting analyses for GFP, tubulin, and Skp2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Tal1 serum was generated by our laboratory by immunizing rabbits with recombinant Tal1 (33Park S.T. Sun X.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7030-7037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against Notch1 and Myc and HA tags were from culture supernatants of hybridoma cell lines, bTAN20, 9E10, and 12CA5. In Vivo Ubiquitination Assay—293T cells were transfected with appropriate constructs. Twenty-four hours later, cells were treated with 10 μm MG-132 for 4 h. Retrovirus-transduced Jurkat-E cells were treated similarly. Anti-Tal1 serum was then used for immunoprecipitation, and the precipitates were resolved on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and probed for polyubiquitinated Tal1 with the anti-HA monoclonal antibody. The same membrane was re-probed with the anti-Myc antibody for Tal1. Notch Signaling Induces Ubiquitin-mediated and Proteasome-dependent Degradation of Tal1—To examine the effect of activated Notch1 receptor on Tal1 degradation, we cotransfected into NIH3T3 cells a construct expressing human Tal1 cDNA with increasing amounts of plasmids producing the N1-IC. A constant amount of GFP-expressing construct was also cotransfected to serve as controls for transfection efficiency in each sample. Immunoblotting assays of whole cell extracts revealed a gradual reduction of Tal1 level as the amount of N1-IC increased (Fig. 1A). However, the level of GFP remained unchanged. This reduction was reversed by addition of the MG-132 proteasome inhibitor to transfected cells, suggesting that Tal1 proteins were degraded by the proteasome in the presence of Notch signaling (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, expression of shRNA against RBP-Jκ restored the level of Tal1 in cells cotransfected with Tal1 and N1-IC to that in cells expressing Tal1 alone (Fig. 1C). In contrast, a control shRNA construct containing a random sequence had no such effect. Taken together, these results suggest that signaling through Notch pathways induces ubiquitin-mediated and proteasome-dependent degradation of Tal1, likely by transcriptional activation of genes involved in these processes. Next, we tested the effect of activation of endogenous Notch receptors on levels of Tal1 proteins present in Jurkat-E T cells. When Jurkat-E cells were cocultured with stromal cells expressing a Notch ligand, Jagged1, endogenous Tal1 levels dramatically decreased compared with coculturing on control stromal cells (Fig. 2A). Prevention of Notch activation with a γ-secretase inhibitor significantly increased Tal1 levels in cells treated with Jagged1 but had no effect on control cells. Likewise, expression of N1-IC in Jurkat-E cells caused a marked reduction in the level of endogenous Tal1, which was rescued by the proteasome inhibitor, MG-132 (Fig. 2B). We also performed in vivo ubiquitination assay by immunoprecipitating endogenous Tal1 from vectorand N1-IC-transduced Jurkat-E cells. The precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting for ubiquitin. We found that the levels of ubiquitinated Tal1 in N1-IC-expressing cells were much higher than those in control cells (Fig. 2C). In addition to Jurkat cells, we examined Tal1 levels in primary bone marrow cells enriched for hematopoietic progenitors and myeloid cells obtained by depletion with antibodies against B220, CD19, CD2, and CD8 expressed on lymphocytes. When these cells were then exposed to stromal cells expressing Notch ligands, Jagged1 or Delta-like-1, Tal1 levels decreased obviously compared with those in cells cultured with vector control stromal cells (Fig. 2D). Collectively, these results emphasize the physiological relevance of Notch-induced Tal1 degradation. Determining the Sequence in Tal1 Protein Responsible for Its Degradation—Alignment of Tal1 sequences from various species revealed that the highest sequence conservation resides within the basic helix-loop-helix motif, which is expected because this motif mediates the most important function of Tal1, namely, DNA binding and dimerization. The second region with extensive evolutionary conservation lies in the C terminus of the protein (Fig. 3A), which we suspected of having an important function. To test if this region mediated Tal1 degradation, we initially deleted the entire region to generate the construct, del1, and found that this mutant was completely resistant to Notch-induced degradation when tested in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 3B). Refined analyses of the C terminus showed that truncation of the last 23 amino acids (del2) (Fig. 3B), which are less conserved across species, had no effect on the susceptibility of Tal1 to Notch-induced degradation. In contrast, deletion in any part of the highly conserved region from amino acids 277 to 308 abolished Notch-induced degradation (del3 to del5) (Fig. 3B). Computer-aided analyses identified two potential serine phosphorylation sites within this region (34Xue Y. Zhou F. Zhu M. Ahmed K. Chen G. Yao X. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W184-W187Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These sites can be recognized by MAPKs, cyclin-dependent kinases, and protein kinase B. To evaluate whether these sites are important for Tal1 degradation, alanine substitution mutations were introduced to each of the sites to create constructs S284A and S300A. Expression of N1-IC accelerated the degradation of S284A but not of S300A, suggesting that phosphorylation at Ser-300 may be involved in Tal1 degradation (Fig. 3B). In addition, a tyrosine residue is also present in this highly conserved region and can potentially be phosphorylated by various tyrosine kinases. When this residue was replaced with alanine (Y304A), the mutant was resistant to Notch-induced degradation. However, changing it to phenylalanine (Y304F) had no effect. Because the tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation prevents phosphorylation but does not alter the structure of the protein, this result suggests that the tyrosine residue is important for maintaining the proper conformation of the protein necessary for ubiquitination and degradation. This is consistent with the fact that some non-mammalian species have a phenylalanine residue at this position (Fig. 3A). Notch-induced Tal1 Ubiquitination Potentially Involves SCFSkp2 E3 Ligase Complexes—Because Notch has been shown to enhance E47 ubiquitination by SCFSkp2 E3 ligase complexes, we tested whether Tal1 ubiquitination utilized the same machinery. To determine whether down-regulation of Skp2 expression diminishes the effect of N1-IC, constructs expressing shRNA against Skp2 or control were introduced together with the Tal1-expressing construct into NIH3T3 cells with or without N1-IC. Expression of Skp2 but not control shRNA rescued Tal1 proteins in N1-IC-expressing cells (Fig. 4A). The knockdown effect of Skp2 shRNA was confirmed by cotransfection of the shRNA constructs with a T7-tagged Skp2 construct. Reduction in T7-Skp2 levels by Skp2 shRNA, but not control shRNA, suggested the efficacy of the shRNA construct (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, the Tal1-expressing construct was also cotransfected with the shRNA constructs into NIH3T3 cell lines stably transfected with vector control or Jagged1-expressing constructs. Because Jagged1 is a ligand of Notch receptors, endogenous Notch signaling was achieved by allowing cells to be in close contact. The Skp2 but not control shRNA alleviated the degradation of Tal1 in cells expressing Jagged1 (Fig. 4B). In contrast, it had no effect on control cells. These results suggest that Notch-induced Tal1 degradation involves the function of Skp2, likely through the SCFSkp2 complex. Next, we assessed the ability of Skp2 to promote Tal1 degradation by coexpressing different amounts of Skp2 together with a constant amount of Tal1. Tal1 levels decreased proportionally to amounts of Skp2 expressed (Fig. 4C). Consistent with this finding, we also detected interaction between Tal1 and Skp2 in coimmunoprecipitation assays. In this experiment, Tal1 was coexpressed with or without Skp2 and N1-IC in 293T cells. Whole cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against Skp2 or with rabbit IgG. The precipitates were analyzed by probing for Tal1 or Skp2 (Fig. 4D). In the absence of exogenous Skp2, a small amount of Tal1 coprecipitated with endogenous Skp2. Overexpression of Skp2 increased the amount of Tal1 brought down, but addition of N1-IC did not further increase the amount of Tal1 coprecipitated. These data suggest that Skp2 is in complex with Tal1 but N1-IC does not play a significant role in enhancing the association between Tal1 and Skp2. CHIP Is Involved in Notch-induced Tal1 Degradation—CHIP has previously been shown to facilitate Notch-induced E47 degradation (16Huang Z. Nie L. Xu M. Sun X.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8951-8962Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We therefore explored the possibility that CHIP also promotes Tal1 degradation. Coexpression of increasing amounts of CHIP with Tal1 dramatically reduced the Tal1 level to that of N1-IC-expressing cells (Fig. 5A). Conversely, downregulation of endogenous CHIP with shRNA rescued Tal1 proteins in N1-IC-expressing cells but had no effect on cells transfected with Tal1 alone (Fig. 5B). The control shRNA did not alter Tal1 levels in the absence or presence of N1-IC. As controls for the efficiency of CHIP shRNA, cotransfection experiments were performed with the CHIP expression construct, and CHIP levels were found to be reduced by its shRNA but not controls. Together, these data established the involvement of CHIP in Notch-induced Tal1 degradation. To explain how CHIP facilitates Tal1 degradation, we examined the interaction between CHIP and Tal1 in coimmunoprecipitation assays by cotransfecting CHIP with wild-type and mutant Tal1 constructs into 293T cells. Immunoprecipitation was carried out with anti-Tal1 antibodies, and the precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting for CHIP (Fig. 5C). Wildtype Tal1 bound avidly to CHIP, but the del4 and del5 mutants, which are resistant to Notch-induced degradation, exhibited much lower affinity for CHIP. Interestingly, the S300A mutant, although insensitive to Notch-mediated turnover, was capable of binding to CHIP, suggesting that interaction with CHIP is independent of phosphorylation, which is analogous to the situation found in E47 and CHIP association. We next evaluated the role of CHIP in Tal1 ubiquitination. Cotransfection of Tal1 with CHIP did not significantly enhance Tal1 ubiquitination (Fig. 5D). However, expression of CHIP dramatically potentiated Notch-induced ubiquitination of Tal1 (Fig. 5D). These results suggest that CHIP, although an E3 ligase itself, facilitates Tal1 ubiquitination mediated by other E3 ligases such as SCFSkp2. CHIP is a 33-kDa protein consisting of an N-terminal chaperonebinding TPR and C-terminal U box with a ubiquitin ligase activity (35Jiang J. Ballinger C.A. Wu Y. Dai Q. Cyr D.M. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42938-42944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 36Xu W. Marcu M. Yuan X. Mimnaugh E. Patterson C. Neckers L. Proc. Natl. Acad.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanisms by which CHIP stimulates Tal1 degradation, a series of CHIP mutants were examined for their abilities to promote Tal1 degradation. Constructs containing either the TPR or U box portions of CHIP were incapable of causing Tal1 degradation (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, point mutations K31A and H261A/P270A, which abolish the ability of CHIP to interact with chaperones (36Xu W. Marcu M. Yuan X. Mimnaugh E. Patterson C. Neckers L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12847-12852Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) or the ubiquitin ligase activity (38Hatakeyama S. Yada M. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Nakayama K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33111-33120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), respectively, also failed to enhance Tal1 degradation (Fig. 6A), thus suggesting that both functions of CHIP are necessary for Tal1 turnover. To evaluate the ability of wildtype and mutant CHIP proteins to associate with Tal1, coimmunoprecipitation assays were carried out in 293T cells cotransfected with Tal1 and CHIP constructs (Fig. 6B). Whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against Tal1 or with control IgG. Precipitates were analyzed for CHIP and Tal1. Tal1 was found to associate with wild-type CHIP, U box, K31A, and H261A/P270A constructs but not the TPR construct, which includes the N-terminal 191 amino acids. Therefore, the Tal1 interacting domain was localized to the C-terminal 113 amino acids. However, mutations abolishing the U box ubiquitin ligase activity did not interfere with Tal1 binding, even though they eliminated the ability of CHIP to accelerate Tal1 degradation. Because CHIP did not stimulate Tal1 ubiquitination by itself (Fig. 5D), its ubiquitin ligase activity may be necessary for other functions. We report here that activation of Notch signaling pathways accelerates Tal1 degradation through ubiquitin-mediated and proteasome-dependent pathways. This finding adds Tal1 to the list of proteins whose turnover can be stimulated by Notch, which includes E47, p27, and Jak proteins (10Nie L. Xu M. Vladimirova A. Sun X.-H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5780-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). 3L. Nie and X.-H. Sun, unpublished data. How Notch enhances the ubiquitination and degradation of these proteins is an important issue to address. We have evidence to suggest that Notch-induced degradation of these proteins depends on its ability to activate transcription of downstream target genes because shRNA-mediated down-regulation of RBP-Jκ, the DNA-binding partner of Notch intracellular domains, diminishes the effect of Notch (Fig. 1C) (10Nie L. Xu M. Vladimirova A. Sun X.-H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5780-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Although such downstream genes have not yet been identified, they likely encode products that influence ubiquitination reactions controlled by common mechanisms shared by these disparate substrates. Cullin-based E3 ubiquitin ligases are involved in the ubiquitination of all the substrates mentioned above even though different substratebinding subunits and different cullin molecules may be present in the E3 ligase complexes (10Nie L. Xu M. Vladimirova A. Sun X.-H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5780-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 12Ganoth D. Bornstein G. Ko T.K. Larsen B. Tyers M. Pagano M. Hershko A. Nat.

Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3055-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems reasonable for Notch-induced genes to intervene at this point. Data obtained using shRNA against CHIP suggest that Notch-induced Tal1 degradation depends on CHIP, but Notch signaling does not cause transcriptional activation of CHIP expression (data not shown). Comparison between the mechanisms involved in Tal1 and E47 ubiquitination reveals several similarities as well as differences. Like E47, Tal1 is found to associate with Skp2, and its ubiquitination probably involves SCFSkp2. Furthermore, CHIP not only facilitates E47 but also Tal1 degradation. However, the interacting domains in CHIP are different for E47 and Tal1. Previous studies (16Huang Z. Nie L. Xu M. Sun X.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8951-8962Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) showed that the TPR domain is sufficient for CHIP to interact with E47 and promote its degradation. In contrast, the TPR domain was not involved in association with Tal1 but was necessary for its turnover (Fig. 6). Instead, the C-terminal portion including the U box was responsible for Tal1 binding. Point mutations that abolish the ubiquitin ligase activity elicited by the U box (38Hatakeyama S. Yada M. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Nakayama K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33111-33120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) did not interfere with its association with Tal1, suggesting that the interaction was independent of the ubiquitin ligase activity of CHIP. Likewise, a point mutation disrupting the interaction between CHIP and chaperones like Hsc70 (36Xu W. Marcu M. Yuan X. Mimnaugh E. Patterson C. Neckers L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12847-12852Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) also allows Tal1 binding, which led to the conclusion that CHIP and Tal1 association was not mediated by chaperones. Despite the abilities of these point mutants of CHIP to interact with Tal1, they were not able to promote Tal1 degradation, suggesting that both chaperone binding and U box-mediated ubiquitin ligase activity are required. This notion is consistent with the previous data that CHIP binds to Skp2 via Hsc70 (16Huang Z. Nie L. Xu M. Sun X.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8951-8962Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, failure to interact with Hsc70 could prevent CHIP from bringing Tal1 to Skp2. CHIP has also been shown to directly associate with cullin1 (16Huang Z. Nie L. Xu M. Sun X.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8951-8962Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which is useful for recruiting a pre-ubiquitination complex consisting of Skp2, Hsc70, CHIP, and Tal1 to the remainder of the SCF complexes (Fig. 7). The ubiquitin ligase activity of CHIP also appears to be crucial for Tal1 degradation. Based on the data shown in Fig. 5D, it is unlikely that CHIP directly initiates Tal1 ubiquitination as it does to other molecules (37Murata S. Minami Y. Minami M. Chiba T. Tanaka K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 41Connell P. Ballinger C.A. Jiang J. Wu Y. Thompson L.J. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 42Meacham G.C. Patterson C. Zhang W. Younger J.M. Cyr D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Rather, it may cooperate with other E3 ligases in the polyubiquitination reactions, which is sometimes considered to be mediated by the function of E4 ligases (43Imai Y. Soda M. Hatakeyama S. Akagi T. Hashikawa T. Nakayama K.I. Takahashi R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Alternatively, CHIP could attach ubiquitin to other proteins involved in Tal1 ubiquitination and enhance their activity. Thus, CHIP likely plays an integral role in the ubiquitination reactions mediated by SCFSkp2 complexes, creating a scenario where multiple ubiquitin ligases are present in cullin-based E3 complexes. Another distinction between Notch-induced E47 and Tal1 degradation is the dependence on MAPK activities. Inhibitors of MAPK/extracellular signal-related kinase kinase-1 (MEK1) inhibit Notch-induced E47 (10Nie L. Xu M. Vladimirova A. Sun X.-H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5780-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 44King A.M. Van der Put E. Blomberg B.B. Riley R.L. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 3521-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) but not Tal1 degradation (data not shown). However, this does not mean that phosphorylation of Tal1 is not required for its degradation. The S300A mutation, which replaces a serine residue in a potential phosphorylation site with alanine, renders the protein resistant to Notch-induced degradation (Fig. 3). This would suggest that phosphorylation at this site is important for Tal1 degradation. Incidentally, no Skp2 substrate has been found to be ubiquitinated without phosphorylation. Because multiple kinases, including cyclindependent kinase, p38, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), can all recognize this site, it is not surprising that incubation with inhibitors of any one kinase did not prevent Notch-induced Tal1 degradation (data not shown). The Tal1 sequence responsible for its degradation shares no significant similarity with those for E47 and p27 degradation. This is probably due to the different interfaces utilized to bind to molecules facilitating their ubiquitination. For example, the TPR domain of CHIP is important for associating with E47, whereas the U box region interacts with Tal1. Likewise, Cks1 is known to assist p27 binding to Skp2, but it has no effect on Tal1 degradation (data not shown). Despite this disparity, the sequence for Tal1 degradation is highly conserved across species from amphibian to man. The length of the conserved sequence and degree of homology, although somewhat shorter and lower, are comparable with those of the basic helix-loop-helix domain responsible for DNA binding and dimerization, thus arguing for a biological significance of this degradation-responsive sequence. Although the scenario where Notch-induced Tal1 degradation plays a biological role has not been identified, plenty of situations exist where both Notch and Tal1 are involved. For example, both Notch and Tal1 regulate the development of hematopoietic, vascular, and neuronal tissues (2Chiba S. Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 2437-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 3Ohishi K. Katayama N. Shiku H. Varnum-Finney B. Bernstein I.D. Semin. Cell Dev.

However, detailed investigation is necessary to precisely determine the cell type and stage in development where Notch and Tal1 coexist and evaluate the consequence of Notchinduced Tal1 degradation in these settings. Nevertheless, given the essential functions both Notch and Tal1 have in eukaryotic development, Notch-induced Tal1 degradation is likely an important mechanism by which cellular differentiation programs are coordinated.

This gene is regulated by the elongation factor DSIF (DRB sensitivity-inducing factor) under basal and NF-κB-activated states by two distinct mechanisms.

In mammalian cells, genes targeted by NF-κB are subjected to differential regulation at the elongation level by P-TEFb and DSIF (10Ainbinder E. Amir-Zilberstein L. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Dikstein R.

NF-κB is a family of transcription factors central to cellular response to a broad range of extracellular signals including inflammatory cytokines, tumor promoters, and chemotherapeutic agents (for review see Refs. 14Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2470) Google Scholar and 15Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar). We have investigated the mechanism underlying the rapid transcriptional induction that occurs in some NF-κB target genes. We showed that the promoters of these genes are bound by the general transcription machinery prior to stimulation of NF-κB, and upon induction NF-κB acts to increase the rate of reinitiation (16Ainbinder E. Revach M. Wolstein O. Moshonov S. Diamant N. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6354-6362Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Using the NF-κB-responsive gene A20 as a model, we found that the basal A20 transcription (before stimulation) is repressed at the level of elongation in a promoter-dependent manner. Immunodepletion experiments in vitro and RNA interference (RNAi) experiments in vivo indicated that the elongation inhibition is conferred by DSIF, which in this system acts in the absence of DRB and without NELF (10Ainbinder E. Amir-Zilberstein L. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2444-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Dissection of the A20 promoter led to the identification of ELIE (elongation inhibitory element), an element that mediates DSIF inhibition under basal conditions (10Ainbinder E. Amir-Zilberstein L. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2444-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The identity of this novel type of elongation repressor and the mechanism by which it regulates the activity of DSIF are unknown. We also examined DSIF regulation of A20 transcription in NF-κB stimulated cells. Surprisingly, we found that inhibition of A20 gene transcription by DSIF persists but is now regulated by NF-κB rather than ELIE (10Ainbinder E. Amir-Zilberstein L. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2444-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus the A20 gene is regulated by DSIF under basal and NF-κB-activated states by two distinct mechanisms. Most recently we demonstrated that regulation of NF-κB target genes by DSIF upon NF-κB induction is not a general phenomenon but is dependent on a promoter configuration that includes an NF-κB enhancer in a context of a TATA-less core promoter (11Amir-Zilberstein L. Ainbinder E. Toube L. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 5246-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). By contrast, DSIF is released from TATA-containing NF-κB target genes, and these are positively regulated by the elongation factor P-TEFb. Converting a TATA-less to a TATA promoter is sufficient to switch the regulation of NF-κB from DSIF to P-TEFb. Accumulation of either DSIF or P-TEFb involves NF-κB itself and the formation of distinct initiation complexes (TFIID-dependent or -independent) on each of the two types of core promoter (11Amir-Zilberstein L. Ainbinder E. Toube L. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 5246-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated further the regulation of transcription elongation of the A20 gene by DSIF under basal and stimulated conditions mediated by ELIE and NF-κB, respectively. Our results suggest that an E-box-binding protein, most likely USF1, mediates DSIF inhibition and recruitment under basal conditions. Once NF-κB is induced, the E-box is no longer involved in DSIF inhibition. Consistent with that, USF1 is displaced from the promoter by NF-κB. These findings highlight a dynamic exchange between USF1 and NF-κB according to the physiological state of the cell to regulate transcription elongation. Plasmid Constructions—A20, A20 mut-κBs, IκBα, 2κB(A20)-α-actin, 2κB(A20)-TK, and DSIF RNAi have been described previously (10Ainbinder E. Amir-Zilberstein L. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2444-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 16Ainbinder E. Revach M. Wolstein O. Moshonov S. Diamant N. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6354-6362Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). An A20 promoter E-box mutant (mutE-box) was generated by replacing the HindIII-PmlI fragment corresponding to –234 to –74 of the A20 promoter with a PCR fragment, which included a three-nucleotide substitution in the E-box. Transient Transfection Assays and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—293T cells (human embryonic kidney fibroblasts) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were performed using the standard CaPO4 method. To avoid basal NF-κB activity, cells were kept from reaching confluence and replated no more than nine times. For reporter assays, subconfluent cells were transfected in a 24-well plate using 1.1 μg of pSuper or DSIF RNAi plasmid, 20 ng of the luciferase reporter plasmids, 1 ng of RSV-Renilla, 10 ng of CMV-GFP, and, where indicated, 1 ng of p65/RelA. 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested and their luciferase activities were measured. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays of transfected and endogenous promoters were carried out as described (11Amir-Zilberstein L. Ainbinder E. Toube L. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 5246-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The ChIP data were quantified by densitometric analysis using Quantity One one-dimensional analysis software (Bio-Rad). Protein Analysis—Whole-cell extract preparation and immunoblot assays were performed as described previously (11Amir-Zilberstein L. Ainbinder E. Toube L. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 5246-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For nuclear extracts, 293T cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in buffer A containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. The lysates were incubated for 20 min on ice and pipetted three times. Cytoplasmic proteins were removed by discarding the supernatant after centrifugation. The nuclei pellet was resuspended in buffer C containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin and was incubated for 15 min on a rotator wheel at 4 °C followed by centrifugation and collection of the supernatant containing the nuclear proteins. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described above from 293T cells that were untreated or treated with 20 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) for 1 or 4 h. Binding reactions were performed using 3–5 μg of protein in a 20-μl reaction volume consisting of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 μg bovine serum albumin, and 1 μg of poly(dI·dC). Samples were incubated at room temperature for 10 min, and then the appropriate 32P-end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was added for an additional 10 min. DNA-protein complexes were resolved using nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. For competition, a 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligo was added. For antibody supershift experiments, 1 μl of specific antibody was added to the binding reaction. Characterization of ELIE-binding Proteins—Under basal conditions, transcription directed by the A20 promoter is inhibited at the level of elongation by DSIF. The DSIF inhibition was shown to be mediated by an upstream promoter element, termed ELIE, located at –74 to –67 relative to the transcription start site (Fig. 1A) (10Ainbinder E. Amir-Zilberstein L. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2444-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To characterize the transcription factors that bind ELIE we employed the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. For a probe we used an oligonucleotide corresponding to –83 to –48 of the A20 promoter. This region contains the ELIE and an overlapping E-box as well as an adjacent NF-κB site (Fig. 1B, A20 WT). This probe was reacted with a nuclear extract prepared from unstimulated 293T cells. The results show that under basal conditions two protein-DNA complexes, designated A and B, are formed (Fig. 1C, lane 2). To characterize these complexes, competition experiments were carried out. As can be seen in Fig. 1C, lane 3, both complexes were competed with by an excess of cold DNA that was used as a probe. Neither complex was competed with by an oligo containing only the two NF-κB binding sites of the A20 promoter (Fig. 1C, lane 4) suggesting that they do not comprise NF-κB, a result consistent with the extract being prepared from unstimulated cells. We next used an oligo containing mutations in ELIE (Fig. 1B, mutELIE) in competition experiments. This mutant failed to compete for either complex (Fig. 1D, lane 3). Because the mutELIE also destroys the overlapping E-box, we synthesized another oligo in which the E-box is mutated but ELIE remains intact (Fig. 1B, mutE-box). This oligo effectively competed with the faster migrating complex B but not with the slow migrating complex A (Fig. 1D, lane 4). These results suggest that complex A is an E-box-binding protein and complex B is a different protein that binds ELIE. To test this possibility, we added to the EMSA reactions antibodies against the E-box-binding proteins, USF1 and USF2, or the major NF-κB protein p65/RelA. Consistent with the competition results, complex A, but not complex B, was supershifted by USF1 antibodies, whereas p65 and USF2 antibodies had no effect on either complex (Fig. 1E, lanes 2–4). Thus USF1 appears to be the major E-box-binding protein of the A20 promoter. To analyze further complex B, an EMSA was performed with a labeled mutE-box oligo. As expected, only one complex is formed with this oligo, and it is competed with by the cold mutE-box that was used as a probe but not by an oligo in which ELIE is mutated (Fig. 1F, lanes 3 and 4). USF1 antibody had no effect on this complex (Fig. 1F, lane 5), confirming that complex B contains proteins distinct from USF1. These results suggest that the DNA element that we designated ELIE is actually composed of two overlapping binding sites, one of which is bound by the E-box protein USF1. USF1 Associates with the A20 Promoter and Is Displaced upon NF-κB Induction—To examine the interplay between ELIE-binding proteins and NF-κB we performed EMSA experiments with nuclear extracts prepared from control and TNFα-stimulated cells (TNFα is a potent inducer of NF-κB). The probe we used was, as before, the –83 to –48 oligonucleotide of the A20 promoter that contains both the ELIE region and the NF-κB site (Fig. 1B). Like the results shown in Fig. 1, under basal conditions two protein-DNA complexes are formed, both subject to competition by excess cold DNA probe (Fig. 2, lane 2). The slower migrating complex A was competed with by the oligo in which the NF-κB site is mutated (Fig. 2, lane 3, mut-κB) but not by the oligo in which E-box is mutated (Fig. 2, lane 4, mutE-box), and it was supershifted by USF1 antibody confirming that it is USF1 (Fig. 2, lane 5). One h after induction with TNFα, the complexes (Fig. 2, lane 6) were competed with by the DNA probe (Fig. 2, lane 7), but surprisingly, complex A was not competed with by the mut-κB oligo as had occurred before stimulation (Fig. 2, compare lane 8 with lane 3). The complexes were now efficiently competed with by the mutE-box oligo (Fig. 2, lane 9), and no supershift was observed with USF1 antibodies (Fig. 2, lane 10). Similar results were observed after a 4-h induction with TNFα (Fig. 2, lanes 11–14). The TNFα-induced complex A reacted with the NF-κB p65 antibody (Fig. 2, lanes 17 and 20), suggesting that the composition of complex A changed from USF1 to NF-κB. Thus upon NF-κB induction by TNFα, USF1 is displaced from the promoter. To examine further the association of USF1 with the A20 promoter under basal and NF-κB-activated states, 293T cells were transfected with an A20 promoter-reporter plasmid treated with TNFα for 1 h to induce NF-κB and then subjected to ChIP assay using antibodies against pol II, USF1, p65/RelA, the p160 subunit of DSIF, and a nonrelevant antibody as a control. Under basal conditions, pol II and DSIF constitutively bind the A20 promoter (Fig. 3A) consistent with previous findings (10Ainbinder E. Amir-Zilberstein L. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2444-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 11Amir-Zilberstein L. Ainbinder E. Toube L. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 5246-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As predicted from the EMSA experiments, USF1 also occupies the A20 promoter in vivo. Upon TNFα treatment, NF-κB p65/RelA associates with the A20 promoter with a concomitant increase in pol II and DSIF occupancy. By contrast, USF1 occupancy is sharply decreased upon NF-κB induction, suggesting that USF1 is displaced from the A20 promoter in vivo once NF-κB is induced. To test the relevance of these findings to the endogenous A20 gene, Jurkat cells were treated with TNFα for 1 h and analyzed by ChIP. The results (Fig. 3B) confirm USF1 occupancy of this promoter along with pol II and DSIF under basal conditions. As with the transfected promoter, USF1 occupancy is significantly reduced upon TNFα induction. In contrast, pol II and DSIF occupancies are induced together with NF-κB. Regulation of DSIF Is Switched from E-box to NF-κB—The EMSA experiments distinguish between two distinct factors that bind to the ELIE region of the A20 promoter. Previously we reported that mutations in ELIE abolished DSIF inhibition of A20 under basal conditions (10Ainbinder E. Amir-Zilberstein L. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2444-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As these mutations disrupt the binding of both E-box- and complex B-binding proteins, we wished to determine whether there is a connection between USF1 and DSIF inhibition under basal and NF-κB-activated states. For this purpose we constructed a luciferase reporter driven by an A20 promoter in which the E-box is mutated but the complex B binding site remains intact (Fig. 4A, mutE-box). We used DSIF RNAi to down-regulate DSIF p160 subunit levels. 293T cells were transfected with A20 reporter gene derivatives: wild type (WT), mutE-box, and mut-κBs in which NF-κB sites were mutated (Fig. 4A) together with DSIF RNAi or pSuper (parental expression vector) for 48 h. DSIF depletion by the RNAi was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 4E). Consistent with previous results (10Ainbinder E. Amir-Zilberstein L. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2444-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), down-regulation of DSIF expression under basal conditions enhanced A20 WT promoter activity, a result also seen when there are mutations in the NF-κB sites (Fig. 4B). Remarkably, the mutation in the E-box alone was sufficient to diminish DSIF inhibitory activity (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that it is the overlapping E-box section of the ELIE that is most significant for the regulation of DSIF activity under basal conditions. The A20 gene is activated by NF-κB. DSIF inhibition in the presence of NF-κB persists, but the regulation and occupancy by DSIF becomes dependent on NF-κB and the TATA-less core promoter (11Amir-Zilberstein L. Ainbinder E. Toube L. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 5246-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We now determined the effect of the E-box mutation on DSIF inhibition when A20 is activated by NF-κB. 293T cells were transfected with the wild-type, mut-κB, or mutE-box A20 reporter genes together with NF-κB protein p65/RelA in the presence or absence of the DSIF RNAi plasmid. Down-regulation of DSIF by RNAi enhanced the NF-κB-induced transcription of the WT promoter (compare Fig. 4, B and C). In contrast to the basal state, this inhibition is abolished in the NF-κB-mutated A20 promoter as shown previously (10Ainbinder E. Amir-Zilberstein L. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2444-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 11Amir-Zilberstein L. Ainbinder E. Toube L. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 5246-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) but is unaffected by the E-box mutation (Fig. 4C). This E-box mutation did not affect the level of activation by NF-κB, whereas mutations in NF-κB site diminished it (Fig. 4D). These findings suggest that the elongation-inhibitory activity of DSIF is regulated by the promoter via two specific elements, E-box and NF-κB, which switch according to the physiological circumstances. USF1 Mediates DSIF Recruitment to the A20 Promoter under Basal Conditions—To investigate the mechanism of E-box-dependent regulation of DSIF under basal conditions, we tested whether this element mediates DSIF recruitment to the A20 promoter. 293T cells were transfected with the A20 WT or E-box mutant and then were subjected to ChIP assay using antibodies against USF1, the p160 subunit of DSIF, and a nonrelevant control antibody. To ensure that equivalent amounts of extract were used for immunoprecipitation, 0.1% of each input extract was examined by increasing PCR cycles with the same primer set (Fig. 5A, Input panel). As with the EMSA experiments, USF1 occupied the A20 promoter, and the E-box mutation diminished USF1 binding (Fig. 5A). The residual binding of USF1 to the promoter could be attributed to two additional E-boxes present in the proximal promoter (see Fig. 1A). Interestingly, reduced USF1 binding is accompanied by a significant drop (3-fold) in DSIF occupancy (Fig. 5A). These results suggest that the binding of an E-box protein to the ELIE region mediates DSIF recruitment to the A20 promoter under basal conditions. To gain insight into the mechanism by which USF1 recruits DSIF, we examined by co-immunoprecipitation assays whether these proteins interact with each other. 293T cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids of USF1 and DSIF and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-USF1, anti-DSIF, and a nonrelevant antibody as a control. The input and the immunoprecipitated proteins were then analyzed by immunoblotting with the USF1 and DSIF antibodies. The results (Fig. 5B) show that a fraction of DSIF is specifically coprecipitated with USF1, and similarly, a fraction of USF1 is coprecipitated with DSIF. The association of just a small portion of USF1 with DSIF was expected because USF1 generally functions as a positive transcriptional regulator, a context that would mask interaction with a negative regulator such as DSIF. Thus recruitment of DSIF is mediated, at least in part, through interaction with USF1. DSIF Inhibition Is Promoter-specific—To investigate the specificity of DSIF inhibitory activity under basal conditions, we examined the effect of DSIF p160 RNAi on other promoters that contain NF-κB sites but no E-box. These include IκBα, HIV-LTR (without the TAR), and the artificial NF-κB reporters 2κB-α-actin and 2κB-TK. The promoter-reporter constructs were cotransfected with either DSIF RNAi or parental expression vector, and 48 h later luciferase activity was measured (Fig. 6). The results show that a reduced level of DSIF in the cell enhanced A20 promoter activity but had no effect on transcription directed by the IκBα, HIV-LTR, 2κB-α-actin, and 2κB-TK promoters, confirming the promoter-specific nature of DSIF inhibitory activity. These findings are consistent with DSIF presence on the endogenous A20 promoter but its absence from the IκBα gene under basal conditions (11Amir-Zilberstein L. Ainbinder E. Toube L. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 5246-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In stimulated cells, however, transcription of the IκBα gene is attenuated by DSIF as it bears a TATA-less core promoter (11Amir-Zilberstein L. Ainbinder E. Toube L. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 5246-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The NF-κB response gene A20 serves as an excellent model for understanding gene-specific aspects of elongation control. A20 is inhibited by DSIF both under basal and NF-κB-activated states, but in each of these physiological states an alternative mechanism is utilized to regulate DSIF. Different promoter elements including ELIE, NF-κB, and the core promoter modulate DSIF inhibition of the A20 gene according to the extracellular signals (10Ainbinder E. Amir-Zilberstein L. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2444-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 11Amir-Zilberstein L. Ainbinder E. Toube L. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 5246-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The present study extends those observations by characterizing the proteins that bind ELIE and the regulatory switch between ELIE and NF-κB with respect to DSIF inhibition of elongation. Our results revealed that ELIE activity is mediated primarily by an E-box and USF1 protein, which is displaced by NF-κB upon its induction. Under basal conditions, the A20 gene is bound constitutively by the general transcription machinery, and transcription is inhibited at the level of reinitiation (16Ainbinder E. Revach M. Wolstein O. Moshonov S. Diamant N. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6354-6362Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and is attenuated at the level of elongation by DSIF through ELIE (10Ainbinder E. Amir-Zilberstein L. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2444-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Dissection of the ELIE region revealed that it is a composite element consisting of two partially overlapping sites: an E-box motif that binds USF1 in vitro and in vivo and an unknown protein that we called complex B. Although two distinct factors were observed to bind the ELIE region of the A20 promoter, the ChIP and functional assays point to the E-box section of ELIE as the major element responsible for the recruitment of DSIF and its inhibitory effect under basal conditions. When the E-box section of ELIE was mutated in a manner that left the complex B binding site intact, USF1 and DSIF association with the promoter was reduced, and the DSIF inhibitory effect of the basal activity was abolished. A mutation that disrupted the complex B, but not the E-box, binding site also somewhat reduced DSIF inhibition (m2, Ref. 10Ainbinder E. Amir-Zilberstein L. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2444-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), suggesting that the E-box may be assisted by the adjacent overlapping element in recruiting DSIF. Presently, the nature of the proteins that bind to complex B is unknown. USF1 is mainly known for its positive role in transcription. However, numerous recent studies suggest that it may be also involved in transcriptional repression. In Sertoli cells, USF1 binds to the sex hormone-binding globulin gene and represses its activity (17Selva D.M. Hogeveen K.N. Hammond G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4462-4468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and USF1 and USF2 serve as negative regulators for human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene expression (18Chang J.T. Yang H.T. Wang T.C. Cheng A.J. Mol. Carcinog. 2005; 44: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 19Goueli B.S. Janknecht R. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8042-8047Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It is possible that the inhibitory effect of USF1 in these genes is, as in the A20 gene, at the level of elongation. How does the E-box-binding factor USF1 regulate the activity of DSIF? Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed specific interaction between USF1 with DSIF that is likely to mediate DSIF recruitment to the A20 promoter. Their association was observed only upon overexpression of the two factors, suggesting that this interaction is transient or unstable. The A20 gene is activated by NF-κB following TNFα induction. It was therefore unexpected to find that DSIF also attenuates the TNFα- or p65/RelA-induced transcription directed by the A20 promoter (10Ainbinder E. Amir-Zilberstein L. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2444-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 11Amir-Zilberstein L. Ainbinder E. Toube L. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 5246-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Interestingly, under these conditions mutations in the NF-κB sites, but not E-box, eliminated the DSIF inhibition. EMSA and ChIP assays revealed that NF-κB acts directly or indirectly inhibits USF1 binding to the A20 promoter as USF1 is displaced from the A20 promoter upon NF-κB induction by TNFα. Displacement of USF1 from the promoter may be because of steric hindrance as the 5′ NF-κB site is only five nucleotides distant from the E-box. However, this possibility seems unlikely because in stimulated cells DSIF inhibition is also diminished when the A20 promoter bears mutations that abolish NF-κB binding, and the E-box is intact (Fig. 4). A more likely possibility is that NF-κB activation leads to a modification of USF1 that impairs its DNA binding activity. Transcriptional repression at the elongation stage has been described for several rapidly induced stress genes such as Drosophila hsp70, c-myc, c-fos, A20, and others (10Ainbinder E. Amir-Zilberstein L. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Dikstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2444-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20Pinaud S. Mirkovitch J. J. Mol.

Adv. Cancer Res. 1991; 56: 1-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that this form of repression also occurs during Drosophila development in the process of cell fate specification (23Wang X. Lee C. Gilmour D.S. Gergen J.P. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1031-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to see whether gene-specific inhibition of elongation by E-box or other promoter elements is a widespread mechanism in mammalian gene expression programs and what its impact is on the transcription process in general.

However, efficient inhibition of HIV assembly and budding has not been reported. Here, we report that dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 (ICAM-3) -grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) and its related protein, DC-SIGNR, effectively block HIV budding from infected cells. Cotrans-fection of DC-SIGN or DC-SIGNR with HIV demonstrated 95–99.5% inhibition of viral production from host cells. DC-SIGN or DC-SIGNR can also effectively inhibit 90 -95% of HIV generation from infected cells. DC-SIGN efficiently reduces the amount of gp120 present on the cell plasma membrane, and completely strips off gp120 from the virions produced by the host cells, suggesting that blockage of HIV budding is due to internalization of gp120 by DC-SIGN.

One is similar to Sina and requires the adaptor Phyllopod, and the other is a novel mechanism of recognition. This novel mode of targeting for degradation is specific for the 69-kDa Ttk isoform, Ttk69. Ttk69 contains a region that is required for binding of SinaH and for SinaH-directed degradation. This region contains an AXVXP motif, which is the consensus sequence found in Siah substrate proteins.

E2, and E3 enzymes. The E1 activating enzyme forms a high energy thioester bond with ubiquitin and transfers this to one of several E2 conjugating enzymes. E3 ligases interact directly with protein substrates and assist the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 enzyme to ϵ-amino groups of lysine residues on the target. This series of events results in a tightly regulated polyubiquitination of the target proteins (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar). E3 ubiquitin ligases are often multisubunit complexes, in which one essential subunit is a protein containing either a HECT domain or a RING finger (2Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev.

The Drosophila Sina protein contains a RING finger and can act as a component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase. It is required for the formation of R7 photoreceptors during development of the eye, as well as for the proper development of other sensory organs (3Carthew R.W. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 561-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Humans have two highly conserved proteins, Siah1 and Siah2 (77 and 68% identity to Sina, respectively), which also possess E3 ligase activity (4Hu G. Chung Y.L. Glover T. Valentine V. Look A.T. Fearon E.R. Genomics. 1997; 46: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We report here a novel Drosophila protein that is homologous (46% identical) to Sina, named Sina-Homologue (SinaH), and we show that it can trigger degradation of the transcriptional repressor Tramtrack, which is also a target of Sina. Alternative splicing of the tramtrack gene gives rise to two proteins, Tramtrack 69 (Ttk69) and Tramtrack 88 (Ttk88). These isoforms share an N-terminal Bric-à-Brac-Tramtrack-Broad (BTB) domain but contain different C-terminal zinc fingers (5Read D. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We show that SinaH recognizes Ttk69 in a unique manner, different from Sina. The novel mechanism used by SinaH is specific for the Ttk69 isoform and is distinct from that used to recognize Ttk88. Tramtrack proteins have been demonstrated to be important transcriptional repressors of neuronal development (6Xiong W.C. Montell C.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7186-7193Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). One method of control of the activity of Tramtrack proteins is at the level of protein stability, and this mechanism requires not only Sina but also the adaptor protein Phyllopod (Phyl) (16Tang A.H. Neufeld T.P. Kwan E. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 459-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 17Li S. Li Y. Carthew R.W. Lai Z.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 469-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and the F-box protein Ebi (18Dong X. Tsuda L. Zavitz K.H. Lin M. Li S. Carthew R.W. Zipursky S.L.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5376-5386Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the Drosophila nervous system and the eye, the activity of these factors is controlled by signaling pathways (20Chang H.C.

Carthew R.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2167-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), which allows the level of Tramtrack proteins, and subsequent cell fate decisions, to be tightly controlled throughout development. In the peripheral nervous system, Tramtrack proteins are expressed exclusively in non-neuronal cells, where they act to repress neural identity (7Guo M. Bier E. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Neuron. 1995; 14: 913-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Similarly, in third instar eye discs Tramtrack proteins are expressed in the cone cells, not in the neuronal photoreceptor cells. If either Tramtrack protein is overexpressed in the eye, photoreceptor development is inhibited (16Tang A.H. Neufeld T.P. Kwan E. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 459-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 17Li S. Li Y. Carthew R.W. Lai Z.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 469-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Conversely, Ttk88 mutant flies have rough eyes because of the differentiation of extra photoreceptors, particularly R7 cells, in many of the ommatidia (6Xiong W.C. Montell C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The Tramtrack proteins therefore normally restrict the ability of cells to differentiate as R7 photoreceptors. This is overcome in the R7 cells by a Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase signal from the R8 photoreceptor, which causes an elevation in phyl transcription and hence Tramtrack proteolysis in the R7 (20Chang H.C. Solomon N.M. Wassarman D.A. Karim F.D. Therrien M. Rubin G.M. Wolff T. Cell. 1995; 80: 463-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 21Kauffmann R.C. Li S. Gallagher P.A. Zhang J. Carthew R.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2167-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Mutations in phyl, ebi, and sina genes all cause the transformation of R7 cells into cone cells (3Carthew R.W.

Cell. 1995; 80: 463-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and genetic experiments suggest a model in which Sina, Phyl, and Ebi all act to degrade Tramtrack proteins in R7 cells (16Tang A.H. Neufeld T.P. Kwan E. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 459-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 17Li S. Li Y. Carthew R.W. Lai Z.C.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5376-5386Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These proteins also antagonize Tramtrack activity to allow the specification of sensory organ precursor cells and subsequent neuronal lineages (22Pi H. Wu H.J. Chien C.T. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 2699-2710PubMed Google Scholar). In Drosophila embryonic S2 cells, the expression of Phyl is sufficient to induce degradation of Ttk88 (17Li S. Li Y. Carthew R.W. Lai Z.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 469-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), suggesting that endogenous levels of the other components are sufficient for degradation in these cells. In vitro, Sina, Phyl, and Ebi are all required to degrade Ttk88 (19Boulton S.J. Brook A. Staehling-Hampton K. Heitzler P. Dyson N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5376-5386Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Physical interactions between these components have been mapped. Both Sina and Ebi interact very weakly with Ttk88 (19Boulton S.J. Brook A. Staehling-Hampton K. Heitzler P. Dyson N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5376-5386Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 23Li S. Xu C. Carthew R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6854-6865Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Phyl binds strongly to Ttk88, and this is dependent on the BTB domain, which is common to both Ttk isoforms. Sina and Phyl also interact strongly, suggesting a model whereby Phyl acts as an adaptor protein to bring the substrate Ttk and the RING finger ligase Sina together (23Li S. Xu C. Carthew R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6854-6865Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Sina can then recruit the E2 conjugating enzyme UBCD1 to cause polyubiquitination and degradation (16Tang A.H. Neufeld T.P. Kwan E. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 459-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The role of Ebi here is unknown, but it may stabilize the complex (23Li S. Xu C. Carthew R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6854-6865Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).

Human Siah1 is implicated in a novel pathway of β-catenin degradation, which involves a complex containing Siah1, Siah-interacting protein, the adaptor protein Skp1, and Ebi, which binds to β-catenin directly (30Matsuzawa S.I. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). A consensus motif found in Siah-binding proteins has been identified (PXAXVXP) (31House C.M. Frew I.J. Huang H.L. Wiche G. Traficante N. Nice E. Catimel B. Bowtell D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3101-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and more than half of the known Siahbinding proteins, including the adaptor Phyl, contain this motif. The crystal structure of Siah1 binding this peptide sequence has been solved (32Santelli E. Leone M. Li C. Fukushima T. Preece N.E. Olson A.J. Ely K.R. Reed J.C. Pellecchia M. Liddington R.C. Matsuzawa S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34278-34287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and often proteins that contain this motif are the direct substrate for degradation by Siah proteins. In this study we have shown that SinaH uses two modes of recognition to direct the degradation of the substrate Ttk69. One requires the BTB domain of Ttk69 and the adaptor Phyl, suggesting a recognition mode similar to Sina. The other requires a specific sequence in Ttk69 that contains AXVXP and GXVXP motifs and suggests that the Sina homologue, in contrast to Sina, may act in a similar manner to the mammalian homologues. Plasmids—SinaH cDNA was amplified from the expressed sequence tag clone GH28479 using primers 5′-GCGAATTCGGTACCAAGATGTCTGTTCGCAACTCACG-3′ and 5′-CGCTGCGGCCGCTACAGATCCTCCTCGGAGATCAGCTTCTGCTCACTAGTGTTGGTACGCTCCTCCAC-3′. This added EcoRI and KpnI sites as well as a Kozak consensus translation site at the 5′ end and incorporated a SpeI site, Myc epitope tag, stop codon, and NotI site at the 3′ end. Following PCR, the amplified DNA was digested with EcoRI and NotI and cloned into the pRMHA3 S2 expression vector under the control of a metallothionein promoter. Full-length Ttk69-HA, Ttk88-HA, and Pointed-P1-HA cDNAs were cloned into pRMHA3. The pRMHA3-5′polyoma-Sina and pRMHA3-5′HA-Phyl constructs were kind gifts of G. Rubin. Full-length Sina and SinaH cDNAs were subcloned into pRMHA3 to include a FLAG epitope tag. RING finger mutants Sina-C120A and SinaH-C87A were created using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Ttk69 deletion mutants were made by PCR using primers that incorporated an EcoRI site and an initiation codon (ATG) at the 5′ end and an HA epitope tag and XbaI site at the 3′ end. Fragments were cloned into the pIZT constitutive S2 expression vector. Ttk69ΔVXP (deletion of amino acids 415-436) and Ttk88ΔBTB (deletion of the first 98 amino acids) were also generated by PCR to include an HA epitope tag and were cloned into pRMHA3. Full-length Ttk69-HA (using EcoRI and XbaI), Ttk88-HA (using EcoRI and NotI), Pointed-P1-HA (using EcoRI and XbaI), Sina-FLAG (using EcoRI and NotI), SinaH-FLAG (using EcoRI and NotI), and Phyl-HA (using BamHI and XhoI) were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 for expression in HEK-293 cells. Full-length Ttk69-HA, Ttk69ΔBTB-HA (deletion of the first 131 amino acids), and Ttk69ΔVXP-HA were subcloned into the pT7βLink vector (R. Treisman) using EcoRI and XbaI sites. Full-length Sina (using EcoRI and XhoI), SinaH (using BamHI and EcoRI), and Phyl (using BamHI and XhoI) cDNAs were cloned into the pT7βLink vector using primers that incorporated a Myc epitope tag. Phyl was also cloned using a primer that incorporated an HA epitope tag. S2 Cell Degradation Assay—S2 cells were grown in Schneider's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum. 0.5 × 106 cells/well were plated in a 24-well plate and transfected with 1.25 μg of DNA using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were left for 24 h, and the medium was replaced with medium plus 0.7 mm CuSO4 to induce expression from the metallothionein promoter. After induction for 18 h the cells were harvested, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, boiled in 100 μl of 3× SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The degradation assays contained 0.25 μg of pRMHA3-Ttk69-HA, Ttk88-HA, or Ttk deletion mutants; 0.25 μg of pRMHA3-PntP1-HA; 0.25 μg of pRMHA-Phyl-HA; and 0.0375 μg of pRMHA3-Sina-FLAG or pRMHA3-SinaH-FLAG. Each transfection was made up to 1.25 μg of DNA using empty pRMHA3 vector. Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—2 × 106 cells/well were plated in a 6-well plate and transfected using FuGENE 6 with 1 μg of pRMHA3-Ttk69-HA and with either 0.15 μg of pRMHA3 or 0.15 μg of pRMHA3-SinaH. Cells were induced, and mRNA was isolated using a Dynabeads mRNA DIRECT kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was prepared using SuperRT (HT Biotechnology), and quantitative PCR was performed with an Applied Biosystems 7900HT reverse transcription-PCR system using actin mRNA for normalization and Ttk69-HA-specific primers. Results are averages of duplicate or quadruplicate data points on plates using three independent transfections. HEK 293 Proteasome Assay—HEK 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum. 1 × 105 cells/well were plated in a 24-well plate and left overnight. 1.25 μg of DNA (as S2 cell degradation assay) was transfected for 4 h using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 16 h, 50 μm MG132 in Me2SO (or Me2SO alone) was added to the cells for 3.5 h. The cells were then harvested, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, boiled in 100 μl of 3× SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Radiolabeled Immunoprecipitation Experiments—35S-Labeled proteins were synthesized in vitro using the TnT quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). For each immunoprecipitation experiment, pT7βLink constructs were cotranslated, and 30 μl of the TnT mixture was mixed with 70 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) and rotated at 4 °C for 1 h to preclear. The beads were pelleted, and the supernatant was mixed with 50 μg of anti-HA-agarose conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rotated at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed five times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and boiled with 20 μl of 4× SDS sample buffer. 10% of the TnT input mixture and all of the pulldown sample were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After fixing, the gel was dried for 45 min at 80 °C and exposed overnight to a storage phosphor screen before being scanned using a Typhoon 8600 variable mode imager (Molecular Dynamics). Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments in S2 Cells—2 × 106 S2 cells/well were plated in a 6-well plate and transfected using FuGENE 6 with 2.5 μg of either pRMHA3-Sina-C120A-FLAG or pRMHA3-SinaH-C87A-FLAG and 2.5 μg of pRMHA3-Ttk69-HA (full-length or deletion constructs) or pRMHA3-HA-Phyl. Cells were induced and collected as for S2 cell assays. Cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 450 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, and Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)) for 15 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was added to 25 μl of a 50% slurry of anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma) and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with mixing. The agarose was washed four times with immunoprecipitation buffer and eluted from the beads using 1 mg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma). 10% of input and the total eluted sample were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Antibodies—Anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science) was used at 1:2000; anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma) was used at 1:2000, and a loading control anti-histone H3 antibody (Abcam) was used at 1:2000. CG13030 Encodes a Novel Protein Homologous to Sina—A BLAST search of the Drosophila genome using the Sina protein sequence revealed a gene (CG13030) that is homologous (41% identical amino acids) to Sina (Fig. 1). Because of this high degree of similarity it was named Sina-Homologue (SinaH). SinaH is also homologous to the human Siah proteins, showing 44% identity to Siah1 and 40% identity to Siah2. As with other Siah proteins, the N terminus of SinaH was more divergent compared with the C terminus, and all key residues in the RING and zinc fingers were conserved. Both Sina and SinaH Require Phyl to Direct the Degradation of Ttk88—It has previously been shown that Ttk88 degradation in S2 cells is induced by the addition of Phyl (17Li S. Li Y. Carthew R.W. Lai Z.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 469-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We established a similar assay using S2 cells in which HA-tagged Ttk88, on an inducible plasmid, was transfected into cells, and the levels of protein were detected by probing Western blots of cell extract. In our assay, the addition of Phyl (Fig. 2A, lane 2) did not alter the level of Ttk88. The addition of Sina (Fig. 2A, lane 3) did cause a slight lowering in the amount of Ttk88. However, the transfection of both Sina and Phyl together caused Ttk88 to be considerably degraded (Fig. 2A, lane 4). As a control, an unrelated nuclear protein, HA-tagged Pointed, was also cotransfected, and under the conditions we used for the assay, the levels of Pointed remained relatively constant. This assay (and the subsequent assays) were carried out several times (>10), and despite some variation in levels of Pointed and Ttk88, the effect was highly consistent between each repeat: Ttk88 was degraded only upon the addition of both Sina and Phyl. We created a mutant Sina construct (Sina-C120-FLAG), shown in other E3 ligases to eliminate activity, in which the third cysteine residue in the RING finger was mutated to alanine. This mutant Sina was unable to direct the degradation of Ttk88 even upon the addition of Phyl (Fig. 2A, lane 6). We then tested Sina-Homologue in the same assay, and the result was strikingly similar to that seen with Sina. Sina-Homologue was able to degrade Ttk88 when Phyl was added (Fig. 2A, lane 8), and a comparable mutation in the RING finger of SinaH (SinaH-C87A-FLAG) abolished this degradation (Fig. 2A, lane 10). Both the wild-type and mutant Sina and SinaH contained a FLAG tag, and the protein levels of both Sina and SinaH used in the assay were detected with an antibody against the epitope. Previously it has been noted that Siah proteins are able to direct their own degradation by association with E2 enzymes, causing autoubiquitination (4Hu G. Chung Y.L. Glover T. Valentine V. Look A.T. Fearon E.R. Genomics. 1997; 46: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The low protein levels of wild-type Sina-FLAG (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 5) and SinaH-FLAG (lanes 7 and 8) are consistent with such an effect, along with an increase in protein levels when the RING finger is mutated: Sina-C120-FLAG (Fig. 2A, lanes 6 and 7) and SinaH-C87A-FLAG (lanes 9 and 10). As well as autoubiquitination of the RING domain-containing protein, other members of the E3 complexes are also targeted for degradation (33Galan J.M. Peter M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9124-9129Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and in this assay Phyl (HA-tagged) is reduced in level when both wild-type Sina and SinaH are added, but this effect is abolished upon mutation of the RING fingers. These results show that in our S2 assay, Sina and Phyl cooperate in directing the degradation of Ttk88. Moreover, the novel SinaH protein can act in a similar manner to Sina and also direct the degradation of Ttk88 in combination with Phyl. Sina-Homologue Directs the Degradation of Ttk69 in a Different Manner from Sina—We then tested the other isoform of Tramtrack, Ttk69, in the S2 degradation assay. Again, the addition of Phyl or Sina alone did not cause any lowering of Ttk69 levels (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 3). However, the addition of Phyl and Sina together caused Ttk69 degradation (Fig. 2B, lane 4), and this was abrogated when the RING domain was mutated in Sina (lane 6). SUMO-modified Ttk69 behaved identically to unmodified Ttk69 in this assay, therefore suggesting that the SUMO-ylation had no detectable effect on protein stability. Interestingly, the addition of SinaH alone to the assay (Fig. 2B, lane 7) was sufficient to cause the degradation of Ttk69 without the need for Phyl. This effect was not due to changes in the mRNA abundance as determined by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (-fold change of Ttk69-HA mRNA in SinaH-transfected cells equals 1.00 with an S.D. of 0.27). The addition of SinaH and Phyl together did not produce a further decrease in the amount of Ttk69, which was different from the Phyl dependence seen in Sina-directed degradation. This suggested that SinaH could be recognizing or acting on the substrate Ttk69 in a different manner from Sina and that the two isoforms of Tramtrack could be degraded differently. Ttk88 and Ttk69 Degradation Is Proteasome-dependent—Proteasome inhibitors (e.g. MG132) were not effective in our S2 cells, and therefore to investigate if the reduction in levels of Ttk88 and Ttk69 seen in the above assays was due to proteasome-dependent degradation, we set up similar assays in MG132-responsive HEK 293 cells. Fig. 3A shows that, as in S2 cells, Sina and Phyl are both required for Ttk88 degradation (lane 5), and this degradation can be inhibited by the addition of MG132 (lane 6). This was also the case for Sina- and Phyl-dependent Ttk69 degradation, shown in Fig. 3B (lanes 5 and 6). SinaH-directed degradation was also proteasome-dependent. As in S2 cells, SinaH acted with Phyl to direct the degradation of Ttk88, and this was inhibited by MG132 (Fig. 3A, lane 12). Interestingly, the degradation of Ttk69 by SinaH was independent of Phyl (Fig. 3B, lane 9) and could be abolished by the addition of MG132 (lane 10), suggesting that this mode of degradation was also proteasome-dependent. The levels of Phyl-HA are indicated in Fig. 3, A and B, and both Sina- and SinaH-directed degradation of the adaptor, Phyl-HA, was inhibited by the addition of the proteasome inhibitor. Sina and Phyl Recognize the BTB Domain in Ttk69—To identify the region of Ttk69 required for recognition by Sina/Phyl, degradation assays were performed on a set of deletion constructs of Ttk69 (Fig. 4). There was some variability in levels of the deletion constructs, but consistently (repeated four times) three constructs were resistant to degradation upon addition of Sina and Phyl (Fig. 4, lane 4, *). These lacked the N-terminal part of the protein (Ttk69ΔN290, Ttk69ΔN373, and Ttk69ΔN469), showing that this region is important for recognition. The N-terminal region is common to both Ttk isoforms and contains the BTB domain. This domain is where Phyl binds to Ttk (17Li S. Li Y. Carthew R.W. Lai Z.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 469-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 23Li S. Xu C. Carthew R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6854-6865Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) to bring the E3 ligase Sina to its substrate. These results give a functional confirmation of this model and explain why both isoforms of Ttk are similarly susceptible to Sina and Phyl. SinaH Requires a 50-Amino Acid Region Unique to Ttk69 for Recognition—To investigate if SinaH acted on Ttk69 differently from Sina, we tested the same set of Ttk69 deletion constructs. Consistently three constructs were stable in this assay: Ttk69ΔN469, Ttk69ΔC280, and Ttk69ΔC420 (Fig. 4, lane 7, *). However, these constructs were different from the resistant fragments in the Sina experiment. Using this assay, the region necessary for SinaH recognition was mapped between amino acids 420 and 469 (marked on Fig. 4) of Ttk69. In this experiment, Phyl and SinaH were also transfected together (Fig. 4, lane 8). The addition of Phyl did not cause any further reduction in protein levels of any of the SinaH-susceptible constructs. However, of the three constructs resistant to SinaH-mediated degradation, the two that contained the BTB domain (Ttk69ΔC280 and Ttk69ΔC420) were degraded upon addition of Phyl, but Ttk69ΔN469 remained resistant to degradation even when Phyl was introduced. Two AXVXP and GXVXP motifs, the consensus motif found in mammalian Siah-binding proteins, are located around region 420-469 of Ttk69 that was required for SinaH-mediated degradation. A mutant form of Ttk69 (Ttk69ΔVXP-HA) was made and tested in the assays (Fig. 5A). As predicted, removal of these motifs made Ttk69ΔVXP significantly less susceptible to SinaH-mediated degradation compared with wild-type Ttk69 (Fig. 5A, compare lane 3 (wild-type) with lane 5 (mutant)). Interestingly, the addition of Phyl caused a reduction in protein levels of Ttk69ΔVXP, an effect that was not visible for wild-type Ttk69 (Fig. 5A, lane 6) but was similar to the effect seen for the deletion constructs Ttk69ΔC280 and Ttk69ΔC420. The Ttk69ΔVXP, Ttk69ΔC280, and Ttk69ΔC420 mutants all contain the BTB domain but remove the VXP motif. These experiments show that without the VXP motif, SinaH acts similarly to Sina, causing reduction of Ttk69 levels in association with Phyl via the BTB domain. Fig. 5B shows that both wild-type Ttk69 and mutant Ttk69ΔVXP behave identically upon addition of Sina and Phyl. These results demonstrate two distinct modes of Ttk69 recognition and show that SinaH acts through a novel region of the substrate protein Ttk69. As a further test of the principle, a mutant of Ttk88 lacking the BTB domain was created (Ttk88ΔBTB-HA). This Tramtrack protein does not contain VXP motifs (they are specific for Ttk69), nor does it contain the BTB domain. Without either of these interaction motifs, Ttk88ΔBTB should be completely resistant to SinaH-mediated degradation. Indeed, Fig. 5C shows that, upon transfection of SinaH DNA, Ttk88ΔBTB remained at a constant level. Phyl Acts as an Adaptor between Ttk69 and Both Sina and SinaH—We carried out protein interaction studies to investigate if SinaH could bind to Ttk69. We produced [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro translated proteins, which contained an HA-tagged protein and other untagged test proteins. Using anti-HA-agarose we immunoprecipitated the HA-tagged protein. Any proteins that could bind to the HA-tagged protein were also precipitated. This system did not contain the rest of the degradation machinery, allowing interactions with active proteins to be tested without the problem of degradation. Previous work has shown that Phyl binds to the BTB domain in the common region of the Tramtrack isoforms and that Sina and Phyl bind each other strongly, thereby suggesting that Phyl is an adaptor, acting to bring Sina and Tramtrack together (23Li S. Xu C. Carthew R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6854-6865Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In Fig. 6A we also show that HA-tagged Ttk69 bound Phyl but not Sina (lanes 14 and 12, respectively). When Sina and Phyl were both present, Ttk-HA bound to both (lane 8), and this interaction was dependent on the BTB domain (lane 10). Ttk69 was also able to bind to Phyl and SinaH when they were both present (lane 9), and this interaction was abolished when the BTB domain was deleted (lane 11). Given the similarity between Sina and SinaH it was not surprising that SinaH could also bind Phyl-HA very strongly both in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 6, B and C), and this indicates that SinaH has a similar mode of binding to Ttk69 via the adaptor Phyl. SinaH Binds to the VXP Motifs of Ttk69 in Vivo—Using our in vitro produced proteins, we saw that Ttk69 could also weakly interact with SinaH alone under certain conditions (Fig. 6A, lane 13). However, because of the small amounts of proteins produced in vitro, this binding was not very reproducible. It is known that Sina can bind to Ttk69 directly, but this interaction is weak and not sufficient to cause significant degradation under physiologically relevant conditions (23Li S. Xu C. Carthew R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6854-6865Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We investigated whether there was a direct interaction between SinaH and Ttk69 but found no difference from the very weak Sina/Ttk69 binding (data not shown). We therefore decided to use a co-immunoprecipitation experiment in S2 cells, as an unknown adaptor might be necessary to allow strong binding of SinaH to the VXP motifs in Ttk69. To perform co-immunoprecipitation experiments it was necessary to use the RING domain mutants of Sina and SinaH, shown in Fig. 2, to allow higher levels of Ttk69 proteins to be co-expressed. Sina-C120A-FLAG and SinaH-C87A-FLAG were transfected into S2 cells with full-length Ttk69, Ttk69ΔN373, or Ttk69ΔN469. Both Sina and SinaH interacted strongly with full-length Ttk69 (Fig. 7, lanes 2 and 3). Unlike the in vitro transcription/translation system described above, there is endogenous Phyl present in these cells. Therefore, a likely explanation for this result is that Phyl is sufficient to act as an adaptor protein by binding to the BTB domain. Ttk69ΔN373 and Ttk69ΔN469 both lacked the BTB domain, and therefore any interaction could not be via endogenous Phyl. Neither Sina nor SinaH bound to Ttk69ΔN469 (Fig. 7, lanes 8 and 9), a fragment that was resistant to degradation in the previous assays. However, compared with Sina, SinaH bound to Ttk69ΔN373 more strongly (Fig. 7, compare lane 5 with lane 6). Ttk69ΔN373 contains the VXP motifs, and consistent with the previous data, levels of this fragment remained unaltered when Sina was transfected but were dramatically reduced upon addition of SinaH. We have shown that the novel RING finger-containing protein CG13030 or SinaH can direct the proteasome-dependent degradation of Tramtrack proteins in a similar way to the E3 ubiquitin ligase Sina. Mutation of the RING domain abolishes this ability. However, despite the high homology between these E3 ubiquitin ligases, we have shown that SinaH can direct the degradation of Ttk69 in a different manner from Sina and that SinaH recognizes Ttk69 by two different modes depending on the presence or absence of Phyl. SinaH can direct the degradation of Ttk69 without the need for the adaptor Phyl. We have shown that a 50-amino acid region unique to the Ttk69 isoform (amino acids 420-469) is required for this effect. In a co-immunoprecipitation assay SinaH interacts with this region of Ttk69, and these results suggest a model by which SinaH recognizes Ttk69 either by interacting directly or, more likely, via an unknown adaptor molecule that interacts with region 420-469 in Ttk69 (Fig. 8). Interestingly, SinaH can also bind to Phyl both in vitro and in vivo. Consistent with this result, degradation of Ttk88 and Ttk69ΔVXP directed by SinaH is increased by the addition of Phyl. This implies a mechanism similar to the one shown previously for Sina and Phyl and suggests that SinaH could act redundantly with Sina in some circumstances (Fig. 8). Both Sina and SinaH interact equally well with full-length Ttk69 in a co-immunoprecipitation assay, most likely because of endogenous Phyl acting as an adaptor. Phyl interacts in the common region of the Ttk isoforms, so it seems likely that the SinaH/Phyl-targeting mechanism occurs for both Ttk69 and Ttk88. We did not see Phyl dependence in our assay of Ttk69 degradation by SinaH, which is probably because SinaH alone had already caused a substantial reduction in Ttk69 levels. However, for Ttk69ΔVXP, which removes the direct mode of SinaH recognition, the SinaH/Phyl-dependent mode of recognition became apparent. SinaH activity toward Ttk69ΔVXP is also comparable with its activity toward Ttk88, again consistent with the idea that SinaH recognizes Ttk69 using two different modes: one via the BTB domain, present in Ttk88 and Ttk69, and one via the VXP motifs found only in Ttk69. We have shown that the mechanism that SinaH uses to degrade Ttk69 is distinct from that which it uses to degrade Ttk88. The Tramtrack isoforms have different developmental roles: removal of Ttk69 is embryonic lethal, whereas a Ttk88 null results in a variety of nonlethal developmental phenotypes (6Xiong W.C. Montell C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). It could therefore be advantageous to have a mechanism for the selective destruction of the Ttk isoforms, and SinaH might be used specifically to turn over the Ttk69 isoform in a Sina/Phyl-independent manner. This could provide the organism with an added level of control over the activity of these developmentally crucial transcription factors. This might also suggest why another Sina-like protein is present in Drosophila. We have also shown that SinaH can act in a way similar to Sina, requiring Phyl to recognize its substrate. However, it seems that the Phyl-independent recognition of Ttk69 is more efficient than that mediated via the BTB domain. Unlike Sina and SinaH, Phyl is not conserved in higher eukaryotes, and therefore this Phyl-independent mechanism is more likely to be similar to that used by the Sina homologues in these other species. This suggestion is consistent with the presence of the two AXVXP and GXVXP motifs within the region of Ttk69 that mediates SinaH interaction. Given this biochemical similarity between the recognition methods used by SinaH and the human Siah protein, studies of the fly SinaH might offer a model to help clarify some of the different pathways in which the Siah proteins have been implicated (34Cooper S.E. Mech. Dev. 2007; 124: 584-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We thank Richard Carthew for helpful discussions and A. Bassett and M. Churcher for critical reading of the manuscript."
