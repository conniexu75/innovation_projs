https://openalex.org/W2080998956,"Epidemiological studies indicate that overweight and obesity are associated with increased cancer risk. To study how obesity augments cancer risk and development, we focused on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the common form of liver cancer whose occurrence and progression are the most strongly affected by obesity among all cancers. We now demonstrate that either dietary or genetic obesity is a potent bona fide liver tumor promoter in mice. Obesity-promoted HCC development was dependent on enhanced production of the tumor-promoting cytokines IL-6 and TNF, which cause hepatic inflammation and activation of the oncogenic transcription factor STAT3. The chronic inflammatory response caused by obesity and enhanced production of IL-6 and TNF may also increase the risk of other cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2149662085,"We describe a mechanism of tumorigenesis mediated by kinase-dead BRAF in the presence of oncogenic RAS. We show that drugs that selectively inhibit BRAF drive RAS-dependent BRAF binding to CRAF, CRAF activation, and MEK–ERK signaling. This does not occur when oncogenic BRAF is inhibited, demonstrating that BRAF inhibition per se does not drive pathway activation; it only occurs when BRAF is inhibited in the presence of oncogenic RAS. Kinase-dead BRAF mimics the effects of the BRAF-selective drugs and kinase-dead Braf and oncogenic Ras cooperate to induce melanoma in mice. Our data reveal another paradigm of BRAF-mediated signaling that promotes tumor progression. They highlight the importance of understanding pathway signaling in clinical practice and of genotyping tumors prior to administering BRAF-selective drugs, to identify patients who are likely to respond and also to identify patients who may experience adverse effects.PaperClip/cms/asset/c43bc943-8c0c-498e-ac81-22a535857d2a/mmc3.mp3Loading ...(mp3, 3.03 MB) Download audio"
https://openalex.org/W2109560454,"SIRT6 is a member of a highly conserved family of NAD(+)-dependent deacetylases with various roles in metabolism, stress resistance, and life span. SIRT6-deficient mice develop normally but succumb to a lethal hypoglycemia early in life; however, the mechanism underlying this hypoglycemia remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that SIRT6 functions as a histone H3K9 deacetylase to control the expression of multiple glycolytic genes. Specifically, SIRT6 appears to function as a corepressor of the transcription factor Hif1alpha, a critical regulator of nutrient stress responses. Consistent with this notion, SIRT6-deficient cells exhibit increased Hif1alpha activity and show increased glucose uptake with upregulation of glycolysis and diminished mitochondrial respiration. Our studies uncover a role for the chromatin factor SIRT6 as a master regulator of glucose homeostasis and may provide the basis for novel therapeutic approaches against metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2014960200,"RIG-I is a key mediator of antiviral immunity, able to couple detection of infection by RNA viruses to the induction of interferons. Natural RIG-I stimulatory RNAs have variously been proposed to correspond to virus genomes, virus replication intermediates, viral transcripts, or self-RNA cleaved by RNase L. However, the relative contribution of each of these RNA species to RIG-I activation and interferon induction in virus-infected cells is not known. Here, we use three approaches to identify physiological RIG-I agonists in cells infected with influenza A virus or Sendai virus. We show that RIG-I agonists are exclusively generated by the process of virus replication and correspond to full-length virus genomes. Therefore, nongenomic viral transcripts, short replication intermediates, and cleaved self-RNA do not contribute substantially to interferon induction in cells infected with these negative strand RNA viruses. Rather, single-stranded RNA viral genomes bearing 5'-triphosphates constitute the natural RIG-I agonists that trigger cell-intrinsic innate immune responses during infection."
https://openalex.org/W2000078674,"eNOS expression is elevated in human glioblastomas and correlated with increased tumor growth and aggressive character. We investigated the potential role of nitric oxide (NO) activity in the perivascular niche (PVN) using a genetic engineered mouse model of PDGF-induced gliomas. eNOS expression is highly elevated in tumor vascular endothelium adjacent to perivascular glioma cells expressing Nestin, Notch, and the NO receptor, sGC. In addition, the NO/cGMP/PKG pathway drives Notch signaling in PDGF-induced gliomas in vitro, and induces the side population phenotype in primary glioma cell cultures. NO also increases neurosphere forming capacity of PDGF-driven glioma primary cultures, and enhances their tumorigenic capacity in vivo. Loss of NO activity in these tumors suppresses Notch signaling in vivo and prolongs survival of mice. This mechanism is conserved in human PDGFR amplified gliomas. The NO/cGMP/PKG pathway's promotion of stem cell-like character in the tumor PVN may identify therapeutic targets for this subset of gliomas."
https://openalex.org/W2111793830,"As chronic inflammation is a hallmark of obesity, pathways that integrate nutrient- and pathogen sensing pathways are of great interest in understanding the mechanisms of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and other chronic metabolic pathologies. Here, we provide evidence that double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) can respond to nutrient signals as well as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and coordinate the activity of other critical inflammatory kinases such as the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) to regulate insulin action and metabolism. PKR also directly targets and modifies insulin receptor substrate and hence integrates nutrients and insulin action with a defined pathogen response system. Dietary and genetic obesity features marked activation of PKR in adipose and liver tissues and absence of PKR alleviates metabolic deterioration due to nutrient or energy excess in mice. These findings demonstrate PKR as a critical component of an inflammatory complex that responds to nutrients and organelle dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2112215250,"N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors constitute a major subtype of glutamate receptors at extrasynaptic sites that link multiple intracellular catabolic processes responsible for irreversible neuronal death. Here, we report that cerebral ischemia recruits death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) into the NMDA receptor NR2B protein complex in the cortex of adult mice. DAPK1 directly binds with the NMDA receptor NR2B C-terminal tail consisting of amino acid 1292-1304 (NR2BCT). A constitutively active DAPK1 phosphorylates NR2B subunit at Ser-1303 and in turn enhances the NR1/NR2B receptor channel conductance. Genetic deletion of DAPK1 or administration of NR2BCT that uncouples an activated DAPK1 from an NMDA receptor NR2B subunit in vivo in mice blocks injurious Ca2+ influx through NMDA receptor channels at extrasynaptic sites and protects neurons against cerebral ischemic insults.

The neurobiology of slow synaptic transmission.Science. 2001; 294: 1024-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Immediately following ischemia, however, glutamate accumulates at synapses (Drejer et al., 1985Drejer J. Benveniste H. Diemer N.H. Schousboe A.

Glutamate activates three classes of ionophore-linked postsynaptic receptors, namely N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) and kainate receptors. NMDA receptor toxicity is dependent on extracellular Ca2+, and reflects a large amount of Ca2+ influx directly through the receptor-gated ion channels (Simon et al., 1984Simon R.P. Swan J.H.

Moskowitz M.A. Mechanisms, challenges and opportunities in stroke.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 399-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). As most AMPA receptor channels have poor Ca2+ permeability, injury may result primarily from indirect Ca2+ entry through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, Ca2+-permeable acid-sensing ion channels (Xiong et al., 2004Xiong Z.G. Zhu X.M. Chu X.P. Minami M. Hey J. Wei W.L. MacDonald J.F. Wemmie J.A. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. Simon R.P.

Thus, over-stimulation of glutamate receptors can be considered as a primary intracellular event that induces neuronal death in stroke. NMDA receptors constitute the major subtype of glutamate receptors, and normally participate in rapid excitatory synaptic transmission. To date, a variety of NMDA receptor subunit proteins (NR1, NR2A–D) have been cloned (Madden, 2002Madden D.R. The structure and function of glutamate receptor ion channels.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Native NMDA receptors appear to be heteroligomeric complexes consisting of an essential NR1 subunit and one or more regulatory NR2 subunits (NR2A–D) and possibly the more recently identified NR3 subunit (Chatterton et al., 2002Chatterton J.E. Awobuluyi M. Premkumar L.S. Takahashi H. Talantova M. Shin Y. Cui J. Tu S. Sevarino K.A. Nakanishi N. et al.Excitatory glycine receptors containing the NR3 family of NMDA receptor subunits.Nature. 2002; 415: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Since the NR2C- (and possibly NR2D-) containing receptors have very low probability for their channel opening (Sprengel et al., 1998Sprengel R. Suchanek B. Amico C. Brusa R. Burnashev N. Rozov A. Hvalby O. Jensen V. Paulsen O. Andersen P. et al.Importance of the intracellular domain of NR2 subunits for NMDA receptor function in vivo.Cell. 1998; 92: 279-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), both NR2A- and NR2B-containing NMDA receptors are considered as the main types of functional NMDA receptor channels in CNS neurons (Madden, 2002Madden D.R. The structure and function of glutamate receptor ion channels.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Activation of NMDA receptors requires two coincident events: 1) binding to the coagonists of glutamate and glycine, and 2) simultaneous membrane depolarization, which removes the Mg2+ blockade of the channel pore, leading to the influx of Ca2+. Under physiological conditions, the entrance of Ca2+ produces partial inhibition of NMDA receptors via Ca2+-dependent inactivation, thereby preventing the intracellular Ca2+ overload (Krupp et al., 1999Krupp J.J. Vissel B. Thomas C.G. Heinemann S.F. Westbrook G.L. Interactions of calmodulin and α-actinin with the NR1 subunit modulate Ca2+-dependent inactivation of NMDA receptors.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1165-1178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under pathological conditions, however, this negative feedback in Ca2+ regulation of NMDA receptors is disabled, resulting in excessive Ca2+ influx through the receptor channels (Wang et al., 2003aWang J. Liu S.H. Fu Y.P. Wang J.H. Lu Y. Cdk5 activation induces CA1 pyramidal cell death by direct phosphorylation of NMDA receptors.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 1039-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Ca2+ overload triggers multiple intracellular catabolic processes, and thus induces an irreversible death of neuronal cells in the brain (for review, see Lipton, 2006Lipton S.A. Paradigm shift in neuroprotection by NMDA receptor blockade: memantine and beyond.Nat. Rev. Discov. 2006; 5: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, Lo et al., 2003Lo E.H. Dalkara T. Moskowitz M.A. Mechanisms, challenges and opportunities in stroke.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 399-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). Although over stimulation of NMDA receptors contributes to ischemic neuronal death, blocking them totally could be deleterious to animals and humans because targeting these receptors also blocks the physiological actions of the receptor as well. In the present study, we report that DAPK1, or death-associated protein kinase 1, acts as a specific “cell death signal” that couples NMDA receptor channels at extrasynaptic sites to ischemic neuronal death. We also demonstrate that uncoupling of an activated DAPK1 from the NMDA receptor complex protects against brain damage in stroke without affecting the physiological actions of the NMDA receptors. Thus, targeting DAPK1-NMDA receptor interaction can be considered as a practical strategy for stroke therapy. To explore the cell death signals that are linked with NMDA receptors in stroke damage, we used anti-NMDA receptor NR2B antibodies to precipitate the NMDA receptor complex in the membrane extracts from the cortex of mice that had been subjected to focal cerebral ischemia or sham operation (for details, see Experimental Procedures). The precipitates from both groups were separated on the SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue (Figures 1A and 1B). Compared to the control group, the additional protein bands on the gel with estimated size of 66 kDa and 150 kDa were observed in the ischemic group. We then analyzed the protein components in these bands using a reverse phase Nano-Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (NLC/MS) approach. Five peptide sequences: AEQHEHVAGLLAR, DKSGETALAVAAR, GLFFQQLRPTQNLQPR, HYLSPQQLR, and RGVSREDIER, were found to match death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1, see Tables S1 and S2). We next probed the precipitates with antibody against DAPK1 and confirmed the existence of endogenous DAPK1 in the NMDA receptor complex (Figure 1C, see also Figure S1). We also carried out the reciprocal coimmuno-precipitation, in which anti-DAPK1 was used to precipitate NMDA receptor NR1, NR2B subunits, and their functional interacting partner PSD-95, and CaMK-II (Figure 1D). Single neuronal labeling demonstrated a colocalization of DAPK1 with NMDA receptor NR2B subunits at the post-synaptic spines (Figures 1E–1G). Thus, DAPK1 is physically associated with NMDA receptors.Figure S1Constitutively Active DAPK1 Binds with NR2B Subunit, Relates to Figure 1Show full captionCell lysates (500 μg proteins) from the HEK293 cells coexpressing the recombinant NR1/NR2B with wild-type DAPK1 (lane 1) or constitutively active DAPK1 (lane 2) were precipitated with non-specific IgG (IgG) or anti-NR1 (NR1) and probed with anti-NR1, anti-NR2B (or NR2A), or anti-DAPK1.

Input: 10 μg of protein was loaded in each lane. Similar results were observed in each of the three experiments. To identify a direct binding region of NMDA receptor NR2B subunit with DAPK1, we generated a series of NMDA receptor NR2B C-terminal deletion mutants fused with glutathione-S-transferase (GST, Figure 2A ). We found that only the NR2B1292-1304 fragment was capable of binding with DAPK1 (Figure 2B). The NR2B1292-1304 fragment contains a consensus binding motif (R/K[R/K][R/KXXRXXSX]) of DAPK1 with only one mismatch residue at asparagine-1296 (Schumacher and Schavocky, 2004Schumacher A.M. Schavocky J.P. Velentza, A. V., Mirzoeva, S. & Waterson, D. M. A calmodulin-regulated protein kinase linked to neuron survival is a substrate for the calmodulin-regulated death-associated protein kinase.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8116-8124Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We subsequently synthesized a NR2B C-terminal tail peptide of 1292KKNRNKLRRQHSY1304 (NR2BCT). Application of 50 μM NR2BCT uncoupled an activated DAPK1 from NMDA receptor NR2B protein complex (Figure 2C), but it did not affect the association of PSD-95 or CaMK-II with the NMDA receptor NR2B subunit (Figure 2D). Having determined a binding domain of DAPK1 with the NMDA receptor NR2B subunit, we then examined whether DAPK1 functionally regulates NMDA receptor channel activity. We coexpressed the NR1/NR2B receptors with a constitutively active DAPK1 (cDAPK1), or the wild-type DAPK1 (wDAPK1) in HEK293 cells. We found that cDAPK1 increased the peak amplitude of the recombinant NR1/NR2B receptor currents (Figure 3A ), but not the NR1/NR2A receptor currents (Figure 3B), at a range of holding potentials from −100 to +100 mV. Since the decay time constants and the reversal potentials were not changed (Figure 3A), cDAPK1 specifically increases the recombinant NR1/NR2B receptor channel conductance. To determine whether enhancement of NR1/NR2B receptor currents is mediated directly by DAPK1-NR2B interaction, we made use of NR2B subunit C-terminal peptide, NR2BCT, at a concentration of 10, 25, or 50 μM, which was diffused directly into the recording cells via path electrode (Figure 3C). After a 10 min diffusion of 50 μM NR2BCT, the peak amplitude of the whole-cell currents decreased by 0.56 ± 0.086 of the baseline (mean ± standard error of the mean [SEM], Figure 3C). A peptide with the same amino acid composition but in random order scrambled NR2BCT (sNR2BCT) served as control, and did not reduce the recombinant NR1/NR2B receptor currents (0.98 ± 0.11 of the baseline, mean ± SEM). Whole-cell currents in HEK293 cells coexpressing NR1/NR2B with wDAPK1 were not affected by 50 μM NR2BCT (Figure 3D). Thus, enhancement of the recombinant NR1/NR2B receptor channel conductance is mediated by activated DAPK1 binding with NR2B subunit. We next examined whether an activated DAPK1 phosphorylates NR2B subunit at Ser-1303, (Figure 3E), a residue corresponding to a phosphorylation site (KXXRXXSX) of DAPK1 (Schumacher and Schavocky, 2004Schumacher A.M. Schavocky J.P. Velentza, A. V., Mirzoeva, S. & Waterson, D. M. A calmodulin-regulated protein kinase linked to neuron survival is a substrate for the calmodulin-regulated death-associated protein kinase.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8116-8124Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We coexpressed wDAPK1 or cDAPK1 in HEK293 cells with the recombinant NR1/NR2B or the mutant NR1/NR2BS1303A receptors. In the mutant NR2BS1303A, a Ser-1303 residue was replaced with an alanine (A). The levels of phosphorylation at Ser-1303 (pS1303) were measured using antibody against the pS1303 (anti-pS1303). The anti-pS1303 recognized the recombinant wide NR2B subunit, but not with the mutant NR2BS1303A, demonstrating the specificity of anti-pS1303 reaction (Figure 3E). To determine whether phosphorylation of NR2B at Ser-1303 is sufficient to modulate the NR1/NR2B receptor channel activity, whole-cell currents were recorded from HEK293 cells coexpressing the NR1/NR2B or the mutant NR1/NR2BS1303A with wDAPK1 (Figure 3F) or cDAPK1 (Figure 3G). We found that cDAPK1 increased the peak amplitude of the recombinant NR1/NR2B receptor currents, but not the mutant NR1/NR2BS1303A receptor currents, at a range of holding potentials from −80 to +80 mV (Figure 3G). Thus, an activated DAPK1 enhances NR1/NR2B receptor channel conductance by phosphorylating NR2B subunit at Ser-1303. To determine whether an activated DAPK1 physically and functionally interacts with synaptic NMDA receptor NR2B subunit in vivo, we generated null mutant mice with deficiency in expression of DAPK1 (DAPK1−/− mice). β-gal, a marker for DAPK1 deletion, was observed throughout the brain of the DAPK1−/− mice, including the cortex and hippocampus (Figure 4A ). RT-PCR and western blot analysis revealed undetectable levels of DAPK1 mRNA (Figure 4B) and proteins (Figure 4C) in the DAPK1−/− mice. No difference of DAPK2 and DAPK3 proteins was observed between DAPK1−/− and DAPK1+/+ mice (Figure 4D). We next surveyed several synaptic proteins, including AMPA receptor subunits GluR1 and GluR2, and NMDA receptor subunits NR1, NR2A, and NR2B and PSD-95 (Figure 4D). We confirmed that genetic deletion of DAPK1 does not alter the overall synaptic protein compositions in the brain. We next examined synaptic transmission in the CA1 hippocampus. We analyzed excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs). By plotting the mean amplitude of EPSCs in CA1 pyramidal neurons versus the stimulus intensities, we determined that the input-output curves were identical between genotypes (Figure 4E). The current-voltage (I-V) relations of AMPA receptor- and NMDA receptor-mediated EPSCs (EPSCsAMPA, Figure 4F, and EPSCsNMDA, Figure 4G), and the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP, Figure 4H), also were not affected in the DAPK1−/− mice. Having demonstrated that genetic deletion of DAPK1 did not alter NMDA receptor physiology, we next examined the functional impacts of DAPK1 deletion in NMDA receptor toxicity. First, we treated the cortical neurons from DAPK1−/− and DAPK1+/+ mice with oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD). Catalytic activity of DAPK1 was measured using immune-complex kinase assay with myosin light chain (MLC) as an endogenous substrate. We found that enzymatic activity of DAPK1 began to increase 5 min after OGD, and reached a peak 30 min later (Figure 5A ). Activation of DAPK1 was maintained for over 30 min after OGD was washed out (Figures 5A and 5B). Activation of DAPK1 was not affected by applying AMPA receptor antagonist (10 μM CNQX), but was completely eliminated either by applying NMDA receptor antagonist (50 μM D-AP5) or by removing extracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+-free, Figure 5C). Catalytic activity of DAPK1 is controlled by its autophosphorylation at serine-308 (pS308); dephosphorylation of pS308 allows DAPK1 to bind with CaM, thereby activating DAPK1 (Shohat et al., 2001Shohat G. Spivak-Kroizman T. Cohen O. Bialik S. Shani G. Berrisi H. Eisenstein M. Kimchi A. The pro-apoptotic function of death-associated protein kinase is controlled by a unique inhibitory autophosphorylation-based mechanism.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47460-47467Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Consistent with this previous report, we found that DAPK1 became dephosphorylated at pS308 in cortical neurons following OGD exposure. Significantly, we showed that dephosphorylation of DAPK1 at pS308 was catalyzed by calcineurin (CaN, see also Figure S2).Figure S2CaN Activates DAPK1 in Response to Ischemia, Relates to Figure 5Show full caption(A and B) Representative images of the cultures (DIV18) from DAPK1+/+ (A) and DAPK1−/− (B) mice.

Similar results were observed in each of the four experiments.(C) DAPK1+/+ neuronal cultures (DIV18) were exposed to OGD for 0, 5, 15, or 30 min.

Anti-DAPK1 precipitates were blotted with anti-pS308 or anti-DAPK1 (F). Data are summarized in bar graph (G, n = 4 per group, ∗p < 0.01). Next, we investigated the functional impacts of an activated DAPK1 on NMDA receptor channels in vivo. We challenged the cortical neurons with OGD or with 50 μM NMDA/10 μM glycine for 30 min to activate an endogenous DAPK1. Western blots of the precipitates showed that the levels of pS1303, but not the NR2B protein, were elevated in DAPK1+/+ cortical neurons (Figure 5D). An increase of pS1303 in response to OGD (Figure 5D) or to NMDA challenging (Figures 5E and 5F) was not observed in DAPK1−/− neurons (Figure 5E). Thus, an activated DAPK1 is a response to phosphorylation of NR2B subunit at Ser-1303. To determine whether an increase of the pS1303 level by an activated DAPK1 enhances synaptic NMDA receptor channel activity, we performed fluorescence ratio-metric Ca2+ image combined with whole-cell patch clamp recordings. We found that Ca2+ influx through synaptic NMDA receptor channels were not affected by an activated DAPK1; the peak amplitudes of Ca2+ transients were identical between groups (Figure 5G). Since DAPK1 enhances the channel conductance of the recombinant NR1/NR2B receptors, which are known to be expressed predominantly in the extrasynaptic sites (Tovar and Westbrook, 1999Tovar K.R. Westbrook G.L. The incorporation of NMDA receptors with a distinct subunit composition at nascent hippocampal synapses in vitro.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4180-4188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Brickley et al., 2003Brickley S.G. Misra C. Mok M.H. Mishina M. Cull-Candy S.G. NR2B and NR2D subunits coassemble in cerebellar Golgi cells to form a distinct NMDA receptor subtype restricted to extrasynaptic sites.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4958-4966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we reasoned that an activated DAPK1 may functionally interact with extrasynaptic NMDA receptors. To test this possibility, we recorded the extrasynaptic NMDA receptor-mediated currents (eNMDAc) and Ca2+ transients by blocking synaptic NMDA receptor channels using MK-801 trapping protocol (for details see Experimental Procedure). We treated the single cortical neurons with OGD or 50 μM NMDA for 30 min to activate endogenous DAPK1. After a 30 min recovery period, the whole-cell currents and Ca2+ transients were recorded (Figure 5H). A greater amplitude of eNMDAc and Ca2+ transients was observed in DAPK1+/+ neurons, compared to controls. Thus, an activated DAPK1 increases Ca2+ influx through extrasynaptic NMDA receptor channels. We next examined whether ischemic insult is mediated by DAPK1 induction of injurious Ca2+ influx through extrasynaptic NMDA receptor channels. We challenged cortical cultures with OGD or 50 μM NMDA/10 μM glycine for 60 min. 24 hr after washout cell death was examined. Propidium iodide (PI) staining showed that genetic deletion of the DAPK1 gene sufficiently protected against the insults induced by either OGD or NMDA challenging (Figures 6A and 6B). Next, we subjected the DAPK1−/− and DAPK1+/+ mice with transient global ischemia by occlusion of the common carotid artery for 20 min. Six days after reperfusion, brain sections were stained with Fluoro-Jade (FJ), a marker for degenerating neurons. An unbiased stereological analysis was used to count the FJ-labeled (FJ+) neurons in the CA1 area of the hippocampus, the layer 3 of the cortex, and the striatum. These three groups of neurons were examined because they are known to be vulnerable to transient global ischemic insult (Simon et al., 1984Simon R.P. Swan J.H. Meldrum B.S.

https://openalex.org/W2146614388,"Nuclear pore complexes have recently been shown to play roles in gene activation; however their potential involvement in metazoan transcription remains unclear. Here we show that the nucleoporins Sec13, Nup98, and Nup88, as well as a group of FG-repeat nucleoporins, bind to the Drosophila genome at functionally distinct loci that often do not represent nuclear envelope contact sites. Whereas Nup88 localizes to silent loci, Sec13, Nup98, and a subset of FG-repeat nucleoporins bind to developmentally regulated genes undergoing transcription induction. Strikingly, RNAi-mediated knockdown of intranuclear Sec13 and Nup98 specifically inhibits transcription of their target genes and prevents efficient reactivation of transcription after heat shock, suggesting an essential role of NPC components in regulating complex gene expression programs of multicellular organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2054555589,"Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) mediate transport across the nuclear envelope. In yeast, they also interact with active genes, attracting or retaining them at the nuclear periphery. In higher eukaryotes, some NPC components (nucleoporins) are also found in the nucleoplasm, with a so far unknown function. We have functionally characterized nucleoporin-chromatin interactions specifically at the NPC or within the nucleoplasm in Drosophila. We analyzed genomic interactions of full-length nucleoporins Nup98, Nup50, and Nup62 and nucleoplasmic and NPC-tethered forms of Nup98. We found that nucleoporins predominantly interacted with transcriptionally active genes inside the nucleoplasm, in particular those involved in developmental regulation and the cell cycle. A smaller set of nonactive genes interacted with the NPC. Genes strongly interacting with nucleoplasmic Nup98 were downregulated upon Nup98 depletion and activated on nucleoplasmic Nup98 overexpression. Thus, nucleoporins stimulate developmental and cell-cycle gene expression away from the NPC by interacting with these genes inside the nucleoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2032469042,"Prions are proteins that can assume at least two distinct conformational states, one of which is dominant and self-perpetuating. Previously we found that a translation regulator CPEB from Aplysia, ApCPEB, that stabilizes activity-dependent changes in synaptic efficacy can display prion-like properties in yeast. Here we find that, when exogenously expressed in sensory neurons, ApCPEB can form an amyloidogenic self-sustaining multimer, consistent with it being a prion-like protein. In addition, we find that conversion of both the exogenous and the endogenous ApCPEB to the multimeric state is enhanced by the neurotransmitter serotonin and that an antibody that recognizes preferentially the multimeric ApCPEB blocks persistence of synaptic facilitation. These results are consistent with the idea that ApCPEB can act as a self-sustaining prion-like protein in the nervous system and thereby might allow the activity-dependent change in synaptic efficacy to persist for long periods of time."
https://openalex.org/W1990667548,"Human spermatozoa are quiescent in the male reproductive system and must undergo activation once introduced into the female reproductive tract. This process is known to require alkalinization of sperm cytoplasm, but the mechanism responsible for transmembrane proton extrusion has remained unknown because of the inability to measure membrane conductance in human sperm. Here, by successfully patch clamping human spermatozoa, we show that proton channel Hv1 is their dominant proton conductance. Hv1 is confined to the principal piece of the sperm flagellum, where it is expressed at unusually high density. Robust flagellar Hv1-dependent proton conductance is activated by membrane depolarization, an alkaline extracellular environment, endocannabinoid anandamide, and removal of extracellular zinc, a potent Hv1 blocker. Hv1 allows only outward transport of protons and is therefore dedicated to inducing intracellular alkalinization and activating spermatozoa. The importance of Hv1 for sperm activation makes it an attractive target for controlling male fertility."

Here, we demonstrate that in K5-SOS-dependent mouse skin tumors, autocrine VEGF is required for tumor cell proliferation in a cell-autonomous and angiogenesis-independent manner. VEGF is upregulated in SOS-expressing tumors, and its deletion in epidermal cells delays tumorigenesis by suppressing angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation. Epidermis-specific Flt1 deletion also impairs tumorigenesis and proliferation. Surprisingly, complete tumor inhibition occurs in the absence of VEGF in EGFR mutant mice, demonstrating that VEGFR and EGFR synergize in neoplastic cells to promote tumor growth. Mechanistically, K5-SOS upregulates VEGF, Flt1, and Neuropilin-1 in an Erk-dependent manner, thereby activating an autocrine proliferation loop, whereas EGFR prevents tumor cells from apoptosis.

Activated Ras induces VEGFR, leading to cell-autonomous growth of skin tumor cells The autocrine function of VEGF in tumor growth is independent of angiogenesis VEGFR and EGFR signaling synergize to promote epidermal tumor growth A large fraction of human squamous cell carcinomas exhibits upregulation of VEGFR1 The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family of receptor tyrosine kinases includes ErbB1/EGFR, ErbB2/Neu, ErbB3, and ErbB4 and is activated by ligand-dependent homo- or heterodimerization (Schlessinger, 2002Schlessinger J.

We have shown that transgenic mice expressing an activated form of the Ras activator Son of Sevenless from the keratin 5 promoter (K5-SOS mice) develop spontaneous skin papillomas at 100% penetrance in a wild-type EGFR background. However, in a hypomorphic EGFRwa2/wa2 or null background, K5-SOS-dependent tumor formation is severely impaired (Sibilia et al., 2000Sibilia M. Fleischmann A. Behrens A. Stingl L. Carroll J.

In these mice, the EGFR provides an essential survival signal to tumor cells by activating the antiapoptotic Akt pathway, whereas SOS expression leads to increased proliferation by an unknown mechanism (Sibilia et al., 2000Sibilia M.

Tumors and metastases usually arise as small avascular masses that subsequently induce neovascularization in order to acquire nutrients for continued growth and metastatic spread. This angiogenic switch is induced by factors such as the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secreted by tumor cells (Bergers and Benjamin, 2003Bergers G. Benjamin L.E. Tumorigenesis and the angiogenic switch.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (2857) Google Scholar). VEGF is a key regulator of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis and binds to two related RTKs, VEGFR1/Flt1 and VEGFR2/KDR/Flk1, both of which are primarily expressed on vascular endothelial cells (ECs), and to neuropilins (Nrp), a family of coreceptors known to enhance VEGFR signaling (Ferrara et al., 2003Ferrara N.

The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor system and its role under physiological and pathological conditions.Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 2005; 109: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Disruption of a single VEGF allele is embryonic lethal because of abnormal vasculature. Similarly, Flt1−/− and Flk1−/− mice die in utero because of early defects in the development of hematopoietic and endothelial cells (Ferrara et al., 2003Ferrara N. Gerber H.P. LeCouter J. The biology of VEGF and its receptors.Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (7822) Google Scholar, and references therein). Conditional deletion of VEGF after birth in various organs results in profound vascular anomalies and lethality, whereas VEGF inactivation in older animals is much less traumatic (Gerber et al., 1999Gerber H.P. Hillan K.J. Ryan A.M. Kowalski J. Keller G.A. Rangell L. Wright B.D. Radtke F. Aguet M. Ferrara N. VEGF is required for growth and survival in neonatal mice.Development. 1999; 126: 1149-1159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, VEGF deletion in the endothelial lineage leads to progressive endothelial degeneration and sudden death in mutant mice by 25 weeks of age, suggesting that autocrine VEGF signaling is required for vascular homeostasis (Lee et al., 2007aLee S.

VEGF overexpression is found in many human and murine tumors of epithelial origin and is linked to hypoxia and/or overexpression of various oncogenes, including mutant Ras and activated EGFR (Bergers and Benjamin, 2003Bergers G.

Interestingly, epidermis-specific VEGF deletion impaired carcinogen-induced papilloma formation in mice (Rossiter et al., 2004Rossiter H. Barresi C. Pammer J. Rendl M. Haigh J. Wagner E.F. Tschachler E. Loss of vascular endothelial growth factor a activity in murine epidermal keratinocytes delays wound healing and inhibits tumor formation.Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3508-3516Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and expression of dominant negative (dn) EGFR in a Ras-dependent tumor model resulted in reduced VEGF expression thereby leading to tumor angiogenesis and growth suppression (Casanova et al., 2002Casanova M.L.

Although in vitro it could be shown that VEGFR signaling can mediate intracrine survival of tumor cell lines (Lee et al., 2007bLee T.H. Seng S. Sekine M. Hinton C. Fu Y. Avraham H.K. Avraham S. Vascular endothelial growth factor mediates intracrine survival in human breast carcinoma cells through internally expressed VEGFR1/FLT1.PLoS Med. 2007; 4: e186Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), the expression and function of VEGFRs in tumors in vivo remains controversial. By employing K5-SOS mice, we provide the first demonstration that VEGFR signaling is cell-autonomously required in skin tumor cells to stimulate their proliferation in an autocrine and angiogenesis-independent manner and that VEGFR and EGFR signaling synergize in neoplastic cells to promote tumor growth. We show that epidermal tumor cells of K5-SOS transgenic mice express high levels of VEGF and its receptors Flt1 and Nrp1 in an Erk-dependent manner, and that genetic deletion of epidermal VEGF or Flt1 impairs cancer cell proliferation, thereby resulting in reduced tumor growth. Most importantly, Flt1 is upregulated in the majority of human squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), a common skin neoplasm frequently harboring activating Ras mutations, thereby highlighting the relevance of the murine findings for human epithelial tumor development. We found that K5-SOS expression significantly increased the levels of VEGF messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein secretion in both EGFRwa2/+ and EGFRwa2/wa2 keratinocytes (Figures 1A and 1B). Moreover, VEGF levels were reduced by 40% in EGFRwa2/wa2 and EGFR−/− keratinocytes (Figures 1A and 1B), demonstrating that EGFR and SOS positively control VEGF expression. To investigate the effect of VEGF deletion during skin tumor development, we crossed K5-SOS mice of EGFR wild-type and hypomorphic background with VEGFf/f mice (Gerber et al., 1999Gerber H.P. Hillan K.J. Ryan A.M. Kowalski J. Keller G.A. Rangell L. Wright B.D. Radtke F. Aguet M. Ferrara N.

Cre-mediated VEGF recombination was efficient in epidermal cells and no mRNA and protein were detectable in keratinocytes (Figure 1B, and Figures S1A and S1B available online). In contrast, VEGF expression in skin ECs was not affected (Figures S1C and S1D). Epidermis-specific VEGF deletion significantly delayed the development and reduced the average volume of tumors, which started to appear only after 1.5 months (Figure 1C and Figure S1F). These results indicate that epidermal VEGF deletion significantly impairs K5-SOS-dependent skin tumorigenesis.Figure S1Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Southern blot analysis of keratinocyte DNA isolated from mice of the indicated genotypes showing the non-recombined VEGF floxed allele and the cre-recombined Δ allele.(B) Semiquantitative real-time PCR showing complete absence of mRNA transcription of all VEGF splicing isoforms in keratinocytes isolated from VEGFΔep mice.(C) qRT-PCR measuring the expression of VEGF in FACS-sorted CD31+ CD144+ endothelial cells and double negative cells from wild-type and VEGFΔep mice.(D) Representative Dotplot showing FACS-sorted CD31+ CD144+ endothelial cells.(E) Quantification of Ki67+ cells on epidermal sheets isolated from mice of the indicated genotypes.

The EGF receptor provides an essential survival signal for SOS-dependent skin tumor development.Cell. 2000; 102: 211-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) (Figure 1D and Figure S1G). Interestingly, when both VEGF alleles were deleted in an EGFRwa2/wa2 background, papilloma formation was completely inhibited (Figure 1D). Tumor incidence and the average tumor volume in the absence of one VEGF allele were only slightly delayed (Figure 1D and Figure S1G). Mechanical stress like wounding can induce and accelerate tumor formation in EGFRwa2/wa2 K5-SOS mice, and skin papillomas appear 2 weeks later (Figures 1E and 1F). Therefore, small incisions were applied at the ear tip of EGFRwa2/wa2 K5-SOS mice lacking one or both VEGF alleles. In the presence of only one VEGF allele, tumors were significantly smaller after 35 days (Figures 1E and 1G). In contrast, no tumors had developed in EGFRwa2/wa2 K5-SOS mice lacking both VEGF alleles and these mice remained tumor free for more than 20 months (Figures 1E and 1H). These results demonstrate that no tumors develop in the absence of EGFR and VEGF, suggesting a synergistic effect of EGFR and VEGF signaling in tumor development. As previously described, papillomas of EGFRwa2/wa2 K5-SOS mice were more differentiated, as evidenced by increased numbers of keratin-1+ cells. This was not further affected by the lack of VEGF (Figure S1H) (Sibilia et al., 2000Sibilia M. Fleischmann A. Behrens A. Stingl L. Carroll J. Watt F.M. Schlessinger J. Wagner E.F. The EGF receptor provides an essential survival signal for SOS-dependent skin tumor development.Cell. 2000; 102: 211-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). However, the average vessel area and diameter was much lower in EGFRwa2/+ VEGFΔep K5-SOS tumors compared to the respective controls. Deletion of only one VEGF allele did not affect vascularization in EGFRwa2/wa2 K5-SOS tumors (Figure 1I and Figure S1I). Interestingly, lack of VEGF not only reduced angiogenesis but also dramatically decreased the number of proliferating tumor cells (Figure 1J and Figure S1I). Five times less Ki67+ cells were detectable in papillomas derived from EGFRwa2/+ VEGFΔep K5-SOS mice than in biopsies from controls. Furthermore, deletion of one VEGF allele led to significantly reduced proliferation in wounding-induced tumors of EGFRwa2/wa2 K5-SOS mice (Figure 1J). Epidermal proliferation was also significantly reduced in healthy skin of EGFR wild-type and hypomorphic mice upon VEGF deletion (Figure S1E). These data suggest that VEGF controls epidermal cell proliferation, which in combination with reduced angiogenesis leads to the complete inhibition of tumor formation in EGFRwa2/wa2 VEGFΔep K5-SOS mice. In EGFRwa2/wa2 mice, the EGFR is mutated in all cells, including ECs. To investigate whether functional EGFR signaling is required in a cell-autonomous manner in epidermal cells for tumor induction, we employed conditional EGFR mice (EGFRf/f) (Natarajan et al., 2007Natarajan A. Wagner B. Sibilia M. The EGF receptor is required for efficient liver regeneration.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 17081-17086Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) to delete the EGFR exclusively in the epidermis of VEGFf/f K5-SOS mice. The tamoxifen-inducible K5-CreERT transgenic line (Indra et al., 1999Indra A.K. Warot X. Brocard J. Bornert J.M. Xiao J.H. Chambon P. Metzger D. Temporally-controlled site-specific mutagenesis in the basal layer of the epidermis: comparison of the recombinase activity of the tamoxifen-inducible Cre-ER(T) and Cre-ER(T2) recombinases.Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4324-4327Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) was employed for EGFR (EGFRΔepER) and VEGF (VEGFΔepER) deletion in epidermal cells at different stages of tumor development. Tamoxifen injection led to deletion of EGFR and VEGF in EGFRΔepER tumors and VEGFΔepER keratinocytes, respectively (Figures S2A and S2B). Ear tip wounding was employed to induce tumors in mice of the indicated genotypes (Figure 2A, preventive trial). While tumor onset occurred approximately 2 weeks later in all five groups, the tumor volume was significantly reduced in mice lacking epidermal VEGF both in an EGFRwa2/wa2 and EGFRΔepER background (Figure 2A). Interestingly, deletion of only one VEGF allele in EGFRΔepER mice was enough to severely reduce tumor growth. This was not observed in an EGFRwa2/wa2 background, likely because the hypomorphic EGFR can still signal, although at reduced levels compared to a wild-type EGFR. These results demonstrate that the lack of EGFR expression in the epidermis is sufficient to inhibit K5-SOS-dependent skin tumors in the absence of VEGF.Figure 2Inducible Deletion of EGFR and VEGF and Pharmacological Inhibition of EGFR and VEGF Signaling in K5-SOS Transgenic MiceShow full caption(A) Kinetic of tumor growth measured in mice of the indicated genotypes after ear tip wounding.

See also Figure S2. We next investigated whether VEGF and EGFR are also required for tumor progression. After wounding-induced tumors had developed, mice were treated with tamoxifen to delete VEGF and/or EGFR (Figure 2B, therapeutic trial). While VEGF-expressing tumors continued growing, deletion of VEGF in EGFRwa2/wa2 K5-SOS tumors impaired their further growth and their sizes remained unchanged throughout the entire treatment period. Similar results were obtained if EGFR was deleted along with VEGF (Figure 2B). These results show that VEGF and EGFR are required both during tumor initiation and progression. Anti-EGFR and anti-angiogenic therapies are being employed for the treatment of several human cancers (Bergers and Hanahan, 2008Bergers G. Hanahan D.

We next investigated whether pharmacological inhibition of EGFR and VEGF signaling had a synergistic effect on inhibiting tumor growth. A novel irreversible EGFR inhibitor (BI-2992) (Eskens et al., 2008Eskens F.A. Mom C.H. Planting A.S. Gietema J.A. Amelsberg A. Huisman H. van Doorn L. Burger H. Stopfer P. Verweij J. de Vries E.G.

Whereas treatment with VEGFR inhibitor only mildly inhibited tumor growth, EGFR inhibition significantly impaired tumor growth, leading to tumor stasis for the remaining treatment period (Figure 2C). Interestingly, combined therapy with both inhibitors was even more effective and some tumors completely regressed (Figure 2C). Importantly, when single EGFR inhibitor treatment was stopped, tumor volumes increased very fast. However, tumor regrowth was delayed in tumors treated with both inhibitors, likely because neovascularization had to occur (Figure 2C). Similarly to what was observed in the genetic experiments, tumors treated with EGFR inhibitor were more differentiated (Figure S2C). Interestingly, administration of EGFR or VEGFR inhibitors resulted in a significantly lower blood vessel density and dramatically decreased the number of proliferating tumor cells (Figures 2E and 2F and Figure S2D). Furthermore, EGFR inhibition increased apoptosis, which was enhanced by additional treatment with VEGFR inhibitor (Figure S2D). These results demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of EGFR and VEGFR signaling has a similar effect on tumor growth as their respective genetic deletion. To investigate whether EGFR and VEGF inhibitors are also effective against Ras-dependent tumors, we induced subcutaneous tumors in nude mice with RasV12-transformed NIH 3T3 cells (Sibilia et al., 2000Sibilia M. Fleischmann A. Behrens A. Stingl L. Carroll J. Watt F.M. Schlessinger J. Wagner E.F. The EGF receptor provides an essential survival signal for SOS-dependent skin tumor development.Cell. 2000; 102: 211-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and treated the resulting tumor-bearing mice with the inhibitors. Similar to the results obtained with K5-SOS mice, both inhibitors significantly impaired cancer development (Figure 2D). Anti-EGFR therapy was more efficient than anti-VEGFR treatment and the combination of both was most effective (Figure 2D). Thus, anti-EGFR or anti-VEGFR therapies alone or in combination can be efficiently employed to treat Ras-dependent tumors. To examine whether the absence of tumors in K5-SOS mice lacking EGFR and VEGF was due to a direct effect of VEGF on tumor cells or an indirect mechanism mediated by impaired angiogenesis, we analyzed primary keratinocytes isolated from mice of various genotypes in vitro. Western blot analysis revealed that the levels of Erk1/2 phosphorylation were always high in the presence of K5-SOS, irrespective of the presence of the hypomorphic EGFR al"
https://openalex.org/W2135532366,"The paradigm sirtuin, Sir2p, of budding yeast is required for establishing cellular age asymmetry, which includes the retention of damaged and aggregated proteins in mother cells. By establishing the global genetic interaction network of SIR2 we identified the polarisome, the formin Bni1p, and myosin motor protein Myo2p as essential components of the machinery segregating protein aggregates during mitotic cytokinesis. Moreover, we found that daughter cells can clear themselves of damage by a polarisome- and tropomyosin-dependent polarized flow of aggregates into the mother cell compartment. The role of Sir2p in cytoskeletal functions and polarity is linked to the CCT chaperonin in sir2Delta cells being compromised in folding actin. We discuss the findings in view of recent models hypothesizing that polarity may have evolved to avoid clonal senescence by establishing an aging (soma-like) and rejuvenated (germ-like) lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2109487240,"Satellite cells are skeletal muscle stem cells capable of self-renewal and differentiation after transplantation, but whether they contribute to endogenous muscle fiber repair has been unclear. The transcription factor Pax7 marks satellite cells and is critical for establishing the adult satellite cell pool. By using a lineage tracing approach, we show that after injury, quiescent adult Pax7(+) cells enter the cell cycle; a subpopulation returns to quiescence to replenish the satellite cell compartment, while others contribute to muscle fiber formation. We demonstrate that Sprouty1 (Spry1), a receptor tyrosine kinase signaling inhibitor, is expressed in quiescent Pax7(+) satellite cells in uninjured muscle, downregulated in proliferating myogenic cells after injury, and reinduced as Pax7(+) cells re-enter quiescence. We show that Spry1 is required for the return to quiescence and homeostasis of the satellite cell pool during repair. Our results therefore define a role for Spry1 in adult muscle stem cell biology and tissue repair."
https://openalex.org/W1967802833,"The importance of asymmetric divisions for stem cell function and maintenance is well established in the developing nervous system and the skin; however, its role in gut epithelium and its importance for tumorigenesis is still debated. We demonstrate alignment of mitotic spindles perpendicular to the apical surface specifically in the stem cell compartments of mouse and human intestine and colon. This orientation correlates with the asymmetric retention of label-retaining DNA. Both the preference for perpendicular spindle alignment and asymmetric label retention are lost in precancerous tissue heterozygous for the adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor (Apc). This loss correlates with cell shape changes specifically in the stem cell compartment. Our data suggest that loss of asymmetric division in stem cells might contribute to the oncogenic effect of Apc mutations in gut epithelium.

Mitotic spindles in intestinal stem cells align perpendicularly In precancerous tissue, this spindle orientation bias is lost Spindle alignment correlates with segregation of unreplicated DNA Loss of unreplicated DNA occurs more quickly in precancerous tissue Cells in the gut are continually exposed to damage-inducing factors. This imposes the need for mechanisms to protect long-lived stem cells. The large number of progeny these cells produce makes it imperative to maintain their genetic stability and prevent DNA damage. A recent report showing that mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene (Apc) produce tumors much more efficiently when initiated in the stem cell compartment in the intestine than in the transit-amplifying compartment suggests strongly that Apc is crucial for normal maintenance of stem cell populations (Barker et al., 2009Barker N. Ridgway R.A. van Es J.H. van de Wetering M. Begthel H. van den Born M. Danenberg E. Clarke A.R. Sansom O.J. Clevers H. Crypt stem cells as the cells-of-origin of intestinal cancer.Nature. 2009; 457: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). One mechanism to minimize DNA damage in stem cells is described by Cairns' Hypothesis, which proposes that stem cells retain unreplicated DNA strands to minimize mutations introduced by replication errors (Cairns, 1975Cairns J. Mutation selection and the natural history of cancer.Nature. 1975; 255: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). Asymmetric cell division and a corresponding alignment of mitotic spindles is key to any mechanism that achieves this retention and abolishing such protection may be an important contributing factor in the development of cancer. The specific environment experienced by stem cells provides critical spatial and biochemical information for their behavior. This makes it imperative to examine stem cells in their usual physiological context. The inherent difficulty in imaging opaque biological tissue has made any in vivo analysis of stem cells in adult tissue technically challenging. Furthermore, the three-dimensional organization of intestinal crypts makes them particularly inaccessible: they can be up to 200 μm deep in mouse (even longer in human), 40–60 μm in diameter, and are tightly packed into regular arrays. Thus gaining detailed insights into three-dimensional cellular architecture from two-dimensional histological sections is difficult. We measured spindle orientation in three dimensions in whole-mount samples of gut epithelium from wild-type and Apc heterozygous (ApcMin/+) mice. Previous reports of spindle orientation in wild-type and ApcMin/+ mouse intestinal epithelium were based on 8–10 μm sections and describe only transit-amplifying cells (Bjerknes and Cheng, 1989Bjerknes M.

Planar spindle orientation and asymmetric cytokinesis in the mouse small intestine.J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2007; 55: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, to determine spindle orientation in relation to crypt architecture and to validate and integrate cell biological and visual data, it is necessary to image such samples in toto (Bjerknes and Cheng, 1989Bjerknes M. Cheng H. Mitotic orientation in three dimensions determined from multiple projections.Biophys. J. 1989; 55: 1011-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In addition, examining 8 μm sections limits the mitotic spindles that can be scored to spindle for which both poles are visible in the section. Thus, previous approaches could provide only a limited representation. We used high-resolution multiphoton microscopy to determine spindle orientation of dividing cells in small intestine and colon in three dimensions and compared divisions in the stem cell and transit-amplifying compartments of wild-type and Apc heterozygous and homozygous mutant human and mouse tissue (Appleton et al., 2009Appleton P.L. Quyn A.J. Swift S. Näthke I. Preparation of wholemount mouse intestine for high-resolution three-dimensional imaging using two-photon microscopy.J. Microsc. 2009; 234: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To define stem cell and transit-amplifying compartments in the gut for our analysis, and to differentiate stem from other cells in the crypt, stem cells were visualized with LGR5-GFP (Barker et al., 2007Barker N. van Es J.H. Kuipers J. Kujala P. van den Born M. Cozijnsen M. Haegebarth A. Korving J. Begthel H. Peters P.J. Clevers H. Identification of stem cells in small intestine and colon by marker gene Lgr5.Nature. 2007; 449: 1003-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (3489) Google Scholar). In the small intestine, cells expressing LGR5 reside between fully differentiated Paneth cells and also populate positions 1 to 4 or 7 in many cases (Figure S1A available online). In the colon, where there are no Paneth cells, LGR5 was present in most cells between position 1 and 4 and in many cases up to position 7 (Figure S1B). Based on these observations, we defined the bottom of crypts up to position 7 as the stem cell compartment (SCC) and the region above this as the transit-amplifying compartment (TAC). With this definition, each mitotic cell along the crypt was scored by examination of three-dimensional stacks (Figures S1C and S1D). This classification ensured inclusion of all cells that have been identified as potential stem cells based on different stem cell markers (Potten et al., 2009Potten C.S. Gandara R. Mahida Y.R. Loeffler M. Wright N.A. The stem cells of small intestinal crypts: Where are they?.Cell Prolif. 2009; 42: 731-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This may have introduced some bias, because it is likely that the stem cell compartment as defined for this study was “diluted” with some transit-amplifying or intermediate progenitor cells. Nonetheless, this definition distinguishes between compartments that do or do not contain all stem cells. Mitotic spindles were visualized in three dimensions in intestinal and colonic whole-mount tissue stained with DNA dyes and antibodies that mark centrosomes (Figures 1A and 1B; Figures S1C–S1H). Mitotic cells were identified based on a number of criteria: the displacement of a mitotic nucleus toward the apical surface, its appearance as condensed (both are different in apoptotic cells), and the presence of two pericentrin-positive spots, which tend to be brighter in mitosis and in different positions than in nonmitotic cells (Figures 1A and 1B; Figures S1E–S1H). Only cells for which these criteria were met were used. Marking mitotic cells with anti-phospho-Histone 3 antibodies would have missed cells in later stages of mitosis because dephosphorylation of Histone 3 in early anaphase precludes its reliable detection at later stages of mitosis and ∼50% of all mitoses we scored were in ana- or telophase (data not shown) (Hans and Dimitrov, 2001Hans F. Dimitrov S. Histone H3 phosphorylation and cell division.Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The position of each mitotic cell along the crypt axis was recorded as a function of position from the bottom of the crypt (Figures S1C and S1D). With three-dimensional images, mitotic orientation was scored visually or calculated by a mathematical method that used the recorded spatial coordinates of spindle poles (marked by centrosomes; Figure 1A; Figures S1E–S1H) and the apical surface as reference point (as marked by PAR-3) (Figure 1B; Figure S2) to measure angles of spindle orientation. The axis that runs perpendicular to the apical surface of the epithelium within which the dividing cell lay was used as reference axis so that a mitotic spindle orientated toward the center of the crypt at an angle 0°–30° from this reference line was scored as perpendicular (Figure 1C). The use of both the visual and mathematical methods to measure spindle orientation revealed differences between mitotic spindle orientation in the stem cell and the transit-amplifying compartment (Figure 1D). In wild-type mouse tissue, cells near the base of crypts tended to orient their spindles perpendicular to the apical surface of the epithelium (55%), whereas they oriented more parallel above position 7 (26% perpendicular). This was the case in small intestine and colonic crypts (Figure 1F). To determine whether cells maintained apical-basal polarity during mitosis and thus whether perpendicular orientation reflected an asymmetry in division, we examined the localization of PAR-3, an integral member of the PAR-aPKC complex (Ahringer, 2003Ahringer J. Control of cell polarity and mitotic spindle positioning in animal cells.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The localization of PAR-3 remained apical regardless of cell cycle stage or spindle orientation (Figure 1B; Figure S2). To relate our results showing preferred perpendicular spindle alignment in intestinal stem cell compartments in mice to human tissue, we also measured spindle orientation and PAR-3 localization in normal human tissue samples. The relative difference between spindle orientation in stem cell and transit-amplifying compartments of human small intestine and colon was similar to that observed in mouse (small intestine, SCC 63% versus TAC 18%; colon, SCC 36% versus TAC 13%) (Figure 1G). Mutations in the Apc tumor suppressor gene are the most prevalent initiating mutations in colorectal cancers and are also responsible for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). The Apc protein interacts with cytoskeletal proteins and these interactions may be altered even when Apc is heterozygous because interactions between N-terminal Apc fragments produced by mutated alleles may alter protein interactions of the remaining wild-type copy (Green et al., 2005Green R.A.

Abnormalities in spindle orientation have indeed been described in the intestines of ApcMin/+ mice; however, previous data examined only the transit-amplifying compartment (Caldwell et al., 2007Caldwell C.M.

Spindle misorientation in tumors from APC(min/+) mice.Mol. Carcinog. 2009; 48: 592-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Our high-resolution, three-dimensional analysis revealed no bias toward perpendicular spindle orientation in the stem cell compartment of ApcMin/+ mouse intestine or FAP human intestine. Fewer cells in the stem cell compartment divided perpendicular to the apical surface in both ApcMin/+ mouse and FAP tissue than in wild-type tissue (26% 0°–30° and 18% 0°–30°, respectively). The distribution of these angles is significantly different from those in the corresponding wild-type tissue (p = 0.03 for SCC in mouse small intestine, p = 0.02 for SCC in colon; p = not significant for all TAC comparisons) (Figure 1F). Importantly, the Apc truncation mutations in the FAP patients we used in our analysis lie beyond the 20 amino acid repeats and thus should not interfere with normal regulation of Wnt signaling. Polarity of dividing cells as marked by PAR-3 was the same in ApcMin/+ tissue as in wild-type tissue (Figure 1; Figure S2). We also measured spindle orientation in human adenomas. The pattern was similar to that observed in macroscopically normal human FAP tissue (Figure 1G). Despite the disordered architecture associated with adenomas, localization of PAR-3 to tight junctions indicated that cellular polarity was maintained (data not shown). To identify other markers of asymmetric cell division, we also examined the distribution of labeled DNA in dividing cells in the stem cell and transit-amplifying compartments. Mice were irradiated to eliminate stem cells in the gut, injected with EdU during the regeneration phase to label DNA, and then left to recover for 8 days. During this time, the label present in the majority of proliferating cells diluted to subthreshold levels, leaving EdU only in label-retaining cells (LRCs) in the base of the crypt. The elimination of stem cells and their subsequent recovery in response to this treatment was confirmed by (1) the disappearance of LGR5-GFP-positive cells after the irradiation and (2) the presence of EdU in non-Paneth cells at the base of crypts in cells at position 1–4 after the 8 day chase (Figure S4). The distribution of LRCs along the crypt axis was similar to that in previously published reports that used BrdU (Figure S4B; Potten et al., 2002Potten C.S. Owen G. Booth D. Intestinal stem cells protect their genome by selective segregation of template DNA strands.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2381-2388PubMed Google Scholar). We identified a total of 50 mitotic LRCs, 46 in wild-type tissue and 4 in ApcMin/+ (total number of LRC = 2585; wild-type n = 1853; ApcMin/+ n = 732). EdU was asymmetrically localized only in dividing LRCs in wild-type tissue. DNA distributions that could be scored unambiguously were almost always in cells in ana- or telophase, whereas metaphase cells constituted the bulk of the cells with ambiguous DNA distributions. In each case where asymmetric DNA localization was unambiguously visible, spindle orientation was perpendicular and the labeled DNA localized to the basal side of the dividing cell (Figure 2). This result established a strong correlation between perpendicularly aligned mitotic spindles and asymmetric retention of labeled DNA. In ApcMin/+ tissue, EdU was either distributed symmetrically, consistent with randomly aligned spindles in this tissue, or the localization was ambiguous and could not be clearly classified. Significantly, the dividing cells in wild-type tissue that unambiguously retained EdU label asymmetrically were all located at cell position 4 or below (Figure 2B), suggesting that our labeling experiment targeted both recently identified inter-Paneth cell stem cells and previously identified stem cells at position 4 (Figure S3) and that these cells can selectively retain unreplicated DNA (Barker et al., 2007Barker N. van Es J.H. Kuipers J. Kujala P. van den Born M. Cozijnsen M. Haegebarth A. Korving J. Begthel H. Peters P.J. Clevers H.

Mahida Y.R. Loeffler M. Wright N.A. The stem cells of small intestinal crypts: Where are they?.Cell Prolif. 2009; 42: 731-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The correlation between asymmetric distribution of labeled DNA and perpendicular alignment of mitotic spindles, and the decrease in this alignment in ApcMin/+ tissue, predicted that LRCs should be more rapidly lost from ApcMin/+ tissue. To test this hypothesis, we measured retention and distribution of EdU in 12-week-old ApcMin/+ and wild-type littermates after irradiation. The number of basal LRCs per crypt varied between small intestine and colon and between wild-type and ApcMin/+ intestine. Fewer LRCs were present in ApcMin/+ tissue in both regions of the gut (p = 0.002) (Figure 3; Figure S4). Notably, there were no LRCs in adenomatous polyps (Figure 3). Equal uptake of EdU in wild-type and ApcMin/+ mice tissue was confirmed by LRC number in mice sacrificed 1 day after completion of injections (Figure S4A). The outcome of stem cell divisions is controlled by the coordinated action of (1) extrinsic factors from the surrounding niche that specify stem cell identity and (2) intrinsic cellular factors that act at the centrosome and the cell cortex to orient the plane of cell division with respect to the environment (Pearson and Bloom, 2004Pearson C.G. Bloom K. Dynamic microtubules lead the way for spindle positioning.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In addition, cell shape may constrain the orientation of mitotic spindles and thus contribute to asymmetric alignment (Théry and Bornens, 2006Théry M. Bornens M. Cell shape and cell division.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). To identify potential mechanisms that contribute to the different spindle orientation in wild-type and ApcMin/+ tissue, we examined the cellular architecture of the crypt base. We found that cell shape is different in the crypt base in wild-type and ApcMin/+ tissue (Figure 4). PAR-3 localization to adherens junctions revealed a regularly spaced, highly crowded arrangement of apical cell junctions between cells in the crypt base in wild-type intestine (Figures 4A–4C). In ApcMin/+ tissue, this pattern was irregular, suggesting that the apical surface of cells is highly variable with many much larger apical domains (Figures 4E–4G). This is particularly evident when examining Z-projections (Figures 4B, 4C, 4F, and 4G). The cells that line the intestinal tract are among the most rapidly proliferating cells in the body. The average lifetime of epithelial cells in this tissue is less than 5 days and differentiated cells are continuously replaced from a stable stem cell pool near the base of intestinal crypts. These self-renewing stem cells produce rapidly proliferating transit-amplifying cells that differentiate into the different cell lineages that populate gut epithelium. Just as in skin and the developing nervous system, in gut epithelium this is achieved by divisions of stem cells to produce one daughter stem cell and one differentiating cell (Morrison and Kimble, 2006Morrison S.J. Kimble J. Asymmetric and symmetric stem-cell divisions in development and cancer.Nature. 2006; 441: 1068-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). However, unlike for skin and the nervous system, asymmetric divisions have not been directly demonstrated in gut epithelium and the importance of such divisions for normal maintenance of this tissue have not been examined. Here, we provide evidence for the preferred perpendicular alignment of mitotic spindles specifically in the stem cell compartment of small and large intestine in mouse and man, by using three-dimensional images of whole-mount tissue. Divisions in the transit-amplifying compartments oriented preferentially symmetrically or showed no bias. Together with our finding that this alignment correlated with the asymmetric segregation of unreplicated DNA strands to the basal side of dividing cells, these data lend support to the idea that Cairns' hypothesis can apply to cells in the stem cell compartment of gut epithelium. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the western world, making it particularly important to understand the contribution of stem cell biology to the formation of tumors in this tissue. Mutations in Apc are common to most colorectal tumors, and evidence for a role of Apc in asymmetric cell division is available from null mutants in yeast and Drosophila (Schuyler and Pellman, 2001Schuyler S.C. Pellman D. Search, capture and signal: Games microtubules and centrosomes play.J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 247-255PubMed Google Scholar, Yamashita et al., 2003Yamashita Y.M. Jones D.L. Fuller M.T. Orientation of asymmetric stem cell division by the APC tumor suppressor and centrosome.Science. 2003; 301: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, Yamashita et al., 2007Yamashita Y.M. Mahowald A.P. Perlin J.R. Fuller M.T. Asymmetric inheritance of mother versus daughter centrosome in stem cell division.Science. 2007; 315: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role of asymmetric divisions and the resulting protection of unreplicated DNA in tumorigenesis, adenoma, which usually lack wild-type Apc, do not retain labeled DNA and orient their spindles randomly (Figure 1, Figure 3). Importantly, we show that heterozygosity of Apc, i.e., a precancerous state, already leads to loss of perpendicular alignment of mitotic spindles, which is predicted to mark asymmetric divisions. The conclusion that such perpendicular alignment that places two daughter cells in different environments predicts asymmetric cell fate is formally contingent upon the assumption that the direction of the spindle predicts the distribution of the daughter cells within the interphase crypt column. Only observations in live tissue can resolve whether differently positioned nuclei of daughter cells that result from such asymmetric alignment translate into different fates when their nuclei are repositioned after completing mitosis. However, our finding that loss of perpendicularly oriented divisions correlate with loss of the ability to retain template DNA, specifically in gut epithelial stem cell compartments, suggests that mitotic spindle alignment may predict symmetry of division (Figure 1). There are a number of potential mechanisms that govern the orientation of mitotic spindles and the outcome of stem cell divisions. These include the coordinated action of (1) extrinsic factors from the surrounding niche that specify stem cell identity and (2) intrinsic cellular factors that act at the centrosome and the cell cortex to orient the plane of cell division with respect to the environment (Pearson and Bloom, 2004Pearson C.G. Bloom K. Dynamic microtubules lead the way for spindle positioning.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Although in adenomas without any Apc astral microtubules fail to establish adequate cortical attachments, astral microtubules examined in two-dimensional tissue sections of ApcMin/+ tissue appeared normal, suggesting that cortical connections of mitotic spindles are normal in Apc heterozygous tissue (Caldwell et al., 2007Caldwell C.M. Green R.A. Kaplan K.B. APC mutations lead to cytokinetic failures in vitro and tetraploid genotypes in Min mice.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 1109-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, Fleming et al., 2007Fleming E.S. Zajac M. Moschenross D.M. Montrose D.C. Rosenberg D.W. Cowan A.E. Tirnauer J.S.

Spindle misorientation in tumors from APC(min/+) mice.Mol. Carcinog. 2009; 48: 592-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Another mechanism that can contribute to spindle alignment is cell shape, which can constrain the orientation of mitotic spindles and thus contribute to asymmetric alignment (Théry and Bornens, 2006Théry M. Bornens M. Cell shape and cell division.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). We found that cell shape in Apc heterozygous crypts was more irregular, with less constricted apical domains a common feature. A wider apical domain in the stem cell compartment of ApcMin/+ tissue might contribute to more random spindle orientation (Figure 4). Mitotic nuclei are positioned toward the apical domain of cells in gut epithelium, and the normally narrow apical space in the stem cell compartment in wild-type tissue may force perpendicular alignment of mitotic spindles (Figure 4). The wider space in ApcMin/+ tissue, on the other hand, could permit parallel orientation more readily (Figure 4). Thus changes in cell shape in ApcMin/+ tissue may account for loss of asymmetric orientation in ApcMin/+ mice, specifically in the stem cell compartment (Figure 4). How loss of one allele of Apc induces such cell shape changes, whether changes in the signaling activity of β-catenin are to blame, and/or whether other, β-catenin-independent functions like changes in the cytoskeleton are involved will require more detailed experiments. Our results also raise the important question of how selective partitioning of DNA strands is accomplished in this system and how Apc contributes to this process. Overall, the loss of stem cell protection in cancer-prone tissue has important implications for tumor biology. We propose that this loss increases the probability of generating potentially cancerous cells, which could drive the development of neoplasia. Together with other changes that result from Apc heterozygosity, this may tip the balance so that complete loss of Apc and/or other oncogenic mutations can immediately and effectively initiate neoplasia. All experiments were performed under the UK Home Office guidelines. Wild-type, ApcMin/+ CL57BL/6, and LGR5-GFP mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and intestines were removed. 0.5 cm long sections of midjejunum were fixed in methanol at −20°C and stored overnight at −20°C. EdU labeling during postirradiation crypt regeneration was performed on mice irradiated with 8 Gy to the whole body. During regeneration, which takes 2–3 days, EdU at a dose of 1 mg per injection was given at 8 hourly intervals for the first 48 hr postirradiation. The animals were left for 8 days before being sacrificed. During this time, the label present in the majority of the proliferating cells diluted to subthreshold levels, leaving label-retaining cells (LRCs) only in the crypt. Collection of tissue samples was approved by the Tayside Tissuebank subcommittee of the Local Research Ethics Committee. Normal human samples were obtained from surgical resections for hemicolectomy performed for various indications. After specimen removal, macroscopically normal appearing samples were excised by a consultant pathologist (FAC) and divided into 0.5 cm sections. Human adenoma specimens were also obtained from clinically resected samples. Normal colonic biopsies from familial adenomatous polyposis patients were obtained endoscopically during routine colonoscopy surveillance. All specimens were fixed in −20°C methanol and stored at −20°C overnight. Full details for staining and handling gut tissue samples for multiphoton microscopy have been described previously (Appleton et al., 2009Appleton P.L. Quyn A.J. Swift S. Näthke I. Preparation of wholemount mouse intestine for high-resolution three-dimensional imaging using two-photon microscopy.J. Microsc. 2009; 234: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In brief, methanol-fixed tissue (2 × 2 mm) was rinsed in PBS, then permeabilized. The following primary antibodies were used in combination with appropriate Alexa-Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:500, Molecular Probes): rabbit polyclonal pericentrin (Abcam ab4448), 1:500; rabbit polyclonal PAR-3 (Upstate 07-330), 1:250. Colonic goblet cells were identified by staining mucous with rhodamine-labeled Dolichos Biflorus Agglutinin lectin at 20 μgmes per ml (RL-1032, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, USA). Paneth cell lysozyme was stained with a rabbit anti-lysozyme antibody at 1:100 (18-0039, Zymed, Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). Mitotic cells were identified with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Histone3 - phospho S10 at 1:250 (ab5176, Abcam, Cambridge, UK). DAPI at a concentration of 50 μg/ml was added to the secondary antibody incubation solution. Specimens were rinsed and immersed in increasingly concentrated dilutions of TDE (2,2-thiodiethanol) (10%, 25%, 50%, 97%) in a stepwise manner. Imaging was carried out with a Biorad Radiance 2100MP multiphoton microscope. Stacks were collected at 0.5 μm intervals and were imported into Volocity 4.2 (Improvision) for analysis. Spindle orientation was measured with 3-dimensional reconstructions of serial stacks. Spindle angle relative to the crypt center was calculated from the spindle axis vector and a vector from the spindle axis center to the center of the crypt (see Figure 1C). Calculations were performed with Xcode 2.3. Orientations were strictly positive, with a maximum of 90°, which corresponded to spindles parallel to the basal membrane. To confirm accuracy of calculations, measurements were also performed visually by scoring relative spindle orientation by eye in the same images. Scoring by two independent scorers, who were blinded to the origin of the samples, produced the same distribution of spindle orientation angles as the calculations. The position of mitotic cells along the crypt axis was determined by counting cell position from the crypt base. Results were subjected to statistical analysis with SPSS v16.0 software. Two-tailed p values were calculated with unpaired Student's t tests. The authors wish to thank all the members of the Light Microscopy Facility of the University of Dundee for their imaging expertise and Professor Mark Chaplain and Ignacio Ramis-Conde (University of Dundee) for developing the Xcode program used to calculate spindle angles.

In vitro, TGF-β not only induces reversible cell cycle arrest, but also promotes melanocyte immaturity by downregulating MITF, the master transcriptional regulator of melanocyte differentiation, and its downstream melanogenic genes. In vivo, TGF-β signaling is activated in melanocyte stem cells when they reenter the quiescent noncycling state during the hair cycle and this process requires Bcl2 for cell survival. Furthermore, targeted TGF-β type II receptor (TGFbRII) deficiency in the melanocyte lineage causes incomplete maintenance of melanocyte stem cell immaturity and results in mild hair graying.

In a niche, stem cells are able to self-renew with high probability and they divide infrequently. The important roles of the niche for stem cell maintenance have been demonstrated in several stem cell systems (Scadden, 2006Scadden D.T.

Genetic studies have revealed a variety of genes essential for stem cell regulation, especially in Drosophila germline stem cells, mouse hematopoietic stem cells, and epidermal stem cells. However, the intricate molecular mechanisms that underlie maintenance of stem cells by the surrounding niche environment are not well understood in many vertebrate stem cell systems, at least partly because of the difficulties in identifying and visualizing stem cells and their niches in tissue structures. Melanocyte stem cells have been identified in a distinct tissue structure called the bulge (Nishimura et al., 2002Nishimura E.K. Jordan S.A. Oshima H. Yoshida H. Osawa M. Moriyama M. Jackson I.J. Barrandon Y. Miyachi Y. Nishikawa S. Dominant role of the niche in melanocyte stem-cell fate determination.Nature. 2002; 416: 854-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar), an area that is mostly populated by follicular keratinocyte stem cells (Cotsarelis, 2006Cotsarelis G.

Defining the epithelial stem cell niche in skin.Science. 2004; 303: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar) and that lies on the basement membrane to which the arrector pili muscle is attached. Our previous study demonstrated that the niche plays a dominant role in melanocyte stem cell fate determination (Nishimura et al., 2002Nishimura E.K. Jordan S.A. Oshima H. Yoshida H. Osawa M.

Dominant role of the niche in melanocyte stem-cell fate determination.Nature. 2002; 416: 854-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Indeed, the melanocyte stem cell compartment becomes regionally segregated away from the hair matrix where the amplifying and differentiating cell compartment resides after stem cell division (a schematic is shown in Figure 1L). Thus the different fates of the stem cell compartment and the amplifying and differentiating compartments can be explained by stem cell niche-specific cues in the bulge area and/or by activating signals from the maturing cell niche, the hair matrix in hair follicles. We previously identified two genes, Bcl2 and Mitf, that are essential for melanocyte stem cell maintenance (Nishimura et al., 2005Nishimura E.K. Granter S.R. Fisher D.E. Mechanisms of hair graying: Incomplete melanocyte stem cell maintenance in the niche.Science. 2005; 307: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Melanocyte stem cells are usually maintained in a quiescent (noncycling) state and are activated only at early anagen (the growing phase) to undergo stem cell division. Bcl2 is essential for the survival of melanocyte stem cells at the stage where they return to the quiescent state (Nishimura et al., 2005Nishimura E.K. Granter S.R. Fisher D.E. Mechanisms of hair graying: Incomplete melanocyte stem cell maintenance in the niche.Science. 2005; 307: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Mitf, the master transcriptional regulator of melanocyte development (Steingrímsson et al., 2004Steingrímsson E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Melanocytes and the microphthalmia transcription factor network.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 365-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, Levy et al., 2006Levy C. Khaled M. Fisher D.E. MITF: Master regulator of melanocyte development and melanoma oncogene.Trends Mol. Med. 2006; 12: 406-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar), is also essential for melanocyte stem cell maintenance by preventing premature differentiation/pigmentation of melanocyte stem cells in the niche (Nishimura et al., 2005Nishimura E.K. Granter S.R. Fisher D.E. Mechanisms of hair graying: Incomplete melanocyte stem cell maintenance in the niche.Science. 2005; 307: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). However, extrinsic signals that act dominantly upon the melanocyte stem cell niche have not been thus far identified. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) is a multifunctional cytokine that plays important roles in the induction of apoptosis, cellular growth arrest, and other physiological and pathological responses (Siegel and Massagué, 2003Siegel P.M.

The role of TGF-β in stem cell quiescence has been suggested in hematopoietic stem cells (Batard et al., 2000Batard P. Monier M.N. Fortunel N. Ducos K. Sansilvestri-Morel P. Phan T. Hatzfeld A.

There are three mammalian isoforms of TGF-β (1, 2, and 3) that signal through type I and type II TGF-β receptors. Signaling can occur only in the presence of both types of receptors and their downstream intracellular mediators (Smad2/3) that subsequently enter the nucleus where transcription of their target genes is regulated. In the skin, TGF-βs are expressed by the regressing hair follicle strand and their role in hair follicle regression through the induction of apoptosis has been well established (Foitzik et al., 2000Foitzik K.

Recent gene expression profiling studies of epidermal label-retaining keratinocytes in the hair follicle bulge region suggest that TGF-β signaling is active in hair follicle keratinocyte stem cells (Tumbar et al., 2004Tumbar T. Guasch G. Greco V. Blanpain C. Lowry W.E. Rendl M. Fuchs E. Defining the epithelial stem cell niche in skin.Science. 2004; 303: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar) that reside together in the niche microenvironment with melanocyte stem cells. The significant expression of TGF-β-induced factors in the bulge area and the growth inhibitory functions of TGF-β (Massagué and Gomis, 2006Massagué J. Gomis R.R. The logic of TGFbeta signaling.FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2811-2820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar) suggested to us that TGF-β is a candidate niche-derived factor that might transmit quiescence signals to melanocyte stem cells. To examine this, we tested the effects of TGF-β on melanocytes in vitro and in vivo and demonstrate that TGF-β signaling plays dual roles in melanocyte stem cell maintenance through the inhibition of stem cell differentiation in the stem cell niche and the induction of stem cell quiescence. Melanoblasts that colonize the hair follicle bulge are inactivated at the final stage of hair follicle morphogenesis and thereafter function as the melanocyte stem cell population (Nishimura et al., 2002Nishimura E.K. Jordan S.A. Oshima H. Yoshida H. Osawa M. Moriyama M. Jackson I.J. Barrandon Y. Miyachi Y. Nishikawa S. Dominant role of the niche in melanocyte stem-cell fate determination.Nature. 2002; 416: 854-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, Nishimura et al., 2005Nishimura E.K. Granter S.R. Fisher D.E. Mechanisms of hair graying: Incomplete melanocyte stem cell maintenance in the niche.Science. 2005; 307: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). That population is activated at the beginning of each hair regeneration cycle (early anagen) to self-renew but is inactivated again by midanagen. Thus, we hypothesized that melanocyte stem cells enter the quiescent (noncycling) inactivated state in response to external cues from the stem cell niche at a particular stage. To test this hypothesis and to understand the mechanism of stem cell entry into the dormant noncycling state, we first examined changes in morphology and expression of melanogenic genes and the cell cycle progression marker Ki67 in melanocyte stem cells after colonization of the hair follicle bulge. As shown in Figures 1A–1H and Figure S1 (available online), profound downregulation of melanogenic factors including MITF (Figures 1A and 1B; Figure S1A), tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TRP1) (Figures 1C–1F; Figure S1B), tyrosinase (Figures 1G and 1H; Figure S1C), and dopachrome tautomerase (DCT) (Figures 1A and 1B; Figure S1A) were detected by the end of hair follicle morphogenesis (stage 8). Expression of PAX3 and KIT were maintained longer (Figures 1C–1H; Figure S1B) but were subsequently downregulated gradually (data not shown). We then found that these events are preceded by a loss of Ki67 expression at approximately stage 5 (standardized hair follicle stages based on Paus et al., 1999Paus R. Müller-Röver S. Van Der Veen C.

Interestingly, downregulation of Ki67 and melanogenic gene expression at the time of stem cell entry into quiescence was similarly found in the following cycles (Figures 1I, 1J, and 1L and data not shown). To examine the possible involvement of TGF-β in the process of stem cell entry into the noncycling state (stem cell dormancy), we first examined the expression of TGF-βs in hair follicles at different follicle stages. As shown in Figures 2A and 2B, TGF-β1/2 expression was found in the bulge area of follicles starting at around stage 6 and was significantly high at stage 7 (Figures 2A and 2B). Smad2, which is directly phosphorylated by TGF-β receptors, was also found in transgenically tagged (LacZ+) immature melanoblasts and surrounding keratinocytes in the bulge area (Figures 2C and 2E–2G). The phospho-Smad2 signal was strong in those immature melanoblasts in the bulge area of stage 6 and 7 follicles and was then gradually downregulated at stage 8 (Figures 2F and 2G). Interestingly, TGF-β1/2 expression was upregulated again after stem cell division and was maintained in the bulge area during anagen, followed by a gradual downregulation from catagen to telogen (data not shown). On the other hand, the expression of TGF-β1/2 and phospho-Smad2 was low and often undetectable in the pigmented junctional epithelium, such as the mucocutaneous junction of the mouse eyelid where pigmented melanocytes are abundantly located in the basal layer of the epithelium (Figures S2Ab–S2Ae). Taken together, the coincident expression patterns of TGF-β1/2 and phospho-Smad2 in the stem cell niche suggest that TGF-β signaling is active when melanocyte stem cells enter the dormant state and maintain their immaturity. To examine the possible function of TGF-β in stem cell maintenance, including the maintenance of stem cell immaturity and the induction of stem cell dormancy in vivo, we tested the impact of TGF-βs on melanocyte proliferation and differentiation in vitro. First, we performed cell cycle analysis of primary cultured melanocytes treated with TGF-β1/2. As shown in Figure 3A, TGF-β induced a significant accumulation of cells in G1 and a reduction of cells in S/G2M. Furthermore, the reduction by TGF-β could be rescued by concomitant stimulation with SCF (Kit ligand [KITL], a survival/mitogenic factor for the melanocyte lineage), although SCF did not significantly promote accumulation of cells in S/G2M. The standard culture medium used for primary melanocytes contains TPA, which is essential for melanocyte survival and proliferation in vitro. TPA can be replaced by various melanocyte survival factors including SCF, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), or endothelin 1/3 (data not shown). SCF expression has been detected in follicular keratinocyte stem cells of the bulge area (Tumbar et al., 2004Tumbar T. Guasch G. Greco V. Blanpain C. Lowry W.E. Rendl M. Fuchs E. Defining the epithelial stem cell niche in skin.Science. 2004; 303: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar), the stem cell niche for melanocyte stem cells. We therefore examined potential interactions of SCF with TGF-β on cell growth/survival. As shown in Figure 3B, melanocyte cell number was balanced by SCF and TGF-β in a dose-dependent manner, with similar results seen in the tetrazolium salt-based proliferation assay (WST assay) or by direct cell counting. Melanocytes treated with TGF-β without any melanocyte survival/growth factors (such as SCF, endothelin1/3, or bFGF) underwent apoptosis within 24–48 hr. Concomitant treatment of melanocytes with those factors completely blocked TGF-β1/2-induced apoptosis (Figure S3A). Melanoma cells, most of which exhibit constitutively active MAPK because of B-raf (Davies et al., 2002Davies H. Bignell G.R. Cox C. Stephens P. Edkins S. Clegg S. Teague J. Woffendin H. Garnett M.J.

Oncol. 2006; 24: 4340-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar) mutations, were resistant to TGF-β treatment (Figure S3B). Although multiple potential mechanisms could account for TGF-β resistance in melanoma cells, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that melanoma cells have escaped the physiologic role of TGF-β to induce quiescence. During development, immature melanoblasts show characteristic small and bipolar cell bodies rather than large dendritic cell bodies (Nishimura et al., 1999Nishimura E.K. Yoshida H. Kunisada T. Nishikawa S.I. Regulation of E- and P-cadherin expression correlated with melanocyte migration and diversification.Dev. Biol. 1999; 215: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Melanocyte stem cells that are entering the quiescent/inactivated state also show reductions in the number of dendrites and in the cell size (Figure 1). Treatment of primary cultured melanocytes with TGF-β significantly reduces the number of dendrites and the cell size and produces a discretely bipolar morphology (Figures 3C and 3D), so TGF-β might explain a set of melanocyte stem cell changes including not only morphological changes but also downregulation of melanogenic genes such as tyrosinase. Tyrosinase is the rate-limiting enzyme involved in melanin synthesis, and its activity is a marker for melanocyte differentiation. The dopa reaction assay was utilized to assess tyrosinase activity in primary melanocytes treated with TGF-β and other (control) factors. The activity was examined with the same number of viable melanocytes. As shown in Figures 3E and 3G, a significant reduction of tyrosinase activity was detected after treatment with TGF-β. An induction of tyrosinase activity was observed with forskolin (FSK), as previously described (Suzuki et al., 1997Suzuki I. Tada A. Ollmann M.M. Barsh G.S. Im S. Lamoreux M.L. Hearing V.J. Nordlund J.J. Abdel-Malek Z.A. Agouti signaling protein inhibits melanogenesis and the response of human melanocytes to alpha-melanotropin.J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 108: 838-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and the effect of FSK was partially antagonized by concomitant treatment with TGF-β. Furthermore, TGF-β treatment maintained primary cultured melanocytes in an unpigmented state as shown in Figure 3F. These data suggest that TGF-β downregulates tyrosinase, the critical and rate-limiting enzyme for melanin synthesis, a specific marker for lineage differentiation. To examine how tyrosinase activity is inhibited by TGF-β treatment, we studied the expression of phospho-Smad2 and MITF, the transcriptional master regulator of the melanocyte lineage. As shown in Figure 4, TGF-β induces Smad2 phosphorylation (Figure 4A) as well as the downregulation of MITF protein expression (Figures 4B and 4C). Mitf mRNA expression was also decreased significantly by 3 hr (Figure 4D). Moreover, the downregulation of MITF protein expression was associated with a reduction of downstream target gene expression including tyrosinase (Figure 4C). Thus, the TGF-β induction of cell cycle arrest, loss of dendricity, and reduction in cell size and the functional inactivation of the melanocyte lineage are associated with the downregulation of MITF and its downstream genes, strongly suggesting important functional roles of TGF-β in maintaining melanocyte stem cell immaturity and quiescence. To examine the role of the TGF-β signaling pathway in the melanocyte lineage, we bred TGFBRIIfx/fx mice (Cazac and Roes, 2000Cazac B.B. Roes J. TGF-beta receptor controls B cell responsiveness and induction of IgA in vivo.Immunity. 2000; 13: 443-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) to knockin mice expressing Cre recombinase under control of the Dct promoter (Dctcre/cre knockin mice). These mice were further bred with Dct-lacZ transgenic mice to tag the melanocyte lineage cells. As shown in Figures 5A–5C, TGFBRIIfx/fx; Dctcre/cre mice (cKO) exhibited mild but accelerated hair graying (with 73.3% penetrance) within 10 months after birth, whereas TGFBRII+/+;Dctcre/cre control mice (con) did not. Histologically, the bulge area of midanagen hair follicles from homozygous cKO mice began to show ectopically pigmented melanocytes with dendritic morphologies starting from the second hair cycle (Figures 5E, 5G, and 5I). These ectopically differentiated melanocytes were preferentially found in follicles that have pigmentation defects in the hair matrix (Figure 5K and data not shown). Some of those follicles had completely lost Dct-lacZ+ cells in the bulge area (Figures 5L and 5M), which suggests that the melanocyte stem cells had prematurely differentiated and were eventually depleted from the stem cell niche. In contrast, Dct-lacZ+ melanoblasts are maintained in the bulge area of control follicles in an immature and quiescent state with small cell bodies and few dendrites in the bulge area (Figures 5D, 5F, 5H, and 5J). Thus, these histological findings suggest that melanocyte stem cells in cKO mice either failed to return to quiescence (i.e., were slow to return to the quiescent state undergoing premature differentiation in the niche) or alternatively that a defective stem cell progeny failed to migrate from the bulge to the hair matrix. Because the dendritic melanocytes in the bulge did not continue to accumulate in the bulge area with age but rather were lost in follicles that had lost mature melanocytes in the hair matrix, the latter possibility was unlikely. This phenotype of ectopically pigmented melanocytes (EPM) in the bulge resembles previous observations of rare pigmented melanocytes in the niche in mice under genotoxic stress or in aging wild-type mice, in Mitfvit/vit mutant mice, and in Col17a1-deficient mice (Nishimura et al., 2005Nishimura E.K. Granter S.R. Fisher D.E. Mechanisms of hair graying: Incomplete melanocyte stem cell maintenance in the niche.Science. 2005; 307: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, Inomata et al., 2009Inomata K. Aoto T. Binh N.T. Okamoto N. Tanimura S. Wakayama T. Iseki S. Hara E. Masunaga T. Shimizu H. Nishimura E.K. Genotoxic stress abrogates renewal of melanocyte stem cells by triggering their differentiation.Cell. 2009; 137: 1088-1099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar; and unpublished data). In each case, “inappropriately” pigmented bulge melanocytes preceded hair graying. Ectopic differentiation of melanocyte stem cell progeny in the niche preceded the onset of hair graying or occurred concomitantly with hair graying, presumably because of the defective maintenance of stem cell immaturity of melanocyte stem cells. Although the frequency of the gray hairs was variable depending on the individual animal, melanocyte stem cells had been lost in the bulge area of almost all follicles that produced white hair. These phenomena strongly suggest that stem cell-depleted follicles give rise to white or gray hairs in the subsequent hair cycle. In contrast, epidermal and dermal melanocytes in the pigmented junctional epithelium, such as in mouse eyelids, are maintained both in cKO mice and in control littermates (Figure S4). Collectively these data suggest that the hair graying phenotype in the setting of TGF-βRII deficiency can be caused by incomplete maintenance of melanocyte stem cells. The antiapoptotic molecule Bcl2 is critical for melanocyte stem cell entry into the dormant state of the hair follicle at around stage 7 (i.e., postnatal days 6–7 for pelage hair follicles) (Nishimura et al., 2005Nishimura E.K. Granter S.R. Fisher D.E. Mechanisms of hair graying: Incomplete melanocyte stem cell maintenance in the niche.Science. 2005; 307: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure S6 and in our previous report, lineage tracing studies revealed sudden and massive loss of bulge melanocyte stem cells at stages 6–8 (Nishimura et al., 2005Nishimura E.K. Granter S.R. Fisher D.E. Mechanisms of hair graying: Incomplete melanocyte stem cell maintenance in the niche.Science. 2005; 307: 720-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). At this stage, TGF-β1/2 and phosphorylated Smad2 start to be expressed in the stem cell niche as shown in Figure 2. Thus, we hypothesized that TGF-β might be a trigger for melanocyte stem cell apoptosis in the absence of Bcl2, whereas TGF-β induces quiescence in wild-type melanocyte stem cells. To test this possibility, an anti-TGF-β blocking antibody (1D11) (Dasch et al., 1989Dasch J.R. Pace D.R. Waegell W. Inenaga D. Ellingsworth L.

Nephrol. 2003; 14: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) or a matched control antibody (13C4) was injected into Bcl2−/− mice during the process of stem cell entry to the dormant state (stage 5–8 of hair follicle morphogenesis). First, we confirmed efficient blocking of Smad2 phosphorylation with the TGF-β blocking antibody but not with the control antibody by immunostaining for phospho-Smad2 (Figures 6A–6D). Next, we examined the viability of melanocyte stem cells in the bulge area of Bcl2−/− mice and of control Bcl2−/+ littermates. LacZ+ (transgenically tagged) melanoblasts disappeared from the bulge area by P8 in Bcl2−/− mice, either with or without the control antibody (Figure 6F; Figure S5). Our prior studies demonstrated the programmed cell death of bulge melanoblasts at around P7 in Bcl2 null mice. However, the viability of bulge LacZ+ melanoblasts was preserved after administration of the TGF-β blocking antibody in Bcl2−/− mice at P4, P6, and P8 (Figure 6G)."

Using multiple biochemical strategies, we provide evidence that PCL2 is a Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)-associated protein in mouse ESCs. Knockdown of Pcl2 in ESCs resulted in heightened self-renewal characteristics, defects in differentiation, and altered patterns of histone methylation. Integration of global gene expression and promoter occupancy analyses allowed us to identify PCL2 and PRC2 transcriptional targets and draft regulatory networks.

Three transcription factors are known to be critical in the establishment and/or maintenance of ESC pluripotency. OCT4 (Pou5f1) has a highly conserved role in maintaining pluripotent cell populations (Morrison and Brickman, 2006Morrison G.M. Brickman J.M.

These proteins are found in distinct complexes with additional accessory proteins that undergo dynamic changes during development (Furuyama et al., 2003Furuyama T. Tie F. Harte P.J.

In Drosophila, PCL (polycomb-like) is present in a subset of PRC2 complexes (O'Connell et al., 2001O'Connell S. Wang L. Robert S. Jones C.A. Saint R. Jones R.S.

Biol. 2003; 23: 3352-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that PCL is required to generate high levels of 3meH3K27 at some target genes. However, gene repression and 3meH3K27 of many known PRC2 targets is not abolished in the absence of PCL, suggesting that PRC2 can function independently of PCL at many target genes (Nekrasov et al., 2007Nekrasov M. Klymenko T. Fraterman S. Papp B. Oktaba K. Köcher T. Cohen A. Stunnenberg H.G. Wilm M. Müller J. Pcl-PRC2 is needed to generate high levels of H3-K27 trimethylation at Polycomb target genes.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4078-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In contrast to other PRC2 members, the lack of PCL produces a mild homeotic phenotype, specifically affecting target gene expression in central nervous system and mesoderm tissues (Duncan, 1982Duncan I.M.

PCL2 is a mammalian ortholog of PCL, and defects reported in animal models of Pcl2 deficiency are consistent with lack of PCL in Drosophila. In G. gallus (Wang et al., 2004Wang S. Yu X. Zhang T. Zhang X. Zhang Z. Chen Y.

Genes Evol. 2001; 211: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), central nervous system gene expression is disrupted by the lack of Pcl2. Finally, hypomorphic Pcl2 gene trap mice have pleiotropic defects, including posterior transformation of axial skeleton, stunted growth, hydrocephaly, hunchback, and incisor abnormalities (Wang et al., 2007Wang S. He F. Xiong W. Gu S. Liu H. Zhang T. Yu X. Chen Y. Polycomblike-2-deficient mice exhibit normal left-right asymmetry.Dev. Dyn. 2007; 236: 853-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Here, we investigated the role of PCL2 in mouse ESCs. Reduction of PCL2 resulted in heightened self-renewal characteristics and inefficient differentiation to the three germ layers. PCL2 was found to associate with the core PRC2 complex, and using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with massively parallel DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq), we found that PCL2 is highly enriched at many, but not all, locations of PRC2 enrichment. Loss of PCL2 did not abolish global levels of 3meH3K27 but did result in decreased 3meH3K27 at specific targets and altered patterns of 3meH3K27 during early commitment. Integrating PCL2-PRC2 targets with the ESC self-renewal circuitry revealed a key role for PCL2-PRC2 in limiting transcription of ESC self-renewal genes in undifferentiated ESCs, as well as controlling developmental regulators during commitment and early differentiation. In a screen for regulators of ESC fate, we hypothesized that networks critical for the stability of the ESC state would be differentially regulated at the initiation of commitment (Walker et al., 2007Walker E. Ohishi M. Davey R.E. Zhang W. Cassar P.A. Tanaka T.S. Der S.D. Morris Q. Hughes T.R. Zandstra P.W. et al.Prediction and testing of novel transcriptional networks regulating embryonic stem cell self-renewal and commitment.Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 71-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Transcript levels of Mtf2 (metal response element binding transcription factor 2) decreased during differentiation (Figure 1A), and promoter occupancy data indicated that Mtf2 is bound by both OCT4 and NANOG (Loh et al., 2006Loh Y.H. Wu Q. Chew J.L. Vega V.B. Zhang W. Chen X. Bourque G. George J. Leong B. Liu J. et al.The Oct4 and Nanog transcription network regulates pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells.Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1847) Google Scholar). Further inspection revealed that the protein product of Mtf2 is orthologous to Drosophila PCL. Both proteins contain a TUDOR domain and two PHD zinc finger domains (Figure 1B), and MTF2 shares 73% and 88% similarity to the PCL ortholog, PCL2, studied in X. laevis (Kitaguchi et al., 2001Kitaguchi T. Nakata K. Nagai T. Aruga J. Mikoshiba K. Xenopus Polycomblike 2 (XPcl2) controls anterior to posterior patterning of the neural tissue.Dev. Genes Evol. 2001; 211: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and G. gallus (Wang et al., 2004Wang S. Yu X. Zhang T. Zhang X. Zhang Z. Chen Y. Chick Pcl2 regulates the left-right asymmetry by repressing Shh expression in Hensen's node.Development. 2004; 131: 4381-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), respectively. The mouse and human MTF2 protein sequences share 96% identity. Thus, we will refer to the mammalian Mtf2 transcript as Pcl2. Mammals have two other PCL orthologs, PHF1 and PHF19, which have 63% homology with PCL2 among the conserved domains. Interestingly, expression analysis of Pcl2 in mice shows that it is uniquely expressed in undifferentiated ESCs and during early embryonic development (Figure S1A available online). To examine the function of Pcl2 in ESCs, endogenous Pcl2 expression was stably knocked down using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) (Kunath et al., 2003Kunath T. Gish G. Lickert H. Jones N. Pawson T. Rossant J. Transgenic RNA interference in ES cell-derived embryos recapitulates a genetic null phenotype.Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 559-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). We designed three shRNA sequences targeting different regions of the Pcl2 mRNA, as well as a mismatch control sequence to rule out indirect effects. One shRNA sequence resulted in the most significant reduction in Pcl2. Three of these clones, each exhibiting at least 70% knockdown in Pcl2 transcript compared to the mismatch control and wild-type R1 ESCs, were chosen for further analysis (Figure 1C) and used in all subsequent experiments. However, stable clones expressing the additional two shRNA sequences were analyzed in many of the assays and showed similar results (data not shown). We also confirmed that knockdown in Pcl2 mRNA levels resulted in reduced protein levels (Figures S2B and S2C). To test the effect of Pcl2 depletion on ESC self-renewal, we measured transcript levels of Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 and found that they were increased in Pcl2 knockdowns (Figure 1D) over both wild-type and mismatch controls. Next, we performed a high-content fluorescence imaging assay to examine OCT4 protein levels in single cells (Davey and Zandstra, 2006Davey R.E. Zandstra P.W. Spatial organization of embryonic stem cell responsiveness to autocrine gp130 ligands reveals an autoregulatory stem cell niche.Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 2538-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, Walker et al., 2007Walker E. Ohishi M. Davey R.E. Zhang W. Cassar P.A. Tanaka T.S. Der S.D. Morris Q. Hughes T.R. Zandstra P.W. et al.Prediction and testing of novel transcriptional networks regulating embryonic stem cell self-renewal and commitment.Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 71-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The OCT4 distribution is best estimated by a double Gaussian curve, and a threshold delineating OCT4 +ve and −ve cells was calculated as the intersection of these two curves (Davey and Zandstra, 2006Davey R.E. Zandstra P.W. Spatial organization of embryonic stem cell responsiveness to autocrine gp130 ligands reveals an autoregulatory stem cell niche.Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 2538-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Results are reported as the percentage of cells above and below this threshold. At 3 hours after plating, the cells were viable and contained over 90% OCT4-positive cells (Figure 1E). Cells were cultured under multiple differentiative conditions to study the effects of known self-renewal mediators LIF and BMP4. In all cases, Pcl2 knockdowns maintained a larger OCT4 +ve population (Figures 1E and 1F, BMP4; data not shown). However, the intensity of the OCT4 +ve peak in knockdown cells was not increased compared to the control (Figure 1E). Thus, individual cells did not overexpress OCT4. Instead, a greater percentage of the population was OCT4 +ve. This resulted in the appearance of overexpression in bulk analyses (Figures 1D and 4A) and highlights the importance of single-cell analyses in distinguishing distinct cell states within a heterogeneous population. In clonogenic assays (Peerani et al., 2009Peerani R. Bauwens C. Kumacheva E. Zandstra P.W. Patterning mouse and human embryonic stem cells using micro-contact printing.Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 482: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2006Zhang W. Walker E. Tamplin O.J. Rossant J. Stanford W.L. Hughes T.R. Zfp206 regulates ES cell gene expression and differentiation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4780-4790Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), cultures were stained for alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and colonies were stringently scored, with only colonies resembling those in Figure 1G being counted as undifferentiated. Pcl2 knockdown cells formed undifferentiated colonies with much greater efficiency than controls (Figure 1H). Collectively, these results suggest that knockdown of Pcl2 promoted self-renewal and maintained the undifferentiated state of ESCs during the initial time points following the cue to differentiate. To test the effect of Pcl2 on differentiation capacity, we performed directed neuroectoderm differentiation (Ying et al., 2003bYing Q.L. Stavridis M. Griffiths D. Li M. Smith A. Conversion of embryonic stem cells into neuroectodermal precursors in adherent monoculture.Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar) assays and found Pcl2 knockdown cells maintained high levels of OCT4 with no observable expression of Nestin within a 5 day period (data not shown). Next, we used embryoid body (EB) formation to determine how the cells would respond when stimulated to differentiate for a prolonged period. Compared to controls, knockdown EBs remained rounded, and in general, cells did not migrate outwards, nor did they acquire a differentiated morphology. Based on immunostaining, control EBs formed large areas of both smooth muscle actin (SMA, mesoderm) and Nestin (neuroectoderm)-positive cells while knockdown EBs formed very few differentiated cells (Figure 1I). Furthermore, knockdown EBs did not form α-fetoprotein (endoderm)-positive cells and maintained high levels of OCT4 expression throughout the cultures (Figure 1I). We also tested whether expression of lineage-specific genes was disrupted and found that although transcripts of some markers of mesoderm and ectoderm were eventually expressed, their expression was delayed (Figure S1B). We also observed that endoderm markers were expressed to different extents in knockdowns compared to controls (Figure S1B). To test whether knockdown EBs would eventually differentiate after extended culture, EBs were grown in suspension for 25 days (Kaji et al., 2006Kaji K. Caballero I.M. MacLeod R. Nichols J. Wilson V.A. Hendrich B. The NuRD component Mbd3 is required for pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). After 25 days, control cultures consisted of cystic EBs (Figure 1J, top left) that, when plated on gelatin, developed into cells of differentiated morphology that did not exhibit ALP activity (Figure 1J, top right). In contrast, knockdown EBs remained as small, tightly compacted groups of cells (Figure 1J, bottom left) and retained the capacity to form undifferentiated ALP +ve colonies (Figure 1J, bottom right). These data suggest that Pcl2 is critically involved in early commitment and differentiation. Knockdowns appeared unable to progress to terminal differentiation of some cell types and retained a population of self-renewing ESC-like cells. To verify that the phenotype observed was specific to the depletion of Pcl2, we performed rescue experiments by ectopically expressing Pcl2-IRES-βgeo with a doxycycline-inducible transposon expression system (Woltjen et al., 2009Woltjen K. Michael I.P. Mohseni P. Desai R. Mileikovsky M. Hämäläinen R. Cowling R. Wang W. Liu P. Gertsenstein M. et al.piggyBac transposition reprograms fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2009; 458: 766-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). Clones expressing the transgene encoding the predominate ESC isoforms (Figures S2A and S2B) were selected based on β-galactosidase expression (Figure 2A), PCL2 protein levels (Figure 2B), and Pcl2 transcript (Figure 2C) following 72 hr of treatment with doxycycline. In colony-forming assays, overexpression of PCL2 was not sufficient to return the normal ratio of differentiated to undifferentiated colonies in +LIF (Figures 2D and 2E). However, under –LIF conditions, rescue clones regained the ability to differentiate (Figure 2E) and contained a normal percentage of OCT4-negative cells (Figure 2F). Finally, after long-term culture in doxycycline, expression of ESC-specific genes Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, Esrrb, and Tcl1 were decreased (Figure 2G). These data demonstrate that following overexpression of Pcl2 in the knockdown clones, cells recover the ability to downregulate the pluripotency network and differentiate. In Drosophila, PCL associates with PRC2 (O'Connell et al., 2001O'Connell S. Wang L. Robert S. Jones C.A. Saint R. Jones R.S. Polycomblike PHD fingers mediate conserved interaction with enhancer of zeste protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43065-43073Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, Savla et al., 2008Savla U. Benes J. Zhang J. Jones R.S. Recruitment of Drosophila Polycomb-group proteins by Polycomblike, a component of a novel protein complex in larvae.Development. 2008; 135: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar); therefore, we examined whether murine PCL2 associated with the PRC2 complex. Gel filtration analysis indicated that PCL2 is found in two chromatographically distinct peaks: a large molecular mass peak that coeluted with SUZ12, EZH2, and EED and a smaller peak, which may represent the monomeric form of PCL2 or smaller subcomplexes. SUZ12 and EED were also detected in fractions corresponding to the smaller PCL2 peak (Figure 3A). These associations were confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Figure 3B). Previous reports have suggested that PCL2 does not directly interact with EZH2 (O'Connell et al., 2001O'Connell S. Wang L. Robert S. Jones C.A. Saint R. Jones R.S. Polycomblike PHD fingers mediate conserved interaction with enhancer of zeste protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43065-43073Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), which prompted us to further substantiate its association with SUZ12 using a nonbiased epitope-tagged SUZ12 system coupled to mass spectrometry. We purified SUZ12-associated proteins from a mouse ESC line containing a 6xHis-3xFLAG tag (HF) targeted to the C terminus of one allele of the Suz12 gene, which resulted in expression of a full-length tagged SUZ12 protein (Singla et al., 2010Singla V. Hunkapiller J. Santos N. Seol A.D. Norman A.R. Wakenight P. Skarnes W.C. Reiter J.F. Floxin, a resource for genetically engineering mouse ESCs.Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 50-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). SUZ12-associated proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue to identify interacting proteins (Figure 3C). Mass spectrometric analysis indicated that the two prominent bands at approximately 100 and 55 kDa contained proteins SUZ12, EZH1, and EZH2 and RBBP4, RBBP7, AEBP2, EED, and PCL2, respectively (Figure 3D). In addition to a number of previously known interactors of the PRC2 complex including RBBP4, RBBP7, and AEBP2 (Figure 3D) (Kim et al., 2009Kim H. Kang K. Kim J. AEBP2 as a potential targeting protein for Polycomb Repression Complex PRC2.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 2940-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, Kuzmichev et al., 2002Kuzmichev A.

Histone methyltransferase activity associated with a human multiprotein complex containing the Enhancer of Zeste protein.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2893-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar), we identified 15 peptides of PCL2 (Table S1). Taken together, these data demonstrate that PCL2 associates with the PRC2 complex in mouse ESCs. The PRC2 complex is responsible for mediating gene repression by trimethylating H3K27. Loss of the core members of PRC2 results in disruption of the complex and decreased global 3meH3K27. Reduction of PCL2 using shRNA led to moderately increased levels of EZH2 (Figures 4A and 4C) and global 3meH3K27 (Figures 4A and 4D) in the undifferentiated state, while levels of 1meH3K27 were unchanged (Figure 4B). Following LIF withdrawal, EZH2 initially declined, and by day 6, the control cells comprised three distinct cell populations expressing different levels of EZH2 (Figure 4C). In the knockdown cells, EZH2 levels did not decrease during the first 4 days of LIF withdrawal, and a small portion of cells displayed decreased EZH2 at day 6 (Figure 4C). 3meH3K27 levels decreased in both control and knockdown cells immediately following differentiation. Consistent with their undifferentiated state, the knockdown cells had slightly more 3meH3K27 during the first day of differentiation but contained similar levels to the control cells by day 4 of differentiation. At day 6, control cells consisted of two different populations of cells displaying two low but distinct levels of 3meH3K27, whereas knockdown cells comprised a single population (Figure 4D). These data reveal Pcl2 is dispensable for EZH2 expression and global 3meH3K27 in undifferentiated cells. However, upon the withdrawal of LIF, levels of both EZH2 and 3meH3K27 decline below the levels of the control. To dete"
https://openalex.org/W2108036042,"Adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (A-FABP) has emerged as an important mediator of inflammation in macrophages. Macrophage-selective ablation of A-FABP alone is sufficient to prevent the development of high cholesterol diet-induced atherosclerosis in apoE-deficient mice. However, the precise mechanisms whereby A-FABP modulates inflammation remain elusive. Here, we report that A-FABP forms a finely tuned positive loop between JNK and activator protein-1 (AP-1) to exacerbate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses in macrophages. Real time PCR and luciferase reporter analysis showed that LPS induced A-FABP expression through transcriptional activation. This effect was mediated by JNK, which promoted the recruitment of c-Jun to a highly conserved AP-1 consensus binding motif located within the proximal region of the A-FABP promoter. LPS-induced transactivation of the A-FABP gene was diminished by either pharmacological inhibition of JNK or knocking down c-Jun or by mutating the AP-1 recognition site within the proximal region (-122 to -116 bp) of the A-FABP promoter. Conversely, the LPS-evoked phosphorylation of JNK, activation of AP-1, and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines were markedly attenuated by pharmacological or genetic suppression of A-FABP in macrophages. Furthermore, the LPS-induced elevation in A-FABP expression could also be prevented by the selective A-FABP inhibitor BMS309403. These findings support the notion that pharmacological inhibition of A-FABP represents a valid strategy for treating inflammation-related disorders such as atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2160438933,"Vav proteins are guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rho family GTPases. They control processes including T cell activation, phagocytosis, and migration of normal and transformed cells. We report the structure and biophysical and cellular analyses of the five-domain autoinhibitory element of Vav1. The catalytic Dbl homology (DH) domain of Vav1 is controlled by two energetically coupled processes. The DH active site is directly, but weakly, inhibited by a helix from the adjacent Acidic domain. This core interaction is strengthened 10-fold by contacts of the calponin homology (CH) domain with the Acidic, pleckstrin homology, and DH domains. This construction enables efficient, stepwise relief of autoinhibition: initial phosphorylation events disrupt the modulatory CH contacts, facilitating phosphorylation of the inhibitory helix and consequent GEF activation. Our findings illustrate how the opposing requirements of strong suppression of activity and rapid kinetics of activation can be achieved in multidomain systems."

The mechanism by which PUFA specifically suppresses SREBP-1c nuclear abundance, however, remains unclear, although several potential mechanisms have been implicated, including suppression of Srebf1c gene transcription and proteolytic processing as well as enhancement of proteasomal degradation and mRNA decay (11Yahagi N.

As for the suppression of Srebf1c gene transcription by PUFA, we have previously identified liver X receptor-binding element (LXRE) and SREBP-binding element (SRE) on the Srebf1c promoter region by a series of promoter analyses (19Amemiya-Kudo M.

These situations prompted us to clarify the molecular mechanism underlying the suppressive effect of PUFA on nuclear SREBP-1 abundance, especially in the in vivo setting. Because the inhibitory effect of fatty acids on SREBP-1 was specific and clear for PUFA in in vivo experiments, whereas many previous reports using in vitro system have failed to show this specificity (21Worgall T.S.

First, to examine the transcriptional mechanism, in vivo promoter analyses were performed, and the responsible cis-element on the Srebf1c promoter was located at SRE, not at LXRE. Next, the mechanism by which PUFA decreases the nuclear form of SREBP-1 was explored by another reporter system detecting proteolytic activity for the precursor form of SREBP-1, demonstrating that PUFA suppresses the maturation of SREBP-1 through proteolytic processes. From these experiments, we concluded that the primary mechanism for PUFA suppression of SREBP-1 expression is at the proteolytic processing level and that this suppression in turn decreases the Srebf1c mRNA transcription through lowering SREBP-1 binding to SRE on the promoter (“autoloop regulation” (19Amemiya-Kudo M.

Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) ethyl ester (95% grade) was provided from Mochida Pharmaceutical (Tokyo, Japan) and GW532 (SCAP ligand) from GlaxoSmithKline (Les Ulis Cedex, France). The synthetic LXR agonist T0901317 was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Standard laboratory diet (CRF-1, composed of 60% carbohydrate, 13% fat, and 27% protein on a caloric basis) and high carbohydrate fat-free diet (70% sucrose and 20% casein supplemented with methionine, vitamins, and minerals) were obtained from Oriental Yeast (Tokyo, Japan). Other materials were purchased from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. Seven- to 9-week-old ICR male mice were purchased from CLEA (Tokyo, Japan). All animals were maintained in a temperature-controlled environment with a 12-h light/dark cycle and were given free access to standard laboratory diet and water. Four days before the start of indicated fatty acid administration, the basal diet was switched to a high carbohydrate fat-free diet. EPA or oleic acid ethyl ester (OLA) was administered orally once a day for 4 days. GW532 (0–15 mg/kg/day) or vehicle (0.9% carboxymethylcellulose, 9.95% polyethylene glycol 400, and 0.05% Tween 80) was administered orally once a day for 3 days. Mice were sacrificed in the light phase in a nonfasted state. All experiments were repeated at least twice. All animals studied were anesthetized and euthanized according to protocol approved by the Tokyo University Animal Care and Use Committee. Total RNA from mouse liver was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and a 7.5-μg RNA sample equally pooled among each group was run on a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and transferred to a nylon membrane. The cDNA probes for mouse SREBP-1, SREBP-2, and 36B4 were cloned as described previously (11Yahagi N. Shimano H. Hasty A.H. Amemiya-Kudo M. Okazaki H. Tamura Y. Iizuka Y. Shionoiri F. Ohashi K.

The probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were hybridized with the radiolabeled probe in Rapid-Hyb Buffer (Amersham Biosciences) and washed in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Blots were exposed to BAS imaging plate for the BAS2000 BIO imaging analyzer (Fuji Photo Film). The quantification results obtained with the BAS2000 system were normalized to the signal generated from 36B4 mRNA. Nuclear extract protein from mouse or rat liver was prepared as described previously (23Sheng Z. Otani H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Briefly, excised livers (0.5 g) were homogenized in a Polytron in 5 ml of buffer A, which consisted of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, 0.15 mm spermine, and 2 mm spermidine, supplemented with protease inhibitors (6 μg/ml N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN, Calbiochem), 2.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin). Pooled homogenate was then subjected to one stroke of a Teflon pestle in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer, followed by filtration through two layers of cheesecloth, and layered over 10 ml of buffer A. After centrifugation at 24,000 rpm on a Beckman SW28 rotor for 1 h at 4 °C, the resulting nuclear pellet was resuspended in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol supplemented with protease inhibitors, after which 0.1 volume of 5 m NaCl was added. Each mixture was agitated gently for 30 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 89,000 rpm on a Himac S120AT2 rotor (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used as nuclear extract. Aliquots of nuclear extract (10 μg) and total lysate (50 μg) proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Immunoblot analysis was performed using the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to XAR-5 film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The primary antibodies for SREBPs (rabbit polyclonal; number 931 for mouse SREBP-1 and number 528 for SREBP-2) were used as described previously (24Sekiya M. Yahagi N. Matsuzaka T. Najima Y.

An aliquot (0.1 g) of liver samples snap-frozen by liquid nitrogen was homogenized in 1 ml of normal saline. The fatty acid composition was measured by gas chromatography at Bio-Medical Laboratories (Tokyo, Japan) (25Sattler W. Puhl H. Hayn M. Kostner G.M. Esterbauer H. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) Briefly, total lipids in liver homogenates were extracted according to the Folch's procedure (26Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by transesterification of fatty acids with boron trifluoride/methanol at 100 °C for 90 min. The methylated fatty acids were then extracted with hexane and analyzed using a GC-17A gas chromatograph (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan) and BPX70 capillary column (0.25 mm inner diameter × 30 m, SGE International Ltd., Melbourne, Australia). HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For luciferase assay, HEK293 cells were seeded in a 48-well plate and incubated until 80% confluent. The indicated amounts of expression plasmids, firefly luciferase reporter plasmid, and pSV40-Renilla luciferase plasmid were co-transfected into HEK293 cells using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total amounts of transfected DNA were adjusted with empty vector. The luciferase activity in transfectants was measured on a luminometer. Renilla luciferase activities were used to normalize transfection efficiencies. In vivo imaging was performed as described previously (27Contag P.R. Olomu I.N. Stevenson D.K. Contag C.H. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane/oxygen, and 3.0 mg of luciferin dissolved in 0.4 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (7.5 mg/ml) was injected into the intraperitoneal cavity. Mice were imaged from the ventral side using an In Vivo Imaging System (IVISTM, Xenogen) 15 min following the injection of luciferin. Relative photon emission over the liver region was quantified using LivingImageTM software (Xenogen). To construct expression plasmids for GAL4-DNA binding domain (GAL4-DBD) and VP16-transactivation domain (VP16-AD) fused to human SREBPs, VP16-AD from pACT vector (Promega) was inserted into pM vector (Clontech) with various lengths of DNA fragment of human SREBP-1c (amino acids 1–1123 (“FL” for full length), 1–436 (“Nuc” for N-terminal nuclear part), or 431–1123 (“Reg” for C-terminal regulatory domain) or human SREBP-2 (amino acids 14–1141 (FL) or 450–1141 (Reg)) retrieved by PCR from pTK-HSV-hSREBP-1c, pTK-HSV-hSREBP-2, and pcDNA3.1(+)-SREBP-1c (28Hua X.

In our first series of experiments, we verified the effects of PUFA on SREBP-1 and -2 expression in the liver. As expected, administration of EPA, one of the major n-3 PUFA in mammals, down-regulated SREBP-1 mRNA and protein expression (Fig. 1, A, B, D, and E), leading to a decrease in plasma triglycerides concentration (Fig. 1, C and F) as compared with control or oleate. The delivery of orally administered EPA to the liver was confirmed by gas chromatography analysis (Table 1). EPA administration did not affect the body weights of mice (data not shown). The dose-response relationship data suggested that the nuclear form is more sensitive to PUFA than the membrane form of protein or mRNA. In contrast, SREBP-2 mRNA and protein levels were not altered by PUFA.TABLE 1Fatty acid composition in the liverEPA (g/kg/day)02.55.07.5mg/g liver weightC12:00.00 ± 0.000.00 ± 0.000.00 ± 0.000.00 ± 0.00C14:00.22 ± 0.050.09 ± 0.030.05 ± 0.01ap < 0.05.0.07 ± 0.02ap < 0.05.C14:1n-50.00 ± 0.000.00 ± 0.000.00 ± 0.000.00 ± 0.00C16:010.11 ± 1.078.06 ± 0.606.48 ± 0.40ap < 0.05.7.97 ± 0.58C16:1n-72.06 ± 0.261.10 ± 0.18ap < 0.05.0.70 ± 0.04bp < 0.01.0.75 ± 0.13bp < 0.01.C18:03.12 ± 0.093.72 ± 0.173.13 ± 0.184.15 ± 0.18bp < 0.01.C18:1n-914.77 ± 2.967.76 ± 1.82ap < 0.05.3.70 ± 0.54ap < 0.05.4.88 ± 1.43ap < 0.05.C18:2n-61.76 ± 0.321.74 ± 0.231.92 ± 0.271.65 ± 0.30C18:3n-60.00 ± 0.000.00 ± 0.000.03 ± 0.000.03 ± 0.00C18:3n-30.00 ± 0.000.00 ± 0.000.03 ± 0.000.00 ± 0.00C20:00.04 ± 0.010.07 ±0.020.08 ± 0.020.08 ± 0.02C20:1n-90.64 ± 0.170.22 ± 0.090.10 ± 0.02ap < 0.05.0.12 ± 0.04ap < 0.05.C20:2n-60.07 ± 0.010.05 ± 0.000.05 ± 0.010.04 ± 0.00ap < 0.05.C20:3n-90.93 ± 0.060.18 ± 0.10bp < 0.01.0.07 ± 0.01bp < 0.01.0.08 ± 0.02bp < 0.01.C20:3n-60.44 ± 0.090.19 ± 0.02ap < 0.05.0.17 ± 0.03ap < 0.05.0.15 ± 0.01ap < 0.05.C20:4n-62.37 ± 0.331.79 ± 0.051.64 ± 0.151.54 ± 0.08ap < 0.05.C20:5n-30.12 ± 0.023.15 ± 0.31bp < 0.01.3.06 ± 0.17bp < 0.01.4.42 ± 0.35bp < 0.01.C22:00.09 ± 0.020.14 ± 0.030.16 ± 0.030.17 ± 0.04C22:1n-90.04 ± 0.010.00 ± 0.000.03 ± 0.010.03 ± 0.01C22:4n-60.11 ± 0.020.07 ± 0.010.06 ± 0.01ap < 0.05.0.06 ± 0.01ap < 0.05.C22:5n-30.05 ± 0.011.21 ± 0.33ap < 0.05.1.50 ± 0.23bp < 0.01.2.01 ± 0.44bp < 0.01.C22:6n-32.88 ± 0.233.60 ± 0.323.33 ± 0.343.65 ± 0.09ap < 0.05.C24:00.07 ± 0.010.10 ± 0.020.12 ± 0.01ap < 0.05.0.13 ± 0.02ap < 0.05.C24:1n-90.18 ± 0.010.18 ± 0.010.12 ± 0.02ap < 0.05.0.15 ± 0.01a p < 0.05.b p < 0.01. Open table in a new tab Next, we attempted to estimate the Srebf1c promoter activity in the liver with an in vivo luciferase reporter analysis. The luciferase reporter gene driven by the 2200-bp Srebf1c promoter was adenovirally transduced into mouse liver, and the transcriptional activity was assessed by measuring luciferase activity with the IVIS imaging system. The physiological activity of this promoter had previously been confirmed by transgenic mice (31Takeuchi Y. Yahagi N. Nakagawa Y. Matsuzaka T. Shimizu R. Sekiya M. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Gotoda T. Yamamoto M. Nagai R. Kadowaki T. Yamada N. Osuga J. Shimano H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 363: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, EPA decreased the Srebf1c promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. To determine the responsible region for PUFA suppression, a promoter deletion study was performed; six adenovirus constructs containing different lengths of the Srebf1c promoter (ranging from 2200 to 58 bp) were transduced into mouse livers, and the suppressive effect of EPA on promoter activity was assessed with IVIS (Fig. 3A). From this experiment, the responsible element was located at the SRE site within −90 to −60 bp upstream of the transcription start site. This result was confirmed by another experiment using a mutant SRE construct. Furthermore, it was clarified from the series of deletion studies that EPA did not suppress the promoter activity of a construct containing only LXRE (Fig. 3A), demonstrating that EPA does not antagonize LXR binding to LXRE on the Srebf1c promoter at least in the in vivo setting. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 3, C, E, F, and I, it was demonstrated that the simultaneous knockdown of both LXRα and -β did not affect the suppressive effect of PUFA on Srebf1c promoter activity. Furthermore, the stimulation of LXR by an LXR agonist T0901317 was also shown to be independent of the inhibitory effect of PUFA, as shown in Fig. 3, D, G, H, and J. Based on these findings, we concluded that LXR is not the direct target of PUFA regulation in the in vivo setting, although LXR is a determinant of the expression level of SREBP-1 mRNA. To determine whether the trans-acting factor for SRE is SREBP-1 or -2 or both, SREBP-1/2 was knocked down by RNA interference. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, the effects of PUFA administration and knocking down SREBP-1 were essentially equal, and when SREBP-1 was knocked down, the promoter activity of Srebf1c gene was reduced by half, and PUFA showed no additive effects. In contrast, knocking down SREBP-2 did not affect the promoter activity of Srebf1c as assessed by luciferase reporter expression (Fig. 4, E and F), demonstrating that SREBP-2 is not involved in the transcriptional regulation of Srebf1c gene expression. From these findings, it was concluded that the trans-acting factor for SRE on the Srebf1c promoter is SREBP-1 and not SREBP-2. This indicates that SREBP-1 constitutes an autoloop regulatory circuit. SREBP-1 is synthesized as a precursor bound to the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope and is released from the membrane into the nucleus as a mature protein by a cleavage process (7Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar). To explore the molecular mechanism by which PUFA decreases the nuclear form of SREBP-1, another reporter system to detect proteolytic activity for the precursor form of SREBPs was constructed (Fig. 5A). In this system, Gal4-DNA binding domain and VP16 activation domain were attached to the N terminus of SREBPs, and the nuclear entry of this N-terminal fragment was measured by the Gal4-UAS system to assess the proteolytic release of the SREBP N termini. Using this cleavage-detecting reporter system, the proteolytic activities for precursor forms of SREBP-1 or -2 were tested in vitro with SCAP and insulin-induced gene (INSIG)-1 overexpressions as an activator and an inhibitor for cleavage of SREBP, respectively. As expected, the SCAP overexpression drastically enhanced the cleavage of N-terminal fragments of both SREBP-1 and -2, and the co-expression of INSIG1 reversed the effect of SCAP overexpression (Fig. 5B), indicating that this reporter system reflects the physiological regulation of SREBP activation processes by proteolysis. Next, we transduced the reporter genes into mouse livers using adenoviruses and examined the effect of PUFA in the in vivo setting. As shown in Fig. 5, C and D, EPA suppressed only the SREBP-1 cleavage-detecting reporter but did not affect the SREBP-2 reporter. Additionally, EPA did not decrease the reporter activity from the construct that contains only the N terminus (designated as Nuc-SREBP-1c) and enters the nucleus without cleavage, demonstrating that EPA did not accelerate the degradation of reporter fragment. In contrast, GW532, a SCAP activator, enhanced the cleavage of both SREBP-1 and -2 in the in vitro (Fig. 5F) and in vivo (Fig. 5H) situations. This study has clearly demonstrated that the primary mechanism of the inhibitory effect of PUFA is the suppression of the proteolytic activation of SREBP-1 and that the transcriptional regulation is secondary to this post-translational suppression of mature SREBP-1 that itself binds to the SRE site on the Srebf1c promoter (autoloop regulation (19Amemiya-Kudo M. Shimano H. Yoshikawa T. Yahagi N. Hasty A.H. Okazaki H. Tamura Y. Shionoiri F. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Osuga J. Harada K. Gotoda T. Sato R. Kimura S. Ishibashi S. Yamada N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31078-31085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar)), whereas LXR is not involved in the transcriptional regulation by PUFA (Fig. 6). This is the first report that has clearly demonstrated the inhibitory effect of PUFA on the SREBP-1 proteolytic processing in vivo. This result is consistent with our previous report showing that PUFA decreases nuclear SREBP-1, although it does not affect the nuclear abundance of the truncated form of SREBP-1 expressed from a transgene, suggesting that PUFA does not accelerate the degradation of nuclear SREBP-1 protein (11Yahagi N. Shimano H. Hasty A.H. Amemiya-Kudo M. Okazaki H. Tamura Y. Iizuka Y. Shionoiri F. Ohashi K. Osuga J. Harada K. Gotoda T. Nagai R. Ishibashi S. Yamada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35840-35844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). We have shown that two mechanisms are involved in the PUFA regulation on SREBP-1; one is at the proteolytic processing level, and the other is at the transcription level. What is the physiological role of this two-step regulation? As we have shown in Fig. 1, the proteolytic mechanism is high sensitive, although the transcriptional mechanism is low sensitive, consistent with the previous report by Ezaki and co-workers (35Nakatani T. Kim H.J. Kaburagi Y. Yasuda K. Ezaki O. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 369-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The combination of these two steps of regulation with different sensitivity connected in series probably helps to achieve the broader responsive range of the amount of PUFA. One of our conclusions is that LXR is not involved in the transcriptional regulation by PUFA, but controversy exists over this point; several previous reports suggested the involvement of LXR in this regulation (15Ou J. Tu H. Shan B. Luk A. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Bashmakov Y. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 6027-6032Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 16Yoshikawa T. Shimano H.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These previous studies have been all performed in in vitro settings, and therefore we evaluated the contribution of the LXR pathway in the in vivo setting for the first time, and we have concluded that the involvement of LXR is not detectable, although LXR is an important determinant of the SREBP-1 expression level. Because an in vitro model is always only a small part of the whole in vivo system, how large or small the contribution of a regulatory pathway elucidated in vitro is in the whole in vivo system cannot be estimated until it is assessed in the in vivo setting. To address these issues, our approach of the extension of in vitro reporter assays to in vivo settings will be very useful in various situations. We have demonstrated that PUFA selectively suppresses the proteolytic processing of SREBP-1, but the molecular mechanism underlying this SREBP-1-specific regulation is currently unknown. SCAP escorts both SREBP-1 and -2 to the Golgi, and SREBP-1-specific adaptor protein has not been reported yet. Recently, an endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein TRC8 (translocation in renal cancer from chromosome 8) has been documented to hamper endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi transport of SREBP-2/SCAP and reduce SREBP-2 cleavage specifically (37Irisawa M. Inoue J. Ozawa N. Mori K. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 28995-29004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Perhaps there might be some adaptor molecule that specifically interacts with SREBP-1 and mediates the suppressive effect of PUFA, although we have no evidence. If the molecular mechanism underlying this SREBP-1-specific effect of PUFA is clarified in the future, it will be a potential molecular target for new lipid-lowering drugs. In conclusion, the primary mechanism for PUFA suppression of SREBP-1 expression is at the proteolytic processing level and that this suppression in turn decreases the transcription of Srebf1c through lowering SREBP-1 binding to SRE on the promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1970030716,"The myosin cross-reactive antigen (MCRA) protein family is highly conserved among different bacterial species ranging from Gram-positive to Gram-negative bacteria. Besides their ubiquitous occurrence, knowledge about the biochemical and physiological function of MCRA proteins is scarce. Here, we show that MCRA protein from Streptococcus pyogenes M49 is a FAD enzyme, which acts as hydratase on (9Z)- and (12Z)-double bonds of C-16, C-18 non-esterified fatty acids. Products are 10-hydroxy and 10,13-dihydroxy fatty acids. Kinetic analysis suggests that FAD rather stabilizes the active conformation of the enzyme and is not directly involved in catalysis. Analysis of S. pyogenes M49 grown in the presence of either oleic or linoleic acid showed that 10-hydroxy and 10,13-dihydroxy derivatives were the only products. No further metabolism of these hydroxy fatty acids was detected. Deletion of the hydratase gene caused a 2-fold decrease in minimum inhibitory concentration against oleic acid but increased survival of the mutant strain in whole blood. Adherence and internalization properties to human keratinocytes were reduced in comparison with the wild type. Based on these results, we conclude that the previously identified MCRA protein can be classified as a FAD-containing double bond hydratase, within the carbon-oxygen lyase family, that plays a role in virulence of at least S. pyogenes M49."
https://openalex.org/W2160421126,"The β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) represents a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is ubiquitously expressed. In the brain, it is a key player in the molecular pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. Its physiological function is however less well understood. Previous studies showed that APP is up-regulated in prostate, colon, pancreatic tumor, and oral squamous cell carcinoma. In this study, we show that APP has an essential role in growth control of pancreatic and colon cancer. Abundant APP staining was found in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma and colon cancer tissue. Interestingly, treating pancreatic and colon cancer cells with valproic acid (VPA, 2-propylpentanoic acid), a known histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, leads to up-regulation of GRP78, an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone immunoglobulin-binding protein. GRP78 is involved in APP maturation and inhibition of tumor cell growth by down-regulation of APP and secreted soluble APPα. Trichostatin A, a pan-HDAC inhibitor, also lowered APP and increased GRP78 levels. In contrast, treating cells with valpromide, a VPA derivative lacking HDAC inhibitory properties, had no effect on APP levels.

Neurodegener. 2006; 1: 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The heterogeneity is due to alternative splicing, leading to eight distinct isoforms (namely APP677, APP695, APP696, APP714, APP733, APP751, APP752, and APP770), as well as by a variety of post-translational modifications, including O- and N-glycosylation, sulfation, and phosphorylation. APP isoforms exist as immature (N-glycosylated) and mature (N- and O-glycosylated, tyrosyl-sulfated) species. Immature APP localizes in the endoplasmic reticulum and cis-Golgi, and the mature APP form preferentially localizes in the trans-Golgi network, secretory and endocytic vesicles, and at the plasma membrane (3.Selkoe D.J.

Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar). The key event in the pathogenic cascade in Alzheimer disease is the amyloidogenic pathway characterized by subsequent cleavage of APP by the enzyme β-secretase and further processing by γ-secretase, which finally leads to the generation of Aβ peptides. However, the predominant route of APP processing consists of successive cleavages by α- and γ-secretases in non-neuronal cells (6.Sisodia S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 6075-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 7.Postina R. Curr. Alzheimer Res. 2008; 5: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The cleavage of APP at Lys16–Leu17 bond by α-secretase within the Aβ sequence liberates the sAPPα and the nonamyloidogenic C-terminal APP fragment (8.Bayer T.A. Wirths O. Majtényi K. Hartmann T.

APP is one of three members of a small gene family, which includes amyloid β precursor-like protein 1 (APLP1) and amyloid β precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2). All encode type I transmembrane proteins and share similar domain structures, with a large extracellular N-terminal domain and a short cytoplasmic region that undergo similar processing. In contrast to APLP1, which preferentially is expressed in neuronal tissues, APLP2 is expressed also in peripheral non-neuronal tissue (11.Thinakaran G. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29615-29619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). The biological activity of APP is still not well understood, especially in non-neural and cancer cells. Several studies showed that APP and its secreted forms promote adhesion, migration, neurite outgrowth, and general growth-promoting properties (reviewed in Refs. 2.Zheng H. Koo E.H. Mol. Neurodegener. 2006; 1: 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 11.Thinakaran G. Koo E.H. J. Biol.

In a previous study, we demonstrated that SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells transfected with APP695 showed an increase in cell proliferation compared with mock-transfected controls (12.Wirths O. Thelen K.M. Lütjohann D. Falkai P. Bayer T.A. Brain Res. 2007; 1152: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Recent evidence supports the observation of an inverse link between cancer and Alzheimer disease (13.Roe C.M. Fitzpatrick A.L. Xiong C. Sieh W. Kuller L. Miller J.P. Williams M.M. Kopan R. Behrens M.I. Morris J.C. Neurology. 2009; 74: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The authors demonstrated that Alzheimer disease was longitudinally associated with a reduced risk of cancer, and a history of cancer was associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer disease suggesting a common mechanism linking both diseases. In this study, we could demonstrate that APP is selectively overexpressed in pancreatic and colon carcinoma, but not in healthy tissues. Because APP seems to have an important function as a growth factor, it has received considerable attention in the oncology field. Studies showed that patients with increased APP levels have a significantly lower survival rate and has therefore been suggested as a potential biomarker to evaluate cancer prognosis (14.Meng J.Y.

We further focused on the molecular mechanism responsible for the highly specific impairment in the maturation of APP and the reduction of secreted sAPPα caused by VPA in the cancer cell lines. The binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) (also called glucose-regulated protein 78, GRP78) is a molecular chaperone that uses ATP/ADP cycling to regulate protein folding. GRP78 is a 78-kDa heat shock protein induced by VPA (25.Shi Y. Gerritsma D. Bowes A.J. Capretta A. Werstuck G.H. Bioorg. Med. Chem.

The aim of this report was to study the potential impact of APP on prominent gastrointestinal tumor growth and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism. The following antibodies were used: monoclonal APP/Aβ antibody W0-2 (1:5000, The Genetics Co.), APP (1:250 of monoclonal antibody 22C11, Chemicon; 1:500 of polyclonal antibody 23850, generous gift from Gerd Multhaup), polyclonal APP antibody 5313 (27.Tamboli I.Y.

VPA (Sigma) was prepared in sterile water as concentrated stock solution and added to the final concentrations as indicated. Trichostatin A stock solution (5 mm in DMSO) was purchased from Sigma. Valpromide (VPM), a kind gift from Katwijk Chemie B.V., was dissolved in DMSO and added to final concentrations as indicated. Histological classification (tumor type, grade of malignancy) was carried out according to the current World Health Organization and International Union Against Cancer criteria. All slides were re-evaluated again, and diagnosis was approved by an experienced pathologist. All tumor specimens (n = 3 of each tumor type) were obtained from the Department of Pathology, University Medicine, Goettingen, Germany. Stably expressing cell lines were obtained by transfecting the mammalian expression vector pCEP4 (Invitrogen) alone (mock) or with the APP695wt or SPA4CT constructs into SH-SY5Y cells using Lipofectin 2000 (Invitrogen). 300 μg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen) was added to maintain stable integration of the constructs in the transfected cells. APP695-transfected and mock-transfected SH-SY5Y control cells have been in culture for an identical period of time with a similar number of passages. All transfected cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Pan Biotech GmbH), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1% nonessential amino acids. Three pancreatic cancer cell lines (BxPC3, PANC-I, and CFAPC-1) and four colon cancer cell lines (SW480, LoVo, CaCo-2, and T84) were used in this study (kindly provided by Prof. Ghadimi, University of Göttingen) and were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Pan Biotech GmbH) containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. All cell cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Data are presented only with the BxPC3 and SW480 cell lines. Paraffin-embedded colon and pancreas tissue sections (4 μm) were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in a series of ethanol concentrations. Primary antibodies 22C11 and 23850 were incubated overnight in a humid chamber at room temperature. Sections were subsequently incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated polymer, which carries antibodies to rabbit and mouse immunoglobins (EnVision/HRPTM, Dako, Hamburg, Germany), and signals were visualized with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Dako). Counterstaining was carried out with Meyer's hematoxylin, mounted in Super Mount medium, and equipped with an Olympus DP-50 camera using the software Viewfinder Lite version 1.0.134 (Pixera Co.). All tissue sections were analyzed with the monoclonal antibody 22C11 and polyclonal antibody 23850. For negative controls, blocking solution was used in place of the primary antibody. Cell growth was measured by a colorimetric cell proliferation assay (CellTiter 96 AQ assay, Promega) using the reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (Owens's reagent) to formazan according to the protocol of the supplier as reported previously (12.Wirths O. Thelen K.M. Lütjohann D. Falkai P. Bayer T.A. Brain Res. 2007; 1152: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In brief, BxPC3 and SW480 cancer cell lines were seeded at 5 × 103 cells/well in 96-well culture plates and incubated for 24 h with RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were than treated with medium containing VPA, TSA, and VPH for 24 h. After 24 h, 20 μl of dye solution was added to each well, and the plate was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The absorbance was measured at 490 nm using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay microplate reader. Each assay was performed at least six times. For treatment experiments, 1 × 106 BxPC3 and SW480 cells were seeded per 25-cm2 flask. Cells were treated for 24 h with serum-free media followed by 24 h of treatment with the compounds. Protein concentration was measured using a commercially available kit (Roti-Quant, Roth). Cells were harvested using lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) supplemented with 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (5000 × g, 10 min), and equal amounts of soluble proteins (usually 10–15 μg) were separated by electrophoresis on 4–12% Vario-Gels (Anamed) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare). After washing in Tris-buffered saline, including Tween 20 (TBS-T), the blots were incubated with the primary antibody, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary mouse/rabbit antibodies (1:4000/1:3000, Dako). For detection of sAPPα, conditioned culture media were collected and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. Subsequently, supernatant (2 ml) was concentrated by centrifugal filter devices (Amicon Ultra-4 50K, Millipore) at 4000 × g for 5 min. Protein levels in the supernatant were normalized to the protein concentration in the corresponding cell lysate. For quantification of relative protein levels, x-ray films (Hyperfilm EC, Amersham Biosciences) were scanned, and densitometric analysis was carried out using ImageJ software (version 1.41o, National Institutes of Health). Each immunoblot was done three to six times. BxPC3 and SW480 cells were grown in 6-well plates to ∼30–50% confluence in antibiotic-free medium and transfected with siRNA duplexes (Ambion, Silencer® Select validated siRNA, s1500) targeted to APP as follows: sense sequence, CAAGGAUCAGUUACGGAAATT; antisense sequence, UUCCGUAACUGAUCCUUGGT. Transfection of the cells was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 and Opti-MEM I medium (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol at a final concentration of 50 nm. Random siRNA (Ambion, Silencer® negative control siRNA) served as negative control targeted to a scrambled sequence. According to the manufacturer, the specificity of the Silencer® select siRNAs was validated by TaqMan gene expression assays. Specific knockdown of APP by Silencer® select siRNA has been shown previously (28.Belyaev N.D. Nalivaeva N.N. Makova N.Z. Turner A.J. EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). After 48 h, cell lysates and media were collected and analyzed using the protocol for cell lysis described above. Statistical differences were evaluated using one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc test or unpaired t test as indicated. All data are given as means ± S.E. All statistics were calculated using GraphPad Prism version 5.00 software. Using immunohistochemistry, the expression of APP in neoplastic tissue was studied in colon carcinoma and pancreas carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry revealed that colon carcinoma cells showed a strong expression of APP, whereas no expression was seen in normal epithelial cells of the colon (Fig. 1, A–D). In pancreas carcinoma, an intense expression of APP could be found in tumor cells (Fig. 1, G and H). Interestingly, islet cells of the endocrine pancreas presented a strong expression of APP (Fig. 1, E and F), whereas acinar cells showed a slight staining for APP. In contrast, APP was not detected in the normal epithelial cells of the salivary duct system as well as the exocrine pancreas, respectively (Fig. 1, E and F). To detect APP, we used the monoclonal antibody 22C11, which recognizes residues 66–81 (29.Hilbich C. Mönning U. Grund C. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26571-26577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the polyclonal antibody 23850 which detects residues 18–491 of human APP (30.Borchardt T. Camakaris J. Cappai R.

Acta Neuropathol. 2008; 116: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To further validate the functional relevance of APP in pancreatic and colon cancer, a loss-of-function study using siRNA was performed. Detection of APP in SW480 cells by Western immunoblotting revealed two bands at 110 and 130 kDa. To test whether these two variants represent immature and mature APP, respectively, we performed pulse-chase experiments. After pulse labeling, a major band of 110 kDa was detected in cell lysates. During the chase period an additional band was detected at 130 kDa, indicating that immature APP was converted to its mature form by O-glycosylation. Immunoprecipitation of APP from conditioned media revealed secretion of soluble APP after 20 min that accumulated during the chase. These data indicate that the two bands observed by Western immunoblotting represent immature and mature variants of a single splice variant (supplemental Fig. S1). The expression of APP was efficiently suppressed by treatment of SW480 cells with APP siRNA but not with random siRNAs (Fig. 2). Cellular and secreted APP were reduced by 56 ± 3.9 and 67 ± 5.7%, respectively. In BxPC3 cells, treatment with APP siRNA also resulted in significantly reduced levels of cellular (62 ± 2.7%) and secreted sAPPα (69 ± 7.7%). Importantly, siRNA-mediated down-regulation of APP significantly reduced cell growth in both cell types. siRNA treatment did not affect cellular morphology either in pancreatic or in colon cancer cells (data not shown). APP siRNA treatment had no effect on APLP2 levels (supplemental Fig. S2). A range of studies have shown that VPA and other HDAC inhibitors alter cellular proliferation and induce programmed cell death in pancreatic and colon cancer in vitro and in vivo (23.Blaheta R.A. Cinatl Jr., J. Med. Res. Rev. 2002; 22: 492-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 32.Erhuma M. Köbel M. Mustafa T. Wulfänger J. Dralle H. Hoang-Vu C. Langner J. Seliger B. Kehlen A. Int. J. Cancer. 2007; 120: 2393-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we performed cell proliferation assays on BxPC3 (pancreatic cancer) and SW480 (colon cancer) treated with VPA (Fig. 3), as well as using additional pancreatic (PANC-I and CFAPC-1) and colon (LoVo, CaCo-2, and T84) cancer cell lines (data not shown). All cells were treated with different concentrations of VPA ranging from 0 to 100 mm and showed similar growth inhibition. After 24 h of incubation, we performed a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium assay to evaluate drug effect on cellular growth. Results are presented as percentage inhibition compared with untreated control (Fig. 3, A and D). VPA treatment resulted in dose-dependent inhibition in proliferation with both cell lines. To further evaluate the effect of VPA on APP expression, BxPC3 and SW480 were exposed to 0, 1, 2.5, 5, or 10 mm VPA for 24 h. To analyze total APP and the processing product sAPPα, we used the APP/Aβ-specific antibody W0-2 recognizing a region between amino acid 5 and 8 of human Aβ (33.Ida N. Hartmann T. Pantel J.

This antibody detects full-length APP and C99 in cell lysates and sAPPα in culture media. All blots were re-probed with a β-actin antibody to ensure equal protein load. Significant down-regulation was seen in BxPC3 cells at 1 mm and in SW480 at 2.5 mm VPA treatment. APP decreased with higher doses of VPA in BxPC3 as follows: 1 mm, 30 ± 2.3%; 2.5 mm, 40 ± 8.9%; 5 mm, 43 ± 6.2%, and 10 mm 80 ± 5.4% (Fig. 3C). APP expression further decreased with higher doses of VPA in SW480 (means ± S.E. in % reduction of APP levels versus untreated control) as follows: 1 mm, 6 ± 10%; 2 mm, 43 ± 8.1%; 5 mm, 55 ± 1.7%; 10 mm, 82 ± 3.3% (Fig. 3E). Next, we evaluated APP metabolism by measuring sAPPα in the supernatant of conditioned cells. Exposure to VPA markedly reduced sAPPα corresponding to full-length APP levels. Significant down-regulation of sAPPα was seen in BxPC3 cells at 1 mm and in SW480 at 2.5 mm VPA treatment. sAPPα decreased with higher doses of VPA in BxPC3 (means ± S.E. in percent reduction of sAPPα levels versus untreated control) as follows: 1 mm, 33 ± 2.7%; 2.5 mm, 27 ± 3.5%; 5 mm, 45 ± 1.7%; 10 mm, 87 ± 2.3% (Fig. 3E). sAPPα decreased with higher doses of VPA in SW480 (means ± S.E. in % reduction of sAPPα levels versus untreated control) as follows: 1 mm, 0 ± 2.7%; 2.5 mm, 40 ± 7.1%; 5 mm, 67 ± 2.1%; 10 mm, 72 ± 4.8% (Fig. 3F). To evaluate the effect of VPA on mature and immature APP, levels were quantified and indicated as a ratio of mature to immature APP. The quantification of the ratio immature APP to β-actin showed no significant changes (Fig. 4). These results indicate that VPA impairs maturation of APP and consecutively leads to reduced secreted sAPPα. In SW480 cells, mature APP decreased in a concentration-dependent fashion (means ± S.E. in % reduction of mature APP levels versus untreated control) as follows: 1 mm, 30.7 ± 10.7%; 2.5 mm, 52.1 ± 8.9%, 5 mm 73 ± 5.9%. Similar results were obtained with BxPC3 cell lines (data not shown). Consistent with previous studies, VPA inhibits HDAC isoenzymes in several cell types (19.Phiel C.J. Zhang F. Huang E.Y.

VPA treatment of SW480 resulted in hyperacetylated histone H4 in a dose-dependent manner using an antibody specific to acetylated histone H4 (H4Ac) (Fig. 5B). The same result was obtained using BxPC3 (data not shown). To determine whether the APP reducing effect of VPA is specific, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the highly homologous family member protein, amyloid β (A4) precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2) (34.Wasco W.

There was no effect of even 5 mm VPA treatment on EGFR or APLP2 protein levels. The same was found in BxPC3 cells (data not shown). GRP78 protein levels, an APP-binding protein, were elevated after VPA treatment (Fig. 5B) suggesting that the VPA-induced impairment of APP maturation is due to up-regulation of GRP78. VPM (19.Phiel C.J. Zhang F. Huang E.Y. Guenther M.G. Lazar M.A. Klein P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36734-36741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1475) Google Scholar, 35.Lagace D.C.

VPM had no effects on GRP78, H4Ac, EGFR, or APLP2 protein levels. Consistent with our hypotheses, APP protein levels were not affected. VPM is an even more potent anti-convulsive drug than VPA having no anti-neoplastic potency (Fig. 6) (36.Blaheta R.A. Michaelis M. Driever P.H. Cinatl Jr., J. Med. Res.

Treatment of SW480 cells with TSA, a potent but to VPA structurally unrelated pan-HDAC inhibitor (38.Khan N. Jeffers M. Kumar S. Hackett C. Boldog F. Khramtsov N. Qian X. Mills E. Berghs S.C.

APLP2 and EGFR levels were again unchanged. GRP78 levels were also elevated after TSA treatment (Fig. 7). As expected, VPA treatment triggered GRP78 mRNA levels and had no effect on APP mRNA levels indicating that the HDAC inhibitory effect was mediated via GRP78 transcriptional regulation (supplemental Fig. S3). Taken together, these findings suggest that the reduction of APP levels by inhibition of class I HDAC enzymes (HDAC1–3 and 8) is highly specific and mediated by GRP78 elevation. To further characterize the growth promoting activity of APP, we stably transfected SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells with APP695, SPA4CT (N-terminal domain deleted), or the empty vector pCEP4 construct alone (mock) (Fig. 8A). APP695-transfected cells presented a 43 ± 4.8% higher proliferation rate compared with mock-transfected control cells (Fig. 8B).

https://openalex.org/W1974429316,"In this study, we demonstrate that human cardiomyocytes (AC16) produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokines in response to <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i>. ROS were primarily produced by mitochondria, some of which diffused to cytosol of infected cardiomyocytes. These ROS resulted in an increase in 8-hydroxyguanine lesions and DNA fragmentation that signaled PARP-1 activation evidenced by poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) modification of PARP-1 and other proteins in infected cardiomyocytes. Phenyl-α-<i>tert</i>-butylnitrone blocked the mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) formation, DNA damage, and PARP-1 activation in infected cardiomyocytes. Further inhibition studies demonstrated that ROS and PARP-1 signaled <i>TNF-</i>α and <i>IL-1</i>β expression in infected cardiomyocytes. ROS directly signaled the nuclear translocation of RelA (p65), NF-κB activation, and cytokine gene expression. PARP-1 exhibited no direct interaction with p65 and did not signal its translocation to nuclei in infected cardiomyocytes. Instead, PARP-1 contributed to PAR modification of p65-interacting nuclear proteins and assembly of the NF-κB transcription complex. PJ34 (PARP-1 inhibitor) also prevented mitochondrial poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) and ROS formation. We conclude that <i>T. cruzi</i>-mediated mtROS provide primary stimulus for PARP-1-NF-κB activation and cytokine gene expression in infected cardiomyocytes. PAR modification of mitochondrial membranes then results in a feedback cycle of mtROS formation and DNA damage/PARP-1 activation. ROS, either through direct modulation of cytosolic NF-κB, or via PARP-1-dependent PAR modification of p65-interacting nuclear proteins, contributes to cytokine gene expression. Our results demonstrate a link between ROS and inflammatory responses in cardiomyocytes infected by <i>T. cruzi</i> and provide a clue to the pathomechanism of sustained inflammation in Chagas disease."

Progression of many solid tumors requires angiogenesis (1Folkman J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1992; 3: 65-71PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial function has been linked to angiogenesis, because mitochondria are the primary sites of oxygen consumption, and angiogenesis is an oxygen concentration-sensitive process (2Andreyev A.Y.

We performed a large scale screen of microbial extracts in an attempt to identify small molecules that could inhibit the angiogenic response to pro-angiogenic stimuli, such as hypoxia, in endothelial cells. We identified terpestacin as a small molecule with unique bicyclo sesterterpene structure capable of inhibiting the angiogenic response at concentrations below the toxic threshold (10Jung H.J. Lee H.B. Kim C.J. Rho J.R. Shin J. Kwon H.J. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 2003; 56: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Terpestacin strongly inhibits the functional response to hypoxia of human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro and angiogenesis within the embryonic chick chorioallantoic membrane in vivo. In addition to this anti-angiogenic activity, terpestacin has previously been reported to inhibit syncytium formation during human immunodeficiency virus infection and has been chemically synthesized (11Oka M. Iimura S. Tenmyo O. Sawada Y. Sugawara M. Ohkusa N. Yamamoto H. Kawano K. Hu S.L. Fukagawa Y. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1993; 46: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 12Myers A.G. Siu M.

However, neither the molecular target of this compound nor the cellular mechanism of its anti-angiogenic activity has been identified. In the present study we identified the binding protein of terpestacin and clarified the cellular mechanism underlying its effects on angiogenesis. We find that terpestacin specifically binds to the 13.4-kDa subunit (UQCRB in human; accession number NM_006294; QCR7 in yeast; Sub 6 in bovine or chicken) of Complex III in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (14Suzuki H. Hosokawa Y. Toda H. Nishikimi M. Ozawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 987-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The biological activity of terpestacin correlates significantly with the response to UQCRB knockdown in mammalian cells. The discovery that a small molecule targeting UQCRB in mitochondrial Complex III can prevent the angiogenic response in vivo and in vitro without inducing cell death implies that UQCRB plays a key role in the cellular oxygen sensing and transduction system. This study provides new insight into the oxygen sensing role of UQCRB in mitochondrial Complex III, and a small molecule targeting that system provides a powerful tool for regulating tumor angiogenesis. Twenty-four C3H/HeJ mice were inoculated subcutaneously with spontaneously occurring FM3A breast cancer cells. Twelve mice were treated intraperitoneally with terpestacin (2.5 μm) on days 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8. Another twelve mice were injected with saline as a negative control. On day 10, the tumor-bearing mice were examined with dynamic T1-weighted sequences using gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetate in a 1.5T magnetic resonance (MR) scanner. After examination, the tumors were harvested for immunostaining of tumor blood vessels and expression of hypoxia-responsible genes, HIF-1α, and VEGF. MRI was performed on a clinical 1.5 T whole body MR system (Gyroscan, Philips) using a custom-made radiofrequency coil for excitation and signal reception. All of the animals were examined with high resolution T1- and T2-weighted pulse sequences and dynamic contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI using the following imaging parameters: repetition time/echo time (TR/TE) = 500/10 ms, flip angle = 30°, acquisition = 8, matrix size = 256 × 198, slice thickness = 1.5 mm, and in-plane resolution = 234 × 234 μm. Five-micrometer paraffin sections were incubated with anti-CD34 (Santa Cruz), anti-HIF-1α (Novus), and anti-VEGF (R & D Systems) mouse monoclonal antibodies for 1 h, respectively. After rinsing, the slides were incubated with secondary antibody for 45 min. The LSAB2/HRP staining kit (DakoCytomation) and the En Vision kit (DakoCytomation) were used for secondary antibody reaction. The slides were then washed and incubated with an avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex, followed by 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride color development. Counterstaining was performed using hematoxylin. C3H mice with FM3A breast carcinomas were injected with either terpestacin or vehicle (saline) at 2-day intervals. The implants were harvested on day 7, and the concentration of VEGF protein in tumor tissue extracts was determined by a VEGF-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R & D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. VEGF protein levels were normalized to the total protein concentration of each sample. Biotinylated terpestacin with 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl] carbodiimide hydrochloride (1.5 mg, 0.0078 mmol) and dimethylaminopyridine (1.0 mg, 0.0082 mmol) were added to a stirred solution of terpestacin (3.0 mg, 0.0075 mmol) and N-(+)-biotinyl-6-aminohexanoic acid (2.7 mg, 0.0076 mmol; Pierce) in Me2SO (3 ml) was added at 0 °C. After incubation overnight at room temperature, the crude product was extracted with EtOAc (15 ml) and purified by preparative TLC (CH2Cl2:methanol = 10:1) to yield two biotinylated terpestacin derivatives (hydroxyl group at the C-24 position (BT1) and hydroxyl group at the C-17 position (BT2)). This procedure resulted in 75% yield. The matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry value for C41H63N3O7S was m/z 764.5 [M + Na]+. 1-Ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl] carbodiimide hydrochloride (1.0 mg, 0.0052 mmol) and dimethylaminopyridine (0.64 mg, 0.0052 mmol) were added to a stirred solution of terpestacin (2.0 mg, 0.005 mmol) and Boc-6-aminohexanoic acid (1.2 mg, 0.0052 mmol) in dimethylformamide (2 ml) at 0 °C. After incubation overnight at room temperature, the crude product was extracted with EtOAc (4 ml × 3), treated with 20% trifluoroacetic acid in CH2Cl2 (1 ml), and stirred for 2 h at room temperature. N,N-diisopropylethylamine (1.3 mg, 0.01 mmol) and 6-((7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetyl) amino) hexanoic acid succinimidyl ester (2.2 mg, 0.005 mmol, Molecular Probes) were added at 0 °C. After stirring for 4 h at room temperature, the crude product was extracted with EtOAc (20 ml) and purified by preparative TLC (CH2Cl2:methanol = 10:1) to produce coumarin-conjugated terpestacin at 61% yield. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry for C49H71N3O9 m/z 868.5 [M + Na]+. Biotinylated terpestacin was immobilized onto a streptavidin-coated plate (Pierce), and phage display was performed using T7 phages encoding human cDNA libraries from liver tumor, normal liver, Alzheimer's brain, normal brain, and normal stomach tissues (Novagen) as described previously (15Shim J.S. Lee J. Park H.J. Park S.J. Kwon H.J. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 1455-1463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Specific terpestacin-binding phages were isolated and analyzed by DNA sequencing using the PRISM dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (Applied Biosystems). The sequence homologies of the obtained sequences were compared with sequences in GenBankTM using the BLAST program. For mammalian expression, the full-length human UQCRB expression vector was constructed by subcloning a PCR-amplified full-length cDNA of UQCRB (accession number NM_006294) into the EcoRI/XhoI site of pCDNA3.1-HA (Invitrogen). To obtain the recombinant UQCRB protein from bacteria, the UQCRB cDNA was inserted into the EcoRI/XhoI site of pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences). The glutathione S-transferase-UQCRB fusion protein was purified as described previously (16Park H.J. Cho H.Y. Kong K.H. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 38: 232-237PubMed Google Scholar) and treated with thrombin (Amersham Biosciences) for the removal of glutathione S-transferase. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene) was used to mutate selected codons in the clone of human UQCRB gene. The following primers were used: to change Leu32 to Ala, 5′-GCAGGATTCAATAAACTGGGGGCAATGCGAGATGATACA-3′ and 5′-TGTATCATCTCGCATTGCCCCCAGTTTATTGAATCCTGC-3′; and to change Ile63 to Ala, 5′-AATGACAGGATGTTTCGCGCTAAGAGGGCACTGGAC-3′ and 5′-GTCCAGTGCCCTCTTAGCGCGAAACATCCTGTCATT-3′. The mutated codons are underlined. PCR was performed under the following conditions: initial denaturation for 30 s at 95 °C, 16 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 12 min at 68 °C. After digestion of the parental DNA for 1 h at 37 °C with DpnI, the amplified plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue competent cells. The presence of the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Biotin and biotinylated terpestacin were sequentially immobilized on the surface of a streptavidin-coated sensor chip. Molecular interaction analysis was performed using the BIAcore 2000 (BIAcore AB) as described previously (15Shim J.S. Lee J. Park H.J. Park S.J. Kwon H.J. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 1455-1463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The SPR response curves were analyzed with BIAcore Evaluations software, version 3.1. The apparent association and dissociation constants were calculated from the kinetic constants equations: KA = ka/kd, KD = kd/ka. The structure of terpestacin was optimized employing the nonlocal density functional theory (B3LYP DFT) function and restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF)/6–31G(*) basis set description. All of the atomic charges were assigned using the Mullikan Populations of Gaussian 03 calculation result. To find out the docking structures of terpestacin into UQCRB, automated docking simulation was implemented with the program AutoDock version 3.0. The UQCRB structure was used for x-ray crystal structure from the Protein Data Bank (code 3BCC; chicken cytochrome bc1 complex). An initial protein structure was energy minimized for 1000 steps employing the steepest descent algorithm. In AutoDock, docking was performed by combining a global genetic algorithm with local minimization, Lamarckian genetic algorithm. 100 trials of each docking were preformed, and final docked conformations were clustered using a tolerance of 1 Å root mean square deviation. The docking conformation properly oriented toward the UQCRB pocket was selected, and the free energy of binding was estimated. For fluorescence microscope analysis, HT1080 cells were incubated with 20 μm of coumarin or coumarin-conjugated terpestacin (ter-coumarin) for 24 h in the presence or absence of excess terpestacin. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus). To determine the subcellular localization of terpestacin, HT1080 cells were grown on glass coverslips in 24-well plates and treated with 50 μm of coumarin or ter-coumarin for 30 min. To stain the mitochondria, the cells were treated with MitoTracker (100 nm, catalog number M-7512; Molecular Probes) at 37 °C for 15 min. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde, and the coverslips were mounted with a ProLong antifade kit (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The fluorescence image was obtained using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Axiovert 100M; Carl Zeiss). Total RNA was prepared from HT1080 cells using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The probe preparation and microarray hybridization was performed using the TwinChip Human-8K cDNA microarray (Digital Genomics) as described previously (17Shim J.S. Lee H.K. Park H.M. Kim J.O. Kim E.K. Hwang K.H. Kim K.T. Park S.W. Lee J.H. Kwon H.J. Exp. Mol. Med. 2005; 37: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Microarray data analysis was conducted using the GeneSight data analysis software (v3.5, BioDiscovery). Signature correlation coefficient values (ρ) between two experimental conditions were obtained as described previously (18Marton M.J. DeRisi J.L. Bennett H.A. Iyer V.R. Meyer M.R. Roberts C.J. Stoughton R. Burchard J. Slade D. Dai H. Bassett Jr., D.E. Hartwell L.H. Brown P.O. Friend S.H. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1293-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). The change in ΔΨm was detected by a fluorescence-based assay. The cells were incubated for 4 h with radicicol or terpestacin and then stained for 15 min with 0.25 μg/ml of 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazol-carbocyanine iodide, which is a lipophilic cationic probe (JC-1; Molecular Probes). At hyperpolarized membrane potentials (to −140 mV), this dye forms a red fluorescent J-aggregate, whereas at depolarized membrane potentials (to −100 mV), this dye remains in its green fluorescent monomeric form. Subsequently, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline twice. The images were obtained using an IX70 fluorescence microscope (Olympus) at a ×100 magnification. Mitochondrial respiration was measured using succinate, a substrate for Complex II. When succinate (5 mm) was added to mitochondria, the flavin adenine dinucleotide-linked O2 consumption was stimulated. Mouse liver mitochondria (0.2 mg/ml) were pretreated for 15 min with terpestacin (80 μg/ml), antimycin A (0.1 μg/ml), or methanol control (0.5%). The respiration rate of mitochondria was measured with Clark-type oxygen electrode (Oxygen electrode Units DW1; Hansatech Instruments) at 30 °C. Early passages (4–8 passages) of HUVECs were grown in endothelial cell medium-2 (EGM-2, Cambrex) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). HT1080 (fibrosarcoma) cells were maintained in minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. 143B (osteosarcoma), HepG2 (hepatoma), HeLa (cervical squamous carcinoma), CHANG (normal liver), and Hep3B (hepatoma) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All of the cells were maintained in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. For the hypoxic conditions, the cells were incubated at a CO2 level of 5% with 1% O2 balanced with N2 in a hypoxic chamber (Forma). The cell lysates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and were then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Milipore) using standard electroblotting procedures. The blots were then blocked and immunolabeled overnight at 4 °C with anti-HIF-1α (BD Biosciences), anti-VEGF (Santa Cruz), anti-phospho-p70S6K (Cell Signaling), anti-p70S6K (Cell Signaling), anti-β-actin, and anti-tubulin (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) primary antibodies. Immunolabeling was detected by an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Intracellular ROS levels were measured using 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (Sigma). ROS in the cells cause oxidation of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein, generating a fluorescent product, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein. After incubation with 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (10 μm) for 10 min, the cells were lysed and centrifuged to remove debris. The fluorescence in the protein-normalized supernatant was determined using a FL600 microplate fluorescence reader (Bio-Tek) at the excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 535 nm, respectively. For UQCRB overexpression, HT1080 cells were transfected with either control (neo) or UQCRB expression vectors (1 μg) using the SuperFect® transfection reagent (Qiagen). Human UQCRB-specific siRNA was constructed using the StealthTM RNA interference (Invitrogen). For the knockdown of UQCRB mRNA, HT1080 cells were transfected with either control or UQCRB siRNA (5, 10 nm) using the LipofectamineTM 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Interference of UQCRB mRNA was validated though reverse transcription-PCR analysis using specific primers for UQCRB. The invasiveness of endothelial or tumor cells was examined using a Transwell chamber system with 8.0-μm pore-sized polycarbonate filter inserts (Corning Costar). The total number of invaded cells was counted using an optical microscope at a ×100 magnification. The tube formation assay was conducted using HUVECs grown on Matrigel as described previously (10Jung H.J. Lee H.B. Kim C.J. Rho J.R. Shin J. Kwon H.J. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 2003; 56: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Tube formation was quantified by counting the number of connected cells in randomly selected fields at a ×100 magnification and dividing that number by the total number of cells in the same field. Terpestacin was purified from the culture extract of a fungal strain, Embellisia chlamydospora, as described previously (10Jung H.J. Lee H.B. Kim C.J. Rho J.R. Shin J. Kwon H.J. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 2003; 56: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Antimycin A, myxothiazol, and rotenone were purchased from Sigma, and stigmatellin was purchased from Fluka. The results are expressed as the means ± S.E. The Student's t test was used to determine statistical significance between control and test groups. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying inhibition of angiogenesis by terpestacin, phage display biopanning, an approach that has proven to be a powerful means to identify cellular binding proteins of bioactive small molecules, was applied to identify terpestacin binding proteins (15Shim J.S. Lee J. Park H.J. Park S.J. Kwon H.J. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 1455-1463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 19Piggott A.M. Karuso P. Chembiochem. 2008; 9: 524-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Terpestacin was biotinylated at either the C-24 (BT1) or C-17 (BT2) position hydroxyl group to produce an affinity ligand for the isolation of its binding proteins (Fig. 1A). Both BT1 and BT2 retained their biological activity, as shown by their anti-proliferative activities in HUVECs. BT1 was first immobilized on a streptavidin-coated well plate, and four rounds of phage biopanning were conducted using T7 phages expressing functional human cDNA libraries (6 × 109 phage plaque-forming unit/ml). After the fourth round of biopanning, phage particles that bound specifically to BT1 were isolated and analyzed by DNA sequencing (Fig. 1B). Among a total of 18 phage plaques isolated for DNA sequencing, all phage clones (100%) were identified as human UQCRB-encoding phages (Fig. 1C). An independent experiment was performed using BT2 affinity ligand using the same procedure as for BT1. As the result, more than 90% (18 of a total of 20 phage clones) of BT2-binding phages were expressing UQCRB. The remaining BT2-binding phage clones were found to represent nonspecific binders (Fig. 1D). The highly enriched biopanning result of phage display with two biotinylated terpestacins strongly demonstrate that UQCRB is the highest affinity binding protein of terpestacin. To verify the specific binding of terpestacin to UQCRB, a phage display binding assay was investigated first with diverse classes of biologically active small molecules. The binding of UQCRB-encoding phages to BT1 was completely abolished in the presence of excess free terpestacin but was not influenced by other mitochondrial inhibitors or by other angiogenesis inhibitors (Fig. 2A), implying that terpestacin specifically binds to UQCRB and is the first small molecule targeting UQCRB. Next, the interaction between terpestacin and intact human UQCRB was demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore) analysis. The apparent binding affinities were calculated by subtraction of resonance values of UQCRB binding to control biotin from those of UQCRB binding to BT1. This analysis yielded specific binding curves for UQCRB to BT1 from the BIAcore sensorgrams, and the apparent dissociation constant (KD) of UQCRB binding to terpestacin was calculated as 3.1 × 10−6 m (Fig. 2B). These results clearly demonstrate that UQCRB is a direct binding protein of terpestacin at micromolar levels close to its effective concentration toward the anti-angiogenic activity (5–10 μm). Next, the interaction between terpestacin and UQCRB in the cellular level was assessed on the basis of the subcellular localization of ter-coumarin as a probe. Indeed, ter-coumarin intensively stains the cytoplasmic part of HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, whereas control coumarin does not (Fig. 2C, upper panels). Pretreatment with excess free terpestacin in the cells dose-dependently decreased the fluorescence intensity of ter-coumarin, demonstrating that the probe specifically binds to the terpestacin target proteins in the cells. Furthermore, confocal microscopy analysis using ter-coumarin and a mitochondrial specific marker, MitoTracker, revealed the fluorescence signal of ter-coumarin coincided exactly with that of MitoTracker (Fig. 2C, lower panels), implying again that terpestacin binds to mitochondria in the cells where its target, UQCRB, is located. To further elucidate the binding mode of terpestacin to UQCRB at molecular level, we simulated a binding model of UQCRB with terpestacin using the reference protein (Protein Data Bank code 3BCC; chicken cytochrome bc1 complex) (20Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y.I. Kim K.K. Hung L.W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar) and the AutoDock program. The docking modeling revealed that terpestacin binds to the hydrophobic pocket of UQCRB via its large hydrophobic ring structure, and nonpolar amino acid residues, including Leu32 and Ile63 of UQCRB, appear to be crucial for the hydrophobic interaction (Fig. 3, A and B). In addition, this model showed that terpestacin binds to the interface of the binding site between UQCRB and cytochrome b, suggesting that terpestacin could affect the interaction between cytochrome b and UQCRB. To verify this binding model of terpestacin and UQCRB, we constructed UQCRB mutants including L32A, I63A, and L32A/I63A and examined the binding affinity of these mutants to terpestacin by SPR analysis. The binding efficiency of L32A and I63A to terpestacin was decreased to 65 and 25%, respectively (Fig. 3C). Notably, the combined mutant of L32A and I63A completely abolished the binding with terpestacin. Bovine serum albumin as a negative control did not bind to terpestacin. These results validate the binding model that represents the significance of hydrophobic amino acid residues of UQCRB for the binding to terpestacin. In addition, the functional genomic consequences of terpestacin binding to UQCRB was investigated by using cDNA microarray analysis of transcriptional changes in HT1080 cells treated with terpestacin or siRNA directed against human UQCRB (siUQCRB). The genome-wide gene expression profiling showed a significant correlation between terpestacin and UQCRB genetic knockdown, validating that UQCRB is a biologically relevant target of terpestacin (supplemental Fig. S1). All of these in vitro and in vivo data strongly demonstrate that UQCRB of mitochondrial Complex III is a cellular target protein of terpestacin and suggest a critical role for UQCRB in angiogenesis. Next, we investigated the biological implication of the binding of terpestacin to UQCRB. To elucidate whether this interaction causes mitochondrial dysfunction, the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was measured using the JC-1 fluorescent marker. As shown in Fig. 4A, control HT1080 cells or cells treated with radicicol, a structurally related molecule targeting heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), exhibited a low level of green fluorescence and a high red-orange fluorescence (large negative ΔΨm). However, treatment with terpestacin led to an increase in green fluorescence and a decrease in red-orange fluorescence in a dose-dependent manner (loss of ΔΨm). These data demonstrate that the binding of terpestacin to UQCRB results in a mitochondrial response involving a dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential. To further examine whether the binding of terpestacin to UQCRB affects mitochondrial energy metabolism, the mitochondrial oxygen consumption was measured using mouse liver mitochondria and succinate, a substrate for Complex II. As shown in Fig. 4B, mitochondrial respiration was strongly inhibited by antimycin A, whereas terpestacin did not inhibit oxygen consumption generated by the oxidation of succinate, implying that terpestacin regulates the function of mitochondrial Complex III without disrupting respiration, making it likely that ATP generation is not affected. Mitochondrial Complex III is a major site of cellular ROS generation during hypoxia and is known to be involved in cellular oxygen sensing (5Brunelle J.K. Bell E.L. Quesada N.M. Vercauteren K. Tiranti V. Zeviani M. Scarpulla R.C. Chandel N.S. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 409-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Moreover, the increase in ROS production during hypoxia has been reported to initiate the stabilization of HIF-1α protein and to mediate hypoxia-induced transcription of genes such as VEGF (4Chandel N.S.

https://openalex.org/W2144981213,"The orthogonal array of axon pathways in the Drosophila CNS is constructed in part under the control of three Robo family axon guidance receptors: Robo1, Robo2 and Robo3. Each of these receptors is responsible for a distinct set of guidance decisions. To determine the molecular basis for these functional specializations, we used homologous recombination to create a series of 9 ""robo swap"" alleles: expressing each of the three Robo receptors from each of the three robo loci. We demonstrate that the lateral positioning of longitudinal axon pathways relies primarily on differences in gene regulation, not distinct combinations of Robo proteins as previously thought. In contrast, specific features of the Robo1 and Robo2 proteins contribute to their distinct functions in commissure formation. These specializations allow Robo1 to prevent crossing and Robo2 to promote crossing. These data demonstrate how diversification of expression and structure within a single family of guidance receptors can shape complex patterns of neuronal wiring."
https://openalex.org/W1965809235,"Fibroblast growth factors are key proteins in many intercellular signaling networks. They normally remain attached to the extracellular matrix, which confers on them a considerable stability. The unrestrained accumulation of fibroblast growth factors in the extracellular milieu, either due to uncontrolled synthesis or enzymatic release, contributes to the pathology of many diseases. Consequently, the neutralization of improperly mobilized fibroblast growth factors is of clear therapeutic interest. In pursuing described rules to identify potential inhibitors of these proteins, gentisic acid, a plant pest-controlling compound, an aspirin and vegetarian diet common catabolite, and a component of many traditional liquors and herbal remedies, was singled out as a powerful inhibitor of fibroblast growth factors. Gentisic acid was used as a lead to identify additional compounds with better inhibitory characteristics generating a new chemical class of fibroblast growth factor inhibitors that includes the agent responsible for alkaptonuria. Through low and high resolution approaches, using representative members of the fibroblast growth factor family and their cell receptors, it was shown that this class of inhibitors may employ two different mechanisms to interfere with the assembly of the signaling complexes that trigger fibroblast growth factor-driven mitogenesis. In addition, we obtained evidence from in vivo disease models that this group of inhibitors may be of interest to treat cancer and angiogenesis-dependent diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2165545853,"The small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) and alpha-crystallins are highly effective, ATP-independent chaperones that can bind denaturing client proteins to prevent their irreversible aggregation. One model of sHSP function suggests that the oligomeric sHSPs are activated to the client-binding form by dissociation at elevated temperatures to dimers or other sub-oligomeric species. Here we examine this model in a comparison of the oligomeric structure and chaperone activity of two conserved classes of cytosolic sHSPs in plants, the class I (CI) and class II (CII) proteins. Like the CI sHSPs, recombinant CII sHSPs from three divergent plant species, pea, wheat, and Arabidopsis, are dodecamers as determined by nano-electrospray mass spectrometry. While at 35 to 45 degrees C, all three CI sHSPs reversibly dissociate to dimers, the CII sHSPs retain oligomeric structure at high temperature. The CII dodecamers are, however, dynamic and rapidly exchange subunits, but unlike CI sHSPs, the exchange unit appears larger than a dimer. Differences in dodecameric structure are also reflected in the fact that the CII proteins do not hetero-oligomerize with CI sHSPs. Binding of the hydrophobic probe bis-ANS and limited proteolysis demonstrate CII proteins undergo significant, reversible structural changes at high temperature. All three recombinant CII proteins more efficiently protect firefly luciferase from insolubilization during heating than do the CI proteins. The CI and CII proteins behave strictly additively in client protection. In total, the results demonstrate that different sHSPs can achieve effective protection of client proteins by varied mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1828613304,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) protects β-cells against apoptosis, increases their glucose competence, and induces their proliferation. We previously demonstrated that the anti-apoptotic effect was mediated by an increase in insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) expression and signaling, which was dependent on autocrine secretion of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2). Here, we further investigated how GLP-1 induces IGF-1R expression and whether the IGF-2/IGF-1R autocrine loop is also involved in mediating GLP-1-increase in glucose competence and proliferation. We show that GLP-1 up-regulated IGF-1R expression by a protein kinase A-dependent translational control mechanism, whereas isobutylmethylxanthine, which led to higher intracellular accumulation of cAMP than GLP-1, increased both IGF-1R transcription and translation. We then demonstrated, using MIN6 cells and primary islets, that the glucose competence of these cells was dependent on the level of IGF-1R expression and on IGF-2 secretion. We showed that GLP-1-induced primary β-cell proliferation was suppressed by Igf-1r gene inactivation and by IGF-2 immunoneutralization or knockdown. Together our data show that regulation of β-cell number and function by GLP-1 depends on the cAMP/protein kinase A mediated-induction of IGF-1R expression and the increased activity of an IGF-2/IGF-1R autocrine loop.

IntroductionGlucagon-like peptide-1 acutely potentiates glucose-induced insulin secretion and is also a growth and differentiation factor for pancreatic β-cells (1.Egan J.M. Bulotta A. Hui H.

For instance, phosphorylation of various elements of the glucose signaling pathway by PKA is required for the insulinotropic effect of GLP-1, and activation of Epac2 controls the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum as well as the activity of small G proteins regulating insulin granule exocytosis (8.Kang G.

The trophic effects of GLP-1 are mediated by transcriptional control of gene expression, for instance, the PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB, which activates IRS-2 expression (11.Jhala U.S. Canettieri G. Screaton R.A. Kulkarni R.N. Krajewski S. Reed J. Walker J. Lin X. White M. Montminy M. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1575-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), or the PI 3-kinase/Akt-dependent nuclear exclusion of the transcription factor FoxO1 (12.Buteau J. Spatz M.L. Accili D. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 1190-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), which then leads to increased expression of PDX-1 (13.Perfetti R. Zhou J. Doyle M.E. Egan J.M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4600-4605Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), a critical regulator of mature β-cell function.Intracellular cAMP levels have been recognized over two decades ago to be critical for normal glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (14.Pipeleers D.G. Schuit F.C. in't Veld P.A. Maes E. Hooghe-Peters E.L. Van de Winkel M. Gepts W. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 824-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that relatively higher intracellular cAMP levels are required to induce gene transcription than to stimulate secretion (15.Dyachok O. Isakov Y. Sågetorp J. Tengholm A. Nature. 2006; 439: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), and activation of the Epac2 pathways also requires higher intracellular cAMP concentrations than activation of PKA (10.Kashima Y. Miki T. Shibasaki T. Ozaki N. Miyazaki M. Yano H. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46046-46053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar).In a recent study we established a new link between the GLP-1 and IGF-1 receptor signaling pathways (16.Cornu M. Yang J.Y. Jaccard E. Poussin C. Widmann C. Thorens B. Diabetes. 2009; 58: 1816-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We showed that GLP-1 induced a robust up-regulation of IGF-1 receptor expression, which was associated with a parallel increase in Akt phosphorylation. Induction of Akt phosphorylation was dependent on IGF-1 receptor expression, which was activated by the autocrine secretion of IGF-2. We further demonstrated that the protection against cytokine-induced apoptosis conferred by GLP-1 was dependent on IGF-1 receptor up-regulation and IGF-2 action. These data provided evidence for the existence in β-cells of an IGF-2/IGF-1 receptor autocrine loop, whose activity could be increased by up-regulating IGF-1 receptor expression, a mechanism that is the basis for the anti-apoptotic effect of GLP-1.Here, we further demonstrate that the cAMP/PKA pathway induces IGF-1 receptor up-regulation by transcriptional and translational control, with GLP-1 increasing only translation and IBMX increasing both translation and transcription. We then demonstrate that the control by GLP-1 of β-cell glucose competence and proliferation also depends on up-regulation of IGF-1 receptor expression and autocrine production of IGF-2. Thus, the biological processes regulated by GLP-1 to control β-cell mass and function, protection against apoptosis, glucose competence, and proliferation appear to be secondary to the activation of an IGF-2/IGF-1 receptor autocrine loop. This may serve as a general model for the mode of action of all ligands modulating β-cell function through activation of the cAMP signaling pathway.DISCUSSIONHere, we confirmed our previous studies indicating that an IGF-2/IGF-1 receptor autocrine loop operates in pancreatic β-cells and that its activity can be increased by GLP-1 through an up-regulation of IGF-1 receptor expression (16.Cornu M. Yang J.Y. Jaccard E. Poussin C. Widmann C. Thorens B. Diabetes. 2009; 58: 1816-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We further extended these observations by showing that IGF-1 receptor expression can be increased by transcriptional and translational controls and that glucose competence and GLP-1-induced proliferation are also regulated by increased IGF-1R expression and autocrine secretion of IGF-2.Intracellular cAMP levels are critical for the normal functioning of pancreatic β-cells, in particular for their basal glucose competence (26.Schuit F.C. Pipeleers D.G. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 834-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Thus, receptors linked to cAMP production, such as the GLP-1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, glucagon, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide, and many other receptors present at the β-cell surface play an important role in integrating multiple hormonal signals to control cellular cAMP levels. This integrative role is supported, for instance, by our previous data showing that inactivation of both the GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptors, but not of each receptor separately, leads to a cell autonomous defect in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (27.Preitner F. Ibberson M. Franklin I. Binnert C. Pende M. Gjinovci A. Hansotia T. Drucker D.J. Wollheim C. Burcelin R. Thorens B. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Comparative transcript profiling of control and double receptor knock-out islets revealed a reduction in IGF-1 receptor expression in the mutant islets, and subsequent studies showed that GLP-1 treatment of β-cells can robustly increase IGF-1 receptor expression (16.Cornu M. Yang J.Y. Jaccard E. Poussin C. Widmann C. Thorens B. Diabetes. 2009; 58: 1816-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Our present study indicates that at the relatively low cellular cAMP levels induced by GLP-1 treatment, IGF-1R up-regulation is controlled by translation of its mRNA, whereas at the higher levels induced by IBMX, IGF-1R expression is induced both at the transcriptional and translation levels. Although we do not have a formal proof from our data that this differential control of IGF-1R expression depends on graded concentrations of intracellular cAMP, this interpretation is in agreement with the work of Dyachok et al. (15.Dyachok O. Isakov Y. Sågetorp J. Tengholm A. Nature. 2006; 439: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), who compared the effect of IBMX and GLP-1 on intracellular cAMP levels in the insulinoma cell line INS-1. They showed that IBMX led to stable elevations in cAMP levels, whereas GLP-1 only induced oscillatory increase in cAMP. They further showed that stable elevations in cAMP are required for translocating PKA to the nucleus, an event that is necessary for transcriptional control of gene expression. In addition, although IBMX may have actions other than purely increasing cAMP, we have shown that both GLP-1 and IBMX increase IGF-1R expression by the cAMP/PKA pathway, reinforcing the possibility that the differential effect of both agents on IGF-1R expression may be related to changes in intracellular cAMP production.Increased glucose competence and induction of proliferation of mature β-cells are important to preserve or increase β-cell functional mass. Here, we show that similar to the protection against cytokine-induced apoptosis, GLP-1 induces proliferation of β-cells through activation of IGF-1 receptor expression and signaling, which depend on IGF-2 secretion. We previously demonstrated that glucose induced IGF-2 secretion by a mechanism that could be blocked by the KATP channel agonist diazoxide and the Ca2+ channel blocker nimodipine and that can be potentiated by GLP-1 treatment (16.Cornu M. Yang J.Y. Jaccard E. Poussin C. Widmann C. Thorens B. Diabetes. 2009; 58: 1816-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, our data were in agreement with studies showing that IGF-2 is normally co-packaged and secreted with insulin (28.Maake C. Reinecke M. Cell Tissue Res. 1993; 273: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 29.Höög A. Hu W. Abdel-Halim S.M. Falkmer S. Qing L. Grimelius L. Ultrastruct.

J. 2001; 360: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).Together our present data provide additional support for the existence of an IGF-2/IGF-1R autocrine loop operating in β-cells that can be modulated by increasing IGF-1R expression and secretion of IGF-2. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the PKA/CREB pathway activates genes encoding direct regulators of β-cell mass and function, these data and our previous (16.Cornu M. Yang J.Y. Jaccard E. Poussin C. Widmann C. Thorens B. Diabetes. 2009; 58: 1816-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) data identify the IGF-1R/Akt pathway as a central regulator of β-cell biology, with the capacity to control proliferation, glucose competence, and apoptosis. This provides an integrated view of two signaling pathways in β-cells, the cAMP pathway activated by GLP-1 and probably by all ligands binding to Gs protein-coupled receptors expressed by β-cells and the IGF-1R/Akt pathway. Numerous investigations of mice with genetic inactivation of the IGF-1R, of IRS-2, and of Akt have provided evidence for the importance of this pathway in β-cell biological control (11.Jhala U.S. Canettieri G.

Med. 2001; 7: 1133-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Our study provides extended support for this view by demonstrating that this pathway can be enhanced by GLP-1 action. This is in agreement with the observation that GLP-1 induction of β-cell mass was blunted in IRS-2 knock-out mice and the conclusion from this study that IRS-2 signaling was required for the proliferation-inducing effect of GLP-1 (35.Park S. Dong X. Fisher T.L. Dunn S. Omer A.K. Weir G. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1159-1168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In addition, our present demonstration that the autocrine secretion of IGF-2 is required for activation of IGF-1R signaling suggests that this pathway may also be regulated by stimulating IGF-2 production and secretion. Further work will be required to test whether the endogenous production of IGF-2 by β-cells can be regulated by hormonal or nutritional stimuli and whether it is required for the in vivo effect of GLP-1 on β-cell mass and function. Finally, if considered to be of potential therapeutic interest, it should nevertheless be remembered that IGF-2 overexpression is a major step in the progression of hyperplastic islets to tumorigenic transformation (36.Christofori G. Naik P. Hanahan D. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 196-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, it may be an interesting therapeutic approach to transiently increase IGF-2 expression when IGF-1R expression is already increased by GLP-1 treatment. However, at the present time it is not clear whether a similar mechanism also operates in human islets, and determining this is an important goal for future research. IntroductionGlucagon-like peptide-1 acutely potentiates glucose-induced insulin secretion and is also a growth and differentiation factor for pancreatic β-cells (1.Egan J.M. Bulotta A. Hui H.

Its action is initiated by binding to a G protein-coupled receptor that activates adenylate cyclase and production of cAMP (3.Thorens B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

For instance, phosphorylation of various elements of the glucose signaling pathway by PKA is required for the insulinotropic effect of GLP-1, and activation of Epac2 controls the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum as well as the activity of small G proteins regulating insulin granule exocytosis (8.Kang G. Chepurny O.G. Holz G.G. J. Physiol. 2001; 536: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 9.Fujimoto K. Shibasaki T. Yokoi N. Kashima Y. Matsumoto M. Sasaki T. Tajima N. Iwanaga T. Seino S.

The trophic effects of GLP-1 are mediated by transcriptional control of gene expression, for instance, the PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB, which activates IRS-2 expression (11.Jhala U.S. Canettieri G.

Diabetes. 2006; 55: 1190-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), which then leads to increased expression of PDX-1 (13.Perfetti R. Zhou J. Doyle M.E. Egan J.M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4600-4605Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), a critical regulator of mature β-cell function.Intracellular cAMP levels have been recognized over two decades ago to be critical for normal glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (14.Pipeleers D.G.

More recently, it has been shown that relatively higher intracellular cAMP levels are required to induce gene transcription than to stimulate secretion (15.Dyachok O. Isakov Y. Sågetorp J. Tengholm A. Nature. 2006; 439: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), and activation of the Epac2 pathways also requires higher intracellular cAMP concentrations than activation of PKA (10.Kashima Y. Miki T. Shibasaki T. Ozaki N. Miyazaki M. Yano H. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46046-46053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar).In a recent study we established a new link between the GLP-1 and IGF-1 receptor signaling pathways (16.Cornu M. Yang J.Y. Jaccard E. Poussin C. Widmann C. Thorens B. Diabetes. 2009; 58: 1816-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We showed that GLP-1 induced a robust up-regulation of IGF-1 receptor expression, which was associated with a parallel increase in Akt phosphorylation. Induction of Akt phosphorylation was dependent on IGF-1 receptor expression, which was activated by the autocrine secretion of IGF-2. We further demonstrated that the protection against cytokine-induced apoptosis conferred by GLP-1 was dependent on IGF-1 receptor up-regulation and IGF-2 action. These data provided evidence for the existence in β-cells of an IGF-2/IGF-1 receptor autocrine loop, whose activity could be increased by up-regulating IGF-1 receptor expression, a mechanism that is the basis for the anti-apoptotic effect of GLP-1.Here, we further demonstrate that the cAMP/PKA pathway induces IGF-1 receptor up-regulation by transcriptional and translational control, with GLP-1 increasing only translation and IBMX increasing both translation and transcription. We then demonstrate that the control by GLP-1 of β-cell glucose competence and proliferation also depends on up-regulation of IGF-1 receptor expression and autocrine production of IGF-2. Thus, the biological processes regulated by GLP-1 to control β-cell mass and function, protection against apoptosis, glucose competence, and proliferation appear to be secondary to the activation of an IGF-2/IGF-1 receptor autocrine loop. This may serve as a general model for the mode of action of all ligands modulating β-cell function through activation of the cAMP signaling pathway."

To gain insight into these mechanisms, we studied the behavior of cells entering mitosis with damaged chromosomes. We used the endonuclease I-CreI to generate acentric chromosomes in Drosophila larvae. While I-CreI expression produces acentric chromosomes in the majority of neuronal stem cells, remarkably, it has no effect on adult survival. Our live studies reveal that acentric chromatids segregate efficiently to opposite poles. The acentric chromatid poleward movement is mediated through DNA tethers decorated with BubR1, Polo, INCENP, and Aurora-B. Reduced BubR1 or Polo function results in abnormal segregation of acentric chromatids, a decrease in acentric chromosome tethering, and a great reduction in adult survival. We propose that BubR1 and Polo facilitate the accurate segregation of acentric chromatids by maintaining the integrity of the tethers that connect acentric chromosomes to their centric partners.

Endonuclease expression produces acentric chromosome fragments in fly stem cells Acentric fragments segregate efficiently to opposing poles at anaphase BubR1- and Polo-coated DNA tethers connect centric and acentric fragments BubR1 and Polo are required for tether formation and acentric chromosome segregation Although cells possess a number of mechanisms for repairing DNA damage, double-strand breaks (DSBs) are particularly troublesome (Su, 2006Su T.T. Cellular responses to DNA damage: one signal, multiple choices.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2006; 40: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Failure to repair DSBs results in chromosome fragments lacking either telomeres or centromeres. It is well established that without the protection of intact telomeres, end-to-end chromosome fusions produce dicentrics, extensive chromosome rearrangements, and aneuploidy (Tusell et al., 2008Tusell L. Soler D. Agostini M. Pampalona J. Genescà A. The number of dysfunctional telomeres in a cell: one amplifies; more than one translocate.Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2008; 122: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The acentric fragments produced from unrepaired DSBs are equally problematic. Since acentric fragments lack kinetochores, one might expect acentrics to be incapable of poleward segregation. Surprisingly, however, poleward movement of acentrics has been observed in a number of systems. Efficient acentric segregation is demonstrated in budding yeast, where broken chromosomes transit through many generations before being repaired (Galgoczy and Toczyski, 2001Galgoczy D.J.

Loss of a yeast telomere: arrest, recovery, and chromosome loss.Cell. 1993; 75: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, acentrics generated through the bridge-breakage-fusion cycle accumulate to high copy number, indicating efficient acentric segregation through several cell cycles (Titen and Golic, 2008Titen S.W. Golic K.G. Telomere loss provokes multiple pathways to apoptosis and produces genomic instability in Drosophila melanogaster.Genetics. 2008; 180: 1821-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Further analysis in budding yeast shows that two chromosome fragments created by one irreversible DSB remain apposed throughout mitosis (Melo et al., 2001Melo J.A. Cohen J. Toczyski D.P. Two checkpoint complexes are independently recruited to sites of DNA damage in vivo.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2809-2821PubMed Google Scholar). Mechanisms of acentric segregation include neocentromere formation and association of acentrics with undamaged chromosomes (Ishii et al., 2008Ishii K. Ogiyama Y. Chikashige Y. Soejima S. Masuda F.

Cell. 1999; 4: 995-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Here, we describe a distinct tether-based mechanism facilitating acentric segregation. By studying the fate of acentrics in Drosophila larval neuroblasts, we discovered that acentric chromosome fragments lag on the metaphase plate but ultimately undergo poleward segregation during anaphase. Our data demonstrate that segregation is achieved through DNA tethers connecting the acentric and centric fragments. These tethers are decorated with Polo kinase, the spindle checkpoint component BubR1, and two chromosomal passenger complex proteins, INCENP and Aurora-B. In bubR1- and polo-compromised backgrounds, the efficiency of acentric poleward segregation is significantly diminished and the frequency of acentrics untethered to their centric partners is increased. These phenotypes are correlated with a dramatic decrease in survival upon DSB induction. These studies reveal a distinct mechanism by which acentric chromatids segregate accurately and suggest an additional role for BubR1 and Polo in the prevention of chromosomal instability (CIN). To study the behavior of acentrics, we generated DSBs by expressing the endonuclease I-CreI. I-CreI recognizes a 20 nt sequence in the rDNA repeats located in the centromeric heterochromatin of the Drosophila sex chromosomes (Rong et al., 2002Rong Y.S. Titen S.W. Xie H.B. Golic M.M. Bastiani M. Bandyopadhyay P. Olivera B.M. Brodsky M. Rubin G.M. Golic K.G. Targeted mutagenesis by homologous recombination in D. melanogaster.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1568-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The Drosophila X chromosome is acrocentric, and DAPI-stained mitotic X chromosomes form a “V” with the centromeric heterochromatin “head” more brightly stained that the two sister chromatid arms (Figure 1A ). The I-CreI-induced breaks create two distinct chromosome fragments: a centric short “head” and an acentric long arm (Figure 1A) (Royou et al., 2005Royou A. Macias H. Sullivan W. The Drosophila Grp/Chk1 DNA damage checkpoint controls entry into anaphase.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 334-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A line bearing the I-CreI transgene with heat shock 70 promoter was used in our experiments. Late-third-instar larvae were heat shocked for 1 hr to induce I-CreI expression, followed by at least 1 hr of recovery. Heat shock itself provokes a dramatic reduction of the mitotic index of larval neuroblasts for up to 50 min after heat shock (Royou et al., 2005Royou A. Macias H. Sullivan W. The Drosophila Grp/Chk1 DNA damage checkpoint controls entry into anaphase.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 334-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). I-CreI expression induced a DNA damage checkpoint-dependent delay in interphase, indicating that I-CreI had damaged the DNA (Royou et al., 2005Royou A. Macias H. Sullivan W. The Drosophila Grp/Chk1 DNA damage checkpoint controls entry into anaphase.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 334-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To determine whether I-CreI efficiently creates DSBs, we stained neuroblasts with antibodies directed against γH2Av (Figure 1B). γH2Av accumulates specifically at the site of double-strand breaks (Vidanes et al., 2005Vidanes G.M. Bonilla C.Y. Toczyski D.P. Complicated tails: histone modifications and the DNA damage response.Cell. 2005; 121: 973-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In heat-shocked neuroblasts from control larvae, no lagging chromatids were observed at anaphase and no γH2Av signal was detected. In contrast, heat-shocked neuroblasts from I-CreI larvae exhibited lagging chromatids at anaphase. A strong punctate γH2Av signal was detected on these lagging chromatids, indicating that I-CreI had created DSBs (Figure 1B). Third-instar larvae brains were fixed and stained with Orcein at multiple time points after heat shock to score the frequency of anaphases with lagging chromatids (Figures 1C and 1D). Control larvae rarely exhibited anaphase with lagging chromatids. In contrast, lagging chromatids were observed in an average of 80% of neuroblasts for up to 5 hr after I-CreI induction (Figure 1D). Moreover, 1 day after I-CreI induction, half of the neuroblasts scored exhibited lagging chromatids (Figure 1D). Because the frequency of anaphases with acentrics remains high long after I-CreI induction, this suggests that the cells with acentrics are capable of multiple rounds of division. Alternatively, I-CreI may persist through multiple cycles, creating breaks that are constantly repaired. Since 80% of the dividing cells exhibit lagging chromatids upon I-CreI induction, we assayed the effect of I-CreI expression on adult survival. Remarkably, no differences in the frequency of third-instar larvae developing into adults were observed between control and I-CreI-bearing larvae (Table 1).Table 1Survival Rate of Late-Third-Instar Larvae to AdulthoodI-CreI ExpressionNumber of ExperimentsTotal Number of LarvaeaNumber of larvae per experiment is greater than nine.Percent Survival into AdulthoodbMean ± STD.Wild-typeNo311477.2 ± 8.4Wild-typeYes312578.0 ± 15.7mad2pNo23373.5 ± 4.9mad2pYes711672.9 ± 10.4bubR1−KENNo45172.1 ± 10.7bubR1−KENYes918718.4 ± 7.6polo1/polo10No611780.9 ± 9.3polo1/polo10Yes61260a Number of larvae per experiment is greater than nine.b Mean ± STD. Open table in a new tab To understand how cells compensate for DSB-induced acentric chromosomes, we studied acentric behavior in living cells during mitosis using the GFP-H2Av marker (Clarkson and Saint, 1999Clarkson M. Saint R. A His2AvDGFP fusion gene complements a lethal His2AvD mutant allele and provides an in vivo marker for Drosophila chromosome behavior.DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We examined neuroblasts from late-third-instar larvae as they entered the first mitosis after I-CreI induction (1–2 hr after heat shock). Because I-CreI creates long X and small Y acentric fragments, female larvae neuroblasts were studied exclusively. Control images of heat-shocked neuroblasts highlight alignment of the chromosomes during metaphase and rapid segregation of sister chromatids during anaphase (Figure 2A , top row; Movie S1 available online). After induction of I-CreI, acentric chromosomes aligned at the periphery of the metaphase plate, slightly separated from the main body of chromosomes (Figure 2A, cyan arrow; Movie S1). During anaphase the acentric fragments oriented on a plane parallel to the spindle and segregating toward the poles (Figure 2A, second row, cyan arrows; Movie S1). In this cell, the last acentric initiated its poleward movement 2.3 min after anaphase onset (yellow arrow). Remarkably, while acentric segregation was delayed, the acentrics underwent poleward movement in 95% of neuroblasts examined (n = 71). In 73% of anaphases, two acentric fragments segregated toward each pole (equal segregation), presumably giving rise to diploid daughter cells. In 27% of anaphases, we observed one, three, or four acentric fragments segregating to one pole (unequal segregation), thus creating aneuploid daughter cells (Figure 2A, third row, cyan arrowheads; Movie S1). In this cell, the last acentric initiated its poleward movement 5 min after anaphase onset (yellow arrow). Proper segregation of sister acentrics provides an opportunity for repair in the daughter cells and may account for the high survival rates. Because one-quarter of the cells going through mitosis become aneuploid at each round of division, we predict that I-CreI expression at an earlier stage of development will induce lethality. In fact, we found that I-CreI expression at second-instar larval stage produced a high rate of lethality (data not shown). We analyzed the delay of acentric poleward segregation by calculating the time elapsed between the anaphase onset (segregation of centric chromosomes) and the initiation of poleward movement of the last acentric chromatid. Most of the acentrics segregated within 4 min following anaphase onset (90%, n = 42, Figure 2B). In control heat-shocked neuroblasts, the DAPI-stained X chromosomes exhibited normal V shape (Figure 2C, control). After I-CreI induction, acentric and centric X chromosome fragments often remained associated with one another by a thin DNA thread (referred to as a “tether”) (Figure 2C, second row, cyan arrows). We also found 50% (n = 103) of acentric homologs interlinked (Figure 2C, second row, purple arrows). Only 11% (n = 103) of cells had at least one X chromosome where the acentric and centric fragments were dissociated (Figure 2C, third row, red arrows). In some instances, the two acentric fragments, one from each homolog, appeared to be associated with the same centric fragment (Figure 2C, third row, yellow arrow). When dissociated from the centric fragment, the acentric sister chromatids always remained paired (Figure 2C, third row, red star). Since we observe acentrics without tethers, this suggests that they are easily broken or do not always form. We cannot rule out that some tethers might be too thin to be detected. To determine whether neocentromeres play a role in acentric segregation, we examined the localization of Cid, the centromeric histone H3 variant, in live neuroblasts (Figure S1A). Functional kinetochores require Cid (Blower and Karpen, 2001Blower M.D. Karpen G.H. The role of Drosophila CID in kinetochore formation, cell-cycle progression and heterochromatin interactions.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 730-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In control cells, Cid-GFP localized on centromeres throughout mitosis (data not shown) (Schuh et al., 2007Schuh M. Lehner C.F. Heidmann S. Incorporation of Drosophila CID/CENP-A and CENP-C into centromeres during early embryonic anaphase.Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 237-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). After I-CreI induction, no Cid-GFP signal was detected on lagging acentrics, suggesting that neocentromeres do not form on the acentrics (Figure S1A, white arrows). To test whether the presence of an acentric activates the spindle checkpoint, we analyzed the localization of two components of the spindle checkpoint, Mad2 and BubR1, after I-CreI induction (Musacchio and Salmon, 2007Musacchio A. Salmon E.D. The spindle-assembly checkpoint in space and time.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 379-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1616) Google Scholar). In vivo studies using GFP-Mad2 revealed faint Mad2 labeling at the kinetochore during anaphase (Figure S1B, yellow arrows) (Buffin et al., 2005Buffin E. Lefebvre C. Huang J. Gagou M.E. Karess R.E.

However, we did not observe signal of GFP-Mad2 in the vicinity of the lagging chromatids (Figure S1B, white arrowheads; Movie S1). In contrast, immunostaining of prometaphase neuroblasts with anti-BubR1 antibodies revealed BubR1 puncta along the DNA tethers that connect the centric and acentric fragments in addition to its normal kinetochore localization (Figure 3A , red arrows). A strong BubR1 signal was also observed at the broken end of each dissociated fragment (Figure 3A, yellow arrows). In anaphase, BubR1 labeled the DNA tether and lagging acentric fragments. Interestingly, immunostaining of anaphase neuroblasts with antibodies directed against INCENP and Aurora B, two components of the chromosomal passenger complex, found a robust staining of these proteins at the tips of the lagging acentrics and on the tether (Figure 3A, red arrows). Our live analysis of neuroblasts expressing RFP-Histone and GFP-BubR1 confirmed the localization of BubR1 on the DNA tether. In control neuroblasts, GFP-BubR1 stained only the kinetochores (Figure 3B and Movie S2) (Buffin et al., 2005Buffin E. Lefebvre C. Huang J. Gagou M.E. Karess R.E. Recruitment of Mad2 to the kinetochore requires the Rod/Zw10 complex.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 856-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Upon I-CreI induction, in addition to kinetochore staining, strong BubR1 puncta were observed in nonkinetochore regions (Figure 3B, yellow arrow; Movie S2). This strong BubR1 staining persisted through anaphase and colocalized with the tip of the acentric (white and yellow arrows). BubR1 signal stretched from the tip of the lagging acentric to the bulk of chromatids as the cell progressed though anaphase (Figure 3B, yellow arrow; Figure S1C). The signal decreased in length during late anaphase as the acentric reached the main mass of chromosomes (Figure 3B, yellow arrows). Three other unconventional BubR1 localizations were detected during anaphase. These were correlated with the tip of each lagging acentric fragment (white and red arrows). During metaphase and anaphase, the BubR1 signal on the tether was stronger than the BubR1 kinetochore signal (Figure 3B and Figure S1C). Because Polo kinase interacts with BubR1 (Elowe et al., 2007Elowe S. Hümmer S. Uldschmid A. Li X. Nigg E.A. Tension-sensitive Plk1 phosphorylation on BubR1 regulates the stability of kinetochore microtubule interactions.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2205-2219Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, Wong and Fang, 2007Wong O.K.

Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we used a GFP-Polo construct to determine whether Polo localized on the tethers as well. GFP-Polo localized on centrosomes, spindle microtubules, and kinetochores during early anaphase and accumulated on the central spindle at cytokinesis in control neuroblasts (Figure 3C and Movie S2) (Moutinho-Santos et al., 1999Moutinho-Santos T. Sampaio P. Amorim I. Costa M. Sunkel C.E. In vivo localisation of the mitotic POLO kinase shows a highly dynamic association with the mitotic apparatus during early embryogenesis in Drosophila.Biol. Cell. 1999; 91: 585-596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon I-CreI induction, GFP-Polo localized at the tip of the acentric fragments and along the length of the DNA tether (Figure 3C and Movie S2). The GFP-Polo signal became punctate as the tethers stretched from the acentric to the bulk of chromatids during anaphase (Figure 3C, yellow arrows, 2:00 min). To investigate whether similar BubR1-decorated tethers form following DBSs created in euchromatin, we exposed larval neuroblasts to 680 RADS γ-irradiation. To increase the frequency of cells entering mitosis with DBSs, we irradiated neuroblasts from third-instar larvae mutant for the DNA damage checkpoint gene grp(chk1) (Royou et al., 2005Royou A. Macias H. Sullivan W. The Drosophila Grp/Chk1 DNA damage checkpoint controls entry into anaphase.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 334-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In nontreated and treated grp(chk1) neuroblasts, BubR1 localized at the kinetochore, indicating that, in contrast with what has been observed in some mammalian cell types (Zachos et al., 2007Zachos G. Black E.J. Walker M. Scott M.T. Vagnarelli P. Earnshaw W.C. Gillespie D.A. Chk1 is required for spindle checkpoint function.Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 247-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), Grp(Chk1) is not required for proper BubR1 accumulation at the kinetochore in Drosophila (Figure 3D, control). After γ-irradiation, tether-like structures were detected on chromosome arms (Figure 3D, yellow arrows). Significantly, ectopic BubR1 signals were clearly visible on chromosome arms and on tethers (Figure 3D, red and yellow arrows). These results indicate that tethers form at both euchromatic and heretochromatic DNA breaks. In addition, they show that BubR1 accumulates on DNA breaks regardless of the chromatin state. We tested the possibility that BubR1 tether association activates the spindle checkpoint. In fixed cells, we previously demonstrated that anaphase onset was delayed upon I-CreI induction (Royou et al., 2005Royou A. Macias H. Sullivan W. The Drosophila Grp/Chk1 DNA damage checkpoint controls entry into anaphase.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 334-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Grapes (Grp), the Drosophila Chk1 homolog, but not BubR1, was required for this delay. To confirm that BubR1 spindle checkpoint activity is not required for the delay, we examined living cells in mitosis and timed the interval from nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB) to anaphase onset (Figures S2A and S2B). In control neuroblasts, the average transit time from NEB to anaphase onset was 7.8 min (standard deviation [STD] = 1.8, n = 18). This timing increased significantly upon I-CreI induction (mean = 13.4 min, STD = 4.4, n = 44, Wilcoxon rank-sum test p < 0.0001). To test whether this delay required BubR1 spindle checkpoint function, we performed this analysis on homozygous strong hypomorph bubR11 mutant neuroblasts expressing one copy of BubR1 mutated in one of its KEN boxes and fused to RFP (thereafter referred to as bubR1-KEN mutant; see the Extended Experimental Procedures) (Rahmani et al., 2009Rahmani Z.

Mutations in the KEN box impair BubR1 spindle checkpoint function (Burton and Solomon, 2007Burton J.L. Solomon M.J.

Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23039-23047Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Examination of live neuroblasts revealed that, after I-CreI induction, anaphase onset was delayed in bubR1-KEN mutant relative to non-I-CreI bubR1-KEN mutant (11.9 ± 4.0 versus 6.4 ± 1.4, mean ± STD, n = 38 and 23, respectively, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p < 0.0001) (Figure S2B). These results suggest that BubR1 spindle checkpoint activity is not required to delay anaphase entry upon I-CreI induction. We further verified this result by comparing the anaphase index in heat-shocked bubR1-KEN mutants with or without the I-CreI transgene (control and I-CreI respectively, Figure S2C). The anaphase index was significantly lower in bubR1-KEN after I-CreI induction (Student's t test, p < 0.001). To decipher the function of BubR1 and Polo on tethers, we examined the segregation of I-CreI-induced acentrics in live bubR1-KEN and bubR1-KD (kinase dead) mutant and transheterozygote polo1/polo10 mutants (see the Extended Experimental Procedures). It has recently been shown that bubR1-KD retains spindle checkpoint activity but exhibits defects in spindle morphology. (Rahmani et al., 2009Rahmani Z. Gagou M.E. Lefebvre C. Emre D. Karess R.E. Separating the spindle, checkpoint, and timer functions of BubR1.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 187: 597-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Live analysis of bubR1-KD neuroblasts revealed a slight increase in the frequency of unequal segregation of acentrics compared to the wild-type (37.5% and 26.7%, respectively; Figure 4C ). However, the frequency of unequal segregation of acentrics was dramatically higher in the bubR1-KEN mutant (62.5% versus 26.7% for the wild-type, Pearson χ2 test, p < 0.001; Figures 4A and 4C and Movie S3). Similarly, the polo1/polo10 mutant exhibited a high frequency of improper acentric segregation (56.3% versus 26.7% for the wild-type, Pearson χ2 test, p < 0.004; Figure 4C). We also examined the influence of BubR1 and Polo on the timing of acentric segregation. In bubR1-KD, bubR1-KEN, and polo1/polo10 mutants, the frequency of anaphases in which the last acentric initiated its poleward movement beyond 4 min after anaphase onset increased more than 3-, 5-, and 7- fold, respectively, relative to the wild-type (Pearson χ2 test, p < 0.04, p < 0.002, and p < 0.001, respectively; Figure 4D). Interestingly, the frequency of acentrics that initiated poleward movement more than 7 min after anaphase onset (or did not initiate poleward movement within the time frame of the movie) was higher in the bubR1-KEN mutant compared to the wild-type and BubR1-KD and polo1/polo10 mutants (26% versus 5% for the wild-type, Pearson χ2 test, p < 0.009; Figure 4D). Some acentrics that failed to segregate within 7 min after anaphase onset were still connected to the bulk of chromatids by a GFP-histone positive tether (Figures 4B and 4B′, purple square, red and cyan arrows). In other cases, no GFP-histone-labeled tethers were detected between the inert acentric fragments and the segregated chromatids (Figures 4B and 4B′, yellow square, cyan arrows). In these cases, tethers may be present but not detectable by the GFP-histone signal. The I-CreI-induced acentrics congressed and aligned properly on the metaphase plate in all wild-type neuroblasts examined (Figure 2). In bubR1-KEN and bubR1-KD mutants, we occasionally observed acentrics detaching from the metaphase plate. In the example shown in Figure 5A (purple circle and arrows), one acentric fragment was attached to the bulk of chromosomes by what appears to be the telomeric end of one sister chromatid. It detached during the prolonged metaphase but eventually reattached to the main chromosome mass (Figure 5A, purple arrow). Anaphase was subsequently abnormal, giving rise to aneuploid daughter cells. Thus, tethers are unstable when BubR1 function is reduced. Examination of chromosomes from prometaphase arrested cells in fixed bubR1-KEN mutant neuroblasts confirmed this result. The frequency of acentrics not tethered to their centric partner was significantly higher in the bubR1-KEN mutant compared to the wild-type (32% versus 11%, n = 138 and 103, respectively, Pearson χ2 test, p < 0.001; Figure 5B). In addition, the frequency of dissociated acentrics more than doubled in the polo1/polo10 mutant relative to the wild-type (31% versus 11%, n = 116 and 103, respectively, Pearson χ2 test, p < 0.001; Figure 5B). We also examined the frequency of dissociated acentrics in mad2p null mutants. Mad2 is a core component of the spindle checkpoint but does not localize on tethers. In mad2p mutants, we observed similar frequencies of dissociated fragments as in the wild-type (12% versus 11%, n = 130 and 103, respectively; Figure 5B). These results, combined with the live analysis, suggest a model in which BubR1 and Polo are required for the integrity of the tethers in a Mad2-independent manner. Disruption of BubR1 function dramatically decreased the frequency of I-CreI larvae developing into adu"
https://openalex.org/W2132997085,"The functions of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) on morphogenesis, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and calcium homeostasis have been attributed to its N terminus. Evidence suggests that many of these effects are not mediated by the N terminus but by the midregion, a nuclear localization sequence (NLS), and C terminus of the protein. A knock-in mouse lacking the midregion, NLS, and C terminus of PTHrP (Pthrp△/△) was developed. Pthrp△/△ mice had craniofacial dysplasia, chondrodysplasia, and kyphosis, with most mice dying by d 5 of age. In bone, there were fewer chondrocytes and osteoblasts per area, bone mass was decreased, and the marrow was less cellular, with erythroid hypoplasia. Cellular proliferation was impaired, and apoptosis was increased. Runx2, Ocn, Sox9, Crtl1, ß-catenin, Runx1, ephrin B2, cyclin D1, and Gata1 were underexpressed while P16/ Ink4a, P21, GSK-3ß, Il-6, Ffg3, and Ihh were overexpressed. Mammary gland development was aberrant, and energy metabolism was deregulated. These results establish that the midregion, NLS, and C terminus of PTHrP are crucial for the commitment of osteogenic and hematopoietic precursors to their lineages, and for survival, and many of the effects of PTHrP on development are not mediated by its N terminus. The down-regulation of Runx1, Runx2, and Sox9 indicates that PTHrP is a modulator of transcriptional activation during stem cell commitment. Toribio, R E., Brown, H. A., Novince, C. M., Marlow, B.

These nAChRs, located both pre- and post-synaptically, modulate the release of neurotransmitters and/or mediate fast synaptic transmission (1Lester H.A. Dibas M.I. Dahan D.S. Leite J.F.

In mammals, there are nine α and four β nAChR subunits that can combine to form multiple subtypes of hetero-pentamers (3Dani J.A. Bertrand D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2007; 47: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). The array of physiological functions mediated by nAChRs is correspondingly broad. Compounds acting on nicotinic receptors are currently utilized as medications for treating nicotine addiction and are being explored as therapeutic options for a variety of conditions, including cognitive disorders and pain (4Gotti C.

Understanding the factors contributing to ligand-nAChR subtype specificity will play a crucial role in developing compounds that have the desired therapeutic effects but that lack side effects (5Gotti C.

Many phyla utilize acetylcholine for neurotransmission. Predatory organisms have exploited this by developing toxins that act at nAChRs to disrupt the flight and fight of their prey (6Olivera B.M. Quik M. Vincler M. McIntosh J.M. Channels. 2008; 2: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Predatory marine snails of the genus Conus synthesize complex venoms that contain an arsenal of peptides. Over the past several years, these “conotoxins” have been shown to have a remarkable diversity of pharmacological function and utility (7Armishaw C.J. Alewood P.F. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2005; 6: 221-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 8Craik D.J. Adams D.J. ACS Chem. Biol. 2007; 2: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Based on molecular structure, the conotoxins have been grouped into A, O, M, P, R, S, and T superfamilies (9Zhangsun D. Luo S. Wu Y. Zhu X. Hu Y. Xie L. Chem. Biol. Drug Des. 2006; 68: 256-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 10Luo S. Zhangsun D. Zhang B. Chen X. Feng J. Peptides. 2006; 27: 2640-2646Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A subgroup of compounds found within the A superfamily is the α-conotoxins. These are small, 13–21-residue, cysteine-rich peptides that functionally block nAChRs (11Terlau H. Olivera B.M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 41-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 12Olivera B.M. Teichert R.W. Mol. Interv. 2007; 7: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Structural studies utilizing NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography have provided insight into the role and spatial location of residues important for function (13Dutertre S. Lewis R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2327-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Previously characterized α-conotoxins have a highly conserved Ser-Xaa-Pro motif in the first intercysteine loop. The Pro residue is essential for high affinity binding to nAChRs (14Ellison M. Olivera B.M. Chem. Rec. 2007; 7: 341-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This study characterizes the novel α4/7 conotoxin LtIA, which lacks the highly conserved Ser-Xaa-Pro sequence but maintains high potency. (The 4/7 terminology refers to the number of non-Cys residues in the first and second intercysteine loops present in all α-conotoxins.) Structural and functional studies provide insight into the mechanism of action and the nature of the nAChR-binding site of LtIA. nAChRs are pentamers made up of α and β subunits. Previous reports indicated that the ACh-binding site is composed of a hydrophobic group of conserved aromatic residues from both the α and β subunits in proximity to the two disulfide-linked vicinal cysteines of the α subunit C loop. High conservation of residues that form the ligand-binding interface among subtypes of nAChRs hinders the ability of ligands to discriminate among these subtypes. However, nonconserved residues appear to line a binding cleft, and functional understanding of these residues could be utilized to develop subtype-specific ligands (15Dutertre S. Nicke A. Tyndall J.D. Lewis R.J. J. Mol. Recognit. 2004; 17: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16Dutertre S. Nicke A. Lewis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30460-30468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Mutation of one of these residues, nAChR β2 subunit Phe-119, substantially reduces the block by LtIA. This decrease in activity is the largest effect described thus far for a β subunit mutant affecting α-conotoxin block and was supported by molecular docking simulations. α-Conotoxin LtIA, the first α-conotoxin to be identified from Conus litteratus of the South China Sea, provides a novel probe of nAChR structure and function.

All cysteines were protected with S-trityl groups. The peptides were removed from a solid support by treatment with reagent K (trifluoroacetic acid/water/ethanedithiol/phenol/thioanisole, 82.5:5:2.5:5:5, v/v). The released peptide was precipitated and washed several times with cold ether. The reduced peptides were purified by reverse-phase HPLC using a preparative C18 Vydac column with a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The flow rate was 10 ml/min, and elution was monitored by UV detection at 215 nm. Identity of each peptide was confirmed by ESI-MS analysis. After purification, the linear peptide was lyophilized. Folding was carried out in a buffered solution of 0.1 m NH4HCO3, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA. The final peptide concentration was 20 μm. The reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature (25 °C) for 72 h. The reaction mixture was then quenched by acidification with formic acid (8% final concentration), and the samples were separated by analytical reverse-phase C18 HPLC, using the following gradient of acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1 ml/min: 0–50 min 0–50% solvent B, 50–55 min 50–100% solvent B. Solvent B is 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in 90% acetonitrile. The analogs LtIA(A4S/A6P) and LtIA(A4S) were manually synthesized by t-butoxycarbonyl chemistry coupled with in situ neutralization protocol on 4-methylbenzhydrylamine amide resin (Peptide Institute). 0.5 m 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate in N,N-dimethylformamide was the activation agent; diisopropylethylamine was the neutralization agent, and the terminal amide protection groups were removed using trifluoroacetic acid. The peptides were cleaved off the resin using HF with p-cresol and p-thiocresol as scavengers (HF/p-cresol/p-thiocresol, 10:1:1, v/v) at 0 °C for 1 h. The peptides were then precipitated with cold diethyl ether, dissolved in 50% acetonitrile containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, and lyophilized. The mass of the crude peptides was verified by ESI-MS on Applied Biosystems API 2000 liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The crude peptides were purified by preparative reverse-phase HPLC using a Vydac C18 column (22 × 250 mm, 10 μm) on a Waters 600E solvent delivery system using a linear gradient of 1% buffer B per min at a flow rate of 10 ml/min (buffer A, H2O, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid; buffer B, 90% acetonitrile, 10% H2O, 0.043% trifluoroacetic acid), and the eluant was monitored at 230 nm. Disulfide bonds were formed by air oxidation of free thiol groups on cysteine residues in 0.1 m NH4HCO3 buffer with 30% isopropyl alcohol. The reaction was carried out overnight at room temperature, and the peptide concentration was 0.1 mg/ml. The molecular weight of the folded peptide was verified by ESI-MS, which was then purified and lyophilized. The purity of the product obtained after each purification step was determined by analytical reverse-phase HPLC using Shimadzu LC-2010 system using a Vydac C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm) at the flow rate of 1 ml/min. α-Conotoxin LtIA was synthesized on an amide resin using Fmoc chemistry and standard side protection, except for cysteine residues. Cys residues were protected in pairs with either S-trityl on Cys-2 and Cys-8 or S-acetamidomethyl on Cys-3 and Cys-16. The crude peptide was cleaved from the resin and precipitated. A two-step oxidation protocol was used to fold the peptides selectively as described previously (19Dowell C. Olivera B.M. Garrett J.E. Staheli S.T. Watkins M. Kuryatov A. Yoshikami D. Lindstrom J.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8445-8452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the disulfide bridge between Cys-2 and Cys-8 was closed by dripping the peptide into an equal volume of 20 mm potassium ferricyanide, 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5. The solution was allowed to react for 30 min, and the monocyclic peptide was purified by reverse-phase HPLC. Simultaneous removal of the S-acetamidomethyl groups and closure of the disulfide bridge between Cys-3 and Cys-16 were carried out by iodine oxidation as follow; the monocyclic peptide in HPLC eluent was dripped into an equal volume of iodine (10 mm) in H2O/trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile (78:2:20 by volume) and allowed to react for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of ascorbic acid and diluted 20-fold with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the bicyclic peptide was purified by HPLC on a reverse-phase C18 Vydac column using a linear gradient of 0.1% and 0.092% trifluoroacetic acid, 60% acetonitrile, and the remainder H2O. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry was utilized to confirm the identity of the products. Capped cRNA for the various subunits were made using the mMessage mMachine in vitro transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) following linearization of the plasmid. The cRNA was purified using the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The concentration of cRNA was determined by absorbance at 260 nm. cRNA of chimera α6/α3 was combined with cRNA of high expressing β2 and β3 subunits or β4 (in the pGEMHE vector) to give 167–500 ng/μl of each subunit cRNA. Fifty nl of this mixture was injected into each Xenopus oocyte with a Drummond microdispenser (Drummond Scientific, Broomall, PA), as described previously, and incubated at 17 °C. Oocytes were injected within 1 day of harvesting, and recordings were made 2–4 days post-injection. Oocytes were voltage-clamped and exposed to ACh and peptide as described previously (20Cartier G.E. Yoshikami D. Gray W.R. Luo S. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7522-7528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Briefly, the oocyte chamber consisting of a cylindrical well (∼30 μl in volume) was gravity-perfused at a rate of ∼2 ml/min with ND-96 buffer (96.0 mm NaCl, 2.0 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.1–7.5) containing 1 μm atropine and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. In the case of the α9α10 and mouse muscle α1β1δϵ subtypes, the ND-96 contained no atropine when recording. The oocyte was subjected once a minute to a 1-s pulse of 100 μm ACh. In the case of the α9α10 and mouse muscle α1β1δϵ subtypes, there is a 1-s pulse of 10 μm ACh. 200 μm ACh pulse is for the α7 subtype. For screening of receptor subtypes, for toxin concentrations of 10 μm and lower, once a stable base line was achieved, either ND-96 alone or ND-96 containing varying concentrations of the α-conotoxins was manually pre-applied for 5 min prior to the addition of the agonist. All recordings were done at room temperature (∼22 °C). The average of five control responses just preceding a test response was used to normalize the test response to obtain “% response.” Each data point of a dose-response curve represents the average ± S.E. of at least four oocytes. The dose-response data were fit to the equation, % response = 100/(1 + ([toxin]/IC50)⋀nH), where nH is the Hill coefficient, by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego). CD spectra were acquired on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter, which was routinely calibrated using 0.6% (w/v) ammonium-d-camphor-10-sulfonate. All experiments were conducted at room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere (15 ml/min). The scanning speed was set to 50 nm/min with response time of 1 s, sensitivity range of 100 millidegrees, and a step resolution of 1 nm. Absorbance was measured in the far-UV region (190–260 nm) using a cell with a 1-mm path length, and each recording was an accumulation of four scans. CD spectra were obtained for peptides dissolved in 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer at pH 7. Spectra were also obtained after addition of 10 and 30% (v/v) trifluoroethanol in phosphate buffer. CD spectra of the pure solvents were subtracted from those of the peptide samples to eliminate interference due to solvent, cell, or spectropolarimeter optics. The molar ellipticity [θ] was calculated using Equation 1, [θ]=θ/(10×C×NP×I)(Eq. 1) where θ is ellipticity in millidegrees; C is molar concentration of the peptide; Np is number of peptide units (Np = 15 for LtIA), and l is the path length of the cell. 1H NMR measurements were recorded on a 1 mm solution of the globular isomer of LtIA in 10% D2O, 90% H2O at ∼pH 3. Spectra were obtained on a Bruker Avance 600-MHz spectrometer at 280, 290, 300, and 310 K. The spectra for LtIA(A4S) and LtIA(A4S/A6P) were recorded at 308 and 290 K, respectively. The two-dimensional NMR experiments consisted of total correlation spectroscopy using an MLEV17 spin lock sequence with an isotropic mixing time of 80 ms and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) experiments with mixing times of 200, 300, and 350 ms. Spectra were recorded in a phase-sensitive mode using time proportional phase incriminations. A modified WATERGATE sequence was used for suppression of the water signal. All spectra obtained were processed using Topspin (Bruker). Resonance assignment was carried out using the program SPARKY. Molecular models of rat α3 and β2 subunits were built individually using α1-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α1-nAChR; PDB code 2QC1) (21Dellisanti C.D. Yao Y. Stroud J.C. Wang Z.Z. Chen L. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 953-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) as the template, and the interface was created using Lymnaea stagnalis acetylcholine-binding protein (Ls-AChBP; PDB code 1IBG) (22Brejc K. van Dijk W.J.

Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 461-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar). These templates were chosen as they share a high degree of conservation in protein sequence identities with rat α3 and β2 subunits as determined by BLAST (24Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70579) Google Scholar). The native LtIA and its analogs LtIA(A4S) and LtIA(A4S/A6P) vary in their α-helical tendencies in solution as suggested by both NMR and CD analyses. Although the bound state of the peptide is unknown, as an initial approach, we built the LtIA, LtIA(A4S) and LtIA(A4S/A6P) models using the TxIA (A10L) template extracted from the Aplysia californica AChBP-TxIA(A10L) co-crystal structure (PDB code 2UZ6) (25Dutertre S.

Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 39: 178-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), and the solutions that disagreed with the known interactions were excluded. The optimal hydrogen bonds between ligands and α3β2 nAChR that are likely to contribute to the complex stability were predicted using the on-line server WHAT IF (32Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8 (29): 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3369) Google Scholar). α-CTX LtIA is a 16-amino acid C-terminally amidated peptide with four Cys residues (Table 1) (17Luo S. Zhangsun D. Zhang B. Quan Y. Wu Y. J. Pept. Sci. 2006; 12: 693-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Fmoc chemistry was used to synthesize the reduced peptide. In the initial synthesis, Cys side chains were protected with the acid-labile S-trityl group. Cleavage of the peptide from the resin simultaneously removed the S-trityl groups. Subsequently, Cys residues were air-oxidized in 1 m NH4HCO3, pH 7.5 buffer, containing 1 mm EDTA and purified by HPLC (Fig. 1A). With four Cys residues, there are three possible disulfide bond connectivities. Previously characterized α-conotoxins purified from venom typically have a disulfide bond connectivity linking the 1st Cys to the 3rd Cys and the 2nd Cys to the 4th Cys, which is referred to as the “globular” form to distinguish it from the alternative “ribbon” and “beads” connectivities (33Gehrmann J. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We therefore also synthesized α-CTX LtIA using a directed two-step folding. Cys pairs as found in native purified peptides were orthogonally protected using acid-labile S-trityl and acid-stable S-acetamidomethyl groups. Cleavage from the resin selectively removed the S-trityl groups, and the deprotected Cys residues were oxidized with potassium ferricyanide. After HPLC purification of the monocyclic peptide, acetamidomethyl groups were removed from the second Cys pair by treatment with iodine that also oxidized the peptide to form the second disulfide bond. The identity of the bicyclic peptide was confirmed by mass spectrometry, average calculated as follows: 1600.66 Da; observed 1600.4 Da. A co-elution experiment was performed with an ∼1:1 ratio of the major product of the one-step air oxidation and the major product of the two-step directed oxidation. As shown in Fig. 1B, the two products have identical elution profiles. Thus, the major product of the equilibrium air oxidation folding of the peptide has the disulfide bond configuration of native α-conotoxins. Synthetic peptide with this disulfide bond arrangement was used for all further analysis. LtIA lacks the conserved Ser-4 and Pro-6 of other α-conotoxins (see Table 1). Accordingly, as part of our study of native LtIA, we also synthesized and characterized one analog in which LtIA Ala-4 was replaced by Ser and another analog in which Ala-4 and Ala-6 of LtIA were replaced by Ser and Pro, respectively. t-Butoxycarbonyl chemistry/in situ neutralization protocol (34Schnölzer M. Alewood P. Jones A. Alewood D. Kent S.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1992; 40: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar) was used to synthesize the LtIA analogs. Syntheses were carried out on a 0.5 mmol scale with an overall coupling efficiency of >99.7%, as determined by quantitative ninhydrin tests. During assembly, the Cys side chains were protected with HF-labile methylbenzyl groups, which were removed upon cleavage. The reduced peptides were folded in 0.1 m NH4HCO3 buffer with 30% isopropyl alcohol, overnight at room temperature. For each analog, ESI-MS analysis showed a decrease in molecular mass by 4 Da, confirming the formation of two disulfide bonds. α-Conotoxins have been widely used as pharmacological tools to characterize nAChRs. The effects of α-CTX LtIA on different nAChRs heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes were analyzed. Fig. 2 shows representative responses to ACh of α3β2, α4β2, and α3β4 nAChRs in the presence and absence of α-CTX LtIA. Complete block of ACh-evoked currents was obtained with 1 μm α-CTX LtIA on α3β2 nAChRs (Fig. 2A) compared with little or no block of α4β2 (Fig. 2B) and α3β4 (Fig. 2C) nAChRs by 10 μm LtIA. The block of α3β2 nAChRs by LtIA is rapidly reversible (Fig. 2A). Concentration-response curves for α-CTX LtIA are shown in Fig. 3. α3β2 nAChRs were most potently blocked by α-CTX LtIA with an IC50 of 9.8 nm (Table 2). When a β4 rather than β2 nAChR subunit was co-expressed with the α3 subunit, the IC50 for α-CTX LtIA was >1000-fold higher, thus indicating that amino acid residue differences between the homologous β subunits significantly influence toxin potency. Likewise, LtIA was substantially less potent on α6/α3β4 versus α6/α3β2β3 nAChRs. In contrast, there was little or no block by LtIA at 10 μm LtIA on other nAChR subtypes, including α1β1δϵ, α2β2, α2β4, α4β2, α4β4, α7, and α9α10, (Table 2).FIGURE 3α-CTX LtIA concentration-response on native nAChR subtypes.

https://openalex.org/W1997582300,"Wnt signaling plays a key role in embryogenesis and cancer development. Dvl (Dishevelled) is a central mediator for both the canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathways. Dact1 (Dapper1, Dpr1), a Dvl interactor, has been shown to negatively modulate Wnt signaling by promoting lysosomal degradation of Dvl. Here we report that Dact1-deficient mice have multiple physiological defects that resemble the human neonate disease congenital caudal regression syndrome, including caudal vertebrae agenesis, anorectal malformation, renal agenesis/dysplasia, fused kidneys, and loss of bladder. These urogenital defects can be traced to impaired hindgut formation starting at embryonic day 8.25. Examination of morphological changes and Wnt target gene expression revealed that the planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling is deregulated, whereas the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is largely unaffected in mutant embryos. Consistently, the activity of the PCP signal mediators Rho GTPase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase is altered in Dact1(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We further observed alterations in the protein level and the cellular distribution of Dvl in the primitive streak of mutant embryos. An increased amount of Dvl2 tends to be accumulated in the cortical regions of the cells, especially at the primitive streak ectoderm close to the posterior endoderm that lately forms the hindgut diverticulum. Together, these data suggest that Dact1 may regulate vertebrate PCP by controlling the level and the cellular localization of Dvl protein."

The regulation of FXII expression is largely unknown. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is a multifunctional cytokine that has been linked to several pathological processes, including tissue fibrosis by modulating procoagulant and fibrinolytic activities. This study investigated whether TGF-β1 may regulate FXII expression in human lung fibroblasts. Treatment of human lung fibroblasts with TGF-β1 resulted in a time-dependent increase in FXII production, activation of p44/42, p38, JNK, and Akt, and phosphorylation and translocation into the nucleus of Smad3. However, TGF-β1-induced FXII expression was repressed only by the JNK inhibitor and JNK and Smad3 antisense oligonucleotides but not by MEK, p38, or phosphoinositide 3-kinase blockers. JNK inhibition had no effect on TGF-β1-induced Smad3 phosphorylation, association with Smad4, and its translocation into the nucleus but strongly suppressed Smad3-DNA complex formation. FXII promoter analysis revealed that the −299/+1 region was sufficient for TGF-β1 to induce FXII expression. Sequence analysis of this region detected a potential Smad-binding element at position −272/−269 (SBE-(−272/−269)).

https://openalex.org/W2075232516,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during cellular metabolism are toxic to cells. As a result, cells must be able to identify ROS as a stress signal and induce stress response pathways that protect cells from ROS toxicity. Recently, peroxiredoxin (Prx)-induced relays of disulfide bond formation have been identified in budding yeast, namely the disulfide bond formation of Yap1, a crucial transcription factor for oxidative stress response, by a specific Prx Gpx3 and by a major Prx Tsa1. Here, we show that an atypical-type Prx Ahp1 can act as a receptor for alkylhydroperoxides, resulting in activation of the Cad1 transcription factor that is homologous to Yap1. We demonstrate that Ahp1 is required for the formation of intermolecular Cad1 disulfide bond(s) in both an in vitro redox system and in cells treated with alkylhydroperoxide. Furthermore, we found that Cad1-dependent transcriptional activation of the HSP82 gene is dependent on Ahp1. Our results suggest that, although the Gpx3-Yap1 pathway contributes more strongly to resistance than the Ahp1-Cad1 pathway, the Ahp1-induced activation of Cad1 can function as a defense system against stress induced by alkylhydroperoxides, possibly including lipid peroxides.

CHO1 alleles bearing Ser46 → Ala and/or Ser47 → Ala mutations were constructed and expressed in a cho1Δ mutant lacking phosphatidylserine synthase. In vitro, the S46A/S47A mutation reduced the total amount of phosphorylation by 90% and abolished the inhibitory effect protein kinase A had on phosphatidylserine synthase activity. The enzyme phosphorylation by protein kinase A, which was time- and dose-dependent and dependent on the concentration of ATP, caused a electrophoretic mobility shift from a 27-kDa form to a 30-kDa form. The two electrophoretic forms of phosphatidylserine synthase were present in exponential phase cells, whereas only the 27-kDa form was present in stationary phase cells. In vivo labeling with 32Pi and immune complex analysis showed that the 30-kDa form was predominantly phosphorylated when compared with the 27-kDa form. However, the S46A/S47A mutations abolished the protein kinase A-mediated electrophoretic mobility shift. The S46A/S47A mutations also caused a 55% reduction in the total amount of phosphatidylserine synthase in exponential phase cells and a 66% reduction in the amount of enzyme in stationary phase cells. In phospholipid composition analysis, cells expressing the S46A/S47A mutant enzyme exhibited a 57% decrease in phosphatidylserine and a 40% increase in phosphatidylinositol. These results indicate that phosphatidylserine synthase is phosphorylated on Ser46 and Ser47 by protein kinase A, which results in a higher amount of enzyme for the net effect of stimulating the synthesis of phosphatidylserine.

In vivo labeling with 32Pi and immune complex analysis showed that the 30-kDa form was predominantly phosphorylated when compared with the 27-kDa form. However, the S46A/S47A mutations abolished the protein kinase A-mediated electrophoretic mobility shift. The S46A/S47A mutations also caused a 55% reduction in the total amount of phosphatidylserine synthase in exponential phase cells and a 66% reduction in the amount of enzyme in stationary phase cells. In phospholipid composition analysis, cells expressing the S46A/S47A mutant enzyme exhibited a 57% decrease in phosphatidylserine and a 40% increase in phosphatidylinositol. These results indicate that phosphatidylserine synthase is phosphorylated on Ser46 and Ser47 by protein kinase A, which results in a higher amount of enzyme for the net effect of stimulating the synthesis of phosphatidylserine."
https://openalex.org/W1988646383,"γ-Secretase is a ubiquitous, multiprotein enzyme composed of presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2. It mediates the intramembrane proteolysis of many type 1 proteins, plays an essential role in numerous signaling pathways, and helps drive the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease by excising the hydrophobic, aggregation-prone amyloid β-peptide from the β-amyloid precursor protein. A central unresolved question is how its many substrates bind and enter the γ-secretase complex. Here, we provide evidence that both the β-amyloid precursor protein holoprotein and its C-terminal fragments, the immediate substrates of γ-secretase, can associate with Aph-1 at overexpressed as well as endogenous protein levels. This association was observed using bi-directional co-immunoprecipitation in multiple systems and detergent conditions, and an β-amyloid precursor protein-Aph-1 complex was specifically isolated following in situ cross-linking in living cells. In addition, another endogenous canonical γ-substrate, Jagged, showed association of both its full-length and C-terminal fragment forms with Aph-1. We were also able to demonstrate that this interaction with substrates was conserved across the multiple isoforms of Aph-1 (β, αS, and αL), as they were all able to bind β-amyloid precursor protein with similar affinity. Finally, two highly conserved intramembrane histidines (His-171 and His-197) within Aph-1, which were recently shown to be important for γ-secretase activity, are required for efficient binding of substrates. Taken together, our data suggest a dominant role for Aph-1 in interacting with γ-secretase substrates prior to their processing by the proteolytic complex. γ-Secretase is a ubiquitous, multiprotein enzyme composed of presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2.

https://openalex.org/W2088761032,"Insulin-induced gene 2 (INSIG2) and its homolog INSIG1 encode closely related endoplasmic reticulum proteins that regulate the proteolytic activation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins, transcription factors that activate the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids in animal cells. Several studies have been carried out to identify INSIG2 genetic variants associated with metabolic diseases. However, few data have been published regarding the regulation of INSIG2 gene expression. Two Insig2 transcripts have been described in rodents through the use of different promoters that produce different noncoding first exons that splice into a common second exon. Herein we report the cloning and characterization of the human INSIG2 promoter and the detection of an INSIG2-specific transcript homologous to the Insig2b mouse variant in human liver. Deletion analyses on 3 kb of 5'-flanking DNA of the human INSIG2 gene revealed the functional importance of a 350-bp region upstream of the transcription start site. Mutated analyses, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, and RNA interference analyses unveiled the significance of an Ets-consensus motif in the proximal region and the interaction of the Ets family member SAP1a (serum response factor (SRF) accessory protein-1a) with this region of the human INSIG2 promoter. Moreover, our findings suggest that insulin activated the human INSIG2 promoter in a process mediated by phosphorylated SAP1a. Overall, these results map the functional elements in the human INSIG2 promoter sequence and suggest an unexpected regulation of INSIG2 gene expression in human liver."
https://openalex.org/W1972491811,"The ATPase activity of the maltose transporter (MalFGK(2)) is dependent on interactions with the maltose-binding protein (MBP). To determine whether direct interactions between the translocated sugar and MalFGK(2) are important for the regulation of ATP hydrolysis, we used an MBP mutant (sMBP) that is able to bind either maltose or sucrose. We observed that maltose- and sucrose-bound sMBP stimulate equal levels of MalFGK(2) ATPase activity. Therefore, the ATPase activity of MalFGK(2) is coupled to translocation of maltose solely by interactions between MalFGK(2) and MBP. For both maltose and sucrose, the ability of sMBP to stimulate the MalFGK(2) ATPase was greatly reduced compared with wild-type MBP, indicating that the mutations in sMBP have interfered with important interactions between MBP and MalFGK(2). High resolution crystal structure analysis of sMBP shows that in the closed conformation with bound sucrose, three of four mutations are buried, and the fourth causes only a minor change in the accessible surface. In contrast, in the open form of sMBP, all of the mutations are accessible, and the main chain of Tyr(62)-Gly(69) is destabilized and occupies an alternative conformation due to the W62Y mutation. On this basis, the compromised ability of sMBP to stimulate ATP hydrolysis by MalFGK(2) is most likely due to a disruption of interactions between MalFGK(2) and the open, rather than the closed, conformation of sMBP. Modeling the open sMBP structure bound to MalFGK(2) in the transition state for ATP hydrolysis points to an important site of interaction and suggests a mechanism for coupling ATP hydrolysis to substrate translocation that is independent of the exact structure of the substrate."

Thus, capsaicin functions as a partial agonist for hTRPV1 but a full agonist for the rat receptor. An elevation of temperature or local acidity can in principle augment the efficacies of partial agonists, transforming them from weakly or non-pain-producing ligands into noxious chemicals (16Olah Z.

Thus, pain sensation arising from TRPV1 activation by chemical agonists in humans could conceivably be different from that in rodents, the model species frequently used in biomedical research.Besides its involvement in pain sensation, TRPV1 displays a low level of activity at normal body temperature (18Gavva N.R.

Constitutive activity of TRPV1 is essential for regulation of body temperature, evidenced by high fever as a perilous side effect of many TRPV1 blockers during clinical trials for their efficacy in management or prophylaxis of pain (19Gavva N.R.

Modulators of TRPV1 basal activity and their sites of action are largely unknown; far less known is the variation of basal activities among species in which TRPV1 has been characterized. TRPV1 is a homotetrameric ion channel (20Kedei N. Szabo T. Lile J.D. Treanor J.J. Olah Z. Iadarola M.J. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol.

Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (6943) Google Scholar). Earlier work suggests that capsaicin binds to the region between the second and the third transmembrane helices to gate TRPV1 (22Jordt S.E. Julius D. Cell. 2002; 108: 421-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). The region between the fifth and the sixth transmembrane segments, including a putative pore loop, forms the ion permeation pathway (23Owsianik G. Talavera K. Voets T. Nilius B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2006; 68: 685-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Several negatively charged amino acid residues in the pore have been shown to be important for sensitization or activation of TRPV1 by cations, particularly protons and magnesium (11Ahern G.P. Brooks I.M. Miyares R.L. Wang X.B. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5109-5116Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 24Jordt S.E. Tominaga M. Julius D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 8134-8139Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Because of its therapeutic implication, a better understanding of how hTRPV1 opens in response to the extracellular ionic milieu is important. Notably, both protons and magnesium enhance the efficacy of capsaicin as an agonist for hTRPV1. Given its overall similar topological structure and a high percentage of identity (86%) at the amino acid sequence level to rTRPV1, we identified the structural determinants that allow these two ions to specifically sensitize the human receptor. We found that the stimulatory effects of protons and magnesium on fully liganded hTRPV1 require different modular domains. The first four transmembrane segments (TM1–4) of TRPV1 dictate whether the activity of a fully capsaicin-bound receptor can be further enhanced by protons, and a glutamate residue (Glu-536) in the linker between TM3 and TM4 of hTRPV1 is critical in the modulation by protons. TM5–6 of TRPV1 determines the species difference in magnesium modulation of both saturating capsaicin-induced currents and ligand-independent basal currents. A concerted action of the capsaicin-binding domain and the permeation pathway converges at the final stage of hTRPV1 opening.DISCUSSIONTRPV1 is the principal transduction channel modulating the excitability of pain-sensing neurons in vertebrate species. Although TRPV1s from all species sense noxious heat and tissue acidosis, the repertoire of chemical agonists for each species homologues displays substantial variability (22Jordt S.E. Julius D.

Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The efficacies of capsaicin as well as other small organic TRPV1 agonists are both species- and microenvironment-dependent (13Ross R.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 140: 790-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 17Sprague J. Harrison C. Rowbotham D.J. Smart D. Lambert D.G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 423: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It is therefore relevant to elucidate the molecular basis of differential sensitivity to chemical ligands or integration mechanisms between different modalities for a full appreciation of the protective and incapacitating aspects of pain sensation in physiological or pathological settings.The similarity between human and rat TRPV1 at the primary sequence level is remarkable. The glutamate residue near the pore loop (Glu-600) responsible for enhancement of agonist potency of capsaicin is functionally conserved among species. One might expect the existence of some titratable amino acid residues unique to the human receptor accounting for proton modulation of agonist efficacy of capsaicin. However, we identified a conserved Glu-536 as the critical residue for proton stimulation of capsaicin efficacy in hTRPV1. Rather than losing its ability to be properly activated by capsaicin due to nonspecific perturbation of the overall structure of the TM1–4 domain, the hE536Q mutant channel behaves as a fully protonated wild type hTRPV1 channel. In support of this view, hE536Q has higher apparent affinity for capsaicin and shows higher channel open probability at saturating concentrations of capsaicin, mimicking a wild type hTRPV1 channel in an acidic environment (pH 6.4). However, the Glu-536 residue is also present in the rat receptor that shows no change in capsaicin efficacy by acidic pH. One possible explanation is that channel open probability of rTRPV1 by capsaicin has already reached its maximum within the voltage range of our recordings so that it is impossible to further enhance the rat receptor current with any positive modulators. As long as saturating capsaicin is present, for membrane potential higher than −60 mV, rat TRPV1 open probability does not even increase in response to voltage increments, a highly effective gating factor for TRPV1 in general. Given that rTRPV1 activated by anandamide can still be potentiated by acidic pH at saturating concentrations of this agonist (13Ross R.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 140: 790-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 16Olah Z. Karai L. Iadarola M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31163-31170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), titration of the Glu-536 residue of the rat receptor may play a role in facilitating channel opening by much lower efficacy agonists, such as anandamide or oxidative lipids.Previous studies indicate that at the transition between TM3 and the intracellular loop (TM2–3 linker), amino acid residues, including the Tyr-511 and Ser-512, are critical for capsaicin gating of the channel (22Jordt S.E. Julius D. Cell. 2002; 108: 421-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that an amino acid (hGlu-536) within the extracellular loop (linker between TM3 and TM4) serves as a molecular switch to increase the open probability of ligand-bound human receptors. This linker, although short, constrains the structure of the TM1–4 domain of TRPV1 to impact its function significantly. Amino acid substitutions within this linker had been shown to obliterate the activation of TRPV1 by extremely acidic pH, even if the residues involved are not directly titratable by protons (27Ryu S. Liu B. Yao J. Fu Q. Qin F. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 12797-12807Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although modulatory effects of magnesium on human TRPV1 phenocopy those of protons in both the polarity and the magnitude, immediate sites of actions of these two cations are different. The stimulatory effect of magnesium is associated with pore domains in chimeras. Primary sequences of TRPV1 pore regions among species are even more conserved than other parts of the receptor, the only variation being a small hypervariable segment connecting the distal end of TM5 helix and the completely conserved “pore” loop. This segment likely contributes to refining the positions of several previously identified amino acid residues implicated in magnesium activation of TRPV1 by affecting its binding. The ligand-independent basal currents of TRPV1 from both species variants are stimulated by magnesium. However, there is a significant quantitative difference between human and rat receptors. In contrast, protons stimulate basal currents of both receptors to a similar level.Multimodal gating is an essential feature of TRP channels. Here, we demonstrated protons and magnesium can further stimulate fully capsaicin-bound hTRPV1 through actions on distinct structures. Various kinetic paradigms have been proposed to explain the generalized gating of the thermo-sensitive transient receptor potential channels (31Voets T. Droogmans G. Wissenbach U. Janssens A. Flockerzi V. Nilius B. Nature. 2004; 430: 748-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 32Matta J.A. Ahern G.P. J. Physiol. 2007; 585: 469-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 33Latorre R. Brauchi S. Orta G. Zaelzer C. Vargas G.

U.S.A. 2004; 101: 15494-15499Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). These models likely will need refinements when more structural or biochemical data become available to correlate with proposed functional states. These models can be quantitatively adjusted to explain differential capsaicin sensitivity of TRPV1 from different species. For example, the efficacy of capsaicin as a TRPV1 agonist is lower for the human receptor than the rat receptor. This is not because capsaicin fails to bind hTRPV1 as well as rTRPV1, as EC50 values of capsaicin for both channels are similar. Instead, capsaicin-binding processes are comparable between hTRPV1 and rTRPV1, but hTRPV1 channel is harder to open. It can be due to either a higher energetic barrier for hTRPV1 to open or because of less efficient coupling between binding and gating in hTRPV1. When we inspect the G-V curves of wild type and mutant channels in this study, it is obvious that maximal left shifts of these curves by capsaicin are determined by the entirety of all six transmembrane segments but not the further subdivided TM1–4 ligand-binding or TM5–6 ion-permeating domain alone. The chimeric channels, no matter with transfer of the TM1–4 capsaicin-binding domain or the TM5–6 pore domain, have the G-V curves fall between the boundaries defined by the two wild type receptors. However, if we compare the pair with the same TM1–6 segments, e.g. the hTRPV1-rTM5–6 and rTRPV1-hTM1–4, they actually have very close V½ values for G-V curves. The human receptor has a TM1–4 domain harder to open by capsaicin. Only by substitution of the Glu-536 residue with a neutral amino acid in hTRPV1, an equivalent of titration of Glu-536 residues in all four channel subunits, can the mutant channel reach the V½ value comparable with the chimeric channels containing rat TM1–4 domain, and it acquires resistance to proton modulation. A reduced model where temperature and chemical agonists are treated as gating modifiers to shift the intrinsic voltage-dependent gate of the TRPV1 channel cannot accommodate all the data we obtained without further assumptions (31Voets T. Droogmans G. Wissenbach U. Janssens A. Flockerzi V. Nilius B. Nature. 2004; 430: 748-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Different positive regulators of TRPV1 gating must operate independently so that when one of them reaches its maximal capacity of modulation, the rest of them can still further increase channel opening (32Matta J.A. Ahern G.P. J. Physiol. 2007; 585: 469-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 33Latorre R. Brauchi S. Orta G. Zaelzer C. Vargas G. Cell Calcium. 2007; 42: 427-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 34Brauchi S. Orio P. Latorre R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 15494-15499Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). One apparent example is the hTRPV1 E536Q mutant, although protons essentially have no effect on full dose capsaicin-activated currents, an increase in transmembrane voltage still leads to further channel opening. It is expected that for each TRPV1 receptor, wild type or mutants, there must be an upper limit for channel openings even with all possible activators present simultaneously. This upper limit of probability for channel opening may differ from one construct to another. However, a common principle will hold for all kinds of TRPV1 channels that the relative receptor potentiation by a modulator gets smaller when other positive regulators are already present, illustrated by a reduction of Mg2+ effects on proton-potentiated hTRPV1. At the other extreme, one can also view capsaicin as an exceptionally strong activator for rodent receptors. Pepper plants acquire the ability to synthesize this powerful agonist for survival in their ecological niches during evolution. Being an effective deterrent against rodents, capsaicin does not require any other positive regulators to maximally activate rat TRPV1. It is thus tempting to hypothesize that different sensors for agonistic stimuli (capsaicin, heat, protons, and magnesium) are contained in different structural motifs. Although the physical natures of these sensors are currently unknown, our site mapping work will provide some candidate regions to examine once the high resolution structures of TRPV1 are available.It is worth noting that protons have more complex effects on the capsaicin activation of human TRPV1 than that of rat TRPV1, a property attributable to relatively weak activation of hTRPV1 by capsaicin, namely partial agonism. A lower efficacy of capsaicin on human TRPV1 allows us to appreciate Nature's design of a signal integrator. Although most physiological activators, including elevation of extracellular acidity, excitatory cations, and endogenous agonists, are all weak activators of TRPV1, synergism of these stimuli can broaden the sensory dimensions of an injury-detecting receptor. Execution of the stimulatory effects through different structural domains of the sensor molecule increases the coding complexity and dynamic range of different categories of signal inputs and its overall efficiency in final receptor activation, particularly when all the stimuli are sub-threshold. This is exemplified in human TRPV1 by a plethora of interactions of protons and magnesium ions on the capsaicin-activated currents, the former through the Glu-600 residue near the pore and the Glu-536 residue in the linker between TM3 and TM4, as well as the latter acting within the pore. It will be interesting to determine whether the same principle also applied to other endogenously produced TRPV1 agonists with even less efficacy compared with capsaicin.

In contrast, extracellular acidification can enhance only the human receptor currents when capsaicin is applied at a concentration higher than 10 μm (15Hayes P. Meadows H.J. Gunthorpe M.J.

Thus, capsaicin functions as a partial agonist for hTRPV1 but a full agonist for the rat receptor. An elevation of temperature or local acidity can in principle augment the efficacies of partial agonists, transforming them from weakly or non-pain-producing ligands into noxious chemicals (16Olah Z. Karai L. Iadarola M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31163-31170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 17Sprague J. Harrison C. Rowbotham D.J. Smart D. Lambert D.G. Eur. J.

Thus, pain sensation arising from TRPV1 activation by chemical agonists in humans could conceivably be different from that in rodents, the model species frequently used in biomedical research.Besides its involvement in pain sensation, TRPV1 displays a low level of activity at normal body temperature (18Gavva N.R.

In Drosophila, we show here that a single stathmin gene (stai) encodes a family of D-stathmin proteins. Two of the D-stathmins are maternally deposited and then restricted to germ cells, and the other two are detected in the nervous system during embryo development. Like in vertebrates, the nervous system-enriched stathmins contain an N-terminal domain involved in subcellular targeting. All the D-stathmins possess a domain containing three or four predicted TBRs, and we demonstrate here, using complementary biochemical and biophysical methods, that all four predicted TBR domains actually bind tubulin. D-stathmins can indeed bind up to four tubulins, the resulting complex being directly visualized by electron microscopy. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the presence of regulated multiple tubulin sites is a conserved characteristic of stathmins in invertebrates and allows us to predict key residues in stathmin for the binding of tubulin.

Microtubules are key elements of the cytoskeleton involved in the cell cycle, cell shape, and intracellular organization and trafficking. They are composed of α/β-tubulin heterodimers, which are assembled or disassembled through phases of slow growth or rapid shrinkage separated by catastrophe and rescue events (30Mitchison T.

To decipher the in vivo roles of stathmin proteins and their important features conserved through evolution, we previously identified a unique stathmin-related gene (stai) in Drosophila predicted to code for at least two transcripts (46Ozon S. Guichet A. Gavet O. Roth S. Sobel A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 698-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The D-stathmin gene is expressed in germ cells and in the nervous system of the developing Drosophila embryos, and its role in tubulin sequestration is conserved. However the determinants of tubulin interaction in D-stathmin were not characterized, and its stoichiometry was not quantitatively analyzed. A striking physiological role of D-stathmins was revealed following RNA knockdown in Drosophila embryos, which resulted in germ cell migration defects as well as a major disorganization of nervous system development (46Ozon S. Guichet A. Gavet O. Roth S. Sobel A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 698-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that the single Drosophila stathmin gene codes for a family of four different D-stathmin proteins whose expression patterns are regulated during development. The stathmin gene is conserved in invertebrates and codes for isoforms with tubulin binding stoichiometries that are variable, higher than in vertebrates, and regulated by alternative splicing. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis allowed us to show the specificity of each tubulin binding region and predict key residues for the binding of tubulin.

All cDNA constructs were checked by sequencing (Genome express, Meylan, France). tubulin binding repeat double-stranded RNA 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol stathmin-like domain. 1 μg of pSp64 plasmid containing D-stathmin A1, B1, and B2 coding sequences was used for in vitro transcription and translation with the TnTTM Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega). 5 μl of 25 μl of total transcription/translation mix were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. h-stathmin was purified as previously described (32Curmi P.A.

The PET- 8C and the pDW363 cDNA clones were used to produce and purify the corresponding D-stathmin derivatives in the BL-21(DE3) Escherichia coli strain as described previously (42Jourdain I. Lachkar S. Charbaut E. Gigant B. Knossow M. Sobel A. Curmi P.A. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 877-888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Drosophila tissues were homogenized in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). S2R+ RNA was prepared using the RNeasy Minikit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Northern blots were performed as described (46Ozon S. Guichet A. Gavet O. Roth S. Sobel A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 698-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Multiprime-labeled fragments of PCR-amplified probes 1′-2′, 3-4-5, and 1-2 were added at 0.5 × 106 cpm/ml in the hybridization buffer, and hybridization was allowed to proceed overnight. The final wash was performed at 60 °C in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min. Reverse transcription-PCRs were performed on 1 μg of template RNA using 20 pmol of dT oligonucleotides, 1 h at 42 °C, with the ImProm-IITM reverse transcription system (Promega) followed by a PCR using appropriate oligonucleotides (1′, gagagctcgaggaaaccgtccgcgatataa; 7, ttgctaagctttgtgttggtgtattatgca; and 1, cattcgcttaattttcgccgacgacgcg). Templates for in vitro transcription were generated by PCR using the following pairs of oligonucleotides containing the sequence recognized by the T7 RNA polymerase: gagaattctaatacgactcactatagggagaaacacaatcaaaattgccgaaatcaaa and gagaattctaatacgactcactatagggagagagtttttgaactttttcaatttttttttgc, and gagaattctaatacgactcactatagggagaattgagcagaaacttaaggcggcc and gagaattctaatacgactcactatagggagacgtcttttcgatatcctgggcatg, to amplify exon 6 and exons 3-4-5, respectively. The corresponding double strand RNAs (dsRNAs) were then synthesized using the MEGAscript kit (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 37 nm of dsRNA was added to a 35-mm well culture plate containing 106 S2R+ cells in Schneider medium without serum, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min after vigorous shaking. 2 ml of Schneider medium containing 10% serum was then added, and the cells were further grown for 3 or 7 days before analysis by Western blot. RNA in situ hybridization was performed as described before (48Tautz D. Pfeifle C. Chromosoma. 1989; 98: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar). Briefly, regions 1-2, 1′-2′, and 6 were PCR-amplified with 3′ oligonucleotides containing the sequence of the initiation of the T7 phage polymerase to directly synthesize digoxygenin-UTP-labeled RNA. Fixed embryos were hybridized with digoxygenin-UTP-labeled RNA overnight at 55 °C and then incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxygenin antibodies. The signal was developed using the alkaline phosphatase reaction. For examination, embryos were mounted in Aqua-Polymount (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA). One-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed on 12% BisTris polyacrylamide gels (NuPAGE, Invitrogen). The gels were transferred to nitrocellulose in a semi-dry electroblotting apparatus and probed with diluted antiserum (anti-peptide COOH-terminal antiserum 98 (1:10,000), anti-D-stathmin-DC antiserum 97 (1:10,000), or anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (1:2,000, Dako, A/S, Denmark)). Bound antibodies were detected with appropriate secondary antibodies and the chemiluminescent ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences), or by fluorescence (Odyssey, Li-COR Biosciences, Bad Homburg, Germany). Human HeLa cells were grown as monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Transfections were performed using FuGENE (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were fixed with phosphate-buffered saline plus 2% paraformaldehyde and 30 mm saccharose for 10 min at 37 °C. Primary antibodies (monoclonal anti-α-tubulin N356, 1:300, Amersham Biosciences; polyclonal anti-Myc sc-789, 1:100, Tebu, Le Perray en Yvelines, France) were revealed with appropriate Alexa 488, 546-conjugated anti-rabbit (1:300) and anti-mouse (1:300) secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The cells were mounted with Mowiol solution and examined with a Provis Olympus fluorescence photomicroscope equipped with a Princeton Instruments camera. Tubulin was purified from calf brain as described before (32Curmi P.A. Andersen S.S. Lachkar S. Gavet O. Karsenti E. Knossow M. Sobel A. J. Biol.

The effect of various D-stathmin variants or fragments on tubulin polymerization in polymerization buffer (50 mm 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid-KOH, pH 6.8, 30% glycerol, 0.5 mm EGTA, 6 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm GTP) was monitored turbidimetrically at 350 nm in an Ultrospec 3000 spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences) thermostatted at 37 °C as described before (41Charbaut E. Curmi P.A. Ozon S. Lachkar S. Redeker V. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16146-16154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Tubulin alone and h-stathmin were used as controls, with the results for D-stathmins being normalized on the basis of a 2:1 tubulin:h-stathmin reference ratio. The interaction of the D-stathmin derivatives with tubulin was studied by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column pre-equilibrated with buffer AB (80 mm Pipes/KOH/1 mm EGTA/5 mm MgCl2, pH 6.8) containing 1 m trimethylamine-N-oxide at 0.5 ml/min. Monitoring at 278 nm allowed us to observe the tubulin peaks mainly, because D-stathmin derivatives do not significantly absorb light at this wavelength. The interaction was favored by the addition of 1 m trimethylamine-N-oxide to the sample and elution buffers as previously described (42Jourdain I. Lachkar S. Charbaut E. Gigant B. Knossow M. Sobel A. Curmi P.A. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 877-888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BIAcore 2000 system, Sensorchip SA, and HBS buffer (0.01 m Hepes (pH 7.4)/0.15 m NaCl/3 mm EDTA/0.005% polyoxyethylenesorbitan) were from BIAcore AB (Uppsala, Sweden). The Sensorchip SA coated with streptavidin was preconditioned with three 10-μl injections of 50 mm NaOH, 1 m NaCl, and saturated with three 10-μl injections of 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The first flow cell was used as a reference flow cell. The other three flow cells were coupled with the dialyzed S2 of the various D-stathmin derivatives that were specifically biotinylated on their NH2-terminal tag. To obtain surfaces with comparable molar densities, the amounts of the various proteins coupled were proportional to their molecular masses: ∼2000 resonance units of h-stathmin, 900 resonance units of TBR 1–2, and 370 resonance units of D-stathmin A1 were coupled at 10-μl/min in HBS buffer. Several runs of tubulin ranging from 0.5 to 10 μm were made at a constant flow rate of 30 μl/min, in buffer AB (80 mm Pipes/KOH/1 mm EGTA/5 mm MgCl2, pH 6.8) supplemented with 0.005% (v/v) P20 surfactant in the presence of 1 mm GDP. For the analysis, the reference flow cell sensorgram was subtracted from the corresponding sensorgrams. Samples for glycerol spraying/low angle rotary metal shadowing were prepared as described (34Honnappa S. Cutting B. Jahnke W. Seelig J. Steinmetz M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38926-38934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 37Steinmetz M.O. Kammerer R.A. Jahnke W. Goldie K.N. Lustig A. van Oostrum J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 572-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μl of protein samples (0.1–0.3 mg/ml) were mixed with glycerol to a final concentration of 30%, sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica at room temperature, and rotary shadowed in a BA 511M freeze-etch apparatus (Balzers) with platinum/carbon at an elevation angle of 3–5°. Electron micrographs were taken in a Philips Morgagni transmission electron microscope operated at 80 kV equipped with a Megaview III charge-coupled device camera. The electron micrographs were used to calculate the length of the tubulin complexes formed with various stathmin constructs. If t is the length of the uncoated αβ-tubulin heterodimer, and e is the thickness of the platinum coating, the length of a coated tubulin heterodimer is T = t + 2e, and that of a platinum-coated T2S complex is T2 = 2t + 2e. Hence t = T2 − T, and e = (T − t)/2. With T = 17.5 nm, T2 = 28 nm, we found t = 10.5 nm, and e = 3.5 nm. One can then deduce from the measurements of the curved lengths (L) of the coated tubulin complexes the length (l) of the corresponding naked complexes: l = L − 2e = L − 7 nm. To identify all stathmin sequences at the mRNA and genomic level, we ran the TBLASTN or BLASTN software on expressed sequence tag, non-redundant (nr), and genomic GenBankTM libraries using the D-stathmin A1, A2, B1, and B2 nucleotidic or amino acid sequences, as well as each individual exon as the query. In most vertebrates, the six identified tubulin binding stathmin family proteins, stathmin (stathmin 1, St 1) and the mostly or exclusively neural proteins SCG10 (stathmin 2, St 2), SCLIP (stathmin 3, St 3), RB3 and its splice variants RB3′ and RB3″ (stathmin 4a, St 4a; stathmin 4b, St 4b; and stathmin 4c, St 4c), are encoded by four conserved genes (stmn1–4) (Fig. 1A). In Drosophila, a single stathmin gene (stai) (Fig. 1B) has been identified that we partially characterized previously (46Ozon S. Guichet A. Gavet O. Roth S. Sobel A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 698-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As deduced from expressed sequence tag sequences analysis, we now further identified exon 1′ between exons 2 and 2′, which corresponds to an alternate transcription initiation (Fig. 1C) (see below and under “Experimental Procedures”), and exon 6 that can be alternatively spliced out. For a systematic identification of all stai gene products, we performed reverse transcription-PCR using PCR primer couples targeting either exons 1 and 7 or 1′ and 7 (Fig. 2A). Altogether, four different D-stathmin mRNAs were identified which differ either by transcription initiation (exons 1-2 or 1′-2′) or by alternate splicing (of exons 1′-2′ and 6). D-stathmins A1 and A2 are corresponding to exons 1-2-3-4-5-6-7 and exons 1-2-3-4-5-7, and D-stathmin B1 and B2 to exons 1′-2′-3-4-5-6-7 and exons 1′-2′-3-4-5-7, respectively (Fig. 1C). The corresponding proteins share a stathmin-like domain (SLD) (41Charbaut E. Curmi P.A. Ozon S. Lachkar S. Redeker V. Sobel A. J. Biol.

Exons 1′-2′ encode an N-terminal extension in D-stathmins B (Figs. 1C and 5A). Exon 1′ codes for a sequence with no significant identity with the N-terminal targeting domain A of vertebrate neural stathmins 2–4 (Fig. 1D) (18Gavet O. El Messari S. Ozon S. Sobel A. J. Neurosci.

https://openalex.org/W2043559237,"The Agabus bipustulatus complex includes one of Europe's most widely distributed and common diving beetles. This complex, which is known for its large morphological variation, has a complex demographic and altitudinal variation in elytral reticulation. The various depth of the reticulation imprint, both in smaller and larger meshes, results in both mat and shiny individuals, as well as intermediate forms. The West Palearctic lowland is inhabited by a sexually dimorphic form, with shiny males and mat females. In mountain regions, shiny individuals of both sexes are found intermixed with mat individuals or in pure populations in central and southern areas, whereas pure populations of mat individuals are exclusively found in the northern region at high altitude. Sexual selection is proposed as a driving force in shaping this variation. However, the occurrence of different types of reticulation in both sexes and disjunct geographical distribution patterns suggest an additional function of the reticulation. Here we investigate the phylogeographical history, genetic structure and reticulation variation of several named forms within the Agabus bipustulatus complex including A. nevadensis. The molecular analyses recognised several well-supported clades within the complex. Several of the named forms had two or more independent origins. Few south European populations were uniform in reticulation patterns, and the males were found to display large variation. Reticulation diversity and population genetic variability were clearly correlated to altitude, but no genetic differences were detected among populations with mixed or homogenous forms. Observed reduction in secondary reticulation in female and increased variance in male at high altitude in South Europe may be explained by the occurrence of an additional selective force, beside sexual selection. The combined effect of these selective processes is here demonstrated in an extreme case to generate isolation barriers between populations at high altitudes. Here we discuss this selective force in relation to thermal selection."

Given the continued need for human eggs for hESCs, this article analyzes and refutes the legal theories against compensating research egg donors, contrasts the legal histories of compensating reproductive donors and human subjects with noncompensation for ESC donors, and suggests that limited compensation is legally defensible. With a change of administrations in the United States and renewed support for human embryonic stem cell (hESC) research, there may be an opportunity to reassess the legal principles and theories involved in payments to research egg donors in this country and to consider how the legal system might impact this ongoing debate. In this rapidly moving field, many observers and some researchers have argued that developments in both adult stem cell research and more recently induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) research should obviate the need for donated research eggs. However, adult stem cells have already-recognized limitations and the jury is still very much out as to whether iPSCs will ever replace hESCs in terms of clinical potential. Moreover, each of these research paths carries the potential of enhancing advances in the other areas and in understanding early human development, indicating that there is a continued need for donated research eggs (Cibelli, 2009Cibelli J. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 345-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Anecdotally, the present dearth in research egg donors has been repeatedly traced to an inability to compensate them. One recent study of reproductive donors found that most of these individuals were interested in donating for embryonic research, but only 2% were willing to do so without compensation (Klitzman and Sauer, 2009Klitzman R. Sauer M.V. Reprod. Biomed. Online. 2009; 18: 603-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although the legal issues should be of worldwide interest, given the range of international laws and policies, this article is limited to a discussion of compensating research egg donors within the United States. It reviews both the legal background in the United States and various legal arguments that have been made regarding compensation for egg donation and then suggests the viability of a legal defense for modest compensation to research egg donors under the same protections and principles applied to other human research subjects. With few exceptions (such as the 2009 decision by New York state's Empire State Stem Cell Board to allow research donor compensation), current compensation practices for research egg donors stand in stark contrast to such policies for both healthy human research subjects and reproductive egg donors. Policies prohibiting donor payments or permitting research use of only “spare” IVF embryos have been incorporated into otherwise pro-hESC research legislation and voluntary restrictions by professional organizations. These restrictions codify into law or guidelines ideological perspectives that may lack objectivity, scientific acumen, or the flexibility needed to adapt to anticipated advances in this fast emerging and promising field. From a legal perspective, the discussion should be about how best to protect these healthy human subjects through established protocols, rather than how to appease opponents of hESC research through restrictive statutory provisions. Generally speaking, the law attempts to shape behavior both prospectively by enacting statutes and guidelines and creating entities such as licensing bodies to address certain behaviors set out by those acts and by making courts available to individuals and the government to redress actions that allegedly offend those laws or existing theories of constitutional, criminal, tort, or contract law. Both approaches are relevant in the arena of payments to research egg donors, and any legal defense of compensating research egg donors must recognize the existing paradigms and theories that currently impact this issue. Opponents of compensating research egg donors suggest that paying these women is coercive, unduly influences poor or otherwise vulnerable women to put themselves at risk, and commodifies eggs and that it is simply wrong to “create life to destroy it.” However, none of these arguments withstand careful legal scrutiny. Legally speaking, coercion occurs when forces are exerted upon an individual such that his or her free will is removed, and any subsequent actions are considered to be involuntary. A common legal example is holding a gun to someone's head to force them to act in a way they would not otherwise. Regardless of how one feels about compensating research egg donors, it does not follow that modest proposed financial compensation would remove a potential egg donor's free will. In fact, given that Hwang lab members have alleged that professional pressures induced them to donate oocytes for their employer's studies, coercion (and undue influence) is more likely a result of such pressure on would-be donors than large sums of money (Chong and Normile, 2006Chong S. Normile D. Science. 2006; 311: 22-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Compensation for human subjects, including men, women, and children, is a commonly accepted principle, accompanied by established protections and approved protocols. Only in response to potential donations involving women's reproductive potential are such calls of coercion voiced and frequently prevail (Vogel, 2006Vogel G. Science. 2006; 313: 155Google Scholar). To suggest that paying research egg donors is coercive would call into question the voluntariness and free will of virtually every compensated reproductive egg donor as well as every healthy human research subject. “Undue influence” is the more accurate legal construct to argue against compensating egg donors. In contrast to “coercion,” undue influence is a legal theory that in some circumstances, an inducement is so substantial, or the person offering it is in such a position of relative power, that it unfairly impacts or influences a person's actions. (Hyun, 2006Hyun I. Nature. 2006; 442: 629-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Such concerns have been raised in the United States over offering an infertility patient who cannot afford treatment a free or discounted IVF cycle if she agrees to split her eggs with another patient, essentially making her both a donor and a recipient. The various compensation amounts proposed for research egg donors are a fraction of that paid to reproductive egg donors: some of the larger suggested amounts have been $1,000 to $1,500, compared to an accepted range of $5,000–$10,000 for reproductive donors (see The Ethics Committee Of The American Society For Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), 2007The Ethics Committee Of The American Society For Reproductive Medicine (ASRM)Fertil. Steril. 2007; 88: 305-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). On one hand, it seems unlikely that a prospective research donor who also had an option to donate for reproduction would be unduly influenced by the relatively small sum that researchers would offer. On the other hand, some potential research donors may not be eligible to serve as reproductive donors because of their education, health, or socioeconomic strata and thereby be arguably more susceptible to lower remuneration offered them as a research donor. The opposite argument may also apply, given that older women with established families and lifestyles may also be interested in research donation, but less susceptible to financial inducements than young reproductive donors. The question of determining what is and isn't undue influence suggests the need for clear, sensitive, factually based and appropriate compensation guidelines reflecting compensation for a donor's time, effort, risk, and inconvenience and not for the eggs themselves. Another frequently voiced argument is that paying egg donors reduces their eggs to commodities. However, many research donors are paid for their time and discomfort. In these cases, following rigorous IRB protocol and safeguards allows modest remuneration that reflects approximate and reasonable compensation for the time, effort, inconvenience, and risk undertaken by these healthy research subjects, as opposed to payment for their donated tissue. The ISSCR supports such an approach in the case of research oocyte donation by approving compensation provided that appropriate rates are determined by individual jurisdictions. At their core, commodification concerns are an argument against exceedingly and unjustifiably high payments, an issue rooted in the existing context of reproductive donation in which compensation guidelines are at times only loosely followed. Given that hESC research doesn't care about a donor's SAT scores, athletic prowess, or hair or eye color, setting appropriate compensation amounts for research donors may actually help model more appropriate compensation guidelines for reproductive donors. A final, largely ethical argument put forth by opponents is that donation for procreation is a greater good because it helps create life, which justifies existing discrepant payment paradigms. Yet, a survey of reproductive egg donors revealed that they were evenly split in their preference for research or reproductive donations (Klitzman and Sauer, 2009Klitzman R. Sauer M.V. Reprod. Biomed. Online. 2009; 18: 603-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Undoubtedly, some donors, ethicists, and policy makers have stronger feelings about either procreation or research, but in a pluralistic society those individuals' values should not be adopted into law. Considering the histories of compensating reproductive donors and the legal restrictions on embryonic research in the United States may aid in forging future laws and policies. Both egg donation and ESC research became possible only after IVF created the novel ability to create ex utero embryos some 30 years ago. Both have evolved in the large shadow of a national abortion debate fueled by the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade, 1973Roe v. Wade, 410 US 113 (1973).Google Scholar. Over the past two decades, reproductive egg donation has evolved from an informal, empathetic response by relatives and friends into an industry comparable to sperm donation, but with added medications, procedures, and attendant risks and significantly greater remuneration. Egg freezing, although still considered experimental, is increasingly available and promoted and will probably transform the field further in terms of medical protocols, remuneration, and providing potentially “spare” eggs for future research donation. It is also important to recognize that, in terms of known safety risks, the technology and medical risks associated with egg stimulation and retrieval have been undertaken by IVF patients since the early 1980s. Reproductive donors are currently recruited by patients, ART medical programs, and separate recruiting programs, over the Internet, and elsewhere. In contrast to research donors (and laws in other countries), compensation for reproductive egg donors is accepted practice in the United States with no federal laws prohibiting such payments. A federal and model uniform law that each regulate and restrict compensation for organ donations do not encompass egg donations from live donors. The Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (UAGA), 1968Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (UAGA) (1968; rev. 1987, 2006).Google Scholar) restricts payments for body parts that are removed after the death of the donor, whereas the National Organ Transplant Act (National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA), 1984National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA), 42 U.S.C. Sec. 274e, 301 (1984).Google Scholar) prohibits “valuable consideration” for a list of defined “organs” and expressly denies payment for related expenses such as travel and lost wages. NOTA's criminal penalties are primarily aimed at preventing the sale of nonrenewable solid organs, including kidneys, livers, hearts, and eyes, which could compromise a donor's health and well-being. Ironically, bone marrow is explicitly included as an “organ” although it is renewable in a matter of weeks, whereas eggs are not included. (Although eggs are nonrenewable, many analogize them to renewable tissue such as blood and sperm on the theory that females are born with many more eggs than they can ever use in their lifetime). The first lawsuit to challenge the constitutionality of NOTA was filed by Doreen Flynn, a mother of three children who could benefit from bone marrow transplants (Flynn v. Holder, 2009Flynn v. Holder, USDC CA (filed Oct. 2009).Google Scholar). Flynn argues the law is unconstitutional and violates both equal protection and substantive due process rights by arbitrarily treating renewable bone marrow like nonrenewable solid organs, rather than like blood—or, ironically, eggs. The government must only prove a rational basis, the lowest legal standard to pass constitutional muster, but regardless of the ultimate outcome, the issues raised by the case could impact debate over compensating research egg donors, as well. In the absence of legal restrictions on compensation within the United States, payments to reproductive donors are limited only by general tort law or professional guidelines. Voluntary guidelines and ethics statements issued by ASRM permit per-cycle payments for donors of approximately $5,000, and up to $10,000 (Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and Practice Committee of the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, 2006Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive MedicinePractice Committee of the Society for Assisted Reproductive TechnologyFertil.

Although frequently self-described as “agencies,” these entities are widely unregulated. ASRM guidelines also state that compensation is for a woman's “time, inconvenience and discomfort” in undergoing the rigors of donation, not for the eggs themselves or for any specific donor qualities (Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and Practice Committee of the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, 2006Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive MedicinePractice Committee of the Society for Assisted Reproductive TechnologyFertil.

Nonetheless, some reproductive donors receive tens of thousands of dollars from both individuals and recruiting programs, as well as additional fees for a desired ethnicity or proven fertility. The legal history of fetal and embryonic research is quite different. In the immediate wake of Roe v. Wade, many states enacted legislation to prohibit fetal tampering or fetal “experimentation” and defined the term “fetus” to include “embryo.” A number of those laws were unclear and overbroad, and in 1990, the ACLU joined a group of Illinois doctors who successfully sued to have that state's statute voided for vagueness, arguing they could not tell what forms of research were or were not permissible (Lifchez v. Hartigan, 1990Lifchez v. Hartigan, 735 F. Supp.1361 (IL. 1990).Google Scholar). The Massachusetts statute, enacted in 1974, required research be approved by the district attorney and provided criminal penalties, including incarceration, for anyone conducting any form of experimentation using a live fetus, embryo, or neonate. In 1975, Dr. Kenneth Edelin, then the chief resident in obstetrics and gynecology at Boston Medical Center, was convicted for performing a second-trimester abortion after a nurse reported he held the fetus's head in the uterus longer than necessary. The jury's manslaughter conviction was subsequently overturned on appeal (Commonwealth v. Edelin, 1976Commonwealth v. Edelin, 371 Mass. 497 (1976).Google Scholar), but the case is a searing reminder of both the intensity of emotion Roe v. Wade ignited and the willingness of some to use the legal arena against an individual to advance an ideological agenda. Although almost a decade would pass before IVF and cryopreservation made research on ex utero embryos possible, many of those laws and the antiabortion sentiments behind them are still in force and impacting current debates over ESC research (Crockin and Jones, 2010Crockin S.L. Jones H.W. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, MD2010Google Scholar). Thirty years later, the advent and potential of ESC research has renewed legislative and policy efforts to advance science while appeasing both religious opponents and some elements of feminist opposition. As with 1970s era legislation, results have been mixed. In Massachusetts, following decades of researchers' concerns that their work might run afoul of the existing statute, new legislation was enacted in 2005, after lengthy hearings (Massachusetts General Laws, 2005Massachusetts General Laws ch. 111L (2005).Google Scholar). Numerous physicians, researchers, and other experts testified, giving detailed explanations of the science, technology, hope, and limitations of hESC research. Many senators noted it was the most educational experience of their legislative careers. It was a compelling example of scientists managing to influence law and policy. In the final days of the hearings, however, opponents testified about potential negative health impacts of the procedures and warned that compensation might make poor, minority women risk their health to donate eggs. Provisions inserted into the final legislation ban payments or “valuable consideration” to research donors and mandate that two documents be provided to any woman undergoing egg retrieval: a detailed “informational pamphlet” describing the potential health impacts of the egg extraction process and a mandatory “informed consent form.” A deep internal inconsistency also appeared in the final legislation, with a different section of the statute stating that the law was not intended to regulate reproductive IVF. With hESC research proponents getting most of what they fought for, the law passed to much acclaim. Researchers have since found the law's compensation prohibitions have severely impacted their ability to attract egg donors for their research. California's 2004 stem cell law contains a similar payment prohibition for research egg donors. A 2008 Michigan law supporting hESC research authorizes use of only leftover IVF embryos for approved research. Professional groups are split. Voluntary guidelines issued by the International Society for Stem Cell Research endorse local IRB decision making over compensation. Last year, New York approved compensation for research donors in that state. In contrast, the National Academy of Sciences continues to endorse only extremely limited reimbursement for direct expenses, although in 2007–2008, it slightly relaxed its strict payment moratorium to allow some out-of-pocket reimbursement. ASRM has criticized that position and supports compensation for research donors (The Ethics Committee Of The American Society For Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), 2007The Ethics Committee Of The American Society For Reproductive Medicine (ASRM)Fertil. Steril. 2007; 88: 305-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These compromise statutes and policies fail to recognize that compensating healthy human research subjects (including children and other “vulnerable subjects” with additional safeguards) is an accepted, long-standing, and legally recognized practice in medical research. Rationales for compensation include incentives to recruitment, overcoming disincentives such as inertia and distrust, reimbursement to reduce financial barriers to participation, and fair compensation for subjects' time and inconvenience (Grady, 2005Grady C. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 1681-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The primary arguments against such payments have focused on ethical—not legal—concerns, whether compensation undercuts altruism, and the extent to which compensation may threaten voluntary, informed consent (Hutt, 2003Hutt L.E. Health Law Rev. 2003; 12: 16-21PubMed Google Scholar). Safeguards, including federal and state laws and IRB approval, require a careful analysis and weighing of risks and benefits. Human research subjects have been paid for over a century, within frameworks that are designed to minimize undue influence on informed consent. Reproductive sperm and egg donors are routinely compensated to help create children. Yet, compensating research egg donors has become a virtual “third rail” in the shaping of ESC research policy. Given these two established paradigms, the impassioned resistance and resulting compromise laws and policies are difficult to justify. Rather than an ideologically based debate, from a legal perspective, laws and policies can be crafted that address the potential danger of undue influence and commodification while incorporating both protections and compensation for healthy human research subjects under long-established, if imperfect, methods. Attempts to satisfy the ethical objections of hESC research opponents should not result in either disparate treatment for reproductive versus research egg donors or turning solely to research on adult stem cells or iPSCs that cannot replace the need for hESC research. Notably, efforts that combine all avenues of stem cell research may, in time, reduce the number of eggs ultimately sought or needed for stem cell research (Cibelli, 2009Cibelli J. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 345-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In this burgeoning field, researchers continually remind us not to put all our proverbial eggs in one basket by endorsing only iPSC or adult stem cell research. In no other field involving human research subjects are promising avenues of inquiry cut off for purely ideological reasons, whether through well-meaning but problem-riddled legislation or well-intended but politically compromised voluntary guidelines. From a legal perspective, there is no justification to deny researchers or those women who want to be human subjects the opportunity to move this promising science forward under the same ethical, legal, and policy paradigms that apply to every other area of scientific inquiry. To force researchers, potential human subjects, legislatures, and society at large to reject compensation either because of the religious or ideological views of one segment of the population or the notion that female research subjects uniquely need more protections in this arena than in any other—now that would be coercive."

https://openalex.org/W1990323923,"Replication capacity (RC) of specific HIV isolates is occasionally blamed for unexpected treatment responses. However, the role of viral RC in response to antiretroviral therapy is not yet fully understood.We developed a method for predicting RC from genotype using support vector machines (SVMs) trained on about 300 genotype-RC pairs. Next, we studied the impact of predicted viral RC (pRC) on the change of viral load (VL) and CD4(+) T-cell count (CD4) during the course of therapy on about 3,000 treatment change episodes (TCEs) extracted from the EuResist integrated database. Specifically, linear regression models using either treatment activity scores (TAS), the drug combination, or pRC or any combination of these covariates were trained to predict change in VL and CD4, respectively.The SVM models achieved a Spearman correlation (rho) of 0.54 between measured RC and pRC. The prediction of change in VL (CD4) was best at 180 (360) days, reaching a correlation of rho = 0.45 (rho = 0.27). In general, pRC was inversely correlated to drug resistance at treatment start (on average rho = -0.38). Inclusion of pRC in the linear regression models significantly improved prediction of virological response to treatment based either on the drug combination or on the TAS (t-test; p-values range from 0.0247 to 4 10(-6)) but not for the model using both TAS and drug combination. For predicting the change in CD4 the improvement derived from inclusion of pRC was not significant.Viral RC could be predicted from genotype with moderate accuracy and could slightly improve prediction of virological treatment response. However, the observed improvement could simply be a consequence of the significant correlation between pRC and drug resistance."
