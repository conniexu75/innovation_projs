Here, Carola Vinuesa and colleagues describe a regulatory T cell subset that co-opts the differentiation program of TFH cells and limits their numbers in vivo. Ablation of these TFH-like, T regulatory cells alters the number of antigen-specific B cells suggesting regulatory T cells modulate germinal center responses. Follicular helper (TFH) cells provide crucial signals to germinal center B cells undergoing somatic hypermutation and selection that results in affinity maturation. Tight control of TFH numbers maintains self tolerance. We describe a population of Foxp3+Blimp-1+CD4+ T cells constituting 10–25% of the CXCR5highPD-1highCD4+ T cells found in the germinal center after immunization with protein antigens. These follicular regulatory T (TFR) cells share phenotypic characteristics with TFH and conventional Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells yet are distinct from both. Similar to TFH cells, TFR cell development depends on Bcl-6, SLAM-associated protein (SAP), CD28 and B cells; however, TFR cells originate from thymic-derived Foxp3+ precursors, not naive or TFH cells. TFR cells are suppressive in vitro and limit TFH cell and germinal center B cell numbers in vivo. In the absence of TFR cells, an outgrowth of non–antigen-specific B cells in germinal centers leads to fewer antigen-specific cells. Thus, the TFH differentiation pathway is co-opted by Treg cells to control the germinal center response."

How T(reg) cells regulate humoral immunity, including germinal center reactions, is unclear. Here we identify a subset of T(reg) cells expressing CXCR5 and Bcl-6 that localize to the germinal centers in mice and humans. The expression of CXCR5 on T(reg) cells depends on Bcl-6. These CXCR5(+)Bcl-6(+) T(reg) cells are absent in the thymus but can be generated de novo from CXCR5(-)Foxp3(+) natural T(reg) precursors. A lack of CXCR5(+) T(reg) cells leads to greater germinal center reactions including germinal center B cells, affinity maturation of antibodies and the differentiation of plasma cells. These results unveil a Bcl-6-CXCR5 axis in T(reg) cells that drives the development of follicular regulatory T (T(FR)) cells that function to inhibit the germinal center reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2171336109,"Despite the enormous ecological and economic importance of coral reefs, the keystone organisms in their establishment, the scleractinian corals, increasingly face a range of anthropogenic challenges including ocean acidification and seawater temperature rise. To understand better the molecular mechanisms underlying coral biology, here we decoded the approximately 420-megabase genome of Acropora digitifera using next-generation sequencing technology. This genome contains approximately 23,700 gene models. Molecular phylogenetics indicate that the coral and the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis diverged approximately 500 million years ago, considerably earlier than the time over which modern corals are represented in the fossil record (∼240 million years ago). Despite the long evolutionary history of the endosymbiosis, no evidence was found for horizontal transfer of genes from symbiont to host. However, unlike several other corals, Acropora seems to lack an enzyme essential for cysteine biosynthesis, implying dependency of this coral on its symbionts for this amino acid. Corals inhabit environments where they are frequently exposed to high levels of solar radiation, and analysis of the Acropora genome data indicates that the coral host can independently carry out de novo synthesis of mycosporine-like amino acids, which are potent ultraviolet-protective compounds. In addition, the coral innate immunity repertoire is notably more complex than that of the sea anemone, indicating that some of these genes may have roles in symbiosis or coloniality. A number of genes with putative roles in calcification were identified, and several of these are restricted to corals. The coral genome provides a platform for understanding the molecular basis of symbiosis and responses to environmental changes."
https://openalex.org/W2019341627,"Macroautophagy mediates the degradation of long-lived proteins and organelles via the de novo formation of double-membrane autophagosomes that sequester cytoplasm and deliver it to the vacuole/lysosome; however, relatively little is known about autophagosome biogenesis. Atg8, a phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated protein, was previously proposed to function in autophagosome membrane expansion, based on the observation that it mediates liposome tethering and hemifusion in vitro. We show here that with physiological concentrations of phosphatidylethanolamine, Atg8 does not act as a fusogen. Rather, we provide evidence for the involvement of exocytic Q/t-SNAREs in autophagosome formation, acting in the recruitment of key autophagy components to the site of autophagosome formation, and in regulating the organization of Atg9 into tubulovesicular clusters. Additionally, we found that the endosomal Q/t-SNARE Tlg2 and the R/v-SNAREs Sec22 and Ykt6 interact with Sso1-Sec9, and are required for normal Atg9 transport. Thus, multiple SNARE-mediated fusion events are likely to be involved in autophagosome biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2110633413,Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2 disease is characterized by peripheral axon loss and motor and sensory dysfunction. Constantin d'Ydewalle et al. demonstrate that these abnormalities are caused by drops in tubulin acetylation and can be normalized in mice with drugs that restore this acetylation. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is the most common inherited disorder of the peripheral nervous system. Mutations in the 27-kDa small heat-shock protein gene (HSPB1) cause axonal CMT or distal hereditary motor neuropathy (distal HMN). We developed and characterized transgenic mice expressing two different HSPB1 mutations (S135F and P182L) in neurons only. These mice showed all features of CMT or distal HMN dependent on the mutation. Expression of mutant HSPB1 decreased acetylated α-tubulin abundance and induced severe axonal transport deficits. An increase of α-tubulin acetylation induced by pharmacological inhibition of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) corrected the axonal transport defects caused by HSPB1 mutations and rescued the CMT phenotype of symptomatic mutant HSPB1 mice. Our findings demonstrate the pathogenic role of α-tubulin deacetylation in mutant HSPB1–induced neuropathies and offer perspectives for using HDAC6 inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy for hereditary axonopathies.

https://openalex.org/W2034471432,"The transport of small molecules across the inner mitochondrial membrane is catalysed by a large family of membrane proteins called mitochondrial carriers. More than 40 different carriers have so far been identified to selectively translocate different substrates, but only one crystal structure is available — that of the bovine ADP/ATP carrier (ANT1). Now the structure of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), a member of the carrier family that translocates protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane, has been determined using a solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) method. Its overall structure of resembles that of ANT1 — despite their low sequence identity — but the matrix side of the channel is substantially more open in UCP2. This method overcomes some of the challenges associated with using NMR spectroscopy to determine the structure of membrane proteins, so it seems likely that it will be possible to use the approach to solve the high-resolution NMR structures of other membrane proteins of comparable size. Mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) is an integral membrane protein in the mitochondrial anion carrier protein family, the members of which facilitate the transport of small molecules across the mitochondrial inner membrane1,2. When the mitochondrial respiratory complex pumps protons from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space, it builds up an electrochemical potential2. A fraction of this electrochemical potential is dissipated as heat, in a process involving leakage of protons back to the matrix2. This leakage, or ‘uncoupling’ of the proton electrochemical potential, is mediated primarily by uncoupling proteins2. However, the mechanism of UCP-mediated proton translocation across the lipid bilayer is unknown. Here we describe a solution-NMR method for structural characterization of UCP2. The method, which overcomes some of the challenges associated with membrane-protein structure determination3, combines orientation restraints derived from NMR residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) and semiquantitative distance restraints from paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) measurements. The local and secondary structures of the protein were determined by piecing together molecular fragments from the Protein Data Bank that best fit experimental RDCs from samples weakly aligned in a DNA nanotube liquid crystal. The RDCs also determine the relative orientation of the secondary structural segments, and the PRE restraints provide their spatial arrangement in the tertiary fold. UCP2 closely resembles the bovine ADP/ATP carrier (the only carrier protein of known structure4), but the relative orientations of the helical segments are different, resulting in a wider opening on the matrix side of the inner membrane. Moreover, the nitroxide-labelled GDP binds inside the channel and seems to be closer to transmembrane helices 1–4. We believe that this biophysical approach can be applied to other membrane proteins and, in particular, to other mitochondrial carriers, not only for structure determination but also to characterize various conformational states of these proteins linked to substrate transport."
https://openalex.org/W1989353122,"The presence and function of cannabinoid CB(2) receptors in the brain have been the subjects of much debate. We found that systemic, intranasal or intra-accumbens local administration of JWH133, a selective CB(2) receptor agonist, dose-dependently inhibited intravenous cocaine self-administration, cocaine-enhanced locomotion, and cocaine-enhanced accumbens extracellular dopamine in wild-type and CB(1) receptor knockout (CB(1)(-/-), also known as Cnr1(-/-)) mice, but not in CB(2)(-/-) (Cnr2(-/-)) mice. This inhibition was mimicked by GW405833, another CB(2) receptor agonist with a different chemical structure, and was blocked by AM630, a selective CB(2) receptor antagonist. Intra-accumbens administration of JWH133 alone dose-dependently decreased, whereas intra-accumbens administration of AM630 elevated, extracellular dopamine and locomotion in wild-type and CB(1)(-/-) mice, but not in CB(2)(-/-) mice. Intra-accumbens administration of AM630 also blocked the reduction in cocaine self-administration and extracellular dopamine produced by systemic administration of JWH133. These findings suggest that brain CB(2) receptors modulate cocaine's rewarding and locomotor-stimulating effects, likely by a dopamine-dependent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2056862039,"Autophagy is a catabolic process in which lysosomes degrade intracytoplasmic contents transported in double-membraned autophagosomes. Autophagosomes are formed by the elongation and fusion of phagophores, which can be derived from preautophagosomal structures coming from the plasma membrane and other sites like the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. The mechanisms by which preautophagosomal structures elongate their membranes and mature toward fully formed autophagosomes still remain unknown. Here, we show that the maturation of the early Atg16L1 precursors requires homotypic fusion, which is essential for subsequent autophagosome formation. Atg16L1 precursor homotypic fusion depends on the SNARE protein VAMP7 together with partner SNAREs. Atg16L1 precursor homotypic fusion is a critical event in the early phases of autophagy that couples membrane acquisition and autophagosome biogenesis, as this step regulates the size of the vesicles, which in turn appears to influence their subsequent maturation into LC3-positive autophagosomes.

Autophagosomes ultimately fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes, where their contents are degraded. Autophagy regulates numerous physiological and pathological processes, including survival during nutrient starvation, elimination of intracytoplasmic aggregate-prone proteins and pathogens, and innate and acquired immunity (Levine and Deretic, 2007Levine B.

Autophagosome formation occurs through dynamic rearrangements of cellular membrane structures, initiated by the emergence of an isolation membrane called a phagophore. The phagophore membranes extend in a manner that is not understood and fuse to create a double-membrane autophagosome (Mizushima et al., 2008Mizushima N. Levine B. Cuervo A.M. Klionsky D.J.

Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1102-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). More than 30 autophagy-related proteins (Atg) have been discovered to regulate autophagy. Some of these proteins contribute to two conjugation reactions that are required for autophagosome formation. The first involves Atg12 conjugation to Atg5 (Xie and Klionsky, 2007Xie Z. Klionsky D.J. Autophagosome formation: core machinery and adaptations.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1102-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). This Atg12-Atg5 conjugate interacts noncovalently with Atg16L1 to form a complex essential for the phagophore expansion. The complexes formed by Atg16L1-Atg12-Atg5 are localized to the phagophore and dissociate upon completion of autophagosome formation. Thus, vesicular structures that contain these proteins are considered to be phagophores (and not completed autophagosomes). A second conjugation reaction involving Atg8/LC3 contributes to the completion of autophagosome formation. LC3 is cleaved by Atg4 to form cytosolic LC3-I, which is covalently conjugated to the phosphatidylethanolamine to form membrane-associated LC3-II (Xie and Klionsky, 2007Xie Z. Klionsky D.J. Autophagosome formation: core machinery and adaptations.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1102-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). LC3-II is the only known protein that specifically associates with autophagosomes. Thus, LC3-II levels correlate with autophagic vesicle numbers, which can be assessed by western blotting or by scoring LC3-positive vesicle numbers (Rubinsztein et al., 2009Rubinsztein D.C.

Autophagosome membranes have been proposed to originate from a number of sources, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, mitochondria, and the plasma membrane (Hailey et al., 2010Hailey D.W.

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis provides membrane that contributes to the formation of Atg16L1-positive, LC3-negative preautophagosomal structures (which are also negative for EEA-1 and LAMP1) and the subsequent generation of phagophores (Atg16L1-positive, LC3-positive) and mature autophagosomes (Atg16L1-negative, LC3-positive) (Ravikumar et al., 2010Ravikumar B. Moreau K. Jahreiss L. Puri C. Rubinsztein D.C. Plasma membrane contributes to the formation of pre-autophagosomal structures.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). The processes mediating the maturation of preautophagosomal structures toward phagophores and mature autophagosomes are unknown and represent an important gap in the understanding of autophagosome biogenesis. In this study, we reveal that autophagic activity requires homotypic fusion of Atg16L1 precursors in order to form mature autophagosomes. This step is dependent on the SNARE protein VAMP7 together with partner SNAREs. The homotypic fusion and velocity of Atg16L1 precursors increase when autophagy is stimulated by starvation or rapamycin treatment. To understand how Atg16L1 precursors (including small vesicles derived from the plasma membrane) mature toward phagophores and subsequently to a fully formed autophagosome, we hypothesized that fusion events may occur between early precursors. Vesicle fusion depends on multiple classes of proteins, including SNARE proteins, which play a major role by docking vesicles with their target compartments and by catalyzing the fusion of the opposing membranes. As part of an ongoing screen, we identified the SNARE VAMP7 (Tetanus Neurotoxin-Insensitive Vesicle-Associated Membrane Protein) as a candidate regulator of autophagosome formation. To study the potential role of VAMP7 at the Atg16L1 precursor and/or phagophore stage, we performed colocalization analysis using endogenous or exogenous VAMP7, Atg16L1, and LC3 (Figure 1A and Figure S1A available online). Atg16L1-GFP colocalized with VAMP7-mRFP in LC3-negative structures (top panels) (Figure 1A), but also with vesicles containing both VAMP7-mRFP and LC3-CFP (Figure 1A), indicating the localization of VAMP7 at the Atg16L1 precursor and phagophore levels. Atg16L1-GFP colocalized in a similar fashion with endogenous VAMP7 or stably expressed VAMP7-HA (Figure 1A). Atg16L1-GFP vesicles containing VAMP7 also colocalized with Atg5-GFP, another marker of autophagic precursors (Figure 1A). Endogenous Atg16L1 colocalized with stably expressed VAMP7-HA (Figure S1A). VAMP7 is associated with different SNARE partners to form an organelle-specific fusion complex, which ensures that vesicles fuse only with appropriate acceptor membranes (Hong, 2005Hong W. SNAREs and traffic.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1744: 493-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). We observed colocalization between Atg16L1-GFP and endogenous syntaxin 7, syntaxin 8, and Vti1b, partner SNAREs of VAMP7 localized in the endosomal compartment (Figure S1B) (Bonifacino and Glick, 2004Bonifacino J.S. Glick B.S. The mechanisms of vesicle budding and fusion.Cell. 2004; 116: 153-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). In contrast, Atg16L1-GFP did not colocalize with SNAP23, a partner SNARE of VAMP7 localized at the plasma membrane involved in exocytosis (Figure S1B) (Bonifacino and Glick, 2004Bonifacino J.S.

We confirmed the localization of VAMP7 on Atg16L1 precursors by immunoelectron microscopy in VAMP7-HA stable cells exogenously expressing Atg16L1-GFP (Figure 1B).

We confirmed our recent data that Atg16L1-GFP dots obtained after overexpression are true autophagic structures, as they colocalize with endogenous Atg12 using confocal analysis and decorate vesicles visualized by immunoelectron microscopy (Figure S1C) (Ravikumar et al., 2010Ravikumar B.

Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Having shown that VAMP7, syntaxin 7, syntaxin 8, and Vti1b localized to vesicles involved in the early steps of autophagosome biogenesis, we next studied the roles of these SNAREs in autophagic activity. We first tested the effect of VAMP7, syntaxin 7, syntaxin 8, and Vti1b knockdown (Figure S2A ) on autophagosome formation by studying LC3-II accumulation on western blot. LC3-II changes can be the consequence of autophagosome formation and/or degradation. To discriminate between these possibilities, LC3-II levels can be assessed in the presence of saturating concentrations of bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1), a potent inhibitor of the vacuolar H+ ATPase that inhibits the degradation of LC3-II (Rubinsztein et al., 2009Rubinsztein D.C. Cuervo A.M. Ravikumar B. Sarkar S. Korolchuk V. Kaushik S. Klionsky D.J. In search of an “autophagomometer”.Autophagy. 2009; 5: 585-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Knockdown of VAMP7, syntaxin 7, and syntaxin 8 decreased LC3-II levels in the presence or absence of Baf A1, indicating an inhibition of autophagosome formation (Figure 2A , Figures S2B and S2C). The magnitude of this inhibition was not dissimilar to that seen with knockdown of Atg16L1 (a key autophagy protein) (Xie and Klionsky, 2007Xie Z. Klionsky D.J. Autophagosome formation: core machinery and adaptations.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1102-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar) (Figure S2A). The effects of VAMP7 knockdown on autophagosome formation (LC3-II levels under Baf A1 conditions) were also obvious under conditions of autophagy induction by starvation, similar to that seen with knockdown of Atg16L1 (Figure 2B and Figure S2A), in which the knockdown decreased new autophagosome formation by about 30%. Vti1b knockdown increased LC3-II levels in the absence of Baf A1, as described previously, because it regulates autophagosome-lysosome fusion (Figure S2D) (Furuta et al., 2010Furuta N. Fujita N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Amano A. Combinational soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor proteins VAMP8 and Vti1b mediate fusion of antimicrobial and canonical autophagosomes with lysosomes.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 1001-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Vti1b knockdown did not cause any obvious decrease in LC3-II levels in the presence of Baf A1 (Figure S2D). This may be because this perturbation does not affect LC3-II formation. However, it may be difficult to exclude the possibility that Vti1b knockdown may affect both autophagosome formation and autophagosome-lysosome fusion (autophagosome degradation), given that the extent of knockdown that impacts on the formation versus degradation steps may differ (as we have seen with clathrin, for example; Ravikumar et al., 2010Ravikumar B.

Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar), and for certain SNAREs, some function can be preserved in cells even when there are only a few molecules left (Bethani et al., 2009Bethani I.

Methodological considerations for assessing autophagy modulators: a study with calcium phosphate precipitates.Autophagy. 2009; 5: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Because the two fluorescent proteins have different pKa values, this construct can be used as a probe for autophagic flux. At physiological pH, both proteins are stable, leading to both red and green fluorescence (autophagosome). On acidification, after fusion with the lysosomes, green fluorescence is rapidly lost because of the high pKa of GFP, and only red fluorescence remains (autolysosome) (Kimura et al., 2007Kimura S. Noda T. Yoshimori T.

Methodological considerations for assessing autophagy modulators: a study with calcium phosphate precipitates.Autophagy. 2009; 5: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). VAMP7 knockdown resulted in an increase in the numbers of autophagosomes (vesicles positive for both red and green) and a decrease in the numbers of autolysosomes (red positive, green negative) in the absence of Baf A1 (Figures 2C and 2D). This suggests a decreased delivery of autophagosomes to lysosomes due to VAMP7 knockdown, compatible with previous data (Fader et al., 2009Fader C.M. Sanchez D.G. Mestre M.B. Colombo M.I. TI-VAMP/VAMP7 and VAMP3/cellubrevin: two v-SNARE proteins involved in specific steps of the autophagy/multivesicular body pathways.Biochim. Biophys.

Cell. 2010; 21: 1001-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, there were fewer total LC3-positive vesicles in the VAMP7 knockdown cells, compatible with our earlier data suggesting that VAMP7 also regulates autophagosome formation. Indeed, we confirmed with this assay that VAMP7 knockdown impaired autophagosome formation by using Baf A1, where we saw a decrease in the number of autophagosomes (Figures 2C and 2D). It is worth noting that the number of autophagic vesicles per cell did not obviously increase in Baf A1-treated cells compared to untreated cells (Figure 2D). This result is due to homotypic fusion of mature autophagosomes, as described previously (Jahreiss et al., 2008Jahreiss L. Menzies F.M. Rubinsztein D.C. The itinerary of autophagosomes: from peripheral formation to kiss-and-run fusion with lysosomes.Traffic. 2008; 9: 574-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Indeed, the size of the autophagic vesicles increased under Baf A1 treatment, compared to untreated cells, and this correlates with a defect in autophagosome degradation (Figure S2E). The effects of VAMP7 knockdown on autophagosome formation (LC3-II levels under Baf A1 conditions) were also obvious under conditions of autophagy induction by starvation (Figure S2F), in which the knockdown decreased new autophagosome formation by about 40%. We confirmed that the effects of VAMP7, syntaxin 7, and syntaxin 8 on autophagosome formation were not a consequence of impaired endocytosis (Figure S2G) (Ravikumar et al., 2010Ravikumar B. Moreau K. Jahreiss L. Puri C. Rubinsztein D.C. Plasma membrane contributes to the formation of pre-autophagosomal structures.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). However, Vti1b knockdown did slightly decrease endocytosis, which may confound interpretations of the exact functions of Vti1b (Figure S2G). p62/SQSTM1 is a protein involved in the formation of ubiquitin-positive cytoplasmic inclusion bodies and is constitutively degraded by the autophagic machinery. Therefore, the steady-state levels of p62 reflect the rate of autophagic degradation. Higher levels of p62 accumulated in VAMP7 and syntaxin 7 knockdown cells than in control cells (Figure S2H), indicating a functional role of VAMP7 and syntaxin 7 in autophagic activity. However, it is important to note that assays of autophagic substrate accumulation cannot discriminate between different sites of autophagic defects. In order to understand the mechanism by which VAMP7 and associated SNAREs regulate autophagosome formation, we counted the number of endogenous Atg16L1 vesicles and studied the colocalization between Atg16L1 and LC3. Knockdown of VAMP7, syntaxin 7, syntaxin 8, and Vti1b increased the number of Atg16L1 vesicles per cell but decreased the colocalization between Atg16L1 and LC3 (Figure 2E and Figure S2I), in contrast to Ulk1 knockdown, a known inhibitor of Atg16L1 vesicle formation (Figure 2E) (Hara et al., 2008Hara T. Takamura A. Kishi C. Iemura S. Natsume T. Guan J.L. Mizushima N. FIP200, a ULK-interacting protein, is required for autophagosome formation in mammalian cells.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 497-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). The increased number of Atg16L1 vesicles observed after VAMP7, syntaxin 7, syntaxin 8, or Vti1b knockdown was specific to these SNAREs, as the knockdown of Sec22b, a SNARE involved in ER-Golgi vesicle trafficking (Hong, 2005Hong W.

Using optogenetics and multi-electrode recording in behaving mice, we found that brief selective drive of TRN switched the thalamocortical firing mode from tonic to bursting and generated state-dependent neocortical spindles. These findings provide causal support for the involvement of the TRN in state regulation in vivo and introduce a new model for addressing the role of this structure in behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1981359686,"The STAT3 transcription factor maintains pluripotency by preventing differentiation. A Brg1-containing chromatin-remodelling complex, esBAF, is shown to direct STAT3 to its targets across the pluripotent genome. Deletion of Brg1 leads to binding of the polycomb complex and subsequent silencing of LIF/STAT targets. Unexpectedly, Brg1 also helps the polycomb complex silence Hox genes thereby further contributing to pluripotency. Signalling by the cytokine LIF and its downstream transcription factor, STAT3, prevents differentiation of pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs). This contrasts with most cell types where STAT3 signalling induces differentiation. We find that STAT3 binding across the pluripotent genome is dependent on Brg1, the ATPase subunit of a specialized chromatin remodelling complex (esBAF) found in ESCs. Brg1 is required to establish chromatin accessibility at STAT3 binding targets, preparing these sites to respond to LIF signalling. Brg1 deletion leads to rapid polycomb (PcG) binding and H3K27me3-mediated silencing of many Brg1-activated targets genome wide, including the target genes of the LIF signalling pathway. Hence, one crucial role of Brg1 in ESCs involves its ability to potentiate LIF signalling by opposing PcG. Contrary to expectations, Brg1 also facilitates PcG function at classical PcG targets, including all four Hox loci, reinforcing their repression in ESCs. Therefore, esBAF does not simply antagonize PcG. Rather, the two chromatin regulators act both antagonistically and synergistically with the common goal of supporting pluripotency."
https://openalex.org/W2017614405,"Autophagy has been recently demonstrated to control cell and tissue homeostasis, including the functions of various metabolic tissues. However, it remains unclear whether autophagy is critical for the central nervous system and particularly the hypothalamus for exerting metabolic regulation. Using autophagy-related protein 7 (Atg7) as an autophagic marker, this work showed that autophagy was highly active in the mediobasal hypothalamus of normal mice. In contrast, chronic development of dietary obesity was associated with autophagic decline in the mediobasal hypothalamus. To investigate the potential role of autophagy in the hypothalamic control of metabolic physiology, a mouse model was developed with autophagic inhibition in the mediobasal hypothalamus using site-specific delivery of lentiviral shRNA against Atg7. This model revealed that hypothalamic inhibition of autophagy increased energy intake and reduced energy expenditure. These metabolic changes were sufficient to increase body weight gain under normal chow feeding and exacerbate the progression of obesity and whole-body insulin resistance under high-fat diet feeding. To explore the underlying mechanism, this study found that defective hypothalamic autophagy led to hypothalamic inflammation, including the activation of proinflammatory IκB kinase β pathway. Using brain-specific IκB kinase β knockout mice, it was found that the effects of defective hypothalamic autophagy in promoting obesity were reversed by IκB kinase β inhibition in the brain. In conclusion, hypothalamic autophagy is crucial for the central control of feeding, energy, and body weight balance. Conversely, decline of hypothalamic autophagy under conditions of chronic caloric excess promotes hypothalamic inflammation and thus impairs hypothalamic control of energy balance, leading to accelerated development of obesity and comorbidities.

However, it remains unexplored whether autophagy in the hypothalamus is crucial for the central control of metabolic physiology and related metabolic diseases, despite the fact that impairment of autophagy in the CNS can promote neurodegenerative disorders (11Komatsu M.

In this background, this work aimed to investigate the potential roles of hypothalamic autophagy in the central control of energy and body weight balance and related disease and also to test the possible connection of hypothalamic autophagic alteration with inflammatory changes of the hypothalamus in causing disease development. IKKβlox/lox mice have been described previously (30Zhang X. Zhang G. Zhang H. Karin M. Bai H. Cai D. Cell. 2008; 135: 61-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). Nestin-Cre mice and C57BL/6 mice were from The Jackson Laboratory. All these mouse lines were maintained in a C57BL/6 strain background. Nestin-Cre mice were backcrossed with IKKβlox/lox mice for > 25 generations over 6 years. Mice were housed in standard conditions and maintained on a normal chow or a high-fat diet (HFD, Research Diets, Inc.). The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine approved all animal procedures. Mouse body weight was regularly measured, and food intake was determined on a daily basis by individual housing. Overnight-fasted mice were intraperitoneally injected with glucose (2 g/kg of body weight) for the glucose tolerance test. Blood glucose levels were measured at the indicated time points post-injection with a LifeScan blood glucose monitoring system. The mouse body composition was measured using an EchoMRITM whole body composition analyzer (Echo Medical Systems). The physiological markers of energy expenditure, including O2 consumption and CO2 production, were measured using the metabolic chambers (Columbus Instruments, Inc.) at the Diabetes Research and Training Center core facility of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. O2 consumption and CO2 production were normalized by lean body mass of mice. Energy expenditure was calculated using the formula energy expenditure = (3.815 + 1.232 × VCO2/VO2) × VO2, where VCO2 and VO2 were expressed as ml/kg/h corrected by body weight according to the literature (46Le Gouill E. Jimenez M. Binnert C. Jayet P.Y. Thalmann S. Nicod P. Scherrer U. Vollenweider P. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 2690-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Blood insulin and leptin levels were determined using ELISA kits (Chrystal Chem). As described previously (30Zhang X. Zhang G. Zhang H. Karin M. Bai H. Cai D. Cell. 2008; 135: 61-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar), the hypothalamus of mice was cut along the anterior border of the optic chiasm, the posterior border of the mammillary body, the upper border of the anterior commissure, and the lateral border halfway from the lateral sulcus in the ventral side. Tissue lysis, protein extraction, and Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (30Zhang X. Zhang G. Zhang H. Karin M. Bai H. Cai D. Cell. 2008; 135: 61-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). Proteins were dissolved in a lysis buffer and separated by SDS/PAGE for Western blot analyses. Primary antibodies included rabbit anti-Atg7 (Abcam, Inc.), anti-Atg5 (Abgent), anti-LC3 (Novus), anti-phosphorylated NF-κB, anti-NF-κB (RelA), anti-phosphorylated IKKα/β, anti-IKKβ, anti-β-actin (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), and anti-IκBα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Secondary antibody was HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgGs (Pierce). The densitometric analyses of Western blotting images were performed using Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics). Total RNA from the tissues was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen). The Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus Reverse Transcriptase (M-MLV RT) system (Promega) was used to synthesize cDNA, and PCR was performed and quantified using SYBR Green real-time PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Data were normalized by mRNA levels of β-actin. Mice under anesthesia were transcardially perfused with 4% PFA, and brains were post-fixed in 4% PFA for 4 h and infiltrated with 20–30% sucrose. Brain sections of 20-μm thickness were made using a cryostat at −20 °C. Fixed brain sections were blocked with serum of the appropriate species, penetrated with 0.2% Triton X-100, and treated with primary antibodies, including rabbit anti-Atg7 (Abcam, Inc.) and mouse anti-NeuN (Chemicon), and subsequently reacted with fluorescent Alexa Fluor 488 or 555 secondary antibody (Invitrogen). Images were captured under a confocal microscope. The lentiviral vector of shRNA against mouse Atg7 and matched control lentiviral vector were purchased from Sigma. Lentiviruses were produced from HEK293T cells through cotransfection of target plasmids with their packaging plasmids. Lentiviruses were purified by ultracentrifugation. As described previously (30Zhang X. Zhang G. Zhang H. Karin M. Bai H. Cai D. Cell. 2008; 135: 61-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar), an ultraprecise stereotax was employed to bilaterally inject lentiviruses into the mediobasal hypothalamus (predominantly the arcuate nucleus) at the coordinates of 1.5 mm posterior to the bregma, 0.3 mm lateral to the midline, and 5.8 mm below the surface of the skull. Two-tailed Student's t tests were used for two-group comparisons. Analysis of variance and appropriate post hoc analyses were used for comparisons of more than two groups. Data were presented as mean ± S.E. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Atg proteins are a group of key components that function to form autophagosome and mediate autophagic activity (1Yorimitsu T. Klionsky D.J. Cell Death.

Among Atg proteins, Atg7 is essential for the autophagic response, and, indeed, Atg7 ablation or inhibition is sufficient to impair the autophagic function of cells (11Komatsu M. Waguri S. Chiba T.

To investigate the potential role of autophagy in the hypothalamus, we first profiled the distribution of Atg7 protein in the hypothalamus of normal mice (standard C57BL/6 adult males). Using the immunostaining of Atg7, we found that Atg7 was broadly expressed in various brain regions, including the hypothalamus (Fig. 1). Interestingly, we observed that compared with all other brain and hypothalamic regions, Atg7 protein levels in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus was most abundant (Fig. 1). To understand types of neural cells in which Atg7 was expressed most, we performed coimmunostaining of Atg7 with a neuronal marker, NeuN. As shown in Fig. 1, Atg7 was expressed predominantly in the cytoplasm of most neurons, which were visualized through the nuclear staining of NeuN. Because the literature has well established that Atg7 represents a molecular marker that indicates the activity of autophagy (11Komatsu M. Waguri S. Chiba T. Murata S. Iwata J. Tanida I. Ueno T.

https://openalex.org/W2039237147,"Patients undergoing radiation treatment for Hodgkins's lymphoma are at increased risk of developing secondary malignancies with time. This genome-wide analysis identifies genetic polymorphisms associated with increased risk of secondary malignancies in treated children. The risk alleles result in decreased radiation-mediated induction of PRDM1, a tumor suppressor transcription factor, leading to impaired repression of oncogenic drivers such as MYC. Survivors of pediatric Hodgkin's lymphoma are at risk for radiation therapy–induced second malignant neoplasms (SMNs). We identified two variants at chromosome 6q21 associated with SMNs in survivors of Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with radiation therapy as children but not as adults. The variants comprise a risk locus associated with decreased basal expression of PRDM1 (encoding PR domain containing 1, with ZNF domain) and impaired induction of the PRDM1 protein after radiation exposure. These data suggest a new gene-exposure interaction that may implicate PRDM1 in the etiology of radiation therapy-induced SMNs."
https://openalex.org/W2013511472,"Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a kinase that plays a key role in a wide array of cellular processes and exists in two distinct functional complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). Although mTORC2 is primarily activated by growth factors, mTORC1 is regulated by numerous extracellular and intracellular signals such as nutrients, growth factors, and cellular redox. Previous study has shown that cysteine oxidants sufficiently activate mTORC1 activity under amino acid-depleted conditions and that a reducing agent effectively suppresses amino acid-induced mTORC1 activity, thereby raising the possibility that redox-sensitive mechanisms underlie amino acid-dependent mTORC1 regulation. However, the molecular mechanism by which redox regulates mTORC1 activity is not well understood. In this study, we show that the redox-sensitive regulation of mTORC1 occurs via Rheb but not the Rag small GTPase. Enhancing cellular redox potential with cysteine oxidants significantly increases Rheb GTP levels. Importantly, modulation of the cellular redox potential with a cysteine oxidant or reducing agent failed to alter mTORC1 activity in TSC1−/− or TSC2−/− mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. Furthermore, a cysteine oxidant has little effect on mTOR localization but sufficiently activates mTORC1 activity in both p18−/− and control mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, suggesting that the redox-sensitive regulation of mTORC1 occurs independent of the Ragulator·Rag complex. Taken together, our results suggest that the TSC complex plays an important role in redox-sensitive mTORC1 regulation and argues for the activation of mTORC1 in places other than the lysosome upon inhibition of the TSC complex.

Chem. 2005; 280: 39505-39509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) first demonstrated that cysteine oxidants such as phenylarsine oxide (PAO) and diamide activated mTORC1 activity in vivo and in vitro. Interestingly, cysteine oxidants were able to enhance S6K phosphorylation even in the absence of amino acids in culture, and a reducing agent effectively suppresses amino acid-induced mTORC1 activation (34Sarbassov D.D. Sabatini D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39505-39509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cysteine oxidants destabilized the mTOR-Raptor interaction but not the mTOR-Rictor interaction. These observations suggest that a redox-sensitive mechanism may underlie amino acid-dependent mTORC1 regulation, which is regulated by the Rag-Ragulator system (12Sancak Y. Bar-Peled L. Zoncu R.

Given the observation that cysteine oxidants enhance mTORC1 activity in vitro, it has been postulated that a component of mTORC1 or mTOR itself may sense redox potential to regulate mTORC1 function in response to extracellular amino acids (34Sarbassov D.D.

Moreover, our study indicates that the TSC-Rheb pathway, but not the Rag-Ragulator, plays an essential role in mTORC1 regulation in response to cellular redox potential. We also discuss redox-sensitive mTORC1 regulation by spatial activation of Rheb in places other than the lysosome.

Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) was used for plasmid transfection according to the product manual. HEK293T, HeLa, and mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines (wild-type, TSC1−/−, TSC2−/−, p18−/−, and p18rev cells) were cultured in high glucose DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone Laboratories) and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) (11Nada S.

For amino acid stimulation assays, cells were treated with HBSS for 1 h and then cultured in low glucose DMEM for another 15 min. For cysteine oxidant or reducing agent treatment, cells were treated with HBSS for 1 h and then incubated in the reagent solution for 15 min under the following conditions: 5 μm PAO for HEK293T cells, 0.1 μm PAO for MEF cells, 250 μm diamide, and 0.5 mm BAL in HBSS. For the amino acid or glucose starvation treatments, cells were incubated in HBSS or No-Glucose DMEM for 1 h, respectively. 2-DG was added directly to the cell medium to a final concentration of 50 mm, and cells were incubated for 1 h. For rapamycin treatment, cells were preincubated with 20 nm rapamycin for 15 min before oxidant or reducing agent treatment. Cells were lysed on ice for 5 min in ice-cold lysis buffer (40 mm HEPES (ph 7.5), 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm pyrophosphate, 10 mm glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1.5 mm Na3VO4, 0.3% CHAPS, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)). After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was mixed with 5× SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. For immunoprecipitations, lysates were incubated with 1 μg of the indicated antibody for 2 h and precipitated with protein G/L-Sepharose.

Cells were then lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors). Tagged small GTPase protein was immunoprecipitated with Myc or HA antibody. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times each with washing buffer I (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% Triton X-100, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT) and buffer II (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT). The GTPase-bound nucleotides were eluted with elution buffer (2 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 1 mm GDP, 1 mm GTP) at 68 °C for 15 min. Eluted nucleotides were separated on polyethyleneimine cellulose plates (Baker-Flex) in 0.75 m KH2PO4, pH 3.4. Effectene (Qiagen) was used to transfect 0.8 million HeLa cells in 6-cm dishes with siRNA oligonucleotides to TSC1 (SMARTpool, Dharmacon). 72 h after transfection, the cells were rinsed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer, and analyzed by immunoblotting as above. Cells were fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde. The fixed cells were rinsed three times with PBS and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min and blocked with 2% BSA-TBS for 30 min at room temperature. After rinsing three times with TBS containing 0.05% Tween (TBS-T), samples were incubated with primary antibodies in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, rinsed three times with TBS-T, incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, washed two times with TBS-T, and rinsed two times with water.

In contrast, BAL is a reducing agent that efficiently reverses oxidation reactions induced by PAO (41Bogumil R. Ullrich V. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 348: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 42Frost S.C. Schwalbe M.S. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As reported previously, PAO treatment induced the phosphorylation of endogenous S6K (Thr-389), a substrate of mTORC1, in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1A) (34Sarbassov D.D. Sabatini D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39505-39509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). BAL completely blocked the stimulatory effect of PAO on S6K phosphorylation, confirming that it is the oxidizing activity of PAO that is responsible for S6K phosphorylation. Interestingly, PAO decreased the phosphorylation of the AKT hydrophobic site (the site catalyzed by mTORC2), suggesting that PAO specifically activates mTORC1, but not mTORC2, and that cysteine oxidants may not directly enhance mTOR kinase activity. Furthermore, PAO induces the phosphorylation of S6K, the site catalyzed by mTORC1, in a manner independent of AKT activation. Amino acids are known to be required for insulin-mediated stimulation of TORC1 (43Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar), but amino acids are not required for PAO to phosphorylate S6K (Fig. 1A). Pretreatment with 2-deoxyglucose, a compound that causes energy starvation by blocking glucose utilization, however, diminished PAO-induced S6K phosphorylation. Furthermore, in the absence of glucose, S6K activation by PAO was consistently compromised (Fig. 1A). These data suggest that glucose starvation may inhibit a step in the mTORC1 pathway downstream or parallel to PAO signaling. To validate the fact that PAO stimulates S6K phosphorylation via mTORC1 activation, we examined the effect of PAO on the phosphorylation of 4EBP1, another important TORC1 substrate under amino acid starvation conditions (44Beretta L. Gingras A.C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 45von Manteuffel S.R. Gingras A.C. Ming X.F. Sonenberg N. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 4076-4080Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Consistent with the effect of PAO on S6K phosphorylation under amino acid starvation conditions, PAO treatment also induced 4EBP1 phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). To investigate the mechanism by which mTORC1 activity is enhanced by PAO, we also examined the activities of major upstream kinases such as AKT, ERK1/2, and AMPK under the same conditions. Consistent with the result shown in Fig. 1A, the phosphorylation of AKT, a major upstream positive regulator of mTORC1, is suppressed by PAO treatment under amino acid starvation conditions (Fig. 1B). We also found that the phosphorylation of both ERK and AMPK was enhanced by PAO treatment (Fig. 1B). Previous studies have determined that AMPK is a negative regulator for the mTORC1 pathway. Thus, the result suggests that PAO also acts downstream of AMPK to overcome its inhibitory effect on the mTORC1 activation. It has been reported that ERK stimulates mTORC1 activity by inhibiting the TSC2 tumor suppressor. To determine whether PAO-induced mTORC1 activation requires ERK1/2 activities, we examined the effect of the MEK inhibitor (U0126) on PAO-induced S6K phosphorylation. Interestingly, the MEK inhibitor had no effect on PAO-induced S6K phosphorylation, although it completely abolished PAO-induced Thr/Tyr phosphorylation on ERK1/2, the sites r"

https://openalex.org/W2115555643,"In vision, balance and hearing, sensory receptor cells translate sensory stimuli into electrical signals whose amplitude is graded with stimulus intensity. The output synapses of these sensory neurons must provide fast signaling to follow rapidly changing stimuli while also transmitting graded information covering a wide range of stimulus intensity and must be able to sustain this signaling for long time periods. To meet these demands, specialized machinery for transmitter release, the synaptic ribbon, has evolved at the synaptic outputs of these neurons. We found that acute disruption of synaptic ribbons by photodamage to the ribbon markedly reduced both sustained and transient components of neurotransmitter release in mouse bipolar cells and salamander cones without affecting the ultrastructure of the ribbon or its ability to localize synaptic vesicles to the active zone. Our results indicate that ribbons mediate both slow and fast signaling at sensory synapses and support an additional role for the synaptic ribbon in priming vesicles for exocytosis at active zones."
https://openalex.org/W1966520799,"Here we use whole-genome de novo assembly of second-generation sequencing reads to map structural variation (SV) in an Asian genome and an African genome. Our approach identifies small- and intermediate-size homozygous variants (1-50 kb) including insertions, deletions, inversions and their precise breakpoints, and in contrast to other methods, can resolve complex rearrangements. In total, we identified 277,243 SVs ranging in length from 1-23 kb. Validation using computational and experimental methods suggests that we achieve overall <6% false-positive rate and <10% false-negative rate in genomic regions that can be assembled, which outperforms other methods. Analysis of the SVs in the genomes of 106 individuals sequenced as part of the 1000 Genomes Project suggests that SVs account for a greater fraction of the diversity between individuals than do single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These findings demonstrate that whole-genome de novo assembly is a feasible approach to deriving more comprehensive maps of genetic variation."
https://openalex.org/W1965440699,"Here we present a new method that combines protein complementation with resonance energy transfer to study conformational changes in response to activation of a defined G protein-coupled receptor heteromer, and we apply the approach to the putative dopamine D1-D2 receptor heteromer. Remarkably, the potency of the D2 dopamine receptor (D2R) agonist R-(-)-10,11-dihydroxy-N-n-propylnoraporphine (NPA) to change the Gα(i) conformation via the D2R protomer in the D1-D2 heteromer was enhanced ten-fold relative to its potency in the D2R homomer. In contrast, the potencies of the D2R agonists dopamine and quinpirole were the same in the homomer and heteromer. Thus, we have uncovered a molecular mechanism for functional selectivity in which a drug acts differently at a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) protomer depending on the identity of the second protomer participating in the formation of the signaling unit--opening the door to enhancing pharmacological specificity by targeting differences between homomeric and heteromeric signaling."

Highly coevolved acidic and aromatic side chains assist the transfer of cationic side chains across the transmembrane electric field during voltage sensing. We investigated the functional contribution of negative electrostatic potentials from these residues to channel gating and voltage sensing with unnatural amino acid mutagenesis, electrophysiology, voltage-clamp fluorometry and ab initio calculations. The data show that neutralization of two conserved acidic side chains in transmembrane segments S2 and S3, namely Glu293 and Asp316 in Shaker potassium channels, has little functional effect on conductance-voltage relationships, although Glu293 appears to catalyze S4 movement. Our results suggest that neither Glu293 nor Asp316 engages in electrostatic state–dependent charge-charge interactions with S4, likely because they occupy, and possibly help create, a water-filled vestibule."
https://openalex.org/W1990964367,"Cells contain a large pool of nonpumping Na/K-ATPase that participates in signal transduction. Here, we show that the expression of α1 Na/K-ATPase is significantly reduced in human prostate carcinoma as well as in several human cancer cell lines. This down-regulation impairs the ability of Na/K-ATPase to regulate Src-related signaling processes. A supplement of pNaKtide, a peptide derived from α1 Na/K-ATPase, reduces the activities of Src and Src effectors. Consequently, these treatments stimulate apoptosis and inhibit growth in cultures of human cancer cells. Moreover, administration of pNaKtide inhibits angiogenesis and growth of tumor xenograft. Thus, the new findings demonstrate the in vivo effectiveness of pNaKtide and suggest that the defect in Na/K-ATPase-mediated signal transduction may be targeted for developing new anticancer therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2145420708,"CEL-maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY), diabetes with pancreatic lipomatosis and exocrine dysfunction, is due to dominant frameshift mutations in the acinar cell carboxyl ester lipase gene (CEL). As Cel knock-out mice do not express the phenotype and the mutant protein has an altered and intrinsically disordered tandem repeat domain, we hypothesized that the disease mechanism might involve a negative effect of the mutant protein. In silico analysis showed that the pI of the tandem repeat was markedly increased from pH 3.3 in wild-type (WT) to 11.8 in mutant (MUT) human CEL. By stably overexpressing CEL-WT and CEL-MUT in HEK293 cells, we found similar glycosylation, ubiquitination, constitutive secretion, and quality control of the two proteins. The CEL-MUT protein demonstrated, however, a high propensity to form aggregates found intracellularly and extracellularly. Different physicochemical properties of the intrinsically disordered tandem repeat domains of WT and MUT proteins may contribute to different short and long range interactions with the globular core domain and other macromolecules, including cell membranes. Thus, we propose that CEL-MODY is a protein misfolding disease caused by a negative gain-of-function effect of the mutant proteins in pancreatic tissues.

Most monogenic forms of diabetes are due to mutations in genes expressed in the pancreatic beta cell. Previously, Raeder et al. (1Raeder H. Johansson S. Holm P.I. Haldorsen I.S. Mas E. Sbarra V.

Notably, this gene is not transcribed in beta cells but is mainly expressed in pancreatic acinar tissue (2Roudani S. Miralles F. Margotat A. Escribano M.J. Lombardo D. Biochim. Biophys.

The CEL enzyme (EC 3.1.1.13), also known as bile salt-stimulated/dependent lipase, is secreted into the intestine and activated by bile salts, playing a role in the hydrolysis and absorption of cholesterol- and lipid-soluble vitamins (6Lombardo D.

The human CEL gene is ∼10 kb in size and consists of 11 exons. In the last exon, there is a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) where the 33-bp nearly identical segments are repeated usually between 7 and 23 times (1Raeder H. Johansson S. Holm P.I.

The VNTR of the most common CEL allele has 16 repeats, thereby encoding a protein consisting of 745 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of ∼79 kDa. The rat Cel is secreted from the acinar cells and is thought to follow the classical pathway of secretory proteins (for review see Ref. 3Lombardo D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1533: 1-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the protein is co-translationally N-glycosylated at a conserved Asn residue (Asn-210), serving as a client protein for the molecular chaperone GRP94 and being associated with ER membranes (10Bruneau N.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2665-2679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The VNTR-encoded protein C terminus is heavily O-glycosylated in the mature protein, probably on Thr residues before or after PVPP motifs in the first 10 repeats (12Wang C.S. Dashti A. Jackson K.W. Yeh J.C. Cummings R.D. Tang J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10639-10644Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The O-glycosylation sites are present in a region enriched in the amino acids proline, glutamate, serine, and threonine (PEST sequence), a signal for rapid protein degradation, and glycosylated CEL is hypothesized to escape PEST-mediated degradation (10Bruneau N.

CEL represents 4–8% of the total secreted protein in human pancreatic juice (17Lombardo D. Guy O. Figarella C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 527: 142-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Although pancreatic lipomatosis and exocrine dysfunction are early events in the development of CEL-MODY dysfunction (1Raeder H. Johansson S. Holm P.I. Haldorsen I.S. Mas E. Sbarra V. Nermoen I. Eide S.A. Grevle L. Bj⊘rkhaug L. Sagen J.V. Aksnes L. S⊘vik O. Lombardo D. Molven A. Nj⊘lstad P.R. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 18Vesterhus M. Raeder H. Johansson S. Molven A. Nj⊘lstad P.R. Diabetes Care. 2008; 31: 306-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the pathogenic mechanism involved is unknown. In a recent study, our group found that knocking out Cel in mice did not result in diabetes or exocrine dysfunction, indicating that CEL-MODY is not due to haploinsufficiency (19Vesterhus M.

Because the mutant proteins in the two described families of Raeder et al. (1Raeder H. Johansson S. Holm P.I. Haldorsen I.S. Mas E. Sbarra V. Nermoen I. Eide S.A. Grevle L. Bj⊘rkhaug L. Sagen J.V.

We therefore stably overexpressed the human CEL wild-type (CEL-WT) and mutant (CEL-MUT) proteins in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells and investigated the biosynthesis, glycosylation, secretion, and intracellular fate of the two protein variants. We cultured HEK293 cells (Clontech) in α-minimal essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 4 mm l-glutamine (Sigma), 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Subconfluent (70–80%) cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1/V5-His plasmids (see supplemental Methods and supplemental Fig. S1) containing CEL-WT, CEL-MUT, or the empty vector (EV) by FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions; a ratio of 3 μl of transfection reagent per μg of DNA was used. For stable CEL expression, we selected the cells with 500 μg/ml geneticin 418 (G418) (Invitrogen) in the culture medium for 18 days, followed by isolation of G418-resistant colonies. Cells with suitable CEL expression were clonally expanded, and clones with similar expression and transcription levels (supplemental Fig. S2) were chosen for further studies. We maintained the selected stable cell lines in culture medium containing 500 μg/ml G418. 3.5 × 105 HEK293 cells were seeded on polylysine-coated 35-mm dishes and grown in α-modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum for 24 h. We performed metabolic labeling by rinsing the cells stably expressing CEL-WT and CEL-MUT with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by incubation for 1 h in Met/Cys-free DMEM (Sigma) in the absence of serum, and with further incubation for 5 min in this medium supplemented with 110 μCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The monolayers were washed with PBS and chased in DMEM containing an excess of cold Met and Cys. To determine the effects of proteasomal (MG132, Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) and lysosomal (leupeptin, Sigma) protease inhibitors, cells were treated with the inhibitors for 3 h before the chase, and the inhibitors were also present throughout the chase at the following concentrations: 10 μm MG132 (dissolved in DMSO; vehicle control at an equal concentration of DMSO) and 100 μg/ml leupeptin. The cells were lysed in RIPA buffer, and the CEL protein was isolated by immunoprecipitation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (see supplemental Methods). Cell growth medium from stably transfected HEK293 cells (50 μl) was acetone-precipitated (medium/acetone, 1:4) at −20 °C for 1 h, and the proteins were recovered by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The acetone was evaporated, and the pelleted proteins were resuspended in SDS denaturation buffer (20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 1% (w/v) SDS, 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol) and incubated at 100 °C for 10 min. We treated the proteins with glycosidases at 37 °C for 18 h in 150 μl of a medium containing 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 20 mm EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 2 units of N-glycosidase F (Roche Diagnostics) or 2.5 milliunits of O-glycosidase (Roche Diagnostics) or 5 milliunits of neuraminidase (Roche Diagnostics). After incubation, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis (supplemental Methods) using the mouse anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen). Three 35-mm dishes of stably transfected HEK293 cells were metabolically labeled for 5 min and chased for 45 min. We lysed the cells in 333 μl/dish of FastBreak lysis buffer (Promega, San Luis Obispo, CA) and purified the CEL proteins using the MagneHis Protein purification system (V8500; Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The CEL proteins were eluted in 50 μl of 500 mm imidazole, 100 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, and native-PAGE sample buffer was added as recommended by Promega. After centrifugation at 435,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, the supernatants were analyzed by native-PAGE (Novex 3–12% BisTris gel, Invitrogen) run at 150 V for 1.5 h. The gels were fixed, dried, and the labeled bands detected by a phosphorimager. The 435,000 × g pellets were resuspended in a SDS-containing buffer and heated at 56 °C for 15 min prior to NuPAGE 4–12% BisTris gels (Invitrogen) at 150 V for 2 h. The gels were immunoblotted using rabbit anti-V5 (1:15,000) (V8137, Sigma) and goat anti-rabbit-HRP secondary antibody (1:20,000) (sc-2313, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at room temperature (RT). The CEL proteins were detected and the signals quantified using enhanced chemiluminescence on an imager. The HEK293 cells were cultured in 75-cm2 flasks until 80–90% confluent, washed, and harvested in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) and pelleted by centrifugation (300 × g for 5 min 4 °C). We resuspended the pellets in ice-cold homogenization medium (130 mm KCl, 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm egta, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini, Roche Diagnostics). Resuspended cells were homogenized by 20 passages through a ball-bearing cell cracker (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany) with a clearance of 0.01 mm, and the extent of breakage was checked by phase contrast microscopy (20Sannerud R. Marie M. Hansen B.B. Saraste J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 457: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the post-nuclear supernatant was recentrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Samples (0.6 ml) of the 3,000 × g supernatant and the pellet (resuspended in 0.6 ml homogenization medium) were treated with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 30 min and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C; the supernatants were referred to a Triton X-100-soluble CEL protein. The resulting pellets were finally solubilized by sonication in 5 m guanidine chloride buffered at pH 8 with 50 mm Tris, containing protease inhibitor mixture, incubated overnight at room temperature, and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatants, referred to as the Triton X-100-insoluble (guanidine chloride-soluble) CEL protein, were diluted 10-fold to reduce the concentration of denaturant. SDS-PAGE (10% gels) and immunoblot analysis were performed using the mouse anti-V5 primary antibody followed by HRP-conjugated donkey anti-mouse (sc-2314, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). We expressed human CEL-WT and CEL-MUT in vitro in a coupled transcription/translation system using rabbit reticulocyte (RRL) lysates (Promega) in a total reaction volume of 50 μl containing 40 μl of RRL, 2 μg of CEL-WT/CEL-MUT (in pcDNA3.1/HisB vector), 20 mm DTT, and 10 μCi of [35S]Met. Following incubation at 30 °C for 90 min, we stopped the synthesis by an excess of cold Met. The stability of CEL proteins was then assayed in a final volume of 100 μl containing 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 20 μm cold Met, 15 μl of [35S]Met-labeled CEL proteins, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 10 mm phosphocreatine, creatine phosphokinase (0.2 mg/ml), 2 μm ubiquitin, and 50 μl of freshly thawed RRL. Aliquots were removed at various time points (0–3 h), and the reactions were quenched by SDS sample buffer and heated at 56 °C for 15 min prior to SDS-PAGE (10% gel) analysis and autoradiography. The resulting stability graphs represent the average of three independent experimental series for both CEL proteins using different production numbers of the RRL system. The 14C-methylated protein standard contained myosin (220 kDa), phosphorylase b (97.4 kDa), BSA (66 kDa), ovalbumin (46 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (30 kDa), and lysozyme (14.3 kDa). HEK293 cells cultured on plastic culture dishes coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma) were grown to a confluency of 70–80%, washed with PBS, and fixed with periodate/lysine/paraformaldehyde fixative (21McLean I.W. Nakane P.K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1974; 22: 1077-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (3198) Google Scholar). The pre-embedding immunoperoxidase procedure used for staining of cells with affinity-purified CEL-specific monoclonal As20.1 and goat anti-mouse F(ab)2-fragments coupled HRP (BI3413C, P.A.R.I.S. Anticorps, Compiègne, France) has been described in detail by Brown (22Brown W.J. Immunoperoxidase Methods for Localization of Antigens in Cultured Cells and Tissues. 4.6.1–4.6.17. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Crossref Google Scholar). Thin sections of the immunolabeled cells, embedded in Epon 812 resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA), were stained with lead citrate and examined in a JEOL 1230 (Tokyo, Japan) electron microscope operated at 60 kV. Pancreatic juice was obtained from patients undergoing Whipple's procedure for resection of pancreatic tumor. After transection of the pancreas, the pancreatic duct was cannulated, and a sample of juice was suctioned out and immediately stored on liquid nitrogen. Duodenal juice was obtained by upper endoscopy (Olympus GIF 160, Hamburg, Germany). The procedure was initiated 25 min after stimulation with secretin (Secrelux, Sanochemia Diagnostics (Zug, Switzerland) 1 clinical units/kg, maximum 70 clinical units administered over 1 min), starting with thorough emptying of the ventricle to avoid contamination from gastric contents and continuing with duodenal intubation at 30 min after stimulation. The tip of the endoscope was placed distal to the papilla, and duodenal juice was collected through the suctioning channel as two 5-min aliquots after discharging the juice collected during the 1st min. The aliquots were immediately placed on ice. The samples were then centrifuged at 4400 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C in a table centrifuge and the pellets discarded. We used Complete Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics) to protect the samples (1 tablet dissolved in 1.5 ml of water, 0.2 ml of this solution was added per 1 ml of juice). The samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen within 2 h after they had been collected. This procedure was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Western Norway. All subjects had given informed, written consent to the study. The donors of pancreatic and duodenal juice were genotyped as described in Torsvik et al. (9Torsvik J. Johansson S. Johansen A. Ek J. Minton J. Raeder H. Ellard S. Hattersley A. Pedersen O. Hansen T. Molven A. Nj⊘lstad P.R. Hum. Genet. 2010; 127: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The intrinsically disordered regions in the CEL proteins were predicted by the computer algorithm VSL2P (23Obradovic Z. Peng K. Vucetic S. Radivojac P. Dunker A.K. Proteins. 2005; 61: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), and their propensity to self-associate was predicted by the computer algorithm TANGO (24Fernandez-Escamilla A.M. Rousseau F. Schymkowitz J. Serrano L. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1302-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar, 25Linding R. Schymkowitz J. Rousseau F. Diella F. Serrano L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). We used NetOGlyc 3.1 to explore the O-glycosylation sites and Compute pI/Mw (26Bjellqvist B. Basse B. Olsen E. Celis J.E. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 27Bjellqvist B. Hughes G.J. Pasquali C. Paquet N. Ravier F. Sanchez J.C. Frutiger S. Hochstrasser D. Electrophoresis. 1993; 14: 1023-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar) to determine the pI of the two proteins studied. Analysis of variance was used to analyze differences in gene expression between groups of cells transfected with different constructs. Post hoc pairwise comparisons (Bonferroni method) demonstrated significant effect at a level of 5% using Stata (version 11.0; Stata, College Station, TX). The 79-kDa human CEL-WT protein is characterized by two structural domains, an N-terminal globular catalytic core domain (residues 1–558), including a signal peptide (residues 1–23), and a C-terminal intrinsically highly disordered (random-coiled) extended arm of tandem repeats (TRs, residues 559–745) as shown schematically in Fig. 1A (see also supplemental Fig. S1). The 73-kDa CEL-MUT protein has the same core structure, but a c.1686delT mutation introduces a frameshift and causes a truncation of the protein resulting in a 72-residue shorter intrinsically disordered TR domain (residues 559–672). Moreover, in silico analyses of the frameshift mutation in the TR region of mutant CEL (Fig. 1B) revealed a marked increase in the theoretical pI of this domain, from pH 3.3 (WT) to 11.8 (MUT), because of a change in the charged residues from 17 Asp/5 Glu to 19 Arg. There is one N-glycosylation site predicted in the core domain (N210), and the total number of putative O-glycosylation sites at Thr residues in the TR units are predicted to be 36 (WT) and 11 (MUT) (NetOGlyc 3.1 (28Julenius K. M⊘lgaard A. Gupta R. Brunak S. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar)). However, the actual number and structure of the N- and O-glycans, when stably expressed in cells, have not been determined. In the presence of numerous O-glycans in the TR domain of CEL-WT, it may assume a rigid structure similar to the structurally related mucous glycoproteins (29Rose M.C. Voter W.A. Brown C.F. Kaufman B. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 30Marianne T. Perini J.M. Lafitte J.J. Houdret N. Pruvot F.R. Lamblin G. Slayter H.S. Roussel P. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). When the catalytic core domain of CEL is overexpressed in bacteria, it is recovered as inclusion bodies, which are insoluble in 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and require 8 m urea for their solubilization (31Terzyan S. Wang C.S. Downs D. Hunter B. Zhang X.C. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Moreover, the sequence-based computer algorithm TANGO (24Fernandez-Escamilla A.M. Rousseau F. Schymkowitz J. Serrano L. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1302-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar) predicts an aggregation propensity of several peptide segments in the core structure, of which two hydrophobic regions map to the surface in the three-dimensional structure (Protein Data Bank codes 1f6w and 1jmy) of CEL (Fig. 1C). Finally, the CEL-WT protein is a client protein for the ER molecular chaperone GRP94, forming an ∼1:1 complex that is stabilized by hydrophobic forces (11Bruneau N. Lombardo D. Bendayan M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2665-2679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the total number of O-glycosylation sites is predicted to be different for CEL-WT and CEL-MUT proteins, we examined this issue more closely in HEK293 cells. Following acetone precipitation of the growth medium, the CEL proteins were subjected to N-linked (N-glycosidase F) and/or O-linked (O-glycosidase and neuraminidase) deglycosylation treatment, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblot analysis (for a comparison of antibodies against CEL proteins, see supplemental Fig. S3, A and B). The analyses revealed that exposure to N-glycosidase F resulted in a slight increase in the relative mobility of both CEL proteins (Fig. 2), and incubations with O-glycosidase and neuraminidase gave an even larger mobility shift of the WT and the mutant protein. A truncated control variant of the CEL protein (TRUNC; p.Val563X), completely lacking the amino acids encoded by the VNTR region, exhibited only a small change in mobility after treatment with glycosidases. In sum, even though theoretical predictions of O-glycosylation sites in the mutated CEL showed loss of several O-glycosylation sites, both the wild-type and the mutant protein were found to be O-glycosylated when secreted from the cells. In the previous work of Raeder et al. (1Raeder H. Johansson S. Holm P.I. Haldorsen I.S. Mas E. Sbarra V. Nermoen I. Eide S.A. Grevle L. Bj⊘rkhaug L. Sagen J.V. Aksnes L. S⊘vik O. Lombardo D. Molven A. Nj⊘lstad P.R. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), it was indicated that the dysfunction caused by CEL-MUT could be due to decreased stability of the mutant protein (based on stable expression in CHO cells). Therefore, we used pulse-chase analysis to examine glycosylation, secretion, and degradation of CEL-WT and CEL-MUT stably expressed in HEK293 cells. After a 5-min pulse, the [35S]Met/Cys-labeled CEL proteins, immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, migrated as double bands on SDS-PAGE. A similar pattern has been reported for the rat CEL protein in an acinar cell line (AR4-2J) and interpreted as post-translational glycosylation at residue Asn-210 (32Abouakil N. Mas E. Bruneau N. Benajiba A. Lombardo D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25755-25763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During chase, the signal from the lowest band (low molecular mass) decreased, and a higher band, probably representing the O-glycosylated forms of the proteins, increased in strength (Fig. 3A, CEL-WT (upper left panel, arrow) and CEL-MUT (upper right panel, arrow)). Both CEL-WT (Fig. 3A, lower left panel) and CEL-MUT (lower right panel) were detectable in the medium after 15 min. The amount of 35S-CEL-WT and 35S-CEL-MUT, both intracellular (i.e. soluble in a combined Nonidet P-40/SDS/deoxycholate detergent medium) and extracellular, was determined by phosphorimaging as a function of chase time (Fig. 3B). The intensity of the bands of intracellular CEL-MUT peaked at ∼15 min chase (Fig. 3A, upper right panel). At 3 h chase, almost no trace of detergent-soluble cellular CEL-WT and CEL-MUT was observed. At the end point, ∼20% (MUT) and ∼30% (WT) of the initially labeled proteins were recovered in the growth medium. Replot of data in Fig. 3B, with a separate presentation of low molecular mass forms (arrowheads in Fig. 3A) and the high molecular mass forms (arrows in Fig. 3A), demonstrated a faster transition from the low to the high molecular mass form of the mutant CEL as compared with the WT. Subsequently, when the recovery of CEL-WT and CEL-MUT proteins was measured after 24 h chase, the secreted mutant protein appeared to be significantly more stable (p = 0.007) than the WT protein (Fig. 4, A and B).FIGURE 4Prolonged time course for the secretion of CEL. CEL-MUT protein appears to be more stable than the CEL-WT.

On native-PAGE analyses, some of the dissolved proteins did not enter the running gel, notably the samples with mutant CEL protein, and the protein samples were therefore centrifuged (435,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C), and the recovered supernatants were reexamined by native-PAGE and phosphorimager analysis (Fig. 5A). In contrast to the WT CEL protein, the mutant CEL revealed high molecular mass forms both intracellularly and in the growth medium, notably after 45 min of chase. The 435,000 × g precipitates were resuspended in sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis using mouse anti-V5 Ab (Fig. 5B). In Fig. 5B, the arrowheads mark the expected monomeric forms of the CEL proteins, and the arrows indicate SDS-resistant higher oligomeric forms of CEL-MUT.

Adiponectin is an adipose-derived, cardioprotective factor that is down-regulated in obesity. Here, we investigated the effect of adiponectin on doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity and assessed the mechanisms of this effect. A single dose of DOX was intraperitoneally injected into the abdomen of adiponectin knock-out (APN-KO) and wild-type (WT) mice. APN-KO mice had increased mortality and exacerbated contractile dysfunction of left ventricle compared with WT mice. APN-KO mice also showed increased apoptotic activity and diminished Akt signaling in the failing myocardium. Systemic delivery of adenoviral vector expressing adiponectin improved left ventricle dysfunction and myocardial apoptosis following DOX injection in WT and APN-KO mice but not in Akt1 heterozygous KO mice. In cultured rat neonatal cardiomyocytes, adiponectin stimulated Akt phosphorylation and inhibited DOX-stimulated apoptosis. Treatment with sphingosine kinase-1 inhibitor or sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor antagonist diminished adiponectin-induced Akt phosphorylation and reversed the inhibitory effects of adiponectin on myocyte apoptosis. Pretreatment with anti-calreticulin antibody reduced the binding of adiponectin to cardiac myocytes and blocked the adiponectin-stimulated increase in Akt activation and survival in cardiomyocytes. Interference of the LRP1/calreticulin co-receptor system by siRNA or blocking antibodies diminished the stimulatory actions of adiponectin on Akt activation and myocyte survival. These data show that adiponectin protects against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by its ability to promote Akt signaling.

However, its usefulness for this application can be limited by its ability to promote cardiotoxicity and heart failure (1Singal P.K. Iliskovic N. N. Engl. J.

Experimental studies showed that high fat diet-induced obese rats are highly sensitive to DOX-induced cardiotoxicity (4Mitra M.S. Donthamsetty S. White B. Mehendale H.M. Toxicol. Appl.

However, the mechanism by which obese organisms display enhanced sensitivity to DOX-mediated toxicity is unknown. Accumulating evidence indicates that dysregulation of adipocyte-derived hormones, also known as adipocytokines, promotes the development of various obesity-linked diseases (6Ouchi N. Kihara S.

Several experimental studies have shown that adiponectin protects against acute cardiac injury through its ability to attenuate myocyte apoptosis (14Shibata R. Sato K. Pimentel D.R. Takemura Y.

However, the signaling pathways leading to cardioprotection and receptors that mediate these actions of adiponectin are not well defined (16Denzel M.S. Scimia M.C. Zumstein P.M. Walsh K.

Saraste A. Pulkki K. Kallajoki M. Parvinen M. Voipio-Pulkki L.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1789-1792PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that adiponectin could modulate cardiac injury in response to DOX. Here, we investigated the effect of adiponectin on DOX-induced cardiomyopathy with loss- and gain-of-function genetic manipulations and assessed its molecular mechanisms. Recombinant human adiponectin protein obtained from a mammalian cell expression system was purchased from BioVendor. The following primary antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology: phospho-Akt (Ser-473) antibody, Akt antibody, cleaved caspase-3 antibody, caspase-3 antibody, and α-tubulin antibody. Calreticulin (CRT) antibody was purchased from Affinity BioReagents. Sarcomeric actinin antibody was from Sigma. LY294002 was purchased from Calbiochem. Sphingosine kinase (SphK)-1 inhibitor was purchased from Cayman Chemical. VPC23019 was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. DOX was provided as a generous gift by Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Adenovirus vectors containing the gene for β-galactosidase (Ad-β-gal) and full-length mouse adiponectin (Ad-APN) were prepared as described previously (14Shibata R. Sato K. Pimentel D.R. Takemura Y. Kihara S. Ohashi K. Funahashi T. Ouchi N. Walsh K. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 1096-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Male wild-type (WT), adiponectin knock-out (APN-KO) (11Maeda N. Shimomura I. Kishida K. Nishizawa H. Matsuda M. Nagaretani H. Furuyama N. Kondo H. Takahashi M. Arita Y. Komuro R. Ouchi N. Kihara S.

Mice were intraperitoneally injected with single dose of DOX (20 mg/kg) as described previously (18Weinstein D.M. Mihm M.J. Bauer J.A. J. Pharmacol Exp. Ther. 2000; 294: 396-401PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, 2 × 108 plaque-forming units (pfu) of Ad-APN or Ad-β-gal were systemically injected into the tail vein of mice 3 days before DOX injection (14Shibata R. Sato K. Pimentel D.R. Takemura Y. Kihara S. Ohashi K. Funahashi T. Ouchi N. Walsh K. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 1096-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Heart rate and blood pressure were determined using a tail cuff pressure analysis system (Softron, Tokyo, Japan). Survival of mice after DOX administration was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Nagoya University School of Medicine. We subjected surviving mice to transthoracic echocardiography to determine cardiac function and structure in the conscious state at day 5 after DOX injection (19Shibata R. Ouchi N. Ito M. Kihara S. Shiojima I. Pimentel D.R. Kumada M. Sato K. Schiekofer S. Ohashi K. Funahashi T. Colucci W.S. Walsh K. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 1384-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). To measure left ventricular (LV) systolic function and chamber dimensions, echocardiogram analysis was performed with an Acuson Sequoia C-256 machine using a 15-MHz probe. We quantified LV end systolic diameter (LVDs), LV end diastolic diameter (LVDd), and percent LV fractional shortening (%FS) from M-mode images. Primary cultures of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) were prepared as described previously (19Shibata R. Ouchi N. Ito M. Kihara S. Shiojima I. Pimentel D.R. Kumada M. Sato K. Schiekofer S. Ohashi K. Funahashi T. Colucci W.S. Walsh K. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 1384-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Isolated myocytes were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. Before each experiment, cells were placed in serum-free DMEM for 24 h. For the adiponectin stimulation studies, cells were treated with recombinant human adiponectin protein (10 μg/ml) for the indicated lengths of time. To determine the degree of apoptotic cells, NRVMs were preincubated with adiponectin protein (10 μg/ml) or vehicle for 60 min followed by treatment with DOX (1 μm) or vehicle for 24 h. Cell number and TUNEL-positive cells were examined as described previously (14Shibata R. Sato K. Pimentel D.R. Takemura Y. Kihara S. Ohashi K. Funahashi T. Ouchi N. Walsh K. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 1096-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). In some experiments, NRVMs were pretreated with LY294002 (50 μm) or CRT-neutralizing antibody (5 μg/ml) before adiponectin stimulation. For gene ablation studies, NRVMs were transfected with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting SphK-1, CRT, LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), AdipoR1, and AdipoR2 or unrelated siRNAs (Dharmacon Inc., Lafayette, CO) by Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Forty-eight hours after transfection, NRVMs were incubated with recombinant adiponectin protein for the indicated length of times. For detection of CRT, NRVMs were incubated with anti-CRT antibody (5 μg/ml) or control chicken IgY (5 μg/ml) for 60 min, stained with FITC-conjugated anti-chicken IgY, and analyzed by flow cytometric analysis. In some experiments, NRVMs were preincubated with 6 μg/ml FAM-labeled adiponectin (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals) for 60 min followed by incubation with anti-CRT antibody for 60 min. Fluorescence intensity was measured with a fluorescence microplate reader. LV tissues were obtained 5 days after DOX administration, embedded in OCT compound (Miles, Elkhart, IN), and frozen in liquid nitrogen. To determine myocardial apoptosis, we performed TUNEL staining using the In Situ Cell Death Detection kit (Roche Applied Science) as described previously (14Shibata R. Sato K. Pimentel D.R. Takemura Y. Kihara S. Ohashi K. Funahashi T. Ouchi N. Walsh K. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 1096-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). DAPI was used for nuclear staining. Anti-sarcomeric actinin antibody was used for determination of myocytes followed by TUNEL and nuclear staining. Ten randomly chosen microscopic fields from four different sections in each tissue block were examined for the presence of TUNEL-positive cells. Heart tissue samples obtained at 5 days after DOX administration were homogenized in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCI (pH 8.0), 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). NRVMs were lysed in the same component element buffer. Equal amounts of protein were separated with denaturing SDS, 10% polyacrylamide gels. The membranes were immunoblotted with the primary antibodies at a 1:1000 dilution followed by secondary antibody at a 1:5000 dilution. Bands were visualized using the ECL Western Blotting Detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Total RNA from cultured cells was prepared by using an RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Complementary DNA (cDNA) from 500 ng of total RNA was synthesized by using SuperScript RT-PCR Systems (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real time PCR (RT-PCR) analysis was performed on a CFX-96 system using EvaGreen as a double-stranded DNA-specific dye according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Primers were designed as follows: 5′-TCCCTGACCCTGATGCTAAGAAG-3′ and 5′-ATTGTGCCAGACTTGACCTGCC-3′ for rat CRT, 5′-GGACTTCAGTTATGCCAACG-3′ and 5′-GACTCAGGGAGATGTTGA-3′ for rat LRP1, 5′-CGTGGCCTTTATGCTGCTCG-3′ and 5′-TCTAGGCCGTAACGGAATTC-3′ for rat AdipoR1, 5′-CCACAACCTTGCTTCATCTA-3′ and 5′-GATACTGAGGGGTGGCAAAC-3′ for rat AdipoR2, and 5′-TCAAGAAGGTGGTGAAGCAG-3′ and 5′-AGGTGGAAGAATGGGAGTTG-3′ for GAPDH. The expression levels of examined transcripts were compared with that of GAPDH and normalized to the mean value of controls. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance followed by Tukey's honestly significant difference test. Calculation and statistical tests including Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival were performed using SPSS version 17 (SPSS Japan Inc.). A value of p < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. To test whether adiponectin modulates DOX-induced cardiomyopathy, we intraperitoneally injected APN-KO or WT mice with a single dose of DOX (20 mg/kg). Mortality after DOX injection is shown in Fig. 1A. APN-KO mice exhibited a significant increase in mortality after DOX injection compared with WT mice by Kaplan-Meier estimates (p = 0.02; Fig. 1A). Echocardiographic analysis at 5 days showed that DOX injection led to an increase in LVDs and a decrease in %FS in both APN-KO and WT mice without affecting LVDd (Fig. 1, B–E). APN-KO mice showed increased LVDs and decreased %FS compared with WT mice (Fig. 1, B, D, and E). LVDd did not differ after DOX injection between the two strains of mice (Fig. 1C). There were no significant differences in LVDd, LVDs, and %FS after vehicle injection between APN-KO and WT mice (Fig. 1, B–E). To test whether overexpression of adiponectin modulates LV contractile dysfunction in response to DOX injection, we systemically treated APN-KO and WT mice with Ad-APN or Ad-β-gal as a control via the tail vein 3 days before DOX injection. At the time of DOX injection, adiponectin levels were 21.2 ± 4.8 μg/ml in WT/Ad-APN, 12.9 ± 1.9 μg/ml in WT/control, 11.5 ± 1.5 μg/ml in APN-KO/Ad-APN, and <0.05 μg/ml in APN-KO/control. Ad-APN treatment significantly increased %FS following DOX injection in both WT and APN-KO mice (Fig. 1F). A previous study indicated that an increase in myocyte apoptosis contributes to the pathogenesis of DOX-induced cardiomyopathy (2Arola O.J. Saraste A. Pulkki K. Kallajoki M. Parvinen M. Voipio-Pulkki L.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1789-1792PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the extent of apoptosis in the heart, we performed TUNEL staining on hearts isolated from the different experimental sets of mice. Representative photographs of TUNEL-positive nuclei in the heart at day 5 after DOX injection are shown in Fig. 2A. Quantitative analysis revealed a significantly higher proportion of TUNEL-positive cells in the myocardium of APN-KO mice compared with WT mice after DOX injection, whereas few or no TUNEL-positive cells could be detected in the hearts of WT or APN-KO mice following vehicle injection (Fig. 2B). Administration of DOX led to an increase in the conversion of the proapoptotic proenzyme caspase-3 to the active cleaved form in WT hearts, but the magnitude of this induction was greater in APN-KO than WT mice (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2Adiponectin suppresses DOX-induced apoptosis in heart.

Ad-APN treatment decreased the frequencies of TUNEL-positive cells in both WT and APN-KO mice (Fig. 2D). The expression level of cleaved caspase-3 was also decreased by Ad-APN treatment (Fig. 2E). To analyze the antiapoptotic actions of adiponectin at the cellular level, primary cultures of rat neonatal ventricular myocytes were subjected to DOX treatment under conditions of serum deprivation for 24 h in the presence or absence of recombinant adiponectin protein, and then we performed TUNEL staining. Treatment with a physiological concentration of adiponectin diminished the frequency of TUNEL-positive cardiomyocytes in the absence of DOX (Fig. 2, F and G). DOX treatment increased the frequency of TUNEL-positive cardiomyocytes, which was inhibited by treatment with adiponectin (Fig. 2, F and G). Treatment with adiponectin also diminished the expression of cleaved caspase-3 in the presence or absence of DOX (Fig. 2H). Because it has been reported that DOX promotes cardiomyocyte apoptosis through modulation of Akt activity (20Negoro S. Oh H. Tone E. Kunisada K. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Kishimoto T. Yamauchi-Takihara K.

Consistent with previous observations (22Bian Y. Sun M. Silver M. Ho K.K. Marchionni M.A. Caggiano A.O. Stone J.R. Amende I. Hampton T.G. Morgan J.P. Yan X. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ.

The DOX-induced declines in Akt phosphorylation occurred to a greater degree in APN-KO mice than in WT mice (Fig. 3A). The expression level of total Akt protein did not differ between sham-treated WT and APN-KO mice. In cultured cardiac myocytes, treatment with adiponectin stimulated the phosphorylation of Akt in a time-dependent manner with maximal Akt phosphorylation occurring at 16 h (Fig. 3B). To test whether Akt is involved in the inhibitory effects of adiponectin on myocyte apoptosis, cardiac myocytes were pretreated with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, and DOX-induced apoptosis was assessed. Treatment with LY294002 reversed the inhibitory effects of adiponectin on the frequency of TUNEL-positive cells and caspase-3 activation after DOX stimulation (Fig. 3, C and D).FIGURE 3Adiponectin inhibits DOX-induced myocyte apoptosis via Akt signaling.

At the time of DOX injection, circulating adiponectin levels increased to a level 1.9 ± 0.4 times higher in Ad-APN-treated Akt1-KO mice than in Ad-β-gal-treated Akt1-KO mice (20.6 ± 5.0 and 11.9 ± 1.9 μg/ml, respectively; p < 0.05). Thus, adiponectin levels in the bloodstream of Ad-APN-treated Akt1-KO mice were similar to those of Ad-APN-treated WT mice at the time of DOX administration. In contrast to WT mice, treatment with Ad-APN did not improve the DOX-induced reduction of %FS in Akt1-KO mice (Fig. 3E). In addition, treatment with Ad-APN did not attenuate the increase in the extent of TUNEL-positive cardiomyocytes and caspase-3 activation in Akt-1 KO mice (Fig. 3, F and G). Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) exerts protective effects on cell survival through Akt signaling in various cell types including cardiac myocytes (24Osawa Y. Banno Y. Nagaki M. Brenner D.A. Naiki T.

Therefore, we assessed whether adiponectin regulates Akt activation through SphK, which converts sphingosine to S1P. Cardiac myocytes were pretreated with SphK-1 inhibitor followed by incubation with adiponectin or vehicle. Adiponectin-induced Akt phosphorylation was diminished by pretreatment with SphK-1 inhibitor (Fig. 4A). S1P receptors 1, 2, and 3 are expressed in cardiac myocytes (25Zhang J. Honbo N. Goetzl E.J.

In the present work, we have found that transcriptional activation of the oxidative stress-responsive heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1) and expression of heat shock proteins, including Hsp27, which is normally known to augment proteasomal p53 degradation, are inhibited in Adriamycin (doxorubicin)-resistant MCF-7 cells (MCF-7/adr). Such an endogenous inhibition of HSF-1 and Hsp27 in turn results in p53 mutation with gain of function in its transcriptional activity and accumulation in MCF-7/adr. Also, lack of HSF-1 enhances nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) DNA binding activity together with mutant p53 and induces MDR1 gene and P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1), resulting in a multidrug-resistant phenotype. Ectopic expression of Hsp27, however, significantly depleted both mutant p53 and NF-κB (p65), reversed the drug resistance by inhibiting MDR1/P-gp expression in MCF-7/adr cells, and induced cell death by increased G2/M population and apoptosis. We conclude from these results that HSF-1 inhibition and depletion of Hsp27 is a trigger, at least in part, for the accumulation of transcriptionally active mutant p53, which can either directly or NF-κB-dependently induce an MDR1/P-gp phenotype in MCF-7 cells. Upon Hsp27 overexpression, this pathway is abrogated, and the acquired multidrug resistance is significantly abolished so that MCF-7/adr cells are sensitized to Dox. Thus, clinical alteration in Hsp27 or NF-κB level will be a potential approach to circumvent drug resistance in breast cancer.

Thus, clinical alteration in Hsp27 or NF-κB level will be a potential approach to circumvent drug resistance in breast cancer. Development of a multidrug-resistant phenotype is a major obstacle to the successful treatment of breast cancer (1Schwabedissen H.E. Kroemer H.K. Handb. Exp.

Treat. 1999; 56: 187-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are two major pathways by which cancer cells acquire drug resistance, drug efflux and direct suppression of apoptosis. Drug efflux is due to increased plasma membrane accumulation of various ATP-binding cassette (ABC) 2The abbreviations used are: ABCATP binding cassetteMTT3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromideDoxdoxorubicinCMAC7-amino-4-chloromethylcoumarinEMSSAelectrolytic mobility supershift assay(s)SSBDsequence-specific DNA binding domainCTDC-terminal domain. transporters, including ABCB1, also known as P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which extrude the internalized drugs from the cancer cells (3Wu C.P.

Various approaches have been reported to overcome the drug efflux, including pharmacological inhibition of ABCs and modulation of endogenous regulators of MDR1 (6Szakács G. Paterson J.K. Ludwig J.A. Booth-Genthe C. Gottesman M.M. Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2006; 5: 219-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (2938) Google Scholar). Drug resistance is also acquired via direct suppression of apoptotic pathways due to accumulation of mutant p53 (mutp53) with “gain of function” (7Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 957-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2961) Google Scholar, 8Kamesaki S. Kamesaki H. Jorgensen T.J. Tanizawa A. Pommier Y. Cossman J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4251-4256PubMed Google Scholar) and increased expression of antiapoptotic proteins, such as BCl-2 (4Robert J. Larsen A.K. Biochimie. 1998; 80: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition to abrogating the proapoptotic function of wild type p53 (wtp53), these p53 missense mutations have been shown to have unusual gain of function properties both in vitro and in vivo (9Sigal A. Rotter V. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6788-6793PubMed Google Scholar, 10Zambetti G.P. Levine A.J. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 855-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 11Dittmer D. Pati S. Zambetti G. Chu S. Teresky A.K. Moore M. Finlay C. Levine A.J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Recent studies have established a link between these two pathways of drug resistance (12Bradshaw T.D. Chua M.S. Orr S. Matthews C.S. Stevens M.F. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 83: 270-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).

Mutant p53 has been found to be the prominent common mediator of both pathways (11Dittmer D. Pati S. Zambetti G. Chu S. Teresky A.K. Moore M. Finlay C. Levine A.J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Wild type p53 is generally known to repress the expression of the MDR1 gene, which codes for the ABC protein P-gp through interaction with basal transcription factors, such as TATA-binding protein (13Zastawny R.L. Salvino R. Chen J. Benchimol S. Ling V. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1529-1535PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutant p53 (both in the C and N termini) is still capable of interacting with TATA-binding protein but is unable to repress MDR1 transcription (14Farmer G. Friedlander P. Colgan J. Manley J.L. Prives C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4281-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 15Horikoshi N. Usheva A. Chen J. Levine A.J. Weinmann R. Shenk T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Indeed, mutant p53 has been demonstrated to activate the MDR1 promoter probably by both dominant negative and gain of function mechanisms (16Bähr O. Wick W. Weller M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 643-646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, understanding of the roles of other p53-dependent mediators of drug resistance, especially mediators of ABC induction, in breast cancer cells still remains elusive. In particular, the role of other co-effectors of MDR1 gene induction by mutant p53 needs to be identified for complete understanding of the MDR1 gene expression in MCF-7/adr cells. One of the potential mechanisms by which mutant p53 is involved in the regulation of MDR1 is via the activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) (17Schneider G. Henrich A. Greiner G. Wolf V. Lovas A. Wieczorek M. Wagner T. Reichardt S. von Werder A. Schmid R.M. Weih F. Heinzel T. Saur D. Krämer O.H. Oncogene. 2010; 29: 2795-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Previous studies have illustrated that NF-κB can independently activate MDR1 (18Deng L. Lin-Lee Y.C. Claret F.X. Kuo M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 413-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 19Ros J.E. Schuetz J.D. Geuken M. Streetz K. Moshage H. Kuipers F. Manns M.P. Jansen P.L. Trautwein C.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1945-1954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A binding site (CAAT) for NF-κB has been identified in the MDR1 promoter and has been proven to be involved in the transcriptional activation of MDR1 (21Ogretmen B. Safa A.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 22Ogretmen B. Safa A.R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutp53 expression was found to correlate positively with NF-κB activity in cancer cells (23Gulati A.P. Yang Y.M. Harter D. Mukhopadhyay A. Aggarwal B.B. Benzil D.L. Whysner J. Albino A.P. Murali R. Jhanwar-Uniyal M. Mol. Carcinog. 2006; 45: 26-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 24Scian M.J. Stagliano K.E. Anderson M.A. Hassan S. Bowman M. Miles M.F. Deb S.P. Deb S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10097-10110Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), even without external triggers. Constitutive NF-κB activity can be augmented by mutant p53 to transactivate the NF-κB2 gene, encoding the p100/p52 subunit of NF-κB (24Scian M.J. Stagliano K.E. Anderson M.A. Hassan S. Bowman M. Miles M.F. Deb S.P. Deb S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10097-10110Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 25Weisz L. Damalas A. Liontos M. Karakaidos P. Fontemaggi G. Maor-Aloni R. Kalis M. Levrero M. Strano S. Gorgoulis V.G. Rotter V. Blandino G. Oren M. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 2396-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Additionally, mutp53 was observed to have a pronounced effect on nuclear accumulation and retention of RelA (p65) upon cytokine exposure, and a strong correlation between mutp53 overexpression and nuclear p65 staining was demonstrated in tumors (26Weisz L. Zalcenstein A. Stambolsky P. Cohen Y. Goldfinger N. Oren M. Rotter V. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 8318-8327Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, a portion of the gain of function for mutp53 may involve a mutp53-dependent enhanced NF-κB oncogenic activity leading to the activation of the MDR1 gene. Hence, mutant p53 and NF-κB may have a strong relationship with other stress-responsive factors in the overall multidrug resistance scheme. Heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1) is a multifaceted factor that can participate in many stress-related transcriptional and translational activities in eukaryotic cells by binding to heat shock elements (HSE) in the promoters of many genes (27Dai C. Whitesell L. Rogers A.B. Lindquist S. Cell. 2007; 130: 1005-1018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Although HSF-1 is primarily associated with expression of heat shock proteins, it has also been found to be activated in response to oxidative stress, DNA damage, and other stress stimuli and to play key roles in stress-induced cell signaling cascades. Transcriptional activation of HSF-1 is complex, and it is regulated by multiple steps, including phosphorylations, trimerization, and translocation to the nucleus as well as acetylation/deacetylations by p300 and SIRT1 in the chromatin-bound state (28Westerheide S.D. Anckar J. Stevens Jr., S.M. Sistonen L. Morimoto R.I. Science. 2009; 323: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Because Dox is a DNA-damaging agent, it would be expected to activate HSF-1, but not much is known in regard to the role of HSF-1 in response to Dox. The MDR1 promoter region has been shown to have HSE, and HSF-1 can repress MDR1 gene expression (29Vilaboa N.E. Galán A. Troyano A. de Blas E. Aller P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24970-24976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar); however, it is not known how drug-induced HSF-1 activation regulates MDR1 gene expression in cancer cells. Although heat-shock proteins have ubiquitous functions (30Schneider J. Jimenez E. Marenbach K. Marx D. Meden H. Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 2967-2971PubMed Google Scholar), they could play a general role in the development of drug resistance. Expression of the small heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) is associated with the response of cancer cells to heat shock and chemotherapeutic drugs, through HSF-1 activation (31Ciocca D.R. Fuqua S.A. Lock-Lim S. Toft D.O. Welch W.J. McGuire W.L. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3648-3654PubMed Google Scholar, 32Huot J. Roy G. Lambert H. Chrétien P. Landry J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 5245-5252PubMed Google Scholar). Transient Hsp27 overexpression has been found to induce drug resistance by activating antiapoptotic pathways in different cancer models (33Garrido C. Mehlen P. Fromentin A. Hammann A. Assem M. Arrigo A.P. Chauffert B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 34Oesterreich S. Weng C.N. Qiu M. Hilsenbeck S.G. Osborne C.K. Fuqua S.A.

Weber L. Master J.R. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2446-2451PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of Hsp27 in the regulation of the ABC transporters is not clearly understood. We hypothesized that repeated and chronic exposure of cancer cells to Dox will silence the HSF-1 gene, and this response may suppress expression of Hsps with time, including Hsp27, which is critical in p53 protein homeostasis, and induce the MDR1 gene in MCF-7/adr cells. As such, overexpression of Hsp27 could potentially reverse the drug resistance in these cells. We have used MCF-7/adr cells as a model of drug resistance phenotype to test our hypothesis. Our results have shown that HSF-1 is very poorly expressed in MCF-7/adr cells, compared with MCF-7 cells, resulting in decreased expression of Hsp27. This was accompanied by an increase in p53, NF-κB, and P-gp. Hsp27 overexpression reversed the P-gp-mediated drug efflux and increased the Dox sensitivity in MCF-7/adr cells. We provide evidence for a novel mechanism involving Hsp27, mutp53, and NF-κB in the regulation of MDR1 gene expression. MCF-7/adr cells, derived from the parental drug-sensitive MCF-7 cells by stepwise selection with Dox, were kindly provided by Dr. Kapil Mehta (University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). To maintain the drug resistance phenotype, this cell was cultured in the presence of 1 μg/ml Dox in RPMI 1640 culture medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 10 mm glutamine, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air. Cell viability against Dox-induced toxicity was determined using an MTT assay in 96-well plates. MCF-7/adr cells were transfected with Hsp27-overexpressing vector or empty vector. 2000 cells in 300 μ1 of medium were added to each well (quadruplicate) in 96-well flat bottom tissue culture plates and treated with the desired concentration of Dox (in the range of 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 μg/ml). After a desired post-drug treatment time (24 or 48 h), an MTT assay was carried out as described previously (37Vedam K. Nishijima Y. Druhan L.J. Khan M. Moldovan N.I. Zweier J.L. Ilangovan G. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2010; 298: H1832-H1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The plasmid pCMV-SPORT6/Hsp27 was obtained by subcloning the full-length human Hsp27 cDNA (36Richards E.H. Hickey E. Weber L. Master J.R. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2446-2451PubMed Google Scholar) into the mammalian expression vector pCMV-SPORT6 (Open Biosystems). The gene was under control of the CMV promoter, allowing for constitutive expression of Hsp27. MCF-7/adr cells (2 × 106 cells/plate) were seeded in 100-mm plates and cultured for 24 h before transfection. Cells were transfected with pCMV-SPORT6/Hsp27 or control plasmids by mixing DharmaFect 4 transfection agent (20 μl) (Ambion Inc.) and plasmid (20 μg) in antibiotics free and reduced serum medium for 20 min at room temperature and then adding the mix to the cells. After overnight incubation, the cells were washed twice in medium and then incubated in fresh medium for 24 h before treating with drug for the desired time before harvesting for analysis. For whole cell lysates, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer (0.368 mg/ml, sodium orthovanadate, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 17 μg/ml aprotinin), and incubated on ice for 45 min, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm to remove cellular debris. Cytosolic and nuclear proteins were isolated using the NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction kit (Pierce) as follows. Cells were finely minced in cold cytosolic buffer and centrifuged twice at 1500 × g, and then the combined pellet was collected for nuclear isolation. Supernatant was centrifuged again at 20,000 × g for 20 min and was collected as the cytosolic fraction. Nuclear pellets were resuspended and homogenized with 10 volumes of nuclear buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 3.3 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm DTT, and 2.4 m sucrose) after centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatant was collected for use. 60 μg of total protein was resolved by 4–12% SDS-PAGE, unless stated otherwise, and transferred to PVDF membrane. Western blot analysis was performed using primary antibodies for Hsp27, phospho-Hsp27 (Stressgen, Victoria, Canada), Bax, BCl-2, p21, p53, GAPDH, PARP-1, caspase-9, caspase-7, caspase-3, phospho-p38 MAPK, phospho-MAPKAP-2, NF-κB p65, NF-κB p50, IκBα, IKKα (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), and P-gp (Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA) and detected using the appropriate HRP-labeled secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Each Western blot shown is representative of at least three separate experiments. To examine the intracellular distribution of Dox in MCF-7/adr cells, we used scanning confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510). The cells were cultured on coverslips treated with Dox for the desired time, washed with PBS, and examined using a confocal microscope. Images were collected using an LSM510 NLO confocal microscope with a C-Apo ×20 water immersion lens (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Dox fluorescence was determined by exciting with an argon laser at 488 nm, and the emission was collected through a 530-nm long pass filter. The same confocal settings (excitation, laser power, detector, gain, and pin hole) were used to image the MCF-7/adr- and Hsp27-overexpressing MCF-7/adr cells. Post-data acquisition image analysis was performed using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA). Cell images were analyzed as mean doxorubicin fluorescent intensity per pixel in a circular 314-pixel region of the nucleus or cytoplasm of the same cell (∼60 μm2). Multiple fields containing at least 15 cells/field were imaged in each experiment. MCF-7/adr cells were grown for 24 h (with and without Hsp27 overexpression) on coverslips and treated with Dox at different concentrations for 48 h, and then the cells were washed with PBS, fixed, and permeabilized for 30 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS with 0.25% Triton X-100. Cells were blocked with 5% BSA in TBS containing 0.01% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature, followed by the addition of primary mouse monoclonal NF-κB p65 (1:50) antibody prepared in blocking buffer on the coverslips for 1 h at room temperature. After washing four times with TBS containing Tween 20 at 0.05%, Alexafluor 488 tag conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:300) secondary antibody was added with Hoechst stain (10 μl/ml) for nuclei, and the slides were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Images were acquired at room temperature with an LSM510 NLO confocal microscope with a C-Apo ×20 and ×60 water immersion lens (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Post-data acquisition image analysis was performed using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). Cell images were analyzed as mean Alexafluor 488 intensity per pixel in a circular 314-pixel region of the nucleus or cytoplasm of the same cell (∼60 μm2). Multiple fields containing at least 15 cells/field were imaged in each experiment. Control and Dox-treated MCF-7/adr cells with or without Hsp27 overexpression were harvested at the indicated times, washed in ice-cold PBS, fixed in 2.0 ml of ice-cold ethanol (75%), and left at −20 °C overnight. After overnight fixation, cells were washed and resuspended in 1.0 ml of PBS. Further, DNase-free bovine pancreas RNase (Sigma-Aldrich; 10 μl, final concentration 1 mg/ml) and propidium iodide 10 μl (10 mg/ml) were added to 1.0 ml of cell suspension in the dark. Cell suspensions were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and analyzed using a BD FACSCalibur at 617-nm emission wavelength. The DNA content-frequency histogram was analyzed using FlowJo version 8.8.6 software and used to calculate the percentage of cells in respective phases of the cell cycle. One million cells of MCF-7/adr or MCF-7/adr/Hsp27 were treated with Dox alone (1, 5, and 10 μg/ml) or Dox + 25 μm CMAC for 48 h. The intracellular fluorescence of Dox and CMAC were measured using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The parameters of fluorescence recording for Dox were as follows: excitation wavelength, 488 nm; emission wavelength, 576 nm; shutter 100; rate, 500 cells/s; number of analyzed events, 10,000. For CMAC, excitation and emission wavelengths were 353 and 466 nm, respectively. Histograms were analyzed using the FlowJo version 8.8.6 software by the parameters of average fluorescence of cells in the population studied. The mRNA levels of HSF-1 and P-gp in control MCF-7 and MCF-7/adr cells were determined by RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted using the standard procedure provided by the manufacturer. The cells were collected from control and different post-drug treatment time points, and nuclear proteins were extracted using a nuclear protein extraction kit (NE-PER) from Pierce. EMSA for HSF-1 was performed using an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to a double-stranded HSE consensus sequence, labeled with biotin on the 5′-end (5′-biotin-CTAGAAGCTTCTAGAAGCTTCTAG-3′). For each sample, 15 μg of extracted nuclear protein was added with 20 fmol of biotin-HSE, 2.5% glycerol, 50 ng/μl poly(dI-dC), and 5 mm MgCl2 provided in the EMSA kit (Pierce). In control experiments, an HSE oligonucleotide devoid of biotin tag was used. In EMSSA assays, monoclonal HSF-1 antibody was used. This sample complex was incubated at room temperature for 20 min, and 5× loading buffer was added. The prepared samples were resolved by electrophoresis on 6% precast DNA retardation gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to a nylon membrane. The transferred DNA was cross-linked to the membrane with a hand-held UV lamp equipped with 254-nm bulbs for 5 min at a distance ∼0.5 cm from the membrane. Finally, the biotin-labeled DNA was detected by chemiluminescence as per the protocol in the chemiluminescent nucleic acid detection module (Pierce). Two different MDR1 promoter fragments were generated from MCF-7/adr cell genomic DNA as a template (21Ogretmen B. Safa A.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 22Ogretmen B. Safa A.R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Wild type MDR1 promoter fragment spanning 198 to +43 and mutant MDR1 promoter fragment −155 to +43 (HSF-1 binding motif deletion) were generated using the primers (supplemental Tables 1 and 2) with HindIII restriction sites. The PCR amplification products were digested with HindIII, inserted into pGL3B (Promega, Madison, WI), and sequenced (supplemental Fig. 3). Transfection was performed using the LipofectamineTM reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were seeded in 10-cm plates at a density of 105 cells/plate. The next day, the cells were incubated for 5 h with 1 ml of reduced serum medium containing 5 μg of pGL3B, wild type MDR1-luc, and mutant MDR1-luc plasmids. Following transfection, the mixture was removed, and the cells were incubated under standard conditions for 24 h, after which cells were harvested and subjected to luciferase activity assays by using a Luciferase Assay System Freezer Pack kit (Promega) and a Centro XS3 Luminometer (Berthold Technologies). The values were normalized to protein concentration. Normalization of the transfection efficacy was performed using a chemiluminescent reporter gene assay system to detect β-galactosidase (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA). Data analysis was performed using Student's t test and one-way analysis of variance. Data are presented as means ± S.E. The general acceptance level of significance was p < 0.05. In Dox-sensitive MCF-7 cells, the basal level of HSF-1 and its target protein, Hsp27, were found to be significant, whereas there were only trace amounts of HSF-1 and Hsp27 detected in the Dox-resistant MCF-7/adr cells (Fig. 1A). This is contrary to the largely known fact that Hsp27 overexpression can cause drug resistance in cancer cells (38Kamada M. So A. Muramaki M. Rocchi P. Beraldi E. Gleave M. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2007; 6: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Hsp70, another antiapoptotic Hsp, did not show any significant difference between MCF-7 and MCF-7/adr cells. Because Hsp27 is known to accelerate proteasomal degradation of wtp53 in cancer cells (39O'Callaghan-Sunol C. Gabai V.L. Sherman M.Y. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 11779-11788Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), we determined the levels of p53 expression. A large increase in p53 was observed in MCF-7/adr cells at resting conditions, compared with the Dox-sensitive MCF-7 cells, which had no detectable p53 under identical conditions (Fig. 1A). Because p53 is a ubiquitous protein, at normal conditions there will not be any wtp53 detectable (40Kanagasabai R. Karthikeyan K. Vedam K. Qien W. Zhu Q. Ilangovan G. Mol. Cancer Res. 2010; 8: 1399-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The detected p53 in MCF-7/adr cells has been characterized previously (21Ogretmen B. Safa A.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 22Ogretmen B. Safa A.R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) as mutant p53 with the P72R point mutation and deletion of 126–133 residues but with retention of the full C-terminal domain (nuclear localization signal) (22Ogretmen B. Safa A.R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The absence of Hsp27 probably contributes to the stability through the mutations and accumulation of p53 in MCF-7/adr cells (39O'Callaghan-Sunol C. Gabai V.L. Sherman M.Y. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 11779-11788Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Additionally, NF-κB showed a considerably higher expression in the MCF-7/adr cells. Because of the known involvement of both NF-κB and HSF-1 in the regulation of the MDR1 gene, we sought to determine the expression of P-gp. Indeed, Western blot analysis of P-gp showed high levels in MCF-7/adr cells, whereas in MCF-7 cells, there was no P-gp observed (Fig. 1A). RT-PCR indicated that the observed changes in expression of both HSF-1 and P-gp induced by chronic Dox exposure were due to changes in transcription (Fig. 1C). EMSA experiments showed no HSF-1 binding to HSE consensus oligonucleotides in nuclear extracts from MCF-7/adr cells, confirming that the observed decrease in HSF-1 protein in MCF-7/adr cells was accompanied by a decrease in functional HSF-1 (Fig. 1B). Thus, we conclude that inhibition of HSF-1 transcriptional activity produces the observed abrogation of Hsp27 expression in MCF-7/adr cells. These results establish that accumulation of mutp53 suppresses constitutive expression of HSF-1 (or vice versa) and Hsp27, resulting in higher expression of NF-κB p65 and P-gp expression (Fig. 1A), as further supported below. To prove the causal relationship between NF-κB, HSF-1, and MDR1, additional experiments with a reporter gene assay were carried out. MDR1 promoter fragment was generated as described before (21Ogretmen B. Safa A.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 22Ogretmen B. Safa A.R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). MDR1 promoter has both CAAT (−116 to −113 bp; a putative NF-κB binding site) and GAACATTC (−175 to −167 bp; an HSF-1 binding motif) (21Ogretmen B. Safa A.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 22Ogretmen B. Safa A.R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) sequences, indicating that both NF-κB and HSF-1 can bind to the promoter. Two MDR1 promoter fragments, the whole sequence (241 bp) and an HSF-1 binding site motif-deleted promoter fragment (200 bp), were cloned into the pGL3B luciferase vector, and luciferase activity was determined in MCF-7 and MCF-7/adr cells (Fig. 1D). MCF-7/adr cells showed, expectedly, about 10-fold higher luminescence than MCF-7 cells. Interestingly, in MCF-7 cells, deletion of the HSF-1 motif enhanced the luminescence, whereas the MCF-7/"
https://openalex.org/W2170968480,"Dynamic reciprocal interactions between a tumor and its microenvironment impact both the establishment and progression of metastases. These interactions are mediated, in part, through proteolytic sculpting of the microenvironment, particularly by the matrix metalloproteinases, with both tumors and stroma contributing to the proteolytic milieu. Because bone is one of the predominant sites of breast cancer metastases, we used a co-culture system in which a subpopulation of the highly invasive human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, with increased propensity to metastasize to bone, was overlaid onto a monolayer of differentiated osteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells in a mineralized osteoid matrix. CLIP-CHIP® microarrays identified changes in the complete protease and inhibitor expression profile of the breast cancer and osteoblast cells that were induced upon co-culture. A large increase in osteoblast-derived MMP-13 mRNA and protein was observed. Affymetrix analysis and validation showed induction of MMP-13 was initiated by soluble factors produced by the breast tumor cells, including oncostatin M and the acute response apolipoprotein SAA3. Significant changes in the osteoblast secretomes upon addition of MMP-13 were identified by degradomics from which six novel MMP-13 substrates with the potential to functionally impact breast cancer metastasis to bone were identified and validated. These included inactivation of the chemokines CCL2 and CCL7, activation of platelet-derived growth factor-C, and cleavage of SAA3, osteoprotegerin, CutA, and antithrombin III. Hence, the influence of breast cancer metastases on the bone microenvironment that is executed via the induction of osteoblast MMP-13 with the potential to enhance metastases growth by generating a microenvironmental amplifying feedback loop is revealed."
https://openalex.org/W2000320174,"Cell cycle progression for the spherical microbe Staphylococcus aureus requires the coordinated synthesis and remodeling of peptidoglycan. The majority of these rearrangements takes place at the mid-cell, in a compartment designated the cross-wall. Secreted polypeptides endowed with a YSIRK-G/S signal peptide are directly delivered to the cross-wall compartment. One such YSIRK-containing protein is the murein hydrolase LytN. lytN mutations precipitate structural damage to the cross-wall and interfere with staphylococcal growth. Overexpression of lytN also affects growth and triggers rupture of the cross-wall. The lytN phenotype can be reversed by the controlled expression of lytN but not by adding purified LytN to staphylococcal cultures. LytN harbors LysM and CHAP domains, the latter of which functions as both an N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase and D-alanyl-glycine endopeptidase. Thus, LytN secretion into the cross-wall promotes peptidoglycan separation and completion of the staphylococcal cell cycle."

Both mRNAs and proteins of all four DNA polymerases were constitutively expressed in all growth phases. Dpo2 and Dpo3 possessed very low DNA polymerase and 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activities in vitro. Steady-state kinetic efficiencies (kcat/Km) for correct nucleotide insertion by Dpo2 and Dpo3 were several orders of magnitude less than Dpo1 and Dpo4. Both the accessory proteins proliferating cell nuclear antigen and the clamp loader replication factor C facilitated DNA synthesis with Dpo3, as with Dpo1 and Dpo4, but very weakly with Dpo2. DNA synthesis by Dpo2 and Dpo3 was remarkably decreased by single-stranded binding protein, in contrast to Dpo1 and Dpo4. DNA synthesis in the presence of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, replication factor C, and single-stranded binding protein was most processive with Dpo1, whereas DNA lesion bypass was most effective with Dpo4.

Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W.H. Freeman, New York1992Google Scholar). An important issue in understanding chromosomal DNA replication is why so many different kinds of DNA polymerases exist and how they function differently and can be regulated in cells, with the discovery of at least 10 new human DNA polymerases during the past 12 years (2Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. Wood R.D. Schultz R.A. Ellenberger T. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.2006Google Scholar). Numerous DNA polymerases from the bacterial, eukaryal, and archaeal domains of life are divided into six families (A, B, C, D, X, and Y) (3Rothwell P.J. Waksman G. Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 71: 401-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), some of which have been suggested to be utilized for replicative and/or non-replicative tasks, such as DNA repair, translesion DNA synthesis, and hypermutation (4Hubscher U. Maga G. Spadari S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 133-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), but their precise roles are still in question. The information-processing systems of eukarya are considered to be more similar to those of archaea rather than to bacteria (5Rivera M.C. Lake J.A.

Evol. 2008; 25: 1619-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), offering a practical advantage of studying archaeal systems as a model for DNA replication. Indeed, many of the B-family DNA polymerases in eukaryotes and archaea, but not in bacteria, are believed to be mainly involved in chromosomal DNA replication (7Böhlke K. Pisani F.M. Rossi M. Antranikian G. Extremophiles. 2002; 6: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Crenarchaeota has only B-family (but at least two) replicative DNA polymerases, whereas Eryarchaeota has one B-family and one D-family replicative DNA polymerase (7Böhlke K. Pisani F.M. Rossi M.

S. solfataricus P2 encodes three B-family DNA polymerases, B1 (Dpo1), B2 (Dpo2), and B3 (Dpo3), which appear to be similar to eukaryotic systems possessing multiple B-family members (e.g. DNA polymerases α, δ, ϵ, and ζ), in addition to the Y-family member DNA polymerase Y1 (Dpo4). Dpo1 has been reported to catalyze DNA polymerization with high fidelity but is blocked at DNA lesions (11Grúz P. Shimizu M. Pisani F.M. De Felice M. Kanke Y. Nohmi T.

However, catalytic functions of two other B-family DNA polymerases, Dpo2 and Dpo3, have not been biochemically characterized, although the nucleotide sequences of Dpo2 and Dpo3 genes were first reported in the 1990s (9She Q.

In this study, we successfully purified recombinant Dpo2 and Dpo3 proteins and analyzed their in vitro biochemical properties, in comparison with (recombinant) Dpo1 and Dpo4, in order to elucidate the functional roles of four different DNA polymerases in an archaeal DNA replication system. We also analyzed in vivo expression profiles of the four DNA polymerases and their replication accessory factors during culture. Dpo2 and Dpo3 were found to exhibit low DNA polymerase and 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activities, low thermostability, weak DNA binding, and the eccentric property of severe inhibition by SSB in vitro, in contrast to Dpo1 and Dpo4. Both Dpo2 and Dpo3 bypassed some deaminated and oxidative base lesions, whereas only Dpo3 (and not Dpo2) bypassed a thymine dimer.

The Dpo2 (carboxyl-end), Dpo3, RFC-small, RFC-large, and SSB genes were obtained by PCR amplification from the genomic DNA of S. solfataricus P2 (ATCC, Mansassas, VA) as template using AccuTaq LA DNA polymerase (Sigma) with five pairs of primers: 5′-GGATCCATGGGCTTTGGCGGAGGAAT-3′ and 5′-TTAACACCTAGACATCACCTC-3′ for Dpo2 (carboxyl-end) (GenBankTM accession number NP_342896); 5′-GGATCCATGATTAAGGATTTCTTTAT-3′ and 5′-TTATTTCTTCTTAGAAGCTC-3′ for Dpo3 (NP_341651); 5′-GGATCCGATGAGCACGAAGGTCGAAGA-3′ and 5′-CTGCAGTCATCTATTCTCACTGCCTA-3′ for RFC-small (NP_342275); 5′-CATATGATACAATGGTTTTTAAA-3′ and 5′-AGATCTCTAAGATTTAGATATGGAAC-3′ for RFC-large (NP_342276); 5′-CATATGCATCACCACCATCATCACATGGAAGAAAAAGTAGGTAA-3′ and 5′-GAATTCTCACTCCTCTTCACCTTCTT-3′ for SSB (NP_343725). The resulting PCR products of 1.7-kb Dpo2 (carboxyl-end), 5The current GenBankTM information lists two “Dpo2” genes with 68 overlapping bases, termed the carboxyl-end (NP_342896, 66-kDa protein) and amino-end (NP_342897, 10.4-kDa protein) genes. In cloning, the cDNA corresponding to the former could be amplified using primers, but a fused cDNA could not. Our immunoblot analyses showed only a protein of 65 kDa in the S. solfataricus cultures (at all time points). Thus, we conclude that the 66-kDa protein we expressed should be the intact Dpo2 DNA polymerase found in the organism; the assignment of NP_342897 (N-terminal, 10.4 kDa) as part of Dpo2 appears ambiguous. 2.3-kb Dpo3, 1-kb RFC-small, 1.2-kb RFC-large, and 0.5-kb SSB genes were cloned into the vector pCR 2.1 Topo, and the nucleotide sequences were determined (in the Vanderbilt facility) to confirm the coding regions, and sequence errors causing amino acid substitutions were corrected using site-directed mutagenesis. The Dpo2 (carboxyl-end) or Dpo3 gene fragment was then cloned into the BamHI and NotI sites of the vector pBG101 or pNR111 (obtained from the Center for Structural Biology, Vanderbilt University), generating the pBG101-Dpo2 and pNR111-Dpo3 vectors encoding an N-terminal GST-tagged Dpo2 (carboxyl-end) or Dpo3. The synthetic codon-optimized Dpo3 gene (constructed with the use of DNAWorks) was also used as template for construction of the pNR111-Dpo3-OPT vector. The RFC-small and RFC-large gene fragments were cloned into the BamHI and PstI sites and the NdeI and BglII sites, respectively, of the bicistronic vector pETDuet-1 (Novagen, Madison, WI), generating the pETDuet-1-RFC-small/RFC-large vector encoding both an N-terminal His6-tagged RFC small subunit and an RFC large subunit. The SSB gene fragment was cloned into the NdeI and EcoRI sites of the vector pET-22b(+) (Novagen), generating the pET-22b(+)-SSB-NHis6 vector encoding the N-terminal His6-tagged SSB. Recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). E. coli BL21(DE3)-RIL harboring each vector for the recombinant protein was grown in Luria-Bertani broth supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml for RFC and SSB) or kanamycin (50 μg/ml for Dpo2 and Dpo3) at 37 °C, with aeration, to an OD600 of 0.6. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to 0.2 mm (for Dpo2 and Dpo3) or 0.5 mm (for RFC and SSB), and incubation was continued for 12 h at 16 °C (for Dpo2 and Dpo3) or for 3 h at 37 °C (for RFC and SSB). The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol (v/v), 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)), cooled on ice for 30 min, and then lysed by sonication (12 × 10-s duration with a Branson digital sonifier microtip, (VWR, West Chester, PA), 45% amplitude, with intervening cooling time). The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 4 × 104 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. For Dpo2 or Dpo3 purification, the resulting supernatant was loaded onto a 1-ml GSTrap 4B column, and the column was washed with 20 ml of Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol (v/v), and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). GST-tagged Dpo2 or Dpo3 bound on the column was cleaved by Prescission Protease (for Dpo2) or TEV protease (for Dpo3) for 14 h at 4 °C. Cleaved Dpo2 or Dpo3 was eluted with Buffer A, and the purity was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining. The yields of Dpo2 and Dpo3 were about 25 and 125 μg, respectively, from 1 liter of each culture. For RFC or SSB purification, each cell extract was loaded onto a HisTrap HP column, and the column was washed with Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol (v/v), and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 50 mm imidazole. His-tagged RFC and SSB fractions were eluted with buffer B containing 400 mm imidazole. SSB was further purified with the use of a heparin column and an NaCl gradient; SSB was eluted with ∼700 mm NaCl. RFC was further purified with a Superdex 200 column (10 × 300 mm); the RFC complex (small subunit/large subunit, 4:1) was eluted at ∼11 ml, corresponding to a previous report (21Pisani F.M. De Felice M. Carpentieri F. Rossi M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The yields of RFC and SSB were about 140 μg and 1.5 mg, respectively, from 1 liter of each culture. An SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretogram of each of the purified proteins is shown (Fig. 1). Polyclonal antibodies were raised in New Zealand White rabbits by Covance (Denver, PA) using the company's standard protocol, with 1–3 animals per antigen, depending on the amount available. The first injection (subcutaneously) was with 250 μg of each antigen, emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant. After 21 days, each rabbit was boosted with another 125 μg of the same adjuvant emulsified in Freund's incomplete adjuvant (subcutaneously). Ten days following the boost, 20 ml of serum was collected from each rabbit (first bleed). Another 18 days later each rabbit was boosted subcutaneously with another 125 μg of antigen emulsified in Freund's incomplete adjuvant, and 10 days later the rabbits were killed, and 50 ml of serum was collected. Both bleeds of serum were tested for specificity and titer. Characterization of the antisera was done by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/immunoelectrophoretic blotting. A panel of all antigens (1 μg of protein for each, in individual wells) was used. The general procedure was as described previously (24Guengerich F.P. Wang P. Davidson N.K. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1698-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), except that 0.05% Tween 20 (w/v) was used in place of BSA in the buffers (25Soucek P. Martin M.V. Ueng Y.F. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16013-16021Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and 4-chloro-1-naphthol was used as the peroxidase substrate instead of diaminobenzidine (26Guengerich F.P. Turvy C.G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1991; 256: 1189-1194PubMed Google Scholar). All antisera were used at a dilution of 1:400 (v/v) in testing. Based on the specificity of the antisera (supplemental Fig. S2), one antiserum preparation from each set was selected for use in the immunoquantitation studies. When cross-reactivity was an issue, the differences in Mr allowed analyses to be done, except in the case of PCNA subunits 1 and 2 (which cross-reacted and could not be distinguished by Mr). In that case, the quantitation was collective for PCNA1 and PCNA2, and PCNA3 was measured separately. S. solfataricus strain P2 (ATCC® 35092TM) cells were cultured at 80 °C in DSM 182/ATCC1304 media (ATCC 35092 Product Information Sheet) (27Robb F.T. Place A.R. Robb F.T. Place A.R. Archaea: A Laboratory Manual. Vol. 3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Woodbury, NY1995: 167-188Google Scholar) with the pH adjusted to 3.0 by the addition of H2SO4. Growth was monitored by measuring A600. RNA from S. solfataricus strain P2 was extracted at time points between 15 and 46 h (log phase; Fig. 2) and purified using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) according to the manufacturer's directions. mRNA integrity was checked by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. Concentrations of mRNA samples were measured using a NanoDrop ND-2000 device (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE). RNA samples were treated with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen), followed by a clean-up step with an RNeasy minikit to remove genomic DNA contamination (Qiagen). RT-PCR was carried out using a Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit with 20 ng of RNA as the template and a 7 S rRNA gene fragment as the co-amplified internal control. The gene-specific primers used are listed in supplemental Table S2. PCR products were separated on 2% agarose (w/v) gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining (supplemental Fig. S1). Images were analyzed with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Cell pellets from a S. solfataricus strain P2 time course culture were resuspended in 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) solubilization buffer containing 30% glycerol (v/v), 3% SDS (w/v), and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Total cellular protein was isolated by sonication (6 × 15 s, Branson sonicator with microtip, 45% amplitude) followed by centrifugation (2.7 × 104 × g, 4 °C, 20 min). Protein concentrations were measured with a bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce BCA protein assay kit, Thermo Scientific). Protein extracts (30 μg for Dpo2 and Dpo4, 5 μg for other proteins) and purified standards (2-fold serial dilutions from 6.4 ng to 400 pg) were separated on 4–20% (w/v) TGX gradient gels (Bio-Rad). The general transfer procedure was as described previously (24Guengerich F.P. Wang P. Davidson N.K. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1698-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), with 0.05% Tween 20 (w/v) in the buffers (see above). Each membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with a rabbit polyclonal antibody and then 45 min at room temperature with an IRDye 680LT-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). The membrane was scanned, and the image was analyzed on an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR) according to the manufacturer's protocol (supplemental Fig. S3). Unless indicated otherwise, standard DNA polymerase reactions were performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml BSA (w/v), and 10% glycerol (v/v) with 100 nm primer-template at 37 °C. For the assays measuring heat stability and temperature effect, potassium HEPES was used as a buffering agent instead of highly temperature-sensitive Tris. Primers were 5′-end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase with [γ-32P]ATP and annealed with template. All polymerase reactions were initiated by the addition of dNTPs and MgCl2 (10 mm final concentration) to preincubated enzyme/DNA mixtures. Exonuclease reactions were initiated by the addition of MgCl2 (10 mm final concentration) without dNTPs. A 32P-labeled primer, annealed to either an unmodified or adducted template, was extended in the presence of all four dNTPs (100 μm each) for 15 or 30 min. Reaction mixtures (8 μl) were quenched with six volumes of a solution of 20 mm EDTA in 95% formamide (v/v). Products were resolved using an 8 or 16% polyacrylamide (w/v) gel electrophoresis system containing 8 m urea and visualized using a Bio-Rad Personal Molecular Imager FX and Quantity OneTM software (Bio-Rad). A 21-mer primer was 5′-[γ-32P]ATP end-labeled (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and annealed to the 36-mer DNA template before being added to reactions (8 μl) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol (v/v) with 100 nm primer-template; either 4–200 nm Dpo1, 1.5–3 μm Dpo2, 0.5–1.5 μm Dpo3, or 0.1–8 nm Dpo4; and increasing concentrations of individual dNTPs. The amount of DNA polymerase in the reactions yielded ≤20% extended product (in order to maintain initial velocity conditions). Incubations were at 37 °C for 10, 60, or 90 min, depending on the polymerase and dNTP being used, and quenched with six volumes of a solution of 20 mm EDTA in 95% formamide, 0.02% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.02% (w/v) xylene cyanol dye solution. Extension products were separated on 8 m urea, 16% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels, visualized using a phosphorimaging system, and quantified using Quantity OneTM software (Bio-Rad). The extended product bands were used to estimate the kinetic parameters Km and kcat by non-linear regression fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Graph Pad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Relative insertion frequencies were calculated as (kcat/Km)incorrect/(kcat/Km)correct (28Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14689-14696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Increasing concentrations of each polymerase were incubated with 10 nm 32P-24-mer·36-mer primer-template DNA on ice for 15 min in the binding buffer, which contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 4 °C), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (w/v), and 5% glycerol (v/v). The mixtures were directly loaded on non-denaturing 3.5% polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed at 8 V/cm for 40 min at 4 °C in the running buffer (40 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.0 at 4 °C) containing 5 mm magnesium acetate and 0.1 mm EDTA). Gels were imaged using a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX instrument. Initial trials using an N-terminal His6 tag with a pET-22b(+) vector system were not successful for the expression and purification of Dpo2 and Dpo3, due to the very low expression levels and the loss of proteins during purification. We changed to a PreScission or TEV protease-cleavable N-terminal GST tag generating a pBG101 or pNR111 system to increase the expression yield and minimize the purification time, which proved to be successful for obtaining full-length 66-kDa Dpo2 protein (carboxyl-end)5 but not Dpo3. Thereafter, we used a synthetic Dpo3 gene with an optimized sequence (instead of the native sequence of the gene) to enhance the heterologous protein expression in E. coli, which proved to be a successful strategy for obtaining full-length 88-kDa Dpo3 protein (Fig. 1). A growth curve for S. solfataricus (80 °C, pH 3) showed the classic lag, exponential, and stationary phases over the course of 72 h (Fig. 2). Analysis of mRNA levels of the 10 genes studied showed relatively limited changes between 15 and 46 h, during the exponential phase (Fig. 3). The only appreciable change was a 2-fold decrease in the level of mRNA for PCNA3 (Fig. 3C). Polyclonal antibodies were raised against the 10 proteins of interest, and the most selective of these (supplemental Fig. S2) were used to quantify these proteins during the exponential growth phase (Fig. 4). As with RNA, any temporal changes were not major over the course of 15–46 h, with only some decreases seen for Dpo1, Dpo2, Dpo4, and SSB (Fig. 4, A–C) and an increase for Dpo3 (Fig. 4C) (in contrast to the RNA pattern; Fig. 3B). One point of interest is that the expression levels of Dpo1 and Dpo3 were an order of magnitude higher than for Dpo2 and Dpo4. A primer extension assay using an unmodified 21-mer primer·36-mer template complex and all four dNTPs was carried out in order to verify the DNA polymerase activities of Dpo2 and Dpo3, in comparison with Dpo1 and Dpo4 (Fig. 5). Both Dpo2 and Dpo3 showed primer extension activities, which were much lower than for Dpo1 or Dpo4. Even 0.8 μm Dpo2 and 4 μm Dpo3 yielded only partially extended products, ranging from 22- to 35-mers. Primers were extended m"
https://openalex.org/W2001407513,"α-Phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone (PBN), a free radical spin trap, has been shown previously to protect retinas against light-induced neurodegeneration, but the mechanism of protection is not known. Here we report that PBN-mediated retinal protection probably occurs by slowing down the rate of rhodopsin regeneration by inhibiting RPE65 activity. PBN (50 mg/kg) protected albino Sprague-Dawley rat retinas when injected 0.5-12 h before exposure to damaging light at 2,700 lux intensity for 6 h but had no effect when administered after the exposure. PBN injection significantly inhibited in vivo recovery of rod photoresponses and the rate of recovery of functional rhodopsin photopigment. Assays for visual cycle enzyme activities indicated that PBN inhibited one of the key enzymes of the visual cycle, RPE65, with an IC(50) = 0.1 mm. The inhibition type for RPE65 was found to be uncompetitive with K(i) = 53 μm. PBN had no effect on the activity of other visual cycle enzymes, lecithin retinol acyltransferase and retinol dehydrogenases. Interestingly, a more soluble form of PBN, N-tert-butyl-α-(2-sulfophenyl) nitrone, which has similar free radical trapping activity, did not protect the retina or inhibit RPE65 activity, providing some insight into the mechanism of PBN specificity and action. Slowing down the visual cycle is considered a treatment strategy for retinal diseases, such as Stargardt disease and dry age-related macular degeneration, in which toxic byproducts of the visual cycle accumulate in retinal cells. Thus, PBN inhibition of RPE65 catalytic action may provide therapeutic benefit for such retinal diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2011769321,"Cells must make appropriate fate decisions within a complex and dynamic environment. In vitro studies indicate that the cytoskeleton acts as an integrative platform for this environmental input. External signals regulate cytoskeletal dynamics and the cytoskeleton reciprocally modulates signal transduction. However, in vivo studies linking cytoskeleton/signalling interactions to embryonic cell fate specification remain limited. Here we show that the cytoskeleton modulates heart progenitor cell fate. Our studies focus on differential induction of heart fate in the basal chordate Ciona intestinalis. We have found that differential induction does not simply reflect differential exposure to the inductive signal. Instead, pre-cardiac cells employ polarized, invasive protrusions to localize their response to an ungraded signal. Through targeted manipulation of the cytoskeletal regulator CDC42, we are able to depolarize protrusive activity and generate uniform heart progenitor fate specification. Furthermore, we are able to restore differential induction by repolarizing protrusive activity. These findings illustrate how bi-directional interactions between intercellular signalling and the cytoskeleton can influence embryonic development. In particular, these studies highlight the potential for dynamic cytoskeletal changes to refine cell fate specification in response to crude signal gradients."

Fibrillins form the backbone of extracellular matrix microfibrils in tissues including blood vessels, bone, and skin. They are crucial for regulating elastic fiber biogenesis and growth factor bioavailability. To compare the molecular consequences of mutations causing the severe neonatal MFS with mutations causing the milder classical MFS, we introduced representative point mutations from each group in a recombinant human fibrillin-1 fragment. Structural effects were analyzed by circular dichroism spectroscopy and analytical gel filtration chromatography. Proteolytic susceptibility was probed with non-physiological and physiological proteases, including plasmin, thrombin, matrix metalloproteinases, and cathepsins. All mutant proteins showed a similar gross secondary structure and no differences in heat stability as compared with the wild-type protein. Proteins harboring neonatal mutations were typically more susceptible to proteolytic cleavage compared with those with classical mutations and the wild-type protein. Proteolytic neo-cleavage sites were found both in close proximity and distant to the mutations, indicating small but significant structural changes exposing cryptic cleavage sites. We also report for the first time that cathepsin K and V cleave non-mutated fibrillin-1 at several domain boundaries. Compared with the classical mutations and the wild type, the group of neonatal mutations more severely affected the ability of fibrillin-1 to interact with heparin/heparan sulfate, which plays a role in microfibril assembly.

Inter- and intra-familial variability is a common feature of MFS, suggesting that other gene products play a modifying role in the individual etiopathology or that the consequences of a clinical mutation depend on the type of mutation and the context within the fibrillin-1 gene (1Robinson P.N. Arteaga-Solis E. Baldock C. Collod-Béroud G. Booms P. De Paepe A. Dietz H.C. Guo G. Handford P.A. Judge D.P. Kielty C.M. Loeys B. Milewicz D.M. Ney A. Ramirez F. Reinhardt D.P. Tiedemann K.

Presently, no clear genotype-phenotype correlations have been established with the exception of the region covered by domains TB3-cbEGF18 (exons 24–32) in which mutations can cause early childhood mortality. This severe form of MFS is termed neonatal MFS (nMFS) (1Robinson P.N. Arteaga-Solis E. Baldock C. Collod-Béroud G. Booms P. De Paepe A. Dietz H.C. Guo G. Handford P.A. Judge D.P. Kielty C.M. Loeys B.

Classical MFS (cMFS) typically results from mutations elsewhere in the fibrillin-1 gene, although certain mutations located in the neonatal region have been shown to cause cMFS (17Faivre L.

Loss of tissue integrity can result from deficiencies in the biogenesis of the microfibril/elastic fiber system and/or from excessive degradation of this system.

There is growing evidence that proteases play a significant role in the pathophysiology of MFS. Calcium binding to cbEGF domains protects fibrillin-1 from proteolytic degradation by several physiological and non-physiological proteases in vitro (13Vollbrandt T. Tiedemann K. El-Hallous E. Lin G.

It is documented that fibrillins are cleaved, for example, by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2, -9, and -12 (31Hindson V.J. Ashworth J.L. Rock M.J. Cunliffe S. Shuttleworth C.A. Kielty C.M.

J. 1999; 340: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Some of the cleavage sites have been localized to exon 10/11 (proline-rich region-EGF4) and to the C-terminal end of cbEGF31 (31Hindson V.J. Ashworth J.L. Rock M.J. Cunliffe S. Shuttleworth C.A. Kielty C.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). None of these sites is located within the neonatal region of fibrillin-1. In other studies, the cMFS mutant E2447K but not E2169K, engineered in a fibrillin-1 C-terminal fragment, altered the degradation patterns for proteolysis with MMP-2, -9, -12, and -13 (32Ashworth J.L.

This suggests the exposure of cryptic cleavage sites in mutant fibrillin-1 is dependent on the position of the mutation and not necessarily on the type of the amino acid exchanged. At the tissue level, MMP-1, -2, -3, and -9 proteases were up-regulated in thoracic aortas from MFS patients, and MMP-2 and -9 were up-regulated in a mouse model for MFS (33Ikonomidis J.S. Jones J.A.

The addition of fibrillin-1 fragments containing the RGD integrin binding site to human dermal fibroblasts in cell culture induced the expression of MMP-1 and -3 (35Booms P. Pregla R. Ney A.

This suggests a potential vicious cycle where degraded fibrillin fragments may in turn lead to the further production of relevant proteases in tissues. Immunohistological studies showed a unique MMP and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) profile that emerged in ascending aortic aneurysms of individuals with MFS (33Ikonomidis J.S.

Cathepsins, known for their intracellular function in lysosomes, have also been detected in the extracellular environment. Cathepsin K and V have elastolytic activity and have been identified in macrophages present in plaques of diseased blood vessels, in osteoclasts facilitating bone resorption, and in the progression of artheriosclerotic plaques in cerebral blood vessels (37Yasuda Y.

Nothing is known about proteolytic activity of cathepsin K and cathepsin V on fibrillin molecules. In summary, the published evidence suggests that entire or partial proteolytic degradation of fibrillin and microfibrils are involved in loss of tissue integrity. This may consequently lead to fewer functional microfibrils in tissues associated with elevated levels of active TGF-β, which significantly contributes to the pathogenesis of MFS (3Ramirez F.

The aim of the current study is to analyze functional consequences of mutations in fibrillin-1 that cause nMFS and to compare them to mutations that cause cMFS. We expressed and purified several nMFS and cMFS mutations within a centrally located fragment of fibrillin-1 harboring the neonatal region and analyzed the susceptibility for proteolytic degradation using a panel of non-physiological and physiological proteases. In addition, we analyzed the functional consequences of the mutations on heparin binding. We found that generally the nMFS mutations had more severe consequences on proteolytic susceptibility as well as on the interaction with heparin. The results from this study may suggest novel pathogenetic players contributing to MFS and other fibrillinopathies. The rF20 fragment used in this study includes a sequence coding for an N-terminal BM-40 signal peptide to ensure proper secretion in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293) and a C-terminal hexahistidine tag to facilitate purification. The cloning and production of the rFBN1-N and rFBN1-C fragment were described previously (41Lin G. Tiedemann K. Vollbrandt T. Peters H. Batge B. Brinckmann J. Reinhardt D.P. J. Biol.

The plasmid coding for Asp451–Val1527 of fibrillin-1 was generated by restricting pcDFRSP-rF45-WT and pCEPSP-rF18 with Bsu36I × NotI of which the 6629- and the 1727-bp fragment, respectively, were ligated to generate the plasmid coding for the rF20-WT construct (pDNSP-rF20-WT). The same strategies were used to generate plasmids coding for rF20-C750G (pcDFRSP-rF45-C750G plus pCEPSP-rF18) and rF20-R627C (pcDFRSP-rF45-R627C plus pCEPSP-rF18). The 7185-bp NheI × Bsu36I fragment from pDNSP-rF20-WT was ligated with the 1534-bp NheI × Bsu36I fragment from pCEPSP-rF45-N548I, resulting in the plasmid coding for rF20-N548I. To generate mutant polypeptide rF20-E1073K, a 6992 bp Bsu36I × NotI fragment from pDNSP-rF20-WT was ligated with a 1727 bp Bsu36I × NotI fragment from pCEPSP-rF18-E1073K. Mutation constructs rF20-G1013R, rF20-C1032Y, rF20-I1048T, and rF20-C1182S were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with pDNSP-rF20-WT as a template according to the supplied protocol. The fibrillin-1 oligonucleotide primers harboring the single nucleotide exchanges are listed in supplemental Table 1. The presence of the mutations in all constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. HEK 293 were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. 10 μg of the linearized plasmid DNA of the different rF20 constructs was transfected into HEK 293 cells with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the supplied protocol (Invitrogen). Two days after transfection, the selection procedure was initiated by supplementing the medium with 0.25 mg/ml G418 sulfate (Wisent). Secretion of the rF20 proteins was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting after trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Conditioned serum-free medium with secreted rF20 mutant proteins was collected from triple layer flasks (Nunc) and supplemented with protease inhibitors (0.1 mm PMSF, 1 tablet/500 ml of EDTA-free Complete, Roche Applied Science). The proteins were purified to homogeneity using an ÄktaPurifier (GE Healthcare) with the following purification schemes; the pH of 2 liters of conditioned medium was adjusted to 8.8 with 2 m Tris-base and filtered through a 5-μm membrane filter (Millipore). A 50-ml Q-Sepharose HP anion exchange column (GE Healthcare) was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, and the medium was applied at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. Bound protein was eluted with 20 mm HEPES, 1 m NaCl, pH 7.2, directly onto a 5-ml HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) loaded with Ni2+ and equilibrated in the same buffer. Bound proteins were eluted from the HisTrap column with a gradient of 0–500 mm imidazole in 20 mm HEPES, 1 m NaCl, pH 7.2. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the ones containing the purified protein were pooled, treated with 5 mm EDTA, and dialyzed against TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) including 2 mm CaCl2 (TBS-Ca) and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce). To improve the purity, an additional preparative gel filtration chromatography step was occasionally required for the mutant polypeptides rF20-N548I and rF20-C1032Y. A 110-ml Superose-12 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) was equilibrated with 400 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, at 0.5 ml/min. Samples were concentrated to ∼1.5 ml using a Centriplus YM-30 unit (Millipore), loaded onto the column at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and fractionated (1 ml fractions). Fractions containing the purified proteins were identified via SDS-PAGE, pooled, and dialyzed against TBS-Ca. Western blotting with specific mono- and polyclonal antibodies as well as N-terminal sequencing using Edman degradation were used to confirm the identity and integrity of purified rF20 proteins. A analytical Superose 12 300GL column (GE Healthcare) was equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, and operated with an ÄktaPurifier (GE Healthcare). 200 μg of protein was loaded onto the column at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. 20-μl aliquots of selected peak fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE under non-reducing and reducing (0.1 m dithiothreitol, DTT) conditions and visualized by silver staining. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was used to analyze global alterations in protein secondary structure. Measurements were obtained in a 1 mm quartz cuvette using a Jasco J-815 CD spectropolarimeter. Samples were dialyzed against 1 mm KH2PO4, 6.6 mm NaH2PO4, 0.6 mm CaCl2, pH 7.0, and CD spectra were recorded using a protein concentration of 0.3 mg/ml (13Vollbrandt T. Tiedemann K. El-Hallous E.

Because an accurate protein concentration is critical for the correct calculation of the molar ellipticity, the protein concentrations were determined directly before CD measurements using the BCA assay. The spectrum of each polypeptide was measured at 20 and 95 °C with a scan speed of 50 nm/min. An average spectrum was obtained from five repeats. The percentage of secondary structure elements was calculated after deconvolution of the spectra using the Contin LL algorithm from the DichroWeb server (45Provencher S.W. Glöckner J.

Thermal denaturation profiles were measured with a heating rate of 0.4 °C/min at 204 nm, where the greatest difference in the mean molar ellipticity between 20 and 95 °C was observed. Measurements were converted to percent denatured protein, where the ellipticity at 20 °C was set to 0% denatured and the ellipticity at 95 °C was set to 100%. For proteolytic degradation assays, 7 μg of each rF20 polypeptide was digested with non-physiological (trypsin and chymotrypsin) and physiological (plasmin, thrombin, cathepsin K and V, and MMP-1, -2, -3, -9, and -12) proteases at various enzyme to protein ratios for up to 24 h at 37 °C. Degradation patterns were analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE using 4–20% gradient gels. Optimized enzyme-to-protein ratios and incubation times were used as follows: trypsin and chymotrypsin = 1:100 (w/w) for 30 min, plasmin and thrombin = 1:20 (w/w) for 24 h, cathepsin K = 1:50 (w/w) for 6 h, cathepsin V = 1:100 (w/w) for 6 h, and MMPs = 1:100 (w/w) for 24 h. Trypsin, chymotrypsin, plasmin, and thrombin were purchased from Sigma, MMP-1,-2,-3,-9, and -12 were obtained from R&D systems. MMPs were activated using 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate (Sigma) or by proteolytic self-activation according to the manufacture's specifications (Sigma). Cathepsin K and V were expressed in a non-glycosylated form in the yeast Pichia pastoris and activated with 0.1 m sodium acetate at pH 5.5 as described previously (47Linnevers C.J. McGrath M.E.

After proteolysis, the enzymes were deactivated by heat denaturation at 95 °C and 20 mm DTT, and the fragments were separated on 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. To characterize the degree of fragmentation, the intensity profile of individual lanes of scanned gels was measured using the Molecular Imaging Software Version 4.0 (Eastman Kodak Co.). The background corrected net intensity profiles were plotted as three-dimensional graphs using the Origin 7.0 software package (OriginLab).

https://openalex.org/W1990995020,"Bone destruction is the major pathological process in many bone metabolic diseases and is a result of increased osteoclast formation and bone resorption. The liver X receptors (α,β), important regulators of cholesterol metabolism and inflammatory signaling, have recently been observed to play a role in both physiological and pathological bone turnover. However, the relationship between liver X receptors (LXR) and osteoclast differentiation/formation remains unknown. Here, we report that the LXR ligand GW3965 is able to clearly and potently inhibit the formation of mature osteoclasts from receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL)-stimulated human and murine osteoclast precursors. This results in a significant inhibition of bone resorption. We observed that GW3965 significantly inhibited expression of the osteoclast markers tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, cathepsin K, osteoclast-associated receptor (OSCAR), and calcitonin receptor, appearing to act in an NFATc1/p38/microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF)-dependent mechanism, independently of receptor activator of nuclear factor κB or c-Fos and not directly involving the NFκB pathways. GW3965 was less effective in RAW264.7 monocyte/macrophage cells, which are more committed into the osteoclast lineage. Also, GW3965 seemed to act differently depending on the source of the progenitor cells as it had no effect on calvarial osteoclasts, compared with marrow or blood-derived monocytes. As these effects were abolished in osteoclast precursors derived from LXRβ(-/-) mice, we suggest that GW3965 acts via an LXRβ-dependent mechanism. Taken together, our results suggest that the LXR can act as an important inhibitor of RANKL-mediated osteoclast differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W2166454224,"Enterovirus 71 (EV71), a member of the Picornaviridae family, may cause serious clinical manifestations associated with the central nervous system. Enterovirus 3C protease is required for virus replication and can trigger host cell apoptosis via cleaving viral polyprotein precursor and cellular proteins, respectively. Although the role of the 3C protease in processing viral and cellular proteins has been established, very little is known about the modulation of EV71 3C function by host cellular factors. Here, we show that sumoylation promotes EV71 3C protein ubiquitination for degradation, correlating with a decrease of EV71 in virus replication and cell apoptosis. SUMO E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 was identified as an EV71 3C-interacting protein. Further studies revealed that EV71 3C can be SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier)-modified at residue Lys-52. Sumoylation down-regulated 3C protease activity in vitro and also 3C protein stability in cells, in agreement with data suggesting 3C K52R protein induced greater substrate cleavage and apoptosis in cells. More importantly, the recombinant EV71 3C K52R virus infection conferred more apoptotic phenotype and increased virus levels in culture cells, which also correlated with a mouse model showing increased levels of viral VP1 protein in intestine and neuron loss in the spinal cord with EV71 3C K52R recombinant viral infection. Finally, we show that EV71 3C amino acid residues 45-52 involved in Ubc9 interaction determined the extent of 3C sumoylation and protein stability. Our results uncover a previously undescribed cellular regulatory event against EV71 virus replication and host cell apoptosis by sumoylation at 3C protease."
https://openalex.org/W2010208991,"The flagellar calcium-binding protein (FCaBP) of Trypanosoma cruzi is localized to the flagellar membrane in all life cycle stages of the parasite. Myristoylation and palmitoylation of the N terminus of FCaBP are necessary for flagellar membrane targeting. Not all dually acylated proteins in T. cruzi are flagellar, however. Other determinants of FCaBP therefore likely contribute to flagellar specificity. We generated T. cruzi transfectants expressing the N-terminal 24 or 12 amino acids of FCaBP fused to GFP. Analysis of these mutants revealed that although amino acids 1–12 are sufficient for dual acylation and membrane binding, amino acids 13–24 are required for flagellar specificity and lipid raft association. Mutagenesis of several conserved lysine residues in the latter peptide demonstrated that these residues are essential for flagellar targeting and lipid raft association. Finally, FCaBP was expressed in the protozoan Leishmania amazonensis, which lacks FCaBP. The flagellar localization and membrane association of FCaBP in L. amazonensis suggest that the mechanisms for flagellar targeting, including a specific palmitoyl acyltransferase, are conserved in this organism.

Eukaryotic cilia and flagella are membranous organelles that project from the cell surface and have multiple functions, including powering cell motility, the movement of extracellular fluid across the cell surface, and cell signaling (1Singla V. Reiter J.F. Science. 2006; 313: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). A number of human disorders, collectively known as the ciliopathies, have been linked to mutations in genes involved in ciliary biogenesis and function (2Tobin J.L. Beales P.L. Genet. Med. 2009; 11: 386-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Because cilia lack the machinery for protein synthesis, ciliary proteins must be synthesized outside of this organelle and then imported (3Pazour G.J. Bloodgood R.A. Curr. Top Dev. Biol. 2008; 85: 115-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Kinetoplastid protozoa, besides being of interest for their global health burden, serve as excellent model organisms for the elucidation of mechanisms underlying ciliary trafficking. The surface of trypanosomes contains three distinct membrane domains: the cell body (pellicular) membrane, the flagellar membrane, and the flagellar pocket membrane (4Gull K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 5Bangs J.D. Uyetake L. Brickman M.J. Balber A.E. Boothroyd J.C. J.

The flagellar membrane is structurally and functionally distinct from the other surface membranes (3Pazour G.J. Bloodgood R.A. Curr. Top Dev. Biol. 2008; 85: 115-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). There is an asymmetric distribution of proteins across these membrane domains, and several proteins have been identified in kinetoplastids that are heavily enriched or restricted to the flagellar membrane (7Coppens I.

Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Likewise, the kinetoplast flagellar membrane has a unique lipid composition from the rest of the cell surface. The flagellar membrane is enriched in sterols (14Chailley B. Boisvieux-Ulrich E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1985; 33: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 15Kaneshiro E.S. Bloodgood R.A.

Due to their composition, lipid rafts are relatively resistant to solubilization with cold non-ionic detergents such as Triton X-100 and hence are often experimentally defined as detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs). 5The abbreviations used are: DRMdetergent-resistant membraneFCaBPflagellar calcium-binding proteinN24-GFPN-terminal 24 amino acids of FCaBP fused to GFPbiotin-HPDPN-[6-(biotinamido)hexyl]-3′-(2′-pyridyldithio)propionamideM199medium 199. Many dually acylated proteins coalesce into lipid rafts, and raft disruption leads to mislocalization of DRM-associated flagellar proteins (20Tyler K.M. Fridberg A. Toriello K.M. Olson C.L. Cieslak J.A. Hazlett T.L. Engman D.M. J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been proposed that protein association with lipid rafts might serve to recruit and/or retain flagellar membrane proteins (20Tyler K.M. Fridberg A. Toriello K.M. Olson C.L.

One dually acylated protein that is highly enriched in the flagellar membrane of the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi is a 24-kDa flagellar calcium-binding protein (FCaBP). The N terminus of FCaBP, which is dually acylated with myristate and palmitate, localizes to the internal face of the flagellar membrane, and both modifications are necessary for this localization (12Godsel L.M. Engman D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The N terminus of FCaBP is also sufficient to direct the cytoplasmic GFP to the flagellum (12Godsel L.M. Engman D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Although dual acylation is required for localization of FCaBP, it is not clear whether it is sufficient or whether other properties of the N terminus contribute, perhaps by promoting an association with lipid rafts. Although a variety of membrane proteins with specific localization to the flagellum have been identified in protozoan parasites, the pathways of membrane targeting and sorting among pellicular and flagellar pocket and flagellar membranes are poorly understood. The studies presented herein further define the requirements for flagellar membrane targeting and lipid raft association, and elucidate the molecular mechanisms that are likely conserved in trypanosomes and other ciliated cells. Epimastigotes of the Y strain of T. cruzi were used throughout this study and were cultured in liver digest-neutralized tryptose medium supplemented with hemin and 10% heat-inactivated FBS, as described (21Kirchhoff L.V. Neva F.A. Jama. 1985; 254: 3058-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). L. amazonensis (LV79) was grown in medium 199 (M199) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. The T. cruzi epimastigote expression vector pTEX-9E10 (22Tibbetts R.S. Kim I.Y. Olson C.L. Barthel L.M. Sullivan M.A. Winquist A.G. Miller S.D. Engman D.M. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 2499-2507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used for all studies. DNA inserts in pTEX-9E10 were expressed in transfected T. cruzi epimastigotes as proteins containing a C-terminal 10-amino acid c-Myc epitope tag. Sequences for cloning were generated by PCR amplification of a FCaBP cDNA template (23Godsel L.M. Olson C.L. Lacava Z.G. Engman D.M. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1995; 42: 320-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and directionally cloned into pTEX-9E10 using 5′ XbaI and 3′ EcoRV sites. GFP sequences were PCR-amplified from Aequorea victoria pS65T plasmid as a template (24Chalfie M. Tu Y. Euskirchen G. Ward W.W. Prasher D.C. Science. 1994; 263: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (5487) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides used for PCR were as follows (5′-3′): WT FCaBP-Myc, (sense) TCTAGAATGGGTGCTTGTGGGTC and (antisense) GATATCCATAAAGTGGAGAATGTGC; G2A (sense) ATGGCTGCTTGTGGGTCGAAG and antisense: CGCGCTCTCCGGCACGT; C4A (sense) ATGGGTGCTGCTGGGTCGAAG and (antisense) CGCGCTCTCCGGCACGT; N24-GFP (sense) TCTAGAATGGGTGCTTGTGGGTC and (antisense) TCTAGAGGCGTTCTTGCCGTCCTT; N12 (sense) GATCCATGGGTGCTTGTGGGTCGAAGGGCTCGACGAGCGACA and (antisense) AGCTTCTCGCTCGTCGAGCCCTTCGACCCACAAGCACCCATG; and GFP (sense) TCTAGAATGAGTAAAGGAGAAGAACTTTTC and (antisense) GATATCTTTGTATAGTTCATCCATGCCATG. All plasmids were purified using Qiagen kits (Qiagen, Gaithersberg, MD), and the relevant regions of all constructs were sequenced to assure accuracy. For transfection experiments, T. cruzi epimastigotes were grown to a density of 1–2 × 107 cells/ml at 26 °C in liver digest-neutralized tryptose, washed twice with 1000 mg/liter d-glucose, 36 mg/liter sodium pyruvate (PBSG buffer, Invitrogen) and suspended in ice-cold transfection buffer (0.5 mm MgOAc, 0.1 mm CaCl2 in PBS) at a density of 1 × 108 cells/ml. 400 μl of the cell suspension was placed into a 0.2-cm electrode gap cuvette with 10 μg of supercoiled plasmid DNA and pulsed once at 0.45 kV and 500 μF using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). Electroporated cells were recovered in 5 ml of liver digest-neutralized tryptose, and G418 (0.5 mg/ml) was added 48 h later. Drug-resistant lines were analyzed after ∼4–6 weeks of selection. L. amazonensis promastigotes were grown to a density of 5–10 × 107 cells/ml at 26 °C in M199 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, washed twice in ice-cold transfection buffer (21 mm HEPES, 150 μm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 120 mm KCl, 0.7 mm NaH2PO4, 6 mm glucose), and resuspended in this buffer at a density of 1 × 108 cells/ml. 300 μl of the cell suspension was placed into a 0.2-cm electrode gap cuvette with 20 μg of supercoiled plasmid DNA and pulsed once at 0.45 kV and 500 μF using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). Electroporated cells were placed in 5 ml of M199 medium supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated FBS, and G418 (0.5 mg/ml) was added 24 h later. Drug-resistant lines were analyzed after 2–3 weeks of selection. Parasite protein lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Resolved proteins were electrophoretically transferred to 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH) for Western blot analysis.

The secondary antibodies for Western blotting used were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit (1:2000) (Invitrogen). Blots were developed with the ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). T. cruzi epimastigote transfectants were centrifuged for 7 min at 1000 × g, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in 4% paraformaldehyde. Fixed parasites were settled onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides for 30 min (all incubations at room temperature), quenched with 50 mm glycine in PBS for 15 min, and washed with PBS for 30 min, exchanging wash buffer approximately every 5 min. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min and incubated in blocking buffer (2% normal goat serum, 1% BSA in PBS) for 1 h. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies diluted into blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C and washed with PBS over 30–60 min with replacement of wash buffer every 5–10 min. Cells were next incubated with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted 1:400 in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature and washed as after primary incubation. Cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml DAPI for 10–20 s, washed for 2 min with ultrapure water, and mounted with Gelvatol containing 100 mg/ml 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Imaging was performed on a Zeiss AxioImager microscope with a 63× objective. Image analysis was performed with Axiovision software (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). A total of 2 × 107 T. cruzi epimastigote cells were washed with PBS and incubated on ice in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.4) for 10 min. Lysates were sonicated at 50% maximum output for two 5-s pulses with a 1-min cooling on ice between bursts using a Branson Digital Sonifier (Model S-450D, Danbury, CT). Samples were pre-cleared at 10,000 × g for 10 min to remove unbroken cells and nuclei. Clarified supernatants were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h using a Beckman TLA100.3 rotor. Supernatants were precipitated with acetone. All samples were prepared by addition of prewarmed sample buffer and heated for 10 min at 95 °C. Approximately 106 cell equivalents/lane were analyzed by Western blotting. T. cruzi epimastigote cells were grown to mid-log phase, washed in PBS and resuspended at 2 × 108 cells/ml in 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 25 mm Tris- HCl, 150 mm NaCl, EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Sciences)). Cells were lysed at 4 °C for 30 min while rotating. This lysate was adjusted to 40% density with the addition of OptiPrep (Axis-Shield, Oslo, Norway) and then layered with 5 ml of a 35% OptiPrep solution and 1.5 ml of a 5% OptiPrep solution. All OptiPrep solutions were made using the lysis buffer. The samples were centrifuged for 5 h at 35,000 rpm and then for 12 h at 25,000 rpm using a Beckman SW41Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). Fractions were collected from the top and were added to 2× Laemmli sample buffer, heated at 95 °C for 10 min, and analyzed by Western blotting. T. cruzi epimastigote cells were grown to mid-log phase, washed twice in PBS, and resuspended at 1 × 108 cells/ml in 500 μl of 1% Triton X-100 in PBS, pre-equilibrated to either 4 or 37 °C. Cells were incubated at 4 or 37 °C for 10 min and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 7 min. Supernatants were removed from the pellets and transferred to new tubes, and the pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of 1% Triton X-100 in PBS at temperature. Supernatants were centrifuged again at 20,000 × g for 7 min at either 4 °C or 37 °C. Soluble (supernatant) and insoluble (pellet) fractions were added to 2× Laemmli sample buffer, heated at 95 °C for 10 min, and analyzed by Western blotting. To detect palmitate incorporation, T. cruzi epimastigotes were analyzed according to the protocol used for purification of the Trypanosoma brucei palmitoyl proteome (28Emmer B.T. Souther C. Toriello K.M. Olson C.L. Epting C.L. Engman D.M. J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), originally developed for yeast (29Wan J. Roth A.F. Bailey A.O. Davis N.G. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1573-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). We examined the cellular localization of endogenous FCaBP and WT FCaBPMyc in T. cruzi epimastigotes by immunofluorescence microscopy with FCaBP- or Myc-specific antisera, respectively (Fig. 1A). Both the endogenous FCaBP and WT FCaBPMyc proteins are enriched in the T. cruzi flagellum, indicating that the C-terminal Myc tag does not alter protein localization. To examine the association of FCaBP with DRMs, we performed discontinuous density gradient centrifugation. In this assay, DRMs and associated proteins are found in the low density interface fractions (fractions 2–3) due to their greater buoyancy. This analysis revealed that both the endogenous FCaBP and FCaBPMyc are DRM-associated (Fig. 1B). This is in contrast to the plasma membrane protein Gp63, which is distributed across the cell surface and is known not to associate with DRMs in T. cruzi (30Kulkarni M.M. Olson C.L. Engman D.M. McGwire B.S. Infection and Immunity. 2009; 77: 2193-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These results confirm that endogenous FCaBP and FCaBPMyc both localize to the flagellum and associate with DRMs in T. cruzi epimastigotes. To analyze the contribution of acylation to FCaBP localization, immunofluorescence microscopy was performed on acylation point mutants. This revealed that neither the non-acylated FCaBPG2A-Myc protein nor the myristoylated-only FCaBPC4A-Myc protein exhibited flagellar localization, instead appearing cytoplasmic (Fig. 2A). However, given the pellicular membrane association of the myristoylated-only mutant of the FCaBP homologue calflagin (28Emmer B.T. Souther C. Toriello K.M. Olson C.L. Epting C.L. Engman D.M. J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we further analyzed these mutants by cell fractionation. Transfectants were lysed by hypotonic sonication and fractionated into a cytosolic and membrane fraction by high speed centrifugation. Although endogenous FCaBP partitioned with the membrane fraction, the Myc-tagged mutants FCaBPG2A-Myc and FCaBPC4A-Myc were both found exclusively in the cytosolic fraction. As expected, the cytosolic Hsp70 and membranous phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C proteins associated predominantly with cytosolic and membrane fractions, respectively (Fig. 2B). Analysis of the acylation mutants by discontinuous density gradient centrifugation and Western blotting revealed that neither FCaBPG2A-Myc nor FCaBPC4A-Myc retained an association with the buoyant DRM like the endogenous FCaBP (Fig. 2C). The N terminus of FCaBP contains the determinants for acylation and is sufficient to direct cytoplasmic GFP to the flagellar membrane (12Godsel L.M. Engman D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2057-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Although prevention of acylation disrupts FCaBP flagellar localization, it is not clear whether the presence of fatty acids alone is sufficient for localization or whether other domains within the N terminus are also important. To further analyze the FCaBP N terminus, we designed a truncated fusion construct expressing either the N-terminal 24 or 12 amino acids of FCaBP fused to GFP (Fig. 3A). In both truncation mutants, sufficient sequence was left intact to preserve the N terminus myristoylation motif (31Maurer-Stroh S. Eisenhaber B. Eisenhaber F. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 523-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Mutant cells were generated by transfection with either N24-GFP, N12-GFP, or GFP alone, and expression of fusion proteins was confirmed (Fig. 3B). Because acylation of FCaBP is critical for its association with the flagellar membrane, we tested whether serial truncations within the N terminus of FCaBP led to alterations in acylation. Transfectants were analyzed by acyl-biotin exchange and Western blotting. In this assay, cell lysates were treated with hydroxylamine to cleave protein-palmitoyl linkages and generate reactive thiol groups, which were then labeled with N-[6-(biotinamido)hexyl]-3′-(2′-pyridyldithio)propionamide (biotin-HPDP). Biotinylated proteins were then purified by streptavidin-agarose chromatography. Nonspecific labeling of free thiols was blocked by preincubation of the extract with N-ethylmaleimide before hydroxylamine treatment, and residual background labeling and purification were monitored by treating samples in parallel with Tris-HCl in place of hydroxylamine. Endogenous FCaBP (positive control) demonstrated hydroxylamine-dependent purification, whereas tubulin (negative control) did not. Like FCaBP, N24-GFP and N12-GFP proteins were both biotinylated and purified by streptavidin under experimental but not control conditions (Fig. 3C). Because myristoylation was a requirement for palmitoylation of FCaBP and other dually acylated proteins, incorporation of palmitate in this assay was an indicator of dual acylation. To determine the cellular localization of either N24-GFP, N12-GFP, or GFP alone, T. cruzi transfectants expressing these proteins were analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy using antisera specific for FCaBP or GFP (Fig. 4). This showed clear differences in the localization of the fusion proteins. N24-GFP colocalized with endogenous FCaBP, confirming that the N-terminal 24 amino acids are sufficient to direct cytosolic GFP to the flagellum. On the other hand, N12-GFP failed to localize to the flagellum but instead remained associated with the cell body. This suggested that amino acids 13–24 of FCaBP are also required for flagellar targeting. Because dual acylation of N12-GFP is intact (Fig. 3C), the contribution of N13–24 to flagellar localization is not attributable to its requirement for acylation. As with the acylation mutants, we next tested whether N12-GFP mislocalized into the cytoplasm or retained an association with the pellicular membrane. T. cruzi transfectants expressing N24-GFP, N12-GFP, or GFP alone were subjected to hypotonic sonication and fractionated into cytosolic and membrane fractions by centrifugation. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using antisera specific to GFP, FCaBP, or Hsp70 (Fig. 5). N24-GFP and N12-GFP were found in the membrane fraction, whereas GFP partitioned into the cytosolic fraction. In all lines, endogenous FCaBP was enriched in the membrane fraction, whereas Hsp70 was enriched in the cytosolic fraction, as expected. Collectively, these results indicate that the first 12 amino acids of FCaBP are sufficient to promote membrane association, but that flagellar specificity also requires amino acids 13–24. The DRM association of FCaBP-GFP fusion proteins was next analyzed by two independent methods. First, parasite transfectants expressing FCaBP-GFP fusion proteins were analyzed by discontinuous OptiPrep gradient centrifugation and Western blotting using GFP- or FCaBP-specific antisera (Fig. 6A). N24-GFP associated with the DRM fractions, whereas N12-GFP did not. As expected, the endogenous FCaBP was buoyant in all three cell lines, whereas GFP alone remained with the non-DRM fraction. Similar results were obtained using an alternative assay for DRM association that takes advantage of the temperature dependence of DRM sensitivity to detergent (Fig. 6B). The same transfectants were treated with 1% Triton X-100 and fractionated into supernatant (soluble) and pellet (insoluble) fractions at either 4 °C or 37 °C. A DRM-associated protein will remain insoluble at 4 °C and thus will pellet during centrifugation. A non-DRM associated protein will be soluble at either temperature. Endogenous FCaBP is found in the pellet at 4 °C and is completely soluble at 37 °C, consistent with its DRM association. N24-GFP behaves identically to endogenous FCaBP. N12-GFP, however, is completely soluble at either 37 or 4 °C, much like GFP (Fig. 6B), indicating that N12-GFP has lost its DRM association. Therefore, although N1–12 is sufficient for membrane association it is not sufficient for either flagellar localization or DRM association. Analysis of the FCaBP N terminus revealed that, in addition to the conserved acylation sites, several positively charged lysine residues are conserved between FCaBP and the calflagins, the T. brucei homologues (Fig. 7A). Structural analysis of FCaBP shows that the side chains of these N-terminal lysines form a cluster of positive charge on one face of the protein surface (32Wingard J.N. Ladner J. Vanarotti M. Fisher A.J. Robinson H. Buchanan K.T. Engman D.M. Ames J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23388-23396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that these lysines underlie the requirement for N13–24 in flagellar targeting, perhaps by promoting or stabilizing interaction with flagellar membrane phospholipids, we replaced lysine residues 13, 19, and 22 with alanines by site-directed mutagenesis. We confirmed that the alanine mutant did not affect the palmitoylation state of this protein by acyl-biotin exchange (Fig. 7B). Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that N24K13A,K19A,K22A-GFP localized to the cell body, rather than the flagellum (Fig. 7C). Thus, the positively charged lysine residues within domain N13–24 are essential for flagellar specificity. Finally, N24K13A,K19A,K22A-GFP transfectants were treated with 1% Triton X-100 and fractionated into supernatant and pellet fractions at 4 and 37 °C. N24K13A,K19A,K22A-GFP remained completely soluble at both temperatures, indicating that the loss of the lysines had abolished the DRM association of N24-GFP (Fig. 7D). To investigate whether the mechanism underlying FCaBP targeting to the flagellum is conserved in other trypanosomatids, we used the related protozoan Leishmania amazonensis, which lacks an FCaBP homologue, as a “living test tube” for flagellar targeting. We transfected L. amazonensis promastigotes with full-length FCaBP using pTEX::FCaBPMyc or vector alone and analyzed these transfectants by Western blotting. FCaBPMyc was stably expressed in L. amazonensis (Fig. 8A) and localized to the flagellum by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 8B), similar to the localization of FCaBP in T. cruzi. To test whether FCaBP associates with DRMs in L. amazonensis, we analyzed L. amazonensis expressing FCaBPMyc by temperature-dependent Triton X-100 solubility and Western blotting. Like FCaBP in T. cruzi, FCaBPMyc partly partitions in the pellet fraction at 4 °C but is solubilized at 37 °C, a property of DRM-associated proteins (Fig. 8C). These results suggest that the molecular mechanisms for the targeting of FCaBP and perhaps other DRM-associated proteins is conserved among kinetoplastid protozoans. The plasma membrane of kinetoplastids (Trypanosoma and Leishmania species) has three distinct domains: the cell body (or pellicular) membrane, the flagellar membrane, and the flagellar pocket membrane. The flagellar membrane has a distinct lipid and protein composition in comparison with the other membrane domains. It is enriched in sterols (14Chailley B. Boisvieux-Ulrich E. J. Histochem.

Microbiol. 2010; 13: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).

In the present study, we investigated the effect of GPR39 deficiency on body weight and adipocyte metabolism. GPR39-deficient mice were subjected to a high-fat diet and body composition, glucose tolerance, insulin secretion, food intake, and energy expenditure were evaluated. The cell biology of adipocyte metabolism was studied on both mRNA and protein levels. A significant increase in body weight corresponding to a 2-fold selective increase in fat mass was observed in GPR39-deficient mice fed a high-fat diet as compared with wild-type littermate controls fed the same diet. The GPR39-deficient animals had similar food intake but displayed almost eliminated diet-induced thermogenesis, measured by the oxygen consumption rate (VO2) on change from normal to high-fat diet. Analysis of the adipose tissue for lipolytic enzymes demonstrated decreased level of phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and a decreased level of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) by 35 and 60%, respectively, after food withdrawal in the GPR39-deficient mice. Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), a signaling pathway known to be important for lipolysis, was decreased by 56% in the GPR39-deficient mice. GPR39 deficiency is associated with increased fat accumulation on a high-fat diet, conceivably due to decreased energy expenditure and adipocyte lipolytic activity.—Petersen, P.

https://openalex.org/W2057662244,"The limited success of dendritic cell (DC)-based immunotherapy in multiple myeloma is partly due to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced DC dysfunction. From a therapeutic standpoint, it is important to understand the molecular events involved in inhibition of DC activation/maturation by HGF. Because Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) negatively regulates maturation and immunostimulatory function of DCs, a role for Btk in HGF-induced inhibition of both murine and human DCs was investigated. We demonstrate that Btk is a novel proximal component of HGF-induced c-MET (HGF receptor) signaling. Following HGF treatment, Btk binds to c-MET and becomes activated. Btk activation in turn blocks the NF-κB pathway and subsequent DC activation via the c-Src-PI3K-AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Notably, Btk activation is necessary for HGF-induced association of c-Src and PI3K with c-MET. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence that HGF inhibits DC activation by inducing autocrine interleukin (IL)-10 secretion, which requires activation of Btk. Blocking activation of Btk and its downstream the c-Src-PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway prevents HGF-induced IL-10 secretion by DCs. In addition, neutralization of IL-10 secretion from DCs impaired the inhibitory effect of HGF on DCs. Thus, our study identifies a novel role for Btk in HGF-induced DC inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2037183562,"During brain development, pyramidal neurons migrate from the ventricular zone to reach their final destination in the cortex. In vivo depletion experiments shows that lamellipodin, through an effect on serum response factor, determines the neuronal migration mode in the developing cortex. During corticogenesis, pyramidal neurons (∼80% of cortical neurons) arise from the ventricular zone, pass through a multipolar stage to become bipolar and attach to radial glia1,2, and then migrate to their proper position within the cortex1,3. As pyramidal neurons migrate radially, they remain attached to their glial substrate as they pass through the subventricular and intermediate zones, regions rich in tangentially migrating interneurons and axon fibre tracts. We examined the role of lamellipodin (Lpd), a homologue of a key regulator of neuronal migration and polarization in Caenorhabditis elegans, in corticogenesis. Lpd depletion caused bipolar pyramidal neurons to adopt a tangential, rather than radial-glial, migration mode without affecting cell fate. Mechanistically, Lpd depletion reduced the activity of SRF, a transcription factor regulated by changes in the ratio of polymerized to unpolymerized actin. Therefore, Lpd depletion exposes a role for SRF in directing pyramidal neurons to select a radial migration pathway along glia rather than a tangential migration mode."

The cell wall surrounding cytoplasmic membrane is of prime importance in bacteria survival and adaptation to their environment. In Gram-positive bacteria, the cell wall includes a thick multilayer peptidoglycan to which most often are associated other cell-surface structures called secondary cell wall polymers (SCWPs) 4The abbreviations used are: SCWPsecondary cell wall polymerPSpolysaccharideCh HF-PSfor charged HF-PSNe HF-PSneutral HF-PSTOCSYtotal correlation spectroscopyHMBCheteronuclear multiple bond coherenceDATDHdiaminotrideoxyhexoseHR-MAShigh resolution magic angle spinningHCThydrolysate of casein TryptoneBHIbrain heart infusionHSQCheteronuclear single quantum correlation. (1Vollmer W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2008; 32: 287-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). These secondary cell wall polymers include lipoteichoic acids anchored in the outer leaflet of plasmic membrane as well as teichoic acids, teichuronic acids, or neutral polysaccharides (SCWP polysaccharides), which are covalently bound, through a phosphodiester link, to the N-acetyl muramic acid moieties of the peptidoglycan. SCWPs are essential in Bacillus subtilis and were shown to be involved in the bacterial virulence in Staphylococcus aureus (2Weidenmaier C. Peschel A. Xiong Y.Q. Kristian S.A. Dietz K. Yeaman M.R. Bayer A.S. J. Infect. Dis. 2005; 191: 1771-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In addition, SCWPs bind SLH (S-layer homology) domains containing proteins, thus anchoring them non-covalently to the cell wall (3Mesnage S. Fontaine T. Mignot T. Delepierre M. Mock M. Fouet A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4473-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). These proteins are involved in various functions, including peptidoglycan maturation (4Chitlaru T. Ariel N. Zvi A. Lion M.

Biofilms are multicellular structures attached to a solid or a liquid surface and embedded in a self-produced matrix. This matrix is made of polymers, mostly polysaccharides, DNA, and/or proteins, provides cohesion to the bacterial community (11Kolter R.

Biofilms are, therefore, persistent structures, resisting desiccation, cleaning procedures, and antimicrobial substances (14Peng J.S. Tsai W.C. Chou C.C. Int. J. Food Microbiol. 2002; 77: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), which makes them a challenge in human health and industrial processes. Several species from the Bacillus genus, including B. subtilis, Bacillus cereus and Bacillus anthracis, have been identified to form biofilms in a wide range of different environments (15Auger S. Ramarao N. Faille C. Fouet A. Aymerich S. Gohar M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2009; 75: 6616-6618Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 16Ren D. Bedzyk L.A. Setlow P. Thomas S.M. Ye R.W.

Microbiology. 2007; 153: 1693-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In B. cereus, the formation of biofilms is enhanced by low nutrient supplies and requires the presence of biosurfactants (18Hsueh Y.H. Somers E.B. Lereclus D. Wong A.C.L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 5089-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). B. cereus is a Gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium, genetically close to Bacillus thuringiensis, a pathogen of insects used in crop protection, and to B. anthracis, a lethal pathogen of mammals previously used as a weapon in bioterrorism acts. This bacterium is an opportunistic pathogen frequently diagnosed in gastroenteritis cases (19Kotiranta A. Lounatmaa K. Haapasalo M. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) but also involved in other human diseases, including endophthalmitis and meningitis (20Bottone E.J. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2010; 23: 382-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). It produces a high number of virulence factors, most of them controlled by a master virulence regulator (21Gohar M. Faegri K.

In addition, spores and biofilms produced by B. cereus are persistent contaminants of the food industry equipment (22Wijman J.G. de Leeuw P.P. Moezelaar R. Zwietering M.H. Abee T. Appl. Environ.

These secondary cell wall polysaccharides were suggested to represent in this bacterium and its close relatives a virulence-associated carbohydrate antigen motif (23Leoff C. Saile E. Rauvolfova J.

The exact structures of the secondary cell wall polysaccharides from two B. cereus strains were recently compared with those of B. anthracis Ames after their release from the cell wall using aqueous hydrogen fluoride (HF). The detailed analysis of the peptidoglycan HF-labile fractions established the occurrence of the consensus sequence (α-HexNAc-β-ManNAc-β-GlcNAc) in all three strains (24Leoff C. Choudhury B. Saile E. Quinn C.P. Carlson R.W. Kannenberg E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29812-29821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Choudhury B. Leoff C. Saile E. Wilkins P. Quinn C.P. Kannenberg E.L. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27932-27941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In particular, the backbone of the secondary cell wall polysaccharides isolated from B. anthracis Ames and B. cereus 10987 were shown to be composed of structurally related trisaccharide repeating units differentially substituted by a strain-specific pattern of α- and β-d-galactosidase residues. In comparison, B. cereus 14579 strain appears to synthesize similar but more complex polysaccharides containing the consensus trisaccharide sequence, the structure of which is, however, still elusive (24Leoff C. Choudhury B. Saile E. Quinn C.P. Carlson R.W. Kannenberg E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29812-29821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although much information is currently available on the structure of cell wall-associated components, including teichoic acids and secondary cell wall polysaccharides, nothing is currently known about the evolution of these components in B. cereus and relatives species along the bacterial growth and in particular during the transition between planktonic and biofilm modes of life. Previous reports established, however, that growth conditions may influence their cell wall compositions. Particularly, in B. subtilis, teichoic acids are replaced by teichuronic acids during phosphate starvation (28Lang W.K. Glassey K. Archibald A.R. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 367-375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such structural modifications of the bacterial cell wall may have an influence on the overall physicochemical properties of the cell surface that regulate bacterial interactions with substratum. Here we investigated the changes undergone by the secondary cell wall polysaccharide in the B. cereus ATCC 14579 strain during bacterial exponential and stationary growth and between bacteria in planktonic or in biofilm states. We first established that the polysaccharide fraction released by HF from B. cereus strain ATCC 14579 grown in planktonic conditions was composed of two distinct polysaccharides presenting very different structural features. Whereas one presented strong similarities with HF-released polysaccharide (HF-PS) isolated from B. cereus 10987 (24Leoff C. Choudhury B. Saile E. Quinn C.P. Carlson R.W. Kannenberg E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29812-29821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the other one exhibited totally original structural features. Then, we demonstrated that these two polysaccharides were differentially regulated along the growth of bacteria in the biofilm phase but not in the planktonic phase. Biofilms were produced as floating pellicles with the B. cereus ATCC 14579 strain in HCT medium (29Lecadet M.M. Blondel M.O. Ribier J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1980; 121: 203-212PubMed Google Scholar) at 37 °C in glass tubes (30Houry A. Briandet R. Aymerich S. Gohar M. Microbiology. 2010; 156: 1009-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) or in 50-ml beakers. Biofilms in 50-ml beakers were obtained in the same way as in glass tubes. Planktonic cultures were performed with the ATCC14579 strain in HCT or in BHI culture media at 37 °C and 175 rpm. In HCT, planktonic cultures were harvested at 5, 10, 15, and 20 h post-inoculation, and biofilms were harvested at 28, 48, 72, and 96 h post-inoculation. These timescales spanned the whole life of ATCC14579 planktonic cultures or biofilms in a poor medium. Planktonic cultures in BHI (a rich medium) were harvested at an optical density of 4.0 (6 h post-inoculation). Secondary cell wall polymers were extracted similarly to the peptidoglycan (31Candela T. Fouet A. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), with an additional hydrolysis step using hydrofluoric acid. The bacterial cells, harvested from planktonic cells or from biofilms, were boiled for 10 min in 40 ml of (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% SDS) and spun down at 6500 × g for 10 min. This step was repeated once to obtain only the peptidoglycan together with its covalently linked secondary cell wall polymers. The resulting pellet was washed in 40 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, sonicated, and centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 20 min. The remaining contaminants were discarded by treating the resulting pellet, solubilized in 20 mm MgSO4, successively by DNase (1 mg/ml) and RNase (5 mg/ml), then by proteinase K (20 μg/ml at room temperature for 12 h) in the presence of 10 mm CaCl2, and finally by SDS (1% at 100 °C for 10 min.). The insoluble material, recovered after centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 20 min, was rinsed in pure water and treated successively with 8 m LiCl2 and with 100 mm EDTA. The resulting insoluble material, spun down at 50,000 × g for 20 min, was rinsed twice in pure water, and digested with 46% hydrofluoric acid for 48 h at room temperature. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant containing the secondary cell wall polymers was precipitated with 3 volumes of ethanol. The precipitate was then dried and stored at −20 °C until use. Total polysaccharide fraction was hydrolyzed repetitively under mild conditions (0.1 m trifluoroacetic acid at 80 °C for 1 h). After each hydrolysis step, four volumes of ethanol were added, and the liberated oligosaccharides were collected in the ethanol fraction. Release of oligosaccharides from total polysaccharide was assessed by TLC analysis on silica gel using butanol/acetic acid/H2O (40/30/20) as solvent. Completeness of the reaction was assessed by dosing carbohydrate by phenol-sulfuric staining and weighing of the ethanol soluble fraction. Typically, four hydrolysis steps were sufficient to liberate all hydrolysable material. Oligosaccharides were further purified by gel filtration on a Bio-Gel P-2 column. Total polysaccharide was fractionated into a neutral and an anionic fraction on a HPLC apparatus fitted with a strong anion exchange column Mono Q (Amersham Biosciences). The sample was loaded and eluted with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) followed by a NaCl gradient (0–10 min, 0 m; 10–60 min, 0–0.6 m; 60–65 min, 0.80 m) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Linkage analyses of monosaccharides were achieved by permethylation followed by hydrolysis, reduction, and derivatization with acetyl groups. Briefly, samples were permethylated according to Ciucanu (32Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3188) Google Scholar), hydrolyzed in 4 m trifluoroacetic acid for 4 h at 100 °C, and then reduced with sodium borohydride in 0.05 m NH4OH for 4 h. Reduction was stopped by dropwise addition of acetic acid until pH 6 was reached, and borate salts were co-distilled by repetitive evaporation in dry methanol. Partially methylated, reduced monosaccharides were acetylated in 500 μl of acetic anhydride at 100 °C for 2 h. Solution was dried and partially methylated, and acetylated reduced monosaccharides were extracted three times in chloroform. After two exchanges with 2H2O (Eurisotop-Saclay France), sample was dissolved in pure D2O. Experiments were recorded at various temperatures (280, 300, 343 K), but only spectra recorded at 300 K are shown. The pD was kept neutral. Experiments were recorded on Bruker spectrometers at three different fields. 9.4, 18.8, and 21.6 tesla were 1H-resonated at 400.33, 800.12, and 900.11 MHz but 13C-resonated at 100.2, 200.3, and 220.0 MHz, respectively. 31P spectrum was recorded at 9.4 tesla. Pulse programs used were extracted from Bruker pulse program library where pulses and delays were optimized for each experiment. For TOCSY experiments, 40, 60, 80, and 100 ms were used for mixing time in spectra recording. HR-MAS NMR experiments were achieved on an 18.8 T Avance II Bruker spectrometer. The experiments were acquired with a 13C,1H/31P/2H probe with uniaxial gradients. Before analysis, cell-pellets were washed twice with deuterium oxide (Euriso-top, Gif-sur-Yvette, France). The 4-mm ZrO2 rotors (CortecNet, Paris, France) were filled with 50 μl of cell pellets including 0.5 μl of acetone as the internal standard and finally centrifuged at 3000 rpm. All spectra were recorded at 293 K, and the rotor spinning rate was 8 kHz. All experiments came from the Bruker library pulse program, and delays and powers were optimized for each. For 13C,1H HSQC, the spectral widths were 12.820 Hz (1H) with 1.024 points for free induction decay resolution and 29.994 Hz (13C) for 400 scans, giving 12.5 and 75.0 Hz/point respectively. MALDI-MS and MS/MS analyses of polysaccharides were performed on 4800 Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) mass spectrometer, operated in the reflectron mode. For MS acquisition, 5 μl of diluted samples in H2O were mixed with 5 μl of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix solution (10 mg/ml dissolved in H2O/CH3OH (1:1, v/v)). The mixtures (2 μl) were then spotted on the target plate and air-dried. Peaks observed in the MS spectra were selected for further MS/MS. Collision-induced dissociation MS/MS data comprise a total of 100 subspectra of 3000 laser shots. Two or more spectra can be combined post-acquisition with mass tolerance set at 0.1 Da to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The potential difference between the source acceleration voltage and the collision cell was set to 1 kV, and argon was used as the collision gas. In a first approach, polysaccharides were released by aqueous hydrogen fluoride from different growth times between 5 and 20 h or between 28 and 96 h post-inoculation for planktonic and biofilm cultures, respectively, then analyzed by 1H NMR. As observed on Fig. 1, growth time did not have any visible influence on polysaccharide structure in planktonic phase, whereas it did in the biofilm phase. In particular, polysaccharides extracted from early (28 and 48 h) and late (72 and 96 h) biofilms exhibited different NMR spectra. Surprisingly, spectra from late biofilms were identical to all planktonic polysaccharides, whereas early biofilms showed identical simpler spectra. These were characterized by the disappearance of many NMR signals, in particular the easily observed signals at 4.91, 2.52, and 1.13 ppm, all other signals being identical. Thus, to appreciate the origin and the extent of the structural modifications that take place in the surface polysaccharide during biofilm growth, we first focused our study on the structural elucidation of the complex polysaccharide expressed in planktonic and late biofilm phases. A 13C,1H HSQC NMR experiments of total polysaccharide isolated from 5–20 h planktonic phase permitted identification of nine anomeric signals (I to IX) out of which four were tentatively assigned to α anomers (1JH,C ∼ 170 Hz, I, II, IV, V) and five to β anomers (1JH,C ∼ 160 Hz, III, VI, VII, VIII, IX) (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, eight 13C,1H signals were assigned to N-acetylated or N-acylated carbons according to their high field deshielded NMR parameters (Fig. 2D). These were later assigned as C2 of residues I, III, IV, V, VI, VII, and VIII as well as C4 of I residues by two-dimensional 1H,1H NMR experiments. Altogether, these experiments established the presence of nine monosaccharides, out of which seven were assigned to N-acetylated hexosamines and two to neutral hexoses. However, total assignment of individual spin systems was delicate at this stage of the study because of numerous overlaps of anomeric signals both in the proton (II and V; I and VI; VII and VIII) and in the carbon (I, IV, and V; II and VI; III and VIII) dimensions (Fig. 2A). Thus, to simplify the NMR spectra and gain access to its fine structure, we separated the total polysaccharide in two fractions using two different strategies (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3Purification schemes of HF-PS components. Two distinct components were separated using two different procedures. A, Ch HF-PS and Ne HF-PS were purified from total HF-PS by either mild acid hydrolysis or anion exchange chromatography. B, anion exchange chromatography separated a charged retained fraction (Ch HF-PS) from a neutral non-retained fraction (Ne HF-PS). C, mild acid hydrolysis followed by ethanol precipitation generated an acid labile fraction from an acid stable fraction, which subsequent structural analysis identified as Ch HF-PS and Ne HF-PS, respectively. The efficiency of acid hydrolysis was monitored along the hydrolysis steps (C). All purified fractions, as well as total HF-PS and intact B. cereus cells were analyzed by different combinations of analytical methods. *, contaminant non-carbohydrate signal.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The first strategy consisted of separating the native polysaccharides by strong anion exchange chromatography assuming that the total polysaccharide was constituted by two distinct macromolecules. As shown on Fig. 3B, the elution profile of intact polysaccharide on a strong anion exchange chromatography column by a gradient of sodium chloride generated two fractions; that is, one non-retained fraction and one retained fraction that were further individually analyzed. As will be explained in the following chapters, the retained polysaccharide, called Ch HF-PS for charged HF-PS, included one free carboxyl group that conferred a negative charge, whereas the non-retained polysaccharide was devoid of acidic group and was thus called Ne HF-PS for neutral HF-PS. The second strategy consisted of repetitively hydrolyzing the polysaccharide in mild acid conditions to generate two fractions, one acid stable and one acid labile. Liberated oligosaccharides were extracted by ethanol after each hydrolysis step, whereas the non-labile fraction was submitted to another hydrolysis step. These conditions, which were devised to maximize liberation of acidic labile domain as repeating units by preserving the acidic resistant domain, have been previously successfully used to generate fucosylated oligosaccharides from sponge polysaccharides (33Guerardel Y. Czeszak X. Sumanovski L.T. Karamanos Y. Popescu O. Strecker G. Misevic G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15591-15603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Mild acid hydrolysis of intact polysaccharide (HF-PS) permitted the generation of two fractions presenting different solubility in 70% alcohol solution (Fig. 3A). The stepwise monitoring of hydrolysis process showed that five hydrolysis steps were enough to cleave and liberate as an ethanol-soluble fraction all the acid labile fraction from the total polysaccharide, which represented about 70% of the initial polysaccharide (Fig. 3C). Structural analysis of acid stable and acid labile fractions (see after) showed that these two fractions presented identical structural features to Ne HF-PS and Ch HF-PS separated by anion exchange chromatography, albeit the depolymerization of Ch HF-PS after acid hydrolysis. Thus both strategies lead to the separation of HF-PS in two distinct fractions, Ne HF-PS and Ch HF-PS. As shown in Fig. 2, B and E, Ch HF-PS and Ne HF-PS exhibited totally different 13C,1H HSQC NMR spectra, establishing that they were devoid of any trans-contaminating material. Comparison of all fractions (Fig. 2) showed that the 13C,1H HSQC NMR spectrum of total HF-PS from planktonic phase is the result of the combination of Ch HF-PS and Ne HF-PS subspectra. Individual signal assignments established that Ch HF-PS consisted of three monosaccharide units (signals I to III) and Ne HF-PS of six units (IV to IX). Separation of polysaccharide in two fractions resolved most of the overlapping NMR signals and further enabled an exact interpretation of spectra of individual polysaccharides. Unexpectedly, we observed that II-H1 and III-H1chemical shifts slightly changed when Ch HF-PS was analyzed alone (II-H1 Δδ + 0.024; III-H1 Δδ −0.028) or in a mixture with Ne HF-PS. Although this phenomenon was never reported to our knowledge, we suggest that these variations arose from sugar-sugar interaction phenomena in a similar fashion that is observed during protein-protein interactions (34Zuiderweg E.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Altogether, these data strongly suggested that the total SCWP polysaccharide was constituted by two independent polysaccharides; one charged and acid labile polysaccharide (Ch HF-PS) and another neutral and acid stable polysaccharide (Ne HF-PS). Structural analysis of these two polysaccharides will permit (1Vollmer W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2008; 32: 287-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) the establishment of the nature of the structural differences between polysaccharides and (2Weidenmaier C. Peschel A. Xiong Y.Q.

Dis. 2005; 191: 1771-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) determine whether the structural differences between phases arise from the modification of a common polysaccharide core or from the specific induction of the two different polysaccharides. Six anomer signals (IV to IX) were identified on the 13C,1H HSQC spectrum of Ne HF-PS, establishing the presence of six different monosaccharide units, out of which five appeared to be hexosamines, according to the observation of five N-acetylated C2 signals between 49 and 57 ppm (IV- to VIII-C2). The nature of individual monosaccharides was established by a combination of NMR analysis of polysaccharide and gas chromatography analysis of partially methylated and acetylated reduced monosaccharides. In particular, spin systems of all units were assigned by NMR analysis using two-dimensional COSY, TOCSY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY), HSQC (decoupled or not), and HMBC experiments, and sequencing information was obtained by 1H,1H NOESY and 13C,1H HMBC experiments. Large 1JH,C coupling constant (178 Hz) and the deshielded IV-H1 value at 5.588 ppm established that IV unit exhibited an α configuration. Then, the total spin system and the 1H,1H vicinal coupling constant pattern of IV in which 3JH1,H2, 3JH2,H3, 3JH3,H4, and 3JH4,H5 were small (S), large (L), S and S (S/L/S/S) showed that this residue had an α-galacto configuration (35Koërner T.A. Prestegard J.H. Yu R.K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 38-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Finally, the upfield chemical shifts of IV-H2/C2 at δ 4.551/49.72 and the presence of an N-acetamido group at 1.999/23.62 ppm demonstrated that IV was an α-GalNAc residue (Table 1, Fig. 4). Deshielding of IV-C3, -C4, and -C6 chemical shift values at δ77.1, 75.2, and 68.6 compared with unsubstituted α-GalNAc residue (C3, Δδ + 8.5; C4, Δδ +5.5, and C6, Δδ +6.2) established that IV residue was trisubstituted in C3, C4, and C6 positions, in accordance with the splitting of H6 and H6′ signals at 3.907 and 3.636 ppm (36Bradbury J.H. Jenkins G.A. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 126: 125-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The presence of this unusual trisubstituted GalNAc residue was confirmed by linkage analysis in gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (supplemental Fig. S1). Similarly, despite the strong coupling constant that prevented the"
https://openalex.org/W2021191447,"DJ-1 was initially identified as an oncogene product involved in human tumorigenesis in cooperation with Ras. Increased DJ-1 expression is associated with tumorigenesis in many cancers, whereas the loss of DJ-1 function is linked to an autosomal recessive form of Parkinson's disease (PD). It has been reported that DJ-1 protects cells from TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand)-induced apoptosis. However, the mechanism by which DJ-1 is involved is still largely unknown. Here we show that DJ-1 inhibits TRAIL-induced apoptosis by blocking Fas-associated protein death domain (FADD)-mediated pro-caspase-8 activation. Wild-type DJ-1, but not the PD-associated mutant L166P, binds to FADD to inhibit the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). DJ-1 competes with pro-caspase-8 to bind to FADD at the death effector domain, thereby repressing the recruitment and activation of pro-caspase-8 to the active form of caspase-8. Thus, our study suggests that DJ-1 protects against TRAIL-induced apoptosis through the regulation of DISC formation."
https://openalex.org/W2087115521,"Heat shock factor Hsf1 is involved in the regulation of a variety of cellular processes including heat shock response, development and differentiation, aging, and tumorigenesis. Hsf1 transcriptional activity is tightly controlled through phosphorylation, sumoylation, and acetylation, and through association with a number of regulatory proteins. However, regulation of Hsf1 protein stability or turnover remains unknown. We have identified a novel Hsf1-interacting protein, FILIP-1L, that was found to bind to Hsf1 through yeast two-hybrid screening. FILIP-1L encodes multiple isoforms spanning from 711 to 1135 amino acid residues. FILIP-1L contains four coiled-coil and two N-terminal leucine zipper domains. Ectopic expression of FILIP-1L reduces the expression of the Hsf1 protein because FILIP-1L promotes Hsf1 ubiquitination and degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, leading to a reduction in Hsf1-mediated transcription. FILIP-1L, Hsf1, and the ubiquitin-binding domain of HhR23A, a receptor that transports polyubiquitinated proteins to the 19 S proteasome subunit targeting them for degradation, are found in a complex. This indicates that FILIP-1L is a potential adaptor that is involved in the Hsf1 degradation pathway.

Structurally Hsfs contain an N-terminal winged helix turn helix DNA-binding domain and an N-terminal hydrophobic heptad repeat (HR-A/B) that mediates trimerization of the Hsfs (1Morimoto R.I.

Hsfs also contain a regulatory domain, a C-terminal hydrophobic region (HR-C), and a transactivation domain. Within the Hsfs, only Hsf4 lacks the C-terminal hydrophobic region (1Morimoto R.I.

In mammalian cells, although the inter-relationship between Hsfs is complex, Hsf2 and Hsf4, which are expressed in specific tissues, mainly contribute to cellular differentiation (1Morimoto R.I.

In contrast, Hsf1 is expressed in all tissues and is involved in many cellular processes, and it is the main regulator of the heat shock response. Hsf1 is activated by heat shock and plays a complex function during early development, as well as during tumorigenesis as it potentiates p53-mediated tumorigenesis, and can impact the myelination process in the CNS (11Min J.N.

These proteins either exert negative regulation on Hsf1 transcriptional activity (e.g. Hsbp1), participate in the activation of Hsf1 (e.g. CHIP, Daxx), or confer a regulatory function toward Hsf1 in a specific signaling pathway (RalBP1, MTA1). Hsf1 is expressed in a monomeric form and is in complexes with Hsp90. Upon heat shock, Hsf1 is dissociated from the Hsp90 complexes (20Zou J. Guo Y. Guettouche T. Smith D.F. Voellmy R.

Hsf1 also interacts with Hsp70, and this suppresses its transcriptional activity (29Shi Y. Mosser D.D. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 654-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The interaction of Hsf1 with Cdc20 inhibits the interaction of Cdc20 with Cdc27, phosphorylation of Cdc27, and the ubiquitination activity of anaphase-promoting complex (28Lee Y.J. Kim E.H. Lee J.S. Jeoung D. Bae S. Kwon S.H. Lee Y.S. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 7550-7560Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interaction of Hsf1 with 14-3-3 at 37 °C leads to cytoplasmic sequestration and repression of Hsf1 activity. Ral-binding protein-1 (RalBP1) forms a complex with Hsf1 and Hsp90 under physiological growth conditions, and regulates the Hsf1-mediated heat shock response in the Ral-dependent signaling pathway (24Hu Y.

The phosphorylated Hsf1 has been shown to undergo ubiquitin-mediated degradation via the SCFβ-TrCP pathway in mitotic cells (28Lee Y.J. Kim E.H. Lee J.S. Jeoung D. Bae S. Kwon S.H. Lee Y.S. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 7550-7560Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism underlying Hsf1 protein turnover in interphase cells and during the heat shock response has not been elucidated.In the present study, we report another novel Hsf1-associating protein named filamin interacting protein 1-like (FILIP-1L) whose biological function is presently unclear. FILIP-1L is up-regulated in response to angiogenic inhibitors (30Tandle A.T. Mazzanti C. Alexander H.R. Roberts D.D. Libutti S.K. Cytokine. 2005; 30: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Overexpression of FILIP-1L in cells leads to an increase in cellular apoptosis and inhibition of cell growth and migration (31Kwon M. Hanna E. Lorang D. He M. Quick J.S. Adem A. Stevenson C. Chung J.Y. Hewitt S.M. Zudaire E. Esposito D. Cuttitta F. Libutti S.K. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 7332-7341Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We show that FILIP-1L forms complexes with Hsf1 and Hsp72 and ectopic expression of FILIP-1L reduces Hsf1 protein leading to inhibition of Hsf1-mediated transcription. FILIP-1L expression in cells leads to an increase in Hsf1 ubiquitination and its recruitment to the complexes with the UBA domain of hHR23A protein. We anticipate that hHR23A is a ubiquitin receptor involved in proteasomal degradation, promoting Hsf1 degradation through the UPS.DISCUSSIONHsf1 transcription factor activity is tightly regulated; however, whether Hsf1 is degraded during its cycles of activation and inactivation remain poorly understood. One study has found that in cells undergoing mitosis, Hsf1 can be ubiquitinated and degraded by the SCFβ-TriCP complex (28Lee Y.J. Kim E.H. Lee J.S. Jeoung D. Bae S. Kwon S.H. Lee Y.S. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 7550-7560Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination and degradation of Hsf1 by the SCFβ-TriCP complex only occurred during mitosis when the phosphorylated Hsf1 at serine 216 was released from the Cdc20 complex. Hsf1 was then found in SCFβ-TrCP complexes, ubiquitinated, and degraded (28Lee Y.J. Kim E.H. Lee J.S. Jeoung D. Bae S. Kwon S.H. Lee Y.S. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 7550-7560Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Another report indicates that anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) ubiquitin E3 ligase mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of another Hsf family member, Hsf2 through substrate recognition by both Cdc20 and Cdh1 (5Ahlskog J.K.

Degradation of Hsf2 was observed during the heat shock response. Comparable interactions or ubiquitination of Hsf1 was not detected (5Ahlskog J.K. Björk J.K. Elsing A.N. Aspelin C. Kallio M. Roos-Mattjus P. Sistonen L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 5608-5620Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).In the study reported here, we have found that a protein named FILIP-1L interacts with Hsf1. The function of FILIP-1L has not clearly been characterized. FILIP-1L encodes coiled-coiled, leucine zipper, and ATPase domains and exists as multiple isoforms in many cell types (30Tandle A.T. Mazzanti C. Alexander H.R. Roberts D.D. Libutti S.K. Cytokine. 2005; 30: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 31Kwon M. Hanna E. Lorang D. He M. Quick J.S. Adem A. Stevenson C.

Ectopic expression of FILIP-1L results in the inhibition of cellular proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. Furthermore, endothelial cells treated with angiogenic inhibitors up-regulate FILIP-1L expression. FILIP-1L expression in tumor vasculature reduces tumor cell proliferation in vivo (31Kwon M.

Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 7332-7341Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). FILIP-1L has been identified to be absent in ovarian cancer cells, but present in normal epithelial cells and was named down-regulated ovarian cancer protein 1 or DOC1 (35Mok S.C. Wong K.K. Chan R.K. Lau C.C. Tsao S.W. Knapp R.C. Berkowitz R.S. Gynecol. Oncol. 1994; 52: 247-252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We present evidence that Hsf1 interacts with FILIP-1L in the yeast two-hybrid system as well as in mammalian cells. The N-terminal fragment of FILIP-1L containing the leucine zipper domain interacts with the N-terminal hydrophobic region of Hsf1 that is required for its trimerization and transcriptional activity. Interestingly, the Hsf1 and FILIP-1L interaction, which also contains Hsp72 in the complexes leads to polyubiquitination and degradation of Hsf1 protein. Cells co-expressing Hsf1 and FILIP-1L exhibit reduction in the Hsf1 protein level, and inhibition of Hsf1 stress granule formation following exposure to heat shock. Ectopic expression of full-length FILIP-1L most efficiently degraded the endogenous Hsf1 protein or Hsf1 protein containing short tags. Additionally, FILIP-1L expression in cells also inhibits Hsf1-mediated transcriptional activity. Because the FILIP-1L protein appears to lack an E3 ligase domain and we were unable to show E3 ligase activity of FILIP-1L using an in vitro transcription/translation system (data not shown), we performed experiments to determine whether FILIP-1L acts as a scaffold mediating ubiquitination and degradation of Hsf1. To determine whether there could be additional proteins that may be involved in the transfer of Hsf1 to the proteasome, we used full-length hHR23A (hPlic-1, Chap1/hPlic-2) as well as the HhR23A UBA domain, which is a known ubiquitin receptor (33Dantuma N.P. Heinen C. Hoogstraten D. DNA Repair. 2009; 8: 449-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 34Hurley J.H. Lee S. Prag G. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). We were able to detect Hsf1, FILIP-1L, and the hHR23A UBA domain in the same complex, suggesting that the hHR23A UBA domain could be an intermediate molecule delivering the ubiquitinated Hsf1 to the UPS. HhR23A was originally identified as a protein that has UBA and UBL domains in yeast (33Dantuma N.P. Heinen C. Hoogstraten D. DNA Repair. 2009; 8: 449-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The UBL domain is recognized by S5a, which is a subunit of the proteasome. Based on the domains present in the ubiquitin receptors, they most likely transport ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome. HhR23A (Rad23) has been identified to bind the E6-AP ubiquitin ligase, and it has been shown to target the polyubiquitinated p53 and Png1 proteins to the UPS. The UBA domain of hHR23A binds the ubiquitinated p53, protecting the molecule from deubiquitination, whereas the UBL domain of hHR23A transfers the ubiquitinated p53 to the UPS. Png1, which is a deglycosylating enzyme, is able to transfer ubiquitinated proteins to the UPS (36Kim I. Ahn J. Liu C. Tanabe K. Apodaca J. Suzuki T. Rao H. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The speculation is that the substrate specificity of Rad23A or other ubiquitin-binding proteins may be defined by other adaptor proteins. We can envision that FILIP-1L may be such an adaptor protein for the transport of ubiquitinated Hsf1 to the UPS system. As to what is the exact function of FILIP-1L, we show that hHR23A does not directly interact with Hsf1 but that Hsf1, through its interaction with the adaptor protein FILIP-1L, is transported to the UPS via the HhR23A UBA domain.In conclusion, we have identified the adaptor protein FILIP-1L to interact with Hsf1 and facilitate its ubiquitination and degradation. FILIP-1L and Hsf1 complexes are transported to the proteasome, likely via Class 1 UBA domain containing ubiquitin receptors such as hHR23A. IntroductionThe heat shock response is controlled by a family of heat shock transcription factors (Hsfs) 2The abbreviations used are: Hsfheat shock transcription factorFILIP-1Lfilamin A-interacting protein 1-likeUPSubiquitin-proteosome system. that consist of Hsf-1, -2, -3, and -4, whose expression and activities are differentially regulated (1Morimoto R.I.

Structurally Hsfs contain an N-terminal winged helix turn helix DNA-binding domain and an N-terminal hydrophobic heptad repeat (HR-A/B) that mediates trimerization of the Hsfs (1Morimoto R.I.

Hsfs also contain a regulatory domain, a C-terminal hydrophobic region (HR-C), and a transactivation domain. Within the Hsfs, only Hsf4 lacks the C-terminal hydrophobic region (1Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar, 3Nakai A. Tanabe M. Kawazoe Y. Inazawa J. Morimoto R.I. Nagata K. Mol. Cell.

In mammalian cells, although the inter-relationship between Hsfs is complex, Hsf2 and Hsf4, which are expressed in specific tissues, mainly contribute to cellular differentiation (1Morimoto R.I.

In contrast, Hsf1 is expressed in all tissues and is involved in many cellular processes, and it is the main regulator of the heat shock response. Hsf1 is activated by heat shock and plays a complex function during early development, as well as during tumorigenesis as it potentiates p53-mediated tumorigenesis, and can impact the myelination process in the CNS (11Min J.N.

These modifications can modulate Hsf1 transcriptional activity through impacting the structure of Hsf1 and its interaction with other proteins.

These proteins either exert negative regulation on Hsf1 transcriptional activity (e.g. Hsbp1), participate in the activation of Hsf1 (e.g. CHIP, Daxx), or confer a regulatory function toward Hsf1 in a specific signaling pathway (RalBP1, MTA1). Hsf1 is expressed in a monomeric form and is in complexes with Hsp90. Upon heat shock, Hsf1 is dissociated from the Hsp90 complexes (20Zou J. Guo Y. Guettouche T. Smith D.F. Voellmy R.

Hsf1 also interacts with Hsp70, and this suppresses its transcriptional activity (29Shi Y. Mosser D.D. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 654-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The interaction of Hsf1 with Cdc20 inhibits the interaction of Cdc20 with Cdc27, phosphorylation of Cdc27, and the ubiquitination activity of anaphase-promoting complex (28Lee Y.J. Kim E.H. Lee J.S. Jeoung D. Bae S. Kwon S.H. Lee Y.S. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 7550-7560Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interaction of Hsf1 with 14-3-3 at 37 °C leads to cytoplasmic sequestration and repression of Hsf1 activity. Ral-binding protein-1 (RalBP1) forms a complex with Hsf1 and Hsp90 under physiological growth conditions, and regulates the Hsf1-mediated heat shock response in the Ral-dependent signaling pathway (24Hu Y. Mivechi N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17299-17306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated Hsf1 has been shown to undergo ubiquitin-mediated degradation via the SCFβ-TrCP pathway in mitotic cells (28Lee Y.J. Kim E.H. Lee J.S. Jeoung D. Bae S. Kwon S.H. Lee Y.S. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 7550-7560Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism underlying Hsf1 protein turnover in interphase cells and during the heat shock response has not been elucidated.In the present study, we report another novel Hsf1-associating protein named filamin interacting protein 1-like (FILIP-1L) whose biological function is presently unclear. FILIP-1L is up-regulated in response to angiogenic inhibitors (30Tandle A.T. Mazzanti C. Alexander H.R. Roberts D.D. Libutti S.K. Cytokine. 2005; 30: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Overexpression of FILIP-1L in cells leads to an increase in cellular apoptosis and inhibition of cell growth and migration (31Kwon M. Hanna E. Lorang D. He M. Quick J.S. Adem A. Stevenson C. Chung J.Y. Hewitt S.M. Zudaire E. Esposito D. Cuttitta F. Libutti S.K. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 7332-7341Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We show that FILIP-1L forms complexes with Hsf1 and Hsp72 and ectopic expression of FILIP-1L reduces Hsf1 protein leading to inhibition of Hsf1-mediated transcription. FILIP-1L expression in cells leads to an increase in Hsf1 ubiquitination and its recruitment to the complexes with the UBA domain of hHR23A protein. We anticipate that hHR23A is a ubiquitin receptor involved in proteasomal degradation, promoting Hsf1 degradation through the UPS."

The activity of the enzyme is pH-dependent, with its highest activity occurring at pH 4–5. To probe the response of the solution structure of Cel7A to changes in pH, we measured small angle neutron scattering of it in a series of solutions having pH values of 7.0, 6.0, 5.3, and 4.2. As the pH decreases from 7.0 to 5.3, the enzyme structure remains well defined, possessing a spatial differentiation between the cellulose binding domain and the catalytic core that only changes subtly. At pH 4.2, the solution conformation of the enzyme changes to a structure that is intermediate between a properly folded enzyme and a denatured, unfolded state, yet the secondary structure of the enzyme is essentially unaltered. The results indicate that at the pH of optimal activity, the catalytic core of the enzyme adopts a structure in which the compact packing typical of a fully folded polypeptide chain is disrupted and suggest that the increased range of structures afforded by this disordered state plays an important role in the increased activity of Cel7A through conformational selection.

Lignocellulosic biomass has the potential to be a plentiful feedstock for the production of biofuels. One of the main challenges to realizing this renewable energy source lies in mastering the process of producing fermentable sugars from the recalcitrant complex of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin that comprises lignocellulosic biomass. The fungus Trichoderma reesei (now classified as an anamorph of Hypocrea jecorina) breaks down biomass to meet its energy demands (1Fägerstam L.G. Pettersson L.G. Engstrom J.A.

Due to its high levels of enzyme production, T. reesei is the primary commercial source of cellulases. Developing a fundamental understanding of their enzymatic mechanisms is one key to engineering improvements capable of increasing biofuel yields from biomass. Of key interest among these enzymes is the cellobiohydrolase I (Cel7A) 5The abbreviations used are: Cel7Acellobiohydrolase ISANSsmall angle neutron scatteringSAXSsmall angle x-ray scattering. due to its ability to bind to and disrupt the surface of crystalline cellulose (3Lee I. Evans B.R. Woodward J. Ultramicroscopy. 2000; 82: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). As Cel7A progresses along the cellulose surface, the glucan chain that enters the active site tunnel is processively cleaved, releasing cellobiose (glucose dimer) units that are later hydrolyzed to glucose by the T. reesei β-glucosidase. The disruption of the cellulose surface by Cel7A also enables the endoglucanases and cellobiohydrolase II (Cel6) to degrade the cellulose chains further. These synergistic interactions result in rapid hydrolysis of crystalline cellulose. Thus, Cel7A carries out a critical first step in producing sugars that can be readily fermented into bioethanol. cellobiohydrolase I small angle neutron scattering small angle x-ray scattering. Cellobiohydrolases such as Cel7A share a common organization of three general domains (4Shoemaker S. Schweickart V. Ladner M. Gelfand D. Kwok S. Myambo K. Innis M.

The tertiary structure of Cel7A has been studied using a variety of techniques.

Isoforms having pI values between 3.5 and 4.2 are found depending on the growth conditions and the specific strain of the fungus (8Stals I. Sandra K. Devreese B. Van Beeumen J. Claeyssens M. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 9Stals I. Sandra K. Geysens S. Contreras R. Van Beeumen J. Claeyssens M. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 713-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The mechanism driving the increased catalytic activity at acidic pH remains to be explored. It is possible that the pH-driven changes in the protonation states of key residues are responsible for the increase in activity. The pI of the catalytic core of the enzyme is very near the peak in the activity of the enzyme. A physical mechanism may also play a role in the activity of the enzyme. Changes in the relationship between the cellulose binding domain and the catalytic core could impact access of cellulose to the active site of the enzyme. A structural characterization of the enzyme as a function of pH is required to understand the activity of the enzyme better. Here, we present a small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) study of the structure of Cel7A in a series of solutions of decreasing pH ranging from 7.0 to 4.2, the latter being the pH at which the enzyme is known to be the most active. At the higher pH values measured, the structure has features that are consistent with the high resolution structures of the catalytic core of the enzyme (10Divne C. Ståhlberg J. Reinikainen T.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7241-7257Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The SANS data of Cel7A collected at pH 4.2 demonstrate that the enzyme undergoes a pH-dependent conformational change. Analysis and modeling of the SANS data indicate that the change is consistent with the catalytic core of the enzyme transitioning to a state intermediate between the compact structure determined by crystallography (10Divne C. Ståhlberg J. Reinikainen T. Ruohonen L. Pettersson G. Knowles J.K.C. Teeri T.T. Jones T.A. Science. 1994; 265: 524-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 11Divne C. Ståhlberg J. Teeri T.T. Jones T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 309-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) and a fully denatured ensemble. The scattering at pH 4.2 is not consistent with an ensemble of structures generated using the available high resolution structures of the domains of the enzyme (10Divne C. Ståhlberg J. Reinikainen T.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7241-7257Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) connected by flexible linkers. The results provide new insight into the structural basis for the pH-dependent activity of the enzyme that suggests that conformational selection (21Boehr D.D. Nussinov R. Wright P.E. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar, 22Csermely P. Palotai R. Nussinov R. Trends Biochem.

Biol. 2010; 14: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) plays an important role in the function of the enzyme. Cel7A was purified from a commercial culture filtrate produced by submerged fermentation of T. reesei QM9414 (Sigma-Aldrich) by ion-exchange and chromatofocusing chromatography using a method described previously (24Evans B.R. Margalit R. Woodward J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). An AKTA basic chromatography system (GE Healthcare) was used for chromatofocusing and gel filtration. Polybuffer 74 was removed from the Cel7A following chromatofocusing by gel filtration on Superdex-200 (GE Healthcare) in 50 mm sodium citrate at the desired pH values for the studies. The Cel7A eluted as a single peak with a retention time consistent with elution of Cel7A monomers based on the reported molecular mass (25Woodward J. Brown J.P. Evans B.R. Affholter K.A. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1994; 19: 141-153PubMed Google Scholar). The purified enzyme was shown by isoelectric focusing with a Phast Gel system (GE Healthcare) to have a major band with pI of 4.2 and a minor band with pI of 4.0. CD measurements for Cel7A were collected at the series of pH values (4.2, 5.3, 6.0, and 7.0) using a Jasco J-810 CD spectrometer. Data were collected at room temperature in 1-mm path length quartz cuvettes. Spectra were recorded every 0.1 nm from 250 to 190 nm, but strong absorption by the buffer caused the data quality to be unacceptable below 200 nm. SANS measurements were performed using the Center for Structural Molecular Biology Bio-SANS instrument at the High Flux Isotope Reactor of Oak Ridge National Laboratory (26Lynn G.W. Heller W. Urban V. Wignall G.D. Weiss K. Myles D.A.A. Physica B. 2006; 385–86: 880-882Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The wavelength was 6.0 Å, and the wavelength spread, Δλ/λ, was set to 0.14. To provide sufficient q range for the data analysis (0.025 Å−1 to 0.25 Å−1), a single sample-to-detector distance was used, namely 1.1 m. Both the pH 4.2 and 5.3 data were measured at an additional sample-to-detector distance, namely 6.8 m, to provide additional low q data (down to ∼0.007 Å−1) to verify that the samples were free of high molecular mass contaminants and aggregates at low pH. Data were corrected for transmission, detector sensitivity, dark current (electronic noise), and sample background according to standard procedures. The corrected data were azimuthally averaged to produce the one-dimensional intensity profile I(q) versus q. The small angle scattering intensity profile of monodisperse, identical particles in solution is given by Equation 1 (27Guinier A. Fournet G. Small-angle Scattering of X-rays. Wiley, New York1955Google Scholar), I(q)=|〈∫V(ρ(r→)−ρs)e−iq→·r→d3r〉|2,(Eq. 1) where ρ(r→) is the scattering length density of the particle as a function of position r→ within the particle volume V; ρs is the scattering length density of the solvent; and q→ is the momentum transfer, having the magnitude q = 4πsin(θ)/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle and λ is the wavelength. The integration in Equation 1 is an ensemble and orientational average over all particles in the incident beam. The radius of gyration, Rg, was determined according to Guinier and Fournet (27Guinier A. Fournet G. Small-angle Scattering of X-rays. Wiley, New York1955Google Scholar). Data were also analyzed for the distance distribution function, P(r). P(r) provides the frequency of distances between scattering centers within an object. The scattered intensity I(q) is related to P(r) by the Fourier transform in Equation 2, P(r)=12π2∫0∞dq·(qr)·I(q)sin(qr).(Eq. 2) The indirect Fourier transform algorithm implemented in the software GNOM (28Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2875) Google Scholar) was used to determine P(r) from measured intensity profiles. The boundary conditions P(r) = 0 at r = 0 and at the maximum linear dimension, dmax, were imposed to ensure proper behavior. dmax was a free parameter in the fitting. In addition to providing dmax, P(r) fitting also provides a second measure of Rg, which is the second moment of P(r). The uncertainty in dmax was estimated by testing GNOM with dmax values near the best fitting value. All data were analyzed over the same q range to provide consistency in the information content in the data. Kratky plots (q2I(q) versus q) (29Kriste R.G. Oberthür R.C. Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, New York1982: 387-431Google Scholar) were produced from the SANS data. A Kratky plot accentuates the scattering data at higher q values, making the decay behavior of the scattering curve readily apparent. It is known that a compact particle small angle scattering curve decays as q−4 (30Porod V.G. Kolloid Z. 1951; 124: 83-114Crossref Scopus (1524) Google Scholar), whereas a random polymer chain decays as q−1 (29Kriste R.G. Oberthür R.C. Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, New York1982: 387-431Google Scholar). Kratky plots are useful for differentiating between compact and unfolded structures (31Doniach S. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 1763-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). A Kratky plot will display a slope of +1 at high q for a completely unfolded protein and a slope of −2 for a compact protein. Kratky plots are highly sensitive to background subtraction issues that can result from the incoherent scattering of neutrons by hydrogen. To build confidence in the plots, a constant base line was applied, and several values of the base line on the order of the experimental uncertainty in the data were tested to ensure that the features observed were not the result of subtle errors in background correction. Structural modeling of Cel7A from the SANS data was accomplished using two different approaches. Restoration of the molecular envelope of the enzyme from the SANS data, representing the shape of the surface of the structure, was accomplished through the use of GA_STRUCT (32Heller W.T. Krueger J.K. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10579-10588Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). All data were modeled over the same q range to provide consistency in the information content in the data. A set of 25 models was generated from each SANS dataset and used to produce the consensus envelope, representing the structure consistent across the set of models. Additional structural modeling employed the ensemble optimization modeling method described by Bernado and co-workers (33Bernadó P. Mylonas E. Petoukhov M.V. Blackledge M. Svergun D.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 5656-5664Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). The modeling employed the crystallographic structure of the catalytic core of Cel7A (Protein Data Bank ID code 1CEL) (10Divne C. Ståhlberg J. Reinikainen T. Ruohonen L. Pettersson G. Knowles J.K.C. Teeri T.T. Jones T.A. Science. 1994; 265: 524-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) to which hydrogen atoms were added using the software WHAT-IF (34Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3343) Google Scholar) and the NMR structure of the cellulose binding domain (12Kraulis P.J. Clore G.M. Nilges M. Jones T.A. Pettersson G. Knowles J. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7241-7257Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). It was not possible to create gylycosylated models using the software. However, because the total molecular mass of the sugars is much smaller than the total molecular mass of the enzyme, the resulting structures are reasonable representations of the conformations adopted by the enzyme in solution. The default options were used for the calculations with the exception of the number of points generated for the intensity calculation (101 instead of the default 51). The H++ method (35Gordon J.C. Myers J.B. Folta T. Shoja V. Heath L.S. Onufriev A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W368-W371Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 36Myers J. Grothaus G. Narayanan S. Onufriev A. Proteins. 2006; 63: 928-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) was employed to calculate approximate pKa values of all the residues of Cel7A from the 6CEL (11Divne C. Ståhlberg J. Teeri T.T. Jones T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 309-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) crystal structure. This method is based on classical continuum electrostatics and statistical mechanics calculations. A residue was considered as protonated when its pKa value is larger than the pH of the solution. The CD spectra for Cel7A collected at the four pH values is shown in Fig. 1. The spectra indicate a very high β-structure content, as is expected based on the known structures of the domains of the enzyme (10Divne C. Ståhlberg J. Reinikainen T. Ruohonen L. Pettersson G. Knowles J.K.C. Teeri T.T. Jones T.A. Science. 1994; 265: 524-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 11Divne C. Ståhlberg J. Teeri T.T. Jones T.A. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7241-7257Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The data indicate that the secondary structure of the protein does not change significantly in response to decreasing the pH from 7.0 to 4.2. The SANS intensity profiles for Cel7A measured at the four pH values and the associated Guinier fits (27Guinier A. Fournet G. Small-angle Scattering of X-rays. Wiley, New York1955Google Scholar) are shown in FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, respectively. Beam time limitations did not allow the pH 6.0 and pH 7.0 samples to be measured in both configurations. Instead, only the shorter of the two instrument configurations were measured, yet the minimum q value accessible to this configuration (0.025/Å) is sufficient for the data analysis and modeling for a particle of this size, as can be seen in the two datasets collected at lower pH. The scattering data collected under the three solution conditions have a similar overall character, indicating that the gross features of the structures are similar. However, a clear difference is seen in the high q data, for which the profile collected at pH 4.2 lacks the break in the slope above q = 0.15 Å−1 visible in the three datasets collected at higher pH. This difference at high q is highlighted in Fig. 2B, where the pH 5.3 and pH 4.2 data are shown scaled relative to one another. The Guinier plots, which used all of the data available for each sample, are linear, suggesting that the particles are free of significant interparticle interference and aggregation. The Rg values of the pH 7.0, 6.0, 5.3, and 4.2 structures are 26.1 ± 2.1 Å, 26.1 ± 2.3 Å, 29.7 ± 1.2 Å, and 28.0 ± 1.4 Å, respectively.FIGURE 3Guinier plots and fits for the SANS data collected for Cel7A at pH 7.0 (▿), 6.0 (▴), 5.3 (○), and 4.2 (■). The fit curves are the solid black lines. The curves have been offset for clarity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The P(r) profiles derived from the SANS data using GNOM are shown in Fig. 4. All of the fittings utilized the same q range to ensure reliable comparison. The profiles have very similar shapes and positions for the main peak, being at 27–28 Å. At the two highest pH values studied, the profiles trail off to a dmax of 90 ± 5 Å. There are subtle differences between the profiles, with the P(r) found at pH 7.0 having a clear indication of a shoulder near 65 Å that does not exist in the profile derived from the pH 6.0 data. The P(r) derived from the pH 5.3 data has a clear secondary maximum at 85 Å that provides a dmax of 110 ± 5 Å. Finally, at pH 4.2, the P(r) contracts slightly to a dmax of 100 ± 5 Å, and there is no secondary maximum. Instead, the profile decays with a tail to dmax. Kratky plots generated from the data are shown in Fig. 5. The data collected at pH 7.0, 6.0, and 5.3 possess a single peak and decay to zero at higher q values. This behavior is consistent with both a compact particle (31Doniach S. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 1763-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and with structured domains connected by a flexible linker (37Bernado P. Eur. Biophys. J. Biophys. Lett. 2010; 39: 769-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The relative sizes of the catalytic core and the remainder of the structure raise the possibility that the effect of changes in their spatial relationship may not be visible on a Kratky plot. In contrast, the SANS data collected for Cel7A at pH 4.2 do not decay to zero at higher q values. Instead, the data level off to a non-zero value after decaying from the maximum value. Such a Kratky plot clearly indicates the presence of increased disorder and/or flexibility in the structure, which is intermediate between a fully folded, compact structure and a completely denatured configurational ensemble of random coil structures (31Doniach S. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 1763-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Shape restoration was applied to the SANS data using the program GA_STRUCT (32Heller W.T. Krueger J.K. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10579-10588Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) to visualize the shape of the enzyme in solution. The resulting consensus envelopes for the pH values studied are shown in Fig. 6. The structures do not differ greatly, being ellipsoidal structures roughly twice as long as they are wide. The similarity of the models is consistent with the P(r) analysis, including the increased length of the pH 5.3 structure. The catalytic core of Cel7A is egg-shaped (10Divne C. Ståhlberg J. Reinikainen T. Ruohonen L. Pettersson G. Knowles J.K.C. Teeri T.T. Jones T.A. Science. 1994; 265: 524-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 11Divne C. Ståhlberg J. Teeri T.T. Jones T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 309-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), and it is 67 Å long with a cross-sectional width that varies between 41 and 57 Å at the widest point. All of the models generated from the SANS data are clearly narrowed toward one end of the structure. The widest points of the models are ∼45 Å, which is in reasonable agreement with the high resolution structure in light of the nature of the consensus envelopes (32Heller W.T. Krueger J.K. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10579-10588Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The narrowed ends of the models suggest a separation of the cellulose binding domain from the catalytic core. A model produced in this manner is the single structure that best fits what are in fact data from an ensemble of structures that results from the unstructured nature of the linker connecting the two domains and the very small size of the linker and cellulose binding domain relative to the catalytic core. Therefore, the narrowed end of the model structures should be considered only to represent an average region of density resulting from these structures rather than a distinct location occupied by the structures. The volumes of the consensus envelopes at pH 7.0, 6.0, and 4.2 are consistent and are in reasonable agreement with the expected volume of the enzyme (∼65,000 Å3). In contrast, the volume of the consensus envelope derived from the pH 5.3 data is ∼30% larger than expected, which raises the possibility that the enzyme has adopted a more flexible conformation than in the other pH conditions that gives rise to a larger ensemble of structures (38Heller W.T. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The Kratky plot at pH 5.3 does deca"

Aberrant regulation of NF-κB and the signaling pathways that regulate its activity have been involved in various pathologies, particularly cancers, as well as inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. NF-κB activation is tightly regulated by the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which is composed of two catalytic subunits IKKα and IKKβ, and a regulatory subunit IKKγ/NEMO. Although IKKα and IKKβ share structural similarities, IKKα has been shown to have distinct biological functions. However, the molecular mechanisms that modulate IKKα activity have not yet been fully elucidated. To understand better the regulation of IKKα activity, we purified IKKα-associated proteins and identified ABIN-2. Here, we demonstrate that IKKα and IKKβ both interact with ABIN-2 and impair its constitutive degradation by the proteasome. Nonetheless, ABIN-2 enhances IKKα- but not IKKβ-mediated NF-κB activation by specifically inducing IKKα autophosphorylation and kinase activity. Furthermore, we found that ABIN-2 serine 146 is critical for the ABIN-2-dependent IKKα transcriptional up-regulation of specific NF-κB target genes. These results imply that ABIN-2 acts as a positive regulator of NF-κB-dependent transcription by activating IKKα.

Once activated, IKK phosphorylates the IκB inhibitory proteins on two specific serine residues (e.g. serines 32 and 36 of IκBα), leading to their ubiquitination by the multisubunit SCFβ-TrCP E3 ligase and subsequent proteosomal degradation, which in turn allows NF-κB dimers to translocate to the nucleus and activate the transcription of their specific target genes (13Hoffmann A.

Although IKKα and IKKβ share a high degree of sequence similarity, they have largely distinct functions, due to their different substrate specificities and modes of regulation. IKKβ (and IKKγ) is essential for rapid and transient NF-κB induction by proinflammatory signaling cascades, such as those triggered by TNFα or LPS, via the “classical NF-κB pathway” that mainly relies on IκBα degradation (19Ghosh S.

Nonetheless, there is evidence indicating that IKKα contributes to cytokine-induced IκBα phosphorylation and subsequent degradation, thus participating in the classical NF-κB activation pathway as well. For instance, IKKα is essential for efficient TNFα-induced IκBα phosphorylation in HeLa cells (24Adli M. Merkhofer E. Cogswell P. Baldwin A.S. PLoS One. 2010; 5: e9428Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and it has been reported that IKKα is also required for receptor activator of nuclear factor κ-B ligand (RANKL) mediated classical NF-κB activation in mammary epithelial cells (25Cao Y. Bonizzi G. Seagroves T.N. Greten F.R. Johnson R. Schmidt E.V. Karin M. Cell. 2001; 107: 763-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IKKα exerts nuclear NF-κB transcriptional activating functions through the control of histone phosphorylation (26Yamamoto Y. Verma U.N. Prajapati S. Kwak Y.T. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 2003; 423: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 27Anest V. Hanson J.L. Cogswell P.C. Steinbrecher K.A. Strahl B.D. Baldwin A.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 659-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) and can also act in specific cell types as a negative mediator of NF-κB activation by attenuating IKKβ-driven NF-κB activation or modulating RelA Ser-536 phosphorylation (28Lawrence T. Bebien M. Liu G.Y. Nizet V. Karin M. Nature. 2005; 434: 1138-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 29Li Q. Lu Q. Bottero V. Estepa G. Morrison L. Mercurio F. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 12425-12430Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). IKKα is also involved in epidermal differentiation, but independently of its kinase activity (30Li Q. Lu Q. Hwang J.Y.

Nature. 2001; 410: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). IKKα and IKKβ activation is dependent on phosphorylation of specific serine residues located within the activation loop (T loop), either by upstream kinases or by trans-autophosphorylation (33Mercurio F.

Chem. 2006; 281: 15268-15276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, conformational changes by protein interactions may also be a mechanism to stimulate IKK activity. For example, Cdc37 and Hsp90 form a chaperone complex with IKKα/β that is required for IKK activation in response to TNFα and DNA damage (37Chen G. Cao P. Goeddel D.V. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 401-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 38Hinz M. Broemer M. Arslan S.C. Otto A. Mueller E.C. Dettmer R. Scheidereit C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 29233-29241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Because IKKα is involved in many ways in the regulation of NF-κB activity, the possibility that IKKα-interacting proteins might specifically regulate its activity is a crucial issue with profound implications toward specific NF-κB response. We have purified IKKα-associated proteins in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), and mass spectrometry analysis of the copurified proteins revealed the presence of A20-binding inhibitor of NF-κB (ABIN-2) (40Van Huffel S. Delaei F. Heyninck K. De Valck D. Beyaert R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30216-30223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 41Verstrepen L. Carpentier I. Verhelst K. Beyaert R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2009; 78: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In the study presented here, we show that IKKα and IKKβ both interact with ABIN-2 and impair its constitutive degradation by the proteasome. Nonetheless, ABIN-2 increases IKKα but not IKKβ-mediated NF-κB activation by specifically increasing IKKα autophosphorylation and kinase activity. In addition, we found that ABIN-2 serine 146 is critical for ABIN-2-dependent IKKα transcriptional up-regulation of specific NF-κB target genes. The antibodies were purchased from Abcam (E tag), Roche Diagnostic (HA), Sigma (FLAG, β-actin), Cell Signaling (IKKβ, phospho-IκBα serine 32–36, phospho-IKKα/β serine 176/180), BD Biosciences Pharmingen (IKKα), Santa Cruz Biotechnology (RelA, RelB, cRel, IκBα, p105/p50, p100/p52, ABIN-2), Southern Biotech (R-phycoerythrin conjugated anti-rat), and Molecular Probes (Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse). MG132 and murine recombinant TNFα were purchased from Calbiochem and Sigma, respectively. Expression vectors for E tag-ABIN-1 and -ABIN-2 were obtained from R. Beyaert (Ghent University, Zwijnaarde, Belgium). FLAG-ABIN-2 and GST-ABIN-2 from S. C. Ley (National Institute for Medical Research, MillHill, UK). GST-IκBα(1–54), wild-type HA-IKKα and HA-IKKβ, and kinase-inactive K44M mutants (KD) of HA-IKKα and HA-IKKβ were from M. Karin (University of California, San Diego, CA). FLAG-IKKα and FLAG-IKKβ were from M. Hu (University of Texas, Houston, TX). HA-Ub WT and mutants were from C. Pique (Institut Cochin, Paris, France), and 3×NF-κB-luciferase reporter was from D. Baltimore (California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA). pTrip-ABIN-2 was generated by subcloning human full-length ABIN-2 cDNA into pTRIP-ΔU3-EF1α-IRES GFP lentiviral vector (42Kieusseian A. Chagraoui J. Kerdudo C. Mangeot P.E. Gage P.J. Navarro N. Izac B. Uzan G. Forget B.G. Dubart-Kupperschmitt A. Blood. 2006; 107: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). GST-ABIN-2 deletion mutants were obtained by subcloning ABIN-2 coding sequences from amino acids 1–97 (Δ1), 94–184 (Δ2), 180–279 (Δ3), 275–345 (Δ4), and 348–429 (Δ5) following standard recombinant DNA procedures; and details are available upon request. GST-ABIN-2 point mutants were generated by substituting serine 2, 7, 62, 113, 129, 140, and 146 to alanine using site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing. HEK293, 293T, HeLa and MEF cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin. For transfections, 106 HEK293 cells in 35-mm dishes were transfected with 0.8–1 μg of DNA using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) as described (43Baud V. Liu Z.G. Bennett B. Suzuki N. Xia Y. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1297-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection. Production of infectious recombinant lentiviruses was performed by transient transfection of 293T cells as described in Ref. 42Kieusseian A. Chagraoui J. Kerdudo C. Mangeot P.E. Gage P.J. Navarro N. Izac B. Uzan G. Forget B.G. Dubart-Kupperschmitt A. Blood. 2006; 107: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar. For infections, 105 cells in 35-mm dishes were transduced with 5000 ng/ml p24 (HIV-1 capsid protein). 48 h later, cells were washed, and fresh medium was added. The culture was then continued as described above. The approach was adapted from the method described by de Boer et al. based on efficient biotinylation in vivo and single-step purification of tagged transcription factors in mammalian cells (44de Boer E. Rodriguez P. Bonte E. Krijgsveld J. Katsantoni E. Heck A. Grosveld F. Strouboulis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 7480-7485Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Briefly, we first generated a lentiviral vector named pTRIP-BirA by subcloning the bacterial protein-biotin ligase BirA cDNA into the lentiviral vector pTRIP-ΔU3-EF1α-IRES GFP (42Kieusseian A. Chagraoui J. Kerdudo C. Mangeot P.E. Gage P.J. Navarro N. Izac B. Uzan G. Forget B.G. Dubart-Kupperschmitt A. Blood. 2006; 107: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and then subcloned the cDNA encoding full-length IKKα tagged at the N terminus by a peptide of 23 amino acids that can be biotinylated by BirA in vivo (IKKα-BP). IKKα-deficient MEFs were then stably transduced with either pTRIP-BirA empty vector or pTRIP-BirA expressing IKKα-BP. Following large scale cell culture, cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were incubated with streptavidin beads. Eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then stained with Colloidal blue. Each entire lane was divided into 2–3-mm gel slices (at least 20 gel plugs/lane) that were each treated by an in-gel-digested method using modified trypsin and further analyzed by nanoflow liquid chromatography-tandem coupled to a Q-TOF system. Data base searches were performed using MASCOT and Profound. Cells seeded on coverslips were transfected using Lipofectamine. 24 h later, cells were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 25 min, washed twice in PBS, and permeabilized for 15 min in 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature. After blocking with 10% FBS in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, cells were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the primary antibody in 3% FBS in PBS, washed twice in PBS, and further incubated with the fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. After two washes in PBS, the coverslips were mounted with Vectashield® mounting medium containing 1.5 μg/ml DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Fluorescence imaging was performed using a Leica DMI6000 inverted microscope and a MicroMAX-1300Y/HS (Princeton Instruments) camera using the Metamorph v.7 software (Molecular Devices). Coimmunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as reported in Ref. 45Jacque E. Tchenio T. Piton G. Romeo P.H. Baud V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 14635-14640Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar. EMSAs were realized as described in Ref. 45Jacque E. Tchenio T. Piton G. Romeo P.H. Baud V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 14635-14640Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar. For supershift assays, nuclear extracts were incubated with specific antibodies for 30 min on ice before incubation with the labeled probe. For IKK immunocomplex kinase assays, transfected cells were collected in whole cell lysis buffer (300 mm NaCl, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.7, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100 supplemented with 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium salt, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 100 μm Na3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, 1 × Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics)). HA-IKKα or HA-IKKβ was immunoprecipitated from 100 μg of cell lysates with HA antibody for 2 h or overnight at 4 °C, after which protein A/G-agarose beads were added and incubation continued for 90 min at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were collected, washed three times in lysis buffer and once in kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2), and then incubated at 30 °C for 25 min in 30 μl of kinase reaction mixture containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 1.5 μg of either bacterial expressed GST-IκBα(1–54) or GST-ABIN-2 full-length and mutant forms as substrate. The reaction was stopped by addition of an equal volume of Laemmli buffer and heat denaturation for 5 min at 90 °C. Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, stained with Ponceau S, subjected to autoradiography to visualize phosphorylated GST fusion proteins, and finally analyzed by immunoblotting for normalization on amount of immunoprecipitated IKKs. Cells were lysed for 20 min on ice in ubiquitination assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 μm MgCl2, 0.1% SDS, supplemented with 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 50 μm MG132, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium salt, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 100 μm Na3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 × Complete protease inhibitor mixture), after which the SDS concentration was adjusted to 1%, and whole cell extracts boiled for 10 min, diluted 10-fold with ubiquitination assay buffer without SDS, and subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Whole cells extracts prepared in ubiquitination assay buffer as described above were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 1 unit of calf intestinal phosphatase (New England Biolabs) either untreated or heat-inactivated for 10 min at 95 °C and analyzed by immunoblotting. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were determined using the Dual Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Experiments were conducted three times in triplicate. Total RNA extraction and RT were performed as described previously (45Jacque E. Tchenio T. Piton G. Romeo P.H. Baud V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 14635-14640Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Real-time PCR analysis was carried out with LightCycler FastStart DNA Master plus SYBR Green I on a Light Cycler 1.5 (Roche Applied Science). All values were normalized to the level of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) mRNA. Primer sequences are available upon request. Because IKKα plays pivotal and complex roles in the regulation of NF-κB activation, we undertook to identify new IKKα-interacting partners that could participate in the activation of NF-κB transcriptional activity. We applied a biochemical approach based on specific biotinylation in vivo using IKKα as a bait (see “Materials and Methods”), taking advantage of the very high affinity of avidin/streptavidin for biotinylated templates and efficient single-step purification and identified ABIN-2 as a new IKKα-interacting partner candidate. To examine further the significance of this ABIN-2-IKKα interaction, we first examined the subcellular localization of ABIN-2 when coexpressed with IKKα/β in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, when expressed alone, ABIN-2 formed punctate structures of various sizes in the cytoplasm. However, when coexpressed with IKKα or IKKβ, ABIN-2 relocalizes uniformly all over the cytoplasm, indicating that IKKα/β have an effect on the subcellular localization of ABIN-2. We next performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments using whole cell extracts from HEK293 cells cotransfected with E tag-ABIN-2 along with either FLAG-IKKα or FLAG-IKKβ. As shown in Fig. 1B, reciprocal experiments with anti-FLAG- and anti-E tag specific antibodies showed that ABIN-2 coimmunoprecipitates with both IKKα and IKKβ at similar levels. Finally, we confirmed the association between ABIN-2 and IKKα/β on endogenous proteins in HEK293 and HeLa cells (Fig. 1C). In the course of our experiments, we noted that when expressed alone in HEK293 cells, ABIN-2 protein was hardly detectable (Fig. 1B), although the total mRNA level of ABIN-2 mRNA presented a 500-fold increase over basal level of untransfected cells (Fig. 2B). Remarkably, ABIN-2 protein expression is also extremely low in wild-type MEFs stably transduced with a lentivirus expressing E tag-ABIN-2 (Fig. 2A, left, lane 1). These observations suggest that ABIN-2 might be constitutively targeted for degradation. Treatment of E tag-ABIN-2 expressing MEFs (Fig. 2A, left), as well as HEK293 cells (Fig. 2A, right), with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 led to a strong increase in ABIN-2 protein levels, indicating that ABIN-2 is constitutively degraded in a proteasome-dependent manner. Coexpression of IKKα/β with ABIN-2 in HEK293 cells resulted in a strong increase of ABIN-2 protein expression levels in an IKK kinase activity-dependent manner (Fig. 2C), whereas it had only a slight effect on ABIN-2 mRNA level (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these observations led us to speculate that IKKα/β might induce a reduction in the extent of conjugation of ABIN-2 to the Lys-48-linked polyubiquitin chains which provide a tag for recognition by the 26 S proteasome (46Finley D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 477-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we first examined whether ABIN-2 can be ubiquitinated via a Lys-48 linkage by cotransfection of HEK293 cells of E tag-ABIN-2 with an HA-tagged ubiquitin Lys-48 mutant containing only one lysine at position 48 (Lys-48-Ub). After immunoprecipitation of ABIN-2 (E tag antibody), Lys-48-linked polyubiquitination was analyzed by immunoblotting with an HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 2D, left, ABIN-2 is efficiently ubiquitinated with ubiquitin conjugated through Lys-48. Most importantly, coexpression of either HA-IKKα or HA-IKKβ led to a marked reduction in Lys-48-linked ubiquitination of ABIN-2. Significantly, coexpression of IKKα/β with wild-type ubiquitin also decreased ABIN-2 polyubiquitination (Fig. 2D, center), whereas it does not affect Lys-63-linked ubiquitination (Fig. 2D, right). Together, these results indicate that ABIN-2 is constitutively degraded by the proteasome and that IKKα/β can increase ABIN-2 stability, possibly via the induction of deubiquitination of Lys-48-linked polyubiquitin chains of ABIN-2. Given the ability of ABIN-2 to interact with and to be stabilized by IKKα and IKKβ, we wanted to see whether ABIN-2 could affect IKKα/β-mediated NF-κB activation. To our surprise, the expression of ABIN-2 led to a strong increase in IKKα-mediated NF-κB DNA binding activity in an ABIN-2 dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). In contrast, although the basal level of NF-κB DNA binding complexes was slightly higher when IKKβ was expressed alone compared with that seen with IKKα alone (lane 3 versus lane 8), ABIN-2 expression had little effect on IKKβ-mediated NF-κB DNA binding activity (Fig. 3A). We next examined the subunit composition of the NF-κB DNA-binding complexes. Supershift analysis of nuclear extracts from HEK293 cells transfected with HA-IKKα and E tag-ABIN-2 (extracts from Fig. 3A, lane 7) revealed that κB-binding complexes were mainly composed of RelA-p50 and cRel-p50 dimers (Fig. 3B). Not surprisingly, expression of ABIN-2 had no effect on catalytically inactive K44M IKKα and IKKβ mutants (KD) (Fig. 3C). Most importantly, coexpression of IKKα with ABIN-1, another ABIN family member (41Verstrepen L. Carpentier I. Verhelst K. Beyaert R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2009; 78: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), had no effect on the overall NF-κB DNA binding activity, indicating that ABIN-2 exerts specific function in enhancing IKKα-mediated NF-κB activation (Fig. 3D). To address whether ABIN-2-activating function could also be seen on IKKα-dependent NF-κB transcriptional activity, we compared the ability of ABIN-2 to potentiate IKKα and IKKβ activation of an NF-κB-dependent reporter gene in transiently transfected HEK293 cells. Whereas IKKα and IKKβ alone led to similar activation of the NF-κB reporter, overexpression of ABIN-2 greatly enhanced IKKα-induced NF-κB activation in a dose-dependent manner but had little or no effect on IKKβ-mediated activation (Fig. 3E).FIGURE 3ABIN-2 enhances IKKα-mediated NF-κB activation. A, ABIN-2 enhances IKKα- but not IKKβ-mediated NF-κB DNA binding activity. Nuclear extracts from HEK293 cells transfected with either HA-IKKα or HA-IKKβ alone, or along with increasing amounts of E tag-ABIN-2 were analyzed by EMSA using a 32P-labeled HIV-LTR tandem κB oligonucleotide as a probe (upper panel). Protein expression levels were analyzed by immunoblotting for the indicated proteins (lower panels). Arrows indicate various migrating forms of ABIN-2. B, for supershift analysis, nuclear extracts from HEK293 cells cotransfected with HA-IKKα and E tag-ABIN-2 (conditions of panel A, lane 7) were incubated with the indicated antibodies before incubation with the labeled probe. Complex I, RelA/p50; complex II, cRel/p50. C, IKKα kinase activity is required for the ABIN-2-dependent IKKα-mediated NF-κB DNA binding activity. Nuclear extracts from HEK293 cells transfected with E tag-ABIN-2 along with either WT IKKα/β or KD mutants were analyzed for NF-κB activity by EMSA. Protein expression levels were analyzed by immunoblotting for the indicated proteins. D, ABIN-2 but not ABIN-1 synergizes with IKKα to induce NF-κB DNA binding activity. Nuclear extracts from HEK293 cells transfected with either E tag-ABIN-1 or E tag-ABIN-2 alone or with either wild-type or KD mutant of HA-IKKα were analyzed for NF-κB activity by EMSA. Protein expression levels were analyzed by immunoblotting for the indicated proteins. E, ABIN-2 enhances IKKα-mediated NF-κB transcriptional activity. HEK293 cells were transfected with 3×NF-κB-luciferase reporter along with the indicated expression plasmids, and luciferase activity was determined. F, ABIN-2 increases IKKα activity in vitro. Whole cell extracts from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with HA-IKKα alone or with E tag-ABIN-2 were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA, and kinase assays were performed using either GST alone or GST-IκBα(1–54) as substrates. Immunoprecipitated HA-IKKα protein was detected by immunoblotting with anti-HA. Ponceau S staining ensures equal amounts of substrates. Arrows indicate phosphorylated substrate and IKKα autophosphorylation. G, ABIN-2 increases IKKα activity in vivo. Whole cell extracts from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with equivalent amounts of the indicated expression plasmids were analyzed by immunoblotting for the indicated proteins. H, ABIN-2 controls NF-κB DNA binding activity upon prolonged stimulation by TNFα in primary MEFs. Nuclear extracts from WT and ABIN-2-deficient MEFs treated with TNFα for the indicated periods of time were analyzed for NF-κB activity by EMSA. I, ABIN-2 controls IKKα activity upon prolonged stimulation by TNFα in primary MEFs. Upper, whole cell extracts from WT and ABIN-2-deficient MEFs treated with TNFα for the indicated periods of time were analyzed for IKKα kinase activity and expression as described above.

In the cortical collecting duct of the kidney, sgk1 regulates sodium transport by stimulating the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). Control of subcellular localization of sgk1 may be an important mechanism for modulating specificity of sgk1 function; however, which subcellular locations are required for sgk1-regulated ENaC activity in collecting duct cells has yet to be established. Using cell surface biotinylation studies, we detected endogenous sgk1 at the apical cell membrane of aldosterone-stimulated mpkCCDc14 collecting duct cells. The association of sgk1 with the cell membrane was enhanced when ENaC was co-transfected with sgk1 in kidney cells, suggesting that ENaC brings sgk1 to the cell surface. Furthermore, association of endogenous sgk1 with the apical cell membrane of mpkCCDc14 cells could be modulated by treatments that increase or decrease ENaC expression at the apical membrane; forskolin increased the association of sgk1 with the apical surface, whereas methyl-β-cyclodextrin decreased the association of sgk1 with the apical surface. Single channel recordings of excised inside-out patches from the apical membrane of aldosterone-stimulated A6 collecting duct cells revealed that the open probability of ENaC was sensitive to the sgk1 inhibitor GSK650394, indicating that endogenous sgk1 is functionally active at the apical cell membrane. We propose that the association of sgk1 with the apical cell membrane, where it interacts with ENaC, is a novel means by which sgk1 specifically enhances ENaC activity in aldosterone-stimulated collecting duct cells.

Serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (sgk1) is a key regulatory kinase that controls a wide range of biological processes, including cell proliferation, cell survival, and sodium (Na+) homeostasis. Moreover, sgk1 is in a position to integrate a diverse set of environmental cues and enable cells to respond appropriately within a specific physiological context. For example, in kidney collecting duct cells, the mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone rapidly (within 15–30 min) induces sgk1 gene transcription and increases sgk1 protein levels (1Chen S.Y.

Growth factors activate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway, which initiates a phosphorylation cascade that stimulates sgk1 catalytic activity (3Park J. Leong M.L. Buse P. Maiyar A.C.

One of the best characterized downstream targets of sgk1 in collecting duct cells is the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC), 2The abbreviations used are: ENaCepithelial sodium channelMβCDmethyl-β-cyclodextrinPIP2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. an ion channel that is the rate-limiting step for Na+ absorption in the kidney collecting duct and plays a critical role in regulating Na+ balance and blood pressure. One important mechanism by which sgk1 increases ENaC activity involves modulating Nedd4-2 (5Debonneville C. Flores S.Y. Kamynina E. Plant P.J. Tauxe C. Thomas M.A. Münster C. Chraïbi A. Pratt J.H.

A less well recognized mechanism underlying the stimulatory effect of sgk1 on ENaC activity involves direct activation of ENaC at the plasma membrane. In outside-out membrane patches from Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing ENaC, recombinant sgk1 stimulates ENaC activity; introduction of an S621A mutation within the sgk1 consensus phosphorylation motif of the COOH-terminal tail of α-ENaC abolishes this stimulatory effect (10Diakov A. Korbmacher C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38134-38142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Depletion of cholesterol from the cell membrane through methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) treatment of ENaC-expressing oocytes also abolishes sgk1 stimulation of ENaC, suggesting that a cholesterol-rich lipid microenvironment surrounding ENaC helps to recruit or organize regulatory proteins for functional interactions at the plasma membrane (11Krueger B. Haerteis S. Yang L. Hartner A. Rauh R. Korbmacher C. Diakov A. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2009; 24: 605-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For sgk1 to directly stimulate ENaC, the kinase presumably would localize near the ion channel at the plasma membrane, a finding that has yet to be documented. Indeed, one likely determinant for selectivity of sgk1 action involves its subcellular localization, which could dictate how sgk1 can activate specific substrates. In this regard, sgk1 has been found in the endoplasmic reticulum (12Arteaga M.F. Wang L. Ravid T. Hochstrasser M. Canessa C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, which subcellular locations are required for sgk1-regulated ENaC activity in collecting duct cells has yet to be established. This has been a major obstacle for understanding how sgk1 can respond appropriately to environmental cues to specifically stimulate ENaC activity in kidney cells. In this study, we hypothesized that sgk1, an intracellular protein kinase, associates with the apical cell membrane through protein-protein interactions with ENaC. We show in mpkCCDc14 cells, a well characterized model system for the principal cells of the cortical collecting duct of mammalian kidney (23Bens M. Vallet V. Cluzeaud F. Pascual-Letallec L. Kahn A. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Rossier B.C. Vandewalle A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 923-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), that a fraction of aldosterone-inducible sgk1 associates with the apical membrane. We also demonstrate that sgk1 interacts with ENaC in kidney cells and that this interaction enhances sgk1 association with the cell membrane. In aldosterone-stimulated mpkCCDc14 cells, endogenous sgk1 expression in the apical surface fraction can be modulated by treatments that increase or decrease ENaC expression at the apical membrane. Finally, in single channel recordings of excised inside-out patches from the apical membrane of aldosterone-stimulated A6 collecting duct cells, we show that inhibition of endogenous sgk1 activity in these patches decreases ENaC activity by inhibiting ENaC open probability (Po). We conclude that the apical membrane of collecting duct cells is an important site for sgk1-mediated regulation of ENaC. Immortalized mouse kidney cortical collecting duct (mpkCCDc14) cells, kindly provided by Dr. Alain Vandewalle, and human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells were maintained as described previously (7Bhalla V. Daidié D. Li H. Pao A.C. LaGrange L.P. Wang J. Vandewalle A. Stockand J.D. Staub O. Pearce D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 3073-3084Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 24Pao A.C.

Renal Physiol. 2007; 292: F1741-F1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). mpkCCDc14 cells were subcultured onto 24-mm permeable supports (0.4 μm pore size, Costar, Cambridge, MA) and grown in defined medium until transepithelial resistance (Rte) reached values between 800 and 1200 Ω·cm2, as measured with an EVOM “chopstick” voltmeter (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). Cells were then switched to supplement and serum-free media for 48 h before treatment with aldosterone (1 μm) for varying periods to induce endogenous sgk1 expression. Polarized mpkCCDc14 cells were treated with vehicle control or aldosterone, scraped from permeable supports into lysis buffer ((in mm): 10 HEPES, 10 KCl, 0.1 EDTA, 1 DTT, 0.4% Nonidet P-40), and centrifuged at 10,000 × g. The pellets were resuspended in nuclear extraction buffer ((in mm): 20 HEPES, 400 NaCl, 1 EDTA and 1 DTT), centrifuged at 24,000 × g, and isolated as nuclear fractions. Supernatant fractions from the 10,000 × g spin were further spun at 100,000 × g for 1 h to separate the membrane fraction (pellet) that was then resuspended in lysis buffer, although the cytosolic fraction remained in the supernatant. Surface biotinylation studies were performed on polarized mpkCCDc14 cells or on transfected HEK293T cells. Confluent cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS-CM ((in mm): PBS with 1 CaCl2 and 1 MgCl2, pH 7.4). The apical membrane was biotinylated with 1 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin (ThermoFisher Scientific, Rockford, IL) in PBS-CM on ice; the basolateral side of cell monolayers remained in serum-containing media. After quenching free biotin on the apical side with 100 mm glycine in PBS-CM, both sides of cell monolayers were washed with ice cold PBS-CM, and cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer ((in mm): 0.4% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 63 EDTA, 50 Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing protease inhibitors (ThermoFisher Scientific)). Biotinylated proteins were isolated by incubating cell lysates with immobilized NeutrAvidin-coated beads (ThermoFisher Scientific) overnight at 4 °C. Precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and biotinylated sgk1 was probed by immunoblotting either with anti-sgk1 antibody (1:1000, Sigma) for detection of endogenous sgk1 or with anti-FLAG antibody (1:25,000, Sigma) for detection of heterologously expressed sgk1. Immunoblots were also probed with a pan-cadherin antibody (1:5000, Sigma) to confirm that equal amounts of cell surface-associated proteins were present in the NeutrAvidin pulldowns. Blots were also probed with an antibody against α-tubulin (1:5000, Sigma) or histone (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) to confirm that intracellular proteins were not generally being pulled down. To estimate the portion of sgk1 that associates with the apical surface fraction of aldosterone-stimulated mpkCCDc14 cells, different amounts of biotinylated protein were first precipitated overnight with NeutrAvidin-coated beads. On the 2nd day, the beads were recovered, and the supernatants were re-precipitated overnight with a new batch of NeutrAvidin-coated beads. This second precipitation step was done to confirm that cell surface-associated sgk1 was completely recovered from the first precipitation step. Precipitated proteins from both days were run on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an anti-sgk1 antibody (supplemental Fig. S1). The percentage of sgk1 associated with the apical surface fraction was estimated by using densitometry analysis to compare the intensities of immunoreactive sgk1 bands in the NeutrAvidin pulldown (from whole cell lysates containing 0.5 mg of input protein) to the intensities of sgk1 bands in whole cell lysates containing 0.5 mg of input protein. To determine whether sgk1 co-precipitates with cell surface proteins, lysates from biotinylated mpkCCDc14 cells were either left untreated or boiled at 95 °C for 5 min in 2% SDS to disrupt association of sgk1 with integral membrane proteins. All cell lysates were then re-diluted with lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, and equal amounts of biotinylated proteins were isolated with NeutrAvidin-coated beads. To determine whether increasing or decreasing ENaC at the apical membrane affects association of sgk1 with the apical cell surface fraction, forskolin (10 μm) or MβCD (10–20 mm, Sigma) was added to the basal or apical side of polarized, aldosterone-stimulated mpkCCDc14 cells, respectively, for various times, prior to conducting surface biotinylation assays. Aldosterone-stimulated mpkCCDc14 cells grown on permeable supports were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, rinsed, and incubated in blocking solution (PBS, 3% BSA, 10% donkey serum) for 1 h. Cells were then incubated with anti-sgk1 antibody (1:100, Sigma) or normal rabbit IgG (at a concentration of IgG equivalent to the anti-sgk1 antibody concentration) at 4 °C overnight. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated in AlexaFluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:800, Invitrogen). Following PBS washes, cells were incubated with Texas Red-labeled phalloidin (1:50, Invitrogen). After further PBS washes, cells were mounted in Vectashield containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Cells were imaged on a Carl Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope using LSM Image Browser software (Carl Zeiss International, Thornwood, NJ). Adult 129 mice were maintained on a regular chow diet. All procedures were in accordance with the Committees on Animal Research at Stanford University and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium. Kidneys were fixed with 2.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS, removed, and post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 4 h. After washing with PBS at 4 °C overnight, the tissues were then frozen in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound, and 4-μm sections were cut. Frozen kidney sections were washed with PBS and treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5–10 min. Sections were incubated with blocking solution (PBS, 3% BSA, 10% donkey serum) for 40 min and then incubated with rabbit anti-sgk1 antibody (1:100, Sigma) and goat anti-aquaporin-2 (1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies at 4 °C overnight. After washing with PBS, sections were incubated with AlexaFluor 546-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:800, Invitrogen) and AlexaFluor 633-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (1:800, Invitrogen). Sections were washed with PBS, mounted, and then imaged as above. HEK293T cells were cultured on 10-cm dishes in DMEM containing 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with plasmid DNA encoding mouse sgk1-FLAG (2 μg) and differentially COOH-terminal epitope-tagged mouse ENaC subunits (α-HA, β-V5, and γ-myc, 1 μg each) or expression vector control (pMO, 3 μg). In some experiments, mouse sgk1-HA was transfected instead of sgk1-FLAG. The subcloning of mouse sgk1 into pMO expression vectors has been described previously (24Pao A.C. McCormick J.A. Li H. Siu J.

In some experiments, cells were also treated with MG132 (10 μm, Sigma) for 2 h to limit proteasomal degradation of sgk1 prior to biotinylation and lysis of cells. Transfected HEK293Tcells were harvested in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitation was performed using antibodies against sgk1 (anti-FLAG). Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies against α-ENaC (anti-HA, 1:10,000) or sgk1 (anti-FLAG, 1:25,000). Polarized mpkCCDc14 cell monolayers were mounted between the Lucite half-chambers of the Ussing chamber apparatus (Physiological Instruments, San Diego) for electrophysiological experiments, as described previously (25Rajagopal M. Pao A.C. Hypertension. 2010; 55: 1123-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 26Rajagopal, M., Kathpalia, P. P., Thomas, S. V., Pao, A. C. (2011) Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol., in press.Google Scholar). To determine sgk1-inhibitable short circuit current (Isc), cells were treated with vehicle control or aldosterone (1 μm); base-line Isc was allowed to stabilize, and then GSK650394 (6 μm, Tocris, Ellisville, MO), an inhibitor of sgk1, was added to both sides of the cell monolayers. Twenty minutes after the addition of GSK650394, amiloride (10 μm, Sigma), an inhibitor of ENaC, was added to the apical side of cell monolayers to evaluate residual ENaC-mediated Isc (supplemental Fig. S2). A6 cells were maintained in tissue culture flasks at 27 °C in a humidified incubator with 4% CO2 in culture medium consisting of three parts F-12 and seven parts Leibovitz's medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1.5 μm aldosterone. Cells were plated onto collagen-coated plastic rings that were mounted onto a recording chamber of an inverted microscope for single channel measurements. In the cell-attached configuration, the pipette and bath solutions contained the following (in mm): 96 NaCl, 3.4 KCl, 0.8 CaCl2, 0.8 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4 (titrated with 10 n NaOH). Inside-out patches were obtained from cell-attached patches following exchange of the apical bath solution into high K+ solution ((in mm): 3 NaCl, 85.4 KCl, 4 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 5 EGTA, pH 7.4 (titrated with 10 n NaOH)). To sustain ENaC activity in excised patches, the high K+ solution was supplemented with 30 μm PIP2 and 100 μm GTP, as described previously (27Yue G. Malik B. Yue G. Eaton D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11965-11969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Statistical analyses for comparisons between different treatment groups of mpkCCDc14 and A6 cells were performed using paired or unpaired two-tailed Student's t tests. Differences were considered to be significant at p values <0.05. Sigma Plot (Systat Software) was used to perform nonlinear regression and sigmoidal fitting of the GSK650394 dose response in A6 cells. We first examined the subcellular localization of endogenous sgk1 in a mammalian kidney collecting duct model system. We treated polarized mpkCCDc14 cells with aldosterone (1 μm) and isolated nuclear, cytosolic, and membrane fractions by centrifugation at peak levels of sgk1 expression (3 h of aldosterone treatment (28Flores S.Y. Loffing-Cueni D. Kamynina E. Daidié D. Gerbex C. Chabanel S. Dudler J. Loffing J. Staub O. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 2279-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar)). Recent work has identified the existence of multiple sgk1 isoforms. In addition to canonical sgk1, which is responsive to aldosterone stimulation and regulates ENaC activity (1Chen S.Y. Bhargava A. Mastroberardino L. Meijer O.C. Wang J. Buse P. Firestone G.L. Verrey F. Pearce D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 2514-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 2Náray-Fejes-Tóth A.

Alvarez de la Rosa D. Alvarez J.A. Canessa C.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2072-2080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Arteaga M.F. Coric T. Straub C. Canessa C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Renal Physiol. 2008; 295: F1440-F1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Some of these variants are also capable of stimulating ENaC (31Raikwar N.S. Snyder P.M. Thomas C.P. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2008; 295: F1440-F1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), although the physiological relevance of these variants is not clear. We focused on protein expression of canonical sgk1, which is distinguished by being the only isoform with aldosterone-inducible expression. Western blotting with a previously characterized anti-sgk1 antibody (28Flores S.Y. Loffing-Cueni D. Kamynina E. Daidié D. Gerbex C. Chabanel S. Dudler J. Loffing J. Staub O. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 2279-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) demonstrated that aldosterone-inducible sgk1 appeared as two immunoreactive bands clustering around 49 kDa and localized primarily to cytosolic and membrane fractions of mpkCCDc14 cells (Fig. 1). These two bands are likely different phosphorylation variants of canonical sgk1, which have been previously identified (28Flores S.Y. Loffing-Cueni D. Kamynina E. Daidié D. Gerbex C. Chabanel S. Dudler J. Loffing J. Staub O. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 2279-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). There were two additional immunoreactive bands clustering at 42–45 kDa, which were enriched in nuclear and membrane fractions. These smaller immunoreactive bands could represent shorter sgk1 variants, which do not stimulate ENaC activity and have been detected in the nucleus of transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells (29Arteaga M.F. Alvarez de la Rosa D. Alvarez J.A. Canessa C.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 2072-2080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given that a portion of sgk1 localized to the membrane fraction of mpkCCDc14 cells, we next examined whether sgk1 associates with the apical plasma membrane, where it might regulate ENaC. We treated polarized mpkCCDc14 cells with aldosterone (1 μm) for various times and assessed sgk1 expression in the apical surface fraction. Although sgk1 expression in whole cell lysates became detectable within 30 min of aldosterone induction and quickly reached saturation by 45 min, expression of sgk1 at the apical membrane gradually rose over the course of 24 h of aldosterone treatment (Fig. 2). We estimated that 5–7% of aldosterone-inducible sgk1 associated with the apical cell surface fraction at peak levels of sgk1 expression (supplemental Fig. S1). We next used immunofluorescence confocal microscopy to investigate the subcellular localization of endogenous sgk1 in mpkCCDc14 cells. Polarized cells treated with vehicle or aldosterone (1 μm) for 3 h were fixed and stained with an anti-sgk1 antibody. Aldosterone-inducible sgk1 immunoreactivity was detectable in the cytosol and plasma membrane (Fig. 3A); in x-y images taken near the apical pole of cell sheets, aldosterone-inducible sgk1 closely associated with the plasma membrane and co-localized with phalloidin staining of actin filaments (Fig. 3B). We also examined the distribution of sgk1 protein in mouse kidneys. We labeled kidney sections with antibodies directed against sgk1 and aquaporin-2, an established marker of the principal cells of the cortical collecting duct. sgk1 immunoreactivity primarily localized toward the apical surface in aquaporin-2-positive cells, indicating that a fraction of endogenous sgk1 associates with the apical membrane of mouse kidney collecting duct cells (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4sgk1 localizes to the apical cell membrane of mouse kidney cortical collecting duct.

To confirm that sgk1 associates with the apical membrane through protein-protein interactions, we first biotinylated the apical surface of control and aldosterone-stimulated mpkCCDc14 cells and then lysed cells with control buffer or buffer containing 2% SDS. The lysates containing 2% SDS were boiled at 95 °C to disrupt protein-protein interactions. Western blotting of biotinylated proteins showed that sgk1 associated with the apical surface of mpkCCDc14 cells in the absence of 2% SDS (Fig. 5, 2nd lane), but this association was disrupted when lysates were boiled in 2% SDS prior to incubation with NeutrAvidin-coated beads (Fig. 5, 5th lane). This finding demonstrates that sgk1 associates with the apical membrane through interactions with integral membrane proteins. One previous report has demonstrated that sgk1 physically interacts with the COOH-terminal tails of α- and β-ENaC subunits in a GST pulldown assay (32Wang J. Barbry P. Maiyar A.C. Rozansky D.J. Bhargava A. Leong M. Firestone G.L. Pearce D. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 280: F303-F313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We postulated that ENaC may be one integral membrane protein that can bring sgk1 to the cell membrane. To confirm whether this interaction takes place in kidney cells, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments with HEK293T cell lysates co-expressing HA-labeled α-ENaC, β-ENaC, γ-ENaC, and FLAG-labeled sgk1 and found that α-ENaC"
https://openalex.org/W2000383076,"Although the signal transduction mechanisms of the receptor tyrosine kinase MET are well defined, less is known about its close relative RON. MET initiates intracellular signaling by autophosphorylation on specific cytoplasmic tyrosines that form docking sites for the adaptor proteins Grb2 and Gab1. Grb2 binds directly and is essential for all of the biological activities of MET. Gab1 docks either directly or indirectly via Grb2 and controls only a subset of MET functions. Because MET and RON possess similar adaptor binding sites, it was anticipated that their adaptor interactions would be conserved. Here we show that in contrast to MET, RON relies primarily on Gab1 for signal transmission. Surprisingly, disruption of the Grb2 docking site of RON or Grb2 depletion augments activity, whereas enhancement of Grb2 binding attenuates Gab1 recruitment and signaling.

We have used an insulin-secreting cell line with inducible expression of dominant negative (DN) HNF1α, a transcription factor vital for correct β-cell development and function, to show that HNF1α is required for Xbp1 transcription and maintenance of the normal ER stress response. DN HNF1α expression sensitizes the β-cell to ER stress by directly down-regulating Xbp1 transcription, whereas Atf6 is unaffected. Furthermore, DN HNF1α alters calcium homeostasis, resulting in elevated cytoplasmic calcium and increased store-operated calcium entry, whereas mitochondrial calcium uptake is normal. Loss of function of XBP1 is toxic to the β-cell and decreases production of the ER chaperone BiP, even in the absence of ER stress. DN HNF1α-induced sensitivity to cyclopiazonic acid can be partially rescued with the chemical chaperone tauroursodeoxycholate. Rat insulin 2 promoter-DN HNF1α mouse islets express lower levels of BiP mRNA, synthesize less insulin, and are sensitized to ER stress relative to matched control mouse islets, suggesting that this mechanism is also operating in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1975636865,"Studies implicate an important role for the mixed lineage leukemia (Mll) gene in hematopoiesis, mainly through maintaining Hox gene expression. However, the mechanisms underlying Mll-mediated hematopoiesis during embryogenesis remain largely unclear. Here, we investigate the role of mll during zebrafish embryogenesis, particularly hematopoiesis. Mll depletion caused severe defects in hematopoiesis as indicated by a lack of blood flow and mature blood cells as well as a significant reduction in expression of hematopoietic progenitor and mature blood cell markers. Furthermore, mll depletion prevented the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors. In addition, we identified the N-terminal mini-peptide of Mll that acted as a dominant negative form to disrupt normal function of mll during embryogenesis. As expected, mll knockdown altered the expression of a subset of Hox genes. However, overexpression of these down-regulated Hox genes only partially rescued the blood deficiency, suggesting that mll may target additional genes to regulate hematopoiesis. In the mll morphants, microarray analysis revealed a dramatic up-regulation of gadd45αa. Multiple assays indicate that mll inhibited gadd45αa expression and that overexpression of gadd45αa mRNA led to a phenotype similar to the one seen in the mll morphants. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that zebrafish mll plays essential roles in hematopoiesis and that gadd45αa may serve as a potential downstream target for mediating the function of mll in hematopoiesis."
https://openalex.org/W2037570228,"Host survival depends on an effective immune system and pathogen survival on the effectiveness of immune evasion mechanisms. Staphylococcus aureus utilizes a number of molecules to modulate host immunity, including the SSL family of which SSL7 binds IgA and inhibits Fcα receptor I (FcαRI)-mediated function. Other Gram-positive bacterial pathogens produce IgA binding proteins, which, similar to SSL7, also bind the Fc at the CH2/CH3 interface (the junction between constant domains 2 and 3 of the heavy chain). The opposing activities of the host FcαRI-IgA receptor ligand pair and the pathogen decoy proteins select for host and pathogen variants, which exert stronger protection or evasion, respectively. Curiously, mouse but not rat IgA contains a putative N-linked glycosylation site in the center of this host receptor and pathogen-binding site. Here, we demonstrate that this site is glycosylated and that the effect of amino acid changes and glycosylation of the CH2/CH3 interface inhibits interaction with the pathogen IgA binding protein SSL7, while maintaining binding of pIgR, essential to the biosynthesis and transport of SIgA."
https://openalex.org/W1988583908,"The peptidoglycan recognition protein PGRP-S is an innate immunity molecule that specifically interacts with microbial peptidoglycans and other pathogen-associated molecular patterns.

The binding studies carried out using surface plasmon resonance indicated that CPGRP-S binds to MDP with a dissociation constant of 10−7 m, whereas the binding affinities for GlcNAc and β-maltose separately are in the range of 10−4 m to 10−5 m, whereas the dissociation constant for the mixture of GlcNAc and maltose was estimated to be 10−6 m. The data from bacterial suspension culture experiments showed a significant inhibition of the growth of Staphylococcus aureus cells when CPGRP-S was added to culture medium. The ELISA experiment showed that the amount of MDP-induced production of TNF-α and IL-6 decreased considerably after the introduction of CPGRP-S. The crystal structure determinations of (i) a binary complex with MDP and (ii) a ternary complex with GlcNAc and β-maltose revealed that MDP, GlcNAc, and β-maltose bound to CPGRP-S in the ligand binding cleft, which is situated at the interface of molecules C and D of the homotetramer formed by four protein molecules A, B, C, and D.

These proteins specifically recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as peptidoglycan (PGN), LPS, lipoteichoic acid (LTA), mycolic acid, and etc. It is well known that PGN is present on the cell walls of both Gram-negative and -positive bacteria. PGN is a polymer of alternating GlcNAc and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) in a β(1→4) linkage, cross-linked by short peptide stems composed of alternating l- and d-amino acids. The glycan moiety of PGN is conserved among almost all of the bacteria, but the peptide part displays a considerable diversity (1Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). According to the amino acid residue at number three position of the peptide stem, PGNs are divided into two major categories, (i) lysine type (Lys-type) and (ii) meso-diaminopimelic acid type. The peptidoglycans or their fragments are recognized by the host through innate immunity proteins, particularly PGRPs (2Dziarski R. Gupta D. J. Endotoxin.

There are four types of mammalian PGRPs designated as short PGRP (PGRP-S), PGRP-L, PGRP-Iα, and PGRP-Iβ representing short (molecular mass, 20–25 kDa), long (molecular mass, up to 90 kDa), and intermediate (molecular mass, 40–45 kDa), respectively. PGRP-S contains ∼200 amino acid residues and represents a single PGRP domain, wheraes PGRP-L and PGRP-I also contain a similar C-terminal PGRP domain. PGRP-S shows direct bacterial recognition. The potency of its recognition determines its strength in controlling bacterial infections. Initially, PGRP-S was detected in bone marrow (6Liu C. Xu Z. Gupta D. Dziarski R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34686-34694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), whereas subsequently, it was also observed as a soluble protein in the granules of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (9Lu X. Wang M. Qi J. Wang H. Li X. Gupta D. Dziarski R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5895-5907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This observation implied that PGRP-S might have a role as an antibacterial agent (6Liu C. Xu Z. Gupta D. Dziarski R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34686-34694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Recently, its presence has also been shown in milk of certain species of mammals (10Kappeler S.R. Heuberger C. Farah Z. Puhan Z. J. Dairy Sci. 2004; 87: 2660-2668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and in the intestinal M cells (11Lo D. Tynan W. Dickerson J.

As far as mammary gland secretions are concerned, so far, PGRP-S has been detected in the mammary secretions of porcine and camel only (10Kappeler S.R. Heuberger C. Farah Z. Puhan Z. J. Dairy Sci. 2004; 87: 2660-2668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As far as structural studies are concerned, the crystal structures of truncated human PGRP-S (HPGRP-S) (amino acid residues from 9 to 191) and a full-length (amino acid residues from 1 to 171) camel PGRP-S (CPGRP-S) have been reported (12Guan R. Wang Q. Sundberg E.J. Mariuzza R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 683-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 13Sharma P. Singh N. Sinha M. Sharma S. Perbandt M. Betzel C. Kaur P. Srinivasan A. Singh T.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 378: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) showing truncated HPGRP-S as a monomer (although it is expected to be covalently linked dimer), whereas CPGRP-S was found to be a stable homotetramer (13Sharma P. Singh N. Sinha M. Sharma S. Perbandt M. Betzel C. Kaur P. Srinivasan A. Singh T.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 378: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The ligand-binding site in HPGRP-S is located on the surface of the monomeric protein, whereas that in CPGRP-S is observed deep inside tetramer that is connected through a channel to the surface of the protein. To establish the wide range of specificities of the binding site in tetrameric CPGRP-S for various PAMPs, we have determined two crystal structures of CPGRP-S complexed with (i) a single compound muramyl dipeptide (MDP), which is a moiety of PGN and (ii) two compounds GlcNAc and β-maltose. Previously, it has been shown that the PAMP-binding site in CPGRP-S was capable of recognizing both Gram-negative and -positive bacteria through its binding to LPS and LTA with equally high affinities (14Sharma P. Dube D. Singh A. Mishra B. Singh N. Sinha M. Dey S. Kaur P. Mitra D.K. Sharma S. Singh T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 16208-16217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). From the structure analysis of native CPGRP-S and its complexes with LPS and LTA, it was shown that multiple binding subsites were available for the recognition of PAMPs in the ligand binding site in the CPGRP-S tetramer. Here, we provide further structural evidence of a wide range binding capability of the PAMP-binding site in CPGRP-S. CPGRP-S was isolated from the fresh samples of camel milk, which were obtained from the National Research Center on Camels (Bikaner, India), and purified it to homogeneity using the procedure described earlier (13Sharma P. Singh N. Sinha M. Sharma S. Perbandt M. Betzel C. Kaur P. Srinivasan A. Singh T.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 378: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The purity of protein was established using SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF. The inhibition of bacterial growth was assessed by suspension assay in the absence and presence of PGN. The strains of Staphylococcus aureus were grown to mid-log phase in 1× TSB (3% w/v; 0.5% NaCl) at 37 °C. The 10-μl aliquots of the cells were added to 2 ml TSB. The purified CPGRP-S was added to a final concentration of 25 μg/ml either alone or supplemented with 100 μg/ml PGN or LPS (Sigma Aldrich). The tubes were shaken at 300 rpm for 5 h. The bacterial growth was monitored by measuring the OD at 600 nm at the intervals of one hour. To minimize the effect of bacterial aggregation on OD, the cell suspensions were stirred for 1 min before each measurement. All of the surface plasmon resonance measurements were carried out using Biacore-2000 (Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden) at 25 °C in which a biosensor-based system has been used for real-time specific interaction analysis. The sensor chip CM-5 (surface of which was covered with thin layer of gold coated with carboxymethyl dextran residues for covalent protein immobilization), surfactant P20, the amine coupling kit containing N-hydroxysuccinimide, N-ethyl-N′-3-(diethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, and ethanolamine hydrochloride (Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden) were used in the experiment. The immobilization of CPGRP-S was performed at a flow rate of 10 μl/min using an amine-coupling kit. The dextran on the chip was equilibrated with running buffer and carboxymethylated matrix was activated with an N-ethyl-N′-3-(diethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide mixture and 210 μl of PGRP (4.2 μg/ml) in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 3.5), the unreacted groups were blocked by injecting ethanolamine (pH 8.5). The surface plasmon resonance signal for immobilized CPGRP-S reached 4357.8 resonance units. Three concentrations of analytes (4.5 μm, 2.25 μm, and 0.9 μm) were passed over immobilized PGRP at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The regeneration of the protein surface from bound analytes was done by using 1 mm NaOH. The association (Kon) and dissociation (Koff) rate constants for the analytes bindings to CPGRP-S were calculated and the values of dissociation constants (Kd) were determined by the mass action relation Kd = Koff/Kon using BIA evaluation software (version 3.0) provided by the manufacturer. The human peripheral blood was taken from a healthy donor and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from heparinized blood by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation and suspended in complete RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS at optimum culture conditions of 5% CO2, at 37 °C for 6 h. Cells were stimulated with medium alone and with 10 μg/ml PGN without and with 10 μg/ml CPGRP-S. The culture supernatants were collected after 6 h of stimulation at optimum culture conditions and assayed for TNF-α and IL-6 concentrations by ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions. The data were expressed as mean values ± S.D. The statistical differences in the results were evaluated by Student's t test. CPGRP-S was crystallized at room temperature using hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The crystals, suitable for diffraction measurements were obtained after 4 weeks. In all of the crystallization setups, 4 μl of protein solution at a concentration of 12 mg/ml was mixed with 4 μl of reservoir solution, which consisted of 10% PEG-3350, 200 mm potassium sodium tartrate in buffer of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The 8-μl drops of protein solution were equilibrated against 2 ml of reservoir solutions. The crystals of native protein were obtained after 3 weeks. These crystals were soaked in the reservoir solutions that contained (i) a mixture of PGN fragment and muramyl dipeptide and (ii) a mixture of GlcNAc and β-maltose. The concentrations of (i) MDP and (ii) GlcNAc and β-maltose were prepared at 12 mg/ml. The soaking was carried out for 24 h. The soaked crystals were flash cooled in liquid nitrogen for 30 s in the cryoprotection solution consisting of 20% glycerol (v/v) in the reservoir solution. Two independent x-ray intensity data sets were collected on the crystals soaked (i) in the solution containing MDP and (ii) in the solution containing the equimolar mixture of GlcNAc and β-maltose using DBT-sponsored x-ray beamline BM14 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). To minimize the radiation damage, the crystals were mounted in nylon loops and kept at 100 K in a liquid nitrogen stream during the measurements. The data were indexed, integrated, scaled, and merged using the HKL-2000 package (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38589) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to orthorhombic space group I222 with unit cell dimensions of (i) a = 87.1, b = 102.0, and c = 161.6 Å and (ii) a = 87.1, b = 100.8, and c = 161.8 Å with four molecules in the asymmetric unit in both structures. The data collection and processing statistics for the two crystals are given in Table 1.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statistics for the structures of the complexes of peptidoglycan recognition protein (CPGRP-S) with MDP, GlcNAc, and maltoseParametersCPGRP-S+MDPCPGRP-S+GlcNAc and maltosePDB code3NW33NG4Space groupI222I222Unit cell dimensionsa = 87.1, b = 102.0, and c = 161.6 Åa = 87.1, b = 100.8, and c = 161.8 ÅNumber of molecules in the asymmetric unit44Resolution range (Å)50–2.585.5–1.7Total number of measured reflections717,1801,562,425Number of unique reflections24,77270,076Rsym (%)aRsym = ΣhklΣi|Ii(hkl) − 〈I(hkl)〉|/ΣhklΣiIi(hkl-).6.5 (25.2)4.7 (48.4)I/σ(I)31.2 (3.4)32.7 (2.4)Overall completeness of data (%)97.9 (98.1)99.1 (99.0)Rcryst (%)bRcryst = Σhkl|Fo(hkl) − Fc(hkl)|/Σhkl|Fo(hkl)|, where Fo and Fc are observed and calculated structure factors, respectively.23.620.2Rfree (%)24.924.4Protein atoms53485348Water oxygen atoms400735Atoms of glycerol66Atoms of tartrate1010Atoms of ligands (MDP and GlcNAc/maltose)3423/15R.m.s.d in bond lengths (Å)0.020.02R.m.s.d in bond angles1.9°1.9°R.m.s.d in torsion angles15.3°15.0°Wilson B-factor52.820.7Mean B-factor for main chain atoms (Å2)48.921.3Mean B-factor for side chain atoms (Å2)51.326.8Mean B-factor for all atoms(Å2)50.224.3Ramachandran ϕ, ψ mapResidues in most favored regions (%)89.488.7Residues in additionally allowed regions (%)10.611.3a Rsym = ΣhklΣi|Ii(hkl) − 〈I(hkl)〉|/ΣhklΣiIi(hkl-).b Rcryst = Σhkl|Fo(hkl) − Fc(hkl)|/Σhkl|Fo(hkl)|, where Fo and Fc are observed and calculated structure factors, respectively. Open table in a new tab Because structures of both the complexes of CPGRP-S with (i) MDP and (ii) GlcNAc and β-maltose were isomorphous to the structure of native CPGRP-S (PDB 3C2X), the model of the native structure was subjected to several rounds of simulated annealing/positional refinement using reflection data from sets (i) (structure 1) and (ii) (structure 2), respectively, with the program CNS (16Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Rice L.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 325-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). These were followed by B-factor refinements. The model buildings were carried out using the program O (17Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) on the Silicon Graphics O2 Work station. As the refinements progressed and the Rcryst factors dropped to <26%, whereas Rfree factors dropped to <29%, the electron density maps (2Fo − Fc) and (Fo − Fc) were calculated in both cases. The characteristic non-protein electron densities were observed at the interface of molecules C and D at >2.5σ cut-off. MDP was modeled into the electron density in structure 1 (see Fig. 1A), whereas molecules GlcNAc and β-maltose were fitted nicely in structure 2 (Fig. 1B). The coordinates of MDP were included in the subsequent cycles of refinement in structure 1, whereas those of GlcNAc and β-maltose were included in structure 2. After further cycles of refinements, electron density maps were calculated intermittently, and manual model buildings were carried out. These electron density maps were also used for determining the positions of 400 water oxygen atoms in structure 1 and 735 water oxygen atoms in structure 2. After additional cycles of refinement with water oxygen atoms, the correctness of water oxygen atoms were examined, and only those water oxygen atoms were retained whose thermal B-factors were <70 Å2 and made hydrogen bonds with protein atoms. The final cycles of refinements using REFMAC (18Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13905) Google Scholar) converged with Rcryst and Rfree values of 0.236 and 0.249 for structure 1 and 0.202 and 0.244 for structure 2. As indicated by calculations using program PROCHECK (19Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), there were no non-glycine residues in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran map (20Ramachandran G.N. Sasisekharan V. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 283-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2768) Google Scholar). The refinement statistics of both structures are summarized in Table 1. The addition of an excess amount of LPS or MDP (100 μg/ml) completely blocked the CPGRP-S (25 μg/ml) mediated growth inhibition of S. aureus cells (Fig. 2). Similar results were also obtained when the mixture of GlcNAc and β-maltose were used (data not shown). In the suspension assay, CPGRP-S produces a dose dependent inhibition of S. aureus. The dose of 25 μg/ml of CPGRP-S was found enough to inhibit the growth of bacteria completely. However, when LPS or MDP was added to the culture at 100 μg/ml, it completely reversed the inhibitory effects of CPGRP-S as the bacterial density curve obtained with the addition of CPGRP-S and LPS/MDP fully matched with the curve, which was obtained when additives were not used. Similar conclusions could be drawn with GlcNAc and β-maltose. These results clearly indicated that CPGRP-S inhibited the bacterial growth by interacting with the molecules associated with bacterial cell walls. The binding studies have shown that all the compounds, LPS, MDP, GlcNAc, and maltose bind to CPGRP-S directly with significant binding affinities. The molecular interactions between CPGRP-S and its binding partners MDP, GlcNAc, and β-maltose were studied in real-time using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. The sensograms for the interactions of CPGRP-S with (i) MDP and (ii) GlcNAc and β-maltose are shown in supplemental Fig. S1, A and B. The increase of resonance units from the base line represents the binding of ligands to the immobilized protein. The plateau line represents the steady state equilibrium phase of interactions between protein and the ligands, whereas the decrease in resonance units from the plateau represents the dissociation phase. As seen from Fig. 3A, the dissociation phase is slower in case of MDP than other two analytes as calculated using BIA evaluation software. This showed that MDP has the higher affinity than the other two individual ligands. The value of the dissociation constant (KD) for MDP was calculated to be 3.2 × 10−7 m, whereas the KD values for GlcNAc and maltose mixture was estimated to be 3.7 × 10−6 m. Because of the bacterial cell wall components such as MDP are potent inducers of cytokine production in human PBMCs, CPGRP-S was expected to have an effect on the activation of macrophages as it has a high affinity toward MDP. Thus, the effect of CPGRP-S was evaluated on the production of TNF-α and IL-6 by MDP augmented human PBMCs. The 5 μg/ml of CPGRP-S was able to inhibit MDP-induced TNF-α and IL-6 production by 75 and 85%, respectively (Fig. 3). These are very significant results showing reduction in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines on addition of CPGRP-S to the activated PBMCs and indicate the potential of CPGRP-S in the intervention of bacterial infection induced inflammation or the septic shock. The crystal structures of two complexes of CPGRP-S (one binary complex with MDP designated as structure 1 and another ternary complex with GlcNAc and β-maltose designated as structure 2) were determined at high resolutions. CPGRP-S forms an asymmetrical homotetramer in which molecules A and B are tightly held through a series of intermolecular hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. The most critical hydrogen bonds at this interface are formed by involving amino acid residues Ser-A8, Ile-B9, Glu-B14, Arg-A122, Arg-B122, Asn-A126, and Asn-B126. In comparison, molecules C and D are held relatively loosely as the interface has direct intermolecular hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions only in a small region on the outer side, whereas the remaining three-fourths of the region of the unevenly formed interface is filled with water molecules. The prominent amino acid residues that form hydrogen bonds at the C-D interface include His-C37, His-D37, Tyr-C59, Tyr-D59, Trp-C66, glu-C150, Glu-D150, Pro-C151, Thr-D152, and Leu-D153. The dimers A-B and C-D further associate to give rise to a homotetramer in an asymmetrical manner. The molecules A and C interact with each other involving nearly 50% length of their interface covering outer part of it. The residues that are involved in intermolecular contacts from molecule A are Arg-A31, Tyr-A32, Trp-A98, Arg-A138, Ser-A139, Asn-A140, and Arg-A170, whereas those from molecule C are Glu-C21, Arg-C23, Glu-C24, and Gly-C95. On the other hand, internal faces of molecules B and D are rich in positively charged amino acid residues and hence do not form direct intermolecular interactions resulting in the formation of a channel-like structure, which appears to be stereochemically compatible for the diffusion of PAMPs. The residues of molecule B at the interface are Pro-B3, Arg-B23, Arg-B25, Arg-B28, Pro-B29, Gly-B135, and Arg-B138, whereas those on the opposite surface of molecule D are Pro-D29, Arg-D31, Arg-D138, Asn-D140, and Arg-D170, indicating a lower possibility of direct intermolecular contacts between molecules B and D. The wide channel is loosely filled with water molecules that are easily displaced by PAMPs. It may be noted that the B-factors of residues in this region are relatively higher than those in other parts of the protein, indicating a higher degree of mobility. The structure of the complex of CPGRP-S with MDP (CPGRP-S-MDP, designated as structure 1) was determined at 2.5 Å resolution (PDB 3NW3) (supplemental Fig. S2). The structure consists of four crystallographically independent protein molecules designated as A, B, C, and D, one MDP molecule bound with occupancy of 1.0 to the tetrameric complex of CPGRP-S and 400 structured water molecules. The superpositions of four protein molecules A, B, C, and D gave a root mean square deviations (r.m.s.d.) of <0.4 Å for 171 α-carbon atoms, indicating that the four protein molecules in the homotetramer have identical conformations. Furthermore, when the Cα traces of four molecules A, B, C, and D from structure 1 were superimposed on those of the unbound CPGRP-S (PDB 3C2X), the r.m.s.d. shifts were found to be only up to 0.8 Å, showing that the binding of MDP to CPGRP-S did not perturb the conformation of the protein molecule appreciably. However, the orientations of several side chains of amino acid residues in the proximity of binding of MDP were found to be considerably altered although their main chain conformations were not disturbed significantly. The prominent residues that contributed to the binding of MDP include, Arg-C85, His-C93, Gly-C95, Asn-C99, Val-C149, Gln-C150, Leu-C164, Thr-D95, Lys-D144, Asp-D148, and Asp-D149 (supplemental Table S1). Of these residues, the most critical interactions with PAMPs were provided by Trp-C66, Asn-C99, Gln-C150, Val-D149, and Gln-D150 (Fig. 4). The structure of CPGRP-S-GlcNAc-maltose (designated as structure 2) was determined at 1.7 Å resolution (PDB 3NG4) (supplemental Fig. S3). In this structure also, there were four protein molecules A, B, C, and D in the form of a homotetramer in an asymmetrical arrangement. Two compounds, GlcNAc and β-maltose were found bound to the tetrameric protein complex at the interface of molecules C and D. As indicated by refinement of the structure both compounds bound to the protein with full occupancies of 1.0. The positions of 735 water molecules were also determined, the majority of which were found interacting with protein atoms. The wide channel between molecules B and D was sparsely filled with water molecules. When the Cα traces of CPGRP-S from the present ternary complex were superimposed on the Cα traces of unbound CPGRP-S (13Sharma P. Singh N. Sinha M. Sharma S. Perbandt M. Betzel C. Kaur P. Srinivasan A. Singh T.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 378: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the overall r.m.s.d. was <0.9 Å, indicating that the conformations of protein molecules were not disturbed due to the binding of GlcNAc and β-maltose at the interface of C-D molecules in the tetrameric complex of CPGRP-S. However, the conformations of some of the side chains in the proximity of the binding of these ligands altered considerably. The residues that interacted with GlcNAc included Asn-A140, Lys-C90, Lys-C91, Asn-C99, Ala-D94, Pro-D96, Thr-D97, Asn-D99, and Gln-D150 (supplemental Table S2) (Fig. 5A). The residues that formed hydrogen bonds with β-maltose included Trp-C66, Ala-C94, Gln-C150, Gly-D65, Lys-D90, and Asn-D99 (supplemental Table S3) (Fig. 5B). As seen from supplemental Fig. S3, molecules GlcNAc and β-maltose occupy non-overlapping distinct positions in the PAMP-binding cleft. There is no common residue that interacts with both compounds but several identical residues from protein molecules C and D that contribute to the binding of two ligands. These include residues Lys-C90, Asn-C99, Ala-D94, and Gln-D150, which interact with GlcNAc, and Ala-C94, Gln-C150, Lys-D90, and Asn-D99, which interact with β-maltose. It is also noteworthy that the binding affinities of compounds, GlcNAc and β-maltose were similar even though they occupied different positions in the binding cleft. It clearly shows that the ligand binding site consists of several specific binding regions in the cleft that allows an equally efficient recognition of different PAMPs. Crystal structure determinations have shown that CPGRP-S forms a stable asymmetrical homotetramer involving four identical protein molecules A, B, C, and D, whereas HPGRP-S exists as a monomer. A comparison of amino acids present at the C-D interface shows that CPGRP-S has Ala-94, Pro-96, and Pro-151, which favor dimerization (14Sharma P. Dube D. Singh A. Mishra B. Singh N. Sinha M. Dey S. Kaur P. Mitra D.K. Sharma S. Singh T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 16208-16217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 21Kini R.M. Evans H.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 1115-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The corresponding residues in HPGRP-S are Ser-94, His-96, and Arg-151, which are not known to favor dimerization (21Kini R.M. Evans H.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 1115-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is quite evident from the amino acid sequence that molecules C and D in CPGRP-S may prefer to form a dimer, whereas the residues in HPGRP-S may not induce dimerization. Further sequence comparisons of PGRP-S from various other species (supplemental Fig. S4) shows that the corresponding amino acid residues in them do not appear to be as suitable for dimerization as in CPGRP-S. However, the final confirmation of the formation of such a multimeric state can be ascertained only by crystal structure determinations. As indicated by the contact regions between the pairs of molecules, it appears that the tetrameric structure has evolved as a dimer of two dimers formed between molecules A and B and molecules C and D. This arrangement is unique and because a cleft is formed inside the tetramer, it has functional implications. The overall design of the cleft involves contributions from all the four molecules with final binding regions residing at the interface of molecules C and D. The outer side of the C-D interface is closed as several intermolecular interactions between molecules C and D are formed on the distal site. The inner side, which is free from intermolecular contacts, opens into the void at the center of the tetramer. Because the dimers A-B and C-D are slightly shifted with respect to each other in the direction perpendicular to the C-D interface, the inner opening is contiguous to the A-C interface, which is also closed on the outer side with several intermolecular interactions between molecules A and C. The cleft comprising partial C-D and A-C interfaces is directly connected to B-D interface, which forms a long and wide channel between the center of the tetrameric complex and the surface of the protein molecules. The entry to the cleft presumably takes place through the opening at the B-D interface. The flexible N termini (residues, Glu-1 to Ser-8) of molecules B and D form flaps at the two ends of the diffusion channel, one on the surface and another inside at the entrance to the cleft which is connected to the channel via the center of the tetramer. These may help in filtering out non-PAMP molecules lacking stereochemical complimentarity. Furthermore, the shape of the B-D channel is more like a funnel with a wider orifice at the outer side that helps in capturing the PAMPs effectively. Further recognition of PAMPs is carried out by the internal surfaces of molecules B and D. The internal walls of the channel are lined up with a series of positively charged residues, Arg-B13, Arg-B23, Arg-B25, Arg-B28, and Asn-B88 from molecule B and Arg-D31, Tyr-D32, Arg-D138, Ser-D139, Asn-D140, and Arg-D170 from molecule D. The main PAMPs-binding site is comprised of an extended C-D interface along with a portion of the A-C interface. As observed in the case of MDP, the main interactions were provided by molecules C and D. The major interactions involving GlcNAc in the ternary complex came from amino acid residues of molecules A, C, and D with a majority of amino acid residues from molecule C. On the other hand, β-maltose interacted predominantly with residues from molecule D. The analysis of residues that interacted with three ligands shows an interesting pattern where MDP is in contact with two residues from molecule C, Trp-C66 and Asn-C99, and four residues from molecule D, Trp-D98, Asp-D148, Val-D149, and Glu-D150. In the case of GlcNAc, one residue, Asn-A140 from molecule A, three residues from molecule C, Lys-C90, Pro-C96, and Asn-C99 and one residue, Glu-D150, from molecule D. Of six residues that are involved in the binding to ligands, MDP and GlcNAc in the two complexes only two residues, Asn-C99 and Gln-D150 are common, whereas the remaining four residues are different. Similarly, the interactions of GlcNAc and β-maltose that form hydrogen-bonded interactions with six residues, of which only one residue Ala-C94 is common, the rest of the five residues are different. These observations clearly show that the binding subsites are distinct and recognize different chemical entities. It may be mentioned here that the multiligand specific binding sites have also been observed in other multimeric proteins such as a ubiquitously distributed cellular protein A from S. aureus (22Nguyen T. Ghebrehiwet B. Peerschke E.I. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 2061-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), laminin-binding lectin (23Bao Z.Z. Muschler J. Horwitz A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4974-4980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and some MHC tetramers (24Xu X.N. Screaton G.R. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 268: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It is clearly observed that the three compounds MDP, GlcNAc, and β-maltose interact with different residues in the binding site because these are accommodated in different subregions of the PAMP-binding site (Fig. 6). Similarly, a comparison of interactions of CPGRP-S with LPS and LTA also showed notable differences involving a number of common and different amino acid residues (14Sharma P. Dube D. Singh A. Mishra B. Singh N. Sinha M. Dey S. Kaur P. Mitra D.K. Sharma S. Singh T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 16208-16217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These observations show that the PAMP-binding site in CPGRP-S is able to accommodate different types of PAMPs with significant specificities to each PAMP because it contains multiple subsites contributed by three molecules A, C, and D, whereas the supporting diffusion channel is formed by molecules B and D. Thus the mode of binding of CPGRP-S involves direct interactions with bacteria through its cell wall surface molecules by sequestering them effectively and then disallowing their communications for further cellular growth. This mechanism of action is distinct from the effects of membrane permeabilizing antibacterial peptides, peptidoglycan-lytic enzymes, and inhibitors of peptidoglycan biosynthesis. It appears that CPGRP-S essentially targets cell wall molecular patterns rather than cell membranes. This means that CPGRP-S may be useful protein antibiotic and may not suffer from bacterial resistance. Download .pdf (.9 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W2056009016,"Human lung fibroblasts utilize integrins to attach and proliferate on type I collagen. β1 integrin is the major integrin subunit for this attachment. Integrins coordinate cellular responses to cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions that regulate a variety of biological processes. Although β1 integrin-mediated signaling pathways in lung fibroblasts have been studied, a detailed molecular mechanism regulating translational control of gene expression by 4EBP-1 is not understood. 4EBP-1 inhibits cap-dependent translation by binding to the eIF4E translation initiation factor. We found that when lung fibroblasts attach to collagen via β1 integrin, high Src activity suppresses 4EBP-1 expression via PP2A, and the decrease of 4EBP-1 is due to protein degradation. The inhibition of Src activity dramatically increases PP2A and 4EBP-1 expression. Furthermore ectopic expression of PP2A, or PP2A silencing using PP2A siRNA confirmed that 4EBP-1 is regulated by PP2A. In addition, we found that 4EBP-1 inhibition by fibroblast attachment to collagen increases cap-dependent translation. Our study showed that when lung fibroblasts are attached to collagen matrix, the β1 integrin/Src/PP2A-mediated 4EBP-1 regulatory pathway is activated. We suggest that β1 integrin-mediated signaling pathway may be a crucial event in regulating fibroblast translational control machinery on collagen matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1985026516,"Astrocytic tumor is the most prevalent primary brain tumor. However, the role of cell surface carbohydrates in astrocytic tumor invasion is not known. In a previous study, we showed that polysialic acid facilitates astrocytic tumor invasion and thereby tumor progression. Here, we examined the role of HNK-1 glycan in astrocytic tumor invasion. A Kaplan-Meier analysis of 45 patients revealed that higher HNK-1 expression levels were positively associated with increased survival of patients. To determine the role of HNK-1 glycan, we transfected C6 glioma cells, which lack HNK-1 glycan expression, with β1,3-glucuronyltransferase-P cDNA, generating HNK-1-positive cells. When these cells were injected into the mouse brain, the resultant tumors were 60% smaller than tumors emerging from injection of the mock-transfected HNK-1-negative C6 cells. HNK-1-positive C6 cells also grew more slowly than mock-transfected C6 cells in anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent assays. C6-HNK-1 cells migrated well after treatment of anti-β1 integrin antibody, whereas the same treatment inhibited cell migration of mock-transfected C6 cells. Similarly, α-dystroglycan containing HNK-1 glycan is different from those containing the laminin-binding glycans, supporting the above conclusion that C6-HNK-1 cells migrate independently from β1-integrin-mediated signaling. Moreover, HNK-1-positive cells exhibited attenuated activation of ERK 1/2 compared with mock-transfected C6 cells, whereas focal adhesion kinase activation was equivalent in both cell types. Overall, these results indicate that HNK-1 glycan functions as a tumor suppressor."
