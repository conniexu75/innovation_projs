https://openalex.org/W2045815714,"Both subjective and electroencephalographic arousal diminish as a function of the duration of prior wakefulness. Data reported here suggest that the major criteria for a neural sleep factor mediating the somnogenic effects of prolonged wakefulness are satisfied by adenosine, a neuromodulator whose extracellular concentration increases with brain metabolism and which, in vitro, inhibits basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. In vivo microdialysis measurements in freely behaving cats showed that adenosine extracellular concentrations in the basal forebrain cholinergic region increased during spontaneous wakefulness as contrasted with slow wave sleep; exhibited progressive increases during sustained, prolonged wakefulness; and declined slowly during recovery sleep. Furthermore, the sleep-wakefulness profile occurring after prolonged wakefulness was mimicked by increased extracellular adenosine induced by microdialysis perfusion of an adenosine transport inhibitor in the cholinergic basal forebrain but not by perfusion in a control noncholinergic region."

More than 300,000 transcripts derived from at least 45,000 different genes were analyzed. Although extensive similarity was noted between the expression profiles, more than 500 transcripts that were expressed at significantly different levels in normal and neoplastic cells were identified. These data provide insight into the extent of expression differences underlying malignancy and reveal genes that may prove useful as diagnostic or prognostic markers."

https://openalex.org/W2038932046,"We report here purification and characterization of chro- mosome condensation protein complexes (termed condensins) containing XCAP-C and XCAP-E, two Xenopus members of the SMC family. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation reveals two major forms of condensins. The 8S form is a heterodimer of XCAP-C and XCAP-E, whereas the 13S form contains three additional subunits. One of them is identified as a homolog of the Drosophila Barren protein whose mutation shows a defect in chromosome segregation. Chromosomal targeting of condensins is mitosis-specific and is independent of topoisomerase IIα. 13S condensin is required for condensation, as demonstrated by immunodepletion and rescue experiments. Our results suggest that the condensin complexes represent the most abundant structural components of mitotic chromosomes and play a central role in driving chromosome condensation."

https://openalex.org/W1995632531,"Garito and co-workers have suggested a mechanism to dramatically increase the second hyperpolarizability, γ, in linear π-electron–conjugated molecules. Polarization is introduced that leads to a difference between the dipole moments of the molecule’s ground state and excited state. Here a series of carotenoids was examined that had increasing intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the polyenic chain to the acceptor moiety in the ground state, and γ was measured for these compounds as a function of wavelength by third-harmonic generation. The compound with the greatest ICT exhibited a 35-fold enhancement of γ max (the γ measured at the peak of the three-photon resonance) relative to the symmetric molecule β-carotene, which itself has one of the largest third-order nonlinearities known. Stark spectroscopic measurements revealed the existence of a large difference dipole moment, Δμ, between the ground and excited state. Quantum-chemical calculations underline the importance of interactions involving states with large Δμ."
https://openalex.org/W2076897193,"Brain regions responsive to novelty, without awareness, were mapped in humans by positron emission tomography. Participants performed a simple reaction-time task in which all stimuli were equally likely but, unknown to them, followed a complex sequence. Measures of behavioral performance indicated that participants learned the sequences even though they were unaware of the existence of any order. Once the participants were trained, a subtle and unperceived change in the nature of the sequence resulted in increased blood flow in a network comprising the left premotor area, left anterior cingulate, and right ventral striatum. Blood flow decreases were observed in the right dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal areas. The time course of these changes suggests that the ventral striatum is responsive to novel information, and the right prefrontal area is associated with the maintenance of contextual information, and both processes can occur without awareness."
https://openalex.org/W1991917686,"Angles between two interatomic vectors are measured for structure elucidation in solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The angles can be determined directly by using the effects of dipole-dipole cross-correlated relaxation of double-quantum and zero-quantum coherences. The measured rates can be directly related to the angular geometry without need for calibration of a Karplus-type curve, as is the case for scalar coupling measurements, and depend only on the rotational correlation time of the molecule as an empirical parameter. This makes the determination of torsional angles independent from the measurement of coupling constants. The two interatomic vectors can in principle be arbitrarily far apart. The method was demonstrated on the measurement of the peptide backbone angle psi in the protein rhodniin, which is difficult to determine in solution by NMR spectroscopy."
https://openalex.org/W2077634814,"Eukaryotic secretory proteins are cotranslationally translocated through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane via aqueous pores that span the lipid bilayer. Fluorescent probes were incorporated into nascent secretory proteins using modified Lys-tRNAs, and the resulting nascent chains were sealed off from the cytosol in fully assembled translocation intermediates. Fluorescence quenching agents of different sizes were then introduced into the ER lumen in order to determine which were small enough to enter the pore and to quench the fluorescence of probes inside the ribosome and/or the pore. These accessibility studies showed that the aqueous pore in a functioning translocon is 40-60 A in diameter, making it the largest hole observed to date in a membrane that must maintain a permeability barrier."
https://openalex.org/W2069299583,"Cell adhesion to substratum has been shown to regulate cyclin A expression as well as cyclin D- and E-dependent kinases, the latter via the up-regulation of cyclin D1 and the down-regulation of cyclin-Cdk inhibitors p21 and p27, respectively. This adhesion-dependent regulation of cell cycle is thought to be mediated by integrins. Here we demonstrate that stable transfection and overexpression of theintegrin-linked kinase (ILK), which interacts with the β1 and β3 integrin cytoplasmic domains, induces anchorage-independent cell cycle progression but not serum-independent growth of rat intestinal epithelial cells (IEC18). ILK overexpression results in increased expression of cyclin D1, activation of Cdk4 and cyclin E-associated kinases, and hyperphosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein. In addition, ILK overexpression results in the expression of p21 and p27 Cdk inhibitors with altered electrophoretic mobilities, with the p27 from ILK-overexpressing cells having reduced inhibitory activity. The transfer of serum-exposed IEC18 cells from adherent cultures to suspension cultures results in a rapid down-regulation of expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin A proteins as well as in retinoblastoma protein dephosphorylation. In marked contrast, transfer of ILK-overexpressing cells from adherent to suspension cultures results in continued high levels of expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin A proteins, and a substantial proportion of the retinoblastoma protein remains in a hyperphosphorylated state. These results indicate that, when overexpressed, ILK induces signaling pathways resulting in the stimulation of G1/S cyclin-Cdk activities, which are normally regulated by cell adhesion and integrin engagement. Cell adhesion to substratum has been shown to regulate cyclin A expression as well as cyclin D- and E-dependent kinases, the latter via the up-regulation of cyclin D1 and the down-regulation of cyclin-Cdk inhibitors p21 and p27, respectively.

Normal, untransformed epithelial cells require anchorage to a substratum for cell growth and survival. Adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; Rb, retinoblastoma; ILK, integrin-linked kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HRP, horseradish peroxidase. 1through the G1 and into the S phase of the cell cycle. When forced to remain in suspension, such cells arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and undergo apoptosis (1Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Google Scholar, 2Meredith J. Bazeli B. Schwartz M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 953-961Google Scholar, 3Boudreau N. Sympson C.J. Werb Z. Bissell M.J. Science. 1995; 267: 891-893Google Scholar). Oncogenic transformation frequently induces anchorage-independent growth, in vitro, and is a specific correlate of tumor growth in vivo (4Shin S.-I. Freedman V.H. Risser R. Pollack R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4435Google Scholar, 5Ruoslahti E. Reed J. Cell. 1994; 77: 477-478Google Scholar). In fibroblasts, cell adhesion has recently been demonstrated to regulate cell cycle progression by inducing the expression of cyclin D1 (6Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Bohmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 391-403Google Scholar), the activation of cyclin E-Cdk2 (6Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Bohmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 391-403Google Scholar, 7Fang F. Orend G. Watanabe N. Hunter T. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1996; 271: 499-502Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) (6Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Bohmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 391-403Google Scholar). Fibroblast adhesion also results in the down-regulation of expression of the Cdk inhibitor proteins, p21 and p27 (6Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Bohmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 391-403Google Scholar, 7Fang F. Orend G. Watanabe N. Hunter T. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1996; 271: 499-502Google Scholar). The combined, adhesion-dependent elevation in cyclin D1 and the decrease in the expression of p21 and p27 result in the stimulation of cyclin D-Cdk4 and cyclin E-Cdk2 activities, both of which can phosphorylate Rb. This latter event relieves the restriction of the entry of cells into S phase, presumably by the release of the transcription factor E2F from phosphorylated Rb (8Johnson D.G. Schwarz J.K. Cress W.D. Newins J.R. Nature. 1993; 365: 349-352Google Scholar, 9Sherr C.J. Cell. 1996; 79: 551-555Google Scholar). In some cell types the expression of cyclin A is also regulated in an anchorage-dependent manner (3Boudreau N. Sympson C.J. Werb Z. Bissell M.J. Science. 1995; 267: 891-893Google Scholar, 10Schulze A. Zerfan-Thome K. Berges J. Middendorp S. Jansen-Dur P. Henglein B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4632-4638Google Scholar, 11Kang J. Kraus R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3370-3380Google Scholar), and anchorage-independent growth induced by activated Ras has been shown to depend on cyclin A expression (11Kang J. Kraus R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3370-3380Google Scholar). However, in these latter experiments cyclin D1 expression (12Filmus J. Robles A.I. Shi W. Wong M.J. Colombo L.L. Conti C.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3627-3633Google Scholar) and cyclin E-dependent kinase activity (11Kang J. Kraus R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3370-3380Google Scholar) were also dependent on Ras activation. Although mitogens can also activate cyclin D- and cyclin E-dependent kinases, cell adhesion per se can regulate these activities. The regulation of G1 Cdks, therefore, requires the convergence of signals from both growth factors as well as from the ECM. Anchorage of cells to the ECM is mediated to a large extent by integrins, a large family of heterodimeric cell surface receptors (13Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-600Google Scholar,14Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Google Scholar). The interaction of integrins with ECM ligands results in the transduction of intracellular signals leading to stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation (15Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Google Scholar, 16Dedhar S. Hannigan G.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 8: 657-669Google Scholar), turnover of phosphoinositides (17McNamee H.P. Ingber D.E. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 673-678Google Scholar), and activation of the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways (18Kapron-Bras C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Jeevaratnam P. Wilkins J. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20701-20704Google Scholar, 19Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Google Scholar, 20Clark E.A. Hynes R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14814-14818Google Scholar, 21Chen Q. Lin T.H. Der C.J. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18122-18127Google Scholar). The activation of MAPK by cell adhesion is dependent on the presence of an intact actin cytoskeleton (22Zhu X. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 273-282Google Scholar), as well as activated p21rho (23Hotchin N.A. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1857-1865Google Scholar). Presumably the adhesion-dependent stimulation of cyclin A expression and of cyclin D1- and cyclin E-associated Cdk activities is also mediated via integrins, although it is not clear as yet whether this requires the activation of MAPK. The cytoplasmic domain of the integrin β1 subunit is required for many of the integrin mediated signaling events (13Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-600Google Scholar, 24Akiyama S.K. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. LaFlamme S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15961-15964Google Scholar, 25Lukashev M.E. Sheppard D. Pytela R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18311-18314Google Scholar). Integrin-proximal events involved in the initiation of integrin-mediated signal transduction are still poorly understood. However, a novel ankyrin-repeat containing serine-threonine protein kinase (ILK) has recently been demonstrated to associate with the integrin β1 and β3 subunit cytoplasmic domains (26Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Google Scholar) and may be involved in regulating integrin-mediated signaling. Overexpression of ILK in intestinal epithelial cells results in an altered cellular morphology, reduction in cell adhesion to ECM, and also the stimulation of anchorage-independent growth in soft agar (26Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Google Scholar). Such constitutively ILK-overexpressing cells are also tumorigenic in nude mice. We now report that overexpression of ILK in rat intestinal epithelial cells (IEC18) increases the expression of cyclin A, cyclin D1, and Cdk4 proteins. The activities of both cyclin D1-Cdk4 and cyclin E-Cdk2 kinases are also elevated, resulting in hyperphosphorylation of the Rb protein. In addition both p21 and p27, inhibitors of cyclin-Cdks, have altered electrophoretic mobilities and p27 from ILK-overexpressing cells has reduced inhibitory activity as compared with the p27 from the parental IEC18 cells. Furthermore, whereas cyclin A and cyclin D1 protein expression, and Rb phosphorylation, are down-regulated upon transfer of IEC18 cells to suspension culture, they are constitutively up-regulated in ILK-overexpressing cells kept in suspension. ILK overexpression in these epithelial cells thus overrides the adhesion-dependent regulation of cell cycle progression through G1 and into S phase, indicating that ILK maybe a key regulator of integrin-mediated cell cycle progression. Three cell lines were used throughout this study: IEC18, ILK13, and ILK14. IEC18 is an immortalized non-tumorigenic rat intestinal epithelial cell line (27Quaromi A. Isselbacher K.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1981; 67: 1353-1362Google Scholar), cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), 3.6 mg/ml glucose (Sigma), 10 μg/ml insulin (Sigma), and 5% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). ILK13 cells were engineered to overexpress ILK by stable transfection into the parental IEC18 as described previously (26Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Google Scholar). ILK14 cells are the control transfectants (26Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Google Scholar). Both ILK13 and ILK14 cell lines were grown under the same conditions as the parental IEC18, with addition of 200 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.) to maintain a selection pressure for ILK or control vector, respectively. Two independently derived clones of each ILK13 (A1a3 and A4a) and ILK14 (A2c3 and A2c6) were used. IEC18, ILK13 (ILK-overexpressing cells) and ILK14 (control transfectants) cells were harvested from tissue culture, counted and 104 cells from each cell line were plated in 35-mm tissue culture plates (Nunc). Cells were grown in α-minimal essential medium as described above under different serum concentrations (fetal calf serum, Life Technologies, Inc.) for various number of days. At each time point, adherent cells were harvested with 5 mm EDTA/PBS (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.6) and viable cells were then quantitated by trypan blue exclusion. Asynchronously growing cells were harvested from monolayer culture using 5 mm EDTA/PBS and washed two times in PBS. Cells were then resuspended in α-minimal essential medium containing 5% fetal calf serum and transferred to 50-ml tubes. A short burst of CO2 was given to the cells before tubes were capped. Suspension cells were incubated for 12 h, rotating on a nutator at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Thereafter, cells were either fixed for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis or alternatively cell pellets were recovered, washed twice in ice-cold PBS, and then lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Cells were collected, washed in ice-cold PBS (pH 7.6), fixed in 70% ethanol for 1 h on ice, rinsed with PBS, and DNA stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide in PBS containing 10 μg/ml RNase for 30 min at room temperature. Cell cycle profiles were analyzed by FACS using a Becton Dickinson FACScan analyzer, and the percentage of cells in the various phases of cell cycle was calculated using CellFit software. Cells grown in monolayer or in suspension were lysed in ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mmEDTA) plus inhibitors (1.0 mm PMSF, 20 μg/ml aprotonin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin) or in ice-cold Tween 20 lysis buffer (0.1% Tween 20, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA) plus inhibitors (1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0 mm PMSF, 20 μg/ml aprotonin, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmsodium vanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride). Total protein extracts or immune complexes were resolved on SDS-PAGE and then transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore). The membrane was first blocked in 5% milk in TBST (0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma) in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4) and then incubated with primary antibody. The following antibodies were used: anti-cyclin D1 (DCS-6, mouse monoclonal, from Dr. J. Bartek, Danish Cancer Society, Copenhagen, Denmark), anti-cyclin E (rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz), anti-cyclin A (rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz), anti-Cdk4 (rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz), anti-Cdk2 (rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz), anti-PSTAIRE (mouse monoclonal, a gift from Dr. S. Reed, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA), anti-p27 (mouse monoclonal, Transduction Laboratories), anti-p21 (rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz), anti-retinoblastoma (mouse monoclonal, Pharmingen), and anti-ILK (affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal). Protein detection was carried out using secondary antibody (either anti-mouse-HRP (Jackson Laboratories or Pharmingen), anti-rabbit-HRP (Jackson Laboratories), or protein A-HRP (Amersham Life Science)) and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Life Science). For Cdk4-associated kinase activity, asynchronous cells growing in monolayer culture were lysed in ice-cold Tween 20 lysis buffer (0.1% Tween 20, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mmEDTA), containing the following inhibitors (1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 20 μg/ml aprotonin, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride). Cell lysates were then sonicated. Protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma Immunochemicals Co.) precoated with Cdk4 antibody (rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz) were used to immunoprecipitate Cdk4. Cdk4-associated kinase activity was assayed using the protocol of Matsushime et al. (28Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 14: 2066-2076Google Scholar). For cyclin E kinase assays, cells from asynchronous monolayer culture were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6) plus protease inhibitors (0.1 mm PMSF, 20 μg/ml aprotonin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin). Cyclin E was immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-cyclin E serum (gift from Dr. Steve Reed, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA and also from Dr. D. Agrawal, M. Lee Moffit Cancer Center, Tampa, FL) and complexes collected on protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma Immunochemicals Co.). Cyclin E-associated kinase reactions were carried out as described previously (29Dulic V. Lees E. Reed S.I. Science. 1996; 257: 1958-1961Google Scholar). For both cyclin D1-Cdk4 and cyclin E-Cdk2 assays, kinase reaction products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and the incorporation of radioactivity in substrate was visualized by autoradiography (X-Omat AR (Eastman Kodak Co.) or REFLECTION™ (DuPont)) and quantitated by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Cell lysates (100 μg of protein) were recovered from asynchronously growing IEC18 or ILK-overexpressing cells using lysis buffer as for cyclin E-Cdk2 kinase assays with Nonidet P-40 at 0.1% concentration. Lysates were boiled for 5 min and clarified by centrifugation. p27 was immunoprecipitated (rabbit polyclonal anti-p27 serum provided by Dr. T. Hunter, Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA) from boiled lysates. Immune complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose beads and then washed five times in 0.1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. To release bound p27, the beads were resuspended in 200 μl of 0.1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, containing protease inhibitors (1 mm PMSF and 20 μg/ml each aprotonin, leupeptin, and pepstatin), boiled for 5 min and supernatants recovered. Cyclin A-Cdk2 complexes immunoprecipitated from asynchronous ILK14 cells (control-transfected cells) were used as test substrate for inhibition by p27. Heat-stable p27 released from immune complexes was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min together with cyclin A-Cdk2. Cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity was assayed using histone H1 (Boehringer Mannheim) as a substrate and compared with the activity of cyclin A-Cdk2 complexes without added immunoprecipitated p27. As a negative control, non-immune serum immunoprecipitates were collected, boiled, and supernatant added to active cyclin A-Cdk2 test complexes. The p27 antiserum used in these assays does not cross-react with p21. Detection of radioactivity in kinase substrate was carried out as described for kinase assays. We have shown previously that overexpression of the ILK in normal rat intestinal epithelial cells (IEC18) results in a less adherent phenotype and in anchorage-independent growth in soft agar (26Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Google Scholar). When maintained in suspension, IEC18 cells have been demonstrated to undergo programmed cell death (30Rak J. Mitsuhashi Y. Erdos V. Huang S.N. Filmus J. Kerbel R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1587-1598Google Scholar), which is suppressed by mutant c-Ha-rasoncogene expression (30Rak J. Mitsuhashi Y. Erdos V. Huang S.N. Filmus J. Kerbel R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1587-1598Google Scholar). Since we have found that ILK overexpression in IEC18 cells induces anchorage-independent growth as well as tumorigenicity in nude mice, 2C. Wu, S. Y. Keightley, C. Leung-Hagesteijn, G. Radeva, J. McDonald, and S. Dedhar, submitted for publication. we wanted to determine whether ILK overexpression also suppresses suspension-induced cell cycle arrest and cell death. ILK-overexpressing cell clones (ILK13) are capable of anchorage-independent cell growth in soft agar (26Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Google Scholar). This increased cell survival is reflected in the greater proportion of ILK13 cells that are present in S phase after 12 h in suspension, as compared with the control ILK14 cells, in which the percentage of cells in S phase falls to 5% (Fig.1 A). Furthermore, a sub-G1 (<2n) population is present in the control ILK14 cells after 12 h in suspension, consistent with the presence of apoptotic cells. This population of cells is completely absent in the ILK-overexpressing ILK13 clones (Fig. 1 A). We next wished to address whether ILK overexpression also induces serum-independent growth in monolayer-adherent cultures. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the growth rate of ILK13 cells is not elevated when compared with the IEC18 or the control ILK14 cells. In fact, the ILK-overexpressing clones grow slightly more slowly than the parental IEC18 and the ILK14 control-transfected cells (Fig. 1 B). In addition, ILK13 cells fail to survive in serum-free conditions similar to the IEC18 and control ILK14 cells. These data demonstrate that ILK overexpression selectively induces anchorage-independent growth but not serum (mitogen)-independent growth. Adhesion of fibroblasts to ECM has been shown to induce the expression of cyclin D1 (6Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Bohmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 391-403Google Scholar). Since overexpression of ILK in epithelial IEC18 cells induces cell survival and cell cycle progression in the absence of adhesion, we wanted to determine whether ILK overexpression altered the expression and/or activity of cell cycle regulators. The expression of various cell cycle regulators was examined in IEC18, ILK13, and ILK14 cells growing under standard tissue culture conditions. As shown in Fig. 2 A, ILK-overexpressing cell clones (ILK13) (26Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Google Scholar) express substantially higher levels of cyclin D1 protein than the parental IEC18, or control-transfected ILK14 cells. In contrast, the level of expression of cyclin E is not altered in ILK13 cells. The expression of cyclin A was examined as well and was found to be elevated in ILK13 cells (data not shown in Fig. 2; see Fig. 4). Since the cyclins function in complex with the cyclin-dependent kinases, Cdks, we also determined the expression of Cdk4 and Cdk2 kinases that complex with cyclin D1 and cyclin E, respectively. Surprisingly the level of Cdk4 protein is also elevated in the ILK13 cells, whereas Cdk2 is not altered (Fig.2 A). The kinase activities of Cdk4 and Cdk2 are also regulated by inhibitor proteins, p21 and p27, and the expression of these inhibitors is known to be enhanced in non-adherent (suspension) cells and decreases upon cell adhesion (6Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Bohmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 391-403Google Scholar, 7Fang F. Orend G. Watanabe N. Hunter T. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1996; 271: 499-502Google Scholar). In ILK-overexpressing cells, both p21 and p27 are increased (Fig. 2 A), and their electrophoretic mobilities are clearly altered. The faster migrating forms of p21 and p27 in ILK-overexpressing cells may reflect covalent modification, or in the case of p27, the product of partial proteolytic cleavage (31Loda M. Cukor B. Tam S.W. Lavin P. Fiorentino M. Draetta G.F. Jessup M. Pagano M. Draetta G.F. Nature Med. 1997; : 231-234Google Scholar). For p27, at least, this alteration correlates with a decreased inhibitory potential (see Fig. 3 b). Such faster migrating forms have also been observed after exposure of fibroblasts to UV irradiation (32Poon R.Y.C. Jiang W. Toyoshima H. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13283-13291Google Scholar).Figure 4Adhesion-independent overexpression of cyclin D1 and cyclin A, and hyperphosphorylation of Rb in ILK-overexpressing cells. Expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin A and phosphorylation of Rb were analyzed in response to cell attachment. Adherent ILK13 and ILK14 cells were harvested, transferred into 50-ml tubes, and maintained in suspension (S) for 12 h. Cell lysates were then recovered from cells in suspension (S) and cells growing in monolayer culture (A). Cyclin D1, cyclin A, and Rb proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. A, each cell line was found to have elevated cyclin D1 protein upon adhesion to substratum in comparison to cells kept in suspension. However, the level of cyclin D1 is constitutively higher in ILK13 cells kept in suspension. B, cyclin A protein was higher in ILK13 adherent cells than in ILK14 adherent. After transferring cells in suspension, ILK13 cells continue to maintain high cyclin A, while in ILK14 cells cyclin A expression falls dramatically. C, the retinoblastoma protein is hyperphosphorylated in suspension ILK13 cells, but not in control suspension ILK14 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3Panel a, effect of ILK overexpression on the kinase activities of the G1/S cyclin-Cdk complexes.A, cyclin D1-Cdk4 kinase assay. Following immunoprecipitation of Cdk4 from IEC18, ILK13, and ILK14 cells, anin vitro kinase assay was performed using Rb (QED Bioscience Inc.) as substrate. The incorporation of radioactivity in Rb substrate is severalfold higher in ILK13 clones, indicating higher kinase activity of cyclin D1-Cdk4 in the ILK-overexpressing cells.B, cyclin E-Cdk2 kinase assay. Cyclin E was immunoprecipitated from IEC18, ILK13, and ILK14 cells, and the associated Cdk2 histone H1 kinase activity was assayed in vitro. Cyclin E-Cdk2 from the ILK13 cells showed higher kinase activity then that of cyclin E-Cdk2 from IEC18 or ILK14 cells. Thelower panels in A and B represent IgG from Coomassie Blue-stained gels to confirm equal loading.C, immunoblot of retinoblastoma protein immunoprecipitated from the three different cell lines: IEC18, ILK13, and ILK14. ILK13 cells (ILK overexpressors) show an increase in the hyperphosphorylated form of Rb, as compared with IEC18 and ILK14, in which no difference between the two forms of Rb is detected. Panel b, p27 inhibitory activity and immunoprecipitation. A, inhibitor activity: increasing amounts of p27 were immunoprecipitated from asynchronous IEC18 cells (1x, 100 μg of lysate;2x, 200 μg of lysate; 3x, 300 μg of lysate), recovered on protein A-Sepharose beads, and released by boiling. Heat-stable p27 was mixed with cyclin A-Cdk2 immunoprecipitated from 100 μg of lysates from asynchronously growing cells, and the ability of p27 to inhibit the test cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity was assayed. (Cyclin A-Cdk2 kinase activity, without any added p27, is shown infirst lane.) No Cdk2 inhibitory activity was recovered from boiled preimmune (PI) serum immunoprecipitates.B, p27 inhibitory activity in IEC18 and ILK13 cells. Equal quantities of p27 (1x) were immunoprecipitated from IEC18 and ILK13 cells. p27 was released from protein A-Sepharose beads by boiling, added to test cyclin A-Cdk2 from 50 μg of lysate, and kinase activity was assayed on H1 as a substrate. H1 kinase reactions were resolved by SDS-PAGE, gels dried, and radioactivity in histone H1 bands was quantitated by PhosphorImager. The activity of test cyclin A-Cdk2 without inhibitor was compared with that with added p27, and results are presented as percent maximum kinase activity in uninhibited cyclin A-Cdk2. Comparison of p27 inhibitory activity from equal amounts of p27 from IEC18 and ILK13 (1x and 2x) shows greater inhibition by p27 from IEC18 cells. C, levels of p27 used in the inhibitor assays (B). To show that the amounts of p27 added to test cyclin A-Cdk2 in the inhibitor assays shown inB were equivalent, p27 was immunoprecipitated from IEC18 (1x, 50 μg of lysate) and ILK13 cells (1x, 15 μg; 2x, 30 μg). The quantity of p27 used is shown by resolving complexes by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with p27 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To demonstrate that the observed changes are mediated by ILK, we transfected IEC18 cells with an ILK expression vector under the control of a metal inducible promoter (33Filmus J. Remani J. Klein M.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2755-2760Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B, induction of ILK expression with Zn2+/Cd2+results in the stimulation of expression of ILK. Concomitantly, the expression of cyclin D1 is also induced in these cells (Fig.2 B). The data shown were confirmed in two independent clones, and the treatment of the parental IEC18 cells with Zn2+/Cd2+ had no effect on ILK or cyclin D1 expression (data not shown). These data demonstrate that increased ILK expression can induce the expression of cyclin D1 protein. We next determined whether the complex formation between the cyclins, Cdks, and the p21/p27 inhibitors was also altered upon ILK overexpression. As shown in Fig. 2 C, both cyclin D1 and Cdk4 are elevated in Cdk4 immunoprecipitates from ILK13 cells as compared with the parental IEC18 and control ILK14 cells. Although the amount of p27 is also higher in Cdk4 immunoprecipitates from ILK13 cells, quantification clearly demonstrates that the ratio of p27 to cyclin D1-Cdk4 is much higher in IEC18 and ILK14 cells than it is in the ILK13 cells (Table I). Furthermore, the p27 in Cdk4 immunoprecipitates from ILK13 clones has the faster electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 2 C). The amount of cyclin E-associated Cdk2 did not differ between the parental IEC18 and ILK-overexpressing (ILK13) cells. However, in th"

https://openalex.org/W1965860054,"Cortactin, a prominent substrate for pp60c-src, is a filamentous actin (F-actin) binding protein. We show here that cortactin can promote sedimentation of F-actin at centrifugation forces under which F-actin is otherwise not able to be precipitated.

Hence, cortactin is also an F-actin cross-linking protein. We also demonstrate that the optimal F-actin cross-linking activity of cortactin requires a physiological pH in a range of 7.3–7.5.

Cortactin (p80/p85) was initially discovered as a major phosphotyrosine-containing protein in v-Src-transformed chicken embryo fibroblasts (1Wu H. Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5113-5124Google Scholar). The murine homologue was independently isolated as a signaling molecule involved in the transition from G0 to G1 phase in response to fibroblast growth factor (2Zhan X. Hu X. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9611-9620Google Scholar, 3Zhan X. Hu X. Hampton B. Burgess W.H. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24427-24431Google Scholar), and the human cortactin was found as an oncogene that is frequently amplified in subsets of tumors and tumor cell lines (4Schuuring E.D. Verhoeven E. Litvinov S. Michalides R.J.A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2891-2898Google Scholar, 5Bringuier P.P. Tamimi Y. Schuuring E. Schalken J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1747-1753Google Scholar). A strong association of cortactin with F-actin 1The abbreviations used are: F-actin, filamentous actin; SH3, Src homology 3; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: F-actin, filamentous actin; SH3, Src homology 3; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. has been described (14Wu H. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Google Scholar). Consistent with its F-actin binding activity, cortactin primarily localizes within peripheral cell structures such as lamellipodia, pseudopodia, and membrane ruffles (9Maa M. Wilson L.K. Moyers J.S. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Parsons S.J. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2429-2438Google Scholar, 14Wu H. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Google Scholar), which are enriched for cytoskeletal proteins. However, unlike many other F-actin-binding proteins, the protein sequence of cortactin features a unique structure characterized by six and a half 37-amino acid tandem repeats and a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain at the carboxyl terminus. Between the SH3 and the repeat domains are an α-helix domain and a sequence region rich in proline residues. Recent evidence has indicated that cortactin is a prominent substrate for Src-related protein-tyrosine kinases (1Wu H. Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5113-5124Google Scholar, 6Nada S. Okada M. Aizawa S. Nakagawa H. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3571-3578Google Scholar, 7Ohsato Y. Nada S. Okada M. Nakagawa H. Jpn. J.

Furthermore, cortactin is implicated in signaling mediated by multiple extracellular stimuli including fibroblast growth factor (3Zhan X. Hu X. Hampton B. Burgess W.H. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24427-24431Google Scholar), epidermal growth factor (9Maa M. Wilson L.K. Moyers J.S. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Parsons S.J. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2429-2438Google Scholar), thrombin (10Wong S. Reynolds A.B. Papkoff J. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2407-2415Google Scholar), integrin (11Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22259-22262Google Scholar), bacteria-mediated cell invasion (12Dehio C. Prevost M.C. Sansonetti P.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2471-2482Google Scholar), and mechanical strain (13Liu M. Qin Y. Tanswell A.K. Post M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7066-7071Google Scholar). While tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is a profound phenomenon in response to many extracellular stimuli, the biological function of cortactin and the physiological role of tyrosine phosphorylation are not clear. In an attempt to elucidate the function of cortactin, we have examined biochemical properties of cortactin. The study presented here demonstrated that cortactin is a potent F-actin cross-linking protein. Most importantly, the F-actin cross-linking activity is down-regulated upon phosphorylation mediated by pp60c-src. Thus, cortactin may act as an important mediator for intracellular tyrosine kinases in regulating the cytoskeleton reorganization in vivo. Murine cortactin was expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein in pGEX-2T plasmid and purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) as described previously (15Zhan X. Plourde C. Hu X. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20221-20224Google Scholar). The glutathioneS-transferase part of the fusion protein was removed by cleavage with bovine thrombin (ICN) in a digestion buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, containing 100 mm NaCl and 1 mm CaCl2) for 3∼4 h at room temperature. The digested materials were loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose FF (Pharmacia) column and eluted with 200 ml of elution buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EGTA, and KCl with a gradient concentration from 20 to 600 mm). The fractions containing cortactin were pooled, and undigested fusion proteins were removed by additional chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose. The concentration of purified cortactin was determined by the Dc protein assay (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Actin was purified from an acetone powder of rabbit skeletal muscle according to Pardee and Spudich (16Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Google Scholar). Pyrene-labeled actin was prepared as described by Kouyama and Mihashi (17Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Google Scholar). The labeled actin was further purified by chromatography using Sephadex G-150 (Pharmacia). Globular actin was polymerized into filaments by adding KCl, MgCl2, and ATP to the final concentrations of 134, 1, and 1 mm, respectively, and incubated for at least 4 h at room temperature. Recombinant human pp60c-src (18Barker S.C. Kassel D.B. Weigl D. Huang X. Luther M.A. Knight W.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14843-14851Google Scholar) was preactivated and maintained in a buffer containing 40 μm ATP, 0.8 mmMgCl2, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 0 °C. To prepare tyrosine-phosphorylated cortactin, purified proteins were incubated with various amounts of preactivated pp60c-src in 20 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm ATP, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 6000 ci/mmol) at room temperature for 1 h. For F-actin cross-linking analysis, phosphorylated cortactin proteins were diluted to a final volume of 50 μl of which the final concentrations of KCl and MgCl2 were readjusted to 134 and 2 mm, respectively. To confirm and quantitate phosphorylated cortactin, aliquots of the reactions were combined with an equal volume of 2 × SDS sample buffer (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) and fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, and the phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Purified cortactin at the indicated concentrations in 50 μl of TKM buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 134 mm KCl and 1 mm MgCl2) was mixed with an equal volume of 8 μm pyrene-labeled F-actin and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The mixture was then immediately centrifuged at 26,300 × g for 10 min at room temperature in a Beckman TL-100 centrifuge. The supernatant was carefully transferred to a new tube and mixed with 300 μl of TKM buffer containing 2 μm phalloidin (Sigma). The fluorescence in the supernatant was recorded on an LS50B luminescence spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer) at an excitation wavelength of 370 nm with a slit of 2.5 nm and an emission wavelength of 410 nm with a slit 6 nm, respectively. The decrease in the supernatant fluorescence reflects the precipitation of F-actin due to cross-linking. In some experiments, the precipitated pellets were directly analyzed by SDS-PAGE. F-actin or the mixture of F-actin and cortactin was mixed with an equal volume of 1% phosphotungstic acid in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The stained samples (10 μl) were absorbed to a 0.25% Formvar 15/95E resin- (Sigma) coated film on a gold grid. The grid was then air-dried overnight. Transmission electron micrographs were taken with a Philips M12 microscope. In an effort to investigate the function of cortactin, the murine cortactin was expressed in E. coli as a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein. The glutathioneS-transferase-free cortactin was used for the evaluation of its F-actin cross-linking activity by virtue of a co-sedimentation assay (20Brotschi E.A. Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8988-8993Google Scholar). To determine optimal conditions for the assay, cortactin was incubated with F-actin for 30 min and subjected to centrifugation at different forces from 13,000 to 30,000 × g for 10 min. Under these conditions, neither filaments in the absence of cortactin (Fig. 1 A) nor cortactin alone could be precipitated (data not shown). However, the presence of both cortactin and F-actin resulted in a dramatic increase in the amount of F-actin associated with pellets in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B). The half-maximum effect requires an approximately 1:100 molecular ratio of cortactin to actin, and the maximum sedimentation (80% of total F-actin) can be reached in the presence of a 1:36 ratio of cortactin to actin. The sedimentation of F-actin induced by cortactin is also correlated with the association of cortactin with F-actin, as shown by their co-sedimentation at a ratio of 1 cortactin molecule to approximately 15 actin subunits (Fig.1 C), which is in agreement with the stoichiometry for the binding of cortactin to actin (14Wu H. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Google Scholar). The two bands of 85 and 90 kDa shown on the gel most likely reflect different conformations of cortactin, since only one band of 85 kDa was visualized when SDS-PAGE was performed in the presence of 5 m urea (data not shown). A kinetic study further demonstrated that cortactin-mediated F-actin precipitation is a rapid process (Fig. 1 D). Incubation with cortactin for 2 min resulted in a sedimentation of more than 60% of F-actin, although the maximum sedimentation (80% of total F-actin) only occurred at 30 min after interaction. The cross-linked F-actin in the presence of cortactin was further examined by electron microscopy after negative staining. Filaments prepared in the absence of cortactin displayed individual single strands (Fig. 2,A and C). In the presence of cortactin, however, most F-actin strands became thicker and formed a bundle-like structure (Fig. 2, B and D).Figure 2Electron microscopy of cross-linked F-actin in the presence of cortactin. F-actin or a mixture of F-actin and cortactin were stained with phosphotungstic acid as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A and C, filaments only (4 μm); B and D, filaments plus cortactin (4 μm and 107 nm, respectively). A and B have a magnification of × 1,800; C and D have a magnification of × 20,000.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Since activities of many F-actin cross-linking proteins are dependent on Ca2+ and pH, we examined the effects of Ca2+and pH on the activity of cortactin. In the presence of either EGTA or various concentrations of Ca2+, the F-actin cross-linking activity of cortactin was not affected (data not shown). However, when the cross-linking assay was performed at different pH values, the optimal sedimentation of F-actin was observed in a range from pH 7.3 to 7.5. The F-actin sedimentation induced by cortactin at pH 6.9 and 8.2 is only approximately 30% of that at pH 7.4 (Fig. 3). The apparent effect of pH on the F-actin cross-linking is not due to its potential effect on actin polymerization, since pH has little influence on the stable polymerization of actin (Fig. 3). The purified cortactin can be efficiently phosphorylated by pp60c-src exclusively at tyrosine residues in a manner depending on time and the amount of Src. By incubating cortactin with 500 nm pp60c-src at room temperature for 1 h, a maximum phosphorylation of cortactin was reached (Fig. 4 A). When the phosphorylated cortactin was used in the co-sedimentation assay, a dramatic inhibition for the F-actin cross-linking was observed (Fig. 4 B). The treatment of cortactin with 62.5 nmpp60c-src reduced the efficiency of F-actin sedimentation from near 60% to approximately 38%, and that with 500 nm pp60c-src reduced further the sedimentation of F-actin to 10%. In a control experiment where cortactin was treated with the buffer only but in the absence of pp60c-src, no reduction of the F-actin cross-linking was detected (Fig. 4 B). The apparent decrease in the F-actin cross-linking was not due to a possible inhibitory activity of pp60c-src, since a solution in the presence of pp60c-src itself did not have any detectable effect on F-actin cross-linking (data not shown). Furthermore, we examined whether tyrosine phosphorylation is essential for the inhibition of cortactin's F-actin cross-linking activity. We carried out the phosphorylation of cortactin in a kinase buffer in the absence of Mg2+, on which the kinase activity of pp60c-src is dependent (21Richert N.D. Blithe D.L. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7143-7150Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5 A, the Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin was abolished in the absence of Mg2+. When the Src-treated cortactin in the absence of Mg2+ was mixed with F-actin and subsequently subjected to the co-sedimentation analysis, a significant amount of F-actin was detected in the pellet (Fig.5 B, column 4). Although the level of sedimentation of F-actin induced by cortactin and pp60c-src in the absence of Mg2+ was about 33% lower than that by non-Src-treated cortactin (Fig.5 B, compare columns 2 and 4), the lower efficiency could be the result of a trace amount of Mg2+ present in the F-actin buffer, which may have partially restored the kinase activity of pp60c-src. Indeed, when Src-treated cortactin in the absence of Mg2+ was further incubated with F-actin, cortactin was able to be phosphorylated to the extent of approximately 25% of that in the regular kinase buffer (Fig. 5 A,column 4). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the inhibition of the F-actin cross-linking activity of cortactin by pp60c-src is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation. Cortactin has been previously described as a potent F-actin-binding protein (14Wu H. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Google Scholar). Therefore, we also examined the effect of pp60c-src on its F-actin binding activity by co-sedimentation at a high centrifugation force of 366,000 ×g, at which actin filaments are able to be precipitated. As shown in Fig. 6, the Src treatment resulted in an inhibition of the F-actin binding activity of cortactin. However, the efficiency of the inhibition is apparently less than that for the F-actin cross-linking. At the concentration of 62.5 nmpp60c-src, the co-precipitated cortactin with F-actin was reduced only from 95 to 85%; at 500 nmpp60c-src, 42% of cortactin was still bound to F-actin. The moderate inhibition by pp60c-srcmay be due to the existence of multiple F-actin binding sites in cortactin, which are involved in the F-actin cross-linking activity (30Matsudaira P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 87-92Google Scholar). The lower sensitivity to pp60c-src could also be the reason for a failure to observe the inhibition of the F-actin binding activity of cortactin in a system using lysates from v-Src-transformed cells (14Wu H. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Google Scholar). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that different phosphorylation sites or additional kinase(s) may be involved in that system. The dependence on neutral pH for the optimal cross-linking activity of cortactin is uncommon. For example, α-actinin has the highest cross-linking activity at pH 6.8 (22Condeelis J. Vahey M. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 466-471Google Scholar). Talin shows a reduced actin cross-linking activity when pH is increased from 6.5 to 7.3, whereas its optimal activity is at pH 6.5 (23Zhang J. Robson R.M. Schmidt J.M. Stromer M.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 530-537Google Scholar). EF1α has high F-actin-cross-linking activity at low pH (6.2–6.5) (24Edmonds B.T. Murray J. Condeelis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15222-15230Google Scholar). It has been well recognized that pH is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (24Edmonds B.T. Murray J. Condeelis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15222-15230Google Scholar) and cell motility (25Simchowitz L. Cragoe Jr., E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6492-6500Google Scholar, 26Duijn B.V. Inouye K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4951-4955Google Scholar). A recent study also indicates that the induction of Rho on stress actin filaments is dependent on Na+/H+ exchange (27Vexler Z.S. Symons M. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22281-22284Google Scholar). Since both intracellular pH and tyrosine kinase activities are regulated by a variety of extracellular signals (28Grinstein S. Rotin D. Mason M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 73-97Google Scholar, 29Erpel T. Courtneidge S.A. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1995; 7: 176-182Google Scholar), cortactin could act as an important mediator for ligands to regulate the cytoskeleton reorganization.

https://openalex.org/W2060080779,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene NDJ1 (nondisjunction) encodes a protein that accumulates at telomeres during meiotic prophase. Deletion of NDJ1 ( ndj1Δ ) caused nondisjunction, impaired distributive segregation of linear chromosomes, and disordered the distribution of telomeric Rap1p, but it did not affect distributive segregation of circular plasmids. Induction of meiotic recombination and the extent of crossing-over were largely normal in ndj1Δ cells, but formation of axial elements and synapsis were delayed. Thus, Ndj1p may stabilize homologous DNA interactions at telomeres, and possibly at other sites, and it is required for a telomere activity in distributive segregation."
https://openalex.org/W1968451768,"As proteins are integrated into the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, some hydrophilic polypeptide segments are transported through the translocation channel, others remain in the cytosol, and hydrophobic transmembrane sequences are released into the lipid phase. We have addressed the molecular mechanism by which these events occur. We demonstrate that both the lumenal and the cytosolic domains of a membrane protein are synthesized while the ribosome is membrane bound, so that even cytosolic domains come in contact with the translocation channel. We also find that, before translation of the protein is terminated, transmembrane sequences can laterally exit the translocation channel and enter the lipid environment. These results have significant implications for the folding and assembly of membrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2124017621,"Trypanosomatid protozoans depend upon exogenous sources of pteridines (pterins or folates) for growth. A broad spectrum pteridine reductase (PTR1) was recently identified in Leishmania major, whose sequence places it in the short chain alcohol dehydrogenase protein family although its enzymatic activities resemble dihydrofolate reductases. The properties of PTR1 suggested a role in essential pteridine salvage as well as in antifolate resistance. To prove this, we have characterized further the properties and relative roles of PTR1 and dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase inLeishmania pteridine metabolism, using purified enzymes and knockout mutants. Recombinant L. major and Leishmania tarentolae, and native L. major PTR1s, were tetramers of 30-kDa subunits and showed similar catalytic properties with pterins and folates (pH dependence, substrate inhibition with H2pteridines). Unlike PTR1, dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase showed weak activity with folate and no activity with pterins. Correspondingly, studies ofptr1 − and dhfr-ts −mutants implicated only PTR1 in the ability of L.major to grow on a wide array of pterins. PTR1 exhibited 2000-fold less sensitivity to inhibition by methotrexate than dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase, suggesting several mechanisms by which PTR1 may compromise antifolate inhibition in wild-type Leishmania and lines bearing PTR1amplifications. We incorporate these results into a comprehensive model of pteridine metabolism and discuss its implications in chemotherapy of this important human pathogen.

We incorporate these results into a comprehensive model of pteridine metabolism and discuss its implications in chemotherapy of this important human pathogen. Leishmania are trypanosomatid protozoan parasites that infect millions of people worldwide (1Report of a WHO Expert Committee (1984) The Leishmaniasis, WHO Technical Report, Series 701, pp. 3–140..Google Scholar). Leishmaniasis takes several forms, ranging from minor or severe disfiguring cutaneous lesions to the deadly visceral form, depending upon the species and immune status of the host. Vaccines against Leishmania are not yet available, and treatment currently relies on the antiquated pentavalent antimonial compounds. These drugs are often toxic, sometimes ineffective, and their mode of action remains unknown. A better understanding of novel biochemical pathways of this primitive eukaryotic parasite clearly would be helpful in the development of selective anti-Leishmania drugs. For example, although antifolates are a mainstay in the treatment of parasitic diseases such as malaria, they have not proven clinically effective againstLeishmania (2Scott D.A. Coombs G.H. Sanderson B.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 23: 139-149Google Scholar, 3Berman J.D. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1988; 10: 560-586Google Scholar). This may reflect the fact thatLeishmania and related trypanosomatids exhibit a number of unusual features in pteridine (pterin and folate) metabolism. Improved knowledge of this pathway would likely allow the development of antifolates effective against this important disease. Leishmania and other trypanosomatids includingCrithidia are unable to synthesize the pterin moiety from GTP and thus must acquire pteridines from the host by salvage mechanisms (2Scott D.A. Coombs G.H. Sanderson B.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 23: 139-149Google Scholar, 4Nathan H.A. Hutner S.H. Levin H.L. Nature. 1956; 178: 741-743Google Scholar, 5Trager W. J.

Mourad W. Leblanc E. Ouellette M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7310-7315Google Scholar). This feature led historically to an appreciation of the pterin requirement of eukaryotes, where pterins are now known to participate as essential cofactors in hydroxylations, ether-lipid cleavage, and NO synthase (12Benkovic S.J Blakley R Folates and Pterins. 2. John Wiley and Sons, Inc.,, New York1985: 1-399Google Scholar, 13Tietz A. Lindberg M. Kennedy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 4081-4090Google Scholar, 14Tayeh M.A. Marletta M.A. J. Biol.

However, the pathways involved in the salvage and metabolism of pterins, and their function inLeishmania, are only beginning to emerge (9Beck J.T. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 49: 21-28Google Scholar, 10Bello A.R. Nare B. Freedman D. Hardy L. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11442-11446Google Scholar). Recently, we identified a novel pteridine reductase (PTR1) 1The abbreviations used are: PTR1, pteridine reductase 1; MTX, methotrexate; DHFR-TS, dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase; H2biopterin, dihydrobiopterin; H4biopterin, tetrahydrobiopterin; H2folate, dihydrofolate; H4folate, tetrahydrofolate; Mes, 4 morpholinethanesulfonic acid; DHPR, dihydropteridine reductase. in Leishmania (10Bello A.R. Nare B. Freedman D. Hardy L. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11442-11446Google Scholar).PTR1 (formerly hmtx r or ltdh) was originally identified as the gene responsible for methotrexate (MTX) resistance on the amplified H region in several species ofLeishmania (16Callahan H.L. Beverley S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24165-24168Google Scholar, 17Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3601-3608Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons placed the predicted PTR1 protein in a large family of aldo-keto reductases and short chain dehydrogenases, a family including both dihydropteridine and sepiapterin reductases (16Callahan H.L. Beverley S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24165-24168Google Scholar, 17Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3601-3608Google Scholar, 18Krozowski Z. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 51: 125-130Google Scholar, 19Whiteley J.M. Xuong N.H. Varughese K.I. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1993; 338: 115-121Google Scholar). The ability of PTR1 to reduce pteridines such as biopterin and folate was established by genetic and biochemical approaches in our laboratory (10Bello A.R. Nare B. Freedman D. Hardy L. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11442-11446Google Scholar). First, ptr1 − null mutants specifically required H2- or H4biopterin for growth, a requirement not satisfied by H2- or H4folate. Second, partially purified recombinant PTR1 protein exhibited NADPH-dependent reductase activity with biopterin and folate and lesser activity with H2biopterin or H2folate (10Bello A.R. Nare B. Freedman D. Hardy L. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11442-11446Google Scholar). These properties placed PTR1 in a position to play a key role in the salvage of oxidized pterins. Moreover, the H2folate reductase activity of PTR1, when combined with its relative insensitivity to MTX inhibition (100 nm versus 0.1 nm for DHFR-TS; Ref. 20Meek T.D. Garvey E.P. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 678-686Google Scholar), suggested that PTR1 could compromise antifolate inhibition ofLeishmania (10Bello A.R. Nare B. Freedman D. Hardy L. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11442-11446Google Scholar). Despite the homology of PTR1 to the short chain alcohol dehydrogenase superfamily (16Callahan H.L. Beverley S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24165-24168Google Scholar, 17Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3601-3608Google Scholar, 18Krozowski Z. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 51: 125-130Google Scholar), its enzymatic properties overlap those of many dihydrofolate reductases (DHFR), which is remarkable given their evolutionary divergence. The major role of DHFR is to convert H2folate to the biochemically active H4folate, a step needed for de novo synthesis of thymidylate, and in bacteria and higher eukaryotes, purine nucleotides (trypanosomatids are auxotrophic for purines). In Leishmania as well as all protozoans and plant species examined thus far, DHFR is part of a bifunctional polypeptide that also encodes thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS; Refs. 21Garrett C.E. Coderre J.A. Meek T.D. Garvey E.P. Claman D.M. Beverley S.M. Santi D.V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1984; 11: 257-265Google Scholar, 22Beverley S.M. Ellenberger T.E. Cordingley J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2584-2588Google Scholar, 23Lazar G. Zhang H. Goodman H.M. Plant J. 1993; 3: 657-668Google Scholar). Direct comparison of the enzymatic properties of PTR1 and DHFR-TS would help in the elucidation of the salvage and metabolism of pteridines in Leishmania. Additionally, such information could establish the suitability of PTR1 and/or DHFR-TS as targets for rational Leishmania chemotherapy. Here we have purified both native and recombinant L. majorPTR1s as well as recombinant Leishmania tarentolae PTR1, and have characterized their properties including Km,Vmax, pH dependence, and inhibition by substrate and MTX. Comparisons of the wild-type and ptr1 −and dhfr-ts − knockout Leishmaniashowed that the ability to grow in diverse pterins correlated with their activity with PTR1 but not DHFR-TS, establishing PTR1 as the sole mediator of oxidized pterin salvage. Comparisons of the properties of PTR1 and DHFR-TS enzymes, and pteridine reductase activities in crudeLeishmania extracts (including those fromptr1 − and dhfr-ts −mutants), were used to establish the relative contribution of these enzymes in pteridine metabolism. With this information, we have developed a comprehensive model of the salvage and metabolism of pteridines in Leishmania. All lines of Leishmaniawere derived from L. major strain LT252 clone CC-1 and cultured in M199 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (24Kapler G.M. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1084-1094Google Scholar). In this medium parasites grow as the promastigote form, which normally resides extracellularly within the gut of the sand fly insect vector. Null mutant Leishmania lacking DHFR-TS (dhfr-ts −) or PTR1 (ptr1 −) were created by targeted disruption of both alleles of each gene (10Bello A.R. Nare B. Freedman D. Hardy L. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11442-11446Google Scholar, 25Cruz A. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7170-7174Google Scholar). The ptr1 −mutant was grown with H2- or H4biopterin (2–4 μg/ml), and the dhfr-ts − mutant was grown with 10 μg/ml thymidine. The linesptr1 −/+PTR1 anddhfr-ts −/+DHFR-TS represent the respective null mutants transfected with plasmids pX63NEO-PTR1 (10Bello A.R. Nare B. Freedman D. Hardy L. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11442-11446Google Scholar) or pK300 (24Kapler G.M. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1084-1094Google Scholar) and overexpress PTR1 and DHFR-TS, respectively (Ref. 10Bello A.R. Nare B. Freedman D. Hardy L. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11442-11446Google Scholar; this work). In some experiments cells were grown in fdM199, which is M199 medium lacking folate and thymidine and supplemented with 0.66% bovine serum albumin (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) instead of serum. Pterin supplements were H4biopterin (RBI), 6-hydroxymethylpterin, pterin, pteroic acid (Sigma), and a wide range of other pterins (Schircks Laboratories, Jona, Switzerland or from S. Kaufman, National Institutes of Health). H2neopterin was prepared from neopterin by reduction with dithionite in the presence of ascorbate (26Futterman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 228: 1031-1038Google Scholar). Parasites were enumerated using a Coulter Counter (Model Zf) at the time when cultures grown in H4biopterin had reached late log phase. The initial steps of purification of recombinant L. major PTR1 have been described (10Bello A.R. Nare B. Freedman D. Hardy L. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11442-11446Google Scholar) and included expression in Escherichia coliusing the pET-3a expression vector (27Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Google Scholar), induction, cellular lysis, and purification by ammonium sulfate precipitation and DEAE-cellulose chromatography. PTR1-containing fractions from the DEAE step were pooled and the buffer changed to 20 mm Mes, pH 6.0, by passage over PD10 columns of Sephadex G-25 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Subsequent purification steps were carried out by fast protein liquid chromatography (Pharmacia). Protein was applied to an ion exchange Mono-S HR 5/5 column and eluted with a 20-min 0–0.2 m NaCl gradient at 1 ml/min. An ion exchange Mono-Q 5/5 column was also tested and found to give an equivalent purification. PTR1-containing fractions were combined, and the volume reduced to 1 ml using YM10 filters (Amicon). The concentrate was applied to a Superdex 200HR 10/30 column and eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with 20 mm Mes, pH 6.0, containing 0.1 m NaCl. Recombinant PTR1 was purified 10-fold with overall yields of 80%. The coding region for L. tarentolae PTR1 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using Taqpolymerase, template DNA from the MG strain of L. tarentolae, and the primers SMB-8 (5′-ggcagatcTCAGGCCCGGGTAAGGC) and SMB-9 (5′-cgcagatctcccatATGACGACTTCTCCGA; lowercase letters indicate bases not present in PTR1), with 25 amplification cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 57 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C. The expected fragment was obtained, digested with NdeI andBglII, inserted into the pET-3a expression vector (Novagen), and transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3)/pLysS (27Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Google Scholar). The expression of L. tarentolae PTR1 was induced and the enzyme purified as described for L. major. Native PTR1 was purified from 7.5 × 1010 ptr1 −/+PTR1 L. major, in a manner similar to that used for the recombinant enzyme except that the cells were lysed by 3 cycles of freezing and thawing followed by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was loaded onto a DEAE-cellulose column, eluted (10Bello A.R. Nare B. Freedman D. Hardy L. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11442-11446Google Scholar), and further purified as described for the recombinant enzyme. Native PTR1 was purified 200-fold and obtained in 72% yield. Purified PTR1 preparations were stored at −80 °C in the presence of 20% glycerol and 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The molecular weights of nondenatured PTR1s were estimated on a Sephacryl S-200 column (120 × 0.8 cm) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Three different pH values were tested using the following buffers: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 20 mm NaPO4, pH 6.0, or 20 mmsodium acetate, pH 4.7, each containing 0.1 m NaCl. Molecular mass markers were β-amylase (200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa). Fractions were monitored at 280 nm and for PTR1 activity. Spectrophotometric pteridine reductase assays were performed at 30 °C in the presence of NADPH (usually 100 μm) and pteridines as indicated (10Bello A.R. Nare B. Freedman D. Hardy L. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11442-11446Google Scholar). The pH dependence of PTR1 activity was determined using three overlapping buffers: 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 3.6–6.0, NaPO4, pH 5.5–7.5, or Tris-HCl, pH 7.0–8.0. Radiometric assays of folate and/or H2folate reductase activities (28Rothenberg S.P. Iqbal M.P. Da Costa M. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 103: 152-156Google Scholar) were performed using 40 μm [3′,4′,7,9-3H]folate (24.1 Ci/mmol, Moravek Biochemicals), which was purified prior to use (29Ellenberger T.E. Beverley S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10053-10058Google Scholar). To test the nature of the product formed from reduction of biopterin or H2biopterin by PTR1 or DHFR-TS, a coupled assay was used (30Guroff G. Rhoads C.A. Abramowitz A. Anal. Biochem. 1967; 21: 8-273Google Scholar) where the synthesis of H4biopterin is linked to the hydroxylation of [4-3H]Phe (27 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.) by mammalian phenylalanine hydroxylase (Sigma). After incubation for 30 min at 25 °C, the [3H]Tyr formed was iodinated, the sample was passed over a Dowex 50 column, and the tritiated water was quantified by scintillation counting. The kinetic parameters Km and Vmax for the pteridine substrates were measured in a spectrophotometric assay with 100 μm NADPH as described previously (10Bello A.R. Nare B. Freedman D. Hardy L. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11442-11446Google Scholar). Extinction coefficients used for various pteridines were determined spectrophotometrically, and PTR1 activity was calculated based on the decrease in absorbance of both NADPH and the pteridine substrates. Kinetic data for oxidized pteridines were evaluated by fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear regression (Hyper Version 1.02A; J.S. Eastby, Liverpool, UK). Both H2folate and H2biopterin showed substrate inhibition at concentrations above 5 and 10 μm, respectively, and for these,Km, Vmax, andKi (for substrate) values were evaluated using graphical plots and the general equation for substrate inhibition (31Cleland W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 501-513Google Scholar). For inhibition studies, PTR1 was incubated with MTX and NADPH and the reaction initiated with the pteridine substrate (40 μmfolate, 100 μm biopterin, 10 μmH2biopterin, or 5 μm H2folate). Inhibition was examined at several concentrations of enzyme, and the data were analyzed using a method for tight binding inhibitors to obtain Ki (32Cha S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1975; 24: 2177-2185Google Scholar). Recombinant DHFR-TS fromL. major was purified from adhfr − E. coli strain (33Howell E.E. Foster P.G. Foster L.M. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3040-3045Google Scholar) bearing the expression plasmid 02CLSA-4 (34Knighton D.R. Kan C.C. Howland E. Janson C.A. Hostomska Z. Welsh K.M. Matthews D.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 186-194Google Scholar). Cells were lysed by two cycles through a French press (15,000 p.s.i.), and DHFR-TS was purified by binding and elution from a MTX-Sepharose column (Sigma) (34Knighton D.R. Kan C.C. Howland E. Janson C.A. Hostomska Z. Welsh K.M. Matthews D.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 186-194Google Scholar, 35Coderre J.A. Beverley S.M. Schimke R.T. Santi D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2132-2136Google Scholar). The eluate was concentrated using YM10 membrane filters (Amicon) and loaded onto a Sephacryl S-200 column (120 × 0.8 cm). Electrophoretically homogeneous enzyme was eluted with 50 mm Tris·HCl, 0.1m NaCl at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, desalted over PD10 columns of Sephadex G-25 (Pharmacia), and stored at −80 °C in the presence of 10% glycerol. Polyclonal antiserum against PTR1 was elicited in New Zealand White rabbits using 200 μg of L. major PTR1 in Freund's complete adjuvant (Sigma) in the primary immunization. The rabbits were boosted 5 times with 100 μg PTR1 each in incomplete Freund's adjuvant at 3-week intervals, and serum was obtained after the last bleeding. For immunoblots, purified PTR1 and crude Leishmania extracts were separated on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) and electrophoretically transferred onto Millipore polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (37Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar) using a semi-dry blot apparatus (Owl Scientific). Blots were incubated with antiserum to PTR1 (1:1000), and binding was detected using either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:3000) and chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.) or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody and developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium. Late logarithmic phase promastigotes were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mmKCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.8 mm KH2PO4), and resuspended (3 × 109/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mm EDTA and a mixture of protease inhibitors suggested by Meek et al.

Cells were lysed by freeze thawing and sonication and the extracts clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min. Previously we reported upon the partial purification of L. major PTR1, expressed in engineeredE. coli (10Bello A.R. Nare B. Freedman D. Hardy L. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11442-11446Google Scholar). Inclusion of two additional steps (ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography) yielded preparations that were electrophoretically homogeneous, even when the gel was overloaded (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3–5). We also overexpressed and purified native PTR1 from L. major parasites and recombinant L. tarentolae PTR1. The recombinant and native PTR1s behaved similarly during purification and exhibited similar mobilities upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1 A, lanes 5–7). The apparent subunit molecular masses were 30 kDa (10Bello A.R. Nare B. Freedman D. Hardy L. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11442-11446Google Scholar, 11Papadopoulou B.

Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3601-3608Google Scholar). Western blot analysis with a polyclonal antiserum to recombinantL. major PTR1 detected a 30-kDa protein in wild-typeL. major extracts whose size was identical to that of purified PTR1s (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2–4). This protein was absent in the ptr1 − L. majordeletion mutant obtained previously by gene targeting (Fig. 1 B, lane 1) (10Bello A.R. Nare B. Freedman D. Hardy L. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11442-11446Google Scholar) and was expressed at approximately 100-fold higher levels in the L.major line overexpressing PTR1 (Fig.1 B, lane 3; note that 100-fold less protein was loaded inlane 3). In wild-type cells, PTR1 constituted about 0.01% of the total cellular protein. By gel filtration chromatography, the apparent molecular mass of PTR1 was estimated to be 116 and 117 kDa for the recombinant and nativeL. major enzymes, respectively (not shown). Similar values were obtained at pH values of 4.7, 6.0, and 7.0 (data not shown). We infer that PTR1 is a tetramer of identical 30-kDa subunits and that significant alterations in molecular shape are not associated with differences in the pH dependence of folate versus biopterin reduction (below). Previous studies of partially purified PTR1 showed it to have two pH optima, one of about 4.7 for biopterin and H2biopterin and one of about 6.0 for folate and H2folate (10Bello A.R. Nare B. Freedman D. Hardy L. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11442-11446Google Scholar). Studies of the homogeneous L. major and purified L. tarentolae PTR1s have refined and extended these initial findings. At the optimum pH for each substrate, PTR1 activity with oxidized biopterin and folate exhibited standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Fig.2). However, H2biopterin and H2folate showed substrate inhibition at concentrations above 10 and 5 μm, respectively (Fig. 2).Vmax values with H2biopterin and H2folate were derived from analyses that included considerations of substrate inhibition (31Cleland W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 501-513Google Scholar) and yielded values that were at least 50% that of the corresponding oxidized pteridines (TableI). Previously, only substrate concentrations of 100 μm were tested (10Bello A.R. Nare B. Freedman D. Hardy L. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11442-11446Google Scholar), which led to a 3–4-fold underestimate of the rate of reduction of H2pteridines by PTR1. H2neopterin and H2sepiapterin also showed substrate inhibition, whereas l- andd-biopterin, l- and d-neopterin, 6-hydroxymethylpterin, l- andd-monapterin, 6-formylpterin, and 6,7-dimethylpterin showed standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics (data not shown). This suggests that substrate inhibition was a general feature of PTR1 activity, but only with H2pteridines.Table IKinetic parameters for Leishmania PTR1sPteridine substratepH1-aKinetic parameters were determined in 20 mm each of sodium acetate, pH 4.7, or sodium phosphate, pH 6.0 or 7.0 (as appropriate substrates were fixed at 100 μm NADPH; 100 μm biopterin; 40 μm H2folate; 10 μmH2biopterin; 5 μm H4folate).Km(pteridine)Km(NADPH)Ki1-bKi for pteridine substrates that exhibit inhibition of enzymatic activity.(pteridine)VmaxKi (MTX)μ mμ mμ mμmol/min/mgnmRecombinant L. major PTR1Biopterin4.7*12.2 ± 1.613.2 ± 0.6NI1-cNI − PTR1 activity is not inhibited by substrate at maximum concentrations used for kinetic analysis (40–100 μm). * indicates optimum pH for each substrate.

https://openalex.org/W2113471132,"Treatment of Chinese hamster ovary cells with the vacuolar proton pump inhibitor bafilomycin A1 causes a 2-fold retardation in the rate of recycling of transfected human transferrin receptors back to the cell surface as measured using biochemical assays (Johnson, L. S., Dunn, K. W., Pytowski, B., and McGraw, T. E. (1993) Mol. Biol. Cell 4, 1251–1266). We have used quantitative fluorescence microscopy to determine which step(s) in the endocytic recycling pathway are affected. We show that removal of transferrin from sorting endosomes and accumulation in the peri-centriolar endocytic recycling compartment takes place normally in bafilomycin A1-treated cells. However, the rate constant for exit of transferrin receptors from recycling endosomes (ke) is reduced from 0.063 min−1 in untreated cells to 0.034 min−1 in the presence of bafilomycin A1. This retardation appears to be dependent on the presence of internalization motifs in the cytoplasmic domain since modified receptors lacking these oligopeptide motifs do not show as large a decrease in recycling rate in the presence of bafilomycin A1. Bulk membrane recycling (measured by efflux of an internalized fluorescent lipid analog, 6-[N-[7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl]-amino]hexoyl-sphingosylphosphorylcholine) is slowed from an exit rate constant of 0.060 min−1without drug to 0.046 min−1 in the presence of bafilomycin A1. We conclude that bafilomycin A1 slows bulk membrane flow, but it causes additional inhibition of receptor recycling in a manner that is dependent on a peptide motif on the cytoplasmic domain.

After internalization via clathrin-coated pits, endocytosed material rapidly enters sorting endosomes, organelles that sort recycled molecules such as transferrin (Tf) 1The abbreviations used are: Tf, transferrin; Tf-R, transferrin receptor; Tx-Tf, Texas Red-labeled transferrin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; C6-NBD-SM, 6-[N-[7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl]-amino]hexoyl-sphingosylphosphorylcholine; CCD, charge-coupled device; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; F-R-Tf, fluorescein-rhodamine transferrin; NA, numerical aperture; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: Tf, transferrin; Tf-R, transferrin receptor; Tx-Tf, Texas Red-labeled transferrin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; C6-NBD-SM, 6-[N-[7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl]-amino]hexoyl-sphingosylphosphorylcholine; CCD, charge-coupled device; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; F-R-Tf, fluorescein-rhodamine transferrin; NA, numerical aperture; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. bound to the transferrin receptor (Tf-R) from lysosomally destined molecules such as low density lipoprotein (1Dunn K.W.

Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1257-1269Google Scholar). We have provided evidence for a sorting mechanism in which components not carrying special retention or targeting signals are removed from the sorting endosome by a default process based on the geometry of the sorting endosome and an iterative fractionation mechanism (1Dunn K.W. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3303-3314Google Scholar, 3Mayor S. Presley J.F. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1257-1269Google Scholar). Most of the fluid brought into the tubulo-vesicular sorting endosome fills a spherical lumen, whereas most of the surface area is on tubular extensions that are involved in the removal of membrane components from the sorting endosome for export along the recycling pathway (1Dunn K.W. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3303-3314Google Scholar, 2Geuze H.J. Slot J.W. Strous J.A.M. Lodish H.F. Schwartz A.L. Cell. 1983; 32: 277-287Google Scholar, 3Mayor S. Presley J.F. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1257-1269Google Scholar). Tf remains attached to its receptor throughout the recycling pathway, but it is converted to apo-Tf by the low pH of endosomes (4Dautry-Varsat A. Ciechanover A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2258-2262Google Scholar, 5Klausner R.D. Ashwell G. van Renswoude J. Harford J. Bridges K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2263-2266Google Scholar). Occupied Tf-R are transported from sorting endosomes to the endocytic recycling compartment, which in CHO cells is a collection of tubules concentrated near the centriole (6Yamashiro D.J. Tycko B. Fluss S.R. Maxfield F.R. Cell. 1984; 37: 789-800Google Scholar). The Tf-R are returned to the cell surface from the endocytic recycling compartment, and apo-Tf dissociates from the receptor upon return to the surface (5Klausner R.D. Ashwell G. van Renswoude J. Harford J. Bridges K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2263-2266Google Scholar). It has been shown that internalized lipid analogs such as 6-[N-[7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl]-amino]hexoyl-sphingosylphosphorylcholine (C6-NBD-SM) follow the same endocytic recycling pathway as Tf, indicating that in the absence of specialized signals membrane molecules will recycle efficiently from endosomes to the cell surface (3Mayor S. Presley J.F. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1257-1269Google Scholar). Endocytosed fluid and ligands released from their receptors by low endosomal pH are retained in the lumen of the sorting endosome and accumulate. The vesicular portions of the sorting endosomes become the vesicles that fuse with late endosomes (7Gruenberg J. Griffiths G. Howell K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1301-1316Google Scholar, 8Dunn K.W. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 301-310Google Scholar, 9Gruenberg J. Maxfield F.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 552-563Google Scholar).Acidification of endosomes by ATP-dependent proton pumps is important for several aspects of endocytic trafficking. Two well established functions of the low pH of endosomes are to dissociate lysosomally destined ligands from membrane-associated receptors and to strip Fe3+ from transferrin (4Dautry-Varsat A. Ciechanover A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2258-2262Google Scholar, 5Klausner R.D. Ashwell G. van Renswoude J. Harford J. Bridges K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Two additional roles for endosome acidification have been proposed based on studies of drug-treated cells or mutant cell lines, but these are not well understood at present. Inhibition of endosome acidification has been associated with slowed endocytic recycling and intracellular retention of recycling receptors (12Klausner R.D. Van Renswoude J. Ashwell G. Kempf C. Schechter A.N. Dean A. Bridges K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4715-4724Google Scholar, 13Klausner R.D. van Renswoude J. Kempf C. Rao K. Bateman J.L. Robbins A.R. J.

In addition, the delivery of endocytosed molecules to late endosomes or lysosomes is affected by treatments that impair acidification (15Clague M.J. Urbe S. Aniento F. Gruenberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21-24Google Scholar, 16van Weert A.W.M. Dunn K.W. Geuze H.J. Maxfield F.R. Stoorvogel W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 821-834Google Scholar). Unfortunately, both of these effects appear to vary among cell lines.Several studies have shown that weak bases and ionophores that collapse transmembrane pH gradients can reduce the fraction of recycling receptors that are expressed on the cell (17Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. Cell. 1981; 24: 493-502Google Scholar, 18Schwartz A.L. Bolognesi A. Fridovich S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 732-738Google Scholar, 19Tietze C. Schlesinger P. Stahl P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 93: 1-8Google Scholar, 20Tycko B. Keith C.H. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1762-1776Google Scholar). However, the degree of inhibition of receptor trafficking varies greatly from study to study. Since weak bases and ionophores have multiple effects, including osmotic effects on organelles, interpretation of these experiments has not been straightforward (21Tartakoff A.M. Cell. 1983; 32: 1026-1028Google Scholar).In 12-4 cells, a CHO mutant line in the end2 complementation group that has partially defective acidification of endosomes, Tf exits the sorting endosome at a normal rate, but it exits the recycling compartment more slowly than in the parental cells (22Presley J.F. Mayor S. Dunn K.W. Johnson L.S. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1231-1241Google Scholar). However, the rate of bulk membrane recycling, measured by the release of internalized C6-NBD-SM from the cells, is identical to the rate in the parental cells, suggesting that Tf is retained in the recycling compartment by a specific retention mechanism.Recently, it was shown that the proton pump inhibitor bafilomycin A1 raised the pH of sorting and recycling endosomes and slowed recycling of the Tf-R in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line transfected with the human Tf-R (TRVb-1) (14Johnson L.S. Dunn K.W. Pytowski B. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1251-1266Google Scholar). Internalization of the Tf-R was not affected, but externalization was slowed 2-fold, leading to a net intracellular accumulation of Tf-R.The effects of bafilomycin A1 on delivery of molecules to late endosomes and lysosomes have also been investigated (15Clague M.J. Urbe S. Aniento F. Gruenberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21-24Google Scholar, 16van Weert A.W.M. Dunn K.W. Geuze H.J. Maxfield F.R. Stoorvogel W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 821-834Google Scholar). In a study of BHK cells it was found that delivery to late endosomes was blocked by treatment with bafilomycin A1, and in cell homogenates formation of multivesicular body/endosomal carrier vesicles was inhibited by bafilomycin A1 (15Clague M.J. Urbe S. Aniento F. Gruenberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21-24Google Scholar). These multivesicular body/endosomal carrier vesicles are the intermediates between early sorting endosomes and late endosomes (9Gruenberg J. Maxfield F.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 552-563Google Scholar). In contrast, in HepG2 cells, delivery to late endosomes was slowed somewhat, but delivery to lysosomes was nearly completely blocked (16van Weert A.W.M. Dunn K.W. Geuze H.J. Maxfield F.R. Stoorvogel W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 821-834Google Scholar). Neither the basis for these differences nor the molecular role of endosome acidification in these processes is known. These discrepancies illustrate that even the organelles where bafilomycin A1 exerts its effects are not well understood.In this paper, we examine the effects of bafilomycin A1 on bulk membrane traffic and on normal and mutant Tf-R recycling in wild-type and TRVb-1 cells. Using digital fluorescence microscopy we find that in bafilomycin A1-treated cells, Tf-R leaves sorting endosomes with normal kinetics, but its exit from the recycling compartment is slowed similar to the observations in 12-4 cells (22Presley J.F. Mayor S. Dunn K.W. Johnson L.S. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1231-1241Google Scholar). However, we also find that bafilomycin A1 treatment causes bulk membrane recycling to be significantly slowed. The slowing of membrane recycling accounts for about one-third of the reduction in the rate of Tf-R recycling. After internalization via clathrin-coated pits, endocytosed material rapidly enters sorting endosomes, organelles that sort recycled molecules such as transferrin (Tf) 1The abbreviations used are: Tf, transferrin; Tf-R, transferrin receptor; Tx-Tf, Texas Red-labeled transferrin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; C6-NBD-SM, 6-[N-[7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl]-amino]hexoyl-sphingosylphosphorylcholine; CCD, charge-coupled device; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; F-R-Tf, fluorescein-rhodamine transferrin; NA, numerical aperture; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: Tf, transferrin; Tf-R, transferrin receptor; Tx-Tf, Texas Red-labeled transferrin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; C6-NBD-SM, 6-[N-[7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl]-amino]hexoyl-sphingosylphosphorylcholine; CCD, charge-coupled device; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; F-R-Tf, fluorescein-rhodamine transferrin; NA, numerical aperture; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. bound to the transferrin receptor (Tf-R) from lysosomally destined molecules such as low density lipoprotein (1Dunn K.W.

It has been shown that internalized lipid analogs such as 6-[N-[7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl]-amino]hexoyl-sphingosylphosphorylcholine (C6-NBD-SM) follow the same endocytic recycling pathway as Tf, indicating that in the absence of specialized signals membrane molecules will recycle efficiently from endosomes to the cell surface (3Mayor S. Presley J.F. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1257-1269Google Scholar). Endocytosed fluid and ligands released from their receptors by low endosomal pH are retained in the lumen of the sorting endosome and accumulate. The vesicular portions of the sorting endosomes become the vesicles that fuse with late endosomes (7Gruenberg J. Griffiths G. Howell K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1301-1316Google Scholar, 8Dunn K.W. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 301-310Google Scholar, 9Gruenberg J. Maxfield F.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 552-563Google Scholar). Acidification of endosomes by ATP-dependent proton pumps is important for several aspects of endocytic trafficking. Two well established functions of the low pH of endosomes are to dissociate lysosomally destined ligands from membrane-associated receptors and to strip Fe3+ from transferrin (4Dautry-Varsat A. Ciechanover A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2258-2262Google Scholar, 5Klausner R.D. Ashwell G. van Renswoude J. Harford J. Bridges K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2263-2266Google Scholar, 10Tycko B. Maxfield F.R. Cell. 1982; 28: 643-651Google Scholar, 11Yamashiro D.J. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 26: 231-246Google Scholar). Two additional roles for endosome acidification have been proposed based on studies of drug-treated cells or mutant cell lines, but these are not well understood at present. Inhibition of endosome acidification has been associated with slowed endocytic recycling and intracellular retention of recycling receptors (12Klausner R.D. Van Renswoude J. Ashwell G. Kempf C. Schechter A.N. Dean A. Bridges K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4715-4724Google Scholar, 13Klausner R.D. van Renswoude J. Kempf C. Rao K. Bateman J.L. Robbins A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1098-1101Google Scholar, 14Johnson L.S. Dunn K.W. Pytowski B. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1251-1266Google Scholar). In addition, the delivery of endocytosed molecules to late endosomes or lysosomes is affected by treatments that impair acidification (15Clague M.J. Urbe S. Aniento F. Gruenberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21-24Google Scholar, 16van Weert A.W.M. Dunn K.W. Geuze H.J. Maxfield F.R. Stoorvogel W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 821-834Google Scholar). Unfortunately, both of these effects appear to vary among cell lines. Several studies have shown that weak bases and ionophores that collapse transmembrane pH gradients can reduce the fraction of recycling receptors that are expressed on the cell (17Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. Cell. 1981; 24: 493-502Google Scholar, 18Schwartz A.L. Bolognesi A. Fridovich S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 732-738Google Scholar, 19Tietze C. Schlesinger P. Stahl P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 93: 1-8Google Scholar, 20Tycko B. Keith C.H. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1762-1776Google Scholar). However, the degree of inhibition of receptor trafficking varies greatly from study to study. Since weak bases and ionophores have multiple effects, including osmotic effects on organelles, interpretation of these experiments has not been straightforward (21Tartakoff A.M. Cell. 1983; 32: 1026-1028Google Scholar). In 12-4 cells, a CHO mutant line in the end2 complementation group that has partially defective acidification of endosomes, Tf exits the sorting endosome at a normal rate, but it exits the recycling compartment more slowly than in the parental cells (22Presley J.F. Mayor S. Dunn K.W. Johnson L.S. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1231-1241Google Scholar). However, the rate of bulk membrane recycling, measured by the release of internalized C6-NBD-SM from the cells, is identical to the rate in the parental cells, suggesting that Tf is retained in the recycling compartment by a specific retention mechanism. Recently, it was shown that the proton pump inhibitor bafilomycin A1 raised the pH of sorting and recycling endosomes and slowed recycling of the Tf-R in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line transfected with the human Tf-R (TRVb-1) (14Johnson L.S. Dunn K.W. Pytowski B. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1251-1266Google Scholar). Internalization of the Tf-R was not affected, but externalization was slowed 2-fold, leading to a net intracellular accumulation of Tf-R. The effects of bafilomycin A1 on delivery of molecules to late endosomes and lysosomes have also been investigated (15Clague M.J. Urbe S. Aniento F. Gruenberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21-24Google Scholar, 16van Weert A.W.M. Dunn K.W. Geuze H.J. Maxfield F.R. Stoorvogel W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 821-834Google Scholar). In a study of BHK cells it was found that delivery to late endosomes was blocked by treatment with bafilomycin A1, and in cell homogenates formation of multivesicular body/endosomal carrier vesicles was inhibited by bafilomycin A1 (15Clague M.J. Urbe S. Aniento F. Gruenberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21-24Google Scholar). These multivesicular body/endosomal carrier vesicles are the intermediates between early sorting endosomes and late endosomes (9Gruenberg J. Maxfield F.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 552-563Google Scholar). In contrast, in HepG2 cells, delivery to late endosomes was slowed somewhat, but delivery to lysosomes was nearly completely blocked (16van Weert A.W.M. Dunn K.W. Geuze H.J. Maxfield F.R. Stoorvogel W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 821-834Google Scholar). Neither the basis for these differences nor the molecular role of endosome acidification in these processes is known. These discrepancies illustrate that even the organelles where bafilomycin A1 exerts its effects are not well understood. In this paper, we examine the effects of bafilomycin A1 on bulk membrane traffic and on normal and mutant Tf-R recycling in wild-type and TRVb-1 cells. Using digital fluorescence microscopy we find that in bafilomycin A1-treated cells, Tf-R leaves sorting endosomes with normal kinetics, but its exit from the recycling compartment is slowed similar to the observations in 12-4 cells (22Presley J.F. Mayor S. Dunn K.W. Johnson L.S. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1231-1241Google Scholar). However, we also find that bafilomycin A1 treatment causes bulk membrane recycling to be significantly slowed. The slowing of membrane recycling accounts for about one-third of the reduction in the rate of Tf-R recycling. We thank Richik Ghosh for helpful discussions."

Analysis of the fully extended products of these reactions indicated that both polymerases preferentially incorporate dAMP opposite the natural abasic site and tetrahydrofuran, while DNA templates containing the ring-opened deoxyribitol moiety block translesional synthesis, promoting sequence context-dependent deletions. The frequency of nucleotide insertion opposite the three types of abasic sites follows the order dAMP > dGMP > dCMP > dTMP. The frequency of chain extension was highest when dAMP was positioned opposite a natural abasic site. The frequency of translesional synthesis past abasic sites follows the order tetrahydrofuran > deoxyribose > deoxyribitol. The Klenow fragment promotes blunt end addition of dAMP; this reaction was much less efficient than insertion of dAMP opposite an abasic site. We conclude that the miscoding potential of a natural abasic site in vitro closely resembles that of its tetrahydrofuran analog. Ring-opened abasic sites favor deletions.

This chemical reaction leads to strand scission (5Jones A.S Mian A.M Walker R.T J. Chem. Soc.C. 1968; : 2042-2044Google Scholar); for that reason, structural analogs of deoxyribose have often been used to explore biological properties of abasic sites in DNA (6Sagher D. Strauss B.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2153-2157Google Scholar). The relative frequency of base incorporation opposite abasic sites and of chain extension from the 3′-primer terminus has also been reported (8Randall S.K. Eritja R. Kaplan B.E. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6864-6870Google Scholar, 9Takeshita M. Chang C.-N. Johnson F. Will S. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10171-10179Google Scholar). While natural and synthetic abasic sites are structurally similar, their mutagenic potential has not been compared under the same experimental conditions.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2153-2157Google Scholar) is accompanied by preferential incorporation of dAMP opposite the lesion, a phenomenon known as the “A rule” (16Strauss B. Bioassays. 1991; 13: 79-84Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, the presence of abasic sites in DNA is associated with different mutational spectra. For example, dAMP, dCMP, and dTMP were inserted at similar frequencies opposite a natural abasic site when a plasmid vector containing this lesion was allowed to replicate in simian kidney (COS) cells (17Gentil A.

In another study in COS cells, preferential incorporation of dAMP was observed opposite the tetrahydrofuran moiety, accompanied by a small number of deletions (21Takeshita M. Eisenberg W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1897-1902Google Scholar). In human lymphoblastoid cells, dGMP was incorporated preferentially opposite natural abasic sites (22Klinedinst D.K. Drinkwater N.R. Mol. Carcinog. 1992; 6: 32-42Google Scholar). In AP endonuclease-deficient strains of yeast, the frequency of A:T → C:G events increased (23Kunz B.A. Henson E.S. Roche H. Ramotar D. Nunoshiba T. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8165-8169Google Scholar); in another yeast system, dCMP was predominantly incorporated opposite the lesion (24Gibbs P.E. Lawrence C.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 229-236Google Scholar). In this report, we used a prokaryotic and a eukaryotic DNA polymerase and DNA templates containing a single abasic site to explore the mechanistic basis underlying mutagenesis at abasic sites in DNA. Recently, one of us (S. S.) developed a method by which site-specifically modified oligodeoxynucleotides could be used to quantify all base substitutions and deletions occurring during DNA synthesis in vitro (25Shibutani S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 625-629Google Scholar). Combined with steady-state kinetic analysis (26Mendelman L.V. Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14415-14423Google Scholar, 27Mendelman L.V. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2338-2346Google Scholar), this experimental system is used to compare the miscoding properties of a natural abasic site and its analogs in reactions catalyzed by the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I or by calf thymus DNA polymerase α. Our results indicate that the natural abasic site resembles closely the tetrahydrofuran moiety with respect to its miscoding properties. These lesions, which exist primarily or exclusively in a ring-closed conformation, preferentially incorporate dAMP opposite the lesion. In contrast, deoxyribitol, which serves as a model for the open chain (minor) form of the natural abasic site, blocks DNA synthesis and promotes the sequence-dependent formation of 1- and 2-base deletions.In vitro, both pol α and the Klenow fragment operate according to the tenets of the A rule. Organic chemicals used for the synthesis of oligodeoxynucleotides were supplied by Aldrich. [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity > 6000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Corp. Cloned exo+ (17,400 units/mg) and exo− (21,200 units/mg) Klenow fragments of E. coli polymerase I (1 unit of enzyme catalyzes the incorporation of 1 nmol of total nucleotide into acid-insoluble form in 60 min at 37 °C) and uracil-DNA glycosylase (1 unit/μl) were purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Intact DNA pol I and dNTPs were from Pharmacia; calf thymus DNA pol α (30,000 units/mg) (1 unit of enzyme catalyzes the incorporation of 10 nmol of nucleotide acid-insoluble material in 30 min at 37 °C using poly(dA-dT) as template primer) was from Molecular Biology Resources, Inc.; T4 polynucleotide kinase was from Stratagene; and venom phosphodiesterase I was from Sigma. Acetonitrile, triethylamine, and distilled water, all HPLC-grade, were purchased from Fisher. A Waters 990 HPLC instrument, equipped with a photodiode array detector, was used to separate and analyze modified and unmodified oligodeoxynucleotides. Oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized by solid-state methods using an automated DNA synthesizer. Templates containing a single unmodified dG or tetrahydrofuran (F) residue at position 13 (Sequences 1, 4, 11, and 18 in Table I) were synthesized as described previously (9Takeshita M. Chang C.-N. Johnson F. Will S. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10171-10179Google Scholar). Templates (18-mers) containing a single natural abasic site (Ab) were prepared by incubating 5 μg of an unmodified oligomer containing a single dG (sequence 1 or 11) dissolved in 100 μl of 30 mm HCl at 37 °C for 16 h (28Bailly V. Verly W.G. O'Connor T. Laval J. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 681-689Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness in a vacuum desiccator and subjected to HPLC. The 18-mer containing an Ab site (tR = 20.4 min) was separated from the parent oligomer (tR = 22.1) on a reverse-phase μBondapak C18 column (0.38 × 30 cm; Waters) using a linear gradient of 0.05 m triethylammonium acetate (pH 7.0) containing 10–20% acetonitrile, an elution time of 60 min, and a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min (29Shibutani S. Gentles R. Johnson F. Grollman A.P. Carcinogenesis. 1991; 12: 813-818Google Scholar). Eluate containing the Ab-modified 18-mer was concentrated using a Centricon-3 filter (Amicon, Inc.). The filter was rinsed three times with 1 ml of distilled water at 4 °C. Reduction of the natural Ab site was conducted at room temperature. NaBH4 (0.35 m) dissolved in 0.5 mphosphate buffer was added in three portions over 90 min (30Pierre J. Laval J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10217-10220Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures were concentrated with a Centricon-3 filter and then subjected to HPLC. Oligomers containing the reduced form of the natural abasic site (Re) were isolated as described above. An Ab-modified 24-mer template (Sequence 16) was prepared using uracil-DNA glycosylase. Six μg of a uracil-modified 24-mer (Sequence 17) were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 10 units of uracil glycosylase in a reaction containing 70 mm Hepes, 50 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (pH 7.4). The Ab-modified 24-mer (tR = 22.1 min) was resolved from the parent uracil-modified 24-mer (tR = 23.3) on a reverse-phase μBondapak C18 column (0.78 × 30 cm; Waters) using a linear gradient of 0.05 m triethylammonium acetate (pH 7.0) containing 10–20% acetonitrile, an elution time of 60 min, and flow rate of 2.0 ml/min. Oligodeoxynucleotides were further purified by electrophoresis on 20% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of 7 m urea and labeled at the 5′-terminus by treatment with bacteriophage T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (31Maniatis F. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 122-123Google Scholar). To establish homogeneity, samples were subjected to 20% polyacrylamide gels (15 × 72 × 0.04 cm) containing 7 m urea. The position of oligomers on the gel was established by autoradiography using Kodak X-Omat XAR film.Table ISequence of oligodeoxynucleotidesNo.Sequence1CCTTCGCTCCTTTCCTCT2CCTTCAbCTCCTTTCCTCT3CCTTCReCTCCTTTCCTCT4CCTTCFCTCCTTTCCTCT5AGAGGAAAGG6AGAGGAAAGGAG7AGAGGAAAGGAGN8AGAGGAAAGGAGNGAAGG9AGAGGAAAGGAGGAAGG10AGAGGAAAGGAGAAGG11CCTTTGCTCCTTTCCTCT12AGAGGAAAGGAGNAAAGG13AGAGGAAAGGAGAAAGG14AGAGGAAAGGAGAAGG15CCTTCGCTACTTTCCTCTCCATTT16CCTTCAbCTACTTTCCTCTCCATTT17CCTTCUCTACTTTCCTCTCCATTT18CCTTCFCTACTTTCCTCTCCATTT19AGAGGAAAGT20AGAGGAAAGTAG21AGAGGAAAGTAGNGAAGG22AGAGGAAAGTAGGAAGG23AGAGGAAAGTAGAAGGShown are the sequences of templates, primers, and standard markers.

An Ab-modified 18-mer (1.0 μg) was cleaved immediately at the position of the lesion following incubation with 1 nNaOH (pH 13.0). In contrast, only 1.8 and 5.0% of Ab-modified 18-mer were degraded in 2 h when incubated at 25 and 37 °C, respectively, in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). As previously reported (9Takeshita M. Chang C.-N. Johnson F. Will S. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10171-10179Google Scholar), 18-mers containing Re and F were completely stable in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) when incubated at 37° C. This reaction was performed as described in earlier publications from this laboratory (25Shibutani S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 625-629Google Scholar, 32Shibutani S. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P.

An 18-mer (5′-CCTTCXCTCCTTTCCTCT or 5′-CCTTTXCTCCTTTCCTCT) or a 24-mer (5′-CCTTCXCTACTTTCCTCTCCATTT) template (1.0 pmol) containing dG or a single Ab, Re, or F at the position designated X was annealed to 0.5 pmol of a 32P-labeled 10-mer (Sequence 5 or 19) or 12-mer primer (Sequence 6 or 20). Primer extension was carried out in a buffer (10 μl) containing four dNTPs (100 μmeach) and an unmodified or modified DNA template primed with a32P-labeled 10-mer or 12-mer. Klenow fragment with (exo+) or without (exo−) 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity was incubated at 25 or 30 °C for 1 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 8 mmMgCl2 and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Primer extension reactions with pol α were conducted at 30 °C in 10 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 10 mmMgCl2, 20 mm ammonium sulfate, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.5 μg/μl bovine serum albumin using a modified template (0.2 pmol) annealed to a 32P-labeled 12-mer primer (0.1 pmol). Reaction mixtures were subjected to analysis by two-phase 20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (35 × 42 × 0.04 cm or 15 × 72 × 0.04 cm) with 7 m urea present in the upper phase and no urea in the lower phase (25Shibutani S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 625-629Google Scholar). Following gel electrophoresis, positions of the oligomers were established by autoradiography. Radioactivity was measured in a Packard scintillation counter. The detection limit for reaction products was 0.03% of the starting primer. Kinetic parameters related to nucleotide insertion and chain extension were determined under conditions similar to those described for the primer extension assay (32Shibutani S. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Nature. 1991; 349: 431-434Google Scholar, 33Shibutani S. Margulis L.M. Geacintov N.E. Grollman A.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7531-7541Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures containing varying amounts (0.001–0.05 units) of exo+ or exo− Klenow fragment were incubated at 30 °C for 1.0–5.0 min in 10 μl of Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1.0 pmol of template DNA (5′-CCTTCXCTCCTTTCCTCT, X = dG, Ab, Re, or F) primed with 0.5 pmol of 32P-labeled 12-mer (5′-AGAGGAAAGGAG) to measure nucleotide insertion kinetics or with a32P-labeled 13-mer (5′-AGAGGAAAGGAGN, N = C, A, G, or T) to measure chain extension kinetics as described by Mendelmanet al. (26Mendelman L.V. Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14415-14423Google Scholar, 27Mendelman L.V. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2338-2346Google Scholar). Base insertion was measured in reactions using 0.005 units of exo+ Klenow fragment for 60 s (C:G), 0.05 units for 90 s (A:Ab, A:Re, and A:F), 0.05 units for 3 min (G:Ab, G:Re, and G:F), and 0.05 units for 5 min for other pairs and 0.001 units of exo− Klenow fragment for 60 s (C:G), 0.01 units for 90 s (A:Ab, A:Re, and A:F), and 0.05 units for 90 s (A:G, G:G, G:Ab, G:Re, and G:F). Kinetics of extension were measured in reactions using 0.005 units of exo+ Klenow fragment for 60 s (C:G) and 0.05 units for 5 min for other pairs and 0.001 units of exo− Klenow fragment for 60 s (C:G), 0.05 units for 3 min (G:G), and 0.05 units for 5 min for other pairs. Using a 32P-labeled DNA duplex (5′-CTGCTTTCCTCT/GAGGAAAGGAGA), the frequency of dNTP incorporation at the blunt end of the duplex was measured in reactions using 0.05 units of exo+ Klenow fragment for 5 min. Samples were heated for 3 min at 95 °C in the presence of formamide and then applied to a 20% polyacrylamide gel (35 × 42 × 0.04 cm) in the presence of 7 m urea. Following gel electrophoresis, bands were located by autoradiography and quantified as described above. Values for the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) and the maximum velocity of the reaction (Vmax) were obtained from Hanes-Woolf plots. The ratio of primer-template to enzyme (0.05 units) is at least 20:1; similar values were reported by Boosaliset al. (34Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14689-14696Google Scholar). Less than 20% of the primer is extended under the steady-state conditions used in our studies (35Creighton S. Huang M.-M. Cai H. Arnheim N. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2633-2639Google Scholar). All data reported represent an average of two to four independent experiments. Frequencies of nucleotide insertion (Fins) and chain extension (Fext) were determined relative to dC:dG according to equations derived by Mendelman et al.(26Mendelman L.V. Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14415-14423Google Scholar, 27Mendelman L.V. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2338-2346Google Scholar), where F = (Vmax/Km)wrong pair/(Vmax/Km)right pair=dC:dG, with “wrong pair” defined as a mismatch or any pair involving Ab, Re, or F. The structures of the natural and synthetic abasic sites used in these experiments are shown in Fig.1. Primer extension reactions, catalyzed by the exo− Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, were conducted in the presence of four dNTPs. The expected reaction products, represented by a mixture of 32P-labeled oligodeoxynucleotides containing dC, dA, dG, dT, and 1- or 2-base deletions (25Shibutani S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 625-629Google Scholar), were completely resolved by two-phase 20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (72 cm), as shown in Fig.2 (lanes 1 and 5). DNA synthesis on an unmodified template (Fig. 2, lane 2) led to the expected incorporation of dCMP (85.2% of the starting primer) opposite dG at position 13 with no deletions. When an Ab-modified oligodeoxynucleotide was used as template (lane 3), dAMP (35.5%) was preferentially incorporated opposite the lesion; 2-base deletions (7.1%) were also formed. Similar results were obtained using an F-modified template (lane 4). In contrast, following 15 min of primer extension on an 18-mer template containing Re, the amount of fully extended product containing a 2-base deletion (32.5%) exceeded dAMP incorporation opposite the lesion (15.6%) and 1-base deletions (0.61%) (Table II). The amount of these products increased over time (Table II) and was dependent on the amount of enzyme used in the reaction (data not shown). Incorporation of dGMP and dTMP opposite abasic sites was not detected. In the presence of excess enzyme, blunt end extension was observed (slowly migrating bands in lanes 3 and 4).Table IITime course of primer extension in reactions catalyzed by the exo− Klenow fragment on templates containing abasic sitesLesionTimedCdAΔ1Δ2min%%%%Template AdG383.4 ± 1.2ND2-aND, not detectable.NDNDAb3ND21.7 ± 3.1 (1.0)0.29 ± 0.04 (1.0)2.4 ± 0.6 (1.0)15ND37.8 ± 1.4 (1.7)0.89 ± 0.04 (3.1)10.4 ± 0.6 (4.4)60ND48.1 ± 1.4 (2.2)1.53 ± 0.15 (5.3)21.1 ± 1.0 (9.0)Re3ND6.8 ± 0.4 (1.0)0.31 ± 0.06 (1.0)6.1 ± 0.4 (1.0)15ND15.6 ± 0.1 (2.3)0.61 ± 0.01 (2.0)32.5 ± 0.9 (5.3)60ND17.8 ± 0.1 (2.6)1.03 ± 0.19 (3.3)49.1 ± 1.1 (8.0)F3ND19.4 ± 1.5 (1.0)0.46 ± 0.06 (1.0)3.3 ± 0.1 (1.0)15ND39.2 ± 0.7 (2.0)0.78 ± 0.11 (1.7)15.0 ± 1.3 (4.5)60ND42.7 ± 1.6 (2.6)1.43 ± 0.02 (3.1)24.8 ± 0.3 (7.5)Template BdG390.3 ± 2.8NDNDNDAb3ND10.5 ± 0.3 (1.0)2.2 ± 0.1 (1.0)ND15ND26.7 ± 2.1 (2.5)8.7 ± 0.1 (3.9)ND60ND30.8 ± 2.5 (2.9)11.9 ± 0.9 (5.5)NDUsing an 18-mer template (A, 5′-CCTTC XCTCC-; B, 5′-CCTTT XCTCC-; X = dG or abasic site) primed with a 32P-labeled 10-mer, primer extension reactions were carried out at 25 °C using 0.01 units of exo− Klenow fragment for the template containing dG and 0.4 units for that containing abasic sites as described under “Experimental Procedures.” dC, dA, Δ1, and Δ2represent the amount of the fully extended product containing dC, dA, and 1- and 2-base deletions opposite the lesion produced from the starting primer, respectively.

The identity of the base incorporated and the position of deletions produced during translesional synthesis on Ab-modified templates were confirmed by Maxam-Gilbert sequence analysis (36Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods in Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Google Scholar). The fully extended reaction products migrating at positions 18 and 16 (Fig. 2, lane 3) represent dAMP incorporation opposite Ab and a 2-base deletion opposite the lesion, respectively (data not shown). Similar results were obtained by sequence analysis of fully extended products generated on Re- or F-modified templates (data not shown). Kinetic parameters for nucleotide insertion opposite Ab, Re, or F and for chain extension from the 3′-primer terminus were determined under steady-state conditions as described previously (37Shibutani S. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11703-11710Google Scholar, 38Shibutani S. Bodepudi V. Johnson F. Grollman A.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4615-4621Google Scholar). The exo+ Klenow fragment lacks 5′ → 3′ exonuclease activity, and the exo− Klenow fragment lacks both 5′ → 3′ and 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activities. As shown in Table III, the relative insertion frequency (Fins) opposite the abasic site for the exo+ Klenow fragment followed the order dAMP > dGMP > dCMP > dTMP.Fins for dAMP incorporation opposite abasic sites was 23–48 times higher than for dAMP opposite dG and 3–8 times higher than for dGMP opposite Ab, Re, or F. Finsfor dAMP opposite F was 2 times higher than for dAMP opposite Ab or Re.Fext could only be detected for the dA:Ab and dA:F pairs.

As the closed initiation complex is converted to an open one, specific protein-DNA interactions involving bases of the nontemplate strand form and stabilize the promoter complex in the region of unwinding. Specific interaction between RNA polymerase and the promoter in Escherichia coli was detected and quantified as the binding affinity of nontemplate oligonucleotide sequences.

While desensitization of other seven-transmembrane domain receptors is mediated by receptor phosphorylation and/or internalization, the mechanisms mediating SRIF receptor (sst) desensitization are unknown. Therefore, we investigated the susceptibility of the sst2A receptor isotype to ligand-induced desensitization, internalization, and phosphorylation in GH-R2 cells, a clone of pituitary tumor cells overexpressing this receptor. A 30-min exposure of cells to either SRIF or the analog SMS 201–995 (SMS) reduced both the potency and efficacy of agonist inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Internalization of receptor-bound ligand was rapid (t½ = 4 min) and temperature-dependent. SRIF and SMS increased the phosphorylation of the 71-kDa sst2A protein 25-fold within 15 min. Receptor phosphorylation was dependent on both the concentration and time of agonist exposure and was not affected by pertussis toxin pretreatment, indicating that receptor occupancy rather than second messenger formation was required. Receptor phosphorylation was also stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate activation of protein kinase C. Both ligand-stimulated and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated receptor phosphorylation occurred primarily on serine. These studies are the first demonstration of agonist-dependent desensitization, internalization, and phosphorylation of the sst2A receptor and suggest that phosphorylation may mediate the homologous and heterologous regulation of this receptor.

Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 427-442Google Scholar). Within the SRIF receptor family, sst2A receptor mRNA has been detected in many tissues including the brain, pituitary, pancreas, spleen, small intestine, and stomach (1Hoyer D. Bell G.I. Berelowitz M. Epelbaum J. Feniuk W. Humphrey P.P.A. O'Carroll A.-M. Patel Y.C. Schonbrunn A. Taylor J.E. Reisine T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 86-88Google Scholar, 2Reisine T. Bell G. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 427-442Google Scholar), and the receptor protein has recently been shown to be widely distributed in the mammalian brain (3Dournaud P. Gu Y.-Z. Schonbrunn A. Tannenbaum G. Beaudet A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4468-4478Google Scholar). Thus, this receptor isotype mediates many of the central and peripheral actions of SRIF. Early studies on the signal transduction mechanisms activated by SRIF showed that sst receptors elicited their actions predominantly via pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins (1Hoyer D. Bell G.I. Berelowitz M. Epelbaum J. Feniuk W. Humphrey P.P.A. O'Carroll A.-M. Patel Y.C. Schonbrunn A. Taylor J.E. Reisine T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 86-88Google Scholar, 2Reisine T. Bell G. Endocr.

Thus, SRIF inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and Ca2+ channels, as well as SRIF stimulation of K+ channels, phospholipase C, serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphatases, arachidonic acid release, and mitogen-activated protein kinases are inhibited by pertussis toxin treatment (5Koch B.D.

Abdul Majid M. Sho K. Kondo Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 986-992Google Scholar). However, some actions of SRIF, such as stimulation of other tyrosine phosphatases as well as inhibition of Na/H exchange, are pertussis toxin-insensitive (13Colas B. Cambillau C. Buscail L.

Chem. 1994; 269: 10357-10362Google Scholar). The network of signaling pathways activated by individual sst receptor isotypes is largely unknown. Signaling mechanisms have been especially difficult to elucidate in the native environment of the receptors because most SRIF target cells express multiple sst receptor isotypes that cannot be individually activated with the analogs currently available. For most G protein-coupled receptors, hormone treatment decreases receptor responsiveness (desensitization), receptor levels (down-regulation), or both. However, relatively little is known about sst receptor regulation, especially following acute hormonal challenge. Exposure to SRIF or to selective SRIF agonists such as SMS 201–995 (SMS) has been reported to lead to desensitization in pituitary cells over the course of hours, days, or weeks (15Smith M. Yamamoto G. Vale W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1984; 37: 311-318Google Scholar, 16Welsh J. Szabo M. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 2230-2234Google Scholar, 17Kehijman M. Frohman L. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Ther. 1988; 245: 225-231Google Scholar) has been reported in the AtT20 corticotropic pituitary cell line, depending on the signaling pathway being examined. However, SRIF receptor desensitization was not detected in the mammotropic GH4C1 pituitary cell line (22Presky D.H. Schonbrunn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 714-721Google Scholar) and does not occur during long term treatment of many human pituitary tumors with SMS (23Ducasse M. Tauber J.P. Tourre T. Bonafe A. Babin T.H. Tauber M.T. Harris A.G. Bayard F. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1987; 65: 1042-1046Google Scholar). SRIF receptors can be either down-regulated (24Mahy N. Woolkalis M. Manning D. Reisine T. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

The SRIF receptor isotypes involved in these varying effects are unknown although sst2 receptors are expressed, along with other sst receptor subtypes, in the normal pituitary, in pituitary tumors, and in the AtT20 and GH4C1 cell lines (2Reisine T. Bell G. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 427-442Google Scholar,25Gu Y.-Z. Brown P.J. Loose-Mitchell D.S. Stork P.J.S. Schonbrunn A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 1004-1014Google Scholar). 2Y.-Z. Gu and A. Schonbrunn, Mol. Endrocrinol., in press. 2Y.-Z. Gu and A. Schonbrunn, Mol. Endrocrinol., in press. Interestingly, for sst2A receptors exogenously expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, receptor binding has been reported to be either decreased (27Rens-Domiano S. Law S.F. Yamada Y. Seino S. Bell G.I. Reisine T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 28-34Google Scholar, 28Vanetti M. Vogt G. Hollt V. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 260-266Google Scholar) or increased (29Hukovic N. Panetta R. Kumar U. Patel Y. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4046-4049Google Scholar) by SRIF pretreatment. However, no desensitization studies have been reported with this receptor isotype. Ligand-dependent and -independent desensitization of other G protein-coupled receptors is mediated by receptor phosphorylation (30Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2881-2889Google Scholar). Examination of sst2A receptor phosphorylation requires a cell line expressing high levels of functional receptor protein. However, identification of appropriate cell lines for studies of exogenously expressed sst2A receptors has proven problematic. Although it is well established that SRIF inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity in native cells (1Hoyer D. Bell G.I. Berelowitz M. Epelbaum J. Feniuk W. Humphrey P.P.A. O'Carroll A.-M. Patel Y.C.

Loose-Mitchell D. CIBA Found. Symp. 1995; 190: 204-221Google Scholar), the coupling of the sst2A receptor to adenylyl cyclase in heterologous cell lines varies with the cell model (1Hoyer D. Bell G.I. Berelowitz M. Epelbaum J. Feniuk W. Humphrey P.P.A. O'Carroll A.-M. Patel Y.C. Schonbrunn A. Taylor J.E. Reisine T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 86-88Google Scholar) suggesting that components required for faithful mimicry of the normal function of the sst2A receptor are not ubiquitously expressed. The GH4C1 pituitary tumor cell line, which contains both the sst1 and sst2A receptors (25Gu Y.-Z. Brown P.J. Loose-Mitchell D.S. Stork P.J.S. Schonbrunn A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 1004-1014Google Scholar),2 has been extensively used for studies of SRIF receptor signaling and regulation (4Schonbrunn A. Gu Y.-Z. Brown P.J. Loose-Mitchell D. CIBA Found. Symp. 1995; 190: 204-221Google Scholar). Recently, a subclone of GH4C1 cells was isolated following transfection with sst2A receptor cDNA (31Carrick T.A. Bingham B. Eppler C.M. Baumbach W.R. Zysk J.R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4701-4704Google Scholar). This transfected cell line (GH4-R2.20 cells) expresses approximately 100 times as many functional sst2A receptors as the parental GH4C1 cells and has both the elevated sst2A receptor expression required for phosphorylation studies and an environment that allows normal receptor coupling. By taking advantage of the 10,000-fold greater affinity of SMS 201–995 for the sst2 over the sst1 receptor (1Hoyer D. Bell G.I. Berelowitz M. Epelbaum J. Feniuk W. Humphrey P.P.A. O'Carroll A.-M. Patel Y.C. Schonbrunn A. Taylor J.E. Reisine T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 86-88Google Scholar), we now demonstrate agonist-dependent desensitization, internalization, and phosphorylation of the sst2A receptor in this pituitary model cell line. Cell culture medium and G418 were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The sst2A-receptor antiserum (R2-88) has been described.2 Leupeptin, pepstatin A, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, soybean trypsin inhibitor, bacitracin, cholesterol hemisuccinate, Nonidet P-40, and Protein A were obtained from Sigma. N-Dodecyl β-d-maltoside and pertussis toxin were purchased from Calbiochem and List Biological Laboratories, Inc. (Campbell, CA), respectively. CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. (Uppsala, Sweden). Bradford reagent and reagents for electrophoresis and Western blotting were obtained from Bio-Rad. Carrier-free Na125I was purchased from Amersham Corp. Phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and [32P]orthophosphate were purchased from ICN Biomedicals (Irvine, CA). All other reagents were of the best grade available and purchased from common suppliers. The clonal GH4-R2.20 cell line (hereafter referred to as GH-R2 cells) was generated by transfecting GH4C1 pituitary tumor cells with the rat sst2A receptor and was grown as described previously (31Carrick T.A. Bingham B. Eppler C.M. Baumbach W.R. Zysk J.R. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4701-4704Google Scholar). Experimental cultures were plated in medium without G418 and used 2–7 days later with a medium change 18–24 h prior to use. Experiments were carried out with cells plated in 100-mm dishes except whole cell binding experiments, which used cells in 35-mm wells. GH-R2 cells were washed with and scraped into cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 10 mmNa2HPO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 nm okadaic acid). Following centrifugation, the cell pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, pH 7.6) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors and membranes were prepared and stored as described previously (25Gu Y.-Z. Brown P.J. Loose-Mitchell D.S. Stork P.J.S. Schonbrunn A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 1004-1014Google Scholar). Membranes used for photoaffinity cross-linking were prepared in the presence of protease inhibitors alone. GH-R2 cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 100 nm SMS (Sandoz Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland) or SRIF for 30 min in fresh growth medium. Membranes were then prepared as described above and assayed in triplicate (2–5 μg of membrane protein/tube) for adenylyl cyclase activity as described previously (32Yuan N. Friedman J. Whaley B.S. Clark R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23032-23038Google Scholar). Cyclase activity was 30–100 pmol/min/mg under basal conditions and 300–800 pmol/min/mg in the presence of 100 nm VIP. Cyclase activity measured in the presence of both 100 nm VIP and varying concentrations of SMS was expressed as a percent of the VIP-stimulated activity, and fitted values for maximal inhibition and EC50 (the concentration required to produce half-maximal inhibition) were obtained by least squares nonlinear regression analysis of dose-response curves using the program D/R (Biomedical Computing, Inc. Houston, TX). [Leu8,d-Trp22,Tyr25]somatostatin-28 (Bachem California, Torrance, CA) and the sst2 receptor-selective somatostatin analog [Tyr3]SMS (Sandoz Pharmaceuticals) were radioiodinated using chloramine T and subsequently purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography as described previously (33Presky D.H. Schonbrunn A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 651-658Google Scholar). GH-R2 cells were incubated at 4 °C in 1 ml of binding buffer (F10 medium containing 20 mm HEPES and 5 mg/ml lactalbumin hydrolysate, pH 7.4) containing approximately 100,000 cpm of [125I-Tyr3]SMS with or without 100 nm unlabeled SRIF (34Presky D.H. Schonbrunn A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 878-888Google Scholar). After 60 min, the cells were rinsed to remove unbound trace and then incubated in fresh 37 °C buffer to allow internalization of the receptor-bound ligand. Cells were subsequently incubated on ice for 5 min in acidic glycine-buffered saline (100 mm glycine, 50 mm NaCl, pH 3.0) to release surface-bound ligand. After collection of the acidic buffer, the cells were dissolved in 0.1 n NaOH. The radioactivity in both the glycine buffer (representing surface-bound ligand) and in the cell lysates (representing internalized ligand) was measured (34Presky D.H. Schonbrunn A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 878-888Google Scholar). Specific binding was calculated as the difference between the amount of radioligand bound in each fraction in the absence (total binding) and presence of 100 nm SRIF (nonspecific binding). GH-R2 cells were washed, scraped into cold PBS, pelleted, and solubilized in PBS containing 4 mg/ml dodecyl β-maltoside, 200 μg/ml cholesterol hemisuccinate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 50 μg/ml bacitracin for 60 min at 4 °C. The detergent lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the protein content of the supernatants was assessed by the method of Bradford (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 53: 304-308Google Scholar). Protein (10 μg/lane) was dissolved in sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol (v/v), 6 m urea, 20% glycerol, pH 6.8) by incubation at 60 °C for 15 min prior to resolution on a 7.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel. Resolved proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane as described previously.2 The membrane was then blocked for 2 h with “Blotto” (10 mm NaH2PO4, 10% nonfat dry milk, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Tween 20) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1:20,000 dilution of anti-sst2A antibody R2–88 in Blotto. Following repeated washing, the membrane was incubated with 1:5000 dilution of goat-anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase at room temperature for 1 h. Immunoreactive proteins were detected with the ECL chemiluminescent antibody detection system (Amersham Corp.). GH-R2 cells were incubated in growth medium in the presence or absence of protein kinase activators for 30 min. Cell membranes were prepared as described above and solubilized by agitation at 4 °C for 60 min in HEPES-buffered saline (150 mmNaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml bacitracin, 5 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate) containing 4 mg/ml dodecyl β-maltoside, 200 μg/ml cholesterol hemisuccinate (lysis buffer). After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-sst2A-receptor antiserum covalently coupled to Protein A-Sepharose (final dilution of 1:200). The immunoprecipitated proteins were dissolved in sample buffer without mercaptoethanol for 15 min at 60 °C. After removal of the Sepharose beads and the addition of 10% mercaptoethanol (v/v), proteins were resolved on 7.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to PVDF membrane, and immunoblotted with anti-sst2A antiserum as described above. Metabolic labeling of cells and subsequent immunoprecipitation of the sst2A receptor was carried out as described previously (36Hipkin R.W. Sanchez-Yague J. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 823-832Google Scholar, 37Williams B.Y. Wang Y. Schonbrunn A. Mol. Pharm. 1996; 50: 716-727Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (1 dish/treatment) were incubated for 3 h in 3.5 ml of phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate and either 1% newborn calf serum or 5 mg/ml lactalbumin hydrolysate. Hormones and pharmacological agents were then added directly to the labeling medium, and the cells were further incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for the indicated times. The cells were then scraped into cold Hepes-buffered saline, pelleted, and solubilized in lysis buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors for 60 min at 4 °C. The detergent lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the protein content of the supernatants was assessed by the method of Bradford (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 53: 304-308Google Scholar). The sst2A receptors were subjected to a two-step purification consisting of lectin affinity chromatography followed by immunoprecipitation with receptor antibody (36Hipkin R.W. Sanchez-Yague J. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 823-832Google Scholar).2 Briefly, equal amounts of lysate protein (∼2 mg/ml) were incubated at 4 °C for 90 min with 100 μl (packed volume) of washed wheat germ agglutinin-agarose (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Following centrifugation, the wheat germ agglutinin-agarose was washed vigorously with 30 volumes of lysis buffer, and adsorbed glycoproteins were eluted at 4 °C for 90 min with 250 μl of lysis buffer containing 3 mm N,N“,N‴-triacetyl-chitotriose (Sigma) and 0.5% SDS (v/v). Eluted proteins were diluted 5-fold and incubated with a 1:200 dilution of the anti-sst2A receptor antibody R2-88 at 4 °C for 90 min.2 The samples were then incubated at 4 °C for 90 min with 25 μl (packed volume) of protein A-Sepharose. Following centrifugation, the beads were washed as described previously (36Hipkin R.W. Sanchez-Yague J. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 823-832Google Scholar), and the immunoprecipitated proteins were solubilized in sample buffer (60 °C, 15 min) and resolved on 7.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. For phosphoamino acid analysis, SDS-PAGE-resolved proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane, and the piece of membrane containing the32P-labeled receptor (detected by autoradiography) was excised and incubated in 100 μl of 5.7 n HCl (Pierce) at 110 °C for 0.5 or 2 h (37Williams B.Y. Wang Y. Schonbrunn A. Mol. Pharm. 1996; 50: 716-727Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acids were resolved by two-dimensional thin layer electrophoresis on cellulose plates (37Williams B.Y. Wang Y. Schonbrunn A. Mol. Pharm. 1996; 50: 716-727Google Scholar). Receptor phosphorylation and phosphoamino acid analyses were quantitated using a PhosphorImager (37Williams B.Y. Wang Y. Schonbrunn A. Mol. Pharm. 1996; 50: 716-727Google Scholar). Protein A (Sigma) was covalently coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose B according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pharmacia). Antireceptor IgG was covalently coupled to protein A-Sepharose as described previously.2 Photoaffinity labeling of the membrane sst2A receptor with [Leu8,d-Trp22,125I-Tyr25]somatostatin-28 and N-5′-azido-2′-nitrobenzoyl-N-oxysuccinimide (Pierce) and subsequent immunoprecipitation of the receptor with anti-sst2A was accomplished by published procedures (38Brown P.J. Lee A.B. Norman M.G. Presky D.H. Schonbrunn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17995-18004Google Scholar).2Unless otherwise indicated results of a representative experiment are shown. All experiments were repeated at least 2 times. Whereas GH4C1 cells contain low levels (∼0.1 pmol/mg of cell protein) of a mixture of the somatostatin receptor subtypes sst1 and sst2 (25Gu Y.-Z. Brown P.J. Loose-Mitchell D.S. Stork P.J.S. Schonbrunn A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 1004-1014Google Scholar,39Schonbrunn A. Tashjian Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6473-6483Google Scholar) 3Y.-Z. Gu and A. Schonbrunn, unpublished observations. the transfected GH-R2 cell line expresses approximately 10 pmol of the sst2A receptor/mg of protein (data not shown). Incubation of intact GH-R2 cells for 2 h at 4 °C with the sst2 selective ligand [125I-Tyr3]SMS and increasing concentrations of unlabeled peptides showed dose-dependent inhibition of radioligand binding with both SRIF (EC50 = 2.24 ± 0.31 nm) and SMS (EC50 = 38.9 ± 7.5 nm). The relative affinities of the rat sst2A receptor for these two ligands thus agrees well with those of the human sst2A receptor as determined in membrane binding studies (40Kubota A. Yamada Y. Kagimoto S. Shimatsu A. Imamura M. Tsudas K. Imura H. Seino S. Seino Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1321-1325Google Scholar). To investigate the susceptibility of the sst2A receptor to desensitization, GH-R2 cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 100 nm SMS for 30 min at 37 °C. Membranes were then prepared, and the effect of pretreatment on hormonal regulation of adenylyl cyclase activity was determined (Fig. 1). SMS pretreatment did not affect either basal or VIP-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity (data not shown). In membranes from untreated cells SMS inhibited VIP-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity with an EC50 of 1.2 ± 0.1 nm. Maximal inhibition was 63.7 ± 1.5%. Preincubation of cells with SMS attenuated both the potency (EC50 = 7.0 ± 0.4 nm) and efficacy of SMS inhibition (maximum inhibition = 36.2 ± 2.3%). Treatment of cells with 100 nm SRIF for 30 min had the same effect as SMS; maximal inhibition was reduced from 60.1 ± 2.0 to 41.2 ± 2.6% while the EC50 for SMS was increased from 1.0 ± 0.2 to 6.9 ± 2.5 nm. Therefore, exposure to agonist results in homologous desensitization of the sst2A receptor. To ascertain if peptide binding induced rapid internalization of the ligand-receptor complex, cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with [125I-Tyr3]SMS to occupy cell surface receptors, washed to remove unbound peptide, and then warmed to 37 °C for different periods of time (Fig. 2). A rapid, time-dependent internalization of the receptor-bound ligand occurred at 37 °C reaching a steady state by 90 min (Fig. 2,upper panel). The rate of internalization was fit to the sum of two first order reactions, giving a value of 4.0 ± 0.7 min for the half-time of internalization of the receptor-ligand complex (Fig.2, lower panel). These results show that following binding to cell surface sst2A receptors, the bound ligand is rapidly internalized in a temperature-dependent manner. To determine whether the sst2A receptor was phosphorylated, we next developed and validated methods for the detection and purification of the sst2A receptor protein. The immunoblot in Fig. 3 (left panel) shows that a receptor antibody that specifically recognizes the sst2A receptor isotype reacted with a broad 71-kDa protein band in GH-R2 cell extracts.2 This band was not detected in immunoblots incubated with preimmune sera or with immune sera in the presence of 1 μm antigen peptide. To determine whether this 71-kDa protein was the sst2A receptor, GH-R2 membranes were photoaffinity-labeled with [Leu8,d-Trp22,125I-Tyr25]SRIF-28 and N-5′-azido-2′-nitrobenzoyl-N-oxysuccinimide in the presence or absence of 100 nm SRIF (38Brown P.J. Lee A.B. Norman M.G. Presky D.H. Schonbrunn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17995-18004Google Scholar). Membranes were then either directly solubilized with sample buffer (Fig. 3,middle panel) or solubilized with a non-denaturing detergent and then immunoprecipitated with preimmune or immune sst2A receptor antisera (Fig. 3, right panel). Subsequent analysis by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography showed that a 71-kDa protein was photoaffinity-labeled in membranes and that radiolabeling was effectively competed with SRIF, as expected for a high affinity sst receptor (middle panel). The photoaffinity-labeled protein was immunoprecipitated by receptor antiserum but not by preimmune antiserum nor by immune serum in the presence of 1 μmantigen peptide (right panel). Therefore, the receptor antibody effectively precipitated the 71-kDa sst2A receptor protein expressed in GH-R2 cells. To determine if agonist binding stimulated sst2A receptor phosphorylation, GH-R2 cells were labeled with [32P] orthophosphate and incubated in the absence or presence of 100 nm SRIF for 15 min. Following detergent solubilization and partial purification by lectin affinity chromatography, the sst2A receptor was immunoprecipitated with receptor antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. A low level of basal receptor phosphorylation was detectable with long film exposure (Figs. 6 and 8) or by analysis with a PhosphorImager, although it is difficult to discern in Fig. 4. Treatment of cells with SRIF increased the phosphorylation of the 71-kDa sst2A receptor protein 22 ± 6-fold over basal (n = 5). The 71-kDa phosphoprotein was not immunoprecipitated with either preimmune serum or with immune serum in the presence of antigen peptide (data not shown). Interestingly, it was necessary to solubilize the immunoprecipitated receptor by heating in sample buffer with 6m urea to dissociate receptor aggregates. When either phosphorylated (Fig. 4, lane 3) or photoaffinity-labeled (data not shown) receptors were immunoprecipitated and then solubilized in SDS sample buffer under reducing conditions but without urea and heating, a higher molecular wei"

Bone remodeling is a constant process that involves bone resorption and rebuilding (for review, see Ref. 1Baron R. Anat. Rec. 1989; 224: 317-324Google Scholar). The resorption phase of this process is carried out by osteoclasts, which adhere to the surface of bone leading to the creation of an extracellular compartment termed the resorption pit. The resorption pit is maintained at an acidic pH, causing the dissolution of the mineral components of the underlying bone and exposure of the proteinaceous matrix to the action of proteolytic enzymes (2Delaisse J.M. Eeckhout Y. Vaes G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 125: 441-447Google Scholar, 3Delaisse J.M. Eeckhout Y. Vaes G. Biochem. J. 1980; 192: 365-368Google Scholar, 4Lerner U.H. Grubb A. J.

The rebuilding phase of the remodeling process involves the recruitment of osteoblasts to the sites of prior bone resorption, where the layering of a new proteinaceous matrix occurs and becomes mineralized. Cathepsin K, a member of the papain cysteine protease family, has recently been implicated in the resorption of the bone matrix (7Li Y.P. Alexander M.B. Wucherpfennig A.L. Chen W. Yelick P.

Okamoto K. Wang B.B. Biroc S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2126-2132Google Scholar). Bossard (14Bossard M.J. Tomaszek T.A. Thompson S.K. Amegadzie B.Y. Hanning C.R. Jones C. Kurdyla J.T. McNulty D.E. Drake F.H. Gowen M. Levy M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12517-12524Google Scholar) and Brömme (13Brömme D. Okamoto K. Wang B.B. Biroc S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2126-2132Google Scholar) have demonstrated activation of the recombinant proenzyme in vitro by proteolytic degradation of the N-terminal 99-amino acid propeptide; however, different mechanisms leading to its activation were implicated. Activation of procathepsin K in vivo is likely to occur in the low pH environment of the resorption pit, via two possible mechanisms. The propeptide may be cleaved by another protease, such as cathepsin D as suggested by Brömme et al. or by an autocatalytic process, which is more consistent with the data presented by Bossard et al. (14Bossard M.J. Tomaszek T.A. Thompson S.K. Amegadzie B.Y. Hanning C.R. Jones C. Kurdyla J.T. McNulty D.E. Drake F.H. Gowen M. Levy M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12517-12524Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanism of activation of cathepsin K, we constructed a mutant in which the presumed active site Cys at position 139 was changed to Ser. The kinetics of activation of mutant and wild-type cathepsin K were studied in vitro. In this report we provide the following evidence for an autocatalytic activation mechanism. First, in vitro self-activation of wild-type procathepsin K occurs spontaneously at 4 °C, pH 4 and is catalyzed by mature cathepsin K. Second, unlike wild-type enzyme, the [Ser139,Ala163]procathepsin K mutant lacks the ability to self-process into a mature active enzyme, but can be processed by addition of wild-type mature cathepsin K. Significantly, the intermediates observed in this trans-processing of [Ser139,Ala163]procathepsin K are identical to those observed in the spontaneous activation of wild-type procathepsin K. Finally, procathepsin K has trace proteolytic activity, suggesting autocatalysis may occur in vivo.

Protein concentrations were estimated by the Bradford method using the Bio-Rad protein assay except where otherwise specified. Sf21 insect cells and wild-type baculovirus were purchased from Invitrogen. The cells were cultured in Grace's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% bovine fetal serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1 × penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 1 × amphotericin B (Boehringer Mannheim). The wild-type procathepsin K expression vector and recombinant virus were constructed according to published procedures (14Bossard M.J. Tomaszek T.A. Thompson S.K. Amegadzie B.Y. Hanning C.R. Jones C. Kurdyla J.T. McNulty D.E. Drake F.H. Gowen M. Levy M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12517-12524Google Scholar). The mutant expression vector was constructed by DNA site-directed mutagenesis as follows. A 1.36-kilobaseBamHI/SpeI fragment containing the coding region of pre-procathepsin K was subcloned into pSelect301, a modified version of pSelect (Promega) designed to contain additional restriction sites within the multiple cloning region. 2J. Fornwald, unpublished data. Single-stranded phagemid DNA was generated in KO7-infectedEscherichia coli strain JM101. The following oligonucleotides were used as primers for mutagenesis reactions: 5′-AGAGCTAAAAGCCCagaGGAACCACACTGACC-3′ and 5′-CACTAGGTTCTGGGGagcCAGATTTAAGAGTTTGCC-3′. This changed Cys139 to Ser and Ser163 to Ala, respectively, creating a double mutant. Both the C139S and S163A mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). The mutagenized 1.36-kilobase BamHI/SpeI fragment was then subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1393, which had been digested with BamHI and XbaI, generating the plasmid pBacMut1CatK. For construction of recombinant viruses, Sf21 cells were co-transfected with purified AcNPV linear DNA (Pharmingen) and pBacMut1CatK using the method described to generate recombinant virus (vBacCatK) for native cathepsin K (14Bossard M.J. Tomaszek T.A. Thompson S.K. Amegadzie B.Y. Hanning C.R. Jones C. Kurdyla J.T. McNulty D.E. Drake F.H. Gowen M. Levy M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12517-12524Google Scholar). Sf21 cells were infected with about 4 plaque-forming units of either wild-type vBacCatK or mutant vBacMut1CatK recombinant virus/cell at 27 °C in serum-containing medium. Twenty-four hours after infection, the cells were pelleted, resuspended in a serum-free medium, and incubated for an additional 72 h. Western blot analyses were performed on aliquots of the medium as described previously elsewhere (14Bossard M.J. Tomaszek T.A. Thompson S.K. Amegadzie B.Y. Hanning C.R. Jones C. Kurdyla J.T. McNulty D.E. Drake F.H. Gowen M. Levy M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12517-12524Google Scholar). Baculovirus conditioned medium (10 liters) containing wild-type or [Ser139,Ala163]procathepsin K at pH 6.5 was loaded onto a 100-ml S-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Pharamacia XK50, 5 × 5 cm) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.9 (buffer A). The column was washed to base line with 10 column volumes of buffer A. Bound material was eluted with a series of NaCl steps (0.35 m, 0.5 m, and 1m) in buffer A. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Procathepsin K eluted in the 0.5 m NaCl fraction and was analyzed by N-terminal sequencing and MALDI-MS (see below). Protein concentration was determined using a BCA (bicinchoninic acid) protein assay with bovine serum albumin standards (Pierce). Purified wild-type and mutant procathepsin K were concentrated to between 1 and 2.5 mg/ml using an Omegacell (Filtron Technology Corp.) with a 10-kDa molecular mass cut-off membrane. E64 (70 nmol) was added to 0.2 ml of procathepsin K (2.5 mg/ml, 14 nmol) in 20 mmsodium phosphate, 0.5 m NaCl at pH 6.8. After 15 min at 25 °C, the mixture was dialyzed against 5 liters of 20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 6.8 overnight at 4 °C using a a 12–14-kDa cutoff membrane (Spectra-Por, Spectrum Medical Industries, Inc.). The enzyme was diluted to 1 mg/ml with dialysis buffer prior to activation. Concentrated procathepsin K was incubated in activation buffer consisting of 0.2m sodium acetate, 20 mml-cysteine adjusted to pH 4.0 at 4 °C on a rotary mixer. Where indicated, 1% (mass/mass) mature cathepsin K was added as seed after pH adjustment. The mature cathepsin K that was used as seed was initially obtained from 60 °C induced activation of procathepsin K, a gift from M. Bossard (SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals) (14Bossard M.J. Tomaszek T.A. Thompson S.K. Amegadzie B.Y. Hanning C.R. Jones C. Kurdyla J.T. McNulty D.E. Drake F.H. Gowen M. Levy M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12517-12524Google Scholar). Subsequently, “seed” was made by the 4 °C activation procedure described here. The extent of activation and processing were assessed hourly by measuring hydrolytic activity as described below and by SDS-PAGE, respectively. SDS-PAGE analysis was carried out using 15% Tris-glycine Ready Gels (Bio-Rad). When the specific activity stopped increasing (∼15–25 μmol/min/mg), the reaction was stopped by the addition of E64 or by snap-freezing in a bath of dry ice in acetone. Cathepsin K activity was determined using a fluorogenic substrate in a microtiter plate format. The reactions consisted of 0.04–1 μg of mature cathepsin K, 20 μm Z-Phe-Arg-AMC in 100 mm sodium acetate, 20 mml-cysteine, 5 mm EDTA at pH 5.5. Reactions were initiated by the addition of substrate-containing assay buffer to the enzyme sample. The assay followed Z-Phe-Arg-AMC hydrolysis, which was measured using a Dynatech microtiter plate reader with excitation at 365 nm and fluorescence emission at 530 nm. Under these conditions the sensitivity of the assay was typically 4.7 × 10−7 μmol of AMC/fluorescence unit. Procathepsin K was assayed under the same conditions in the same buffer, but also included 100 mm MES and 100 mm HEPES so that the pH could be varied between 4 and 7. [Ser139,Ala163]procathepsin K was concentrated to 1 mg/ml and was used in three 0.1-ml reactions. All reactions contained activation buffer (0.2 m sodium acetate, 20 mml-cysteine at pH 4) and were mixed on a rotary mixer at 4 °C. No mature cathepsin K was added to the first reaction, whereas the second reaction included 1% wild-type mature cathepsin K (1 μg, specific activity 21 μmol/min/mg). The third reaction consisted of a mixture of 50 μl of [Ser139,Ala163]procathepsin K (1 mg/ml), 50 μl of wild-type procathepsin K (1 mg/ml) and 1% mature cathepsin K. One-microliter and 10-μl samples were taken at 1-h intervals for activity and SDS-PAGE analysis, respectively. Proteolytic cleavage of the propeptide from [Ser139,Ala163]procathepsin K was also accomplished using a modification of the published procedure utilizing pepsin (13Brömme D. Okamoto K. Wang B.B. Biroc S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2126-2132Google Scholar). Briefly, [Ser139,Ala163]procathepsin K (1 mg/ml) was incubated with pepsin (20 μg/ml) in 0.2 m sodium acetate, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mml-cysteine, and 5 mm dithiothreitol at 40 °C for 45 min. Sequence analysis was performed on a Beckman LC-3400 TriCart gas-phase protein sequencer equipped with a Beckman 126/166 system for on-line phenylthiohydantoin analysis (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA). Data was acquired using System Gold chromatography software. Samples were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride type supports (Problott), and standard Beckman optimized polyvinylidene difluoride sequencing cycles were used. MALDI-MS data were obtained on a Voyager RP laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Protein samples were prepared for analysis by diluting analyte 1:5 with 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (10 mg/ml in 2:1 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile) for a final concentration of 1–10 pmol/μl. Bovine β-lactoglobulin A (Sigma) was included as an internal calibrant (MH+ 18364 Da). Desorption/ionization was accomplished using photon irradiation from a 337-nm pulsed nitrogen laser and 25-keV accelerating energy. Spectra were averaged over ∼100 laser scans. Calibrations were carried out using a customized version of IGOR Pro (WaveMetrics, Inc., Lake Oswego, OR) on a Macintosh personal computer. Both the apo-cathepsin K (32 μm) and the E64-cathepsin K product (39 μm) were supplied in 4 mm MES buffer also containing 10 mm NaCl and 0.4 mml-cysteine at a pH of 6.06. These solutions were diluted with 10 μl of 88:8:4 MeOH:water:formic acid, followed by 80 μl of a 1:1:0.2% solution of MeOH:water:formic acid, resulting in a final cathepsin K concentration of ∼1.5 μm and a final volume of 100 μl. Two microliters of this solution was loaded into a pulled glass capillary for ultralow volume electrospray (nanospray) mass spectrometry. Mass spectra were recorded on a PE-Sciex API III (PE-Sciex Instruments, Concord, Ontario, Canada) by repetitively scanning the m/zrange of 1050–1650 with a step size of 0.05 and a dwell of 1 ms, and averaging 5–10 min of accumulated data. Results for all charge states corresponding to [M + nH]n+ and [M +(n − 1)H + Na]n+ between 15+ and 22+ were averaged together, producing a typical 95% confidence interval of ± 1.5 Da. Infection of Sf21 cells with either recombinant wild-type cathepsin K (vBacCatK) (14Bossard M.J. Tomaszek T.A. Thompson S.K. Amegadzie B.Y. Hanning C.R. Jones C. Kurdyla J.T. McNulty D.E. Drake F.H. Gowen M. Levy M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12517-12524Google Scholar) or mutant (vBacCatKMut1) virus resulted in the production of identically sized proenzyme protein bands of approximately 35,000 Da as determined by Western blot analysis using a previously generated antiserum (14Bossard M.J. Tomaszek T.A. Thompson S.K. Amegadzie B.Y. Hanning C.R. Jones C. Kurdyla J.T. McNulty D.E. Drake F.H. Gowen M. Levy M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12517-12524Google Scholar). As was determined for the wild-type proenzyme (14Bossard M.J. Tomaszek T.A. Thompson S.K. Amegadzie B.Y. Hanning C.R. Jones C. Kurdyla J.T. McNulty D.E. Drake F.H. Gowen M. Levy M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12517-12524Google Scholar), most of the mutant protein was also secreted into the medium with a smaller percentage of the expressed protein retained in the cell pellets (data not shown). The secreted proenzyme was purified to greater than 85% homogeneity, as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1, lane 1). The N-terminal sequence of the purified proenzyme was LYPEEILD, which indicated cleavage of the secretion signal sequence occurred after Ala15. No secondary sequence was observed. Analysis the proenzyme by MALDI-MS yielded a mass of 36366 Da, which exceeded by 3% the theoretical mass, 35300.5 Da, calculated from the amino acid sequence. Edman sequencing data gave a very low yield for Asn103, the potential N-linked glycosylation site in the propeptide domain, consistent with glycosylation of this residue. Absence of glycosylation at Asn161 in the mature form of the protein was indicated by MS (see below). Several attempts to further purify the enzyme by a variety of ion exchange and size exclusion chromatography resulted in poor recovery of procathepsin K. The time courses of activation reactions containing zero (open circles) and 1% mature cathepsin K (filled circles) were determined (Fig. 2). Procathepsin K activated without mature cathepsin K at 4 °C, pH 4. The reaction containing 1% mature cathepsin K had no apparent lag and required a shorter time to obtain full enzymatic activity. SDS-PAGE analysis of the proteolytic conversion to mature enzyme in the absence of seed (Fig. 1) indicated the accumulation of intermediates (25–35 kDa) and propeptide fragments (6.5–12 kDa). Full activity, typically 15–25 μmol/min/mg, was determined at the end of the activation when an accurate protein concentration was determined. The reaction of 1% mature cathepsin K with procathepsin K that had been pretreated with E64 did not produce any activated mature cathepsin K (Fig. 2,open triangles), and <5% propeptide degradation was observed by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Early cleavage sites were determined by N-terminal sequencing of the protein bands isolated from a blot of a SDS-PAGE gel from a subsequent activation reaction using identical conditions to the one described above. The two largest intermediates resulted from cleavages which occurred immediately after Glu19 and Ser98, respectively. The third and smallest intermediate was derived from cleavage after Glu110. N-terminal sequence analysis indicated that mature cathepsin K was composed of a mixture of enzymes with N termini of Gly113RAP-, Arg114APD- and Ala115PD-, with varying ratios depending on the preparation. These results were consistently observed in four individual activation reactions. MALDI-MS of a pool of activated enzyme that exhibited a 1:1 ratio of Gly113 and Arg114 N termini yielded a Mr of 23,696 for the unresolved protein components. Electrospray mass spectrometry (ESMS) for a preparation in which Arg114 and Ala115 dominated as the N termini yielded molecular masses of 23,646.7 ± 1.5 Da and 23,590.1 ± 1.5 Da for the two protein species (calculated = 23,645.7 and 23,489.5, respectively, for the protein ending with Met329). The electrospray data are consistent with six of the eight Cys residues being in disulfide linkage. Both the electrospray and MALDI-MS data indicate that the mature protein is not glycosylated. ESMS of the complex formed by reaction of a preparation of activated, mature cathepsin K (Arg114, major and Ala115, minor N termini) with E64 yielded a determinedMr for the major component of 24,001.8 (calculated = 24,003.0). This mass is consistent with addition of the entire inhibitor into the protein via ring opening of the epoxide by the thiol of the active-site Cys residue. [Ser139,Ala163]Procathepsin K was purified to greater than 85% homogeneity as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 3 A,lane 1). The N-terminal sequence of proenzyme indicated that cleavage of the secretion signal sequence occurred after the Ala15 residue, consistent with that observed for wild-type protein. MALDI-MS analysis indicated the mutant procathepsin K contained approximately 2% glycosylation by mass. The studies designed to distinguish between autocatalytic activation and activation catalyzed by a protease other than cathepsin K consisted of three different experiments. The first two experiments contained mutant procathepsin K, which was incubated in pH 4 buffer either in the absence or presence of one percent wild-type mature cathepsin K. The third experiment was done to observe full processing of the mutant procathepsin K and consisted of a 1:1 mixture of wild-type procathepsin K and mutant procathepsin K with 1% wild-type mature cathepsin K. The result of the first experiment is shown in Fig. 3 A. Mutant procathepsin K did not process to mature cathepsin K in the absence of wild-type mature cathepsin K seed, but was partially processed in the presence of a catalytic amount of wild-type mature cathepsin K as shown in Fig. 3 B. There was no increase in activity (Fig. 4, open circles), but rather the activity of the seed decreased 15-fold during the first 2 h of the reaction. Under the reaction conditions the initially formed propeptide fragments were stable, which allowed for their characterization (see below). The third experiment consisting of a 1:1 mixture of mutant and wild-type cathepsin K, and one percent mature cathepsin K seed resulted in complete conversion to mature cathepsin K as shown in Fig. 3 C. The specific activity of the resultant mature enzyme was 11 μmol/min/mg, which was about one half that observed for the wild-type enzyme used in this experiment (25 μmol/min/mg). The mutant enzyme was also processed to mature enzyme by pepsin (data not shown). The intermediates and propeptide fragments (Fig. 3 B) were characterized by N-terminal sequencing and MALDI-MS. Cleavages occurred after Glu19, Ser98, and Glu110. Two fragments of the propeptide both had an N terminus starting at Glu20 (shown better in Fig. 3 C). The small fragment had an observed mass of 6756, which indicated the C-terminal would be Ala74. The large fragment had an observed mass of 9378, which would require the C terminus to be Ser98. A summary of the cleavages observed in both the wild-type and mutant activations is presented in Fig. 5. Activation of procathepsin K in the absence of mature cathepsin K suggests that the proenzyme has proteolytic activity. Procathepsin K isolated from baculovirus medium, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” was assayed for activity at pH 3.5–7.0 and was found to hydrolyze Z-PheArg-AMC having a maximal activity at pH 4. The specific activity, based upon estimates from initial velocity measurements, was 0.007–0.014 μmol/min/mg, approximately 2000-fold lower than mature cathepsin K activity. Bossard et al. (14Bossard M.J. Tomaszek T.A. Thompson S.K. Amegadzie B.Y. Hanning C.R. Jones C. Kurdyla J.T. McNulty D.E. Drake F.H. Gowen M. Levy M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12517-12524Google Scholar) reported a successful small scale (80 μg/ml) activation of semi-pure procathepsin K under two conditions: (a) brief exposure to elevated temperatures or (b) incubation at 4 °C in the presence of a catalytic amount of preactivated mature cathepsin K. Their results suggested an autocatalytic mechanism for cathepsin K activation. Evidence against an autoactivation mechanism was provided by a study by Brömmeet al. (13Brömme D. Okamoto K. Wang B.B. Biroc S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2126-2132Google Scholar), in which no autoprocessing was observed and the activation could only be accomplished using pepsin (13Brömme D. Okamoto K. Wang B.B. Biroc S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2126-2132Google Scholar). To examine the mechanism of cathepsin K activation, we examined the putative catalytic effect of preactivated mature cathepsin K. In agreement with Bossard's observation, procathepsin K could be activated at 4 °C and pH 4 in the absence of preactivated mature cathepsin K, and the activation was catalyzed by the addition of 1% mature cathepsin K. These results differ from those of Brömmeet al.; however, there were several differences in the procedures employed. We activated enzyme that was greater than 85% pure and was at a much higher concentration in the activation reaction. Brömme et al. attempted to activate procathepsin K without purification in the baculovirus crude cell lysate. Additionally, we observed that the spontaneous activation in the absence of 1% mature cathepsin K could be inhibited by pretreating the procathepsin K with the cysteine protease inhibitor, E64, thereby demonstrating that activation was due to a cysteine protease. Mature cathepsin K produced under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures” contained a ragged N terminus, composed of a mixture of NH2-G113RAPD-, NH2-R114APD- and NH2-A115PD-. The site for N-terminal cleavage for mature cathepsin K was predicted to be after NH2-A115 based upon a sequence alignment of cathepsin S and L (14Bossard M.J. Tomaszek T.A. Thompson S.K. Amegadzie B.Y. Hanning C.R. Jones C. Kurdyla J.T. McNulty D.E. Drake F.H. Gowen M. Levy M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12517-12524Google Scholar). The one or two extra N-terminal amino acids observed in the activation of cathepsin K were consistent with the N-terminal extension of several amino acids of the propeptide, which were observed in the autoprocessing of cathepsin B (16Rowan A.D. Mason P. Mach L. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15993-15999Google Scholar) and cathepsin S (17Brömme D. Bonneau P.R. Lachance P. Wiederanders B. Kirschke H. Peters C. Thomas D.Y. Storer A.C. Vernet T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4832-4838Google Scholar). The MALDI-MS of wild-type procathepsin K indicated that approximately 3% of the mass was due to glycosylation at one or both of two potential glycosylation sites in the procathepsin K sequence, one of which was located in the propeptide domain (14Bossard M.J. Tomaszek T.A. Thompson S.K. Amegadzie B.Y. Hanning C.R. Jones C. Kurdyla J.T. McNulty D.E. Drake F.H. Gowen M. Levy M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12517-12524Google Scholar). To determine if the mature enzyme was glycosylated, we analyzed mature cathepsin K and E64-inhibited mature cathepsin K by MALDI-MS and ESMS, which indicated the absence of glycosylation on the mature cathepsin K. These data, together with the Edman sequencing results, indicate that all of the carbohydrate is located on Asn103 in the propeptide domain, although our results do not rule out the possibility ofO-gycosylation elsewhere in the propeptide domain. Our results contrast with those of Brömme et al. (13Brömme D. Okamoto K. Wang B.B. Biroc S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2126-2132Google Scholar), who observed no glycosylation on procathepsin K. The discrepancy may be a result of different expression conditions. In vitro activation of procathepsin K in the absence of preactivated mature cathepsin K could be the result of limited proteolytic activity of procathepsin K under the reaction conditions,i.e. autoactivation, or by the activity of a contaminating baculovirus protease as suggested by Brömme. Autocatalytic processing mechanisms have been verified for propapain (15Vernet T. Khouri H.E. Laflamme P. Tessier D.C. Musil R. Gour-Salin B.J. Storer A.C. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21451-21457Google Scholar) and procathepsin B (16Rowan A.D. Mason P. Mach L. Mort J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15993-15999Google Scholar) through experiments that showed that an active site cysteine to serine mutation eliminated the proenzyme's ability to autoactivate. Analogously, we constructed a mutant in which the active site cysteine of procathepsin K, Cys139, was mutated to serine. We reasoned that such a mutant should lack the ability to autoprocess, and any processing observed under the activation conditions in the absence of mature cathepsin K would have to be due to a contaminating protease. The additional mutation at residue 163, serine to alanine, was incorporated to remove the potential glycosylation site in the mature enzyme. The [Ser139,Ala163]procathepsin K did not process to the mature form at pH 4, but did undergo limited proteolytic cleavage when 1% wild-type mature cathepsin K was included in the reaction mixture. The peptide intermediates generated in this reaction match exactly the peptide intermediates observed in the activation of wild-type procathepsin K (Fig. 5). These results clearly demonstrated that mature cathepsin K could proteolytically process mutant procathepsin K and gives strong evidence in support of a trans-autoactivation process. Additionally, the intermediates formed during the reaction had the ability to inhibit the processing of the mutant enzyme by decreasing the activity of the wild-type seed 15-fold during the first 2 h of the reaction (data not shown). Inhibition of cysteine proteases by their respective propeptides has been previously observed for cathepsin L (18Carmona E. Dufour E. Plouffe C. Takebe S. Mason P. Mort J.S. Ménard R.

Goodenough P.W. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 59-62Google Scholar), and cathepsin B (20Fox T. de Miguel E. Mort J.S. Storer A.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12571-12576Google Scholar). Evidently, the inhibitory intermediates formed during activation of cathepsin K are proteolytically degraded during the activation of wild-type enzyme due to the concomitant generation of molar equivalents of mature, active enzyme. An active enzyme is not generated in the processing of [Ser139,Ala163]procathepsin K; hence, the reaction stops. To see if the mutant could be completely processed to mature cathepsin K, we activated the mutant in the presence of one equivalent of wild-type pro-cathepsin K. Therefore, active enzyme would be formed in concert with the inhibitory intermediates. This reaction successfully converted the mixture of procathepsin K to mature cathepsin in a nearly quantitative conversion (Fig. 3 C). Since mature cathepsin K is a relatively nonspecific protease, which would be expected to proteolyze an unfolded mutant protein, and extensive proteolysis of mutant procathepsin K was not observed, it seems likely that the mutant procathepsin K is folded properly. The activation of wild-type procathepsin K consists of initial cleavage at three preferred sites, namely residues Glu19, Ser98, and Glu110 as illustrated in Fig. 5. An additional cleavage site is observed in the activation of [Ser139,Ala163]procathepsin K after Ala74. Inspection of the preferred cleavage sites revealed few trends. Cleavage occurred one or two amino acids after each and every proline residue in the propeptide, and at an additional cleavage site, after Ala74, where proline was not present. This led us to postulate that even though cathepsin K has a somewhat broad substrate specificity (13Brömme D. Okamoto K. Wang B.B. Biroc S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2126-2132Google Scholar, 14Bossard M.J. Tomaszek T.A. Thompson S.K. Amegadzie B.Y. Hanning C.R. Jones C. Kurdyla J.T. McNulty D.E. Drake F.H. Gowen M. Levy M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12517-12524Google Scholar), it may prefer sites that possess secondary structural features imparted by a nearby proline residue. A preference for sites containing proline would be conducive for activity with one of its natural substrate, type I collagen, which is proline-rich. The unique site not containing proline lies within a putative consensus motif, Gly-X-Asn-X-Phe-X-Asp, (Fig. 5) found in papain, carcicain, and papaya protease IV, which was postulated to be the site of initial cleavage in the pH-dependent autoactivation of papain (21Vernet T. Berti P.J. de Montigny C. Musil R. Tessier D.C. Ménard R. Magny M.-C. Storer A.C. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10838-10846Google Scholar). The protonation of the aspartic acid residue was postulated to be a trigger for activation. Although the authors could not identify the site of cleavage they speculated it to be between X and Asp, since this would place the preferred phenylalanine residue in the S2 pocket. In the case of cathepsin K, leucine is a preferred residue for P2 (12Shi G.-P. Chapman H.A. Bhairi S.M. Deleeuw C. Reddy V.Y. Weiss S.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 129-134Google Scholar,14Bossard M.J. Tomaszek T.A. Thompson S.K. Amegadzie B.Y. Hanning C.R. Jones C. Kurdyla J.T. McNulty D.E. Drake F.H. Gowen M. Levy M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12517-12524Google Scholar), which predicts cleavage after Ala74, which is consistent with the observed cleavage within this motif in cathepsin K. More information about the structures around the proline residues and the putative consensus motif and their mechanistic implications in cathepsin K autoactivation await the determination of the three dimensional x-ray structure of procathepsin K. If autoprocessing were to occur in vivo, procathepsin K would have to be able to initiate its activation without the aid of mature cathepsin K under the conditions in the bone resorption pit. The spontaneous activation of procathepsin K (Figs. 1 and 2), and the proteolytic cleavage of Z-Phe-Arg-AMC by procathepsin K demonstrates that such a process is possible. In summary, the in vitro activation of cathepsin K is autocatalytic and does not require a different protease. We postulate a similar mechanism is occurring in vivo. Once procathepsin K is secreted into the resorption pit, it undergoes a conformational change induced by the lower pH, which unmasks the active site and makes the propeptide more vulnerable to endoproteolysis. The ensuing activation of procathepsin K in the resorption pit would be accelerated by the action of catalytic amounts of the newly formed mature cathepsin K. Once the propeptide is fragmented at the preferred Pro-X-X sites, it is degraded further by endoproteolysis at less preferred sites, resulting in fully active mature cathepsin K.

We report here that SHIP was tyrosine-phosphorylated after high affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) aggregation in rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells. The tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP was an early event after receptor aggregation and was present in cells deficient in the protein-tyrosine kinase Syk. Furthermore it was not secondary to the increase of intracellular calcium or the activation of protein kinase C. SHIP was precipitated by immobilized phosphorylated synthetic peptides based on the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) of the β but not the γ subunit of the high affinity IgE receptor. Tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP and its association with the tyrosine-phosphorylated β subunit of FcεRI could play an important role in down-regulating receptor-mediated signal transduction in mast cells. Thus, whereas the activation molecule Syk associates with the γ subunit ITAM, the β subunit ITAM binds the negative signaling molecule SHIP. Therefore, unlike B cells where the antigen receptor and coreceptors such as FcγRIIB or CD22 each recruits molecules with opposite effects, the FcεRI contains subunits which recruit molecules that activate and inhibit signal transduction.

This pathway involves the activation of several protein-tyrosine kinases including Lyn, Syk, Btk, and Fak that induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of various proteins (1Benhamou M. Gutkind J.S.

Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. Cell. Signalling. 1995; 7: 535-544Google Scholar). This results in the stimulation of phospholipase A2, C, and D, mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular and extracellular sources, and activation of serine and threonine kinases (4Beaven M.A. Metzger H.

There is also activation of the Ras pathway that may be important for the release of arachidonic acid and its metabolites (6Rider L.G. Hirasawa N. Santini F. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2374-2380Google Scholar). In the Ras pathway, best elucidated in non-mast cells, stimulation of growth factor receptors or antigen receptors on T and B cells results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and the formation of a complex containing Shc, the Grb2 adapter protein, and the nucleotide exchange factor Sos (7Pronk G.J.

Recently this 145-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein was found to be an SH2 domain-containing inositol-polyphosphate 5-phosphatase, which has been called SHIP (13Damen J.E. Liu L. Rosten P. Humphries R.K. Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. Krystal G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1689-1693Google Scholar). In addition to the SH2 domain, SHIP has several tyrosine phosphorylation sites that may interact with other SH2-containing proteins such as Shc and the Syk protein-tyrosine kinase (13Damen J.E.

The high affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) on mast cells and basophils is a tetrameric structure composed of the IgE binding α chain, a β subunit, and disulfide-linked homodimeric γ chains (15Metzger H. Immunol. Rev. 1992; 125: 37-48Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domains of the β and the γ contain a motif with the amino acid sequence (D/E)X2YX2LX6–7YX2(L/I) that is critical for cell activation (16Alber G. Miller L. Jelsema C.L.

Thisimmunoreceptor tyrosine-basedactivation motif (ITAM) is also present in the ζ subunit of the T-cell receptor complex and in Igα and Igβ of the B-cell receptor and is important for cell activation (19Letourneur F.

In B cells and mast cells, cross-linking of ITAM-containing receptors to FcγRIIB results in down-regulatory signals (24Muta T. Kurosaki T. Misulovin Z. Sanchez M. Nussenzweig M.C. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1994; 368: 70-73Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of FcγRIIB contains the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif that recruits negative regulatory molecules such as SHIP and protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 (25D'Ambrosio D.

This phosphorylation was an early event after receptor aggregation but was not secondary to the increase of intracellular calcium or to the activation of protein kinase C. Furthermore the phosphorylation of SHIP did not depend on protein kinase Syk. SHIP was precipitated by immobilized tyrosine-phosphorylated synthetic peptides based on the ITAM of the β but not the γ subunit of the high affinity IgE receptor. Tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP and its association with the receptor may play an important role in down-regulating receptor-mediated signal transduction in mast cells. Protein A, aprotinin, and Triton X-100 were from Sigma. GammaBind plus Sepharose 4B was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Streptavidin coupled to agarose beads was from Pierce. The materials for electrophoresis were purchased from Novex (San Diego, CA), and the source of other materials was as described previously (28Kimura T. Sakamoto H. Appella E. Siraganian R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1471-1478Google Scholar). The non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated peptides based on the sequences of the β and γ subunits of the rat FcεRI (15Metzger H. Immunol.

The sequence of the FcεRIβ peptide was KVPDDRLYEELHVYSPIYSALEDTR, and that of the FcεRIγ peptide was REKSDAVYTGLNTRNQETYETLKHEK. Some of the peptides were also biotinylated as described previously (29Kimura T. Kihara H. Bhattacharyya S. Sakamoto H. Appella E. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol.

Mouse monoclonal anti-Grb2 antibody, mouse monoclonal anti-Shc antibody (S14620), and rabbit polyclonal anti-Shc antibody (S14630) were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY).

The RBL-2H3 cells were maintained as monolayer cultures in Eagle's minimum essential medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), penicillin, and streptomycin (1Benhamou M. Gutkind J.S. Robbins K.C. Siraganian R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5327-5330Google Scholar, 32Barsumian E.L. Isersky C. Petrino M.G. Siraganian R.P. Eur. J.

Med. 1996; 184: 71-79Google Scholar). RBL-2H3 cells were stimulated essentially as described previously (1Benhamou M. Gutkind J.S. Robbins K.C. Siraganian R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5327-5330Google Scholar, 32Barsumian E.L. Isersky C. Petrino M.G. Siraganian R.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1981; 11: 317-323Google Scholar). Briefly, for FcεRI-mediated activation cells were stimulated with either anti-FcεRIα monoclonal antibody (CA5) or with antigen after overnight culture with antigen-specific IgE. In some experiments cells were stimulated with either 0.5 μm calcium ionophore or 40 nm PMA as described previously (34Benhamou M. Stephan V. Robbins K.C. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7310-7314Google Scholar, 35Hamawy M.M. Mergenhagen S. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6851-6854Google Scholar). After stimulation, the monolayers were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized by adding lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 1.0% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 unit/ml aprotinin, 2 mm pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The plates were left on ice for 10 min. The cells were then scraped, and the supernatants were collected and centrifuged for 30 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C as described previously (28Kimura T. Sakamoto H. Appella E. Siraganian R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1471-1478Google Scholar). In experiments designed to deplete extracellular Ca2+, the monolayers were washed with calcium-free Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 10 mm EDTA and stimulated in this medium (34Benhamou M. Stephan V. Robbins K.C. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7310-7314Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, lysates from 107cells in 1.0 ml were precleared by mixing for 90 min at 4 °C with protein A-agarose beads or GammaBind plus Sepharose 4B beads. The lysates were then incubated with each antibody that had been preincubated with 20 μl of beads. After gentle rotation at 4 °C for 90 min, the beads were washed three times with wash buffer (lysis buffer with Triton X-100 concentration decreased to 0.5%), once with 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and the proteins eluted by boiling for 5 min with Laemmli's sample buffer as described previously (28Kimura T. Sakamoto H. Appella E. Siraganian R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1471-1478Google Scholar). For precipitation with ITAM peptides, lysates from 1.5 × 107 cells in 1.0 ml were precleared by mixing for 90 min at 4 °C with streptavidin coupled to agarose beads and then were incubated with biotinylated ITAM peptides that had been preincubated with 20 ml of streptavidin beads. The beads were then washed as described above. Samples from the precipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and electrotransferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected with the monoclonal antibody PY-20 conjugated to horseradish peroxidase as described previously (36Stephan V. Benhamou M. Gutkind J.S. Robbins K.C. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5434-5441Google Scholar). Other proteins were immunoblotted with specific antibodies and then detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A, donkey anti-rabbit IgG, or donkey anti-mouse IgG antibodies. In all blots, proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence. In some experiments antibodies were stripped from the membranes according to the protocol of the manufacturer and then the membranes were reprobed with other antibodies. Cross-linking the high affinity IgE receptor on mast cells results in activation of protein-tyrosine kinases and rapid changes in inositol phosphates (1Benhamou M. Gutkind J.S. Robbins K.C. Siraganian R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5327-5330Google Scholar, 2Benhamou M. Siraganian R.P. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 195-197Google Scholar, 3Hamawy M.M. Mergenhagen S.E. Siraganian R.P. Cell. Signalling. 1995; 7: 535-544Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether the recently described SHIP protein was tyrosine-phosphorylated after receptor aggregation. By immunoblot and immunoprecipitation analysis, SHIP was present in RBL-2H3 cells (Fig. 1). There were proteins of 145, 140, and 105 kDa recognized by the anti-SHIP antibody. The low level tyrosine phosphorylation of the 145-kDa SHIP protein was dramatically enhanced after receptor aggregation. There was also the tyrosine phosphorylation of the 140-kDa protein. Similar data were obtained when FcεRI was stimulated by preincubating the cells with antigen-specific IgE and then adding antigen (see below). As has been reported previously, immunoblot analysis demonstrated the association of SHIP with Shc and Grb2 (data not shown). To further define the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP and its interaction with other molecules, Shc was immunoprecipitated with anti-Shc antibody from non-stimulated or stimulated cells (Fig.2). As previously reported, Shc was already tyrosine-phosphorylated before stimulation, and there were no changes in its tyrosine phosphorylation after receptor aggregation (37Turner H. Reif K. Rivera J. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9500-9506Google Scholar). As expected, SHIP was associated with Shc in these anti-Shc immunoprecipitates. Similar to the previous results, the 145-kDa SHIP protein was tyrosine-phosphorylated in non-stimulated cells, and after receptor aggregation the increase in this phosphorylation was detectable at 3 min with further gradual increase to reach a maximum at 30 min. With stimulation there was also the coprecipitation of the 140- and 105-kDa SHIP proteins. Grb2 was also coimmunoprecipitated with Shc from both non-stimulated and stimulated cells. However, Grb2 did not get tyrosine-phosphorylated, and there was no detectable change in the extent of its association with Shc after receptor aggregation. The SHIP associated with Shc was already tyrosine-phosphorylated in non-stimulated cells (Figs. 2 and 3). In the absence of the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, vanadate, there was no coprecipitation of SHIP with Shc (Fig. 3). However, there was still association of Grb2 with Shc. Therefore, SHIP in this mast cell line was tyrosine-phosphorylated in non-stimulated cells, and its tyrosine phosphorylation was enhanced by receptor aggregation. This phosphorylation was important for its association with Shc.Figure 3Tyrosine phosphorylation is required for the association of SHIP with Shc. RBL-2H3 cells were stimulated with anti-FcεRIα monoclonal antibody for 30 min. The cell lysates were prepared in the presence or absence of vanadate and immunoprecipitated with anti-Shc antibody (2 μg of anti-Shc polyclonal antibody prebound to protein A beads). The precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Anti-PY), stripped, cut into three parts, and immunoblotted with anti-SHIP polyclonal antibody (Anti-SHIP), anti-Shc polyclonal antibody (Anti-Shc), and anti-Grb2 monoclonal antibody (Anti-Grb2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Some proteins are tyrosine-phosphorylated very early after FcεRI aggregation whereas others are phosphorylated at later stages after a rise in intracellular calcium and/or after the activation of protein kinase C (2Benhamou M. Siraganian R.P. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 195-197Google Scholar). Stimulation of cells with either IgE and antigen or with anti-FcεRIα antibodies resulted in an increase in SHIP tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4 A). However, there was no increase in SHIP tyrosine phosphorylation after direct activation of protein kinase C by the addition of PMA or by the addition of the calcium ionophore A23187. To further define the role of Ca2+ in FcεRI-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP, cells were stimulated in a Ca2+-free medium containing EDTA (Fig. 5). The absence of extracellular Ca2+did not affect FcεRI-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP. Therefore, the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP is an early receptor-mediated event that is upstream of the rise in the intracellular calcium and/or the activation of protein kinase C.Figure 5Tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP did not require calcium in the medium. RBL-2H3 cells were stimulated with anti-FcεRIα monoclonal antibody for 30 min in the presence or absence of calcium in the medium. Lysates were then immunoprecipitated with anti-Shc antibodies and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Anti-PY), anti-SHIP polyclonal antibody (Anti-SHIP), anti-Shc polyclonal antibody (Anti-Shc), and anti-Grb2 monoclonal antibody (Anti-Grb2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The protein-tyrosine kinase Syk is essential for FcεRI-mediated degranulation. Although the β and γ subunits of FcεRI are tyrosine-phosphorylated in a Syk-deficient variant of the RBL-2H3 cells, histamine release and phosphorylation of downstream molecules such as phospholipase C are not observed (33Zhang J. Berenstein E.H. Evans R.L. Siraganian R.P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 71-79Google Scholar). Histamine release and phosphorylation of other substrates were reconstituted by the transfection of Syk into these negative cells (33Zhang J. Berenstein E.H. Evans R.L. Siraganian R.P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 71-79Google Scholar). These Syk negative cells were used to evaluate the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP (Fig.4 B). Cells were stimulated by receptor aggregation, the calcium ionophore A23187, or PMA, and the lysates were then immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. There was some constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP in the non-stimulated Syk negative cells. After either IgE-antigen or anti-FcεRIα antibody stimulation there was increased tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP (Fig.4 B). In some experiments this was stronger after IgE-antigen than with anti-FcεRIα antibodies. Similar results were obtained when SHIP was coimmunoprecipitated with anti-Shc antibody (Fig.4 C). The addition of PMA resulted in dephosphorylation of SHIP and a decrease in its coprecipitation with Shc. Therefore, both the constitutive and the FcεRI-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP are independent of the presence of Syk in cells. Furthermore, the receptor-mediated phosphorylation of SHIP was an early event upstream of Syk. In previous studies we observed the association of Shc with tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides based on the ITAM of the β subunit of FcεRI (29Kimura T. Kihara H. Bhattacharyya S. Sakamoto H. Appella E. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27962-27968Google Scholar). As SHIP coprecipitates with Shc, we investigated whether there was an association of SHIP with FcεRI. Synthetic phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated peptides based on the ITAM of the β and γ subunits of FcεRI were used for precipitation studies (Fig. 6). SHIP was precipitated only by the phosphorylated peptide based on the ITAM of FcεRIβ. The immunoblots also suggested that the β-phosphorylated ITAM peptide was precipitating two isoforms of SHIP with slightly different characteristics in migration in SDS-PAGE. To further define the interaction of SHIP with the ITAM synthetic peptide, we compared the proteins precipitated with anti-Shc or anti-SHIP antibodies with those precipitated by the tyrosine-phosphorylated β ITAM peptide (Fig.7). Anti-SHIP antibodies precipitated 145-, 140-, and 105-kDa proteins; the 145-kDa form was the most strongly tyrosine phosphorylated in these non-stimulated cells (Fig. 7 A). This 145-kDa form of SHIP was the major form associated with Shc. In contrast, the β-phosphorylated ITAM precipitated all the isoforms of SHIP (Fig. 7 B). Therefore, the SHIP associated with Shc was predominantly tyrosine phosphorylated, whereas the β ITAM precipitated both non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated SHIP. Altogether these data strongly suggest that the precipitation of SHIP by the β-phosphorylated ITAM is due to direct interaction.Figure 7Comparison of SHIP immunoprecipitated by anti-SHIP or anti-Shc antibodies to that precipitated by phosphorylated synthetic β ITAM peptide. Lysates from 1.5 × 107 non-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells were precipitated with anti-Shc or anti-SHIP polyclonal antibodies (A), with 3 nmol of biotinylated phosphorylated ITAM of FcεRIβ peptide (βPP), or with anti-Shc polyclonal antibody (B). The precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Anti-PY) followed by anti-SHIP polyclonal antibody (Anti-SHIP).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) These experiments identified SHIP as one of the substrates that is tyrosine-phosphorylated after FcεRI aggregation. This tyrosine phosphorylation occurred after receptor stimulation but not when cells were activated with either calcium ionophore or with PMA. Therefore, tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP was not secondary to the increase of intracellular calcium or the activation of protein kinase C. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of SHIP was present even in Syk negative cells indicating that this is an early event upstream of the activation of Syk. SHIP hydrolyzes inositol 1,3,4,5-tetraphosphate with the formation of inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate by a reaction that requires Mg2+ (13Damen J.E. Liu L. Rosten P. Humphries R.K. Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. Krystal G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1689-1693Google Scholar). It also catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate. Inositol 1,3,4,5-tetraphosphate stimulates the release of intracellular Ca2+, which results in activation of the calcium release-activated Ca2+channel, Icrac, and the influx of Ca2+ into the cell (38Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Google Scholar, 39Fasolato C. Hoth M. Penner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20737-20740Google Scholar). In mast cells, receptor aggregation activates phospholipase Cγ1 and phospholipase Cγ2, which results in the formation of inositol phosphates that release Ca2+ from intracellular sources. This is followed by an influx of Ca2+ from extracellular sources mediated by the Icrac channel. Therefore, by decreasing the concentration of inositol 1,3,4,5-tetraphosphate SHIP would limit calcium influx. The tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP does not enhance its enzymatic activity (13Damen J.E. Liu L. Rosten P. Humphries R.K. Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. Krystal G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1689-1693Google Scholar). However, tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP and other proteins could result in SH2-mediated interactions and changes in the cellular localization of SHIP to sites where it could play important physiological roles. Thus, the association of SHIP with Shc and with the tyrosine-phosphorylated β subunit of FcεRI would localize it to membrane sites where there is activation of signaling pathways. The Ras-signaling pathway after FcεRI aggregation results in the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, which is important for the release of arachidonic acid and in regulating nuclear events that result in the synthesis of cytokines (6Rider L.G. Hirasawa N. Santini F. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2374-2380Google Scholar, 8Aronheim A. Engelberg D. Li N. Al-Alawi N. Schlessinger J. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 78: 949-961Google Scholar, 40Hirasawa N. Santini F. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5391-5402Google Scholar, 41Offermanns S. Jones S.V.P. Bombien E. Schultz G. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 250-261Google Scholar). In the case of antigen receptors on T and B cells, activation of this pathway is initiated by the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc which then forms a complex with Grb2-Sos and activates p21ras (7Pronk G.J. De Vries-Smits A.M.M. Buday L. Downward J. Maassen J.A. Medema R.H. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1575-1581Google Scholar, 8Aronheim A. Engelberg D. Li N. Al-Alawi N. Schlessinger J. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 78: 949-961Google Scholar). However, Shc is constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated in non-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells, and this phosphorylation may be increased after FcεRI aggregation (37Turner H. Reif K. Rivera J. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9500-9506Google Scholar). Shc also associates with the tyrosine-phosphorylated β subunit of FcεRI (29Kimura T. Kihara H. Bhattacharyya S. Sakamoto H. Appella E. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27962-27968Google Scholar). Therefore, the tyrosine-phosphorylated β subunit of FcεRI could bind SHIP either directly or indirectly by binding mediated by Shc. The extent of the tyrosine phosphorylation of the β subunit would determine how much SHIP was recruited to the receptor and thereby regulate and/or limit the extent of the signals generated by the receptor. In the present model for mast cell signaling, the earliest event after aggregation of FcεRI is the activation of protein-tyrosine kinase, probably Lyn, which results in tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor subunits (42Paolini R. Jouvin M.H. Kinet J.P. Nature. 1991; 353: 855-858Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain of FcεRIβ and the cytoplasmic domain of FcεRIγ contain ITAMs that once they are tyrosine-phosphorylated preferentially bind different downstream signaling molecules (29Kimura T. Kihara H. Bhattacharyya S. Sakamoto H. Appella E. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27962-27968Google Scholar). Thus, we recently observed that a synthetic tyrosine-diphosphorylated peptide based on the ITAM sequence of the β subunit of FcεRI precipitated Shc, phospholipase Cγ1, and Lyn, whereas the similar peptide based on the ITAM of γ did not bind these molecules but was very effective in binding Syk (29Kimura T. Kihara H. Bhattacharyya S. Sakamoto H. Appella E. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27962-27968Google Scholar). The binding of Syk to the tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAM results in a conformational change in Syk with an increase in its enzymatic activity and the downstream propagation of signals such as the tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ1, phospholipase Cγ2, and the influx of calcium (28Kimura T. Sakamoto H. Appella E. Siraganian R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1471-1478Google Scholar). Therefore, tyrosine phosphorylation of the ITAM of the γ subunit recruits Syk, which is critical in downstream activating signals. In contrast the ITAM based on the β subunit, once it is phosphorylated, recruits other molecules such as Shc and SHIP, which are important for activating and regulating signaling events. While these experiments were in progress two reports appeared that suggest that SHIP may play a role in the negative regulation of signaling in B cells or in mast cells (43Chacko G.W. Tridandapani S. Damen J.E. Liu L. Krystal G. Coggeshall K.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2234-2238Google Scholar, 44Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Google Scholar). The optimal tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP occurred when the B-cell receptor was coclustered with FcγRIIB (43Chacko G.W. Tridandapani S. Damen J.E. Liu L. Krystal G. Coggeshall K.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2234-2238Google Scholar). Such coclustering results in decreased signaling from the B-cell receptor. In mast cells, SHIP associated with the FcγRIIB that was coclustered with FcεRI (44Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Google Scholar). These are conditions that resulted in a decrease in FcεRI-mediated signaling (45Daeron M. Latour S. Malbec O. Espinosa E. Pina P. Pasmans S. Fridman W.H. Immunity. 1995; 3: 635-646Google Scholar). The coclustering of the immune receptor with FcγRIIB probably results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of FcγRIIB and the recruitment of SHIP. In the present experiments we found that in fact the β subunit of FcεRI has a domain that can recruit SHIP to the receptor. SHIP most probably binds to the amino acid sequence SPIYSAL that is similar to the (T/S)XXYXX(L/I) immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif present in FcγRIIB (24Muta T. Kurosaki T. Misulovin Z. Sanchez M. Nussenzweig M.C. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1994; 368: 70-73Google Scholar, 26Thomas M.L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1953-1956Google Scholar). However, unlike this inhibiting motif in FcγRIIB, we could not detect any binding of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 to the β-phosphorylated ITAM peptide. 2T. Kimura, H. Sakamoto, E. Apella, and R. P. Siraganian, unpublished observations. Therefore, unlike B cells where the antigen receptor and coreceptors such as FcγRIIB or CD22 each recruit molecules with opposite effects, the FcεRI contains subunits that recruit molecules that activate and inhibit signal transduction.

Solar ultraviolet radiation is a ubiquitous environmental carcinogen responsible for 500,000 or more new cases of skin cancer in the United States each year (1Scotto J. Fears T.R. Fraumeni Jr. J.F.

Photobiol. 1990; 52: 1119-1136Google Scholar). Exposure of human cells to natural sunlight leads to the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs), 1The abbreviations used are: CPD, cyclobutane-type pyrimidine dimer; NER, nucleotide-excision repair; PRR, post-replication repair; RFI, closed circular replicative form I; RFII, nicked circular replicative form II; T4 endoV, bacteriophage T4 endonuclease V; Tag, SV40 large T antigen; T[c,s]T,cis,syn-cyclobutane thymine dimer; XPV, xeroderma pigmentosum variant; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s); SF, single fork. pyrimidine(6–4)pyrimidone dimers, and their Dewar valence isomers (3Clingen P.H. Arlett C.F. Roza L. Mori T. Nikaido O. Green M.H.L. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2245-2248Google Scholar). UV-induced DNA photoproducts are currently accepted as important underlying factors in skin carcinogenesis (2Ananthaswamy H.N. Pierceall W.E. Photochem. Photobiol. 1990; 52: 1119-1136Google Scholar, 4International Agency for Research on Cancer Working Group IARC Monogr. Eval. Carcinog. Risks Hum. 1992; 55: 43-279Google Scholar). Studies with UVC (254 nm), which forms predominantly CPDs (70–80%) and 6–4 dimers (20–30%), have indicated that mutations and chromosomal aberrations are induced when human cells attempt to replicate the damaged DNA (5Watanabe M. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J. Mutat. Res. 1985; 146: 285-294Google Scholar, 6Kaufmann W.K. Wilson S.J. Mutat. Res. 1994; 314: 67-76Google Scholar). Therefore, the mechanisms whereby human cells complete the replication of template strands containing photoproducts are of considerable interest. UVC inhibits DNA replication in diploid human fibroblast strains by a variety of mechanisms, including G1 arrest (6Kaufmann W.K. Wilson S.J. Mutat. Res. 1994; 314: 67-76Google Scholar) and inhibition of replicon initiation in S phase cells (7Kaufmann W.K. Cleaver J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 149: 171-187Google Scholar). These two checkpoint responses appear to be protective processes, providing more time for DNA repair to remove photoproducts before DNA replication. UVC also induces inhibition of DNA synthesis in active replicons (7Kaufmann W.K. Cleaver J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 149: 171-187Google Scholar, 8Boyer J.C. Kaufmann W.K. Brylawski B.P. Cordeiro-Stone M. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 2593-2598Google Scholar). The latter is thought to reflect, at least in part, the stalling of DNA replication forks at pyrimidine dimers (9Edenberg H.J. Biophys. J. 1976; 16: 849-860Google Scholar, 10Meneghini R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 425: 419-427Google Scholar, 11Meneghini R. Hanawalt P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 425: 428-437Google Scholar), perhaps due to a reduced capacity of DNA polymerases to incorporate DNA precursors into nascent strands opposite template lesions (12Moore P. Strauss B.S. Nature. 1979; 278: 664-666Google Scholar, 13Moore P.D. Bose K.K. Rabkin S.D. Strauss B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 110-114Google Scholar, 14O'Day C.L. Burgers P.M.J. Taylor J.-S.

This inhibition, however, is not absolute, and bypass replication eventually takes place, as evidenced by the generation of replicated DNA containing photoproducts and the induction of point mutations at dipyrimidine sites. UV-induced mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene in non-melanoma skin cancers are characterized by a high proportion of C → T transitions (16Ziegler A. Leffell D.J. Kunala S. Sharma H.W. Gailani M. Simon J.A. Halperin A.J. Baden H.P. Shapiro P.E. Bale A.E. Brash D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4216-4220Google Scholar, 17Ziegler A. Jonason A.S. Leffell D.J. Simon J.A.

Base substitution mutations at thymines do not occur with high frequency in UV-damaged genes that are replicated at their natural chromosomal locations (19McGregor W.G. Chen R.-H. Lukash L. Maher V.M. McCormick J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1927-1934Google Scholar) or as part of shuttle vectors (20Bredberg A. Kraemer K.H. Seidman M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Seidman M.M. Bredberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3782-3786Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that protein extracts from HeLa cells are capable of replicating past CPDs during in vitroreplication of UV-damaged plasmids carrying the SV40 origin of replication (23Carty M.P. Hauser J. Levine A.S. Dixon K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 533-542Google Scholar, 24Thomas D.C. Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7744-7748Google Scholar, 25Svoboda D.L.

Experimental evidence in support of this conclusion was found primarily by probing for the presence of sites sensitive to nicking by the CPD-specific enzyme, T4 endonuclease V (T4 endoV), in replicated (DpnI-resistant), closed circular DNA molecules (23Carty M.P. Hauser J. Levine A.S. Dixon K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 533-542Google Scholar, 24Thomas D.C. Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7744-7748Google Scholar, 25Svoboda D.L.

In addition, UV-induced mutagenesis at dipyrimidine sites of randomly damaged plasmids (almost exclusively C → T) presumably reflected error-prone bypass replication (trans-lesion synthesis) of CPDs (23Carty M.P. Hauser J. Levine A.S. Dixon K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 533-542Google Scholar, 24Thomas D.C. Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7744-7748Google Scholar). Bypass replication of a single dimer strategically placed on one or the other anti-parallel strand of DNA has also been examined (25Svoboda D.L. Vos J.-M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11975-11979Google Scholar, 26Carty M.P. Lawrence C.W. Dixon K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9637-9647Google Scholar). Inference as to whether bypass replication occurred via leading or lagging strand synthesis was made on the basis of the location and orientation of the dimer, vis à vis the SV40 origin of replication, and the probability of first encounter of the CPD by one or the other of the replication forks moving in opposite direction around the circular molecule. By measuring the relative synthesis of complementary strands at restriction fragments spanning the dimer or located immediately downstream, Svoboda and Vos (25Svoboda D.L. Vos J.-M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11975-11979Google Scholar) have concluded that when the pyrimidine dimer is on the template to the leading strand the synthesis of the latter is interrupted, but the synthesis of the lagging strand continues, presumably by displacement of the replication fork beyond the lesion. In this study, we have analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis the topology of replicating molecules to map the displacement of DNA replication forks, in relationship to the position of the CPD, and to demonstrate directly the capability for leading strand bypass replication in human cells. Carty et al. (26Carty M.P. Lawrence C.W. Dixon K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9637-9647Google Scholar) have recently reported that in vitro bypass replication of a single TT site containing either a CPD or a 6–4 dimer is poorly mutagenic. Studies of the familial skin cancer syndrome, xeroderma pigmentosum, have revealed a form of the disease, in which a major biochemical defect in nucleotide excision repair (NER) was not detected, hence the designation of this group as variant (27Jung E.G.

Our results demonstrate that replication-competent extracts from XPV cells are deficient in the bypass of CPDs, under conditions in which other human cell extracts are capable of catalyzing this process.

Preparations of T4 endoV were provided by Dr. Isabel Mellon (University of Kentucky) and Dr. Stephen Lloyd (University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston). The oligonucleotide containing the single T[c,s]T dimer was a gift from Dr. Aziz Sancar (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill). Undamaged oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Nucleic Acids Core Facility of the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center. Eagle's minimal essential medium and l-glutamine were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal bovine serum was obtained from HyClone Laboratories Inc. (Logan, UT), and gentamicin came from Elkins-Sinn Inc. (Cherry Hill, NJ). HeLa S3 cells were obtained from the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center Tissue Culture Facility (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill).

[α-32P]dCTP (>3000 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Life Sciences, and unlabeled nucleotides were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Creatine phosphate, creatine phosphokinase, and proteinase K were from Sigma. The SV40-transformed cell lines used in this study were derived from XPV fibroblasts, XP4BE (CTag, Ref. 44King S.A. Wilson S.J. Farber R.A. Kaufmann W.K. Cordeiro-Stone M. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 100-108Google Scholar), and XP30RO (XP30RO/9.8, Ref. 45Volpe J.P.G. Cleaver J.E. Mutat.

Monolayer cultures were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Extracts were prepared according to published protocols (48Li J.J. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6973-6977Google Scholar, 49Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. Methods Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 295-313Google Scholar). The sequence 5′-GAGCTCAATTAGTCAGCTGC-3′ was introduced into the lacZα sequence of M13mp2SV (50Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7064-7068Google Scholar) by site-directed mutagenesis (51Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Google Scholar). This insertion created a unique XhoI and an additional PvuII recognition site in this new construct (M13leaSV, see Fig. 1). Double-stranded, closed circular DNA molecules containing a single pyrimidine dimer were synthesized by annealing closed circular, single-stranded M13leaSV DNA (+ strand), with the oligonucleotide 3′-CTCGAG(T[c,s]T)AATCAGTCGACG-5′, previously phosphorylated at the 5′-end using T4 polynucleotide kinase. This was followed by second-strand synthesis, ligation, and purification in CsCl density gradients, according to published procedures (52Huang J.-C. Svoboda D.L. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3664-3668Google Scholar). Undamaged DNA controls included RFI of M13leaSV or molecules prepared as described above but using an oligonucleotide without the dimer. Reactions of 25 or 50 μl contained 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 7 mmMgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 200 μm each of the other three rNTPs, 100 μm each of the four dNTPs, 100–150 μCi/ml [α-32P]dCTP, 40 mmcreatine phosphate, 100 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 15 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1.6 μg/ml M13leaSV DNA, 40 μg/ml SV40 large T antigen (Tag), 4 mg/ml proteins from human cell extracts (49Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. Methods Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 295-313Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures without Tag were used as negative controls. After incubation at 37 °C for different periods, the reactions were terminated by adding an equal volume of stop solution containing 2% SDS, 2 mg/ml proteinase K, and 50 mm EDTA. In those experiments in which the goal was to quantify specific DNA products fractionated by single dimension agarose gel electrophoresis, an identical amount of linear pUC19 DNA (end-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by in vitro polymerization at the HindIII cut site) was also added to each reaction. Replication products were purified by one or two extractions with an equal volume of a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of phenol and chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1 v/v), followed by a final extraction with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and then ethanol precipitation. DNA was routinely dissolved in 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and fractionated in 1% agarose gels containing 0.2 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Dried gels were analyzed with an AMBIS Image Acquisition & Analysis system (AMBIS, Inc., San Diego, CA) or exposed to a phosphor screen that was later scanned by a PhosphorImager™ (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). DNA replication products from either control or T[c,s]T dimer-containing templates were purified as above and incubated in the presence or absence of T4 endoV. The enzyme preparation received from Dr. Isabel Mellon (485 μg/ml; 2.7 × 1010 nicks/min/μl) was used without dilution at 1 μl per 20-μl reaction containing in vitro replication products in 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. These reactions were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The T4 endoV received from Dr. Stephen Lloyd (stock solution at ∼150 μg/ml) was first diluted 250 or 1000 times in reaction buffer. DNA replication products in 25 mm NaH2PO4, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin were mixed with 1 μl of the diluted T4 endoV and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by adding one-fifth final volume of a solution containing 50% glycerol, 0.04% bromphenol blue, and 10% SDS. Subsequent to electrophoresis, the dried gels were analyzed as above. DNA replication products were purified from 30-min reactions and digested with the indicated restriction enzyme(s). Electrophoresis was first carried out at 0.4 V/cm for approximately 68 h in 0.4% agarose gels prepared in 45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA (TBE), also containing 0.2 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Excised lanes were cast into a second gel containing 1% agarose and 0.2 μg/ml ethidium bromide in TBE. The second electrophoresis, at a 90° angle with respect to the first, was run at 1.5 V/cm for approximately 24 h. The dried gels were exposed to a phosphor screen and scanned by a PhosphorImager™. AMBIS QuantProbe Software or ImageQuaNT™ (Molecular Dynamics) was used to determine the amount of radioactivity associated with DNA by volume integration of defined regions of the scanned images. Objects were drawn with the rectangle or polygon tool to closely surround the areas of interest. In single dimensional gel electrophoresis analyses, all DNA species were included within a single object for the measurement of total DNA synthesis; specific forms (e.g. RFI and RFII) were quantified individually. Lane specific background was defined by a rectangle drawn under the pUC19 band. Integrated volumes (net counts) were then normalized to pUC19 recovered in each lane. In experiments in which we incubated DNA with T4 endoV prior to gel electrophoresis, we noticed that we systematically lost a small fraction of the radiolabel incorporated at the ends of the linearized pUC19 molecules. Since this internal standard was added to each sample at the end of the in vitro replication reaction, the control (no enzyme addition) and treated samples contained the same ratio of total replication products to pUC19. We calculated this ratio for control samples and estimated the volume of pUC19 from the volume of total replication products for lanes containing T4 endoV. Then, this estimated volume of the internal standard was used to normalize the relative units of precursor incorporation in RFI and RFII. Analyses of the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis images acquired with the PhosphorImager™ were done with the polygon tool and ImageQuaNT™. Only replication-intermediate arcs were quantified; volume integration was done with no background correction. The integrated volumes of bubble and fork arcs were expressed as percentages of the sum of all replicating structures detected in each image. The percentage distribution determined with the dimer-containing molecule was compared with that observed with the undamaged DNA. Fig. 1 shows the position of thecis,syn-cyclobutane thymine dimer relative to the SV40 origin of replication in the double-stranded and closed circular molecule (7.4 kb) that was used as the site-specifically damaged substrate in the in vitro replication assays described below. These assays are dependent on Tag-directed initiation of replication at the SV40 origin and semi-conservative DNA synthesis (55Li J.J. Kelly T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1238-1246Google Scholar) by two replication forks moving away from the origin in opposite directions (bi-directional replication). Note that in this construct, the replication fork moving from the origin toward the singleEcoRI recognition site encounters the pyrimidine dimer (T[c,s]T) on the template to the leading strand of nascent DNA, 385 bp from the center of the SV40 origin of replication (Fig. 1). Dimer-containing and undamaged plasmids were replicated in vitro with extracts from human cells. Radiolabeled products were analyzed for the degree of inhibition of RFI synthesis by the pyrimidine dimer and to determine whether the T[c,s]T was present in the newly synthesized, closed circular DNA molecules. In this experimental system, the generation of dimer-containing RFI DNA could proceed along two potentially distinct pathways (Fig. 2). If the dimer blocks one of the forks, at least momentarily (Fig. 2 A), the other replication fork displacing in the opposite direction could complete synthesis around the circular DNA. This would generate an RFI from the undamaged strand and potentially leave the dimer in a gapped molecule. Following segregation of the daughter molecules, it is conceivable that other activities, such as gap-filling repair, could be responsible for completing synthesis across the pyrimidine dimer to form the dimer-containing RFI. Fig. 2 B depicts the displacement of the right replication fork up to and beyond the pyrimidine dimer, thus catalyzing bypass replication, presumably by extension of the leading strand. As both pathways depicted in Fig. 2 could be operational duringin vitro replication, it would be premature to conclude how bypass replication has taken place only from the position and orientation of the dimer in relationship to the origin of replication. Therefore, it became imperative to distinguish which pathway was more likely to be followed during replication of damaged DNA moleculesin vitro, to investigate potential mechanisms of dimer bypass and later evaluate biological consequences of placing the lesion on the template to the leading or lagging strand of nascent DNA. Fig. 3 illustrates the fractionation of in vitro replication products from reactions in which dimer-containing and control DNA were incubated with extracts from HeLa cells or XPV (CTag) fibroblasts. Results with extracts from other human fibroblasts are shown in Fig. 4. The amounts of total DNA replication products and RFI were estimated from their radioactivity (AMBIS™ or PhosphorImage™ units) after normalization to the internal standard (pUC19). Total DNA synthesis using the HeLa extract was not inhibited by the dimer. DNA synthesis on the damaged molecule averaged 98 ± 27% (mean ± S.D., n= 20) that on the undamaged molecule in experiments in which the incubation time varied from 1 to 6 h. In contrast, total DNA synthesis on the damaged molecule using the CTag extract was 69 ± 23% control (n = 15, p < 0.01, CTagversus HeLa, Student's t test). Synthesis of RFI DNA from the dimer-containing substrate was severely reduced in the CTag extract (27 ± 9%, n = 15) in comparison to HeLa (72 ± 22%, n = 19), and this difference was highly significant (p < 0.005). Thus, by two different measures of DNA synthesis, extracts from XPV cells were impaired relative to HeLa in their capacity to replicate a circular DNA molecule that contained a single pyrimidine dimer. Experiments with extracts from SV40-transformed fibroblasts (IDH4, SV80, XPA) yielded results that were comparable to those described for HeLa extracts. In the experiments illustrated in Fig. 4, for example, RFI synthesis from the T[c,s]T-containing molecules represented 86% (IDH4), 78% (SV80), and 53% (XPA) that determined with the undamaged control.Figure 4Extracts from human fibroblasts support the replication of T[c,s]T-containing plasmids, regardless of their NER capability. Template molecules containing the T[c,s]T dimer (lanes 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, and 10) or not (control inlanes 3, 4, 7, 8, 11, and 12) were replicatedin vitro during 2-h reactions with extracts from fibroblasts that are endowed with wild-type activity for NER (IDH4, lanes 1–4; SV80, lanes 5–8) or are defective in this process (XPA, NER-mutant, lanes 9–12). DNA was purified and incubated in the presence (+) or absence (−) of T4 endoV, as described under “Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) RFI that contains a CPD is nicked by T4 endoV and converted to RFII with reduced electrophoretic mobility. By measuring the fraction of newly synthesized RFI DNA that is resistant to nicking by T4 endoV, one can calculate the fraction that carries the dimer (fraction sensitive to nicking). We determined that 0.43 ± 0.03 (n = 5) corresponded to the fraction of RFI DNA, produced during in vitro reactions (1.5 to 6 h) with the HeLa extract, that was nicked by T4 endoV (Fig. 3 and Table I). Under identical conditions, the nicked fraction of RFI synthesized from undamaged DNA by the same extract was 0.09 ± 0.08 (n = 5). By correcting for this background we found that 34% of the RFI DNA synthesized from the T[c,s]T-containing template by HeLa carried the dimer (theoretical maximum of 50%). Similar calculations with the data depicted in Fig. 4 revealed the presence of the dimer in 45, 52, and 54% of the RFI molecules newly synthesized by IDH4, SV80, and XPA extracts, respectively (Table I). In contrast, the small amount of RFI synthesized by the XPV (CTag) extract from the damaged molecule (Fig.3) demonstrated the same sensitivity to nicking by T4 endoV as the RFI products from undamaged DNA (Table I). We interpreted these results as evidence that the CTag extract was unable to complete synthesis of the template strand containing the pyrimidine dimer. Similar results were also obtained with XP30RO extracts (not shown).Table IT4 endonuclease V-sensitive sites in RFI DNA synthesized in vitroExtract sourceIncubation timeNicked fractionControl moleculeT[c,s]T-moleculeDimer-dependenthA.

This ratio (T4 endonuclease V-resistant fraction) was subtracted from 1 to determine the nicked fraction. The dimer-dependent fraction was the difference"

Mixed oligonucleotides based on the peptide sequences were used as primers to obtain a probe fragment by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using CHO cell poly(A)+ RNA as template.

Such a broad range of functions of heparin and HS may depend on their characteristic structures, with a high degree of microheterogeneity resulting mainly from the different position and extent of sulfation, which may lead to the specific interactions in a “lock-and-key” manner with various proteins involved in the above biological events. For example, N-deacetylation andN-sulfation of N-acetylglucosamine residues and 2-O-sulfation of iduronic acid residues in HS are essential steps in constructing the domain structure in HS for the binding of basic fibroblast growth factor (10Habuchi H. Suzuki S. Saito T. Tamura T. Harada T. Yoshida K. Kimata K. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 805-813Google Scholar), and the binding was found to be critical for its biological activity (7Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Google Scholar, 8Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Google Scholar, 9Klagsbrun M. Baird A. Cell. 1991; 67: 229-231Google Scholar). Since HS is a ubiquitous component in most, if not all, tissues (13Nader H.B. Dietrich C.P. Lane D.A. Lindahl U. Heparin. Edward Arnold, London1989: 81-96Google Scholar), it is likely that the regulation and biosynthetic mechanism of HS are implicated in various biological functions of HS as described above, compared with those of heparin, which is found only in connective tissue mast cells. Heparin and HS share similar biosynthetic processes (14Lindahl U. Kusche M. Lidholt K. Oscarsson L.G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 556: 36-50Google Scholar), beginning with the polymerization reaction that produces polysaccharide chain composed of alternating GlcA and GlcNAc units (15Lidholt K. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 21-29Google Scholar). The resulting disaccharide repeats, (-GlcAβ1,4-GlcNAcα1,4-)n, subsequently receive a series of reactions as follows: N-deacetylation of GlcNAc and furtherN-sulfation, C-5 epimerization of GlcA to IdceA, 2-O-sulfation of IdceA, and 6-O- and 3-O-sulfation of N-sulfoglucosamine. However, heparin and HS are different in many respects. Heparin usually contains more N- and O-sulfated groups and more IdceA than HS (14Lindahl U. Kusche M. Lidholt K. Oscarsson L.G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 556: 36-50Google Scholar). These distinctive characteristics may suggest some differences in their biosynthetic process and regulation.N-Deacetylase/N-sulfotransferases have been purified from (HS-producing) rat liver (16Brandan E. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2417-2422Google Scholar) as well as from (heparin-producing) mouse mastocytoma (17Pettersson I. Kusche M. Unger E. Wlad H. Nylund L. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8044-8049Google Scholar). Molecular cloning studies have shown that they are closely related, but are different proteins (18Hashimoto Y. Orellana A. Gil G. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15744-15750Google Scholar, 19Eriksson I. Sandbäck D. Ek B. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10438-10443Google Scholar, 20Orellana A. Hirschberg C.B. Wei Z. Swiedler S.J. Ishihara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2270-2276Google Scholar). This appears to be also the case withO-sulfotransferases. Wlad et al. (21Wlad H. Maccarana M. Eriksson I. Kjellén L. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24538-24541Google Scholar) have recently purified an ∼60-kDa enzyme capable of catalyzing both the 2-O- and 6-O-sulfotransferase reactions from mouse mastocytoma tissue, whereas we have separately purified ∼44-kDa heparan-sulfate 2-sulfotransferase (HS2ST) (22Kobayashi M. Habuchi H. Habuchi O. Saito M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7645-7653Google Scholar) and ∼52-kDa heparan-sulfate 6-sulfotransferase (HS6ST) (23Habuchi H. Habuchi O. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4172-4179Google Scholar) from the cell extract and the spent medium of (HS-producing) Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell culture, respectively, suggesting that ourO-sulfotransferases and that of Wlad et al. may be distinct from each other. Taking into consideration these differences, the molecular organization of the O- andN-sulfation processes seems different between heparin and HS. Cloning of genes for O-sulfotransferases and obtaining antibodies against these low abundant proteins may be important not only to clarify the possible difference in the sulfation process between HS and heparin, but also to determine whether each sulfation in the Golgi apparatus is subcompartmentalized and how each enzyme activity is regulated within the membrane. In this study, we cloned the cDNA encoding HS2ST in CHO cells, which catalyzes the transfer of sulfate from 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate specifically to IdceA at position 2 in HS. The possible protein structure and properties predicted from the deduced amino acid sequence were consistent with those observed with the purified enzyme. In addition, the expression of the cDNA in COS-7 cells by transfection caused a preferential increase in the activity of HS2ST. We discuss the biological significance of this cloning. Partially purified HS2ST was obtained by elution from the second 3′,5′-ADP-agarose column as described previously (22Kobayashi M. Habuchi H. Habuchi O. Saito M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7645-7653Google Scholar). A portion of the purified HS2ST was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% gel) according to the method of Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) after reduction and denaturation in loading buffer containing 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. The protein separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was then electrotransferred onto ProBlott polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Applied Biosystems). The transferred protein was visualized with Ponceau S according to Aebersold et al. (25Aebersold R.H. Leavitt J. Saavedra R.A. Hood L.E. Kent S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6970-6974Google Scholar). The band migrating at ∼44 kDa was excised and subjected to reduction and S-carboxymethylation on the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane according to Iwamatsu (26Iwamatsu A. Electrophoresis. 1992; 13: 142-147Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, the membrane-blotted protein was reduced at room temperature in 8 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 5% (v/v) acetonitrile, and 0.33% (w/v) dithiothreitol and then alkylated by the addition of iodoacetic acid in 1 n NaOH. The S-carboxymethylated protein on the membrane was then incubated at room temperature with 0.5% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone in 100 mm acetic acid and 0.33% methionine and washed with 10% (v/v) acetonitrile. The minced membrane was treated with 0.3 units of N-glycanase in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 37 °C for 15 h. Sequential digestions with endoproteinase Lys-C and then endoproteinase Asp-N were performed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, and 10% acetonitrile at 37 °C and in 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8, 25 mm CaCl2, and 10% acetonitrile, respectively, at 40 °C for 24 h at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:50 (mol/mol). Each endoproteinase digest was lyophilized and dissolved in solvent A (1% acetonitrile in 0.06% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid). The generated peptides were separated on a reverse-phase column (0.3 × 150 mm) by capillary high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Elution of the peptides was carried out with a gradient of 2–100% solvent B (80% acetonitrile in 0.052% trifluoroacetic acid). The peptide fractions were collected by monitoring the absorbance at 214 nm and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Their amino acid sequences were analyzed with a Model 476A protein sequenator (Applied Biosystems). Peptides 1 and 2 (see Table I) were used to design degenerate oligonucleotide outer and inner primers (sense 1s and 1si or antisense 2a and 2ai) with deoxyinosine substitution as shown in Fig. 1 A. The first strand of cDNA was synthesized by the reverse transcriptase reaction using poly(A)+ RNA from CHO cells as template and oligo(dT) as primer and was then used as template for PCR. The first PCR was carried out using a pair of outer primers (1s and 2a), and the second PCR was carried out using the first PCR product as template and a pair of inner primers (1si and 2ai). Reaction products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis (see Fig. 1 B). An amplified DNA band of ∼90 bp was excised, and the DNA fragment was recovered from the gel using Jetsorb (Genomed) and subcloned into theEcoRV site of pBluescript (Stratagene). These subclones were characterized by sequencing. The radioactive probe used for screening the cDNA library was prepared from the PCR product amplified in the mixture containing primers 1s and 2a, the subcloned 90-bp DNA as template, and [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Corp.).Table IAmino acid sequences of peptides after in situ digestion of cultured CHO, cell HS2ST with endoproteinase Lys-C followed by endoproteinase Asp-NPeptideAmino acid sequence1DL(C)AKNRYHVLH(I)2DQ(V)RFVK(N)(I)3DXYRPGLX(R)4D(I)V(I)XYN(R)5D(L)YRAmino acid sequences of different peptides after in situdigestion of purified CHO cell HS2ST with endoproteinase followed by endoproteinase Asp-N Lys-C were obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Amino acids within parentheses are tentative identifications.

Open table in a new tab Amino acid sequences of different peptides after in situdigestion of purified CHO cell HS2ST with endoproteinase followed by endoproteinase Asp-N Lys-C were obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Amino acids within parentheses are tentative identifications. X represents an unidentified amino acid residue. The CHO cDNA library in the Uni-ZAP XR vector (purchased from Stratagene) was constructed from poly(A)+ RNA from CHO cells and oligo(dT) as primer atEcoRI and XhoI recognition sites of the pBluescript SK− plasmid in the Uni-ZAP XR vector. The host strain Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue cells were infected with phage from the library and plated at 2–4 × 104plaque-forming units/dish. Approximately 1.4 × 106plaques were screened by hybridization with 32P-labeled probe as recommended by the manufacturer. The pBluescript plasmid from the positive clones was excised from the Uni-ZAP XR vector according to the Stratagene in vivo excision protocol using ExAssist helper phage and E. coli SOLR. pBluescript plasmid DNA was purified from SOLR cells carrying the pBluescript plasmid using QIAGEN plasmid kits. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned cDNA was determined by repeated sequencing of both strands of alkaline-denatured plasmid DNA using deaza-GTP kits with Sequenase Version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). DNA synthesis was primed by T3, T7, and internal primers situated ∼250 base pairs apart. The DNA sequences thus obtained were compiled and analyzed using GENETYX-MAC computer programs (Software Development Co., Ltd., Tokyo). The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were compared with other protein sequences in the nucleic acid and protein data bases (EMBL Gene Data Bank Release 44 and NBRF Protein Data Bank Release 45). Poly(A)+ RNA prepared from cultured CHO cells was denatured and electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose gel containing 6% (v/v) formaldehyde. After treatment with 50 mm NaOH and neutralization in 20 × SSC, the RNA on the gel was transferred to a Hybond N+ nylon membrane overnight and fixed by treatment with 50 mm NaOH. The RNA fixed on the membrane was prehybridized in a solution containing 50% formamide, 5 × SSPE, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Hybridization was carried out in the same buffer containing32P-labeled probe (1 × 106 cpm/ml) at 42 °C for 16 h. A 1145-bp fragment at positions 113–1257 was prepared by digestion with SmaI and AflII of clone K3 inserted into pBluescript (see Fig. 2 A) and radiolabeled for the probe by the random oligonucleotide-primed labeling method using [α-32P]dCTP and a Ready-To-Go DNA labeling kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Uppsala). The membrane was washed at 65 °C in 1 × SSPE and 0.1% SDS and subsequently in 0.1 × SSPE and 0.1% SDS. The membrane was then exposed to x-ray film. For the construction of pcDNA3HS2ST, theEcoRI-AflII fragment containing the open reading frame of 1280 bp from positions −23 to 1257 (AflII site) shown in Fig. 2 A was excised from the K3 clone and ligated into the EcoRI and ApaI sites of the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). The AflII end from the K3 clone and the ApaI end from pcDNA3 were blunted with T4 DNA polymerase before the EcoRI digestion. For the construction of pFLAG-CMV-2HS2ST, the SacII-AflII fragment (positions −7 to 1257) from the K3 clone was blunted and ligated into the EcoRV site of the pFLAG-CMV-2 expression vector (Eastman Kodak Co.). The plasmid (pFLAG-CMV-2R) that contained the cDNA fragment in the reverse orientation was also constructed. The plasmids were analyzed by restriction mapping to confirm the correct orientation of the inserted cDNA. COS-7 cells were plated onto 60-mm culture dishes containing 3 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Cytosystems Pty. Ltd.), and cells were grown at 37 °C. When the cells were 60–70% confluent, COS-7 cells were transfected with pcDNA3HS2ST or pcDNA3 alone and, in another experiment, with pFLAG-CMV-2HS2ST, pFLAG-CMV-2R, or pFLAG-CMV-2 alone. The transfection was performed using the DEAE-dextran method (27Aruffo A. Ausubel F.M Brent R. Kingstone R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley-Interscience, New York1991: 16.13.1-16.13.7Google Scholar). After incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal bovine serum containing antibiotics for 67 h, the spent medium was collected, and the cell layers (2 × 106 cells) were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium alone, scraped, and homogenized in 1 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.15m NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 20% (v/v) glycerol. The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min, and the activities of HS2ST, HS6ST, and chondroitinO-sulfotransferase in the supernatant fractions (cell extracts) were measured as described previously (22Kobayashi M. Habuchi H. Habuchi O. Saito M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7645-7653Google Scholar, 23Habuchi H. Habuchi O. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4172-4179Google Scholar). In another experiment, FLAG (-DYKDDDDK-) fusion proteins in the cell extracts were purified by anti-FLAG M2 (Kodak) affinity chromatography according to the method described by the manufacturer, and the HS2ST and HS6ST activities in the FLAG affinity-bound fractions were measured. For the determination of HS2ST and HS6ST activities, the reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 2.5 μmol of imidazole HCl, pH 6.8, 3.75 μg of protamine chloride, 25 nmol of completely desulfated andN-resulfated heparin (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo), 50 pmol of35S-labeled 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (5 × 105 cpm), and enzyme. For the determination of chondroitin O-sulfotransferase, the same reaction mixture was used except that the completely desulfated andN-resulfated heparin and 3.75 μg of protamine chloride were replaced by 25 nmol of chondroitin and 1.25 μg of protamine chloride, respectively. After incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, the resultant 35S-labeled products were isolated by ethanol precipitation and subsequent gel chromatography on a fast desalting HR10/10 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and the radioactivity incorporated was measured. To determine the HS2ST and HS6ST activities separately, the isolated 35S-labeled products were digested with a mixture of 10 milliunits of heparitinase I, 1 milliunit of heparitinase II, and 10 milliunits of heparitinase III (Seikagaku Corp.) in 40 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 4 μg of bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 2 h. The digested products were injected together with standard unsaturated disaccharides into a packed polyamine column (YMC, Kyoto, Japan). Fractions of 0.6 ml were collected, and the radioactivity was measured. Purified HS2ST was immobilized on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and digested sequentially with endoproteinase Lys-C and then endoproteinase Asp-N as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The generated peptides were separated on a reverse-phase column by HPLC and analyzed with a protein sequenator. The amino acid sequences of the five peptides analyzed are shown in TableI. The residue at the amino terminus is consistent with the one (aspartic acid) expected from the specificity of endoproteinase Asp-N. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers were designed from peptides 1 and 2 as shown in Fig. 1 A (sense 1s and 1si or antisense 2a and 2ai). When primers 1s and 2a were used in a PCR with the first strand cDNA of CHO cell poly(A)+ RNA as template, one DNA fragment of ∼90 bp was obtained (Fig. 1 B, first lane). This 90-bp product appeared to be specific because PCR using primers 1si and 2ai, which were shifted to the 3′-ends of primers 1s and 2a by 9 and 3 bp, respectively, resulted in nearly the same size fragment (Fig. 1 B, second lane). The 90-bp fragment was sequenced and found to contain both the nucleotide sequences extended from primer 1s encoding the 3 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of peptide 1 (Leu, His, and Ile) and extended from primer 2a encoding the amino-terminal Asp of peptide 2 (Fig. 1 A). The 90-bp PCR product was used as a probe to screen the CHO cDNA library. Six independent positive clones were obtained. The nucleotide sequences for the two largest cDNA inserts of 2.2 kilobase pairs (clones K3 and H8) were determined. The cDNA insert obtained from clone K3 included the entire sequence of the clone H8 insert and appeared to have the complete coding sequence of HS2ST. The nucleotide sequence of the HS2ST cDNA and its predicted amino acid sequence are shown in Fig. 2 A. The amino-terminal sequence contains four in-frame ATG codons. There is a TGA stop codon in-frame at position -21 upstream from the first ATG codon. A single open reading frame beginning at the first ATG codon predicts a protein of 356 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 41,830 Da with two potentialN-linked glycosylation sites. The calculated value of the molecular mass is somewhat higher than the apparent molecular mass (38 kDa) previously estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified protein after N-glycanase digestion under nonreducing conditions (22Kobayashi M. Habuchi H. Habuchi O. Saito M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7645-7653Google Scholar). The possible explanations for the discrepancy are that purified HS2ST might have been partially degraded during the purification procedures or that the protein might contain some intramolecular disulfide bonds. Hydropathic analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of HS2ST revealed one prominent hydrophobic segment composed of 14 amino acid residues extending from positions 14 to 27 in the amino-terminal region (Fig. 2 B). All the peptide sequences that had been obtained after digestion of the purified protein with endoproteinase Lys-C followed by endoproteinase Asp-N were found in the predicted protein sequence, confirming that the cDNA clones encode the purified HS2ST protein. Poly(A)+ RNA from cultured CHO cells was prepared and hybridized with a radioactive probe prepared from a SmaI-AflII fragment at positions 113–1257 of clone K3 (Fig. 2 A). Two bands of 5.0 and 3.0 kilobases were observed (Fig. 3). Direct evidence that the isolated cDNA encodes the HS2ST protein was obtained by expressing it in COS-7 cells. COS-7 cells were transfected with pcDNA3HS2ST, a recombinant plasmid containing the isolated cDNA in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3. The cell extract was prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and activities of HS2ST, HS6ST and chondroitinO-sulfotransferase in the extracts were determined. COS-7 cells expressed substantial levels of endogenous HS2ST activity as shown in Table II. When the cells were transfected with vector alone (pcDNA3), the HS2ST activity was unchanged compared with nontransfected cells, whereas a 2.6-fold increase in the HS2ST activity was observed in the cells transfected with pcDNA3HS2ST (Table II, Experiment 1). The increase in the activity was specific to HS2ST because neither the HS6ST nor the chondroitin O-sulfotransferase activity increased. In another experiment using the pFLAG-CMV-2 vector (Table II, Experiment 2), a 2.3-fold increase in the HS2ST activity was also observed in the transfectant with pFLAG-CMV-2HS2ST, indicating that the increase in the activity was not dependent on the vectors used. There was no increase in the control transfectant with pFLAG-CMV-2 alone or with pFLAG-CMV-2R. Furthermore, when the cell extract was applied to the anti-FLAG antibody column, the HS2ST activity alone was recovered only in the affinity fraction from the pFLAG-CMV-2HS2ST transfectant, indicating that synthesized FLAG-HS2ST fusion protein has the HS2ST activity. In addition, no significant change in the sulfotransferase activity was observed in the spent medium of the transfected cells (data not shown). The results thus demonstrate that the isolated cDNA encodes a protein with HS2ST activity and most likely the enzyme that catalyzes heparan sulfate 2-O-sulfation in vivo.Table IIOverexpression of heparan-sulfate 2-sulfotransferase in COS-7 cellsPlasmidSulfotransferase activityaThe activities determined in the absence of exogenous sulfate acceptors were <0.1 pmol/min/mg of protein.HS2STHS6STChondroitin O-sulfotransferasepmol/min/mg proteinExp. 1Cell extractNone2.2 ± 0.51.7 ± 0.56.4 ± 0.1pcDNA32.2 ± 0.11.9 ± 0.36.7 ± 0.5pcDNA3HS2ST5.7 ± 0.71.6 ± 0.47.0 ± 0.1Exp. 2Cell extractpFLAG-CMV-23.9 ± 0.41.6 ± 0.1NDbND, not determined.pFLAG-CMV-244.0 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.2NDpFLAG-CMV-2HS2ST9.1 ± 0.11.4 ± 0.2NDFLAG affinity fractioncThe recovery of the activity in the FLAG affinity fraction was 29% of that in the cell extract.pFLAG-CMV-200NDpFLAG-CMV-2R00NDpFLAG-CMV-2HS2ST1.5 ± 0.1dThe value is expressed as activity/mg of protein in the cell extract.0NDCOS-7 cells were transfected as described under “Experimental Procedures” with vector alone (pcDNA3 or pFLAG-CMV-2), a plasmid containing the HS2ST cDNA (pcDNA3HS2ST or pFLAG-CMV-2HS2ST), and a plasmid containing the HS2ST cDNA in the reverse orientation (pFLAG-CMV-2R). Enzyme activities of HS2ST, HS6ST, and chondroitinO-sulfotransferase contained in the cell extracts and their FLAG affinity fractions were determined.

Open table in a new tab COS-7 cells were transfected as described under “Experimental Procedures” with vector alone (pcDNA3 or pFLAG-CMV-2), a plasmid containing the HS2ST cDNA (pcDNA3HS2ST or pFLAG-CMV-2HS2ST), and a plasmid containing the HS2ST cDNA in the reverse orientation (pFLAG-CMV-2R). Enzyme activities of HS2ST, HS6ST, and chondroitinO-sulfotransferase contained in the cell extracts and their FLAG affinity fractions were determined. The sulfate acceptors used were completely desulfated and N-resulfated heparin for the determination of the activities of HS2ST and HS6ST and chondroitin for that of chondroitin O-sulfotransferase. Values represent means ± S.D. of triplicate cultures. The cloned cDNA corresponds to the HS2ST protein previously purified from cultured CHO cells (22Kobayashi M. Habuchi H. Habuchi O. Saito M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7645-7653Google Scholar). The evidence is as follows: (a) the predicted amino acid sequence of the protein contains all five peptides obtained from the purified enzyme; (b) the characteristics of the predicted protein are consistent with those of the purified enzyme in terms of molecular mass, membrane localization, and N-glycosylation; and (c) when the cDNA was introduced into a eukaryotic expression system, an increase in the HS2ST activity only was observed, and the isolation of the synthesized fusion protein revealed that the HS2ST activity alone was associated with the fusion protein. The amino-terminal sequence of the HS2ST cDNA contains four in-frame ATG codons. When the sequences surrounding the first ATG codon are compared with the eukaryotic consensus translation sequence (28Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Google Scholar), the purine at position −3 is not conserved, but G at position +4 is conserved. Kozak (29Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Google Scholar) showed that G at position +4 is essential for efficient translation in the absence of a purine at position −3. The sequence surrounding the second, the third, and the fourth ATG codons (Met7, Met8, and Met24 in Fig.2 A) also partially fit the consensus sequence; position −3 of these ATG codons is a purine (A, A, and G, respectively), whereas position +4 is not G (A, C, and C, respectively). The fourth ATG codon (Met24), however, is unlikely to be an initiation site because of its location in the amino-terminal transmembrane domain (Fig. 2 A). It remains to be determined which ATG codons could function as the initiation codon. The amino acid sequence predicted from the cDNA suggests that CHO cell HS2ST belongs to a type II membrane protein. There is a short cytosolic hydrophilic domain followed by a hydrophobic domain at the amino terminus, which appears to serve as an uncleaved signal sequence anchor. The hydrophobic domain is then followed by a large hydrophilic domain that may face the lumen of the Golgi apparatus. These characteristics are similar to those of other Golgi proteins including heparin and heparan-sulfateN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferases (18Hashimoto Y. Orellana A. Gil G. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15744-15750Google Scholar, 19Eriksson I. Sandbäck D. Ek B. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10438-10443Google Scholar, 20Orellana A. Hirschberg C.B. Wei Z. Swiedler S.J. Ishihara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2270-2276Google Scholar) and chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase (30Fukuta M. Uchimura K. Nakashima K. Kato M. Kimata K. Shinomura T. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18575-18580Google Scholar). Northern analysis at high stringency detected two transcripts of 3.0 and 5.0 kilobases. The presence of the two transcripts of different sizes suggests that CHO cells may have two different HS2ST messages from two different genes or differently spliced variants from the same gene. Such multiple transcripts of different sizes are also observed in other sulfotransferases (18Hashimoto Y. Orellana A. Gil G. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15744-15750Google Scholar, 20Orellana A. Hirschberg C.B. Wei Z. Swiedler S.J. Ishihara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2270-2276Google Scholar, 30Fukuta M. Uchimura K. Nakashima K.

Sci. 1996; 784: 137-148Google Scholar, 32Dixon J. Loftus S.K. Gladwin A.J. Scambler P.J. Wasmuth J.J. Dixon M.J. Genomics. 1995; 26: 239-244Google Scholar), and as far as has been investigated, they are due to the difference in the size and sequence of the untranslated regions (31Luu-The V. Bernier F. Dufort I. Labrie F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 784: 137-148Google Scholar, 32Dixon J. Loftus S.K. Gladwin A.J. Scambler P.J. Wasmuth J.J. Dixon M.J. Genomics. 1995; 26: 239-244Google Scholar). If this is the case for the HS2ST transcripts and the total coding sequences of the two transcripts are identical (1068 bases), large portions of the transcripts could be untranslated. The possible existence of largely different untranslated regions may be important in the function and distribution of the transcripts (32Dixon J. Loftus S.K. Gladwin A.J. Scambler P.J. Wasmuth J.J. Dixon M.J. Genomics. 1995; 26: 239-244Google Scholar). The transfection of the isolated cDNA into COS-7 cells caused a specific increase in the HS2ST activity without any significant effect on the other sulfotransferase activities examined (Table II). Furthermore, the fusion protein synthesized by the transfection showed the HS2ST activity exclusively. Recently, Bai and Esko (33Bai X. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17711-17717Google Scholar) reported that a mutant CHO cell line defective in 2-O-sulfation showed a somewhat elevated level of 6-O-sulfation. On the other hand, biochemical studies on heparin biosynthesis in mastocytoma tissue suggested that the 2-O- and 6-O-sulfotransferase activities may share a common subunit or reside in a single protein (21Wlad H. Maccarana M. Eriksson I. Kjellén L. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24538-24541Google Scholar). These observations argue that the molecular organization of the O-sulfation process may differ between heparin and HS, as is also the case with heparin and heparan-sulfate N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferases (18Hashimoto Y. Orellana A. Gil G. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15744-15750Google Scholar, 19Eriksson I. Sandbäck D. Ek B. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. J. Biol.

When the molecular cloning of the enzymes forO-sulfation in heparin and HS biosyntheses is completed, the possibility has to be clarified. The predicted HS2ST protein showed no sequence homology to other sulfotransferases including heparin and heparan-sulfateN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferases (18Hashimoto Y. Orellana A. Gil G. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15744-15750Google Scholar, 19Eriksson I. Sandbäck D. Ek B. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10438-10443Google Scholar, 20Orellana A. Hirschberg C.B. Wei Z. Swiedler S.J. Ishihara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2270-2276Google Scholar), except that a stretch of 5 amino acid residues (DLYIL) at positions 338–342 (Fig. 2 A) was found in chick chondrocyte chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase at positions 179–183 (30Fukuta M. Uchimura K. Nakashima K. Kato M. Kimata K. Shinomura T. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18575-18580Google Scholar). In addition, the size (356 amino acid residues) was much smaller than that of the predicted N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferases (882 amino acid residues). Neither the sequence often observed in sulfotransferases, GXXGXXK (18Hashimoto Y. Orellana A. Gil G. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15744-15750Google Scholar), nor LEKCGR, which was reported as a peptide sequence at the binding site for 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate in arylsulfotransferase IV (34Zheng Y. Bergold A. Duffel M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30313-30319Google Scholar), was found in HS2ST. Interestingly, however, a 274-amino acid overlap with 53.6% identity to the HS2ST protein was found in the protein data base for Drosophila segregation distorter protein (35Powers P.A. Ganetzky B. Genetics. 1991; 129: 133-144Google Scholar), which is involved in meiosis in Drosophila. This unexpected result might suggest another HS2ST function. 2-O-Sulfation of IdceA in HS, which is catalyzed by a protein encoded by the cloned cDNA, is an essential step in the biosynthesis of the specific structural domain in HS for the binding of acidic fibroblast growth factor (36Barzu T. Lormeau J.-C. Petitou M. Michelson S. Choay J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 140: 538-548Google Scholar), basic fibroblast growth factor (11Tyrrell D.J. Ishihara M. Rao N. Horne A. Kiefer M.C. Stauber G.B.

https://openalex.org/W2025538209,"Heterologous expression studies have shown that the activity of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels is regulated by their β subunits in a β subunit isoform-specific manner. In this study we therefore investigated if one or several β subunit isoforms associate with L-type Ca2+ channels in different regions of mammalian brain.All four β subunit isoforms (β1b, β2, β3, and β4) are expressed in cerebral cortex as shown in immunoblots. Immunoprecipitation of (+)-[3H]isradipine-labeled L-type channels revealed that the majority of β subunit-associated L-type channels was associated with β3 (42 ± 8%) and β4 (42 ± 7%) subunits, whereas β1b and β2 were present in a smaller fraction of channel complexes. β3 and β4 were also the major L-type channel β subunits in hippocampus. In cerebellum β1b, β2, and β3 but not β4 subunits were expressed at lower levels than in cortex. Accordingly, β4 was the most prominent β subunit in cerebellar L-type channels. This β subunit composition was very similar to the one determined for125I-ω-conotoxin-GVIA-labeled N-type and125I-ω-conotoxin-MVIIC-labeled P/Q-type channel complexes in cerebral cortex and cerebellum.Our data show that all four β subunit isoforms associate with L-type Ca2+ channels in mammalian brain.

This β subunit heterogeneity may play an important role for the fine tuning of L-type channel function and modulation in neurons. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels control the depolarization-induced influx of extracellular Ca2+ into neurons and other electrically excitable cells. They exist as hetero-oligomeric complexes of different subunits (α1, α2-δ, and β). Different types of neuronal Ca2+ channels (termed L-, N-, P-, Q-, and R-type; 1) are discriminated by biophysical and pharmacological criteria (for reviews see Refs. 2Striessnig J. Berger W. Glossmann H. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 1993; 3: 295-317Google Scholar, 3Dunlap K. Luebke J.I. Turner T.J. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 89-98Google Scholar, 4Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev.

N- and P/Q-type channels are blocked by peptide toxins (ω-CTx 1The abbreviations used are: CTx, conotoxin; AIDA, α1 interaction domain of α1A; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. -GVIA and ω-CTx-MVIIC or ω-agatoxin-IVA, respectively), whereas L-type channels are modulated by drugs, such as dihydropyridines (6Glossmann H. Striessnig J. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 114: 1-105Google Scholar). These channel types are differentially distributed in the brain and even within a neuron (7Westenbroek R.E. Hell J.W. Warner C. Dubel S.J. Snutch T.P. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 1099-1115Google Scholar,8Westenbroek R.E. Sakurai T. Elliott E.M. Hell J.W. Starr T.V.B. Snutch T.P. Catterall W.A. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6403-6418Google Scholar). Thereby they serve different physiological functions. N- and P/Q-type channels are abundant in nerve terminals and control Ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter release (3Dunlap K. Luebke J.I. Turner T.J. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 89-98Google Scholar). L-type channels are localized mainly on neuronal cell somata and proximal dendrites where they may control Ca2+-dependent modulatory processes and excitation-transcription coupling (9Murphy T.H. Worley P.F. Baraban J.M. Neuron. 1991; 7: 625-635Google Scholar). The above Ca2+ channel types consist of different α1 subunit isoforms (class A–E) that also form their drug or toxin binding domains and therefore determine their pharmacological properties (1Birnbaumer L. Campbell K.P. Catterall W.A. Harpold M.M. Hofmann F. Horne W.A. Mori Y. Schwartz A. Snutch T.P. Tanabe T. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 1994; 13: 505-506Google Scholar). In contrast, important biophysical and modulatory properties, such as voltage-dependent gating (10Singer D. Biel M. Lotan I. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Dascal N. Science. 1991; 253: 1553-1557Google Scholar, 11Olcese R. Qin N. Schneider T. Neely A. Wei X.Y. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1433-1438Google Scholar) and channel modulation by G-proteins (12Roche J.P. Anantharam V. Treistman S.N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 43-46Google Scholar, 13Bourinet E. Soong T.W. Stea A. Snutch T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1486-1491Google Scholar) and kinases (14Stea A. Tomlinson W.J. Soong T.W. Bourinet E. Dubel S.J. Vincent S.R. Snutch T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10576-10580Google Scholar), are determined not only by α1 but also by associated α2-δ and β-subunits. Whereas only one α2-δ isoform is known, four different β subunit isoforms (β1–β4) are expressed in mammalian brain (15Perez-Reyes E. Schneider T. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 1111-1124Google Scholar, 16Tanaka O. Sakagami H. Kondo H. Mol. Brain. Res. 1995; 30: 1-16Google Scholar). Heterologous expression studies revealed that β subunits can affect α1 function in a β subunit isoform-specific manner. For example, Ca2+ currents carried by α1A, α1E, and α1C inactivate faster with coexpressed β3 than with β2 (14Stea A. Tomlinson W.J. Soong T.W. Bourinet E. Dubel S.J. Vincent S.R. Snutch T.P. Proc.

Zhang J.-F. Randall A.D. Zhou M. Schwarz T.L. Tsien R.W. Horne W.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 455-458Google Scholar) subunits. β1, β3, and β4, but not β2, are permissive for voltage-dependent facilitation of Ca2+channels formed by α1C (19Cens T. Mangoni M.E. Richard S. Nargeot J. Charnet P. Pfluegers Arch. 1996; 431: 771-774Google Scholar). β3 and β1 subunits confer slightly different pharmacological properties to L-type channels (20Welling A. Lacinova L. Donatin K. Ludwig A. Bosse E. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Pfluegers Arch. 1995; 429: 400-411Google Scholar). Therefore β subunit heterogeneity could participate in the fine-tuning of channel function. However, it is unclear if only one or several β subunit isoforms associate with these channels in mammalian brain. So far only the β subunit composition of L-type Ca2+channels in skeletal muscle has been studied. In this tissue exclusively β1a subunits are associated with the channel complex (15Perez-Reyes E. Schneider T. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 1111-1124Google Scholar,21Witcher D.R. De Waard M. Liu H. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18088-18093Google Scholar). Biochemical evidence for β subunit heterogeneity in mammalian brain has recently been provided for N-type and P/Q-type channels (22Liu H. De Waard M. Scott V.E.S. Gurnett C.A. Lennon V.A. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13804-13810Google Scholar, 23Scott V.E.S. De Waard M. Liu H. Gurnett C.A. Venzke D.P. Lennon V.A. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3207-3212Google Scholar). Multiple β subunit isoforms were found to be associated to different extents with both channel types after extraction from whole rabbit brain. Here we report that β subunit heterogeneity also exists within neuronal L-type channels. We found that regional differences in the β subunit expression pattern affect β subunit composition in different regions of mammalian brain. A preliminary report of our findings has appeared previously (24Striessnig J. Haase H. Safayhi H. Roenfeldt M. Ammon H.P.T. Morano I. Cassidy T.N. Ahlijanian M.K. Biophys. J. 1996; 70 (abstr.): 362Google Scholar). Reagents were obtained from the following sources: 125I-ω-CTx-GVIA, 125I-ω-CTx-MVIIC (2200 Ci/mmol), and (+)-[3H]isradipine from DuPont NEN (Vienna, Austria); unlabeled ω-CTx-GVIA from Sigma (Vienna, Austria); unlabeled ω-CTx-MVIIC from Saxon Biochemicals (Hannover, Germany); prestained molecular weight markers from Bio-Rad (Vienna, Austria); glutathione-Sepharose from Pharmacia (Vienna, Austria); Protein A-Sepharose from Sigma; calpain inhibitors I and II from Boehringer Mannheim (Vienna, Austria); all other protease inhibitors from Sigma. For antibody production in rabbits peptides were coupled to bovine serum albumin with glutaraldehyde (25Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9108-9112Google Scholar) or synthesized on a lysine branch (octavalent NovaSyn PA resin, Novabiochem) for immunization. Anti-β2 was generated as described (26Haase H. Karczewski P. Beckert R. Krause E.G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 217-222Google Scholar). For immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation experiments, antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography on Sepharose-4B derivatized with the antigenic peptide (25Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9108-9112Google Scholar). Antigenic epitopes comprised the following amino acids (residue number is given according to the sequences in Ref. 27Castellano A. Wei X. Birnbaumer L. Perez-Reyes E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12359-12366Google Scholar): β1b, 516–530; β2, 595–604; β3, 470–483; β4, 460–474. Anti-βcom was raised against residues 61–79 in β1a (28Ruth P. Roehrkasten A. Biel M. Bosse E. Regulla S. Meyer H.E. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Science. 1989; 245: 1115-1118Google Scholar). Membranes were prepared from guinea pig or rabbit cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and heart muscle as described (29Glossmann H. Ferry D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 109: 513-550Google Scholar). Brain regions were rapidly removed from rabbit or guinea pig brains and immediately placed in ice-cold homogenization buffer containing 0.02 m NaHCO3 and a protease inhibitor mixture (2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm benzamidine, 2 mm iodoacetamide, 1 μm pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml calpain inhibitor I and II, 0.1 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor). The tissues were then homogenized by 10–20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer, and microsomes were collected by centrifugation at 45,000 × g (10 min, 4 °C). Microsomes were then washed three times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (37 °C), containing the same protease inhibitor mix. Membranes were resuspended in the same buffer at a protein concentration about 5 mg/ml and stored at −80 °C until use. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) and a GST fusion protein with the α1 subunit interaction domain of the α1A subunit (AIDA) were prepared as described (21Witcher D.R. De Waard M. Liu H. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18088-18093Google Scholar). All further steps were carried out on ice or at 4 °C. Typically 20 mg of microsomal protein isolated from rabbit or guinea pig brain regions were solubilized in 9 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing the protease inhibitors used for membrane preparation) supplemented with 1% (w/v) CHAPS and 1 m NaCl according to Ref. 21Witcher D.R. De Waard M. Liu H. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18088-18093Google Scholar. 30-μl aliquots of glutathione-Sepharose equilibrated in buffer B (buffer A containing 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, 0.1 mNaCl) were coupled with 10 μg of GST or GST-AIDA and washed three times with the above buffer. Solubilized membranes were diluted 10-fold in buffer A, and 4 ml were mixed with the coupled glutathione-Sepharose beads for 4 h or overnight. The beads were washed three times with 1.5 ml of buffer B, mixed with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer (15 min, 56 °C or 3 min, 95 °C), and the eluted protein separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels. Immunoblot experiments were carried out as described (30Moebius F.F. Hanner M. Knaus H.-G. Weber F. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29314-29320Google Scholar). Prestained molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad) were run on the same gels. The apparent molecular masses of each batch were provided by the supplier. Membrane-bound channels were prelabeled with (+)-[3H]isradipine (1–2 nm) for 60 min at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm PMSF, 1 mm CaCl2. All subsequent steps were carried out on ice or at 4 °C. Prelabeled membranes were collected, solubilized on ice for 60 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% (w/v) digitonin, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm benzamidine, 2 mm iodoacetamide, 1 μm pepstatin A, and nonsoluble proteins removed by centrifugation (45,000 ×g, 60 min). The digitonin extracts were either used for immunoprecipitation or were further affinity-purified by chromatography on wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-Sepharose (2 ml of packed resin for 5–20 mg of solubilized protein). Channel-associated activity was eluted from the resin in equilibration buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1 mm PMSF) containing 6% (w/v) N-acetylglucosamine. Active fractions were directly used in immunoprecipitation experiments or quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. For immunoprecipitation of labeled channels, affinity-purified antibodies were coupled to Protein A-Sepharose. The Protein A-Sepharose-antibody complex was washed three times with 1.5 ml of ice-cold RIA buffer (solubilization buffer containing 0.1% digitonin) and then incubated for 12–16 h at 4 °C with 0.15–0.55 ml of solubilized extracts (prelabeled N- and P/Q-type channels) or WGA-Sepharose-purified channel preparations (L-type channels). Unbound radioactivity was removed by four 1.5-ml washes with RIA buffer. Bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation ((+)-[3H]isradipine) or gamma-counting (125I-ω-CTx-GVIA, 125I-ω-CTx-MVIIC). High affinity binding of (+)-[3H]isradipine to solubilized L-type Ca2+ channels was determined using a filtration assay as described (29Glossmann H. Ferry D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 109: 513-550Google Scholar). This assay underestimated the total specific (+)-[3H]isradipine binding activity by about 20%. This was taken into account to calculate the binding activity employed for immunoprecipitation assays. Data are given as means ± S.D. for the indicated number of experiments. To investigate the association of all known subunit isoforms with neuronal voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels in mammalian brain, we raised anti-peptide antibodies against unique sequences of β1b, β2, β3, and β4 subunits. In addition, an antibody against an epitope highly conserved in all β subunit isoforms (anti-βcom) was generated. We used these antibodies to determine their association with neuronal Ca2+ channels solubilized from rabbit or guinea pig cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum membranes in immunoprecipitation experiments. Their expression in these brain regions was analyzed in Western blots. To determine their relative expression densities the four β subunit isoforms were extracted with CHAPS from microsomes prepared from brain (β1b, β2, β3, β4) or, for control purposes, from skeletal muscle (β1a). Extracts were affinity-purified on GST-AIDA-Sepharose (21Witcher D.R. De Waard M. Liu H. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18088-18093Google Scholar) in the presence of protease inhibitors as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 1 for skeletal muscle β1a (anti-βcom staining) and neuronal β3 and β4 subunits, the enrichment of β subunit immunoreactivity was specific and absent when only GST was used as the affinity matrix (Fig. 1,lanes 4–6). In β subunit preparations from rabbit cerebral cortex anti-βcom specifically recognized a 63 ± 3/67 ± 3-kDa doublet and a 88 ± 4-kDa band (Fig.2) (n ≥ 4). A ∼33-kDa band was also stained to a variable extent by βcom as well as all the other β antibodies and corresponded to the GST-AIDA polypeptide present at relatively high amounts (10 μg) in the β subunit preparations.Figure 2Expression of β1b, β3, and β4 subunits in different brain regions. The results of Western blot analysis are shown. β subunits were purified from the indicated brain regions (A and B), skeletal muscle (A) or heart microsomes (B) by GST-AIDA affinity chromatography and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis together with prestained marker proteins and subjected to immunoblot analysis with β subunit isoform-selective, affinity-purified antibodies. Skeletal muscle affinity chromatography on GST-AIDA-Sepharose was as in Fig. 1. For all neuronal tissues and cardiac muscle comparable amounts of membrane protein (0.45 ml of solubilization buffer per mg of protein) were used for solubilization and subsequent analysis (4 ml of diluted extract). Samples from one brain region were always separated on the same gel. In some experiments individual lanes were cut in half longitudinally and probed with different antibodies to allow an exact comparison of the relative migration of immunostained bands. Thenumbers denote β subunit antibody selectivities.C, βcom antibody recognizing an epitope common to all four β subunit isoforms. The arrows indicate specifically stained β subunits as discussed in the text. The migration of prestained molecular weight markers (105,000; 82,000; 49,000; 33,300; 28,600) is indicated on the left. CTX, cerebral cortex; CER, cerebellum; HIP, hippocampus;SKM, skeletal muscle. One of at least three independent experiments yielding similar results is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To assign the βcom-stained bands to individual β subunit isoforms, samples separated on the same gel were stained with isoform-specific antibodies. The 88-kDa band was composed of anti-β1b (Fig.2 A) and anti-β2 staining (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, bands stained by anti-β4 and anti-β3 accounted for the βcom immunoreactivity in the 63/67-kDa doublet. The majority of anti-β3 immunoreactivity was associated with the larger 67-kDa βcom band, whereas anti-β4 recognized both bands of the doublet to a variable extent (Figs. 1, 2, 3). β subunit isoform staining was specific. It was completely suppressed in the presence of 1 μm of the respective antigenic peptides (not shown). As expected, only βcom but not the isoform-selective antibodies specifically recognized β1a extracted from partially purified skeletal muscle T-tubule membranes (Fig.2 A). βcom staining in rabbit heart represented β2 immunoreactivity (Fig. 2 B) suggesting that other isoforms are absent or expressed at much lower levels in this tissue. The same bands were also present in hippocampus (Fig. 2) and cerebellum extracts (Fig. 3). The relative abundance of the 88-kDa band was lowest in cerebellum because β1b and β2 expression density was lower in this region as compared with cerebral cortex (Fig. 2). When similar amounts of solubilized membrane protein from cerebral cortex and cerebellum were subjected to β subunit isolation and Western blotting (Fig. 3) similar βcom staining intensity was found for the 63/67-kDa doublet. β3-specific immunoreactivity was less abundant in cerebellum, whereas β4 was expressed at similar densities as in cerebral cortex (Fig. 3). Taken together, the βcom staining pattern in mammalian brain can be explained by the presence of all four β subunit isoforms which are expressed in a region-specific pattern. After having established the specificity of our antibodies, we investigated if L-type Ca2+ channels are associated with only one or several β subunit isoforms and if β subunit association varies in different brain regions. We reversibly labeled neuronal L-type Ca2+ channels complexes in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum membranes with the L-type Ca2+channel-selective ligand (+)-[3H]isradipine and solubilized them in buffer containing 1% (w/v) digitonin. In cerebral cortex and hippocampus 74 ± 9% (n = 4) and 91 ± 22% (n = 4) of the solubilized (+)-[3H]isradipine labeling was immunoprecipitated with saturating concentrations of an antibody directed against α1C indicating that binding was associated with L-type channel complexes. 61 ± 18% (n = 5) and 80 ± 31% (n = 4) of the labeled L-type channels were immunoprecipitated by βcom. Therefore, most of the L-type channel complexes are associated with a β subunit which is accessible for βcom under nondenaturating conditions. Immunoprecipitation experiments with the isoform-selective antibodies revealed the association of more than one β isoform with the channel complex. Affinity-purified anti-β3 and anti-β4 antibodies each immunoprecipitated 42% of the radioactivity recognized by anti-βcom (Fig. 4 A). Smaller fractions were bound by anti-β1b and anti-β2 (Fig. 4 A). Together our subunit-specific antibodies accounted for all (118%) βcom immunoprecipitable radioactivity in cerebral cortex. Immunoprecipitation by these antibodies was saturable (see Fig.5 C). The nonspecific background signal observed with the same concentrations of control rabbit immunoglobulin was less than 10% (n > 3) of the radioactivity recognized by anti-bcom. In control experiments only βcom, but none of the isoform-specific antibodies, immunoprecipitated (+)-[3H]isradipine-labeled L-type channels extracted from rabbit skeletal muscle (Fig. 4 B), which are exclusively associated with β1a (21Witcher D.R. De Waard M. Liu H. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18088-18093Google Scholar). A similar β subunit composition was observed in hippocampus (Fig.4 C). In the cerebellum only β4 accounted for a large portion of L-type channel-associated β subunits (Fig. 4 D). Immunoprecipitation by β3 antibodies was less pronounced than in cerebral cortex (Fig. 4 D). This is in good agreement with the lower relative abundance of β3 in this region (Fig. 3). Immunoprecipitation by β1b and β2 was difficult to detect in cerebellum (Fig. 4 D) representing less than 10% of the channels immunoprecipitated by anti-βcom. Together the isoform-selective antibodies accounted for most but not all of the β subunit-associated radioactivity in hippocampus (70%) and cerebellum (66%). Next we tested if the β subunit composition of L-type Ca2+ channels resembles the subunit composition of N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels in these regions (22Liu H. De Waard M. Scott V.E.S. Gurnett C.A. Lennon V.A. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13804-13810Google Scholar, 23Scott V.E.S. De Waard M. Liu H. Gurnett C.A. Venzke D.P. Lennon V.A. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3207-3212Google Scholar). For N- and P/Q-type channels it has been investigated before in digitonin extracts of whole brain membranes, but data on individual brain regions are unavailable. We therefore also subjected125I-ω-CTx-GVIA- and125I-ω-CTx-MVIIC-labeled channel complexes extracted from cerebral cortex and cerebellum to immunoprecipitation with our antibodies. We have previously shown that under our experimental conditions saturable high affinity 125I-ω-CTx-GVIA and125I-ω-CTx-MVIIC binding occurs selectively to N-type and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels, respectively, with dissociation constants in the subpicomolar range (31Pichler M. Wang Z. Grabner-Weiss C. Reimer D. Hering S. Grabner M. Glossmann H. Striessnig J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14659-14664Google Scholar). In cerebral cortex and cerebellum saturating concentrations of anti-βcom recognized 85 ± 23% (n = 5) and 84 ± 13 (n = 4) of channels associated with125I-ω-CTx-GVIA binding activity, respectively. The immunoprecipitation profile was very similar to L-type channels (Fig.5, A and B). β3 and β4 subunits together immunoprecipitated >80% of βcom immunoprecipitable125I-ω-CTx-GVIA binding in a saturable manner (Fig.5 C). As with L-type channels, a smaller fraction of N-type channel binding was associated with β1b and β2. In cerebellum again only β4 antibodies recognized substantial portions of N-type channel activity (Fig. 5 B). Similar results as described for N-type and L-type channels were also obtained for125I-ω-CTx-MVIIC-labeled P/Q-type channels in cerebral cortex (not shown). In cerebellum only β4 antibodies recognized significant amounts of 125I-ω-CTx-MVIIC-labeled P/Q-type channels (43 ± 18.5%, n = 3). Isoform-selective antibodies completely accounted for the N-type (105%, Fig. 5 A) and P/Q-type (>85%, not shown) channel binding recognized by anti-βcom in cerebral cortex but only for 40–50% in cerebellum. As for L-type channels this difference cannot be attributed to differences in membrane preparation because it was also found when the respective brain regions were isolated from the same animals in the same buffer and carried through the whole solubilization and immunoprecipitation procedure in parallel. It is therefore possible that in hippocampus and cerebellum immunoprecipitation by one or several of our antibodies was underestimated. At present we do not know if this is due to the expression of a yet uncharacterized β subunit isoform, which is immunoprecipitated by βcom but none of the other antibodies, or due to region-specific differences in proteolysis. C-terminal proteolysis could remove the C-terminal epitopes of our isoform-specific antibodies. However, we have obtained no evidence for extensive proteolytic breakdown of β subunits in immunoblots with our βcom antibody, which recognizes an epitope located near the N terminus of the β subunits. The major findings of our study are as follows. 1) All known β subunit isoforms participate in the formation of neuronal L-type Ca2+ channels in mammalian brain. 2) β3 and β4 subunits are most often found as part of the neuronal L-type channel complexes. 3) The fractional contribution of a particular β subunit isoform for channel formation varies among different brain regions. 4) The β subunit composition and regional differences are very similar to N- and P/Q-type channels in cerebral cortex and cerebellum. This similarity of the β subunit composition between L-type channels and N- as well as P/Q-type channels is interesting because the subcellular distribution of L-type channels in neurons differs significantly from the distribution of N- and P/Q-type channels. L-type α1C and α1D subunits are predominantly found on the cell soma and proximal dendrites, whereas N-type α1B and P/Q-type α1A are also found along the length of dendrites and in presynaptic terminals (8Westenbroek R.E. Sakurai T. Elliott E.M. Hell J.W. Starr T.V.B. Snutch T.P. Catterall W.A. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6403-6418Google Scholar,32Westenbroek R.E. Ahlijanian M.K. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1990; 347: 281-284Google Scholar). Despite these differences in neuronal targeting, these channel types do not show major differences with respect to their β subunit composition. Obviously different β subunit isoforms can be targeted to different regions of a neuron. Both α1C and α1D subunits participate in the formation of L-type Ca2+ channels in mammalian brain. We have made no attempts to determine if differences exist between the two L-type channels with respect to their β subunit composition. The fraction of channels associated with α1D is small (not more than 9–26% in hippocampus and cerebral cortex as revealed by our immunoprecipitation experiments with α1C; see also Ref, 33) and therefore complicates such an analysis. We cannot exclude the possibility that β1b and β2, which are found only in a minor fraction of channels, are selectively associated only with α1D. However, based on our finding that α1C is associated with the majority of labeled channels in cerebral cortex and hippocampus, β-subunit heterogeneity must exist within class C L-type channels in these regions. β subunits strongly affect the functional properties of the pore-forming α1 subunits of L-type (and non L-type) channels. As shown by heterologous coexpression in Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cells, β subunits affect channel gating (10Singer D. Biel M. Lotan I. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Dascal N.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1486-1491Google Scholar), and phosphorylation (14Stea A. Tomlinson W.J. Soong T.W. Bourinet E. Dubel S.J. Vincent S.R. Snutch T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Wei X. Birnbaumer L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1330-1337Google Scholar) interaction with L-type α1 subunits. Such studies also revealed that different β isoforms are able to confer different channel properties. For example, β3 confers a more rapid inactivation to currents mediated by α1C (17Hullin R. Singer-Lahat D. Freichel M. Biel M. Dascal N. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 885-890Google Scholar) than does β2. β isoform-specific effects on channel inactivation were also observed for non-L-type Ca2+ channel α1 subunits (11Olcese R. Qin N. Schneider T. Neely A. Wei X.Y. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1433-1438Google Scholar, 14Stea A. Tomlinson W.J. Soong T.W. Bourinet E. Dubel S.J. Vincent S.R. Snutch T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Only β1, β3, and β4, but not β2, support voltage-dependent facilitation of α1C-mediated Ca2+ currents (19Cens T. Mangoni M.E. Richard S. Nargeot J. Charnet P. Pfluegers Arch. 1996; 431: 771-774Google Scholar). Similarly, small differences in the sensitivity of the channel to the Ca2+ antagonist mibefradil and the modulation by protein kinase C were observed when different β subunits form part of the channel complex (14Stea A. Tomlinson W.J. Soong T.W. Bourinet E. Dubel S.J. Vincent S.R. Snutch T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10576-10580Google Scholar, 20Welling A. Lacinova L. Donatin K. Ludwig A. Bosse E. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Pfluegers Arch. 1995; 429: 400-411Google Scholar). We now provide direct biochemical evidence that indeed different β subunits participate in the formation of neuronal L-type channels suggesting that these isoform-selective effects contribute to L-type Ca2+ channel plasticity in mammalian brain. β subunits could be involved in the fine tuning of L-type channel function in a region-specific manner. Based on our findings future coexpression studies should preferentially focus on the comparison of the properties of L-type channels containing β3 or β4 subunits, because these isoforms seem to be present in the majority of dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type channels in cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Taken together our data demonstrate that, like in other neuronal Ca2+ channel types, several β subunit isoforms contribute to the formation of neuronal L-type channels. Further studies must focus on the physiological and pathophysiological consequences of this heterogeneity and investigate if changes in β subunit expression could account for changes in L-type Ca2+ channel function also under pathophysiological conditions, such as neurodegeneration, cerebral ischemia, or aging (36Thibault O. Landfield P.W. Science. 1996; 272: 1017-1020Google Scholar). We thank Dr. H. Glossmann for continuous support."

The central region consists of long stretches of repeating amino acids that serve as attachment sites for glycosaminoglycans such as chondroitin and keratan sulfate; the terminal globular domains interact with other cartilage components. The glycosaminoglycan attachment region is encoded in several species by a single large exon, within which are several different types of repeating sequences. Several species show within this exon a similar block of conserved repeats for attachment of chondroitin sulfate, but in humans this group of repeats is particularly well conserved. Examination of genomic DNA from a population of unrelated individuals by polymerase chain reaction or Southern blot assays shows this block of repeat sequences exists in multiple allelic forms, which differ by the number of repeats at this site in each allele. Thirteen different alleles have been identified, with repeat numbers ranging from 13 to 33. This is an unusual example of an expressed variable number of tandem repeat polymorphism. This polymorphism is apparently restricted to humans, of several species examined. This polymorphism results in individuals with differing length aggrecan core proteins, bearing different numbers of potential attachment sites for chondroitin sulfate.

This polymorphism results in individuals with differing length aggrecan core proteins, bearing different numbers of potential attachment sites for chondroitin sulfate. The possibility exists for a molecular understanding of biological variation in cartilage functional properties. Aggrecan is the major proteoglycan of cartilage (1Wight T.N. Heinegard D.K. Hascall V.C. Hay E.D. Cell Biology of the Extracellular Matrix. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1991: 45-78Google Scholar) and is expressed at high levels only in this tissue; low levels of aggrecan expression have been reported in notochord (2Stirpe N.S. Goetinck P.F. Development. 1989; 107: 22-33Google Scholar, 3Domowicz M. Li H. Hennig A. Henry J. Vertel B.M. Schwartz N.B. Dev. Biol. 1995; 171: 655-664Google Scholar) and calvaria (4Wong M. Lawton T. Goetinck P.F. Kuhn J.L. Goldstein S.A. Bonadio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5592-5598Google Scholar). Aggrecan is composed of two types of structural elements, an extended central core and three flanking globular domains. Two of the globular domains are at the amino terminus, share homology with link protein (5Doege K. Sasaki M. Horigan E. Hassell J.R. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17757-17767Google Scholar), and one, at least (G1), binds strongly to hyaluronan and link protein, effectively localizing the molecule in the cartilage matrix. The third globular domain, G3, shares intriguing structural features with the selectin family of cell adhesion molecules (6Tedder T.F. Steeber D.A. Chen A. Engel P. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 866-873Google Scholar) and may also provide important interactions with other cell or matrix components. The bulk of the molecule is made up of over 100 chondroitin sulfate chains attached to specific serine residues in the central portion of the core protein, the chondroitin-sulfate attachment region, or CS 1The abbreviations used are: CS, chondroitin sulfate; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; VNTR, variable number of tandem repeats; CEPH, Center Etude Polymorphisme Humaine. 1The abbreviations used are: CS, chondroitin sulfate; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; VNTR, variable number of tandem repeats; CEPH, Center Etude Polymorphisme Humaine. domain. These specific serine residues occur adjacent to glycine residues, and there has been considerable discussion as to what other features define a consensus attachment signal for chondroitin sulfate (7Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 229-255Google Scholar); these features include a nearby acidic amino acid as well as a nonpolar residue. It has not been determined whether all the suitable serine-glycine pairs are equally likely to be substituted with chondroitin sulfate. It is the tight packing of these highly hydrophilic, GAG-substituted molecules within the constraining collagen fibrillar network that provides the unique swelling pressure and resistance to compressive forces essential to cartilage function in articular joint surfaces. Analysis of the cDNA sequences for rat (5Doege K. Sasaki M. Horigan E. Hassell J.R. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17757-17767Google Scholar) and human aggrecan (8Doege K.J. Sasaki M. Kimura T. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 894-902Google Scholar) produced the observation that the serine-glycine pairs occurred in two distinct patterns of repeating sequences, designated the CS-1 and CS-2 repeat regions, and that the human cDNA contained a subregion of the CS-1 repeat that was remarkably conserved in 19 repeats of 19 amino acids each. The degree of conservation was that of identity for most of the repeats at the nucleic acid sequence level. Several restriction fragment length polymorphisms in the human aggrecan gene were identified for use in genetic linkage studies (9Finkelstein J. Doege K. Yamada Y. Pyeritz R. Graham J. Moeschler J. Pauli R. Hecht J. Francomano C. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 48: 97-102Google Scholar), and one, aHaeIII restriction fragment length polymorphism, was particularly polymorphic. The cDNA probe used in that case was pSA003, which encodes the CS domain including the highly repeated subregion. As the CS domain of aggrecan is encoded by a single large exon in the human gene (10Doege K. Sasaki M. Yamada Y. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 200-202Google Scholar, 11Valhmu W.B. Palmer G.D. Rivers P.A. Ebara S. Cheng J.-F. Fischer S. Ratcliffe A. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 535-542Google Scholar), and the highly repeated region within the CS domain is flanked by HaeIII sites, the possibility was suggested that this repeat region might constitute a rare VNTR within the structural coding region of a gene. The work reported here is a result of a study confirming this hypothesis, prompting the examination of the functional and biological consequences of this variation in a major component of cartilage. DNA samples were obtained for the 40 large family founder couples from the CEPH (Center Etude Polymorphisme Humaine) (12Dausset J. Cann H. Cohen D. Lathrop M. Lalouel J.-M. White R. Genomics. 1990; 6: 575-577Google Scholar) collection, as well as for three of the extended families including grandparents and offspring. Where available, lymphoblast cell stocks for these individuals were obtained from the NIGMS mutant cell repository (maintained by the Coriell Institute for Medical Research, Camden, NJ) and expanded in culture as directed by the supplier. Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 media containing 15% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 1% l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. DNA was prepared from the cultured cells using the Puregene Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (Gentra Systems, Inc.). DNA (non-CEPH) was also prepared from whole tissues, either surgical discards including human placentas, other cultured cell lines, as well as bovine liver, also by the Puregene Kit method. DNA for three extended CEPH families was provided by Dr. Michael Litt, Oregon Health Sciences University; several other DNA samples were kindly given by Mirta Machado, Shriners Hospital for Children, Portland. The primers used in the human genomic PCR assay were located at positions 2888–2911 of the human aggrecan cDNA sequence (8Doege K.J. Sasaki M. Kimura T. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 894-902Google Scholar) for the upstream sense primer (5′-TAGAGGGCTCTGCCTCTGGAGTTG-3′), and for the downstream, antisense primer positions 4115–4092 (5′-AGGTCCCCTACCGCAGAGGTAGAA-3′). The bovine genomic PCR reaction used primers from the two published cDNA fragments (13Oldberg A. Antonsson P. Heinegard D. Biochem. J. 1987; 243: 255-259Google Scholar, 14Antonsson P. Heinegard D. Oldberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16170-16173Google Scholar); the upstream primer was located at position 1304–1324 of the 5′ bovine cDNA (14Antonsson P. Heinegard D. Oldberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16170-16173Google Scholar) (5′-AGGTTGCCCTCTGGGGGTGAG-3′), and the downstream, antisense primer at position 57–37 of the 3′ bovine cDNA fragment (13Oldberg A. Antonsson P. Heinegard D. Biochem. J. 1987; 243: 255-259Google Scholar) (5′-GGGTGCTTCTCCGCTCAGGTC-3′). The 50-μl PCR reaction typically included 50 pmol of each of the sense and antisense primers, 100 ng of genomic DNA, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2.5 units ofTaq DNA polymerase, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm potassium chloride. The annealing temperature for both the human and bovine reactions was 67 °C, and 29 cycles of amplification were carried out. PCR products were subcloned by ligation into the T-tailed vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). 2 μg of genomic DNA was cut withHaeIII and fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The DNA in the gel was denatured, neutralized, and transferred to derivatized nylon membrane (ZetaProbe GT, Bio-Rad) by capillary action using standard methods (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.31-9.58Google Scholar). The membrane was baked for 2 h at 80 °C in a vacuum oven, pre-washed at 65 °C for 1 h in 0.1 × SSC (SSC, 0.15 m sodium chloride, 0.015m sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 0.5% SDS, then prehybridized and hybridized in Church buffer (0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 7% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1% bovine serum albumin) at 65 °C for 16 h. The probe used was a HaeIII fragment of the cDNA clone pSA003 (8Doege K.J. Sasaki M. Kimura T. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 894-902Google Scholar) encoding the human VNTR region. The blots were washed at 65 °C in 0.1 × SSC, 1% SDS, following a prewash at room temperature in 2 × SSC, 5% SDS. DNA size markers were co-electrophoresed and transferred and probed in the same hybridization with 32P-labeled marker DNA. DNA probes were labeled using random primer extension with Klenow and [α-32P]dCTP according to the kit manufacturer (Amersham Corp.). The two smallest alleles, 13 and 18, were sequenced after subcloning PCR-generated DNA into a T-tailed vector, using M13 sequencing primers flanking the cloning site. Cycle sequencing using Taq polymerase (ABI kit) and an ABI 383 automated DNA sequencer were used. Allele 18 was too large to sequence completely across the clone in this manner, but 15 of the 18 repeats were sequenced. The bovine VNTR product, approximately 1.6 kilobase pairs, required a nested deletion strategy, as the sequence was too repetitive for internal priming and too long to sequence across from the ends. Nested deletions in pUC18 were constructed using exonuclease III and mung bean nuclease (Stratagene kit) and sequenced as above. A PCR assay was designed to examine the size of the highly repeated region in various individuals. This strategy made use of the fact that the repeat region was part of a large exon, so that total genomic DNA could be used for analysis. Primers were chosen at positions just outside the highly repeated domain, so that the size of the product was predicted to be 33 nucleotides greater than the repeat region, which in turn was determined by the number of repeats of the 57 nucleotides encoding each 19 amino acid unit. DNA samples were obtained from a number of sources, including common cell lines and surgical discards, but the major resource used for this study was the CEPH collection's 40 founder couples. These are the founders of large, well studied families for which lymphoblast cell cultures, as well as purified DNA in some cases, are available from the NIGMS cell repository. Upon screening DNA of 72 of these unrelated individuals, as well as 22 additional samples, a range of PCR product sizes was observed. Fig. 1 displays the first 10 of these alleles that were identified and that includes the extremes of the range; three additional alleles (not shown) have been observed making a total of 13 alleles to date. Several lines of evidence support the conclusion that these PCR products arise from a polymorphic repeat region in the CS domain of aggrecan. First, the bands differ in size by a base pair count that is an integral number of the base pairs in a repeat unit, or 57 bases. In this respect, it was noted that the band derived from pSA003, the allele that was published as a cDNA sequence (8Doege K.J. Sasaki M. Kimura T. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 894-902Google Scholar), was exactly one repeat larger than predicted. Apparently the large number of identical repeats in this sequence allowed the alignment to “slip” by one repeat during the computerized assembly of the random, sonicated fragment sequences in the original sequencing. This is a difficult problem to circumvent if a repeat region is long and the repeats are very similar. Second, the same pattern, adjusted for restriction siteversus primer location, was obtained by genomic Southern analysis. Total genomic DNA was digested with HaeIII, electrophoretically fractionated, blotted, and probed with the CS-repeat cDNA (Fig. 1 B). This correspondence in pattern rules out a PCR artifact in the generation of the bands. The PCR product bands can be digested appropriately with restriction enzymes (data not shown). Furthermore, upon extending the assay to several of the families of the CEPH founders (DNA kindly provided by Dr. Michael Litt, OHSU) the alleles followed a strict Mendelian assortment in all cases, in up to three generations (data not shown). Finally, as discussed below, two of the alleles have been cloned and sequenced and conclusively identified as variants of the published repeat sequence. The description and frequency of these alleles in the studied population are presented in Table I. The numbers of repeats in these 13 alleles range from 33 to 13; the allele cloned as pSA003 corresponded to 22 repeats in this assay, which includes the published 19 repeats (8Doege K.J. Sasaki M. Kimura T. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 894-902Google Scholar), the missing “slipped” repeat, and two additional repeats resulting from a change in the defined start of a repeat (see below), making it one of the smaller and also less common forms of the gene. The most common alleles in the general population are those of 28, 27, or 26 repeats that make up 87% observed alleles and represent a normal distribution with a mean and mode of 27 repeats. The CEPH founders used in this study consist of 49 Utah, 17 French, 4 Venezuelan, and 2 Amish individuals; the allele distribution in the two largest groups, the Utah and French families, showed the same mean allele size, 27, but somewhat different rankings of the different alleles. Allele 26 showed the most divergence, as it was 16% in the Utah families and 35% in the French families, although this sample group is quite small. No data are yet available from other ethnic groups.Table IDistribution of human aggrecan VNTR alleles in a random populationObserved allele repeat numberPCR product sizeFrequency%bpn = 18833191510.532185831.629168742.12816304523.92715738444.72615163418.125145942.122128873.721123110.520117410.519111710.518106021.11377510.5 Open table in a new tab The generality of the VNTR phenomenon among species was examined by attempting to demonstrate its occurrence in the bovine system. The rat (5Doege K. Sasaki M. Horigan E. Hassell J.R. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17757-17767Google Scholar), mouse (16Walcz E. Deak F. Erhardt P. Coulter S.N. Fulpo C. Horvath P. Doege K.J. Glant T.T. Genomics. 1994; 22: 364-371Google Scholar), and chicken (17Li H. Schwartz N.B. Vertel B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23504-23511Google Scholar) aggrecan cDNA sequences have been reported, and although a recognizable variant of the human repeat region can be seen in all cases, the sequences are poorly conserved as a group for each species relative to the level of the human repeats. Partial bovine cDNA sequences have been published (13Oldberg A. Antonsson P. Heinegard D. Biochem. J. 1987; 243: 255-259Google Scholar, 14Antonsson P. Heinegard D. Oldberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16170-16173Google Scholar), but these non-overlapping clones do not include the CS domain sequence where the repeat region would be expected. The human and bovine sequences both share related KS hexapeptide repeats however (14Antonsson P. Heinegard D. Oldberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16170-16173Google Scholar), suggesting the CS repeats might also be similar, at least in level of conservation. Accordingly, the bovine CS-encoding region was cloned by PCR amplification from genomic DNA, using primer sequences from the published sequence flanking the gap region. The sequence determined from this PCR clone indeed contains a series of conserved repeats similar in size and number to the human conserved region, but the degree of conservation is lower in the bovine case (Fig.2). The rat repeat region sequence is presented for comparison and shows repeats that are conserved as a group even less well than the bovine. It is possibly due to this lower degree of sequence conservation that there has been no detectable polymorphism in approximately 20 bovine genomic DNA samples that have been examined by PCR (data not shown). These samples were obtained from different breeds and geographical regions in an effort to overcome the effects of agricultural inbreeding, but it may be that cattle from sufficiently isolated or distantly removed populations would still show some variation at this locus. At least it can be said that the repeated region in bovine is not polymorphic for the practical purpose of serving as an experimental system. Concurrently with this work, a bovine aggrecan cDNA clone encoding the CS domain was obtained in similar fashion by another group and sequenced, and the repeat region in that clone appears virtually identical to that reported here. 2Dr. Tom Hering, Case Western Reserve University, personal communication. This sequence is now available in GenBank (accession number U76615). The two shortest human alleles, 13 and 18, were cloned and sequenced, and the repeat structure compared with the previously sequenced allele 22 (Fig. 3). This comparison confirms that these alleles result from varying numbers of repeats and not from interpolation of some other sequence or amplification of some other unrelated sequence. The fine structure of these repeats can be examined because the near-identical repeats do show some variation, particularly in the penultimate codon, which may encode either threonine or alanine (Fig.2). Even where the amino acid sequences are identical, types of repeats can be distinguished by a third-base change in codon 17 of the 19-codon repeat, permitting four classes of repeats to be distinguished on the basis of these two adjacent codons: ACC ACT, ACC GCT, ACT GCT, and ACT ACT. On this basis, alleles 13 and 18 are rather similar, differing primarily by an expansion of the number of type III repeats in allele 18. It should be noted that three repeats in the middle of allele 18 could not be conclusively identified, due to the technical difficulties of sequencing such repeated regions; a deletion strategy will be required to sequence the longer alleles. Allele 22 shows several changes in the repeat pattern, including an expansion of type I repeats, a loss of type III repeats, and the introduction of a large body of type II repeats, not seen in the other two alleles. Allele 22 harbors one repeat that was not originally sequenced and has still not been determined. This unknown repeat is arbitrarily placed between the blocks of II and III repeats because it is most likely to be one of these types. Additionally, there are a few other changes in these repeats, shown boxed in Fig. 3, that may have arisen either by complex shuffling of repeat types or by point mutation within a block of repeats. VNTR polymorphisms, or hypervariable minisatellite regions, are extremely valuable tools in linkage analysis, providing high levels of heterozygosity (18Jeffreys A.J. Wilson V. Thein S.L. Nature. 1985; 314: 67-73Google Scholar). These loci are polymorphic by virtue of different numbers of conserved repeat sequences, probably generated by unequal crossing over during mitosis or meiosis (19Jeffreys A.J. Royle N.J. Wilson V. Wong Z. Nature. 1988; 332: 278-281Google Scholar). The polymorphic nature is correlated with degree of repeat conservation (18Jeffreys A.J. Wilson V. Thein S.L. Nature. 1985; 314: 67-73Google Scholar). These minisatellites almost always are associated with non-coding regions in the genome; the only exceptions previously reported are members of the mucin family (20Gum Jr., J.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1992; 7: 557-564Google Scholar) and, recently, the p57KIP2 gene (21Tokino T. Urano T. Furuhata T. Matsushima M. Miyatsu T. Sasaki S. Nakamura Y. Hum. Genet. 1996; 97: 625-631Google Scholar). Mucins share several features with proteoglycans, including long stretches of repetitive sequence used for carbohydrate attachment; there is no similarity in these sequences however between mucins and aggrecan. One such mucin, the human epithelial mucin cloned from breast and pancreatic tumor cells (22Gendler S.J. Lancaster C.A. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Duhig T. Peat N. Burchell J. Pemberton L. Lalani E.-N. Wilson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15286-15293Google Scholar), consists of 20 to 100 repeats of a 20-amino acid sequence. This range in repeat number is much greater than seen in the aggrecan expressed VNTR repeats; the number of different alleles is also much higher for this mucin. The functional consequences of the length variation has not been explored for the mucins, and in fact the properties of mucins may be rather insensitive to variations in mucin core protein lengths. The p57KIP2 gene, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase, has a proline-alanine repeat domain of 40 hexanucleotide repeats, which are polymorphic in that 7–15% of individuals have 12-nucleotide deletions. The GC-rich character of these short repeats recalls the triplet repeat type of mutations (23Caskey C.T. Pizzuti A. Fu Y.-H. Fenwick Jr., R.G. Nelson D. Science. 1992; 256: 784-789Google Scholar). There are numerous cases of variation in numbers of repeated sequences in related proteins, and perhaps not surprisingly these are often carbohydrate-bearing domains. These variants occur in different members of multigene families, as for the trout apo-polysialoglycoproteins (24Sorimachi Y. Emori Y. Kawasaki H. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Suzuki K. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17678-17684Google Scholar), or as evolutionary variants in closely related species, as for the involucrin gene (25Djian P. Green H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5321-5325Google Scholar). These examples may indicate tolerance for such core protein length variation but may also reflect compensatory changes in other tissue components. The aggrecan gene variation is unique, as the variation in repeats occurs at a polymorphic locus within a single population, as for mucins; yet unlike mucins the molecule is a primary functional component of a stable tissue, interacts with several other components of that tissue, and may contribute to a subtle tissue architecture, in addition to its bulk properties. There are two major aspects that may be affected by this variation in aggrecan repeat length (Fig. 4). Most obvious is the chondroitin-sulfate content. Each repeat contains two possible attachment points for CS, so that extreme range alleles 33 and 13 might vary by as many as 40 CS chains per core protein monomer. It is not known whether all serine-glycine pairs in the molecule are equally likely to receive CS chains, but if full substitution is assumed, there would be a range of 172 to 132 CS chains between these two alleles, respectively, representing a 30% variation. It is not clear what the consequences of such a difference in GAG content might mean functionally for cartilage, assuming all other variables in this complex system are unchanged; it is of course possible that chain length or percentage of sites substituted may differ in these individuals and thus compensate for acceptor site number. Differences in sulfation produce profound changes in cartilage, as seen in the brachymorphic mouse (26Orkin R.W. Pratt R.M. Martin G.R. Dev. Biol. 1976; 50: 82-94Google Scholar), and the recently identified diastrophic dysplasia gene as a sulfate transporter (27Hastbacka J. De la Chapelle A. Mahtani M.M. Clines G. Reeve-Daly M.P. Daly M. Hamilton B.A. Kusumi K. Trivedi B. Weaver A. Coloma A. Lovett M. Buckler A. Kaitila I. Lander E.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 1073-1087Google Scholar). The chondroitin sulfate chains of aggrecan undergo changes in size and number with aging, and these changes have been implicated in the onset of osteoarthritis (28Hardingham T. Bayliss M. Semin. Arthritis Rheum. 1990; 20: 12-33Google Scholar). It is possible that individuals expressing extreme repeat number alleles for the aggrecan expressed VNTR possess cartilage with unusual physical properties or that may show compensatory changes in aggrecan expression level, CS chain length, CS attachment site utilization, or sulfation pattern. The length of the core protein varies directly with repeat number, and this length variation also may lead to changes in cartilage function. The CS-bearing part of aggrecan is thought to attain an extended rod-like structure, so that more repeats should correlate with a longer core protein. The range in the CS domain would be 1538 to 1158 amino acids (allele 33 to allele 13), of which 589 to 209 are in the CS repeat domain; this range predicts a CS region length difference of 33%. This difference in core protein length may affect some critical spacing or packing aspects of cartilage. Aggrecan is anchored at the amino terminus by the hyaluronan/link protein binding of the G1 domain, but the carboxyl-terminal G3 domain also is likely to be involved in binding to some component of cartilage. The G3 domain of aggrecan has been shown to have lectin-like activity (29Halberg D.F. Proulx G. Doege K. Yamada Y. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9486-9490Google Scholar), and the similar domain of the related aggrecan family member versican has been reported to bind a variety of matrix molecules, most notably tenascin-R (30Aspberg A. Binkert C. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10590-10594Google Scholar) and heparin sulfate (31Ujita M. Shinomura T. Ito K. Kitagawa Y. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27603-27609Google Scholar). While the GAG attachment domain of versican does not show the same type of conserved repeat sequence as aggrecan and is unlikely to vary in repeat number, it does undergo alternative splicing, producing molecules with varied spacing between G1 and G3 domains (32Ito K. Shinomura T. Zako M. Ujita M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 270: 958-965Google Scholar,33Naso M.F. Zimmermann D.R. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32999-33008Google Scholar). Variation in spacing between binding domains might be expected to have disruptive effects on tissue architecture, if the ligands are relatively fixed in position. Such disruption might be greater if two alleles are expressed together in the tissue; it is currently not known if both alleles of an individual heterozygous for aggrecan are expressed together and/or at an equal level in cartilage. The structure of the proteins expressed from these various polymorphic alleles has not been investigated; different alleles must be expressed in different individuals, however, as several alleles have been observed in the homozygous condition; these include alleles 28, 27, 26, and 22 (data not shown). The low frequency of most of the alleles (Table I) is probably the reason that homozygous individuals for the extreme forms of the gene have not been observed; it is also likely that other allelic forms exist in the population and would be observed in a larger sampling. We have analyzed the allelic distribution pattern for this gene in an independent population similar in size to that reported here, with very similar observed frequencies of these same alleles. 3W. E. Horton, Jr., R. Balakir, P. Precht, C. Plato, J. D. Tobin, M. Lethbridge-Cejku, L. Meek, and K. Doege, submitted for publication. There are numerous unanswered questions about the expression of such alleles, including whether both alleles in a heterozygote are expressed, whether both appear in equivalent amount and pattern in the matrix, as well as the questions regarding the glycosaminoglycan components raised above. Since these alleles occur widely in the population, the effects of the polymorphisms are obviously tolerated, and any proposed consequences would fall by necessity within the range of functional parameters seen in the population. One such potential consequence of different alleles might be a subtle variation in cartilage function affecting the resistance of an individual's articular cartilage to the onset of joint degeneration or osteoarthritis. These conditions occur widely with aging but to different degrees of severity and ages of onset in the population. The etiology of these disorders is undoubtedly complex and is under intense investigation, but a genetic component is suspected in families with early onset osteoarthritis, and in some cases has been demonstrated (see Ref. 34Jimenez S.A. Dharmavaram R.M. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1994; 53: 789-797Google Scholar, and references therein). In such a widespread disease, the type of variation seen at the polymorphic aggrecan locus may provide an explanation for cartilage with a common but subtle reduction in functionality. Support for this hypothesis has recently been obtained in a population study linking one of the aggrecan VNTR alleles to bilateral hand osteoarthritis.3 It is perhaps surprising that this type of aggrecan polymorphism only appears in humans, of the species so far examined. The occurrence of the polymorphism in other species has only been directly tested in cows, but the level of conservation of the repeats is insufficient in other species to support unequal crossing over and generation of different repeat numbers. The polymorphism depends on a high degree of sequence conservation, leading to the question of why the sequences are so highly conserved in humans alone of the species so far examined. The actual repeat sequence is somewhat different in the various species (Fig. 2). The human repeat is unique in conserving the two closely spaced serine-glycine pairs in the middle of the repeat; the bovine and rat repeats have lost one of the middle serine-glycine pairs in favor of an additional one at the beginning, which is uniformly a proline-glycine pair in human repeats. Until more is known about the utilization of particular serine-glycine pairs as CS acceptor sequences, as well as details of cartilage ultrastructure, it is difficult to speculate on the consequences of these different repeat structures. Sequencing of the three shortest alleles confirms that they have arisen by some mechanism that expands or contracts blocks of repeated sequences, probably unequal exchange during meiosis or mitosis. There are several points of divergence among these three sequences, so the evolution has been complex and probably these three alleles are distantly related in the allelic “family.” The other alleles require sequencing to clarify the relationship. It is also possible that there may be multiple alleles of the same repeat number that have arisen independently and show a different pattern of amplified repeats. This has not been observed and would require screening by extensive sequencing. The median allele size, 25 repeats, is smaller than the mean of 27 repeats; the smaller repeat number alleles are thus over-represented. The smaller repeat alleles are probably more stable than the larger repeat alleles, which may be more likely to recombine; in addition, the large alleles may be more difficult to detect using the PCR assay. Finally, the sample size may not be large enough to provide a true representation of allele frequencies. We gratefully acknowledge Stephanie Willis for performance of automated DNA sequencing."

Here we report a new inhibitor of cysteine proteinases isolated from sea anemone Actinia equina. The inhibitor, equistatin, is an acidic protein with pI 4.7 and molecular weight of 14,129. It binds tightly and rapidly to cathepsin L (ka = 5.7 × 107m−1 s−1, Ki = 0.051 nm) and papain (ka = 1.2 × 107m−1 s−1,Ki = 0.57 nm). The lower affinity for cathepsin B (Ki = 1.4 nm) was shown to be due mainly to a lower second order association rate constant (ka = 0.04 × 106m−1 s−1). The inhibitor is composed of 128 amino acids forming two repeated domains with 48% identity. Neither of the domains shows any sequence homology to cystatins, but they do show a significant homology to thyroglobulin type-1 domains.

In each of the domains of the equistatin, the three residues are similarly conserved, and the sequences Val-Trp-Cys-Val and Cys-Trp-Cys-Val are present in domains a and b, respectively.

Grimmelikhuijzen C.J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22534-22541PubMed Google Scholar), but little is known about the presence of proteolytic enzymes and their inhibitors. A chymotrypsin-like protease was first isolated from Metridium senile and shown to possess the same zymogen activation and active site chemistry as the proteinase from mammalian pancreas (4Gibson D.

Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1987; 386: 1297-1304Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The inhibitor was found to be a nonclassical Kazal-type inhibitor with respect to positioning of the half-cystines. More recently, the structure of a Kunitz-type proteinase inhibitor purified from the Caribbean sea anemone Stichodactyla heliantus has been determined by NMR spectroscopy (11Antuch W. Berndt K.D. Chavez M.A. Delfin J. Wüthrich K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 675-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cysteine proteinases are members of one of the four mechanistic classes of proteinases and, together with their endogenous protein inhibitors, cystatins, play an important role in intracellular degradation (12Turk V. Bode W. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). They have not yet been found in sea anemones. In this article we describe the isolation of a new inhibitor of papain-like cysteine proteinases from sea anemone, Actinia equina, designated as equistatin, the kinetic properties of its interaction with papain-like cysteine proteinases, and its amino acid sequence. Papain (2 × crystallized) and clostripain were purchased from Sigma (Germany), and Ep-475, 1The abbreviations used are: Ep-475,l-3-carboxy-trans-2,3-epoxypropylleucylamido-(3-guanidino)butane; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl. a specific inhibitor of cysteine proteinases, was obtained from Peptide Research Foundation (Japan). TheStaphylococcus aureus V8 proteinase was obtained from Miles (UK), and glycyl endopeptidase was a gift from Dr. Alan J. Barrett (The Babraham Institute, Cambridge, UK) and was prepared as described (13Buttle D.J. Kembhavi A.A. Sharp S. Schute R.E. Rich D.H. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recombinant human cathepsin B and human cathepsin L were prepared as described previously (14Kuhelj R. Dolinar M. Pungerčar J. Turk V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 15Turk B. Dolenc I. Turk V. Bieth J.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). A. equina specimens were collected on the northern coast of the Adriatic sea. The anemones (3 kg) were frozen, partially thawed, cut into small pieces, and homogenized in 4.5 liters of deionized water. Nonsoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant was adjusted to pH 10.5 and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Neutralization to pH 7.0 was followed by additional centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 45 min. The clear supernatant was applied to a carboxymethyl papain-Sepharose column (6 × 10 cm) previously equilibrated with 0.01m Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 m NaCl and 0.1% Brij. After thorough washing of the column, bound proteins were eluted with 0.01 m NaOH. Fractions (20 ml) were collected and assayed for inhibitory activity toward papain using benzoyl-dl-Arg-β-naphthylamide as substrate (16Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1677) Google Scholar). The inhibitory fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon YM-5). The concentrate was applied to a Sephadex G-50 column (4.5 × 140 cm) equilibrated with 0.01 m Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.7, containing 0.1 m NaCl, and eluted at a flow rate of 18 ml/h. Inhibitory fractions with molecular weights of about 16,000 were pooled, concentrated (Amicon, YM-5), and dialyzed against 0.01m Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.2. The dialyzed sample was then applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column (2 × 25 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed extensively, and bound proteins were eluted with a linear salt gradient (0–0.1 m NaCl in 0.01 m Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.2) at a flow rate 18 ml/h. Equistatin eluted at 0.07 m NaCl. SDS-PAGE and isoelectric focusing were performed on a PhastSystem apparatus (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. The inhibitor and molecular weight markers ranging fromMr 14,400 to 94,000 were run in the presence of 0.5% SDS and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol on an 8–25% gradient polyacrylamide gel. The pI of the inhibitor was determined by calibrating the gel with isoelectric focusing marker proteins with pI values ranging from 3.5 to 8.15. Equistatin was reduced overnight with β-mercaptoethanol at 37 °C andS-pyridylethylated (17Henschen A. Wittman-Liebold B. Salnikov J. Erdmann V.A. Advanced Methods in Protein Microsequence Analysis. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1986: 244-255Crossref Google Scholar). Pyridylethylated equistatin was hydrolyzed with glycyl endopeptidase as described (18Buttle D.J. Ritonja A. Pearl L.H. Turk V. Barrett A.J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 260: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). 4 nmol of pyridylethylated equistatin were fragmented using 2% (w/w) S. aureus V8 proteinase in 0.5 m sodium lactate buffer, pH 4.0, at 37 °C for 20 h. Both enzyme hydrolyses were performed in a final volume of 500 μl. Reactions were stopped by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid. The resulting peptide mixtures were separated by high performance liquid chromatography (Milton Roy Co.) using a reverse phase ChromSpher C18 column equilibrated with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water. Elutions was performed using various linear gradients of 80% (v/v) acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The absorbance was monitored at 215 nm. Protein samples were hydrolyzed in 6.0 m HCl at 110 °C for 24 h. Analyses of the peptide hydrolysates were performed on an Applied Biosystems 421A amino acid analyzer with precolumn phenylisothiocyanate derivatization. An applied Biosystems liquid pulse sequencer 475A, connected on line to a phenylthiohydantoin analyzer 120A from the same manufacturer, was used for automated amino acid sequence analyses. Protein concentration of equistatin was determined by absorption measurements at 280 nm using a molar absorption coefficient of 28,600m−1 cm−1 determined by the method of Pace et al. (19Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3272) Google Scholar) from the amino acid sequence or by the method of Lowry et al. (20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. The concentration of papain was determined spectrophotometrically using a molar absorption coefficient of 56,200m−1 cm−1 (21Brocklehurst K. Carlson J. Kierstan M.P.J. Crook E.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 573-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The following buffers were used in all kinetic and equilibrium studies: 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 5 mm dithiothreitol and 1 mm EDTA (for papain and cathepsin B) or 0.34 msodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 5 mmdithiothreitol and 1 mm EDTA (for cathepsin L). Active site titrations of cathepsins B and L were performed using cysteine proteinase inhibitor Ep-475 as described previously (22Turk B. Križaj I. Kralj B. Dolenc I. Popović T. Bieth J.G. Turk V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7323-7329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Papain, further purified by affinity chromatography (23Blumberg S. Schechter I. Berger A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 15: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), had a thiol content of 0.92 ± 0.05 mol/mol of enzyme as determined by reaction with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). Active site-titrated papain was used to titrate equistatin as follows. Papain (0.1 μm final concentration) was incubated with increasing amounts of equistatin (0–0.2 μm final concentration) in 200 μl of 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 5 mm dithiothreitol and 1 mmEDTA at 25 °C. After 15 min of incubation, 1800 μl of 100 μm Z-Phe-Arg p-nitroanilide was added, and the residual activity of papain was monitored as described previously at 410 nm with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 18 spectrophotometer (22Turk B. Križaj I. Kralj B. Dolenc I. Popović T. Bieth J.G. Turk V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7323-7329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data were analyzed by computer fitting to the theoretical binding equation (24Bieth J.G. Biochem. Med. 1984; 32: 387-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The kinetics of the reaction between equistatin and papain, cathepsin B, and cathepsin L were analyzed by continuous measurements of the loss of enzymatic activity in the presence of substrate under pseudo first-order conditions with at least a 10-fold molar excess of inhibitor. Equistatin in increasing concentrations and the fluorogenic substrate (10 μm Z-Phe-Arg 4-methyl-7-coumarylamide) were mixed in a cuvette with buffer (see above) to a final volume of 1.97 ml. The enzyme (30 μl) was added, and the release of product was monitored continuously at excitation and emission wavelengths of 370 and 460 nm, respectively, by a Perkin-Elmer LS50 spectrofluorimeter. The biphasic progress curves were recorded and analyzed according to the model of slow tight binding kinetics using the equation of Morrison (25Morrison J.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1982; 7: 102-105Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (487) Google Scholar): [P] =vs t + (vz −vs)(1 −e −kt)/k, where [P] is the product concentration, vz and vs are the initial and the steady-state velocities, respectively, t is time, and k is the observed pseudo first-order rate constant for the establishment of equilibrium between enzyme and inhibitor.ka (association rate constant) andkd (dissociation rate constant) values were obtained from the dependence of k on [I] according to the equationsk = ka·[I]/(1 +S/Km) + kd andkd =k·vi/vz. Theka values were corrected for substrate competition using the Km values of 65 μm for papain (26Zucker S. Buttle D.J. Nicklin J.H. Barrett A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 828: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), 2 μm for cathepsin L (27Mason R.W. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and 150 μm for cathepsin B (16Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1677) Google Scholar). Ki values were then determined from both individual rate constants (=kd/ka). Less than 3% of the substrate was hydrolyzed during the experiments throughout. Equistatin was purified fromA. equina by a procedure similar to that used for the isolation of cysteine proteinase inhibitors of human origin (28Lenarčič B. Ritonja A. Šali A. Kotnik M. Turk V. Machleidt W. Turk V. Cysteine Proteinases and Their Inhibitors. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1986: 473-487Crossref Google Scholar). Initially, the supernatant was exposed to alkaline pH to dissociate the complexes between the inhibitor and other proteins. The most selective purification step, affinity chromatography on carboxymethyl papain-Sepharose, then allowed separation of papain-inhibiting proteins from the majority of noninhibitory proteins. This was followed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-50 (Fig. 1 A), where the low molecular weight inhibitor (equistatin) was separated from highMr inhibitor(s) of cysteine proteinases, which were not further characterized. Final purification was achieved by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography, from which the inhibitor eluted as a single peak at 0.07 m NaCl (Fig. 1 B). About 5 mg of pure equistatin was obtained from 3 kg (fresh weight) of sea anemones. On SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, equistain migrates as a single band withMr of about 16,000 (Fig.2 A). The molecular weight is higher than the molecular weights of either stefins or cystatins (Mr ∼ 11,000 and 13,000, respectively) but lower than those of kininogens (Mr ∼ 50,000–100,000) (12Turk V.

The stefins, the cystatins, and the kininogens are proteins with similar sequences and, until recently, were the only known endogenous inhibitors of papain-like cysteine proteinases. On analytical isoelectric focusing, the inhibitor is shown to be an acidic protein with a pI value of 4.7. Very faint bands with pI values of 4.9 and 4.5, probably corresponding to the isoforms of the inhibitor (see below for explanation), could also be seen (Fig.2 B). The major and minor N-terminal amino acid sequences, labeled NI-1 andNI-2, respectively, are shown in Fig.3 A. Sequence analyses of the peptides derived from glycyl endopeptidase digestion provided the amino acid sequence of the whole molecule (Fig. 3 A). The largest peptide,G-3, spanned the middle part of the inhibitor and overlapped with both NI sequences. The C-terminal sequence was confirmed by peptides G-5 and G-(5+6), which ended with a pyridylethylated Cys residue that is not a glycyl endopeptidase cleavage site. Additional overlapping peptides, designated as E peptides (Fig. 3 A) were obtained by S. aureus V8 proteinase digestion. During protein sequence analysis we have observed sequence polymorphism mainly in the middle part of the molecule (Fig. 3 A). However, the yield of these residues was lower than 20% when compared with the main sequence. The observed sequence heterogeneity together with the results of isoelectric focusing reveals the presence of at least two closely related isoforms. As the isolation procedure involves the use of many anemone specimens, the difference in amino acid composition could arise from allelic polymorphism. The inhibitor comprises 128 amino acid residues including these 11 cysteines and has a molecular weight of 14,129. The inhibitor has no potential glycosylation sites of the Asn-X-(Thr/Ser) type. Alignment of equistatin residues 1–64 with 65–128 shows that the inhibitor consists of a tandem repeat with 48% identity and 60% similarity (Fig.3 B). This indicates that equistatin derives from a single ancestral gene that was duplicated and modified during evolution. However, neither domain shows any sequence homology with the members of the cystatin superfamily (12Turk V. Bode W.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2247-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) revealed high sequence similarity with thyroglobulin type-1 domain, a domain of about 65 amino acid residues that repeats 10 times in the N-terminal part of thyroglobulin (32Malthiery Y. Lissitzky S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 165: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). A number of other proteins containing the thyroglobulin type-1 domain motif were found. These proteins display a variety of physiological functions in different organisms. Major histocompatibility complex class II-associated p41 invariant chain fragment and chum salmon egg cysteine proteinase inhibitor are potent inhibitors of papain-like cysteine proteinases (33Bevec T.

Nidogen is a glycoprotein that probably plays a central role in the supramolecular organization of basement membranes and is tightly associated with laminin (36Mann K. Deutzmann R. Aumailley M.

Insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins act as inhibitors of insulin-like growth factor (37Allander S.V. Larsson C. Ehrenborg E. Suwanichkul A. Weber G. Morris S.L. Bajalica S. Kiefer M.C.

Saxiphilin, characterized by a high affinity for a neurotoxin, saxitoxin (38Morabito M.A. Moczydlowski E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1995; 92: 6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and a tumor-associated cell surface antigen known also as GA733 are proteins whose functions are not yet elucidated (40Szala S. Froehlich M. Scollon M. Kasai Y. Steplewski Z. Koprowski H. Linnenbach A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3542-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 A shows a schematic diagram of the regions of similarity between equistatin and proteins containing the thyroglobulin type-1 domain, and Fig. 4 B shows a sequence alignment relative to the thyroglobulin type-1 domains of equistatin. By introducing only a few short gaps in the alignment, the amino acid identities between the thyroglobulin type-1 domains in equistatin and those in all the other proteins listed in Fig. 4 B are approximately 40% for the 49 C-terminal amino acids of both domains. The cysteine-rich sequence motif Cys-Trp-Cys-Val and the positions of some other amino acids (Cys-24, Cys-60, Pro-22, Gln-34, Gly-28, and Gly-49; equista in Fig. 4 B) were found to be highly conserved among all related repeats, indicating that the proteins are probably evolutionarily related. The sequence data suggest that the two sequentially homologous parts of equistatin (Fig. 3 B) may form two potential proteinase binding sites. The binding stoichiometry of papain (active concentration ≥95%) and equistatin was therefore determined by titration monitored by the loss of enzymatic activity. 0.95 ± 0.04 mol of equistatin was needed to saturate 1 mol of papain, indicating that the two proteins formed an equimolar complex (Fig. 5). It could be suggested that binding of one proteinase molecule to equistatin prevents binding of the second proteinase molecule, probably by steric hindrance. However, there are a number of other possibilities. (i) One of the domains is not inhibitory at all, as observed in the kininogens (41Salvesen G. Parkes C. Abrahamson M. Grubb A. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). (ii) One of the domains has substantially lower affinity for proteinases, as found for the mucus proteinase inhibitor interaction with various serine proteinases (42Boudier C. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4370-4375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (iii) Both domains bind to the same proteinase molecule but only one of them binds to the active site; the other binds to another site distant from the active site, as reported for rhodiin binding to thrombin (43van de Locht A. Lamba D. Bauer M. Huber R. Friedrich T. Kröger B. Höffken W. Bode W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5149-5157Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Additional spectroscopic and structural studies involving mutant proteins will therefore be needed to clarify which of the above hypotheses is correct. The kinetics of binding of equistatin to papain and cathepsins B and L were studied under pseudo first-order conditions assuming 1:1 binding stoichiometry (see above). The pseudo first-order rate constants were found to increase linearly with increasing concentrations of inhibitor [I], in agreement with the proposed binding mechanism (25Morrison J.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1982; 7: 102-105Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Values of the second-order rate constants (ka), the dissociation rate constants (kd), and the equilibrium constants (Ki) are presented in TableI. Rapid binding of equistatin to cathepsin L and papain was observed, but the complexes with papain were ∼10-fold less stable, with a 5-fold lower association rate constant and a 2-fold higher dissociation rate constant. The rate of complex formation between equistatin and cathepsin B was substantially slower. Itska value is >30-fold lower than those for cathepsin L and papain, also reflected in the increased Kivalue although the overall effect is partially compensated by a lowerkd value. Cathepsin B (44Musil Dj. Zucic D. Turk D. Engh R.A. Mayr I. Huber R. Popović T. Turk V. Towatari T. Katunuma N. Bode W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2321-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) differs from papain (45Kamphuis I.G. Kalk K.H. Swarte M.B.A. Drenth J. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 233-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) and its homologue cathepsin L (46Coulombe R. Grochulski P. Sivaraman J. Menard R. Mort J.S. Cygler M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5492-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) by having an additional loop of about 20 amino acids, which partially occludes the active site, thus interfering with inhibitor binding (47Lenarčič B. Križaj I. Žunec P. Turk V. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The association rate constants, ka, together with their standard errors were calculated from the dependence of the pseudo first-order rate constant on inhibitor concentration. Dissociation rate constants, kd, were calculated for each inhibitor concentration as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The equilibrium inhibition constants (Ki) were calculated from ka and kd. The number of measurements is given in parentheses. The kinetic and equilibrium constants for the interaction of equistatin with cathepsins L and B and papain are similar to those reported for the interactions of these enzymes with cystatins (12Turk V. Bode W. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 22Turk B. Križaj I. Kralj B. Dolenc I. Popović T. Bieth J.G. Turk V. J. Biol.

TheKi values are also in reasonable agreement with those obtained for various forms of chum salmon egg cysteine proteinase inhibitor (34Yamashita M. Konagaya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1282-1284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 48Yamashita M. Konagaya S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1991; 110: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) although they differ significantly from the values for the p41 form of invariant chain fragment. The latter was found to be a stronger inhibitor of cathepsin L (∼10-fold) and a weaker inhibitor of papain (∼3-fold) but did not inhibit cathepsin B at all (33Bevec T. Stoka V. Pungerčič G. Dolenc I. Turk V. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1331-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In conclusion, a new protein inhibitor of papain-like cysteine proteinases was isolated from sea anemone A. equina. The inhibitor, equistatin, is distinct from cystatins but shares significant sequence homology with two other chum salmon egg cysteine proteinase inhibitors, p41 invariant chain fragment and cysteine proteinase inhibitor. The three inhibitors were therefore suggested to form a new superfamily of cysteine proteinase inhibitors. The thyroglobulin type-1 domain motif, common to all three inhibitors, has been identified in a variety of other proteins. Whether this highly conserved thyroglobulin type-1 element indeed acts as an inhibitor of cysteine proteinases in these proteins remains to be established as well as the mechanism of binding to cysteine proteinases. We thank Dr. Aleksander Lucu for providing us with sea anemones and Dr. Iztok Dolenc and Robert Kuhelj for their gifts of cathepsins L and B, respectively. We also thank Dr. Roger H.

Recently, α-dystroglycan was demonstrated to be an extracellular laminin-binding protein anchored to the cell membrane by a transmembrane protein β-dystroglycan in striated muscle and Schwann cells. However, the biological functions of the dystroglycan-laminin interaction remain obscure, and in particular, it is still unclear if dystroglycan plays a role in cell adhesion. In the present study, we characterized the role of dystroglycan in the adhesion of schwannoma cells to laminin-1. Immunochemical analysis demonstrated that the dystroglycan complex, comprised of α- and β-dystroglycan, was a major laminin-binding protein complex in the surface membrane of rat schwannoma cell line RT4. It also demonstrated the presence of α-dystroglycan, but not β-dystroglycan, in the culture medium, suggesting secretion of α-dystroglycan by RT4 cells. RT4 cells cultured on dishes coated with laminin-1 became spindle in shape and adhered to the bottom surface tightly. Monoclonal antibody IIH6 against α-dystroglycan was shown previously to inhibit the binding of laminin-1 to α-dystroglycan. In the presence of IIH6, but not several other control antibodies in the culture medium, RT4 cells remained round in shape and did not adhere to the bottom surface. The adhesion of RT4 cells to dishes coated with fibronectin was not affected by IIH6. The known inhibitors of the interaction of α-dystroglycan with laminin-1, including EDTA, sulfatide, fucoidan, dextran sulfate, heparin, and sialic acid, also perturbed the adhesion of RT4 cells to laminin-1, whereas the reagents which do not inhibit the interaction, including dextran, chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and GlcNAc, did not. Altogether, these results support a role for dystroglycan as a major cell adhesion molecule in the surface membrane of RT4 cells.

Altogether, these results support a role for dystroglycan as a major cell adhesion molecule in the surface membrane of RT4 cells. There is now mounting evidence that the intracellular signal transduction pathways activated by the adhesion of cells to other cells or the extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; BSA, bovine serum albumin; cLSM, confocal laser scanning microscope; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; BSA, bovine serum albumin; cLSM, confocal laser scanning microscope; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. play crucial roles in cellular differentiation, migration, and proliferation. The prototypical cell adhesion molecules are the cell surface receptors for the ECM glycoproteins. Dystroglycan, originally identified as a member of the sarcolemmal glycoproteins complexed with dystrophin, is encoded by a single gene and cleaved into two proteins α- and β-dystroglycan by posttranslational processing (1Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O.

Cell. 1991; 66: 1121-1131Google Scholar). α-Dystroglycan is an extracellular glycoprotein anchored to the cell membrane by a transmembrane glycoprotein β-dystroglycan, and the complex comprised of α- and β-dystroglycan is called the dystroglycan complex (2Ervasti J.M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25956-25959Google Scholar). In striated muscle, α-dystroglycan binds the ECM components laminin-1 and -2 in a Ca2+-dependent manner (3Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 809-823Google Scholar, 5Sunada Y. Bernier S.M. Kozak C.A. Yamada Y. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13729-13732Google Scholar, 6Pall E.A. Bolton K.M. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3817-3821Google Scholar). On the cytoplasmic side of the sarcolemma, β-dystroglycan is anchored to the cytoskeletal proteins dystrophin or its homologues (7Suzuki A. Yoshida M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27305-27310Google Scholar). Besides this structural role, β-dystroglycan is also proposed to play a role in signal transduction, based on the finding that its cytoplasmic domain contains a phosphotyrosine consensus sequence and several proline-rich regions that could associate with SH2 and SH3 domains of signaling proteins (1Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Ervasti J.M. Leveille C.J. Slaughter C.A. Sernett S.W. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1992; 355: 696-702Google Scholar). Dystrophin deficiency causes a drastic reduction of the dystroglycan complex in the sarcolemma and, thus, the loss of the linkage between the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton and the ECM, eventually leading to muscle cell death in Duchenne muscular dystrophy and its animal model mdx mice (for reviews, see Refs. 9Campbell K.P.

In the peripheral nervous system, it is expressed in the Schwann cell membrane, and the Schwann cell α-dystroglycan binds not only laminin-1 but also laminin-2, a major component of the endoneurium, in a Ca2+-dependent manner (13Yamada H.

These findings have suggested roles for the dystroglycan-laminin interaction in not only the maintenance of sarcolemmal architecture but also peripheral myelinogenesis.Despite these recent developments, the biological functions of the dystroglycan complex remain obscure, and in particular, it has not yet been established if the dystroglycan complex is indeed involved in the process of cell adhesion. In the present study, we have identified the dystroglycan complex as a major laminin-binding protein complex in the surface membrane of rat schwannoma cell line RT4 and characterized its role in RT4 cell adhesion to laminin-1.DISCUSSIONα-Dystroglycan, which is an extracellular peripheral membrane glycoprotein anchored to the cell membrane by a transmembrane glycoprotein β-dystroglycan, binds laminin and agrin in striated muscle, neuromuscular junction, and Schwann cells (1Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O.

On the other hand, the cytoplasmic domain of β-dystroglycan contains a phosphotyrosine consensus sequence and several proline-rich regions that could associate with SH2 and SH3 domains of signaling proteins (1Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O.

Indeed, Grb2, an adaptor protein in the signal transduction pathways, was recently demonstrated to bind to the cytoplasmic proline-rich regions of β-dystroglycan via the two SH3 domains (35Yang B.

These findings have suggested a possible role for the dystroglycan complex, comprised of α- and β-dystroglycan, as a signaling receptor involved in the maintenance of sarcolemmal architecture, peripheral synaptogenesis, and myelinogenesis. In addition, the dystroglycan complex has also been implicated in kidney epithelial development, although its ECM ligand in kidney has not yet been identified (29Durbeej M. Larsson E.

Despite these recent developments, the precise roles of the interaction of the dystroglycan complex with ECM ligands in these specialized biological processes remain obscure, and in particular, it has not yet been confirmed if the dystroglycan complex plays a role in cell adhesion.Under these circumstances, identification of cell lines that express the dystroglycan complex in the surface membrane would provide us useful tools for testing the proposed functions of the dystroglycan complex in vivo. In the present study, we have demonstrated, by immunochemical analyses, that the dystroglycan complex, comprised of α- and β-dystroglycan, is a major laminin-binding protein complex in the surface membrane of rat schwannoma cell line RT4. Similar to Schwann cells (14Yamada H. Chiba A. Endo T. Kobata A. Anderson L.V.B. Hori H. Fukuta-Ohi H. Kanazawa I. Campbell K.P. Shimizu T. Matsumura K. J.

Ohlendieck K. Kahl S.D. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1992; 360: 588-591Google Scholar), was localized diffusely in the cytoplasm of RT4 cells and not associated with the dystroglycan complex. Thus, the putative membrane-associated cytoskeletal protein anchoring the dystroglycan complex to the underlying submembranous cytoskeleton remains to be elucidated.In the present study, we have also tested the role of α-dystroglycan in RT4 cell adhesion to laminin-1. When RT4 cells were cultured on laminin-1, they became spindle in shape immediately and adhered to the bottom surface tightly. However, when RT4 cells were cultured on laminin-1 in the presence of the known inhibitors of the interaction of α-dystroglycan with laminin-1, including EDTA, sulfatide, fucoidan, dextran sulfate, heparin, and sialic acid, they remained round in shape and did not adhere to the bottom surface. Because these reagents may also perturb the interaction of laminin-1 with the cell surface adhesion molecules other than α-dystroglycan, such as the members of the integrin family for instance, we have looked at the effects of monoclonal antibody IIH6 against α-dystroglycan, which inhibits the interaction of α-dystroglycan with laminin-1, and found that this antibody drastically reduces the adhesion of RT4 cells to laminin-1. Furthermore, IIH6 did not perturb the adhesion of RT4 cells to fibronectin. Together with the previous demonstration of high affinity binding of laminin-1 to α-dystroglycan (1Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Ervasti J.M. Leveille C.J. Slaughter C.A. Sernett S.W. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1992; 355: 696-702Google Scholar, 3Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 809-823Google Scholar), these results indicate a role for α-dystroglycan as a major cell adhesion molecule in the surface membrane of RT4 cells and suggest that the dystroglycan complex may play an important role in cell adhesion in vivo. Finally, we have demonstrated the results which suggest the secretion of α-dystroglycan by RT4 cells. In the future, it would be interesting to see if α-dystroglycan is secreted in vivoand if the secreted α-dystroglycan has inhibitory, and potentially regulatory, effects on the interaction of the cell surface α-dystroglycan with the ECM ligands.The mechanism by which the dystroglycan complex may mediate such diverse and specific biological processes as sarcolemmal stabilization, epithelial morphogenesis, synaptogenesis, and myelinogenesis remains unclear. For instance, it has been disputed if the dystroglycan complex is actively involved in the acetylcholine receptor clustering in the neuromuscular junction as a signaling receptor of agrin (31Sugiyama J.

Among others, our results seem consistent with at least two possibilities. First, the dystroglycan complex may function as a helper protein in these processes; the initial and high affinity binding of the ECM ligands to the dystroglycan complex may enable the more specific and functional cell surface receptors, such as the members of the integrin family or the putative myotube-associated specificity component (MASC), which was recently proposed to work in concert with the receptor tyrosine kinase MuSK in the neuromuscular junction formation, to interact with these ligands (31Sugiyama J. Bowen D.C. Hall Z.W. Neuron. 1994; 13: 103-115Google Scholar, 33Fallon J.R. Hall Z.W. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 469-473Google Scholar, 34Carbonetto S. Lindenbaum M. Curr. Opin.

Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1996; 85: 513-523Google Scholar). Second, the dystroglycan complex may function as a structural protein in the maturational stages of these processes. In this scenario, it would be intriguing to postulate that the binding of the ECM ligands to the dystroglycan complex may trigger the reorganization of the submembranous dystrophin/utrophin-cytoskeleton and lead to the stabilization of the cell membrane (44Cody R.L. Wicha M.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1986; 165: 107-116Google Scholar). The fact that the binding sites for dystrophin/utrophin and Grb2 overlap in the C terminus of β-dystroglycan raises a possibility that this process may be mediated by Grb2 and other signaling/adaptor proteins (8Jung D. Yang B. Meyer J. Chamberlain J.S. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27305-27310Google Scholar, 35Yang B. Jung D. Motto D. Meyer J. Koretzky G. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11711-11714Google Scholar). There is now mounting evidence that the intracellular signal transduction pathways activated by the adhesion of cells to other cells or the extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; BSA, bovine serum albumin; cLSM, confocal laser scanning microscope; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; BSA, bovine serum albumin; cLSM, confocal laser scanning microscope; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. play crucial roles in cellular differentiation, migration, and proliferation. The prototypical cell adhesion molecules are the cell surface receptors for the ECM glycoproteins. Dystroglycan, originally identified as a member of the sarcolemmal glycoproteins complexed with dystrophin, is encoded by a single gene and cleaved into two proteins α- and β-dystroglycan by posttranslational processing (1Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Ervasti J.M. Leveille C.J. Slaughter C.A. Sernett S.W. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1992; 355: 696-702Google Scholar, 2Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. Cell. 1991; 66: 1121-1131Google Scholar). α-Dystroglycan is an extracellular glycoprotein anchored to the cell membrane by a transmembrane glycoprotein β-dystroglycan, and the complex comprised of α- and β-dystroglycan is called the dystroglycan complex (2Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. Cell. 1991; 66: 1121-1131Google Scholar, 3Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 809-823Google Scholar, 4Deyst K.A. Bowe M.A. Leszyk J.D. Fallon J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25956-25959Google Scholar). In striated muscle, α-dystroglycan binds the ECM components laminin-1 and -2 in a Ca2+-dependent manner (3Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 809-823Google Scholar, 5Sunada Y. Bernier S.M. Kozak C.A. Yamada Y. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13729-13732Google Scholar, 6Pall E.A. Bolton K.M. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3817-3821Google Scholar). On the cytoplasmic side of the sarcolemma, β-dystroglycan is anchored to the cytoskeletal proteins dystrophin or its homologues (7Suzuki A. Yoshida M. Hayashi K. Mizuno Y. Hagiwara Y. Ozawa E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 283-292Google Scholar, 8Jung D. Yang B. Meyer J. Chamberlain J.S. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27305-27310Google Scholar). Besides this structural role, β-dystroglycan is also proposed to play a role in signal transduction, based on the finding that its cytoplasmic domain contains a phosphotyrosine consensus sequence and several proline-rich regions that could associate with SH2 and SH3 domains of signaling proteins (1Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Ervasti J.M. Leveille C.J. Slaughter C.A. Sernett S.W. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1992; 355: 696-702Google Scholar). Dystrophin deficiency causes a drastic reduction of the dystroglycan complex in the sarcolemma and, thus, the loss of the linkage between the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton and the ECM, eventually leading to muscle cell death in Duchenne muscular dystrophy and its animal model mdx mice (for reviews, see Refs. 9Campbell K.P. Cell. 1995; 80: 675-679Google Scholar and 10Ozawa E. Yoshida M. Suzuki A. Mizuno Y. Hagiwara Y. Noguchi S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1711-1716Google Scholar). The dystroglycan complex is also expressed in non-muscle tissues (1Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Ervasti J.M. Leveille C.J. Slaughter C.A. Sernett S.W. Campbell K.P.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 49-53Google Scholar). In the peripheral nervous system, it is expressed in the Schwann cell membrane, and the Schwann cell α-dystroglycan binds not only laminin-1 but also laminin-2, a major component of the endoneurium, in a Ca2+-dependent manner (13Yamada H.

These findings have suggested roles for the dystroglycan-laminin interaction in not only the maintenance of sarcolemmal architecture but also peripheral myelinogenesis. Despite these recent developments, the biological functions of the dystroglycan complex remain obscure, and in particular, it has not yet been established if the dystroglycan complex is indeed involved in the process of cell adhesion. In the present study, we have identified the dystroglycan complex as a major laminin-binding protein complex in the surface membrane of rat schwannoma cell line RT4 and characterized its role in RT4 cell adhesion to laminin-1.

Indeed, Grb2, an adaptor protein in the signal transduction pathways, was recently demonstrated to bind to the cytoplasmic proline-rich regions of β-dystroglycan via the two SH3 domains (35Yang B.

The fact that the binding sites for dystrophin/utrophin and Grb2 overlap in the C terminus of β-dystroglycan raises a possibility that this process may be mediated by Grb2 and other signaling/adaptor proteins (8Jung D. Yang B. Meyer J. Chamberlain J.S. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27305-27310Google Scholar, 35Yang B. Jung D. Motto D. Meyer J. Koretzky G. Campbell K.P. J. Biol.

Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 596-605Google Scholar). On the other hand, the cytoplasmic domain of β-dystroglycan contains a phosphotyrosine consensus sequence and several proline-rich regions that could associate with SH2 and SH3 domains of signaling proteins (1Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Ervasti J.M. Leveille C.J. Slaughter C.A. Sernett S.W. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1992; 355: 696-702Google Scholar, 35Yang B. Jung D. Motto D. Meyer J. Koretzky G. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11711-11714Google Scholar). Indeed, Grb2, an adaptor protein in the signal transduction pathways, was recently demonstrated to bind to the cytoplasmic proline-rich regions of β-dystroglycan via the two SH3 domains (35Yang B. Jung D. Motto D. Meyer J. Koretzky G. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11711-11714Google Scholar). These findings have suggested a possible role for the dystroglycan complex, comprised of α- and β-dystroglycan, as a signaling receptor involved in the maintenance of sarcolemmal architecture, peripheral synaptogenesis, and myelinogenesis. In addition, the dystroglycan complex has also been implicated in kidney epithelial development, although its ECM ligand in kidney has not yet been identified (29Durbeej M. Larsson E. Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Roberds S.L. Campbell K.P. Ekblom P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 79-91Google Scholar). Despite these recent developments, the precise roles of the interaction of the dystroglycan complex with ECM ligands in these specialized biological processes remain obscure, and in particular, it has not yet been confirmed if the dystroglycan complex plays a role in cell adhesion. Under these circumstances, identification of cell lines that express the dystroglycan complex in the surface membrane would provide us useful tools for testing the proposed functions of the dystroglycan complex in vivo. In the present study, we have demonstrated, by immunochemical analyses, that the dystroglycan complex, comprised of α- and β-dystroglycan, is a major laminin-binding protein complex in the surface membrane of rat schwannoma cell line RT4. Similar to Schwann cells (14Yamada H. Chiba A. Endo T. Kobata A. Anderson L.V.B. Hori H. Fukuta-Ohi H. Kanazawa I. Campbell K.P. Shimizu T. Matsumura K. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1518-1524Google Scholar), utrophin, which has the binding capacity for the cytoplasmic domain of β-dystroglycan (7Suzuki A. Yoshida M. Hayashi K. Mizuno Y. Hagiwara Y. Ozawa E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 283-292Google Scholar, 8Jung D. Yang B. Meyer J. Chamberlain J.S. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27305-27310Google Scholar, 36Matsumura K. Ervasti J.M. Ohlendieck K. Kahl S.D. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1992; 360: 588-591Google Scholar), was localized diffusely in the cytoplasm of RT4 cells and not associated with the dystroglycan complex. Thus, the putative membrane-associated cytoskeletal protein anchoring the dystroglycan complex to the underlying submembranous cytoskeleton remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we have also tested the role of α-dystroglycan in RT4 cell adhesion to laminin-1. When RT4 cells were cultured on laminin-1, they became spindle in shape immediately and adhered to the bottom surface tightly. However, when RT4 cells were cultured on laminin-1 in the presence of the known inhibitors of the interaction of α-dystroglycan with laminin-1, including EDTA, sulfatide, fucoidan, dextran sulfate, heparin, and sialic acid, they remained round in shape and did not adhere to the bottom surface. Because these reagents may also perturb the interaction of laminin-1 with the cell surface adhesion molecules other than α-dystroglycan, such as the members of the integrin family for instance, we have looked at the effects of monoclonal antibody IIH6 against α-dystroglycan, which inhibits the interaction of α-dystroglycan with laminin-1, and found that this antibody drastically reduces the adhesion of RT4 cells to laminin-1. Furthermore, IIH6 did not perturb the adhesion of RT4 cells to fibronectin. Together with the previous demonstration of high affinity binding of laminin-1 to α-dystroglycan (1Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Ervasti J.M. Leveille C.J. Slaughter C.A. Sernett S.W. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1992; 355: 696-702Google Scholar, 3Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 809-823Google Scholar), these results indicate a role for α-dystroglycan as a major cell adhesion molecule in the surface membrane of RT4 cells and suggest that the dystroglycan complex may play an important role in cell adhesion in vivo. Finally, we have demonstrated the results which suggest the secretion of α-dystroglycan by RT4 cells. In the future, it would be interesting to see if α-dystroglycan is secreted in vivoand if the secreted α-dystroglycan has inhibitory, and potentially regulatory, effects on the interaction of the cell surface α-dystroglycan with the ECM ligands. The mechanism by which the dystroglycan complex may mediate such diverse and specific biological processes as sarcolemmal stabilization, epithelial morphogenesis, synaptogenesis, and myelinogenesis remains unclear. For instance, it has been disputed if the dystroglycan complex is actively involved in the acetylcholine receptor clustering in the neuromuscular junction as a signaling receptor of agrin (31Sugiyama J.

Among others, our results seem consistent with at least two possibilities. First, the dystroglycan complex may function as a helper protein in these processes; the initial and high affinity binding of the ECM ligands to the dystroglycan complex may enable the more specific and functional cell surface receptors, such as the members of the integrin family or the putative myotube-associated specificity component (MASC), which was recently proposed to work in concert with the receptor tyrosine kinase MuSK in the neuromuscular junction formation, to interact with these ligands (31Sugiyama J.

Previous studies have not shown whether the tRNA nucleotides needed for effecting translational editing are the same as or distinct from those required for aminoacylation, but several considerations have suggested that they are the same. Here, designed tRNAs that are highly active for aminoacylation but are not active in translational editing are presented. The editing reaction can be controlled by manipulation of nucleotides at the corner of the L-shaped tRNA. In contrast, these manipulations do not affect aminoacylation. These results demonstrate the segregation of nucleotide determinants for the editing and aminoacylation functions of tRNA."

The essential role of iron in metabolism makes its acquisition a determinant of bacterial pathogenesis and a target for therapeutic strategies. In Gram-negative bacteria, TonB-dependent outer membrane proteins form energized, gated pores that bind iron chelates (siderophores) and internalize them. The time-resolved operation of the Escherichia coli ferric enterobactin receptor FepA was observed in vivo with electron spin resonance spectroscopy by monitoring the mobility of covalently bound nitroxide spin labels. A ligand-binding surface loop of FepA, which normally closes its transmembrane channel, exhibited energy-dependent structural changes during iron and toxin (colicin) transport. These changes were not merely associated with ligand binding, but occurred during ligand uptake through the outer membrane bilayer. The results demonstrate by a physical method that gated-porin channels open and close during membrane transport in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2020083116,"On 19 December 1996 as Galileo passed close to Jupiter’s moon, Europa, the magnetometer measured substantial departures from the slowly varying background field of Jupiter’s magnetosphere. Currents coupling Europa to Jupiter’s magnetospheric plasma could produce perturbations of the observed size. However, the trend of the field perturbations is here modeled as the signature of a Europa-centered dipole moment whose maximum surface magnitude is ∼240 nanotesla, giving a rough upper limit to the internal field. The dipole orientation is oblique to Europa’s spin axis. This orientation may not be probable for a field generated by a core dynamo, but higher order multipoles may be important as they are at Uranus and Neptune. Although the data can be modeled as contributions of an internal field of Europa, they do not confirm its existence. The dipole orientation is also oblique to the imposed field of Jupiter and thus not directly produced as a response to that field. Close to Europa, plasma currents appear to produce perturbations with scale sizes that are small compared with a Europa radius."
https://openalex.org/W2079014952,"The functional characteristics of leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S), which specifically conjugates leukotriene A4 with GSH, were assessed by mutagenic analysis. Human LTC4S and the 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein share substantial amino acid identity and predicted secondary structure. The mutation of Arg-51 of LTC4S to Thr or Ile abolishes the enzyme function, whereas the mutation of Arg-51 to His or Lys provides a fully active recombinant protein. The mutations Y59F, Y97F, Y93F, N55A, V49F, and A52S increase the Km of the recombinant microsomal enzyme for GSH. The mutation Y93F also markedly reduces enzyme function and increases the optimum for pH-dependent activity. The deletion of the third hydrophobic domain with the carboxyl terminus abolishes the enzyme activity, and function is restored by the substitution of the third hydrophobic domain and carboxyl terminus of 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein for that of LTC4S. Mutations of C56S and C82V alone or together and the deletion of Lys-2 and Asp-3 of LTC4S do not alter enzyme function. The direct linkage of two LTC4S monomers by a 12-amino acid bridge provides an active dimer, and the same bridging of inactive R51I with a wild-type monomer creates an active pseudo-dimer with function similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. These results suggest that in the catalytic function of LTC4S, Arg-51 probably opens the epoxide ring and Tyr-93 provides the thiolate anion of GSH. Furthermore, the monomer has independent conjugation activity, and dimerization of LTC4S maintains the proper protein structure."

Evidence has accumulated for the biological importance of the phosphoproteins and, in particular, the phosphate groups in bone formation, resorption, and calcification. The precise locations of the phosphate groups in the OPN molecule were determined by metabolically labeling OPN with32P in cultured chicken osteoblasts, followed by purification to homogeneity. N-terminal sequencing showed a single sequence of WPVSKRQHAISA, consistent with that deduced from both cDNA, and previous amino acid sequencing of the protein isolated from chicken bone. Three 32P-labeled peptides were isolated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography of thrombin-digested, 32P-labeled OPN.

It has been well established that the processes of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of proteins catalyzed by protein kinases and phosphatases, respectively, play a major role in the initiation, regulation, and termination of a wide range of intracellular biochemical processes with significant functional consequences. Such processes may also play an important role in a wide variety of intercellular mechanisms, including general cell-cell signal transduction of extracellular agonists via specific transmembrane receptors, often causing alterations of intracellular concentrations of cAMP, calcium, inositol polyphosphates, and/or diacylglycerol. These intracellular modulators in turn induce a cascade of biochemical processes by mechanisms that also involve phosphorylation of specific rate-determining enzymes or proteins by protein kinases (1Krebs E.G.

This view is also supported by in vitro nucleation experiments, which attempted to simulate the postulated in vivo nucleation substrate of bone tissue by cross-linking the resident phosphoproteins in situ in their native positions and comparing the efficacy (induction or lag time) of this nucleation substrate with samples containing the collagen-phosphoprotein complexes after the covalent phosphate groups were enzymatically cleaved. Not only did the decalcified bone samples containing the collagen-phosphoproteins complexes markedly decrease the nucleation induction time, but this property was lost when the phosphate groups alone were removed enzymatically, leaving the dephosphorylated collagen-phosphoprotein completely intact and, hence, pinpointing the role of the phosphate groups in this in vitro crystal nucleation event (27Endo A.

The potential roles of these two phosphoproteins in the calcification process have not been clearly defined. Data have been reported demonstrating that these two components can induce or inhibit calcification in several different in vitro models of calcification (30Hunter G.K. Goldberg H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8562-8565Google Scholar, 31Boskey A.L. Maresca M. Ullrich B. Doty S.B. Butler W.T. Prince C.W. Bone Miner. 1993; 22: 147-159Google Scholar, 32Goldberg H.A. Warner K.

The results may be due to the experimental techniques and models utilized to assess crystal nucleation and the accumulation of increasing amounts of the solid crystalline phase of calcium phosphate by secondary nucleation and possibly by growth of the crystals. However, their presence in pathologically calcified soft tissue such as breast tumors, urinary stones, and atherosclerotic plagues (13Giacheli C.M. Bae N. Almeida M. Denhardt D.T. Alpers C.E. Schwartz S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1686-1696Google Scholar, 14Ikeda T. Shiraswa T. Esaki Y. Yoshiki S. Hirokawa K. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2814-2820Google Scholar, 15Kohri K. Nomura S.

Weissberg P.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2402-23930Google Scholar) supports the general hypothesis that they are involved in the deposition of a solid phase of calcium phosphate in normal and pathologically calcified tissues.OPN is one of the most characterized of the secreted phosphoproteins. It is synthesized in a highly phosphorylated form by osteoblasts (34Gerstenfeld L.S. Lian J.B. Gotoh Y. Lee D.D. Landis W.J. McKee M.D. Nanci A. Glimcher M.J. Connect. Tissue Res. 1989; 21: 215-225Google Scholar,35Gotoh Y. Gerstenfeld L.C. Glimcher M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 49-58Google Scholar), and can be isolated from the mineralized extracellular matrix of bone tissue (12Uchiyama A. Suzuki M. Lefteriou B. Glimcher M.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 24: 6363-6369Google Scholar, 26Glimcher M.J. Rubin R.P. Weiss G. Putney Jr., J.W. Calcium in Biological Systems. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1985: 607-616Google Scholar). In contrast, except for milk, it is essentially unphosphorylated in non-mineralized tissues (37Nomura S. Wells A.J. Edwards D.R. Heath J.K. Hogan B.L. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 441-451Google Scholar, 38Mark M.P. Prince C.W. Gay S. Austin R.L. Butler W.T. Cell Tissue Res. 1988; 251: 23-30Google Scholar). Clearly, such differences in the extent of phosphorylation of the same protein when expressed in widely different tissues suggests different functional properties of both the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated protein, and further suggests the presence of tissue-specific kinase(s) that modify this protein. The protein kinase activity found in the bone, which phosphorylates the endogenous proteins of bone, was first observed three decades ago (39Krane S.M. Stone M.J. Glimcher M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 97: 77-87Google Scholar). More recently, the presence of membrane-bound casein kinase type II activity was detected in 14-day-old embryonic chicken bone, which phosphorylated endogenous bone phosphoproteins and dephosphorylated casein (40Mikuni-Takagaki Y. Glimcher M.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 68: 585-591Google Scholar). Further studies using cultured chicken osteoblasts as the source of protein kinase from bone cells led to the conclusion that the microsomal casein kinase II (CKII) type activity of chicken osteoblasts was the predominant enzyme that phosphorylated purified chicken OPN and recombinant mouse OPN (41Salih E. Ashkar S. Zhou H.-Y. Gerstenfeld L.C. Glimcher M.J. Connect. Tissue Res. 1997; 35: 207-213Google Scholar, 42Salih E. Ashkar S. Gerstenfeld L.C. Glimcher M.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1461-1473Google Scholar). In these studies assessment of this enzyme with other protein substrates, including casein and synthetic peptide substrates, indicated that, while its activity is very similar to that of casein kinase II, it also possessed unique enzymatic activities that distinguished it from that of classical casein kinase II (41Salih E. Ashkar S. Zhou H.-Y. Gerstenfeld L.C. Glimcher M.J. Connect. Tissue Res. 1997; 35: 207-213Google Scholar, 42Salih E. Ashkar S. Gerstenfeld L.C. Glimcher M.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1461-1473Google Scholar). This enzyme was found to be localized in the Golgi apparatus of chicken osteoblasts (43Ashkar S. Schaffer J.L. Salih E. Gerstenfeld L.C. Glimcher M.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; T60: 296-298Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vitro studies also identified the major protein kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of both bovine OPN and BSP to be a CKII (44Salih E. Zhou H.-Y. Glimcher M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16897-16905Google Scholar). Other investigators using ROS 17.28 osteosarcoma cells have also isolated a membrane-associated CKII, which phosphorylates the major dentin phosphoprotein, phosphorphoryn (45Wu C.B. Pelech S.L. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16588-16594Google Scholar). This enzyme was also found in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (46Sfeir C. Veis A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 607-615Google Scholar, 47Wu C.B. Pan Y.-M. Shimigu Y. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1995; 57: 287-292Google Scholar). The subcellular location of the CKII to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus is significant mechanistically, since both OPN and BSP are secretory proteins and the enzyme participating in their post-translational modification must encounter them.Extensive studies have been carried out in this laboratory to isolate, purify, and characterize the protein kinase(s) responsible for the phosphorylation of the secreted extracellular matrix phosphoproteins of bone. Quantitative amounts (mg) of 32P-secreted osteopontin from cultured chicken osteoblasts were isolated and purified to define both the location of the phosphorylated amino acids in the protein and the amino acid sequences adjacent to the phosphorylated residue. This paper reports on the isolation and purification of32P-labeled peptides of OPN and the solid-phase amino acid sequencing of seven peptides, which unequivocally identify the peptide motifs and the specific sites of the phosphorylated OPN.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsSources for materials were are follows: GF/F glass filters (5.0 mm diameter) (Whatman, Ltd.); p-aminophenyltrimethoxysilane (Petrach Co.), radioactive orthophosphate (32Pi, 3000 Ci/mmol, ICN Inc.); reverse-phase Vydac C-4 column (15 × 0.38 cm) (Nerst Group); reverse-phase HPLC Dynamax C-18 column (25 × 0.46 cm) (Rainin Co.); and trypsin (tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated), human thrombin (5000 units/mg), endoproteinase Asp-N, Kemptide (LRRASAV), and cAMP-dependent kinase, water-soluble coupling agentN-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDAC) (all obtained from Sigma).MethodsLabeling and Isolation of Secreted 32P-Labeled Osteopontin from Mineralized Cultured Chicken OsteoblastsChicken calvarial osteoblasts were isolated by sequential collagenase/trypsin treatment of 17-day-old embryonic calvaria. Cells were initially maintained in minimal essential media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum until confluence. They were then put into BGJbmedia supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 12.5 μg/ml ascorbic acid, and 10 mm β-glycerol phosphate. Cultures were grown for 3 weeks in the latter medium to promote extracellular matrix mineralization. To generate 32P-labeled OPN, mineralized cultures (15 100-mm culture dishes, 15 × 106cells/dish) were initially incubated with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1 h, followed by incubation of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's phosphate-free medium (5 ml/dish) containing 12.5 μg/ml ascorbic acid (1 mCi of 32P/dish) and incubated for 18 h. All protein extraction buffers and wash buffers were ice-cooled to ∼4 °C. The medium was removed, and the mineralized cell layers were washed (three times) with 10 ml of 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. The cells were lysed with ice-cooled phosphate buffer (2 ml/dish), pH 7.2, containing 0.5% Tween 20, 0.05% deoxycholate, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 50 mm NaVO3, 10 mm NaF, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 10 min on ice. The lysis buffer was removed, and the mineralized cell layer was washed (three times) with 10 ml of 10 mmphosphate buffer (pH 7.2)/dish. The mineralized cell layer was then extracted 0.1 m HCl (adjusted to pH ∼2.0 with citric acid) 10 ml/dish over ice for 3 h. The acid extracted proteins were lyophilized, and 32P-labeled OPN was purified by reverse-phase HPLC on a C-4 column as described below.Purification of Secreted 32P-Labeled Osteopontin by Reverse-phase HPLC on a C-4 ColumnThe lyophilized acid extract was resuspended in ∼0.5 ml of H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v), and aliquots (0.25 ml) were subjected to reverse-phase HPLC on a C-4 column (15 × 0.38 cm). After injection, the column was washed for 10 min with H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) followed by elution using a linear gradient from H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) to 60% CH3CN, 0.55% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) at 60 min at a flow rate of 0.72 ml/min. Fractions of 0.72 ml were collected, and absorbance = 230 nm was recorded by a continuous on-line chart recorder/integrator. Aliquots of 0.025 ml from each fraction were counted for 32P. The radiolabeled peaks were pooled, freeze-dried, and rechromatographed under same conditions as described above. An aliquot of the purified osteopontin was then N-terminally sequenced.Thrombin Digestion of Purified 32P-Labeled Osteopontin and Isolation of Thrombin Fragments by HPLC on a C-4 ColumnApproximately 200 μg of purified 32P-labeled OPN was incubated with bovine thrombin (1 unit/4 μg of protein) in 0.20 ml of 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8, containing 2 mm CaCl2 for 2 h at 37 °C. The reaction products were treated with 50 μl of H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) and HPLC-chromatographed on C-4 column (15 × 0.38 cm) as described above. The32P-radiolabeled fragments were identified by counting for32P, separately pooled, and freeze-dried. Aliquots of each thrombin fragment were N-terminally sequenced.Trypsin Digestion of Purified 32P-Labeled Osteopontin and Isolation of the Labeled Peptides by Reverse-phase HPLC on a C-18 ColumnThe purified 32P-labeled OPN (∼0.5 mg) from the HPLC C-4 column was digested with trypsin (2% w/w) in 0.2 ml of 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH ∼8.0, for 20 h at 37 °C. The reaction products were then treated with 50 μl of H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) and subjected to HPLC on a C-18 column (25 × 0.46 cm). After injection the column was washed for 10 min, followed by linear gradient elution from H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) to 60% CH3CN, 0.055% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) over 120 min, with a second gradient from 60% CH3CN to 80% CN3CN over 30 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The absorbance at 219 nm was recorded continuously on an on-line chart recorder-integrator using a Gilson HM Holochrome detector. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. Aliquots of 0.025 ml from each fraction were counted for 32P radioactivity, and the radioactive fractions were then separately pooled for each peak, freeze-dried, and rechromatographed. Each purified 32P-labeled peptide was then sequenced by automated solid-phase amino acid sequencing technique described below.N-terminal Sequencing Utilizing Biobrene-treated Glass FiltersN-terminal sequencing was carried out by Edman degradation (48Edman P. Begg G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 1: 80-91Google Scholar) using an automated model 477A sequenator (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) under the same conditions as described previously (49Carr C. McCount D. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7090-7102Google Scholar). Glass filters coated with Biobrene were used, and the proteins or peptides were adsorbed on these filters. This approach was used for N-terminal sequence analysis in which the prime interest was to identify the N-terminal sequence, for example, of purified secreted [32P]OPN and large thrombin fragments. For identification of the 32P-labeled peptide regions and the specific sites of phosphorylation, the sequencing conditions are described below.Automated Solid-phase N-terminal Sequencing in Identification of Sites of PhosphorylationThe sequencing method for identification of phosphorylated sites required an approach that would optimize the identification of phosphorylated residues such as Ser, Thr, or Tyr. This is because these derivatives as well as inorganic phosphate that may be released during sequencing conditions are highly hydrophilic and not extracted by the usual sequence extraction solvent (1-chlorobutane). Therefore, there is significant limitation in attaining sufficient 32P counts for identification of the site of phosphorylation. A solid-phase sequencing technique utilizing GF/F glass filters derivatized byp-aminophenyltrimethoxysilane, followed by covalent attachment of the phosphorylated peptide through its C terminus (50Wettenhall R.E.H. Aebersold R.H. Hood L.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 186-199Google Scholar), was used, which allowed the use of a sufficiently hydrophilic extraction solvent (S3) without loss of the peptide, which would be the case if the “adsorptive” Biobrene method was used.The glass GF/F Whatman filters (5.0 cm diameter) were treated with trifluoroacetic acid overnight at 37 °C. These filters were then freed of trifluoroacetic acid, air-dried in a fume hood, and treated with p-aminophenyltrimethoxysilane overnight at 37 °C. The filters were removed from the solution and extensively washed with MeOH and dried. In the present study, trimethoxysilane was used instead of “triethoxysilane” since the latter reagent was no longer commercially available. The derivatized filters were stored in dry, dark glass dishes until needed. The covalent attachment of the 32P-labeled peptides was carried out on derivatized GF/F glass filters cut in circular sizes of ∼1 cm in diameter and using water-soluble carbodiimide (EDAC) (50Wettenhall R.E.H. Aebersold R.H. Hood L.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 186-199Google Scholar).The automated N-terminal sequencing of the 32P-labeled peptides were performed directly from these filters. Further modifications of the sequencing conditions included the following. The extraction solvent S3 was CH3CN instead of 1-chlorobutane and contained 0.1% thiourea, and the acid cleavage step was performed using HCl/MeOH (1 ml of acetyl chloride + 13 ml of methanol + 0.1% thiourea). Thiourea was used in the sequencing solvents instead of DTT. This is more advantageous than DTT since phosphoserines under sequencing conditions can be derivatized by nucleophilic attacks by DTT. For identification of sites of phosphorylation, one third of the ATZ products of each cleavage step were converted to PTH-derivatives and analyzed by on-line HPLC (model 120A, Applied Biosystems) and two thirds were collected as ATZ-derivatives for 32P counting. To quantify yields of sequenced peptides, initial yield (Io) and repetitive yield (R) were calculated by linear regression analysis of the observed yield (M) at each cycle (n): log10(M) = nlog10(R) + log10(Io).Evaluation of Efficiency of the Solid-phase N-terminal Sequencing of 32P-Labeled Peptides by Using Synthetic Peptide Substrate, Kemptide, 32P-Phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent KinaseKemptide (LRRASAV), 20 μg (26 nmol) was phosphorylated using cAMP-dependent kinase (1 μg) and 150 μm [32P]ATP (4 mCi/mmol) in 0.1 ml of KH2PO4/NaHPO4 buffer, pH 7.4, I (ionic strength) = 0.2 mol liter−1 for 30 min at room temperature. The phosphorylated Kemptide was isolated by HPLC on a C-18 column using a linear gradient from H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) to 50% CH3CN, 0.055% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) in 40 min. An aliquot of the32P-labeled Kemptide (∼3 nmol; ∼26,500 dpm) in 40 μl of CH3CN/H2O (1:3) was applied onto a derivatized Whatman GF/F glass filter (∼1.0 cm in diameter) and dried. 40 μl of 160 mm MES buffer, pH 4.0, containing (5 mg/ml) EDAC was added and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The filter was washed with H2O and counted. 17,200 dpm remained on the filter, which was equivalent to ∼65% covalent coupling. N-terminal sequencing was then carried out directly from the filter with one third of the Edman degradation products converted to PTH-derivatives and analyzed on an on-line HPLC model 120A (Applied Biosystems), and two thirds were collected as ATZ-derivatives and counted for 32P.SDS-PAGE and ImmunoblottingSDS-PAGE (10%) polyacrylamide gel electrophoreses were carried out as described previously (51Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Samples of the isolated proteins from mineralized bone and [32P]ATP-labeled proteins were prepared in 10% sample buffer (20% sucrose, 10% SDS, 0.12 m Tris (pH 6.8), 0.25% bromphenol blue, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 25% glycerol) and heated at 100 °C for 5 min. Autoradiography was carried out on32P-labeled proteins, which had been resolved by SDS-PAGE after the gels had been stained and unstained. Gels were dried on a Bio-Rad dryer (model 224) for 2–3 h and exposed to X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY) at −70 °C.Western BlottingFollowing SDS-PAGE with prestained lowMr protein standards (Bio-Rad), the gels were soaked in blotting buffer (48 mm Tris, 39 mmglycine, 20% methanol, pH 9.2) with Immobilon P and 6 pieces of Whatman filter paper for 30 min. The electrophoretic transfer of proteins onto Immobilon was carried out at 14 V and 280 mA for 1 h using Bio-Rad Trans-Blot SD blotter. The membranes were blocked overnight at room temperature by 10% nonfat milk in 20 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing a 0.15 m NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20. The Immobilon P-bound proteins were subjected to specific reaction with anti-chicken OPN (19Gerstenfeld L.C. Gotoh Y. McKee M.D. Landis W.J. Nanci A. Glimcher M.J. Anat. Rec. 1990; 228: 93-103Google Scholar) and 170 ng/ml of the same buffer withou"

In this study, L-selectin was found to be phosphorylated in lymphoblastoid cell lines, and phosphorylation was enhanced by phorbol ester (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)) treatment. Interactions between L-selectin and chemoattractant receptors were therefore examined using transfected rat basophilic leukemia cell lines (RBL-2H3) that expressed human L-selectin along with human leukocyte chemoattractant receptors. L-selectin was rapidly phosphorylated in cells treated with chemoattractants, thrombin, IgE receptor agonists, or PMA. Pertussis toxin or the protein kinase C inhibitor, staurosporine, completely blocked chemoattractant receptor-induced phosphorylation of L-selectin. PMA-induced phosphorylation was on serine residues within the cytoplasmic tail of L-selectin that have been well conserved during recent evolution. Although L-selectin phosphorylation was not essential for basal levels of adhesion through L-selectin in transformed cell lines, the rapid increase in ligand binding activity of L-selectin that occurs following leukocyte activation was blocked by staurosporine.

While much is known regarding the independent functions of adhesion molecules and chemoattractant receptors, little is known about how these receptors modulate the function of each other.

Therefore, potential mechanisms by which chemoattractant receptor signaling may modulate L-selectin function were examined using the rat basophilic leukemia cell line, RBL-2H3 (RBL 1The abbreviations used are: RBL, rat basophilic leukemia; PKC, protein kinase C; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; C5a, cleavage product of complement activation; fMLP, formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine; PAF, platelet-activating factor; HEV, high endothelial venule; IL, interleukin; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; R, receptor; LΔcyto, a form of L-selectin lacking the cytoplasmic domain; LΔG-S, a form of L-selectin lacking the GKKSKRS peptide within the cytoplasmic domain; LΔM-N, a form of L-selectin lacking the membrane-proximal endoproteolytic cleavage site; L-SS/AA, a form of L-selectin with the 2 cytoplasmic serine residues replaced by alanine residues. 1The abbreviations used are: RBL, rat basophilic leukemia; PKC, protein kinase C; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; C5a, cleavage product of complement activation; fMLP, formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine; PAF, platelet-activating factor; HEV, high endothelial venule; IL, interleukin; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; R, receptor; LΔcyto, a form of L-selectin lacking the cytoplasmic domain; LΔG-S, a form of L-selectin lacking the GKKSKRS peptide within the cytoplasmic domain; LΔM-N, a form of L-selectin lacking the membrane-proximal endoproteolytic cleavage site; L-SS/AA, a form of L-selectin with the 2 cytoplasmic serine residues replaced by alanine residues. cells), as an in vivo model (11Ali H.

Phosphorylation of L-selectin is a potential site for receptor regulation since the cytoplasmic domain of L-selectin contains numerous basic residues surrounding 2 serine residues that have been highly conserved during recent mammalian evolution (2Tedder T.F. Steeber D.A. Chen A. Engel P. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 866-873Google Scholar, 14Tedder T.F. Ernst T.J. Demetri G.D. Isaacs C.M. Adler D.A. Disteche C.M. J. Exp.

RBL cells stably transfected to co-express functional human chemoattractant receptors and L-selectin provide direct evidence that activation of chemoattractant receptors induces immediate phosphorylation of L-selectin through a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent pathway. Antibodies used in these studies included: mouse LAM1–116 (IgG2a) and LAM1–110 (IgG1) mAbs that react with human, mouse, and rat L-selectin (34Steeber, D. A., Engel, P., Miller, A. S., Sheetz, M. P., and Tedder, T. F. (1997) J. Immunol., in press.Google Scholar); anti-CD83 mAb (HB15A IgG2b); and anti-human CD3 mAb (RW2–8C8). Antibodies were purified from ascites fluid by sodium sulfate precipitation and DEAE-Sepharose anion exchange column chromatography (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The 12CA5 mAb reactive with a 9-amino acid epitope tag was from Boehringer Mannheim. Immunofluorescence staining of cells and cell lines was as described previously (16Tedder T.F. Penta A.C. Levine H.B. Freedman A.S. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 532-540Google Scholar) using mAbs optimally diluted for immunostaining: FITC-conjugated LAM1–116 mAb or unconjugated LAM1–116 mAb detected with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Caltag, South San Francisco, CA). Single color immunofluorescence analysis of 10,000 cells was performed on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) with fluorescence intensity analyzed on a 4-decade log scale. The lectin activity of L-selectin was assessed by incubating transfected RBL cells with biotinylated polyphosphomonoester core polysaccharide (5 mg/ml) from yeast and FITC-conjugated streptavidin using methods similar to those previously described (10Spertini O. Kansas G.S. Munro J.M. Griffin J.D. Tedder T.F. Nature. 1991; 349: 691-694Google Scholar). RBL cells or RBL cells expressing epitope-tagged chemoattractant receptors were cultured as described (11Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Google Scholar). RBL or 300.19 cells were co-transfected with L-selectin or LΔM-N cDNA by electroporation, and clones were isolated as described (13Richardson R.M. DuBose R.A. Ali H. Tomhave E.D. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14193-14201Google Scholar, 15Chen A. Engel P. Tedder T.F. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 519-530Google Scholar). 300.19 cells transfected with human cDNA for either L-selectin or LΔcyto cDNA were as described (16Tedder T.F. Penta A.C. Levine H.B. Freedman A.S. J.

Human blood lymphocytes were isolated from heparin-anticoagulated venous blood from healthy adult volunteers by centrifugation over Ficoll density gradient medium (Nycomed, Oslo, Norway). The cytoplasmic domain of human L-selectin is composed of 12 amino acid residues (G323KKSKRSMNDPY334) (14Tedder T.F. Ernst T.J. Demetri G.D. Isaacs C.M. Adler D.A. Disteche C.M. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 123-133Google Scholar). The L-selectin cDNA that encodes a protein with the 2 cytoplasmic serine residues replaced by alanine residues (L-SS/AA) and the cDNA that deletes the GKKSKRS sequence (LΔG-S) of the cytoplasmic domain were generated by a two-step polymerase chain reaction and were verified by sequence analysis. The LΔcyto and LΔM-N cDNAs were as described (15Chen A. Engel P. Tedder T.F. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 519-530Google Scholar, 17Kansas G.S. Ley K. Munro J.M. Tedder T.F. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 833-838Google Scholar). Epitope-tagged chemoattractant receptors were as described (11Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Google Scholar, 12Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. DuBose R.A. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24557-24563Google Scholar, 13Richardson R.M. DuBose R.A. Ali H. Tomhave E.D. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14193-14201Google Scholar). Cells (5–10 × 106) were surface labeled with 125I, lysed, immunoprecipitated using the indicated mAbs, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography as described (11Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Google Scholar, 12Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. DuBose R.A. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol.

Metabolic labeling of cells with [32P]orthophosphate was as described (11Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Google Scholar, 12Ali H.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14193-14201Google Scholar). Labeled cells were incubated with or without agonists (thrombin receptor peptide, SFLLRN, 100 μm, Peninsula Laboratories, Belmont, CA; thrombin, 1 unit/ml; fMLP, 1 μm; PAF, 100 nm; PMA, 0.5 μm, all from Calbiochem; IL-8, 100 nm, Genzyme, Cambridge, MA; C5a, 100 nm, Sigma) for 3 min at 37 °C. Cells were also activated with IgE (0.2 μg/ml) plus antigen (dinitrophenyl-conjugated bovine serum albumin, 0.1 μg/ml) as described (11Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Google Scholar). In some cases the cells were also pretreated for 5 min with 100 nm staurosporine (Calbiochem) or overnight with 100 ng/ml of pertussis toxin (List Biological Laboratories) before stimulation with agonists. For lymphoblastoid cell lines, cells were incubated in the presence of protease inhibitors as described (18Allport, J. R., Ding, H. T., Ager, A., Steeber, D. A., Tedder, T. F., and Luscinskas, F. W. (1997) J. Immunol., in press.Google Scholar, 19Preece G. Murphy G. Ager A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11634-11640Google Scholar). The cells were lysed after 3 min. Phosphorylated L-selectin or chemoattractant receptors were immunoprecipitated with the LAM1–116 (15 μg) or 12CA5 (10 μg) mAbs, respectively, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. Binding of transfected 300.19 cells expressing native or modified forms of L-selectin to high endothelial venules (HEVs) was assessed as described (16Tedder T.F. Penta A.C. Levine H.B. Freedman A.S. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 532-540Google Scholar, 20Butcher E.C. Scollay R.G. Weissman I.L. J. Immunol. 1979; 123: 1996-2003Google Scholar). Human blood lymphocytes were stimulated through the CD3 receptor as described (10Spertini O. Kansas G.S. Munro J.M. Griffin J.D. Tedder T.F. Nature. 1991; 349: 691-694Google Scholar) in the presence of 100 nm staurosporine or Me2SO carrier. Previous attempts to demonstrate phosphorylation of L-selectin by us and others have been unsuccessful probably because of the rapid endoproteolytic release of L-selectin from the cell surface following cellular activation (21Kishimoto T.K. Julita M.A. Berg E.L. Butcher E.C. Science. 1989; 245: 1238-1241Google Scholar, 22Griffin J.D. Spertini O. Ernst T.J. Belvin M.P. Levine H.B. Kanakura Y. Tedder T.F. J.

Leukemia ( Baltimore ). 1991; 5: 300-308Google Scholar). Therefore, metabolically labeled human lymphoblastoid cell lines that express L-selectin were cultured for 3 min with either medium or PMA, a known activator of PKC, in the presence of a protease inhibitor that blocks the endoproteolytic release of L-selectin (18Allport, J. R., Ding, H. T., Ager, A., Steeber, D. A., Tedder, T. F., and Luscinskas, F. W. (1997) J. Immunol., in press.Google Scholar, 19Preece G. Murphy G. Ager A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11634-11640Google Scholar). These inhibitors do not affect leukocyte activation or adhesive interactions between leukocytes and endothelial cells (18Allport, J. R., Ding, H. T., Ager, A., Steeber, D. A., Tedder, T. F., and Luscinskas, F. W. (1997) J. Immunol., in press.Google Scholar, 19Preece G. Murphy G. Ager A. J. Biol.

Following lysis of the cells and immunoprecipitation with an L-selectin-specific mAb, an appropriately sized phosphoprotein band was isolated (Fig.1). In each case, PMA treatment of the cell lines resulted in increased phosphorylation of this protein. Therefore, RBL cells transfected with L-selectin cDNA were used as a model system to verify that L-selectin was the phosphorylated protein immunoprecipitated from lymphoblastoid cell lines. RBL cells transfected with human L-selectin cDNA (LAM1 cells) expressed high levels of either unmodified L-selectin (14Tedder T.F. Ernst T.J. Demetri G.D. Isaacs C.M. Adler D.A. Disteche C.M. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 123-133Google Scholar) or a modified form of L-selectin (LΔM-N) (15Chen A. Engel P. Tedder T.F. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 519-530Google Scholar) that is fully functional but not endoproteolytically released from the cell surface (Fig.2 A). RBL cells did not express endogenous L-selectin as determined using two mAbs reactive with rat L-selectin (LAM1–116 and LAM1–110, Fig. 2 A). Human L-selectin expressed in RBL cells was functionally and structurally intact since it retained the ability to specifically bind polyphosphomonoester core polysaccharide, which mimics the natural ligand of L-selectin (Fig. 2 B) (26Yednock T.A. Butcher E.C. Stoolman L.M. Rosen S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 725-731Google Scholar) and was bound by seven mAbs directed against distinct epitopes of its extracellular domains (data not shown). In addition, only LAM1 cells displayed an ∼80-kDa surface protein that was immunoprecipitated with mAbs specific for L-selectin (Fig.2 C). L-selectin immunoprecipitated from unactivated RBL cells was only weakly phosphorylated or not phosphorylated at detectable levels. However, phosphorylation of L-selectin was markedly increased following PMA treatment of LAM1 cells for 3 min (Fig.3 A, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, PMA treatment of untransfected RBL cells did not induce phosphorylation of proteins in this size range (Fig. 3 A,lane 4).Figure 3Chemoattractant receptor-initiated phosphorylation of L-selectin. RBL cells co-expressing L-selectin along with different epitope-tagged chemoattractant receptors (all recognized by the 12CA5 mAb) were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and stimulated as indicated. Cells were lysed, immunoprecipitated with either the 12CA5 (lanes 8, 12, and 14) or LAM1–116 mAbs (all other lanes), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The positions of L-selectin (lanes 2, 6, 7, 10, 11, and13), IL-8R (lane 12), fMLPR (lane 8), and PAFR (lanes 12 and 14) are indicated. Similar results were obtained in three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) RBL cells that expressed the LΔM-N form of L-selectin, as well as native thrombin and IgE receptors, were also transfected with cDNA encoding epitope-tagged human receptors for formyl peptides (fMLPR), a peptide component of complement activation (C5aR), interleukin-8 (IL-8R), or platelet-activating factor (PAFR). RBL clones expressing these chemoattractant receptors respond to chemoattractants by activating similar signal transduction pathways as do leukocytes including actin polymerization, phosphoinositide hydrolysis, calcium mobilization, phospholipase D activation, and degranulation (11Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Google Scholar, 12Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. DuBose R.A. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24557-24563Google Scholar, 13Richardson R.M. DuBose R.A. Ali H. Tomhave E.D. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14193-14201Google Scholar). L-selectin expressed together with human chemoattractant receptors (Fig. 3, B and C) was phosphorylated following PMA treatment (Fig. 3, lanes 2, 6,and 10). Activation for 3 min of chemoattractant receptors for fMLP, IL-8, and PAF with their respective ligands also resulted in phosphorylation of L-selectin in co-transfected cells (lanes 7, 11, and 13). fMLP induced strong phosphorylation of L-selectin, while PAF activation resulted in weaker phosphorylation (lanes 7 and 13). IL-8, fMLP, and PAF stimulation also resulted in the homologous phosphorylation of their receptors (lanes 8, 12, and 14) as well as cross-phosphorylation of the PAFR by IL-8R activation as described previously (11Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Google Scholar, 12Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. DuBose R.A. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24557-24563Google Scholar, 13Richardson R.M. DuBose R.A. Ali H. Tomhave E.D. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14193-14201Google Scholar, 27Richardson R.M. Haribabu B. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28717-28724Google Scholar). Activation of RBL cells through endogenous thrombin, IgE receptors, or ectopic C5a receptors also resulted in phosphorylation of L-selectin (Fig. 4 A). Activation of RBL cells through these receptors also results in phosphorylation of the C5a receptor (11Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Google Scholar), which was simultaneously immunoprecipitated with L-selectin to provide an internal control for receptor signaling (Fig. 4 A). In addition, dose-response studies showed that concentrations (1–3 nm) of C5a analogous to those found at sites of inflammation induced L-selectin phosphorylation (data not shown). Therefore, L-selectin was rapidly phosphorylated following chemoattractant receptor activation. L-selectin was phosphorylated specifically on serine residues following PMA treatment. Phosphorylated L-selectin was immunoprecipitated from RBL cells transfected with a cDNA encoding the LΔM-N form of L-selectin, while phosphorylated L-selectin was not immunoprecipitated from cells expressing the LΔM-N form of L-selectin with the 2 serine residues in the cytoplasmic tail replaced with alanine residues (LΔMN-SS/AA) (Fig. 5). Since PKC is activated by all of the agonists used above, its role in L-selectin phosphorylation was examined using staurosporine, a PKC inhibitor (28Watson S.P. McNally J. Shipman L.J. Godfrey P.P. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 345-350Google Scholar). Both PMA- and C5a-induced phosphorylation of L-selectin was completely inhibited by treating LAM1 cells with staurosporine (Fig.4 B, lanes 3 and 5). Pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of signaling through Gi proteins (29Gilman A.G. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1989; 262: 1819-1825Google Scholar), also blocked C5a-induced phosphorylation of L-selectin, indicating that the production of second messengers through G-protein activation is required for chemoattractant receptor-induced phosphorylation of L-selectin (Fig. 4 B, lane 6). L-selectin phosphorylation was detected at the earliest measurable time point of 7 s following fMLPR-induced activation of RBL cells (Fig.4 C). These results demonstrate that L-selectin was immediately phosphorylated on serine residues following cellular activation by a wide range of pro-inflammatory mediators that activate PKC. Native L-selectin was endoproteolytically released from the cell surface within minutes following activation of RBL cells with PMA, while the LΔM-N form of L-selectin was retained (data not shown). To determine whether phosphorylation of L-selectin regulates its endoproteolytic release from the cell surface, RBL and 300.19 cells, a mouse pre-B cell line, were transfected with L-selectin cDNAs that encoded native receptors with the 2 serine residues in the cytoplasmic tail replaced with alanine residues (L-SS/AA), the 7-amino acid region containing the serine residues (LΔG-S) deleted, or the entire cytoplasmic tail (LΔcyto) deleted (see “Experimental Procedures”). In all cases, the spontaneous or PMA-induced endoproteolytic release of L-selectin was not measurably affected by these modifications (data not shown). Therefore, endoproteolytic release of L-selectin was not regulated by the cytoplasmic domain. The cytoplasmic domain of L-selectin is required for receptor-mediated adhesion in vivo and in vitro (17Kansas G.S. Ley K. Munro J.M. Tedder T.F. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 833-838Google Scholar). Furthermore, the binding activity of L-selectin for ligand increases rapidly following lymphocyte activation through the T cell receptor (CD3) complex or neutrophil activation with cytokines (10Spertini O. Kansas G.S. Munro J.M. Griffin J.D. Tedder T.F. Nature. 1991; 349: 691-694Google Scholar). Since cross-linking CD3 activates PKC (30Manger B. Weiss A. Imboden J. Laing T. Stobo J.D. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 2755-2760Google Scholar) a role for PKC-mediated phosphorylation in L-selectin-dependent binding is possible. Unfortunately, it is not feasible to transfect normal leukocytes with L-selectin cDNAs lacking the cytoplasmic serine residues to test this directly. Likewise, it has not been possible to demonstrate up-regulated L-selectin binding activity in RBL cells or lymphoblastoid cell lines. 2B. Haribabu, D. A. Steeber, H. Ali, R. M. Richardson, R. Snyderman, and T. F. Tedder, unpublished observations. Therefore, the effects of blocking receptor phosphorylation on up-regulated L-selectin binding activity were examined indirectly by treating cells with a PKC inhibitor. Treatment of lymphocytes with staurosporine completely inhibited the CD3-mediated increase in L-selectin-dependent binding to HEVs and reduced, but did not eliminate, basal L-selectin binding (Fig. 6). Since leukocyte binding to HEVs, both basal and up-regulated, is completely inhibited by blocking L-selectin function (10Spertini O. Kansas G.S. Munro J.M. Griffin J.D. Tedder T.F. Nature. 1991; 349: 691-694Google Scholar) and chemoattractant receptor-induced adhesion through integrins is not PKC-dependent (31Laudanna C. Campbell J.J. Butcher E.C. Science. 1996; 271: 981-983Google Scholar), the current results suggest that rapid PKC-mediated phosphorylation of L-selectin may up-regulate its binding activity in vivo. The effects of receptor phosphorylation on basal L-selectin binding activity were examined directly using cDNA-transfected 300.19 cells. The L-SS/AA-modified L-selectin did not significantly affect 300.19 cell binding to HEVs of peripheral lymph nodes (L-selectin, 7.8 ± 0.8 cells/HEV; L-SS/AA, 6.3 ± 1.2 cells/HEV; p < 0.1) in four experiments. By contrast, the LΔG-S mutation (0.6 ± 0.3 cells/HEV) was similar to that of LΔcyto (1.2 ± 1.0 cells/HEV; p < 0.0001 versus L-selectin) and showed very weak if any binding to HEVs. Therefore, although phosphorylation was not necessary for basal adhesion through L-selectin, the region containing the serine residues within the cytoplasmic domain was required. The finding that L-selectin was rapidly phosphorylated in lymphoblastoid cell lines (Fig. 1) and transfected RBL cells (Figs. 3and 4) immediately following chemoattractant or PMA stimulation suggests a physiologically relevant role for L-selectin phosphorylation in the inflammatory response. Indeed, signaling of RBL cells through endogenous thrombin and IgE receptors or ectopic receptors for fMLP, C5a, IL-8, and PAF all induced L-selectin phosphorylation (Figs. 3 and4). That all of these receptors activate PKC-dependent pathways, that L-selectin phosphorylation was completely blocked by a PKC inhibitor (Fig. 4 B), and that L-selectin was phosphorylated on serine residues (Fig. 5) suggest that L-selectin may be phosphorylated directly by PKC. Although phosphorylation of L-selectin in human neutrophils freshly isolated from blood could not be demonstrated, this is likely to result from the fact that L-selectin from neutrophils is heavily glycosylated and runs as a diffuse and broad band when analyzed by SDS-PAGE (22Griffin J.D. Spertini O. Ernst T.J. Belvin M.P. Levine H.B. Kanakura Y. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 576-584Google Scholar, 32Tedder T.F. Matsuyama T. Rothstein D.M. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 1351-1355Google Scholar). Also, metabolic labeling of these terminally differentiated cells is inefficient, and endoproteolytic release of L-selectin from neutrophils is not completely inhibited in the presence of protease inhibitors (18Allport, J. R., Ding, H. T., Ager, A., Steeber, D. A., Tedder, T. F., and Luscinskas, F. W. (1997) J. Immunol., in press.Google Scholar). These factors in combination are likely to explain the previous inability to demonstrate L-selectin phosphorylation in native leukocytes by us and others (21Kishimoto T.K. Julita M.A. Berg E.L. Butcher E.C. Science. 1989; 245: 1238-1241Google Scholar, 22Griffin J.D. Spertini O. Ernst T.J. Belvin M.P. Levine H.B. Kanakura Y. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 576-584Google Scholar, 23Jung T.M. Dailey M.O. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 3130-3136Google Scholar, 24Spertini O. Freedman A.S. Belvin M.P. Penta A.C. Griffin J.D. Tedder T.F. Leukemia ( Baltimore ). 1991; 5: 300-308Google Scholar). Nonetheless, a requirement for L-selectin phosphorylation may explain why the amino acid sequence of the cytoplasmic domain of L-selectin has been highly conserved during recent mammalian evolution (particularly the serine residues) (2Tedder T.F. Steeber D.A. Chen A. Engel P. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 866-873Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of L-selectin occurs within seconds following cell exposure to fMLP (Fig. 4 C), which is consistent with anin vivo role for L-selectin in leukocyte-endothelium interactions. The ligand binding activity of L-selectin is also rapidly up-regulated within seconds following lymphocyte activation or leukocyte stimulation with pro-inflammatory agents that activate PKC (10Spertini O. Kansas G.S. Munro J.M. Griffin J.D. Tedder T.F. Nature. 1991; 349: 691-694Google Scholar). The finding that activation-induced up-regulation of L-selectin adhesive function is staurosporine-sensitive (Fig. 5) suggests that these two events are likely to be related. L-selectin phosphorylation was not required for basal adhesion through this receptor since staurosporine does not eliminate basal adhesion of lymphocytes to HEVs (Fig. 6), and replacement of the serine residues in L-selectin did not inhibit its ability to bind to HEVs. However, deletion of the cytoplasmic region containing the serine residues or the entire cytoplasmic domain eliminated all adhesion. This suggests that this region of L-selectin may mediate intermolecular associations critical for L-selectin function. The functional outcome of these intermolecular interactions could be regulated by phosphorylation of L-selectin in native leukocytes but not in transfected cells. Alternatively, PKC-dependent phosphorylation of other proteins could indirectly affect L-selectin-dependent adhesion and lead to its enhanced adhesive function following leukocyte activation. Phosphorylation and up-regulated binding activity of L-selectin are both induced more rapidly than endoproteolytic release of L-selectin from the cell surface (10Spertini O. Kansas G.S. Munro J.M. Griffin J.D. Tedder T.F. Nature. 1991; 349: 691-694Google Scholar). Consistent with this, phosphorylation of L-selectin on serine residues is not required for endoproteolytic release of L-selectin since the elimination of serine residues within the cytoplasmic domain of L-selectin did not affect receptor cleavage. Whether serine phosphorylation of L-selectin is required for signal transduction through L-selectin following its ligation remains an open issue. Recent studies have demonstrated rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of L-selectin following cross-linking by antibodies (33Brenner B. Gulbins E. Schlottmann K. Koppenhoefer U. Busch G.L. Walzog B. Steinhausen M. Coggeshall K.M. Linderkamp O. Lang F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15376-15381Google Scholar). However, ligation of L-selectin through conserved ligand-binding regions within the lectin domain induces rapid and potent intercellular adhesion in human, mouse, and rat leukocytes that is also induced in cell lines expressing L-selectin lacking the cytoplasmic serine residues (L-SS/AA) or the cytoplasmic tyrosine residue (34Steeber, D. A., Engel, P., Miller, A. S., Sheetz, M. P., and Tedder, T. F. (1997) J. Immunol., in press.Google Scholar). Although it is not currently feasible to express mutant L-selectin molecules in primary leukocytes to assess the biological significance of L-selectin phosphorylationin vivo, the current studies provide a rationale for further studies examining this issue. The finding that L-selectin phosphorylation was inhibited by both a PKC inhibitor and pertussis toxin suggests that L-selectin phosphorylation may be one of the rapid G-protein-regulated activation events involved in leukocyte interactions with vascular endothelium under physiologic flow conditions (35Bargatze R.F. Butcher E.C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 367-372Google Scholar, 36Bjerknes M. Cheng H. Ottaway C.A. Science. 1986; 231: 402-405Google Scholar). In current models of leukocyte recruitment to inflammatory sites, initial interactions between selectins and their ligands result in rolling followed by chemoattractant-mediated integrin activation leading to firm adhesion (3Butcher E.C. Res. Immunol. 1993; 144: 695-698Google Scholar, 4Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 827-872Google Scholar, 35Bargatze R.F. Butcher E.C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 367-372Google Scholar). Our results suggest that activation of chemoattractant receptors induces L-selectin phosphorylation through PKC-dependent pathways. Phosphorylation of L-selectin may induce transient changes in L-selectin binding activity that may contribute directly to leukocyte interactions with endothelial cells and account in part for lineage-specific differences in leukocyte migration (10Spertini O. Kansas G.S. Munro J.M. Griffin J.D. Tedder T.F. Nature. 1991; 349: 691-694Google Scholar). We thank Drs. S. Rosen, H. Metzger, and S. F.

These effector substances decrease the uptake of A system amino acids. We examined the effect of amino acid deprivation on the steady state levels of α1(I) collagen in human lung fibroblasts. Maintenance of fibroblasts in amino acid-free medium decreased α1(I) collagen mRNA levels by 29% at 24 h and 78% at 72 h. Frequent refeeding of cultures with amino acid-free medium resulted in more rapid decreases in intracellular amino acids and in α1(I) collagen mRNA levels.

The biosynthesis of type I collagen is complex and involves both intracellular and extracellular sites of regulation. The accumulation of type I collagen by lung fibroblasts is increased by transforming growth factor-β and insulin and is decreased by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), 1The abbreviation used is: PGE2, prostaglandin E2. 1The abbreviation used is: PGE2, prostaglandin E2.retinoic acid, and interferon-γ (1Fine A.

We and others previously reported that both PGE2 and retinoic acid induce large decreases in the expression of α1(I) collagen mRNA by these cells (2Redlich C.A. Delisser H.M. Elias J.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 12: 287-295Google Scholar, 3Varga J. Diaz-Perez A. Rosenbloom J. Jimenez S.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 147: 1282-1288Google Scholar, 4Krupsky M. Fine A. Berk J. Goldstein R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 335-341Google Scholar). These effects require protein synthesis and are mediated by decreases in the rate of transcription of the α1(I) collagen gene as well as by decreases in the stability of the α1(I) collagen mRNA.PGE2 and retinoic acid decrease the uptake of neutral amino acids transported by A system amino acids in lung fibroblasts (7Krupsky M. Fine A. Berk J.L. Goldstein R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23283-23288Google Scholar, 8Goldstein R.H. Sakowski S. Meeker D. Franzblau C. Polgar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8734-8737Google Scholar). The activity of the A system is Na+-dependent and is responsive to hormones, extracellular amino acids, and other effector substances (9Christensen H.N. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 43-77Google Scholar, 10Guidotti G.G. Borghetti A.F. Gazzola G.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 515: 329-366Google Scholar). The decreases in amino acid transport were rapid and occurred within 1 h of exposure to the effector substance. In contrast, the decreases in the steady state levels of α1(I) collagen mRNA occurred between 8 and 12 h following exposure. This kinetic relation whereby decreases in amino acid uptake preceded decreases in collagen mRNA levels suggests that depletion of amino acid levels are associated with decreases in α1(I) mRNA levels. Certain other mRNAs are regulated by amino acid availability. For example, asparagine synthetase mRNA is up-regulated by amino acid starvation, whereas β-actin and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate are decreased in abundance (11Hutson R.G. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 745-750Google Scholar, 12Kilberg M.S. Hutson R.G. Laine R.O. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 13-19Google Scholar, 13Shay N.F. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17844-17848Google Scholar).In these studies, we examined the relation between amino acid depletion and α1(I) collagen mRNA levels in human lung fibroblasts. We find that amino acid depletion caused marked decreases in α1(I) collagen mRNA levels that rapidly reaccumulate following the addition of amino acids. This decrease in α1(I) collagen mRNA was mediated by decreasing the rate of transcription of the α1(I) collagen gene and by decreasing the stability of the mRNA.RESULTSQuiescent confluent lung fibroblasts were maintained in medium without amino acids to deplete intracellular amino acids. After varying periods of time, we determined the steady state levels of α1(I) collagen mRNA. Gel loading was assessed by ethidium bromide staining and by probing the filter with an oligonucleotide that recognizes the 18 S ribosomal subunit. The levels of α1(I) collagen mRNA were slightly decreased (29 ± 7%, mean ± S.E.,n = 3) in fibroblasts maintained in amino acid-deficient medium for 24 h. Maintenance in amino acid-free medium for 72 h resulted in a large decrease in α1(I) collagen mRNA levels (Fig. 1). The results of five such experiments revealed that amino acid deprivation for 72 h decreased α1(I) collagen mRNA levels by 78% ± 5 (mean ± S.E.).The addition of the usual complement of 15 amino acids present in complete medium restored α1(I) collagen mRNA levels, indicating that the absence of added amino acids was not toxic to the cells (Fig.1). The availability of amino acids markedly affected α1(I) collagen mRNA levels, but only minimally affected the steady state levels of Gs mRNA (which encodes a GTP-binding protein) and cyclooxygenase-1 mRNA (Fig. 2). The amino acid-mediated induction of α1(I) collagen mRNA levels required protein synthesis. Cycloheximide alone at 5 μm inhibits protein synthesis by greater than 90% (23Goldstein R.H. Wall M. Taylor L. Cahill M. Polgar P. Prostaglandins. 1984; 28: 717-729Google Scholar) and does not affect α1(I) collagen mRNA levels in these cells ((24Fine A. Matsui R. Zhan X. Poliks C.F. Smith B.D. Goldstein R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 67-72Google Scholar) and data not shown). However, the presence of cycloheximide blocked the amino acid-induced increase in α1(I) collagen mRNA levels (Fig.3).Figure 2The effects of alterations in amino acid availability on expression of α1(I) collagen, Gs, and cyclooxygenase-1 mRNAs. In two separate experiments, quiescent fibroblast cultures were maintained in amino acid-deficient medium for 48 h. The medium was removed and replaced with medium without amino acids (AAF) or medium containing the full complement of 15 amino acids (AAR). After 24 h, the RNA was extracted. A, the filter was probed with a cDNA for Gs. The filter was stripped and reprobed for α1(I) collagen mRNA and finally reprobed with an oligonucleotide that identifies the 18 S ribosomal subunit. B, the filter was probed with a cDNA for α1(I) collagen. The filter was stripped and reprobed for cyclooxygenase-1 (Cox 1) mRNA and finally reprobed with an oligonucleotide that identifies the 18 S ribosomal subunit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3The effect of cycloheximide on amino acid-induced increases in α1(I) collagen mRNA levels.Quiescent fibroblast cultures were cultured in amino acid-deficient medium for 48 h.

After 24 h, the RNA was isolated, and the expression of α1(I) mRNA was assessed.

Quiescent fibroblasts were maintained in medium with or without amino acids for 48 h. Northern analysis was performed on amino acid-deficient cells that were refed with serum-free medium containing amino acids. The steady state level of α1(I) collagen mRNA was increased at 8 h (approximately 4-fold as assessed by densitometry of the two major α1(I) collagen mRNA signals) and further increased at 24 h following refeeding with medium containing amino acids (Fig.4).Figure 4The time course for activation of α1(I) mRNA expression after readdition of amino acids. Quiescent fibroblast cultures were maintained in amino acid-deficient medium without serum for 48 h. For control dishes (time 0), the medium was removed, and RNA was extracted. In other dishes, the medium was replaced by medium containing amino acids, and RNA was extracted at the indicated time interval.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine whether frequent refeeding with amino acid-free medium increased the depletion of intracellular amino acids by increasing efflux and preventing reuptake, we determined the amount of free amino acids in the medium and in the intracellular compartment. The fibroblasts were placed in amino acid-deficient medium, and the amount of A system amino acids in the medium was determined after 6 h. We found that glycine, alanine, and lesser amounts of proline accumulated in the medium by efflux (Fig. 5). Small amounts of leucine transported by the L system were also detected in the medium.Figure 5The accumulation of amino acids in the medium after addition of amino acid-free medium. The medium was removed, cells were rinsed three times with Puck's saline, and medium without amino acids was added. After 6 h, the medium was removed, and the levels of glycine, alanine, proline, and leucine in the medium were determined by amino acid analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The intracellular concentration of the A system amino acids glycine, proline, and alanine and the L system amino acid leucine was determined in cells incubated in medium with or without amino acids. The intracellular levels of the amino acids were variably decreased. Glycine decreased by 17%, proline by 64%, alanine by 71%, and leucine by 88% after 12 h (Fig. 6). When the medium was changed at 4 and 8 h to remove amino acids accumulating in the extracellular space from efflux (and therefore potentially available for reuptake), the intracellular levels of glycine, proline, and alanine decreased further, whereas leucine levels were unchanged.Figure 6The intracellular levels of amino acids after addition of amino acid-free medium. The medium was removed, and cells were rinsed three times with Puck's saline and replaced with complete medium (CM) or medium without amino acids (AAF). In additional dishes, the medium without amino acids was replaced after 4 and 8 h (AAFR). After 12 h, the medium was removed, and the intracellular levels of glycine, alanine, proline, and leucine were determined by amino acid analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We examined the effect of rapidly altering the levels of amino acids by frequent refeeding with amino acid-deficient medium on α1(I) collagen mRNA levels. Rapid depletion of intracellular amino acids was accomplished by refeeding the cells every 5 h (four changes) during the 24-h period with amino acid-deficient medium. We assessed the steady state levels for α1(I) collagen and Gs. After 24 h, we found that α1(I) mRNA levels fell by 71% in cells frequently refed with amino acid-free medium (Fig. 7). In contrast, the level of α1(I) mRNA decreased only 39% in cells cultured in amino acid-deficient medium but not frequently refed.Figure 7The effect of refeeding with amino acid-free medium on α1(I) collagen mRNA levels. The medium was removed from cultures of quiescent confluent fibroblasts. The cells were rinsed three times with Puck's saline, and medium without amino acids was added to the dishes (AAF). In additional dishes, the amino acid-free medium was replaced every 5 h (AAFR). After 24 h, the medium was removed, and α1(I) collagen mRNA levels were determined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To examine the mechanism whereby amino acid depletion decreased collagen mRNA levels, we determined the half-life for α1(I) collagen mRNA and the rate of transcription of the α1(I) gene. We found that amino acid depletion decreased the stability of the α1(I) mRNA (Fig. 8). The half-life of the mRNA was assessed by measuring the decay of the mRNA after the addition of actinomycin D. Linear regression analysis using the results of three such experiments employing a variety of time points (2.5, 5, 7, and 9 h) revealed that amino acid depletion decreased the half-life of the α1(I) mRNA from 9.7 to 4.3 h. Because this decrease in half-life cannot account entirely for the decreases in α1(I) mRNA following amino acid deprivation, we assessed the rate of transcription by a nuclear run-on assay. Nuclei were isolated from fibroblasts maintained in medium with or without amino acids for 48 h. The rate of transcription of the α1(I) gene was reduced by 73% (mean of two experiments) in nuclei obtained from fibroblasts maintained without amino acids. In contrast, the rate of transcription for Gswas unchanged. The addition of amino acids restored the transcription rate for α1(I) collagen (Fig. 9).Figure 8The stability of α1(I) collagen mRNA in fibroblasts maintained in amino acid-deficient medium. Fibroblast cultures were untreated (Control) or cultured in amino acid-deficient medium (AAF) for 48 h. Following the addition of 5 μm actinomycin D, the cells were harvested at various time intervals, and the level of α1(I) collagen mRNA was determined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 9The rate of transcription of the α1(I) collagen gene. Quiescent cultures were maintained in medium with (lane 1) or without amino acids (lane 2). After 48 h, in selected dishes maintained in amino acid-free medium, the medium was replaced with medium containing amino acids (lane 3). After 16 h, the nuclei were harvested, and the level of transcription was assessed. No signal was detected for plasmids without insert.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We examined the effect of PGE2 on levels of intracellular amino acids and on α1(I) collagen levels in cells deprived of amino acids. The addition of PGE2 at 10−7m to cultures maintained in amino acid-free medium for 8 h further decreased the intracellular levels of glycine by 35% to 75.4 ± 3.5 nmol/106 cells and proline by 20% to 29.5 ± 1.1 nmol/106 cells as compared with cells maintained in amino acid-free medium. PGE2 at 10−7m also induced a small additional decrease in α1(I) mRNA levels in cells maintained in amino acid-deficient medium (Fig. 10). When fibroblasts were reexposed to amino acids, PGE2 inhibited the restoration of α1(I) mRNA levels by 76 ± 7% (mean ± S.E.,n = 3).Figure 10The effect of PGE2 on α1(I) collagen mRNA levels in fibroblasts maintained in amino acid-deficient medium. Confluent quiescent fibroblasts were maintained in amino acid-free medium for 48 h. The medium was removed and replaced with medium without amino acids (AAF) or medium containing the full complement of 15 amino acids (AAR). As indicated, selected cultures also received PGE2 at 10−7m (lanes 3and 4) or PGE2 at 10−8m (lane 5). After 24 h, the RNA was isolated, and the expression of α1(I) collagen mRNA was assessed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONWe found that the steady state level of collagen α1(I) mRNA was decreased by treatment of fibroblasts with amino acid-deficient medium. In contrast, changes in amino acid availability minimally affected the levels of the constitutively expressed cyclooxygenase-1 and Gs mRNAs. The decrease in α1(I) mRNA levels was dependent on the time of exposure to amino acid-deficient medium and the rate of decrease in intracellular amino acids. Short exposures to amino acid-deficient medium resulted in a 29% decrease in mRNA levels, and prolonged exposure resulted in a 78% decrease. When the intracellular levels of amino acids were rapidly lowered by frequent refeeding with amino acid-deficient medium, the α1(I) mRNA levels decreased more markedly. Frequent refeeding decreased intracellular amino acids by removing amino acids appearing in the medium by efflux and preventing reuptake. The decrease in α1(I) collagen mRNA levels was not the result of toxicity because restoring amino acids to the medium resulted in a rapid restoration of mRNA levels.Alteration of intracellular amino acid levels affects the steady state levels of several other mRNAs (9Christensen H.N. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 43-77Google Scholar, 10Guidotti G.G. Borghetti A.F. Gazzola G.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 515: 329-366Google Scholar, 11Hutson R.G. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 745-750Google Scholar, 25Yufit T. Vining V. Wang L. Brown R.R. Varga J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 388-393Google Scholar). The steady state mRNA level for asparagine synthetase is up-regulated by amino acid derivation in baby hamster kidney cells (11Hutson R.G. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 745-750Google Scholar, 12Kilberg M.S. Hutson R.G. Laine R.O. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 13-19Google Scholar). A novel cis-acting element (5′-CATGATG-3′) located in the proximal asparagine promoter mediates this effect and binds nuclear proteins (26Guerrini L. Gong S.S. Mangasarian K. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3202-3212Google Scholar). However, analysis of the promoter region of the α1(I) collagen gene did not reveal a similar binding site. Other examples of amino acid-regulated mRNAs include Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, and histone H2. These mRNAs are decreased by amino acid starvation in rat Fao hepatoma cells (13Shay N.F. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17844-17848Google Scholar). In addition, insulin-like growth factor I mRNA levels in hepatocytes is decreased by amino acid deprivation and increased by excess (27Thissen J.P. Pucilowska J.B. Underwood L.E. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1570-1576Google Scholar).Certain effector substances regulate gene expression by altering intracellular amino acid levels. Interferon-γ decreases expression of collagenase and stromelysin by decreasing the intracellular concentration of tryptophan (25Yufit T. Vining V. Wang L. Brown R.R. Varga J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 388-393Google Scholar, 28Varga J. Yufit T. Brown R.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 475-481Google Scholar). Interferon-γ also decreases production of α1(I) collagen mRNA (29Czaja M.J. Weiner F.R. Eghbali M. Giamborne M-A. Eghbali M. Zern M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13348-13351Google Scholar). However, we found that the addition of tryptophan to amino acid-deficient medium did not restore α1(I) mRNA levels 2M. Krupsky, P-P. Kuang, and R. H. Goldstein, unpublished results. (unpublished results) suggesting that one or more other amino acids are necessary to induce this affect.Depletion of amino acids decreased the rate of transcription of the α1(I) collagen gene and the stability of the mRNA. This process was relatively selective because the rate of transcription of Gs was unchanged by decreased amino acid availability. The molecular mechanism whereby amino acid depletion causes alterations in gene expression and mRNA stability is unknown. The sensing mechanism may involve changes in the level of aminoacylation of tRNA. For example, the rate of protein breakdown in histidine starvation of the Chinese hamster ovary cell is regulated by the levels of aminoacylation of tRNA (30Scornik O.A. Fed. Proc. 1984; 43: 1283-1288Google Scholar). Studies employing temperature-dependent mutant cell lines suggest that regulation of asparagine synthetase activity may involve tRNA acylation (31Moore P.A. Jayme D.W. Oxender D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7427-7430Google Scholar, 32Andrulis I.L. Hatfield G.W. Arfin S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10629-10633Google Scholar). This regulatory mechanism may also affect mRNA levels of selected genes, possibly by altering the production of a transcriptional activator under circumstances of amino acid deprivation. Our results employing cycloheximide also suggest that synthesis of one or more specific proteins (perhaps a transcription factor) is initially required for activation of α1(I) collagen mRNA levels by amino acid exposure. We find that cycloheximide inhibited the induction of α1(I) collagen mRNA following the addition of amino acids to amino acid-deficient cells.Our previous results showed that PGE2 and retinoic acid decreased the transport of A system amino acids by increasing theKm of the A system transporter (7Krupsky M. Fine A. Berk J.L. Goldstein R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23283-23288Google Scholar, 8Goldstein R.H. Sakowski S. Meeker D. Franzblau C. Polgar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8734-8737Google Scholar). Both of these effectors decrease the rate of transcription of the α1(I) collagen gene. Our results employing amino acid-deficient medium suggest that the PGE2-induced decreases in α1(I) collagen mRNA levels may be mediated through decreases in intracellular amino acids. PGE2 further decreased α1(I) collagen levels when fibroblasts were cultured in amino acid-deficient medium, perhaps by inhibited reuptake of amino acids accumulating in the medium by efflux. In addition, PGE2 blocked the restoration of α1(I) mRNA levels following reexposure to amino acids. We previously found that PGE2 was more effective in inhibiting α1(I) collagen accumulation induced by transforming growth factor-β than that induced by insulin (33Fine A. Poliks C.F. Donahue L.P. Smith B.D. Goldstein R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16988-16991Google Scholar). Because insulin is a strong inducer of amino acid transport, it may inhibit the effect of PGE2 by directly stimulating uptake.Alterations in amino acid availability may affect α1(I) collagen mRNA expression by fibroblasts residing within a biomatrix andin vivo. The steady state levels of α1(I) collagen mRNA decreases in fibroblasts that are placed within collagen gels, perhaps as a result of matrix-fibroblast interactions that decrease the availability of nutrients by alterations in transporter function (34Grinnell F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 401-404Google Scholar, 35Eches B. Mauch C. Hüppe G. Krieg T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 129-133Google Scholar, 36Riikonen T. Westermarck J. Koivisto L. Broberg A. Kähäri V-M. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13548-13552Google Scholar). It is noteworthy in this regard that suspension of 3T3 fibroblasts in methylcellulose decreases the rate of transcription of the α1(I) collagen gene and decreases the stability of the α1(I) collagen mRNA (37Dhawan J. Lichtler A.C. Rowe D.W. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8470-8475Google Scholar). In the lung, fibroblasts that reside in the pulmonary interstitium do not express detectable levels of α1(I) mRNA as assessed by in situ hybridization (38Lucey E.C. Ngo H.Q. Agarwal A. Smith B.D. Snider G.L. Goldstein R.H. Lab Invest. 1996; 74: 12-20Google Scholar). Following lung injury, α1(I) collagen levels rapidly increase, presumably from exposure to fibrogenic cytokines such as transforming growth factor-β. However, alteration in vascular permeability and proteolytic disruption of the extracellular matrix may provide greater access for amino acids into the interstitium, resulting in fibroblast activation. The biosynthesis of type I collagen is complex and involves both intracellular and extracellular sites of regulation. The accumulation of type I collagen by lung fibroblasts is increased by transforming growth factor-β and insulin and is decreased by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), 1The abbreviation used is: PGE2, prostaglandin E2. 1The abbreviation used is: PGE2, prostaglandin E2.retinoic acid, and interferon-γ (1Fine A.

We and others previously reported that both PGE2 and retinoic acid induce large decreases in the expression of α1(I) collagen mRNA by these cells (2Redlich C.A. Delisser H.M. Elias J.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 12: 287-295Google Scholar, 3Varga J. Diaz-Perez A. Rosenbloom J. Jimenez S.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 147: 1282-1288Google Scholar, 4Krupsky M. Fine A. Berk J. Goldstein R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 335-341Google Scholar). These effects require protein synthesis and are mediated by decreases in the rate of transcription of the α1(I) collagen gene as well as by decreases in the stability of the α1(I) collagen mRNA. PGE2 and retinoic acid decrease the uptake of neutral amino acids transported by A system amino acids in lung fibroblasts (7Krupsky M. Fine A. Berk J.L. Goldstein R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23283-23288Google Scholar, 8Goldstein R.H. Sakowski S. Meeker D. Franzblau C. Polgar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8734-8737Google Scholar). The activity of the A system is Na+-dependent and is responsive to hormones, extracellular amino acids, and other effector substances (9Christensen H.N. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 43-77Google Scholar, 10Guidotti G.G. Borghetti A.F. Gazzola G.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 515: 329-366Google Scholar). The decreases in amino acid transport were rapid and occurred within 1 h of exposure to the effector substance. In contrast, the decreases in the steady state levels of α1(I) collagen mRNA occurred between 8 and 12 h following exposure. This kinetic relation whereby decreases in amino acid uptake preceded decreases in collagen mRNA levels suggests that depletion of amino acid levels are associated with decreases in α1(I) mRNA levels. Certain other mRNAs are regulated by amino acid availability. For example, asparagine synthetase mRNA is up-regulated by amino acid starvation, whereas β-actin and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate are decreased in abundance (11Hutson R.G. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 745-750Google Scholar, 12Kilberg M.S. Hutson R.G. Laine R.O. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 13-19Google Scholar, 13Shay N.F. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17844-17848Google Scholar). In these studies, we examined the relation between amino acid depletion and α1(I) collagen mRNA levels in human lung fibroblasts. We find that amino acid depletion caused marked decreases in α1(I) collagen mRNA levels that rapidly reaccumulate following the addition of amino acids. This decrease in α1(I) collagen mRNA was mediated by decreasing the rate of transcription of the α1(I) collagen gene and by decreasing the stability of the mRNA. RESULTSQuiescent confluent lung fibroblasts were maintained in medium without amino acids to deplete intracellular amino acids.

Overexpression of HNF-4 leads to a 7.4-fold increase in apolipoprotein CIII expression, while infection with the dominant negative mutant of HNF-4 reduces the level of apolipoprotein CIII mRNA by 80%, demonstrating that endogenous HNF-4 is necessary for apolipoprotein CIII expression. Experiments using the hepatoma cell lines, HepG2 and Hep3B, indicate that HNF-4 is also involved in the regulation of apolipoprotein AI expression in these lines. However, the effect of HNF-4 on apolipoprotein AI expression is much more dramatic in cell lines derived from intestinal epithelium. Infection of the intestinal-derived cell line IEC-6 with the HNF-4 adenovirus resulted in a greater than 20-fold increase in the level of apolipoprotein AI mRNA. These results indicate that HNF-4 does regulate apolipoprotein AI and CIII mRNA expression and suggest that HNF-4 is critical for intestinal apolipoprotein AI expression.

The apolipoproteins are lipid-binding polypeptides involved in the transport and metabolism of cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Google Scholar). These proteins regulate the structural characteristics of lipoprotein particles as well as their metabolism and uptake by cell surface receptors. While it has been demonstrated that genetic defects in apolipoprotein structure or biosynthesis can lead to severe disorders of plasma lipid transport and the development of atherosclerotic disease, recent clinical studies indicate that even relatively small imbalances in lipoprotein concentrations can increase the risk of atherosclerosis (2Carlson L.A.

Apolipoprotein gene transcription is a regulated process, and there have been significant advances in our understanding of the DNA elements that control apolipoprotein expression.

Zhong W. Lai E. Darnell J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2353-2365Google Scholar). HNF-4 mRNA is present in the intestine, kidney, and pancreas as well as the liver (5Sladek F.M. Zhong W. Lai E. Darnell J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2353-2365Google Scholar, 6Miquerol L. Lopez S. Cartier N. Tulliez M. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8944-8951Google Scholar). At present no ligand for HNF-4 has been identified, therefore HNF-4 is referred to as an orphan member of the intracellular receptor superfamily (7Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev.

Whether an activity-modulating ligand for HNF-4 exists is not known, but HNF-4 is capable of activating transcription in the absence of exogenously added ligand (10Kou C.J. Conley P.B. Chen L. Slaydek F.M. Darnell J.E. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 457-461Google Scholar, 11Mietus-Snyder S. Sladek F.M. Ginsburg G.S. Kou C.F. Ladias J.A.A. Darnell J.E. Karathanasis S.K. Mol. Cell.

The structure of HNF-4 is very highly conserved; there is 96% sequence identity at the amino acid level between the human and rat HNF-4s (13Chartier F.L. Bossu J.-P. Laudet V. Fruchart J.-C. Laine B. Gene ( Amst .). 1994; 147: 269-272Google Scholar).Previous studies have identified several sequences capable of binding HNF-4 that are located within the promoters of apolipoproteins, including apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) and apolipoprotein CIII (apoCIII) (5Sladek F.M. Zhong W. Lai E. Darnell J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2353-2365Google Scholar, 11Mietus-Snyder S. Sladek F.M. Ginsburg G.S. Kou C.F. Ladias J.A.A. Darnell J.E. Karathanasis S.K. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5665-5671Google Scholar). To examine the role of HNF-4 on apoAI and apoCIII expression we have utilized recombinant adenoviral vectors expressing wild-type and a dominant negative mutant of HNF-4. HNF-4 binds DNA as a homodimer and does not appear to form heterodimers with several other intracellular receptor family members, including retinoid X receptor α, β, γ, retinoid acid receptor α, or thyroid hormone receptor α (16Jiang G. Nepomuceno L. Hopkins K. Sladek F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5131-5143Google Scholar). We have taken advantage of this and created a mutant of HNF-4 which lacks DNA binding activity and inhibits transcriptional activation by wild-type HNF-4 via the formation of heterodimers consisting of wild-type HNF-4 and the non-DNA-binding HNF-4 mutant that exhibit decreased DNA binding avidity. Since the apoAI and apoCIII genes are closely linked and appear to share regulatory elements (17Bisaha J.G. Simon T.C. Gordon J.I. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19979-19988Google Scholar), we have constructed recombinant adenoviral vectors for the dominant negative mutants and wild-type HNF-4 that has allowed us to examine the effects of modulating HNF-4 transcriptional activity on the endogenous expression levels of the apoAI and apoCIII genes.DISCUSSIONHNF-4 is an orphan member of the steroid/thyroid superfamily that is expressed in the liver and small intestine, where the majority of apolipoproteins are synthesized. HNF-4 is capable of binding to sequences present in the apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein B, apolipoprotein CIII, and apolipoprotein AIV promoters and has been proposed to regulate the expression of these apolipoprotein genes (11Mietus-Snyder S. Sladek F.M. Ginsburg G.S. Kou C.F. Ladias J.A.A. Darnell J.E. Karathanasis S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1708-1718Google Scholar,12Metzger S. Halaas J.L. Breslow J.L. Sladek F.M. J. Biol.

However, the evidence for HNF-4-regulated apolipoprotein expression has been primarily based on the existence of sequences within the apolipoprotein promoters to which HNF-4 binds in gel shift experiments and transient transfections utilizing overexpressed HNF-4 and recombinant promoter-reporter constructs. To complement experiments utilizing overexpression of HNF-4, we have constructed a mutant of HNF-4α1 that lacks the DNA-binding domain. Since HNF-4 binds to DNA as a homodimer and the Δ111HNF-4α1 mutant contains the sequences necessary for dimerization, Δ111HNF-4α1 should form dimers with full-length HNF-4 that have reduced DNA binding avidity similar to that previously described for mutants of c-erb-α, thyroid hormone receptor, and the estrogen receptor (25Forman B.M. Yang C. Au M. Casanova J. Ghysdael J. Samuels H.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1610-1626Google Scholar, 26Bigler J. Hokanson W. Eisenman R.N. Mol. Cell.

O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.J. Gene Expression. 1991; 1: 207-216Google Scholar). HNF-4 fails to form heterodimers with several of the other intracellular receptors (16Jiang G. Nepomuceno L. Hopkins K. Sladek F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5131-5143Google Scholar), suggesting that the dominant negative HNF-4 mutant should act as a specific inhibitor of HNF-4-induced transcription. The Δ111HNF-4α1 mutant demonstrates no detectable DNA binding activity and efficiently blocks both HNF-4α1 and α2-induced transcription, indicating that the two splice forms can dimerize with each other despite the sequence changes within the carboxyl-terminal domain. While we could not detect any affect of Δ111HNF-4α1 cotransfection on promoter activity induced by other intracellular receptors, it is also possible that the carboxyl-terminal domain of HNF-4 sequesters out coactivators that are necessary for HNF-4-induced activity.In agreement with previous studies (11Mietus-Snyder S. Sladek F.M. Ginsburg G.S. Kou C.F. Ladias J.A.A. Darnell J.E. Karathanasis S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1708-1718Google Scholar, 12Metzger S. Halaas J.L. Breslow J.L. Sladek F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16831-16838Google Scholar, 30Ginsburg G.S. Ozer J. Karathanasis S.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 528-538Google Scholar), cotransfection of HepG2 cells with HNF-4α1 or α2 had fairly modest affects on apoAI promoter expression. However, expression of the dominant negative in HepG2 cells does lead to a 40–50% decrease in apoAI promoter-activated expression, suggesting that endogenous HNF-4 contributes to apoAI expression in this cell model. Utilizing the recombinant adenoviral vectors, we have extended these findings to examine endogenous apoAI gene expression. The effect of increasing HNF-4 expression on endogenous apoAI mRNA levels in HepG2 cells is simlar to the results of the recombinant promoter assays in that increasing HNF-4 levels did not change apoAI expression, whereas expression of the dominant negative mutant decreases expression of apoAI mRNA. Overexpression of HNF-4 leads to a 3-fold increase in apoAI mRNA levels in the Hep3B cell line, while expression of the dominant negative results in a 54% reduction in apoAI mRNA. This result is consistent with the notion that comparatively high levels of HNF-4 expression in HepG2 cells blunt the effect of additional HNF-4, since the Hep3B cell line appears to have lower levels of HNF-4 expression than HepG2 (data not shown).HNF-4 overexpression appears to have a much more pronounced effect on apoAI expression in cell lines derived from intestinal epithelium. Transient transfection of HNF-4 up-regulated the promoter activity of apoAI-luciferase constructs by 3–5-fold in the enterocyte-like cell line Caco2 as has recently been described by Bisaha et al. (17Bisaha J.G. Simon T.C. Gordon J.I. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19979-19988Google Scholar). Infection of the IEC-6 cell line with the adenoviral vector encoding wild-type HNF-4 dramatically increased apoAI mRNA expression by greater than 20-fold. Both of these cell lines appear to have less HNF-4 than do the hepatic derived HepG2 or Hep3B, therefore magnifying the affect of adding exogenous HNF-4. But even so, the large induction using the adenovirus on the endogenous apoAI gene suggests a more critical role for HNF-4 on intestinal expression of apoAI. It is tempting to speculate that these differences are related to the previously described intestinal control region contained within the closely linked apoCIII gene, as this region does contain HNF-4 response elements that could contribute to apoAI gene expression by intestinal cells (17Bisaha J.G. Simon T.C. Gordon J.I. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19979-19988Google Scholar, 30Ginsburg G.S. Ozer J. Karathanasis S.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 528-538Google Scholar, 31Walsh A. Azrolan N. Wang K. Marcigliano A. O'Connell A. Breslow J.L. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 617-623Google Scholar).Unlike the apoAI promoter assays in the HepG2 cells, cotransfection of either the α1 or α2 splice forms of HNF-4 leads to increased reporter expression from an apoCIII reporter construct. The strong induction of apoCIII expression by HNF-4 is also observed at the level of apoCIII mRNA following infection with the adenovirus encoding wild-type HNF-4. More importantly, infection with the dominant negative mutant of HNF-4 results in an 80% decrease in apoCIII mRNA levels. This indicates that endogenous HNF-4 is required for apoCIII promoter activity and suggests that modulation of HNF-4 transcriptional activity would lead to significant changes in the level of apoCIII expression. High levels of apoCIII correlate with increased fasting triglycerides in both clinical hypertriglyceridemic patients and murine model systems (32Schonfeld G. George P.K. Miller J. Reilly P. Witztum J. Metabolism. 1979; 28: 1001-1010Google Scholar, 33Ito Y. Azrolan N. O'Connell A. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Science. 1990; 249: 790-793Google Scholar, 34Maeda N. Li H. Lee D. Oliver P. Quarfordt S.H. Osada J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23610-23616Google Scholar). Recent clinical studies suggest that high serum triglycerides are directly atherogenic as well as being inversely correlated with high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, a well documented risk factor for atherosclerotic disease (35Castelli W.P. Am. J. Cardiol. 1992; 70: 3H-9HGoogle Scholar, 36Lindenstrom E. Boysen G. Nyboe J. Br. Med. J. 1994; 309: 11-15Google Scholar). Therefore modulation of apoCIII expression via HNF-4 might represent a potential therapeutic target. A primary question is whether HNF-4 activity is regulated or not. HNF-4 is capable of activating transcription in the absence of exogenously added ligand. Therefore, if HNF-4 requires a ligand for transcriptional activation, it must be present under normal tissue culture conditions as has been found to be the case for nuclear receptors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor and farnesoid X-activated receptor (37Hsu M.-H. Palmer C.N.A. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 559-567Google Scholar, 38Forman B.M. Goode E. Chen J. Oro A.E. Bradley D.J. Perlman T. Noonan D.J. Burka L.T. McMorris T. Lamph W.W. Evans R.M. Weinberger C. Cell. 1995; 81: 687-693Google Scholar). The question of whether or not an unidentified ligand actually regulates HNF-4-induced transcription awaits future studies as does elucidation of HNF-4s role in lipid metabolism and cardiovascular disease. The apolipoproteins are lipid-binding polypeptides involved in the transport and metabolism of cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Google Scholar). These proteins regulate the structural characteristics of lipoprotein particles as well as their metabolism and uptake by cell surface receptors.

Since the apoAI and apoCIII genes are closely linked and appear to share regulatory elements (17Bisaha J.G. Simon T.C. Gordon J.I. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19979-19988Google Scholar), we have constructed recombinant adenoviral vectors for the dominant negative mutants and wild-type HNF-4 that has allowed us to examine the effects of modulating HNF-4 transcriptional activity on the endogenous expression levels of the apoAI and apoCIII genes. DISCUSSIONHNF-4 is an orphan member of the steroid/thyroid superfamily that is expressed in the liver and small intestine, where the majority of apolipoproteins are synthesized. HNF-4 is capable of binding to sequences present in the apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein B, apolipoprotein CIII, and apolipoprotein AIV promoters and has been proposed to regulate the expression of these apolipoprotein genes (11Mietus-Snyder S. Sladek F.M. Ginsburg G.S. Kou C.F. Ladias J.A.A. Darnell J.E. Karathanasis S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1708-1718Google Scholar,12Metzger S. Halaas J.L. Breslow J.L. Sladek F.M. J. Biol.

However, the evidence for HNF-4-regulated apolipoprotein expression has been primarily based on the existence of sequences within the apolipoprotein promoters to which HNF-4 binds in gel shift experiments and transient transfections utilizing overexpressed HNF-4 and recombinant promoter-reporter constructs. To complement experiments utilizing overexpression of HNF-4, we have constructed a mutant of HNF-4α1 that lacks the DNA-binding domain. Since HNF-4 binds to DNA as a homodimer and the Δ111HNF-4α1 mutant contains the sequences necessary for dimerization, Δ111HNF-4α1 should form dimers with full-length HNF-4 that have reduced DNA binding avidity similar to that previously described for mutants of c-erb-α, thyroid hormone receptor, and the estrogen receptor (25Forman B.M. Yang C. Au M. Casanova J. Ghysdael J. Samuels H.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1610-1626Google Scholar, 26Bigler J. Hokanson W. Eisenman R.N. Mol. Cell.

O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.J. Gene Expression. 1991; 1: 207-216Google Scholar). HNF-4 fails to form heterodimers with several of the other intracellular receptors (16Jiang G. Nepomuceno L. Hopkins K. Sladek F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5131-5143Google Scholar), suggesting that the dominant negative HNF-4 mutant should act as a specific inhibitor of HNF-4-induced transcription. The Δ111HNF-4α1 mutant demonstrates no detectable DNA binding activity and efficiently blocks both HNF-4α1 and α2-induced transcription, indicating that the two splice forms can dimerize with each other despite the sequence changes within the carboxyl-terminal domain. While we could not detect any affect of Δ111HNF-4α1 cotransfection on promoter activity induced by other intracellular receptors, it is also possible that the carboxyl-terminal domain of HNF-4 sequesters out coactivators that are necessary for HNF-4-induced activity.In agreement with previous studies (11Mietus-Snyder S. Sladek F.M. Ginsburg G.S. Kou C.F. Ladias J.A.A. Darnell J.E. Karathanasis S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1708-1718Google Scholar, 12Metzger S. Halaas J.L. Breslow J.L. Sladek F.M. J. Biol.

Invest. 1995; 96: 528-538Google Scholar), cotransfection of HepG2 cells with HNF-4α1 or α2 had fairly modest affects on apoAI promoter expression. However, expression of the dominant negative in HepG2 cells does lead to a 40–50% decrease in apoAI promoter-activated expression, suggesting that endogenous HNF-4 contributes to apoAI expression in this cell model. Utilizing the recombinant adenoviral vectors, we have extended these findings to examine endogenous apoAI gene expression. The effect of increasing HNF-4 expression on endogenous apoAI mRNA levels in HepG2 cells is simlar to the results of the recombinant promoter assays in that increasing HNF-4 levels did not change apoAI expression, whereas expression of the dominant negative mutant decreases expression of apoAI mRNA. Overexpression of HNF-4 leads to a 3-fold increase in apoAI mRNA levels in the Hep3B cell line, while expression of the dominant negative results in a 54% reduction in apoAI mRNA. This result is consistent with the notion that comparatively high levels of HNF-4 expression in HepG2 cells blunt the effect of additional HNF-4, since the Hep3B cell line appears to have lower levels of HNF-4 expression than HepG2 (data not shown).HNF-4 overexpression appears to have a much more pronounced effect on apoAI expression in cell lines derived from intestinal epithelium. Transient transfection of HNF-4 up-regulated the promoter activity of apoAI-luciferase constructs by 3–5-fold in the enterocyte-like cell line Caco2 as has recently been described by Bisaha et al. (17Bisaha J.G. Simon T.C. Gordon J.I. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19979-19988Google Scholar). Infection of the IEC-6 cell line with the adenoviral vector encoding wild-type HNF-4 dramatically increased apoAI mRNA expression by greater than 20-fold. Both of these cell lines appear to have less HNF-4 than do the hepatic derived HepG2 or Hep3B, therefore magnifying the affect of adding exogenous HNF-4. But even so, the large induction using the adenovirus on the endogenous apoAI gene suggests a more critical role for HNF-4 on intestinal expression of apoAI. It is tempting to speculate that these differences are related to the previously described intestinal control region contained within the closely linked apoCIII gene, as this region does contain HNF-4 response elements that could contribute to apoAI gene expression by intestinal cells (17Bisaha J.G. Simon T.C. Gordon J.I. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19979-19988Google Scholar, 30Ginsburg G.S. Ozer J. Karathanasis S.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 528-538Google Scholar, 31Walsh A. Azrolan N. Wang K. Marcigliano A. O'Connell A. Breslow J.L. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 617-623Google Scholar).Unlike the apoAI promoter assays in the HepG2 cells, cotransfection of either the α1 or α2 splice forms of HNF-4 leads to increased reporter expression from an apoCIII reporter construct. The strong induction of apoCIII expression by HNF-4 is also observed at the level of apoCIII mRNA following infection with the adenovirus encoding wild-type HNF-4. More importantly, infection with the dominant negative mutant of HNF-4 results in an 80% decrease in apoCIII mRNA levels. This indicates that endogenous HNF-4 is required for apoCIII promoter activity and suggests that modulation of HNF-4 transcriptional activity would lead to significant changes in the level of apoCIII expression. High levels of apoCIII correlate with increased fasting triglycerides in both clinical hypertriglyceridemic patients and murine model systems (32Schonfeld G. George P.K. Miller J. Reilly P. Witztum J. Metabolism. 1979; 28: 1001-1010Google Scholar, 33Ito Y. Azrolan N. O'Connell A. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Science. 1990; 249: 790-793Google Scholar, 34Maeda N. Li H. Lee D. Oliver P. Quarfordt S.H. Osada J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23610-23616Google Scholar). Recent clinical studies suggest that high serum triglycerides are directly atherogenic as well as being inversely correlated with high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, a well documented risk factor for atherosclerotic disease (35Castelli W.P. Am. J. Cardiol. 1992; 70: 3H-9HGoogle Scholar, 36Lindenstrom E. Boysen G. Nyboe J. Br. Med. J. 1994; 309: 11-15Google Scholar). Therefore modulation of apoCIII expression via HNF-4 might represent a potential therapeutic target. A primary question is whether HNF-4 activity is regulated or not. HNF-4 is capable of activating transcription in the absence of exogenously added ligand. Therefore, if HNF-4 requires a ligand for transcriptional activation, it must be present under normal tissue culture conditions as has been found to be the case for nuclear receptors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor and farnesoid X-activated receptor (37Hsu M.-H. Palmer C.N.A. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 559-567Google Scholar, 38Forman B.M. Goode E. Chen J. Oro A.E. Bradley D.J. Perlman T. Noonan D.J. Burka L.T. McMorris T. Lamph W.W. Evans R.M. Weinberger C. Cell. 1995; 81: 687-693Google Scholar). The question of whether or not an unidentified ligand actually regulates HNF-4-induced transcription awaits future studies as does elucidation of HNF-4s role in lipid metabolism and cardiovascular disease.

Reverse gyrase from Methanopyrus kandleri is unique as the first heterodimeric type I 5′-topoisomerase described, consisting of a 138-kDa subunit involved in the hydrolysis of ATP (RgyB) and a 43-kDa subunit that forms the covalent complex with DNA during the topoisomerase reaction (RgyA). Here we report the reconstitution of active reverse gyrase from the two recombinant proteins overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Both proteins have been purified by column chromatography to >90% homogeneity. RgyB has a DNA-dependent ATPase activity at high temperature (80 °C) and is independent of the presence of RgyA. RgyA alone has no detectable activity. The addition of RgyA to RgyB reconstitutes positive supercoiling activity, but the RgyB and RgyA subunits form a stable heterodimer only after being heated together.

This is the first case in which it has been possible to reconstitute an active heterodimeric enzyme of a hyperthermophilic prokaryote from recombinant proteins. In the 1980s organisms were discovered that thrive at temperatures >100 °C. These hyperthermophiles have provided a host of enzymes for scientific study and potential industrial application (1Adams M.W.W. Perler F.B. Kelly R.M. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 662-668Google Scholar). However, many archaea fail to grow in the laboratory (2Huber R. Burggraf S. Mayer T. Barns S.M. Rossnagel P. Stetter K.O. Nature. 1995; 376: 57-58Google Scholar), and the majority that can be grown do so inefficiently (3Robb F.T. Place A.R. Archaea: A Laboratory Manual, Thermophiles. 3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995Google Scholar). To fully realize the potential benefits of these enzymes and to make them easily accessible for study in the laboratory, it is advantageous to use recombinant DNA technology to express hyperthermophilic proteins in heterologous hosts and then recover active enzymes (1Adams M.W.W. Perler F.B. Kelly R.M. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 662-668Google Scholar, 4Adams M.W.W. Kelly R.M. Chem. Eng. News. 1995; : 32-42Google Scholar). Although many active thermostable enzymes have been recovered after expression in Escherichia coli, until now it had not been possible to reconstitute an active heteromultimeric hyperthermophilic enzyme from recombinant proteins (1Adams M.W.W. Perler F.B. Kelly R.M. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 662-668Google Scholar). Reverse DNA gyrases, a novel class of type I 5′-topoisomerases, were discovered in hyperthermophiles (5Forterre P. Mirambeau G. Jaxel C. Nadal M. Duguet M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2123-2128Google Scholar, 6Nakasu S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2705-2710Google Scholar, 7Slesarev A.I. Eur. J.

A. 1993; 90: 4753-4757Google Scholar, 11Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Google Scholar). These enzymes, which positively supercoil DNA in the presence of ATP or dATP, have been found in all major branches of hyperthermophilic archaea as well as in hyperthermophilic eubacteria (12Bouthier de la Tour C. Portemer C. Nadal M. Stetter K.O. Forterre P. Duguet M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6803-6808Google Scholar, 13Bouthier de la Tour C. Portemer C. Huber R. Forterre P. Duguet M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3921-3923Google Scholar). Reverse gyrase is thus considered a molecular marker for hyperthermophilic prokaryotes (14Forterre P. Cell. 1996; 85: 789-792Google Scholar). Although the physiological role of the activity remains obscure, it has been postulated that positive supercoiling helps to stabilize the DNA duplex against denaturation at the extreme temperatures where these organisms grow. In the eubacteria and the crenarchaeota branch of the archaea, reverse gyrases isolated to date are large monomeric proteins (12Bouthier de la Tour C. Portemer C. Nadal M. Stetter K.O. Forterre P. Duguet M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6803-6808Google Scholar, 13Bouthier de la Tour C. Portemer C. Huber R. Forterre P. Duguet M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3921-3923Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of reverse gyrase fromSulfolobus acidocaldarius revealed that the type I 5′-topoisomerase domain was fused to a domain reminiscent of a nucleic acid helicase (10Confalonieri F. Elie C. Nadal M. Bouthier de la Tour C.B. Forterre P. Duguet M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4753-4757Google Scholar). Helicases are nucleic acid-dependent ATPases as is reverse gyrase (15Shibata T. Nakasu S. Kumiko Y. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10419-10421Google Scholar). However, it is important to note that this domain of reverse gyrase may not function as a helicase during the enzymatic reaction and the conserved amino acid motifs in this enzyme may serve another function. Recently, we described a reverse gyrase from Methanopyrus kandleri, the first type I 5′-topoisomerase isolated from the euryarchaeota branch of the archaea (16Rivera M.C. Lake J.C. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1996; 46: 348-351Google Scholar, 17Kozyavkin S.A. Krah R. Gellert M. Stetter K.O. Lake J.A. Slesarev A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11081-11089Google Scholar, 18Krah E.R. Kozyavkin S.A. Slesarev A.I. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 106-110Google Scholar). Unlike any other type I topoisomerase, this enzyme is a heterodimer with subunits of 43 kDa (RgyA) and 138 kDa (RgyB). It was demonstrated that RgyA forms the covalent link with DNA during the strand cleavage-religation reactions, whereas RgyB is involved in the hydrolysis of ATP (17Kozyavkin S.A. Krah R. Gellert M. Stetter K.O. Lake J.A. Slesarev A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11081-11089Google Scholar). We expected the two protomers of M. kandleri reverse gyrase to consist of the conserved domains found in S. acidocaldarius reverse gyrase but as separate proteins. However, the cloning and sequence analysis of the genes encoding the two subunits of M. kandleri reverse gyrase revealed the unexpected result that the universally conserved type I 5′-topoisomerase domain was not continuous but instead was shared between the two subunits. To study the activities of the enzyme and its subunits in greater detail, it is useful to generate larger amounts of protein than can conveniently be made in M. kandleri. Here, we report growth conditions for the recovery of soluble recombinant RgyA and RgyB fromE. coli and the reconstitution of active, stable reverse gyrase from the purified proteins. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, Vent DNA polymerase, calf alkaline phosphatase, and deoxyribonucleotides were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. and used as described by the manufacturer. pET-3 and pET-16b protein expression vectors were from Novagen. Polyethyleneimine (Sigma) was used as described (19Burgess R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 3-10Google Scholar). Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was from Gold Biotechnology Inc. HiTrap chelating and heparin columns and a Sephadex S200HR 10/30 sizing column were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. High resolution hydroxylapatite (HTH) 1The abbreviations used are: HTH, hydroxylapatite; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DTT, dithiothreitol. was from Calbiochem. Phosphocellulose P-11 was from Whatman. Both L-broth and SuperbrothMDRV were purchased from Advanced Biotechnologies Inc. Column chromatography was performed using a Pharmacia fast protein liquid chromatography apparatus. All chromatography steps were performed at 4 °C except for the elution of the HTH column of RgyA, which was done at room temperature. Analytical gel filtration was performed using a Pharmacia Smart system with a Superdex 200 3.2/30 column that was standardized using the Pharmacia high and low molecular weight gel filtration kits. For electrophoretic analysis, protein samples were diluted as indicated in the figure legends, mixed 1:1 with Tris/glycine SDS sample buffer (Novex), and separated on 4–24% gradient SDS-PAGE gels (Novex). Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (0.25% in 45% methanol, 10% glacial acetic acid) followed by destaining with 10% glacial acetic acid. Protein purity was determined by scanning gels of protein samples with a Microtek Scanmaker II and creating a computer file with Adobe Photoshop and then analyzing band intensity with the NIH Image computer program. RgyB was first preheated in its storage buffer for 5 min at 80 °C. Then 0.1 μg of the protein was combined with 0.1 μg of supercoiled pBR322 in a 20-μl volume of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10% w/v glycerol) containing 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (600 mCi/mmol, DuPont NEN). Samples were incubated at the temperatures and times indicated in the figure legends, and the reactions were terminated by rapid cooling and dilution into 100 mm EDTA, pH 8. A 1-μl aliquot of each sample was spotted on a 20 × 20-cm polyethyleneimine cellulose plastic plate (Alltech Associates Inc.), dried, and developed by ascending chromatography for 2 h with 0.75m KH2PO4. Radioactivity was quantitated with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). To reconstitute positive supercoiling activity, we mixed amounts of RgyA and RgyB as indicated in their storage buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) and heated for 5 min at 80 °C. For tests of positive supercoiling activity, 1 μl of enzyme (0.1 μg of either the A subunit, the B subunit, or the reconstituted reverse gyrase) was mixed with 0.1 μg of pBR322 DNA (either relaxed or negatively supercoiled, as specified) in 20 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2) and incubated at 80 °C for 15 min. The reactions were terminated by rapidly cooling to 0 °C and adding 0.2 volume of 5% SDS, 50 mm EDTA, 50% glycerol, 0.5% bromphenol blue. The topoisomerization products were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 1.2% agarose gel in the presence or absence of chloroquine at 3 V/cm for 12 h. RgyA and RgyB were produced separately in E. coli using the pET expression system of Studier et al. (20Studier F.W. Rosenber A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Google Scholar). ThergyB coding sequence was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a recombinant λ phage carrying the entire gene and cloned into the NdeI-BamHI site of pET-16b, placing a 22-amino acid leader containing a poly(His) sequence onto the amino terminus of the protein. rgyA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a recombinant λ phage that carried the full-length gene. The first codon of the open reading frame was changed from TTG to ATG, and a second alternative translation start site in a different reading frame adjacent to the first codon was removed by making a silent mutation in a Asn codon (changing AAT to AAC).rgyA was cloned into the NdeI-BamHI site of pET3. Four liters of Superbroth were inoculated with BL21::λDE3 pLysE carrying the RgyA or RgyB expression plasmid. Cells were grown at 37 °C to anA600 of 0.8 with aeration, then isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration, 400 μm) was added, and the culture immediately shifted to 20 °C for protein expression. After 8 h the cells were harvested, yielding approximately 16 g of cells that were then resuspended in 40 ml of freezing buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 10% sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. The cell paste was thawed on ice, and an equal volume of freezing buffer containing lysozyme (0.2 μg/ml) was added. After stirring for 30 min at 4 °C, an equal volume of lysis buffer was added (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 2 mm DTT, 5 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 0.4% Brij 58) and stirred for 30 min followed by shearing of the cell lysate with a rotary homogenizer (Janke and Kunkel, Ultra-Turrax T25) to reduce viscosity. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 32,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, after which a 0.07 volume of 5% polyethyleneimine chloride, pH 8, was slowly added to the cleared lysate and then stirred for 30 min. The resulting aggregate was collected by centrifugation and washed with 50 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT) containing 300 mm NaCl to remove loosely bound protein. Proteins were removed from the polyethyleneimine aggregate with 50 ml of buffer A containing 1 m NaCl and precipitated by the addition of solid ammonium sulfate to a concentration of 50% (w/v). At this point the purifications of RgyA and RgyB diverged. The RgyA ammonium sulfate pellet was resuspended in 25 ml of buffer A (with 1 m NaCl) and dialyzed overnight against 2 liters of Buffer A (with 300 mm NaCl) containing 10% glycerol. Under these conditions, RgyA preferentially precipitates out of solution. This precipitate was collected and then redissolved in 15 ml of buffer B (50 mmTris, pH 8, 1 m NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 10% glycerol) plus 10 mm potassium phosphate and 0.1 mm EDTA. The sample was pumped through a 6-ml phosphocellulose column directly onto a 2-ml HTH column that had been pre-equilibrated with buffer B with 10 mm potassium phosphate. The phosphocellulose column was removed, and RgyA was eluted from the HTH column with 20 column volumes of a linear 0.01–0.5 m potassium phosphate gradient, pH 7.4, in buffer B. Under these conditions, RgyA eluted as two separate peaks centered on fractions 7 and 13 (Fig.1). The protein in both peaks behaves identically in the assays shown below. The second peak contains more pure RgyA protein than peak 1. Fractions corresponding to peak 2 were pooled, dialyzed against 2 liters of storage buffer (buffer A plus 1 m NaCl, 10% glycerol), and used in subsequent experiments. The pooled fractions of peak 2 yielded 2.7 mg of protein that was >90% pure (Table I).Table IPurification of reverse gyrase subunitsStepVolumeTotal ProteinmlmgRgyACell paste16,000Cleared lysate1201,007Polyethyleneimine481128(NH4)2SO428293Dialysis1567HTH pool62.8RgyBCell paste16,000Cleared lysate901,476Polyethyleneimine50991(NH4)2SO422635Ni2+column8.081Dialysis9.532Heparin pool58HTH pool22S200 pool4.50.62 Open table in a new tab The ammonium sulfate-precipitated RgyB was resuspended in 20 ml of buffer C (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 1m NaCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 10 mm imidazole and 0.1 mm EDTA, pumped through a 5-ml phosphocellulose column, and loaded directly onto a 3-ml Ni2+-Sepharose column. The phosphocellulose column was removed, and the Ni2+ column was washed with 75 ml of buffer C containing 0.05 m imidazole followed by a gradient from 0.05 to 2 m imidazole in buffer C (30 ml total). Fractions containing RgyB were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 2 liters of buffer D (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mmNaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm DTT). Some precipitate was observed that was removed by centrifugation. The sample was loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap heparin column at 0.1 ml/min and washed with 25 ml of buffer D, and the protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1–1 m NaCl in buffer D (50 ml total, Fig.2). Fractions in which the major protein observed was full-length RgyB were pooled, adjusted to 10 mm potassium phosphate, and loaded directly onto a 2-ml HTH column, and the sample was washed with 10 ml of Buffer E (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) plus 10 mm potassium phosphate. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient (20 ml total) from 10 to 600 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, in buffer E. Fractions in which the major protein component was full-length RgyB were pooled. The sample was split into three separate aliquots, and each aliquot was separated on a Superdex 200HR 10/30 sizing column pre-equilibrated with buffer A with 1 m NaCl and 10% w/v glycerol. Samples of full-length RgyB were pooled, yielding 0.61 mg of protein (Fig. 2, Table I). RgyA protein was insoluble when overexpressed in E. coli at 37 °C, but solubility was improved by expressing the protein at 20 °C. After induction of the cells and lysis as described under “Experimental Procedures,” approximately 50% of the overexpressed protein remained in the soluble fraction of the cleared lysate. The same proportion of RgyA stayed in the soluble fraction even when the salt concentration of the lysis buffer was lowered to 100 mm NaCl. The production of soluble RgyA may rely on the cold shock response of E. coli. Alternatively, translation at a lower temperature may proceed slowly enough to allow regions of secondary structure sufficient time to fold. Improved solubility of other recombinant proteins from hyperthermophiles by growth at lower temperatures has been observed (1Adams M.W.W. Perler F.B. Kelly R.M. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 662-668Google Scholar). The solubility of recombinant RgyB was also improved by expressing the protein at 20 °C (data not shown). RgyB undergoes considerable proteolytic cleavage and premature translation termination during expression in E. coli,creating a very heterogeneous sample (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). However, by being selective in which fractions were pooled during purification, it was possible to isolate a sample that was almost exclusively full-length RgyB. Using a single-column purification protocol for RgyA and a four-column purification protocol for RgyB, each subunit was purified to >90% homogeneity as determined by scanning analysis of stained SDS-PAGE gels of each sample. Although RgyA eluted as two separate peaks from an HTH column (Fig. 1), these two fractions had biochemical properties that were indistinguishable by several tests. In a supercoiling assay of 1 μl of each column fraction of RgyA from the HTH column together with 0. 25 μg of purified RgyB revealed two peaks of enzymatic activity corresponding with the two peaks of RgyA protein that eluted from the column. RgyA samples from peak 1 and peak 2 both elute in the excluded volume of an S200 sizing column, indicating a tendency to form high molecular mass aggregates (see below). Finally, protein from either peak of RgyA can form a stable heterodimer with RgyB at high temperature (see below). We speculate that these two peaks may represent two different folding intermediates of RgyA that have different affinity for the HTH packing material. In the early steps of the purification procedure, RgyA had a strong tendency to precipitate out of solution at lower salt concentrations. We used this property to our advantage in the purification by collecting the precipitate that formed during dialysis from 1m NaCl to 300 mm NaCl (Fig. 1). This precipitate readily dissolved in buffers containing 1 mNaCl and did not behave like denatured protein. After passage of the sample through a phosphocellulose column, RgyA remained in solution on dialysis into buffers containing as little as 100 mm NaCl. We believe this precipitation of early fractions is due to residual polyethyleneimine in the sample that is later removed by passage through the phosphocellulose column (19Burgess R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 3-10Google Scholar). Because all previously isolated reverse gyrases were single-chain enzymes (14Forterre P. Cell. 1996; 85: 789-792Google Scholar, 15Shibata T. Nakasu S. Kumiko Y. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10419-10421Google Scholar), it had not been possible to test whether the DNA-dependent ATPase activity was associated with the helicase-like domain. In the reverse gyrase from M. kandleri, the conserved amino acid motifs shared with other DNA-dependent ATPases are in RgyB (18Krah E.R. Kozyavkin S.A. Slesarev A.I. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 106-110Google Scholar). Recombinant RgyB displayed a DNA-dependent ATPase activity but only at elevated temperatures (Fig. 3). Efficient hydrolysis of ATP was not observed until 60 °C, with a large increase in activity from 60 to 80 °C (Fig.4 B). Preheating RgyB with DNA at 80 °C before incubation with ATP at lower temperatures did not enhance ATPase activity (data not shown). RgyA by itself did not hydrolyze ATP, even in the presence of DNA (data not shown).Figure 4Positive supercoiling activity of reconstituted RgyA and RgyB. Reactions were performed at 80 °C for 15 min in the presence of EDTA, Mg2+, or Mg2+ with ATP as indicated. The figure is a digitized photograph of an ethidium bromide-stained gel with the image inverted to enhance contrast.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Positive supercoiling activity was reconstituted from the recombinant RgyA and RgyB protomers by mixing equal volumes of the subunits in storage buffer (at concentrations of 0.47 mg/ml for RgyA and 0.14 mg/ml for RgyB), heating for 5 min at 80 °C, and assaying as described (Fig.4, lanes 12 and 24). Analysis of the reaction products on agarose gels in the presence of chloroquine demonstrated that either relaxed or negatively supercoiled DNA became positively supercoiled (Fig. 4, lower panel, lanes 12 and24). In the absence of ATP, but with Mg2+present, RgyA/B was able to bind and nick the substrate DNA but was not able to complete the ligation reaction (Fig. 4, lower panel(Relaxed Substrate), compare lanes 22–24). In the absence of Mg2+, RgyA/B nicking of the supercoiled substrate was greatly reduced. When purified from M. kandleri, the reverse gyrase heterodimer was very stable, with the two subunits copurifying through four separate chromatographic steps (17Kozyavkin S.A. Krah R. Gellert M. Stetter K.O. Lake J.A. Slesarev A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11081-11089Google Scholar). Denaturing SDS-PAGE was the only effective method found to separate the two subunits. To determine if a stable heterodimer could be reconstituted from the recombinant subunits, a mixture of RgyA and RgyB was dialyzed against storage buffer at 4 °C overnight, in parallel with separate samples of RgyA and RgyB. The samples were split, and half of each sample was heated to 80 °C for 5 min. Samples were then analyzed using gel filtration chromatography at room temperature. Both heated and unheated samples of RgyB eluted at a position consistent with a molecular mass of 150 kDa, indicating that this subunit is monomeric at a concentration of 5 μg/ml (Fig. 5). In contrast, unheated RgyA eluted in the excluded volume of the S200 column (Fig. 5; see also Fig. 6). After heating to 80 °C, approximately 20% of the material eluted at a position consistent with a monomer (40 kDa). The elution profile of the unheated mixed RgyA/B sample resembled a superposition of the unheated RgyA and RgyB profiles. In contrast, the elution profile of the heated RgyA/B sample showed that the peak corresponding to the RgyA aggregate decreased in amount, and the peak corresponding to RgyB shifted from 150 to 180 kDa (Fig. 5). SDS-PAGE analysis of fractions demonstrated that both RgyA and RgyB were present in the 180-kDa peak in approximately a 1:1 ratio, with very little RgyA in the excluded volume (Fig. 6). Enzyme isolated from this peak had a specific activity of 2.1 × 105units/mg, which is very similar to the activity of the complete enzyme prepared from M. kandleri.Figure 6The effect of heating mixed samples of RgyA and RgyB. Heating allows formation of a stable RgyA/B heterodimer. Samples were allowed to mix overnight at 4 °C before analysis using S200 sizing chromatography. 50-μl fractions were collected during column elution with 10 μl of each fraction loaded onto the gel.Unheated, sample was loaded directly onto the sizing column.Heated, sample was heated for 5 min at 80 °C before loading onto the column. MWM, molecular mass standards.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Prolonged incubation of a mixture of RgyA and RgyB at low temperature did not yield a stable heterodimer (Fig. 6) nor did heating the subunits separately at 80 °C for 5 min followed by cooling and mixing at room temperature (see Fig. 7). However, heating (80 °C for 5 min) the two subunits together led to the formation of a stable heterodimer. The formation of an active heterodimer upon coincubation of the two subunits at high temperature may be due to the release of RgyA from a misfolded state that resulted from its growth in E. coli. Other proteins from extreme thermophiles that are multimers when expressed in E. colihave also required heating to become active. Work by DiRuggiero and Robb (21DiRuggiero J. Robb F.T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 159-164Google Scholar) demonstrated that approximately 50% of the hexameric enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase from the hyperthermophile Pyrococcus furiosus is in the form of inactive monomers when overexpressed and purified from E. coli. Heating the inactive monomers converts these to the active multimeric complex. To our knowledge, reverse gyrase from M. kandleri is the first heterodimeric enzyme from a hyperthermophile to be reconstitutedin vitro (1Adams M.W.W. Perler F.B. Kelly R.M. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 662-668Google Scholar). Now that an active reverse gyrase can be reconstituted from a recombinant source, both deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis can be used to investigate the reaction mechanism of this unusual enzyme. We thank members of our laboratory for helpful and insightful discussions during the course of this work. We also thank Alison B. Hickman and Joanne Hesse for reading and helpful comments on the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1975610954,"Animal-based research comprises almost half of the portfolio of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). It is vital to the biomedical community but is encountering unprecedented challenges to its continued success. These challenges are related to technological advances in science and to specific aspects of the regulatory climate and costs of animal research. These are not abstract issues for the individual scientist. The costs for animal research may determine in which institution a scientist pursues his/her research and with whom he/she can, or cannot, collaborate. The National Allergy and Infectious Disease Advisory Council outlined many of these challenges in a resolution forwarded to NIH Director Varmus in February 1996. As scientists who deal with this issue daily, we highlight the origins and the potential solutions.

Much current animal-based research focuses on basic biological mechanisms or host-agent interactions and requires specific pathogen free, genetically uniform rodents, especially mice. Many are designer animals that offer a unique opportunity to understand the function of specific genes or to create rodent models that are susceptible to human pathogens. Animals with induced mutations may be unusually susceptible to infectious agents including some previously considered inconsequential. These designer rodents require intensive health monitoring and more sophisticated husbandry; as a result expenses for equipment and specialized animal care have increased significantly.

Historically, the NIH supported the infrastructure of animal resource programs as an essential component that protected federal investments in biomedical research. This support included grants to train veterinarians in specialties central to animal-based studies: research skills, laboratory animal medicine, and comparative pathology. Training grants now preclude substantive clinical training leaving a potential deficit in clinical support that can only be met by highly skilled professionals. Federal support for animal diagnostic laboratories (microbiology, virology, and pathology) also has been discontinued. Ironically, this has occurred as the need for diagnostic support to protect the health of designer animals has escalated. The animal diagnostic laboratories represented a financial partnership between the federal funding agencies and the biomedical community. As financial demands on institutions have increased, they find it difficult to fund these essential programs alone, despite their critical importance in support of animal health.

An additional hidden cost has resulted from the growth of organismal approaches to molecular genetics, especially utilizing the achievements of the Human Genome Project. This growth also has brought many scientists with little or no background in animal research to animal-based studies. These individuals often require training by animal resource staff and veterinarians to prepare them to perform animal experimentation appropriately and to comply with regulations governing animal welfare.

Animal welfare is a vital concern for the public and the scientific community; as a result, animal experimentation is heavily regulated. Regulatory agencies require extensive documentation of virtually all activities that involve animal use, entailing additional effort from investigators, administrators, and animal resource staff. Animal resource staff spend many hours reviewing required animal care protocols for institutional animal care and use committees, counseling and training scientists and their staff, providing veterinary medical care, monitoring compliance, and dealing with a myriad of details, inspections, and reports required by regulatory and accrediting agencies. Although regulations continue to proliferate, the cost: benefit ratio has not been adequately assessed scientifically, ethically, or financially by society, legislators, and regulatory agencies.

Probably the single most damaging action to affect the cost of animal research was the federal government’s decision to consider research animal resource programs as “specialized facilities.” This action required that all the costs of operating such facilities must be excluded from the institution’s indirect cost recovery agreement and instead should be fully recovered from users. The rationale underlying this approach appears flawed, because other types of regulated research, for example, that using radioactive isotopes, are not treated in this fashion. Federal negotiators have implemented the “specialized facility” rule inconsistently in apparently comparable institutions. When it is applied, the direct costs of animal research soar—often more than doubling ([1][1]). Coupled with the federal government’s increasing efforts to drive down the recovery of the indirect costs of research, the effect on an animal care program can be devastating. Ongoing efforts by the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) to standardize the methodology for allocating costs of animal use are an important step as are the ongoing discussions with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) that seek to redress this targeting of animal research. The draft for cost analysis and rate setting is available for comment until 12 May 1997 ( ).

We have responsibilities for the oversight of laboratory animal programs in major research institutions. As investigative scientists we applaud the opportunities presented by animal research; as research animal program and animal facility administrators, we strive to find ways to achieve them. We cannot do this alone. We seek partnership with fellow scientists who use research animals, institutional leadership, an informed public, and the federal government. To remove penalties from animal research and benefit animal welfare, we recommend that the revised standards of cost allocation by OMB be adopted promptly and that the designation as “specialized facilities” be removed from animal resource programs. Requiring institutions to allocate animal care costs comparably would create a level playing field; institutions could bench mark their costs and identify areas to improve efficiency based on local conditions. To further enhance animal welfare, we recommend that increasing funds be allocated to support animal health infrastructure especially for specialized animal populations.

We know of no national forum to exchange views or seek workable and timely solutions. A workshop planned by the NCRR is an important step in this direction. However, we believe that it is important that the scientific community be aware of the obstacles to continued productive animal-based research and join in overcoming them.
