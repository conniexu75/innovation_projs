https://openalex.org/W2083533622,"The response of the testes of juvenile and adult hamsters to various photoperiods was examined. The testes of juvenile animals reached maturity regardless of the light cycle on which the animals were raised. However, the testes of adult hamsters required at least 12.5 hours of light per day to maintain spermatogenesis and prevent degeneration. This is one of the few demonstrations of a response suitable for study in investigations of the photoperiodic control of testicular function in a laboratory mammal."

Cross circulation for 7 hours or less was ineffective."
https://openalex.org/W2005456813,Apparent enzyme concentrations in cells and in mitochondria are calculated from data available in the literature. These values are 10(-6) to 10(-5) moles per kilogram of tissue. It is pointed out that these concentrations are much higher than those used in enzymatic studies in vitro. Metabolic interpretations of experiments in vitro should consider this additional departure from conditions in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W1996069300,"Acid extracts of thyroid glands from a small shark Squalus suckleyi and domestic fowl Gallus domestica contained no detectable calcitonin activity, while very potent hypocalcemic responses were obtained in rats with similar extracts from the ultimobranchial glands of these two species. The calcitonin concentration was 4 to 40 times that present in hog thyroid, which, as in most other mammals, contains ultimobranchial tissue. The evidence suggests that calcitonin is a fundamental calcium-regulating hormone present in all higher vertebrates and that it is an ultimobranchial rather than a thyroid hormone. It also indicates an important and hitherto unrecognized function for the ultimobranchial glands."

https://openalex.org/W1983109895,"The capacity for binding dimethyl d-tubocurarine-C(14) was studied in isolated nerve-ending membranes from cerebral cortex and myelin. After treatment of the membrane with organic solvents most of the radioactivity was recovered in the extract. Preliminary evidence indicates that dimethyl d-tubocurarine-C(14) is not bound to lipids or glycolipids. While the proteolipids of myelin have a low binding capacity, the results obtained with the nerve-ending membranes rich in acetylcholinesterase suggest that the cholinergic receptor may be a special type of proteolipid."
https://openalex.org/W1532186861,"Abstract The conformation of the 1:1 complex of protoporphyrin IX and apomyoglobin was studied by circular dichroism, potentiometric titration, and reaction with bromoacetate. Circular dichroism studies indicate that protoporphyrin and heme similarly affect the α-helix content of apomyoglobin. The apparent number of normal imidazoles in the protoporphyrin-apomyoglobin complex, as judged by reactivity to H+ ion and bromoacetate, is very similar to that of myoglobin and different from that in globin. These data suggest that the conformational difference between myoglobin and apomyoglobin is determined mainly by the interaction of globin with the porphyrin and not with the heme iron. The lesser stability to acid of porphyrin complexes than of myoglobin is tentatively explained by the absence of the iron-imidazole bond in the porphyrin complexes. Potentiometric titration of the 1:1 complex of globin with 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate indicates that this complex has the same number of normal imidazoles as does globin. These studies and those summarized above support a direct relationship between the α-helix content of myoglobin derivatives as determined by optical activity and the number of normally titratable imidazole side chains. The photosensitivity of porphyrin-apomyoglobin complexes was shown to be due to porphyrin-sensitized photooxidation of globin. Manometric studies and amino acid analysis indicated that it is the initial oxidation of 1 or 2 histidine residues, apparently at the binding site, which leads to impairment of porphyrin binding."

They are intended to provide a base for discussion leading to the development of public policy for the inclusion of such values in water quality standards.

https://openalex.org/W2074777966,"ALTHOUGH the isolation of ergosterol peroxide from the extracts of several different fungi has been reported1–4, the question of its authenticity as a metabolite in these cases does not seem to have been raised. In the present case, the peroxide was found to be present in extracts of sporophores of Piptoporus betulinus or of Daedalea quercina. These extracts, however, had been exposed to daylight for several days and the peroxide could not be detected initially in fresh extracts. Ergosterol (RF 0.40) and ergosterol peroxide (RF 0.23) were both easily detected by T.L.C. on silica using 1 per cent methanol in chloroform as eluent, characteristic intense blue–black and dark green colours, respectively, being developed after spraying with coric ammonium nitrate and heating briefly at 100° C. A sample of the peroxide isolated after chromatography on silicic acid was identical in all respects with a synthetic sample5."

https://openalex.org/W2064054229,"Sphingid moths (Manduca sexta) were reared for several generations on an artificial diet deficient in vitamin A and its precursors. Retinal tissue from depleted moths was removed for histological examination. There was extensive histolysis in the retinal epithelium and underlying nervous and connective tissues. This pathology correlated with severe visual impairment, even though normal growth, metamorphosis, and reproduction occurred. In the adult this pathology could be reversed when the larvae were reared only on tobacco (its usual host) or on the artificial diet supplemented with beta-carotene or vitamin A palmitate."

The polarity implies that the genome is translated in the direction of IIIa to IIIb. From the known homology of the messenger RNA with the single-stranded DNA, the orientation of the DNA with respect to the genetic map can also be inferred."

A program of direct inquiry and a search of the literature revealed that there was no universally used signal and that scientific and safety organizations concurred in the need for one. Criteria for symbol design were established, and final selection was based on ""uniqueness"" and ""memorability."" The National Institutes of Health is recommending use of the symbol as a warning of biological hazard."

https://openalex.org/W2091813421,"A known inhibitor of pteridine utilization (4-phenoxy,2,6-diamino pyridine) blocks the synthesis of colored carotenoids in the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum. In many ways the effect is similar to the inhibition of the synthesis of colored carotenoids by diphenylamine. This inhibition is probably independent of other effects of pteridine on photosynthetic electron transport since it is not as readily reversible as the total inhibition of photosynthetic activity by pteridine analogs."

https://openalex.org/W2010404117,"MANY compounds have been tested for their ability to react with the oxygen-binding site of haemocyanin and it has been found that thiourea1 and thiocyanate2 cause the expulsion of oxygen from Helix pomatia haemocyanin with a consequent decrease in the absorption of the copper bands at 346 and 570 mµ. This effect was almost completely reversed by dialysis or by treatment with an anion exchange resin. A report on the exchange reaction of ethyl isocyanide with oxygen in oxyhaemoglobin3 encouraged us to investigate the effect of this compound on haemocyanin. Ethyl isocyanide does not remove copper from haemocyanin, but it does cause a decrease in the copper bands, which presumably indicates the expulsion of oxygen."

https://openalex.org/W2034294621,"IN the recent communication under this title, Bolodia and Young1 say that “… no satisfactorily reproducible effect of growth hormone in vitro on carbohydrate metabolism has been described”. No grounds are given for rejecting the comprehensive evidence of Ottaway and Bulbrook2 for effects on the glucose uptake of rat diaphragm which are practically identical with those now described by Bolodia and Young, nor for the evidence of Bronk and Fisher3 that very small concentrations of bovine growth hormone produce anti-insulin effects on the perfused rat heart. Bronk and Fisher showed that growth hormone reduced glucose uptake and permeability to galactose in the absence of insulin as well as in its presence. It follows that growth hormone produces an effect which offsets the action of insulin but is not acting as an anti-insulin."

In a further attempt to locate the peroxide induced by pregnancy, the blood of pregnant mice was examined."
