https://openalex.org/W2052922251,"Water rapidly crosses the plasma membrane of red blood cells (RBCs) and renal tubules through specialized channels. Although selective for water, the molecular structure of these channels is unknown. The CHIP28 protein is an abundant integral membrane protein in mammalian RBCs and renal proximal tubules and belongs to a family of membrane proteins with unknown functions. Oocytes from Xenopus laevis microinjected with in vitro-transcribed CHIP28 RNA exhibited increased osmotic water permeability; this was reversibly inhibited by mercuric chloride, a known inhibitor of water channels. Therefore it is likely that CHIP28 is a functional unit of membrane water channels."

https://openalex.org/W2071969879,"Blood pressure and tissue perfusion are controlled in part by the level of intrinsic (myogenic) vascular tone. However, many of the molecular determinants of this response are unknown. Evidence is now presented that the degree of myogenic tone is regulated in part by the activation of large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels in arterial smooth muscle. Tetraethylammonium ion (TEA+) and charybdotoxin (CTX), at concentrations that block calcium-activated potassium channels in smooth muscle cells isolated from cerebral arteries, depolarized and constricted pressurized cerebral arteries with myogenic tone. Both TEA+ and CTX had little effect on arteries when intracellular calcium was reduced by lowering intravascular pressure or by blocking calcium channels. Elevation of intravascular pressure through membrane depolarization and an increase in intracellular calcium may activate calcium-activated potassium channels. Thus, these channels may serve as a negative feedback pathway to control the degree of membrane depolarization and vasoconstriction."

https://openalex.org/W1482769266,"This paper reports an investigation on the relationship between the proton electrochemical gradient (delta mu H+) and the cyclosporin A-sensitive permeability transition pore (PTP) in rat liver mitochondria. Using the SH group cross-linker phenylarsine oxide as the inducer, we show that both matrix pH and the membrane potential can modulate the process of PTP induction independently of Ca2+. We find that membrane depolarization induces the PTP per se when pHi is above 7.0, while at acidic matrix pH values PTP induction is effectively prevented. Since Ca2+ uptake leads to major modifications of the delta mu H+ (i.e. matrix alkalinization and membrane depolarization), we have explored the possibility that the Ca(2+)-induced changes of the delta mu H+ may contribute to PTP induction by Ca2+. Our data in mitochondria treated with Ca2+ plus N-ethylmaleimide and Ca2+ plus phosphate show that membrane depolarization is a powerful inducer of the PTP. Taken together, our observations indicate that the PTP can be controlled directly by the delta mu H+ both in the absence and presence of Ca2+, and suggest that a collapse of the membrane potential may be the cause rather than the consequence of PTP induction under many experimental conditions. Thus, many inducers may converge on dissipation of the membrane potential component of the delta mu H+ by a variety of mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1563977056,"A cDNA for human adipsin was isolated and shown to encode a protein sharing 98% amino acid sequence similarity with the protein sequence previously determined for purified natural human complement factor D. Like mouse adipsin, recombinant human adipsin displays the enzymatic activity of human complement factor D, cleaving complement factor B only when B is complexed with activated complement component C3. We conclude that human adipsin is equivalent to complement factor D and that adipsin is the homologue of factor D in rodents. Adipose tissue is a major site of synthesis of human adipsin/complement factor D mRNA, but unlike the case in rodents, human adipsin mRNA is also expressed in monocytes/macrophages. The data presented here, demonstrating the equivalence of human adipsin to complement factor D and its high level of expression in fat, suggest a previously unsuspected role for adipose tissue in immune system biology."
https://openalex.org/W1539895365,"The alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (alpha 2MR/LRP) consists of two polypeptides, 515 and 85 kDa, that are noncovalently associated. A 39-kDa polypeptide, termed the receptor-associated protein (RAP), interacts with the 515-kDa subunit after biosynthesis of these molecules and remains associated on the cell surface. This molecule regulates ligand binding of alpha 2MR/LRP (Herz, J., Goldstein, J. L., Strickland, D. K., Ho, Y. K., and Brown, M. S. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 21232-21238). Titration and binding studies indicate that RAP binds to two equivalent binding sites on alpha 2MR/LRP, with a KD of 14 nM. Heterologous ligand displacement experiments demonstrated that RAP completely inhibits the binding of 125I-activated alpha 2M to human fibroblasts and to the purified alpha 2MR/LRP, with a Ki of 23 and 26 nM, respectively. A direct correlation between the degree of binding of RAP to the receptor and the degree of ligand inhibition was observed, indicating that as the RAP binding sites are saturated, alpha 2MR/LRP loses its ability to bind ligands. Thus, the amount of RAP bound to alpha 2MR/LRP dictates the level of receptor activity. A model is proposed in which alpha 2MR/LRP contains multiple ligand binding sites, each regulated by a separate RAP site."
https://openalex.org/W1482741711,"We previously cloned, sequenced, and expressed two distinct mammalian Na+/H+ exchanger isoforms (NHE-1 and NHE-2). We report here the cloning of a composite cDNA which encodes a third mammalian isoform (NHE-3), which is expressed specifically in intestine and kidney. The protein deduced from the longest open reading frame of this composite sequence has 832 amino acids with a calculated Mr of 92,747. The hydrophobicity plot of NHE-3 is very similar to that of NHE-1 and NHE-2. NHE-3 is also predicted to have 10-12 membrane-spanning domains and a long cytoplasmic domain which contains putative protein kinase phosphorylation motifs. NHE-3 exhibits overall 41% amino acid identity with NHE-1. NHE-3 is likely a glycoprotein as it has one potential N-linked glycosylation site, which is conserved in all NHEs identified. Northern blot analysis of poly(A+) RNA isolated from rabbit ileum using NHE-3 cDNA as a probe hybridized to a single 5.4-kilobase transcript. More detailed tissue distribution of message was performed by ribonuclease protection assay. It was found that NHE-3 message is only expressed in intestine and kidney, with the kidney cortex having the most abundant message, followed by intestine and kidney medulla. In intestine, ileum and ascending colon have the same amount of message, with much lesser amounts in jejunum. The message is absent from duodenum and descending colon, which lack the neutral NaCl absorptive process. Thus, NHE-3 might be involved in Na+ absorption in intestinal and renal epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1968578988,"The gene that encodes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is defective in patients with cystic fibrosis. Although the protein product of the CFTR gene has been proposed to function as a chloride ion channel, certain aspects of its function remain unclear. The role of CFTR in the adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent regulation of plasma membrane recycling was examined. Adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate is known to regulate endocytosis and exocytosis in chloride-secreting epithelial cells that express CFTR. However, mutant epithelial cells derived from a patient with cystic fibrosis exhibited no cAMP-dependent regulation of endocytosis and exocytosis until they were transfected with complementary DNA encoding wild-type CFTR. Thus, CFTR is critical for cAMP-dependent regulation of membrane recycling in epithelial tissues, and this function of CFTR could explain in part the pleiotropic nature of cystic fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2085324214,The mammalian splicing factor SC35 is required for the first step in the splicing reaction and for spliceosome assembly. The cloning and characterization of a complementary DNA encoding this protein revealed that it is a member of a family of splicing factors that includes mammalian SF2/ASF. This family of proteins is characterized by the presence of a ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-type RNA binding motif and a carboxyl-terminal serine-arginine-rich (SR) domain. A search of the DNA sequence database revealed that the thymus-specific exon (ET) of the c-myb proto-oncogene is encoded on the antisense strand of the SC35 gene.
https://openalex.org/W1576253698,"A human myeloid transcript of approximately 4 kilobases was cloned as a cDNA from an expression library based on homology with the guinea pig cDNA recently described by Honda et al. (Honda, Z-I., Nakamura, M., Miki, I., Minami, M., Watanabe, T., Seyama, Y., Okado, H., Tok, H., Ito, K., Miyamato, T., and Shimizu, T. (1991) Nature 349, 342-346) as a receptor for platelet-activating factor (PAF). The cloned DNA confers high affinity binding sites for platelet-activating factor when transfected into COS-7 cells and has binding and desensitization properties similar to the human leukocyte receptor. Southern analysis using this cDNA indicates that the PAF receptor gene is present as a single copy in the human genome. The deduced protein sequence predicts seven hydrophobic regions for the PAF receptor, characteristic of the rhodopsin gene family, and is 83% identical to the deduced protein sequence of the corresponding guinea pig molecule. A modified human PAF receptor cDNA was constructed by inserting an additional 30 nucleotides after the 5'-ATG, encoding the amino acid sequence MDYKDDDDKEF, which is specifically recognized by a monoclonal antibody. The modified cDNA encodes a functional PAF receptor and is detected by antibody on the membrane of transfected COS-7 cells. The use of this construct supports the structural model for the rhodopsin-like superfamily of receptors which places the NH2-terminal sequence on the extracellular side of the membrane, and should additionally be useful for affinity purification of the receptor protein."
https://openalex.org/W198347449,"Low stringency screening of a Jurkat cDNA library with a rat brain K+ channel (RCK1) probe has resulted in the isolation of HLK3, a voltage-gated K+ channel. In Xenopus oocytes, the HLK3 clone directs the expression of a rapidly activating transient outward K+ current similar to the type n K+ current recorded in Jurkat T cells. The HLK3 gene is located on the short arm of human chromosome 1 (p13.3). Polymerase chain reaction was used to clone HIsK from Jurkat cDNA. The HIsK clone shares the same sequence with a previously described genomic clone (Murai, T., Kazikuka, A., Takumi, T., Ohkubo, H., and Nakanishi, S. (1989) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 161, 176-181). In Xenopus oocytes, it encodes a slowly activating, noninactivating K+ channel which cannot be recorded in Jurkat cells by conventional patch-clamp techniques. Transcripts of both clones are present at a similar level before and after activation of purified human T lymphocytes and Jurkat cells, reflecting a constitutive expression of K+ channel messages. This finding is in good agreement with the electrophysiological results for type n K+ current density on the same cells. HLK3 current is very sensitive to the scorpion toxin charybdotoxin (IC50 = 0.8 nM). HIsK current is totally insensitive to this toxin but is blocked by the antiarrhythmic clofilium (IC50 = 80 microM). While charybdotoxin has no effect on interleukin 2 mRNA induction, clofilium potently inhibits interleukin 2 mRNA expression upon mitogen-induced T cell activation. It is concluded that the HLK3 channel is not an important component of the T cell mitogenic response. Other targets for K+ channel blockers, such as the HIsK protein, could be involved in the activation process."
https://openalex.org/W1567385135,"Matrilysin (PUMP, MMP-7) is a member of the metalloprotease gene family, whose constituents are responsible for the remodeling of extracellular matrix. The matrilysin protein is a 28-kDa zymogen possessing catalytic activities against a broad range of extracellular matrix substrates including proteoglycans, gelatin, fibronectin, laminin, and elastin. To gain insights into the biological expression of matrilysin in human cell types, we generated a monospecific, polyclonal antibody against a 16-amino acid sequence derived from its catalytic domain, a region which lacked significant homology with other matrix metalloenzymes. We found this antibody capable of precipitating a 28-kDa protein from the conditioned media of human bone marrow-derived promonocytes and human peripheral blood monocytes cultivated in vitro. Promonocyte matrilysin was rapidly converted to a 19-kDa form by organomercurial activation. While matrilysin was constitutively synthesized by bone marrow-derived promonocytes, its secretion was markedly up-regulated by the mononuclear phagocyte activator, lipopolysaccharide. Furthermore, despite its expression in monocyte precursors, blood monocytes, and monocyte-derived macrophages, matrilysin was not synthesized by human alveolar macrophages under any tested condition. In situ hybridization studies with matrilysin cRNA confirmed the presence of specific mRNA in both human promonocytes and monocytes. Moreover, a marked increase in hybridizable mRNA was observed with lipopolysaccharide treatment suggesting that matrilysin synthesis is pretranslationally regulated. In summary, this represents the first report documenting constitutive and regulated synthesis of matrilysin by a normal human cell type and suggests that matrilysin is expressed as a significant secreted product of mononuclear phagocytes at an intermediate stage of cellular differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1543924168,"The thermodynamic characteristics of oligosaccharide binding to an antibody binding site that is dominated by aromatic amino acids suggest that the hydrophobic effect contributes substantially to complex formation as well as hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions. A detailed titration microcalorimetric study on the temperature dependence of the binding of a trisaccharide, representing the epitope of a Salmonella O-antigen, showed that its maximum binding to the monoclonal antibody Se155-4 occurs just below room temperature and both enthalpy and entropy changes are strongly dependent on temperature in a mutually compensating manner. The heat capacity change also shows an unusually strong temperature dependence being large and negative above room temperature and positive below. van't Hoff analysis of the temperature dependence of the binding constant yielded a biphasic curve with two apparent intrinsic enthalpy estimations (approximately -100 kJ mol-1 above 18 degrees C and approximately +100 kJ mol-1 below), each very different from the calorimetrically determined enthalpies (ranging from about -60 kJ mol-1 to -20 kJ mol-1). This was interpreted as being due to large enthalpy contributions from concomitant reactions, most notably changes in solvation. Linear plots, -delta H0 versus -T delta S0, observed for temperature-dependent measurements mirror the behavior seen for a series of functional group replacements, suggesting that the molecular and physical origin of these phenomena are closely related and linked to the role of water in complex formation. The thermodynamic results are compared to the mode of binding determined from a 2.05-A resolution structure of the Fab-oligosaccharide complex, and with literature data for the heat capacities of sugars in aqueous solution and for the thermodynamics of carbohydrate binding to transport proteins and lectins."
https://openalex.org/W1592482289,"Beta 1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta 1,4-GT) is a Golgi-resident, type II membrane-bound glycoprotein that functions in the coordinate biosynthesis of complex oligosaccharides. Additionally, beta 1,4-GT has been localized to the cell surface of a variety of cell types and tissues where it is proposed to function in intercellular recognition and/or adhesion. Thus beta 1,4-GT is an appropriate molecule to be used in analyzing the molecular basis for retention of a membrane-bound enzyme in the Golgi complex and its subsequent or alternative transport to the cell surface. Previously we have shown that the gene for bovine and murine beta 1,4-GT is unusual in that it specifies a short (SGT) and long (LGT) form of the enzyme (Russo, R. N., Shaper, N. L., and Shaper, J. H. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 3324-3331). The only difference between the two related forms is in the primary structure of the cytoplasmic domains, where LGT has an NH2-terminal extension of 13 amino acids. In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that LGT and SGT are differentially retained in the Golgi or directed to the cell surface. LGT, SGT or chimeric proteins, containing the NH2-terminal cytoplasmic and transmembrane domain of SGT and LGT fused to the cytoplasmic protein pyruvate kinase, were each stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Proteins expressed from each construct were localized by immunofluorescence staining exclusively to a perinuclear region, identified as the Golgi by co-localization with wheat germ agglutinin. Furthermore, the subcellular distribution of both SGT and LGT was restricted to the trans-Golgi compartment as assessed by EM immunoelectron microscopy. These data suggest that both forms of beta 1,4-GT are resident trans-Golgi proteins and that an NH2-terminal segment containing the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of SGT (39 amino acids) or LGT (52 amino acids) is sufficient for Golgi retention."
https://openalex.org/W1530010679,"Chlorophyll apoprotein accumulation and expression were examined in mutants of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii blocked at specific steps of carotenoid or chlorophyll synthesis. In the absence of carotenoids: 1) apoproteins of the core and light-harvesting complexes of photosystem I (CCI and LHCI, respectively) and photosystem II (CCII and LHCII, respectively) do not accumulate; 2) mRNAs for the CCI, CCII, and LHCII apoproteins accumulate to normal levels; and 3) synthesis of the chlorophyll apoproteins is differentially affected, or in some cases, not affected. In the absence of chlorophylls: 1) the apoproteins fail to accumulate; 2) mRNA levels for CCI and CCII apoproteins are relatively unchanged; 3) levels of LHCII apoprotein mRNA, but not rates of LHCII mRNA synthesis, are reduced in a light-dependent chlorophyll-synthesis mutant (ya12); and 4) synthesis of chlorophyll apoproteins is differentially affected or not affected in the case of several chloroplast-encoded apoproteins. These results demonstrate a direct role for carotenoids as well as chlorophylls in the stabilization of certain chlorophyll apoproteins and, for others, possibly in their translation. The data also indicate a role for chlorophyll synthesis in the stability of LHCII mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1574905542,"Abstract We previously reported the structure of the placentally derived human cysteine-rich (h crp) cDNA and demonstrated that it encodes a highly conserved and widely distributed zinc finger-like protein. We now report that the expression of both the mouse and human crp genes is induced as a primary response to serum in quiescent Balb/c 3T3 cells and in human fibroblasts. The profile of this primary response is remarkably parallel to that of c-myc in the Balb/c 3T3 cell line. The structure of the 23.2-kilobase h crp gene demonstrates that it is a member of a gene superfamily encoding proteins sharing a highly characteristic 52-amino acid LIM/double-finger motif. The evolutionarily conserved structure of cysteine-rich protein, its structural similarity to a number of developmentally critical proteins, its distinctive tissue distribution, and its primary response to early events in the cell cycle suggest that crp plays an important role in cell function."
https://openalex.org/W1562561022,"A polypeptide of M(r) 36,000 (36 kDa) was isolated from detergent-solubilized membrane fractions of mammalian brain on a benzodiazepine affinity column utilized for the purification of the gamma-aminobutyric acid/benzodiazepine receptor protein, followed by preparative gel electrophoresis. Partial protein sequence for two fragments of the 36-kDa polypeptide allowed the isolation of cDNA clones from a rat hippocampal library. An open reading frame coding a sequence of 295 amino acid residues containing the two probe peptide sequences with minor differences, and a putative N-terminal signal peptide of 25 residues was found. Hydropathy index revealed no regions of alpha-helix suitable for membrane spanning, but several areas of alternating hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues consistent with beta-strands. The sequence of this brain protein was 24% identical to that of a yeast mitochondrial protein, the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), and over 70% identical with the VDAC from human B lymphocytes. The gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor/36-kDa preparation purified on benzodiazepine affinity column has channel-forming activity in lipid bilayer membranes that is virtually identical to VDAC isolated from mitochondria of various sources, indicating that the 36-kDa protein is a new member of the VDAC family of proteins. An antiserum raised against the purified 36-kDa polypeptide was able to precipitate [3H]muscimol binding activity, indicating a tight association with the GABAA receptor protein in vitro and copurification on the benzodiazepine affinity column due to this association. Further studies are needed to determine whether such an association occurs in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1491455340,"The folding and oxidation of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor solubilized from Escherichia coli inclusion bodies was investigated. During the folding process, two intermediates, I1 and I2, were detected by kinetic studies using high performance liquid chromatography. I1 exists transiently and disappears quickly with the concomitant formation of I2. In contrast, I2 requires a longer time to fold into the final oxidized form, N. CuSO4 catalysis increases the folding rate of I2 from I1, while CuSO4 and elevated temperature (37 degrees C) have a dramatic effect on the folding rate of N from I2. These observations suggest the following sequential oxidative folding pathway. [sequence: see text] Peptide map analysis of the iodoacetate-labeled intermediates revealed that I1 represents the fully reduced granulocyte colony-stimulating factor containing 5 free cysteines; I2 is the partially oxidized species containing a single Cys36-Cys42 disulfide bond; and N, the final folded form, has two disulfide bonds. The physicochemical properties and biological activities of I1, I2, N, and several Cys—-Ser analogs made by site-directed mutagenesis were further investigated. In guanidine hydrochloride-induced denaturation studies, the disulfide-reduced intermediates and the analogs missing either of the disulfide bonds are conformationally less stable than those of the wild type molecule or the analog with the free Cys at position 17 changed to Ser. Recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor lacking either disulfide bond or both has overall secondary and tertiary structures different from those of the wild type molecule and exhibits lower biological activity. These studies show that disulfide bond formation is crucial for maintaining the molecule in a properly folded and biologically active form."
https://openalex.org/W1502578912,"cDNA comprising the entire length of the human muscle glycogen debranching enzyme was cloned and its nucleotide sequence determined. The debrancher mRNA includes a 4545-base pair coding region and a 2371-base pair 3'-nontranslated region. The calculated molecular mass of the debrancher protein derived from cDNA sequence is 172,614 daltons, consistent with the estimated size of purified protein (Mr 165,000 +/- 500). A partial amino acid sequence (13 internal tryptic peptides with a total of 213 residues) determined on peptides derived from purified porcine muscle debrancher protein confirmed the identity of the cDNA clone. Comparison of the amino acid sequence predicted from the human glycogen debrancher cDNA with the partial protein sequence of the porcine debrancher revealed a high degree (88%) of interspecies sequence identity. RNA blot analysis showed that debrancher mRNA in human muscle, lymphoblastoid cells, and in porcine muscle are all similar in size (approximately 7 kilobases). Two patients with inherited debrancher deficiency had a reduced level of debrancher mRNA, whereas two other patients had no detectable abnormality in RNA blots. The isolation of the debrancher cDNA and determination of its primary structure is an important step toward defining the structure-function relationship of this multifunctional enzyme and in understanding the molecular basis of the type III glycogen storage disease."
https://openalex.org/W1864169613,"Abstract Meprin A, a membrane-bound oligomeric metalloendopeptidase, contains two different subunits, alpha and beta. We report here the cloning and sequencing of the alpha subunit cDNA. The translated polypeptide consists of 760 amino acids, including a preprosequence (77 amino acids) that precedes the NH2 terminus of the purified enzyme. The next 198 amino acids constitute the protease domain, which includes the astacin family signature sequence, HE(L,I)XHXXGFXHE(Q,H)XRXDRDX(Y,H)(V,I)X(I,V). An immunoglobulin/major histocompatibility complex protein signature was found at the end of the protease domain. At the COOH terminus of the alpha subunit, there is an epidermal growth factor-like domain, followed by a transmembrane domain, and six additional amino acids. Ten potential glycosylation sites have been identified, and at least three of those sites are glycosylated. Northern blot analyses of kidney tissue from C57BL/6 and C3H/He mice indicate that variations in meprin A activity in these strains reflect differences in the levels of the alpha subunit mRNA. Several internal peptide sequences obtained from the beta subunit indicate that it is approximately 50% identical to the alpha subunit. Furthermore, NH2-terminal sequence analyses (39 residues) indicate that rat and mouse alpha are 79% identical, rat and mouse beta are 74% identical, and that alpha and beta subunits for both species are 47% identical. These data indicate that alpha and beta are closely related products of divergent evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1562093660,"In a previous study, we showed that the rat hepatic insulin receptor (IR) kinase of endosomes (ENs) was transiently activated to levels exceeding those of plasma membrane (PM) receptors following insulin injection. Phosphatase treatment of EN receptors abolished IR kinase activation implicating beta-subunit autophosphorylation as a mediator of the activation process (Khan, M. N., Baquiran, G., Brule, C., Burgess, J., Foster, B., Bergeron, J. J. M., and Posner, B. I. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 12931-12940). In the present study, the phosphotyrosine (PY) content of the IR beta-subunit in PM and ENs was estimated by two different methods. In one method, direct in vivo labeling with 32Pi followed by receptor immunoprecipitation was carried out. In the second method, immunoblotting with antibodies against the submembrane domain of the IR beta-subunit, encompassing residue 960 (alpha 960), and with antibodies against PY (alpha PY) was used to determine the content of PY/beta-subunit in PM and ENs following injection of insulin. By both methods, it was found that the PY content of PM IR was significantly greater than that of IR in ENs. With doses of 1.5 micrograms of insulin/100 g body weight (50% receptor occupancy) or 15 micrograms/100 g body weight (receptor saturation), the PY/beta-subunit of PM IR attained a level 2.0 to 2.5-fold of that observed for the IR of ENs. Surprisingly, the IR of ENs incorporated 3 to 5 times more PY/beta-subunit than those of PM consequent to autophosphorylation. Exogenous IR kinase activity (poly(Glu:Tyr)) in PM changed only slightly with insulin dose. In contrast, EN receptors exhibited a dose-dependent increase in kinase activity coincident with the decrease in PY/beta-subunit levels. A comparison of the proportion of receptor and kinase activity immunoprecipitated by alpha PY both before and after autophosphorylation indicated that ENs but not PM contained a small population of lightly phosphorylated but highly activated receptors. Since Thr12-Lys (IR kinase residues 1142-1153) efficiently inhibited IR autophosphorylation of both PM and EN receptors, Tris phosphorylation of beta-subunit regulatory tyrosines was unlikely. These results may be explicable by a dephosphorylation-dependent activation of IR kinase, as seen with the src family of tyrosine kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1595568818,"The complete primary structure of a new extracellular protein associated with elastic fiber microfibrils was determined by recombinant DNA techniques. Antiserum to insoluble bovine ocular zonule protein was used to screen a lambda gt11 cDNA expression library constructed from whole chick embryo poly(A)+ RNA. The cDNAs encoding immunoreactive fusion polypeptides were then used to rescreen the library by plaque hybridization. Nucleotide sequencing of overlapping cDNA clones revealed an open translation reading frame of 1326 bases beginning at an initiation start sequence and ending at a stop codon. The contiguous cDNA sequence contains a 3'-untranslated region of 563 bases with a possible polyadenylation site 16 bases upstream from the poly(A) tail. Primer extension of chick aortic mRNA taken together with the sequence data, reveals a 5'-untranslated region of 95 bases extending upstream from the translation start site. Northern blot analyses indicated that the isolated cDNA hybridized with a 2.1-kilobase mRNA in preparations of whole chick embryo and chick embryonic aortic, heart, and muscle RNAs. The initial translation protein encoded by the cDNA is 53,932 kDa and possesses a hydrophilic amino acid composition with glutamic acid comprising 22% of the total amino acid residues. Antiserum was elicited to a synthetic peptide sequence (14 amino acids) encoded within the deduced protein primary structure. Western blots of extracted proteins from chick embryonic aortae cultured in the presence of beta-aminopropionitrile showed that the medium and a mild salt extract contained an immunoreactive protein possessing an apparent molecular mass of 58,000 whereas harsh denaturants extracted a 32,000-kDa protein. Pulse-chase experiments using radiolabeled lysine showed that the newly synthesized 58,000-kDa protein was chased into a 32,000-kDa protein within a 2-24-h period. Immunoelectron microscopy of tissue sections from chick aortae, bovine nuchal ligament, and human ocular zonules showed that the peptide-elicited antibody localized specifically to ultrastructurally definable microfibril structures."
https://openalex.org/W1515096661,"To determine if selective activation of individual isozymes of protein kinase C (PKC) might explain the apparently divergent effects of PKC stimulation on platelets, we purified and characterized the isozymes from both platelets and human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells, a cell line that has many features of megakaryocytes. Two peaks of platelet PKC activity were resolved by hydroxylapatite chromatography; immunoblot analysis revealed that these two peaks represented the alpha and beta isozymes of PKC. In contrast, HEL cells produced only a single peak that contained the beta isozyme. None of the other PKC isozymes were detected in these fractions. The cytosol of platelets and HEL cells, however, were both found to contain the PKC-delta isozyme. Northern hybridization analyses and mRNA amplification by the polymerase chain reaction demonstrated the presence of mRNA encoding the alpha, beta, and delta PKC isozymes in platelets, but only the beta and delta isozymes in HEL cells. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), thrombin, or an endoperoxide analog induced the phosphorylation of the 47-kDa substrate of PKC (pleckstrin) found in platelets and HEL cells; preincubation of either HEL cells or platelets with PMA reduced the intracellular Ca2+ rise induced by thrombin. Thus, although both HEL cells and platelets contain PKC-beta and the recently described PKC-delta isozymes, the widely distributed alpha isozyme of PKC is absent in HEL cells; however, isozymes other than PKC-alpha are sufficient for some PMA-mediated functions that are similar to those seen in stimulated platelets."
https://openalex.org/W1496473797,"The contribution of N-linked carbohydrate to the complement-inhibitory function of the human erythrocyte membrane glycoprotein, CD59, was investigated. Amino acid sequence analysis of tryptic peptides labeled with [3H]borohydride revealed an N-linked carbohydrate moiety at the Asn18 residue. No O-linked carbohydrate was detected, as judged by the failure of asialo-CD59 to bind peanut agglutinin and by its resistance to digestion by O-glycanase. The apparent molecular mass of CD59 was reduced from 18-20 to 14 kDa upon complete digestion with N-glycanase, with no detectable proteolysis. N-glycanase digestion of CD59 was associated with an 88 +/- 4% loss of the complement-inhibitory activity of the protein, as assessed by its capacity to protect chicken erythrocytes from lysis by the human C5b-9 proteins. By contrast, no change in function was observed after digestion of CD59 with neuraminidase, under conditions that removed greater than 60% of [3H]sialic acid residues. Despite loss of functional activity after N-glycanase digestion, we detected no change in the capacity of the deglycosylated CD59 to incorporate into erythrocyte membranes or to bind specifically and with species selectivity to the C8 and C9 components of the membrane attack complex. In order to alter the branched-chain structure of the N-linked carbohydrate of CD59 without enzymatic digestion, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with cDNA for human CD59 were grown in the alpha-mannosidase inhibitor, 1-deoxymannojirimycin, resulting in conversion of approximately 70% of the membrane glycoprotein to a high mannose. When grown in the presence of 1-deoxymannojirimycin, the C5b-9-inhibitory activity of CD59 expressed on the surface of the transfected CHO cells was reduced by an amount comparable to that observed for the N-glycanase digested protein. Taken together, these data suggest that normal glycosylation of Asn18 in CD59 is required for the normal expression of its complement-inhibitory activity on membrane surfaces, although these N-linked sugar residues do not contribute to CD59's affinity for the C8 and C9 components of the C5b-9 complex."

https://openalex.org/W1564256568,"In this study, we have characterized the biochemical nature of interleukin (IL)-11 receptors (IL-11R) and determined the possible signal transduction pathways mediated by IL-11 in 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes. The results show that IL-11 strongly inhibited lipoprotein lipase activity and adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells, and the suppression of lipoprotein lipase activity by IL-11 was controlled at the post-transcriptional level. The ability of IL-11 to inhibit lipoprotein lipase activity and adipogenesis therefore reflected the expression of functional IL-11R on the cell surface. Scatchard plot analysis according to specific binding data revealed the existence of a single class of high affinity IL-11R with a Kd of 3.49 x 10(-10) M and a receptor density of 5140 sites/cell on 3T3-L1 cells. Affinity cross-linking studies with 125I-IL-11 indicated that IL-11R consists of a single polypeptide chain of 151 kDa in size. Furthermore, we have studied the role of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in the IL-11R-linked signal transduction pathways. The results show that IL-11R ligation rapidly and transiently stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of 152-, 94-, 47-, and 44-kDa proteins. This effect is specific for IL-11 since neutralizing antibody to IL-11 abrogated IL-11-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, and other cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1 alpha did not change the tyrosine phosphorylation pattern in 3T3-L1 cells. These results suggest that IL-11R is closely linked to a functional protein-tyrosine kinase pathway, and tyrosine phosphorylation may be a key step in the initiation of the IL-11R-mediated transmembrane signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1579343383,"We have examined the effect of cell attachment on fibronectin and alpha 5 beta 1 integrin levels in three distinct anchorage-dependent fibroblast cell lines. Analysis of long-term biosynthetically labeled proteins from parallel cultures of adherent and nonadherent cells showed that the steady-state level of extracellular fibronectin is decreased upon loss of attachment. Pulse labeling studies and Northern blot analyses showed that the decrease occurs post-synthetically. A combined approach of surface radioiodination and biosynthetic labeling also demonstrated a selective post-synthetic decrease in cell-surface expression of the alpha 5 beta 1 integrin upon loss of cell attachment. Overall, we estimate that extracellular fibronectin and cell surface alpha 5 beta 1 integrin levels are reduced 5-7-fold in NIH-3T3, 15-20-fold in AKR-2B, and 50-fold in NRK fibroblasts. Finally, we find decreased total (serum- and cell-derived) fibronectin bound to the surface of nonadherent cells consistent with the reduced expression of alpha 5 beta 1 integrin. These results demonstrate a systematic down-regulation of fibronectin and its major receptor upon loss of attachment and suggest a potential mechanism involved in maintenance of the anchorage-dependent phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1592135366,"Membrane vesicles, prepared from mouse NIH-3T3 fibroblasts and Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing high levels of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), were fused with Mueller-Rudin planar lipid bilayers. Upon addition of the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and ATP, low conductance Cl(-)-selective ion channels were observed in 10 of 16 experiments. The channels had a linear current-voltage relationship and a unitary conductance of approximately 6.5 pS. The channels were more permeable to Cl- than to I- and showed no appreciable time-dependent voltage activation. In contrast, addition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and ATP to lipid bilayers fused with vesicles prepared from mock transfected (n = 14) cells failed to activate Cl- channels. These data support the conclusion that CFTR is a Cl- channel. They indicate that it can be reconstituted in a planar lipid bilayer and that the biophysical and regulatory properties are very similar to those observed in the native cell membrane. These data also argue against the requirement for loosely associated factors for regulation or function of the channel."
https://openalex.org/W1676413973,"pp160, a cytosolic protein with Mr of approximately 160,000, is phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to insulin and is considered to be involved in signaling from the insulin receptor. The expression of pp160 during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts to adipocytes and in adipocytes has been investigated using quantitative immunoblotting with antibodies against a peptide from pp160. Between day 6 and day 8 of differentiation induced by insulin, dexamethasone (Dex), and 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (Mix), pp160 expression increased 10-20-fold over the amount present in confluent fibroblasts. Omission of either insulin or Dex resulted in reduced expression of pp160 and in incomplete adipogenesis. Chronic treatment of fully differentiated adipocytes for 24 h with either insulin, Dex, or Mix alone in the presence of serum resulted in a decrease in the expression of pp160 by 70-85%. Chronic exposure to insulin caused a significant increase in the apparent size of pp160 to 172 kDa. Alkaline phosphatase treatment lowered the Mr of pp160 from both insulin-treated and basal cells to 150,000. These results demonstrate that pp160 is expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes during the time when insulin receptors are expressed in large numbers and that the maintenance of pp160 concentrations in adipocytes can be regulated by insulin, Mix, and Dex. The decreased expression of pp160 caused by these factors may be related to postreceptor insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1606272701,"The c-fos proto-oncogene is known to be regulated by a variety of hormones, growth factors, and other conditions that alter cellular metabolism. The regulation of c-fos RNA concentrations is known to occur both by altered RNA half-life and/or changes in the transcription rate of the gene. In most cases thus far investigated, induction of c-fos transcription by growth factors occurs very rapidly and transiently. Results presented in this paper show that ouabain, a specific inhibitor of the Na/K-ATPase increases the transcription of c-fos, as well as c-jun, in a variety of cultured cells. However, in contrast to other agents that induce c-fos and c-jun expression, the increased transcription rate of these genes in the presence of ouabain required several hours and remained elevated for at least 16 h. NIH 3T3 cells that have been transfected with deletions of the human c-fos promoter have enabled us to define at least two elements within the promotor that are regulated by ouabain. These include the serum response element and a region between 123 and 222 base pairs 5' to the start site of transcription. We speculate that regulation of the intracellular ion balance through changes in Na/K pump activity may be a general mechanism by which basal transcriptional activity of c-fos is modulated."
https://openalex.org/W1575136067,"Injury to the vascular endothelium and the subsequent inflammatory response are considered prerequisites for the development of atherosclerosis. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) production by and monocyte adhesion to aortic endothelial cells (EC) may participate in this inflammatory process and therefore are two potential targets for control by anti-inflammatory agents. Our previous studies have demonstrated that monocyte adhesion and PDGF production are stimulated by thrombin in EC. Here, we provide evidence that treatment of EC with the anti-inflammatory agent 3-deazaadenosine (c3Ado) effectively abolished thrombin-stimulated PDGF production and monocyte adhesion. c3Ado had no significant effect on either basal monocyte adhesion or constitutive PDGF production. c3Ado was also effective in negating monocyte adhesion induced by other agonists, such as interleukin-1, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and lipopolysaccharide. Northern analysis demonstrated that c3Ado significantly reduced thrombin- and PMA-stimulated steady-state levels of PDGF-A chain, PDGF-B chain, and endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1) mRNAs. Nuclear run-on studies demonstrated that a marked transcriptional activation of these genes by thrombin and PMA was abrogated by c3Ado treatment. The transcriptional rate of the alpha-tubulin gene was unaffected by the drug. Antibody binding studies with an anti-ELAM-1 monoclonal antibody 7A9 revealed that thrombin-stimulated EC expression of ELAM-1 was abolished by c3Ado, indicating that the suppression of ELAM-1 expression on EC surface may be a mechanism by which c3Ado interferes with monocyte adhesion. Experiments with the nucleoside transport inhibitor nitrobenzylthioinosine suggested that the transport of c3Ado into EC was required for its inhibitory activity. In addition, L-homocysteine thiolactone was found to potentiate the inhibitory activity of c3Ado, suggesting that the accumulation of intracellular c3Ado homocysteine may be the underlying mechanism by which c3Ado inhibits thrombin-induced EC function. Taken together, these results indicate that c3Ado may prove effective against vascular injury and inflammation through its ability to inhibit induction of both monocyte adhesion and PDGF production."
https://openalex.org/W1589436702,"Troponin T is a thin filament protein that is important in regulating striated muscle contraction. We have raised a monoclonal antibody against rabbit cardiac troponin T, monoclonal (mAb) 13-11, that recognizes its epitope in cardiac troponin T isoforms from fish, bird, and mammal but not from frog. The number of these isoforms expressed in cardiac muscle varies among species and during development. Cardiac troponin T isoforms were not found in adult skeletal muscle, while they were expressed transiently in immature skeletal muscle. We have mapped the epitope recognized by mAb 13-11 using rabbit cardiac troponin T isoforms. Analysis of stepwise cyanogen bromide digestion, which allowed association of the epitope to regions spanning methionine residues, coupled with immunoactivity of synthetic peptides, corresponding to sequences containing methionine residues, indicated that mAb 13-11 recognized its epitope in a 17-residue sequence containing the methionine at position 68, SKPKPRPFMPNLVPPKI. Comparison of skeletal and cardiac troponin T sequences suggested that the epitope was contained within the sequence FMPNLVPPKI. Synthetic peptides PFMPNLVPPKI and FMPNLVPPKI were recognized by mAb 13-11 on slot-blots. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated mAb 13-11 recognized, in order of descending affinity, the 17-, 11-, and 10-residue sequence. Preabsorption of mAb 13-11 with each of these sequences blocked the recognition of the 17-residue peptide by mAb 13-11. The domain, PFMPNLVPPKI is encoded by the 5' region of the cardiac gene exon 10 and is present in hearts across a broad range of phyla. These findings suggest that this cardiac troponin T-specific sequence confers onto myofilaments structural and functional properties unique to the heart."
https://openalex.org/W1484411973,"The cystic fibrosis (CF) phenotype is characterized by a regulatory defect in Cl- permeability in epithelia. A gene (250,000 base pairs) that is associated with this autosomal genetic disorder has been identified. To determine the cellular function of the recently cloned gene product, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), we have produced antibody against a synthetic peptide deduced from the CFTR cDNA sequence corresponding to positions 505-511. This site includes phenylalanine 508, the deletion of which is the most commonly expressed mutation in CF. We sought to determine whether the anti-CFTR505-511 peptide antibody could modulate the activation of the volume-sensitive, Ca(2+)-dependent, as well as the cAMP-dependent Cl- conductances present in the Cl(-)-secreting human colonic T84 cell line. Affinity-purified anti-CFTR505-511 antibody was introduced into the cytoplasm of individual T84 cells and its function studied using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Although cAMP-dependent Cl- current activation was inhibited in cells perfused with the anti-CFTR505-511 peptide antibody, Ca(2+)-dependent anion current activation remained unaffected. Chloride current activation, which accompanies cellular swelling, was partially attenuated in anti-CFTR505-511 antibody-loaded cells as compared with control cells perfused with either saline or irrelevant antibody. These results further support a role for CFTR in anion transport in epithelial cells and suggest its possible involvement in a number of anion transport pathways in chloride secretory epithelia."
https://openalex.org/W1496363110,"Abstract The binding domain of p75NGFR contains four of a 6-cysteine pattern. To test whether these repeats have any structural or functional independence, each repeat has been separately deleted. In each case, deletion led to the loss of most nerve growth factor (NGF) binding activity. The epitopes of two monoclonal antibodies, MC192 and 271c, could be distinguished, however. Repeat IV was found to be unnecessary for binding MC192, whereas Repeat I was not required for binding 217c. This suggests that either terminal repeat can be removed without loss of native-like structure in the remaining repeats. Trp155 in the fourth repeat forms an essential part of the 217c epitope but is not required for either MC192 or NGF binding. Deletion of the linker region between the membrane-spanning domain and the cysteine-rich domain does not affect the binding of NGF or MC192, and has only a slight, if any, effect on 217c binding. Cyclic permutation of the four repeats failed to yield protein capable of binding NGF or MC192."

https://openalex.org/W1514490651,"Vitamin D-binding protein (DBP), a member of a multigene family including alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and albumin, is a serum glycoprotein that reversibly binds and transports vitamin D and its metabolites to target cells. In this work, we demonstrate that normal and malignant human B-lymphocytes specifically bind and internalize DBP. Radioiodinated DBP (125I-DBP) was used to follow the uptake of the protein by Raji cells, a human pre-B-lymphoma cell line. Time course studies of DBP uptake by these cells exhibited a saturable profile at both 4 and 37 degrees C. The binding saturation curve obtained by incubating Raji cells at 4 degrees C with different concentrations (1.5 nM to 1.5 microM) of 125I-DBP showed two saturation plateaus; Scatchard analysis showed the presence of two groups of receptor sites with a Kd1 of 2.04 x 10(-7) M (n1 = 42,161 +/- 4,336 sites/cell) and a Kd2 of 1.01 x 10(-6) M (n2 = 198,000 +/- 48,000 sites/cell). After incubation of Raji cells at 37 degrees C with both fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and horseradish peroxidase conjugates, DBP was internalized and could be localized in the cytoplasm. DBP-horseradish peroxidase conjugates were used to follow the uptake and to determine the endocytic pathway of the protein in Raji cells. The initial steps, contrary to those observed for AFP, did not apparently involve coated pits and vesicles. Small vesicles (approximately 50-60 nm) with electron-dense DBP-horseradish peroxidase reaction products were observed that could fuse with large endosomes. These endosomes appeared dispersed in the cytoplasm with some preferential localization in the Golgi centrosphere region. Pulse-chase experiments showed that only 10% of the uptaken protein was released in a nondegraded form. Accordingly, most DBP molecules accumulated in endosomes should be degraded in lysosomes, instead of being recycled back to the surface, as in the case of AFP. Contrary to malignant B-cells (Raji), the uptake ability for DBP of normal quiescent B-lymphocytes was very low. Specific binding and internalization of DBP-FITC by these cells were observed following mitogen-induced activation. Significant values of uptake were obtained at 37 degrees C after 72 h of incubation in the presence of pokeweed mitogen. The binding of DBP-FITC was partially inhibited in the presence of an excess of unlabeled protein. Taken together, the actual results suggest that DBP receptors are constitutively expressed by malignant B-cells and in a transitory form by normal B-lymphocytes undergoing mitogen-induced activation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

https://openalex.org/W1569634992,"Abstract The pre-steady state time dependence of Na+ accumulation by the Na(+)-H+ exchanger in renal brush border membrane vesicles was investigated at 0 degree C by a manual mixing technique using amiloride to quench the reaction. Dilution of acid-loaded (pHi 5.7) vesicles into an alkaline medium (pHo 7.7) containing 1 mM 22Na+ produced a time course of amiloride-sensitive Na+ uptake that consisted of three distinct phases: 1) a lag, 2) a monoexponential burst, and 3) a linear or steady state phase. Experiments testing for the presence of 22Na+ backflux, residual Na+ binding to the membrane, and hysteresis were negative, lending support to the hypothesis that the burst phase corresponds to Na+ translocation during the initial turnover of Na(+)-H+ exchanger. Lowering the internal pH increased the amount of na+ uptake in each of the phases without affecting the apparent burst rate, whereas lowering the external pH inhibited Na+ uptake while increasing the duration of the lag phase. The pattern of inhibition produced by external H+ was of the simple competitive type, indicating that Na+ and H+ share a common binding site. Steady state Na+ uptake showed a sigmoidal dependence on internal pH (Hill coefficient = 1.67), consistent with the presence of an internal allosteric H+ activation site. Alkaline loading conditions (pHi 7.7), which favor desaturation of the internal H+ binding sites, completely abolished Na+ uptake in the steady state. In contrast, Na+ accumulation during the burst phase was reduced to 25% of an acid-loaded (pHi 5.7) control. The persistence of the burst phase and the disappearance of steady state Na+ uptake under alkaline loading conditions suggest that recycling of the H(+)-loaded exchanger is a late event in the transport cycle that follows Na+ translocation (ping-pong mechanism) and controls the steady state rate of Na+ accumulation. Activation of the recycling step involves sequential binding of H+ to the allosteric and transport sites, thus accounting for the cooperative dependence of steady state Na+ uptake on the internal [H+]."

A cysteine residue was substituted for Glu135 by site-directed mutagenesis in the mutant enzyme, in which all 3 free cysteine residues were replaced by alanine (Kanaya, S., Kimura, S., Katsuda, C., and Ikehara, M. (1990) Biochem. J. 271, 59-66), and coupled with a maleimide group, which is attached to the 5' terminus of the nonadeoxyribonucleotide (5'-GTCATCTCC-3') with a flexible tether. The resulting hybrid enzyme, d9-C135/RNase H, cleaved the phosphodiester bond between the fifth and sixth residues of the complementary nonaribonucleotide, without addition of the oligodeoxyribonucleotide. The nonaribonucleotide is cleaved by the wild-type or unmodified mutant enzyme only when the complementary oligodeoxyribonucleotide is present. When the kinetic parameters of the hybrid enzyme for the hydrolysis of the nonaribonucleotide were compared with those of the unmodified mutant enzyme for the hydrolysis of the nonanucleotide duplex, the hybrid enzyme exhibited a 7- and 4-fold decreases in the Km and kcat values, respectively, indicating that it performs multiple turnovers and has a sufficiently high hydrolytic activity. Hybrid ribonucleases H with various oligodeoxyribonucleotides in size and sequence, therefore, might be used as excellent tools for structural and functional studies of RNA."

https://openalex.org/W1481011123,"The B-fragment of diphtheria toxin binds to cell surface receptors and facilitates entry of the enzymatically active A-fragment into the cytosol. The roles of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of the B-fragment in interactions with the cell membrane were studied by measuring specific binding, insertion into membranes at low pH, and formation of cation-selective channels, as well as by toxicity measurements after association with active A-fragment. Deletion of the amino-terminal 12 amino acids of the B-fragment did not affect its ability to bind to receptors and to form ion channels at low pH, whereas both abilities were strongly impaired when one more amino acid (Trp206) was removed. Replacement of the amino-terminal 31 residues with an amphipathic sequence from human apolipoprotein A1 restored receptor binding but not ion channel formation. The binding to cells was virtually abolished when 9 residues were deleted from the carboxyl terminus. Deletion of only 4 residues or extension by 12 residues did not prevent specific binding, but reduced insertion, channel formation, and toxicity. Those deletions that reduced receptor binding ability increased the trypsin sensitivity of the B-fragment. The results indicate that the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of diphtheria toxin B-fragment are important for receptor binding, possibly because they contribute to keep the B-fragment in a binding-competent conformation. Small alterations in the carboxyl-terminal end reduced insertion, channel formation, and toxicity more than the ability of the B-fragment to bind to cells."
