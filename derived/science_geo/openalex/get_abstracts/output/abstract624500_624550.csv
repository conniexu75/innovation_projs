https://openalex.org/W2903762116,"Open source software is becoming crucial in the design and testing of quantum algorithms. Many of the tools are backed by major commercial vendors with the goal to make it easier to develop quantum software: this mirrors how well-funded open machine learning frameworks enabled the development of complex models and their execution on equally complex hardware. We review a wide range of open source software for quantum computing, covering all stages of the quantum toolchain from quantum hardware interfaces through quantum compilers to implementations of quantum algorithms, as well as all quantum computing paradigms, including quantum annealing, and discrete and continuous-variable gate-model quantum computing. The evaluation of each project covers characteristics such as documentation, licence, the choice of programming language, compliance with norms of software engineering, and the culture of the project. We find that while the diversity of projects is mesmerizing, only a few attract external developers and even many commercially backed frameworks have shortcomings in software engineering. Based on these observations, we highlight the best practices that could foster a more active community around quantum computing software that welcomes newcomers to the field, but also ensures high-quality, well-documented code."
https://openalex.org/W2905805595,"Background Global action plans to tackle antimicrobial resistance (AMR) include implementation of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS), but few studies have directly addressed the challenges faced by low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Our aim was to explore healthcare providers’ knowledge and perceptions on AMR, and barriers/facilitators to successful implementation of a pharmacist-led AMS intervention in a referral hospital in Ethiopia. Methods Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital (TASH) is an 800-bed tertiary center in Addis Ababa, and the site of an ongoing 4-year study on AMR. Between May and July 2017, using a mixed approach of quantitative and qualitative methods, we performed a cross-sectional survey of pharmacists and physicians using a pre-tested questionnaire and semi-structured interviews of purposively selected respondents until thematic saturation. We analyzed differences in proportions of agreement between physicians and pharmacists using χ2 and fisher exact tests. Qualitative data was analyzed thematically. Findings A total of 406 survey respondents (358 physicians, 48 pharmacists), and 35 key informants (21 physicians and 14 pharmacists) were enrolled. The majority of survey respondents (>90%) strongly agreed with statements regarding the global scope of AMR, the need for stewardship, surveillance and education, but their perceptions on factors contributing to AMR and their knowledge of institutional resistance profiles for common bacteria were less uniform. Close to 60% stated that a significant proportion of S. aureus infections were caused by methicillin-resistant strains (an incorrect statement), while only 48% thought a large proportion of gram-negative infections were caused by cephalosporin-resistant strains (a true statement). Differences were noted between physicians and pharmacists: more pharmacists agreed with statements on links between use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and AMR (p<0.022), but physicians were more aware that lack of diagnostic tests led to antibiotic overuse (p<0.01). More than cost, fear of treatment failure and of retribution from senior physicians were major drivers of antibiotic prescription behavior particularly among junior physicians. All respondents identified high turnover of pharmacists, poor communication between the laboratory, pharmacists and clinicians as potential challenges; but the existing hierarchical culture and academic setting were touted as opportunities to implement AMS in Ethiopia. Conclusions This knowledge and perceptions survey identified specific educational priorities and implementation strategies for AMS in our setting. This is likely also true in other LMICs, where expertise and infrastructure may be lacking."
https://openalex.org/W2906664454,"Tubulointerstitial inflammation plays a critical role in the progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN), and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes contribute to renal interstitial inflammation in DN. Decreased expression of optineurin (OPTN) is also associated with the progression of DN. We investigated the role of OPTN in activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in DN. We initially examined the renal biopsy tissues of 172 patients with type 2 DN and 32 nondiabetic patients with renal hamartoma. Expression of renal OPTN was significantly lower in patients with DN and negatively correlated with urinary levels of IL-1β and IL-18. Confocal microscopy analysis of the biopsies indicated no NLRP3 or IL-1β staining in OPTN-positive renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs), indicating a negative correlation of OPTN expression with the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. In vitro studies of murine RTECs indicated the levels of OPTN mRNA and protein decreased significantly after stimulation by a high glucose (HG) treatment. Relative to RTECs given HG., RTECs overexpressing OPTN showed significantly lower levels of NLRP3 expression, cleavage of caspase-1 and IL-1β, and release of IL-1β and IL-18. Overexpression of OPTN in the presence of HG significantly increased the costaining of microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-Iight chain 3-II and translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20 in RTECs, suggesting that OPTN enhances mitophagy. In addition, mitochondrial division inhibitor 1 blocked the inhibitory effect of OPTN overexpression on the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in the presence of HG., indicating that OPTN overexpression inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation by enhancement of mitophagy. OPTN gene silencing significantly enhanced production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) in the presence of HG. Compared with HG+OPTN small interfering RNA (siRNA)-treated RTECs, HG+OPTN siRNA+MitoTempo-treated RTECs attenuated NLRP3 inflammasome activation, suggesting that OPTN gene silencing activates the NLRP3 inflammasome by increasing mtROS in HG-treated RTECs. Taken together, our results demonstrate that OPTN inhibits the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome by enhancing mitophagy.—Chen, K., Feng, L., Hu, W., Chen, J., Wang, X., Wang, L., He, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2906037073,"Phonotraumatic vocal hyperfunction (PVH) is associated with chronic misuse and/or abuse of voice that can result in lesions such as vocal fold nodules. The clinical aerodynamic assessment of vocal function has been recently shown to differentiate between patients with PVH and healthy controls to provide meaningful insight into pathophysiological mechanisms associated with these disorders. However, all current clinical assessment of PVH is incomplete because of its inability to objectively identify the type and extent of detrimental phonatory function that is associated with PVH during daily voice use. The current study sought to address this issue by incorporating, for the first time in a comprehensive ambulatory assessment, glottal airflow parameters estimated from a neck-mounted accelerometer and recorded to a smartphone-based voice monitor. We tested this approach on 48 patients with vocal fold nodules and 48 matched healthy-control subjects who each wore the voice monitor for a week. Seven glottal airflow features were estimated every 50 ms using an impedance-based inverse filtering scheme, and seven high-order summary statistics of each feature were computed every 5 minutes over voiced segments. Based on a univariate hypothesis testing, eight glottal airflow summary statistics were found to be statistically different between patient and healthy-control groups. L1-regularized logistic regression for a supervised classification task yielded a mean (standard deviation) area under the ROC curve of 0.82 (0.25) and an accuracy of 0.83 (0.14). These results outperform the state-of-the-art classification for the same classification task and provide a new avenue to improve the assessment and treatment of hyperfunctional voice disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2906478262,"Gut microbiota in a healthy population is shaped by various geographic, demographic and lifestyle factors. Although the majority of research remains focused on the bacterial community, recent efforts to include the remaining microbial members like viruses, archaea and especially fungi revealed various functions they perform in the gut. Using the amplicon sequencing approach we analysed bacterial and fungal gut communities in a Slovenian cohort of 186 healthy volunteers. In the bacterial microbiome we detected 253 different genera. A core microbiome analysis revealed high consistency with previous studies, most prominently showing that genera Faecalibacterium, Bacteroides and Roseburia regularly comprise the core community. We detected a total of 195 fungal genera, but the majority of these showed low prevalence and are likely transient foodborne contaminations. The fungal community showed a low diversity per sample and a large interindividual variability. The most abundant fungi were Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans. These, along with representatives from genera Penicillium and Debaryomyces, cover 82% of obtained reads. We report three significant questionnaire-based host covariates associated with microbiota composition. Bacterial community was associated with age and gender. More specifically, bacterial diversity was increased with age and was higher in the female population compared to male. The analysis of fungal community showed that more time dedicated to physical activity resulted in a higher fungal diversity and lower abundance of S. cerevisiae. This is likely dependent on different diets, which were reported by participants according to the respective rates of physical activity."
https://openalex.org/W2905955323,"Poultry and meat products contaminated with Salmonella enterica are a major cause of foodborne illness in the United States. The food industries use a wide variety of antimicrobial interventions to reduce bacterial contamination. However, little is known about Salmonella susceptibility to these compounds and some studies have shown a concerning link between biocide resistance and antibiotic resistance. To investigate this, a 96 well panel of 17 common household and commercially used biocides was designed to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of these compounds for Salmonella. The panel contained two-fold serial dilutions of chemicals including Dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride (DC), Benzalkonium chloride (BKC), Cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), Hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HB), Hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride (HC), Acetic acid (AA), Lactic acid (LA), Citric acid (CA), Peroxyacetic acid (PXA), Acidified sodium chlorite (ASC), Sodium hypochlorite (SHB), 1,3 dibromo, 5,5 dimethylhydantoin (DBH), Chlorhexidine (CHX), Sodium metasilicate (SM), Trisodium phosphate (TSP), Arsenite (ARI), and Arsenate (ARA). The assay was used to test the susceptibility of 88 multidrug resistant (MDR) Salmonella isolates from animal sources. Bacteria are defined as multidrug resistant (MDR) if it exhibited non-susceptibility to at least one agent in three or more antimicrobial categories. The concentration of biocide at which ≥50% of the isolates could not grow was designated as the minimum inhibitory concentration or MIC50 and was used as the breakpoint in this study. The MIC50 (μg ml-1) for the tested MDR Salmonella was 256 for DC, 40 for BKC, 80 for CPC. HB and HC, 1,640 for AA, 5664 for LA, 3,156 for CA, 880 for PXA, 320 for ASC, 3.0 for CHX, 1,248 for DBH, 3,152 (6%) for SHB, 60,320 for SM, 37,712 for TSP, 56 for ARI and 832 for ARA. A few isolates were not susceptible at the MIC50 breakpoint to some chemicals indicating possible resistance. Isolates with MICs of two 2-fold dilutions above the MIC50 were considered resistant. Biocides for which resistant isolates were detected included CPC (n = 1 isolate), HB (1), CA (18), ASC (7), CHX (22), ARA (16), and ARI (4). There was no correlation detected between the biocide susceptibility of Salmonella isolates and antibiotic resistance. This assay can determine the MICs of bacteria to 17 biocides in a single test and will be useful in evaluating the efficacy of biocides and to detect the development of resistance to them."
https://openalex.org/W2951113216,"Herein, we report the design of electrospun ultrathin fibers based on the combination of three different polymers polycaprolactone (PCL), polyethylene glycol (PEG), and gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA), and their potential bactericidal activity against three different bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). We evaluated the morphology, chemical structure and wettability before and after UV photocrosslinking of the produced scaffolds. Results showed that the developed scaffolds presented hydrophilic properties after PEG and GelMA incorporation. Moreover, they were able to significantly reduce gram-positive, negative, and MRSA bacteria mainly after UV photocrosslinking (PCL:PEG:GelMa-UV). Furthermore, we performed a series of study for gaining a better mechanistic understanding of the scaffolds bactericidal activity through protein adsorption study and analysis of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Furthermore, the in vivo subcutaneous implantation performed in rats confirmed the biocompatibility of our designed scaffolds."
https://openalex.org/W2906301988,"Background Acute stroke results in functional disability measurable using the well-known Barthel Index. The objectives of the study are to describe the change in the Barthel Index score and to model the prognostic factors for Barthel Index change from discharge up to 3 months post-discharge using the random intercept model among patients with acute first ever stroke in Kelantan, Malaysia. Methods A total 98 in-hospital first ever acute stroke patients were recruited, and their Barthel Index scores were measured at the time of discharge, at 1 month and 3 months post-discharge. The Barthel Index was scored through telephone interviews. We employed the random intercept model from linear mixed effect regression to model the change of Barthel Index scores during the three months intervals. The prognostic factors included in the model were acute stroke subtypes, age, sex and time of measurement (at discharge, at 1 month and at 3 month post-discharge). Results The crude mean Barthel Index scores showed an increased trend. The crude mean Barthel Index at the time of discharge, at 1-month post-discharge and 3 months post-discharge were 35.1 (SD = 39.4), 64.4 (SD = 39.5) and 68.8 (SD = 38.9) respectively. Over the same period, the adjusted mean Barthel Index scores estimated from the linear mixed effect model increased from 39.6 to 66.9 to 73.2. The adjusted mean Barthel Index scores decreased as the age increased, and haemorrhagic stroke patients had lower adjusted mean Barthel Index scores compared to the ischaemic stroke patients. Conclusion Overall, the crude and adjusted mean Barthel Index scores increase from the time of discharge up to 3-month post-discharge among acute stroke patients. Time after discharge, age and stroke subtypes are the significant prognostic factors for Barthel Index score changes over the period of 3 months."
https://openalex.org/W2902379956,"The Internet of Things (or IoT), which enables the networked interconnection of everyday objects, is becoming increasingly popular in many aspects of our lives ranging from entertainment to health care. While the IoT brings a set of invaluable advantages and opportunities with it, there is also evidence of numerous challenges that are yet to be resolved. This is certainly the case with regard to ensuring the cyber security of the IoT, and there are various examples of devices being hacked. Despite this evidence, little is known about the public perceptions of the opportunities and challenges presented by the IoT. To advance research in this direction, we mined the social media platform Twitter to learn about public opinion about the IoT. Analysing a longitudinal dataset of more than 6.7 million tweets, we reveal insights into public perceptions of the IoT, identifying big data analytics as the most positive aspect, whereas security issues are the main public concern on the negative side. Our study serves to highlight the importance of keeping IoT devices secure, and remind manufacturers that it is a concern that remains unresolved, at least insofar as the public believes."
https://openalex.org/W2903759666,"Aim The purpose of this study was to clarify whether fatty pancreas might lead to impaired pancreatic endocrine or exocrine function. Material and methods The study involved 109 participants who had undergone the glucagon stimulation test and N-benzoyl-L-tyros-p-amino benzoic acid (BT-PABA) test to assess pancreatic function as well as unenhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT). Pancreatic endocrine impairment was defined as ΔC peptide immunoreactivity less than 2 [mmol/L] in the glucagon stimulation test, and pancreatic exocrine impairment was defined as a urinary PABA excretion rate less than 70% on the BT-PABA test. We defined as the mean CT value of pancreas / CT value of spleen (P/S ratio) as a marker to assess fatty pancreas. We analyzed the association between fatty pancreas and pancreatic impairment using the logistic regression model. The odds ratio (OR) is shown per 0.1 unit. Results Pancreatic endocrine function was impaired in 33.0% of the participants, and 56.9% of those were regarded as having pancreatic exocrine impairment. The P/S ratio was significantly correlated with pancreatic endocrine impairment in univariate analysis (OR = 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.43–0.83, P = 0.0013) and multivariate analysis (OR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.22–0.61, P < .0001) for all participants. Similar significant relationships were observed in both univariate (OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.49–0.99, P = 0.04) and multivariate (OR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.21–0.66, P = 0.0002) analyses for the participants without diabetes (n = 93). The amount of pancreatic fat was not associated with exocrine impairment in univariate analysis (OR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.59–1.06, P = 0.12). Conclusion Fatty pancreas was associated with pancreatic endocrine impairment but did not have a clear relationship with pancreatic exocrine impairment."
https://openalex.org/W2906061577,"Background The increased incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus among hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected patients is likely due to viral-induced insulin resistance (IR). Indeed, control of diabetes in these patients benefits of successful antiviral treatment; whether the same applies to subtler alterations of glucose metabolism is unknown. We aimed to fill this gap. Methods The study population included 82 HCV-RNA positive patients (48 males, median age 66 years, 73 with advanced fibrosis, 41 HCV-1b), attending the liver clinic of an academic hospital to receive direct antivirals. None was previously known to be diabetic. All underwent a standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) before antiviral treatment and right after its conclusion. Results At baseline, the majority of patients had evidence of abnormal glucose metabolism (N. = 45, 55%; impaired fasting glucose 10%, impaired glucose tolerance16%, both the above 12%, 17% diabetes), while only 37 (45%) were normally glucose tolerant (NGT). At the end of treatment, HCV-RNA quantification was below the detection threshold (HCV-RNA <12 UI/ml), for all patients enrolled. A significant decrease in glucose and insulin plasma concentrations was observed, leading to a significant reduction in Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA)-IR (from 3.42 [2.66–5.38] to 2.80 [1.78–3.95];p<0.001) and a corresponding increase in insulin sensitivity (ISI Belfiore from 0.49 [0.26–0.75] to 0.64 [0.42–0.91];p<0.001), despite a significant reduction in insulin secretion (EFP Stumvoll from 1363 [959–1730] to 1264 [976–1588];p = 0.027). Importantly, HOMA-IR reduction occurred also in the subgroup of NGT patients (p = 0.017). The number of NGT patients increased to 53, 65% (p = 0.013) paralleled by a reduced number of those satisfying criteria for prediabetic conditions (31 (38%) vs. 17 (21%); p = 0.025). Conclusions Glucose metabolism parameters of HCV infected patients improve early after antiviral treatment, with benefits that are not limited to diabetics. These findings confirm how deep and widespread is the impairment of insulin pathways exerted by HCV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2906200622,"Nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), the first line of defense, are the cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that regulate the inflammatory activity in response to invading pathogens. NLRs are the members of AAA+ ATPase superfamily that comprises of N-terminal EBD(s), a centrally positioned NOD/NACHT and varying range of LRRs towards the C-terminal end. Due to the lack of structural data, the functional aspects of NLRP-signaling mechanism, which includes pathogen recognition, nucleotide-binding, and sensor-adaptor-effector interactions, are not fully understood. In this study, we implemented structural bioinformatics approaches including protein modeling, docking, and molecular dynamics simulations to explore the structural-dynamic features of ADP-/ATP-Mg2+ binding in NLRPNACHT models. Our results indicate a similar mode of ATP-Mg2+ binding in all NLRPNACHT models and the interacting residues are found consistent with reported mutagenesis data. Accompanied by the key amino acids (proposed to be crucial for ATP-Mg2+ coordination), we further have noticed that some additional conserved residues (including ‘Trp’ of the PhhCW motif, and ‘Phe’ and ‘Tyr’ of the GFxxxxRxxYF motif) are potentially interacting with ATP during dynamics; which require further experimentation for legitimacy. Overall, this study will help in understanding the ADP-/ATP-Mg2+ binding mechanisms in NLRPs in a broader perspective and the proposed ATP-binding pocket will aid in designing novel inhibitors for the regulation of inflammasome activity."
https://openalex.org/W2905974213,"Background Expressing anthropometric parameters (height, weight, BMI) as z-score is a key principle in the clinical assessment of children and adolescents. The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts and the CDC-LMS method for z-score calculation are widely used to assess growth and nutritional status, though they can be imprecise in some percentiles. Objective To improve the accuracy of z-score calculation by revising the statistical method using the original data used to develop current z-score calculators. Design A Gaussian Process Regressions (GPR) was designed and internally validated. Z-scores for weight-for-age (WFA), height-for-age (HFA) and BMI-for-age (BMIFA) were compared with WHO and CDC-LMS methods in 1) standard z-score cut-off points, 2) simulated population of 3000 children and 3) real observations 212 children aged 2 to 18 yo. Results GPR yielded more accurate calculation of z-scores for standard cut-off points (p<<0.001) with respect to CDC-LMS and WHO approaches. WFA, HFA and BMIFA z-score calculations based on the 3 different methods using simulated and real patients, showed a large variation irrespective of gender and age. Z-scores around 0 +/- 1 showed larger variation than the values above and below +/- 2. Conclusion The revised z-score calculation method was more accurate than CDC-LMS and WHO methods for standard cut-off points. On simulated and real data, GPR based calculation provides more accurate z-score determinations, and thus, a better classification of patients below and above cut-off points. Statisticians and clinicians should consider the potential benefits of updating their calculation method for an accurate z-score determination."
https://openalex.org/W2950266491,"Chronic periodontitis is a common inflammatory disease initiated by a complex microbial biofilm and mediated by the host response causing destruction of the supporting tissues of the teeth. Host recognition of pathogens is mediated by toll-like receptors (TLRs) that bind conserved molecular patterns shared by large groups of microorganisms. The oral epithelial cells respond to most periodontopathic bacteria via TLR-2 and TLR-4. In addition to the membrane-associated receptors, soluble forms of TLR-2 (sTLR-2) and TLR-4 (sTLR-4) have been identified and are thought to play a regulatory role by binding microbial ligands. sTLR-2 has been shown to arise from ectodomain shedding of the extracellular domain of the membrane receptor and sTLR-4 is thought to be an alternate spliced form. Many studies have previously reported the presence of elevated numbers of viable exfoliated epithelial cells in the saliva of patients with chronic periodontitis. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential value of salivary sTLR-2 and sTLR-4 together with the paired epithelial cell-associated TLR-2/4 mRNA as diagnostic markers for chronic periodontitis. Unstimulated whole saliva was collected after obtaining informed consent from 40 individuals with either periodontitis or gingivitis. The sTLR-2 and sTLR4 in saliva was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The TLR-2 and TLR-4 transcript in the epithelial cells in saliva was measured by real time polymerase chain reaction. While levels of sTLR-2 exhibited an inverse correlation, sTLR-4 positively correlated with clinical parameters in the gingivitis cohort. Interestingly, both correlations were lost in the periodontitis cohort indicating a dysregulated host response. On the other hand, while the sTLR-2 and the paired epithelial cell associated TLR-2 mRNA exhibited a direct correlation (r2 = 0.62), that of sTLR4 and TLR-4 mRNA exhibited an inverse correlation (r2 = 0.53) in the periodontitis cohort. Collectively, assessments of salivary sTLR2 and sTLR4 together with the respective transcripts in the epithelial cells could provide clinically relevant markers of disease progression from gingivitis to periodontitis."
https://openalex.org/W2906154879,"The possible effect of directional larval swimming on the recruitment success of the Japanese eel, Anguilla japonica, was examined with a three-dimensional particle-tracking ocean circulation model using horizontal northwestward swimming and diel vertical migration (DVM). Four separate experiments included virtual larvae (v-larvae) movement from the spawning area over 290 days (total migration) and 160 days (stage A), from the STCC eddy region in 70 days (stage B), and from the origin of the Kuroshio in 60 days (stage C) to evaluate the effect of directional swimming and DVM compared to simple drifting. Passive or random swimming were not the most effective strategies for larvae dispersing from the spawning area because most v-larvae remained south of 20°N without entering the Kuroshio. Northwestward swimming resulted in wider dispersion and a better chance of successful recruitment, with v-larvae becoming widely distributed in the STCC eddy zone, arriving at the east coast of the Philippines (stage A), escaping the STCC eddy area and reaching the Kuroshio (stage B), and crossing the Kuroshio into the East China Sea shelf (stage C). DVM slightly shortened the migration period due to faster shallow layer ocean currents during nighttime. The NEC transported non-swimming v-larvae westward to the Kuroshio and occasionally northward into the Subtropical Countercurrent (STCC) area where eddies transported v-larvae westward into the Kuroshio, but less than with swimming. Directional swimming increased recruitment success, northwestward swimming was more effective than other directions, and a slower swimming speed was still better than no/random swimming in sensitivity tests. The present study demonstrated a first view of the possibility that Japanese eel larvae might be able to use a strategy of single-direction swimming to increase arrival at their recruitment areas."
https://openalex.org/W2906129939,"Objective Depression occurs in approximately 30 percent of stroke patients, leading to increased disability, lower quality of life and increased mortality. Given new recommendations to assess depression in acute stroke patients this study evaluated rates of acute post stroke depression at a Primary Stroke Center in Doha, Qatar. Methods Acute stroke patients (n = 233) were given the PHQ-9 and the Mini-Cog test by stroke unit nurses within the first few days post stroke. This was part of a clinical improvement project conducted from March 2016 thru March 2017. Results Approximately 20% of acute post stroke patients (46/233) scored in the moderately depressed range on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9 ≥10 with item 1 and/or 2 endorsed). Nationality and dysarthria were significantly associated with depression. Females were twice as likely to be depressed. A significantly greater number of Middle Eastern and African patients were depressed (30.18%) than Southeast Asian and Western Pacific patients (16.76%). A PHQ-2 cut off of 2 was optimal with sensitivity of 91.3 and specificity of 71.6. Conclusions Almost 20% of acute stroke patients were moderately depressed on the PHQ-9, with Middle Eastern/African patients almost twice as likely to be depressed. This may reflect higher baseline pre-stroke depression levels in those of Middle Eastern/African background, perhaps due to greater levels or stress or trauma exposure in these groups. Dysarthria was found to be significantly associated with depression. Initial screening with the PHQ-2 using a cut-off of 2 (versus the cut-off of 3 used in primary care settings) may be beneficial. Based on these results acute post stroke depression screening is recommended in the Middle East, coupled with culturally sensitive psychiatric care."
https://openalex.org/W2906223012,"Background We developed and tested the effectiveness of a tailored health information technology driven intervention: “Talking Prescriptions” (Talking Rx) to improve medication adherence in a resource challenged environment. Methods We conducted a parallel, randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded trial at the Aga Khan University (AKU), Karachi, Pakistan. Adults with diagnosis of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or coronary artery disease (CAD) diagnosed least one month before enrollment, on anti-platelets and statins, with access to a mobile phone were enrolled. The intervention group received a) Daily Interactive Voice Response (IVR) call services regarding specific statin and antiplatelet b) Daily tailored medication reminders for statin and antiplatelet and c) Weekly lifestyle modification messages for a period of 3 months. We assessed Medication adherence to statin and antiplatelets by a validated version of the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence scale 8 (MMAS-8) at 3 months by a blinded assessment officer. Analysis was conducted by intention-to-treat principle (ITT). Results Between April 2015 and December 2015, 197 participants (99 in intervention and 98 in the usual care group) enrolled in the Talking Rx Study. The dropout rate was 9.6%. Baseline group characteristics were similar. At baseline, the mean MMAS-8 was 6.68 (SD = 1.28) in the intervention group and 6.77 (SD = 1.36) in usual care group. At end of follow-up, the mean MMAS-8 increased to 7.41(0.78) in the intervention group compared with 7.38 (0.99) in usual care group with mean difference of 0.03 (S.D 0.13) (95% C.I [-0.23, 0.29]), which was not statistically significant. (P-Value = 0.40) CVA patients showed a relatively greater magnitude of adherence via the MMAS-8 at the end of follow up where the mean MMAS-8 increased to 7.29 (S.D 0.82) in the intervention group as compared to 7.07(S.D 1.24) in usual care group with mean difference of 0.22 (SD = 0.22) 95% C.I (-0.20, 0.65) with (P-value = 0.15). Around 84% of those on intervention arm used the service, calling at least 3 times and listening to their prescriptions for an average of 8 minutes. No user was excluded due to technologic reasons. Conclusion The use of a phone based medication adherence program was feasible in LMIC settings with high volume clinics and low patient literacy. In this early study, with limited follow up, the program did not achieve any statistically significant differences in adherence behavior as self—reported by the MMAS-8 Scale.

https://openalex.org/W2906283384,"Developing materials for use in photovoltaic (PV) systems requires knowledge of their performance over the warranted lifetime of the PV system. Poly(ethylene-terephthalate) (PET) is a critical component of PV module backsheets due to its dielectric properties and low cost. However, PET is susceptible to environmental stressors and degrades over time. Changes in the physical properties of nine PET grades were modeled after outdoor and accelerated weathering exposures to characterize the degradation process of PET and assess the influence of stabilizing additives and weathering factors. Multivariate multiple regression (MMR) models were developed to quantify changes in color, gloss, and haze of the materials. Natural splines were used to capture the non-linear relationship between predictors and responses. Model performance was evaluated via adjusted-R2 and root mean squared error values from leave-one-out cross validation analysis. All models described over 85% of the variation in the data with low relative error. Model coefficients were used to assess the influence of weathering stressors and material additives on the property changes of films. Photodose was found to be the primary degradation stressor and moisture was found to increase the degradation rate of PET. Direct moisture contact was found to impose more stress on the material than airbone moisture (humidity). Increasing the concentration of TiO2 was found to generally decrease the degradation rate of PET and mitigate hydrolytic degradation. MMR models were compared to physics-based models and agreement was found between the two modeling approaches. Cross-correlation of accelerated exposures to outdoor exposures was achieved via determination of cross-correlation scale factors. Cross-correlation revealed that direct moisture contact is a key factor for reliable accelerated weathering testing and provided a quantitative method to determine when accelerated exposure results can be made more aggressive to better approximate outdoor exposure conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2906518919,"Background Despite a call for differentiated care, there are limited data from sub-Saharan Africa on comprehensive community-based HIV care for key populations (KP), including commercial sex workers (CSW), men who have sex with men (MSM), and people who inject drugs (PWID). In Nigeria, a programme was implemented that liaised with community-based organizations and offered HIV testing, same-day ART initiation, and ART follow-up to KP. Here we characterize KP and their partners enrolled on ART. Our objective is to assess the early treatment outcomes and to estimate predictors of attrition among KP. Method This is a retrospective cohort study of routinely collected data in a community-based HIV program for KP in Nasarawa state, Nigeria from August 2016 to November 2017. Variables of interest were socio-demographic, KP types, treatment outcomes, ART adherence, WHO stage, TB status and viral load. Summary statistics, logistic and Cox proportional hazard regression were used to describe the characteristics of KP and estimate predictors of attrition (patients either lost to follow-up (LTFU) or dead). Result Seven hundred and ten (710) KP and their partners were enrolled into this study, 77.3% (549) of study participants were female and the median age was 30 years (IQR: 24–35). Respectively, 74.2%, 4.5%, 1.1% and 20% were FSW, MSM, PWID and their partners. Of 710 KP who started ART, 13.9% (99/710) discontinued after the first visit. After a median follow-up time of 7 months on ART 73.2% of patients were retained, 23.4% were LTFU, and 3.4% were dead. Lack of formal education (aHR 1.8; 95% CI 1.3–2.6) and unemployment (aHR 1.8; 95% CI 1.2–2.6) were significantly associated with attrition. Conclusion Comprehensive community-based HIV care, including HIV testing and same-day ART is feasible. However, ART initiation on the same day of confirmatory HIV testing resulted in a high uptake of ART, but possibly inflated early attrition on ART. To mitigate early attrition among KP after same-day ART initiation, the psychosocial readiness of clients should be assessed better. We strongly recommend further studies to understand factors contributing to high attrition among the KP."
https://openalex.org/W2906567785,"The Chloride Channel (CLC) gene family is reported to be involved in vacuolar nitrate (NO3-) transport. Nitrate distribution to the cytoplasm is beneficial for enhancing NO3- assimilation and plays an important role in the regulation of nitrogen (N) use efficiency (NUE). In this study, genomic information, high-throughput transcriptional profiles, and gene co-expression analysis were integrated to identify the CLCs (BnaCLCs) in Brassica napus. The decreased NO3- concentration in the clca-2 mutant up-regulated the activities of nitrate reductase and glutamine synthetase, contributing to increase N assimilation and higher NUE in Arabidopsis thaliana. The genome-wide identification of 22BnaCLC genes experienced strong purifying selection. Segmental duplication was the major driving force in the expansion of the BnaCLC gene family. The most abundant cis-acting regulatory elements in the gene promoters, including DNA-binding One Zinc Finger, W-box, MYB, and GATA-box, might be involved in the transcriptional regulation of BnaCLCs expression. High-throughput transcriptional profiles and quantitative real-time PCR results showed that BnaCLCs responded differentially to distinct NO3- regimes. Transcriptomics-assisted gene co-expression network analysis identified BnaA7.CLCa-3 as the core member of the BnaCLC family, and this gene might play a central role in vacuolar NO3- transport in crops. The BnaCLC members also showed distinct expression patterns under phosphate depletion and cadmium toxicity. Taken together, our results provide comprehensive insights into the vacuolar BnaCLCs and establish baseline information for future studies on BnaCLCs-mediated vacuolar NO3- storage and its effect on NUE."
https://openalex.org/W2906160967,"This study investigates a possible relationship between perceived and self-ascribed gender identity and the respective acoustic correlates in a group of young heterosexual adult speakers. For the production study, a sample of 37 German speaking subjects (20 males, 17 females) filled out a questionnaire to assess their self-ascribed masculinity/femininity on two scales. A range of acoustic parameters (acoustic vowel space size, fundamental frequency, sibilant spectral characteristics) were measured in speech collected from a picture describing task. Results show that male speakers judging themselves to be less masculine exhibited larger vowel spaces and higher average fundamental frequency.For the perception experiment, a group of 21 listeners (11 males, 10 females) judged masculinity of single word male stimuli drawn from the collected speech sample. A significant correlation between speakers’ self-ascribed and listeners’ attributed gender identity was found with a stronger relationship for female listeners. Acoustic parameters used by listeners to attribute gender identity include those used by speakers to index masculinity/femininity.The investigation demonstrates the importance of including self-ascribed gender identity as a potential source of inter-speaker variation in speech production and perception even in a sample of heterosexual adult speakers."
https://openalex.org/W2906221343,"One of the pathological site effects in excitotoxic activation is Zn2+ overload to postsynaptic neurons. Such an effect is considered to be equivalent to the glutamate component of excitotoxicity. Excessive uptake of Zn2+ by active voltage-dependent transport systems in these neurons may lead to significant neurotoxicity. The aim of this study was to investigate whether and which antagonists of the voltage gated calcium channels (VGCC) might modify this Zn2+-induced neurotoxicity in neuronal cells. Our data demonstrates that depolarized SN56 neuronal cells may take up large amounts of Zn2+ and store these in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial sub-fractions. The mitochondrial Zn2+ excess suppressed pyruvate uptake and oxidation. Such suppression was caused by inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, aconitase and NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase activities, resulting in the yielding of acetyl-CoA and ATP shortages. Moreover, incoming Zn2+ increased both oxidized glutathione and malondialdehyde levels, known parameters of oxidative stress. In depolarized SN56 cells, nifedipine treatment (L-type VGCC antagonist) reduced Zn2+ uptake and oxidative stress. The treatment applied prevented the activities of PDHC, aconitase and NADP-IDH enzymes, and also yielded the maintenance of acetyl-CoA and ATP levels. Apart from suppression of oxidative stress, N- and P/Q-type VGCCs presented a similar, but weaker protective influence. In conclusion, our data shows that in the course of excitotoxity, impairment to calcium homeostasis is tightly linked with an excessive neuronal Zn2+ uptake. Hence, the VGCCs types L, N and P/Q share responsibility for neuronal Zn2+ overload followed by significant energy-dependent neurotoxicity. Moreover, Zn2+ affects the target tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, yields acetyl-CoA and energy deficits as well."
https://openalex.org/W2906009502,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the combined 17β-estradiol (E2) and exercise training on cardiac pro-survival and anti-apoptotic pathways in ovariectomized rats.Fifty-six female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into a sham-operated (Sham), a bilaterally ovariectomized (OVX), an OVX treated with E2 (OVX-E2; 10μg/kg/day), and an OVX with E2 and treadmill exercise training (OVX-E2-EX; 60 min/day, 5 days/week) for 10 weeks. Following 10 weeks of exercise training, rat hearts were isolated for the evaluation of Histopathological analysis, TUNEL assay, and Western blotting.The protein levels of estrogen receptor α (ERα), estrogen receptor β (ERβ), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R), phospho-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p-PI3K) (estrogen receptors/IGF-1-related survival pathway) were significantly increased in either the OVX-E2 or OVX-E2-EX group when compared with the OVX group. The protein levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), B-cell lymphoma-extra-large (Bcl-xL) and phosphorylated-Bad (p-Bad) (Bcl-2 family survival pathway) were significantly increased in the OVX-E2-EX group when compared with the OVX group. Only the p-Bad was significantly increased in the OVX-E2 group when compared with the OVX group. The protein levels of truncation of Bid (t-Bid), Bcl-2-associated death promotor (Bad), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), Cytochrome c, caspases-9, and caspases-3 (mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway), as well as the protein levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), Fas ligand, Fas receptors, Fas-associated death domain (FADD), activated caspase-8 and activated caspase-3 (Fas receptor-dependent apoptotic pathway) were significantly decreased in either the OVX-E2 or OVX-E2-EX group when compared with the OVX group. Furthermore, when compared with the OVX-E2 group, the protein levels of ERβ, IGF-1, IGF-1R, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were further enhanced in the OVX-E2-EX group as well as the protein levels of Cytochrome c, Fas receptors, FADD, activated caspase-8, activated caspase-9 and activated caspase-3 were further decreased in the OVX-EX-E2 group.Combined E2 and exercise training exhibited a positive effect of protection on ovariectomy-induced cardiac apoptosis by enhancing ERβ-related survival pathways, which might provide a more effective therapeutic effect on cardiac protection in bilaterally oophorectomized or menopausal women than E2 treatment only."
https://openalex.org/W2905782795,"Accurate estimates of population abundance are a critical component of species conservation efforts in order to monitor the potential recovery of populations. Capture-mark-recapture (CMR) is a widely used approach to estimate population abundance, yet social species moving in groups violate the assumption of CMR approaches that all individuals in the population are detected independently. We developed a closed CMR model that addresses an important characteristic of group-living species-that individual-detection probability typically is conditional on group detection. Henceforth termed the Two-Step model, this approach first estimates group-detection probability and then-conditional on group detection-estimates individual-detection probability for individuals within detected groups. Overall abundance is estimated assuming that undetected groups have the same average group size as detected groups. We compared the performance of this Two-Step CMR model to a conventional (One-Step) closed CMR model that ignored group structure. We assessed model sensitivity to variation in both group- and individual-detection probability. Both models returned overall unbiased estimates of abundance, but the One-Step model returned deceptively narrow Bayesian confidence intervals (BCI) that failed to encompass the correct population abundance an average 52% of the time. Contrary, under the Two-Step model, CI coverage was on average 96%. Both models had similar root mean squared errors (RMSE), except for scenarios with low group detection probability, where the Two-Step model had much lower RMSE. For illustration with a real data set, we applied the Two-Step and regular model to non-invasive genetic capture-recapture data of mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei). As with simulations, abundance estimates under both models were similar, but the Two-Step model estimate had a wider confidence interval. Results support using the Two-Step model for species living in constant groups, particularly when group detection probability is low, to reduce risk of bias and adequately portray uncertainty in abundance estimates. Important sources of variation in detection need to be incorporated into the Two-Step model when applying it to field data."
https://openalex.org/W2906445303,"Rice is a staple food in Asia and it contributes significantly to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Malaysia and other developing countries. Brown Planthopper (BPH) causes high levels of economic loss in Malaysia. Identification of BPH presence and monitoring of its abundance has been conducted manually by experts and is time-consuming, fatiguing and tedious. Automated detection of BPH has been proposed by many studies to overcome human fallibility. However, all studies regarding automated recognition of BPH are investigated based on intact specimen although most of the specimens are imperfect, with missing parts have distorted shapes. The automated recognition of an imperfect insect image is more difficult than recognition of the intact specimen. This study proposes an automated, deep-learning-based detection pipeline, PENYEK, to identify BPH pest in images taken from a readily available sticky pad, constructed by clipping plastic sheets onto steel plates and spraying with glue. This study explores the effectiveness of a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, VGG16, in classifying insects as BPH or benign based on grayscale images constructed from Euclidean Distance Maps (EDM). The pipeline identified imperfect images of BPH with an accuracy of 95% using deep-learning’s hyperparameters: softmax, a mini-batch of 30 and an initial learning rate of 0.0001."
https://openalex.org/W2904672594,"The details of auditory response at the subthreshold level in the rodent primary somatosensory cortex, the barrel cortex, have not been studied extensively, although several phenomenological reports have been published. Multisensory features may act as neuronal representations of links between inputs from one sensory modality to other sensory modalities. Here, we examined the basic multisensory postsynaptic responses in the rodent barrel cortex using in vivo whole-cell recordings of neurons. We observed robust responses to acoustic stimuli in most barrel cortex neurons. Acoustically evoked responses were mediated by hearing and reached approximately 60% of the postsynaptic response amplitude elicited by strong somatosensory stimuli. Compared to tactile stimuli, auditory stimuli evoked postsynaptic potentials with a longer latency and longer duration. Specifically, auditory stimuli in barrel cortex neurons appeared to trigger ""up states"", episodes associated with membrane depolarization and increased synaptic activity. Taken together, our data suggest that barrel cortex neurons have multisensory properties, with distinct synaptic mechanisms underlying tactile and non-tactile responses."
https://openalex.org/W2905547581,"Neutrophils are phagocytic innate immune cells that play essential roles in host defence, but are also implicated in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) where they contribute to systemic inflammation and joint damage. Transcriptomic analysis of neutrophils has revealed significant changes in gene expression in neutrophils activated in vitro by cytokines and in vivo during inflammation in RA. However, there are no reports on the global metabolomic changes that occur as a consequence of this activation. The aim of this study was to establish protocols for the study of changes in the metabolome of human neutrophils using 1H NMR spectroscopy. Sample preparation and spectral analysis protocols were optimised using neutrophils isolated by Ficoll-Paque, with decreased washing steps and inclusion of a heat-shock step to quench metabolite turnover. Cells were incubated ± PMA for 15 min in HEPES-free media and samples were analysed by NMR using a 700 MHz NMR Avance IIIHD Bruker NMR spectrometer equipped with a TCI cryoprobe. Chenomx, Bruker TopSpin and AMIX software were used to process spectra and identify metabolites. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and signalling pathway analysis was carried out using Metaboanalyst. Cell number and number of scans (NS) were optimised as >3.6 million cells and 512 NS. 327 spectral bins were defined in the neutrophil spectra, of which 287 (87.7%) were assigned to 110 metabolites that included: amino acids, peptides and analogues; carbohydrates, carbonyls and alcohols; nucleotides, nucleosides and analogues; lipids and lipid-like molecules; benzenoids; and other organic compounds. 43 metabolites changed at least 1.5 fold (increase or decrease) after the addition of PMA for 5 or 15 min. Pathway analysis revealed that PMA affected nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and glycolysis, suggesting a redirection of glucose metabolism from glycolysis to the pentose phosphate pathway and production of NADPH for activation of the NADPH oxidase and subsequent respiratory burst. We have developed protocols for the study of human neutrophils by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Importantly, this methodology has sufficient sensitivity and reproducibility to detect changes in metabolite abundance from cell numbers typically collected from clinical samples or experiments with multiple assay conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2906060991,"Fertility intentions and contraceptive use are often not assessed in the context of clinical HIV care, representing a possible programming gap if women's family planning needs change over time. We aimed to identify longitudinal patterns of unmet need for contraception over a 12-month period among women living with HIV taking antiretroviral therapy (ART).850 non-pregnant, HIV-positive women aged 18-35 on or initiating ART in Johannesburg, South Africa, were enrolled into a prospective cohort study in 2009-2010. Fertility intentions and contraceptive use were assessed during routine HIV care visits via an interviewer-administered questionnaire, and women were referred for on-site contraceptive counseling. We used group-based trajectory modeling to identify patterns of unmet need for contraception over 12 months, first in the entire population and then in a subset of recent ART initiators.In the full population we identified four patterns of unmet need for contraception over one year. Half of the enrolled women were predicted to have a consistently high probability of unmet need, 22.9% a consistently low probability, 16.7% a decreasing probability, and 10.4% an increasing probability over time. Contraceptive method discontinuation and rapidly changing fertility intentions were the primary drivers of changing (increasing or decreasing) unmet need over follow-up. Results were similar in recent ART initiators.Half of women were estimated to have a high probability of unmet need that persisted over time, and more than a quarter were estimated to experience patterns of changing unmet need over 12 months. Family planning needs should be assessed more regularly in HIV-positive women to prevent unintended pregnancies and support safer conception among women trying to conceive."
https://openalex.org/W2906311404,"The aim of this study was to determine the potential for waste extracts from the pequi (Caryocar brasiliense) and juçara (Euterpe edulis) to reduce oxidatiove processes in antibiotic-free broiler meat. The use of natural antioxidants extracted from fruit-processing wastes has been neglected. Although these residues contain high amounts of these bioactive compounds, they are often discarded by industry. Meat samples were exposed previously submitted to UV-C radiation at 1.161 mW / cm2 for 10 minutes to accelerate the rancidity process. Pequi and juçara waste extracts were obtained by microwave-assisted extraction (MAE). A total of four conditions were tested using antibiotic-free broiler thighs and drumstick meat: BN–with no antioxidant (negative control), BP–with BHT (Butylated hydroxytoluene) (positive control), BE–with juçara extract, BC–with pequi extract. The color, pH, lipid and protein oxidation (days 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10), antioxidant contents and activity (days 0 and 10), and proximal composition and fatty acid profile (day 0) were tested, followed by principal component analysis (PCA). Pequi waste extract presented the highest antioxidant content and activity. BE and BC treatments presented the highest total phenolic (TPC) and flavonoid (TFC) content, and BE presented the highest total monomeric anthocyanin content (TAC). TFC increased during storage in all treatments. The waste extracts of C. brasiliense presented the highest antioxidant activity against lipid oxidation in the antibiotic-free broiler meat. Moreover, both extracts presented high antioxidant activity against protein oxidation. Although the pequi peel extract had a better effect in terms of suppressing both types of oxidation, either this extract or the jussara waste extract could be used as a technological strategy to reduce the oxidative processes in antibiotic-free broiler meat for the poultry industry. Thus, waste extracts can be a potential technology to reduce the oxidative processes in antibiotic-free broiler meat."
https://openalex.org/W2906386885,"Objectives We aimed to clarify the communication behaviors between trainee dentists and simulated patients (SPs), to examine how the level of trainee dentists’ self-reported empathy influences assessment by SPs in medical interviews. Materials and methods The study involved 100 trainee dentists at Okayama University Hospital and eight SPs. The trainee dentists conducted initial interviews with the SPs after completing the Japanese version of the Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE). All interviews were recorded and analyzed using the Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS). The SPs assessed the trainees’ communication immediately after each interview. The trainee dentists were classified into two groups (more positive and less positive) according to SP assessment scores. Results Compared with less-positive trainees, the more-positive trainees scored higher in the RIAS category of emotional expression and lower in the medical data gathering category. There was no difference in dental data gathering between the two groups. SP ratings for more-positive trainees were higher for use of positive talk and emotional expression and lower for giving medical information and dental information. Trainees with more positive ratings from SPs had significantly higher JSE total scores. Conclusion The results of this study suggest that responding to the emotions of patients is an important behavior in dentist-patient communication, according to SPs’ positive assessment in medical interviews. Further, SPs’ assessment of trainees’ communication was related to trainees’ self-reported empathy, which indicates that an empathic attitude among dentists is a significant determinant of patient satisfaction."
https://openalex.org/W2950169005,"The genetic variability of Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is one of the main challenges for its control, hindering not only the development of effective vaccination strategies but also its classification and, consequently, epidemiology understanding. The 624/I and Q1 genotypes, now recognized to be part of the GI-16 lineage, represent an excellent example of the practical consequences of IBV molecular epidemiology limited knowledge. In fact, being their common origin unrecognized for a long time, independent epidemiological pictures were drawn for the two genotypes. To fix this misinterpretation, the present study reconstructs the history, population dynamics and spreading patterns of GI-16 lineage as a whole using a phylodynamic approach. A collection of worldwide available hypervariable region 1 and 2 (HVR12) and 3 (HVR3) sequences of the S1 protein was analysed together with 258 HVR3 sequences obtained from samples collected in Italy (the country where this genotype was initially identified) since 1963. The results demonstrate that after its emergence at the beginning of the XX century, GI-16 was able to persist until present days in Italy. Approximately in the late 1980s, it migrated to Asia, which became the main nucleus for further spreading to Middle East, Europe and especially South America, likely through multiple introduction events. A remarkable among-country diffusion was also demonstrated in Asia and South America. Interestingly, although most of the recent Italian GI-16 strains originated from ancestral viruses detected in the same country, a couple were closely related to Chinese ones, supporting a backward viral flow from China to Italy. Besides to the specific case-study results, this work highlights the misconceptions that originate from the lack of a unified nomenclature and poor molecular epidemiology data generation and sharing. This shortcoming appears particularly relevant since the described scenario could likely be shared by many other IBV genotypes and pathogens in general."
https://openalex.org/W2906539344,"Saemangeum Reservoir in South Korea is an estuarine system enclosed by a dyke construction, where seawater inflow and retained water outflow are managed by the opening/closing of sluice gates installed in the southern part of the dyke. An exchange of the reservoir water can cause spatiotemporal fluctuations in the salinity and trophic state, which are major drivers determining variation in the composition of biological communities in estuarine systems. Here, we investigated the seasonal and spatial variability in the copepod community and environmental conditions (water temperature, salinity, transparency, chlorophyll a concentration, total nitrogen, total phosphorus and Carlson's trophic state index) based on seasonally conducted field monitoring in the Saemangeum Reservoir from July 2013 to January 2018. In addition to the role of temperature, salinity and chlorophyll a concentration in structuring the copepod community and diversity, the biological indices of copepods with respect to salinity range and trophic state, were evaluated. The spatiotemporal variability in the salinity and trophic state variables showed contrasting patterns, and chlorophyll a concentration was negatively affected by salinity, indicating that the reservoir water was being highly exchanged with opening of the sluice gates. The mean trophic state index values, however, were constant in the eutrophic state (50-70). Dominant copepods were Acartia (A. hudsonica, A. sinjiensis, Acartia spp.) and Oithona (O. davisae and Oithona spp.), which are common species in eutrophic neritic water. Variation in the copepod community was mainly associated with the seasonal succession of the dominant species rather than a spatial gradient (from around the estuary to the sluice gates); however, site-specific differences in frequencies of several non-dominant species could be detected around the estuary (Sinocalanus tenellus) and the sluice gates (Centropages spp., Tigriopus spp. and Labidocera rotunda). The copepod diversity increased with species-richness from around the estuary to the sluice gates, which could result from variation in the site-specific location of non-dominant species. The frequency of particular species was also able to discriminate in terms of the salinity range (oligohaline: A. pacifica, S. tenellus and A. sinjiensis; mesohaline: Pseudodiaptomus inopinus; and polyhaline: C. abdominalis and Centropages spp.) and the trophic state (mesotrophic: C. abdominalis, Calanus sinicus and Centropages spp.; and hypereutrophic: S. tenellus, P. inopinus and Sinocalanus spp.). The findings from this study not only identify the factors determining spatiotemporal variation in the copepod community in the Saemangeum Reservoir, but also expand the applicability of copepods as biological indicators of conditions associated with salinity range and trophic state in other enclosed estuarine systems."

The longest dsRNA element (3589 nt) encodes a putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (1114 aa), the second longest dsRNA element (2772 nt) encodes a coat protein (825 aa), and the other two dsRNAs (2676 nt, 2514 nt) encode hypothetical proteins of 768 aa and 711 aa, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequences showed 41-60% similarity to the proteins coded by the dsRNAs of the most closely related virus, Penicillium janczewskii chrysovirus 2, indicating that it is a new species based on the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses criteria for the genus Chrysovirus. This is the first virus reported from A. thermomutatus and was tentatively named Aspergillus thermomutatus chrysovirus 1. A virus free line of the fungal isolate, cured by cycloheximide treatment, produced large numbers of conidia but no ascospores at both 20°C and 37°C, whereas the virus infected line produced ten-fold fewer conidia at 20°C and a large number of ascospores at both temperatures. The effects of the virus on fungal sporulation have interesting implications for the spread of the fungus and possible use of the virus as a biological control agent."
https://openalex.org/W2906671596,"Anastrepha obliqua (Macquart), the West Indian fruit fly, is one of the most economically important pest species in the Neotropical region. It infests an extensive range of host plants that include over 60 species. The geographic range of A. obliqua is from northern Mexico to southern Brazil and includes the Caribbean Islands. Previous molecular studies have revealed significant genetic structure among populations. We used sequences from a fragment of the mitochondrial protein-coding gene cytochrome c oxidase I to estimate structure and genetic diversity of A. obliqua populations from Brazil. We analyzed a total of 153 specimens from the Amazon Forest, Atlantic Forest, Cerrado, and Caatinga biomes. Our study revealed weak genetic structure among the A. obliqua Brazilian populations sampled. Collections from the Amazon Forest had similar haplotype diversity compared to previously reported estimates for collections from the Caribbean and both populations are also closely related to each other, thus challenging the hypothesis that A. obliqua originated in the Caribbean and then moved to other regions of the Americas. Therefore, further evidence is necessary to draw a definite conclusion about the putative center of origin for A. obliqua. Additionally, we suggest a putative historical migration from the west to the east for the A. obliqua Brazilian populations, which could explain the high genetic diversity for this fly in the Amazon Forest and low genetic diversity in the other Brazilian biomes."
https://openalex.org/W2905474068,"Multiple organ dysfunction caused by hyperinflammation remains the major cause of mortality during sepsis. Excessive M1-macrophage activation leads to systemic inflammatory responses. Gene related to anergy in lymphocytes (Grail) is regarded as an important regulator of T cells that functions by diminishing cytokine production. However, its role in regulating macrophage activation and organ injury during sepsis remains unclear. Our aim was to examine the effects of Grail on macrophage reactivity and organ injury in endotoxemic animals. Wild-type and Grail knockout mice were injected with vehicle or Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide and observed for 24 h. Changes in blood pressure, heart rate, blood glucose, and biochemical variables were then examined. Moreover, levels of neutrophil infiltration, MMP-9, and caspase 3 were analyzed in the lungs of animals. The expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in J774A, RAW264.7, and primary peritoneal macrophages stimulated with LPS were also assessed in the presence or absence of Grail. Results indicated that loss of Grail expression enhances the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines in J774A, RAW264.7, and primary peritoneal macrophages treated with LPS. Furthermore, LPS-induced macrophage hyperactivation was alleviated by ectopic Grail overexpression. In vivo studies showed that Grail deficiency exacerbates organ damage in endotoxemic animals. Levels of neutrophil infiltration, MMP-9, and caspase 3 were significantly increased in the lungs of Grail-deficient endotoxemic mice. Thus, these results suggest that Grail contributes to the attenuation of hyperinflammation caused by activated macrophages and prevents organ damage in endotoxemic mice. We suggest that Grail signaling could be a therapeutic target for endotoxemia."
https://openalex.org/W2905942166,"The present study was performed to elucidate the roles of serum anti-Sm antibodies in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Highly purified peripheral blood monocytes obtained from healthy donors were cultured in the presence of monoclonal anti-Sm antibody (anti-Sm mAb), monoclonal anti-U1-RNP antibody (anti-RNP mAb) or control murine IgG1 or IgG3. After various periods of incubation, levels of IL-6 and TNF-α in the culture supernatants were measured by ELISA and the expression of mRNA for various molecules in monocytes was determined using RT-PCR. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed the bindings of anti-Sm mAb and anti-RNP mAb on viable human monocytes. Both anti-Sm mAb and anti-RNP mAb significantly increased the production of IL-6 and TNF-α of human monocytes in a dose-dependent manner, although the latter was more potent than the former. Of note, anti-Sm mAb synergistically enhanced the production and mRNA expression of IL-6 and TNF-α of human monocytes in the presence of anti-RNP mAb. Notably, anti-RNP mAb, but not anti-Sm mAb, significantly enhanced the mRNA expression of RelA in human monocytes. Finally, anti-Sm mAb still up-regulated the IL-6 production of monocytes in the presence of anti-RNP mAb under the influence of N-acetyl cysteine or pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate that totally abrogated the IL-6 production provoked by anti-Sm mAb alone in the absence of anti-RNP mAb. These results demonstrate that anti-Sm and anti-RNP antibodies synergistically up-regulate the expression of IL-6 and TNF-α in human monocytes. The data also suggest that the effect of anti-Sm in the synergy with anti-RNP might not involve NFkB activation."
https://openalex.org/W2906501955,"Aquatic microorganisms are an important part of aquatic ecosystems because they are involved in nutrient cycling and water quality, eventually influencing fish productivity. However, at present, reports on the effect of stocking density on microorganisms in sediment samples in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) are relatively rare. In this study, the changes in the microbial community in an RAS were investigated under different stocking densities of juvenile hybrid grouper (♀Epinephelus fuscoguttatus × ♂Epinephelus lanceolatus). Total DNA was extracted from the sediment samples, the 16S rDNA gene was amplified, and the bacterial community was analysed by Illumina high-throughput sequencing. We identified 741 OTUs from a total of 409,031 reads. Based on the analysis of bacterial composition, richness, diversity, bacterial 16S and rDNA gene abundance; sediment sample comparisons; and the existence of specific bacterial taxa within four densities, we concluded that the dominant phyla in all samples were similar and included: Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Nitrospirae, Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia, and Chloroflexi. However, their relative distributions differed at different fish densities. Linear discriminant analysis further indicated that the stocking treatment influenced the sediment bacterial community. This study indicates that under RAS aquaculture, mode density is a factor regulating the microbial community, which provides insights into microbe management in RAS culture."

ZIKV was first isolated in the blood of nonhuman primates in Africa and has been detected in the blood, saliva, and urine of a few catarrhine species in both Africa and Asia, suggesting that nonhuman primates may serve as both a source and a reservoir of the virus. The recent introduction of ZIKV to human populations in the Americas presents the potential for the virus to spread into nonhuman primate reservoirs. Thus, it is critical to develop efficient and noninvasive detection methods to monitor the spread of the virus in wild nonhuman primate populations. Here, we describe a method for ZIKV detection in noninvasively collected fecal samples of a Neotropical primate. Fecal samples were collected from two captive squirrel monkeys (Saimiri boliviensis boliviensis) that were experimentally infected with ZIKV (Strain Mexico_1_44) and an additional two uninfected squirrel monkeys. Nucleic acids were extracted from these samples, and RT-qPCR was used to assay for the presence of ZIKV using primers flanking a 101 bp region of the NS5 gene. In both ZIKV-inoculated animals, ZIKV was detected 5-11 days post-infection, but was not detected in the uninfected animals. We compare the fecal results to ZIKV detection in serum, saliva, and urine samples from the same individuals. Our results indicate that fecal detection is a cost-effective, noninvasive method for monitoring wild populations of Neotropical primates as possible ZIKV reservoirs."
https://openalex.org/W2906300236,"The following research was conducted to elucidate the evolution and expression of salmonid selenoprotein P (SelP), a selenoprotein that is unique in having multiple selenocysteine (Sec) residues, following supranutritional selenium supplementation and infection in rainbow trout. We show that in salmonids SelP is present as four paralogues and that the diversification of SelP genes during vertebrate evolution relates to whole genome duplication events. With 17 and 16 selenocysteine residues for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)/Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) SelPa1 and SelPa2 proteins respectively and 1 or 2 (trout or salmon) and 4 or 3 (trout or salmon) selenocysteine residues for salmonid SelPb1 and SelPb2 proteins respectively, this is the highest number of (predicted) multiple selenocysteine containing SelP proteins reported for any vertebrate species to date. To investigate the effects of selenium form on SelP expression we added different concentrations (1 nM- 10 μM) of organic or inorganic selenium to a trout cell line (RTG-2 cells) and analysed changes in mRNA abundance. We next studied the impact of supplementation on the potential modulation of these transcripts by PAMPs and proinflammatory cytokines in RTG-2 and RTS-11 cells. These experiments revealed that selenium type influenced the responses, and that SelP gene subfunctionalisation was apparent. To get an insight into the expression patterns in vivo we conducted a feeding trial with 2 diets differing in selenium content and 5 weeks later challenged the trout with a bacterial pathogen (Aeromonas salmonicida). Four tissues were analysed for SelP paralogue expression. The results show a significant induction of SelPa1 in gills and intestine following infection in selenium supplemented fish and for SelPa2 in gills. SelPb1 was significantly reduced in head kidney of both diet groups following infection, whilst SelPb2 was significantly upregulated in skin of both diet groups post infection. Overall these findings reveal differential expression profiles for the SelPa/SelPb paralogues in trout, influenced by selenium supply, cell type/tissue and stimulant. The increase of multiple Sec containing SelP proteins in salmonids could indicate an enhanced requirement for selenium in this lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2904483891,"This retrospective study evaluated the expression of β1 integrins and associated proteins as prognostic markers for primary radio(chemo)therapy outcome of patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Tissue microarrays were prepared from 224 HNSCC patients undergoing curative primary radio(chemo)therapy from 1996 to 2005. Staining intensities of β1 integrin and its downstream-proteins FAK, phosphorylated FAK as well as the β1 integrin ECM ligands fibronectin and collagen type-I were determined. Their association to the primary endpoint loco-regional control and the secondary endpoints overall survival and freedom from distant metastasis was analyzed by Cox regression. None of the considered molecular parameters showed a significant association with loco-regional control and freedom from distant metastasis. Patients with p16 positive tumors or tumors with a low intensity of fibronectin showed significantly higher overall survival in univariable regression. In multivariable regression including additional clinical parameters, however, these parameters were not significantly associated with overall survival. Our study in a HNSCC patient cohort treated with primary radio(chemo)therapy does not reveal a prognostic value of β1 integrin expression."
https://openalex.org/W2905662857,"When motor abilities change, people need to generate information to recalibrate their perception through active exploration. Most prior research has focused on observers' ability to update perception by executing experimenter-specified exploratory behaviors, however, the question of how observers spontaneously choose how to explore has been overlooked. We asked how effectively adults decide to explore when adapting to changes in their ability to squeeze through doorways. Results revealed that participants made efficient decisions about when to explore by approaching and practicing-they most often explored doorways that were near the limit of their abilities, and participants explored less often as their perceptual calibration improved. However, participants made sub-optimal decisions about how to explore, which resulted in a failure to fully recalibrate. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the processes of perceptual-motor recalibration that underlie real-world behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2905865423,"Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) plays an essential role in maintaining retinal function, and its defect is thought to be critically implicated in various ocular disorders. This study demonstrated that the matricellular protein CCN5 was down-regulated in ARPE-19 cells treated with the pro-fibrotic agent transforming growth factor (TGF)-β. A recombinant adenovirus expressing CCN5 (AdCCN5) was used to restore the level of CCN5 in these cells. AdCCN5 prevented TGF-β-induced fibrotic changes, including disruption of tight junctions, up-regulation of mesenchymal marker proteins, and down-regulation of epithelial marker proteins. In addition, AdCCN5 prevented TGF-β-induced functional defects, including increased migratory activity and reduced phagocytic activity. Notably, AdCCN5 reversed morphological and functional defects pre-established by TGF-β prior to viral infection. The CCN5 level was down-regulated in RPE of 18-month-old Ccl2-/- mice, which exhibited retinal defects. Restoration of the CCN5 level via intravitreal injection of a recombinant adeno-associated virus expressing CCN5 (AAV9-CCN5) normalized the altered expression of mesenchymal, epithelial, and functional marker proteins, as assessed by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Taken together, these data suggest that down-regulation of CCN5 is associated with fibrotic deformation of RPE under pathological conditions and that restoration of the CCN5 level effectively promotes recovery of deformed RPE."
https://openalex.org/W2905700334,"Rabies is an ancient and neglected zoonotic disease caused by the rabies virus, a neurotropic RNA virus that belongs to the Rhabdoviridae family, genus Lyssavirus. It remains an important public health problem as there are cost and health concerns imposed by the current human post exposure prophylaxis therapy. The use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is therefore an attractive alternative. Rabies mostly affects people that reside in resource-limited areas where there are occasional failures in the cold-chain. These environmental changes may upset the stability of the mAbs. This study focused on mAbs 62-71-3 and E559; their structures, responses to freeze/thaw (F/T) and exposure to reactive oxygen species were therefore studied with the aid of a wide range of biophysical and in silico techniques in order to elucidate their stability and identify aggregation prone regions. E559 was found to be less stable than 62-71-3. The complementarity determining regions (CDR) contributed the most to its instability, more specifically: peptides 99EIWD102 and 92ATSPYT97 found in CDR3, Trp33 found in CDR1 and the oxidised Met34. The constant region ""158SWNSGALTGHTFPAVL175"" was also flagged by the special aggregation propensity (SAP) tool and F/T experiments to be highly prone to aggregation. The E559 peptides ""4LQESGSVL11 from the heavy chain and 4LTQSPSSL11 from the light chain, were also highly affected by F/T. These residues may serve as good candidates for mutation, in the aim to bring forward more stable therapeutic antibodies, thus paving a way to a more safe and efficacious antibody-based cocktail treatment against rabies."
https://openalex.org/W2905881765,"Scrapie is a naturally occurring transmissible spongiform encephalopathy of sheep and goats. This fatal neurodegenerative disease is caused by misfolding of the cellular prion protein to pathogenic β-rich conformers (PrPSc) that accumulate in higher order structures of the brain and other tissues. This conversion has been used for in vitro assays including serial protein misfolding amplification and real-time quaking induced conversion (RT-QuIC). RT-QuIC can be used for the detection of prions and for strain discrimination in a variety of biological tissues from humans and animals. In this study, we evaluated how PrPSc isolated from sheep of different genotypes after inoculation with the scrapie agent influence the fibril formation in vitro using RT-QuIC. We found that reaction mixtures seeded with PrPSc from genotype VRQ/VRQ sheep brains have better conversion efficiency with 132M elk substrate compared to reactions seeded with PrPSc from the brains of sheep with the ARQ/ARQ genotype no matter which strain of scrapie was used to seed the reactions. We also inoculated transgenic mice expressing 132M elk PRNP (Tg12) with the scrapie agent from different genotypes of sheep to compare with our RT-QuIC results. The bioassays support the data showing a significantly shorter incubation period for inoculum from VRQ/VRQ sheep when compared to inoculum from ARQ/ARQ sheep. Thus, we conclude that the genotype of both source and recipient can strongly influence transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2906323567,"Whether inpatient services can be successfully substituted by office-based services has been debated for many decades, but the evidence is still inconclusive. This study aims to investigate the effect of office-based care on use and the expenditure for other healthcare services in patients with type II diabetes (T2D).A generalized propensity score matching approach was used on pooled Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data for 2000-2012 to explore a dose-response effect. Patients were matched by using a comprehensive set of variables selected following a standard model on access to care.Office-based care (up to 5 visits/year) acts as a substitute for other healthcare services and is associated with lower use and expenditure for inpatient, outpatient and emergency care. After five visits, office-based care becomes a complement to other services and is associated with increases in expenditure for T2D. Above 20 to 26 visits per year, depending on the healthcare service under consideration, the marginal effect of an additional office-based visit becomes non-statistically significant.Office-based visits appear to be an effective instrument to reduce use of inpatient care and other services, including outpatient and emergency-care, in patients with T2D without any increase in total healthcare expenditure."
https://openalex.org/W2905083458,"The replicability crisis in psychology demands direct replications to test the reliability of relevant phenomena. Prime-to-behavior effects have been an area under intense scrutiny given its surprising results. However, intuitive unsurprising effects have been mostly neglected, while they may lack robustness as well. In the present study, we focused on an intuitive prime-to-behavior effect in which Kay and Ross (2003) used a 2x2 design to test cooperation/competition priming crossed with an explicit/non-explicit construal of a Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD). They found a stronger assimilation effect of priming when the situational construal anteceded the decision, but we could not reproduce their findings in the present close replication, despite counting on higher power. Even with limitations due to the unavailability of original materials, this replication presents evidence that questions the existence of the original finding, and highlights the need for further replications to get a deeper understanding of the hypothesized effect.

https://openalex.org/W2905784143,"In human and animal auditory perception the perceived quality of sound streams changes depending on the duration of inter-sound intervals (ISIs). Here, we studied whether adaptation and the precision of temporal coding in the auditory periphery reproduce general perceptual boundaries in the time domain near 20, 100, and 400 ms ISIs, the physiological origin of which are unknown. In four experiments, we recorded auditory brainstem responses with five wave peaks (P1 -P5) in response to acoustic models of communication calls of house mice, who perceived these calls with the mentioned boundaries. The newly introduced measure of average standard deviations of wave latencies of individual animals indicate the waves' temporal precision (latency jitter) mostly in the range of 30-100 μs, very similar to latency jitter of single neurons. Adaptation effects of response latencies and latency jitter were measured for ISIs of 10-1000 ms. Adaptation decreased with increasing ISI duration following exponential or linear (on a logarithmic scale) functions in the range of up to about 200 ms ISIs. Adaptation effects were specific for each processing level in the auditory system. The perceptual boundaries near 20-30 and 100 ms ISIs were reflected in significant adaptation of latencies together with increases of latency jitter at P2-P5 for ISIs < ~30 ms and at P5 for ISIs < ~100 ms, respectively. Adaptation effects occurred when frequencies in a sound stream were within the same critical band. Ongoing low-frequency components/formants in a sound enhanced (decrease of latencies) coding of high-frequency components/formants when the frequencies concerned different critical bands. The results are discussed in the context of coding multi-harmonic sounds and stop-consonants-vowel pairs in the auditory brainstem. Furthermore, latency data at P1 (cochlea level) offer a reasonable value for the base-to-apex cochlear travel time in the mouse (0.342 ms) that has not been determined experimentally."
https://openalex.org/W2905779565,"Even though the coronary reperfusion process is the most important tool to preserve cardiac function, after myocardial infarction, reperfusion of acutely ischemic myocardium can induce injury. We aimed to evaluate the functional and molecular aspects 4 weeks after myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (IR) in rats. Male Wistar rats (N = 47) were subjected to myocardial IR by short-term (30 min) ligation and subsequent reperfusion of the left descending coronary artery. Control rats (N = 7) underwent the same surgical maneuver without coronary ligation. After 4 weeks, rats had their cardiac function examined by ventricular pressure recording under basal condition or pharmacological stress. Myocardial fibrosis and molecular mediators of IR injury (reactive oxygen species, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and matrix-metalloproteinase-2) were assessed as well. Most of the rats subjected to IR did not show macroscopic signs of infarct, while only 17% of these animals showed large myocardial infarction scars. Of note, all animals submitted to IR presented the functional and molecular parameters altered when compared with the control subjects. Cardiac function was attenuated in all animals submitted to IR, regardless the presence or size of macroscopic cardiac scars. Interstitial fibrosis, matrix-metalloproteinase-2 activity and the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha were higher in the myocardium of all IR rats as compared to the control subjects (p<0.05). Myocardium superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide were increased in rats without or with mild cardiac scars. These results show that IR leads to myocardial injury in rats. Besides, even the animals with an apparent healthy myocardium (without infarct scar) presented cardiac dysfunction and molecular changes that may contribute to the development of heart failure over time."
https://openalex.org/W2951758328,"Recently, sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) has been used as a safe and efficient method for the treatment of and immunization against asthma and various allergies. However, the routes of antigen/allergen (particulate antigen) uptake through the mucosa of the oral cavity remain incompletely understood, as do the roles of sex and age in the process. For this purpose, to elucidate the mechanism and efficacy of SLIT among different sexes and ages, microbeads were dripped into the sublingual region to mimic particulate antigen uptake by the sublingual mucosa.Twenty microliters of either phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or fluorescently labelled microbeads (latex and silica beads) were placed under the tongue of both male and female C57BL/6 mice at young (3 months) and old (6 months) ages. The lower jaw was examined 30 min after administration, and beads were detected with a fluorescence stereomicroscope. Morphological observations of the mucosa of the fluorescent areas were made with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and an all-in-one light fluorescence microscope (LM). Fluorescence intensity was compared between both sexes and ages.Stereomicroscopic observation revealed fluorescent illuminations in three compartments of the sublingual mucosa: the sublingual caruncles (SC), the oral rostral mucosa (OR) and the buccal mucosa (BM). Interestingly, the fluorescence intensity tended to be higher among females than among males in the SC region in particular. However, there were no significant age-related differences. SEM and LM revealed beads in the lumina of both mandibular ducts and sublingual ducts (Sd). Additionally, the apical cytoplasm of some Sd cells contained silica beads. However, there was no specification in the OR mucosa or BM.This study reveals the major role Sd plays in local immunity via the antigen uptake mechanisms. Furthermore, our data suggest that the efficacy of SLIT in humans could be affected by sex."
