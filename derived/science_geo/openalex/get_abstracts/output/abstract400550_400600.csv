https://openalex.org/W2012203722,"We have undertaken a genome-wide analysis of rare copy-number variation (CNV) in 1124 autism spectrum disorder (ASD) families, each comprised of a single proband, unaffected parents, and, in most kindreds, an unaffected sibling. We find significant association of ASD with de novo duplications of 7q11.23, where the reciprocal deletion causes Williams-Beuren syndrome, characterized by a highly social personality. We identify rare recurrent de novo CNVs at five additional regions, including 16p13.2 (encompassing genes USP7 and C16orf72) and Cadherin 13, and implement a rigorous approach to evaluating the statistical significance of these observations. Overall, large de novo CNVs, particularly those encompassing multiple genes, confer substantial risks (OR = 5.6; CI = 2.6-12.0, p = 2.4 × 10(-7)). We estimate there are 130-234 ASD-related CNV regions in the human genome and present compelling evidence, based on cumulative data, for association of rare de novo events at 7q11.23, 15q11.2-13.1, 16p11.2, and Neurexin 1."
https://openalex.org/W1998939463,"Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons are not homogeneous but differ in their molecular properties and responses to external stimuli. We examined whether the modulation of excitatory synapses on DA neurons by rewarding or aversive stimuli depends on the brain area to which these DA neurons project. We identified DA neuron subpopulations in slices after injection of ""Retrobeads"" into single target areas of adult mice and found differences in basal synaptic properties. Administration of cocaine selectively modified excitatory synapses on DA cells projecting to nucleus accumbens (NAc) medial shell while an aversive stimulus selectively modified synapses on DA cells projecting to medial prefrontal cortex. In contrast, synapses on DA neurons projecting to NAc lateral shell were modified by both rewarding and aversive stimuli, which presumably reflects saliency. These results suggest that the mesocorticolimbic DA system may be comprised of three anatomically distinct circuits, each modified by distinct aspects of motivationally relevant stimuli."

In this study, we develop a method for network-based analysis of genetic associations (NETBAG). We use NETBAG to identify a large biological network of genes affected by rare de novo CNVs in autism. The genes forming the network are primarily related to synapse development, axon targeting, and neuron motility. The identified network is strongly related to genes previously implicated in autism and intellectual disability phenotypes. Our results are also consistent with the hypothesis that significantly stronger functional perturbations are required to trigger the autistic phenotype in females compared to males. Overall, the presented analysis of de novo variants supports the hypothesis that perturbed synaptogenesis is at the heart of autism. More generally, our study provides proof of the principle that networks underlying complex human phenotypes can be identified by a network-based functional analysis of rare genetic variants.

Singleton A. Genomewide association studies and human disease.N. Engl. J. Med. 2009; 360: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Although these studies have successfully identified hundreds of significant associations, common polymorphisms reaching genome-wide significance usually explain a relatively small fraction of disease heritability (Goldstein, 2009Goldstein D.B. Common genetic variation and human traits.N. Engl. J. Med. 2009; 360: 1696-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). There is a growing consensus in genetics that the most valuable contribution of GWAS studies will be in the identification of functional pathways underlying the observed phenotypes (Hirschhorn, 2009Hirschhorn J.N. Genomewide association studies—illuminating biologic pathways.N. Engl. J. Med. 2009; 360: 1699-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In addition, it is likely that a significant fraction of so-called missing heritability (Manolio et al., 2009Manolio T.A. Collins F.S. Cox N.J. Goldstein D.B. Hindorff L.A. Hunter D.J. McCarthy M.I.

Chakravarti A. et al.Finding the missing heritability of complex diseases.Nature. 2009; 461: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (5379) Google Scholar), which has eluded association studies, is accounted for by rare single nucleotide mutations and structural genomic variations (McClellan and King, 2010McClellan J. King M.C. Genetic heterogeneity in human disease.Cell. 2010; 141: 210-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). A notable example of a disease with a very complex allelic architecture is autism—one of the most common neurological disorders (Geschwind, 2008Geschwind D.H. Autism: many genes, common pathways?.Cell. 2008; 135: 391-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Autism spectrum disorders are characterized by impaired social interactions, abnormal verbal communication, restricted interests, and repetitive behaviors. Due in part to better detection strategies, the combined prevalence of ASD has been steadily increasing for several decades and is now approaching a staggering 1% in the human population. Although autism has a very strong genetic component, with an estimated heritability as high as 90% based on studies of monozygotic twins (Hyman, 2008Hyman S.E. A glimmer of light for neuropsychiatric disorders.Nature. 2008; 455: 890-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), GWAS-based searches have implicated only a few genes that are associated with common polymorphisms reaching genome-wide significance (Wang et al., 2009Wang K. Zhang H. Ma D. Bucan M. Glessner J.T. Abrahams B.S. Salyakina D. Imielinski M. Bradfield J.P.

In addition, the agreement between published findings remains poor (Manolio et al., 2009Manolio T.A. Collins F.S. Cox N.J. Goldstein D.B. Hindorff L.A. Hunter D.J. McCarthy M.I. Ramos E.M.

Importantly, there is growing evidence that rare sequence mutations and de novo copy number variations (CNVs) (Marshall et al., 2008Marshall C.R. Noor A. Vincent J.B. Lionel A.C. Feuk L. Skaug J.

USA. 2007; 104: 12831-12836Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The main challenge in the analysis of rare genetic variations, such as de novo CNVs, is precisely their rarity, i.e., the fact that a vast majority of the observed genetic events are unique. Consequently, each rare variant by itself is not statistically significant, so an integrative conceptual framework is required to understand their overall functional impact. We hypothesized that recently obtained genome-wide de novo CNV data (Levy et al., 2011Levy D. Ronemus M. Yamrom B. Yoon-ha L. Leotta A. Kendall J. Marks S. Lakshmi B. Pai D. Ye K. et al.Rare de novo and transmitted copy-number variation in autistic spectrum disorders.Neuron. 2011; 70 (this issue): 886-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) could allow identification of the underlying biological pathways and processes if considered in the context of functional biological networks (Feldman et al., 2008Feldman I. Rzhetsky A. Vitkup D. Network properties of genes harboring inherited disease mutations.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 4323-4328Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, Iossifov et al., 2008Iossifov I. Zheng T. Baron M. Gilliam T.C. Rzhetsky A. Genetic-linkage mapping of complex hereditary disorders to a whole-genome molecular-interaction network.Genome Res. 2008; 18: 1150-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Here, we develop a method for network-based analysis of genetic associations (NETBAG) and demonstrate its utility in autism. The presented approach can determine whether the observed rare events en masse affect a significantly interconnected functional network of human genes. To implement our approach, we first built a background network that connects any pair of human genes with a weighted edge encapsulating our a priori expectation that the two genes participate in the same genetic phenotype (see Experimental Procedures and Supplemental Experimental Procedures). This background network was based on a combination of various functional descriptors, such as shared gene ontology (GO) annotations (Ashburner et al., 2000Ashburner M. Ball C.A. Blake J.A. Botstein D. Butler H. Cherry J.M. Davis A.P. Dolinski K. Dwight S.S. Eppig J.T. et al.The Gene Ontology ConsortiumGene ontology: tool for the unification of biology.Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (23524) Google Scholar), functional pathways in KEGG (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000Kanehisa M. Goto S. KEGG: kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (13663) Google Scholar), shared interaction partners and coevolutionary patterns (see Experimental Procedures). Similar methods have been previously used to build functional networks in humans and several model organisms (Lee et al., 2004Lee I. Date S.V. Adai A.T. Marcotte E.M. A probabilistic functional network of yeast genes.Science. 2004; 306: 1555-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, Lee et al., 2008Lee I. Lehner B. Crombie C. Wong W. Fraser A.G. Marcotte E.M. A single gene network accurately predicts phenotypic effects of gene perturbation in Caenorhabditis elegans.Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In contrast to the aforementioned studies, edges in our network represent the likelihood that two genes participate in a similar genetic phenotype rather than necessarily share cellular functions. Importantly, no deliberate biases toward genes previously implicated in autism or biological functions related to nervous system were used in building the network. The likelihood network was assembled using a large set of known disease-gene associations that were carefully curated for our previous study (Feldman et al., 2008Feldman I. Rzhetsky A. Vitkup D. Network properties of genes harboring inherited disease mutations.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 4323-4328Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). This set contains 476 genes associated with 132 different genetic diseases (see Experimental Procedures). Using the constructed network, we searched for functionally connected clusters of human genes affected by de novo CNVs (Figure 1). The genes within the observed CNV regions were first mapped to the nodes corresponding to these genes in the network (Figure 1B). Clusters of genes were assigned scores based on the strength of their connections, and a greedy search algorithm (see Experimental Procedures) was then used to find high-scoring clusters of genes within the CNV regions (Figure 1C). In this search procedure genes from any CNV region could be selected to be members of the growing cluster (Figure 1C), but to prevent large CNV regions from dominating clusters, we allowed no more than one or two genes from a given CNV to participate in a cluster (Figures 2A and 2B , respectively).Figure 2Gene Clusters Found using NETBAG Analysis of De Novo CNV Regions Observed in Autistic IndividualsShow full caption(A) The highest scoring cluster obtained using the search procedure with up to one gene per each CNV region.(B) The cluster obtained using the search with up to two genes per region. In the figure, genes (nodes) with known functions in the brain and nervous systems are colored in orange (see Table S2 for functional information about the genes forming the cluster). Node sizes represent the importance of each gene to the overall cluster score. Edge widths are proportional to the prior likelihood that the two corresponding genes contribute to a shared genetic phenotype. For clarity, we show only edges corresponding to the two strongest connections for at least one node.See also Figure S2, Table S1, and Table S2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) The highest scoring cluster obtained using the search procedure with up to one gene per each CNV region.

In the figure, genes (nodes) with known functions in the brain and nervous systems are colored in orange (see Table S2 for functional information about the genes forming the cluster). Node sizes represent the importance of each gene to the overall cluster score. Edge widths are proportional to the prior likelihood that the two corresponding genes contribute to a shared genetic phenotype. For clarity, we show only edges corresponding to the two strongest connections for at least one node. See also Figure S2, Table S1, and Table S2. A gene cluster was scored by considering the sum of log likelihood-based edges between all genes within the cluster. Such a scoring scheme is conceptually equivalent to calculating the expected likelihood that all genes within the cluster will participate in the same genetic phenotype. To account for the fact that functional interactions between genes in a cluster are not independent, we employed a previously developed de-weighting heuristic (Lee et al., 2004Lee I. Date S.V. Adai A.T. Marcotte E.M. A probabilistic functional network of yeast genes.Science. 2004; 306: 1555-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) described in the Experimental Procedures; similar results were obtained with or without the deweighting procedure (see Table S1). To calculate the p value for the resulting clusters, random events were generated with the same gene count or alternatively with the same genomic length, as in the observed de novo CNV dataset. The greedy algorithm was then applied to search for high-scoring clusters formed by genes from these random events. p values were assigned to clusters based on the distribution of scores in the randomized data clusters (see Experimental Procedures). We and others have previously used various network-based methods to analyze genetic data from rare and common diseases (Feldman et al., 2008Feldman I. Rzhetsky A. Vitkup D.

NETBAG differs from the previous approaches in several important ways. Specifically, the underlying weighted network does not represent a molecular interaction network or a set of predefined functional pathways, but instead the prior likelihood that any pair of human genes is involved in the same genetic phenotype. NETBAG then defines a formal procedure for identifying strongly connected clusters among a large set of genetically perturbed genes and evaluating the genome-wide cluster significance. The relative importance of specific genes forming a cluster is then evaluated based on the contribution of genes to the overall cluster score. We are currently working on making the NETBAG method available as a web server; in the meantime, we will be happy to share the developed methodology with any interested parties. The NETBAG approach was directly applied to the experimental CNV dataset described in the companion paper by Levy et al., 2011Levy D. Ronemus M. Yamrom B. Yoon-ha L. Leotta A. Kendall J. Marks S. Lakshmi B. Pai D. Ye K. et al.Rare de novo and transmitted copy-number variation in autistic spectrum disorders.Neuron. 2011; 70 (this issue): 886-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar; this issue of Neuron). This set contained 75 rare de novo CNVs encompassing 746 unique human genes. For our analysis, we combined all overlapping events into a single region and removed all events that did not intersect any genes; we also removed six very large CNV events (length >5 mb). As a result, the final set used for our analysis contained 47 CNV regions from affected individuals intersecting 433 genes. In addition, Levy et al., 2011Levy D. Ronemus M. Yamrom B. Yoon-ha L. Leotta A. Kendall J. Marks S. Lakshmi B. Pai D. Ye K. et al.Rare de novo and transmitted copy-number variation in autistic spectrum disorders.Neuron. 2011; 70 (this issue): 886-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar also identified ultrarare CNVs inherited by autistic subjects but not their siblings; inherited CNVs were classified as ultrarare if at least one of the corresponding genes was not affected by any other event from the study. Applying the same preprocessing procedure resulted in 156 CNV regions with 419 genes associated with rare inherited events in autistic children. Using the data described above, we identified statistically significant gene clusters affected by de novo CNV events associated with autistic individuals. Significant clusters detected using either one-gene-per-CNV (p value = 0.02) or the two-genes-per-CNV (p value = 0.02) clustering are shown in Figure 2. If genes forming the high scoring clusters were masked, no other significant clusters were detected in the data. In contrast, no statistically significant clusters were obtained using ultrarare inherited CNVs from affected individuals (the best cluster p value = 0.6) The absence of a significant cluster in the ultrarare inherited data set, which had a comparable number of genes to the de novo events, suggests that the inherited CNVs contain a significantly smaller fraction of casual genes, i.e., genes associated with autistic phenotype. This conclusion is also supported by the observation by Levy et al., 2011Levy D. Ronemus M. Yamrom B. Yoon-ha L. Leotta A. Kendall J. Marks S. Lakshmi B. Pai D. Ye K. et al.Rare de novo and transmitted copy-number variation in autistic spectrum disorders.Neuron. 2011; 70 (this issue): 886-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar that there is less bias in transmission of ultrarare inherited events. In other words, autistic children were almost as likely as their unaffected siblings to inherit an ultrarare event. This is in sharp contrast to the de novo events, which were nearly four times more frequent in the autistic children (7.9% in autistic children versus 2.0% in unaffected siblings). The contribution of each gene to the cluster score, i.e., its functional connection to other cluster genes, is not uniform. To capture each gene's contribution to the cluster score we performed Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations, sampling clusters based on their scores. The size of each gene (node) in Figure 2 is proportional to the each gene's membership in high-scoring clusters during the sampling simulations (see Experimental Procedures, Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Similar node sizes were also obtained based on the average connection strength from each gene to the other genes in the cluster (Pearson's r = 0.8, p value = 4∗10−11). Interestingly, we found that genes affected by de novo CNVs observed in females are significantly more important for the overall cluster score than genes affected by CNVs in males, i.e., female genes have stronger average connections with other genes from the identified network (see Figure S2; one-tail Mann-Whitney test, female > male, p value = 0.013). This observation is illuminating because one of the striking phenotypic characteristics of autism is the male-to-female incidence ratio of more than 5:1 for high-functioning ASD (Newschaffer et al., 2007Newschaffer C.J. Croen L.A. Daniels J. Giarelli E. Grether J.K. Levy S.E. Mandell D.S. Miller L.A. Pinto-Martin J. Reaven J. et al.The epidemiology of autism spectrum disorders.Annu. Rev. Public Health. 2007; 28: 235-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). It has been previously suggested (Zhao et al., 2007Zhao X. Leotta A. Kustanovich V. Lajonchere C. Geschwind D.H. Law K. Law P. Qiu S. Lord C. Sebat J. et al.A unified genetic theory for sporadic and inherited autism.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 12831-12836Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) that stronger genetic perturbations are required, on average, to trigger an autistic phenotype in females than males due to currently unknown compensatory mechanisms. Two mechanisms may lead to stronger perturbations in females: CNVs encompassing a larger number of genes that are associated with ASD and CNVs intersecting individual genes that produce a more deleterious impact when disrupted. The analysis of de novo events in affected individuals lends support to both of these mechanisms: the CNVs in females are indeed significantly larger (with median of 10 genes per CNV in females, three genes per CNV in males, two-tail Mann Whitney, p value = 0.02), and genes derived from female CNVs are more functionally important for the network shown in Figure 2. Using simulations of random CNVs we also confirmed that the difference in the relative importance of female versus male nodes is unlikely (p = 0.024) to be a simple consequence of the larger CNV sizes in females (see Supplemental Information; Figure S2C). We believe that both of the aforementioned mechanisms are at play. Indeed, it would be surprising that stronger perturbation can be inflicted exclusively by larger CNVs and not disruption of high impact genes, and vice versa. Analysis of the established annotation resources, such as Swiss-Prot (UniProt Consortium, 2007UniProt ConsortiumThe Universal Protein Resource (UniProt).Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: D193-D197Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), GeneCards (www.genecards.org), WikiGenes (www.wikigenes.org), and IHOP (Hoffmann and Valencia, 2004Hoffmann R. Valencia A. A gene network for navigating the literature.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 664Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), suggests that a significant fraction of genes in the identified network either play a well-defined functional role in the brain or have been previously implicated in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Only ∼25% (54 of a randomly selected 214) of all genes within the de novo CNV regions have been previously associated with brain-related phenotypes. However, when we consider genes in the identified clusters this proportion rises drastically (p value < 10−3), to ∼67% (Figure 2A; 30 out of 45) for the one-gene-per-CNV cluster or ∼52% (Figure 2B; 38 out of 72) for the two-genes-per-CNV cluster (see Table S2 for functional description of cluster genes). To characterize in more detail the specific biological processes related to the cluster in Figure 2A, we investigated the strength of functional interactions between the cluster genes and various gene ontology (GO) categories (Ashburner et al., 2000Ashburner M. Ball C.A. Blake J.A. Botstein D. Butler H. Cherry J.M. Davis A.P. Dolinski K. Dwight S.S. Eppig J.T. et al.The Gene Ontology ConsortiumGene ontology: tool for the unification of biology.Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (23524) Google Scholar). GO categories represent a curated set of functionally related genes described by a controlled vocabulary. For human genes in each of 1454 GO categories we calculated their average log likelihood interaction score (using the background network) with the genes in the identified cluster (Figure 2). The GO-specific significance of these interaction scores was calculated by comparison with scores of randomly generated CNV events with the same gene count at in real data by Levy et al., 2011Levy D. Ronemus M. Yamrom B. Yoon-ha L. Leotta A. Kendall J. Marks S. Lakshmi B. Pai D. Ye K. et al.Rare de novo and transmitted copy-number variation in autistic spectrum disorders.Neuron. 2011; 70 (this issue): 886-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar. A false discovery rate (FDR) procedure was used to correct for multiple hypothesis testing (see Experimental Procedures). The 25 GO categories with lowest Q values, indicating the highest connection significance to the autism associated cluster, are shown in Table 1 (see Table S3 for other significant GO categories). These GO categories are primarily related to actin network dynamics and reorganization, synaptogenesis, axonogenesis, cell-cell adhesion, small GTPase signaling, and neurite development. Consequently, the identified functional network is associated with a diverse collection of molecular and cellular processes essential for proper synaptogenesis and axon guidance.

For example, synaptic transmission was reported to be completely normal in synaptophysin knockout mice; however, direct experiments to monitor the synaptic vesicle cycle have not been carried out. Here, using optical imaging and electrophysiological experiments, we demonstrate that synaptophysin is required for kinetically efficient endocytosis of synaptic vesicles in cultured hippocampal neurons. Truncation analysis revealed that distinct structural elements of synaptophysin differentially regulate vesicle retrieval during and after stimulation. Thus, synaptophysin regulates at least two phases of endocytosis to ensure vesicle availability during and after sustained neuronal activity.

Thus, synaptophysin regulates at least two phases of endocytosis to ensure vesicle availability during and after sustained neuronal activity. Synaptophysin (syp) was the first synaptic vesicle (SV) protein to be cloned and characterized (Jahn et al., 1985Jahn R. Schiebler W. Ouimet C. Greengard P.

A synaptic vesicle protein with a novel cytoplasmic domain and four transmembrane regions.Science. 1987; 238: 1142-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Syp is the most abundant SV protein by mass, accounting for ∼10% of total vesicle protein (Takamori et al., 2006Takamori S. Holt M. Stenius K. Lemke E.A. Gronborg M. Riedel D. Urlaub H. Schenck S. Brugger B. Ringler P. et al.Molecular anatomy of a trafficking organelle.Cell. 2006; 127: 831-846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar). Each SV harbors ∼32 copies of syp, which is second only to synaptobrevin (8% of the total SV protein) at ∼70 copies per vesicle. Because syp is exclusively localized to SVs, it is widely used as a marker for presynaptic terminals. Structurally, syp spans the vesicle membrane four times with a short amino- and a long carboxy-terminal tail, both of which are exposed on the cytoplasmic surface of the SV membrane. In addition, there are two short intravesicular loops that contain disulfide bonds. Syp is N-glycosylated on the first intravesicular loop and is phosphorylated on the long cytoplasmic tail; the function of these posttranslational modifications remain unknown (Evans and Cousin, 2005Evans G.J.

There is evidence suggesting that syp, especially its four transmembrane domains, may promote formation of highly curved membranes as in small SVs (Leube, 1995Leube R.E. The topogenic fate of the polytopic transmembrane proteins, synaptophysin and connexin, is determined by their membrane-spanning domains.J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 883-894PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, ectopic expression of syp alone in nonneuronal cells leads to formation of small cytoplasmic vesicles (Leube et al., 1989Leube R.E. Wiedenmann B. Franke W.W.

A recent electron microscopy study revealed that syp forms hexameric structures that are similar to connexons (Arthur and Stowell, 2007Arthur C.P. Stowell M.H.

Previous molecular studies have hinted at a number of diverse roles for syp in synaptic function including exocytosis, synapse formation, biogenesis, and endocytosis of SVs (Cameron et al., 1991Cameron P.L.

Surprisingly, mice lacking syp were viable and had no overt phenotype (Evans and Cousin, 2005Evans G.J. Cousin M.A. Tyrosine phosphorylation of synaptophysin in synaptic vesicle recycling.Biochem.

Synaptic transmission, and the morphology or shape of SVs, were not altered in syp knockout (syp−/−) mice (Eshkind and Leube, 1995Eshkind L.G. Leube R.E. Mice lacking synaptophysin reproduce and form typical synaptic vesicles.Cell Tissue Res. 1995; 282: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, McMahon et al., 1996McMahon H.T. Bolshakov V.Y.

USA. 1996; 93: 4760-4764Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The lack of an obvious phenotype was attributed to redundant expression of syp isoforms such as synaptogyrin (syg) or synaptoporin. Consistent with this notion, mice lacking both syp and syg exhibited diminished long-term potentiation (Janz et al., 1999Janz R. Sudhof T.C. Hammer R.E. Unni V. Siegelbaum S.A. Bolshakov V.Y. Essential roles in synaptic plasticity for synaptogyrin I and synaptophysin I.Neuron. 1999; 24: 687-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, recent genetic screening in human subjects, and behavioral studies in mice, have implicated loss or truncation of syp in mental retardation and/or learning deficits (Schmitt et al., 2009Schmitt U. Tanimoto N. Seeliger M. Schaeffel F. Leube R.E.

These new results suggest that syp might play a subtle yet important role in regulating synaptic transmission in neuronal circuits involved in learning and memory. As alluded to above, it is not clear as to whether syp functions in the SV recycling pathway in central neurons. To test this notion directly, we performed a quantitative analysis of SV recycling in cultured neurons using optical and electrophysiological methods. We show that syp regulates the endocytosis of SVs both during and after sustained neuronal activity via distinct structural determinants. We further show that the observed defects in endocytosis, due to loss of syp, exacerbate synaptic depression and delay the replenishment of releasable SV pools. To determine whether syp functions in the SV recycling pathway, we directly monitored the trafficking of SV proteins tagged with the pH-sensitive GFP, pHluorin (Miesenbock et al., 1998Miesenbock G. De Angelis D.A. Rothman J.E. Visualizing secretion and synaptic transmission with pH-sensitive green fluorescent proteins.Nature. 1998; 394: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar, Sankaranarayanan and Ryan, 2000Sankaranarayanan S. Ryan T.A. Real-time measurements of vesicle-SNARE recycling in synapses of the central nervous system.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), in dissociated hippocampal neurons from syp knockout (syp−/−) mice. We used two different optical reporters, syt1-pH and SV2A-pH, in which a pHluorin was fused to the intraluminal domain of the SV membrane protein synaptotagmin 1 (syt1) or SV2A, respectively (Fernandez-Alfonso et al., 2006Fernandez-Alfonso T. Kwan R. Ryan T.A. Synaptic vesicles interchange their membrane proteins with a large surface reservoir during recycling.Neuron. 2006; 51: 179-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These reporters were expressed in neurons using lenti-virus. SV2A-pH is a novel reporter; its use in monitoring the SV cycle in cultured neurons was validated as shown in Figure S1 available online. In short, SV2A-pH is efficiently targeted to recycling SVs and its expression does not interfere with the normal SV recycling pathway (Figures S1A–S1D). We compared the kinetics of SV endocytosis after sustained stimulation in wild-type (WT) and syp−/− neurons. At rest, the fluorescence of syt1-pH remained quenched due to the low pH of the vesicle lumen (pH 5.5) (Figure 1C ). Exocytosis, evoked by delivering 300 stimuli (10 Hz), led to a rapid rise in fluorescence due to dequenching of the pHluorin signal upon exposure to the slightly alkaline extracellular solution (pH 7.4), followed by a slow decay due to subsequent endocytosis and reacidification of vesicles (Figures 1A and 1C). Average time constants (τ) of the poststimulus fluorescence decay were significantly greater in syp−/− versus WT neurons (τ = 18.6 ± 1.8 s for WT, τ = 29.6 ± 1.5 s for syp−/−) (Figures 1A and 1F), indicating slower SV endocytosis and/or reacidification. To distinguish between these possibilities, we measured the time course of vesicle reacidification and found that the rates were identical in WT (τ = 3.13 ± 1.2 s) versus syp−/− neurons (τ = 3.31 ± 1.2 s) (Figure S1E); these time constants are in agreement with previous studies using cultured neurons (Atluri and Ryan, 2006Atluri P.P. Ryan T.A. The kinetics of synaptic vesicle reacidification at hippocampal nerve terminals.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2313-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The slow poststimulus endocytosis in syp−/− neurons was confirmed using SV2A-pH (τ = 19.8 ± 0.5 s in WT, τ = 30.6 ± 1.1 s in syp−/−) (Figures 1B and 1F). Direct comparison of these endocytic time constants is valid because the two genotypes have total recycling SV pools of the same size (Figures S1F and S1G). The observed defect in the rate of endocytosis was rescued by expressing wild-type synaptophysin (wt-syp) in syp−/− neurons (τ = 20.4 ± 0.9 s in syp−/−; wt-syp) (Figures 1D and 1F). Interestingly, when a weaker stimulation protocol was used (50 pulses, 10 Hz), the time course of endocytosis was not significantly different between WT and syp−/− neurons (τ = 19.3 ± 0.4 s in WT, τ = 18.5 ± 0.3 s in syp−/−) (Figure 1E). Interpretation of this result is provided in the Discussion section. We performed FM1-43 uptake experiment to test whether SV membrane recycling, in addition to trafficking of cargo proteins, was altered by loss of syp (Figure 1G). WT and syp−/− neurons were stimulated in the absence of FM1-43 for 30 s at 10 Hz and, after a 30 s delay, were exposed to the FM dye for 3 min. Neurons were then washed for 10 min in Ca2+-free solution followed by two stimulus trains (900 pulses each at 10 Hz, 2 min rest between two trains) to drive maximal dye release from vesicles. Fluorescence changes (ΔF1) were measured from images acquired before and after the 900 pulse trains. Each measurement was normalized to a subsequent control run in which FM dye was applied at the onset of stimulus without a delay; this protocol allows labeling the total pool of SVs that undergo exo- and endocytosis during and after the 30 s stimulation, yielding ΔF2. We hypothesized that, in WT neurons, endocytosis would be largely complete within the 30 s delay, leaving few vesicles available for FM dye uptake (Figures 1A and 1B). However, in syp−/− neurons, endocytosis would still be taking place during and after the 30 s delay, resulting in a larger fraction of FM dye-labeled SVs. Indeed, syp−/− neurons internalized more dye than wild-type neurons (0.15 ± 0.01 in WT, 0.27 ± 0.01 in syp−/−), consistent with slower endocytosis observed using pHluorin (Figures 1H and 1I). Thus, we conclude that while syp is not essential for endocytosis per se, it is required for kinetically efficient SV retrieval after sustained stimulation. Recent evidence suggests that endocytosis that occurs during sustained stimulation might proceed through molecular mechanisms that are distinct from endocytosis that occurs after stimulation (Ferguson et al., 2007Ferguson S.M. Brasnjo G. Hayashi M. Wolfel M. Collesi C. Giovedi S. Raimondi A. Gong L.W. Ariel P.

Lee S.Y. Lucast L. Cremona O. Di Paolo G. De Camilli P. Ryan T.A. The dual phosphatase activity of synaptojanin1 is required for both efficient synaptic vesicle endocytosis and reavailability at nerve terminals.Neuron. 2007; 56: 1004-1018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). As shown above, syp regulates vesicle retrieval after sustained neuronal activity, so we then tested whether syp functions in endocytosis during stimulation. To this end, we took advantage of the vesicular ATPase blocker, bafilomycin (Baf) that inhibits the reacidification of SVs (Nicholson-Tomishima and Ryan, 2004Nicholson-Tomishima K. Ryan T.A. Kinetic efficiency of endocytosis at mammalian CNS synapses requires synaptotagmin I.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 16648-16652Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Neurons expressing SV2A-pH were stimulated at 10 Hz for 30 s in the absence of Baf, and after a 10 min rest, were stimulated again at 10 Hz for a longer time (120 s) in the presence of Baf (Figure 2A ). The difference in fluorescence intensity between the two rounds of stimulation reflects the magnitude of endocytosis that had occurred during stimulation (Figure 2B; “Endo”) (Nicholson-Tomishima and Ryan, 2004Nicholson-Tomishima K. Ryan T.A. Kinetic efficiency of endocytosis at mammalian CNS synapses requires synaptotagmin I.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 16648-16652Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We derived the time courses of vesicle retrieval during stimulation (labeled as “endocytosis” in Figure 2E) by calculating the difference between the upper (with Baf) and lower (without Baf) traces from each group in Figures 2B–2D. Figure 2E shows the progress of exocytosis and endocytosis during sustained stimulation for all groups. Endocytic rates were empirically estimated from the slope of the time courses (e.g., solid line for WT sample; Figure 2E) (Nicholson-Tomishima and Ryan, 2004Nicholson-Tomishima K. Ryan T.A. Kinetic efficiency of endocytosis at mammalian CNS synapses requires synaptotagmin I.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 16648-16652Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The endocytic rate was decreased by ∼4-fold in syp−/− (0.014 arbitrary units [AU] s−1 in WT, 0.0035 AU s−1 in syp−/−), and was partially rescued by expressing wt-syp in syp−/− neurons (0.0095 AU s−1 in syp−/−; wt-syp) (Figures 2E and 2F). We also quantified the extent of endocytosis (Endo) as a fraction of exocytosis (“Exo”) at the end of the train (t = 43 s). In syp−/− neurons, the extent of endocytosis (endo/exo) during sustained neuronal activity was significantly reduced as compared to WT neurons (0.35 ± 0.02 in WT, 0.10 ± 0.03 in syp−/−, p < 0.001); this defect was rescued by expressing wt-syp in syp−/− neurons (0.28 ± 0.03 in syp−/−; wt-syp) (Figure 2G). Time courses of exocytosis, estimated by fitting Baf-treated SV2A-pH traces with single exponential functions, were identical in all groups (τ = 31.0 ± 1.2 s in WT, τ = 32.3 ± 1.3 s in syp−/−, τ = 32.5 ± 1.8 s in syp−/−; wt-syp) (Figure 2H). Therefore, syp is required for efficient SV endocytosis during, as well as after, persistent neuronal activity. To understand how syp controls the two phases of SV endocytosis, we focused on the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail that contains putative phosphorylation sites consisting of nine repeats of tyrosine-glycine-proline/glutamine (YG(P/Q) (Sudhof et al., 1987Sudhof T.C. Lottspeich F. Greengard P. Mehl E. Jahn R. A synaptic vesicle protein with a novel cytoplasmic domain and four transmembrane regions.Science. 1987; 238: 1142-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). This tail region was reported to bind dynamin I, which is thought to mediate vesicle fission during endocytosis (Daly and Ziff, 2002Daly C. Ziff E.B. Ca2+-dependent formation of a dynamin-synaptophysin complex: potential role in synaptic vesicle endocytosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9010-9015Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, Ferguson et al., 2007Ferguson S.M. Brasnjo G. Hayashi M. Wolfel M. Collesi C. Giovedi S. Raimondi A. Gong L.W. Ariel P. Paradise S. et al.A selective activity-dependent requirement for dynamin 1 in synaptic vesicle endocytosis.Science. 2007; 316: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Moreover, injection of a C-terminal fragment of syp into the squid giant axon resulted in accelerated synaptic depression during prolonged stimulation (Daly et al., 2000Daly C. Sugimori M. Moreira J.E. Ziff E.B. Llinas R. Synaptophysin regulates clathrin-independent endocytosis of synaptic vesicles.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 6120-6125Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, Daly and Ziff, 2002Daly C. Ziff E.B. Ca2+-dependent formation of a dynamin-synaptophysin complex: potential role in synaptic vesicle endocytosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9010-9015Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To address the function of the C-terminal tail of syp, we expressed a mutant syp that lacks this segment (ΔC-syp, lacking amino acids 244–307 that harbor all of the nine YG(P/Q) repeats) in syp−/− neurons and analyzed the vesicle retrieval using SV2A-pH. Surprisingly, ΔC-syp rescued the slow poststimulus endocytosis in syp−/− neurons to almost the same level as the full-length protein (τ = 20.9 ± 0.7 s in syp−/−; ΔC-syp, τ = 20.4 ± 0.9 s in syp−/−; wt-syp) (Figure 3A ). We then examined vesicle retrieval during stimulation using the same protocol as in Figure 2A (Figure 3B). As compared to wt-syp, the truncation mutant syp failed to rescue defective endocytosis during neuronal activity in terms of rate (0.0095 AU s−1 in syp−/−; wt-syp, 0.0045 AU s−1 in syp−/−; ΔC-syp) (Figures 3C and 3D) and the relative magnitude of vesicle retrieval (0.28 ± 0.03 in syp−/−; wt-syp, 0.14 ± 0.03 in syp−/−; ΔC-syp) (Figures 3B and 3E). These results suggest that the C-terminal domain of syp is selectively required for the endocytosis that occurs during, but not after, cessation of sustained synaptic transmission. A previous study reported that the C-terminal tail is essential for internalization of syp in fibroblasts (Linstedt and Kelly, 1991Linstedt A.D. Kelly R.B. Endocytosis of the synaptic vesicle protein, synaptophysin, requires the COOH-terminal tail.J. Physiol. (Paris). 1991; 85: 90-96PubMed Google Scholar). We tested this notion using full-length pHluorin-tagged synaptophysin (fl sypHy) and the mutant sypHy (ΔC-sypHy) that lacks the same C-terminal segment (amino acids 244–307). ΔC sypHy fluorescence, at the end of the 10 Hz stimulation protocol (30 s), showed a punctate distribution that was indistinguishable from full-length sypHy, reflecting efficient targeting to SVs (Figure S2A). The poststimulus endocytic time-constant of ΔC sypHy (τ = 18.8 ± 0.8 s) was not significantly different from full-length sypHy (τ = 18.0 ± 0.8 s) (Figure S2B), indicating that the C-terminal tail of syp is not required for efficient internalization of syp after neuronal activity. Next, we tested whether trafficking of syp, during neuronal activity, was altered in ΔC sypHy using the same protocol as in Figure 2A. Interestingly, retrieval of ΔC sypHy during neuronal activity was significantly reduced (0.31 ± 0.02 for fl sypHy, 0.18 ± 0.04 for ΔC sypHy) and also became slower as compared to full-length sypHy (0.015 AU s−1 for fl sypHy, 0.010 AU s−1 for ΔC sypHy) (Figures S2C and S2D). Thus, these results further demonstrate that different motifs within syp are involved in controlling the endocytosis of SV that occurs during, versus after, sustained synaptic transmission, potentially by recruiting distinct ensembles of proteins for recycling. We investigated the physiological significance of the endocytic defects in syp−/− neurons by performing whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings in dissociated cortical neurons. We locally stimulated neurons by delivering electrical pulses to the cell body using a stimulating electrode and recorded evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) from the cell body of postsynaptic partners. This method has been used to examine the dynamics of SV pools in numerous studies (Chung et al., 2010Chung C. Barylko B. Leitz J. Liu X. Kavalali E.T. Acute dynamin inhibition dissects synaptic vesicle recycling pathways that drive spontaneous and evoked neurotransmission.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 1363-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, Ferguson et al., 2007Ferguson S.M. Brasnjo G. Hayashi M. Wolfel M. Collesi C. Giovedi S. Raimondi A. Gong L.W. Ariel P. Paradise S. et al.A selective activity-dependent requirement for dynamin 1 in synaptic vesicle endocytosis.Science. 2007; 316: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). We measured the amplitude and the kinetics of single IPSCs between wild-type and syp−/− neurons, and found that these parameters were not altered (Figures S3A and S3B). Short-term plasticity, measured by paired-pulse ratio, was unaltered in syp−/− neurons (Figures S3C and S3D). These results suggest that the absence of syp does not affect the neurotransmitter release probability, postsynaptic responses or short-term synaptic plasticity, consistent with a previous study (McMahon et al., 1996McMahon H.T. Bolshakov V.Y. Janz R. Hammer R.E. Siegelbaum S.A. Sudhof T.C. Synaptophysin, a major synaptic vesicle protein, is not essential for neurotransmitter release.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 4760-4764Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). We then tested whether syp plays a role in maintaining the recycling SV pool during sustained neuronal activity. To this end, we stimulated neurons by delivering a train of 100 pulses at 10 Hz and monitored the depression of IPSCs during the train. The difference between wild-type and syp−/− neurons emerged after 20 stimuli and became more pronounced at later time points; by the end of 100 stimuli, only very small IPSCs could be elicited in syp−/− neurons, indicating that there were few remaining vesicles ready to fuse (Figures 4A and 4B). The average steady-state amplitudes of the IPSCs, determined by averaging the last 10 responses, were as follows: 0.171 ± 0.04 (WT), 0.060 ± 0.01 (syp−/−). The pronounced synaptic depression observed in syp−/− neurons was completely rescued by expressing wt-syp (Figures 4C and 4D). In marked contrast, ΔC-syp failed to rescue the enhanced depletion in syp−/− neurons (Figures 4C and 4D). Together with findings described above (Figure 3), we conclude that the loss of C-terminal cytoplasmic domain leads to inefficient SV endocytosis and pronounced synaptic depression during sustained neuronal activity. We also measured the time course of recovery of the recycling SV pool. Neurons were stimulated at 10 Hz for 20 s to deplete vesicles, and after a brief pause, they were stimulated at 0.5 Hz to monitor regrowth of IPSCs (Figure 4E). Amplitudes of all responses were normalized to the first response during the train. Recovery from depletion was significantly slower in syp−/− neurons (Figures 4E and 4F). We note that the releasable vesicle pool was not completely depleted in wild-type neurons even with the most intense stimulation that we were able to use without compromising cell viability (200 APs, 10 Hz in 4 mM Ca2+). Nevertheless, recovery proceeds with a much steeper slope in wild-type (τ = 5.60 s), as compared to syp−/− neurons (τ = 12.8 s) (Figure 4F), consistent with results from pHluorin experiments shown above. The data reported here firmly establish a role for syp in facilitating rapid and efficient SV endocytosis in mammalian central neurons. syp−/− neurons exhibited defective SV endocytosis both during and after neuronal activity while exocytosis and the size of the total recycling pool of SVs were unaffected. Truncation of the C-terminal tail of syp led to slower endocytosis during neuronal activity, consistent with a previous study in which a tail fragment was injected into the squid giant axon (Daly et al., 2000Daly C. Sugimori M. Moreira J.E. Ziff E.B. Llinas R. Synaptophysin regulates clathrin-independent endocytosis of synaptic vesicles.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 6120-6125Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, the same truncation mutant had no effect on endocytosis after neuronal activity; hence, the two endocytic processes—one during stimulation and another that is employed after stimulation—are controlled by distinct domains of syp. The observed defects in SV endocytosis in syp−/− neurons result in functional consequences including the pronounced depletion and slower recovery of the recycling SV pool. The slow time constant of poststimulus endocytosis might seem to be at odds with the rapid divergence of the synaptic depression time course between wild-type and syp−/− neurons during sustained stimulation (Figures 4A and 4B). Such rapid depression observed in syp−/− neurons prompted us to test the possibility that rapid retrieval, or “kiss and run” endocytosis of vesicles, is affected in the absence of syp. We note that whether kiss-and-run/fast retrieval (within ∼1 s) is a common mode of endocytosis in hippocampal synapses remains the subject of debate (Balaji et al., 2008Balaji J. Armbruster M. Ryan T.A. Calcium control of endocytic capacity at a CNS synapse.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 6742-6749Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, Ertunc et al., 2007Ertunc M. Sara Y. Chung C. Atasoy D.

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the dominant mechanism of vesicle retrieval at hippocampal synapses.Neuron. 2006; 51: 773-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2009Zhang Q. Li Y. Tsien R.W. The dynamic control of kiss-and-run and vesicular reuse probed with single nanoparticles.Science. 2009; 323: 1448-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). We calculated the rate of vesicle retrieval that occurs during stimulation as a fraction of the total recycling pool (as determined by the maximal ΔF values in the Baf traces) (Figures 2E and 2F). For wild-type neurons, only ∼1.3% of total recycling pool appears to undergo endocytosis within 1 s; this result argues against the notion that the rapid retrieval (i.e., kiss-and-run) predominates during sustained transmission. Hence, these results indicate that the rapid divergence of the synaptic depression time course between wild-type and syp−/− neurons cannot be attributed to loss of putative rapid endocytosis. An alternative explanation for the pronounced synaptic depression in syp−/− neurons is that syp might regulate another relatively rapid step, such as the clearance of vesicle release sites (Neher, 2010Neher E. What is rate-limiting during sustained synaptic activity: vesicle supply or the availability of release sites.Front. Synaptic Neurosci. 2010; 2: 144Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Interactions between SNARE proteins on vesicular and target membranes need to be disrupted after exocytosis to allow vesicle recycling. Syp might facilitate this process by binding to synaptobrevin II and clearing it from active zones. The loss of syp might lead to a “traffic jam” of vesicular components at release sites and thereby contribute to synaptic depression during sustained activity. However, it is not known whether the clearance of release sites is a rate-limiting step in hippocampal synapses. Finally, we note that read-outs from pHluorin imaging experiments and physiological recordings might not be directly comparable with each other due to several technical differences. These include (imaging versus electrophysiology) different methods of stimulating neurons (field stimulation versus local stimulation) and differences in temporal resolution (“s” versus “ms”). Therefore, there are caveats regarding direct comparison of data from these two experimental approaches. We consider the following possibilities regarding how SV endocytosis can be affected in the absence of syp: (1), unitary endocytic events become slower, or (2), number of SVs that can be retrieved at the same time, i.e., “endocytic capacity” is reduced while endocytosis of individual SVs remains unaffected (Balaji et al., 2008Balaji J. Armbruster M. Ryan T.A. Calcium control of endocytic capacity at a CNS synapse.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 6742-6749Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Since we only measured the macroscopic time courses of vesicle retrieval, we cannot completely distinguish between these two possibilities. Nevertheless, the finding that compensatory vesicle retrieval in syp−/− became slower only after 300 stimuli argues the first scenario. Indeed, the rate of unitary endocytic events is reported to be largely invariant (Balaji et al., 2008Balaji J. Armbruster M. Ryan T.A. Calcium control of endocytic capacity at a CNS synapse.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 6742-6749Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Therefore, we propose that the role of syp is to maintain endocytic capacity in synapses. At the molecular level, syp may recruit or promote the assembly of endocytic components in order to maintain the number of available “endocytic machines” during and after sustained neuronal activity. It will be of interest to determine whether SV endocytosis is further affected in syp and synaptogyrin double knockout mice with impaired long-term potentiation, a neural substrate for learning and memory (Janz et al., 1999Janz R. Sudhof T.C. Hammer R.E. Unni V. Siegelbaum S.A. Bolshakov V.Y.

Future studies will also focus on the molecular mechanisms through which syp interacts with binding partners—e.g., synaptobrevin II, dynamin I, and adaptor protein-I—to control vesicle recycling (Daly and Ziff, 2002Daly C.

Given that syb II plays a role in vesicle endocytosis and that syp promotes vesicular localization of syb II, it is tempting to speculate that the function of syp in efficient SV endocytosis might involve a physical interaction with syb II (Deak et al., 2004Deak F.

Clostridium difficile is a spore-forming, Gram-positive, anaerobic bacterium and is the major cause of nosocomial antibiotic-associated diarrhea (1Kuipers E.J. Surawicz C.M. Lancet. 2008; 371: 1486-1488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The importance of this pathogen is highlighted by the recent increased incidence of C. difficile infection in the United States and many European countries (2Freeman J. Bauer M.P. Baines S.D.

Rev. 2005; 18: 247-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). However, other aspects of C. difficile virulence are poorly understood. In particular, little is known about the mechanisms of gastrointestinal colonization, an undoubtedly essential step in pathogenesis. Bacterial pathogens generally secrete a subset of proteins that mediate essential functions during pathogenesis such as adhesion to host tissues and modulation of the host immune response (6Finlay B.B. Falkow S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 136-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). The identity of such proteins and the mechanisms of secretion employed by C. difficile are currently a subject of active research, and several candidate proteins have been identified (see below). Exterior to a typical Gram-positive cell wall is the C. difficile S-layer, a paracrystalline proteinaceous array that surrounds the bacterium (7Kawata T. Takeoka A. Takumi K. Masuda K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1984; 24: 323-328Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The S-layer is composed of two proteins, the high molecular weight (HMW) 2The abbreviations used are: HMWhigh molecular weightLMWlow molecular weightSLPS-layer proteinCWPcell wall proteinATcanhydrotetracycline. and low molecular weight (LMW) S-layer proteins (SLPs), derived by post-translational extracellular cleavage of the precursor SlpA (8Calabi E. Ward S. Wren B. Paxton T. Panico M. Morris H. Dell A. Dougan G. Fairweather N. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1187-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Following cleavage, the HMW and LMW SLPs form a high affinity heterodimer, the basic subunit of the assembled S-layer (9Fagan R.P. Albesa-Jové D. Qazi O. Svergun D.I. Brown K.A. Fairweather N.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 71: 1308-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition to the S-layer, C. difficile also possesses a large family of noncovalently anchored cell wall proteins (CWPs) that are related to SlpA and are characterized by the presence of three Pfam04122 cell wall-binding motifs (10Fagan R.P.

Using antisense RNA and protein expression techniques, we demonstrate that C. difficile has two essential Sec systems, a housekeeping system and an accessory system, and we identify SlpA and several CWPs as the major substrates of the accessory system. All plasmids used in this study are described in Table 1; oligonucleotides are listed in supplemental Table S1. Escherichia coli strains were propagated in LB broth and on LB agar supplemented with antibiotics as appropriate: chloramphenicol (15 μg/ml), kanamycin (50 μg/ml), or carbenicillin (50 μg/ml). E. coli strain NovaBlue (Merck) was used as a recipient for all cloning procedures, and the donor strain CA434 (HB101 carrying R702) was used for conjugation of plasmids into C. difficile. C. difficile strain 630 (29Sebaihia M. Wren B.W. Mullany P. Fairweather N.F. Minton N. Stabler R. Thomson N.R. Roberts A.P. Cerdeño-Tárraga A.M. Wang H. Holden M.T. Wright A. Churcher C.

Anhydrotetracycline (ATc; 20–500 ng/ml) was used for induction of the Ptet promoter in the C. difficile expression vectors described below.TABLE 1Plasmids used in this studyPlasmidRelevant detailsRef. or sourcepCBR023Pcwp2 driving codon-optimized gusA gene in pUC19Ref. 15Emerson J.E.

Foster T.J. Plasmid. 2009; 61: 126-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) was adapted for use in C. difficile. The entire Ptet promoter was amplified from pRMC2 using oligonucleotides NF1320 and NF1321 and ligated as a blunt-ended fragment into pSTBlue-1, yielding pRPF135. Extraneous BamHI, XhoI, and KpnI sites were removed by sequential rounds of inverse PCR and ligation using NF1322 and NF1323 to generate pRPF139, followed by NF1334 and NF1335 to generate pRPF141. pCBR023 containing the constitutive Pcwp2 promoter driving a C. difficile codon-optimized gusA gene in a pUC19 backbone (15Emerson J.E. Reynolds C.B. Fagan R.P. Shaw H.A. Goulding D. Fairweather N.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 74: 541-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) was modified by inverse PCR with NF1326 and NF1328 to replace the EcoRI site between the promoter and gusA gene with a SacI site, yielding pRPF137. The Pcwp2 promoter was then excised from pRPF137 and replaced with the modified Ptet promoter on a KpnI-SacI fragment, yielding pRPF143. The Pcwp2-gusA and Ptet-gusA cassettes were subcloned as KpnI-BamHI fragments into the E. coli-C. difficile shuttle vector pMTL960 to produce plasmids pRPF144 and pRPF146, respectively. Two transcriptional terminators were added, one after the gusA gene and a second after the divergent tetR gene. The terminator that follows the slpA gene in C. difficile strain 630 was amplified using NF1437 and NF1438 and cloned as a BamHI-BstXI fragment downstream of the gusA gene in pRPF146, yielding pRPF177. The fdx terminator from Clostridium pasteurianum was reconstituted as two annealed oligonucleotides, NF1469 and NF1470, and cloned downstream of the tetR gene between NheI and KpnI, yielding plasmid pRPF185. This stabilized inducible expression plasmid was used for all further studies. secA2 was amplified from C. difficile strain 630 using oligonucleotides NF1234 and NF1235 and cloned as EcoRI-BamHI into pCBR023. The resulting plasmid was then modified by inverse PCR using NF1260 and NF1261 to introduce an N-terminal Strep-tag II (WSHPQFEKLE) after the initiation methionine and again using NF1327 and NF1328 to change the EcoRI site between Pcwp2 and secA2 to SacI. The resulting Pcwp2-secA2 cassette was subcloned into pMTL960 between KpnI and BamHI, yielding pRPF150. The K106R mutation was introduced by inverse PCR using NF1256 and NF1257, yielding pRPF151. WT secA2 and secA2(K106R) were subsequently subcloned (SacI-BamHI) into pRPF185, generating pRPF186 and pRPF187, respectively. secA1 was amplified from C. difficile strain 630 using oligonucleotides NF1511 and NF1513, and this product was used as a template for a second PCR with NF1512 and NF1513 to add an N-terminal Strep-tag II. The resulting product was cloned as a blunt fragment into pSTBlue-1. The K106R mutation was introduced by inverse PCR using NF1514 and NF1515. WT secA1 and secA1(K106R) were subcloned (SacI-BamHI) into pRPF185, generating pRPF193 and pRPF194, respectively. A 178-bp (NF1582 and NF1583) antisense fragment, spanning from the predicted transcription initiation site of secA1, was amplified from C. difficile strain 630 genomic DNA and cloned (SacI-BamHI) into pRPF185, yielding pRPF204. A 600-bp (NF1409 and NF1410) antisense fragment covering the first 300 bp of secA2 and 300 bp upstream of the gene was amplified from C. difficile strain 630 genomic DNA and cloned (SacI-BamHI) into pRPF146. The fdx transcriptional terminator from C. pasteurianum was added downstream of the tetR gene as described above, yielding plasmid pRPF195. C. difficile harboring pRPF195 or pRPF204 was grown to an absorbance at 600 nm (A600 nm) of 0.3–0.4, induced with 500 ng/ml ATc, and harvested 90 min later following stabilization with RNAprotect (Qiagen). RNA was purified using the FastRNA Pro Blue kit (BIO 101 Systems), followed by DNase treatment (TURBO DNA-free, Applied Biosystems) and a final cleanup step with the RNeasy MinElute cleanup kit (Qiagen). RNA concentration and purity were assayed using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. 260/280 nm ratios were all >2.1. To ensure complete removal of DNA, a 16 S rRNA PCR amplification was carried out with 1 μg of RNA. First-strand synthesis was carried out using the RETROscript kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions with random decamers but without heat denaturation of the RNA template. Expression of the individual antisense RNAs was confirmed by semiquantitative PCR using antisense-specific oligonucleotides to secA1a (NF1633 and NF1640) and secA2a (NF1636 and NF1639). Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out with an Applied Biosystems 7300 real-time PCR system using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and primers specific for secA1 (NF1634 and NF1635), secA2 (NF1641 and NF1642), and 16 S rRNA (NF1643 and NF1644). A dissociation step was included after each quantitative PCR to confirm the production of a single unique product. The expression of secA1 and secA2 relative to 16 S rRNA was determined according to the method of Pfaffl (37Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25528) Google Scholar). C. difficile is highly resistant to standard chemical and mechanical lysis methods. However, we have observed that C. difficile spontaneously lyses at 37 °C following a single freeze-thaw cycle. This propensity was exploited for the preparation of whole cell lysates and fractionation of C. difficile. For the preparation of whole cell lysates, cultures of C. difficile were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the pellets were frozen at −20 °C. Bacteria were thawed, resuspended in PBS to an A600 nm of 20, and incubated at 37 °C for 40 min. This method resulted in consistent and reproducible lysis. For analysis by SDS-PAGE, an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar) was added. For cell fractionation, the frozen bacterial pellets were resuspended in PBS containing 1.4 mg/ml lysozyme and 0.12 μg/ml DNase I to an A600 nm of 20 and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Membranes were harvested by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (containing the soluble cytoplasmic proteins) was removed and mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer. The harvested membranes were washed twice with 500 μl of PBS, resuspended in PBS, solubilized with 1% SDS to a final equivalent A600 nm of 20, and mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer. SLPs and CWPs were isolated from intact C. difficile cells using low pH glycine as described previously (9Fagan R.P. Albesa-Jové D. Qazi O. Svergun D.I. Brown K.A. Fairweather N.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 71: 1308-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 39Fagan R. Fairweather N. Methods Mol. Biol. 2010; 646: 117-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting were carried out using standard methods and as described previously (9Fagan R.P. Albesa-Jové D. Qazi O. Svergun D.I. Brown K.A. Fairweather N.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 71: 1308-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 39Fagan R. Fairweather N. Methods Mol. Biol. 2010; 646: 117-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). C. difficile strain 630 harboring pRPF185 was grown to an A600 nm of 0.3 in TY broth, induced with ATc (20, 100, or 500 ng/ml) for 210 min, harvested by centrifugation, and frozen. Bacteria harboring the empty vector (pMTL960) or a constitutive gusA expression plasmid (pRPF144) were included as controls. Bacteria were lysed as described above, and the β-glucuronidase activity in the cell lysates was determined as described previously (34Dupuy B. Sonenshein A.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 107-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Overnight TY cultures were subcultured to an A600 nm of 0.05 in complete C. difficile defined medium, grown to an A600 nm of 0.3, and induced with 20 ng/ml ATc. After a 40-min induction, 1 ml of each culture was harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in C. difficile defined medium without methionine, and incubated for a further 30 min to exhaust cellular methionine pools. Cultures were then removed from the anaerobic cabinet to a 37 °C heating block. 100 μCi of EasyTag [35S]methionine (specific activity of 1175 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to each culture, and 200-μl samples were removed to fresh tubes containing 50 μl of 1 m NaN3 at defined intervals. 800 μl of unlabeled C. difficile was added to each tube, and S-layer extracts were prepared as described above. Overnight C. difficile TY cultures were subcultured into fresh TY broth supplemented with thiamphenicol with and without 500 ng/ml ATc and grown overnight. Bacteria were fixed and immunolabeled using a rat anti-LMW SLP antibody as described previously (15Emerson J.E. Reynolds C.B. Fagan R.P. Shaw H.A. Goulding D. Fairweather N.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 74: 541-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Immunolabeled bacteria were visualized and photographed using a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope fitted with a Retiga 2000R Fast 1394 camera. For many years, the genetic intractability of C. difficile has hampered molecular analysis of this important pathogen; however, recent advances have finally opened the way for fundamental genetic analysis. One crucial tool still missing from the repertoire of C. difficile genetic tools is the ability to control the expression of a plasmid-borne gene. A lac-based inducible promoter, which has been shown to work well in some clostridial species (33Heap J.T. Pennington O.J. Cartman S.T. Carter G.P. Minton N.P. J. Microbiol. Methods. 2007; 70: 452-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) does not appear to be fully functional in C. difficile. 3R. P. Fagan and N. F. Fairweather, unpublished data. Tetracycline-inducible promoters have been successfully employed in many Gram-positive species (40Geissendörfer M. Hillen W. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1990; 33: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 41Bateman B.T. Donegan N.P. Jarry T.M. Palma M. Cheung A.L. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7851-7857Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We have taken one such system, optimized for use in S. aureus (36Corrigan R.M. Foster T.J. Plasmid. 2009; 61: 126-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and adapted it for use in C. difficile. The inducible system consists of a pair of divergent promoters (PtetR and Ptet), each with an overlapping tet operator sequence. PtetR drives the expression of TetR, a transcription factor that negatively regulates both promoters, whereas Ptet is used to drive expression of the gene of interest. Addition of tetracycline relieves TetR repression and results in increased expression of both the gene of interest and TetR. The resulting negative feedback ensures tight regulation and dose-dependent induction. The tet promoter system from pRMC2 (36Corrigan R.M. Foster T.J. Plasmid. 2009; 61: 126-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) was modified as described under “Experimental Procedures” and transferred into the E. coli-C. difficile shuttle vector pMTL960. The gusA gene, encoding the β-glucuronidase enzyme, was cloned downstream of the Ptet promoter, and β-glucuronidase activity used as a readout of inducible gene expression in C. difficile. Although C. difficile strain 630 carries tetM and is resistant to tetracycline, there is a lag between addition of the antibiotic and complete expression of resistance. To avoid any effects on growth and to allow use of the inducible system in tetracycline-sensitive strains of C. difficile, the non-antibiotic analog ATc was used for induction of the system. In the absence of induction, there was no detectable β-glucuronidase activity, demonstrating the extremely tight repression of Ptet by TetR (Fig. 1A). Induction with ATc was exquisitely dose-dependent with a linear induction profile. Furthermore, induction with 500 ng/ml ATc resulted in levels of β-glucuronidase activity similar to those seen with the constitutive Pcwp2 promoter (15Emerson J.E. Reynolds C.B. Fagan R.P. Shaw H.A. Goulding D. Fairweather N.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 74: 541-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In species that possess both canonical and accessory Sec systems, there are several consistent characteristics that distinguish the respective SecA proteins (reviewed in Ref. 28Rigel N.W. Braunstein M. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). For example, the housekeeping SecA1 protein has a higher molecular weight than the accessory protein, SecA2. This size difference is due largely to the absence, in SecA2, of the C-terminal linker; the C-terminal linker has been implicated in interactions with both lipid and SecB (42Breukink E. Nouwen N. van Raalte A. Mizushima S. Tommassen J. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7902-7907Abstract F"
https://openalex.org/W2121935766,"Adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been implicated in cognitive and emotional processes, as well as in response to antidepressant treatment. However, little is known about how the adult stem cell lineage contributes to hippocampal structure and function and how this process is modulated by the animal's experience. Here we perform an indelible lineage analysis and report that neural stem cells can produce expanding and persisting populations of not only neurons, but also stem cells in the adult hippocampus. Furthermore, the ratio of stem cells to neurons depends on experiences of the animal or the location of the stem cell. Surprisingly, social isolation facilitated accumulation of stem cells, but not neurons. These results show that neural stem cells accumulate in the adult hippocampus and that the stem cell-lineage relationship is under control of anatomic and experiential niches. Our findings suggest that, in the hippocampus, fate specification may act as a form of cellular plasticity for adapting to environmental changes."

We designed an assay system to allow titration of the redox state of the superoxide-generating site during reverse electron transport in rat skeletal muscle mitochondria: a protonmotive force generated by ATP hydrolysis, succinate:malonate to alter electron supply and modulate the redox state of the Q pool, and inhibition of complex III to prevent QH2 oxidation via the Q cycle. Stepwise oxidation of the QH2/Q pool by increasing malonate concentration slowed the rates of both reverse electron transport and rotenone-sensitive superoxide production by complex I. However, the superoxide production rate was not uniquely related to the resultant potential of the NADH/NAD+ redox couple. Thus, there is a superoxide producer during reverse electron transport at complex I that responds to Q pool redox state and is not in equilibrium with the NAD reduction state. In contrast, superoxide production during forward electron transport in the presence of rotenone was uniquely related to NAD redox state. These results support a two-site model of complex I superoxide production; one site in equilibrium with the NAD pool, presumably the flavin of the FMN moiety (site IF) and the other dependent not only on NAD redox state, but also on protonmotive force and the reduction state of the Q pool, presumably a semiquinone in the Q-binding site (site IQ).

An important distinction is that the rate of superoxide production by isolated mitochondria during reverse electron transport can be severalfold higher than the maximum rate when the flavin is fully reduced by the addition of NADH-generating substrates plus rotenone or other complex I Q site inhibitors (10Lambert A.J.

The high rate of superoxide production during reverse electron transport is inhibited by complex I Q site inhibitors and is highly sensitive to the pH gradient across the mitochondrial membrane (ΔpH), as well as to uncoupling and declining protonmotive force (Δp) (10Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 11Liu Y. Fiskum G. Schubert D. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). The observed differences in the rates and properties of superoxide production during forward and reverse electron transport have led to the proposal of a two-site model of superoxide production by complex I. One site is the flavin at the NAD-binding site (site IF) and the other site is located between the flavin and the interaction of complex I with Q (site IQ) (20Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39414-39420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), which includes the Q-binding site of the complex and the Fe-S centers linking the flavin to the Q-binding site. Possible candidates for this second superoxide-producing site include an unstable semiquinone, such as the Δp-sensitive species reported in Ref. 21Magnitsky S. Toulokhonova L. Yano T. Sled V.D. Hägerhäll C. Grivennikova V.G. Burbaev D.S. Vinogradov A.D. Ohnishi T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2002; 34: 193-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, or alternatively this superoxide may come from the interaction of this semiquinone and the terminal Fe-S center N2 or, as suggested in Ref. 3Genova M.L. Ventura B. Giuliano G. Bovina C. Formiggini G. Parenti Castelli G. Lenaz G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, from N2 itself. Support for the two-site model comes from three key observations: (i) there is a higher superoxide production rate during reverse electron transport compared with forward electron transport; (ii) this higher rate is not accompanied by a greater NADH/NAD+ ratio in isolated mitochondria as would be predicted by a one-site (IF) model, but instead by slightly lower NAD reduction (22Lambert A.J. Buckingham J.A. Brand M.D. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 1711-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); and (iii) this higher rate is highly sensitive to dissipation of ΔpH (10Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The third line of evidence is not expected for a one-site IF model, which predicts sensitivity to Δp, which drives electrons from QH2 to the flavin, but not specific sensitivity to the ΔpH component, because of the large distance between the flavin moiety and the proton-translocating region of complex I. In addition, isolated bovine complex I that retains bound Q has EPR signals that appear to come from both the flavin and the Q-binding site, which is also consistent with two sites capable of radical production (23Ohnishi S.T. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Ohta K. Yoshikawa S. Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1797: 1901-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, despite this evidence, the two-site model is still under debate (15Hirst J. King M.S. Pryde K.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2008; 36: 976-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 24Fato R.

Handbook of the Biology of Aging. 7th Ed. Academic Press, London2011: 47-61Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In the one-site model, all superoxide production by complex I during both forward and reverse electron transport comes from site IF. This site is characterized by increasing superoxide production with increasing NADH/NAD+ up to a maximal rate (2Kussmaul L. Hirst J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 7607-7612Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) and a unique relationship between superoxide production and the potential of the NADH/NAD+ redox couple at constant NAD pool size (2Kussmaul L. Hirst J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 7607-7612Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The direction of electron transfer should not matter in a one-site model. Recently, it was concluded that complex I in submitochondrial particles produces superoxide from the flavin irrespective of the direction of electron transport (27Pryde K.R. Hirst J. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 18056-18065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). However, the preparation used in this work failed to recapitulate the central traits that have led to the two-site model: superoxide production during reverse electron transport that is severalfold greater than that from the fully reduced flavin, and sensitivity to ΔpH, suggesting that site IQ was inactive under the conditions studied. In the two-site model, superoxide production during forward electron transport in the presence of rotenone comes mostly from site IF and is uniquely related to the potential of the NADH/NAD+ redox couple, whereas superoxide production during reverse electron transport comes mostly from site IQ and responds to both NAD and Q redox states as well as Δp. It is important to understand the sources of superoxide in complex I, not only because of their potential relevance to disease and aging (28Quinlan C.L. Treberg J.R. Brand M.D. Masoro E.J. Austad S.N. Handbook of the Biology of Aging. 7th Ed. Academic Press, London2011: 47-61Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), but also because superoxide production provides a mechanistic constraint that helps in building models of the proton-pumping mechanism of complex I (29Treberg J.R. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 17579-17584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Here, we test the one-site model by measuring the relationship between superoxide production and the potential of the NADH/NAD+ redox couple during reverse electron transport in isolated mitochondria. We use isolated mitochondria because they display the requisite high rate of ΔpH-sensitive superoxide production. The results conflict with the one-site model but strongly support the two-site model of superoxide production by complex I. Female Wistar rats between 5 and 8 weeks of age were from Harlan Laboratories and had free access to chow and water. All housing, husbandry, and sampling procedures were approved by the Buck Institute Animal Care Committee. Rats were killed by asphyxiation with CO2 followed by cervical dislocation. Skeletal muscle was removed from both hind limbs and placed in ice-cold Chappell-Perry buffer 1 (100 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris, 2 mm EGTA, pH 7.1, at 25 °C). Muscle was homogenized and extracted with subtilisin A (Type VIII) at 0 °C as described (30Rolfe D.F.S. Hulbert A.J. Brand M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were isolated from the homogenate by differential centrifugation with all steps at 0–4 °C. The initial extract was centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was filtered through several layers of cheesecloth and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellets were resuspended in ice-cold Chappell-Perry buffer 1 and centrifuged again at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended a second time in ice-cold Chappell-Perry buffer 1 and centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g, and the resulting supernatant was then centrifuged for 10 min at 4,000 × g. This final pellet was resuspended in Chappell-Perry buffer 1 to final concentration of 25–45 mg of protein · ml−1, as determined by biuret assay using BSA as a standard. The release of H2O2 by intact mitochondria was used as a measure of superoxide production. The assay was based on the detection of H2O2 by Amplex UltraRed (50 μm) in a medium (pH 7.2 at 37 °C) containing 250 mm sucrose, 25 mm Tris, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm ATP, and 5 units · ml−1 horseradish peroxidase and 25 units · ml−1 superoxide dismutase. Formation of the fluorescent product was monitored in a Shimadzu RF-5301PC spectrofluorophotometer (excitation 563 nm, emission 587 nm) or a Varian Eclipse spectrophotometer (excitation 560 nm, emission 590 nm) with constant mixing at 37 °C. Calibration curves generated by adding known amounts of H2O2 under identical conditions were used to convert rates of fluorescent product formation into mol of H2O2 produced. Unless otherwise shown, the observed rate of product formation before the addition of substrate was subtracted from the subsequent rates. Mitochondria were either pretreated with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) to deplete GSH as described previously (17Treberg J.R. Quinlan C.L. Brand M.D. FEBS J. 2010; 277: 2766-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), or rates of H2O2 release from untreated mitochondria were corrected based on the CDNB pretreatment of rat skeletal muscle mitochondria using the equation in (17Treberg J.R. Quinlan C.L. Brand M.D. FEBS J. 2010; 277: 2766-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar): Corrected H2O2production=Observed rate+1.43*(observed rate)(0.55+observed rate)Eq. 1 Rates were corrected directly from the raw observed rate of H2O2 release assuming all product was formed in the matrix. The maximum rate of rotenone-sensitive superoxide production was lower in Fig. 3 (CDNB-treated mitochondria) than Fig. 2 (not CDNB-treated but corrected as above). This may reflect a slightly lower Δp in Fig. 3 caused either by CDNB treatment or the longer energization period (1.5 min in Fig. 2 compared with 4 min in Fig. 3) because superoxide production during reverse electron transport is highly sensitive to Δp (10Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Despite this difference, the overall patterns of response were comparable between FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3.FIGURE 2Titration of superoxide production by complex I during reverse electron transport. Superoxide production by rat skeletal muscle mitochondria not pretreated with CDNB was measured as H2O2 production as illustrated in Fig. 1B. Mitochondria were incubated for 1.5 min in the presence of 2 mm ATP and 200 nm stigmatellin, then 5 mm (succinate + malonate) was added at the ratios shown. The rate of superoxide production was measured before (triangles) or after (circles) addition of 4 μm rotenone at 3 min. The rate with 5 mm succinate was not different (p > 0.05, paired t test) from the rate at the highest ratio shown (99:1). The background rates before the addition of succinate were subtracted from all rates. Data are mean ± S.E. (error bars; n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mitochondrial NADH/NAD+ was measured using the NAD(P)H autofluorescence (excitation 365 nm, emission 450 nm) of mitochondrial suspensions (0.3 mg of mitochondrial protein · ml−1) maintained with mixing at 37 °C in a Varian Eclipse spectrophotometer. For details, see Ref. 17Treberg J.R. Quinlan C.L. Brand M.D. FEBS J. 2010; 277: 2766-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar. Briefly, mitochondria were left de-energized for 5 min to fully oxidize the matrix nucleotide pools, and the signal was set at 0% NAD(P)H. To determine the scale for the fully reduced (100%) NAD(P)H pool, 5 mm glutamate, 5 mm malate, and 4 μm rotenone were then added. A linear scale from 0 to 100% NAD(P)H was assumed for subsequent calculation of % reduction. Although this technique measures the reduction of both the NAD and NADP pools, as explained elsewhere (17Treberg J.R. Quinlan C.L. Brand M.D. FEBS J. 2010; 277: 2766-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), for skeletal muscle mitochondria this signal is predominantly from the NAD pool and is a sufficient proxy for intramitochondrial NADH/NAD+. However, the NADPH pool contributes a small signal, which we acknowledge by using the term %NAD(P)H. The working potential (Eh) of the NAD pool was determined using the NAD+/NADH ratio calculated assuming %NAD(P)H = %NADH. For each succinate:malonate condition the following were used in the Nernst equation: n (number of electrons transferred) = 2, temperature = 310 K, and midpoint potential (Em) for the NAD+/NADH couple at pH 7.4 = −332 mV. The generation of Δp with ATP will alkalinize the mitochondrial matrix relative to the medium. We used a matrix pH of 7.4 based on an assumed ΔpH of 0.2 pH units from the set pH of 7.2 in the buffered medium. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. unless otherwise stated. Differences between treatments (substrate conditions) were analyzed by t test (paired when appropriate) with p < 0.05 considered significant. The relationships in Fig. 4A were fitted by nonlinear regression using the equation Rate ofH2O2production=VmaxofH2O2production×(1+-(Eh-Em/k))-1Eq. 2 where Eh is the working potential of the NAD pool, Em is the fitted midpoint potential of the relationships observed in Fig. 4A, and k is a constant. Parameter values were: Vmax (nmol of H2O2 · min−1 · mg of protein−1) = 1.02 ± 0.04, 0.83 ± 0.09, 0.4 ± 0.07; Em (mV) = −333 ± 6, −335 ± 7, −337 ± 4; k = −7.3 ± 1.5, −14.3 ± 3.0, −9.9 ± 3.9 for the 1:1 succinate:malonate, 1:2 succinate:malonate, and the combined 1:1 and 1:2 succinate:malonate (plus rotenone) data, respectively. Superoxide production from complex I during reverse electron transport requires sufficiently high Δp. Fig. 1A illustrates the assay designed to achieve this while allowing the redox state of the Q pool to be manipulated. Stigmatellin, which blocks the Qo site of complex III, was added to eliminate Q pool oxidation and superoxide production by complex III. To generate a Δp to drive reverse electron transport from QH2 to NAD+, 2 mm ATP was added. Under these conditions, addition of 5 mm succinate as a source of electrons to reduce the Q pool resulted in a rapid and sufficiently constant rate of superoxide production (Fig. 1B). We chose a sucrose-based assay medium because a KCl-based medium gave low, variable and nonlinear rates of superoxide production. Superoxide production from reverse electron transport was defined as the component of the total production that was sensitive to rotenone (4 μm), which specifically inhibits electron transport at the Q-binding site of complex I. Omission of ATP or addition of 0.1 μg · ml−1 oligomycin (to block ATP hydrolysis) abolished rotenone-sensitive superoxide production (Fig. 1B), showing that it was fully dependent on Δp generated by ATP hydrolysis. Addition of atpenin A5 (1 μm), a complex II Q site inhibitor, inhibited superoxide production to a similar extent as rotenone. Rotenone addition after atpenin A5, or A5 addition after rotenone, had little effect compared with the site IQ production rate (not shown). Rotenone-sensitive superoxide production was titrated by changing the ratio of succinate to malonate (a competitive inhibitor of succinate transport and complex II) to alter the kinetic balance of Q pool reduction and oxidation rates (Fig. 2). At higher succinate:malonate ratios, the capacity to reduce the Q pool became greater and rotenone-sensitive superoxide production increased to a maximum. Under all substrate conditions most of the superoxide production was inhibited by adding rotenone to block the supply of electrons from QH2 to complex I (Fig. 2) (the characteristics of the residual rotenone-insensitive rate are explored in FIGURE 3, FIGURE 5A below). Thus, the rate of rotenone-sensitive superoxide production from complex I during reverse electron transport at high Δp depends on the redox state of the Q pool and shows saturation at high reduction. The characteristics of superoxide production during reverse electron transport (climbing to a maximum and then staying high as the capacity to reduce complex I increases) are shared by site IF when the NADH/NAD+ ratio is increased during forward electron transport (2Kussmaul L. Hirst J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 7607-7612Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 9Kushnareva Y. Murphy A.N. Andreyev A. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 14Starkov A.A. Fiskum G. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 1101-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 17Treberg J.R. Quinlan C.L. Brand M.D. FEBS J. 2010; 277: 2766-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because of this similarity, it was important to characterize further the superoxide producer during reverse electron transport to determine whether rotenone-sensitive superoxide comes from the flavin of complex I (site IF) or from the Q-binding site of complex I (site IQ). For this, we designed an experiment where NAD reduction (measured as percent NAD(P)H) (Fig. 3, A and C) was determined in parallel with superoxide production (Fig. 3, B and D) as a function of time under conditions of first reverse, and then forward electron flow into complex I. This design allowed us to examine the dependence of each mode of superoxide production on the redox states of the NAD and Q pools, as described below, to see whether the modes were similar (supporting a one-site model) or different (supporting a two-site model). Fig. 3 shows the central experiment. Fig. 3, A and B, shows representative raw traces, and Fig. 3, C and D, shows averaged results. ATP and stigmatellin were added (addition 1) to generate Δp and block complex III, resulting in a partial reduction of NAD(P) and a background rate of superoxide production. After 4 min, succinate:malonate mixes at a sum total concentration of 5 mm were added (addition 2) to reduce the Q pool at different rates and initiate reverse electron transport. This caused markedly different rates of NAD(P)H production to slightly different steady-state values (Fig. 3, A and C) and (as in Fig. 2) markedly different rates of superoxide production (Fig. 3, B and D). The values are summarized in Table 1. Addition of rotenone (addition 3) halted reverse electron transport and its associated superoxide production, allowing calculation of the rotenone-sensitive component of the preceding superoxide production. These data allowed determination of the dependence of rotenone-sensitive superoxide production during reverse electron transport on NAD(P) and Q reduction states (see below). After addition of rotenone, with a strongly reduced NAD(P) pool from the earlier period of reverse electron transport, forward electron transport into site IF dominated the residual superoxide production rate. As electrons leaked to oxygen and other acceptors from NAD(P)H, this phase of the experiment allowed determination of the rate of superoxide production predominantly from site IF at different reduction states of NAD(P). Note that in this phase, site IQ may also generate a small proportion of the superoxide under these conditions of high Δp plus rotenone (20Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39414-39420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Likewise, at high NADH/NAD+, reversal of the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase component of oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes may also contribute to our observed H2O2 production (31Ambrus A. Tretter L. Adam-Vizi V. J. Neurochem. 2009; 109: 222-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These alternate NADH-dependent producers of H2O2 are important to consider physiologically, but for simplicity we do not discriminate between them when referring to site IF.TABLE 1Effect of malonate inhibition of succinate oxidation on NAD+ reduction and superoxide production by complex I5 mm succinateSuccinate:malonate 1:1Succinate:malonate 1:2Maximum reduction of NAD (% NAD(P)H)94.6 ± 1.9a93.9 ± 0.1a,b87.2 ± 2.2bMaximum Eh (NAD+/NADH) (mV)−373 ± 6−368 ± 1−358 ± 3*p = 0.086 compared with 5 mm succinate (paired t test).Maximum Eh (Q/QH2) (mV)−83 ± 6−78 ± 1−68 ± 3Reverse electron transport rate (% NAD(P)H· min−1)144 ± 6.5a47.2 ± 5.6b23.1 ± 2.0cMaximum rotenone-sensitive superoxide production rate (nmol H2O2·min−1·mg protein−1)1.38 ± 0.09a0.86 ± 0.03b0.48 ± 0.03cData are from Fig. 3.

The maximum reduction state of NAD was taken as the highest observed value in Fig. 3C. The value of percent NAD(P)H was used to calculate NAD+/NADH to determine the maximum working potential (Eh) reached. Eh for Q/QH2 was calculated as Q pool Eh = NAD pool Eh + 2Δp; Δp generated by ATP was assumed to be 145 mV (20Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39414-39420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The rate of reverse electron transport was calculated as the initial rate of NAD(P)+ reduction following the addition of succinate. The maximum rotenone-sensitive superoxide production was the highest rate observed in Fig. 3D, with the rate in the presence of 4 μm rotenone subtracted. Data are mean ± S.E. (n = 3). Different superscripts in the same row indicate a difference (p < 0.05, paired t test). The rate of reverse electron transport following substrate addition (addition 2 in Fig. 3A) should depend on the value of Δp (held constant between treatments by ATP hydrolysis) and the redox state of the Q pool. We measured the rate of reverse electron transport as the initial rate of change in the percent reduction of NAD(P) (Fig. 3, A and C, and Table 1) at different succinate:malonate ratios. The rate of reverse electron transport was greatly inhibited as the succinate:malonate ratio decreased (Table 1). Thus, reverse electron transport requires a very reduced Q pool, and its rate is highly sensitive to small declines in QH2/Q at the same Δp. During reverse electron transport at different succinate:malonate ratios, we can calculate the working redox potential (Eh) of the NAD+/NADH couple from percent NAD(P)H reduction. In turn, this can be used to calculate the Eh of the Q/QH2 couple when net reverse electron flow ceases, if we assume near equilibrium of ΔEh with Δp across complex I, and four protons translocated by complex I per pair of electrons (32Brown G.C. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The Eh of the NAD+/NADH couple supported by reverse electron transport can be estimated by converting percent NAD(P)H to NAD+/NADH and substituting into the Nernst equation. Using a midpoint potential (E′m) of −332 mV (Em of NAD+/NADH couple at pH 7.4), the maximum Eh values ranged from −373 mV with 5 mm succinate to −358 mV with 1:2 succinate:malonate (Table 1). Differences approached statistical significance (p = 0.087, paired t test) and were biologically significant because percent NAD(P)H (Table 1) and calculated NAD+/NADH (data not shown) were both significantly different (p < 0.05) between 5 mm succinate and 1:2 succinate:malonate. Assuming equilibrium between Δp and the ΔEh between the NAD and Q pools in the steady states where percent NAD(P)H has stabilized (32Brown G.C. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the Eh of the Q/QH2 couple is offset from the Eh of the NAD+/NADH couple by 2Δp. Rat skeletal muscle mitochondrial energized with ATP generate a Δp of ∼145 mV (20Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39414-39420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Using this value we find that even with 1:2 succinate:malonate the Q pool is highly reduced, at −68 mV (Table 1). Because the Em of the membrane Q pool is +42 mV at pH 7.4 (Em at pH 7.0 is +66 mV with a −60 mV change per pH unit increase) (16Urban P.F. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 9: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), this corresponds to >99% reduction of the Q pool. With succinate alone, the Q pool was even more reduced, at −83 mV (Table 1). NADH and NAD+ are the reactants at the flavin of complex I (site IF). Because of the large Vmax and ready reversibility of this site, the intramitochondrial NAD pool and the flavin of complex I should be near equilibrium during forward electron transport (particularly in the presence of rotenone) and during reverse electron transport (at all rates of electron transport, but particularly when percent NAD(P)H is high and net rates are slow). Thus, in mitochondria the flavin reduction state and the consequent rate of superoxide production from site IF should be a unique function of percent NAD(P)H or the Eh of the NAD pool. In a one-site model of complex I superoxide production, the superoxide produced during reverse electron transport comes entirely from site IF, so should be uniquely related to the Eh of the NAD pool regardless of the Eh of the Q pool. Conversely, in a two-site model this superoxide comes mostly from site IQ, so the relationship between superoxide and the Eh of the NAD pool may alter when the Eh of the Q pool is altered. The data in Fig. 3 and Table 1 allow these models to be distinguished by plotting superoxide production against the Eh of the NAD pool at different Eh values of the Q pool during reverse (and forward) electron transport, as shown in Fig. 4. It is clear from Fig. 4A (filled symbols) that the relationship between superoxide production rate during reverse electron transport and the Eh of the NAD pool differed depending on the Eh of the Q pool (modulated by the different succinate:malonate ratios). This result is inconsistent with the one-site model and strongly supports the two-site model. These relationships also appear to differ from the relationship during forward electron transport in the presence of rotenone (open symbols in Fig. 4A, line fitted to pooled data after rotenone addition in Fig. 3, C and D), showing that the properties of site IF in the presence of rotenone do not adequately explain the rate of superoxide production during reverse electron transport, so this superoxide must come from a second site (site IQ). Fig. 4B makes the same point more explicitly, by comparing the rates of superoxide production under different conditions at the same arbitrary Eh of the NAD pool (−355 mV). The rates during reverse electron transport were significantly different at the two different succinate:malonate ratios, where the Eh of the NAD pool was the same but the Eh of the Q pool differed, and both rates appeared to be greater than the rate from site IF at the same Eh of the NAD pool. The rate at −355 mV in the presence of rotenone is the value modeled from the pooled data ± the 95% confidence interval. It cannot be compared with the other values by t test (or other similar statistical tests). However, the other two values are far outside this 95% confidence interval (Fig. 4B), making it reasonable to state that these are likely to be different. Therefore, because the rate of superoxide formation can be different at the same Δp and same intramitochondrial Eh for NAD, these data strongly support the contention that complex I has a superoxide producer whose rate is not determined solely by the redox state of the NAD pool (i.e. site IQ). Following the addition of rotenone in Fig. 3, superoxide production fell dramatically as reverse electron transport came to a halt, allowing the properties of the rotenone-sensitive reverse electron transport-dependent superoxide production to be analyzed, above. However, a residual rate of superoxide production remained, and this mode is examined here. Under these conditions the NAD pool had been filled with electrons driven up from the Q pool by reverse electron transport (Fig. 3, A and C). On addition of rotenone, the NADH was able to drive forward electron transport into complex I and generate superoxide. The flavin of complex I was the only major superoxide producer that was not inhibited in this state (although site IQ may also have generated some superoxide because Δp was high) (20Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39414-39420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), so the residual superoxide production after rotenone addition came predominantly from site IF. Fig. 5A shows the dependence of this superoxide production from site IF on the redox state of the NAD pool as it slowly reoxidized following addition of rotenone (repeating the data for forward electron transport in Fig. 4). The data were best fit by a single, unique relationship between superoxide production rate and Eh of the NAD pool despite different succinate:malonate ratios and different redox states of the Q pool. This result supports the notion that following the addition of rotenone, superoxide was produced by a site that was in equilibrium with the intramitochondrial NAD pool and was not affected by the redox state of the Q pool. The filled symbols in Fig. 5A show data from a previous titration of site IF superoxide production (17Treberg J.R. Quinlan C.L. Brand M.D. FEBS J. 2010; 277: 2766-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These data sets overlay, adding strong support to our contention that the superoxide produced in the presence of rotenone came from site IF. Thus, superoxide production from site IF was uniquely related to the potential of the NADH/NAD+ redox couple, in contrast to the superoxide production during reverse electron transport. Fig. 5B shows the relationship between rotenone-sensitive superoxide production rate and the calculated Q pool redox state in the steady state supported by reverse electron transport once the electron transport rates had slowed (Fig. 3 and Table 1) and complex I could be safely assumed to be near equilibrium. The rate declined very steeply when the Q pool was slightly more oxidized, showing that superoxide production by site IQ requires a very high reduction of the Q pool and is very sensitive to small declines in Q pool redox state. Note that the x axis spans 50 mV for both A and B panels of Fig. 5. The steep dependence on the availability of QH2 in Fig. 5B is in marked contrast to the much shallower relationship between site IF and percent NAD(P)H in Fig. 5A. It is unclear whether site IQ is a major source of superoxide under physiological conditions. It may be that the combined presence of multiple substrates that supply electrons to the Q pool, including succinate, fatty acids, α-glycerophosphate, and the branched chain amino acids, can result in conditions sufficient for site IQ superoxide production. Even if not physiologically significant, the presence of this second site of complex I superoxide production, which is influenced by Δp, ΔpH, and the reduction state of the NAD and Q pools, can be a valuable tool in understanding the still contentious mechanism of coupling redox reactions at complex I to proton translocation (29Treberg J.R. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 17579-17584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In summary, with the assay system used in the present study, the superoxide produced during reverse electron transport was dependent on a highly reduced Q pool and declined sharply as the QH2/Q ratio decreased. The majority of the superoxide produced during reverse electron transport came from a site that was not in equilibrium with the NAD pool. Therefore, the flavin of the FMN moiety (site IF) is not supported as the sole superoxide generator during reverse electron transport, and our results are inconsistent with the one-site model of superoxide production by complex I. Our data using intact mitochondria support the hypothesis that complex I has two superoxide-producing redox centers: one with a low maximum rate of production that is in equilibrium with the NAD pool (site IF), and one with a higher maximum rate of production that is dependent on the reduction state of the Q pool, requires the presence of Δp to drive reverse electron transport, and (under the conditions used here) is inhibited by rotenone (site IQ)."
https://openalex.org/W1982008460,"During development, the axons of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) neurons must decide whether to cross or avoid the midline at the optic chiasm to project to targets on both sides of the brain. By combining genetic analyses with in vitro assays, we show that neuropilin 1 (NRP1) promotes contralateral RGC projection in mammals. Unexpectedly, the NRP1 ligand involved is not an axon guidance cue of the class 3 semaphorin family, but VEGF164, the neuropilin-binding isoform of the classical vascular growth factor VEGF-A. VEGF164 is expressed at the chiasm midline and is required for normal contralateral growth in vivo. In outgrowth and growth cone turning assays, VEGF164 acts directly on NRP1-expressing contralateral RGCs to provide growth-promoting and chemoattractive signals. These findings have identified a permissive midline signal for axons at the chiasm midline and provide in vivo evidence that VEGF-A is an essential axon guidance cue."
https://openalex.org/W2140101119,"Lhx6 and Lhx8 transcription factor coexpression in early-born MGE neurons is required to induce neuronal Shh expression. We provide evidence that these transcription factors regulate expression of a Shh enhancer in MGE neurons. Lhx6 and Lhx8 are also required to prevent Nkx2-1 expression in a subset of pallial interneurons. Shh function in early-born MGE neurons was determined by genetically eliminating Shh expression in the MGE mantle zone (MZ). This mutant had reduced SHH signaling in the overlying progenitor zone, which led to reduced Lhx6, Lhx8, and Nkx2-1 expression in the rostrodorsal MGE and a preferential reduction of late-born somatostatin(+) and parvalbumin(+) cortical interneurons. Thus, Lhx6 and Lhx8 regulate MGE development through autonomous and nonautonomous mechanisms, the latter by promoting Shh expression in MGE neurons, which in turn feeds forward to promote the developmental program of the rostrodorsal MGE."

Double-strandedness and 5′-terminal triphosphates were identified as motifs required to elicit optimal immunological signaling. However, very little is known about the response dynamics of the RIG-I pathway, which is crucial for the ability of the cell to react to diverse classes of viral RNA while maintaining self-tolerance. In the present study, we addressed the molecular mechanism of RIG-I signal detection and its translation into pathway activation. By employing highly quantitative methods, we could establish the length of the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to be the most critical determinant of response strength. Size exclusion chromatography and direct visualization in scanning force microscopy suggested that this was due to cooperative oligomerization of RIG-I along dsRNA. The initiation efficiency of this oligomerization process critically depended on the presence of high affinity motifs, like a 5′-triphosphate. It is noteworthy that for dsRNA longer than 200 bp, internal initiation could effectively compensate for a lack of terminal triphosphates. In summary, our data demonstrate a very flexible response behavior of the RIG-I pathway, in which sensing and integration of at least two distinct signals, initiation efficiency and double strand length, allow the host cell to mount an antiviral response that is tightly adjusted to the type of the detected signal, such as viral genomes, replication intermediates, or small by-products.

https://openalex.org/W2155542864,"Prefrontal cortex plays an important role in working memory, attention regulation and behavioral inhibition. Its functions are associated with NMDA receptors. However, there is little information regarding the roles of NMDA receptor NR2B subunit in prefrontal cortical synaptic plasticity and prefrontal cortex-related working memory. Whether the up-regulation of NR2B subunit influences prefrontal cortical synaptic plasticity and working memory is not yet clear. In the present study, we measured prefrontal cortical synaptic plasticity and working memory function in NR2B overexpressing transgenic mice. In vitro electrophysiological data showed that overexpression of NR2B specifically in the forebrain region resulted in enhancement of prefrontal cortical long-term potentiation (LTP) but did not alter long-term depression (LTD). The enhanced LTP was completely abolished by a NR2B subunit selective antagonist, Ro25-6981, indicating that overexpression of NR2B subunit is responsible for enhanced LTP. In addition, NR2B transgenic mice exhibited better performance in a set of working memory paradigms including delay no-match-to-place T-maze, working memory version of water maze and odor span task. Our study provides evidence that NR2B subunit of NMDA receptor in prefrontal cortex is critical for prefrontal cortex LTP and prefrontal cortex-related working memory."

The objective of this study is to assess demographic and socioeconomic determinants of current smoking in low- and middle-income countries.We used data, from the World Health Survey in 48 low-income and middle-income countries, to explore the impact of demographic and socioeconomic factors on the current smoking status of respondents. The data from these surveys provided information on 213,807 respondents aged 18 years or above that were divided into 4 pooled datasets according to their sex and country income group. The overall proportion of current smokers, as well as the proportion by each relevant demographic and socioeconomic determinant, was calculated within each of the pooled datasets, and multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association between current smoking and these determinants.The odds of smoking were not equal in all demographic or socioeconomic groups. Some factors were fairly stable across the four datasets studied: for example, individuals were more likely to smoke if they had little or no education, regardless of if they were male or female, or lived in a low or a middle income country. Nevertheless, other factors, notably age and wealth, showed a differential effect on smoking by sex or country income level. While women in the low-income country group were twice as likely to smoke if they were in the lowest wealth quintile compared with the highest, the association was absent in the middle-income country group.Information on how smoking is distributed among low- or middle-income countries will allow policy makers to tailor future policies, and target the most vulnerable populations."
https://openalex.org/W2022580699,"The present study examined the neural basis of vivid motor imagery with parametrical functional magnetic resonance imaging. 22 participants performed motor imagery (MI) of six different right-hand movements that differed in terms of pointing accuracy needs and object involvement, i.e., either none, two big or two small squares had to be pointed at in alternation either with or without an object grasped with the fingers. After each imagery trial, they rated the perceived vividness of motor imagery on a 7-point scale. Results showed that increased perceived imagery vividness was parametrically associated with increasing neural activation within the left putamen, the left premotor cortex (PMC), the posterior parietal cortex of the left hemisphere, the left primary motor cortex, the left somatosensory cortex, and the left cerebellum. Within the right hemisphere, activation was found within the right cerebellum, the right putamen, and the right PMC. It is concluded that the perceived vividness of MI is parametrically associated with neural activity within sensorimotor areas. The results corroborate the hypothesis that MI is an outcome of neural computations based on movement representations located within motor areas."
https://openalex.org/W2076731913,"Background Fetal alcohol exposure affects 1 in 100 children making it the leading cause of mental retardation in the US. It has long been known that alcohol affects cerebellum development and function. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings We demonstrate that CREB binding protein (CBP) is widely expressed in granule and Purkinje neurons of the developing cerebellar cortex of naïve rats. We also show that exposure to ethanol during the 3rd trimester-equivalent of human pregnancy reduces CBP levels. CBP is a histone acetyltransferase, a component of the epigenetic mechanism controlling neuronal gene expression. We further demonstrate that the acetylation of both histone H3 and H4 is reduced in the cerebellum of ethanol- treated rats. Conclusions/Significance These findings indicate that ethanol exposure decreases the expression and function of CBP in the developing cerebellum. This effect of ethanol may be responsible for the motor coordination deficits that characterize fetal alcohol spectrum disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2030706601,"Family Rhizobiaceae includes fast growing bacteria currently arranged into three genera, Rhizobium, Ensifer and Shinella, that contain pathogenic, symbiotic and saprophytic species. The identification of these species is not possible on the basis of physiological or biochemical traits and should be based on sequencing of several genes. Therefore alternative methods are necessary for rapid and reliable identification of members from family Rhizobiaceae. In this work we evaluated the suitability of Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for this purpose. Firstly, we evaluated the capability of this methodology to differentiate among species of family Rhizobiaceae including those closely related and then we extended the database of MALDI Biotyper 2.0 including the type strains of 56 species from genera Rhizobium, Ensifer and Shinella. Secondly, we evaluated the identification potential of this methodology by using several strains isolated from different sources previously identified on the basis of their rrs, recA and atpD gene sequences. The 100% of these strains were correctly identified showing that MALDI-TOF MS is an excellent tool for identification of fast growing rhizobia applicable to large populations of isolates in ecological and taxonomic studies."
https://openalex.org/W2057194283,"In adult mammalian brains, neurogenesis persists in the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles (SVZ) and the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. Although evidence suggest that adult neurogenesis in these two regions is subjected to differential regulation, the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, we show that the RNA-binding protein FXR2 specifically regulates DG neurogenesis by reducing the stability of Noggin mRNA. FXR2 deficiency leads to increased Noggin expression and subsequently reduced BMP signaling, which results in increased proliferation and altered fate specification of neural stem/progenitor cells in DG. In contrast, Noggin is not regulated by FXR2 in the SVZ, because Noggin expression is restricted to the ependymal cells of the lateral ventricles, where FXR2 is not expressed. Differential regulation of SVZ and DG stem cells by FXR2 may be a key component of the mechanism that governs the different neurogenic processes in these two adult germinal zones."
https://openalex.org/W2035871413,"Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) inhibit proliferation and induce differentiation in leukemia cells. To investigate the molecular mechanisms whereby fatty acids affect these processes, U937 leukemia cells were conditioned with stearic, oleic, linolenic, α-linolenic, arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic acids. PUFAs affected proliferation; eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) was the most potent on cell cycle progression. EPA enhanced the expression of the myeloid lineage-specific transcription factors CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ), PU.1, and c-Jun, resulting in increased expression of the monocyte lineage-specific target gene, the macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor. Indeed, it is known that PU.1 and C/EBPs interact with their consensus sequences on a small DNA fragment of macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor promoter, which is a determinant for expression. We demonstrated that C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ bind the same response element as a heterodimer. We focused on the enhanced expression of C/EBPδ, which has been reported to be a tumor suppressor gene silenced by promoter hypermethylation in U937 cells. After U937 conditioning with EPA and bisulfite sequencing of the −370/−20 CpG island on the C/EBPδ promoter region, we found a site-specific CpG demethylation that was a determinant for the binding activity of Sp1, an essential factor for C/EBPδ gene basal expression.

The most compelling evidence for a crucial role of the C/EBPs in myeloid cell differentiation and maturation has come from studies on knock-out mice. C/EBPα-deficient mice fail to undergo myeloid differentiation beyond the myeloblast stage and, therefore, lack mature neutrophils (26Zhang D.E. Zhang P. Wang N.D. Hetherington C.J. Darlington G.J.

Besides C/EBPs, other transcription factors and co-activators contribute to myeloid cell fate (29Singh H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).

Synergism among PU.1, C/EBPs, and c-Jun is essential to activate monocyte target genes (34Grondin B. Lefrancois M. Tremblay M. Saint-Denis M. Haman A. Waga K. Bédard A. Tenen D.G. Hoang T. Mol. Cell.

Among these, M-CSF receptor is critical for monocyte cell survival and proliferation and is activated early during the monocyte differentiation process (38Tenen D.G. Hromas R. Licht J.D. Zhang D.E.

In the present study, we evaluated the effects of fatty acid conditioning of the U937 promonocytic cell line on proliferation, cell cycle progression, and the differentiation program in relation to chain length and the number of double bonds. We found that eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) treatment reduced cell cycle progression and induced monocyte-specific M-CSF receptor expression by enhancing C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, PU.1, and c-Jun expression. Considering that C/EBPδ was reported to be a tumor suppressor gene (41Huang A.M. Montagna C. Sharan S. Ni Y. Ried T. Sterneck E.

Hofmann W.K. Tidow N. Ehrich M. van den Boom D. Koschmieder S. Berdel W.E. Serve H. Müller-Tidow C. Blood. 2007; 109: 3895-3905Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), we analyzed the same promoter region (−370 to −20) after EPA conditioning of U937 cells. We found a site-specific CpG demethylation that was a determinant for the binding activity of Sp1 transcription factor to induce C/EBPδ gene expression. Stearic acid (18:0; SA), oleic acid (18:1, n-9; OA), linoleic acid (18:2, n-6; LA), α-linolenic acid (18:3, n-3; LNA), arachidonic acid (20:4, n-6; AA), eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5, n-3; EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (22:6, n-3; DHA), bovine serum albumin fraction V (BSA; fatty acid-free), and 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine were from Sigma. A stock solution of each fatty acid (5 or 10 mm) was prepared by diluting the free fatty acid in ethanol and precipitating it with the addition of NaOH (final concentration, 0.25 m). The precipitate was dried under nitrogen, reconstituted with 0.9% (w/v) NaCl, and stirred at room temperature for 10 min with defatted BSA (final concentration, 10% (w/v) in 0.15 m NaCl). Each solution was adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH and stored in aliquots at −20 °C protected from light under nitrogen. The fatty acid/BSA molar ratio was 3:1 or 6:1. The human promonocytic cell line U937 (CRL-1593.2) obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified incubator aerated with 5% CO2. U937 cells were seeded at a density of 0.3 × 106 cells/ml for all experiments. Cells were incubated with fatty acid/BSA solutions at the indicated concentrations and times. U937 cells were treated with fatty acids for 24 h (50–200 μm final concentration) and analyzed by flow cytometry as indicated below. After washing, the 200 × g cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic PI solution (50 μg ml−1 in 0.1% sodium citrate plus 0.1% Triton X-100; Sigma). The samples were placed overnight in the dark at 4 °C, and the PI fluorescence of individual nuclei was measured using an EPICS XL-MCLTM flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Miami, FL). Analysis of apoptosis was performed as described by Nicoletti et al. (44Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4414) Google Scholar), and data were processed by an Intercomp computer and analyzed with SYSTEM IITM software (Beckman Coulter, Inc.). The cell cycle was analyzed by measuring DNA-bound PI fluorescence in the orange-red fluorescence channel (FL2) through a 585/42-nm bandpass filter with linear amplification. Analysis of distribution profiles was performed with ModFit LT software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME) to determine fractions of the population in each phase of the cell cycle (G0/G1, S, G2/M). At least 15,000 events were collected for each sample. Cells were gated on FL2-area versus FL2-width plots to exclude aggregates and debris from analysis (45Gerashchenko B.I. Azzam E.I. Howell R.W. Cytometry A. 2004; 61: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Intact U937 cells were recovered after treatment with 100 μm fatty acids, resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, and identified by forward and right angle (side) light scatter using the same flow cytometer equipped with a 15-milliwatt argon ion laser (488 nm). Cell viability was determined by counting triplicate samples for trypan blue dye-excluding cells. Triplicate samples of 1 × 105 U937 cells suspended in 200 μl of RPMI 1640 medium were cultured in the presence or absence of 100 μm fatty acids for 24 h. [3H]thymidine (specific activity, 6.7 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the cultures at 2.5 μCi/well. After a 4-h incubation, cells were harvested with a multiple suction-filtration apparatus (Mash II) on a fiberglass filter (BioWhittaker) and counted in a β counter apparatus (Packard Instrument Co.). Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. cDNA was prepared by using the QuantiTect reverse transcription kit (Qiagen). Quantitative gene expression analysis was performed using an Mx3000PTM Real-Time PCR System with Brilliant® SYBR® Green qPCR Master Mix (Stratagene) and ROX as the reference dye. Quantitative PCRs were performed under conditions standardized for each primer. To minimize variability, every time point was investigated with four replicates, and the amplification of three independent treatments was performed. The following primers were used for real time qPCR analysis: C/EBPαfor (5′-AAGAACAGCAACGAGTAC-3′), C/EBPαrev (5′-GTCATTGTCACTGGTCAG-3′), C/EBPβfor (5′-AGCGACGAGTACAAGATC-3′), C/EBPβrev (5′-TGCTCCACCTTCTTCTGC-3′), C/EBPδfor (5′-CATGTACGACGAGAG-3′), C/EBPδrev (5′-GTGATTGCTGTTGAAGAGG-3′), PU.1for (5′-GACAGGCAGCAAGAAGAAG-3′), PU.1rev (5′-TTGGACGAGAACTGGAAGG-3′), c-junfor (5′-CTTATGGCTACAGTAACC-3′), c-junrev (5′-TTGCTGGACTGGATTATC-3′), M-CSF receptorfor (5′-GTTCTGCTGCTCCTGCTG-3′), and M-CSF receptorrev (5′-CGTTGCTCCTGGCTTCAC-3′). Human hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase-encoding gene mRNA was the housekeeping gene. The ΔΔCt method was used to determine modulation of the gene of interest (46Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (120901) Google Scholar). U937 cells were cultured for 24 h in standard conditions or with fatty acid (100 μm final concentration). For 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine treatment, the compound was added every day for 2 and 5 days (1 μm final concentration). Protein samples from total cell lysates (50 μg) were subjected to electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Protran, Schleicher and Schuell Italia S.r.l.), and probed using the following antibodies: anti-C/EBPα (14AA) sc-61, anti-C/EBPβ (C-19) sc-150, anti-C/EBPδ (C-22) sc-151, and anti-c-Jun (N) sc-45 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-PU.1 (9G7) 2258 and M-CSF receptor 3152 from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using the ECL assay (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instruction. An anti-β-tubulin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) was used to normalize the amount of the samples analyzed. Images were acquired using the VersaDoc Imaging System, and signals were quantified using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). ChIP assays were performed on U937 cells grown in standard conditions or with 100 μm OA or 100 μm EPA for 24 h using the EZ-ChIP kit in accordance with the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Millipore-Upstate). Briefly, after cross-linking with 1% formaldehyde and quenching with 125 mm glycine, cells were recovered, resuspended in SDS lysis buffer in the presence of protease inhibitors, and sonicated to obtained 200–1000-bp chromatin fragments. Aliquots of the fragmented chromatin corresponding to about 106 cells were precleared with protein G-agarose. The precleared chromatin (1%) was kept as “input,” and the residual was incubated overnight with the following antibodies: anti-C/EBPα (sc-61X), anti-CEBPβ (sc-150X), anti-C/EBPδ (sc-636X), and anti-PU.1 (sc-352X). Five micrograms of each antibody and 5 μg of rabbit IgG were used. Antibody-DNA complexes were captured by incubation with protein G-agarose, eluted, and subjected to cross-linking reversal. The M-CSF receptor sequence containing the C/EBP and PU.1 binding sites was amplified using Mx3000P Real-Time PCR System with Brilliant SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix. The sequences of the primers used for ChIP were as follows: forward (−87/−66), 5′-GACTGCGACCCCTCCCTCTTG-3′; reverse (+15/+36), 5′-CCTCCTCCTTGGGCTGATCCTC-3′. The relative amount of immunoprecipitated DNA fragment (123 bp) was determined based on the threshold cycle (Ct) for each PCR product. Data were quantitatively analyzed according to the formula 2−Δ[C(IP) − C(input)] − 2−Δ[C(control IgG) − C(input)] (47Schmittgen T.D. Livak K.J. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (16965) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA from unsupplemented U937 cells or U937 grown for 24 h with 100 μm OA or 100 μm EPA was extracted using a FlexiGene DNA kit in accordance with the protocol instructions (Qiagen). DNA methylation levels were quantified using the Methyl-Profiler qPCR Primer Assay for human C/EBPδ (MePH28341-1A) (SABiosciences-Qiagen) in accordance with the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Primers are designed by an optimized computer algorithm to ensure that the amplicon contains cutting sites for both methyl-sensitive and methyl-dependent enzymes and are specifically designed for analyzing the DNA methylation status of CpG islands using restriction enzyme digestion (DNA Methylation Enzyme kit MeA-03, SABiosciences-Qiagen) followed by SYBR Green-based real time PCR detection. Briefly, each genomic DNA was subjected to four separate treatments according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. (i) For the mock digest (Mo), no enzymes were added in the reaction. The product of the mock digest represented the total amount of input DNA for real time PCR detection. (ii) For the methylation-sensitive digest (Ms), cleavage was carried out with a methylation-sensitive enzyme, which digested unmethylated DNA. The remaining hypermethylated DNA was detected by real time PCR. (iii) For the methylation-dependent digest (Md), cleavage was carried out with a methylation-dependent enzyme, which digested methylated DNA. The remaining unmethylated DNA was detected by real time PCR. (iv) For the double digest (Msd), both enzymes were added, and all DNA molecules (both methylated and unmethylated) were digested. This reaction measures the background and the fraction of input DNA refractory to enzyme digestion. The four mixtures were incubated at 37 °C overnight. The enzymes were inactivated at 65 °C for 20 min. The resulting DNA was stored at −20 °C or utilized for real time PCR as described above. The specific RT-PCR program was as follows: 95 °C for 10 min and 40 cycles of 97 °C for 15 s and 72 °C for 60 s as indicated in the instruction manual. The relative amount of each DNA fraction (methylated and unmethylated) was calculated using a standard ΔCt method, normalizing the amount of DNA in each digestion against the total amount of input DNA in the mock digest. The amount of hypermethylated target DNA copies (CHM) is defined as (2−ΔCt(Ms − Mo) − CR)/(1 − CR) where CR represents the amount of target DNA copies that are resistant to enzyme digestion and is defined as 2−ΔCt(Msd − Mo). The amount of unmethylated DNA (CUM) can be determined as (2− ΔCt(Md − Mo) − CR)/(1 − CR). Genomic DNA from unsupplemented U937 cells or U937 grown for 24 h with 100 μm OA or 100 μm EPA was extracted as described above. Bisulfite modification of genomic DNA was done as described (48Dai Z.

Briefly, 1 μg of genomic DNA (50-μl volume) was denatured by using mild heat at alkaline pH by adding 3.5 μl of 3 m NaOH and incubating for 10 min at 37 °C. Immediately, 10 μl of 10 mm hydroquinone (Sigma) and 520 μl of 3 m sodium bisulfite (Sigma) were added and incubated for 12–16 h at 50 °C. Bisulfite-treated DNA was purified and eluted in 50 μl of H2O. The conversion of uracil was completed by alkaline desulfonation by adding 5 μl of 3 m NaOH and incubating at 37 °C. The treated DNA was purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit and eluted in 30 μl of H2O. Sequencing primers for bisulfite-modified DNA were designed by using the on-line program MethPrimer (available at the University of California San Diego web site). Bisulfite-modified DNA was amplified using sequencing primers for the C/EBPδ promoter. The primers for the first PCR were as follows: forward primer, 5′-GATTTTATTTTTAATTTYGAGGAGY-3′ (Y = C/T); reverse primer, 5′-AAACTATCACCTCRCTAAACCCAACCC-3′ (R = C/T). Following the initial amplification, an aliquot of the initial PCR products was used as template DNA in a nested PCR. The primers for the nested PCR were as follows: forward, 5′-GATTTTATTTTTAATTTYGAGGAGY-3′ (Y = C/T); reverse primer, 5′-CCTTTTCTAACCCCRACTAARTA-3′ (R = C/T). Nested PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 5 min and 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s followed by 10 min at 72 °C. The amplified products were confirmed by electrophoresis on an agarose gel. The nested 350-bp PCR products (−370/−20) were subcloned into pCR2.1 TA cloning vector (Invitrogen). Single clones were selected and cultured, and plasmid DNA was isolated using a GeneElute plasmid miniprep kit (Sigma) and sequenced using T7 primer at the Genechron-Ylichron S.r.l. Laboratory (Rome, Italy). Eight to 10 clones were sequenced for each sample. Nuclear extracts from U937 cells were prepared, and electrophoretic mobility shift/antibody interference assays were performed as described previously (50Hutt J.A. O'Rourke J.P. DeWille J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29123-29131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Complementary pairs of site-specific methylated and unmethylated oligonucleotides were from Integrated DNA Technologies-TEMA Ricerca (Bologna, Italy). Oligonucleotides were annealed by boiling for 5 min at 95 °C followed by cooling and end-labeled with [γ-32P]dATP (Amersham Biosciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Labeled fragments were separated from residual [γ-32P]dATP using Quick Spin columns (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The upper strand C/EBPδ promoter oligonucleotide sequence used was 5′-CGGGCGGGGCGTGCACGTCAGCCGGGGCTAG-3′ (underlined C corresponds to the C demethylated after EPA treatment). Binding reactions were carried out by mixing 20 μg of nuclear extract with 4 μl of 5× binding buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 200 mm KCl, 0.4 mm EDTA, 20 mm MgCl2, 40% glycerol, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% bromphenol blue) in a total volume of 18 μl and incubating at 4 °C for 1 h. Approximately 90,000 cpm (2 μl of ∼0.5 ng/μl) [γ-32P]dATP-labeled probe were added per reaction and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction mixtures were loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide gel (0.75 mm thick) and separated for 3 h at 200 V in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA. The gel was dried for 30 min under vacuum and exposed to autoradiograph film using an Instant Imager autoradiography system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For antibody interference assays, 3.0 μl of anti-Sp1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. sc-59) was incubated with the nuclear extract and binding buffer for 1 h at 4 °C in a total volume of 18 μl. After addition of the probe, subsequent steps were identical to those for the band shift assays. All average results are presented as mean ± S.D. One-way or two-way (where appropriate) analyses of variance with Bonferroni's post-test were used. Values were considered significant at p < 0.05. Variable effects of PUFAs on proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in leukemia cells have been reported in relation to cell line and fatty acid concentration (9Finstad H.S. Myhrstad"
https://openalex.org/W2021352148,"The physicochemical properties and dynamics of bacterial envelope, play a major role in bacterial activity. In this study, the morphological, nanomechanical and electrohydrodynamic properties of Escherichia coli K-12 mutant cells were thoroughly investigated as a function of bulk medium ionic strength using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and electrokinetics (electrophoresis). Bacteria were differing according to genetic alterations controlling the production of different surface appendages (short and rigid Ag43 adhesins, longer and more flexible type 1 fimbriae and F pilus). From the analysis of the spatially resolved force curves, it is shown that cells elasticity and turgor pressure are not only depending on bulk salt concentration but also on the presence/absence and nature of surface appendage. In 1 mM KNO3, cells without appendages or cells surrounded by Ag43 exhibit large Young moduli and turgor pressures (∼700–900 kPa and ∼100–300 kPa respectively). Under similar ionic strength condition, a dramatic ∼50% to ∼70% decrease of these nanomechanical parameters was evidenced for cells with appendages. Qualitatively, such dependence of nanomechanical behavior on surface organization remains when increasing medium salt content to 100 mM, even though, quantitatively, differences are marked to a much smaller extent. Additionally, for a given surface appendage, the magnitude of the nanomechanical parameters decreases significantly when increasing bulk salt concentration. This effect is ascribed to a bacterial exoosmotic water loss resulting in a combined contraction of bacterial cytoplasm together with an electrostatically-driven shrinkage of the surface appendages. The former process is demonstrated upon AFM analysis, while the latter, inaccessible upon AFM imaging, is inferred from electrophoretic data interpreted according to advanced soft particle electrokinetic theory. Altogether, AFM and electrokinetic results clearly demonstrate the intimate relationship between structure/flexibility and charge of bacterial envelope and propensity of bacterium and surface appendages to contract under hypertonic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2081595348,"The transcription factor p53 plays a critical role in maintaining homeostasis as it relates to cellular growth, proliferation, and metabolism. In an effort to identify novel p53 target genes, a microarray approach was utilized to identify DHRS3 (also known as retSDR1) as a robust candidate gene. DHRS3 is a highly conserved member of the short chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily with a reported role in lipid and retinoid metabolism. Here, we demonstrate that DHRS3 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein that is shuttled to the ER via an N-terminal endoplasmic reticulum targeting signal. One important function of the ER is synthesis of neutral lipids that are packaged into lipid droplets whose biogenesis occurs from ER-derived membranes. DHRS3 is enriched at focal points of lipid droplet budding where it also localizes to the phospholipid monolayer of ER-derived lipid droplets. p53 promotes lipid droplet accumulation in a manner consistent with DHRS3 enrichment in the ER. As a p53 target gene, the observations of Dhrs3 location and potential function provide novel insight into an unexpected role for p53 in lipid droplet dynamics with implications in cancer cell metabolism and obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2021112252,"The RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase Siah2 is implicated in control of diverse cellular biological events, including MAPK signaling and hypoxia. Here we demonstrate that Siah2 is subject to regulation by the deubiquitinating enzyme USP13. Overexpression of USP13 increases Siah2 stability by attenuating its autodegradation. Consequently, the ability of Siah2 to target its substrates prolyl hydroxylase 3 and Spry2 (Sprouty2) for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation is attenuated. Conversely, inhibition of USP13 expression with corresponding shRNA decreases the stability of both Siah2 and its substrate Spry2. Thus, USP13 limits Siah2 autodegradation and its ubiquitin ligase activity against its target substrates. Strikingly, the effect of USP13 on Siah2 is not mediated by its isopeptidase activity: mutations in its ubiquitin-binding sequences positioned within the ubiquitin-specific processing protease and ubiquitin-binding domains, but not within putative catalytic sites, abolish USP13 binding to and effect on Siah2 autodegradation and targeted ubiquitination. Notably, USP13 expression is attenuated in melanoma cells maintained under hypoxia, thereby relieving Siah2 inhibition and increasing its activity under low oxygen levels. Significantly, on melanoma tissue microarray, high nuclear expression of USP13 coincided with high nuclear expression of Siah2. Overall, this study identifies a new layer of Siah2 regulation mediated by USP13 binding to ubiquitinated Siah2 protein with a concomitant inhibitory effect on its activity under normoxia.

The UBP domain of USP13 harbors a catalytic site, a zinc finger domain, and two UBA domains. Sequence alignment of USP13 and other UBA-containing proteins revealed significant homology with the DNA repair protein Rad23 and the E3 ligase Cbl-b. Interestingly, overexpression of the UBA domain of Cbl-b stabilized ubiquitinated Siah1 (20Davies G.C. Ettenberg S.A. Coats A.O. Mussante M. Ravichandran S. Collins J. Nau M.M. Lipkowitz S. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7104-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).Similar to other thiol proteases, USP13 contains consensus cysteines and histidines, which likely function in catalysis. Whereas USP5 is implicated as a specialized deubiquitinating enzyme responsible for disassembly of unanchored polyubiquitin chains in vivo (19Reyes-Turcu F.E. Horton J.R. Mullally J.E. Heroux A. Cheng X. Wilkinson K.D. Cell. 2006; 124: 1197-1208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), the function of USP13 is unknown. Although USP13 contains all four putative ubiquitin-binding domains present in USP5, it has not been shown to hydrolyze polyubiquitin (21Catic A. Fiebiger E. Korbel G.A. Blom D. Galardy P.J. Ploegh H.L. PLoS One. 2007; 2: e679Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) but rather serves as a protease for ISG15, whereby it reduces ISGylation (21Catic A. Fiebiger E. Korbel G.A. Blom D. Galardy P.J. Ploegh H.L. PLoS One. 2007; 2: e679Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Little is known about the substrate specificity of USP13.We show here that USP13 binds to Siah2 primarily through its UBA domains, thereby increasing Siah2 stability while attenuating its activity. Notably, we observed that reduced USP13 expression, as seen in melanoma cell lines under hypoxia, contributes to increased Siah2 activity.DISCUSSIONRING finger E3 ubiquitin ligases are known for their capacity to autoubiquitinate, which limits their availability to ubiquitinate target substrates. Evidence for post-translational modification of E3 ligases and the effect of deubiquitinating enzymes has been demonstrated for the Mdm2-MdmX-Hausp-p53 complex (32Brooks C.L. Gu W. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 307-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate the effect of the deubiquinating factor USP13 on Siah2 stability and E3 ligase activity our finding reveals that USP13 binding to ubiquitinated Siah2 attenuates Siah2 self-degradation and increases Siah2 stability. Consequently, Siah2 ability to ubiquitinate substrate proteins is reduced, as demonstrated for Spry2 and PHD3, which represent substrates that bind to Siah2 directly or through an adaptor protein, respectively. Notably, increased Siah2 expression seen following USP13 expression coincides with increased expression of its substrates; conversely, USP13 inhibition reduces expression of Siah2 and its substrates. Overall, these findings point to an inverse correlation between Siah2 expression and activity, with the more active form of Siah2 equally potent against its substrates and itself. One would expect that additional factors govern whether Siah2 targets itself or other substrates. For example, MdmX and Daxx are implicated in control of Mdm2/Hausp regulation of p53 or Mdm2 autodegradation (32Brooks C.L. Gu W. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 307-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar).Significantly, USP13 expression is reduced in cells subjected to hypoxia, thereby relieving Siah2 inhibition and increasing its activity. Notably, this change was identified in several melanoma cell lines but not in 293 or HeLa cells, suggesting that control of USP13 and concomitant effects on Siah2 under hypoxia are cell type and tissue-specific. One would expect that physiological or pathological conditions attenuating USP13 expression coincide with elevated Siah2 activity. Indeed, analysis of TMA consisting of over 500 melanoma tumors identified that tumors with high nuclear expression of USP13 also exhibited high expression of Siah2. These findings identify a physiological role for USP13 in the regulation of Siah2 expression. Co-expression of Siah2 and USP13 in nuclei is likely to result in a less active form of Siah, given our finding that USP13 attenuates Siah2 ubiquitin ligase activity while increasing it stability. At the same time, Siah2 expression in cytosol may not be detected given its higher activity, which also limits its stability.Notably, Siah2 regulation by USP13 does not require USP13 isopeptidase activity: mutation of three putative USP13 catalytic sites had no effect on Siah2. Of note, we have observed that the same mutations attenuate the effect of USP13 on Skp2 (25Chen M. Gutierrez G.J. Ronai Z.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 9119-9124Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Instead, mutation of residues contacting ubiquitin in the zinc finger UBP domain and in the USP13 UBA domains (based on homology with USP5) effectively attenuated the ability of USP13 to affect Siah2. Proteins containing a UBA domain reportedly interact with ubiquitin. Interestingly, the UBA domain of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl-b shows high homology with the USP13 UBA domain, can bind Siah1, inhibiting its degradation (20Davies G.C. Ettenberg S.A. Coats A.O. Mussante M. Ravichandran S. Collins J. Nau M.M. Lipkowitz S. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7104-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, the UbL-UBA protein hHR23 reportedly binds to the E3 ligase mdm2 through its UBA domain and blocks p53 degradation (33Brignone C. Bradley K.E. Kisselev A.F. Grossman S.R. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4121-4129Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).How binding of USP13 to ubiquitin chains conjugated to Siah2 affect its autodegradation and targeted ubiquitination requires further study. Such associations likely impede Siah2 recognition by the proteasome, preventing its degradation. Binding of USP13 to ubiquitinated Siah may also cause structural changes that attenuate ubiquitin transfer to substrates. Notably, USP13 association with ubiquitinated Siah2 does not interfere with Siah2 binding to its substrates, suggesting that targeted ubiquitination might be affected because of altered conformation of this complex. The possibility that ubiquitinated Siah2 may need to be removed before it can elicit ubiquitination of its substrates cannot be excluded.Overall, the present study identifies a physiologically relevant mechanism for control of the ubiquitin ligase Siah2 by USP13. Reduced USP13 expression under hypoxia alleviates its inhibition of Siah2, enhancing Siah2 autodegradation and targeted ubiquitination. The USP13 effect on Siah2 is mediated via USP13 ubiquitin-binding domains, which recognize ubiquitinated Siah2. USP13 control of Siah2 also reveals an inverse correlation between Siah2 expression and activity. IntroductionSiah proteins are RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligases implicated in the ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of substrate molecules, which also limit their own availability through self-ubiquitination and degradation (1Hu G.

Siah was first identified in Drosophila melanogaster as seven in absentia (sina), which regulates formation of the R7 photoreceptor through control of tramtrack stability (4Li S. Li Y. Carthew R.W.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4153-4162Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Three murine Siah genes (Siah1a, Siah1b, and Siah2) share significant homology with the two human (SIAH1 and SIAH2) orthologues (6Della N.G. Senior P.V. Bowtell D.D.

Genomics. 1997; 46: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).Siah2 is an important regulator of pathways activated under stress and hypoxia. Among substrates reportedly regulated by Siah under these conditions are TRAF2, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, Spry2 (Sprouty2), and two of the three prolyl hydroxylases (8Habelhah H. Frew I.J.

Given the role of PHD proteins as oxygen sensors and regulators of HIF1α, the master transcription factor responding to hypoxia, Siah is implicated in the control of hypoxia, particularly within the range of 2–6% oxygen at which PHD proteins retain sufficient activity (11Appelhoff R.J.

The hemagglutinin (HA) envelope protein is the primary target for subunit vaccine development. Methodology/Principal Findings We used baculovirus-insect cell expression to obtain trimeric recombinant HA (rHA) proteins from two HPAI H5N1 viruses. We investigated trimeric rHA protein immunogenicity in mice via immunizations, and found that the highest levels of neutralizing antibodies resulted from coupling with a PELC/CpG adjuvant. We also found that the combined use of trimeric rHA proteins with (a) an inactivated H5N1 vaccine virus, or (b) a recombinant adenovirus encoding full-length HA sequences for prime-boost immunization, further improved antibody responses against homologous and heterologous H5N1 virus strains. Data from cross-clade prime-boost immunization regimens indicate that sequential immunization with different clade HA antigens increased antibody responses in terms of total IgG level and neutralizing antibody titers. Conclusion/Significance Our findings suggest that the use of trimeric rHA in prime-boost vaccine regimens represents an alternative strategy for recombinant H5N1 vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W2008610631,"Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease in later life. Early structural and functional changes in the cardiovascular system after IUGR may contribute to its pathogenesis. We tested the hypothesis that IUGR leads to primary myocardial and vascular alterations before the onset of hypertension. A rat IUGR model of maternal protein restriction during gestation was used. Dams were fed low protein (LP; casein 8.4%) or isocaloric normal protein diet (NP; casein 17.2%). The offspring was reduced to six males per litter. Immunohistochemical and real-time PCR analyses were performed in myocardial and vascular tissue of neonates and animals at day 70 of life. In the aortas of newborn IUGR rats expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) was induced 3.2-fold. At day 70 of life, the expression of collagen I was increased 5.6-fold in aortas of IUGR rats. In the hearts of neonate IUGR rats, cell proliferation was more prominent compared to controls. At day 70 the expression of osteopontin was induced 7.2-fold. A 3- to 7-fold increase in the expression of the profibrotic cytokines TGF-β and CTGF as well as of microfibrillar matrix molecules was observed. The myocardial expression and deposition of collagens was more prominent in IUGR animals compared to controls at day 70. In the low-protein diet model, IUGR leads to changes in the expression patterns of profibrotic genes and discrete structural abnormalities of vessels and hearts in adolescence, but, with the exception of CTGF, not as early as at the time of birth. Invasive and non-invasive blood pressure measurements confirmed that IUGR rats were normotensive at the time point investigated and that the changes observed occurred independently of an increased blood pressure. Hence, altered matrix composition of the vascular wall and the myocardium may predispose IUGR animals to cardiovascular disease later in life."

Using small angle neutron scattering combined with contrast variation, we have determined the first low resolution structure of a bacterial Slc26 protein without spectral contribution from the detergent.

https://openalex.org/W2109837376,"Protein folding and unfolding are complex phenomena, and it is accepted that multidomain proteins generally follow multiple pathways. Maltose-binding protein (MBP) is a large (a two-domain, 370-amino acid residue) bacterial periplasmic protein involved in maltose uptake. Despite the large size, it has been shown to exhibit an apparent two-state equilibrium unfolding in bulk experiments. Single-molecule studies can uncover rare events that are masked by averaging in bulk studies. Here, we use single-molecule force spectroscopy to study the mechanical unfolding pathways of MBP and its precursor protein (preMBP) in the presence and absence of ligands. Our results show that MBP exhibits kinetic partitioning on mechanical stretching and unfolds via two parallel pathways: one of them involves a mechanically stable intermediate (path I) whereas the other is devoid of it (path II). The apoMBP unfolds via path I in 62% of the mechanical unfolding events, and the remaining 38% follow path II. In the case of maltose-bound MBP, the protein unfolds via the intermediate in 79% of the cases, the remaining 21% via path II. Similarly, on binding to maltotriose, a ligand whose binding strength with the polyprotein is similar to that of maltose, the occurrence of the intermediate is comparable (82% via path I) with that of maltose. The precursor protein preMBP also shows a similar behavior upon mechanical unfolding. The percentages of molecules unfolding via path I are 53% in the apo form and 68% and 72% upon binding to maltose and maltotriose, respectively, for preMBP. These observations demonstrate that ligand binding can modulate the mechanical unfolding pathways of proteins by a kinetic partitioning mechanism. This could be a general mechanism in the unfolding of other large two-domain ligand-binding proteins of the bacterial periplasmic space."

It is not known whether increases in the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous transmission and the increase in evoked release share a common presynaptic mechanism. Numerous mechanisms could contribute to PTP.

PKC inhibitors have highly variable effects on PTP: at the same synapse, different PKC inhibitors disrupt PTP to very different extents (Lee et al., 2008Lee J.S. Kim M.H. Ho W.K. Lee S.H.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 7945-7953Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These findings have cast doubt on the involvement of PKC in PTP. If PKC is involved in PTP, identifying which PKC isoform mediates PTP is of fundamental importance. Is it a classical, calcium-sensitive PKC isoform such as PKCα, PKCβ, or PKCγ, or one of the eight calcium-insensitive isoforms? The involvement of calcium-sensitive PKCs would be compatible with PKC being a sensor of calcium according to the residual calcium hypothesis, whereas if calcium-insensitive PKC isoforms regulate PTP, tetanic stimulation would have to elevate presynaptic DAG or act through some unidentified pathway, and another presynaptic calcium sensor would need to respond to residual calcium. At the calyx of Held, calcium-insensitive PKCs have been implicated (Saitoh et al., 2001Saitoh N. Hori T. Takahashi T. Activation of the epsilon isoform of protein kinase C in the mammalian nerve terminal.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 14017-14021Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These results suggest that if PKC plays a role in PTP, it does not serve as a calcium sensor. Here we use knockout animals to examine the roles of PKCα and PKCβ in tetanus-induced enhancement of evoked and spontaneous transmission, and phorbol-ester-mediated enhancement at the calyx of Held synapse, where these forms of plasticity have been thoroughly characterized in wild-type animals (Habets and Borst, 2005Habets R.L.

Protein kinase c increases the apparent affinity of the release machinery to Ca2+ by enhancing the release machinery downstream of the Ca2+ sensor.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7928-7936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We find that PKCα and PKCβ are both present at the calyx of Held. In PKCα/β double knockout animals, the calyx of Held is devoid of all calcium-dependent PKCs, as PKCγ is not present at this synapse (Saitoh et al., 2001Saitoh N. Hori T. Takahashi T. Activation of the epsilon isoform of protein kinase C in the mammalian nerve terminal.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 14017-14021Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In PKCα/β double knockouts, basal properties of synaptic transmission are normal but 80% of PTP is eliminated. PKCα and PKCβ produce PTP primarily by increasing the size of the readily releasable pool of vesicles that fuse in response to brief high-frequency stimulation; they do not facilitate presynaptic calcium currents. The small PTP remaining in double knockout animals is mediated in part by an increase in mEPSC amplitude and in part by a mechanism involving myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). In contrast to PTP, the increase in the mEPSC frequency following tetanic stimulation does not depend on PKCα/β, suggesting that tetanic enhancement of evoked and spontaneous release are mediated by different mechanisms. Finally, phorbol ester-dependent enhancement is greatly reduced in slices from double knockout animals. These findings establish the crucial role of calcium-sensitive PKCs in the enhancement of evoked synaptic responses induced by either tetanic stimulation or phorbol esters. We used immunohistochemistry to determine the localization of PKCα and PKCβ within the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) (Figure 1). Slices were colabeled with antibodies to either PKCα or PKCβ (green) and to the vesicular glutamate transporter vGlut1 to label glutamate-containing synaptic vesicles within presynaptic terminals (red). vGlut1 labeling was used to identify the calyces of Held, the large presynaptic terminals that provide a synaptic contact between globular bushy cells in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus and the principle neurons in the MNTB. In slices from wild-type mice, antibody labeling for PKCα and PKCβ overlapped with vGlut1 labeling, consistent with presynaptic localization of these kinases at the calyx of Held synapse. No labeling was detected in MNTB primary neurons. Anti-PKCα antibody labeling appeared less restricted than anti-PKCβ antibody labeling, suggesting that PKCα might also be present in other structures, in addition to the presynaptic terminals. In PKCα−/− mice, labeling with antibodies to PKCβ and vGlut1 was similar to that observed in wild-type animals, but labeling with antibodies to PKCα was absent. Similarly, in PKCβ−/− mice, labeling with antibodies to PKCα and vGlut1 was similar to that observed in wild-type animals, but labeling associated with antibodies to PKCβ was absent. In PKCα−/−β−/− mice no labeling was observed with antibodies to PKCα or PKCβ, but vGlut1 labeling was similar to that observed in wild-type littermate animals. These findings indicate that the targeted PKC isoforms are eliminated in knockout animals without noticeably affecting the synaptic distribution of vGlut1. They also suggest that the presence of one isoform is not required for the proper subcellular localization of the other. We investigated the role of calc"
https://openalex.org/W1964138596,"The release of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles after action potentials occurs with discrete time courses: submillisecond phasic release that can be desynchronized by activity followed by “delayed release” that persists for tens of milliseconds. Delayed release has a well-established role in synaptic integration, but it is not clear whether desynchronization of phasic release has physiological consequences. At the climbing fiber to Purkinje cell synapse, the synchronous fusion of multiple vesicles is critical for generating complex spikes. Here we show that stimulation at physiological frequencies drives the temporal dispersion of vesicles undergoing multivesicular release, resulting in a slowing of the EPSC on the millisecond timescale. Remarkably, these changes in EPSC kinetics robustly alter the Purkinje cell complex spike in a manner that promotes axonal propagation of individual spikelets. Thus, desynchronization of multivesicular release enhances the precise and efficient information transfer by complex spikes."

Considerable effort has been devoted to understanding the multiple mechanisms that combine to regulate AID and A3G activity. First, the transcription of each of these genes is tissue-specific, with AID being expressed predominantly in B lymphocytes and A3G in most cell types (9Koning F.A. Newman E.N. Kim E.Y. Kunstman K.J.

Phosphorylation of the homologous residue in A3G, threonine 32, also has functional consequences by rendering the protein less susceptible to HIV-1 Vif-induced ubiquitylation and degradation(34Shirakawa K.

Here, we provide evidence in support of a new role for threonine/serine phosphorylation in directly suppressing the intrinsic DNA deaminase activity of AID and A3G. Extensive conservation of this particular residue suggests that phospho-regulation may extend to most other DNA deaminase superfamily members. pEGFP-N3-A3G and pEGFP-N3-AID have been described (36Stenglein M.D. Harris R.S.

The retroviral vector pMX-EGFP was constructed by subcloning EGFP from plasmid pEGFP-N3 (Clontech) into pMX-PIE (a gift from V. Barreto) using EcoRI/NotI. pMX-AID-IRES-EGFP was generated by first amplifying untagged AID from pEGFP-N3-AID by PCR using primers 5′-GCT AGC GCC ACC ATG GAC AGC CT and 5′-CCT GCA GGT CAA AGT CCC AAA GTA. The insert was cut with NheI/SbfI and ligated into pCSII-IRES-EGFP (a gift from N. Somia). The AID-IRES-EGFP insert was then PCR-amplified using primers 5′-GAA TTC ATG GAC AGC CTC TTG ATG AAC and 5′-CCA CAT AGC GTA AAA GGA GCA AC, cut using EcoRI/NotI, and ligated into pMX-PIE. The MLV amphotrophic envelope vector pRK5-10A1 and the HIV-1 accessory vector ΔNRF were generous gifts from N. Somia. The MLV accessory vector pMD-OGP was provided by F. Randow.

The Escherichia coli expression constructs pTrc99a-AID-GST and pTrc99a-A3G-GST were generated by subcloning AID from pEGFP-N3-AID or A3G from pEGFP-N3-A3G into pTrc99a-GST using NcoI/SalI. The untagged bacterial expression plasmids pTrc99a-hAID and pTrc99a-A3G have been described (37MacDuff D.A. Demorest Z.L. Harris R.S.

BW310 E. coli cells were transformed with pTrc99a-AID or pTrc99a-A3G expression constructs and plated on ampicillin-containing media. Four individual colonies were picked and seeded into media containing 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. After shaking overnight at 37 °C, the cultures were plated on ampicillin media to obtain viable cell counts and to 100 μg/ml rifampicin-containing media for mutational frequency. AID and A3G expression levels were determined by Western blot analysis using antibodies against AID (EK25G9, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) or A3G (#10201 rabbit anti-A3G polyclonal serum provided by J. Lingappa through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program). Protein samples for AID/A3G were prepared by growing 500-ml cultures of BL21 E. coli cells transformed with pTrc99a-GST, pTrc99a-AID-GST, pTrc99a-A3G-GST, or mutants of AID/A3G. The cultures were centrifuged, and the cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.9), 200 mm NaCl, 50 μm ZnCl2, complete protease inhibitors (Roche)). After centrifugation (17,000 × g, 20 min), clarified lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with glutathione-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). The resin was washed four times with lysis buffer, and purified protein was eluted by cleavage with tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease (Invitrogen). For preparation of A3G from human cells, pcDNA3.1-A3G-myc-his or mutants thereof were transfected into HEK293T cells cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) and 10% FBS (Hyclone) using TransIT-LT1 reagent (Mirus). After 48 h, cells were lysed in buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2 1 mm ZnCl, 10% glycerol) and bound to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen). The beads were washed, and purified protein was eluted using imidazole (250 μm), as described (43Shlyakhtenko L.S. Lushnikov A.Y. Li M. Lackey L. Harris R.S. Lyubchenko Y.L. J. Biol.

Protein samples prepared from E. coli as above were used for AID DNA binding reactions. 6 pmol of purified protein was diluted serially 1:2 and mixed with 0.5 pmol 32P-labeled oligo (5′-ATT ATT ATT ATT CCA ATG GAT TTA TTT ATT TWR CTA TTT ATT T) in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 10% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm EDTA, 500 μm DTT). Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C before separation on a 7% Tris borate-EDTA acrylamide gel. The gel was dried and imaged by phosphoimager (Storm, Molecular Dynamics). Protein samples purified from human cells from the above were used for A3G DNA binding reactions. 25 pmol of purified protein was diluted serially 1:2, and each dilution was mixed with 1 pmol fluorescein-labeled oligo (5′-ATT ATT ATT ATT CCA ATG GAT TTA TTT ATT TAT TTA TTT ATT T-fluorescein) in binding buffer. The reactions were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C before separation on a 7% Tris borate-EDTA acrylamide gel. The free and bound oligos were then detected by fluorescence imaging (FLA-5000, Fuji). Protein samples purified from human cells as above were used for A3G deaminase activity reactions. Starting with 1.2 pmol purified protein, 2-fold serial dilutions were made and mixed with 1 pmol of substrate oligo (5′-ATT ATT ATT ATT CCA ATG GAT TTA TTT ATT TAT TTA TTT ATT T-fluorescein), 0.1 μg/μl RNase A (Qiagen), and 0.001 units/μl uracil DNA glycosylase (NEB). The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, and then NaOH was added to 100 μm before incubating at 90 °C for another 30 min. The reactions were separated on a 16% Tris/urea-acrylamide gel and visualized by fluorescence imaging (FLA-5000, Fuji). For steady-state A3G and AID localization, pEGFP-N3-A3G, pEGFP-N3-AID, or mutants thereof were transfected into HeLa cells grown in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone). 48 h later, the cellular localization was determined by fluorescence microscopy (Deltavision). For AID import activity, leptomycin-B (20 ng/ml) was added 2 h prior to imaging as above. CEM-SS and CEM-GFP (courtesy of M. Malim) were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone). Stable cell lines expressing pEGFP-N3, pEGFP-N3-A3G, or mutants were generated in the permissive cell line CEM-SS by electroporating linearized DNA and selecting for stable integrants with 1 mg/ml G418 (Mediatech) as described (38Albin J.S. Haché G. Hultquist J.F. Brown W.L. Harris R.S. J. Virol. 2010; 84: 10209-10219Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Clones were confirmed to have similar expression levels by Western blot analysis using an antibody against A3G (rabbit polyclonal raised against a C-terminal peptide). Virus was produced by transfecting HIV-1 provirus using TransIT-LT1 (Mirus) HEK293T cells maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone). 48 h after transfection, virus-containing supernatants were filtered with a 0.45-μm filter. Viruses were then titered using the CEM-GFP reporter cell line as described (38Albin J.S. Haché G. Hultquist J.F. Brown W.L. Harris R.S. J. Virol. 2010; 84: 10209-10219Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Spreading infections were initiated by adding virus to CEM-SS stable cell lines at a multiplicity of infection of 0.05. Supernatants from infected cultures were collected at 2- to 4-day intervals and added to CEM-GFP. After 48-hours, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and analyzed for GFP expression by flow cytometry (Quanta SC MPL, Beckman Coulter). Procedures for the detection of A3G in producer cells and viral particles have been described (44Larue R.S. Lengyel J. Jónsson S.R. Andrésdóttir V. Harris R.S. J.

Ex vivo CSR assays were conducted by purifying resting B-cells from spleen by magnetic sorting (130-090-862, Miltenyi Biotec). Isolated B-cells were then cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 ng/ml IL-4, and 50 μg/ml LPS. After 48 h, the media were replaced with transducing viral supernatant supplemented with 20 mm HEPES and 16 μg/ml polybrene and centrifuged (600 × g, 2 h, 30 °C). The cells were then resuspended into fresh media containing IL-4 and LPS and cultured for 4 days. Efficiency of switching to IgG1 was determined by staining with anti-IgG1-PE (BD Biosciences) and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCanto II, BD Biosciences).

Periaswamy B. Mathivanan S. Reddy R. Tattikota S.G. Pandey A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 285-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Notably, nearly all AID/A3 family members have homologous threonine or serine residues at this exact position (Fig. 1C). Rare exceptions are only apparent in specific mammalian lineages (carnivores and rodents) or in redundant or inactive domains (most alleles of human A3H are unstable) (47OhAinle M. Kerns J.A. Li M.M.

In the catalytic domain of A3G, the first arginine in this motif (Arg-215) is located adjacent to the catalytic glutamate, and it has been implicated in binding substrate single-stranded DNA (5Chen K.M.

Taken together, these observations, and particularly the high level of conservation and the structural positioning next to the active site, suggest that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation may serve as a posttranslational switch that helps control the DNA deaminase activity of these mutagenic enzymes. AID-Thr-27 and A3G-Thr-32 can be phosphorylated by PKA (31Basu U. Chaudhuri J. Alpert C. Dutt S. Ranganath S. Li G. Schrum J.P. Manis J.P. Alt F.W.

To determine whether these observations extend to A3G-Thr-218, we asked whether recombinant PKA could phosphorylate a peptide representing the soluble loop in which this residue resides, VRGRHET218YLCYE. We found that PKA could readily phosphorylate this peptide but not a T218A mutant derivative that is otherwise identical (Fig. 1D). Similarly, CaMKII, which also phosphorylates R-X-X-T motifs (46Amanchy R. Periaswamy B. Mathivanan S. Reddy R. Tattikota S.G. Pandey A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 285-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), was able to phosphorylate the A3G-Thr-218 peptide but not the alanine mutant derivative. Both enzymes were also able to phosphorylate a serine in a control peptide (Kemptide). These data demonstrate that A3G-Thr-218 is a suitable substrate for at least two kinases, PKA and CaMKII. To address whether phosphorylation is capable of attenuating the DNA cytidine deaminase activity of AID and A3G, phospho-null and phospho-mimetic derivatives of these proteins were tested in an E. coli-based activity assay. The rifampicin-resistance (RifR) mutation assay has been used extensively to assess intrinsic DNA cytidine deaminase activity (41Harris R.S. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Neuberger M.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1247-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 42Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Harris R.S. Neuberger M.S. Nature. 2002; 418: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Consistent with prior reports, AID and A3G triggered 3- and 4-fold increases in the median RifR mutation frequency compared with catalytically inactive controls, AID-E58Q and A3G-E259Q (Fig. 2, A and B). In comparison, phospho-mimetic AID-T27E and A3G-T218E proteins also showed greatly reduced activity approaching background levels. Phospho-null alanine mutants showed slightly higher levels of mutator activity. Mutation of another predicted surface threonine in AID (Thr-140) or the homologous threonine in the non-catalytic N-terminal domain of A3G (Thr-32) had little effect. All proteins expressed similarly in E. coli, indicating that these data are not due to variable protein expression levels (lower panels in Fig. 2, A and B). To ask whether these observations extended to A3G purified from human cells, we used a DNA oligonucleotide deamination assay optimized to measure catalytic activity. As expected, wild-type A3G catalyzes dose-dependent cytidine-to-uridine deamination of labeled deoxy-oligonucleotide substrates, which following uracil excision and NaOH-mediated phosphodiester backbone cleavage, is detected as a shorter DNA fragment (Fig. 3, A, C, and E). As anticipated from the E. coli mutation experiments, the A3G phospho-mimetic variant T218E showed considerably lower levels of catalytic activity. Interestingly, the A3G phospho-null variant T218A showed significantly elevated levels of catalytic activity consistent with a proportion of the wild-type protein being already phosphorylated (and thereby inactivated) in HEK293T cells. Taken together, the E. coli and the purified protein activity data indicate that phosphorylation of the conserved threonine, AID-Thr-27 or A3G-Thr-218, may serve to attenuate the intrinsic DNA deaminase activity of these proteins (supported further by HEK293T cell extract data in supplemental Fig. S1). To ask whether the diminished catalytic activity of the phospho-mimetic substitution mutants is due to defective ssDNA binding, we tested the ssDNA binding ability of AID and A3G in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. A3G-myc-his used in the deaminase reactions above was used for ssDNA binding experiments. Purified protein was diluted serially, incubated with a fluorescently labeled oligo, and fractionated on a native polyacrylamide gel. As expected, A3G and the catalytic mutant E259Q bound ssDNA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3, B, D, and E) (48Iwatani Y. Takeuchi H. Strebel K. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 5992-6002Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Likewise, A3G-T218A and A3G-T218E had nearly identical ssDNA binding abilities, which were indistinguishable from the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 3, B, D, and E). Similar EMSA experiments were done with wild-type AID and mutant derivatives, but the sensitivity of the assay had to be increased by using a radiolabeled ssDNA oligo substrate. Again, the wild-type and the phospho-null and phospho-mimetic variants produced near identical mobility shifts (Fig. 3, F, G, and H). As a control to demonstrate the specificity of AID for ssDNA, an AID-R24E mutant was analyzed in parallel and shown to be defective in DNA binding. This arginin"
https://openalex.org/W2061751736,"Numerous studies have suggested that the K65R reverse transcriptase (RT) mutation develops more readily in subtype C than subtype B HIV-1. We recently showed that this discrepancy lies partly in the subtype C template coding sequence that predisposes RT to pause at the site of K65R mutagenesis. However, the mechanism underlying this observation and the elevated rates of K65R development remained unknown. Here, we report that DNA synthesis performed with subtype C templates consistently produced more K65R-containing transcripts than subtype B templates, regardless of the subtype-origin of the RT enzymes employed. These findings confirm that the mechanism involved is template-specific and RT-independent. In addition, a pattern of DNA synthesis characteristic of site-specific primer/template slippage and dislocation was only observed with the subtype C sequence. Analysis of RNA secondary structure suggested that the latter was unlikely to impact on K65R development between subtypes and that Streisinger strand slippage during DNA synthesis at the homopolymeric nucleotide stretch of the subtype C K65 region might occur, resulting in misalignment of the primer and template. Consequently, slippage would lead to a deletion of the middle adenine of codon K65 and the production of a -1 frameshift mutation, which upon dislocation and realignment of the primer and template, would lead to development of the K65R mutation. These findings provide additional mechanistic evidence for the facilitated development of the K65R mutation in subtype C HIV-1."
https://openalex.org/W2025204393,"Aminopeptidases catalyze N-terminal peptide bond hydrolysis and occupy many diverse roles across all domains of life. Here we present evidence that an M1-family aminopeptidase, PfA-M1, has been recruited to specialized roles in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. PfA-M1 is abundant in two subcellular compartments in asexual intraerythrocytic parasites; that is, the food vacuole, where the catabolism of host hemoglobin takes place, and the nucleus. A unique N-terminal extension contributes to the observed dual targeting by providing a signal peptide and putative alternate translation initiation sites. PfA-M1 exists as two major isoforms, a nuclear 120-kDa species and a processed species consisting of a complex of 68- and 35-kDa fragments. PfA-M1 is both stable and active at the acidic pH of the food vacuole lumen. Determination of steady-state kinetic parameters for both aminoacyl-β-naphthylamide and unmodified dipeptide substrates over the pH range 5.0-8.5 reveals that k(cat) is relatively insensitive to pH, whereas K(m) increases at pH values below 6.5. At the pH of the food vacuole lumen (5.0-5.5), the catalytic efficiency of PfA-M1 remains high. Consistent with the kinetic data, the affinity of peptidic competitive inhibitors is diminished at acidic pH. Together, these results support a catalytic role for PfA-M1 in the food vacuole and indicate the importance of evaluating the potency of peptidic inhibitors at physiologically relevant pH values. They also suggest a second, distinct function for this enzyme in the parasite nucleus."

This study characterizes the role of the Panx1 C-tail domain by truncating the polypeptide at residue 307 and expressing the mutant in BICR-M1Rk and HEK-293T cells. Enzymatic digestion and immunolabeling assays revealed that the Panx1T307-RFP was glycosylated primarily to the high mannose species consistent with its retention in the endoplasmic reticulum. Co-expression of Panx1T307-RFP with Panx1 followed by co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that the mutant and Panx1 could interact, whereas biotinylation assays showed that this interaction inhibited Panx1 from maturing into the Gly2 species and reaching the cell surface. Additional inhibitor studies indicated that the degradation of the mutant was via proteasomes, whereas Panx1 was degraded by lysosomes. Analysis of the pathways important in Panx1 internalization revealed partial co-distribution of Panx1 with many molecular constituents of the endocytic machinery that include clathrin, AP2, dynamin II, caveolin-1, and caveolin-2. However, co-immunoprecipitation assays together with the disruption of lipid rafts by methyl-β-cyclodextrin suggest that Panx1 does not engage this endocytic machinery. Furthermore, dominant-negative and pharmacological studies revealed that Panx1 internalization was dynamin II-independent.

In light of the broad physiological relevance of Panx1 channels, it is critical to determine the pathways and mechanisms that regulate their assembly and turnover. We and others have shown that Panx1 is N-glycosylated (14Boassa D. Ambrosi C. Qiu F. Dahl G. Gaietta G. Sosinsky G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31733-31743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 15Penuela S. Bhalla R. Gong X.Q. Cowan K.N. Celetti S.J. Cowan B.J. Bai D. Shao Q. Laird D.W. J.

Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 4313-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The significance of Panx1 glycosylation on trafficking was first explored using site-directed mutagenesis of N-linked glycosylation sites (14Boassa D. Ambrosi C. Qiu F. Dahl G. Gaietta G. Sosinsky G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31733-31743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The Panx1N254Q glycosylation-deficient mutant displayed trafficking defects suggesting that glycosylation plays a role in proper trafficking of Panx1 to the cell surface. In Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, Panx1 has been shown to rescue the delivery of the Panx1N254Q mutant to the cell surface suggesting that they co-oligomerize (17Boassa D. Qiu F. Dahl G. Sosinsky G. Cell. Commun. Adhes. 2008; 15: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, the lack of glycosylation does not perturb the ability of Panx1N254Q subunits to fold properly and intermix with Panx1. Interestingly, despite the glycosylation deficiency and the low levels of the Panx1N254Q mutant at the cell surface, the mutant was still capable of forming functional channels suitable for dye uptake (15Penuela S. Bhalla R. Gong X.Q. Cowan K.N. Celetti S.J. Cowan B.J. Bai D. Shao Q. Laird D.W. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3772-3783Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). A glycosylation-deficient mutant of zebrafish Panx1 (zfPanx1-N246K), however, reached the cell surface but displayed impaired uptake of ethidium bromide compared with wild type zfPanx1 (18Prochnow N. Hoffmann S. Vroman R. Klooster J. Bunse S. Kamermans M. Dermietzel R. Zoidl G. Neuroscience. 2009; 162: 1039-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The function of Panx1 channels has also been investigated by engineering specific point mutations in the polypeptide sequence and expressing these mutants in reference cell models. Substitution of lysines to alanines, for instance, at residues 248 or 265 in the second extracellular loop resulted in a loss of Panx1 channel function, and substitution of arginine at position 75 (in the first extracellular loop) to alanine, lysine, glutamate, or cysteine was further used to assess the inhibitory effects of ATP analogues on Panx1 channel currents (19Qiu F. Dahl G. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2009; 296: C250-C255Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, mutation of a cysteine to serine at residue 346 located within the C-terminal tail resulted in constitutively leaky channels thereby causing cell death (20Bunse S. Schmidt M. Prochnow N. Zoidl G. Dermietzel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 38444-38452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although several studies have looked at the effect of single amino acid substitutions within specific Panx1 motifs, the deletion of the entire Panx1 domains has not be studied. In this study, we were particularly interested in understanding the role of the Panx1 C terminus by investigating the trafficking and oligomeric potential of C-terminal truncated Panx1. We chose the 127-amino acid long C-terminal domain as this cytoplasmic exposed domain has previously been shown to bind actin, which provides a multifaceted role in vesicular transport, cell surface mobility, and stability of Panx1 (21Bhalla-Gehi R.

More recently, the C terminus of Panx1 was characterized as a target for caspase-3 and -7 cleavage, which resulted in a constitutively open channel (13Chekeni F.B. Elliott M.R. Sandilos J.K.

Thus, the focus of this study was also to determine whether Panx1 employs classical endocytic pathways such as clathrin and/or caveolin for its internalization. BICR-M1Rk cells, originally derived from rat mammary tumors, were a gift from Dieter Hulser, Stuttgart, Germany (22Simek J. Churko J. Shao Q. Laird D.W. J.

To create the Panx1-RFP construct, full-length Panx1 (encoding 426 amino acids) was excised from a previously engineered pEGFP-N1 vector (15Penuela S. Bhalla R. Gong X.Q. Cowan K.N. Celetti S.J.

For transfection of Panx1T307-RFP and Panx1-RFP, cells were grown overnight to 50–70% confluency in 35-mm dishes and transfected in Opti-MEM1 (Invitrogen) media containing 2 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and 5 μg of plasmid DNA. For co-expression studies, HEK-293T cells were plated in 100-mm dishes, and 7–9 μg of Panx1 were co-transfected with 10–15 μg of either Panx1T307-RFP or Panx1-RFP in Opti-MEM1 media containing 15 μl of Lipofectamine 2000. GFP-tagged WT and K44A DynII expression constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Mark A McNiven (Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, MN) and used for conducting transient transfections of BICR-M1Rk cells expressing Panx1. Cells grown in 35-mm dishes overnight to ∼50–70% confluency were transfected in Opti-MEM1 media containing 1 μg of WT or K44A DynII GTPase cDNA constructs with 2 μl of Lipofectamine 2000. Opti-MEM1 medium was replaced with complete culture media 4 h after transfection at 37 °C. Cells were immunolabeled as described previously (21Bhalla-Gehi R. Penuela S. Churko J.M. Shao Q. Laird D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 9147-9160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed using ice-cold 80% methanol and 20% acetone for 20 min at 4 °C and blocked in 2% blocking solution (bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma) in PBS) for 30 min. Cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with affinity-purified polyclonal Panx1 antibody at a concentration of 2 μg/ml, a 100-fold dilution of monoclonal anti-GM130 antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories), a 500-fold dilution of monoclonal anti-PDI antibody (StressGen), or a 200-fold dilution of polyclonal anti-RFP antibody (Abcam). Cells were incubated with goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor488 (1:500, Invitrogen) for 45 min at room temperature. Cells were rinsed with PBS, and nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 and mounted. Panx1 expressing BICR-M1Rk cells fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde were permeabilized in PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100. Because antibodies against Panx1, clathrin, and Cav-1 were all raised in rabbits, an Alexa Fluor488-conjugated Panx1 antibody was synthesized as per the manufacturer's directions (Pierce) for dual labeling of Panx1 with these markers. For immunolabeling of Panx1-expressing cells for clathrin or Cav-1, cells were first incubated with either a 200-fold dilution of polyclonal anti-clathrin heavy chain antibody (Abcam) or a 100-fold dilution of polyclonal anti-Cav-1 antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor555 (1:500, Invitrogen) for 45 min at room temperature. Thereafter, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with Panx1_488 antibody for an additional 45 min at room temperature before staining nuclei with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen). For double labeling of Panx1-expressing cells for AP2 or Cav-2, cells were first labeled with affinity-purified polyclonal Panx1 antibody at a concentration of 2 μg/ml for 1 h, followed by incubation with goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor555 (1:500, Invitrogen) for 45 min at room temperature. Next, cells were labeled with either monoclonal anti-AP2 (Sigma) or monoclonal anti-Cav-2 (BD Transduction Laboratories) at a 100-fold dilution followed by incubation with goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor488 (1:500, Invitrogen). DynII was labeled using a 50-fold dilution of anti-DynII antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h prior to using Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-goat (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch) as a secondary antibody. Immunolabeled cells were imaged using a ×63 oil objective lens mounted on a Zeiss LSM 510 META system (Zeiss, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Brefeldin A (BFA), dynasore, methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβC), lactacystin, and chloroquine were all purchased from Sigma. BICR-M1Rk and HEK-293T cells expressing Panx1T307-RFP and Panx1 were exposed to 10 μm lactacystin and 200 μm chloroquine for 20 h prior to protein extraction. Cells were treated for 20–32 h with 5 μg/ml BFA and for 1–24 h with 10 mm MβC. Dynasore treatment was used at a concentration of 40 μm, consistent with previous studies (23Gumpert A.M. Varco J.S. Baker S.M. Piehl M. Falk M.M. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 2887-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Post-treatment, cells were fixed for immunocytochemistry or lysed for immunoblotting and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting assays were performed based on our previously described protocol (21Bhalla-Gehi R. Penuela S. Churko J.M. Shao Q. Laird D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 9147-9160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1% Triton X-100 and supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (1 tablet per 10 ml of buffer, Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm NaF and 1 mm Na3VO4). Protein concentrations were measured using a BCA protein determination kit (Pierce), and 20–30 μg of total protein lysate was resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Protein samples were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using the iBlot Dry Blotting system (Invitrogen) and blocked with 5% Blotto milk (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 3% BSA (Sigma) for 1 h prior to incubating with anti-Panx1 (0.2 μg/ml), anti-RFP (1:2000, Abcam), anti-clathrin (1:1000, Abcam), anti-AP2 (1:500, Sigma), anti-DynII (1:250, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Cav-1 (1:2000) or anti-Cav-2 (1:2000 BD Transduction Laboratories), and anti-GAPDH (1:5000, Millipore) antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibody binding was detected using mouse IgG infrared dye 800 at 1:10,000 dilution (Rockland Immunochemicals) or rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor680 at 1:10,000 dilution (Invitrogen), and blots were scanned with the Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-Cor). Co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described previously (24Langlois S. Cowan K.N. Shao Q. Cowan B.J. Laird D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 912-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, 800–1000 μg of cell lysates were incubated with 10 μg/ml anti-Panx1 and 2 μg/ml specific anti-Cav-1 or anti-Cav-2 antibodies (BD Biosciences) antibodies and rocked overnight at 4 °C. The following day, 30 μl (50% slurry) of protein A-Sepharose beads were added to the lysates and incubated for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. Thereafter, beads were collected by centrifugation at 4500 rpm for 2 min and washed three times to remove any nonspecific binding. The samples were boiled for 5 min in 2× Laemmli buffer prior to resolving on 8–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and immunoblotting with specific antibodies to detect Panx1, RFP, clathrin, AP2, Cav-1, Cav-2, and DynII at concentrations mentioned above. Although primary antibodies were detected using mouse IgG IR dye 800 at 1:10,000 (Rockland Immunochemicals) or rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor680 at 1:10,000 (Invitrogen), detection of co-immunoprecipitates was also achieved using the Clean-Blot IP detection reagent (horseradish peroxidase; Pierce) as a secondary antibody at a 4000-fold dilution for 45 min to minimize the appearance of the IgG bands in some instances. Enzymatic digestion of glycan chains using peptide N-glycosidase F and endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (Endo) H was performed as described previously (16Penuela S. Bhalla R. Nag K. Laird D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 4313-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Briefly, 35 μg of HEK-293T cell lysates containing either Panx1T307-RFP or Panx1-RFP were incubated in the presence or absence of 10 units of N-glycosidase F and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C prior to immunoblotting using the RFP antibody. Similarly, for Endo H treatment, 35 μg of protein was incubated with or without 5000 units of the enzyme for 1 h at 37 °C, and samples were resolved on a 8% SDS-PAGE before transferring to nitrocellulose membranes and probing with an anti-RFP antibody. HEK-293T cells ectopically expressing either Panx1T307-RFP or Panx1-RFP were subjected to biotinylation 48 h following transfection. To prevent any potential internalization of cell surface proteins, all reagents and cell cultures were maintained on ice. Cell culture dishes were first rinsed three times with cold PBS to remove media and incubated thereafter either in PBS alone or in PBS containing 1 mg/ml of EZ-link Sulfo NHS-LC biotin (Pierce) for 20 min at 4 °C. To quench any excess biotin, cell culture dishes were first rinsed and then incubated in PBS containing 100 mm glycine for an additional 15 min at 4 °C. Proteins were then extracted from both unlabeled and biotin-labeled dishes using the SDS lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS in PBS) and quantified using a BCA protein determination kit (Pierce). 1 mg of cell lysates from biotin-labeled and unlabeled samples was incubated with 50 μl of NeutrAvidin-agarose beads (Pierce) overnight at 4 °C. The following day, beads were washed with IP lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1% Triton X-100) containing 1 mm NaF and 1 mm Na3VO4 and suspended in 2× Laemmli buffer before boiling for 5 min and resolving on the SDS-PAGE. Total protein containing 30–40 μg of lysate was simultaneously resolved on the gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed for RFP and Panx1 expression. Cells expressing wild type DynII or K44A mutant grown on glass bottom dishes were rinsed and incubated in DMEM containing 20 mm Hepes and 2 mg/ml BSA for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were incubated for 1 h in the presence of 10 μg/ml dynasore. Media were then replaced with media containing 10 μg/ml of transferrin-Alexa Fluor555 (Invitrogen), and cells were incubated for additional 45 min at 4 °C to block any uptake. Thereafter, cells were imaged either immediately (to capture 0 min of uptake) or 30–40 min after incubation at 37 °C. To characterize the biological significance of the Panx1 C-tail, we truncated Panx1 at residue 307, which is ∼10 amino acids downstream of where the fourth transmembrane domain is predicted to exit the plasma membrane. To facilitate detection of the Panx1-truncated mutant, the mutant was tagged with RFP. To validate that the RFP tag does not modify the trafficking of Panx1, we also tagged full-length Panx1 with RFP and compared it with the untagged and GFP-tagged Panx1. Because RFP-tagged Panx1 exhibited a similar trafficking and distribution profile as the untagged and GFP-tagged counterparts (supplemental Fig. 1), we employed it as a control to study the biological properties of Panx1T307-RFP. Both Panx1T307-RFP and Panx1-RFP were overexpressed in either BICR-M1Rk or HEK-293T cells, as these cell lines are devoid of endogenous Panx1 (16Penuela S. Bhalla R. Nag K. Laird D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 4313-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 21Bhalla-Gehi R. Penuela S. Churko J.M. Shao Q. Laird D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 9147-9160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The high transfection efficiency of HEK-293T cells was deemed ideal for immunoblotting experiments; however, given their small spindle morphology, large nuclei, and low cytoplasmic volume (16Penuela S. Bhalla R. Nag K. Laird D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 4313-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), they were not as suitable for immunolocalization studies as the larger BICR-M1Rk cells (supplemental Fig. 2). When Panx1T307-RFP was expressed in BICR-M1Rk cells, the mutant was found to primarily reside in intracellular compartments (Fig. 1A). In contrast, full-length Panx1-RFP was capable of trafficking and localizing to the cell surface in a relatively uniform manner (Fig. 1B). As a glycoprotein, it is well documented that Panx1 exhibits multiple banding patterns reflecting the core unglycosylated protein (Gly0), a high mannose-glycosylated species associated within the ER (Gly1), and the extensively glycosylated species that is modified in the Golgi apparatus prior to cell surface delivery (Gly2) (14Boassa D.

To address if Panx1T307-RFP also resolves as multiple species, lysates of HEK-293T wild type cells, cells overexpressing full-length Panx1 fusion proteins, and the C-tail truncated protein were subjected to immunoblotting using anti-RFP and Panx1 antibodies. Because of the fusion of RFP (∼27–30 kDa), C-tail truncated Panx1 was detected as a doublet at a molecular mass of ∼50 kDa, whereas full-length Panx1 resolved as multiple bands at ∼75–80 kDa (Fig. 1C). Consistent with our immunolabeling data (supplemental Fig. 2), the Panx1 CT-395 antibody (from here on denoted as Panx1 antibody) did not detect Panx1T307-RFP but identified full-length GFP- and RFP-tagged Panx1 (∼75–"
https://openalex.org/W2144127610,"Background In 2005 a cluster of 53 HIV-infected patients with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was detected in the Msinga sub-district, the catchment area for the Church of Scotland Hospital (CoSH) in Tugela Ferry, in KwaZulu-Natal province (KZN), South Africa. KZN is divided into 11 healthcare districts. We sought to determine the distribution of XDR TB cases in the province in relation to population density. Methods In this cross-sectional study, the KZN tuberculosis laboratory database was analysed. Results of all patients with a sputum culture positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis from January 2006 to June 2007 were included. Drug-susceptibility test results for isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, streptomycin, kanamycin and ofloxacin were available for all patients as well as the location of the hospital where their clinical diagnosis was made. Findings In total, 20858 patients attending one of 73 hospitals or their adjacent clinics had cultures positive for M. tuberculosis. Of these, 4170 (20%) were MDR-TB cases. Four hundred and forty three (11%) of the MDR tuberculosis cases displayed the XDR tuberculosis susceptibility profile. Only 1429 (34%) of the MDR-TB patients were seen at the provincial referral hospital for treatment. The proportion of XDR-TB amongst culture-confirmed cases was highest in the Msinga sub-district (19.6%), followed by the remaining part of the Umzinyati district (5.9%) and the other 10 districts (1.1%). The number of hospitals with at least one XDR-TB case increased from 18 (25%) to 58 (80%) during the study period. Interpretation XDR-TB is present throughout KZN. More than 65% of all diagnosed MDR-TB cases, including XDR-TB patients, were left untreated and likely remained in the community as a source of infection."
https://openalex.org/W2161480613,"Our understanding of disease is increasingly informed by changes in gene expression between normal and abnormal tissues. The release of the canine genome sequence in 2005 provided an opportunity to better understand human health and disease using the dog as clinically relevant model. Accordingly, we now present the first genome-wide, canine normal tissue gene expression compendium with corresponding human cross-species analysis.The Affymetrix platform was utilized to catalogue gene expression signatures of 10 normal canine tissues including: liver, kidney, heart, lung, cerebrum, lymph node, spleen, jejunum, pancreas and skeletal muscle. The quality of the database was assessed in several ways. Organ defining gene sets were identified for each tissue and functional enrichment analysis revealed themes consistent with known physio-anatomic functions for each organ. In addition, a comparison of orthologous gene expression between matched canine and human normal tissues uncovered remarkable similarity. To demonstrate the utility of this dataset, novel canine gene annotations were established based on comparative analysis of dog and human tissue selective gene expression and manual curation of canine probeset mapping. Public access, using infrastructure identical to that currently in use for human normal tissues, has been established and allows for additional comparisons across species.These data advance our understanding of the canine genome through a comprehensive analysis of gene expression in a diverse set of tissues, contributing to improved functional annotation that has been lacking. Importantly, it will be used to inform future studies of disease in the dog as a model for human translational research and provides a novel resource to the community at large."
https://openalex.org/W2087836412,"Cancer-testis antigens (CTAs) are normally expressed in testis but are aberrantly expressed in a variety of cancers with varying frequency. More than 100 proteins have been identified as CTA including testes-specific protease 50 (TSP50) and the testis-specific paralogue of CCCTC-binding factor, BORIS (brother of the regulator of imprinted sites). Because many CTAs are considered as excellent targets for tumor immunotherapy, understanding the regulatory mechanisms governing their expression is important. In this study we demonstrate that BORIS is directly responsible for the transcriptional activation of TSP50. We found two BORIS binding sites in the TSP50 promoter that are highly conserved between mouse and human. Mutations of the binding sites resulted in loss of BORIS binding and the ability of BORIS to activate the promoter. However, although expression of BORIS was essential, it was not sufficient for high expression of TSP50 in cancer cells. Further studies showed that binding of BORIS to the target sites was methylation-independent but was diminished by nucleosomal occupancy consistent with the findings that high expression of TSP50 was associated with increased DNase I sensitivity and high BORIS occupancy of the promoter. These findings indicate that BORIS-induced expression of TSP50 is governed by accessibility and binding of BORIS to the promoter. To our knowledge this is the first report of regulated expression of one CTA by another to be validated in a physiological context.

BORIS contains an 11ZF domain that is highly similar to the 11ZF domain of CTCF. We recently reported that BORIS plays important physiological functions in progression of spermatogenesis by regulating expression of a testis-specific splicing variant of cerebroside sulfotransferase (Cst), Cst form FTS (25Suzuki T. Kosaka-Suzuki N. Pack S. Shin D.M. Yoon J. Abdullaev Z. Pugacheva E. Morse 3rd, H.C. Loukinov D. Lobanenkov V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 2473-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). CTAs such as BORIS are encoded by genes that show restricted expression in testis and tumors. For the restricted expression, CTAs are considered as candidate targets of cancer vaccines (26Akers S.N.

Immunization against BORIS was shown to be effective in treating mice injected with BORIS-expressing cancer cells (28Loukinov D. Ghochikyan A. Mkrtichyan M. Ichim T.E. Lobanenkov V.V. Cribbs D.H.

Furthermore, it has been reported that BORIS regulates expression of genes encoding other CTAs including MAGE-A1, SPANX, and NY-ESO-1 (30Vatolin S. Abdullaev Z. Pack S.D. Flanagan P.T. Custer M. Loukinov D.I. Pugacheva E. Hong J.A. Morse 3rd, H. Schrump D.S. Risinger J.I. Barrett J.C. Lobanenkov V.V. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 7751-7762Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 31Hong J.A.

Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 7763-7774Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Recent publications suggested BORIS was involved in DNA hypomethylation in cancers that is important for derepression of CTAs expression (32Smith I.M. Glazer C.A. Mithani S.K. Ochs M.F. Sun W. Bhan S. Vostrov A. Abdullaev Z. Lobanenkov V. Gray A. Liu C. Chang S.S. Ostrow K.L. Westra W.H. Begum S. Dhara M. Califano J.

Karpf A.R. Clin. Cancer Res. 2011; 17: 2170-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that BORIS is an important regulator of CTA expression in cancer cells. PRSS50, also known as TSP50 (testes-specific protease 50) or CT20, encodes a protease originally found as a gene with a promoter that is hypomethylated in tumors (34Yuan L. Shan J. De Risi D. Broome J. Lovecchio J. Gal D. Vinciguerra V. Xu H.P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3215-3221PubMed Google Scholar). Like BORIS, TSP50 is known as a CTA. Although the physiologic function of TSP50 is not clarified, the characteristic of its expression makes it interesting as a potential target for cancer immunotherapy. Recent publications suggested that expression of TSP50 is regulated by CpG methylation of the promoter (35Huang Y. Wang Y. Wang M. Sun B. Li Y. Bao Y. Tian K. Xu H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 374: 658-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), similar to many other CTAs, and by various transcription factors including SP1, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), and TP53 (36Xu H. Shan J. Jurukovski V. Yuan L. Li J. Tian K. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 1239-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 37Wang M. Bao Y.L. Wu Y. Yu C.L. Meng X. Xu H.P. Li Y.X. DNA Cell Biol. 2008; 27: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, none of these factors was shown to regulate expression of TSP50 in a physiological context, which make it unclear which factors are involved in vivo. Given the possible utility of TSP50 as a target for tumor immunotherapy, we felt that clarification of the regulatory mechanisms was an important issue. We recently reported that BORIS is involved in regulating Tsp50 expression in testis, although it was not clear whether reduced expression of Tsp50 in testis of Boris knock-out (KO) mice was a primary or secondary effect of the loss of BORIS (25Suzuki T. Kosaka-Suzuki N. Pack S. Shin D.M. Yoon J. Abdullaev Z. Pugacheva E. Morse 3rd, H.C. Loukinov D. Lobanenkov V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 2473-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Here we report that BORIS is directly involved in activation of TSP50 expression by binding to the promoter region. We identified two BORIS target sites in the TSP50 promoter that are highly conserved among species. We found that BORIS-induced expression of TSP50 was dependent on regulated binding of BORIS to the promoter. The promoter of TSP50 was DNase I-hypersensitive in the cell line Delta47, which expresses TSP50 at high levels, but not in other cell lines with little or no expression. This suggested that accessibility to the promoter is the limiting factor for binding of BORIS and downstream expression of TSP50. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating direct regulation of a CTA by BORIS in a physiological context. NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin. Normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) and other human cancer cell lines, Delta47, EKVX, OVCAR8, K562, MM-S1, 8226, IGRov1, UO31, A498, and ARK were cultured in RPMI medium 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin. Boris knock-out mice were generated as described previously (25Suzuki T. Kosaka-Suzuki N. Pack S. Shin D.M. Yoon J. Abdullaev Z. Pugacheva E. Morse 3rd, H.C. Loukinov D. Lobanenkov V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 2473-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). All animal experiments were conducted in compliance with the Animal Care and Use Committee of the NIAID, National Institutes of Health. The antibody against mouse BORIS used for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis was described previously (25Suzuki T. Kosaka-Suzuki N. Pack S. Shin D.M. Yoon J. Abdullaev Z. Pugacheva E. Morse 3rd, H.C. Loukinov D. Lobanenkov V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 2473-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for human BORIS were produced using recombinant human BORIS protein prepared from larvae of Trichoplusia ni infected with baculovirus expressing full-length human BORIS. 6A. A. Vostrov, manuscript in preparation. Nine antibody-producing clones that produced antibodies active in mobility super-shift assay were chosen, and ChIP assays were carried out using a mixture of these antibodies. Total RNA was isolated from tissues and cells using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was prepared with oligo-dT primers using SuperScript III First-strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. qPCR was performed using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and the 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The expression of TSP50 and BORIS in primary melanomas was analyzed using TissueScan Melanoma Tissue qPCR Panel I (Origene, Rockville, MD) and Mx3000p (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Fisher's exact test was conducted to analyze statistical significance of correlation between expression of BORIS and TSP50 in melanomas. Primers for qPCR were designed using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems). Primer sequences are listed in supplemental Table 1 or described in a previous publication (25Suzuki T. Kosaka-Suzuki N. Pack S. Shin D.M. Yoon J. Abdullaev Z. Pugacheva E. Morse 3rd, H.C. Loukinov D. Lobanenkov V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 2473-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) Expression levels were normalized against the housekeeping gene GAPDH except for the melanoma panel, which was pre-normalized against ACTB. Relative expression levels were determined by standard curve method or comparative Ct method according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. Student's t test was performed to evaluate statistical significance. Data shown are the means ± S.D. Spermatocytes and round spermatids were purified as previously described (25Suzuki T. Kosaka-Suzuki N. Pack S. Shin D.M. Yoon J. Abdullaev Z. Pugacheva E. Morse 3rd, H.C. Loukinov D. Lobanenkov V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 2473-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, dissociated testicular cells were separated by centrifugal elutriation. Partially purified spermatocyte and round spermatid fractions were incubated with 10 μm Vybrant DyeCycle Green (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 32 °C followed by staining with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Spermatocytes and round spermatids were sorted according to DNA content to improve purity using FACSAria (BD Biosciences). DAPI-positive dead cells were eliminated. EMSA and methylation interference assays were performed as described previously (25Suzuki T. Kosaka-Suzuki N. Pack S. Shin D.M. Yoon J. Abdullaev Z. Pugacheva E. Morse 3rd, H.C. Loukinov D. Lobanenkov V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 2473-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Mouse and human TSP50 promoters were analyzed with BORIS protein of mouse and human origin, respectively. Because the amino acid sequences of human and mouse CTCF are highly conserved, we used mouse CTCF for analyses of both the mouse and human TSP50 promoters. Partially purified recombinant human BORIS protein prepared from larva of T. ni infected with baculovirus expressing full-length human BORIS was used for EMSA.6 Briefly, larvae were homogenized in buffer containing 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 10 μm ZnSO4, and 4× Complete protease inhibitor mixture without EDTA (Roche Applied Science). Homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The bulk of the BORIS protein was detected in the pellet using antibodies against the V5 tag. The pellet was washed sequentially with homogenization buffer containing 1, 2, and 4 m urea. After final washing, BORIS was extracted using homogenization buffer containing 6 m urea and 500 mm NaCl. The DNA binding ability and specificity of the recombinant protein was confirmed in EMSA tests using a variety of known BORIS binding DNA sequences as well as negative controls. The binding specificity was further confirmed by mobility supershift assay using antibodies against human BORIS (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Partially purified recombinant mouse BORIS and CTCF proteins were prepared from Escherichia coli transformed with pET16b-mouse Boris and mouse Ctcf, respectively, following the procedure described above. Bacteria were disrupted by sonication. Samples prepared from E. coli transformed with pET16b empty vector were used as a negative control. For EMSA with nucleosomal DNA fragments, nucleosomes were reconstituted using a Chromatin Assembly kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Luciferase and control lysate from larva of T. ni were used as negative controls in EMSA for in vitro translated protein and recombinant protein prepared with baculovirus, respectively. Primers to prepare DNA fragments of human TSP50 promoter for EMSA are listed in supplemental Table 1. Fragments containing the entire 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) sequences of Tsp50 and its promoter sequences starting from position −150, −300, or −600 were cloned into pGL3-basic vector. NIH3T3 cells were cotransfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) with luciferase constructs together with pRL-CMV vector as an internal control and expression vectors for BORIS or CTCF in pCIneo according to the manufacture's protocol. Cells were cultured for 48 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Luciferase assays were carried out with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The luciferase activities were normalized to the empty vector-transfected samples for each luciferase construct. Student's t test was performed to evaluate statistical significance. Data shown are the means ± S.D. ChIP assays were carried out as previously described (25Suzuki T. Kosaka-Suzuki N. Pack S. Shin D.M. Yoon J. Abdullaev Z. Pugacheva E. Morse 3rd, H.C. Loukinov D. Lobanenkov V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 2473-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, fixed cells or tissue lysates corresponding to 1 × 106 cells or 20 mg of tissue in 100 μl of SDS lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.1% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) were incubated with Dynabeads M-280 (Invitrogen) preconjugated with antibodies for 1.5 h at 4 °C with rotation. DNA fragments bound to beads were purified and subjected for qPCR. Primers used for qPCR are listed in supplemental Table 1. Student's t test was performed to evaluate statistical significance. Data shown are the means ± S.D. Bisulfite modification of genomic DNA was carried out using the Imprint DNA Modification kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The bisulfite-modified TSP50 promoter region from −198 to −32 was amplified using 5′-GGGTTAAGGAGGGAAGTTAGT-3′ and 5′-CTAATAAACTAAATAAAAATACTCCTAATA-3′ as primers with PCR Platinum Taq Polymerase (Invitrogen) under the following conditions: 94 °C for 2 min; 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s; 72 °C for 5 min. A CpG island from −65 to +159 was amplified using 5′-GGGGTATTAGGAGTATTTTTATTTAGTTTATT-3′ and 5′-ACCTCAACAACAAAAACAACAACAA-3′ as primers under the following conditions: 94 °C for 2 min; 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s; 72 °C for 5 min. Amplicons were purified and cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega). After transformation, plasmids from individual bacterial colonies were extracted and subjected to sequencing (Genomics Research Facility, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, NIAID, National Institutes of Health). Methylation status was analyzed by PCR using bisulfite-treated DNA as templates with primers specific for methylated or unmethylated sequences with designs based on the promoter region or the CpG island inside the transcribed region of TSP50. Primers used for these experiments are shown in supplemental Table 1. PCR was performed under the following conditions: 94 °C for 2 min; 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, annealing temperature of 57 °C (unmethylated promoter)/57 °C (methylated promoter)/53 °C (unmethylated transcribed region)/60 °C (methylated transcribed region) for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s; 72 °C for 5 min. PCR products were electrophoresed on 3% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. DNase I hypersensitive assays were carried out as previously described with slight modifications (38Lu Q. Richardson B. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 287: 77-86PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 107 cells homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer were split into four samples and treated with 0, 80, 160, or 320 units/ml of DNase I for 3 min at 25 °C. Samples were then treated with RNase A followed by treatment with proteinase K. 70 μg of purified DNA digested with NheI and KpnI was separated on 0.8% agarose gels. The probe for hybridization was generated by PCR using 5′-CAGTCTTTTCAGTGTCCCACCG-3′ and 5′-CCCTTGGAGTCTGTATGTTGGC-3′ as primers. Nucleosome positioning was analyzed as described previously with modifications (39Lam F.H. Steger D.J. O'Shea E.K. Nature. 2008; 453: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 40Jin C. Zang C. Wei G. Cui K. Peng W. Zhao K. Felsenfeld G. Nat. Genet. 2009; 41: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). 1.5 × 107 cells were harvested and washed with cold PBS. Cells were suspended in solution A (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixture) and incubated for 10 min on ice followed by treatment with solution B (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm CaCl2, protease inhibitor mixture). Samples were treated with 120 units/ml micrococcal nuclease for 10 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was terminated by adding solution C (100 mm EDTA, 4% SDS). After treatment with 0.3 mg/ml RNase A for 30 min at 37 °C, samples were treated overnight at 50 °C with 20 mg/ml proteinase K. Purified DNA was separated on 1.5% agarose gels, and the band corresponding to mononucleosomes was excised from the gel followed by purification with QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen). Nucleosome positioning was identified by tiling qPCR using mononucleosomal DNA as a template. Primers were designed by Primer3 from the Whitehead Institute to produce overlapping amplicons covering the promoter region of TSP50. Primers used for qPCR are shown in supplemental Table 1. Data were normalized to the signal of the highest peak. As a first step in evaluating the role played by BORIS in expression of Tsp50, we quantified levels of Tsp50 transcripts in WT and Boris KO mice by qPCR (Fig. 1A). As reported previously (34Yuan L. Shan J. De Risi D. Broome J. Lovecchio J. Gal D. Vinciguerra V. Xu H.P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3215-3221PubMed Google Scholar), Tsp50 transcripts were present at high levels only in testis and were significantly lower in testis of Boris KO mice (25Suzuki T. Kosaka-Suzuki N. Pack S. Shin D.M. Yoon J. Abdullaev Z. Pugacheva E. Morse 3rd, H.C. Loukinov D. Lobanenkov V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 2473-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To determine if Tsp50 was differentially expressed among subsets of spermatogenic cells, we compared the levels of transcripts in purified spermatocytes and round spermatids. We found that transcript levels in round spermatids were 16-fold higher than in SC (Fig. 1B, left panel). The differential distribution of Tsp50 expression between these subsets of spermatogenic cells was quite similar to that described previously for Cst form F, a reported target of BORIS, and Boris as illustrated in Fig. 1B (middle and right panels, respectively) (25Suzuki T. Kosaka-Suzuki N. Pack S. Shin D.M. Yoon J. Abdullaev Z. Pugacheva E. Morse 3rd, H.C. Loukinov D. Lobanenkov V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 2473-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The above findings prompted us to determine if BORIS was directly involved in governing Tsp50 expression by binding to the promoter region. To examine this issue, we generated five DNA fragments (Fr), designated Fr1 to Fr5, that span the promoter region (Fig. 2A) and tested them for BORIS binding by EMSA. BORIS bound uniquely and specifically to Fr2 (Fig. 2B), which includes sequences around transcription start site (TSS). We next examined the functional relevance of these results by generating a series of promoter truncations (Fig. 2A) for use in luciferase reporter assays. NIH3T3 cells were cotransfected with each of the promoter constructs together with expression vectors for BORIS or CTCF. The results of these studies demonstrated that all three reporters were significantly activated by BORIS but not by CTCF (Fig. 2C). These results indicated that the activation of Tsp50 promoter was directly dependent on binding of BORIS to sequences downstream of −150 of the Tsp50 promoter. To more precisely define the target sites for BORIS on the Tsp50 promoter, we conducted methylation interference assays using the Fr2 sequence as a probe (Figs. 3, A–C). Because CTCF is known to share target sequences with BORIS in vitro for the highly conserved DNA recognition domain, we first probed the Fr2 sequence using the 11ZF domain of CTCF that efficiently binds to target sequences to identify contact nucleotides (Fig. 3B). We identified two binding sites in the TSP50 promoter that we designated as B1 and B2. To validate BORIS would also recognize these residues, we carried out methylation interference assays using mouse BORIS protein and found that BORIS bound exactly the same guanine residues as 11ZF domain of CTCF (Fig. 3C). This result clearly shows that BORIS and CTCF recognize the same target sequences in the Tsp50 promoter. Furthermore, we conducted EMSA using either WT Fr2 (Fr2-wt) or Fr2 carrying mutations at contact nucleotides within B1 and/or B2 (Fig. 3, A and D). BORIS was bound to Fr2-wt as well as Fr2 with mutations within either B1 (Fr2-B1mut) or B2 (Fr2-B2mut). In contrast, almost no band-shift was seen with Fr2-carrying mutations in both B1 and B2 (Fr2-B1/B2mut). We then tested the Fr2-wt and mutated Fr2 sequences in EMSA for binding of either full-length CTCF or the 11ZF domain (Fig. 3E). The results of these studies showed that, like BORIS, both CTCF and the 11ZF domain bound to Fr2-wt, B1mut, and B2mut but that binding to Fr2-B1/B2mut was markedly reduced or undetectable. It is noteworthy that EMSA with BORIS, CTCF, and 11ZF domain showed the slower migr"
https://openalex.org/W2019016146,"We proposed a non-parametric method, named Non-Parametric Change Point Statistic (NPCPS for short), by using a single equation for detecting differential gene expression (DGE) in microarray data. NPCPS is based on the change point theory to provide effective DGE detecting ability.NPCPS used the data distribution of the normal samples as input, and detects DGE in the cancer samples by locating the change point of gene expression profile. An estimate of the change point position generated by NPCPS enables the identification of the samples containing DGE. Monte Carlo simulation and ROC study were applied to examine the detecting accuracy of NPCPS, and the experiment on real microarray data of breast cancer was carried out to compare NPCPS with other methods.Simulation study indicated that NPCPS was more effective for detecting DGE in cancer subset compared with five parametric methods and one non-parametric method. When there were more than 8 cancer samples containing DGE, the type I error of NPCPS was below 0.01. Experiment results showed both good accuracy and reliability of NPCPS. Out of the 30 top genes ranked by using NPCPS, 16 genes were reported as relevant to cancer. Correlations between the detecting result of NPCPS and the compared methods were less than 0.05, while between the other methods the values were from 0.20 to 0.84. This indicates that NPCPS is working on different features and thus provides DGE identification from a distinct perspective comparing with the other mean or median based methods."

Collagen IX is located at the surface of fibrils formed by collagen II and a minor proportion of collagen XI, playing roles in tissue stability and integrity. The NC4 domain projects out from the fibril surface and provides sites for interaction with other matrix components such as cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, matrilins, fibromodulin, and osteoadherin. Fragmentation of collagen IX and loss of the NC4 domain are early events in cartilage degradation in joint diseases that precedes major damage of collagen II fibrils. Our results demonstrate that NC4 can function as a novel inhibitor of the complement system able to bind C4, C3, and C9 and to directly inhibit C9 polymerization and assembly of the lytic membrane attack complex. NC4 also binds the complement inhibitors C4b-binding protein and factor H and enhances their cofactor activity in degradation of activated complement components C4b and C3b. NC4 interactions with fibromodulin and osteoadherin inhibited binding to C1q and complement activation by these proteins. Taken together, our results suggest that collagen IX and its interactions with matrix components are important parts of a machinery that protects the cartilage from complement activation and chronic inflammation seen in diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.

IntroductionThe complement system represents a central component of the innate immune system and is activated via three different pathways depending on the initiating agent (1Ricklin D. Hajishengallis G. Yang K. Lambris J.D. Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11: 785-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (2400) Google Scholar). The classical pathway was first found to be triggered by antibodies bound to their targets, whereas the lectin pathway is initiated by specific carbohydrates on bacterial surfaces. In contrast, the alternative pathway is started by autoactivation of the unstable complement component C3 and its subsequent deposition on activating pathogen surfaces. Triggered enzymatic complement cascades result in the assembly of C3- and C5-convertases, which leads to opsonization of activating surfaces with C3b, release of pro-inflammatory anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, and finally formation of a lytic membrane attack complex (MAC), 3The abbreviations used are: MACmembrane attack complexNC4noncollagenous domain 4COMPcartilage oligomeric matrix proteinFMfibromodulinOSADosteoadherinFHfactor HFIfactor IRArheumatoid arthritisOAosteoarthritisCCP domaincomplement control protein domainANOVAanalysis of variancePSprotein SrecC4BPrecombinant C4BPMBLmannan-binding lectin. which disrupts membrane integrity (1Ricklin D. Hajishengallis G. Yang K. Lambris J.D. Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11: 785-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (2400) Google Scholar).To prevent complement-mediated tissue injury, a fine balance between activation and inhibition of the system is established by several soluble as well as membrane-bound inhibitors (2Zipfel P.F. Skerka C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). C4b-binding protein (C4BP) is the major soluble inhibitor of the classical and lectin pathways, whereas factor H (FH) inhibits the alternative route. Most inhibitors act in two ways as follows: by accelerating the decay of complement convertases or by promoting enzymatic cleavage of the activated complement factors C3b and C4b by a serine proteinase, factor I (FI). Any shift of the balance might provoke development of inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), glomerulonephritis, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, and many more (3Morgan B.P. Walport M.J. Immunol. Today. 1991; 12: 301-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 4Sjöberg A.P. Trouw L.A. Blom A.M. Trends Immunol. 2009; 30: 83-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). There is also an increasing understanding that osteoarthritis (OA) has a significant inflammatory component.OA and RA involve damage to the articular cartilage in the affected joint and often influence many different joints in the body. Joint replacement in these diseases has been found to attenuate inflammation, which implies that cartilage-derived components might have a role in the inflammation. A large body of evidence shows that complement contributes to the development of RA in man and experimental animals (5Okroj M. Heinegård D. Holmdahl R. Blom A.M. Ann. Med. 2007; 39: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It has been shown that fibromodulin (FM) and osteoadherin (OSAD), constituents of the extracellular matrix, activate complement via the classical pathway and may enhance inflammation in joint disease (6Sjöberg A.

Day A.J. Heinegård D. Blom A.M. Mol. Immunol. 2009; 46: 830-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Fragments of these cartilage components are released by proteases during cartilage destruction to come in contact with complement in synovial fluid. The involvement of these molecules in inflammation may be applied to develop novel approaches for early diagnosis and treatment of arthritic diseases.Cartilage is composed of a low number of cells surrounded by a dense matrix of the aggrecan proteoglycan bound to hyaluronan and is entangled in a network of collagen fibrils. The collagen fibrils are built by collagens type II and XI with collagen IX attached at their surface. The collagen IX molecule is a heterotrimer (composed of polypeptide chains α1, α2, and α3) and comprises three collagenous domains (COL1–COL3) flanked by four short noncollagenous (NC1–NC4) domains (8van der Rest M. Mayne R. Ninomiya Y. Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Olsen B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 220-225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The NC4 domain is larger than the other three NC domains and is formed only by the α1-chain (Fig. 1A). Collagen IX molecules cover the surface of collagen II/XI fibrils in a periodic fashion (9Eyre D.R. Pietka T. Weis M.A. Wu J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2568-2574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and act as molecular bridges connecting collagen fibrils with other cartilage matrix components to ensure stiffness and tensile strength of the cartilage (10Shaw L.M. Olsen B.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 191-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The COL3 and NC4 domains project out from the fibril surface, thus providing sites for interactions with matrix proteins like cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), FM, and others, although matrilin-3 can interact with neighboring collagen domains (11Budde B. Blumbach K. Ylöstalo J. Zaucke F. Ehlen H.W. Wagener R. Ala-Kokko L. Paulsson M. Bruckner P. Grässel S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10465-10478Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 12Mann H.H.

These interactions are crucial for tissue integrity and stability. The NC4 domain appears to be particularly sensitive to enzymatic attack in cartilage breakdown (13Danfelter M. Onnerfjord P. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36933-36941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The process appears to be mediated by matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13), and one of the fragments released corresponds to almost the entire NC4 domain (13Danfelter M. Onnerfjord P. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36933-36941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the loss of the NC4 domain occurs both in cartilage treated with interleukin 1 (IL-1) and in RA 4M. Danfelter, P. Önnerfjord, and D. Heinegård, unpublished observations. and precedes major release of collagen II (13Danfelter M. Onnerfjord P. Heinegård D. J. Biol.

Duance V.C. Rheumatology. 1999; 38: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar).We aimed to investigate if the NC4 domain is able to modulate complement, and we found that it can act as a local inhibitor. NC4 binds both C4BP and FH and enhances their cofactor activities in degradation of C4b and C3b. Furthermore, NC4 attenuates complement directly due to inhibition of C9 polymerization and MAC formation. Moreover, we show that NC4 interactions with other key matrix components have an impact on complement regulation. Taken together, our results suggest that collagen IX might be a component of a mechanism protecting the cartilage from joint-specific autoimmune attack, complement activation, and chronic inflammation seen in diseases such as RA and OA.DISCUSSIONRheumatic diseases such as RA and OA are chronic diseases causing damage to the cartilage, synovium, and bone in the joints. These diseases affect a significant proportion of the population. Currently, the diagnosis and monitoring of RA and particularly OA are based on methods limited in that they detect clinical symptoms at advanced stages of the diseases. Thus, it is important to identify novel targets for early diagnosis and prediction of disease evolution. Inflammation has a role in disease development, and identification of novel regulatory interactions between cartilage components and the immune system may lead to development of new treatments.Collagen type IX is bound at the surface of the collagen II/XI fibrils and with its COL3 and NC4 domains exposed provides sites for interaction with other cartilage proteins, ensuring the formation of macromolecular networks important for tissue functions. Upon cartilage breakdown, proteins normally retained in the cartilage are released into the synovial fluid and serum and have been shown to have the potential to be used as markers for diagnosis and prognosis of joint diseases (40Crnkic M. Månsson B. Larsson L. Geborek P. Heinegård D. Saxne T. Arthritis Res. Ther. 2003; 5: R181-R185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some of these proteins have been found to interact with components of complement. FM, OSAD, chondroadherin (6Sjöberg A. Onnerfjord P. Mörgelin M. Heinegård D. Blom A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32301-32308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 7Sjöberg A.P. Manderson G.A. Mörgelin M. Day A.J. Heinegård D. Blom A.M. Mol. Immunol. 2009; 46: 830-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and COMP (33Happonen K.E. Saxne T. Aspberg A. Mörgelin M. Heinegård D. Blom A.M. Arthritis Rheum. 2010; 62: 3574-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) are able to either activate or inhibit complement. All complement components can be found in the synovial fluid, and it has been well recognized that complement activation is an important initiator as well as sustainer of inflammation in arthritic diseases (5Okroj M. Heinegård D. Holmdahl R. Blom A.M. Ann. Med. 2007; 39: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).Fragmentation of collagen IX and loss of its NC4 domain from cartilage can be a result of cytokine-induced protease activation and appears to be an event in cartilage breakdown (13Danfelter M. Onnerfjord P. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36933-36941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Collagen IX fragments have been found in synovial fluids from patients with arthritic diseases (41Wotton S.F. Duance V.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 375SCrossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Additionally, mutant mice lacking collagen IX show matrix destabilization and are more susceptible to inflammatory arthritis (42Carlsen S. Nandakumar K.S. Holmdahl R. Arthritis Res. Ther. 2006; 8: R102Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This could be explained by an enhanced accessibility of collagen-specific antibodies and complement components to cartilage and raises the possibility that the NC4 domain of collagen IX and its interactions with other matrix components might have a role in the modulation of complement, thereby protecting cartilage from damage. In this study, we investigated this in detail and found that the NC4 domain of collagen IX is a local inhibitor of complement. It inhibits complement by preventing C9 polymerization and attenuation of MAC formation.Proteins able to interact with C4/C4b and C3/C3b sometimes play a role as cofactors for FI-mediated C4b and C3b degradation, but we now show that this is not the case for NC4. Upon cartilage breakdown, several cartilage proteins with complement-activating potential are released into synovial fluid. In this situation, NC4 by binding C4/C4b and C3/C3b might prevent progress to the next step of the complement cascade initiated by other cartilage proteins and thus slowing down the process of complement activation.We found that the NC4 domain interacts with the complement inhibitors C4BP and FH, which suggests a physiological role in the local regulation of complement. These interactions are ionic in character, and NC4 has several bindings sites along the C4BP α-chain, albeit possibly with different affinities. In healthy cartilage, NC4 is an integral part of the CIX molecule. Unfortunately, the full-length heterotrimer has not been expressed recombinantly. This represents a major endeavor, in view of the extensive post-translational modifications such as formation of hydroxyproline and lysine as well glycosylations. Purification of CIX from cartilage is not a viable alternative except from lathyritic animals because the collagen largely occurs covalently cross-linked to the collagen II fibers. Therefore, we can only speculate what would be the role of the intact CIX. However, two scenarios are possible; first, in the healthy cartilage NC4 might localize the inhibitors to the collagen fibrils to protect them from complement attack. As cartilage has a dense matrix poorly permeable to most serum proteins, NC4 may play a role in controlling complement mainly at the surface of the tissue. Second, upon collagen IX fragmentation and release of the NC4 domain into synovial fluid of patients with active disease, this fragment may locally inhibit complement by binding C4BP and FH. Moreover, C4BP and FH bound to NC4 not only maintain their cofactor activity, but also promote the enzymatic cleavage of C3b and C4b by FI more effectively than unbound. This may be related to the fact that NC4 interacts with C3b and C4b and may either affect their conformation making them more susceptible for cleavage by FI or acts as cross-link between C4BP/FH and C4b/C3b increasing the affinity of their interactions. By accelerating cofactor activities of C4BP and FH, NC4 might serve to maintain the complement activation at a low level even when initiated by other cartilage proteins or protein fragments, preventing the release of C5a and MAC formation. This could be an important mechanism protecting intact cartilage from complement being activated. It appears that these mechanisms are more relevant for disease progression/chronicity than to disease initiation. Because RA has a much more prominent inflammatory component than OA, these mechanisms of regulation of the pro-inflammatory complement cascade may be more relevant in RA than OA.We aimed to investigate if the observed C4, C3, and C9 deposition from serum on NC4 results from a direct interaction, rather than from complement activation. For this purpose, we used heat-inactivated and C2- and C6-depleted sera. Surprisingly, strong binding of C4, C3, and C9 to NC4 could not be detected from C2- and C6-depleted sera nor control normal human serum from the same vendor, all prepared from single donors (data not shown). Binding observed with our pooled serum that was heat-inactivated was also weak indicating a certain level of complement activation. Furthermore, we studied deposition of C4, C3, and C9 on NC4 from individual sera of 11 healthy donors and found that 30% of the sera did not support heat-sensitive deposition of C4, C3, and C9 on NC4 (data not shown). In the remaining sera, binding of C4, C3, and C9 was significant but varied in intensity. These pooled sera did not show any significant binding of MBL, C1q, or ficolin-2/3 to immobilized NC4, although these proteins bound well from serum to positive controls, IgG, mannan, and acetylated BSA (data not shown). There is a concern that immobilization of NC4 masks binding epitope for C1 or MBL, but such immobilized NC4 triggers classical pathway activation in serum. Therefore, it appears that the epitope binding complement initiator is exposed under these conditions. Additionally, in 30% of our tested sera, we could not detect MBL deposition on mannan implying MBL deficiency. This was not correlated with the ability to deposit complement on NC4. These findings indicate that a yet unknown molecule able to induce the classical pathway might be involved in interaction with NC4 and that not all of the healthy donor sera might contain this protein. The NC4 domain is a positively charged molecule, capable of binding heparin (43Pihlajamaa T. Lankinen H. Ylöstalo J. Valmu L. Jäälinoja J. Zaucke F. Spitznagel L. Gösling S. Puustinen A. Mörgelin M. Peränen J. Maurer P. Ala-Kokko L. Kilpelaïnen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24265-24273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). One may speculate that it binds acidic molecules and glycosaminoglycans present in serum. Thus, NC4 might cause some activation of complement by binding a yet unknown complement initiator, which warrants further investigation.The cartilage proteins FM, OSAD, and COMP interact in complex ways with complement. FM and OSAD bind to C1q globular heads and activate complement. COMP binds C1q stalks and inhibits the classical pathway, although it simultaneously binds properdin and activates the alternative pathway. Interestingly, complexes between COMP and C3b resulting from COMP-mediated complement activation in vivo were found in sera from RA patients (33Happonen K.E. Saxne T. Aspberg A. Mörgelin M. Heinegård D. Blom A.M. Arthritis Rheum. 2010; 62: 3574-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Because the NC4 domain interacts with FM, OSAD, and COMP, a question arises how the interactions between the different cartilage proteins effect complement regulation. In an attempt to shed some light on this, we studied the ability of FM, OSAD, and COMP to bind C1q in the presence of NC4. The interactions with NC4 led to inhibition of C1q binding to FM, OSAD, and to lesser extent COMP, suggesting that when released into the synovial fluid NC4 might inhibit the complement activating potential of FM and OSAD, and the inhibitory potential of COMP. The outcome of this regulatory process would depend on the levels of cartilage proteins released into the synovial fluid upon cartilage damage and might be an important factor for monitoring and predicting disease development. FM and OSAD both contain tyrosine sulfate-rich domains that mimic heparin and can interact with a variety of heparin-binding proteins (16Tillgren V. Onnerfjord P. Haglund L. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 28543-28553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The inhibition of C1q binding to these proteins by NC4 seems to depend on the competition for the same binding site between C1q and NC4. Taken together, the results from this study show that the NC4 domain of collagen IX inhibits complement by preventing C9 polymerization and enhancing cofactor activities of the major soluble complement inhibitors C4BP and FH. IntroductionThe complement system represents a central component of the innate immune system and is activated via three different pathways depending on the initiating agent (1Ricklin D. Hajishengallis G. Yang K. Lambris J.D. Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11: 785-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (2400) Google Scholar). The classical pathway was first found to be triggered by antibodies bound to their targets, whereas the lectin pathway is initiated by specific carbohydrates on bacterial surfaces. In contrast, the alternative pathway is started by autoactivation of the unstable complement component C3 and its subsequent deposition on activating pathogen surfaces. Triggered enzymatic complement cascades result in the assembly of C3- and C5-convertases, which leads to opsonization of activating surfaces with C3b, release of pro-inflammatory anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, and finally formation of a lytic membrane attack complex (MAC), 3The abbreviations used are: MACmembrane attack complexNC4noncollagenous domain 4COMPcartilage oligomeric matrix proteinFMfibromodulinOSADosteoadherinFHfactor HFIfactor IRArheumatoid arthritisOAosteoarthritisCCP domaincomplement control protein domainANOVAanalysis of variancePSprotein SrecC4BPrecombinant C4BPMBLmannan-binding lectin. which disrupts membrane integrity (1Ricklin D. Hajishengallis G. Yang K. Lambris J.D. Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11: 785-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (2400) Google Scholar).To prevent complement-mediated tissue injury, a fine balance between activation and inhibition of the system is established by several soluble as well as membrane-bound inhibitors (2Zipfel P.F. Skerka C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). C4b-binding protein (C4BP) is the major soluble inhibitor of the classical and lectin pathways, whereas factor H (FH) inhibits the alternative route. Most inhibitors act in two ways as follows: by accelerating the decay of complement convertases or by promoting enzymatic cleavage of the activated complement factors C3b and C4b by a serine proteinase, factor I (FI). Any shift of the balance might provoke development of inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), glomerulonephritis, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, and many more (3Morgan B.P. Walport M.J. Immunol. Today. 1991; 12: 301-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 4Sjöberg A.P. Trouw L.A. Blom A.M.

There is also an increasing understanding that osteoarthritis (OA) has a significant inflammatory component.OA and RA involve damage to the articular cartilage in the affected joint and often influence many different joints in the body. Joint replacement in these diseases has been found to attenuate inflammation, which implies that cartilage-derived components might have a role in the inflammation.

Med. 2007; 39: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It has been shown that fibromodulin (FM) and osteoadherin (OSAD), constituents of the extracellular matrix, activate complement via the classical pathway and may enhance inflammation in joint disease (6Sjöberg A.

Day A.J. Heinegård D. Blom A.M. Mol. Immunol. 2009; 46: 830-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Fragments of these cartilage components are released by proteases during cartilage destruction to come in contact with complement in synovial fluid. The involvement of these molecules in inflammation may be applied to develop novel approaches for early diagnosis and treatment of arthritic diseases.Cartilage is composed of a low number of cells surrounded by a dense matrix of the aggrecan proteoglycan bound to hyaluronan and is entangled in a network of collagen fibrils.

The NC4 domain is larger than the other three NC domains and is formed only by the α1-chain (Fig. 1A). Collagen IX molecules cover the surface of collagen II/XI fibrils in a periodic fashion (9Eyre D.R. Pietka T. Weis M.A. Wu J.J. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2040393049,"The G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-like molecule Smoothened (Smo) undergoes dynamic intracellular trafficking modulated by the microtubule associated kinase GRK2 and recruitment of β-arrestin. Of this trafficking, especially the translocation of Smo into primary cilia and back to the cytoplasm is essential for the activation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in vertebrates. The complete mechanism of this bidirectional transport, however, is not completely understood. Here we demonstrate that Growth Arrest Specific 8 (Gas8), a microtubule associated subunit of the Dynein Regulatory Complex (DRC), interacts with Smo to modulate this process. Gas8 knockdown in ciliated cells reduces Smo signaling activity and ciliary localization whereas overexpression stimulates Smo activity in a GRK2-dependent manner. The C terminus of Gas8 is important for both Gas8 interaction with Smo and facilitating Smo signaling. In zebrafish, knocking down Gas8 results in attenuated Hh transcriptional responses and impaired early muscle development. These effects can be reversed by the co-injection of Gas8 mRNA or by constitutive activation of the downstream Gli transcription factors. Furthermore, Gas8 and GRK2 display a synergistic effect on zebrafish early muscle development and some effects of GRK2 knockdown can be rescued by Gas8 mRNA. Interestingly, Gas8 does not interfere with cilia assembly, as the primary cilia architecture is unchanged upon Gas8 knock down or heterologous expression. This is in contrast to cells stably expressing both GRK2 and Smo, in which cilia are significantly elongated. These results identify Gas8 as a positive regulator of Hh signaling that cooperates with GRK2 to control Smo signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1963531361,"A central issue in the design of microarray-based analysis of global gene expression is that variability resulting from experimental processes may obscure changes resulting from the effect being investigated. This study quantified the variability in gene expression at each level of a typical in vitro stimulation experiment using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The primary objective was to determine the magnitude of biological and technical variability relative to the effect being investigated, namely gene expression changes resulting from stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS).Human PBMC were stimulated in vitro with LPS, with replication at 5 levels: 5 subjects each on 2 separate days with technical replication of LPS stimulation, amplification and hybridisation. RNA from samples stimulated with LPS and unstimulated samples were hybridised against common reference RNA on oligonucleotide microarrays. There was a closer correlation in gene expression between replicate hybridisations (0.86-0.93) than between different subjects (0.66-0.78). Deconstruction of the variability at each level of the experimental process showed that technical variability (standard deviation (SD) 0.16) was greater than biological variability (SD 0.06), although both were low (SD<0.1 for all individual components). There was variability in gene expression both at baseline and after stimulation with LPS and proportion of cell subsets in PBMC was likely partly responsible for this. However, gene expression changes after stimulation with LPS were much greater than the variability from any source, either individually or combined.Variability in gene expression was very low and likely to improve further as technical advances are made. The finding that stimulation with LPS has a markedly greater effect on gene expression than the degree of variability provides confidence that microarray-based studies can be used to detect changes in gene expression of biological interest in infectious diseases."

External Cu2+ inhibited human αβγ ENaC with an estimated IC50 of 0.3 μm.

A powerful means to study signaling in living cells is to use kinase inhibitors; however, no inhibitor targeting wild-type Hog1 exists to date. Herein, we describe the design, synthesis, and biological application of small molecule inhibitors that are cell-permeable, fast-acting, and highly efficient against wild-type Hog1. These compounds are potent inhibitors of Hog1 kinase activity both in vitro and in vivo. Next, we use these novel inhibitors to pinpoint the time of Hog1 action during recovery from G(1) checkpoint arrest, providing further evidence for a specific role of Hog1 in regulating cell cycle resumption during arsenite stress. Hence, we describe a novel tool for chemical genetic analysis of MAPK signaling and provide novel insights into Hog1 action."
https://openalex.org/W2078391732,"Background Multiple transitions to obligate parthenogenesis have occurred in the Daphnia pulex complex in North America. These newly formed asexual lineages are differentially distributed being found predominantly at high latitudes. This conforms to the rule of geographical parthenogenesis postulating prevalence of asexuals at high latitudes and altitudes. While the reproductive mode of high-latitude populations is relatively well studied, little is known about the reproduction mode in high altitudes. This study aimed to assess the reproductive mode of Daphnia pulicaria, a species of the D. pulex complex, from high altitude lakes in Europe. Methodology/Principal Findings Variation at eight microsatellite loci revealed that D. pulicaria from the High Tatra Mountains (HTM) had low genotype richness and showed excess of heterozygotes and significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg expectations, and was thus congruent with reproduction by obligate parthenogenesis. By contrast, populations from the Pyrenees (Pyr) were generally in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and had higher genotypic richness, suggesting that they are cyclic parthenogens. Four lakes from lowland areas (LLaP) had populations with an uncertain or mixed breeding mode. All D. pulicaria had mtDNA ND5 haplotypes of the European D. pulicaria lineage. Pyr were distinct from LLaP and HTM at the ND5 gene. By contrast, HTM shared two haplotypes with LLaP and one with Pyr. Principal Coordinate Analysis of the microsatellite data revealed clear genetic differentiation into three groups. HTM isolates were intermediate to Pyr and LLaP, congruent with a hybrid origin. Conclusion/Significance Inferred transitions to obligate parthenogenesis have occurred only in HTM, most likely as a result of hybridizations. In contrast to North American populations, these transitions do not appear to involve meiosis suppressor genes and have not been accompanied by polyploidy. The absence of obligate parthenogenesis in Pyr, an environment highly similar to the HTM, may be due to the lack of opportunities for hybridization."

IntroductionPhagocytic cells such as neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, or eosinophils possess an essential NADPH oxidase in their plasma membranes that produces microbicidal oxidants to kill pathogens during an infection. The integral membrane proteins gp91phox or Nox2 and p22phox form heterodimers called flavocytochrome b (cytb), 4The abbreviations used are: cytbflavocytochrome b558ROSreactive oxygen speciesCGDchronic granulomatous diseasePMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateDMFdimethylformamideDPIdiphenylene iodoniumINTiodonitrotetrazoliumSODsuperoxide dismutaseNoxNADPH oxidaseGTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). the core electron transferase of the oxidase. The phagocyte NADPH oxidase is dormant in resting cells and becomes activated during phagocytosis to produce superoxide, a precursor for a variety of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Indeed, after stimulus-dependent activation, cytosolic factors such as p67phox, p47phox, p40phox, and Rac2 migrate to the plasma or phagosomal membranes and assemble with cytb to form an activated NADPH oxidase complex (1Aliverti A. Piubelli L. Zanetti G. Lübberstedt T. Herrmann R.G. Curti B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6374-6380Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).In the past few years, several proteins homologous to Nox2 were discovered to be superoxide/peroxide-producing NADPH oxidases (the Nox family of NADPH oxidases, Nox1, Nox3, Nox4, and Nox5) (2Kawahara T. Quinn M.T. Lambeth J.D. BMC Evol. Biol. 2007; 7: 109Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 3Sumimoto H. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 3249-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The activation mechanism and tissue distribution of the various members of the family are markedly different from Nox2. In addition, the physiological functions of the Nox family members include not only host defense but also cellular signaling, cell differentiation, and gene regulation. They are widely involved in a range of pathological processes such as cardiovascular diseases and neurological disorders (4Bedard K. Krause K.H. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 245-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (4802) Google Scholar). However, these proteins share a similar structural organization and the capacity to transport electrons across the plasma membrane and to generate superoxide and other downstream ROS. Nox2 is the prototype NADPH oxidase, and its biochemical features have been extensively studied. Elucidating the function of Nox2 will allow a better understanding of the entire family of Nox proteins. Indeed, because of the involvement of ROS-producing Nox in various disease processes, these enzymes are potentially prime drug targets (5Jaquet V. Scapozza L. Clark R.A. Krause K.H. Lambeth J.D. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2009; 11: 2535-2552Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Thus, it is essential to fully understand the mechanism of electron transfer in this protein family to gain control of its function.Homology modeling of the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain part of the Nox family of proteins with members of the ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase family suggests the presence of FAD- and NADPH-binding sites (6Segal A.W.

Iodonitrotetrazolium reductase (INT) activity reflects the electron transfer from NADPH to FAD (9Cross A.R. Yarchover J.L. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol.

This domain of the Nox proteins contains two nonidentical hemes coordinated by four histidine residues in the third and fifth transmembrane passages (17Henderson L.M. J. Biol.

Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10451-10457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recently, a new role for the D-loop of Nox4 in folding and interaction with p22phox has been proposed (20von Löhneysen K. Noack D. Wood M.R. Friedman J.S. Knaus U.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 961-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The polybasic B-loops of Nox2 and Nox4 appear to mediate binding between the dehydrogenase domain and the heme-containing transmembrane domains of Nox enzymes thus controlling the functioning of Noxes (21Jackson H.M. Kawahara T. Nisimoto Y. Smith S.M. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 10281-10290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, the role of the putative second transmembrane α-helix and its inter-relationship with other functional domains have not yet been examined.Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare genetic disorder (frequency 1 in 200,000) characterized by severe and recurrent infections in childhood caused by deficient superoxide production by the phagocytic NADPH oxidase. The most abundant form involves X-linked transmission (X-CGD) (22van den Berg J.M. van Koppen E. Ahlin A. Belohradsky B.H. Bernatowska E. Corbeel L. Español T. Fischer A. Kurenko-Deptuch M. Mouy R. Petropoulou T. Roesler J. Seger R. Stasia M.J. Valerius N.H. Weening R.S. Wolach B. Roos D. Kuijpers T.W. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e5234Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Sometimes missense mutations in the CYBB gene encoding Nox2 lead to extremely rare CGD variants termed X+ or X−-CGD and are characterized by normal or low Nox2 expression, respectively, and are associated with no activity or a faint NADPH oxidase activity (23Stasia M.J. Li X.J. Semin. Immunopathol. 2008; 30: 209-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The preponderance of mutations in the N-terminal region of Nox2 appears to occur in a “hot spot” of five residues from Ala-53 to Cys-59, located in the putative second transmembrane α-helix (Fig. 2) (23Stasia M.J. Li X.J. Semin. Immunopathol. 2008; 30: 209-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 24Roos D. Kuhns D.B. Maddalena A. Roesler J. Lopez J.A. Ariga T. Avcin T. de Boer M. Bustamante J.

However, the functional consequences of such mutations have only been studied in the neutrophils of one patient (25Cross A.R. Heyworth P.G. Rae J. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8194-8200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In that study, the authors found that the R54S mutation affects the function of the heme moiety of cytochrome b558 and the electron transfer from the FAD moiety to heme.FIGURE 2Location and conservation of amino acids of the potential second transmembrane α-helix of Nox2 involved in X−-CGD and X+-CGD among Nox family members. Arginine 54 and alanine 57 are highly conserved in the Nox family members, although alanine 53 and cysteine 59 are conserved in Nox1–3 but not in Nox4. Mutations of Arg-54 (R54G, R54M, or R54S) and Ala-57 (A57E) lead to an X+-CGD, except for Cys-59 (C59F), which results in an X0-CGD phenotype. Proline 56 is only present in Nox2, its mutation to aspartic acid leads to an X−-CGD phenotype.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the putative second transmembrane domain of Nox2, containing the sequence 45LLGSALALARAPAACLNFNCMLILL69, on Nox2 expression, INT reductase, and NADPH oxidase activities, as well as FAD binding and NADPH oxidase complex assembly. We approached this study employing site-directed mutagenesis in the X-CGD PLB-985 cell model (26Zhen L. King A.A. Xiao Y. Chanock S.J. Orkin S.H. Dinauer M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 9832-9836Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and by affinity purification of the expressed mutated cytb using the CS9 anti-p22phox antibody (27Lord C.I. Riesselman M.H. Gripentrog J.M. Burritt J.B. Jesaitis A.J. Taylor R.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 2008; 329: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We demonstrated the importance of the second N-terminal putative transmembrane region of Nox2, not studied before, in the structural stability and the control of electron transfer in the phagocytic NADPH oxidase.DISCUSSIONNox2 or gp91phox, the heavy chain of cytb, is the redox element of the NADPH oxidase in which electron transfer from NADPH to molecular oxygen occurs after activation. According to the hydrophobicity profile of its sequence, the N-terminal domain of Nox2 could be structured into six α-helices embedded in the plasma membrane of phagocytic cells (Fig. 1A). However, the organization and the functioning of this region are not fully understood. The objective of this study was to examine the role of the potential second transmembrane α-helix 45LLGSALALARAPAACLNFNCMLILL69 and, more specifically, the role of the underlined residues from Ala-53 to Cys-59, which until now have never been studied.Most of the missense mutations leading to rare X+CGD variants are located in the cytosolic C-terminal tail of Nox2 (28Debeurme F. Picciocchi A. Dagher M.C. Grunwald D. Beaumel S. Fieschi F. Stasia M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 33197-33208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), with the exception of mutations of residues Arg-54 and Ala-57 (23Stasia M.J. Li X.J. Semin. Immunopathol. 2008; 30: 209-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) located in the putative second transmembrane α-helix of Nox2 according to the commonly accepted model (35Paclet M.H. Henderson L.M. Campion Y. Morel F. Dagher M.C. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 981-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition only three missense mutations in this region A53D, P56L, and C59F, lead to X−CGD variants (23Stasia M.J. Li X.J. Semin. Immunopathol. 2008; 30: 209-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We used an original approach, i.e. the reproduction of seven human CGD missense mutations in the PLB-985 cell model, A53D, R54G, R54S, R54M, P56L, A57E, and C59F to study their structural and functional impact on Nox2.We found that A53D, R54G, R54S, R54M, and A57E mutations inhibited NADPH oxidase activity and led to an X+-CGD phenotype, whereas mutation P56L led to an X−CGD case. The most drastic effect was obtained with the change of cysteine 59 to phenylalanine, which totally abrogates the expression of Nox2. Thus a hydrophobic residue (Leu or Phe) at position 56 or 59 of 45LLGSALALARAPAACLNFNCMLILL69 destabilizes the conformation of the entire protein. These residues could be potential sites for anchoring p22phox and/or disulfide bridge formation (Cys-59) during the maturation process of cytb. Recently the D-loop has been described as another possible anchoring region for p22phox (20von Löhneysen K. Noack D. Wood M.R. Friedman J.S. Knaus U.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 961-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).Previously, the functional consequences of the R54S mutation were shown in neutrophils from an X+CGD patient, where only a slight ROS production was observed (25Cross A.R. Heyworth P.G. Rae J. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8194-8200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Using chemiluminescence, we confirmed the weak ROS production in the R54S mutant and in the R54G mutant but not in the R54M mutant. In this instance, the positive charge of Arg-54 appears to be essential for maintaining NADPH oxidase activity. Thus, the change to a neutral residue such as serine or glycine is likely to have a less drastic effect on NADPH oxidase activity than the introduction of a methionine residue with a nonpolar side chain that modifies the electronic environment and leads to steric cluttering. However, we could detect no in vitro NADPH oxidase activity by SOD-sensitive cytochrome c reduction for the R54G and R54S mutants as well, probably because of the low sensitivity of the assay. Additionally, diaphorase activity measured by the INT reduction assay was validated in our X+CGD mutants. The diaphorase activity in plasma membranes and in purified mutated cytbs was normal (R54S, R54M, and R54G) and inhibited by DPI suggesting the normal reduction of flavin in these mutants. The A53D mutant cytochrome b558 had roughly the same properties as the Arg-54 mutants, namely normal diaphorase activity with abolished oxidase activity.Using CS9 immunoaffinity-purified cytbs, we studied INT reduction by the R54S and R54M mutants in more depth. No superoxide production could be detected in contrast to the identically purified WT cytb, which showed normal superoxide production. With the immunopurified cytb558, we also demonstrated that INT reduction actually reflected electron transfer from NADPH to FAD only in the absence of superoxide production. This idea was originally proposed by Poinas et al. (10Poinas A. Gaillard J. Vignais P. Doussiere J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1243-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) but was called into question by Cross et al. (9Cross A.R. Yarchover J.L. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21448-21454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who observed a 1-nm shift in the reduced minus oxidized difference spectrum of the R54G mutant at the Soret band, in a crude membrane fraction (25Cross A.R. Heyworth P.G. Rae J. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8194-8200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Using R54S, and R54M mutant cytb, purified almost to homogeneity (purity >95%), we found that the peak values at 426 and 558 nm of the reduced minus oxidized absorbance difference spectra were exactly superimposable on those of WT-Nox2 PLB-985 cells, supporting correctly incorporated hemes in the mutant Nox2. We also found no difference in the oxidized and reduced spectra of the mutated cytbs (data not shown). Finally, NADPH oxidase complex assembly during phagocytosis and the binding of FAD were normal in the Arg-54 and the Ala-53 mutant cells. In conclusion, the absence of NADPH oxidase activity in R54G, R54S, and R54M and A53E mutant cells can be explained if alanine 53 and arginine 54 are essential residues involved in the control of electron flow from FAD to molecular oxygen.The A57E mutation, like the other X+CGD mutants of this region, totally inhibited NADPH oxidase activity, but surprisingly, diaphorase activity was 30% of control in purified plasma membranes. For purified A57E cytb, this residual INT reductase activity was dependent on the presence of p67phox and Rac. Increasing amounts of p67phox did not change the initial Vmax values, but we found about a 3-fold reduction in the affinity of purified A57E cytb for p67phox. Phagocytosis of latex beads in the mutated A57E PLB-985 cell line revealed a partial defect in p67phox translocation to the plasma membrane. WT and A57E mutated peptides used in competition experiments had no effect on diaphorase activity of WT Nox2 plasma membranes suggesting that the second transmembrane α-helix is not directly involved in the binding of cytosolic factors during oxidase assembly. In addition, FAD binding in the plasma membranes of the A57E mutant was diminished (about 30% of the control), but the affinity of the purified A57E cytb for FAD was only slightly affected compared with WT-Nox2. Thus, we conclude that the partial inhibition of diaphorase activity in the A57E mutant may result from a defect of FAD access to its binding site resulting from nonoptimal oxidase assembly. Mutation of alanine 57 to an acidic residue clearly modifies the net charge of the region, and directly or indirectly it disturbs the integrity of the dehydrogenase domain leading to partial inhibition of electron transfer from NADPH to FAD (Fig. 1B). This also suggests some interaction between the transmembrane domain and the cytosolic dehydrogenase domain of Nox2.Recently, the B-loops of Nox4 and Nox2 have been proposed as an interface between the dehydrogenase domains and the transmembrane domains of Nox enzymes (21Jackson H.M. Kawahara T. Nisimoto Y. Smith S.M. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 10281-10290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, the B-loop is involved in the oxidase assembly process of the phagocytic NADPH oxidase (19Biberstine-Kinkade K.J. Yu L. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10451-10457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Very recently, a charged peptide 86CSTRVRRQL94 mimicking part of the B-loop sequence was demonstrated to be an isoform-specific inhibitor of Nox2 showing that the B-loop is important in maintaining the oxidase activity (36Csanyi G. Cifuentes-Pagano E. Al Ghouleh I. Ranayhossaini D.J. Egana L. Lopes L.R. Jackson H.R. Kelley E.E. Pagano P.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2011; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, by using a peptide mimicking the charged sequence of the B-loop, we showed that the B-loop controls the diaphorase activity of Nox2 and that the second transmembrane α-helix of Nox2 influences the function of the B-loop. The presence of an acidic residue at position 57 would interfere with the structural organization of the B-loop thus explaining the partial oxidase assembly and inhibited diaphorase activity of this mutant. In Taylor's model of the “dehydrogenase” domain of Nox2 (11Taylor W.R. Jones D.T. Segal A.W. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1675-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), there is an open space above the NADPH- and FAD-binding sites. This void could provide a region for other cytoplasmic residues to be involved in the organization of the NADPH/FAD-binding site so as to control electron transfer (11Taylor W.R. Jones D.T.

Candidates include the C-terminal aromatic residue Phe-570, a conserved and essential residue in the whole ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase family, and/or the region centered on Cys-369, which is a docking site for p67phox (28Debeurme F.

(37Dang P.M. Babior B.M. Smith R.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5746-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) also proposed that p67phox had a FAD-binding site that could participate to the electron flow from the NADPH on Nox2. Crystallization and resolution of the structure of the N-terminal part of Nox2 will be of great help in confirming the organization of these different structures involved in the control of p67phox anchoring, FAD binding, and dehydrogenase activity. IntroductionPhagocytic cells such as neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, or eosinophils possess an essential NADPH oxidase in their plasma membranes that produces microbicidal oxidants to kill pathogens during an infection. The integral membrane proteins gp91phox or Nox2 and p22phox form heterodimers called flavocytochrome b (cytb), 4The abbreviations used are: cytbflavocytochrome b558ROSreactive oxygen speciesCGDchronic granulomatous diseasePMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateDMFdimethylformamideDPIdiphenylene iodoniumINTiodonitrotetrazoliumSODsuperoxide dismutaseNoxNADPH oxidaseGTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). the core electron transferase of the oxidase. The phagocyte NADPH oxidase is dormant in resting cells and becomes activated during phagocytosis to produce superoxide, a precursor for a variety of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Indeed, after stimulus-dependent activation, cytosolic factors such as p67phox, p47phox, p40phox, and Rac2 migrate to the plasma or phagosomal membranes and assemble with cytb to form an activated NADPH oxidase complex (1Aliverti A. Piubelli L. Zanetti G. Lübberstedt T. Herrmann R.G. Curti B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6374-6380Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).In the past few years, several proteins homologous to Nox2 were discovered to be superoxide/peroxide-producing NADPH oxidases (the Nox family of NADPH oxidases, Nox1, Nox3, Nox4, and Nox5) (2Kawahara T. Quinn M.T. Lambeth J.D. BMC Evol. Biol. 2007; 7: 109Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 3Sumimoto H. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 3249-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The activation mechanism and tissue distribution of the various members of the family are markedly different from Nox2. In addition, the physiological functions of the Nox family members include not only host defense but also cellular signaling, cell differentiation, and gene regulation. They are widely involved in a range of pathological processes such as cardiovascular diseases and neurological disorders (4Bedard K. Krause K.H. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 245-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (4802) Google Scholar). However, these proteins share a similar structural organization and the capacity to transport electrons across the plasma membrane and to generate superoxide and other downstream ROS. Nox2 is the prototype NADPH oxidase, and its biochemical features have been extensively studied. Elucidating the function of Nox2 will allow a better understanding of the entire family of Nox proteins. Indeed, because of the involvement of ROS-producing Nox in various disease processes, these enzymes are potentially prime drug targets (5Jaquet V. Scapozza L. Clark R.A. Krause K.H. Lambeth J.D. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2009; 11: 2535-2552Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Thus, it is essential to fully understand the mechanism of electron transfer in this protein family to gain control of its function.Homology modeling of the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain part of the Nox family of proteins with members of the ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase family suggests the presence of FAD- and NADPH-binding sites (6Segal A.W.

https://openalex.org/W2143731802,"In this study, we have applied Surface Enhanced Resonance Raman Scattering (SERRS) technology to the specific detection of DNA. We present an innovative SERRS sandwich-hybridization assay that allows specific DNA detection without any enzymatic amplification, such as is the case with Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). In some substrates, such as ancient or processed remains, enzymatic amplification fails due to DNA alteration (degradation, chemical modification) or to the presence of inhibitors. Consequently, the development of a non-enzymatic method, allowing specific DNA detection, could avoid long, expensive and inconclusive amplification trials. Here, we report the proof of concept of a SERRS sandwich-hybridization assay that leads to the detection of a specific chamois DNA. This SERRS assay reveals its potential as a non-enzymatic alternative technology to DNA amplification methods (particularly the PCR method) with several applications for species detection. As the amount and type of damage highly depend on the preservation conditions, the present SERRS assay would enlarge the range of samples suitable for DNA analysis and ultimately would provide exciting new opportunities for the investigation of ancient DNA in the fields of evolutionary biology and molecular ecology, and of altered DNA in food frauds detection and forensics."
https://openalex.org/W2042681534,"Objective Subjects with Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) are at increased risk of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The mechanism of this enhanced risk is unclear. Circulating vascular progenitor cells (VPC) are immature bone marrow derived cells capable of differentiating into mature endothelial cells. VPC number/function and central arterial stiffness predict cardio-metabolic disease in at-risk populations. Design We studied VPC and arterial stiffness measures in non-obese PCOS subjects as compared to age and body mass index (BMI) matched healthy controls in a cross–sectional study. Methods Fourteen subjects with PCOS and 12 controls of similar age, BMI (all <30 kg/m2) and metabolic profile were studied. VPC number and in vitro function were studied by flow cytometry and tube formation assays respectively. Augmentation index (AIx), a measure of central arterial stiffness, and central (aortic) blood pressures (BP) were measured by applanation tonometry. Results Subjects with PCOS had a reduced number, mean±SEM, of circulating CD34+133+ VPCs (317.5±51.0 vs. 558.3±101.2, p = 0.03) and impaired in vitro tube formation (completed tube area 1.0±0.06 vs. 1.2±0.05×106 µm2 p = 0.02). PCOS subjects had significantly higher AIx (18.4±1.9% vs. 4.9±2.0%) and this difference remained significant even after adjustments for age, BMI and smoking (p = 0.003) in multivariate analyses. Central systolic and pulse pressure were higher in PCOS subjects but these differences were not statistically significant after adjustment for age. Brachial systolic and pulse pressures were similar. VPC number/function and arterial stiffness or BP measures were not correlated. Conclusions Non-obese PCOS is characterized by a reduced VPC number, impaired VPC function and increased central arterial stiffness. These changes in novel vascular risk markers may explain the enhanced risk of T2DM and CVD in PCOS."
https://openalex.org/W2085450529,"Background PCA3 (prostate cancer antigen 3) gene is one of the most prostate cancer-specific genes at present. Consequently, the prostate-specific expression and the sharp up-regulation of PCA3 mRNA in prostate cancer suggest a unique transcriptional regulation, which possibly can be attributed to promoter polymorphism. In our study, we evaluated whether there is polymorphism in PCA3 promoter region and also assess the association of the polymorphism with prostate cancer. Methodology/Principal Findings We designed a specific primer set to screen the promoter of PCA3 gene by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based cloning and sequencing with the DNA extracted from peripheral blood samples of prostate cancer (PCa) cases (n = 186) and healthy control cases (n = 135). Genotype-specific risks were estimated as odds ratios (ORs) with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by chi-square test. Possible deviation of the genotype frequencies from controls and PCa cases expected under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was assessed by the chi-square test. Short tandem repeat polymorphism of TAAA was found in the promoter region of PCA3 gene, five polymorphisms and eight genotypes were identified. The eight genotypes were divided into three groups: ≤10TAAA, 11TAAA, ≥12TAAA. The group 11TAAA and ≥12TAAA were associated with higher relative risk for prostate cancer than group ≤10TAAA (OR = 1.76, 95%CI = 1.07–2.89[for group 11TAAA]; OR = 5.28, 95%CI = 1.76–15.89[for group ≥12TAAA]). Conclusions/Significance The presence of the (TAAA)n short tandem repeat polymorphisms in the PCA3 promoter region may be a risk factor for prostate cancer in the Chinese population."
https://openalex.org/W1975873060,"Many scientific investigations depend on obtaining data-driven, accurate, robust and computationally-tractable parameter estimates. In the face of unavoidable intrinsic variability, there are different algorithmic approaches, prior assumptions and fundamental principles for computing point and interval estimates. Efficient and reliable parameter estimation is critical in making inference about observable experiments, summarizing process characteristics and prediction of experimental behaviors. In this manuscript, we demonstrate simulation, construction, validation and interpretation of confidence intervals, under various assumptions, using the interactive web-based tools provided by the Statistics Online Computational Resource (http://www.SOCR.ucla.edu). Specifically, we present confidence interval examples for population means, with known or unknown population standard deviation; population variance; population proportion (exact and approximate), as well as confidence intervals based on bootstrapping or the asymptotic properties of the maximum likelihood estimates. Like all SOCR resources, these confidence interval resources may be openly accessed via an Internet-connected Java-enabled browser. The SOCR confidence interval applet enables the user to empirically explore and investigate the effects of the confidence-level, the sample-size and parameter of interest on the corresponding confidence interval. Two applications of the new interval estimation computational library are presented. The first one is a simulation of confidence interval estimating the US unemployment rate and the second application demonstrates the computations of point and interval estimates of hippocampal surface complexity for Alzheimers disease patients, mild cognitive impairment subjects and asymptomatic controls."
https://openalex.org/W2078756905,"Previous epidemiological studies in humans and experimental studies in animals indicate that survivors of severe sepsis exhibit deficiencies in the activation and effector function of immune cells. In particular, CD4+ T lymphocytes can exhibit reduced proliferative capacity and improper cytokine responses following sepsis. To further investigate the cell-intrinsic defects of CD4+ T cells following sepsis, splenic CD4+ T cells from sham surgery and post-septic mice were transferred into lymphopenic mice. These recipient mice were then subjected to both TH1-(purified protein derivative) and TH2-(Schistosoma mansoni egg antigen) driven models of granulomatous lung inflammation. Post-septic CD4+ T cells mediated smaller TH1 and larger TH2 lung granulomas as compared to mice receiving CD4+ T cells from sham surgery donors. However, cytokine production by lymph node cells in antigen restimulation assays indicated increased pan-specific cytokine expression by post-septic CD4+ T cell recipient mice in both TH1 and TH2 granuloma models. These include increased production of TH2 cytokines in TH1 inflammation, and increased production of TH1 cytokines in TH2 inflammation. These results suggest that cell-intrinsic defects in CD4+ T cell effector function can have deleterious effects on inflammatory processes post-sepsis, due to a defect in the proper regulation of TH-specific cytokine expression."
https://openalex.org/W2151451173,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is inherently resistant to the majority of clinical anticancer drugs. To obtain drugs that can circumvent or evade such inherent drug resistance of HCC, we investigated the effect of the marinely derived steroid methyl spongoate (MESP) on HCC cells. MESP displayed potent cell killing against a panel of six HCC cell lines, independent of their expression of drug transporters. MESP did not change the function of the drug transporters, and its cell killing was not impaired in multidrug-resistant cancer cells overexpressing the transporters. The cell killing of MESP was irrelevant to estrogen or androgen signaling and was not associated with cell cycle progression, inhibition of microtubules, and topoisomerases. In contrast, MESP potently induced apoptosis via activation of a proapoptotic caspase cascade and relief of the suppression of antiapoptotic signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling. MESP inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT3, a critical survival signaling factor that reduced the expression of the antiapoptotic protein x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein but enhanced the expression of the proapoptotic protein Bax, thus promoting caspase-dependent apoptosis. These data reveal that MESP may well serve as an important candidate drug lead for HCC therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1979093757,"The asexual cycle of the parasite Toxoplasma gondii has two developmental stages: a rapidly replicating form called a tachyzoite and a slow growing cyst form called a bradyzoite. While the importance of ATP-independent histone modifications for gene regulation in T. gondii have been demonstrated, ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling pathways have not been examined. In this study we characterized C9, an insertional mutant showing reduced expression of bradyzoite differentiation marker BAG1, in cultured human fibroblasts. This mutant contains an insertion in the gene encoding TgRSC8, which is homologous to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins Rsc8p (remodel the structure of chromatin complex subunit 8) and Swi3p (switch/sucrose non-fermentable [SWI/SNF]) of ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes. In the C9 mutant, TgRSC8 is the downstream open reading frame on a dicistronic transcript. Though protein was expressed from the downstream gene of the dicistron, TgRSC8 levels were decreased in C9 from those of wild-type parasites, as determined by western immunoblot and flow cytometry. As TgRSC8 localized to the parasite nucleus, we postulated a role in gene regulation. Transcript levels of several markers were assessed by quantitative PCR to test this hypothesis. The C9 mutant displayed reduced steady state transcript levels of bradyzoite-induced genes BAG1, LDH2, SUSA1, and ENO1, all of which were significantly increased with addition of TgRSC8 to the mutant. Transcript levels of some bradyzoite markers were unaltered in C9, or unable to be increased by complementation with TgRSC8, indicating multiple pathways control bradyzoite-upregulated genes. Together, these data suggest a role for TgRSC8 in control of bradyzoite-upregulated gene expression. Thus chromatin remodeling, by both ATP-independent and dependent mechanisms, is an important mode of gene regulation during stage differentiation in parasites."

https://openalex.org/W2089325201,"Background The use of cellular coreceptors and modulation of cytokine concentrations by HIV to establish a productive infection is well documented. However, it is unknown whether the expression of these proteins affects the course of HIV clade A and D disease, reported to have different progression rates. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated whether the number of CD4+ T-cells expressing CCR5 or CXCR4, the density of these coreceptors and concentrations of specific immune proteins linked to HIV pathogenesis vary between individuals infected with HIV clade A or D. We undertook additional analyses stratifying participants by early (CD4>500 cells/µl) or late (CD4<200 cells/µl) disease stage. Whole blood samples were taken from 50 HIV-1 infected individuals drawn from cohorts in rural south-west Uganda. Late stage participants had less than half the number of CD4+/CCR5+ T-cells (p = 0.0113) and 5.6 times fewer CD4+/CXCR4+ cells (p<0.0001) than early stage participants. There was also a statistically significant difference in the density of CXCR4 on CD4+ cells between clade A and D infected early stage participants (142 [A] vs 84 [D]; p = 0.0146). Across all participants we observed significantly higher concentration of Th1 cytokines compared to Th2 (66.4 vs 23.8 pg/ml; p<0.0001). Plasma concentrations of IFNγ and IL-2 were 1.8 and 2.4 fold lower respectively in Late-D infected participants compared to Late-A participants. MIP-1β levels also decreased from 118.0 pg/ml to 47.1 pg/ml (p = 0.0396) as HIV disease progressed. Conclusions/Significance We observed specific alterations in the abundance of CD4+/CCR5+ and CD4+/CXCR4+ T-cells, and concentrations of immune proteins across different HIV clades and as infection progresses. Our results suggest that these changes are unlikely to explain the observed differences in disease progression between subtype A and D infections. However, our observations further the understanding of the natural progression of non-clade B HIV infection and how the virus adapts to exploit the host environment."
