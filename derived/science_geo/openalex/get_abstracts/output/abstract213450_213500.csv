This indicates the occurrence of recognition and habituation of visual responsiveness to specific patterns, and suggests that familiarization with the environment begins through visual exploration before more active exploration is possible."

https://openalex.org/W2072362225,"A method of hue measurement, in which an absolute color-naming procedure is utilized, has been applied to spectral stimuli delivered as flashes at 0 degrees, 20 degrees, and 40 degrees eccentricity in an otherwise dark field. The method yields very reliable measures, especially at 0 degrees. Color-naming at 0 degrees differs little from that at 20 degrees, but a marked deterioration of performance occurs between 20 and 40 degrees. This is reflected by a reduction in red and especially green responses, and a lower reliability of the measurements. Additional estimates were also obtained which showed a decrease in measured saturation but increasing reliability of the saturation measurements with increasing eccentricity."
https://openalex.org/W1976555839,"Although actinomycin D has been used to prevent protein synthesis in experiments of several hours' duration, its effects on the synthesis of adaptive enzymes which are induced over a period of several days have received less attention. Treatment of young rats with doses of actinomycin D, which permitted survival for a period of 5 days, resulted in marked increases in the activities of four hepatic enzymes known to be induced by cortisol: alanine transaminase, tyrosine transaminase, serine dehydrase, and tryptophan pyrrolase. Actinomycin D also induced responses of two of these enzymes in adrenalectomized rats."

https://openalex.org/W2047606550,"It is suggested that DDT and perhaps other chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides owe their activity to the formation of a charge-transfer complex with a component of the nerve axon, with consequent disturbance of function. Experimental evidence is provided for the formation of two complexes with components of cockroach nerve; the complexes have been partially purified. Their formation is accompanied by an absorption in the 245- to 270-millimicron range."

https://openalex.org/W1982374158,"In normal alveolar cells of the mammary gland of C3H/HeJ female mice, DNA synthesis lasts an average of 20.7 hours with a coefficient of variation of 26.6 percent. Treatment of the mice with I microgram of 17-beta-estradiol and 1 milligram of progesterone per day for 3 to 4 days decreases the average duration to 10.7 hours and the coefficient of variation to 13.8 percent."

Neither orientation nor grooming alone facilitated the sucking drive to any significant extent."

https://openalex.org/W2039524665,The formation of 19S antibody to poliovirus by rabbit spleen cells in vitro was interrupted by adding actinomycin D (1 to 10 micrograms per milliliter) for 30 minutes or longer. Shorter treatment (5 to 15 minutes) caused partial suppression. Antibody formation was slowly renewed upon removal of the drug. These results suggest that 19S antibody formation is contingent upon DNA-dependent RNA synthesis and that the genetic messenger has an average lifetime of one-half day or less. Treatment with chloramphenicol (20 to 50 micrograms per milliliter) for 3 days caused the cessation of 19S antibody formation.

N hydrogen bond of the guanine-cytosine base pair have been calculated quantum mechanically for the ground state, a charge-transfer excited state, and positive and negative ionic states. These results are consistent with the idea that tautomeric rearrangement can be a cause of radiation induced mutation or carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2045498945,"Water-soluble components of total cigarette smoke inhibit cell growth and protein synthesis by the KB line of human cells. The cytotoxic components were in both the gas phase and the particulate phase of smoke. Conventional filters of cellulose acetate reduced cytotoxicity of the particulate phase in proportion to the weight of particles trapped, that is, they did not alter the specific activity of the particulate phase. Appropriately designed filters containing activated charcoal granules selectively reduced cytotoxic components in cigarette smoke which would have appeared in both phases, although the reduction, as anticipated, occurred to a greater extent in the gas phase."
https://openalex.org/W1633155596,"When incorporated into a nutrient overlay, the carcinogenic hydrocarbons benzo[a]pyrene and 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene inhibit plaque formation by herpes virus and vaccinia virus, DNA viruses, but not by Sindbis virus, an RNA virus. These carcinogens also decrease herpes and vaccinia virus yields in liquid medium, without affecting Sindbis virus yields. Four structurally related, but noncarcinogenic polycyclic hydrocarbons, namely benzo[e]pyrene, pyrene, benz[a]anthracene and anthracene, have no inhibitory effect on DNA virus replication. Taken together with the known inhibition of interferon production, these effects on virus growth resemble the action of actinomycin D and hence provide evidence for a selective interaction of these carcinogens with DNA."

https://openalex.org/W2054820646,"MEMBERS of the aquatic sub-family Anisopinae (Notonectidae, Hemiptera) are remarkable for at least two reasons. They possess a large number of tracheal cells in the abdomen packed with haemoglobin1–3, and they are able to remain poised in mid-water for a considerable part of each dive. Both Hutchinson4 and Hungerford5 have suggested that this exploitation of the mid-water environment is made possible by the presence of haemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W2000499715,β-D-GLUCOSIDURONIC acid synthesis carried out by the mucosal membrane of the stomach and intestine has been previously demonstrated1–4. This function is strongest in the duodenum. The mechanism of this β-D-glucosiduronic acid conjugation is the same as in the liver; uridine-diphosphoglucosiduronic acid acts as a glucuronic acid donator; this is oxidated by a specific dehydrogenase enzyme system and the final transfer of glucuronic acid is carried out by specific glucuronyl transferase enzymes5.

https://openalex.org/W2039422211,"Mice were irradiated at several different exposure rates so that they received a total of 900 roentgens over the whole body. Within 2 hours they were injected with rat bone marrow. The success of the transplantation depended upon the rate at which the animals had been irradiated: the higher the rate, the greater the success of the grafts. Failure of grafts in mice subjected to low exposure-rates was associated with antibody formation. The data indicate existence of an immune mechanism which is dependent on the radiation exposure-rate."

In investigating the pharmacological properties of a new series of cyclobutanes6, one of them, 3-dimethylamino-2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-cyclobutanol, was found to exhibit a lowering activity of the blood pressure of long duration. The pharmacological properties of the cis isomer of this tertiary amine were qualitatively similar to those of the trans isomer. The cis isomer appeared, however, to be slightly less active when tested for hypotensive activity. Beard and Burger7 have recently reported the synthesis of the cis and trans isomers of 3-dimethylamino cyclo-butanol. They found the antispasmodic activity of the cis isomer of the diphenylacetic acid ester of 3-dimethylamino cyclobutanol to be slightly less than that of the trans isomer."
