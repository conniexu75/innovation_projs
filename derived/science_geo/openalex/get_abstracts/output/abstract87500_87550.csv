https://openalex.org/W1967072335,"The locus for the cellular myc (c-myc) oncogene in humans is located on the region of chromosome 8 that is translocated to chromosome 14 in cells from most undifferentiated B-cell lymphomas. It is shown in this study that the c-myc locus is rearranged in 5 out of 15 cell lines from patients with undifferentiated B-cell lymphomas, and that the rearrangement involves a region at the 5' side of an apparently intact c-myc gene. In at least three patients, this rearranged region appears to contain immunoglobulin heavy chain mu sequences that are located on chromosome 14. The data indicate that this region contains the crossover point between chromosomes 8 and 14. The break point can occur at different positions on both chromosomes among individual cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W1501688570,"We have previously shown that purified rat liver cytochromes P-450c and P-450d share some but not all immunochemical determinants (Reik, L. M., Levin, W., Ryan, D.E., and Thomas, P.E. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 3950-3957). Antibody to cytochrome P-450d cross-reacts with cytochrome P-450c to form an immunoprecipitin band in the Ouchterlony test, but no detectable immunoprecipitin ring is formed in a radial immunodiffusion assay. However, the addition of purified cytochrome P-450c to purified cytochrome P-450d in the radial immunodiffusion assay alters the cytochrome P-450d standard curve. Appropriate corrections have been made for the interference of cytochrome P-450c in the immunoquantitation of cytochrome P-450d. Twelve structurally diverse xenobiotics have been examined for their capacity to modulate the levels of cytochrome P-450d, as well as cytochromes P-450a, P-450b, and P-450c, in rat liver microsomes. Five compounds (isosafrole, 3-methylcholanthrene, beta-naphthoflavone, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, and phenothiazine) and the polychlorinated biphenyl mixture Aroclor 1254 are potent in vivo inducers of cytochrome P-450d (0.44-0.89 nmol of cytochrome P-450d/mg of microsomal protein). Control rats have low levels of this microsomal hemoprotein (0.04-0.05 nmol of cytochrome P-450d/mg of microsomal protein). Isosafrole induces cytochrome P-450d to a greater extent than cytochrome P-450c, Aroclor 1254 induces both hemoproteins to similar extents, and the remaining four compounds preferentially induce cytochrome P-450c relative to cytochrome P-450d. All of these structurally diverse compounds induce cytochromes P-450d and P-450c, suggesting that the inducibility of these cytochrome P-450 isozymes, but not cytochromes P-450a and P-450b, is linked."
https://openalex.org/W2008226823,"We have isolated overlapping genomic clones that contain a single-copy myosin heavy-chain gene of Drosophila melanogaster. By the criteria of hybridization under nonstringent conditions, this is the only myosin heavy-chain gene of the fly. The gene is localized to the chromosomal region 36B. The transcriptional unit has a length of about 19 kb and contains at least nine introns. There are three mature mRNA species expressed from the gene, with molecular lengths of 7.2 kb, 8.0 kb and 8.6 kb. The former two are expressed abundantly during those stages of development when larval muscle proteins are being synthesized; the latter two are expressed when the principal muscle proteins of the adult are made. The three transcripts differ primarily in their respective patterns of splicing at the 3' ends."

https://openalex.org/W1996645520,"A method is described for obtaining antibody-producing hybridomas that are preferentially retained in cultures of fused mouse spleen and myeloma cells. Hybridomas are produced by fusing mouse myeloma cells that are deficient in adenosine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) with mouse spleen cells containing Robertsonian 8.12 translocation chromosomes. The cell fusion mixtures are exposed to a culture medium that can be utilized only by APRT-positive cells, which results in the elimination of both unfused APRT-deficient myeloma cells and non-antibody-producing APRT-deficient hybridomas that arise by segregation of the 8.12 translocation chromosomes containing the APRT genes and the active heavy chain immunoglobulin gene."
https://openalex.org/W2000924875,"We have isolated and sequenced cDNA and genomic clones of the murine E alpha gene, one of the immune response genes of the major histocompatibility complex. Comparison of our data with those recently reported for the human homolog DR alpha shows an identical intron-exon structure, and a good conservation of the protein-coding sequences, including the amino acids potentially involved in organizing the second external protein domain into an immunoglobulin-like fold. Noncoding sequences are less conserved, with the exception of the promoter region. Finally, we show that differential expression of the gene in various cell types appears to be transcriptionally regulated, and that genomic rearrangements do not seem necessary for expression."

https://openalex.org/W2121841748,"We have analyzed several closely related members of the gene family encoding the variable regions of human immunoglobulin kappa light chains (Vκ genes). Two of these genes differ at a single nucleotide out of 940 bases sequenced, and are believed to be alleles of a locus called HK101. This substitution results in an amino acid replacement in the first complementarity-determining region of the kappa chain. We also compared the structures of two nonallelic human Vκ loci (HK101 and HK137) and found a high degree of sequence homology over a region at least 13.5 kb long. This long block of homology indicates that these two loci arose from a recent gene duplication. The DNA sequences of these two nonallelic Vκ genes exhibit a very unusual distribution of nucleotide substitutions. Seven of the ten substitutions found among 940 bases are clustered in a 39 base stretch encoding the first complementarity-determining region and the second framework region of the protein. We suggest that this cluster of substitutions was generated by a gene conversion in which a small segment of one gene was replaced with the homologous segment from another Vκ gene."

https://openalex.org/W1976782840,"A mutant in src, the oncogene of Rous sarcoma virus, has been constructed in which the major phosphorylated tyrosine (Tyr-416, located in the carboxy-terminal half of the protein) has been replaced by phenylalanine. Mouse cells transformed with this mutant src form foci and grow in soft agar, indicative of a transformed state. Also, the mutant protein retains the wild-type ability to phosphorylate proteins on tyrosine. Partial proteolysis revealed that the carboxy-terminal half of the mutant protein was still phosphorylated, although apparently to a lesser extent. Analysis indicated that this residual phosphorylation was on tyrosine. We conclude that the major tyrosine phosphorylation in pp60v-src is not required for two of the protein's notable properties--protein kinase activity and transformation of cultured cells."
https://openalex.org/W1539889565,"Human platelets prelabeled with (32P)orthophosphate or [14C]arachidonic acid (AA) were stimulated with collagen or thrombin, and platelet activation (shape change, aggregation, and release of serotonin) was determined in parallel to the formation of 32P- or 14C-labeled phosphatidic acid (PA). The results show a close correlation between the degree of platelet activation and the amount of PA formed. Activation of platelets and formation of PA induced by collagen (2 to 20 micrograms/ml) was blocked by pretreatment of platelets with trifluoperazine, indomethacin, aspirin, or N-methylimidazole. This suggests that the formation of AA by phospholipase A2 and its subsequent metabolism by cyclooxygenase and thromboxane synthetase are required for the collagen-induced formation of PA. Endoperoxide analog U-44069 induces formation of PA in human platelets that have been pretreated with or without aspirin. The action of thrombin does not follow the same pattern of collagen. Low concentrations of thrombin (0.05 units/ml) induce only platelet shape change and a small stimulation of PA, changes which are only minimally inhibited by indomethacin. However, a small increase in the thrombin concentration (to 0.1 unit/ml) induces platelet aggregation, release of serotonin, and a sharp increase in PA accumulation which are effectively inhibited by indomethacin. Even higher thrombin concentrations (0.4 to 0.8 units/ml), however, result in a further stimulation of PA formation, platelet aggregation, and release of serotonin which are insensitive to inhibition by indomethacin. The data show that cyclooxygenase metabolites of AA, produced after platelet activation, may be differentially involved in the formation of PA in platelets stimulated with collagen or thrombin. Formation of PA following collagen or intermediate concentrations of thrombin (0.1 to 0.2 units/ml) is dependent on the cyclooxygenase pathway. However, formation of PA by very low or by high concentrations of thrombin is not mediated by cyclooxygenase metabolites of AA."
https://openalex.org/W1500963490,"The biosynthesis of the proteinase inhibitor alpha 1-antitrypsin has been studied in rat hepatocyte primary cultures. Newly synthesized alpha 1-antitrypsin was found in hepatocytes as a glycoprotein of an apparent molecular weight of 49,000 carrying oligosaccharide side chains of the high mannose type. In the hepatocyte medium a secreted alpha 1-antitrypsin of an apparent molecular weight of 54,000 could be identified as a glycoprotein with carbohydrate chains of the complex type. Pulse-chase experiments revealed a precursor-product relationship for the two forms of alpha 1-antitrypsin. When the hepatocytes were treated with swainsonine, an intracellular form of alpha 1-antitrypsin with an apparent molecular weight of 49,000 indistinguishable from that of control cells was found. However, the alpha 1-antitrypsin secreted from swainsonine-treated hepatocytes was different from that present in control media. It was characterized by a lower apparent molecular weight (51,000), a higher amount of [3H]mannose incorporation, half as much incorporation of [3H]galactose, and the same amount of [3H]fucose incorporation compared to alpha 1-antitrypsin of control media. In contrast to the 54,000 complex type alpha 1-antitrypsin from control media the 51,000 alpha 1-antitrypsin from the medium of swainsonine-treated cells was found to be susceptible to the action of endoglucosaminidase H, even when fucose was attached to the proximal GlcNAc residue. alpha 1-Antitrypsin secreted from swainsonine-treated cells combines features usually associated with either high mannose or complex type oligosaccharides and therefore represents a hybrid structure. In spite of its effect on the carbohydrate part of alpha 1-antitrypsin swainsonine did not impair the secretion of the incompletely processed glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1578425722,"The regulation of prolactin RNA sequences by Ca2+, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), singly and in combination, was studied in GH3 cells incubated in a chemically defined medium. Ca2+ increased all large prolactin RNA sequences in the nucleus, thus suggesting a transcriptional site of action. A recently developed cytoplasmic dot hybridization procedure was employed to study regulation of cytoplasmic prolactin mRNA. Ca2+ alone stimulated prolactin mRNA with a lag of between 3 and 9 h and yielded a sizable final increase (14- to 18-fold) of prolactin mRNA. With EGTA present to chelate any residual Ca2+, prolactin mRNA was not detectably increased by TRH, showing that TRH requires Ca2+ to stimulate prolactin mRNA. Under these conditions, prolactin mRNA was only slightly (4-fold) increased by EGF. Either peptide plus an optimal concentration of Ca2+ yielded a 60- to 70-fold increase in prolactin mRNA, showing that both EGF and TRH regulate prolactin mRNA synergistically with Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1564647846,"An NAD:arginine mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase has been purified 270,000-fold from turkey erythrocytes through a five-step chromatographic procedure to apparent electrophoretic homogeneity. Molecular weight determinations of the enzyme by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, Ultrogel AcA 54, and TSK 3000 SW gel filtration were consistent with Mr = 32,000. The purified enzyme utilized arginine, other low molecular weight guanidino compounds, and various proteins as ADP-ribose acceptors. The Km values for NAD and arginine methyl ester were 36 and 3,000 microM, respectively. Unlike another transferase purified from turkey erythrocytes (Moss, J., and Stanley, S.J. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78, 4809-4812), this enzyme was not activated by chaotropic salts or micromolar concentrations of histone. Thus, two distinct soluble ADP-ribosyltransferases may be present in turkey erythrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1564122790,"beta 2-Glycoprotein I (beta 2GI) has recently been identified as a component of circulating plasma lipoproteins. The metabolic role of this apolipoprotein is not known with certainty; it has been reported that beta 2GI has a high affinity for triglyceride-rich particles, causing their selective precipitation by detergents, and activates lipoprotein lipase in the in vitro hydrolysis of artificial lipid emulsions. In the present report, we have evaluated the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure of lipid-free beta 2GI. The weight average molecular weight of beta 2GI, as determined by sedimentation equilibrium measurements, was 43,000 in the presence and absence of denaturing agents. Thus, in contrast to other apolipoproteins, apolipoprotein H (apo-H) does not self-associate in aqueous solution. The circular dichroic spectra of apo-H is unusual in that there are no strong negative bands in the far-ultraviolet region of the spectrum; there is a weak positive maximum at 235 nm and a relatively weak negative maximum at 205 nm. Treatment with guanidinium chloride results in a loss of the positive band with only minor changes in the intensity of the band at 205 nm. Apolipoproteins A-I, A-II, C-I, and E, in contrast, have a secondary structure that contains a high percentage of residues in an alpha-helical configuration and undergo major changes in structure at low concentrations of guanidinium chloride. Highly flexible proteins, such as apolipoproteins A-I, A-II, and C-I, absorb rapidly and reversibly to air-water interfaces, whereas more rigid proteins, such as the classical globular proteins, interact with the interface more slowly and irreversibly. This difference is due to the loosely folded tertiary structure of apolipoproteins and the ease with which they can change structure to accommodate a given environment. The surface activity of beta 2GI at neutral pH resembles that of typical globular proteins. Treatment with acid or base, although causing only minor changes in the circular dichroic spectra, resulted in major increases in the rate of absorption to an air-water interface; under these conditions the rates of absorption were similar to that found for apolipoprotein A-I. These results are consistent with a more flexible structure for beta 2GI in acid or base that resembles other loosely folded apolipoproteins. beta 2GI associates with plasma lipoproteins and satisfies all of the criteria to be classified as an apolipoprotein. The secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure of beta 2GI is, however, quite different from that of other well characterized apolipoproteins. This difference in structure would be expected to affect protein-lipid interactions; the relationship between apo-H and other apolipoproteins may be similar to that proposed for integral versus peripheral membrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1530950071,"Two major serum components from the dogfish, Mustelus canis, have been isolated using affinity chromatography. Both proteins bind to an AH-Sepharose 4B-phosphorylcholine affinity matrix in the presence of Ca2+ and are eluted from the column by EDTA. Upon readdition of Ca2+ to the eluted proteins, the two proteins can be separated by passage through a column of Sepharose CL-4B. The first protein, C-reactive protein, passes through the Sepharose CL-4B column in the presence of Ca2+ whereas the second protein, serum amyloid P component, remains bound. The serum amyloid P component is then eluted from the Sepharose CL-4B in pure form by EDTA. The dogfish C-reactive protein isolated by the phosphorylcholine affinity matrix precipitates with pneumococcal C-polysaccharide and with a synthetic derivative of bovine serum albumin to which phosphorylcholine is covalently attached. The precipitation is inhibited by either EDTA or by phosphorylcholine. Dogfish C-reactive protein has a molecular weight of approximately 250,000 with dimeric subunits of Mr = 50,000. Upon addition of beta-mercaptoethanol these dimeric subunits dissociate to two identical monomeric subunits of Mr = 25,000. The protein cross-reacts immunologically with goat antisera prepared against rabbit C-reactive protein. The dogfish serum amyloid P component has a molecular weight of at least 250,000 with monomeric subunits of Mr = 25,000. Cross-reactivity of the amyloid P component with the C-reactive protein could not be shown. However, NH2-terminal sequence analysis of the first 20 amino acids showed some homology. The relationship of dogfish C-reactive protein to the C-reactive proteins in Limulus polyphemus and in rabbits and humans is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1510471356,"The present study examined (a) the source of arachidonic acid for Ca2+-stimulated renal inner medullary prostaglandin synthesis, (b) the Ca2+-dependence of enzymes of the phospholipase A2 and C pathways, and (c) the role of calmodulin in these Ca2+ actions. Ca2+ plus the ionophore A23187 stimulated (2-4-fold) release of labeled arachidonate, diglyceride, prostaglandin E2 or F2 alpha from inner medullary slices with a concomitant fall in labeled phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylethanolamine. The calmodulin antagonist N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalene sulfonamide hydrochloride (W-7) (10-100 microM) abolished or suppressed Ca++-stimulated immunoreactive prostaglandin E, labeled arachidonate and prostaglandin release, and the fall in labeled phospholipids but did not suppress labeled diglyceride or inositol accumulation. Studies in subcellular fractions demonstrated a particulate phospholipase A2 activity and a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C activity which was predominantly soluble (80%). W-7 or trifluoperazine (25 microM) abolished Ca2+-stimulated phospholipase A2 activity and particulate phospholipase C activity but were without effect on soluble phospholipase C. W-7 (100 microM) was without effect on Ca2+-stimulated diglyceride lipase and phosphatidic acid-specific phospholipase A2 activities. Hypertonic urea at concentrations that pertain in the inner medulla of hydropenic rats in vivo inhibited Ca2+-induced increases in labeled arachidonate release and immunoreactive prostaglandin E in slice incubates and Ca2+-responsive phospholipase C and A2. The results are consistent with the involvement of phospholipase A2, C, or both in the Ca2+ (+A23187)-stimulated release of free arachidonate for prostaglandin synthesis and support a role for calmodulin in Ca2+ activation of phospholipase A2 and particulate phospholipase C."
https://openalex.org/W1486507211,"Glomeruli isolated from murine and human renal cortex metabolize arachidonic acid to prostaglandins via the cyclooxygenase pathway but whether such glomeruli can also metabolize arachidonic acid via the lipoxygenase pathway is controversial. [1-14C]Arachidonic acid was incubated with glomeruli or glomerular fractions isolated from rat and human renal cortex. The products were extracted, purified by high performance liquid chromatography, and identified by comparison of their retention times with those of authentic hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) standards and by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. At low substrate concentrations, human glomeruli synthesized in equivalent amounts 12- and 15-HETE, whereas rat glomeruli synthesized only 12-HETE and in larger quantities than in man. At higher substrate concentrations, both species synthesized 12- and 15-HETE and the rate of synthesis for both products was higher in human glomeruli. No other HETE was detected in either species. The lipoxygenase products were stored within the glomeruli and recovered almost equally in the 10,000 x g pellet and in the 100,000 X g supernatant of the homogenized glomeruli. The properties of the lipoxygenase system were the following: the enzyme was distributed equally in the membranes and the cytosol; 12-HETE accumulation was linear with time over 15 min; and 12-HETE production correlated linearly with the amount of glomerular protein. 12-Lipoxygenase activity was maximum at pH 7.5 (rat) or 9.0 (human) and at 40-42 degrees C (both species). Km values calculated at low concentrations of substrate (10-200 microM) were for 15-HETE, 125 and 667 microM with murine and human glomeruli, respectively, and for 12-HETE, 44 microM with the glomeruli of both species. This study demonstrates lipoxygenase activity in murine and, for the first time, in human glomeruli. The products of such enzymatic activity, 12- and 15-HETE, may mediate the glomerular inflammatory response in various experimental or spontaneous glomerular diseases."

Acta 258, 40-55) for the purification of glycerol dehydrogenase, two enzymes have been purified from the skeletal muscle of male rabbits. From a consideration of their properties these enzymes have been named aldose reductase 1 and aldose reductase 2, respectively. Both enzymes are monomeric by the criteria of gel filtration and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate and both reductases are immunologically identical as shown by double immunodiffusion and rocket immunoelectrophoresis. Aldose reductases 1 and 2 have almost identical amino acid compositions, their NH2 termini are blocked and the COOH termini of both enzymes are apparently identical. The enzymes differ, however, in molecular weight with aldose reductase 2 having Mr = 41,500 and aldose reductase 1 Mr 40,200. Both enzymes have the broad substrate specificity typical of the aldehyde reductase family of enzymes; Km values of aldose reductase 1 for aldo sugars were similar to those reported for rabbit lens aldose reductase, and both aldose reductase 1 and 2 were inhibited by the commercial aldose reductase inhibitors Alrestatin and Sorbinil. Two aldose reductases, immunologically and electrophoretically identical to the muscle enzymes, were found in rabbit lens. Two aldose reductases were also detected in the skeletal muscle of male rats and pigs and in pig and bovine lens. The presence of relatively large amounts of aldose reductase in muscle identifies a new and rich source of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2130315555,"Severe constriction of the abdominal aorta and simultaneous injection of isoproterenol in rats induced depression in heart function and reductions in cardiac adenosine triphosphate and total adenine nucleotides. When ribose was continuously infused for 24 hours, biosynthesis of cardiac adenine nucleotides was stimulated to such an extent that the reductions in adenosine triphosphate and total adenine nucleotides were prevented and left ventricular hemodynamic parameters were normal. These results support the hypothesis that adenosine triphosphate is primarily responsible for depression in myocardial contractility and that ribose is cardioprotective through its pronounced effects on adenine nucleotide metabolism in heart muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1543284135,"During oogenesis, Xenopus oocytes synthesize and accumulate all types of RNA. In particular, they store poly(A+) RNA to such an extent that only about 5% is actually translated in the oocyte. Using a protein blotting and in vitro binding assay, we have identified proteins which are associated with poly(A+) RNA and perhaps other RNAs as well. Two groups of binding proteins were identified. The first group accumulates during oogenesis, generally is less than 50,000 molecular weight, and sediments in the 80 S and polysome regions of a gradient. These proteins most likely include ribosomal proteins. A second group of proteins is oocyte-specific, sediments less than 80 S as well 80 S and slightly heavier, generally has molecular weights greater than 50,000, and diminishes in amount as oogenesis progresses. In addition, these proteins are retained by oligo(dT)-cellulose when ribonucleoproteins are analyzed by chromatography and, when challenged with several different types of RNA in vitro, bind poly(A+) RNA preferentially. The possibility that some of these proteins might regulate the stability or translatability of mRNAs during oogenesis is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2024295685,"When wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate is bound to hemocytes from larvae of Drosophila melanogaster, two populations of hemocytes are distinguished. One shows a fluorescent speckled surface (spk+) and the other lacks this characteristic (spk-). In mutant larvae with melanotic tumors and in larval hosts with heterospecific implants, most of the lamellocytes (a hemocyte variant involved in capsule formation and tissue rejection) are spk+, whereas the lamellocytes in nontumorous larvae are spk-. This suggests that spk+ lamellocytes are necessary for encapsulation of aberrant tissues in the mutant larvae and are responsible for rejection of foreign tissue implants."

https://openalex.org/W78700015,"A specific antibody was prepared against rat liver heme oxygenase which had been induced by bromobenzene treatment. Immunochemical studies with this antibody (IgG) revealed that heme oxygenases from livers of rats treated with hemin, Cd2+, Co2+, or bromobenzene from rat spleen and also from kidney of Sn2+-treated rats were all immunochemically identical. Cell-free synthesis of heme oxygenase was performed in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system using polysomes isolated from livers of rats treated with either hemin, Cd2+, or bromobenzene, and it was found that translatable mRNA specific for heme oxygenase was actually increased in the liver of rats treated with any of those inducers. Also, the ability of liver polysomes to direct cell-free synthesis of heme oxygenase was apparently proportional to the activity of heme oxygenase in the liver from which polysomes were prepared. The heme oxygenase protein synthesized either in vivo or in vitro showed a molecular weight of 31,000 when examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis and fluorography. This value is essentially identical with the molecular weight of heme oxygenase purified from rat liver and indicates that a precursor form of heme oxygenase may not be involved in the heme oxygenase synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1540260842,"Previous studies indicated that accumulation of alpha-fucosyl-GM1 (IV2FucII3NeuAcGgOse4Cer) and alpha-galactosyl-alpha-fucosyl-GM1 (IV3GalIV2FucII3NeuAcGgOse4Cer) occurs in precancerous livers of rats fed the chemical carcinogen N-2-acetylaminofluorene, before development of hepatoma. Both fucogangliosides were completely absent in normal rat liver as well as in livers of rats fed a nonhepatic carcinogen and tumor promoters (Holmes, E.H., and Hakomori, S. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 7698-7703). The enzymatic basis of the chemical changes described above is reported in this paper. The alpha-L-fucosyltransferase activity toward GM1 (II2NeuAcGgOse4Cer) as well as asialo-GM1 (GgOse4Cer) was almost undetectable in extracts from normal rat liver, but significant activity of this enzyme was detected in extracts of rat livers after 4 weeks of feeding a diet containing N-2-acetylaminofluorene. The same enzyme activity in cultured rat hepatoma cells was 18- to 47-fold higher than in N-2-acetylaminofluorene-fed rat liver. In contrast, alpha-galactosyltransferase activity with a broad substrate specificity was detected in normal as well as in N-2-acetylaminofluorene-fed liver, although the specific activity of this enzyme in Golgi membranes in precancerous liver was significantly higher than that of normal rat liver. Thus, the appearance of alpha-fucosyl-alpha-galactosyl-GMI in precancerous liver is due to an induction of synthesis of alpha-fucosyl-GMI which is the substrate for the normally existing alpha-galactosyltransferase. The activity of alpha-fucosyltransferase was highly specific toward a substrate structure Gal beta 1 leads to 3GalNAc beta 1 leads to R in GMI or asialo-GMI and showed an anomalous inhibition by a large variety of detergents tested. In contrast, the alpha-galactosyltransferase showed a wide substrate specificity, activated by detergents and Mn2+ ion. Membrane alterations in precancerous and malignant transformation of rat liver is associated with an induction of an unusual alpha-fucosyltransferase which is the key step in synthesis of both fucogangliosides."

https://openalex.org/W1640113725,"The murine tumor line 70Z/3 resembles a pre-B lymphocyte in containing the heavy chain of IgM (mu) as a cytoplasmic protein in the apparent absence of light chain (L). However, these cells can be induced by lipopolysaccharide to differentiate into a B lymphocyte-like state, containing mu2L2 tetramers as membrane-bound molecules. This is a accompanied by an increase in mu synthesis, the acquisition of complex carbohydrate by mu, and the induction of L chain. We wished to determine which of these events is critical for membrane deposition of mu. We found that uninduced 70Z/3 cells, as well as lipopolysaccharide-uninducible variants, contained a low, constitutive level of membrane bound mu, all of which was found as mu2L2. Dextran sulfate, another inducing agent, apparently caused a redistribution of this pre-existing surface mu without altering the pattern of mu synthesis or processing. One lipopolysaccharide-uninducible variant showed a small subset of surface mu-positive cells, and the proportion of these cells increased with a prolonged induction period. The increase in mu synthesis was nearly normal, but mu did not acquire complex carbohydrate. However, the delayed appearance of surface mu-positive cells was paralleled by a delayed increase in L chain, which occurred only in those cells with mu on their membrane. We concluded that L chain signals the transport of mu to the cell surface."

https://openalex.org/W1483395506,"Within minutes of glucose starvation confluent monolayers of rat hepatoma cells synthesize glycoproteins, including alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, which appear on two-dimensional gels as size heterogeneous spot series. The longer the period of glucose starvation the more the production of the glycoproteins is shifted toward smaller molecular weight forms. To compare these forms with the corresponding glycoproteins synthesized either in a cell-free system or by nonstarved cells, a mapping of the N-glycan was done by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase digestion within a polyacrylamide gel. Glycoproteins from glucose-starved cells contain a reduced number of N-glycans which belong to both the endo H-sensitive and resistant type. The decrease of N-glycosylation may be correlated with the accumulation of truncated lipid-bound oligosaccharides, for the gel chromatography of the oligosaccharides released from the lipid and protein fractions of glucose-starved cells revealed a drastic reduction in their size. Most of the lipid-linked oligosaccharides synthesized during glucose starvation are resistant to endo H digestion. Under conditions of limiting glycosylation we were able to show by glycopeptide analysis, that in the case of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, N-glycans are added randomly to the 6 possible N-glycosylation sites. Furthermore, non- or partially N-glycosylated proteins do not acquire additional oligosaccharide units after restoration of glucose although the proteins can undergo secondary modification and, in the case of the secretory proteins, can be exported."
https://openalex.org/W1510257968,"The product of the cloned recA+ gene of Proteus mirabilis substitutes for a defective recA protein in Escherichia coli recA- mutants and restores recombination, repair, and prophage induction functions to near normal levels (Eitner, G., Adler, B., Lanzov, V. A., and Hofemeister, J. (1982) Mol. Gen. Genet. 185, 481-486). In this paper, we report the purification to near homogeneity of the P. mirabilis recA protein (recApm). The polypeptide has a molecular weight similar to that of E. coli recA protein (recAec) and shows partial identity with recAec when reacted against antibodies specific for the E. coli recA protein. recApm catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP in the presence of single-stranded but not double-stranded DNA. We have compared the recombination-like activities of recApm with those of recAec and found them to be similar. In the presence of ATP and Mg2+, stoichiometric amounts of recApm promote the complete reciprocal exchange of strands between gapped circular and linear duplex DNA molecules. The enzyme also efficiently promotes the formation of D-loops from circular duplex DNA and homologous single-stranded fragments. However, although recApm and recAec share the above physical and functional similarities, they differ in their ability to interact with the E. coli single strand binding protein to catalyze the transfer of one DNA strand from a linear duplex to a single-stranded circle."
https://openalex.org/W1589877569,"The biochemical defect in a class of Salmonella typhimurium mutants (rfaB) defective in biosynthesis of the lipopolysaccharide core is described. Structural, immunochemical and enzymologic studies showed that: (i) the core polysaccharide completely lacked the branch alpha 1,6-D-galactosyl residue of the normal lipopolysaccharide as shown by methylation analysis and 1H nmr spectroscopy; (ii) the mutant lipopolysaccharides acted as acceptors for transfer of D-galactose from UDP-D-galactose into alpha 1,6 linkage to the proximal D-glucosyl residue of the core in a reaction catalyzed by an enzyme activity present in extracts from rfaB+ cells; (iii) the UDP-D-galactose:(glucosyl)lipopolysaccharide alpha 1,6-D-galactosyltransferase activity was absent from extracts of rfaB cells."
https://openalex.org/W1577288237,"Multimethyl-branched acids extracted from the cells of Mycobacterium tuberculosis var. bovis BCG were identified by combined capillary gas-liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. These mycocerosic acids consisted of the products expected from elongation of n-C18 and n-C20 primers with methylmalonyl-CoA. A soluble enzyme preparation from M. tuberculosis var. bovis BCG incorporated methylmalonyl-CoA into mycocerosic acids. This incorporation was partially dependent on the addition of arachidoyl-CoA and this primer affected product distribution, indicating elongation of the primer. Maximal incorporation of methylmalonyl-CoA required the presence of both NADPH and NADH together with ATP and Mg2+. Added CoA, FMN, acyl carrier protein, or bovine serum albumin had no effect on the activity in either the presence or absence of ATP and Mg2+. The pH optimum for mycocerosic acid synthesis was 6.2. Under these conditions, methylmalonyl-CoA was incorporated into very long acids which were identified as mycocerosic acids by radio gas-liquid chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W2010221809,The carcinogen aflatoxin B1 was reacted with a polymer of alternating deoxyguanine and deoxycytosine residues to determine the effect that adduct formation has on the conversion of this polymer from the right-handed B-DNA form found at low salt concentrations to the left-handed Z-DNA form found at high salt concentrations. Reaction with aflatoxin strongly inhibited the salt-induced conversion of this polymer from B-DNA to Z-DNA. This inhibition could be detected even at relatively low binding levels.
https://openalex.org/W1578650753,"Nitrite reductase (cytochrome c,d1) was purified from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In the presence of the reducing system, ascorbate-N,N,N',N'-tetramethylphenyl-enediamine, which alone had no ability to reduce nitrite or NO at pH 7.5, the enzyme catalyzed the reduction of nitrite to NO and N2O as major and minor products, respectively, as determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The rate of reduction of NO to N2O was considerably lower than the rate of reduction of nitrite to N2O and might be zero. The N2O produced in a system containing [15N]nitrite and natural NO was more highly enriched in 15N than was the NO pool and, in this regard, closely resembled the enrichment of the nitrite pool. The amount of 14N in the NO pool changed little, if any, as the result of enzymatic processes. For the enzyme, free NO seems not to be an intermediate between nitrite and N2O, just as was found by this laboratory for certain intact denitrifying bacteria. The results are consistent with reduction of nitrite to enzyme-bound NO, which can partition between release and further reduction."
https://openalex.org/W1995312493,"Rejection of mouse pancreatic islet allografts occurred in a high percentage of donor recipient combinations identical for H-21-region antigens and differing at H-2K and H-2K + H-2D without I-region disparities. The results suggest that disparities in major histocompatibility complex antigens of class I (H-2K and H-2D) alone are capable of eliciting islet allograft rejection, and that lack of a stimulus from class II (I-region) alloantigens does not ensure permanent islet allograft survival."
https://openalex.org/W61388669,"Two forms of UDPglucuronyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.17) have been purified from microsomes of pig liver. One form is free of phospholipids and the other contains a small amount of residual phospholipids. Each form, however, is responsive to activation on addition of purified phospholipids. Comparison of kinetic properties of these enzymes, after reconstitution with identical phospholipid environments, indicate that these are unique functional forms of UDPglucuronyltransferase. The two differ by as much as 100-fold in their rates of conjugation at Vm of p-nitrophenol. Relative rates of glucuronidation of a variety of phenolic aglycones are different for the two enzymes, which suggests different reaction mechanisms. The energetic basis for binding of UDP-glucuronic acid to the active sites is different for the two forms of UDPglucuronyltransferase. Moreover, one form, but not the other, binds Mn2+, which leads to modulation of kinetic properties."
https://openalex.org/W1589184688,"Of 39 monoclonal antibodies that bind the cell surface of aggregating Dictyostelium discoideum, 4 block 76-98% of cell-cell adhesion measured in an in vitro assay. The active antibodies all bind in the range of 10(6) antigenic sites/cell surface and react with more than one material on nitrocellulose blots prepared after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of whole aggregating cells in sodium dodecyl sulfate. Active antibodies can by grouped into two classes, each with two very similar members. Class I binds several molecules that are prominent in aggregating cells but scarce or undetectable in vegetative cells, blocks cell adhesion only in the presence of EDTA, and has no detectable effect on cell morphology. Class II binds a wide range of molecules present in both vegetative and aggregating cells, inhibits adhesion as well in the absence as in the presence of EDTA, and reversibly alters cell shape."
https://openalex.org/W1912751218,"The stereoselectivity of the oxidation of 7,8-dihydrobenzo[a]pyrene (H2BP) to 9,10-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene (H4BP-epoxide) by prostaglandin H (PGH) synthase and cytochrome P-450 has been studied using microsomal preparations from ram seminal vesicles and rat liver. Incubations were performed in the presence of polyguanylic acid and the adducts formed between H4BP-epoxide and guanosine were isolated following the recovery and hydrolysis of the poly(G). When (+/-)-H4BP-epoxide was reacted with poly(G), four diastereomeric adducts were formed by the cis and trans addition of the exocyclic amino group of guanine to the benzylic carbon of the epoxide enantiomers. Each diastereomer was identified by a combination of ultraviolet, nuclear magnetic resonance, circular dichroism, and mass spectroscopy. Under comparable conditions, ram seminal vesicle microsomes in the presence of arachidonic acid triggered the binding of H2BP to poly(G) to a greater extent than rat liver microsomes from untreated and phenobarbital- and methylcholanthrene pretreated animals in the presence of NADPH. Quantitation of the (-)-cis- and (+)-cis-guanosine adducts revealed the degree of stereoselectivity of epoxidation. The ratio of (-)/(+) adducts was 54:46 for PGH synthase and 89:11 (control), 62:38 (phenobarbital), and 69:31 (methylcholanthrene) for cytochrome P-450-catalyzed reactions. PGH synthase catalyzed the epoxidation of H2BP with little or no stereoselectivity in contrast to cytochrome P-450. The utility of the poly(G) binding technique for the elucidation of the stereoselective generation of chiral electrophiles is discussed along with the mechanistic implications of the results."
https://openalex.org/W2273970750,"The role of copper in pig kidney diamine oxidase has been probed by examining the effects of potential Cu(II) ligands on the spectroscopic and catalytic properties of the enzyme. In the presence of azide and thiocyanate, new absorption bands are evident at 410 nm (epsilon = 6300 M-1 cm-1) and 365 nm (epsilon = 3000 M-1 cm-1), respectively. These bands are assigned as ligand-to-metal charge-transfer transitions, N3-/SCN- leads to Cu(II). One anion/Cu(II) is coordinated in an equitorial position. Anion binding can be completely reversed by dialysis. The equilibrium constants for diamine oxidase-anion complex formation are 134 M-1 (N3-) and 55 M-1 (SCN-). Azide and thiocyanate are linear uncompetitive inhibitors with respect to the amine substrate when O2 is present at saturating concentrations. Taken together, the data are consistent with a functional role for Cu(II) in diamine oxidase catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W33968160,"Acetyl coenzyme A has been shown to be required for heparan sulfate degradation for the acetylation of terminal alpha-linked glucosamine residues (Klein, U., Kresse, H., and von Figura, K. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 75, 5185-5189). We can now demonstrate this requirement in intact isolated lysosomes. When lysosomes deficient in the enzyme alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase were incubated at 37 degrees C with [3H]acetyl-CoA, tritium was incorporated primarily into glycosaminoglycans. By utilizing hydrolytic enzymes of known specificity, the labeled glycosaminoglycan was identified as heparan sulfate and the radioactivity was shown to be located in acetyl moieties of terminal alpha-N-acetylglucosamine residues. The acetylation of heparan sulfate in alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase-deficient lysosomes could be stimulated by the addition of 0.5 mM ATP. Lysosomes from normal cells produced some labeled heparan sulfate; however, these organelles showed a significant incorporation of [3H]acetate into free N-acetylglucosamine that was increased over 10-fold by the addition of ATP. The N-acetylation was catalyzed by the enzyme acetyl-CoA:alpha-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase since lysosomes deficient in this enzyme were unable to incorporate [3H]acetate into either heparan sulfate or N-acetylglucosamine even in the presence of ATP. Incorporation of [3H]acetate from [3H]acetyl-CoA into heparan sulfate (by alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase-deficient lysosomes) and into N-acetylglucosamine (by normal lysosomes) showed a similar concentration dependence. The concentration for half-maximal incorporation of [3H]acetate was approximately 1 microM for both."
https://openalex.org/W1489772788,"Glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase, the first enzyme of purine nucleotide biosynthesis, is inactivated and degraded in Bacillus subtilis during carbon, nitrogen, or amino acid starvation. Amidotransferase is stable in exponentially growing cells, and synthesis of the enzyme ceases prior to its inactivation at the end of exponential growth. Inactivation has been previously shown to result from reaction of an essential [4Fe-4S] center with oxygen. In this work, monospecific antibodies against amidotransferase have been used to demonstrate that inactivation is followed by proteolytic degradation in vivo and that the metabolic requirements for degradation differ from those for inactivation. Unlike inactivation, degradation is inhibited by addition of 10 mM KCN or antibiotic inhibitors of RNA and protein synthesis to glucose-starved cells. The cross-reactive material that accumulates when degradation is inhibited by chloramphenicol initially has native subunit molecular weight, but lower molecular weight polypeptides slowly accumulate. Degradation, but not inactivation, of amidotransferase is strongly inhibited during amino acid starvation of a relA strain. Degradation of amidotransferase is inhibited by pseudomonic acid, an antibiotic that blocks protein synthesis but permits a normal stringent response. This result indicates that both protein synthesis and normal relA gene function are required for degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1510322783,"The formation of the bovine beta-trypsin-bovine basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (Kunitz) (BPTI) complex was monitored, making use of three different signals: proflavine displacement, optical density changes in the ultraviolet region, and the loss of the catalytic activity. The rates of the reactions indicated by the three different signals were similar at neutral pH, but diverged at low pH. At pH 3.50, proflavine displacement precedes the optical density changes in the ultraviolet and the loss of enzyme activity by several orders of magnitude in time (Antonini, E., Ascenzi, P., Menegatti, E., and Guarneri, M. (1983) Biopolymers 22, 363-375). These data indicated that the bovine beta-trypsin-BPTI complex formation is a multistage process and led to the prediction that, at pH 3.50, BPTI addition to the bovine beta-trypsin-proflavine complex would remove proflavine inhibition and the enzyme would recover transiently its catalytic activity before being irreversibly inhibited by completion of BPTI binding. The kinetic evidences, by completion of BPTI binding. The kinetic evidences, here shown, verified this prediction, indicating that during the bovine beta-trypsin-BPTI complex formation one transient intermediate occurs, which is not able to bind proflavine but may bind and hydrolyze the substrate. Thus, the observed peculiar catalytic behavior is in line with the proposed reaction mechanism for the bovine beta-trypsin-BPTI complex formation, which postulates a sequence of distinct polar and apolar interactions at the contact area."
https://openalex.org/W1492931581,"Human lung cancer transplanted into athymic mice contains predominantly an acidic variant (designated B1) of lysosomal arylsulfatase B. B1 enzyme was suggested to be phosphorylated and sialylated (Gasa, S., Makita, A., Kameya, T., Kodama, T., Koide, T., Tsumuraya, M., and Komai, T. (1981) Eur. J. Biochem. 116, 497-503). In order to determine the localization of phosphate in B1 enzyme, we labeled in vivo the transplanted tumor with [32P]H3PO4 or [3H]glucosamine and purified B1 enzyme by immunoprecipitation. Bio-Gel chromatography of the labeled B1 enzyme treated with endoglycosidase H demonstrated that both the excluded and included materials were labeled with 32P and 3H. From acid hydrolysate of the excluded materials, phosphorylated serine and threonine were detected. Protein phosphorylation of arylsulfatase was confirmed by in vitro labeling experiments with [gamma-32P]ATP. By incubation of the tumor homogenate with ATP followed by isolation of the enzymes, B1 enzyme had a significant amount of radioactivity, whereas the B enzyme had little; by exogenous protein kinase, partially purified B enzyme was phosphorylated 35 times more than B1 enzyme. Acid hydrolysate of the included materials in the Bio-Gel column demonstrated mannose 6-phosphate and an unknown phosphorylated compound which migrates more than Man-6-P on electrophoresis and chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W1511143675,"2-Thio-FAD (oxygen substituent at position 2 is replaced by sulfur) was used to reconstitute the apoenzyme of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase. The 2-thio-FAD enzyme differs from native enzyme in several respects. While the native enzyme catalyzes the fully coupled hydroxylation of p-hydroxybenzoate, the 2-thio-FAD enzyme shows no hydroxylation of this substrate, instead reducing molecular oxygen to hydrogen peroxide. The rate of reduction of 2-thio-FAD p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase by NADPH in the presence of substrate was 7-fold faster than with the native enzyme. However, the oxygen reactivity of the reduced 2-thio-FAD enzyme was less than 1% that of native enzyme. This slow oxygen reaction results in the very high KmO2 observed in steady state kinetic studies of the modified enzyme. Stopped flow studies of the oxygen reaction of the reduced 2-thio-FAD enzyme in the presence of substrate confirmed the formation of a transient intermediate. The spectrum of this intermediate is very similar to those of the flavin-C(4a) adducts obtained with 2-thio-FMN lactate oxidase. This evidence suggests that reduced 2-thio-FAD p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase forms a flavin-C(4a)-hydroperoxide on reaction with oxygen in a reaction analogous to that with native enzyme, but that the resulting peroxyflavin is incompetent as an oxygenating species, breaking down instead to oxidized 2-thio-FAD enzyme and hydrogen peroxide."
