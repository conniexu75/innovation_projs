https://openalex.org/W1848034425,"The naturally occurring compound spinosyn A is a component of several environmentally benign commercial insecticides. How its tetracyclic ring system is biosynthesized has been a subject of much speculation. One possible mechanism is the Diels–Alder reaction, a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction in which a cyclohexene ring is formed between a conjugated diene and an electron-deficient alkene via a single pericyclic transition state. This reaction is a rarity in nature, but a structural and kinetic study of the enzyme SpnF from the soil bacterium Saccharopolyspora spinosa now identifies it as perhaps the first stand-alone enzyme to merit the name 'Diels–Alderase', solely committed to the catalysis of a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction with an estimated 500-fold rate enhancement. The Diels–Alder reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction in which a cyclohexene ring is formed between a 1,3-diene and an electron-deficient alkene via a single pericyclic transition state1. This reaction has been proposed as a key transformation in the biosynthesis of many cyclohexene-containing secondary metabolites2,3,4,5. However, only four purified enzymes have thus far been implicated in biotransformations that are consistent with a Diels–Alder reaction, namely solanapyrone synthase6, LovB7,8, macrophomate synthase9,10, and riboflavin synthase11,12. Although the stereochemical outcomes of these reactions indicate that the product formation could be enzyme-guided in each case, these enzymes typically demonstrate more than one catalytic activity, leaving their specific influence on the cycloaddition step uncertain. In our studies of the biosynthesis of spinosyn A, a tetracyclic polyketide-derived insecticide from Saccharopolyspora spinosa13,14, we identified a cyclase, SpnF, that catalyses a transannular [4+2] cycloaddition to form the cyclohexene ring in spinosyn A. Kinetic analysis demonstrates that SpnF specifically accelerates the ring formation reaction with an estimated 500-fold rate enhancement. A second enzyme, SpnL, was also identified as responsible for the final cross-bridging step that completes the tetracyclic core of spinosyn A in a manner consistent with a Rauhut–Currier reaction15. This work is significant because SpnF represents the first example characterized in vitro of a stand-alone enzyme solely committed to the catalysis of a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction. In addition, the mode of formation of the complex perhydro-as-indacene moiety in spinosyn A is now fully established."
https://openalex.org/W2096667580,"miR-124-1 is a tumour suppressor microRNA (miR). Epigenetic deregulation of miRs is implicated in carcinogenesis. Promoter DNA methylation and histone modification of miR-124-1 was studied in 5 normal marrow controls, 4 lymphoma, 8 multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines, 230 diagnostic primary samples of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), MM, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and 53 MM samples at stable disease or relapse. Promoter of miR-124-1 was unmethylated in normal controls but homozygously methylated in 4 of 4 lymphoma and 4 of 8 myeloma cell lines. Treatment of 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine led to miR-124-1 demethylation and re-expression of mature miR-124, which also associated with emergence of euchromatic trimethyl H3K4 and consequent downregulation of CDK6 in myeloma cells harboring homozygous miR-124-1 methylation. In primary samples at diagnosis, miR-124-1 methylation was absent in CML but detected in 2% each of MM at diagnosis and relapse/progression, 5% ALL, 15% AML, 14% CLL and 58.1% of NHL (p<0.001). Amongst lymphoid malignancies, miR-124-1 was preferentially methylated in NHL than MM, CLL or ALL. In primary lymphoma samples, miR-124-1 was preferentially hypermethylated in B- or NK/T-cell lymphomas and associated with reduced miR-124 expression. In conclusion, miR-124-1 was hypermethylated in a tumour-specific manner, with a heterochromatic histone configuration. Hypomethylation led to partial restoration of euchromatic histone code and miR re-expression. Infrequent miR-124-1 methylation detected in diagnostic and relapse MM samples showed an unimportant role in MM pathogenesis, despite frequent methylation found in cell lines. Amongst haematological cancers, miR-124-1 was more frequently hypermethylated in NHL, and hence warrants further study."
https://openalex.org/W2007189485,"Cadmium (Cd), a toxic environmental contaminant, induces oxidative stress, leading to neurodegenerative disorders. Recently we have demonstrated that Cd induces neuronal apoptosis in part by activation of the mitogen-activated protein kineses (MAPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here we show that Cd elevated intracellular calcium ion ([Ca2+]i) level in PC12, SH-SY5Y cells and primary murine neurons. BAPTA/AM, an intracellular Ca2+ chelator, abolished Cd-induced [Ca2+]i elevation, and blocked Cd activation of MAKPs including extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38, and mTOR-mediated signaling pathways, as well as cell death. Pretreatment with the extracellular Ca2+ chelator EGTA also prevented Cd-induced [Ca2+]i elevation, MAPK/mTOR activation, as well as cell death, suggesting that Cd-induced extracellular Ca2+ influx plays a critical role in contributing to neuronal apoptosis. In addition, calmodulin (CaM) antagonist trifluoperazine (TFP) or silencing CaM attenuated the effects of Cd on MAPK/mTOR activation and cell death. Furthermore, Cd-induced [Ca2+]i elevation or CaM activation resulted in induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Pretreatment with BAPTA/AM, EGTA or TFP attenuated Cd-induced ROS and cleavage of caspase-3 in the neuronal cells. Our findings indicate that Cd elevates [Ca2+]i, which induces ROS and activates MAPK and mTOR pathways, leading to neuronal apoptosis. The results suggest that regulation of Cd-disrupted [Ca2+]i homeostasis may be a new strategy for prevention of Cd-induced neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2137807361,"We report on the implementation of a quantum analog to the classical lock-in amplifier. All the lock-in operations: modulation, detection and mixing, are performed via the application of non-commuting quantum operators on the electronic spin state of a single trapped Sr+ ion. We significantly increase its sensitivity to external fields while extending phase coherence by three orders of magnitude, to more than one second. With this technique we measure magnetic fields with sensitivity of 25 pT/sqrt(Hz) and light shifts with an uncertainty below 140 mHz after 1320 seconds of averaging. These sensitivities are limited by quantum projection noise and, to our knowledge, are more than two orders of magnitude better than with other single-spin probe technologies. In fact, our reported sensitivity is sufficient for the measurement of parity non-conservation, as well as the detection of the magnetic field of a single electronic-spin one micrometer from an ion-detector with nanometer resolution. As a first application we perform light shift spectroscopy of a narrow optical quadruple transition. Finally, we emphasize that the quantum lock-in technique is generic and can potentially enhance the sensitivity of any quantum sensor."
https://openalex.org/W2017917533,"Comparing bacterial 16S rDNA sequences to GenBank and other large public databases via BLAST often provides results of little use for identification and taxonomic assignment of the organisms of interest. The human microbiome, and in particular the oral microbiome, includes many taxa, and accurate identification of sequence data is essential for studies of these communities. For this purpose, a phylogenetically curated 16S rDNA database of the core oral microbiome, CORE, was developed. The goal was to include a comprehensive and minimally redundant representation of the bacteria that regularly reside in the human oral cavity with computationally robust classification at the level of species and genus. Clades of cultivated and uncultivated taxa were formed based on sequence analyses using multiple criteria, including maximum-likelihood-based topology and bootstrap support, genetic distance, and previous naming. A number of classification inconsistencies for previously named species, especially at the level of genus, were resolved. The performance of the CORE database for identifying clinical sequences was compared to that of three publicly available databases, GenBank nr/nt, RDP and HOMD, using a set of sequencing reads that had not been used in creation of the database. CORE offered improved performance compared to other public databases for identification of human oral bacterial 16S sequences by a number of criteria. In addition, the CORE database and phylogenetic tree provide a framework for measures of community divergence, and the focused size of the database offers advantages of efficiency for BLAST searching of large datasets. The CORE database is available as a searchable interface and for download at http://microbiome.osu.edu."
https://openalex.org/W2171909092,"Ghrelin is a hormone produced predominantly by the stomach that targets a number of specific areas in the central nervous system to promote a positive energy balance by increasing food intake and energy storage. In that respect, similarities exist with the effects of consuming a high-fat diet (HFD), which also increases caloric intake and the amount of stored calories. We determined whether the effects of ghrelin on feeding and adiposity are influenced by the exposure to an HFD. Chronic intracerebroventricular ghrelin (2.5 nmol/d) increased feeding in lean rats fed a low-fat control diet (CD) [192±5 g (ghrelin+CD) vs. 152±5 g (control i.c.v. saline+CD), P<0.001], but the combination of ghrelin plus HFD did not result in significantly greater hyperphagia [150±7 g (ghrelin+HFD) vs. 136±4 g (saline+HFD)]. Despite failing to increase food intake in rats fed the HFD, ghrelin nonetheless increased adiposity [fat mass increase of 14±2 g (ghrelin+HFD) vs. 1±1 g (saline+HFD), P<0.001] up-regulating the gene expression of lipogenic enzymes in white adipose tissue. Our findings demonstrate that factors associated with high-fat feeding functionally interact with pathways regulating the effect of ghrelin on food intake. We conclude that ghrelin's central effects on nutrient intake and nutrient partitioning can be separated and suggest an opportunity to identify respective independent neuronal pathways.— Perez-Tilve, D., Heppner, K., Kirchner, H., Lockie, S.

https://openalex.org/W2024817554,"The dihydroceramide desaturase (DES) enzyme is responsible for inserting the 4,5-trans-double bond to the sphingolipid backbone of dihydroceramide. We previously demonstrated that fenretinide (4-HPR) inhibited DES activity in SMS-KCNR neuroblastoma cells. In this study, we investigated whether 4-HPR acted directly on the enzyme in vitro. N-C8:0-d-erythro-dihydroceramide (C(8)-dhCer) was used as a substrate to study the conversion of dihydroceramide into ceramide in vitro using rat liver microsomes, and the formation of tritiated water after the addition of the tritiated substrate was detected and used to measure DES activity. NADH served as a cofactor. The apparent K(m) for C(8)-dhCer and NADH were 1.92 ± 0.36 μm and 43.4 ± 6.47 μm, respectively; and the V(max) was 3.16 ± 0.24 and 4.11 ± 0.18 nmol/min/g protein. Next, the effects of 4-HPR and its metabolites on DES activity were investigated. 4-HPR was found to inhibit DES in a dose-dependent manner. At 20 min, the inhibition was competitive; however, longer incubation times demonstrated the inhibition to be irreversible. Among the major metabolites of 4-HPR, 4-oxo-N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4-oxo-4-HPR) showed the highest inhibitory effect with substrate concentration of 0.5 μm, with an IC(50) of 1.68 μm as compared with an IC(50) of 2.32 μm for 4-HPR. N-(4-Methoxyphenyl)retinamide (4-MPR) and 4-Oxo-N-(4-methoxyphenyl)retinamide (4-oxo-4-MPR) had minimal effects on DES activity. A known competitive inhibitor of DES, C(8)-cyclopropenylceramide was used as a positive control. These studies define for the first time a direct in vitro target for 4-HPR and suggest that inhibitors of DES may be used as therapeutic interventions to regulate ceramide desaturation and consequent function."
https://openalex.org/W2079224336,"Current knowledge of plant virus diversity is biased towards agents of visible and economically important diseases. Less is known about viruses that have not caused major diseases in crops, or viruses from native vegetation, which are a reservoir of biodiversity that can contribute to viral emergence. Discovery of these plant viruses is hindered by the traditional approach of sampling individual symptomatic plants. Since many damaging plant viruses are transmitted by insect vectors, we have developed ""vector-enabled metagenomics"" (VEM) to investigate the diversity of plant viruses. VEM involves sampling of insect vectors (in this case, whiteflies) from plants, followed by purification of viral particles and metagenomic sequencing. The VEM approach exploits the natural ability of highly mobile adult whiteflies to integrate viruses from many plants over time and space, and leverages the capability of metagenomics for discovering novel viruses. This study utilized VEM to describe the DNA viral community from whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci) collected from two important agricultural regions in Florida, USA. VEM successfully characterized the active and abundant viruses that produce disease symptoms in crops, as well as the less abundant viruses infecting adjacent native vegetation. PCR assays designed from the metagenomic sequences enabled the complete sequencing of four novel begomovirus genome components, as well as the first discovery of plant virus satellites in North America. One of the novel begomoviruses was subsequently identified in symptomatic Chenopodium ambrosiodes from the same field site, validating VEM as an effective method for proactive monitoring of plant viruses without a priori knowledge of the pathogens. This study demonstrates the power of VEM for describing the circulating viral community in a given region, which will enhance our understanding of plant viral diversity, and facilitate emerging plant virus surveillance and management of viral diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2048668585,"Autophagy is one of the downstream effector mechanisms for elimination of intracellular microbes following activation of the Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Although the detailed molecular mechanism for this cellular process is still unclear, Beclin 1, a key molecule for autophagy, has been suggested to play a role. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone that regulates the stability of signaling proteins. Herein, we show that Hsp90 forms a complex with Beclin 1 through an evolutionarily conserved domain to maintain the stability of Beclin 1. In monocytic cells, geldanamycin (GA), an Hsp90 inhibitor, effectively promoted proteasomal degradation of Beclin 1 in a concentration-dependent (EC(50) 100 nM) and time-dependent (t(50) 2 h) manner. In contrast, KNK437/Hsp inhibitor I had no effect. Hsp90 specifically interacted with Beclin 1 but not with other adapter proteins in the TLR signalsome. Treatment of cells with GA inhibited TLR3- and TLR4-mediated autophagy. In addition, S. typhimurium infection-induced autophagy was blocked by GA treatment. This further suggested a role of the Hsp90/Beclin 1 in controlling autophagy in response to microbial infections. Taken together, our data revealed that by maintaining the homeostasis of Beclin 1, Hsp90 plays a novel role in TLR-mediated autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2050313263,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs with regulatory roles, which are involved in a broad spectrum of physiological and pathological processes, including cancer. A common strategy for identification of miRNAs involved in cell transformation is to compare malignant cells to normal cells. Here we focus on identification of miRNAs that regulate the aggressive phenotype of melanoma cells. To avoid differences due to genetic background, a comparative high-throughput miRNA profiling was performed on two isogenic human melanoma cell lines that display major differences in their net proliferation, invasion and tube formation activities. This screening revealed two major cohorts of differentially expressed miRNAs. We speculated that miRNAs up-regulated in the more-aggressive cell line contribute oncogenic features, while the down-regulated miRNAs are tumor suppressive. This assumption was further tested experimentally on five candidate tumor suppressive miRNAs (miR-31, -34a, -184, -185 and -204) and on one candidate oncogenic miRNA (miR-17-5p), all of which have never been reported before in cutaneous melanoma. Remarkably, all candidate Suppressive-miRNAs inhibited net proliferation, invasion or tube formation, while miR-17-5p enhanced cell proliferation. miR-34a and miR-185 were further shown to inhibit the growth of melanoma xenografts when implanted in SCID-NOD mice. Finally, all six candidate miRNAs were detected in 15 different metastatic melanoma specimens, attesting for the physiological relevance of our findings. Collectively, these findings may prove instrumental for understanding mechanisms of disease and for development of novel therapeutic and staging technologies for melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2052620064,"Clumping factor B (ClfB) from Staphylococcus aureus is a bifunctional protein that binds to human cytokeratin 10 (K10) and fibrinogen (Fg). ClfB has been implicated in S. aureus colonization of nasal epithelium and is therefore a key virulence factor. People colonized with S. aureus are at an increased risk for invasive staphylococcal disease. In this study, we have determined the crystal structures of the ligand-binding region of ClfB in an apo-form and in complex with human K10 and Fg α-chain-derived peptides, respectively. We have determined the structures of MSCRAMM binding to two ligands with different sequences in the same site showing the versatile nature of the ligand recognition mode of microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules. Both ligands bind ClfB by parallel β-sheet complementation as observed for the clumping factor A·γ-chain peptide complex. The β-sheet complementation is shorter in the ClfB·Fg α-chain peptide complex. The structures show that several residues in ClfB are important for binding to both ligands, whereas others only make contact with one of the ligands.

The Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus is in a commensal relationship with humans and is an important opportunistic pathogen that causes infections in both hospital and community settings (1Diekema D.J.

Approximately 20% of the human population persistently carry S. aureus in the moist squamous epithelium of their anterior nares, and the remainder of the population can carry the organism intermittently (4Kluytmans J. van Belkum A.

The N terminus of the mature surface-exposed protein includes the ligand-binding A region that is composed of the three subdomains N1, N2, and N3.

Crystal structures of the apo-form of SdrG and of a complex of the interacting Fg β-chain peptide bound to SdrG revealed the so-called “dock, lock, latch” mechanism of binding (16Ponnuraj K. Bowden M.G. Davis S. Gurusiddappa S. Moore D. Choe D. Xu Y. Hook M. Narayana S.V. Cell. 2003; 115: 217-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). A schematic describing the dock, lock, latch mechanism is shown in supplemental Fig. S1. The Fg β-chain peptide docks into a ligand-binding trench located between subdomains N2 and N3 through an anti-parallel β-strand complementation of the G-strand of N3. Subsequently, the peptide is covered and locked in place by redirection of the C-terminal extension of N3. The C terminus of the lock segment of the N3 extension forms a latch by β-strand complementation with a β-strand exposed in a trench within subdomain N2. A closed structure of the apo-form of the SdrG N2N3 segment, containing an engineered di-sulfide bond to covalently keep the latch in place, failed to bind the ligand peptide (29Bowden M.G. Heuck A.P. Ponnuraj K. Kolosova E. Choe D. Gurusiddappa S. Narayana S.V. Johnson A.E. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 638-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, the ligand can only bind to an open form of the apoprotein where the latching sequence is free. More recent analysis (30Ganesh V.K. Rivera J.J. Smeds E. Ko Y.P. Bowden M.G. Wann E.R. Gurusiddappa S. Fitzgerald J.R. Höök M. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000226Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) showed that ClfA binds the Fg γ-chain peptide by a variation of the dock, lock, latch mechanism whereby the ligand peptide forms a parallel β-strand with the G-strand of the N3 module of the MSCRAMM and slides into the binding trench of a stabilized locked form. The A domain of ClfB binds to two seemingly disparate ligands, K10 and Fg (21Ní Eidhin D. Perkins S. Francois P. Vaudaux P. Höök M. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 31Walsh E.J. Miajlovic H. Gorkun O.V. Foster T.J. Microbiology. 2008; 154: 550-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The binding site within K10 was mapped to the C-terminal Tyr-(Gly-Ser)n Ω loop region (22Walsh E.J. O'Brien L.M. Liang X. Hook M. Foster T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50691-50699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). One Ω loop YGGGSSGGGSSGGGH segment was studied in detail. The binding site for ClfB in the α-chain of Fg was mapped to repeat 5 of the flexible region of the αC domain (GSWNSGSSGTGSTGNQ), a segment that might form a loop similar to those in the K10 tail region (31Walsh E.J. Miajlovic H. Gorkun O.V. Foster T.J. Microbiology. 2008; 154: 550-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the structural basis for the interaction of ClfB with synthetic peptides corresponding to the identified binding sites in Fg α-chain and K10, respectively. We show that the N2N3 segment of ClfB folds into two subdomains containing DEv-IgG folds (32Deivanayagam C.C. Wann E.R. Chen W. Carson M. Rajashankar K.R. Höök M. Narayana S.V. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6660-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), similar to SdrG and ClfA, and that the two ligands bind to the same region of the binding trench. Both ligand peptides form parallel β-strand complementations with a β-strand (strand G) in N3. We show that several residues in ClfB are important for binding to both ligands and identify an interactive motif GSSGXG found in both ligands. However, the MSCRAMM residues engaged by residues in the common motif differ somewhat between the two ligands. In addition, ClfB interacts with several Fg-specific residues outside the common motif suggesting that the identified motif constitutes only part of the ClfB-binding sites. Escherichia coli strains XL-1 Blue and TOPP3 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were used as hosts for cloning and expression, respectively. Cells were grown in LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. DNA restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA segments encoding the N2N3 domain of ClfB (accession number YP_001333563.1) or its corresponding truncated versions were amplified by PCR using S. aureus Newman chromosomal DNA as template. Enzyme restriction sites BamHI and HindIII were incorporated at the 5′ ends of the primers to facilitate cloning in pQE30 expression plasmid (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the pQE30 ClfB(212–542) plasmid as template. The introduction of specific mutations was performed using primers listed in Table 1. The resulting PCR mixtures were digested using DpnI for 1 h at 37 °C to eliminate parental DNA and transformed into E. coli XL-1 Blue competent cells. The presence of appropriate DNA sequences was confirmed by Sanger sequencing using specific forward and reverse pQE30 sequencing primers at the Baylor College of Medicine DNA Core Facility, Houston, TX.TABLE 1Oligonucleotide primers used to amplify gene fragmentsClfB(212–542)_F5′cacgggatccggtacaaatgtaaatgataaagtClfB(212–542)_R5′cacgaagcttttaatttactgctgaatcaccaClfB(212–526)_F5′cacgggatccggtacaaatgtaaatgataaagttClfB(212–526)_R5′cacgaagcttttaattctcattattccaaccgClfB_Q235A_F5′aatttcaagttagaaaagactacatttgaccctaatgcaagtggtaacacatttatgClfB_Q235A_R5′cataaatgtgttaccacttgcattagggtcaaatgtagtcttttctaacttgaaattClfB_S236Q_F5′tagaaaagactacatttgaccctaatcaacagggtaacacatttatggcggcaaattClfB_S236Q_R5′aatttgccgccataaatgtgttaccctgttgattagggtcaaatgtagtcttttctaClfB_N238A_F5′acatttgaccctaatcaaagtggtgccacatttatggcggcaaattttacClfB_N238A_R5′gtaaaatttgccgccataaatgtggcaccactttgattagggtcaaatgtClfB_D270E_F5′cagatagtttaactggtaatggagaggtggattattctaattcaaataataClfB_D270E_R5′tattatttgaattagaataatccacctctccattaccagttaaactatctgClfB_F328A_F5′agaaaatattaacggacaattttcattacctttagctacagaccgagcaaaggcClfB_F328A_R5′gcctttgctcggtctgtagctaaaggtaatgaaaattgtccgttaatattttctClfB_Q377A_F5′caaatggcgcgaacatttcttctgcaattattggtgtagatacagcttClfB_Q377A_R5′aagctgtatctacaccaataattgcagaagaaatgttcgcgccatttgClfB_T383A_F5′acatttcttctcaaattattggtgtagatgcagcttcaggtcaaaacClfB_T383A_R5′gttttgacctgaagctgcatctacaccaataatttgagaagaaatgtClfB_W522A_F5′caaatagagactacagtattttcggtgcgaataatgagaatgttgtacgttatgClfB_W522A_R5′cataacgtacaacattctcattattcgcaccgaaaatactgtagtctctatttgClfB_N526Q_F5′gtattttcggttggaataatgagcaggttgtacgttatggtggtggaagClfB_N526Q_R5′cttccaccaccataacgtacaacctgctcattattccaaccgaaaatacClfB_Y530A_F5′ggttggaataatgagaatgttgtacgtgctggtggtggaagtgClfB_Y530A_R5′cacttccaccaccagcacgtacaacattctcattattccaac Open table in a new tab Expression and purification of recombinant MSCRAMM proteins were performed as described previously for SdrC (33Barbu E.M. Ganesh V.K. Gurusiddappa S. Mackenzie R.C. Foster T.J. Sudhof T.C. Höök M. PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1000726Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, recombinant proteins were expressed from appropriate plasmids in E. coli TOPP3. Overnight starter cultures were diluted 1:50 in LB-containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and incubated with shaking until the culture reached A600 0.6–0.8. Recombinant protein expression was induced by addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration) and continued during a 4-h incubation. Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in PBS, and frozen at −80 °C. Recombinant proteins were purified from cell lysates by Ni2+ affinity and ion exchange chromatography. Immulon 4BH plates were coated with 1 μg of Fg (obtained from ChromogenixAB) or recombinant K10 (produced as described previously (22Walsh E.J. O'Brien L.M. Liang X. Hook M. Foster T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50691-50699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Coated wells were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 3% BSA in 0.5% Tween/TBS buffer. Increasing concentrations of ClfB recombinant proteins were added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were washed, and bound ClfB protein was detected with a polyclonal antibody (1:3000) against ClfBN2N3 (H.T.I. BioProducts) followed by an anti-rabbit HRP-labeled antibody (1:5000) (Bio-Rad). HRP-dependent color development using SigmaFast OPD (Sigma) as a substrate was monitored using a microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices) at 450 nm. Data presented represent the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. The binding was analyzed by nonlinear regression for one binding site (GraphPad Prism). The relative binding was calculated as percent of the wild type protein binding which was considered 100%. Initially, a droplet of 2 μl of rClfBN123 at 9 mg/ml and 2 μl of 0.7 m sodium formate was equilibrated against a reservoir containing 1 ml of 1.44 m sodium citrate. The crystals belong to tetragonal P43212 space group. Electron spray ionization-mass spectrometry measurements on the dissolved crystals revealed that the rClfBN123 (59 kDa) had broken down to a molecular mass of 38 kDa, and the N-terminal sequencing revealed Ala-199 as the N terminus. Subsequently, for the structural and biochemical ligand binding studies, recombinant ClfB(212–542) was used. Crystals of the ClfB·K10 peptide complex were generated by soaking apo-crystals of ClfB(212–542) in the peptide solution. Apo-crystals of ClfB(212–542) were first grown by mixing 1.5 μl of protein solution with 1 μl of reservoir solution containing 0.9 m sodium citrate, 90 mm imidazole, pH 8.0. These apo-ClfB(212–542) crystals were soaked in 1 mm of K10 peptide containing the reservoir solution for 5 h at 20 °C. Large chunky apo-ClfB(212–542) crystals cracked after a few minutes of soaking, but a large piece of crystal was used for the x-ray data collection. A similar soaking method was adopted to obtain the co-crystal of 16 residues Fg α-chain peptide with ClfB(212–542). Diffraction data to a 2.45-Å resolution was collected on a R-axis IV image plate detector mounted on a Rigaku rotating-anode generator. Data were collected over 120° at a distance of 200 mm with 1° oscillations. Data statistics are reported in Table 2. The crystal structure was solved by the multiple isomorphous replacement method. Four derivatives, trimethyl lead acetate, ethyl mercurithiosalicylate, uranyl acetate, and mersalyl acid were identified by difference Patterson analysis using the program XTALVIEW (34McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). The trimethyl lead acetate and uranyl acetate had two sites each, and ethyl mercurithiosalicylate and mersalyl acid had one. Refinement of heavy atom derivatives and subsequent phase calculations were performed using the program SOLVE (35Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). An initial 3.5-Å electron density map clearly defined the solvent and revealed well connected main-chain densities. The initial CA trace was made using the baton mode in O. Side chains were incorporated into the model, and further refinements were done using CNS (36Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). The initial R-factor/Rfree of the fully built model with side chains was 33.9/41.0%. The model building was performed using O in conjunctions with Oops. Maximum likelihood refinement and bulk solvent correction were done with CNS (36Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L.

Three residues, Val-204, Asn-207, and Thr-213, were in the disallowed region. However, all three with higher temperature factors and weak electron density were in the flexible region of the N terminus of the protein.TABLE 2Crystallographic data measurement and refinement dataClfB(199–542)ClfB((212–542))·K10 peptideClfB((212–542))·Fg α-chain peptideCell dimensionsa, b, c96.4, 96.4, 84.1 Å85.6, 85.6, 84.8 Å86.2, 86.2, 83.9 Åα, β, γ90°90°90°Space groupP43 21 2P43P43Max resolution2.45 Å2.60 Å2.50 ÅReflections unique15,06118,83021,349Completeness98.9% (96.0%)99.6% (99.8%)99.8% (100%)RmergeaRmerge = Σ|Ij − 〈I〉|/Σ Ii; where Ij is the measured and 〈I〉 is the mean intensity of reflection hkl.0.0610.0800.061No. of molecules in the asymmetric unit111R-factor/Rfreeb+Rfree is calculated over 5% of randomly selected reflections not included in the refinement.0.204/0.2810.182/0.2190.178/0.207Average B value31.3 Å38.2 Å25.8 ÅNo. of non-hydrogen atoms282126532733Protein264224632463Peptide5666Water179134204Root mean square deviations from ideal valuesBond lengths0.006 Å0.019 Å0.016 ÅBond angles1.20°1.64°1.55°a Rmerge = Σ|Ij − 〈I〉|/Σ Ii; where Ij is the measured and 〈I〉 is the mean intensity of reflection hkl.b +Rfree is calculated over 5% of randomly selected reflections not included in the refinement. Open table in a new tab Crystals soaked in the peptide solution were flash-frozen with a stabilizing solution containing 25% glycerol. Diffraction data were measured on Rigaku R-Axis IV2+ detector. A total of 120 frames was collected at a detector distance of 150 mm with 1° oscillation for the ClfB·K10 peptide complex and 180 frames for the ClfB·Fg α-chain peptide complex. Data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using HKL2000 (37Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The co-crystals of K10 and Fg α-chain peptides diffracted to 2.6 and 2.5 Å resolution, respectively, and the data statistics are listed in Table 2. The structure was solved by molecular replacement with the program PHASER (38McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

After obtaining the structure solution of ClfB using molecular replacement, it was subjected to simulated annealing at 1000 K using CNS (36Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

Electron density maps calculated at this point clearly showed electron density for peptide molecules in the binding trench between the N2 and N3 domains.

Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). In the ClfB·K10 peptide complex, electron density was not observed for the N-terminal peptide residues Tyr-473, Gly-474, Gly-475, and Gly-476. Electron density for the side chain of Ser-477 was not observed, but backbone atoms of Ser-477 could be modeled. The numbering refers to residues in the human K10. The C-terminal residues of ClfB from 532 to 542 in the ClfB·K10 peptide complex and residues 529 to 542 in the ClfB·Fg α-chain peptide complex were not modeled due to lack of detected electron density. In the ClfB·Fg α-chain complex, additional density was observed for the three modeled terminal residues 526–528 and were therefore modeled as an alternative conformation. The ClfB·K10 peptide and ClfB·Fg α-chain peptide structures, respectively, were refined to final R-factors of 18.1 and 17.8% and Rfree values of 21.8 and 20.7%. Stereochemical quality of the model was validated using PROCHECK (41Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar), and figures were made using RIBBONS (42Carson M.J. J. Mol. Graph. 1997; 5: 103-106Crossref Scopus (514) Google Scholar) and PyMOL. Crystals of ClfB(199–542) were obtained by the hanging drop method using the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” The crystal structure was determined at 2.45 Å resolution by the multiple isomorphous replacement method. The recombinant ClfB(199–542) crystallized in the tetragonal space group P43212 consists of eight asymmetric units. The crystallographic and refinement statistics are presented in Table 2. ClfB(199–542) folded into two domains, each adopting the DE variant of the IgG fold in a similar fashion to ClfA and SdrG (Fig. 1B) (16Ponnuraj K. Bowden M.G. Davis S. Gurusiddappa S. Moore D.

https://openalex.org/W2065566741,"Simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) has caused lethal outbreaks of hemorrhagic disease in captive primates, but its distribution in wild primates has remained obscure. Here, we describe the discovery and genetic characterization by direct pyrosequencing of two novel, divergent SHFV variants co-infecting a single male red colobus monkey from Kibale National Park, Uganda.The viruses were detected directly from blood plasma using pyrosequencing, without prior virus isolation and with minimal PCR amplification. The two new SHFV variants, SHFV-krc1 and SHFV-krc2 are highly divergent from each other (51.9% nucleotide sequence identity) and from the SHFV type strain LVR 42-0/M6941 (52.0% and 51.8% nucleotide sequence identity, respectively) and demonstrate greater phylogenetic diversity within SHFV than has been documented within any other arterivirus. Both new variants nevertheless have the same 3' genomic architecture as the type strain, containing three open reading frames not present in the other arteriviruses.These results represent the first documentation of SHFV in a wild primate and confirm the unusual 3' genetic architecture of SHFV relative to the other arteriviruses. They also demonstrate a degree of evolutionary divergence within SHFV that is roughly equivalent to the degree of divergence between other arterivirus species. The presence of two such highly divergent SHFV variants co-infecting a single individual represents a degree of within-host viral diversity that exceeds what has previously been reported for any arterivirus. These results expand our knowledge of the natural history and diversity of the arteriviruses and underscore the importance of wild primates as reservoirs for novel pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2101581446,"Primary cilia are found on many epithelial cell types, including renal tubular epithelial cells, where they participate in flow sensing. Disruption of cilia function has been linked to the pathogenesis of polycystic kidney disease. We demonstrated previously that the exocyst, a highly conserved eight-protein membrane trafficking complex, localizes to primary cilia of renal tubular epithelial cells, is required for ciliogenesis, biochemically and genetically interacts with polycystin-2 (the protein product of the polycystic kidney disease 2 gene), and, when disrupted, results in MAPK pathway activation both in vitro and in vivo. The small GTPase Cdc42 is a candidate for regulation of the exocyst at the primary cilium. Here, we demonstrate that Cdc42 biochemically interacts with Sec10, a crucial component of the exocyst complex, and that Cdc42 colocalizes with Sec10 at the primary cilium. Expression of dominant negative Cdc42 and shRNA-mediated knockdown of both Cdc42 and Tuba, a Cdc42 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, inhibit ciliogenesis in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Furthermore, exocyst Sec8 and polycystin-2 no longer localize to primary cilia or the ciliary region following Cdc42 and Tuba knockdown. We also show that Sec10 directly interacts with Par6, a member of the Par complex that itself directly interacts with Cdc42. Finally, we show that Cdc42 knockdown results in activation of the MAPK pathway, something observed in cells with dysfunctional primary cilia. These data support a model in which Cdc42 localizes the exocyst to the primary cilium, whereupon the exocyst then targets and docks vesicles carrying proteins necessary for ciliogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2051490728,"Protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) has been proposed to exhibit an ""unfoldase"" activity against the catalytic A1 subunit of cholera toxin (CT). Unfolding of the CTA1 subunit is thought to displace it from the CT holotoxin and to prepare it for translocation to the cytosol. To date, the unfoldase activity of PDI has not been demonstrated for any substrate other than CTA1. An alternative explanation for the putative unfoldase activity of PDI has been suggested by recent structural studies demonstrating that CTA1 will unfold spontaneously upon its separation from the holotoxin at physiological temperature. Thus, PDI may simply dislodge CTA1 from the CT holotoxin without unfolding the CTA1 subunit. To evaluate the role of PDI in CT disassembly and CTA1 unfolding, we utilized a real-time assay to monitor the PDI-mediated separation of CTA1 from the CT holotoxin and directly examined the impact of PDI binding on CTA1 structure by isotope-edited Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Our collective data demonstrate that PDI is required for disassembly of the CT holotoxin but does not unfold the CTA1 subunit, thus uncovering a new mechanism for CTA1 dissociation from its holotoxin."

We report that a protein complex that regulates cell junctions is required for VEGF-driven directional migration and for angiogenesis in vivo. The complex consists of RhoA and Syx, a RhoA guanine exchange factor cross-linked by the Crumbs polarity protein Mupp1 to angiomotin, a phosphatidylinositol-binding protein. The Syx-associated complex translocates to the leading edge of migrating cells by membrane trafficking that requires the tight junction recycling GTPase Rab13. In turn, Rab13 associates with Grb2, targeting Syx and RhoA to Tyr1175-phosphorylated VEGFR2 at the leading edge. Rab13 knockdown in zebrafish impeded sprouting of intersegmental vessels and diminished the directionality of their tip cells. These results indicate that endothelial cell mobility in sprouting vessels is facilitated by shuttling the same protein complex from disassembling junctions to the leading edges of cells.

The recycling of vertebrate adherens and tight junctions is mediated by the GTPases Rab8 and Rab13, respectively (7Yamamura R. Nishimura N. Nakatsuji H. Arase S. Sasaki T. Mol. Biol.

Recent studies have shown that endocytosis and trafficking play an important role in facilitating directional cell migration (8Ulrich F. Heisenberg C.P. Traffic. 2009; 10: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In mouse neurons, directional migration required Rab5- and Rab11-dependent trafficking of the adherens junction protein cadherin (9Kawauchi T. Sekine K. Shikanai M. Chihama K. Tomita K. Kubo K.

Nat. Cell. Biol. 2008; 10: 964-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The directional migration of border cells during Drosophila oogenesis, guided by EGF and PDGF/VEGF receptor tyrosine kinases, required proteins that mediate receptor tyrosine kinase endocytosis (11Jékely G. Sung H.H. Luque C.M. Rørth P. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 197-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and Rab11 (12Janssens K. Sung H.H. Rørth P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 7323-7328Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The coupling between trafficking and cell migration was highlighted in a recent study showing that the activity of Rac, a Rho GTPase essential for cell migration (13Raftopoulou M. Hall A. Dev. Biol. 2004; 265: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar), required Rab5-dependent trafficking (14Palamidessi A. Frittoli E. Garré M. Faretta M. Mione M. Testa I. Diaspro A. Lanzetti L. Scita G. Di Fiore P.P. Cell. 2008; 134: 135-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Rac was activated on early endosomes, likely by the guanine exchange factor Tiam1 residing on the same endosome. Thus, Rab5-dependent trafficking regulated the spatial activity pattern of Rac and facilitated directional cell migration by determining where lamellipodia formed. RhoA participates both in the regulation of cell junctions (15Jou T.S. Schneeberger E.E. Nelson W.J. J. Cell. Biol. 1998; 142: 101-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) and in driving cell migration (13Raftopoulou M. Hall A. Dev. Biol. 2004; 265: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar), but the mechanism that regulates the cellular localization of RhoA so as to enable its dual functions is unknown. The spatial pattern of Rho GTPase activity in the cell is determined primarily by the localization of Rho guanine exchange factors, which are often targeted to specific cellular locations via the binding of their carboxyl terminus PDZ-binding motif to PDZ domain-containing proteins (16García-Mata R. Burridge K. Trends Cell. Biol. 2007; 17: 36-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In accordance, we had found that the localization the RhoA-specific guanine exchange factor Syx (named alternatively Plekhg5 or Tech) and the spatial activity pattern of RhoA depended on the PDZ-binding motif of Syx (17Liu M. Horowitz A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1880-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Syx binds via this motif the PDZ domain of the adaptor protein synectin (named alternatively Gipc1) (17Liu M. Horowitz A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1880-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and PDZ domains 10 and 13 of multi-PDZ domain protein 1 (Mupp1) (18Estévez M.A. Henderson J.A. Ahn D. Zhu X.R. Poschmann G.

Baraban, Peter Storz, Arie Horowitz, and Panos Z. Anastasiadis, unpublished results. Here we report that the functional duality of Syx and RhoA as regulators of both cell junctions and migration is conferred by their cotrafficking from EC junctions to the leading edge. Affinity purified anti-Syx was raised in chicken (Aves Labs) as described (17Liu M. Horowitz A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1880-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and used at 10 mg/ml. Amot antiserum was raised in rabbit (Dr. Earl Poptic, Hybridoma Core Facility, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic Foundation) against the 24 most carboxyl-terminal amino acids, as in Ernkvist et al. (21Ernkvist M. Aase K. Ukomadu C. Wohlschlegel J. Blackman R. Veitonmäki N. Bratt A. Dutta A. Holmgren L. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 2000-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and used at a 1:1600 dilution. Antiserum to Mupp1 (a gift of Dr. Ronald Javier, Baylor College of Medicine) (22Lee S.S. Glaunsinger B. Mantovani F. Banks L. Javier R.T. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9680-9693Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) was used at 1:100 dilution. Antibodies to Rab13 (Millipore or Santa Cruz Biotechnology), RhoA (Abcam), Grb2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Tyr(P)1175 VEGFR2 (GenScript), and phalloidin-Alexa647 (Invitrogen) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Conjugated secondary antibodies were from Invitrogen (Alexa 488, 568, and 647), from Jackson ImmunoResearch (FITC), and from Bio-Rad (peroxidase). Validated lentiviral shRNA targeting mouse rab13 (CCGGGCCAAGAACGATTCAAGACAACTCGAGTTGTCTTGAATCGTTCTTGGCTTTTTG) and negative control lentiviral shRNA (SHC002V) were purchased from Sigma. ECs from syx+/+ and syx−/− hearts of adult mice of congenic C57/BL6 background were isolated as described (23Chittenden T.W. Claes F. Lanahan A.A. Autiero M. Palac R.T. Tkachenko E.V. Elfenbein A.

The polyoma middle T-immortalized amot+/+ and amot−/− ECs and their growth conditions were described previously (21Ernkvist M. Aase K. Ukomadu C. Wohlschlegel J. Blackman R. Veitonmäki N. Bratt A. Dutta A. Holmgren L. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 2000-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). ECs were grown on fibronectin (R & D Systems)-coated round (12-mm diameter) glass coverslips. Two days before immunolabeling, ECs were starved for the first day in 0.5% and in serum-free DMEM on the second day. In part of the experiments, ECs were incubated in starvation medium at a uniform VEGF-A164 (R & D Systems) concentration of 20 ng/ml on ice for 30 min. At the start of the experiment (0 min), the medium was replaced with fresh starvation medium prewarmed to 37 °C, and the cells were placed in 37 °C at 5% CO2 for the durations indicated under “Results.” In Dunn chamber experiments (see below), the coverslip was placed on top of the chamber and incubated as above for 30 min. ECs were washed immediately after the coverslip was dismounted by ice-cold PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 30 min, and permeabilized in 10% Triton X-100/PBS for 10 min. ECs labeled by anti-ZO1 were fixed and permeabilized by methanol at −20 °C for 5 min. ECs immunolabeled by anti-Syx underwent antigen retrieval by 1 min of immersion in boiling 10 mm sodium citrate, pH 8.6, containing 0.05% Tween 20, instead of permeabilization. ECs were blocked for 40 min at room temperature by 10% PBS serum of the host species of the secondary antibody. After immunolabeling by primary antibodies diluted in PBS overnight at 4 °C, ECs were washed with PBS and incubated with fluorescently tagged secondary antibodies diluted in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. The coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Prolong Gold (Invitrogen), a DAPI-containing medium. ECs were imaged a Leica TCS-NT confocal microscope by ×63 (1.4 NA) or ×40 (1.0 NA) objectives. Coverslips dismounted from Dunn chamber were imaged only around the region that was directly above the bridge separating the two wells of the chamber, so as to record only ECs subjected to the 0–20 ng/ml VEGF-A164 gradient. The adenovirus-encoded FRET RhoA probe (24Pertz O. Hodgson L. Klemke R.L. Hahn K.M. Nature. 2006; 440: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) subcloned into pAd/CMV/V5-DEST (Invitrogen) was coexpressed with lentivirus-encoded rab13-targeted or control nontargeted shRNA (Mission shRNA; Sigma) 48 h ahead of the experiment. The coverslips were mounted on top of a Dunn chamber and imaged either with or without a 0–100 ng/ml VEGF-A164 linear gradient for 5 min at 37 °C on Leica TCS-NT confocal microscope after paraformaldehyde fixation. The VEGF concentration and timing followed conditions of peak FRET-detected RhoA activity in previous studies (24Pertz O. Hodgson L. Klemke R.L. Hahn K.M. Nature. 2006; 440: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). FRET efficiency was calculated by dividing the background-subtracted yellow fluorescent protein emission by the background-subtracted cyan fluorescent protein emission, using custom-written macros in Image-Pro 7.0 (Media Cybernetics). A total of 40 ECs treated by nontargeting or by rab13-targeted shRNA were imaged in each group. The direction of the FRET pattern polarization was determined by eye. Colocalization was quantified by CoolLocalizer (Cytolight, Stockholm, Sweden), based on Pearson's correlation coefficient (25Manders E.M. Stap J. Brakenhoff G.J. van Driel R. Aten J.A. J. Cell. Sci. 1992; 103: 857-862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The polarization of the colocalization pattern was determined by measuring the colocalization level in each of six 60-degree sectors. The center of the first sector was aligned in the gradient direction and designated as 0 degrees. Colocalization was calculated in 10 ECs from at least two experiments and presented as a radial graph of the means and standard deviations of the colocalization level in each sector. The significance of the difference (p) was determined by a two-sample t test of the sectors with the highest and the second highest colocalization levels. Confluent ECs grown in a 35-mm dish were lysed in 250 μl of lysis solution (Cytoskeleton) and incubated with 1 μg of anti-Rab13 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. Antibody-bound complexes were precipitated with protein G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and eluted by boiling the thoroughly washed beads in SDS sample buffer. Eluted proteins were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad), transferred to a PVDF membrane (Pierce) at 25 V for 1 h, and detected by anti-Grb2 (Santa Cruz) followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad). Immunoblotted bands were detected by exposure to BioMax XAR film (Kodak). The Dunn chamber and its assembly were described in detail before (26Wells C.M. Ridley A.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 294: 31-41PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 104 primary mouse heart ECs were seeded on fibronectin-coated square glass coverslips and starved overnight prior to the assay. Both concentric wells of the chamber were filled with starvation medium (DMEM with 0.5% BSA), and a coverslip seeded with ECs was inverted onto the chamber in an offset position leaving a narrow slit at one edge for refilling the outer well. The coverslip was sealed in place using a 60 °C-melted wax mixture (paraffin, beeswax, Vaseline, 1:1:1) around the edges, except for the filling slit. To set up a linear radially directed VEGF-A164 gradient, the medium in the outer well was drained and replaced by starvation medium containing 0.5% BSA and 20 ng/ml VEGF-A164. The slit was then sealed by hot wax mixture. For control experiments in which ECs were subjected to uniform concentrations of chemoattractant, both wells were filled with medium containing VEGF (20 ng/ml). Migrating ECs were imaged on Leica DM IRB inverted microscope equipped with CoolSnap HQ cooled CCD camera (Photometrics) on a motorized stage (Prior Scientific) prewarmed to 37 °C. Stage positions were preprogrammed by MetaMorph 6.3r2 software (Molecular Devices). The Dunn chamber assembly was preincubated for 30 min to let its temperature equilibrate and a linear gradient to form between the outer and inner wells. The coverslip region laying directly above the circular ridge separating the outer and inner wells was imaged every 5 min for 1 h. The trajectories of migrating ECs were tracked manually, and their X-Y positions were input into Image-Pro for path plotting and analysis. The probability of the null hypothesis (that the migration of the 20–50 ECs sampled in each experiment was not directional) was determined by Rayleigh test for unimodal clustering (27Zicha D. Dunn G. Jones G. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 75: 449-457PubMed Google Scholar). The 95% confidence interval of the mean direction was calculated using a Batschelet chart (27Zicha D. Dunn G. Jones G. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 75: 449-457PubMed Google Scholar). Zebrafish were maintained, and the embryos were imaged as described (28Xie J. Farage E. Sugimoto M. Anand-Apte B. BMC Dev. Biol. 2010; 10: 76Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (MOs) were designed and purchased from by GeneTools. The MO1 sequence spans the rab13 ATG codon: GAAGTCGTACTTCTTTGCCATTGTT. MO2 targets the rab13 exon 2-intron 2 border: AGAATCTTTGTTTACCAGACTTGCA. A 5-base pair mismatch of MO2 with the sequence AGAATGTTTCTTTAGCACACTTCCA served as negative control. To investigate the mechanism underlying the angiogenic defects we detected previously in the syx−/− mouse and in the zebrafish syx morphant (19Garnaas M.K. Moodie K.L. Liu M.L. Samant G.V. Li K. Marx R. Baraban J.M. Horowitz A. Ramchandran R. Circ. Res. 2008; 103: 710-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we compared the directional response of syx+/+ and syx−/− ECs induced by VEGF-A164. An angiogenesis paradigm generalized from observations of vascular development in the retina (29Gerhardt H. Golding M. Fruttiger M. Ruhrberg C. Lundkvist A. Abramsson A. Jeltsch M. Mitchell C. Alitalo K. Shima D. Betsholtz C. J. Cell. Biol. 2003; 161: 1163-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2139) Google Scholar) posits that sprouting vessels follow a VEGF gradient. To simulate the in vivo conditions, we subjected ECs to a VEGF-A164 gradient (0–20 ng/ml) in a Dunn chemotaxis chamber (27Zicha D. Dunn G. Jones G. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 75: 449-457PubMed Google Scholar). The basal migration distances of syx+/+ and syx−/− ECs in the absence of VEGF-A were similarly low (Fig. 1A). Both cell types migrated in response to a uniform VEGF-A164 concentration, although the distances traveled by syx−/− ECs were shorter than those traveled by syx+/+ ECs (Fig. 1B), similar to our previous observations (19Garnaas M.K. Moodie K.L. Liu M.L. Samant G.V. Li K. Marx R. Baraban J.M. Horowitz A. Ramchandran R. Circ. Res. 2008; 103: 710-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The responses of the two cell types to a VEGF-A164 gradient were drastically different from each other: syx+/+ EC followed the direction of the gradient, whereas syx−/− ECs failed to respond in a directional manner (Fig. 1C). The difference between the responses of syx+/+ EC and syx−/− ECs cannot be accounted for by a lower VEGFR2 expression level in the latter (supplemental Fig. S1). These results indicate that Syx is required for EC directional migration. We have recently found that Syx is required for the maintenance of endothelial and epithelial cell junctions. 6Siu P. Ngok, Rory Geyer, Sudesh Agrawal, Antonios Kourtidis, Laura J. Lewis-Tuffin, Karen L. Moodie, Deborah Huveldt, Chuanshen Wu, Miaoliang Liu, Ruth Marx, Jay M. Baraban, Peter Storz, Arie Horowitz, and Panos Z. Anastasiadis, unpublished results. We had found earlier that Syx was localized to the leading edge of migrating ECs and that it was required for EC migration (17Liu M. Horowitz A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1880-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19Garnaas M.K. Moodie K.L. Liu M.L. Samant G.V. Li K. Marx R. Baraban J.M. Horowitz A. Ramchandran R. Circ. Res. 2008; 103: 710-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Syx associates through the PDZ adaptor protein synectin with myosin VI (17Liu M. Horowitz A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1880-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), an actin-based molecular motor involved in membrane traffic (30Aschenbrenner L. Lee T. Hasson T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2728-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This association implies that Syx could traffic, possibly facilitating its translocation from cell junctions to the leading edge and enabling its involvement in the regulation of both cell junctions and migration. In quiescent ECs, Syx was localized primarily at cell junctions and in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1D). Immunofluorescence revealed that stimulation by VEGF-A164 induced the appearance of Syx primarily in cytoplasmic punctae (Figs. 1F and 2B). We used standard endocytic markers to test whether these punctae represented endocytic vesicles. The Syx-containing punctae did not colocalize, however, with clathrin heavy chain, AP3, Rab5, EEA1, Rab4, and Rab11 (data not shown). Because Syx is localized to cell junctions of confluent cells, we immunolabeled VEGF-treated ECs for Rab13, a GTPase known to be involved in recycling the tight junction transmembrane proteins occludin (31Morimoto S. Nishimura N. Terai T. Manabe S. Yamamoto Y. Shinahara W. Miyake H. Tashiro S. Shimada M. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2220-2228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and claudin-1 (32Marzesco A.M. Dunia I. Pandjaitan R. Recouvreur M. Dauzonne D. Benedetti E.L. Louvard D. Zahraoui A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1819-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Although Syx and Rab13 did not colocalize in quiescent ECs (Fig. 1E), treatment with a uniform VEGF-A164 concentration induced extensive colocalization throughout the cytoplasm within the first 2 min (Fig. 1F). This is in agreement with previous studies reporting that in unpolarized cells, such as the ECs shown in Fig. 1 (D–G), Rab13 is present exclusively in cytoplasmic vesicles (33Zahraoui A. Joberty G. Arpin M. Fontaine J.J. Hellio R. Tavitian A. Louvard D. J. Cell. Biol. 1994; 124: 101-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). When placed under a VEGF-A164 gradient (0–20 ng/ml) in a Dunn chamber, ECs formed lamellipodia and polarized in the gradient direction (Fig. 1G). Strikingly, Rab13 and Syx colocalized at the leading edge within 30 min. The extent of colocalization between Rab13 and Syx was highest in the 60-degree sector facing the gradient direction (Fig. 1H), indicating that the VEGF-A164 gradient polarized the colocalization pattern of Syx and Rab13. The localization at the leading edge suggests that similar to Syx, Rab13 has a multifaceted role that includes trafficking of junction proteins to the leading edge of migrating cells. Because Syx is a RhoA-specific GTPase (18Estévez M.A. Henderson J.A. Ahn D. Zhu X.R. Poschmann G. Lübbert H. Marx R. Baraban J.M. J. Neurochem. 2008; 106: 1287-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 34Marx R. Henderson J. Wang J. Baraban J.M. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we sought to determine the localization of its effector. There was little colocalization between Syx and RhoA in quiescent ECs (Fig. 2A). In contrast, a uniform VEGF-A164 concentration (20 ng/ml) induced extensive colocalization of Syx and RhoA on endocytic vesicles within 2 min (Fig. 2B). The localization of Syx and RhoA in ECs under VEGF-A164 gradient was polarized in the gradient direction, mainly at the leading edge (Fig. 2C). The extent of colocalized Syx and RhoA in the frontal 60-degree sector was more than 2-fold higher than in all other 60-degree sectors (Fig. 2D). To investigate the dependence of EC directional migration and Syx trafficking on Rab13, we knocked down rab13 by shRNA (supplemental Fig. S2). The migration of Rab13-deficient ECs in response to a VEGF-A164 gradient was not directional, similar to that of syx−/− ECs (Fig. 3A), suggesting that Rab13-dependent trafficking of Syx and RhoA is required for maintaining directional migration. In agreement, Syx and RhoA did not colocalize in Rab13-deficient ECs neither under uniform VEGF-A164 (Fig. 3B) nor under a VEGF-A164 gradient (Fig. 3C). These results show that Rab13 is required for VEGF-guided migration, as well as for Syx and RhoA trafficking. In addition to its role in tight junction recycling, Rab13 mediates traffic between the trans-Golgi network and recycling endosomes (35Nokes R.L. Fields I.C. Collins R.N. Fölsch H. J. Cell. Biol. 2008; 182: 845-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Because all of the Syx-associated proteins are cytoplasmic rather than transmembrane receptors, they are not expected to traffic via the trans-Golgi network. It is unlikely, therefore, that the directional migration and trafficking defects caused by rab13 silencing resulted from impairment of Rab13-dependent traffic from the trans-Golgi network to recycling endosomes. The dependence of Syx and RhoA trafficking on Rab13 suggests that the spatial pattern of RhoA activity may similarly depend on Rab13-mediated trafficking. To test this premise, we used a FRET probe consisting of the Rho-binding domain of rhotekin, cyan fluorescent protein, yellow fluorescent protein, and RhoA (24Pertz O. Hodgson L. Klemke R.L. Hahn K.M. Nature. 2006; 440: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The probe detects RhoA-specific guanine exchange factor activity. In 50% of ECs transfected by nontargeting shRNA and stimulated by VEGF-A164 in a Dunn chamber, the FRET spatial pattern was polarized at a mean direction of 18.4 ± 10.5 degrees relative to the gradient direction (Fig. 3D). Active RhoA was localized to either cytoplasmic punctae or along the leading edge, similar to RhoA localization (Fig. 2C) and to the RhoA activity pattern reported by previous FRET studies (36Kurokawa K. Matsuda M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4294-4303Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 37Machacek M. Hodgson L. Welch C. Elliott H. Pertz O. Nalbant P. Abell A. Johnson G.L. Hahn K.M. Danuser G. Nature. 2009; 461: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). The FRET pattern was polarized only in 10% of ECs transfected with rab13-targeted shRNA, at a mean direction of 87 ± 41.8 degrees (Fig. 3E), i.e. without a directional preference. These results confirm the dependence of the spatial pattern of RhoA activity on Rab13. In a recent study, we proposed a molecular mechanism to account for the VEGF-induced removal of Syx from tight junctions. 6Siu P. Ngok, Rory Geyer, Sudesh Agrawal, Antonios Kourtidis, Laura J. Lewis-Tuffin, Karen L. Moodie, Deborah Huveldt, Chuanshen Wu, Miaoliang Liu, Ruth Marx, Jay M. Baraban, Peter Storz, Arie Horowitz, and Panos Z. Anastasiadis, unpublished results. Similar to other junctional proteins (9Kawauchi T. Sekine K. Shikanai M. Chihama K. Tomita K. Kubo K. Nakajima K. Nabeshima Y. Hoshino M.

It is unlikely that Syx is recruited to vesicles by its pleckstrin homology domain, because such domains favor binding to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-phosphate, whereas the prevalent phosphoinositide-phosphate in endosomal membranes is phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (38Lindmo K.

However, unrelated cysteine ld-transpeptidases have been recently recognized as a predominant mode of peptidoglycan cross-linking in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and as a bypass mechanism conferring resistance to all β-lactams, except carbapenems such as imipenem, in Enterococcus faecium. Investigation of the mechanism of inhibition of this new β-lactam target showed that acylation of the E. faecium enzyme (Ldtfm) by imipenem is irreversible. Using fluorescence kinetics, an original approach was developed to independently determine the catalytic constants for imipenem binding (k1 = 0.061 μm−1 min−1) and acylation (kinact = 4.5 min−1). The binding step was limiting at the minimal drug concentration required for bacterial growth inhibition. The Michaelis complex was committed to acylation because its dissociation was negligible. The emergence of imipenem resistance involved substitutions in Ldtfm that reduced the rate of formation of the non-covalent complex but only marginally affected the efficiency of the acylation step. The methods described in this study will facilitate development of new carbapenems active on extensively resistant M. tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W1996961120,"Among human N-formyl peptide chemoattractant receptors, FPR2/ALX and FPR3 share the highest degree of amino acid identity (83%), and trigger similar cell responses upon ligand binding. Although FPR2/ALX is a promiscuous receptor, FPR3 has only one specific high affinity ligand, F2L, and a more restricted tissue/cell distribution. In this study, we showed that FPR2/ALX behaved as the prototypical receptor FPR1. The agonist-dependent phosphorylation used a hierarchical mechanism with a prominent role of Ser329, Thr332, and Thr335. Phosphorylation of FPR2/ALX was essential for its desensitization but the lack of phosphorylation did not result in enhanced or sustained responses. In contrast, resting FPR3 displayed a marked level of phosphorylation, which was only slightly increased upon agonist stimulation. Another noticeable difference between the two receptors was their subcellular distribution in unstimulated cells. Although FPR2/ALX was evenly distributed at the plasma membrane FPR3 was localized in small intracellular vesicles. By swapping domains between FPR2/ALX and FPR3, we uncovered the determinants involved in the basal phosphorylation of FPR3. Experiments aimed at monitoring receptor-bound antibody uptake showed that the intracellular distribution of FPR3 resulted from a constitutive internalization that was independent of C terminus phosphorylation. Unexpectedly, exchanging residues 1 to 53, which encompass the N-terminal extracellular region and the first transmembrane domain, between FPR2/ALX and FPR3 switched localization of the receptors from the plasma membrane to intracellular vesicles and vice versa. A clathrin-independent, possibly caveolae-dependent, mechanism was involved in FPR3 constitutive internalization. The peculiar behavior of FPR3 most probably serves distinct physiological functions that remain largely unknown.

The human formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) 2The abbreviations used are: FPRformyl peptide receptorsGPCRG protein-coupled receptorsEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinC5L2C5a receptor-like 2. are primarily myeloid cell receptors but are also expressed in nonmyeloid cells in multiple organs and tissues. In human, three genes encode three subtypes known as FPR1, FPR2/ALX, and FPR3 according to the recently recommended nomenclature (1Ye R.D. Boulay F. Wang J.M. Dahlgren C. Gerard C. Parmentier M. Serhan C.N. Murphy P.M. Pharmacol. Rev. 2009; 61: 119-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Formerly and most frequently in the literature, FPR1 was known as FPR, FPR2/ALX was referred to as FPRL1 (FPR-like receptor 1) or ALXR, and FPR3 was noted as FPRL2. Human FPRs belong to the G protein-coupled chemoattractant receptors, a subfamily of seven transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Evidence for an important role of FPRs both in infective and inflammatory processes is well documented in the literature. Multiple ligands, the majority of which are peptides, have been identified for the FPRs making them one of the most promiscuous receptor families (1Ye R.D. Boulay F. Wang J.M. Dahlgren C. Gerard C. Parmentier M. Serhan C.N. Murphy P.M. Pharmacol. Rev. 2009; 61: 119-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). N-Formyl peptides that are breakdown products of bacterial and mitochondrial proteins (2Rabiet M.J. Huet E. Boulay F. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 2486-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) are ligands common to the three receptors. A large number of microbe- or host-derived nonformylated peptides, as well as library-derived synthetic peptides have been described as potent agonists for FPR2/ALX. Among them, the hexapeptide WKYMVM (Trp-Lys-Tyr-Met-Val-Met-NH2) is a selective agonist of FPR2/ALX, whereas WKYMVm (Trp-Lys-Tyr-Met-Val-d-Met-NH2) was found to be a potent agonist of FPR2/ALX and FPR1, and a weaker activator of FPR3 (3Christophe T. Karlsson A. Dugave C. Rabiet M.J. Boulay F. Dahlgren C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21585-21593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). So far, FPR3 has only one high-affinity endogenous ligand known as F2L that promotes calcium mobilization and chemotaxis (4Migeotte I. Riboldi E. Franssen J.D. Grégoire F. Loison C. Wittamer V. Detheux M. Robberecht P. Costagliola S. Vassart G. Sozzani S. Parmentier M. Communi D. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). F2L is an acetylated amino-terminal peptide derived from the cleavage of the human heme-binding protein. formyl peptide receptors G protein-coupled receptors enhanced green fluorescent protein C5a receptor-like 2. The sequence identity between the three receptors is high and the activation of all three receptors triggers similar cellular responses involved in bactericidal functions such as superoxide production and release of granule constituents that cause tissue damage and killing of bacteria. Because excessive cellular responses may have harmful effects, a fine regulation of receptor activation must be maintained. After stimulation with the agonist, the cellular responses rapidly decline in intensity and cells become refractory to subsequent stimulation with the same agonist. This loss of responsiveness termed receptor desensitization is a common feature of GPCRs, which is believed to be the conjunction of receptor-G protein uncoupling and receptor removal from the cell surface through agonist-mediated receptor internalization. It is well established that most, if not all, GPCRs have cytoplasmic loci of phosphorylation. Following ligand binding, GPCRs adopt a conformation that catalyzes the activation of the G protein and become susceptible to interact with, and be phosphorylated by one of the G protein-coupled receptor kinases on serine/threonine residues located in the intracellular loops and the cytoplasmic carboxyl tail. This phosphorylation process promotes the high-affinity binding of β-arrestins to the receptor, thereby preventing further coupling to G proteins (5McDonald P.H. Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The β-arrestins target many GPCRs for internalization in clathrin-coated vesicles via a direct interaction of their carboxyl-terminal domain with both clathrin and the clathrin adaptor AP2 (6Goodman Jr., O.B.

The very high degree of amino acid identity between the sequences of the carboxyl-terminal tail of the three N-formyl peptide receptors (presented in Fig. 1A) suggests that they may share common mechanisms of regulation. However, in the case of FPR1, it has been shown that β-arrestins are dispensable for receptor internalization but phosphorylation is a prerequisite (8Vines C.M. Revankar C.M. Maestas D.C.

FPR1 phosphorylation is sufficient to inhibit interactions with the G-protein (9Bennett T.A. Foutz T.D. Gurevich V.V. Sklar L.A. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol.

Boulay F. Barral S. Rabiet M.J. Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 1939-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Upon agonist binding, FPR1 is phosphorylated on serines and threonines in the carboxyl tail (13Prossnitz E.R. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1130-1137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Eight of the 11 serines and threonines in the carboxyl tail of FPR1 have been found to be critical for FPR1 desensitization and internalization (14Maestes D.C. Potter R.M. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29791-29795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 15Potter R.M. Key T.A. Gurevich V.V. Sklar L.A. Prossnitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8970-8978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Likewise, FPR2/ALX is phosphorylated in an agonist-dependent manner but the sites that are phosphorylated or critical for phosphorylation have not yet been identified. Little is known as to the exact involvement of phosphorylation in FPR2/ALX desensitization and internalization. In contrast to FPR1 and FPR2/ALX, FPR3 displays a marked basal phosphorylation in the absence of agonist stimulation (3Christophe T. Karlsson A. Dugave C. Rabiet M.J. Boulay F. Dahlgren C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21585-21593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified the phosphoacceptor sites that are critical for agonist-mediated phosphorylation of FPR2/ALX by testing a series of serine/threonine to alanine replacement mutants for their ability to be phosphorylated in response to agonist binding. In addition, we determined the role of FPR2/ALX phosphorylation in receptor desensitization. By exchanging domains between FPR2/ALX and FPR3, we uncovered the determinants involved in basal phosphorylation of FPR3. A pattern of receptor distribution in small vesicles with an intracellular localization was observed by immunofluorescence in unstimulated FPR3-transfected cells. Experiments aimed at monitoring receptor-bound antibody uptake showed that the intracellular distribution of FPR3 results from a constitutive internalization. The amino acid sequence encompassing the N-terminal region and the first transmembrane domain (amino acids 1 to 53) contains the sequence determinants that govern the constitutive internalization and vesicular localization of FPR3. A clathrin-independent, possibly caveolae-mediated, pathway seemed to be involved in the constitutive internalization of FPR3. The serines and threonines present in the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of FPR2/ALX were grouped in three clusters, referred to as clusters A, B, or C, as illustrated in Fig. 1B. Serines and threonines were replaced by alanines in each cluster. Clusters were mutated alone or in combination. Mutant receptors were created by using the PCR strategy described by Yon and Fried (16Yon J. Fried M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Briefly, using FPR2/ALX in CDM8 as a template, two intermediary polymerase chain reaction fragments, PCR1 and PCR2, were generated with two couples of primers. PCR1 was produced with a sense primer located upstream from the start codon. The 5′-end of the primer contained an extension with an appropriate restriction site for further ligation in an expression vector, whereas the reverse primer carried the desired mutations. Likewise, PCR2 was created with a sense primer, which is complementary to the reverse primer used for the synthesis of PCR1, and a reverse primer, located downstream from the stop codon, with an appropriate restriction site. After purification, the two PCR fragments were mixed, denatured, and hybridized. The mixture was used to generate PCR3, which contains the entire sequence of the mutated FPR2/ALX. Ten cycles of amplification were first performed in the absence of primers to increase the number of copies of full-length cDNA carrying the mutations on both strands. Then, 35 cycles of amplification were carried out in the presence of the sense and reverse primers used to generate PCR1 and PCR2. PCR3 was cleaved with the appropriate restriction enzymes for ligation in pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) or pEF-neo (17Zhen L. King A.A. Xiao Y. Chanock S.J. Orkin S.H. Dinauer M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 9832-9836Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). For each mutant receptor, plasmid cDNA was prepared and the open reading frame was entirely sequenced. Chimeric receptors FPR3-R2 and FPR2-R3 were constructed by swapping the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of FPR3 for that of FPR2/ALX and conversely. The construction of the chimeras was greatly facilitated by the presence of a conserved PvuII restriction site located in the nucleotide sequence coding for the end of the seventh transmembrane domain. A chimeric receptor, in which the C-terminal domain was replaced by FPR2/ALX with all serines and threonines mutated into alanines, was constructed and referred to as FPR3-R2-ABC. The wild type forms of the 3HA-tagged FPR2/ALX and FPR3 were purchased from the UMR cDNA Resource Center, University of Missouri-Rolla. Taking advantage of the presence of a unique BspEI restriction site, a chimeric receptor, named 3HA-FPR2(1–53)-R3, was engineered that combined the N-terminal 3HA-tagged domain (amino acids 1 to 53) of FPR2/ALX with amino acids 54 to 353 of FPR3. The converse chimeric receptor, named 3HA-FPR3(1–53)-R2, was also constructed that combined the N-terminal 3HA-tagged domain (amino acids 1 to 53) of FPR3 with amino acids 54 to 351 of FPR2/ALX. HEK293 and HEK293T cells and HL60 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12/GlutaMAX I medium (HEK293 and HEK293T cells) or RPMI 1640 medium/GlutaMax I (HL60 cells) supplemented with 100 units/ml of penicillin, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. The maximal density of HL60 cells was maintained below 2 × 106 cells/ml and cells were centrifuged at each passage. Culture medium, serum, and antibiotics were obtained from Invitrogen. Lipofectamine 2000® (Invitrogen) was used for transient DNA transfections. HEK293 and HEK293T cells were grown to reach ∼80% confluence and transfections were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Wild type FPR2/ALX and phosphorylation-deficient mutant FPR2-ABC were stably expressed in undifferentiated HL60 cells. Transfection of HL60 cells was performed by electroporation with a gene pulser apparatus (Bio-Rad) as previously described (18Tardif M. Rabiet M.J. Christophe T. Milcent M.D. Boulay F. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6885-6895PubMed Google Scholar). Following electroporation, cells were allowed to recover in 20 ml of culture medium for 48 h prior to selection in medium containing 1 mg/ml of G418 (Geneticin, Invitrogen). G418-resistant clones were obtained by limited dilution into 24-well microtiter plates and receptor-expressing clones were identified for their ability to mobilize intracellular calcium upon addition of the WKYMVm peptide (100 nm final concentration). The hexapeptide WKYMVm was synthesized and HPLC purified by NeoSystem (Strasbourg, France). HEK293T cells were seeded in duplicate in Costar 6-well plates and transfected with wild type FPR2/ALX, mutated FPR2/ALX, FPR3, or chimeric receptors. One plate was used to determine the level of cell surface receptor expression, whereas the second plate was used to assess their ability to be phosphorylated after metabolic labeling with [32P]orthophosphoric acid (0.3–0.5 mCi/ml) as previously described (19Naik N. Giannini E. Brouchon L. Boulay F. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2381-2390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Receptor phosphorylation was initiated by the addition of WKYMVm (1 μm final concentration) or F2L peptide (1 μm final concentration). F2L peptide was obtained from AnyGen (Gwangju, Korea). After a 15-min stimulation, cells were lysed, and phosphorylated receptors were immunoprecipitated as previously described with affinity-purified rabbit IgGs directed against the last 10 residues (PPAETELQAM) of FPR2/ALX (3Christophe T. Karlsson A. Dugave C. Rabiet M.J. Boulay F. Dahlgren C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21585-21593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). These IgGs cross-react with the corresponding sequence (PPEETELQAM) in FPR3. 3HA-tagged receptors were immunoprecipited with a mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (12CA5, Roche Diagnostics). To analyze receptor phosphorylation, immunoprecipitates were treated with 2-fold Laemmli sample buffer under reducing conditions for 10 min at 50 °C and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The highly potent FPR2/ALX agonist WKYMVm was labeled with 125I as previously described (3Christophe T. Karlsson A. Dugave C. Rabiet M.J. Boulay F. Dahlgren C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21585-21593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). HEK293T cells expressing wild type or mutant forms of FPR2/ALX were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with increasing concentrations of 125I-labeled WKYMVm peptide in RPMI medium and 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) supplemented or not with an excess of nonradioactive peptide. Cells were washed three times with chilled phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 2 n NaOH, and bound radioactivity was recorded in a γ-counter. The results were expressed as the percentage of 125I-labeled peptide bound on wild type FPR2/ALX expressing cells. The Fura 2-based calcium mobilization assay in transfected HL60 cells was performed as previously described (20Dahlgren C. Christophe T. Boulay F. Madianos P.N. Rabiet M.J. Karlsson A. Blood. 2000; 95: 1810-1818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For desensitization of the calcium mobilization response, Fura 2-loaded cells were stimulated with or without 100 nm WKYMVm for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times at room temperature to remove the peptide, and subsequently assayed for calcium mobilization in response to different concentrations of WKYMVm. HL60 cells that stably expressed the wild type or nonphosphorylated forms of FPR2/ALX were stimulated with the hexapeptide WKYMVm (100 nm final concentration) in RPMI 1640 for various periods of time at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in 2-fold Laemmli sample buffer and briefly sonicated. Proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for Western blotting. Phosphorylated ERK1/2 were detected by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (E4) obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. Immunoblot analysis with polyclonal anti-ERK2 antibody (C14, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was performed to confirm that the same amounts of proteins were loaded. Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized after incubating the membrane with goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Phosphorylated ERK2 signals were quantified by densitometry using ImageJ software (National Institute of Health). HEK293 cells were plated into poly-d-lysine-coated 8-chamber glass bottomed LAB-TEK® (Nalge Nunc International, Hereford, UK). HEK293 cells were transiently transfected to express FPR2/ALX, FPR3, or chimeric receptors with Lipofectamine 2000® according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). In some experiments, the plasmid encoding 3HA-tagged FPR3 was co-transfected with a plasmid encoding β-arrestin 2 fused to EGFP, a plasmid encoding a dominant-negative mutant of dynamin (dynamin K44A), or a plasmid encoding the fragment 318–419 of β-arrestin 1 fused to EGFP. We described and used these plasmids in previous work (21Braun L. Christophe T. Boulay F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4277-4285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Two days after transfection, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS supplemented with 2% sucrose for 30 min at room temperature, quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl in RPMI 1640 for 15 min, and permeabilized with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 10 min. Fixed and permeabilized cells were incubated with blocking buffer (2% BSA in RPMI 1640) for 30 min at room temperature. The receptors were labeled for 1 h at room temperature with the polyclonal anti-FPR2 antibody or with the anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5) at 1 μg/ml when 3HA-tagged receptors were expressed. Cells were washed three times and incubated with green fluorescent Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody, or red fluorescent Alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing, cells were embedded in anti-quenching medium DABCO (2.3% 1,4-diazabicyclo(2,2,2)octane), 50% glycerol, 10% 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.02% NaN3. Fluorescence micrographs and layouts were performed using a Leica DMIRE2 inverse microscope equipped with a digital Leica DC350F camera using the QFluoro software (Leica Microsystems). HEK293 cells were transiently transfected to express 3HA-tagged receptors. Two days after transfection, cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, with the monoclonal mouse anti-HA antibody diluted at 1 μg/ml in pre-warmed RPMI, 2% BSA medium. As a control, cells were incubated for the same period of time in ice-cold RPMI, 2% BSA supplemented with monoclonal antibody. In some experiments, the transferrin receptor was tracked by adding transferrin Alexa Fluor 568 conjugate (15 μg/ml) 15 min after antibody uptake had been initiated. In another series of experiments, cells were simultaneously treated for 30 min at 37 °C with the monoclonal anti-HA antibody and filipin III (5 μg/ml) diluted in RPMI, 2% BSA medium. Cells were also co-transfected with the plasmid encoding 3HA-tagged FPR3 and a plasmid encoding a dominant-negative mutant of dynamin 1 (dynamin K44A) or a plasmid encoding the β-arrestin 1(318–418)-EGFP fusion. After being washed in RPMI medium, cells were immediately fixed, permeabilized, and treated for immunofluorescence as described in the previous section. Despite a high level of amino acid identity between FPR2/ALX and FPR3, especially in the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions (Fig. 1A), FPR3 is phosphorylated in the absence of agonist binding, whereas FPR2/ALX is not (3Christophe T. Karlsson A. Dugave C. Rabiet M.J. Boulay F. Dahlgren C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21585-21593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In this study, we compared the phosphorylation of each receptor induced by their respective high-affinity agonist. The hexapeptide WKYMVm displays a high affinity for FPR2/ALX and a low affinity for FPR3 (3Christophe T. Karlsson A. Dugave C. Rabiet M.J. Boulay F. Dahlgren C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21585-21593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The acetylated peptide F2L, an amino-terminal cleavage product of the human heme-binding protein, is the sole high-affinity ligand identified for FPR3 (4Migeotte I. Riboldi E. Franssen J.D. Grégoire F. Loison C. Wittamer V. Detheux M. Robberecht P. Costagliola S. Vassart G. Sozzani S. Parmentier M. Communi D. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 2 (left panel), the incorporation of 32P in FPR2/ALX was strictly dependent on the binding of WKYMVm. Even at a high concentration, F2L was unable to induce phosphorylation of FPR2/ALX. Compared with FPR2/ALX, FPR3 displayed a significant level of phosphorylation even in the absence of stimulation (Fig. 2, right panel, first lane). We thus confirmed the basal phosphorylation of FPR3. The binding of WKYMVm to FPR3 barely increased the incorporation of 32P in FPR3 (Fig. 2, right panel, second lane) even though it was previously shown to induce a robust calcium mobilization in FPR3 expressing HL60 cells (3Christophe T. Karlsson A. Dugave C. Rabiet M.J. Boulay F. Dahlgren C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21585-21593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, although F2L has been described as a high-affinity agonist for FPR3, it behaved as a weak inducer of FPR3 phosphorylation (Fig. 2, right panel, third lane). In preliminary experiments, phosphoamino acid analysis was used to determine the nature of the phosphoacceptor sites of FPR2/ALX as described previously (22Giannini E. Brouchon L. Boulay F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19166-19172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The phosphoamino acids resulting from acid hydrolysis of the 32P-labeled FPR2/ALX were resolved on thin layer cellulose plates by two-dimensional electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. The 32P-labeled FPR2/ALX contained phosphoserines and to a lesser extent phosphothreonines (data not shown). This correlated with the amino acid sequence, and the extent of FPR2/ALX labeling was proportional to the number of serine and threonine residues present in the C-terminal tail. To determine which serine and threonine residues were involved in agonist-mediated FPR2/ALX phosphorylation, a series of mutants were generated by changing one cluster of three Ser/Thr at a time (mutant A, B, and C in Fig. 1B). Four additional mutants were generated in which two of three clusters were mutated simultaneously (AB, AC, and BC mutants in Fig. 1B) or in which the three clusters have been mutated (mutant ABC in Fig. 1B). In this latter case, all serines and threonines were replaced by alanines, except Thr346, which is located in the antigenic epitope (PPAETELQAM) recognized by the rabbit polyclonal antibody. Judging from the binding of 125I-labeled WKYMVm (Fig. 3, A and B, left panel), wild type and mutant receptors exhibited similar levels of surface expression. The agonist-mediated phosphorylation of FPR2-B was markedly reduced, whereas the level of phosphorylation for both FPR2-A and FPR2-C remained comparable with that observed with the wild type receptor (Fig. 3A, right panel). Moreover, the alanine substitution in both clusters A and C yielded a mutant (FPR2-AC) that had conserved a significant capacity to incorporate 32P, indicating that the main phosphoacceptor sites are located in cluster B (Fig. 3B, right panel). As expected, mutants that associated mutations in cluster B and either cluster A or C (mutants FPR2-AB and FPR2-BC) exhibited a phosphorylation close to the background level (Fig. 3B, right panel). The replacement of all serines and threonines by alanines yielded a receptor (FPR2-ABC) unable to incorporate radioactive phosphate. The lack of phosphorylation of this mutant indicated that no other phosphorylation site within the intracellular loops was involved. Altogether, these results suggest that the phosphoacceptor sites within cluster B are essential for receptor phosphorylation, and that the agonist-mediated phosphorylation of FPR2/ALX proceeds in a hierarchical manner. Ligand binding to N-formyl peptide receptors induces the activation of a number of effectors triggering intracellular signaling pathways, thereby initiating cellular responses such as chemotaxis, superoxide production, and degranulation. Despite the persistent presence of chemoattractants, the intracellular signaling events elicited by chemoattractant receptors are transient. This attenuated responsiveness is thought to result from the desensitization of receptors through their phosphorylation and rapid sequestration. One would thus predict that the lack of phosphorylation of FPR2-ABC should result in prolonged intracellular signaling. To compare the functionality of wild type and nonphosphorylated forms of FPR2/ALX, we stably expressed each receptor in HL60 cells, a myeloid cell line of physiological relevance that does not express FPR2/ALX unless differentiated in neutrophil-like cells. The ability of wild type and mutant expressing cells to mobilize intracellular calcium after agonist stimulation was determined by monitoring calcium fluxes with Fura 2. As shown in Fig. 4A, mutant receptor triggered a calcium response"

Geminin regulates the cell cycle by directly binding and inhibiting the DNA replication licensing factor Cdt1. Geminin also interacts with transcriptional regulators of differentiation and chromatin remodelling factors, and its balanced interactions are implicated in proliferation-differentiation decisions during development. Here, we describe Idas (Idas being a cousin of the Gemini in Ancient Greek Mythology), a previously uncharacterised coiled-coil protein related to Geminin. We show that human Idas localizes to the nucleus, forms a complex with Geminin both in cells and in vitro through coiled-coil mediated interactions, and can change Geminin subcellular localization. Idas does not associate with Cdt1 and prevents Geminin from binding to Cdt1 in vitro. Idas depletion from cells affects cell cycle progression; cells accumulate in S phase and are unable to efficiently progress to mitosis. Idas protein levels decrease in anaphase, whereas its overexpression causes mitotic defects. During development, we show that Idas exhibits high level expression in the choroid plexus and the cortical hem of the mouse telencephalon.

Development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms depends on the generation of the appropriate number of cells through cell proliferation and the acquisition of specialized cell functions through cell differentiation. Geminin has been suggested to regulate proliferation-differentiation decisions through balanced interactions with the DNA replication licensing factor Cdt1 and factors regulating transcription during development (1Seo S. Kroll K.L. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 374-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Geminin, initially identified as a substrate of the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) ubiquitin ligase during mitosis (2McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W.

Geminin binding to Cdt1 during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle ensures that licensing of a further round of DNA replication is inhibited until the end of mitosis (6Blow J.J. Dutta A. Nat. Rev.

Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 4870-4877Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Geminin overexpression in human cell lines is also cell type-specific, leading to arrest at the G1/S phase transition or a defective S-phase followed by apoptosis (14Shreeram S. Sparks A. Lane D.P. Blow J.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6624-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Geminin was also identified as a putative regulator of differentiation, as its overexpression promoted the expansion of the neural plate in Xenopus embryos (15Kroll K.L. Salic A.N. Evans L.M. Kirschner M.W. Development. 1998; 125: 3247-3258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Geminin was shown to interact with transcriptional regulators of differentiation, such as Six3 (16Del Bene F.

Geminin balanced interactions with its multiple binding partners are central to its function in the coordination of proliferation and differentiation. The central region of Geminin, containing the Geminin coiled-coil, is sufficient for interactions with Cdt1 and inhibition of licensing and mediates homodimerization of Geminin (20Lee C. Hong B.

In this study we introduce a previously uncharacterized human protein that is similar to Geminin in its central coiled-coil region. We name this protein Idas (Idas being a cousin of the Gemini in Ancient Greek Mythology). We show that Idas binds to the Geminin coiled-coil region and can modulate Geminin ability to bind Cdt1. Our data highlight Idas as a novel Geminin binding partner and regulator. Tblastn (NCBI) was used to search expressed sequences from the human genome using the hGeminin protein sequence as query. mRNAs deriving from 5q11.2, on chromosome 5, were identified as encoding a protein with significant similarity to Geminin. This region is currently annotated as LOC345643. Gene2EST was used to identify Expressed Sequence Tags from this locus. The expression of LOC345643 is supported by 1 full-length cDNA (clone CS0DK002YL21) and 10 Expressed Sequence Tags that represent sequence reads from 5 cDNAs from HeLa cells (clone CS0DK002YL21), Jurkat cells (clone CS0DJ001YB09), melanotic melanoma (clone IMAGE:3916292) and mammary adenocarcinoma cell lines (clone IMAGE:5406358), and pooled primary tissues. (DR007866.1). Alignment of available Expressed Sequence Tags and cDNA sequences was used to generate a predicted mRNA of 2087 nucleotides. This is longer than the automatically predicted mRNA present in the databases (Locus XR_040412, 1158 nucleotides) because of the presence of 5′-UTR (178 nucleotides) and 3′-UTR (929 nucleotides) sequences. The intron-exon boundaries were defined by aligning the predicted mRNA to human genomic sequences. Fragments of the predicted mRNA were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequenced to verify expression of this locus in HeLa cells. Real time PCR was used to detect expression of Idas in different human cell lines. The full predicted open reading frame (ORF) was amplified from HeLa cDNA and sequenced. The hIdas protein sequence was derived from the ORF. Idas orthologues in mouse (LOC622408) and Xenopus laevis (LOC100158359) were identified by Blast using the human Idas protein sequence as query. For sequence analysis and alignments, the following programs were used: Gene2EST (24Gemünd C. Ramu C. Altenberg-Greulich B. Gibson T.J.

Total HeLa cDNA was used to amplify the hIdas ORF by nested PCR, introducing NheI and KpnI sites at the ends of the predicted hIdas ORF. The PCR product was cloned into the mammalian expression vector cDNA3.1EGFP (Invitrogen) at the NheI and KpnI restriction sites to produce a protein C-terminally fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the constitutive CMV promoter. N-Idas (amino acids 1–127) and C-Idas (amino acids 131–385) were cloned into the NheI and HindIII sites of pcDNA3.1EGFP (Invitrogen) after PCR amplification from full-length Idas to introduce restriction sites. IdasHA and Idas-Cherry were generated by replacing GFP from the IdasGFP pcDNA3.1 construct with three repeats of the human influenza hemagglutinin epitope (HA) and sequences coding for Cherry (Clontech), respectively. All products produced by PCR were fully sequenced. For in vitro experiments, the predicted folded domain (101–284, dIdas) and the coiled-coil domain (173–245, tIdas) were cloned for expression in the NKI-His-3C-LIC (for cleavable His-tag expression) and the NKI-LIC plasmids (for native versions). Because these plasmids are resistant to kanamycin and ampicillin, respectively, they allow for efficient co-expression experiments. The Idas sequence was analyzed using the ProteinCCD server (28Mooij W.T. Mitsiki E. Perrakis A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: W402-W405Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which was also used for the automated design of oligonucleotides suitable for PCR-based restriction and ligase-free cloning to the NKI-LIC vectors. A construct expressing full-length Geminin was cloned in the pET22b vector from Novagen. A construct for expressing human Cdt1 harboring residues (158–396, mini-Cdt1) was cloned in the pET28a vector (Novagen) with an N-terminal His tag. For antibody production, N-Idas was cloned into the NheI and HindIII sites of pET28a vector (Novagen) with the N-terminal His tag using PCR amplification to introduce sites. A mouse Idas cDNA (IMAGE: 5830438-C23) in vector pFLCI was obtained (Geneservice Ltd). A vector suitable for generation of antisense probes for in situ hybridization was constructed by removing the 3′-untranslated region of the cDNA using an internal KpnI site. A second vector for in situ hybridization was generated by subcloning the mIdas open reading frame to pBluescript between SacI and KpnI sites.

Idas mRNA expression levels were assessed by quantitative real time PCR (LightCycler 02, Roche Applied Science) using the QuantiFast SYBR Green PCR kit (204052, Qiagen). The primer sequences for Idas are 5′-GACGCGCTTGTTGAGAATAA-3′ and 5′-CACGTTCCGCTCCTTGAG-3′. Total mRNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (74104,Qiagen), and 800 ng of total RNA were converted to cDNA using Superscript II (18064-014, Invitrogen). A final dilution of 1:5 from the resulting cDNA was amplified for 40 cycles. All samples were normalized to the YWHAZ (tryptophan S-monooxygenase activation protein, ζ polypeptide) gene. The primer sequences for YWHAZ gene amplification are 5′-GATCCCCAATGCTTCACAAG-3′ and 5′-TGCTTGTTGTGACTGATCGAC-3′. HeLa and 293T cells were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). MCF7 cells were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen) with 20% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). MCF7 (1–3 × 105 cells) were transfected with a total of 1 μg of plasmid DNA using Genejammer (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions, and cells were analyzed 22 h post-transfection. 293T cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate method. For the construction of stable cell lines expressing IdasGFP, HeLa cells were transfected with IdasGFP vector using Genejammer (Stratagene) and grown in the presence of Geneticin (500 μg/ml, 10131-019, Invitrogen). Resistant colonies were selected, screened for expression, and amplified. For RNAi experiments, the following STEALTH (Invitrogen) siRNAs were used for Idas: 5′-CCACCAAACGGAAGCAGACTTCAAT-3′ and 5′-GAGACGCGCTTGTTGAGAATAATCA-3′. The negative control was 5′-CCAAACAGGAACGGACATTCCCAAT-3′. For Idas silencing, HeLa cells were treated with 50 nm concentrations of each Idas siRNA or 100 nm control siRNA twice (at 0 and 24 h) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and were analyzed 24 h after the second transfection. For mitotic synchronization, HeLa cells and 293T cells were incubated with nocodazole (50 ng/ml, Sigma) for 16 h. When synchronization was combined with transient transfection in HeLa or 293T cells, nocodazole was added 5 or 18 h after transfection, respectively. Cells grown on poly-lysine-covered coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin and 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS (blocking solution) for 1 h. Coverslips were incubated with primary antibody in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed with PBS, 0.1% Tween and incubated for 1 h with the following secondary antibodies in blocking solution: Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (A11034, Molecular Probes) and Alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse (A11004, Molecular Probes). After washing, DNA was stained with DAPI or Hoechst. For double immunostaining with BrdU, cells were first immunostained for Geminin or Cdt1 as above, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and washed twice with PBS, 0.1% Tween followed by 1 h of incubation with 2 n HCl, washing with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, and 1 h of blocking. Coverslips were incubated with anti-BrdU (1:80) (Oxford Biotechnology, OBT 00305) in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C, washed with PBS, 0.1% Tween, and incubated for 1 h with Alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-rat (A11077, Molecular Probes) secondary antibody in blocking solution.

All animal-related procedures conformed to the international guidelines on the ethical use of animals. Images were recorded on a Nikon Eclipse TE 2000-U inverted microscope using 60×/1.40 oil and 40×/0.75 lenses. MCF7 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids and collected 22 h post-transfection. For immunoprecipitation of the endogenous proteins, total cell extracts were collected from HeLa cells.

Vectors were transformed to Rosetta-2 cells (Novagen) and grown in the presence of a suitable antibiotic. For co-expression experiments, Idas plasmids were simultaneously transformed together with Geminin plasmids (23De Marco V. Gillespie P.J. Li A. Karantzelis N. Christodoulou E.

Protein production was induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 15 °C at an optical density of ∼0.8, and cells were left to grow for an additional 16–18 h at 15 °C. Cell pellets were obtained by centrifugation at 4000 rpm and lysed by sonication in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol (buffer A) plus a tablet of Complete, EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C. After clearing the supernatant by centrifugation, the proteins were bound in a His-trap column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with a linear gradient of buffer A containing 20–500 mm imidazole. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and pure fractions were pooled. Yields were between 5–10 mg/liter of culture depending on the construct. All proteins were more than 95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). All Idas-Geminin co-expression experiments were done with immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography purification mediated by the N-terminal histidine tag on Idas; in all purified complexes, stoichiometric amounts of Geminin were co-purified with Idas. All His tags were cleaved with 3C-protease before the characterization experiments. We were unable to obtain full-length Idas or its complexes in a soluble form suitable for biophysical experiments. dIdas and N-Idas recombinant proteins were used for rabbit immunizations (Harlan Sera-Lab) to generate antibodies hIdasAb1 and hIdasAb2, respectively. Crude sera were affinity-purified against the recombinant protein used for immunization. The specificity of the affinity purified antibodies were tested by Western blot analysis and shown to specifically recognize the hIdas protein in HeLa cells. Experiments were performed in a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column attached to an Akta FPLC and coupled to a miniDAWN light scattering detector (Wyatt Technology) and a Dn-1000 differential refractive index detector (WGE Dr. Bures). 100 μl of purified tIdas at a concentration of 0.3 mg/ml were injected to the column. Data analysis was carried out with the program Astra using a differential index of refraction value of 0.185. Surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy was preformed at 25 °C on a Biacore T100. About 6000 relative units of mini-Cdt1 and mini-Cdt1 Y170A were immobilized on a CM5 Chip (Biacore) at pH 5.5 using amino coupling of lysine residues. Concentrations series of all described Geminin and Idas variants and their complexes were injected across the chip in a buffer of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, Tween 20 0.01% at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. The concentrations used were: 68, 200, 610, 1830, and 5500 nm for dIdas; 50, 151, 456, 1370, and 4100 nm for tIdas; 6, 19, 57, 170, 511, 1530, and 4600 nm for Geminin-dIdas; 13, 38, 113, 340, 102, 3060, and 9200 nm for Geminin-tIdas; 12, 36, 107, 322, and 967 nm for Geminin. Binding curves were recorded for each protein using the empty flow cell as reference. All experiments were repeated at least two times in a non-sequential manner to exclude systematic errors. The Biacore T100 evaluation software was used for the initial data analysis. All binding curves are shown in supplemental Fig. 2. We searched human databases for Geminin homologues and identified the gene product of LOC345643, on chromosome 5q11.2, as being similar to Geminin in its central coiled-coil region. We named this gene Idas. Idas has 7 exons (supplemental Fig. 1A) and codes for a previously uncharacterized protein of 385 amino acids containing a putative coiled-coil region. Idas orthologues can be detected in different vertebrates. A multiple sequence alignment of Geminin orthologues with Idas orthologues from human, mouse, and Xenopus is shown in Fig. 1A. Geminin and Idas exhibit low overall similarity but significant conservation in their central coiled-coil regions, where the human Idas and Geminin proteins share 53% identity (Fig. 1A, black box). The central region of Geminin, which is conserved in Idas, mediates Geminin homodimerization and binding to Cdt1 (20Lee C. Hong B. Choi J.M. Kim Y. Watanabe S. Ishimi Y. Enomoto T. Tada S. Kim Y.

The Geminin coiled-coil has unique properties, with three polar residues in a and d positions of the heptad repeats, which are also present in Idas (Fig. 1A, arrowheads), suggesting that Idas may both homodimerize and heterodimerize with Geminin.

Kinase domain structures of two other VRK family members (VRK2 and VRK3) have been determined previously. However, the structure of VRK1, the most extensively studied and constitutively active VRK member, is yet to be characterized. Here, we present the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) solution structure of a catalytically active form of human VRK1 with its extended C-terminal tail (residues 1–361). The NMR structure of human VRK1 reveals that the C-terminal tail orients toward the catalytic site and forms a number of interactions that are critical for structural stability and catalysis. The role of this unique C-terminal tail was further investigated by deletion mutant studies where deletion of the terminal tail resulted in a dramatic reduction in the autocatalytic activity of VRK1. NMR titration studies carried out with ATP or an ATP analog confirm that ATP/ATP analogs interact with all of the crucial residues present in important motifs of the protein kinase such as the hinge region, catalytic loop, DYG motif, and thereby suggest that the catalytic domain of VRK1 is not atypical. In addition to the conventional interactions, some of the residues present on the extended C-terminal tail also interact with the ligands. These observations also substantiate the role of the extended C-terminal tail in the biological activity of VRK1.

Three members of VRK family are known in the human genome and show a significant sequence similarity among themselves with respect to their catalytic domains, but differ in their regulatory domains (8Nichols R.J.

VRK1 is the most well studied member of the family, known to participate in a number of biological activities especially in cellular proliferations as well as in management of cellular stress situations (11Klerkx E.P.

The catalytic domain structures of VRK2 and VRK3 reveal the typical kinase fold but with a degraded catalytic site on VRK3 (22Scheeff E.D. Eswaran J. Bunkoczi G. Knapp S. Manning G. Structure. 2009; 17: 128-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). It is noted that the catalytic domains of VRKs are flanked by the large noncatalytic regions either at N or C termini. VRK1 contains a C-terminal noncatalytic tail but is constitutively active. Currently, the underlying molecular mechanism of VRK1 activation is unknown. In this report, we present NMR solution structures of a catalytically active form of human VRK1 with the C-terminal noncatalytic fragment flanking the kinase domain, and we propose a molecular basis underlying the activation mechanism of VRK1. The complementary DNAs (cDNAs) encoding the full-length human VRK1 and the C-terminal truncation mutants (VRK11–391, VRK11–381, VRK11–371, VRK11–361, VRK11–351, VRK11–341, VRK11–331) were PCR-amplified using the corresponding forward and reverse primers containing NdeI and XhoI restriction enzyme cleavage sites. The resultant amplified products were gel-purified, digested using the restriction enzymes, and cloned into pET-29b plasmid (Novagen). For the protein purification, cells were grown in M9 medium containing 15NH4Cl, 15NH4Cl plus [U-13C]glucose, and 75% or 100% 2H2O at 37 °C at 220 rpm until the culture optical density reached an absorbance of 0.7 at 600 nm. The culture was then induced with 1 mm isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 25 °C for 4 h. After the cultured cells were harvested by centrifugation, the cell pellet was resuspended in a lysis buffer (20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonate, lysed by sonication, and purified on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Invitrogen). The eluted proteins from the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column were analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. The fractions containing VRK1 were collected, concentrated, and further purified on a Superdex S-200 column (GE Healthcare) preequilibrated with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.01% NaN3. The purified proteins were verified by mass spectroscopy at Nanyang Technological University Proteomics Core Facility. Samples for NMR experiments contained 0.3–0.6 mm protein in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2 mm DTT, 0.01% NaN3, and 10% or 100% D2O. For backbone assignments, transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy (TROSY)-based HNCACB, HN(CO)CACB, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCO, and HN(CA)CO spectra were obtained using 100% fully deuterated and uniformly 13C/15N-labeled VRK1 (23Pervushin K. Riek R. Wider G. Wüthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 12366-12371Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar). For side chain resonance assignments, TROSY-based 15N-edited NOESY, HCCH TOCSY, and 13C-edited NOESY experiments using fully or 75% perdeuterated protein samples were performed. Selectively labeled NMR samples on 13C/15N-labeled valine/isoleucine/leucine residues were prepared, and HCCH TOCSY and 13C-edited NOESY experiments were performed for assignments of side chain methyl resonances and deriving methyl-methyl or methyl side chain distance constraints. NMR experiments were performed on Bruker Avance 700, 800, and 900-MHz spectrometers equipped with a 5-mm triple resonance, z axis-gradient cryogenic probe at 298 K. A list of the NMR experiments is shown in supplemental Table 1. All spectra were processed with NMRPipe (24Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar) and analyzed using SPARKY (25Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY. University of California, San Francisco, CA2007Google Scholar). The assigned chemical shift values of VRK1 have been deposited in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank (accession code 16738). Residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) were measured using polyethylene glycol/alcohol mixtures (26Ruckert M. Otting G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 7793-7797Crossref Scopus (541) Google Scholar). 50 μl of C12E5 was mixed in 530 μl of NMR buffer containing 90% H2O and 10% D2O for stock solution preparation. 1-Hexanol was gradually added by 2-μl increments with vigorous shaking to a final molar C12E5:1-hexanol ratio of 0.96. After 1 h at room temperature, air bubbles were removed by centrifugation at 5000 × g for several minutes. For the measurement of RDCs, 300 μl of the C12E5:1-hexanol stock solution was added to 200 μl of protein. The final concentration of C12E5:1-hexanol mixture in the NMR sample was about 5% (w/w). 15N-1H RDC constants were measured using combination of 1H-15N HSQC and 1H-15N TROSY-HSQC experiments at 25 °C as described previously (27Lukin J.A. Kontaxis G. Simplaceanu V. Yuan Y. Bax A. Ho C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 517-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The data analysis and calculation of alignment tensor were performed using REDCAT software (28Valafar H. Prestegard J.H. J. Mag. Reson. 2004; 167: 228-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) (see supplemental Fig. S6). Molecular characteristics of ATP/ATP analog binding with VRK1 were studied using two-dimensional TROSY-HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled VRK1 recorded on a Bruker Avance 700 spectrometer at 298 K, and the ligand binding sites were mapped by analyzing chemical shift perturbations. Initially, the NMR spectra of free sample was recorded using 0.1 mm 15N-labeled VRK11–316. The ligands were then added to the sample, and chemical shifts were compared before and after the addition of the ligand. Solution structures of VRK1 were calculated by simulated annealing in torsion angle space with combination of the program CYANA 2.1 (29Güntert P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 353-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar) and CNS 1.2 (30Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

Protoc. 2007; 2: 2728-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar). Distance constraints were derived by analyzing TROSY-based 1H-15N NOESY (80-ms mixing time) and 13C-edited NOESY (100-ms mixing time) spectra of 50% random fractional deuterated or selective labeled (valine, isoleucine, and leucine residues) samples of VRK1. The secondary structure was predicted by program TALOS+ (32Shen Y. Delaglio F. Cornilescu G. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2009; 44: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (2036) Google Scholar) based on the analysis about sequential (|i-j| = 1), short range (|i-j|<5) NH-NH and NH-aliphatic contacts on 15N TROSY-NOESY spectrum. Dihedral angle (ϕ, ψ) restraints were also calculated from chemical shifts using TALOS+, and hydrogen bond restraints were obtained based on protein structure during structure calculations. Manually assigned NOE constraints were classified based on their intensities and applied with upper distance limit of 3.0 Å (strong), 3.5 Å (medium), 5.0 Å (weak), 6.0 Å (very weak), and total 200 conformers were generated as initial structures by CYANA 2.1 from 5193 NOE constraints. An additional 0.5 Å was added for NOEs involving methyl groups. After calculation, initial conformers were sorted by target function values, and the lowest 100 conformers were selected for further refinement using CNS 1.2. 292 backbone hydrogen bonds were identified on the basis of initial structures, and 457 torsion angle constraints derived from chemical shift values with the program TALOS+ were applied in refinement stage. Also, 234 15N-1H residual dipolar coupling restraints were included in the final stage of calculation. The final structure was refined by using a simulated annealing protocol with combination of torsion angle space and Cartesian coordinate dynamics as published previously (33Mueller G.A. Choy W.Y. Yang D. Forman-Kay J.D. Venters R.A. Kay L.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 197-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Finally, 20 structures were selected by their total energy values for display and structural analysis. MOLMOL (34Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (29-32): 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar) and PyMOL (35DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, Palo Alto, CA2002Google Scholar) programs were used for structure visualization. The 20 NMR ensemble structures have been deposited in Protein Data Bank (PDB) with code 2LAV. The wild-type human VRK1 and its C-terminal truncation mutants were evaluated for their autophosphorylation activity according to the protocol described previously (36Barcia R. López-Borges S. Vega F.M. Lazo P.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 399: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μg of the recombinant proteins were placed in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 5 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction mixture was then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The protein mixtures were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. The gels were then exposed to x-ray film overnight and developed using X-OMAT2000 (Kodak). The structural studies were performed on a catalytically active form of human VRK1 (residues 1–361) lacking 35 residues at C terminus. The structures were determined based on a total of 5193 nontrivial NMR-derived distance restraints and 234 15N-1H RDC restraints, which were included in the final step of structure calculation. The ensemble of 20 low energy structures calculated with CNS is shown in Fig. 1A. Excluding the N-terminal 20 residues and C-terminal 6 residues, the average root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) values relative to the mean coordinate of 20 conformers were 1.24 Å for the backbone atoms and 1.95 Å for all heavy atoms. Structural statistics for the NMR ensemble are given in Table 1. There are no distance violations greater than 0.5 Å or dihedral angle violations greater than 5°. Analysis of the average minimized structures with PROCHECK-NMR (37Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol.

Open table in a new tab The NMR structures of VRK1 reveal the well defined typical kinase fold. The overall fold of the kinase domain of VRK1 is similar to two other VRK kinase members (VRK2 and VRK3) adopting a bilobate structure (Fig. 1). The N-terminal tail (residues 1–20) is unstructured in solution as evidenced by the lack of medium and long range nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) in this region. The characteristic additional helix (αC4) is inserted between αC and β4 as predicted. The last helix in the C-terminal lobe (αI) of VRK1 (316–331) is more extended compared with VRK2 and stabilizes the entire protein conformation by forming hydrophobic spines with side chains of aliphatic and aromatic residues present in the protein core (Fig. 1B). Most notable and unique feature of the VRK1 solution structure is that the C-terminal tail (residues 341–361) orients around the catalytic site and forms a number of interactions with several important motifs such as G-loop, αC, the catalytic and activation loops (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S1). The C-terminal tail of VRK1 shows a high degree of sequence conservation across species (8Nichols R.J. Traktman P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7934-7946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), suggesting its potential regulatory role. The VRK1 NMR structures reveal that Ile354 interacts with Pro79 of αC, and the residues of αD helix (Leu138 and Ile141) also form hydrophobic interactions with Leu341 and Val343 of the extra C-terminal tail (Fig. 2A). The residue Leu349 at the C-terminal tail forms a hydrophobic interaction with Phe48 of the G-loop. We have investigated the role of the C-terminal tail on VRK1 stability and catalysis by performing chemical shift perturbation experiments on the uniformly 15N-labeled VRK11–361, which was used in our NMR structure determination and VRK11–341 construct where residues 342–361 were truncated. The two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra of VRK11–361 and VRK11–341 showed noticeable chemical shift perturbations on some of the residues in the activation (Ala201, Tyr202) and catalytic loops (Glu172, Val174, Lys179, Ser181) after the removal of the C-terminal 20 residue extension (Fig. 2E and supplemental Fig. S2). In addition, the residues from αD (Leu138–Lys140, Glu143) and the loop connecting αD and αE (Ala146, Lys147, Phe149, and Ser150) and residues in β9 (Asp191–Val196) showed chemical shift perturbations, suggesting a potential regulatory role by the C-terminal tail. Long range NOEs were observed between methyl protons and residues on the αD helix and C-terminal extension residues such as Leu341, Val343, and Val344 (Fig. 2C). Our NMR structure reveals that Ala201 and Tyr202 are located near Thr353, Ile354, Thr355, and Lys356. This is also directly supported by the presence of long range NOEs between the ring protons of Tyr202 and Thr353/Thr355 (Fig. 2D). Fig. 2B shows the mapping of the interacting residues. These results suggest the molecular basis of VRK1 activation which requires the molecular interaction between the C-terminal tail and catalytic core of the enzyme. Thus, to delineate further the potential activation mechanism of VRK1, we constructed a series of truncation mutants of VRK1 and examined their characteristics (Fig. 3). Truncation of 75 residues from the C terminus (VRK11–321) causes the mutant VRK1 to become insoluble when expressed in bacterial cells (data not shown). Interestingly, VRK11–331 is soluble but inactive. VRK11–351 and VRK11–341, which lack the C-terminal 45 and 55 residues, respectively, are soluble but show marginal kinase activities. We also evaluated the VRK1 catalytic activity by designing multiple point mutations in the C-terminal tail region. Our data showed that S342A and T353A mutants reduce the autocatalytic activities of VRK1, indicating that those residues play key roles in the kinase activity (supplemental Fig. S3). Taken together, these data suggest that the C-terminal region (residues 321–361) is important for VRK1 physical property as well as its catalysis (Fig. 3) and also support the hypothesis that the C-terminal tail of VRK1 interacts with the catalytic core of the enzyme and plays essential roles for VRK1 activation.FIGURE 3Comparison of autophosphorylation activity of the wild-type and C-terminal truncation mutants of human VRK1. A, the wild-type human VRK1 and C-terminal truncated VRK1 mutants have been purified as described under “Experimental Procedures” and subjected to autocatalytic reactions.

Despite the similarity in their structures, they exhibit differences in their local structures. VRK1 is an active member of the VRK family, which encompasses all of the required features/motifs for kinase activity like VRK2. Previous crystallographic studies revealed that VRK3 is having a pseudo-kinase domain with no catalytic ability, unlike VRK1 and VRK2 (22Scheeff E.D. Eswaran J. Bunkoczi G. Knapp S. Manning G. Structure. 2009; 17: 128-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In the NMR structure of VRK1, αC is rotated inward, a key ion pair between Lys71 and Glu83 is formed, and the DYG motif (DFG in several other kinases) orients like VRK2 and other active kinases (Fig. 4A). The activation loop of VRK1 superimposed well on VRK2, and conserved threonine residues (Thr224 and Thr228) also oriented similarly to VRK2 (Fig. 4C). The αC4 helix, which is unique in all VRK family members, is also observed in VRK1 and contains the conserved residues Ile96, Trp99 forming a hydrophobic interaction with Tyr167 in αE, which is similar to what is seen in VRK2 and VRK3 (supplemental Fig. S4). Recently, the VRK1 crystal structure was deposited in the PDB with ID code 3OP5. The crystal structure consists of several mutations in key charged residues and lacking the electron densities for the C-terminal extension (342–361). Despite the similarity in the overall topology of the kinase domain between our VRK1 NMR structure and the VRK1 crystal structure, several key differences are observed. The distance between ion pairing atoms of Lys71 and Glu83 is a bit longer in the VRK1 crystal structure than VRK2 and our NMR VRK1 structures. The distance between N∈ of the lysine and nearest oxygen of carboxyl group present on the glutamate is 2.7, 2.6, and 4.4 Å in the VRK2, VRK1 NMR structure, and VRK1 crystal structure, respectively (Fig. 4, A and B). Another notable difference is also observed in the activation loop. The center of the activation loop of the VRK1 crystal structure is swung by approximately 8–10 Å compared with VRK2 (Cα atom distance between Lys218 and Arg207 of aligned VRK1 and VRK2, respectively). This difference could be attributable to either several mutations of charged residues (E212A, K214A, and E215A) to alanine in VRK1 crystal structure or might be due to crystal packing with the other chains in the tetramer structure of VRK1 crystal structure (Fig. 4D). The present VRK1 NMR structure was also compared with other kinases with extended C-terminal regulatory tails. Aurora B with INCENP, AMP-activated protein kinase α-subunit with autoinhibitory domain (KD-AID) and p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70S6K) crystal structures (PDB ID codes 2BFY, 3H4J, and 3A60, respectively) were employed for comparison purposes (38Sessa F.

The C-terminal tail of Aurora B interacts with INCENP and N-lobe of the kinase domain triggering conformational changes in the αC position. This results in an impairment of the key ion pairing between lysine and glutamate residues, leading to the inactivation of the kinase activity (38Sessa F. Mapelli M. Ciferri C. Tarricone C.

In the case of KD-AID, the C-terminal autoinhibitory tail interacts with the N- and C-terminal lobes of the kinase domain from the backside to the hinge region and constrains the mobility of αC helix (39Sunami T. Byrne N. Diehl R.E. Funabashi K. Hall D.L. Ikuta M. Patel S.B. Shipman J.M. Smith R.F. Takahashi I. Zugay-Murphy J. Iwasawa Y. Lumb K.J. Munshi S.K. Sharma S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 4587-4594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The autoinhibitory mechanism of p70S6K is not yet clearly established by structural studies. Comparison of VRK1 with these three structures reveals notable differences in the αI helix orientation. In VRK1, αI is relatively straight and long compared with other three kinases and even VRK2. All aforementioned kinases posses a kink in αI which leads the C-terminal tail toward the N-terminal lobe or backside of the hinge region (supplemental Fig. S5, A–C). Another important observation made by comparing the sequences of αI is that all three kinases possess a proline residue at the start of the kink, which is replaced by a glutamine residue in VRK1 (supplemental Fig. S5D). Moreover, a unique feature of the VRK family structures is the presence of αC4, an additional helix inserted between αC and β4. Although the specific role of αC4 is not clear at this moment, we speculate that it may help the proper orientation of C-terminal tail in VRK1. Superimposition of VRK1 and KD-AID reveals that the autoinhibitory C-terminal tail of KD-AID occupies the position of VRK1 αC4 (supplemental Fig. S5C). These differences could be critical to divert the C-terminal tail toward other side of the kinase domain. We have tested the substrate binding properties of VRK1 by performing two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC titration with AMP-PCP, an ATP analog (Fig. 5A). The backbone amides around the ATP binding pocket residues (Ile43, Gly46, Gly49, Val70, Lys71, Val72, and Glu73) displayed the largest chemical shift changes (Fig. 5, B and C, Δδ > 0.5). Residues Gln45, Gly47, and Val69, Leu80, Glu83, and Leu84 also showed relatively big chemical shift perturbations (Fig. 5, B and C, 0.3 < Δδ < 0.5). These residues are located on the G-loop and β3 and αC. NMR signals of Asp132, Arg133, and Phe134 belonging to the DRF motif or hinge region disappeared, and a chemical shift of Gly135 also dramatically shifted (Δδ = 0.6), indicating that these residues plays an important role during catalysis by interacting with adenosine moiety of ATP molecule. Other spectral changes upon addition of the ATP analog were observed in residues on the DYG motif (Asp197, Tyr198, and Gly199), which interact with the γ-phosphate group of AMP-PCP. NMR signals of Asp197 also completely disappeared in the same manner as that observed in residues on DRF motif. Tyr198 and Gly199 show intermediate chemical shift perturbation (Δδ ∼0.3). The chemical shift perturbation data are consistent with the expected ATP binding site. Moreover, changes were observed in residues Leu339, Asp340, Leu341, and Ser342, which interact with the catalytic core, especially the αD helix. Interestingly, Thr355 and Lys356 at the C-terminal extension showed chemical shift perturbations, indicating that these residues, especially Thr355, could be related to the ligand binding process. Because Thr355 is considered as a potential autophosphorylation site located nearby catalytic and activation loop, it may be important for autocatalytic reaction of VRK1. Taken together, these data suggest that VRK1 may undergo a structural rearrangement induced by ligand binding and cause the changes of dynamic properties of these residues. In conclusion, we report the first NMR solution structure of a catalytically active form of human VRK1 which provides insights into the role of the extended C-terminal tail on its bioactivity. The noncatalytic C-terminal domain of VRK1 (residues 341–361) forms a number of crucial interactions with the catalytic domain, which is critical for structural stability and catalysis. Deletion mutant experiments and their NMR titration analyses also substantiated these observations. We thank Michael Sattler for helpful discussion and a critical review of the manuscript.

It dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate upon membrane depolarization. The cytoplasmic region is composed of a phosphatase domain and a putative membrane interaction domain, C2. Here we determined the crystal structures of the Ci-VSP cytoplasmic region in three distinct constructs, wild-type (248–576), wild-type (236–576), and G365A mutant (248–576). The crystal structure of WT-236 and G365A-248 had the disulfide bond between the catalytic residue Cys-363 and the adjacent residue Cys-310. On the other hand, the disulfide bond was not present in the crystal structure of WT-248. These suggest the possibility that Ci-VSP is regulated by reactive oxygen species as found in PTEN. These structures also revealed that the conformation of the TI loop in the active site of the Ci-VSP cytoplasmic region was distinct from the corresponding region of PTEN; Ci-VSP has glutamic acid (Glu-411) in the TI loop, orienting toward the center of active site pocket. Mutation of Glu-411 led to acquirement of increased activity toward phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate, suggesting that this site is required for determining substrate specificity.

Despite numerous studies, the role of separate domains of TLR4 in the regulation of receptor activation is poorly understood. Replacement of the TLR4 ectodomain with LPS-binding proteins MD-2 or CD14 resulted in a robust ligand-independent constitutive activation comparable with the maximal stimulation of the receptor with LPS. The same effect was achieved by the replacement of the ectodomain with a monomeric fluorescent protein or a 24-kDa gyrase B fragment. This demonstrates an intrinsic dimerization propensity of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of TLR4 and reveals a previously unknown function of the ectodomain in inhibiting spontaneous receptor dimerization. Constitutive activation was abolished by the replacement of the ectodomain by a bulkier protein ovalbumin. N-terminal deletion variants of TLR4 revealed that the smallest segment of the ectodomain that already prevents constitutive activity comprises only 90 residues (542 to 631) of the total 608 residues. We conclude that TLR4 represents a receptor with a low threshold of activation that can be rapidly activated by the release of inhibition exerted by its ectodomain. This is important for the sensitivity of TLR4 to activation by different agonists.

https://openalex.org/W2004510609,"Prodiginines are a class of red-pigmented natural products with immunosuppressant, anticancer, and antimalarial activities. Recent studies on prodiginine biosynthesis in Streptomyces coelicolor have elucidated the function of many enzymes within the pathway. However, the function of RedJ, which was predicted to be an editing thioesterase based on sequence similarity, is unknown. We report here the genetic, biochemical, and structural characterization of the redJ gene product. Deletion of redJ in S. coelicolor leads to a 75% decrease in prodiginine production, demonstrating its importance for prodiginine biosynthesis. RedJ exhibits thioesterase activity with selectivity for substrates having long acyl chains and lacking a β-carboxyl substituent. The thioesterase has 1000-fold greater catalytic efficiency with substrates linked to an acyl carrier protein (ACP) than with the corresponding CoA thioester substrates. Also, RedJ strongly discriminates against the streptomycete ACP of fatty acid biosynthesis in preference to RedQ, an ACP of the prodiginine pathway. The 2.12 Å resolution crystal structure of RedJ provides insights into the molecular basis for the observed substrate selectivity. A hydrophobic pocket in the active site chamber is positioned to bind long acyl chains, as suggested by a long-chain ligand from the crystallization solution bound in this pocket. The accessibility of the active site is controlled by the position of a highly flexible entrance flap. These data combined with previous studies of prodiginine biosynthesis in S. coelicolor support a novel role for RedJ in facilitating transfer of a dodecanoyl chain from one acyl carrier protein to another en route to the key biosynthetic intermediate 2-undecylpyrrole."

https://openalex.org/W2158891664,"Co-translational protein targeting to the membrane is mediated by the signal recognition particle and its receptor (FtsY). Their homologous GTPase domains interact at the membrane and form a heterodimer in which both GTPases are activated. The prerequisite for protein targeting is the interaction of FtsY with phospholipids. However, the mechanism of FtsY regulation by phospholipids remained unclear. Here we show that the N terminus of FtsY (A domain) is natively unfolded in solution and define the complete membrane-targeting sequence. We show that the membrane-targeting sequence is highly dynamic in solution, independent of nucleotides and directly responds to the density of anionic phospholipids by a random coil-helix transition. This conformational switch is essential for tethering FtsY to membranes and activates the GTPase for its subsequent interaction with the signal recognition particle. Our results underline the dynamics of lipid-protein interactions and their importance in the regulation of protein targeting and translocation across biological membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2162302412,"The helper-component proteinase (HC-Pro) of potyvirus is involved in polyprotein processing, aphid transmission, and suppression of antiviral RNA silencing. There is no high resolution structure reported for any part of HC-Pro, hindering mechanistic understanding of its multiple functions. We have determined the crystal structure of the cysteine protease domain of HC-Pro from turnip mosaic virus at 2.0 Å resolution. As a protease, HC-Pro only cleaves a Gly-Gly dipeptide at its own C terminus. The structure represents a postcleavage state in which the cleaved C terminus remains tightly bound at the active site cleft to prevent trans activity. The structure adopts a compact α/β-fold, which differs from papain-like cysteine proteases and shows weak similarity to nsP2 protease from Venezuelan equine encephalitis alphavirus. Nevertheless, the catalytic cysteine and histidine residues constitute an active site that is highly similar to these in papain-like and nsP2 proteases. HC-Pro recognizes a consensus sequence YXVGG around the cleavage site between the two glycine residues. The structure delineates the sequence specificity at sites P1-P4. Structural modeling and covariation analysis across the Potyviridae family suggest a tryptophan residue accounting for the glycine specificity at site P1'. Moreover, a surface of the protease domain is conserved in potyvirus but not in other genera of the Potyviridae family, likely due to extra functional constrain. The structure provides insight into the catalysis mechanism, cis-acting mode, cleavage site specificity, and other functions of the HC-Pro protease domain."

A robotic microarrayer was used to print yeast cells of C. albicans encapsulated in a collagen matrix at a volume as low as 50 nL onto surface-modified microscope slides. Upon incubation, the cells grow into fully formed ""nano-biofilms"". The morphological and architectural complexity of these biofilms were evaluated by scanning electron and confocal scanning laser microscopy. The extent of biofilm formation was determined using a microarray scanner from changes in fluorescence intensities due to FUN 1 metabolic processing. This staining technique was also adapted for antifungal susceptibility testing, which demonstrated that, similar to regular biofilms, cells within the on-chip biofilms displayed elevated levels of resistance against antifungal agents (fluconazole and amphotericin B). Thus, results from structural analyses and antifungal susceptibility testing indicated that despite miniaturization, these biofilms display the typical phenotypic properties associated with the biofilm mode of growth. In its final format, the C. albicans biofilm chip (CaBChip) is composed of 768 equivalent and spatially distinct nano-biofilms on a single slide; multiple chips can be printed and processed simultaneously. Compared to current methods for the formation of microbial biofilms, namely the 96-well microtiter plate model, this fungal biofilm chip has advantages in terms of miniaturization and automation, which combine to cut reagent use and analysis time, minimize labor intensive steps, and dramatically reduce assay costs. Such a chip should accelerate the antifungal drug discovery process by enabling rapid, convenient and inexpensive screening of hundreds-to-thousands of compounds simultaneously."
https://openalex.org/W1983885107,"Background Francisella tularensis is a category-A select agent and is responsible for tularemia in humans and animals. The surface components of F. tularensis that contribute to virulence are not well characterized. An electron-dense capsule has been postulated to be present around F. tularensis based primarily on electron microscopy, but this specific antigen has not been isolated or characterized. Methods and Findings A capsule-like complex (CLC) was effectively extracted from the cell surface of an F. tularensis live vaccine strain (LVS) lacking O-antigen with 0.5% phenol after 10 passages in defined medium broth and growth on defined medium agar for 5 days at 32°C in 7% CO2. The large molecular size CLC was extracted by enzyme digestion, ethanol precipitation, and ultracentrifugation, and consisted of glucose, galactose, mannose, and Proteinase K-resistant protein. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR showed that expression of genes in a putative polysaccharide locus in the LVS genome (FTL_1432 through FTL_1421) was upregulated when CLC expression was enhanced. Open reading frames FTL_1423 and FLT_1422, which have homology to genes encoding for glycosyl transferases, were deleted by allelic exchange, and the resulting mutant after passage in broth (LVSΔ1423/1422_P10) lacked most or all of the CLC, as determined by electron microscopy, and CLC isolation and analysis. Complementation of LVSΔ1423/1422 and subsequent passage in broth restored CLC expression. LVSΔ1423/1422_P10 was attenuated in BALB/c mice inoculated intranasally (IN) and intraperitoneally with greater than 80 times and 270 times the LVS LD50, respectively. Following immunization, mice challenged IN with over 700 times the LD50 of LVS remained healthy and asymptomatic. Conclusions Our results indicated that the CLC may be a glycoprotein, FTL_1422 and -FTL_1423 were involved in CLC biosynthesis, the CLC contributed to the virulence of F. tularensis LVS, and a CLC-deficient mutant of LVS can protect mice against challenge with the parent strain."

In the present study, we found that the zinc finger-containing factor Teashirt-3 (TSHZ3) was expressed in quiescent satellite cells of adult mouse skeletal muscles. We showed that following treatment with cardiotoxin TSHZ3 was strongly expressed in satellite cells of regenerating muscles. Moreover, immunohistochemical analysis indicated that TSHZ3 was expressed in both quiescent and activated satellite cells on intact myofibers in culture. TSHZ3 expression was maintained in myoblasts but disappeared with myotube formation. In C2C12 myoblasts, we showed that overexpression of Tshz3 impaired myogenic differentiation and promoted the down-regulation of myogenin (Myog) and up-regulation of paired-box factor 7 (Pax7). Moreover, knockdown experiments revealed a selective effect of Tshz3 on Myog regulation, and transcriptional reporter experiments indicated that TSHZ3 repressed Myog promoter. We identified the BRG1-associated factor 57 (BAF57), a subunit of the SWI/SNF complex, as a partner of TSHZ3. We showed that TSHZ3 cooperated with BAF57 to repress MYOD-dependent Myog expression. These results suggest a novel mechanism for transcriptional repression by TSHZ3 in which TSHZ3 and BAF57 cooperate to modulate MyoD activity on the Myog promoter to regulate skeletal muscle differentiation."

Dysregulation of lipid metabolism and adipose tissue function contributes to diet-induced obesity. Here, we report that β-arrestin-1 knock-out mice are susceptible to diet-induced obesity. Knock-out of the gene encoding β-arrestin-1 caused increased fat mass accumulation and decreased whole-body insulin sensitivity in mice fed a high-fat diet. In β-arrestin-1 knock-out mice, we observed disrupted food intake and energy expenditure and increased macrophage infiltration in white adipose tissue. At the molecular level, β-arrestin-1 deficiency affected the expression of many lipid metabolic genes and inflammatory genes in adipose tissue.

Thus, our findings reveal that β-arrestin-1 plays a role in metabolism regulation. The prevalence of obesity is increasing dramatically in many regions and among many ethnicities and has become a serious public health concern. Obesity is regarded as the major risk factor for insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and various cardiovascular diseases (1Wang Y. Vera L. Fischer W.H. Montminy M. Nature. 2009; 460: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 2Kahn B.B. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (2463) Google Scholar). An abnormal accumulation of adipose tissue, the infiltration of macrophages into adipose tissue, and enhanced systemic inflammation are the major pathological features of obesity. Furthermore, numerous studies have revealed that adipose tissue modulates whole-body glucose and lipid homeostasis by controlling lipid turnover in the body (3Pagliassotti M.J. Gayles E.C. Hill J.O. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 827: 431-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Obesity-induced inflammation is considered a potential link between obesity and its related pathologies, such as insulin resistance, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and other immune disorders (4Olefsky J.M. Glass C.K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2010; 72: 219-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar). However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying obesity are extremely complex and not yet fully understood. β-Arrestins (β-arrestin-1 and β-arrestin-2) are traditionally regarded as terminators of G protein-coupled receptor signaling and regulators of receptor desensitization following stimulation (5Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar, 6Dawson T.M. Arriza J.L. Jaworsky D.E. Borisy F.F. Attramadal H. Lefkowitz R.J. Ronnett G.V. Science. 1993; 259: 825-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Studies have demonstrated that β-arrestins regulate diverse signaling pathways in addition to G protein-coupled receptors by serving as multiple-function binding partners for various protein complexes (7McDonald P.H.

Our recent study demonstrated that β-arrestin-2, which is located primarily in the cytoplasm, functions as an indispensable scaffold that links Akt and Src to the insulin receptor following insulin stimulation, and a deficiency of β-arrestin-2 contributes to insulin resistance (11Luan B. Zhao J. Wu H. Duan B. Shu G. Wang X. Li D. Jia W. Kang J. Pei G. Nature. 2009; 457: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that β-arrestin-1 mediates insulin receptor substrate-1 and glucagon-like peptide-1 signaling in β-cells. In this study, we report that a deficiency of β-arrestin-1 contributes to diet-induced obesity. β-Arrestin-1 knock-out (βarr1-ko) 3The abbreviations used are: βarr1-koβ-arrestin-1 knock-outβarr1-tgβ-arrestin-1 transgenicGTTglucose tolerance testITTinsulin tolerance testHFDhigh-fat dietRDregular dietTGtriglycerideWATwhite adipose tissue. and βarr2-ko mice were provided by Dr. Robert J.

All other mice were from the Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Animal experiments were in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Mice were fed a regular diet (Formulab 5008 and Labdiet 5053) or a high-fat diet (55% fat calories; Harlan Teklad 93075) and had free access to water and food. β-arrestin-1 knock-out β-arrestin-1 transgenic glucose tolerance test insulin tolerance test high-fat diet regular diet triglyceride white adipose tissue. We measured food intake, mean activity, oxygen consumption, and carbon dioxide production in metabolic chambers (Columbus CLAMS-8). We analyzed the fat mass and lean mass by NMR spectroscopy (Bruker minispecTM). Adipose tissue samples were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde. Paraffin embedding, sectioning, and hematoxylin and eosin staining were performed according to standard protocols. Macrophages in the epididymal fat pads were visualized by anti-F4/80 antibody (eBioscience) immunostaining and quantified as described previously (13Weisberg S.P. Hunter D. Huber R. Lemieux J. Slaymaker S. Vaddi K. Charo I. Leibel R.L. Ferrante Jr., A.W. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). For GTTs, mice were injected intraperitoneally with glucose after starvation for 6 h. Blood glucose was measure at different time points. For ITTs, mice were injected intraperitoneally under fed conditions. We collected blood and determined glycemia using a glucometer (Accu-Chek, Roche Applied Science). Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps were performed as described (14Shen H.Q. Zhu J.S. Baron A.D. Metabolism. 1999; 48: 965-970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 15Haluzik M.M.

Insulin was infused at 2.5 milliunits/kg/min. In vitro and in vivo data were analyzed by Student's t test and analysis of variance followed by Student's t test, respectively. β-Arrestin-1 and β-arrestin-2 are known as cytosolic signaling mediators and scaffold proteins. To investigate the physiological role of β-arrestin-1 in metabolism, we used transgenic mice overexpressing human β-arrestin-1 (βarr1-tg) and βarr1-ko mice. We fed βarr1-tg and βarr1-ko mice and their wild-type littermates a high-fat (55% fat) diet (HFD) to generate diet-induced obese mice (16Yang Q. Graham T.E. Mody N. Preitner F. Peroni O.D. Zabolotny J.M. Kotani K. Quadro L. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2005; 436: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar). There was a 2-fold increase in the expression of β-arrestin-1 in βarr1-tg mice compared with non-transgenic mice (data not shown). βarr1-tg mice developed normally, and the body lengths of all mice were similar. Although the total body weights did not differ at weaning, at 4 weeks of age, βarr1-tg mice fed a HFD began to gain weight at a slower rate than their wild-type littermates (Fig. 1A). This difference in body weight increased as the mice aged, and after 14 weeks of HFD treatment, βarr1-tg mice weighed 33.6 ± 1.3 g (n = 10), whereas their wild-type littermates weighed 36.9 ± 0.9 g (n = 10; p < 0.05). βarr1-ko mice were viable and fertile. After 14 weeks of HFD treatment, βarr1-ko mice gained ∼21.6 ± 0.7 g, whereas their wild-type littermates gained 17.3 ± 0.8 g. This discrepancy in weight gain was also observed in βarr1-tg and βarr1-ko mice that were fed a regular diet (RD), albeit to a lesser extent (Fig. 1, A and B). The body lengths of these mice were similar (Fig. 1C). It is noteworthy that the weight gain in βarr1-tg mice that were fed a HFD did not differ from that in mice fed a RD. These results suggest that elevation of β-arrestin-1 expression slows the development of obesity. Obese mice show abnormal blood lipid profiles (17Herberg L. Döppen W. Major E. Gries F.A. J. Lipid Res. 1974; 15: 580-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We monitored blood triglyceride (TG) and free fatty acid levels in βarr1-tg, βarr1-ko, and wild-type mice fed a HFD or RD. Compared with their wild-type littermates, βarr1-tg mice fed a HFD showed markedly lower levels of TGs and free fatty acids, whereas βarr1-ko mice showed significantly higher lipid levels (Fig. 1D). Leptin has been demonstrated to reduce the plasma TG content, and the development of leptin resistance and elevated blood leptin levels are commonly observed in obese animals and patients (17Herberg L. Döppen W. Major E. Gries F.A. J. Lipid Res. 1974; 15: 580-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that following HFD treatment, βarr1-tg mice showed lower levels of leptin, whereas βarr1-ko mice showed higher leptin levels (Fig. 1E). Together, these results indicate that βarr1-ko mice are susceptible and that βarr1-tg mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity. Obesity is known to engender insulin resistance and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (18Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 2001; 104: 531-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar, 19Björntorp P.

Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 3087-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Diet-induced obese mice show deficient systemic insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis (17Herberg L. Döppen W. Major E. Gries F.A. J. Lipid Res. 1974; 15: 580-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Surwit R.S. Kuhn C.M. Cochrane C. McCubbin J.A. Feinglos M.N. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 1163-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). As we reported previously, we did not find any evidence that β-arrestin-1 affects systematic insulin sensitivity (22Luan B. Zhang Z. Wu Y. Kang J. Pei G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4237-4246Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). No change was observed in GTTs and ITTs using βarr1-ko, βarr1-tg, and wild-type mice that were fed a RD (Fig. 2, A and B). However, after 14 weeks of HFD treatment, βarr1-tg mice had lower blood glucose and insulin levels than their wild-type littermates, whereas βarr1-ko mice showed higher blood glucose and insulin levels (Fig. 2, C and D). This result indicates that HFD-treated βarr1-ko mice have a higher demand for insulin accompanied by a defect in glucose homeostasis, whereas βarr1-tg mice are resistant to the development of obesity-associated insulin resistance. We next performed GTTs and ITTs with HFD-treated βarr1-ko, βarr1-tg, and wild-type control mice. In wild-type mice, an intraperitoneal injection of 1.5 g of glucose/kg induced a rapid increase in blood glucose levels with a gradual return to normal levels over 2 h. In contrast, the same injection in βarr1-tg mice resulted in a lower glucose increase and a lower glucose response overall (Fig. 2E), suggesting improved glucose homeostasis in these HFD-treated transgenic mice. Insulin secretion in response to glucose loading during GTTs was also lower in βarr1-tg mice, indicating improved insulin sensitivity in transgenic mice (Fig. 2F). This result was further confirmed by ITTs. In ITTs, an intraperitoneal injection of 1.5 units of insulin/kg induced a time-dependent reduction of blood glucose and a gradual return to nearly normal levels in both wild-type littermates and βarr1-tg mice. However, the reduction in blood glucose was enhanced, and the hypoglycemic effect of insulin was more sustained in βarr1-tg mice than in wild-type littermates (Fig. 2G). These results demonstrate that, compared with their wild-type littermates, HFD-treated βarr1-tg mice had enhanced insulin sensitivity. The results of GTTs (1.5 g/kg) and ITTs (1.5 units/kg) in HFD-treated βarr1-ko mice revealed that the insulin sensitivity of βarr1-ko mice was compromised compared with wild-type littermates (Fig. 2, H–J). Taken together, these analyses indicate that a deficiency of β-arrestin-1 contributes to diet-induced impairment of insulin sensitivity, whereas an elevation in the protein levels of β-arrestin-1 improves systemic insulin sensitivity in HFD-treated mice. To further substantiate the role of β-arrestin-1 in modulating obesity-associated whole-body and tissue-specific insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism, hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies were performed. There was no significant difference in basal and clamped hepatic glucose production between HFD-treated βarr1-ko mice and wild-type littermates (Fig. 3, A and B). In βarr1-ko mice, however, both whole-body glucose disposal and glucose infusion rates were significantly decreased (Fig. 3, C and D), indicating that HFD-fed βarr1-ko mice had an impaired insulin sensitivity. To further evaluate the effect of β-arrestin-1 on metabolic changes, we monitored changes in energy expenditure and animal activity by keeping RD- and HFD-treated mice in metabolic chambers. When βarr1-tg, βarr1-ko, and wild-type mice were fed a RD, all of the mice had similar mean activity levels, consumed a similar amount of food and oxygen, and had similar CO2 release (Fig. 4, A–D). Mice fed a HFD had similar mean activities, but βarr1-tg mice consumed significantly less food and expended more energy than their wild-type littermates (Fig. 4, E and F), whereas βarr1-ko mice consumed significantly more food and expended less energy than their wild-type littermates (Fig. 4, F–H). We further determined the fat and lean masses of these mice using NMR spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 5 (A and B), after 14 weeks of HFD treatment, the percent fat mass was 13.8 ± 2.3 g in βarr1-tg mice and 24.1 ± 2.5 g in wild-type mice but 27.4 ± 3.3 g in βarr1-ko mice (n = 10; p < 0.05). Various adipose depots contribute to whole-body fat mass, including visceral fat, subcutaneous fat, and gonadal fat pad. We found that the lower body weight gain of βarr1-tg mice can be ascribed largely to slower growth of gonadal fat pads, the major adipose depot (Fig. 5C). Hematoxylin and eosin staining of epididymal white adipose tissue (WAT) from βarr1-tg, βarr1-ko, or wild-type mice fed a HFD or RD revealed that wild-type mice fed a HFD showed a marked increase in adipocyte size (mean diameter of 63.5 ± 3.8 μm). Such diet-induced hypertrophy was less pronounced in βarr1-tg mice (mean diameter of 45.4 ± 4.1 μm) but was more severe in βarr1-ko mice (mean diameter of 75.1 ± 4.5 μm) (Fig. 5, D and E). In another type of adipose tissue, brown adipose tissue, the functions of which are different from those of WAT (23Nedergaard J. Bengtsson T. Cannon B. Cell Metab. 2011; 13: 238-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), we observed no difference in adipocyte size in mice fed either a HFD or RD (Fig. 5F). Hematoxylin and eosin staining and TG levels of liver samples from βarr1-ko mice showed that hepatic steatosis was more severe in βarr1-ko mice than in wild-type mice fed a HFD, whereas βarr1-tg mice showed less hepatic steatosis compared with their wild-type littermates fed a HFD (Fig. 5, G and H). These data suggest that β-arrestin-1 might act in WAT to affect fat deposition and weight gain. The infiltration of macrophages into adipose tissue is one of the major pathological features of obesity. Adipose tissue macrophage infiltration was monitored by immunohistochemical staining with anti-F4/80 antibody. As shown in Fig. 5I, adipose tissue from βarr1-tg mice fed a HFD exhibited a 70% reduction in adipose tissue macrophage infiltration compared with adipose tissue from wild-type littermates. In contrast, there were more detectable macrophages in the adipose tissue of βarr1-ko mice. Adipose tissue macrophages produce inflammatory cytokines and contribute to obesity-related abnormal immune responses. We measured the serum levels of inflammatory cytokines in βarr1-tg, βarr1-ko, and wild-type mice fed either a HFD or RD. The serum levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and MCP-1 in wild-type and βarr1-ko mice fed either a RD or HFD elevated similarly. However, there was no significant difference in the levels of these cytokines in βarr1-tg mice compared with those in wild-type littermates (Fig. 5J). These results indicate that overexpression of the β-arrestin-1 gene prevents the obesity-related immune response induced by HFD treatment. We further measured the expression of genes related to adipocyte differentiation, lipid metabolism, and inflammation in the adipose tissue of wild-type and βarr1-ko mice fed a HFD. We found that FABP4 (fatty acid-binding protein 4; also called aP2 (adipocyte protein 2)) and genes associated with lipid metabolism, including the fatty acid transporter CD36, fatty acid synthase, and lipoprotein lipase, were significantly increased in the adipocyte fraction of WAT from βarr1-ko mice fed a HFD compared with their expression levels in white adipocytes from wild-type mice (Fig. 6A). These results are consistent with the increased fat mass and adipocyte size observed in these knock-out mice. We also measured the mRNA expression of inflammatory response genes in fat tissue. Consistent with a higher production of inflammatory mediators by adipose-resident macrophages, there was an increased expression of TNF and other macrophage-derived molecules, along with Nos2 and Mcp-1, in the WAT of βarr1-ko mice fed a HFD (Fig. 6A). This gene expression profile suggests that a higher production of inflammatory mediators might also contribute to insulin resistance in βarr1-ko mice fed a HFD. In mice fed a HFD, the expression of these genes was significantly lower in βarr1-tg mice compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 6B). Together, these data indicate that a deficiency of β-arrestin-1 increases the expression of adipogenic genes and inflammatory response genes. Taken together, our results show that a lack of β-arrestin-1 predisposes mice to diet-induced obesity. Conversely, the expression of β-arrestin-1 in mice reduces their susceptibility to diet-induced obesity and to obesity-induced insulin resistance and inflammation. β-Arrestin-1 and β-arrestin-2 are ubiquitously and abundantly expressed signaling proteins that have been extensively studied for their critical functions in neural and immune systems (12Shi Y.

These studies demonstrated that mice deficient in either β-arrestin isoform appear normal but that, in the presence of various pathological challenges, these mice display phenotypes associated with related disorders, suggesting a link between β-arrestin malfunction and a predisposition toward many complex diseases. Combined with previous studies (11Luan B. Zhao J. Wu H. Duan B. Shu G. Wang X. Li D. Jia W. Kang J. Pei G. Nature. 2009; 457: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 27Sonoda N.

A deficiency in either β-arrestin isoform contributes to the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders, including obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes. However, considering the versatile signaling pathways β-arrestin-1 regulates and mediates, we speculate that β-arrestin-1 may contribute to metabolic control by playing different regulatory roles. To discriminate between the different functions of β-arrestin-1, we are currently working on research with animals that have tissue-specific depletion of β-arrestin-1. Previous reports have shown that repression of adipogenesis in adipose tissue slows the pathogenesis of obesity in mice (29Hosooka T. Noguchi T. Kotani K. Nakamura T. Sakaue H. Inoue H. Ogawa W.

Med. 2007; 13: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Inflammation in adipose tissue is another factor associated with obesity and obesity-induced insulin resistance (31Pascual G. Fong A.L. Ogawa S. Gamliel A. Li A.C. Perissi V. Rose D.W. Willson T.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Nature. 2005; 437: 759-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). In this work, we compared the expression levels of adipogenesis- and inflammation-related genes in the adipose tissue of βarr1-tg and βarr1-ko mice with those of their wild-type littermates when fed a HFD. We found significant differences between the genotypes, indicating that the regulation of adipogenesis and the inflammatory response by β-arrestin-1 may be an underlying mechanism. Previous studies have shown that β-arrestin-1 mediates glucagon-like peptide-1 signaling, which induces insulin secretion in cultured β-cells (27Sonoda N. Imamura T. Yoshizaki T. Babendure J.L. Lu J.C. Olefsky J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6614-6619Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated here that insulin sensitivity is maintained in HFD-fed βarr1-tg mice compared with HFD-fed wild-type littermate control mice. This protection from diet-induced insulin resistance indicates that regulation of the G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway by β-arrestin-1 may also play a role in whole-body metabolism. This hypothesis will require further investigation with tissue-specific βarr1-ko mice. We thank Dr. Robert J. Lefkowitz for providing βarr1-ko and βarr2-ko mice. We thank all members of the laboratory for sharing reagents and advice."
https://openalex.org/W1964345708,"CD148 is a receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatase known to inhibit transduction of mitogenic signals in non-hematopoietic cells. Similarly, in the hematopoietic lineage, CD148 inhibited signal transduction downstream of T cell receptor. However, it also augmented immunoreceptor signaling in B cells and macrophages via dephosphorylating C-terminal tyrosine of Src family kinases (SFK). Accordingly, endogenous CD148 compensated for the loss of the main SFK activator CD45 in murine B cells and macrophages but not in T cells. Hypothetical explanations for the difference between T cells and other leukocyte lineages include the inability of CD148 to dephosphorylate a specific set of SFKs involved in T cell activation or the lack of CD148 expression during critical stages of T cell development. Here we describe striking differences in CD148 expression between human and murine thymocyte subsets, the only unifying feature being the absence of CD148 during the positive selection when the major developmental block occurs under CD45 deficiency. Moreover, we demonstrate that similar to CD45, CD148 has both activating and inhibitory effects on the SFKs involved in TCR signaling. However, in the absence of CD45, activating effects prevail, resulting in functional complementation of CD45 deficiency in human T cell lines. Importantly, this is independent of the tyrosines in the CD148 C-terminal tail, contradicting the recently proposed phosphotyrosine displacement model as a mechanism of SFK activation by CD148. Collectively, our data suggest that differential effects of CD148 in T cells and other leukocyte subsets cannot be explained by the CD148 inability to activate T cell SFKs but rather by its dual inhibitory/activatory function and specific expression pattern.

Collectively, our data suggest that differential effects of CD148 in T cells and other leukocyte subsets cannot be explained by the CD148 inability to activate T cell SFKs but rather by its dual inhibitory/activatory function and specific expression pattern."
https://openalex.org/W1987594351,"Atomic force microscopy was used to study the three-dimensional molecular topography and calcium-sensitive conformational changes of Connexin40 hemichannels (connexons) reconstituted in 1,2-dioeloyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine lipid bilayers. Two classes of objects were observed that differed in their protrusion heights above the bilayer (2.6 versus 4.2 nm). Comparison to reconstituted connexons containing Connexin40 truncated to eliminate most of its C-terminal cytoplasmic domain showed that the two height classes corresponded to the shorter extracellular and taller cytoplasmic aspects of the hemichannels and that the C-terminal tail of Connexin40 contributes ∼1.6 nm in thickness. Hemichannels imaged in solutions containing < 10 μm Ca(2+) showed 3.1-3.2 nm depressions (openings) in 30% of the cytoplasmic faces and 65% of the extracellular faces, and high-resolution three-dimensional topography of extracellular or cytoplasmic aspects of some connexons was observed. After addition of 3.6 mm Ca(2+), > 75% of the connexons in either orientation adopted closed conformations. In contrast, hemichannels imaged in the presence of 0.1 mm EDTA showed large (5.6- to 5.8-nm diameter) openings in nearly all hemichannels regardless of orientation, and detailed topography was visible in many connexons. Real-time imaging following the addition of 3.6 mm Ca(2+) showed transitions of both extracellular and cytoplasmic orientations from ""open"" into ""closed"" conformations within several minutes. These studies provide the first high-resolution topographic information regarding a connexin with a large cytoplasmic domain and suggest that the extramembranous portions of Connexin40 contribute to a channel entrance that is relaxed by chelation of residual divalent cations."
https://openalex.org/W2058775507,"During a comparison of the infectivity of mNDK, a CD4-independent human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strain, to various cell lines, we found that HeLa cells were much less susceptible than 293T and TE671 cells. Hybridoma cells between HeLa and 293T cells were as susceptible as 293T cells, suggesting that cellular factors enhance the mNDK infection in 293T cells. By screening a cDNA expression library in HeLa cells, cystatin C was isolated as an enhancer of the mNDK infection. Because cathepsin B protease, a natural ligand of cystatin C, was upregulated in HeLa cells, we speculated that the high levels of cathepsin B activities were inhibitory to the CD4-independent infection and that cystatin C enhanced the infection by impairing the excessive cathepsin B activity. Consistent with this idea, pretreatment of HeLa cells with 125 µM of CA-074Me, a cathepsin B inhibitor, resulted in an 8-fold enhancement of the mNDK infectivity. Because cathepsin B is activated by low pH in acidic endosomes, we further examined the potential roles of endosomes in the CD4-independent infection. Suppression of endosome acidification or endocytosis by inhibitors or by an Eps15 dominant negative mutant reduced the infectivity of mNDK in which CD4-dependent infections were not significantly impaired. Taken together, these results suggest that endocytosis, endosomal acidification, and cathepsin B activity are involved in the CD4-independent entry of HIV-1."
https://openalex.org/W2167518869,"Glis3 is a member of the Glis subfamily of Krüppel-like zinc finger transcription factors. Recently, Glis3 has been linked to both type I and type II diabetes and shown to positively regulate insulin gene expression. In this study, we have identified a region within the N terminus of Glis3 that shares high levels of homology with the Cubitus interruptus (Ci)/Gli family of proteins. We demonstrated that Glis3 interacts with Suppressor of Fused (SUFU), which involves a VYGHF motif located within this conserved region. We further showed that SUFU is able to inhibit the activation of the insulin promoter by Glis3 but not the activation by a Glis3 mutant deficient in its ability to bind SUFU, suggesting that the inhibitory effect is dependent on the interaction between the two proteins. Exogenous SUFU did not affect the nuclear localization of Glis3; however, Glis3 promoted the nuclear accumulation of SUFU. Additionally, we demonstrated that SUFU stabilizes Glis3 in part by antagonizing the Glis3 association with a Cullin 3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase that promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of Glis3. This is the first reported instance of Glis3 interacting with SUFU and suggests a novel role for SUFU in the modulation of Glis3 signaling. Given the critical role of Glis3 in pancreatic β-cell generation and maintenance, the elevated Glis3 expression in several cancers, and the established role of SUFU as a tumor suppressor, these data provide further insight into Glis3 regulation and its function in development and disease."
https://openalex.org/W1965117798,"α(2)-Antiplasmin is the physiological inhibitor of plasmin and is unique in the serpin family due to N- and C-terminal extensions beyond its core domain. The C-terminal extension comprises 55 amino acids from Asn-410 to Lys-464, and the lysine residues (Lys-418, Lys-427, Lys-434, Lys-441, Lys-448, and Lys-464) within this region are important in mediating the initial interaction with kringle domains of plasmin. To understand the role of lysine residues within the C terminus of α(2)-antiplasmin, we systematically and sequentially mutated the C-terminal lysines, studied the effects on the rate of plasmin inhibition, and measured the binding affinity for plasmin via surface plasmon resonance. We determined that the C-terminal lysine (Lys-464) is individually most important in initiating binding to plasmin. Using two independent methods, we also showed that the conserved internal lysine residues play a major role mediating binding of the C terminus of α(2)-antiplasmin to kringle domains of plasmin and in accelerating the rate of interaction between α(2)-antiplasmin and plasmin. When the C terminus of α(2)-antiplasmin was removed, the binding affinity for active site-blocked plasmin remained high, suggesting additional exosite interactions between the serpin core and plasmin."
https://openalex.org/W2088508766,"The purified mammalian branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC), which catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of branched-chain α-keto acids, is essentially devoid of the constituent dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase component (E3). The absence of E3 is associated with the low affinity of the subunit-binding domain of human BCKDC (hSBDb) for hE3. In this work, sequence alignments of hSBDb with the E3-binding domain (E3BD) of the mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase complex show that hSBDb has an arginine at position 118, where E3BD features an asparagine. Substitution of Arg-118 with an asparagine increases the binding affinity of the R118N hSBDb variant (designated hSBDb*) for hE3 by nearly 2 orders of magnitude. The enthalpy of the binding reaction changes from endothermic with the wild-type hSBDb to exothermic with the hSBDb* variant. This higher affinity interaction allowed the determination of the crystal structure of the hE3/hSBDb* complex to 2.4-Å resolution. The structure showed that the presence of Arg-118 poses a unique, possibly steric and/or electrostatic incompatibility that could impede E3 interactions with the wild-type hSBDb. Compared with the E3/E3BD structure, the hE3/hSBDb* structure has a smaller interfacial area. Solution NMR data corroborated the interactions of hE3 with Arg-118 and Asn-118 in wild-type hSBDb and mutant hSBDb*, respectively. The NMR results also showed that the interface between hSBDb and hE3 does not change significantly from hSBDb to hSBDb*.

https://openalex.org/W2078641812,"Wilms tumor (WT) has been a model to study kidney embryogenesis and tumorigenesis and, although associated with hereditary, cancer predisposition syndromes, the majority of tumors occur sporadically. To analyze genetic changes in WT we have defined copy number changes and loss of heterozygosity in 56 Wilms tumors using high resolution oligonucleotide arrays at a average resolution of ∼12 Kb. Consistent deletions were seen on chromosomes 1p, 4q, 7p, 9q, 11p, 11q, 14q, 16q, and 21q. High frequency gains were seen for 1q and lower frequency gains were seen on 7q and chromosomes 8, 12 and 18. The high resolution provided by the SNP mapping arrays has defined minimal regions of deletion for many of these LOH events. Analysis of CNAs by tumor stage show relatively stable karyotypes in stage 1 tumors and more complex aCGH profiles in tumors from stages 3–5."
https://openalex.org/W1977175163,"Macrosatellites are some of the most polymorphic regions of the human genome, yet many remain uncharacterized despite the association of some arrays with disease susceptibility. This study sought to explore the polymorphic nature of the X-linked macrosatellite DXZ4. Four aspects of DXZ4 were explored in detail, including tandem repeat copy number variation, array instability, monomer sequence polymorphism and array expression. DXZ4 arrays contained between 12 and 100 3.0 kb repeat units with an average array containing 57. Monomers were confirmed to be arranged in uninterrupted tandem arrays by restriction digest analysis and extended fiber FISH, and therefore DXZ4 encompasses 36-288 kb of Xq23. Transmission of DXZ4 through three generations in three families displayed a high degree of meiotic instability (8.3%), consistent with other macrosatellite arrays, further highlighting the unstable nature of these sequences in the human genome. Subcloning and sequencing of complete DXZ4 monomers identified numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms and alleles for the three microsatellite repeats located within each monomer. Pairwise comparisons of DXZ4 monomer sequences revealed that repeat units from an array are more similar to one another than those originating from different arrays. RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed significant variation in DXZ4 expression both within and between cell lines. DXZ4 transcripts could be detected originiating from both the active and inactive X chromosome. Expression levels of DXZ4 varied significantly between males, but did not relate to the size of the array, nor did inheritance of the same array result in similar expression levels. Collectively, these studies provide considerable insight into the polymorphic nature of DXZ4, further highlighting the instability and variation potential of macrosatellites in the human genome."
https://openalex.org/W2001236588,"Tumour-specific splicing is known to contribute to cancer progression. In the case of the L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM), which is expressed in many human tumours and often linked to bad prognosis, alternative splicing results in a full-length form (FL-L1CAM) and a splice variant lacking exons 2 and 27 (SV-L1CAM). It has not been elucidated so far whether SV-L1CAM, classically considered as tumour-associated, or whether FL-L1CAM is the metastasis-promoting isoform. Here, we show that both variants were expressed in human ovarian carcinoma and that exposure of tumour cells to pro-metastatic factors led to an exclusive increase of FL-L1CAM expression. Selective overexpression of one isoform in different tumour cells revealed that only FL-L1CAM promoted experimental lung and/or liver metastasis in mice. In addition, metastasis formation upon up-regulation of FL-L1CAM correlated with increased invasive potential and elevated Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 expression and activity in vitro as well as enhanced gelatinolytic activity in vivo. In conclusion, we identified FL-L1CAM as the metastasis-promoting isoform, thereby exemplifying that high expression of a so-called tumour-associated variant, here SV-L1CAM, is not per se equivalent to a decisive role of this isoform in tumour progression."

https://openalex.org/W2127842486,"Infanticide by adult male occurs in many mammalian species under natural conditions, and it is often assumed to be a goal-directed action and explained predominately by sexual selection. Motivation of this behavior in mammals is limitedly involved.We used long-term reproductive records and direct observation in captivity and in the field of two snub-nosed langur species on the basis of individual identification to investigate how infanticide happened and to be avoided in nonhuman primates. Our observations suggested that infanticide by invading males might be more accidental than goal-directed. The invading male seemed to monopolize all the females including lactating mothers during takeovers. Multiparous mothers who accepted the invading male shortly after takeovers avoided infanticide in most cases. Our results conjectured primiparous mothers would decrease infanticidal possibility if they sexually accepted the invading male during or immediately after takeovers. In the studied langur species, voluntary abortion or mating with the invading male was evidently adopted by females to limit or avoid infanticide by takeover males.The objective of the invading male was to monopolize all adult females after his takeover. It appeared that the mother's resistance to accepting the new male as a mating partner was the primary incentive for infanticide. Motivation analysis might be helpful to further understand why infanticide occurs in primate species."
https://openalex.org/W2041136754,"Recent psychophysical studies have shown that attention can alter contrast sensitivities for temporally broadband stimuli such as flashed gratings. The present study examined the effect of attention on the contrast sensitivity for temporally narrowband stimuli with various temporal frequencies. Observers were asked to detect a drifting grating of 0-40 Hz presented gradually in the peripheral visual field with or without a concurrent letter identification task in the fovea. We found that removal of attention by the concurrent task reduced the contrast sensitivity for gratings with low temporal frequencies much more profoundly than for gratings with high temporal frequencies and for flashed gratings. The analysis revealed that the temporal contrast sensitivity function had a more band-pass shape with poor attention. Additional experiments showed that this was also true when the target was presented in various levels of luminance noise. These results suggest that regardless of the presence of external noise, attention extensively modulates visual sensitivity for sustained retinal inputs."
https://openalex.org/W2089299294,"The CCN (cyr61, ctgf, nov) proteins (CCN1-6) are an important family of matricellular regulatory factors involved in internal and external cell signaling. They are central to essential biological processes such as adhesion, proliferation, angiogenesis, tumorigenesis, wound healing, and modulation of the extracellular matrix. They possess a highly conserved modular structure with four distinct modules that interact with a wide range of regulatory proteins and ligands. However, at the structural level, little is known although their biological function(s) seems to require cooperation between individual modules. Here we present for the first time structural determinants of two of the CCN family members, CCN3 and CCN5 (expressed in Escherichia coli), using small angle x-ray scattering. The results provide a description of the overall molecular shape and possible general three-dimensional modular arrangement for CCN proteins. These data unequivocally provide insight of the nature of CCN protein(s) in solution and thus important insight into their structure-function relationships."
https://openalex.org/W1992066274,"Although the activation of dermal dendritic cells (DCs) or Langerhans cells (LCs) via p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of metal allergy, the in vivo molecular mechanisms have not been identified and a possible therapeutic strategy using the control of dermal DCs or LCs has not been established. In this study, we focused on dermal DCs to define the in vivo mechanisms of metal allergy pathogenesis in a mouse nickel (Ni) allergy model. The effects of DC therapy on Ni allergic responses were also investigated.The activation of dermal DCs via p38 MAPK triggered a T cell-mediated allergic immune response in this model. In the MAPK signaling cascade in DCs, Ni potently phosphorylated MAP kinase kinase 6 (MKK6) following increased DC activation. Ni-stimulated DCs could prime T cell activation to induce Ni allergy. Interestingly, when MKK6 gene-transfected DCs were transferred into the model mice, a more pronounced allergic reaction was observed. In addition, injection of short interfering (si) RNA targeting the MKK6 gene protected against a hypersensitivity reaction after Ni immunization. The cooperative action between T cell activation and MKK6-mediated DC activation by Ni played an important role in the development of Ni allergy.DC activation by Ni played an important role in the development of Ni allergy. Manipulating the MKK6 gene in DCs may be a good therapeutic strategy for dermal Ni allergy."
https://openalex.org/W1993765700,"Multiplexed detection assays that analyze a modest number of nucleic acid targets over large sample sets are emerging as the preferred testing approach in such applications as routine pathogen typing, outbreak monitoring, and diagnostics. However, very few DNA testing platforms have proven to offer a solution for mid-plexed analysis that is high-throughput, sensitive, and with a low cost per test. In this work, an enhanced genotyping method based on MassCode technology was devised and integrated as part of a high-throughput mid-plexing analytical system that facilitates robust qualitative differential detection of DNA targets. Samples are first analyzed using MassCode PCR (MC-PCR) performed with an array of primer sets encoded with unique mass tags. Lambda exonuclease and an array of MassCode probes are then contacted with MC-PCR products for further interrogation and target sequences are specifically identified. Primer and probe hybridizations occur in homogeneous solution, a clear advantage over micro- or nanoparticle suspension arrays. The two cognate tags coupled to resultant MassCode hybrids are detected in an automated process using a benchtop single quadrupole mass spectrometer. The prospective value of using MassCode probe arrays for multiplexed bioanalysis was demonstrated after developing a 14plex proof of concept assay designed to subtype a select panel of Salmonella enterica serogroups and serovars. This MassCode system is very flexible and test panels can be customized to include more, less, or different markers."
