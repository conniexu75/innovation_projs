https://openalex.org/W2090945426,"The injection into the stratosphere of large quantities of sulfur during the June 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo (Philippines) and the subsequent formation of sulfate aerosol particles have generated a number of perturbations in the atmosphere with potential effects on the Earth's climate. Changes in the solar and infrared radiation budget caused by the eruption should produce a cooling of the troposphere and a warming of the lower stratosphere. These changes could affect atmospheric circulation. In addition, heterogeneous chemical reactions on the surface of sulfate aerosol particles render the ozone molecules more vulnerable to atmospheric chlorine and hence to man-made chlorofluorocarbons."
https://openalex.org/W2039061568,"Quantitative three-dimensional analysis of rock textures is now possible with the use of high-resolution computed x-ray tomography. When applied to metamorphic rocks, this technique provides data on the sizes and positions of minerals that allow mechanisms of porphyroblast crystallization to be identified. Statistical analysis of the sizes and spatial disposition of thousands of garnet crystals in three regionally metamorphosed rocks with diverse mineralogies, in conjunction with simple numerical models for crystallization, reveals in all cases the dominance of crystallization mechanisms whose kinetics are governed by rates of intergranular diffusion of nutrients."
https://openalex.org/W2077711976,"The flux of manganese from continental margin sediments to the ocean was measured with a free-vehicle, benthic flux chamber in a transect across the continental shelf and upper slope of the California margin. The highest fluxes were observed on the shallow continental shelf. Manganese flux decreased linearly with bottom water oxygen concentration, and the lowest fluxes occurred in the oxygen minimum zone (at a depth of 600 to 1000 meters). Although the flux of manganese from continental shelf sediments can account for the elevated concentrations observed in shallow, coastal waters, the flux from sediments that intersect the oxygen minimum cannot produce the subsurface concentration maximum of dissolved manganese that is observed in the Pacific Ocean."

https://openalex.org/W1998002688,"Two comments on a work by Murthy (1991) concerning the abundances of siderophile elements in the earth's mantle are presented. In the first comment it is asserted that the basis of Murthy's extrapolation is the assumption that the Gibbs free energy change for the partitioning reaction is independent of temperature, and as this is generally not a valid assumption thermodynamically, and as this is contradicted by most experimental data, the issue of mantle siderophile elements remains unresolved. In the second comment it is asserted that the extrapolation method used by Murthy does not appear to be valid thermodynamically, and that an extrapolation based on generally accepted thermodynamic assumptions yields different results. In a reply, Murthy takes issue with the comments."

https://openalex.org/W1968104263,The occurrence of vessel members in the roots and the possible occurrence of sieve-tube members in the rhizome is reported for the first time in the heterosporous fern Marsilea quadrifolia. This discovery adds a new instance of parallel evolution of vessels in vascular plants.
https://openalex.org/W2095220755,Four potassium-argon determinations from Tertiary rocks in the interior of British Columbia have yielded dates ranging from 45 to 49 million years. This suggests contemporaneity of three separate localities within the Middle Eocene epoch. Abundant plant micro- and macrofossils support this conclusion and indicate a flora quite different from floras of comparable age in western United States.

https://openalex.org/W2004556382,"Chemical analyses of 51 metal artifacts, one ingot, and two pieces of intermediate processed material from two Late Post Classic archeological sites in the Huastec area of Eastern Mesoamerica point to a second production locus for copper-arsenic-tin alloys, copper-arsenic-tin artifacts, and probably copper-tin and copper-arsenic bronze artifacts. Earlier evidence had indicated that these bronze alloys were produced exclusively in West Mexico. West Mexico was the region where metallurgy first developed in Mesoamerica, although major elements of that technology had been introduced from the metallurgies of Central and South America. The bronze working component of Huastec metallurgy was transmitted from the metalworking regions of West Mexico, most likely through market systems that distributed Aztec goods."

https://openalex.org/W2011281312,"By using tritium as an internal source of radiation, electron spin resonance spectra may be obtained for samples contained in glass without the usual disturbing effects due to irradiated glass. The production of OH and OD radicals in tritiated H(2)O and D(2)O ice may be readily demonstrated with this technique."
https://openalex.org/W1964948084,"The levels of strontium-90 and cesium-137 in cattle grazed on the Nevada Test Site and elsewhere in Nevada are similar to those in cattle from other parts of the country. Gastrointestinal absorption of the relatively large amounts of radioactive cerium-praseodymium, ruthenium-rhodium, and zirconium-niobium present in the rumina is very small. Zinc-65 made its first appearance in samples of muscle and liver in November 1958 and has persisted in later samplings. There has been no evidence of biological damage to date, either histologically or grossly."
