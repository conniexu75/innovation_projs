In the same subjects, depending upon which parameters were used, running reinforced drinking and drinking reinforced running. This relationship suggests that a ""reward"" is simply any response that is independently more probable than another response."

The median numerical estimations (made relative to a standard flash) confirmed three principles: the reciprocity between luminance and duration (Bloch's law), the enhancement of brightness at about 50 milliseconds (Broca-Sulzer effect), and the power-law relation between brightness and energy (Stevens's law)."

https://openalex.org/W1971898872,"THE properties of Sandoz ‘M.S. 222’ compound, a meta-amino-benzoic acid ethyl ester in the form of a soluble salt, as a general anæsthetic1,2 have led to its widespread use in studies of fish physiology. The general effects of this, and other anæsthetics on fish, have been examined by McFarland3, but, in the course of experiments on some aspects of the respiratory and circulatory physiology of teleosts, it became clear that ‘M.S. 222’ caused changes of considerable significance not hitherto described."

This phenomenon differs from the similar process known to occur in bacteria in that (i) the enzyme is an acid rather than an alkaline phosphatase, and (ii) enzyme activity nearly disappears after addition of phosphate to the culture."

https://openalex.org/W1965168319,"CLEAR-CUT evidence that the fœtus synthesizes its own plasma proteins is scant. It has been demonstrated by in vitro experiments that the liver of a fœtus of three months gestation can incorporate glycine labelled with carbon-14 into proteins resembling albumin, α1-globulin, α2-globulin, and β-globulin of human plasma1. These investigations also showed that metal-binding β-globulin (presumably transferrin) was capable of being synthesized by fœtal liver. Other workers have established that the fœtus synthesizes haptoglobin by finding some new-born children with types of haptoglobin that were absent in their mothers2,3."

https://openalex.org/W1549573504,"When 6-percent colloidal solutions of dextran (molecular weights, 10.000 to 500.000) are mixed with human serum in vitro, a new dextran-lipid fraction appears in paper strip electrophoresis between the starting point and the gamma globulins. The intensity of this dextran-lipid fraction increases with the progressive increase of molecular weight of the dextran used, and this increased intensity of the dextran-lipid fraction is accompanied simultaneously by an appropriate decrease of the lipid fraction migrating with the beta globulins. The intensity of the A-lipoproteins and the neutral fats adsorbed at the starting point seems unaltered by the application of dextran in colloidal solution regardless of the molecular weight of the dextran used. No change of the protein patterns was observed."

https://openalex.org/W2040122604,"Gerber and Altman have suggested1 that the mechanism involved in the synthesis of fibrous proteins is different from the mechanism involved in the synthesis of globular proteins. In particular, they suggested that collagen is synthesized by the addition of polypeptides containing 70–140 amino-acids to pre-existing collagen fibres. Although the communication raised a number of interesting questions, it should be noted that the conclusions which were reached are not entirely consistent with several recent reports. They stated that the mechanism underlying the biosynthesis of fibrous proteins must be unique, since experiments on the isotopic labelling of collagen and silk fibroin indicated that specific amino-acids are labelled to varying degrees in different parts of these molecules. It is now apparent, however, that a similar situation exists in the synthesis of a number of proteins and polypeptides, including ovalbumin, ribonuclease and insulin2. Recently, Dintzis3 demonstrated non-uniform labelling of specific amino-acids in the synthesis of the globular protein hæmoglobin."

https://openalex.org/W2024884047,IT has recently been shown that purified horse serum albumin and two other mammalian serum proteins labelled with iodine-131 were bound by sera of allergic individuals with cutaneous reactivity to these proteins1. The binding was demonstrated by immunological precipitation of human γ-globulin from a pre-incubated mixture of human serum and labelled antigen. The quantity of antigen in the precipitate was then estimated by its radioactivity. This procedure has been applied to the detection of iodine-131 ragweed antigen combined with the sera of untreated ragweed-sensitive individuals.
https://openalex.org/W1972907434,"AT the present time two well-defined systems of viral interference by cell products have been demonstrated in vitro. They are interferon1 and viral inhibitory factor2, the latter possibly being a variety of interferon. Both at least have in common the fact that they are produced in cell cultures infected with virus, active virus in the case of the latter, or inactivated where interferon is concerned. Other differences and similarities are discussed in a recent report by Ho and Enders3. It is well known that virus inhibitors are present in a variety of mammalian tissues and fluids4 and may be demonstrated either in vivo or in vitro."

Preliminary observations on the action of this organism on ethylene glycol and on inositol are also reported."
