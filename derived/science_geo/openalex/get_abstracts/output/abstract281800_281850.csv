https://openalex.org/W2015777324,"Large variability in recruitment of marine fishes creates challenging management problems. In northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), there is a significant linear relation between larval mortality rate and the frequency of calm, low wind speed periods during the spawning season, possibly because calm winds permit maintenance of concentrated patches of larval food. Neither cannibalism on larvae nor offshore transport contributed significantly to interannual variation in early larval mortality. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that wind-driven turbulent mixing affects variability in survival of young fish larvae. However, abundance of recruits does not necessarily reflect abundance of larvae surviving through this early stage."

https://openalex.org/W1601150853,"The climate changes believed to have occurred before this century have remained enigmatic, hampering our understanding of today's climatic changes. Reseachers trying to assess the human influence on the warming of the past century have commonly used complex ocean atmosphere models, but these models have their drawbacks. In his Perspective, Mann discusses a research article by Crowley, who has used a simple model driven by the most important natural and human-induced climate forcings to simulate climatic change over the last millennium. Comparing the model results with observations, Crowley makes what may be the most compelling case to date for the assertion that anthropogenic greenhouse gas increases are behind the dramatic continued warming of the globe."

In particular, the complex trigonometric and exponential functions explode into chaos as a parameter is varied. Numerical evidence is presented that supports the contention that these explosions occur whenever an elementary bifurcation occurs. This numerical evidence, in the form of computer graphics, is an example of the increasing importance of experimentation in mathematics research."

Effects of strong shaking were evident over a large area in southeastern Alaska. In Lituya Bay an enormous wave, possibly resulting from a rockslide, reached a maximum height of more than 1700 feet."
https://openalex.org/W2001548233,"The regular findings of a nodular perineuritis in peripheral nerve trunks and of a nodular polymyositis in skeletal muscles indicates the systemic nature of this disease. Rheumatoid arthritis is not solely a disease of the joints but a systemic disease, characterized by a widespread distribution of a nodular lymphocytic inflammation in peripheral nerves and skeletal muscles. The new findings in the nerves and muscles offer an explanation of the generally encountered clinical manifestations of pain, tenderness, trophic changes and muscular atrophy."
https://openalex.org/W1547365817,"A volleyball-court-sized patch of bright green algae in a San Diego lagoon has set off alarm bells among ecologists and officials. Scientists strongly suspect that the algae, Caulerpa taxifolia, is the same fast-growing, non-native clone that has swept over the northwestern Mediterranean sea floor in the past decade with devastating ecological consequences. A consortium of agencies and private groups has cordoned off the lagoon and is laying plans to poison the seaweed, marking the first major U.S. attempt to stop an incipient marine species invasion."

https://openalex.org/W1486060829,"According to the latest estimates by the U.S. Geological Survey, the world has 20% more oil awaiting discovery in yet-to-be-found fields than the USGS estimated 6 years ago. And a newly analyzed category--oil lurking in and around known fields--offers almost as much additional oil as in those undiscovered reservoirs. But even if the additional oil is really there, pessimists argue that it pushes back the global production peak--and the end of the era of cheap oil--by years, not decades."
https://openalex.org/W2040134750,Blood concentrations of penicillin were maintained at measurable levels for as long as seven or eight hours following single intramuscular injections of penicillin in the dog and in patients by means of vehicles containing 6 per cent. to 20 per cent. ossein gelatin and a long-acting vasoconstrictor drug. Intramuscular administration of penicillin can thus be carried on with three instead of eight injections per day with less variation in the extremes of penicillin blood levels.
https://openalex.org/W2071593885,"The gross features of nuclear morphology can be summarized as follows. Nuclei have shapes similar to a diffusesurfaced, liquid drop. The interior density is rather uniform, and also constant from nucleus to nucleus. The constancy of nuclear density implies an A((1/3)) law for the mean nuclear radius, the proportionality constant being 1.07 x 1O(-13) centimeter. The surface region is diffuse, the nuclear density falling from 90 to 10 percent of the central value in a distance of about 2.4 x 10(-13) centimeter, independently of nuclear mass number. Nuclear shapes can vary rather widely, with doubly magic nuclei preferring spherical symmetry. Some nuclei execute volume-preserving oscillations about spherical shape, while others possess permanent spheroidal deformations. The values of the deformation parameter, epsilon, for such spheroids possibly attains 0.85 for some light nuclei and 0.4 for some intermediate weight nuclei. There is some evidence, based on the occurrence of ""inversion"" spectra and asymmetrical fission, that pear-shaped nuclei may also exist."

He didn't. Mbeki's failure to acknowledge directly that HIV causes AIDS has angered the country's AIDS researchers; many visiting scientists also expressed their dismay."

The National Virtual Observatory will be an electronic web that gives astronomers access to terabytes of celestial data with the click of a mouse. The virtual observatory promises to make possible new analyses of the heavens by weaving together information from facilities around the world--and in space."

The results are now in. But the findings--that the work to date has had ""no significant effect"" on the rare rodents--have done little to resolve a debate that is expected to heat up again next year when the University of Arizona seeks permission to build four more telescopes."

The anomaly is subtle, and physicists caution that it might still be a statistical fluke. If confirmed, however, it could mark the long-sought discovery of a whole zoo of new particles--and the end of a long-standing model of particle physics."

On 28 June, the Marcel Mérieux Foundation, which funded the construction of the $8 million facility in Lyons, banned lab director Susan Fisher-Hoch from the premises and launched legal proceedings to dismiss her. Fisher-Hoch's most egregious offense, it appears, was speaking with the press."
