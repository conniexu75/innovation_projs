https://openalex.org/W2939749480,"CRISPR-Cas base-editor technology enables targeted nucleotide alterations, and is being increasingly used for research and potential therapeutic applications1,2. The most widely used cytosine base editors (CBEs) induce deamination of DNA cytosines using the rat APOBEC1 enzyme, which is targeted by a linked Cas protein-guide RNA complex3,4. Previous studies of the specificity of CBEs have identified off-target DNA edits in mammalian cells5,6. Here we show that a CBE with rat APOBEC1 can cause extensive transcriptome-wide deamination of RNA cytosines in human cells, inducing tens of thousands of C-to-U edits with frequencies ranging from 0.07% to 100% in 38-58% of expressed genes. CBE-induced RNA edits occur in both protein-coding and non-protein-coding sequences and generate missense, nonsense, splice site, and 5' and 3' untranslated region mutations. We engineered two CBE variants bearing mutations in rat APOBEC1 that substantially decreased the number of RNA edits (by more than 390-fold and more than 3,800-fold) in human cells. These variants also showed more precise on-target DNA editing than the wild-type CBE and, for most guide RNAs tested, no substantial reduction in editing efficiency. Finally, we show that an adenine base editor7 can also induce transcriptome-wide RNA edits. These results have implications for the use of base editors in both research and clinical settings, illustrate the feasibility of engineering improved variants with reduced RNA editing activities, and suggest the need to more fully define and characterize the RNA off-target effects of deaminase enzymes in base editor platforms."
https://openalex.org/W2939221602,"Complex topological configurations are fertile ground for exploring emergent phenomena and exotic phases in condensed-matter physics. For example, the recent discovery of polarization vortices and their associated complex-phase coexistence and response under applied electric fields in superlattices of (PbTiO3)n/(SrTiO3)n suggests the presence of a complex, multi-dimensional system capable of interesting physical responses, such as chirality, negative capacitance and large piezo-electric responses1-3. Here, by varying epitaxial constraints, we discover room-temperature polar-skyrmion bubbles in a lead titanate layer confined by strontium titanate layers, which are imaged by atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy. Phase-field modelling and second-principles calculations reveal that the polar-skyrmion bubbles have a skyrmion number of +1, and resonant soft-X-ray diffraction experiments show circular dichroism, confirming chirality. Such nanometre-scale polar-skyrmion bubbles are the electric analogues of magnetic skyrmions, and could contribute to the advancement of ferroelectrics towards functionalities incorporating emergent chirality and electrically controllable negative capacitance."
https://openalex.org/W2936706033,"Polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) are pathologically activated neutrophils that are crucial for the regulation of immune responses in cancer. These cells contribute to the failure of cancer therapies and are associated with poor clinical outcomes. Despite recent advances in the understanding of PMN-MDSC biology, the mechanisms responsible for the pathological activation of neutrophils are not well defined, and this limits the selective targeting of these cells. Here we report that mouse and human PMN-MDSCs exclusively upregulate fatty acid transport protein 2 (FATP2). Overexpression of FATP2 in PMN-MDSCs was controlled by granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor, through the activation of the STAT5 transcription factor. Deletion of FATP2 abrogated the suppressive activity of PMN-MDSCs. The main mechanism of FATP2-mediated suppressive activity involved the uptake of arachidonic acid and the synthesis of prostaglandin E2. The selective pharmacological inhibition of FATP2 abrogated the activity of PMN-MDSCs and substantially delayed tumour progression. In combination with checkpoint inhibitors, FATP2 inhibition blocked tumour progression in mice. Thus, FATP2 mediates the acquisition of immunosuppressive activity by PMN-MDSCs and represents a target to inhibit the functions of PMN-MDSCs selectively and to improve the efficiency of cancer therapy. The lipid transporter FATP2 reprograms neutrophils to polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells by mediating the uptake of arachidonic acid and promoting the synthesis of prostaglandin E2."
https://openalex.org/W2939806851,"In September 2017, Nigeria experienced a large outbreak of human monkeypox (HMPX). In this study, we report the outbreak experience and response in the Niger Delta University Teaching Hospital (NDUTH), Bayelsa state, where the index case and majority of suspected cases were reported.In a cross-sectional study between September 25th and 31st December 2017, we reviewed the clinical and laboratory characteristics of all suspected and confirmed cases of HMPX seen at the NDUTH and appraised the plans, activities and challenges of the hospital in response to the outbreak based on documented observations of the hospital's infection control committee (IPC). Monkeypox cases were defined using the interim national guidelines as provided by the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).Of 38 suspected cases of HMPX, 18(47.4%) were laboratory confirmed, 3(7.9%) were probable, while 17 (18.4%) did not fit the case definition for HMPX. Majority of the confirmed/probable cases were adults (80.9%) and males (80.9%). There was concomitant chicken pox, syphilis and HIV-1 infections in two confirmed cases and a case of nosocomial infection in one healthcare worker (HCW). The hospital established a make-shift isolation ward for case management, constituted a HMPX response team and provided IPC resources. At the outset, some HCWs were reluctant to participate in the outbreak and others avoided suspected patients. Some patients and their family members experienced stigma and discrimination and there were cases of refusal of isolation. Repeated trainings and collaborative efforts by all stakeholders addressed some of these challenges and eventually led to successful containment of the outbreak.While the 2017 outbreak of human monkeypox in Nigeria was contained, our report reveals gaps in outbreak response that could serve as lessons to other hospitals to strengthen epidemic preparedness and response activities in the hospital setting."
https://openalex.org/W2939414360,"The brains of humans and other mammals are highly vulnerable to interruptions in blood flow and decreases in oxygen levels. Here we describe the restoration and maintenance of microcirculation and molecular and cellular functions of the intact pig brain under ex vivo normothermic conditions up to four hours post-mortem. We have developed an extracorporeal pulsatile-perfusion system and a haemoglobin-based, acellular, non-coagulative, echogenic, and cytoprotective perfusate that promotes recovery from anoxia, reduces reperfusion injury, prevents oedema, and metabolically supports the energy requirements of the brain. With this system, we observed preservation of cytoarchitecture; attenuation of cell death; and restoration of vascular dilatory and glial inflammatory responses, spontaneous synaptic activity, and active cerebral metabolism in the absence of global electrocorticographic activity. These findings demonstrate that under appropriate conditions the isolated, intact large mammalian brain possesses an underappreciated capacity for restoration of microcirculation and molecular and cellular activity after a prolonged post-mortem interval."
https://openalex.org/W2936231094,"During the dawn of chemistry when the temperature of the young Universe had fallen below $\sim$4000 K, the ions of the light elements produced in Big Bang nucleosynthesis recombined in reverse order of their ionization potential. With its higher ionization potentials, He$^{++}$ (54.5 eV) and He$^+$ (24.6 eV) combined first with free electrons to form the first neutral atom, prior to the recombination of hydrogen (13.6 eV). At that time, in this metal-free and low-density environment, neutral helium atoms formed the Universe's first molecular bond in the helium hydride ion HeH$^+$, by radiative association with protons (He + H$^+$ $\rightarrow$ HeH$^+$ + h$\nu$). As recombination progressed, the destruction of HeH$^+$ (HeH$^+$ + H $\rightarrow$ He + H$_2^+$) created a first path to the formation of molecular hydrogen, marking the beginning of the Molecular Age. Despite its unquestioned importance for the evolution of the early Universe, the HeH$^+$ molecule has so far escaped unequivocal detection in interstellar space. In the laboratory, the ion was discovered as long ago as 1925, but only in the late seventies was the possibility that HeH$^+$ might exist in local astrophysical plasmas discussed. In particular, the conditions in planetary nebulae were shown to be suitable for the production of potentially detectable HeH$^+$ column densities: the hard radiation field from the central hot white dwarf creates overlapping Str\""omgren spheres, where HeH$^+$ is predicted to form, primarily by radiative association of He$^+$ and H. With the GREAT spectrometer onboard SOFIA, the HeH$^+$ rotational ground-state transition at $\lambda$149.1 $\mu$m is now accessible. We report here its detection towards the planetary nebula NGC7027."
https://openalex.org/W3099361495,"High-speed optical telecommunication is enabled by wavelength-division multiplexing, whereby hundreds of individually stabilized lasers encode information within a single-mode optical fibre. Higher bandwidths require higher total optical power, but the power sent into the fibre is limited by optical nonlinearities within the fibre, and energy consumption by the light sources starts to become a substantial cost factor1. Optical frequency combs have been suggested to remedy this problem by generating numerous discrete, equidistant laser lines within a monolithic device; however, at present their stability and coherence allow them to operate only within small parameter ranges2–4. Here we show that a broadband frequency comb realized through the electro-optic effect within a high-quality whispering-gallery-mode resonator can operate at low microwave and optical powers. Unlike the usual third-order Kerr nonlinear optical frequency combs, our combs rely on the second-order nonlinear effect, which is much more efficient. Our result uses a fixed microwave signal that is mixed with an optical-pump signal to generate a coherent frequency comb with a precisely determined carrier separation. The resonant enhancement enables us to work with microwave powers that are three orders of magnitude lower than those in commercially available devices. We emphasize the practical relevance of our results to high rates of data communication. To circumvent the limitations imposed by nonlinear effects in optical communication fibres, one has to solve two problems: to provide a compact and fully integrated, yet high-quality and coherent, frequency comb generator; and to calculate nonlinear signal propagation in real time5. We report a solution to the first problem. A low-power, fixed microwave signal in combination with an optical-pump signal generates an optical frequency comb that spans the whole wavelength range of the telecommunications C-band, with possible applications ranging from spectroscopy to optical communications."

https://openalex.org/W2936191024,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and nonmotor symptoms due to the selective loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. The evidence for a chronic inflammatory reaction mediated by microglial cells in the brain is particularly strong in PD. In our previous study, we have shown that brain-specific microRNA-124 (miR-124) is significantly down-regulated in the 1-methy1-4-pheny1-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse model of PD and that it can also inhibit neuroinflammation during the development of PD. However, further investigation is required to understand whether the abnormal expression of miR-124 regulates microglial activation. In this study, we found that the expression of sequestosome 1 (p62) and phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p-p38) showed a significant increase in LPS-treated immortalized murine microglial cell line BV2 cells in an MPTP-induced mouse model of PD. Knockdown of p62 could suppress the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and p-p38 of microglia. Besides, inhibition of p38 suppressed the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and promoted autophagy in BV2 cells. Moreover, our study is the first to identify a unique role of miR-124 in mediating the microglial inflammatory response by targeting p62 and p38 in PD. In the microglial culture supernatant transfer model, the knockdown of p62 in BV2 cells prevented apoptosis and death of human neuroblastoma cell lines SH-SY5Y (SH-SY5Y) cells following microglia activation. In addition, the exogenous delivery of miR-124 could suppress p62 and p-p38 expression and could also attenuate the activation of microglia in the substantia nigra par compacta of MPTP-treated mice. Taken together, our data suggest that miR-124 could inhibit neuroinflammation during the development of PD by targeting p62, p38, and autophagy, indicating that miR-124 could be a potential therapeutic target for regulating the inflammatory response in PD.—Yao, L., Zhu, Z., Wu, J., Zhang, Y., Zhang, H., Sun, X., Qian, C., Wang, B., Xie, L., Zhang, S., Lu, G.

https://openalex.org/W2937061741,"Lightning is a dangerous yet poorly understood natural phenomenon. Lightning forms a network of plasma channels propagating away from the initiation point with both positively and negatively charged ends-called positive and negative leaders1. Negative leaders propagate in discrete steps, emitting copious radio pulses in the 30-300-megahertz frequency band2-8 that can be remotely sensed and imaged with high spatial and temporal resolution9-11. Positive leaders propagate more continuously and thus emit very little high-frequency radiation12. Radio emission from positive leaders has nevertheless been mapped13-15, and exhibits a pattern that is different from that of negative leaders11-13,16,17. Furthermore, it has been inferred that positive leaders can become transiently disconnected from negative leaders9,12,16,18-20, which may lead to current pulses that both reconnect positive leaders to negative leaders11,16,17,20-22 and cause multiple cloud-to-ground lightning events1. The disconnection process is thought to be due to negative differential resistance18, but this does not explain why the disconnections form primarily on positive leaders22, or why the current in cloud-to-ground lightning never goes to zero23. Indeed, it is still not understood how positive leaders emit radio-frequency radiation or why they behave differently from negative leaders. Here we report three-dimensional radio interferometric observations of lightning over the Netherlands with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. We find small plasma structures-which we call 'needles'-that are the dominant source of radio emission from the positive leaders. These structures appear to drain charge from the leader, and are probably the reason why positive leaders disconnect from negative ones, and why cloud-to-ground lightning connects to the ground multiple times."
https://openalex.org/W2952423999,"NOD1 and NOD2 are intracellular sensors of bacterial peptidoglycan that belong to the Nod-like receptor family of innate immune proteins. In addition to their role as direct bacterial sensors, it was proposed that the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) proteins could detect endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced by thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic or endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase family that pumps Ca2+ into the ER, resulting in pro-inflammatory signaling. Here, we confirm that thapsigargin induces NOD-dependent pro-inflammatory signaling in epithelial cells. However, the effect was specific to thapsigargin, as tunicamycin and the subtilase cytotoxin SubAB from Shiga toxigenic Escherichia coli, which induce ER stress by other mechanisms, did not induce cytokine expression. The calcium ionophore A23187 also induced NOD-dependent signaling, and calcium chelators demonstrated a role for both intracellular and extracellular calcium in mediating thapsigargin-induced and NOD-dependent pro-inflammatory signaling, in part through the activation of plasma membrane-associated calcium release-activated channels. Moreover, our results demonstrate that both endocytosis and the addition of serum to the cell culture medium were required for thapsigargin-mediated NOD activation. Finally, we analyzed cell culture grade fetal calf serum as well as serum from laboratory mice using HPLC and MS identified the presence of various peptidoglycan fragments. We propose that cellular perturbations that affect intracellular Ca2+ can trigger internalization of peptidoglycan trace contaminants found in culture serum, thereby stimulating pro-inflammatory signaling. The presence of peptidoglycan in animal serum suggests that a homeostatic function of NOD signaling may have been previously overlooked.

https://openalex.org/W2914788993,"Livestock industries are vulnerable to disease threats, which can cost billions of dollars and have substantial negative social ramifications. Losses are mitigated through increased use of disease-related biosecurity practices, making increased biosecurity an industry goal. Currently, there is no industry-wide standard for sharing information about disease incidence or on-site biosecurity strategies, resulting in uncertainty regarding disease prevalence and biosecurity strategies employed by industry stakeholders. Using an experimental simulation game, with primarily student participants, we examined willingness to invest in biosecurity when confronted with disease outbreak scenarios. We varied the scenarios by changing the information provided about 1) disease incidence and 2) biosecurity strategy or response by production facilities to the threat of disease. Here we show that willingness to invest in biosecurity increases with increased information about disease incidence, but decreases with increased information about biosecurity practices used by nearby facilities. Thus, the type or context of the uncertainty confronting the decision maker may be a major factor influencing behavior. Our findings suggest that policies and practices that encourage greater sharing of disease incidence information should have the greatest benefit for protecting herd health."
https://openalex.org/W2937129315,"The Gram-negative bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) is the causal agent of rice bacterial leaf streak (BLS), one of the most destructive diseases of rice (Oryza sativa L.) that is the important staple crop. Xoc can invade host leaves via stomata and wounds and its type three secretion system (T3SS) is pivotal to its pathogenic lifestyle. In this study, using a novel dual RNA-seq approach, we examined transcriptomes of rice and Xoc in samples inoculated with wild type Xoc GX01 and its T3SS defective strain (T3SD), to investigate the global transcriptional changes in both organisms. Compared with T3SD strain, rice inoculated with wild type Xoc GX01 resulted in significant expression changes of a series of plant defence related genes, including ones altered in plant signalling pathway, and downregulated in phenylalanine metabolism, flavonoid and momilactone biosynthesis, suggesting repression of plant defence response and reduction in both callose deposition and phytoalexin accumulation. Also, some known transcription activator-like effector (TALE) targets were induced by Xoc GX01, e.g. OsSultr3;6 which contributes to rice susceptibility. Some cell elongation related genes, including several expansin genes, were induced by GX01 too, suggesting that Xoc may exploit this pathway to weaken cell wall strength, beneficial for bacterial infection. On the other hand, compared with wild type, the T3SD strain transcriptome in planta was characterized by downregulation of ATP, protein and polysaccharide synthesis, and upregulation of antioxidation and detoxification related genes, revealing that T3SD strain faced serious starvation and oxidation stresses in planta without a functional T3SS. In addition, comparative global transcript profiles of Xoc in planta and in medium revealed an upregulation of virulence factor synthesis and secretion in planta in favour of bacterial infection. Collectively, this study provides a comprehensive representation of cross talk between the host and bacterial pathogen, revealing insights into the Xoc-rice pathogenic dynamic and reveals novel strategies exploited by this important pathogen to cause disease."
https://openalex.org/W2938849305,"The bile acid (BA) nuclear receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR/NR1H4), maintains metabolic homeostasis by transcriptional control of numerous genes, including an intestinal hormone, fibroblast growth factor-19 (FGF19; FGF15 in mice). Besides activation by BAs, the gene-regulatory function of FXR is also modulated by hormone or nutrient signaling–induced post-translational modifications. Recently, phosphorylation at Tyr-67 by the FGF15/19 signaling–activated nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src was shown to be important for FXR function in BA homeostasis. Here, we examined the role of this FXR phosphorylation in cholesterol regulation. In both hepatic FXR-knockout and FXR-knockdown mice, reconstitution of FXR expression up-regulated cholesterol transport genes for its biliary excretion, including scavenger receptor class B member 1 (Scarb1) and ABC subfamily G member 8 (Abcg5/8), decreased hepatic and plasma cholesterol levels, and increased biliary and fecal cholesterol levels. Of note, these sterol-lowering effects were blunted by substitution of Phe for Tyr-67 in FXR. Moreover, consistent with Src’s role in phosphorylating FXR, Src knockdown impaired cholesterol regulation in mice. In hypercholesterolemic apolipoprotein E–deficient mice, expression of FXR, but not Y67F-FXR, ameliorated atherosclerosis, whereas Src down-regulation exacerbated it. Feeding or treatment with an FXR agonist induced Abcg5/8 and Scarb1 expression in WT, but not FGF15-knockout, mice. Furthermore, FGF19 treatment increased occupancy of FXR at Abcg5/8 and Scarb1, expression of these genes, and cholesterol efflux from hepatocytes. These FGF19-mediated effects were blunted by the Y67F-FXR substitution or Src down-regulation or inhibition. We conclude that phosphorylation of hepatic FXR by FGF15/19-induced Src maintains cholesterol homeostasis and protects against atherosclerosis.

https://openalex.org/W2952985828,"Background and aims The goal of the study was to assess calcium alone and Aquamin, a multi-mineral natural product that contains magnesium and detectable levels of 72 trace elements in addition to calcium, for capacity to affect growth and differentiation in colonoid cultures derived from histologically-normal human colon tissue. Methods Colonoid cultures were maintained in a low-calcium (0.25 mM) medium or in medium supplemented with an amount of calcium (1.5–3.0 mM), either from calcium alone or Aquamin for a period of two weeks. This was shown in a previous study to induce differentiation in colonoids derived from large adenomas. Changes in growth, morphological features and protein expression profile were assessed at the end of the incubation period using a combination of phase-contrast and scanning electron microscopy, histology and immunohistology, proteomic assessment and transmission electron microscopy. Results Unlike the previously-studied tumor-derived colonoids (which remained un-differentiated in the absence of calcium-supplementation), normal tissue colonoids underwent differentiation as indicated by gross and microscopic appearance, a low proliferative index and high-level expression of cytokeratin 20 in the absence of intervention (i.e., in control condition). Only modest additional changes were seen in these parameters with either calcium alone or Aquamin (providing up to 3.0 mM calcium). In spite of this, proteomic analysis and immunohistochemistry revealed that both interventions induced strong up-regulation of proteins that promote cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesive functions, barrier formation and tissue integrity. Transmission electron microscopy revealed an increase in desmosomes in response to intervention. Conclusions These findings demonstrate that colonoids derived from histologically normal human tissue can undergo differentiation in the presence of a low ambient calcium concentration. However, higher calcium levels induce elaboration of proteins that promote cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion. These changes could lead to improved barrier function and improved colon tissue health."
https://openalex.org/W2938194166,"Delivery of multiple neurotrophic factors (NTFs), especially with time-restricted release kinetics, holds great potential for nerve repair. In this study, we utilized the tetracycline-regulatable Tet-On 3G system to control the expression of c-Jun, which is a common regulator of multiple NTFs in Schwann cells (SCs). In vitro, Tet-On/c-Jun-modified SCs showed a tightly controllable secretion of multiple NTFs, including glial cell line-derived NTF, nerve growth factor, brain-derived NTF, and artemin, by the addition or removal of doxycycline (Dox). When Tet-On/c-Jun-transduced SCs were grafted in vivo, the expression of NTFs could also be regulated by oral administration or removal of Dox. Fluoro-Gold retrograde tracing results indicated that a biphasic NTF expression scheme (Dox+3/-9, NTFs were up-regulated for 3 wk and declined to physiologic levels for another 9 wk) achieved more axonal regeneration than continuous up-regulation of NTFs (Dox+12) or no NTF induction (Dox-12). More importantly, the Dox+3/-9-group animals showed much better functional recovery than the animals in the Dox+12 and Dox-12 groups. Our findings, for the first time, demonstrated drug-controllable expression of multiple NTFs in nerve repair cells both in vitro and in vivo. These findings provide new hope for developing an optimal therapeutic alternative for nerve repair through the time-restricted release of multiple NTFs using Tet-On/c-Jun-modified SCs.-Huang, L., Xia, B., Shi, X., Gao, J., Yang, Y., Xu, F., Qi, F., Liang, C., Huang, J., Luo, Z.

https://openalex.org/W2938677161,"BET bromodomain inhibitors block prostate cancer cell growth at least in part through c-Myc and androgen receptor (AR) suppression. However, little is known about other transcriptional regulators whose suppression contributes to BET bromodomain inhibitor anti-tumor activity. Moreover, the anti-tumor activity of BET bromodomain inhibition in AR-independent castration-resistant prostate cancers (CRPC), whose frequency is increasing, is also unknown. Herein, we demonstrate that BET bromodomain inhibition blocks growth of a diverse set of CRPC cell models, including those that are AR-independent or in which c-Myc is not suppressed. To identify transcriptional regulators whose suppression accounts for these effects, we treated multiple CRPC cell lines with the BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 and then performed RNA-sequencing followed by Master Regulator computational analysis. This approach identified several previously unappreciated transcriptional regulators that are highly expressed in CRPC and whose suppression, via both transcriptional or post-translational mechanisms, contributes to the anti-tumor activity of BET bromodomain inhibitors."

We sampled 91 individuals from both atractaspidine genera (Atractaspis and Homoroselaps). Additionally, we used ancestral-state reconstructions to investigate fang and diet evolution within Atractaspidinae and its sister lineage (Aparallactinae). Our results indicated that current classification of atractaspidines underestimates diversity within the group. Diversification occurred predominantly between the Miocene and Pliocene. Ancestral-state reconstructions suggest that snake dentition in these taxa might be highly plastic within relatively short periods of time to facilitate adaptations to dynamic foraging and life-history strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2940040548,"Amyloid deposition of WT human β2-microglobulin (WT-hβ2m) in the joints of long-term hemodialysis patients is the hallmark of dialysis-related amyloidosis. In vitro, WT-hβ2m does not form amyloid fibrils at physiological pH and temperature unless co-solvents or other reagents are added. Therefore, understanding how fibril formation is initiated and maintained in the joint space is important for elucidating WT-hβ2m aggregation and dialysis-related amyloidosis onset. Here, we investigated the roles of collagen I and the commonly administered anticoagulant, low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparin, in the initiation and subsequent aggregation phases of WT-hβ2m in physiologically relevant conditions. Using thioflavin T fluorescence to study the kinetics of amyloid formation, we analyzed how these two agents affect specific stages of WT-hβ2m assembly. Our results revealed that LMW-heparin strongly promotes WT-hβ2m fibrillogenesis during all stages of aggregation. However, collagen I affected WT-hβ2m amyloid formation in contrasting ways: decreasing the lag time of fibril formation in the presence of LMW-heparin and slowing the rate at higher concentrations. We found that in self-seeded reactions, interaction of collagen I with WT-hβ2m amyloid fibrils attenuates surface-mediated growth of WT-hβ2m fibrils, demonstrating a key role of secondary nucleation in WT-hβ2m amyloid formation. Interestingly, collagen I fibrils did not suppress surface-mediated assembly of WT-hβ2m monomers when cross-seeded with fibrils formed from the N-terminally truncated variant ΔN6-hβ2m. Together, these results provide detailed insights into how collagen I and LMW-heparin impact different stages in the aggregation of WT-hβ2m into amyloid, which lead to dramatic effects on the time course of assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2937942075,"Alterations of structure and density of cortical bone are associated with fragility fractures and can be assessed in vivo in humans at the tibia. Bone remodeling deficits in aging women have been recently linked to an increase in size of cortical pores. In this ex vivo study, we characterized the cortical microarchitecture of 19 tibiae from human donors (aged 69 to 94 years) to address, whether this can reflect impairments of the mechanical competence of the proximal femur, i.e., a major fracture site in osteoporosis. Scanning acoustic microscopy (12 μm pixel size) provided reference microstructural measurements at the left tibia, while the bone vBMD at this site was obtained using microcomputed tomography (microCT). The areal bone mineral density of both left and right femoral necks (aBMDneck) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), while homogenized nonlinear finite element models based on high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography provided hip stiffness and strength for one-legged standing and sideways falling loads. Hip strength was associated with aBMDneck (r = 0.74 to 0.78), with tibial cortical thickness (r = 0.81) and with measurements of the tibial cross-sectional geometry (r = 0.48 to 0.73) of the same leg. Tibial vBMD was associated with hip strength only for standing loads (r = 0.59 to 0.65). Cortical porosity (Ct.Po) of the tibia was not associated with any of the femoral parameters. However, the proportion of Ct.Po attributable to large pores (diameter > 100 μm) was associated with hip strength in both standing (r = -0.61) and falling (r = 0.48) conditions. When added to aBMDneck, the prevalence of large pores could explain up to 17% of the femur ultimate force. In conclusion, microstructural characteristics of the tibia reflect hip strength as well as femoral DXA, but it remains to be tested whether such properties can be measured in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2938157536,"There is considerable debate regarding whether mandibular morphology in ungulates primarily reflects phylogenetic affinities or adaptation to specific diet. In an effort to help resolve this debate, we use three-dimensional finite element analysis (FEA) to assess the biomechanical performance of mandibles in eleven ungulate taxa with well-established but distinct dietary preferences. We found notable differences in the magnitude and the distribution of von Mises stress between Artiodactyla and Perissodactyla, with the latter displaying lower overall stress values. Additionally, within the order Artiodactyla the suborders Ruminantia and Tylopoda showed further distinctive stress patterns. Our data suggest that a strong phylogenetic signal can be detected in biomechanical performance of the ungulate mandible. In general, Perissodactyla have stiffer mandibles than Artiodactyla. This difference is more evident between Perissodactyla and ruminant species. Perissodactyla likely rely more heavily on thoroughly chewing their food upon initial ingestion, which demands higher bite forces and greater stress resistance, while ruminants shift comminution to a later state (rumination) where less mechanical effort is required by the jaw to obtain sufficient disintegration. We therefore suggest that ruminants can afford to chew sloppily regardless of ingesta, while hindgut fermenters cannot. Additionally, our data support a secondary degree of adaptation towards specific diet. We find that mandibular morphologies reflect the masticatory demands of specific ingesta within the orders Artiodactyla and Perissodactyla. Of particular note, stress patterns in the white rhinoceros (C. simum) look more like those of a general grazer than like other rhinoceros’ taxa. Similarly, the camelids (Tylopoda) appear to occupy an intermediate position in the stress patterns, which reflects the more ancestral ruminating system of the Tylopoda."
https://openalex.org/W2937471872,"Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT) is present in a significant number of adult humans and can be activated by exposure to cold. Measurement of active BAT presence, activity, and volume are desirable for determining the efficacy of potential treatments intended to activate BAT. The repeatability of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) measurements of BAT presence, activity, and volume under controlled conditions has not been extensively studied. Eleven female volunteers underwent double baseline FDG PET imaging performed following a simple, regional cold intervention intended to activate brown fat. The cold intervention involved the lightly-clothed participants intermittently placing their feet on a block of ice while sitting in a cooled room. A repeat study was performed under the same conditions within a target of two weeks. FDG scans were obtained and maximum standardized uptake value adjusted for lean body mass (SULmax), CT Hounsfield units (HU), BAT metabolic volume (BMV), and total BAT glycolysis (TBG) were determined according to the Brown Adipose Reporting Criteria in Imaging STudies (BARCIST) 1.0. A Lin’s concordance correlation (CCC) of 0.80 was found for BMV between test and retest imaging. Intersession BAT SULmax was significantly correlated (r = 0.54; p < 0.05). The session #1 mean SULmax of 4.92 ± 4.49 g/mL was not significantly different from that of session #2 with a mean SULmax of 7.19 ± 7.34 g/mL (p = 0.16). BAT SULmax was highly correlated with BMV in test and retest studies (r ≥ 0.96, p < 0.001). Using a simplified ice-block cooling method, BAT was activated in the majority (9/11) of a group of young, lean female participants. Quantitative assessments of BAT SUL and BMV were not substantially different between test and retest imaging, but individual BMV could vary considerably. Intrasession BMV and SULmax were strongly correlated. The variability in estimates of BAT activity and volume on test-retest with FDG should inform sample size choice in studies quantifying BAT physiology and support the dynamic metabolic characteristics of this tissue. A more sophisticated cooling method potentially may reduce variations in test-retest BAT studies."

Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), color vision, contrast sensitivity, fundus and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) photography, automated visual field (VF) test, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were performed: prior to starting; every month during administration, and 1 month after stoppage. We longitudinally compared visual function and structure with the baseline and identified the occurrence of subclinical toxicity.BCVA, color vision, and contrast sensitivity showed no change from the baseline. Mean temporal RNFL thickness was significantly increased at 6 months (p = 0.014). Subclinical toxicity was found in 22 eyes of 14 patients (i.e., 13% of 168 eyes), in the forms of VFI decrease (VF index, 9 eyes of 6 patients), quadrant RNFL thickness increase (5 eyes of 4 patients), and VF pattern defect (12 eyes of 6 patients). 73% of the patients showed recovery to the baseline at 1 month post-stoppage. The risk factors for occurrence of subclinical toxicity were age, cumulative dose, and medication duration.Mean temporal RNFL thickness increased after administration. The VFI, quadrant RNFL thickness, and VF pattern defect could prove useful in assessment of subclinical toxicity. Medication duration was shown to be a strong risk factor for occurrence of subclinical toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2938093132,"Inadequate quality of care in healthcare facilities is one of the primary causes of patient mortality in low- and middle-income countries, and understanding the behavior of healthcare providers is key to addressing it. Much of the existing research concentrates on improving resource-focused issues, such as staffing or training, but these interventions do not fully close the gaps in quality of care. By contrast, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the full contextual and internal drivers–such as social norms, beliefs, and emotions–that influence the clinical behaviors of healthcare providers. We aimed to provide two conceptual frameworks to identify such drivers, and investigate them in a facility setting where inadequate quality of care is pronounced. Using immersion interviews and a novel decision-making game incorporating concepts from behavioral science, we systematically and qualitatively identified an extensive set of contextual and internal behavioral drivers in staff nurses working in reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health (RMNCH) in government public health facilities in Uttar Pradesh, India. We found that the nurses operate in an environment of stress, blame, and lack of control, which appears to influence their perception of their role as often significantly different from the RMNCH program’s perspective. That context influences their perceptions of risk for themselves and for their patients, as well as self-efficacy beliefs, which could lead to avoidance of responsibility, or incorrect care. A limitation of the study is its use of only qualitative methods, which provide depth, rather than prevalence estimates of findings. This exploratory study identified previously under-researched contextual and internal drivers influencing the care-related behavior of staff nurses in public facilities in Uttar Pradesh. We recommend four types of interventions to close the gap between actual and target behaviors: structural improvements, systemic changes, community-level shifts, and interventions within healthcare facilities."
https://openalex.org/W2939819285,"Aβ1–42 is involved in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis and is prone to glycation, an irreversible process where proteins accumulate advanced glycated end products (AGEs). N∈-(Carboxyethyl)lysine (CEL) is a common AGE associated with AD patients and occurs at either Lys-16 or Lys-28 of Aβ1–42. Methyglyoxal is commonly used for the unspecific glycation of Aβ1–42, which results in a complex mixture of AGE-modified peptides and makes interpretation of a causative AGE at a specific amino acid residue difficult. We address this issue by chemically synthesizing defined CEL modifications on Aβ1–42 at Lys-16 (Aβ-CEL16), Lys-28 (Aβ-CEL28), and Lys-16 and -28 (Aβ-CEL16&28). We demonstrated that double-CEL glycations at Lys-16 and Lys-28 of Aβ1–42 had the most profound impact on the ability to form amyloid fibrils. In silico predictions indicated that Aβ-CEL16&28 had a substantial decrease in free energy change, which contributes to fibril destabilization, and a increased aggregation rate. Single-CEL glycations at Lys-28 of Aβ1–42 had the least impact on fibril formation, whereas CEL glycations at Lys-16 of Aβ1–42 delayed fibril formation. We also tested these peptides for neuronal toxicity and mitochondrial function on a retinoic acid-differentiated SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line (RA-differentiated SH-SY5Y). Only Aβ-CEL16 and Aβ-CEL28 were neurotoxic, possibly through a nonmitochondrial pathway, whereas Aβ-CEL16&28 showed no neurotoxicity.

Aβ1–42 peptides are released extracellularly after being enzymatically processed from the amyloid precursor protein and are prone to aggregation. Aggregated Aβ1–42 eventually forms amyloid plaques and causes neuronal dysfunction (1Goedert M. Spillantini M.G.

As aging is a major risk factor for AD development, this natural process of aging also ubiquitously produces advanced glycated end products (AGEs), which are a type of post-translational modification (glycation). Several seminal studies provide evidence of increased AGE modifications that are associated with AD brains (2Sasaki N. Fukatsu R. Tsuzuki K. Hayashi Y. Yoshida T. Fujii N. Koike T. Wakayama I.

Several key studies have showed that a common and major species of AGE, N∈-(carboxyethyl)lysine (CEL), had elevated levels in AD brain samples relative to age-matched controls (11Pamplona R. Dalfó E.

Although CEL is one of the most common forms of MG-derived AGE associated with AD, there are other MG-derived AGEs such as argpyrimidine, MG imidazolone, and MG-lysine dimmer (MOLD) (16Takeuchi M.

Despite this, the physiological significance of these MG-derived AGEs has not been as extensively explored as CEL. Arginine (Arg-5) on Aβ is also a glycation site, however, there is evidence to suggest a preferential glycation at Lys residues by MG (17Fica-Contreras S.M. Shuster S.O. Durfee N.D. Bowe G.J.K.

At this stage, however, very little is known about the effect of site-specific CEL modifications and whether there is a major species of AGE that contributes to neuronal toxicity more than another does. Despite mounting evidence that the increase in CEL modifications on Aβ1–42 were associated with AD, studies have glycated Aβ1–42 with MG to produce unspecific AGEs at different amino acid groups (17Fica-Contreras S.M.

This nonspecific method of glycation makes it difficult to associate a particular AGE modification to toxicity as seen in in vitro studies (20Li X.-H. Du L.-L. Cheng X.-S. Jiang X. Zhang Y. Lv B.-L.

Therefore, our current study addresses issues of nonspecific AGE modifications by using organic (21Gruber P. Hofmann T.

First, we biophysically characterized the CEL modifications relative to unglycated Aβ1–42 by observing peptide morphology with transmission EM (TEM). Following this, we investigated the molecular peptide behavior by calculating the free energy associated with the addition or removal of each peptide from a pentameric stack. We also used the thioflavin T (ThT) assay to measure the kinetics of peptide aggregation, as well as CD to quantify peptide secondary structure. Next, we assessed the in vitro effect of these three CEL-glycated Aβ1–42 on a retinoic acid (RA)-differentiated human neuroblastoma cell line (RA-differentiated SH-SY5Y), which parallels the behavior and phenotype of mature neurons (22Kovalevich J. Langford D. Considerations for the use of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells in neurobiology.Methods Mol.

Our cell culture data investigated overall cell health using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release (necrosis), and caspase 3/7 activity (apoptosis). We then focused on the effect of the CEL modifications on neuronal mitochondrial function. Mitochondrial dysfunction is an important “cellular switch” that precedes AD pathogenesis (23Lin M.T. Beal M.F. Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases.Nature. 2006; 443 (17051205): 787-79510.1038/nature05292Crossref PubMed Scopus (4623) Google Scholar). It is known that unglycated Aβ affects mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), mitochondrial swelling, mitochondrial superoxide (O2⨪) production, and mitochondrial respiration (24Reddy P.H. Beal M.F. Amyloid β, mitochondrial dysfunction and synaptic damage: implications for cognitive decline in aging and Alzheimer’s disease.Trends Mol.

Hence, we chose to investigate the effect of the three CEL-glycated Aβ1–42 on these four mitochondrial parameters. Unglycated Aβ1–42 is known to form fibrils in 10 mm HCl at 37 °C within 24 h (25Stine W.B. Jungbauer L. Yu C. LaDu M. Preparing synthetic Aβ in different aggregation states.Methods Mol. Biol. 2011; 670: 13-3210.1007/978-1-60761-744-0_2Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). We quantified whether site-specific CEL modifications on Aβ1–42 were able to form fibrils to the same extent as unglycated Aβ1–42 under the same experimental conditions. We assessed different aggregate species of the peptides with quantitative TEM across 5 days. The three main aggregate species we considered were fibrils, protofibrils, and oligomers as outlined in Fig. S2. At day 0, when the lyophilized peptides were freshly resuspended in the fibril-promoting solution, all peptides had >80% oligomers, with protofibrils making up the remaining aggregate species (Fig. 1, C–F). Negligible amounts of fibrils were seen at day 0 across all peptides. At day 1, Aβ1–42 and Aβ-CEL28 had a high proportion of fibrils (>60%) followed by a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in oligomers. In contrast, at day 1, Aβ-CEL16 and Aβ-CEL16&28 had a low proportion of fibrils without a significant decrease in oligomers. This high proportion of fibrils and low proportion of oligomers exhibited by Aβ1–42 and Aβ-CEL28 was maintained until day 5 without a significant change in the proportion of protofibrils. However, only Aβ1–42 had a significant increase in protofibrils by day 5 (p < 0.05). Conversely, Aβ-CEL16 and Aβ-CEL16&28 maintained a low proportion of fibrils and high proportion of oligomers until day 5, with the exception of Aβ-CEL16 displaying a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in oligomers by day 5. The proportion of oligomers for Aβ-CEL16&28 remains unchanged by day 5. The proportion of protofibrils remains unaffected across all days for Aβ-CEL16 and Aβ-CEL16&28. Aβ-CEL16&28 displayed a greater variation in the aggregate species profile across all days compared with all peptides. There were no observable differences when comparing the TEM micrographs at day 5 between Aβ1–42 and Aβ-CEL28. However, at day 5, Aβ-CEL16 appears to have slightly different aggregate species relative to Aβ1–42, with Aβ-CEL16&28 having the least likeness to Aβ1–42. Thus, a double-CEL modification at both Lys-16 and Lys-28 affects peptide morphology and appears to either prevent the elongation of fibrils or promote the fragmentation of fibrils, whereas a single-CEL modification at Lys-16 slows down the rate of oligomer conversion to either fibrils or protofibrils. Conversely, a single-CEL modification at Lys-28 does not significantly affect peptide morphology relative to the unglycated Aβ1–42. To estimate the propensity of the CEL-glycated Aβ1–42 to aggregate into protofibrillar structures via a simple elongation mechanism, we utilized computational free energy calculations. Umbrella sampling was employed to determine the free energy change, ΔGbind, upon addition of an Aβ1–42 monomer to a 4-monomer protofibril model based on NMR structure PDB code 2BEG (26Lührs T. Ritter C. Adrian M. Riek-Loher D. Bohrmann B. Döbeli H. Schubert D. Riek R. 3D structure of Alzheimer’s amyloid-β(1–42) fibrils.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The same four single- and double-glycated Aβ variants were tested, with all Aβ1–42 monomers exhibiting the same glycation state for each simulation such that the fibril was homogeneous, analogous to the experimental studies. The results of these simulations are presented in Fig. 2A, with the full potential of mean force curves available in Fig. S3. CEL-glycation impacts ΔGbind in a manner that depends on the location of the CEL. Glycation at Lys-16 results in a ΔGbind that is 37% lower than the unglycated Aβ1–42 ΔGbind, and glycation at Lys-16 and -28 decreases the ΔGbind by 64% of the unglycated Aβ1–42, suggesting that glycation at these positions destabilizes the formation of the fibril or protofibril structure. The proportion of oligomer in the day 5 TEM images (Fig. 1, C–F) mirrors the calculated ΔGbind values, with the two models with less negative ΔGbind values, Aβ-CEL16 and Aβ-CEL16&28, both exhibiting much larger proportions of oligomer relative to Aβ1–42 and Aβ-CEL28. We also explored the rate of fibril aggregation, another crucial aspect that contributes to peptide morphology and behavior. By utilizing the proposed mathematical models for Aβ1–42 self-assembly in AmyloFit (27Meisl G. Kirkegaard J.B. Arosio P. Michaels T.C. Vendruscolo M. Dobson C.M. Linse S. Knowles T.P. Molecular mechanisms of protein aggregation from global fitting of kinetic models.Nat. Protocols. 2016; 11 (26741409): 252-27210.1038/nprot.2016.010Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), we assessed the kinetics of peptide aggregation using the ThT assay, with representative ThT plots available in Fig. S4. We plotted the half-time (t½; time to reach half the maximum ThT signal) of each peptide against their starting monomeric peptide concentrations (0.2 to 5 μm) (Fig. 2B). The slope of each fitted line indicates the rate of fibril aggregation (28Meisl G. Rajah L. Cohen S.A.I. Pfammatter M. Šarić A. Hellstrand E. Buell A.K. Aguzzi A. Linse S. Vendruscolo M. Dobson C.M. Knowles T.P.J. Scaling behaviour and rate-determining steps in filamentous self-assembly.Chem. Sci. 2017; 8 (29147538): 7087-709710.1039/C7SC01965CCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results show that the rate of fibril aggregation for Aβ1–42 (−1.17) was slower compared with Aβ-CEL16 (−0.65) and Aβ-CEL28 (−0.76), with Aβ-CEL16&28 (−0.34) being the fastest. Furthermore, we note that the rate of aggregation is saturated at >1 μm for Aβ1–42, Aβ-CEL16, and Aβ-CEL28, whereas Aβ-CEL28 is saturated at >3 μm. Amyloid fibrils are known to be rich in secondary structures like β-sheets and differences in peptide secondary structure can affect tertiary and quarternary structure. Here, we used CD to collect the far-UV peptide spectra (Fig. 2C, inset). Then, we used a spectral deconvolution software specific to analyzing Aβ1–42 spectra, BeStSel (29Micsonai A. Wien F. Kernya L. Lee Y.-H. Goto Y. Réfrégiers M. Kardos J. Accurate secondary structure prediction and fold recognition for circular dichroism spectroscopy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Upon spectral deconvolution, our results indicate that the β-sheet secondary structure was the most abundant secondary structure. The “other” secondary structures may include 310-helix, π-helix, β-bridge, bend, loop/irregular, and/or invisible regions of peptide (29Micsonai A. Wien F. Kernya L. Lee Y.-H. Goto Y. Réfrégiers M. Kardos J. Accurate secondary structure prediction and fold recognition for circular dichroism spectroscopy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2015; 112 (26038575): E3095-E310310.1073/pnas.1500851112Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). We observed that Aβ-CEL16 had a significant decrease (p < 0.05) of β-sheet content (27.2%) relative to Aβ1–42 (33.5%), and a significant increase (p < 0.05) of other secondary structures (49.7%) relative to all peptides (Fig. 2C). There was no significant difference in α-helix and β-turn secondary structures between CEL-glycated peptides and the unglycated Aβ1–42. Despite Aβ-CEL16&28 having altered aggregate species, free energy of release, and rate of fibril aggregation, the secondary structure of Aβ-CEL16&28 remains unchanged compared with both Aβ1–42 and Aβ-CEL28. To investigate the overall status of cell health after 24 h of 10 μm peptide treatment, we measured MTT reduction, extracellular LDH release (necrosis), and extracellular caspase 3/7 activity (apoptosis) in RA-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. MTT reduction is commonly used to determine both mitochondrial function and cellular redox activity where both parameters contribute to the reduction of the MTT dye (30Bernas T. Dobrucki J. Mitochondrial and nonmitochondrial reduction of MTT: interaction of MTT with TMRE, JC-1, and NAO mitochondrial fluorescent probes.Cytometry. 2002; 47 (11933013): 236-24210.1002/cyto.10080Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 31Liu Y. Peterson D.A. Kimura H. Schubert D. Mechanism of cellular 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction.J. Neurochem. 1997; 69 (9231715): 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). The amount of MTT dye reduced is proportional to the colorimetric product. Treatment with Aβ1–42, Aβ-CEL16, and Aβ-CEL28 significantly decreased MTT reduction relative to the vehicle control (Fig. 3A) and this decrease in MTT reduction occurred independent of a change in basal levels of necrosis and apoptosis (Fig. 3, B and C). We did not observe abnormal cell morphologies after peptide treatment. Aβ-CEL16&28 did not affect MTT reduction, LDH release, or caspase 3/7 activity. After investigating the overall cell health, we were interested in whether the CEL-glycated peptides had any specific effects on mitochondrial function. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated as an important molecular initiator that precedes AD pathogenesis (23Lin M.T. Beal M.F. Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases.Nature. 2006; 443 (17051205): 787-79510.1038/nature05292Crossref PubMed Scopus (4623) Google Scholar, 24Reddy P.H.

We assessed mitochondrial function with a mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) fluorophore, JC-10, and observed a significant drop in the proportion of cells with polarized ΔΨm upon treatment with Aβ-CEL16&28 relative to Aβ1–42, Aβ-CEL16, and Aβ-CEL28 (Fig. 4A). This drop in ΔΨm was independent of mitochondrial swelling and O2⨪ production. Mitochondrial swelling and O2⨪ production are two other parameters implicated in mitochondrial dysfunction as measured by using MitoTracker Green and MitoSOX, respectively (Fig. 4, B and C). MitoTracker Green accumulates proportionally in the matrix of mitochondria and the CEL-glycated peptides did not cause a change in mitochondrial volume (and hence swelling), unlike the unglycated Aβ1–42 (Fig. 4B). Similarly, MitoSOX is specific to O2⨪ produced in the mitochondria and we did not observe a significant change in mitochondrial O2⨪ production when treated with the CEL-glycated peptides. However, the unglycated Aβ1–42 caused a significant increase in mitochondrial O2⨪ production (Fig. 4C). Mitochondrial respiration is important for maintaining overall cell health by meeting the bioenergetic demand. Unglycated Aβ1–42 is known to affect mitochondrial respiration (32Caspersen C. Wang N. Yao J. Sosunov A. Chen X. Lustbader J.W. Xu H.W. Stern D. McKhann G. Yan S.D. Mitochondrial Aβ: a potential focal point for neuronal metabolic dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease.FASEB J. 2005; 19 (16210396): 2040-204110.1096/fj.05-3735fjeCrossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar) and we questioned whether CEL-glycated peptides had an effect to the same extent as unglycated Aβ1–42. We used high-resolution respirometry to measure mitochondrial respiration in permeabilized cells treated with 10 μm peptide for 24 h. We titrated mitochondrial respiration substrates that support the electron transport system (Fig. S6A). Oxygen consumption was also corrected for mitochondrial volume. See Fig. S6B for oxygen consumption relative to cell count. Our results indicated that unglycated Aβ1–42 lowered mitochondrial respiration across all respiration states, but was only statistically significant at CI under oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and CI+CII under uncoupled respiration (p < 0.05) (Fig. 5). Aβ-CEL16 increased mitochondrial respiration at CII and CI+CII under OXPHOS and CI+CII under uncoupled respiration. Aβ-CEL28 did not show any significant difference in mitochondrial respiration relative to the vehicle. Aβ-CEL16&28 showed no difference in respiration relative to the vehicle control. Overall, we observed that CEL modification"
https://openalex.org/W2935922406,"Anthropometric measures are commonly converted to age stratified z-scores to examine variation in growth outcomes in mixed-age and sex samples. For many study populations, z-scores will differ if calculated from World Health Organization (WHO) growth standards or within-population references. The specific growth reference used may influence statistical estimates of growth outcomes and their determinants, with implications for biological inference. We examined factors associated with growth outcomes in a sample of 152 Tsimane children aged 0-36 months. The Tsimane are a subsistence-scale population in the Bolivian Amazon with high rates of infectious disease and growth faltering. To examine the influence of growth reference on statistical inferences, we constructed multiple plausible models from available infant, maternal, and household attributes. We then ran identical models for height-for-age (HAZ), weight-for-age (WAZ), and weight-for-height (WHZ), with z-scores alternately calculated from WHO and robust Tsimane Lambda-Mu-Sigma growth curves. The distribution of WHO relative to Tsimane HAZ scores was negatively skewed, reflecting age-related increases in lower HAZ. Standardized coefficients and significance levels generally agreed across WHO and Tsimane models, although the strength and significance of specific terms varied in some models. Age was strongly, negatively associated with HAZ and WAZ in nearly all WHO, but not Tsimane models, resulting in consistently higher R2 estimates. Age and weaning effects were confounded in WHO models. Biased estimates of determinants associated with WHO HAZ may be more extreme in small samples and for variables that are strongly age-patterned. Additional methodological considerations may be warranted when applying WHO standards to within-population studies, particularly for populations with growth patterns known to systematically deviate from those of the WHO reference sample."
https://openalex.org/W2937322318,"We have developed a new method for selectively sorting droplets containing growing bacteria using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based RNA probe. Bacteria and the FRET-based RNA probe are encapsulated into nanoliter-scale droplets, which are incubated to allow for cell growth. The FRET-based RNA probe is cleaved by RNase derived from the bacteria propagated in the droplets, resulting in an increase in fluorescence intensity. The fluorescent droplets containing growing bacteria are distinguishable from quenching droplets, which contain no cells. We named this method FNAP-sort based on the use of a fluorescent nucleic acid probe in droplets for bacterial sorting. Droplets containing the FRET-based RNA probe and four species of pure cultures, which grew in the droplets, were selectively enriched on the basis of fluorescence emission. Furthermore, fluorescent droplets were sorted from more than 500,000 droplets generated using environmental soil bacteria and the FRET-based RNA probe on days 1, 3, and 7 with repeated incubation and sorting. The bacterial compositions of sorted droplets differed on days 1, 3, and 7; moreover, on day 7, the bacterial composition of the fluorescent droplets was drastically different from that of the quenching droplets. We believe that FNAP-sort is useful for high-throughput cultivation and sorting of environmental samples containing bacteria with various growth rates, including slow-growing microbes that require long incubation times."
https://openalex.org/W2939457231,"The ubiquitin-like, containing PHD and RING finger domains, 1 (UHRF1) protein recognizes DNA methylation and histone modification and plays a critical role in epigenetic regulation. Recently, UHRF1 was shown to have a role in DNA methylation in oocytes and early embryos. Here, we reveal that maternal UHRF1 determines the quality of mouse oocytes. We generated oocyte-specific Uhrf1-knockout mice and found that females were sterile, and few maternal UHRF1-null embryos developed into blastocysts. The UHRF1-null oocytes had an increased incidence of aneuploidy and DNA damage. In addition to defective DNA methylation, histone modification was affected during oogenesis, with UHRF1-null germinal vesicle and metaphase II-stage oocytes exhibiting reduced global histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation levels and elevated acetylation of histone H4 lysine 12. Taken together, our results suggest that UHRF1 plays an important role in determining oocyte quality and affects epigenetic regulation of oocyte maturation as a maternal protein, which is crucial for embryo developmental potential. Further exploration of the biologic function and underlying mechanisms of maternal UHRF1 will enhance our understanding of the maternal control of the oocyte and early embryonic development.—Cao, Y., Li, M., Liu, F., Ni, X., Wang, S., Zhang, H., Sui, X., Huo, R.

https://openalex.org/W2936678182,"The color red seems to be consistently associated with the concept of anger. Beyond semantic associations, it has been suggested that the color red enhances our ability to perceive anger in faces. However, previous studies often lack proper color control or the results are confounded by the presence of several emotions. Moreover, the magnitude of the (potential) effect of red has not been quantified. To address these caveats, we quantified the effect of facial color and background color on anger with psychometric functions measured with the method-of-constant-stimuli while facial hue or surround hue was varied in CIELAB color space. Stimulus sequences were generated by morphing between neutral and angry faces. For the facial color, the average chromaticity of the faces was shifted by ΔE 12/20 in red, yellow, green and blue directions. For the background color, the hue was either neutral or saturated red, green or blue. Both facial redness and surround redness enhanced perceived anger slightly, by 3-4 morph-%. Other colors did not affect perceived anger. As the magnitude of the enhancement is generally small and the effect is robust only in a small subset of the participants, we question the practical significance of red in anger recognition."

Handover prediction can overcome these challenges. In this paper, two novel prediction schemes are proposed. The first, depends on scanning the quality of all signals among mobile station and all nearby stations in the surrounding area, while the second one is based on a multi-criteria prediction decision using both the signal-to-noise ratio SNR value and station’s bandwidth. Moreover, the prediction efficiency is improved by reducing the number of redundant/ unnecessary handovers. The proposed schemes are evaluated using different scenarios with several mobile stations’ numbers, different WLAN access points, LTE-base station number & location, and random mobile station movement manner. The proposed schemes achieved a success rate of 99% with the different scenarios using LTE-WLAN architecture. The performance of the proposed prediction schemes outperformed the performance of the existing prediction schemes in terms of the accuracy percentage."

However, there are persisting inequities and barriers to sport participation that can prevent children and young people with diverse backgrounds and abilities from accessing these benefits. This mixed methods study investigated how diversity is understood, experienced and managed in junior sport. The study combined in-depth interviews (n = 101), surveys (n = 450) and observations over a three-year period. The results revealed that a focus on performance and competitiveness negatively affected junior sports clubs’ commitment to diversity and inclusive participation. Gender and a range of attitudes about diversity were also strongly related. On average, we found that those who identified as men were more likely to support a pro-performance stance, be homophobic, endorse stricter gender roles, and endorse violence as a natural masculine trait. In addition, those who identified as men were less likely to hold pro-disability attitudes. These findings suggest that the participation-performance tension and gender affect to what extent, and how, sports clubs engage children and young people with diverse backgrounds and abilities."

Here, we explore the funerary variability characterizing the late Iron Age site of Seminario Vescovile (SV: Verona, Italy, 3rd-1st c.

Patterns on funerary treatment (N = 125), δ13C and δ15N (N = 90), and linear enamel hypoplasia (N = 47) from SV are compared, and their possible association with sex and age-at-death further discussed. Results point to the presence at SV of variable funerary customs while at the same time demonstrating a rather homogenous diet and exposure to developmental stressors: funerary treatment is mainly correlated to age-at-death but do not appear to be associated to either isotopic patterns or hypoplasia frequencies. Accordingly, even if some weak social differentiation may have characterized the individuals buried at SV, this was not reflected in markedly differing living conditions. Our study is the first to attempt an exploration of the links between age, sex, funerary variability, and diet in a pre-Roman Celtic community from Italy. While highlighting the potential of a multifaceted approach in bioarcheology, it also points to a series of analytical and theoretical issues relevant when trying to disentangle the cultural and biological dimensions of social differentiation in the past."
https://openalex.org/W2937052054,"Recent work on microbiomes is revealing the wealth and importance of plant-microbe interactions. Microbial symbionts are proposed to have profound effects on fitness of their host plants and vice versa, especially when their fitness is tightly linked. Here we studied local adaptation of host plants and possible fitness contribution of such symbiosis in the context of abiotic environmental factors. We conducted a four-way multi-year reciprocal transplant experiment with natural populations of the perennial grass Festuca rubra s.l. from northern and southern Finland, Faroe Islands and Spain. We included F. rubra with and without transmitted symbiotic fungus Epichloë that is vertically transmitted via host seed. We found local adaptation across the European range, as evidenced by higher host fitness of the local geographic origin compared with nonlocals at three of the four studied sites, suggesting that selection pressures are driving evolution in different directions. Abiotic factors did not result in strong fitness effects related to Epichloë symbiosis, indicating that other factors such as herbivory are more likely to contribute to fitness differences between plants naturally occurring with or without Epichloë. Nevertheless, in the case of asymmetric symbiosis that is obligatory for the symbiont, abiotic conditions that affect performance of the host, may also cause selective pressure for the symbiont."
https://openalex.org/W2937214791,"Cardiac aging is characterized by myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, and diastolic dysfunction. Human kallikrein (hKLK1) protects against fibrosis in various pathogenic states. However, the effects of hKLK1 overexpression on cardiac aging-related fibrosis and the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Moreover, the role of hKLK1 in regulating macrophage function leading to cardiac fibrosis has not been investigated. Thus, in this study, we determined the effects of hKLK1 on cardiac aging and explored the mechanisms through which hKLK1 regulated aging-related fibrosis. Echocardiographic measurements showed that aging caused significant alternations in cardiac morphology, hypertrophy, and fibrosis in rats, and hKLK1 overexpression protected against aging-induced cardiac dysfunction. Compared with wild-type hearts, the hKLK1 transgene decreased the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and suppressed mitochondrial dysfunction and excess oxidative stress, leading to decreased recruitment and retention of alternatively activated (M2) macrophages and reduced secretion of profibrotic cytokines mediated by the TGF-β1–Smad3 signaling pathway in hearts of aging rats. Furthermore, these cardioprotective effects of hKLK1 overexpression were associated with the Janus kinase–signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 signaling pathway. H2O2-induced senescence promoted the differentiation of RAW264.7 cells into M2-type cells induced by IL-4 treatment. Bradykinin treatment relieved the migratory capacity of macrophages induced by H2O2. Thus, hKLK1 overexpression reduced cardiac fibrosis and improved aging-related cardiac dysfunction through reduced shift of macrophages to M2 macrophages, indicating that hKLK1 may alleviate aging-related cardiac dysfunction.—Hu, D., Dong, R., Yang, Y., Chen, Z., Tang, Y., Fu, M., Wang, D.

https://openalex.org/W2939228386,"Healthy mitochondria use an electrochemical gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) to generate energy in the form of ATP. A variety of endogenous and exogenous factors can lead to transient or sustained depolarization of the IMM, including mitochondrial fission events, expression of uncoupling proteins, electron transport chain (ETC) inhibitors, or chemical uncouplers. This depolarization in turn leads to a variety of physiological responses, ranging from selective mitochondrial clearance (mitophagy) to cell death. How cells recognize and ultimately respond to depolarized mitochondria remains incompletely understood. Here we show that the small GTPases RalA and RalB both relocalize to mitochondria following depolarization in a process dependent on clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). Furthermore, both genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of RalA and RalB leads to an increase in the activity of the atypical IκB kinase TBK1 both basally and in response to mitochondrial depolarization. This phenotype was also observed following inhibition of Ral relocalization. Collectively, these data suggest a model in which RalA and RalB inhibit TBK1 and that relocalization of Ral to depolarized mitochondria facilitates TBK1 activation through release of this inhibition."

However, the common causes of mortality in ENKTL remain unclear. We conducted a retrospective population-based cohort study to elucidate the different causes of mortality in ENKTL and illustrate the main causal and associated risk factors leading to death.The study included patients diagnosed with ENKTL from 1987 to 2014 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Univariate survival analysis was conducted using Kaplan-Meier analysis, and multivariate analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazards regression model. Competing-risks regression model was applied to estimate specific risks associated with mortality.The analysis demonstrated increased mortality in males and patients diagnosed at older age and higher disease stage. NHL was the most common cause of mortality in patients with ENKTL, accounting for 74.13% of deaths in the cohort, followed by other malignant cancers, heart diseases, and infection. However, NHL-specific death events were fewer in patients diagnosed with advanced disease stage compared with incidences of death by other causes such as disease of heart and infections. Significant difference was seen between patients diagnosed earlier than 2000, who showed a higher probability of dying from NHL, and those diagnosed later, who showed propensity to die from other malignant tumors and infection. No differences were found when comparing sex or age at diagnosis.The most common cause of mortality in cases with ENKTL-NT is NHL. The female sex, diagnosis at young age and early stage are associated with improved prognosis. Further, the classification of Ann Arbor stage and year of diagnosis can provide references of specific causes of death, which might help decrease the mortality rate."
https://openalex.org/W2938612257,"The Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) is a relatively simple test for detecting latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) but requires regular quality assurance to ensure proper technique for administration and reading. The objective of this study was to estimate the accuracy and reproducibility of an mhealth approach (the mTST) to measure the size of swelling immediately following TST administration (TST injection bleb) and after 48-72 hours (TST induration).Five non-clinical and one clinical reviewer measured the size of TST injection blebs, and TST indurations using smartphone acquired photos of sites of TST administration and readings in patients, or saline injections in volunteers. The reference standard was the onsite measurement (measured by an experienced TB nurse) of the actual TST injection bleb, or induration. Agreement of reviewers' measurements with the reference standard, as well as agreement within and between reviewers, was estimated using Cohen's kappa coefficient.Using the mTST method to assess bleb size in 64 photos of different TST injections, agreement between reviewers, and the reference standard was very good to excellent (κ ranged from 0.75 to 0.87), and within-reviewer reproducibility of readings was excellent (κ ranged from 0.86 to 0.96). Using the mTST method to assess TST induration in 72 photos, reviewers were able to detect no induration (<5mm) and induration of 15mm or greater with accuracy of 95% and 92% respectively, but accuracy was only 20% and 77% for reactions of 5-9mm and 10-14mm respectively.The mTST approach appears to be a reliable tool to assess TST administration. The mTST approach was accurate to read indurations of 0-4mm or 15+mm, but less accurate for reactions of 5-14mm. We believe the mTST approach could be useful for training and quality assurance in locations where on-site supervision is not possible."

Immunohistochemistry was achieved for each control and infected animal through eight coronal brain sections taken along the caudorostral axis of the brain (brainstem, cerebellum, diencephalon and telencephalon). Specific markers of astrocytes (anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein), microglial cells (anti-integrin alpha M) or neurons (anti-Neuronal Nuclei) were employed. The iNOS staining was present in neurons, astrocytes and microglial cells, but not in oligodendrocytes. Stained astrocytes and microglial cells resided mainly near the third cavity in the rostral part of brainstem (periaqueductal gray), diencephalon (thalamus and hypothalamus) and basal telencephalon. Stained neurons were scarce in basal telencephalon, contrasting with numerous iNOS-positive neuroglial cells. Contrarily, in dorsal telencephalon (neocortex and hippocampus), iNOS-positive neurons were plentiful, contrasting with the marked paucity of labelled neuroglial (astrocytes and microglial) cells.

We obtained data from WHO Mortality database, population denominators from the Barbados Statistical Service stratified by 10-year age group (ages 25-34 up to 85 plus), population-based risk factor surveys, Global Burden of Disease and Barbados' national myocardial infarction registry. Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed.In 1990 the age-standardized CHD mortality rate was 109.5 per 100,000 falling to 55.3 in 2012. Implementation of effective treatment accounted for 56% DPPs (95% (Uncertainty Interval (UI) 46%, 68%), mostly due to the introduction of treatments immediately after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (14%) and unstable angina (14%). Overall, risk factors contributed 19% DPPs (95% UI 6% to 34%) mostly attributed to decline in cholesterol (18% DPPs, 95% UI 12%, 26%). Adverse trends in diabetes: 14% additional deaths(ADs) 95% UI 8% to 21% ADs) and BMI (2% ADs 95%UI 0 to 5% ADs) limited potential for risk factor gains.Given the significant negative impact of obesity/diabetes on mortality in this analysis, research that explores factors affecting implementation of evidenced-based preventive strategies is needed. The fact that most of the decline in CHD mortality in Barbados was due to treatment provides an example for SIDs about the advantages of universal access to care and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2937733285,"After a difficult brain tumor surgery, refractory intracranial hypertension (RICH) may occur due to residual tumor or post-operative complications such as hemorrhage, infarction, and aggravated brain edema. We investigated which predictors are associated with prognosis when using barbiturate coma therapy (BCT) as a second-tier therapy to control RICH after brain tumor surgery. The study included adult patients who underwent BCT after brain tumor surgery between January 2010 and December 2016. The primary outcome was neurological status upon hospital discharge, which was assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). In the study period, 4,296 patients underwent brain tumor surgery in total. Of these patients, BCT was performed in 73 patients (1.7%). Among these 73 patients, 56 (76.7%) survived to discharge and 25 (34.2%) showed favorable neurological outcomes (GOS scores of 4 and 5). Invasive monitoring of intracranial pressure (ICP) was performed in 60 (82.2%) patients, and revealed that the maximal ICP within 6 h after BCT was significantly lower in patients with favorable neurological outcome as well as in survivors (p = 0.008 and p = 0.028, respectively). Uncontrolled RICH (ICP ≥ 22 mm Hg within 6 h of BCT) was an important predictor of mortality after BCT (adjusted hazard ratio 12.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.788-59.749), and in particular, ICP ≥ 15 mm Hg within 6 h of BCT was associated with poor neurological outcome (adjusted odds ratio 9.36, 95% CI 1.664-52.614). Therefore, early-controlled ICP after BCT was associated with clinical prognosis. There were no significant differences in the complications associated with BCT between the two neurological outcome groups. No BCT-induced death was observed. The active and timely control of RICH may be beneficial for clinical outcomes in patients with RICH after brain tumor surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2939509808,"Due to continuous evolution of biomedical data, biomedical ontologies are becoming larger and more complex, which leads to the existence of many overlapping information. To support semantic inter-operability between ontology-based biomedical systems, it is necessary to identify the correspondences between these information, which is commonly known as biomedical ontology matching. However, it is a challenge to match biomedical ontologies, which dues to: (1) biomedical ontologies often possess tens of thousands of entities, (2) biomedical terminologies are complex and ambiguous. To efficiently match biomedical ontologies, in this paper, an interactive biomedical ontology matching approach is proposed, which utilizes the Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) to implement the automatic matching process, and gets a user involved in the evolving process to improve the matching efficiency. In particular, we propose an Evolutionary Tabu Search (ETS) algorithm, which can improve EA’s performance by introducing the tabu search algorithm as a local search strategy into the evolving process. On this basis, we further make the ETS-based ontology matching technique cooperate with the user in a reasonable amount of time to efficiently create high quality alignments, and make use of EA’s survival of the fittest to eliminate the wrong correspondences brought by erroneous user validations. The experiment is conducted on the Anatomy track and Large Biomedic track that are provided by the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI), and the experimental results show that our approach is able to efficiently exploit the user intervention to improve its non-interactive version, and the performance of our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art semi-automatic ontology matching systems."
https://openalex.org/W2939805516,"Habitat valuation can provide an objective basis for the prioritisation of conservation and restoration actions. The attribution of fisheries production to particular habitat units is an important measure of value, but is difficult to estimate. Using the case study of habitat use by juvenile banana prawns in a tropical estuary, we assessed the potential to produce valid value estimates at two spatio-conceptual scales: estuary reach and whole estuary. Additionally, we also explore the potential to produce meaningful value estimates at the scale of whole estuary contribution to the offshore fisheries stock. A diversity of potential and actual sources of error and logical problems means that quantification at any scale is at best of uncertain validity and produces estimates that are likely to produce unreliable results if treated as quantitative inputs to production models. Estimates for the whole estuary were the most viable, although still requiring substantial assumptions that may or may not be reasonable in particular situations. Estimates for individual habitats required the unreasonable assumption of limited prawn movement, while estimates of contribution of an estuary to the fishery required difficult-to-obtain and usually unavailable information. Because low occupancy habitats can have trophic value, we also used stable isotope analysis to assess the importance of mangroves and saltmarshes to prawn nutrition. No particular habitat was of critical trophic importance, again suggesting that the habitat-production link is most usefully assessed at the whole-of-estuary scale. While valuable and required to support targeted ecosystem management and protection and restoration efforts, valid estimates of the contribution of particular units to fisheries are likely to be unachievable in many situations."
https://openalex.org/W2937374032,"Background and objectives HIV-infected patients are at risk for developing chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 ml/min/1.73m2. Our purpose was to understand the genesis of CKD in HIV patients from a large urban clinic in Houston, Texas, USA, and to characterize progression of CKD in the cohort. Design, setting, participants and measurements A retrospective cohort study (2012–2016) was conducted in all HIV-infected patients seen in a federally qualified community health center in Houston, Texas. CKD prevalence and its association with HIV viral load and CD4 count were determined. The association of the change in eGFR over time and comorbidities was assessed using linear mixed models. Results Of 3714 HIV-infected patients analyzed, 153 (4.1%) had CKD. The prevalence of CKD in the different racial groups was 5.4% White, 4.0% African American, 2.8% Hispanic/Latino and 3.2% Asian. There was no difference in the rate of decline in kidney function in White vs. African American HIV infected patients with CKD. Compared with non-CKD patients, CKD patients were older, had lived longer with HIV infection, had lower CD4 cell counts, higher proportions of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cerebrovascular disease, and had significantly higher rates of eGFR deterioration represented by a median decrease of 26.5% from first to last follow-up eGFR (versus 0% change). Linear mixed modeling identified older age, male gender, White race, longer time with HIV infection, hypertension, history of kidney stones, cerebrovascular disease, autoimmune disease, increased potassium and total cholesterol levels, and being treated with combination ART as associated with a worsening eGFR over time. Conclusion This study demonstrates a prevalence of CKD in HIV-infected patients of 4.1% and points to an important role for HIV medications and other common comorbidities in the genesis and progression of kidney disease. Importantly, CKD was not more prevalent in African Americans than in Whites, perhaps due to a low prevalence of IV drug abuse as inferred from the lower prevalence of HCV infection in this cohort."
https://openalex.org/W2938168363,"Aims Tramadol, a widely used analgesic drug, inhibits the reuptake of noradrenaline and serotonin impairing the aggregation function of thrombocytes. However, the risk for severe bleeding has previously not been studied. The aim of the present study is to investigate the association between tramadol and bleeding peptic ulcer in the Swedish population. Methods In this register based case–control study based on the Swedish national patient registry and prescription drug registry, we included 18 306 patients hospitalized with a first-time diagnosis of bleeding peptic ulcer. For every case, 4 matched controls were included. To investigate the temporal aspects of tramadol induced bleeding ulcer, exposure was divided into patients with newly initiated and ongoing treatment. To explore a possible confounding by indication, the effect of codeine, a drug also prescribed for the treatment of moderate pain, but not known to affect thrombocyte function, was investigated. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression was used to analyse the association between tramadol use and bleeding ulcer. Results Tramadol was associated with an increased risk of bleeding ulcer (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.1, 95% confidence interval: (2.0–2.3). The association was stronger for newly initiated treatment with tramadol 2.8 (2.5–3.2) and weaker for ongoing treatment 1.7 (1.6–1.9). Codeine was also associated with an increased risk of bleeding ulcer 1.9 (1.7–2.1) and this association was also stronger for newly initiated treatment with codeine 2.3 (2.0–2.6) and weaker for ongoing treatment 1.7 (1.5–1.9). Conclusion Treatment with tramadol was associated with an increased risk of bleeding peptic ulcer. Most of this association may be mediated by factors related to the pain condition rather than the pharmacologic effect per se."
https://openalex.org/W2939548772,"Drop foot is a frequent abnormality in gait after central nervous system lesions. Different treatment strategies are available to functionally restore dorsal extension during swing phase in gait. Orthoses as well as surface and implantable devices for electrical stimulation of the peroneal nerve may be used in patients who do not regain good dorsal extension. While several studies investigated the effects of implanted systems on walking speed and gait endurance, only a few studies have focussed on the system's impact on kinematics and long-term outcomes. Therefore, our aim was to further investigate the effects of the implanted system ActiGait on gait kinematics and spatiotemporal parameters for the first time with a 1-year follow-up period. 10 patients were implanted with an ActiGait stimulator, with 8 patients completing baseline and follow-up assessments. Assessments included a 10-m walking test, video-based gait analysis and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for health status. At baseline, gait analysis was performed without any assistive device as well as with surface electrical stimulation. At follow-up patients walked with the ActiGait system switched off and on. The maximum dorsal extension of the ankle at initial contact increased significantly between baseline without stimulation and follow-up with ActiGait (p = 0.018). While the spatio-temporal parameters did not seem to change much with the use of ActiGait in convenient walking speed, patients did walk faster when using surface stimulation or ActiGait compared to no stimulation at the 10-m walking test at their fastest possible walking speed. Patients rated their health better at the 1-year follow-up. In summary, a global improvement in gait kinematics compared to no stimulation was observed and the long-term safety of the device could be confirmed."
https://openalex.org/W2937490722,"Purpose To investigate the clinical significance of color visual acuity (CVA) in preperimetric glaucoma (PPG) and open-angle glaucoma (OAG). Methods A total of 123 eyes of 73 subjects (22 normal eyes, 14 PPG eyes, and 87 OAG eyes; mean age: 44.9 ± 10.1 years, age range: 21–64 years) were enrolled. CVA was tested for red, green-yellow, blue-green and blue-purple with a newly developed test. Results There was no statistical difference in clinical background factors, including age, sex, intraocular pressure, or spherical equivalent between the three groups. Red VA and blue-green VA were significantly worse in the OAG eyes than in the normal eyes (P = 0.008 and P = 0.015, respectively), although green-yellow VA and blue-purple VA were not significantly worse. Furthermore, red VA and blue-green VA were significantly correlated with MD in a group of eyes with either PPG or OAG (r = -0.23, P = 0.023; r = -0.25, P = 0.012, respectively), but green-yellow VA and blue-purple VA were not. Conclusion Red VA and blue-green VA were detectably worse in eyes with OAG, in close association with the degree of functional loss. This suggests that measuring CVA with the new color test described here may be a promising supplement to existing methods of detecting glaucoma and evaluating its severity."
https://openalex.org/W2937124479,"Recently available downscaled ocean climate models for the Bering Sea and Aleutian Arc offer the opportunity to assess climate vulnerability for upper trophic level consumers such as marine birds. We analyzed seasonal and annual spatial projections from three climate models for two physical climate variables (seawater temperature and sea ice) and three forage variables (large copepods, euphausiids, and benthic infauna), comparing projected conditions from a recent time period (2003–2012) to a future time period (2030–2039). We focused the analyses on core areas within globally significant Important Bird Areas, and developed indices of the magnitude of projected change and vulnerability agreement among models. All three climate models indicated a high degree of change for seawater temperature warming (highest in the central and eastern Aleutian Islands) and ice loss (most significant in the eastern Bering Sea) across scales, and we found those changes to be significant for every species and virtually every core area assessed. There was low model agreement for the forage variables; while the majority of core areas were identified as climate vulnerable by one or more models (72% for large copepods, 73% for euphausiids, and 94% for benthic infauna), very few were agreed upon by all three models (only 6% of euphausiid-forager core areas). Based on the magnitude-agreement score, euphausiid biomass decline affected core areas for fulmars, gulls, and auklets, especially along the outer shelf and Aleutian Islands. Benthic biomass decline affected eiders along the inner shelf, and large copepod decline was significant for storm-petrels and auklets in the western Aleutians. Overall, 12% of core areas indicated climate vulnerability for all variables assessed. Modeling and interpreting biological parameters to project future dynamics remains complex; the strong signal for projected physical changes raised concerns about lagged responses such as distribution shifts, breeding failures, mortality events, and population declines."
https://openalex.org/W2889888827,"Models of contagion dynamics, originally developed for infectious diseases, have proven relevant to the study of information, news, and political opinions in online social systems. Modelling diffusion processes and predicting viral information cascades are important problems in network science. Yet, many studies of information cascades neglect the variation in infectivity across different pieces of information. Here, we employ early-time observations of online cascades to estimate the infectivity of distinct pieces of information. Using simulations and data from real-world Twitter retweets, we demonstrate that these estimated infectivities can be used to improve predictions about the virality of an information cascade. Developing our simulations to mimic the real-world data, we consider the effect of the limited effective time for transmission of a cascade and demonstrate that a simple model for slow but non-negligible decay of the infectivity captures the essential properties of retweet distributions. These results demonstrate the interplay between the intrinsic infectivity of a tweet and the complex network environment within which it diffuses, strongly influencing the likelihood of becoming a viral cascade."
https://openalex.org/W2937617962,"This study compares the sleep architecture of patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with that of both patients with depression and subjects with no mental disorder.45 German armed forces personnel with PTSD, 72 German armed forces personnel with depression and 24 healthy control subjects underwent 24-hour polysomnography. The effects of group membership, medication and the statistical interaction of group and medication were analysed for the following variables: sleep onset latency, REM sleep latency, slow-wave sleep and REM sleep percentages.Sleep onset latency was significantly prolonged in both the PTSD and the depression group. Moreover, psychotropic medication was associated with significantly prolonged REM sleep latency.The impact on sleep onset latency is of special clinical relevance in that according to preliminary studies, it is of major importance for subjective sleep quality. In contrast to the other parameters, an increase in sleep onset latency results in a subjective reduction in sleep quality which can lead to hyperarousal and increased preoccupation with sleep, which in turn may lead to dysfunctional sleep patterns."
