https://openalex.org/W2089391938,Conditioned leg-flexion responses in dogs were developed with electric shock as an unconditioned stimulus and intestinal stimulation or the effects of injections of various drugs as conditioned stimuli. It is concluded that physiological effects can play a role in the development and maintenance of conditioned avoidance behavior.

Direct heating of this region with diathermy was shown to induce panting. In the goat, panting was found2 to continue for 1–2 min. after the end of 5 min. of electrical stimulation in the corresponding region of the brain, and to be effective in lowering the temperature of the animal. Moderate heating of this region in the cat and the rabbit was also found3 to reduce gamma motor activity. The present experiments serve to identify an efferent pathway from this temperature-sensitive region."

https://openalex.org/W2080700577,"THE use of tetrazolium salts in experimental and human pathology is valuable if the materials being examined are vital organs or tissues, for degenerating or dead tissue loses the ability to reduce tetrazolium salts1. The formation of formazan is widely used for the determination of general metabolism2. Since this enzyme reaction can only occur in the living cell, and as there are rather few methods for determining viability, the formation of formazan was investigated in ascites tumour cells during the process of degeneration in vitro."

https://openalex.org/W2021286469,Local introduction of atropine and dibenzyline into human skin was carried out by iontophoresis. Both thermoregulatory and emotional sweating were blocked by atropine but were not blocked by dibenzyline. It would seem that emotional sweating produced as a result of a physical stress situation is partly or predominately under cholinergic control.
https://openalex.org/W2028747579,"INCUBATION at 38° produces an increase in oxytocic activity in the acidified serum of normal rats (Croxatto, H. B., and Croxatto, H., unpublished work). Earlier studies have revealed that pepsitensin-like substances can be obtained from hypertensinogen under similar conditions1. This communication describes experiments carried out to determine some of the properties of the substance (or substances) extracted from acidified and incubated rat serum."
