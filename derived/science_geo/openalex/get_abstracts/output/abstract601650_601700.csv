Bilateral wounds were created in the palatal gingiva adjacent to maxillary molars of control rats and rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. After evaluating postsurgical wound closure by digital imaging, the maxillae including wounds were resected for histological examinations. mRNA expressions of angiogenesis, inflammation, and oxidative stress markers in the surgical sites were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Primary fibroblast culture from the gingiva of both rats was performed in high glucose and normal medium. In vitro wound healing and cell proliferation assays were performed. Oxidative stress marker mRNA expressions and reactive oxygen species production were measured. Insulin resistance was evaluated via PI3K/Akt and MAPK/Erk signaling following insulin stimulation using Western blotting. To clarify oxidative stress involvement in high glucose culture and cells of diabetic rats, cells underwent N-acetyl-L-cysteine treatment; subsequent Akt activity was measured. Wound healing in diabetic rats was significantly delayed compared with that in control rats. Nox1, Nox2, Nox4, p-47, and tumor necrosis factor-α mRNA levels were significantly higher at baseline in diabetic rats than in control rats. In vitro study showed that cell proliferation and migration significantly decreased in diabetic and high glucose culture groups compared with control groups. Nox1, Nox2, Nox4, and p47 expressions and reactive oxygen species production were significantly higher in diabetic and high glucose culture groups than in control groups. Akt phosphorylation decreased in the high glucose groups compared with the control groups. Erk1/2 phosphorylation increased in the high glucose groups, with or without insulin treatment, compared with the control groups. Impaired Akt phosphorylation partially normalized after antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine treatment. Thus, delayed gingival wound healing in diabetic rats occurred because of impaired fibroblast proliferation and migration. Fibroblast dysfunction may occur owing to high glucose-induced insulin resistance via oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2777797538,"The influence of motivation and alertness on brain activity associated with visual perception was studied experimentally using the Necker cube, which ambiguity was controlled by the contrast of its ribs. The wavelet analysis of recorded multichannel electroencephalograms (EEG) allowed us to distinguish two different scenarios while the brain processed the ambiguous stimulus. The first scenario is characterized by a particular destruction of alpha rhythm (8–12 Hz) with a simultaneous increase in beta-wave activity (20–30 Hz), whereas in the second scenario, the beta rhythm is not well pronounced while the alpha-wave energy remains unchanged. The experiments were carried out with a group of financially motivated subjects and another group of unpaid volunteers. It was found that the first scenario occurred mainly in the motivated group. This can be explained by the increased alertness of the motivated subjects. The prevalence of the first scenario was also observed in a group of subjects to whom images with higher ambiguity were presented. We believe that the revealed scenarios can occur not only during the perception of bistable images, but also in other perceptual tasks requiring decision making. The obtained results may have important applications for monitoring and controlling human alertness in situations which need substantial attention. On the base of the obtained results we built a brain-computer interface to estimate and control the degree of alertness in real time."

Accordingly, proper maintenance of CTs is vital for the prevention of LD. The aim of this study was to determine the distribution of Legionella in a subset of regionally diverse US CTs and characterize the associated microbial communities. Between July and September of 2016, we obtained aliquots from water samples collected for routine Legionella testing from 196 CTs located in eight of the nine continental US climate regions. After screening for Legionella by PCR, positive samples were cultured and the resulting Legionella isolates were further characterized. Overall, 84% (164) were PCR-positive, including samples from every region studied. Of the PCR-positive samples, Legionella spp were isolated from 47% (78), L. pneumophila was isolated from 32% (53), and L. pneumophila serogroup 1 (Lp1) was isolated from 24% (40). Overall, 144 unique Legionella isolates were identified; 53% (76) of these were Legionella pneumophila. Of the 76 L. pneumophila isolates, 51% (39) were Lp1. Legionella were isolated from CTs in seven of the eight US regions examined. 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was used to compare the bacterial communities of CT waters with and without detectable Legionella as well as the microbiomes of waters from different climate regions. Interestingly, the microbial communities were homogenous across climate regions. When a subset of seven CTs sampled in April and July were compared, there was no association with changes in corresponding CT microbiomes over time in the samples that became culture-positive for Legionella. Legionella species and Lp1 were detected frequently among the samples examined in this first large-scale study of Legionella in US CTs. Our findings highlight that, under the right conditions, there is the potential for CT-related LD outbreaks to occur throughout the US."
https://openalex.org/W2777449988,"Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder caused by transcriptional silencing of the frataxin gene (FXN) due to expansions of GAA repeats in intron 1. FRDA manifests with multiple symptoms, which may include ataxia, cardiomyopathy and diabetes mellitus. Expanded GAA tracts are genetically unstable, exhibiting both expansions and contractions. GAA length correlates with severity of FRDA symptoms and inversely with age of onset. Thus, tissue-specific somatic instability of long GAA repeats may be implicated in the development of symptoms and disease progression. Herein, we determined the extent of somatic instability of the GAA repeats in heart, cerebral cortex, spinal cord, cerebellar cortex, and pancreatic tissues from 15 FRDA patients. Results demonstrate differences in the lengths of the expanded GAAs among different tissues, with significantly longer GAA tracts detected in heart and pancreas than in other tissues. The expansion bias detected in heart and pancreas may contribute to disease onset and progression, making the mechanism of somatic instability an important target for therapy. Additionally, we detected significant differences in GAA tract lengths between lymphocytes and fibroblast pairs derived from 16 FRDA patients, with longer GAA tracts present in the lymphocytes. This result urges caution in direct comparisons of data obtained in these frequently used FRDA models. Furthermore, we conducted a longitudinal analysis of the GAA repeat length in lymphocytes collected over a span of 7–9 years and demonstrated progressive expansions of the GAAs with maximum gain of approximately 9 repeats per year. Continuous GAA expansions throughout the patient’s lifespan, as observed in FRDA lymphocytes, should be considered in clinical trial designs and data interpretation."

We reported QTL discovery in wheat using a population of 217 recombinant inbred lines and multiple statistical approach including multi-environment, multi-trait and epistatic interactions analysis. We detected nine consistent QTL linked to different traits on chromosomes 1A, 2A, 2B, 5A, 5B, 6A, 6B and 7A. Grain yield QTL were detected on chromosomes 2B.1 and 5B across three or four models of GenStat, MapQTL, and QTLNetwork while the QTL on chromosomes 5A.1, 6A.2, and 7A.1 were only significant with yield from one or two models. The phenotypic variation explained (PVE) by the QTL on 2B.1 ranged from 3.3-25.1% based on single and multi-environment models in GenStat and was pleiotropic or co-located with maturity (days to heading) and yield related traits (test weight, thousand kernel weight, harvest index). The QTL on 5B at 211 cM had PVE range of 1.8-9.3% and had no significant pleiotropic effects. Other consistent QTL detected in this study were linked to yield related traits and agronomic traits. The QTL on 1A was consistent for the number of spikes m-2 across environments and all the four analysis models with a PVE range of 5.8-8.6%. QTL for kernels spike-1 were found in chromosomes 1A, 2A.1, 2B.1, 6A.2, and 7A.1 with PVE ranged from 5.6-12.8% while QTL for thousand kernel weight were located on chromosomes 1A, 2B.1, 5A.1, 6A.2, 6B.1 and 7A.1 with PVEranged from 2.7-19.5%. Among the consistent QTL, five QTL had significant epistatic interactions (additive × additive) at least for one trait and none revealed significant additive × additive × environment interactions. Comparative analysis revealed that the region within the confidence interval of the QTL on 5B from 211.4-244.2 cM is also linked to genes for aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, splicing regulatory glutamine/lysine-rich protein 1 isoform X1, and UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase 1-like isoform X1. The stable QTL could be important for further validation, high throughput SNP development, and marker-assisted selection (MAS) in wheat."
https://openalex.org/W2778104188,"The transcription factor BCL11A has recently been reported to be a driving force in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), contributing to the maintenance of a chemoresistant breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) population. Although BCL11A was shown to suppress γ-globin and p21 and to induce MDM2 expression in the hematopoietic system, its downstream targets in TNBC are still unclear. For its role in transcriptional repression, BCL11A was found to interact with several corepressor complexes; however, the mechanisms underlying these interactions remain unknown. Here, we reveal that BCL11A interacts with histone methyltransferase (PRC2) and histone deacetylase (NuRD and SIN3A) complexes through their common subunit, RBBP4/7. In fluorescence polarization assays, we show that BCL11A competes with histone H3 for binding to the negatively charged top face of RBBP4. To define that interaction, we solved the crystal structure of RBBP4 in complex with an N-terminal peptide of BCL11A (residues 2-16, BCL11A(2-16)). The crystal structure identifies novel interactions between BCL11A and the side of the β-propeller of RBBP4 that are not seen with histone H3. We next show that BCL11A(2-16) pulls down RBBP4, RBBP7, and other components of PRC2, NuRD, and SIN3A from the cell lysate of the TNBC cell line SUM149. Furthermore, we demonstrate the therapeutic potential of targeting the RBBP4-BCL11A binding by showing that a BCL11A peptide can decrease aldehyde dehydrogenase-positive BCSCs and mammosphere formation capacity in SUM149. Together, our findings have uncovered a previously unidentified mechanism that BCL11A may use to recruit epigenetic complexes to regulate transcription and promote tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2778094940,"Inflammation and hypoxia are hallmarks of inflammatory bowel disease. Low oxygen levels activate hypoxia-inducible factors as central transcriptional regulators of cellular responses to hypoxia, particularly in myeloid cells where hypoxia-inducible factors control immune cell function and survival. Still, the role of myeloid hypoxia-inducible factor-1 during inflammatory bowel disease remains poorly defined. We therefore investigated the role of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 for myeloid cell function and immune response during colitis. Experimental colitis was induced by administration of 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium to mice with a conditional knockout of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α in myeloid cells and their wild type siblings. Murine colon tissue was examined by histologic analysis, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Induction of experimental colitis increased levels of hypoxia and accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α positive cells in colon tissue of both treated groups. Myeloid hypoxia-inducible factor-1α knockout reduced weight loss and disease activity index when compared to wild type mice. Knockout mice displayed less infiltration of macrophages into intestinal mucosa and reduced mRNA expression of markers for dendritic cells and interleukin-17 secreting T helper cells. Expression of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines also showed a reduced and delayed induction in myeloid hypoxia-inducible factor-1α knockout mice. Our results show a disease promoting role of myeloid hypoxia-inducible factor-1 during intestinal inflammation. This might result from a hypoxia-inducible factor-1 dependent increase in pro-inflammatory interleukin-17 secreting T helper cells in the absence of obvious changes in regulatory T cells. In contrast, knockout mice appear to shift the balance to anti-inflammatory signals and cells resulting in milder intestinal inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2777270629,"The transmembrane receptor guanylate cyclase-C (GCC) has been found to be expressed in colorectal cancers. However, limited data are available on GCC protein expression in non-colorectal gastrointestinal tumors and few studies have reported whether GCC protein expression was consistently preserved in synchronous primary and metastatic cancer tissues.GCC protein status was assessed by immunohistochemistry in tumor specimens from individuals (n = 627) with gastrointestinal tumors, including esophageal (n = 130), gastric (n = 276), pancreatic (n = 136), and colorectal (n = 85) primary and metastatic tumors. Tissue specimens consisted of tissue microarrays containing esophageal, gastric, pancreatic tumors, and whole-slide tissue sections from colorectal cancer patients with matching primary and metastatic tumors.Among the evaluated esophageal, gastric, and pancreatic tumors, the frequency of GCC positivity at the protein level ranged from 59% to 68%. GCC was consistently expressed in primary and matched/synchronous metastatic lesions of colorectal cancer tissues derived from the same patients.This observational study demonstrated the protein expression of GCC across various gastrointestinal malignancies. In all cancer histotypes, GCC protein localization was observed predominantly in the cytoplasm compared to the membrane region of tumor cells. Consistent immunohistochemistry detection of GCC protein expression in primary colorectal cancers and in their matched liver metastases suggests that the expression of GCC is maintained throughout the process of tumor progression and formation of metastatic disease."

Although the structure of the OEC has remained conserved over eons of evolution, significant differences in the chloride-binding characteristics exist between cyanobacteria and higher plants. An analysis of amino acid residues in and around the OEC has identified residue 87 in the D1 subunit as the only significant difference between PSII in cyanobacteria and higher plants. We substituted the D1-Asn87 residue in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (wildtype) with alanine, present in higher plants, or with aspartic acid. We studied PSII core complexes purified from D1-N87A and D1-N87D variant strains to probe the function of the D1-Asn87 residue in the water-oxidation mechanism. EPR spectra of the S2 state and flash-induced FTIR spectra of both D1-N87A and D1-N87D PSII core complexes exhibited characteristics similar to those of wildtype Synechocystis PSII core complexes. However, flash-induced O2-evolution studies revealed a decreased cycling efficiency of the D1-N87D variant, whereas the cycling efficiency of the D1-N87A PSII variant was similar to that of wildtype PSII. Steady-state O2-evolution activity assays revealed that substitution of the D1 residue at position 87 with alanine perturbs the chloride-binding site in the proton-exit channel.

Photosystem II (PSII) 4The abbreviations used are: PSIIphotosystem IIChlchlorophyllD1D1 polypeptide of PSIID2D2 polypeptide of PSIIOECoxygen-evolving complex. is a 700-kDa pigment–protein complex responsible for water oxidation in photoautotrophic organisms. The site of water oxidation, known as the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC), consists of a μ-oxo-bridged tetramanganese-calcium cluster ligated by a number of amino acid residues and water molecules (1Suga M.

The OEC is surrounded by a network of hydrogen-bonded amino acid residues and water molecules that, along with Cl− ions, play a pivotal role in water oxidation (2Vogt L. Vinyard D.J. Khan S. Brudvig G.W. Oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II: an analysis of second-shell residues and hydrogen-bonding networks.Curr. Opin. Chem.

This process is initiated by photoinduced charge separation via a chlorophyll molecule called P680. The P680·+ species thus formed is reduced by oxidation of the tetramanganese cluster, thereby building up oxidizing equivalents that are used for water oxidation (4McEvoy J.P. Brudvig G.W.

Because of the ease of generation and detection of the S2 state during S-state cycling, this state has been studied extensively. EPR studies of the S2 state in PSII from spinach reveal two distinct spin isomers corresponding to S = 1/2 (g = 2) and S = 5/2 (g = 4.1) states that exist in equilibrium with each other (6Dismukes G.C.

In cyanobacterial PSII, however, the S2-state EPR spectrum exhibits only the S = 1/2 spin isomer (8Pokhrel R. Brudvig G.W.

This indicates that even though the core of the OEC is highly conserved, there are differences in the surrounding hydrogen-bonding network that affect the equilibrium between these two spin isomers. Because the fundamental process of water oxidation is assumed to remain unchanged over evolution, analyzing the basis and importance of the surrounding amino acid residues is key to understanding the mechanism of water oxidation in greater depth. Previous studies have shown that the equilibrium between the two S2-state isomers can be affected by a number of different factors such as temperature and small molecules like acetate, fluoride, and nitrite (8Pokhrel R.

All of these factors affect the hydrogen-bonding network surrounding the OEC, thereby stabilizing one of the two isomers. Also, it has been observed that depletion of Cl− favors the S = 5/2 spin isomer in the S2 state of spinach PSII (10Ono T. Zimmermann J.L. Inoue Y. Rutherford A.W.

This observation, however, has not been seen in cyanobacterial PSII indicating that the Cl−-binding site and its associated hydrogen-bonding network affects the spin isomer distribution differently in the two species (12Boussac A.

Mutations of second-shell residues in cyanobacterial PSII such as D2-K317R, D1-N181A, and D1-N181S have yielded the high-spin, S = 5/2, form of the S2 state, highlighting the importance of these residues in the spin isomer equilibrium distribution (3Pokhrel R.

Therefore, it is of interest to focus on changes in the second-shell residues that may impact the hydrogen-bonding network. Sequence alignment studies of the second-shell residues have revealed that the only statistically significant difference between the two species occurs at D1 position 87 (2Vogt L. Vinyard D.J. Khan S. Brudvig G.W. Oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II: an analysis of second-shell residues and hydrogen-bonding networks.Curr. Opin. Chem.

This site is occupied by an asparagine residue in a significant majority of cyanobacterial PSII including Synechocystis PCC 6803 as opposed to an alanine residue in spinach PSII. Furthermore, this residue is an important part of the “narrow” channel of hydrogen-bonded waters whose role is yet to be determined (2Vogt L. Vinyard D.J. Khan S. Brudvig G.W. Oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II: an analysis of second-shell residues and hydrogen-bonding networks.Curr. Opin. Chem.

The hydrogen-bonding network surrounding the manganese cluster is extensive; therefore, perturbation at any point might be propagated over a long distance and can affect remote sites like the Cl−-binding site which is ˜13 Å from D1 residue 87. Fig. 1 shows the extensive hydrogen-bonding network connected to D1 residue 87 in cyanobacterial PSII obtained from Thermosynechococcus elongatus (Protein Data Bank code 3WU2). Based on these observations it is therefore hypothesized that substitution of D1 residue 87 in cyanobacterial PSII would be able to effect some of the changes that are different in the two species. The current study deals with characterization of substitutions of D1 residue 87, specifically D1-N87A and D1-N87D. In addition to understanding the role of this site, our study also has uncovered some of the fundamental aspects that are different between the two species and hence provides new insight into the mechanism of water oxidation. To investigate the significance of the difference in D1 residue 87 between spinach PSII and cyanobacterial PSII, the D1-N87A and D1-N87D mutations were constructed in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. D1-N87A cells and D1-N87D cells exhibit photoautotrophic growth. The doubling times of D1-N87A and D1-N87D cells were 26 and 21 h, respectively, compared with 14 h for wildtype cells (Fig. S1). The light-saturated O2-evolution rates of D1-N87A and D1-N87D cells were 64 ± 4 and 36 ± 2% compared with the rate of wildtype cells, respectively (Table S1 and Note S1). On the basis of the maximum fluorescence yields (Fmax − F0) of wildtype, D1-N87A, and D1-N87D cells, the PSII contents of D1-N87A and D1-N87D cells were estimated to be 73 ± 5 and 36 ± 4% compared with wildtype cells, respectively (Fig. S2, Table S1, and Note S1). On the basis of measurements of the kinetics of charge recombination between QA− and the donor side of PSII following 5 s of actinic illumination in the presence of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU), it was estimated that 10–14% of PSII reaction centers in D1-N87A and D1-N87D cells lack Mn4CaO5 clusters in vivo (Fig. S3 and Note S2). The presence of PSII reaction centers lacking Mn4CaO5 clusters implies that the Mn4CaO5 cluster is assembled less efficiently or is less stable in D1-N87A and D1-N87D cells compared with wildtype. The light-saturated rates of O2 evolution in PSII core complexes isolated from D1-N87D and D1-N87A cells were 886 ± 28 and 3100 ± 56 μmol of O2 (mg of Chl)−1 h−1, respectively, compared with 3400 ± 83 μmol of O2 (mg of Chl)−1 h−1 for wildtype PSII core complexes under similar assay conditions using a buffer containing 60 mm Cl− (Table 1). The lower PSII activity in the D1-N87D core complex can be due to inefficient assembly of the OEC, impaired S-state cycling or due to inactivation during biochemical isolation of PSII core complexes.Table 1Effect of Cl− on O2-evolution activitySamplePSII activity+ 60 mm Cl−+ 0.1 mm Cl−μmol of O2 (mg of chl)−1 h−1Synechocystis (wildtype) PSII core complexes3400 ± 832992 ± 35D1-N87A PSII core complexes3100 ± 561360 ± 46D1-N87D PSII core complexes886 ± 28744 ± 15Spinach PSII membranes650 ± 35286 ± 29 Open table in a new tab To study the effect of Cl− on the steady-state oxygen evolution of D1-N87A and D1-N87D PSII, the PSII core complexes were suspended in a buffer containing 0.1 mm Cl−. The light-saturated activity of D1-N87D and D1-N87A PSII under this condition is given in Table 1. Under low Cl− conditions, the oxygen-evolution activity of D1-N87D PSII decreased by 16% relative to Cl−-sufficient conditions. The Cl− dependence of D1-N87D PSII is comparable with that of wildtype Synechocystis PSII core complexes, which exhibit a decrease in activity of only 12% under similar experimental conditions. However, the Cl− dependence of D1-N87A PSII is markedly different from wildtype Synechocystis PSII, with a 56% decrease in the oxygen-evolution activity in low Cl− conditions relative to Cl−-sufficient conditions; notably, this decrease is comparable with the 52% decrease observed for spinach PSII membranes (Table 1). These results demonstrate that the D1-N87A mutation modulates the Cl−-binding site, causing the Cl− dependence of PSII activity to be similar to spinach PSII. It is interesting, however, that the D1-N87D substitution has little effect on Cl− binding. Based on these results, we investigated the effect of these single-point mutations at D1 residue 87 on the binding affinity of chloride. The Cl− concentrations were varied from 0.1 to 5 mm, and their effect on PSII activity was measured. The observation of biphasic binding curves (Fig. 2) suggests the presence of at least two types of Cl−-binding sites: one in which the bound chloride is exchangeable with free chloride (which titrates with a binding constant of KD) and another non-exchangeable site (which gives activity in the absence of added chloride). The binding curves were computed by fitting the data to a biphasic Michaelis–Menten equation (Equation 1), Vobs=f×Vmax+(1−f)×Vmax×[Cl−]KD+[Cl−](1) where Vobs is the observed rate of oxygen evolution, Vmax is the maximum observed activity which is normalized to 1, f is the fraction of centers with non-exchangeable Cl−, and KD is the binding constant of the exchangeable Cl−. The measured KD values for Cl− in D1-N87A and D1-N87D PSII are 0.730 ± 0.218 mm (f = 0.4) and 1.35 ± 0.956 mm (f = 0.8), respectively, which fall within the range of KD values obtained for Cl− in spinach PSII (0.5–0.7 mm) (14Lindberg K.

These results indicate that the binding environment of the exchangeable Cl− in the two D1-Asn87–substituted PSII samples is similar to that in spinach PSII. However, the fraction of exchangeable Cl− is much larger in D1-N87A Synechocystis PSII and spinach PSII than in wildtype Synechocystis PSII and D1-N87D Synechocystis PSII. EPR experiments recording the S1- and S2-state spectra of spinach PSII membranes, and Synechocystis wildtype, D1-N87A and D1-N87D PSII core complexes were performed (S2-minus-S1 difference spectra shown in Fig. 3, unsubtracted spectra are included in Fig. S4, EPR spectra of spinach PSII membranes are included in Fig. S9). EPR spectra of D1-N87A were also collected after changing the cryoprotectant to sucrose. The spectrum in the presence of sucrose is similar to the spectrum in 10% (v/v) glycerol as cyoprotectant (Fig. S10). The dark spectra corresponding to the S1 state exhibit a cytochrome c550 signal. Upon 200 K illumination, the OEC advances to the S2 state, which is characterized by the presence of a g = 2 multiline EPR signal. The multiline signal was observed in wildtype, D1-N87A, and D1-N87D PSII (Fig. 3). However, the S = 5/2 spin isomer giving the S2-state g = 4.1 signal that is observed under these conditions in spinach PSII membranes was absent in both D1-N87D and D1-N87A PSII. In addition, the S2-minus-S1 difference spectra show a light-induced cytochrome b559 signal at g = 3. The fraction of PSII centers lacking a functional OEC gives rise to this signal when the sample is illuminated at 200 K. The intensities of g = 2 multiline signal of D1-N87D and D1-N87A PSII are smaller relative to wildtype PSII for a similar chlorophyll concentration. Both the weaker g = 2 multiline signal and the 200 K light-induced cytochrome b559 signal indicate that the D1-N87D and D1-N87A PSII samples have fewer functional OECs, consistent with the lower oxygen-evolution activity observed for the EPR samples. The mid-frequency FTIR difference spectra induced by four successive flashes given to wildtype and D1-N87D PSII core complexes are compared in Fig. 4 (black and red traces, respectively). The spectra that are induced by the first, second, third, and fourth flashes correspond predominantly to the S2-minus-S1, S3-minus-S2, S0-minus-S3, and S1-minus-S0 FTIR difference spectra, respectively (17Noguchi T.

A secondary objective was to explore factors associated with CSOM in this population.We performed a community-based cross-sectional study of children aged 4-6 years in Chikhwawa District, Southern Malawi, utilising a village-level cluster design. Participants underwent a structured clinical assessment, including video-otoscopy and screening audiometry. Diagnoses were made remotely by two otolaryngologists who independently reviewed clinical data and images collected in the field. Hearing impairment was classified as failure to hear a pure tone of 25dB or greater at 1, 2 or 4kHz.We recruited 281 children across 10 clusters. The prevalence estimates of CSOM, unilateral hearing impairment and bilateral hearing impairment were 5.4% (95%CI 2.2-8.6), 24.5% (95%CI 16.3-30.0), and 12.5% (95%CI 6.2-16.9) respectively. Middle ear disease was seen in 46.9% of children with hearing impairment. A trend towards increased risk of CSOM was observed with sleeping in a house with >2 other children.We found a high burden of middle ear disease and preventable hearing impairment in our sample of school-entry age children in rural Malawi. There are important public health implications of these findings as CSOM and hearing impairment can affect educational outcomes, and may impact subsequent development. The identification and management of middle ear disease and hearing impairment represent major unmet needs in this population."

We aimed to determine the association of the qSOFA score with in-hospital mortality, length of hospitalisation, and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) in patients with pneumonia. Further, in a subgroup analysis, the outcomes were compared for qSOFA in comparison to other risk scores, including the CURB-65 and SIRS scores. Methods In a retrospective analysis, admission data from the ED of the Bern University Hospital, Switzerland, were screened to identify patients admitted for pneumonia. In addition to clinical characteristics, qSOFA and CURB-65 scores and SIRS criteria were assessed and evaluated with respect to the defined study outcomes. Results 527 patients (median age 66 IQR 50–76) were included in this study. The overall in-hospital mortality was 13.3% (n = 70); 22.0% (n = 116) were transferred to the ICU. The median length of hospitalisation was 7 days (IQR 4–12). In comparison to qSOFA-negative patients, qSOFA-positive patients had increased odds ratios for in-hospital mortality (OR 2.6, 95%:1.4, 4.7, p<0.001) and ICU admission (3.5, 95% CI: 2.0. 5.8, p<0.001) and an increased length of stay (p<0.001). For ICU admission, the specificity of qSOPA-positivity (≥2) was 82.1% and sensitivity 43.0%. For in-hospital mortality, the specificity of qSOPA-positivity (≤2) was 88.9% and sensitivity 24.4%. In the subgroup analysis (n = 366). The area under the receiver operating curve for ICU admission was higher for qSOFA than for the CURB-65 score (p = 0.013). The evaluated scores did not differ significantly in their prognostication of in-hospital mortality (p>0.05). Conclusions The qSOFA score is associated with in-hospital mortality, ICU admission and length of hospitalisation in ED patients with pneumonia. Subgroup analysis revealed that qSOFA is superior to CURB-65 in respect to prognostication of ICU admission."
https://openalex.org/W2725235880,"Social network analysis is a prominent approach to investigate interpersonal relationships. Most studies use self-report data to quantify the connections between participants and construct social networks. In recent years smartphones have been used as an alternative to map networks by assessing the proximity between participants based on Bluetooth and GPS data. While most studies have handed out specially programmed smartphones to study participants, we developed an application for iOS and Android to collect Bluetooth data from participants’ own smartphones. In this study, we compared the networks estimated with the smartphone app to those obtained from sociometric badges and self-report data. Participants (n = 21) installed the app on their phone and wore a sociometric badge during office hours. Proximity data was collected for 4 weeks. A contingency table revealed a significant association between proximity data (ϕ = 0.17, p<0.0001), but the marginal odds were higher for the app (8.6%) than for the badges (1.3%), indicating that dyads were more often detected by the app. We then compared the networks that were estimated using the proximity and self-report data. All three networks were significantly correlated, although the correlation with self-reported data was lower for the app (ρ = 0.25) than for badges (ρ = 0.67). The scanning rates of the app varied considerably between devices and was lower on iOS than on Android. The association between the app and the badges increased when the network was estimated between participants whose app recorded more regularly. These findings suggest that the accuracy of proximity networks can be further improved by reducing missing data and restricting the interpersonal distance at which interactions are detected."

We have previously demonstrated the effect of cathepsin D (CD) on the mechanical disruption of retinal endothelial cell junctions and increased vasopermeability, as well as increased levels of CD in retinas of diabetic mice. Here, we have also examined the effect of CD on endothelial-pericyte interactions, as well as the effect of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitor on CD in endothelial-pericyte interactions in vitro and in vivo. Cocultured cells that were treated with proCD demonstrated a significant decrease in the expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β, a tyrosine kinase receptor that is required for pericyte cell survival; N-cadherin, the key adherens junction protein between endothelium and pericytes; and increases in the vessel destabilizing agent, angiopoietin-2. The effect was reversed in cells that were treated with DPP4 inhibitor along with pro-CD. With pro-CD treatment, there was a significant increase in the phosphorylation of the downstream signaling protein, PKC-α, and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II in endothelial cells and pericytes, which disrupts adherens junction structure and function, and this was significantly reduced with DPP4 inhibitor treatment. Increased CD levels, vasopermeability, and alteration in junctional-related proteins were observed in the retinas of diabetic rats, which were significantly changed with DPP4 inhibitor treatment. Thus, DPP4 inhibitors may be used as potential adjuvant therapeutic agents to treat increased vascular leakage observed in patients with diabetic macular edema.—Monickaraj, F., McGuire, P., Das, A.

Internal tides and their higher harmonics dominate the internal wave motions, producing considerable shear-induced turbulent mixing in layers of 10–50 m thickness. This interior mixing of about 100 times open-ocean interior values is observed both at a high-resolution temperature sensor mooring-site at the crest, 770 m water depth being nearly 400 m below the top of the seamount, and a CTD-yoyo site at the slope off the crest 400 m horizontally away, 880 m water depth. Only at the mooring site, additionally two times higher turbulence is observed near the bottom, associated with highly non-linear wave breaking. The highest abundance of epifauna, notably sponges, are observed just below the crest and 100 m down the eastern slope (700–800 m) in a cross-ridge video-camera transect. This sponge belt is located in a water layer of depressed oxygen levels (saturation 63±2%) with a local minimum centered around 700 m. Turbulent mixing supplies oxygen to this region from above and below and is expected to mix nutrients away from this biodegraded layer towards the depth of highest abundance of macrofauna."

In-vivo pCLE analysis of the SPN was performed using either CholangioFlex (apical and posterior segments of the upper lobes) or AlveoFlex (other segments) introduced into the guide sheath before sampling. pCLE features were compared between the two probes.Fourty-eight patients with malignant SPN were included (NCT01931579). The diagnostic accuracy for lung cancer using r-EBUS coupled with pCLE imaging was 79.2%. All the SPNs were successfully explored with either one of the probes (19 and 29 subjects for CholangioFlex and AlveoFlex, respectively). A specific solid pattern in the SPN was found in 30 pCLE explorations. Comparison between the two probes found no differences in the axial fibers thickness, cell size and specific solid pattern in the nodules. Extra-alveolar microvessel size appeared larger using CholangioFlex suggesting less compression effect. The kappa test for interobserver agreement for the identification of solid pattern was 0.74 (p = 0.001).This study demonstrates that pCLE imaging of SPNs is achievable in all segments of both lungs using either the 0.6mm or 1.4mm miniprobe."

Methods A representative sample of 1,233 U.S. residents was drawn from address-based telephone and mobile phone lists, including an oversample of 208 women of child-bearing age living in five U.S. southern states. Data were collected between April and June, 2016, and weighted to represent U.S. population distributions. Results Overall, 78% of the U.S. population was aware of Zika prior to domestic transmission. Those unaware of the novel virus were more likely to be younger, lower income, and of Hispanic ethnicity. Among those aware of Zika, over half would delay pregnancy for a year or more in response to public health warnings; approximately one third agreed with a possible vector-control strategy of targeted indoor spraying by the government; and nearly two-thirds agreed that the government should make pregnancy-termination services available to women who learn their fetus had a Zika-related birth defect. Receptivity to these public health interventions varied by age, risk perception, and knowledge of the virus. Conclusion Risk salience and population receptivity to public health interventions targeting a novel virus can be conditioned on pre-existing characteristics in the event of an emerging infectious disease. Risk communicators should consider targeted strategies to encourage adoption of behavioral, environmental, and clinical interventions."

In this study we aimed to evaluate the relationship between serum adiponectin levels and cognitive performances in menopausal women, and whether serum adiponectin levels may be differently associated with cognitive performances as compared to overweight/obese subjects.We enrolled 188 post-menopausal women, divided into two groups: obese/overweight group (n = 96) and normal weight group (n = 92). After a clinical examination, and laboratory measurements, we assessed cognitive functions by Montreal Cognitive Assessment test (MoCA).A significant and greater decrease in executive/visuo-spatial and in attention functions occurred in obese/overweight group as compared to normal weight group (p< 0.001). A significant positive relationship between serum adiponectin levels, and MoCA Global cognitive function was found. MoCA executive, and MoCA attention functions significantly and positively correlated with serum adiponectin levels. BMI, WHR, and serum adiponectin levels were independently associated with MoCA Global cognitive function, but only serum adiponectin levels were independently associated with MoCA attention.A significant positive association may exist between serum adiponectin levels, and better cognitive function in postmenopausal status. The major determinant of attentional capacity was just serum adiponectin levels, and dosage of serum adiponectin levels may be early serum marker of cognitive decline. Therefore, serum adiponectin level has to be used, as early biomarker, to detect cognitive decline, and to support an early prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2778691734,"Habitat reconstruction is commonly employed to restore degraded estuarine habitats and lost ecological functions. In this study, we use a combination of stable isotope analyses and macrofauna community analysis to compare the ecological structure and function between a recently constructed Spartina alterniflora salt marsh and a natural reference habitat over a 2-year period. The restored marsh was successful in providing habitat for economically and ecologically important macrofauna taxa; supporting similar or greater density, biomass, and species richness to the natural reference during all but one sampling period. Stable isotope analyses revealed that communities from the natural and the restored marshes relied on a similar diversity of food resources and that decapods had similar trophic levels. However, some generalist consumers (Palaemonetes spp. and Penaeus aztecus) were more 13C-enriched in the natural marsh, indicating a greater use of macrophyte derived organic matter relative to restored marsh counterparts. This difference was attributed to the higher quantities of macrophyte detritus and organic carbon in natural marsh sediments. Reduced marsh flooding frequency was associated with a reduction in macrofaunal biomass and decapod trophic levels. The restored marsh edge occurred at lower elevations than natural marsh edge, apparently due to reduced fetch and wind-wave exposure provided by the protective berm structures. The lower elevation of the restored marsh edge mitigated negative impacts in sampling periods with low tidal elevations that affected the natural marsh. The results of this study highlight the importance of considering sediment characteristics and elevation in salt marsh constructions."

Consequently, PLCs control various cellular processes, and their aberrant regulation contributes to many diseases, including cancer, atherosclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Despite the widespread importance of PLCs in human biology and disease, it has been impossible to directly monitor the real-time activation of these enzymes at membranes. To overcome this limitation, here we describe XY-69, a fluorogenic reporter that preferentially partitions into membranes and provides a selective tool for measuring the real-time activity of PLCs as either purified enzymes or in cellular lysates. Indeed, XY-69 faithfully reported the membrane-dependent activation of PLC-β3 by Gαq. Therefore, XY-69 can replace radioactive phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate used in conventional PLC assays and will enable high-throughput screens to identify both orthosteric and allosteric PLC inhibitors. In the future, cell-permeable variants of XY-69 represent promising candidates for reporting the activation of PLCs in live cells with high spatiotemporal resolution.

https://openalex.org/W2778694333,"Rift Valley fever phlebovirus (RVFV) causes high rates of abortions and fetal malformations in ruminants, and hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, or blindness in humans. Viral transmission occurs via mosquito vectors in endemic areas, which necessitates regular vaccination of susceptible livestock animals to prevent the RVF outbreaks. Although ZH501 strain has been used as a challenge strain for past vaccine efficacy studies, further characterization of other RVFV strains is important to optimize ruminant and nonhuman primate RVFV challenge models. This study aimed to characterize the virulence of wild-type RVFV strains belonging to different genetic lineages in outbred CD1 mice. Mice were intraperitoneally infected with 1x103 PFU of wild-type ZH501, Kenya 9800523, Kenya 90058, Saudi Arabia 200010911, OS1, OS7, SA75, Entebbe, or SA51 strains. Among them, mice infected with SA51, Entebbe, or OS7 strain showed rapid dissemination of virus in livers and peracute necrotic hepatitis at 2-3 dpi. Recombinant SA51 (rSA51) and Zinga (rZinga) strains were recovered by reverse genetics, and their virulence was also tested in CD1 mice. The rSA51 strain reproduced peracute RVF disease in mice, whereas the rZinga strain showed a similar virulence with that of rZH501 strain. This study showed that RVFV strains in different genetic lineages display distinct virulence in outbred mice. Importantly, since wild-type RVFV strains contain defective-interfering RNA or various genetic subpopulations during passage from original viral isolations, recombinant RVFV strains generated by reverse genetics will be better suitable for reproducible challenge studies for vaccine development as well as pathological studies."
https://openalex.org/W2778839879,"Microfluidics researchers are increasingly using computer simulation in many different aspects of their research. However, these simulations are often computationally intensive: simulating the behavior of a simple microfluidic chip can take hours to complete on typical computing hardware, and even powerful workstations can lack the computational capabilities needed to simulate more complex chips. This slows the development of new microfluidic chips for new applications. To address this issue, we present a microfluidic simulation method that can simulate the behavior of fluids and particles in some typical microfluidic chips instantaneously (in around one second). Our method decomposes the chip into its primary components: channels and intersections. The behavior of fluid in each channel is determined by leveraging analogies with electronic circuits, and the behavior of fluid and particles in each intersection is determined by querying a database containing nearly 100,000 pre-simulated channel intersections. While constructing this database takes a nontrivial amount of computation time, once built, this database can be queried to determine the behavior of fluids and particles in a given intersection in a fraction of a second. Using this approach, the behavior of a microfluidic chip can be simulated in just one second on a standard laptop computer, without any noticeable degradation in the accuracy of the simulation. While our current technique has some constraints on the designs of the chips it can simulate (namely, T- or cross-shaped intersections, 90 degree channel turns, a fixed channel width, fluid flow rates between 0 and 2 cm/s, and particles with diameters between 1 and 20 microns), we provide several strategies for increasing the range of possible chip designs that can be simulated using our technique. As a proof of concept, we show that our simulation method can instantaneously simulate the paths followed by particles in both simple and complex microfluidic chips, with results that are essentially indistinguishable from simulations that took hours or even days to complete using conventional approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2779531851,"Bacillus subtilis subsp. krictiensis ATCC55079 produces the cyclic lipopeptide antibiotics iturin A–F as well as several surfactins. Here, we analyzed and characterized the biosynthetic genes associated with iturin and surfactin production in this strain. We aligned the sequences of each iturin and surfactin synthetase ORF obtained from a genomic library screen and next generation sequencing. The resulting 37,249-bp and 37,645-bp sequences associated with iturin and surfactin production, respectively, contained several ORFs that are predicted to encode proteins involved in iturin and surfactin biosynthesis. These ORFs showed higher sequence homologies with the respective iturin and surfactin synthetase genes of B. methylotrophicus CAU B946 than with those of B. subtilis RB14 and B. subtilis ATCC6633. Moreover, comparative analysis of the secondary metabolites produced by the wild-type and surfactin-less mutant (with a spectinomycin resistance cassette inserted into the srfAB gene within the putative surfactin gene region) strains demonstrated that the mutant strain showed significantly higher antifungal activity against Fusarium oxysporum than the wild-type strain. In addition, the wild-type strain-specific surfactin high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) peaks were not observed in the surfactin-less mutant strain. In contrast, the iturin A peak detected by HPLC and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) in the surfactin-less mutant strain was 30% greater than that in the wild-type strain. These results suggested that the gene cluster we identified is involved in surfactin biosynthesis, and the biosynthetic pathways for iturin and surfactin in Bacillus strains producing both iturin and surfactin may utilize a common pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2780751364,"Background Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are harmful and unintended reactions to medicines given at standard doses. Although the antiretroviral treatment (ART) changed the global HIV epidemic significantly, it’s associated adverse events is huge. Therefore, investigating the rate and development of ADRs of ART provides vital information for monitoring risks. Methods Retrospective study was conducted among patients on ART from July1/2011—June 30/2016 at Felege Hiwot referral hospital. Data were collected using checklist and document review. The p-value and hazard ratio with its confidence interval was used to show presence and strength of association. Results A total of 602 subjects were studied. The rate of occurrence of major ADRs was 4.3/100PY. Patients with no formal and completed primary education were at higher risk of developing ADRs compared to those with higher level education [AHR = 8, 95% CI: 2.53–25.20, AHR = 4.9, 95% CI: 1.65–14.44]. The risks of ADRs among patients working in NGOs were more than four times compared to those in governmental organizations [AHR = 4.3, 95% CI: 1.42–13.31]. The risks of ADRs in WHO clinical stage II, III and IV were much higher than in stage I [AHR = 4, 95% CI: 1.33–11.93, AHR = 5.3, 95% CI: 2.02–13.79 and AHR = 7, 95% CI: 2.51–20.10] respectively. Moreover, patients didn’t receive OI prophylaxis were more three times at risk of ADRs compared to those received [AHR = 3.2, 95% CI: 1.47–7.08]. Conclusions Most of the ADRs cases were occurred within a year after initiation of ART. Educational status, occupation, advanced clinical stage and OI prophylaxis therapy were predictors ADRs. Continuous counseling for non-educated patients and clients in clinical stage II and above, and patients didn’t take OI prophylaxis need to get close follow up to prevent the associated ADRs by the concerned parties."
https://openalex.org/W2777215776,"High-dose interleukin-2 (HD IL-2) is used in the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) and has an overall response rate (ORR) of 12-20% and a complete response rate (CR) of 8% in unselected populations with predominantly clear cell type renal cell carcinoma. Nearly 10-15% of patients with renal cell carcinoma exhibit sarcomatoid differentiation, a feature which correlates with a median overall survival (OS) of 9 months and overall poor prognosis. We report a single institution experience with 21 patients with mRCC with sarcomatoid features post-nephrectomy who were treated with HD IL-2.Twenty one patients with mRCC with sarcomatoid features post-nephrectomy who underwent therapy with HD IL-2 were identified at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center from 2004 to 2016. Baseline patient characteristics, HD IL-2 cycles, time to progression, and subsequent therapies were evaluated. OS and progression-free survival (PFS) in the cohort were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Disease characteristics were evaluated for significance using the Fischer's exact test and Wilcoxon rank sum test.Patients were predominantly Caucasian males with a median age of 54 years. A majority, 86% of these patients, had metastatic disease at time of initial presentation, primarily with lung and lymph node involvement. The ORR and CR with HD IL-2 was 10% and 5%, respectively. Initial localized disease presentation is the only variable that was significantly associated with response to HD IL-2 (p = 0.0158). Number of HD IL-2 doses did not correlate with response with a mean of 16.5 and 15.0 total doses in responders and non-responders, respectively (p = 0.53). Median PFS with HD IL-2 was 7.9 months (95% CI, 5.0-21.3). Median OS was 30.5 months (95% CI 13.3-57.66). Within the subset of patients who had progression on IL-2, median OS was 19.4 months (95% CI, 13.3-35.3). In patients who received second-line therapy, median PFS was 7.9 months (95% CI 2.4-10.2).In patients with mRCC with sarcomatoid features, use of HD IL-2 was associated with a modest ORR and a higher survival compared to historical controls (patients with mRCC and sarcomatoid features). Thus, HD IL-2 may have a role in treating selected patients with mRCC with sarcomatoid features."
https://openalex.org/W2778349452,"Susceptibility Weighted Imaging (SWI) is a common MRI technique that exploits the magnetic susceptibility differences between the tissues to provide valuable image contrasts, both in research and clinical contexts. However, despite its increased clinical use, SWI is not intrinsically suitable for quantitation purposes. Conversely, quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (qMRI) provides a way to disentangle the sources of common MR image contrasts (e.g. proton density, T1, etc.) and to measure physical parameters intrinsically related to tissue microstructure. Unfortunately, the poor signal-to-noise ratio and resolution, coupled with the long imaging time of most qMRI strategies, have hindered the integration of quantitative imaging into clinical protocols. Here we present the RElaxometry and SUsceptibility Mapping Expedient (RESUME) to show that the standard acquisition leading to a clinical SWI dataset can be easily turned into a thorough qMRI protocol at the cost of a further 50% of the SWI scan time. The R1, , proton density and magnetic susceptibility maps provided by the RESUME scheme alongside the SWI reconstruction exhibit high reproducibility and accuracy, and a submillimeter resolution is proven to be compatible with a total scan time of 7 minutes."

This biological axiom has been developed and currently appears to be all the more complex. In this study, we modified CD by adding further species to the CD information flow and mathematically expressed CD within a dynamic framework by using Boolean network based on its present-day and 1965 editions. We show that the enhancement of the Dogma not only now entails a higher level of complexity, but it also shows a higher level of robustness, thus far more consistent with the nature of biological systems. Using this mathematical modeling approach, we put forward a logic-based expression of our conceptual view of molecular biology. Finally, we show that such biological concepts can be converted into dynamic mathematical models using a logic-based approach and thus may be useful as a framework for improving static conceptual models in biology."

We hypothesized that older IL 10tm frail mice would have alterations similar to frail, older humans in measured parameters of glucose metabolism, oxygen consumption (VO2), respiratory quotient (RQ), spontaneous locomotor activity, body composition and plasma adipokine levels. To test this hypothesis, we investigated these metabolic parameters in cohorts of 3, 10, and 20 month old IL 10tm female mice and age and gender matched C57Bl/6 mice. Insulin sensitivity, glucose homeostasis, locomotor activity and RQ were not significantly altered between the two strains of mice. Interestingly, old IL 10tm mice had significantly decreased VO2 when normalized by lean mass, but not when normalized by fat mass or the lean/fat mass ratio. NMR based body composition analysis and dissection weights show that fat mass is decreased with age in IL 10tm mice compared to controls. Further, plasma adiponectin and leptin were also decreased in IL 10tm.These findings suggest that frailty observed in this mouse model of chronic inflammation may in part be driven by alterations in fat mass, hormone secretion and energy metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2776177612,"Despite its high relevance, developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) is one of the least studied forms of toxicity. Current guidelines for DNT testing are based on in vivo testing and they require extensive resources. Transcriptomic approaches using relevant in vitro models have been suggested as a useful tool for identifying possible DNT-generating compounds. In this study, we performed whole genome microarray analysis on the murine progenitor cell line C17.2 following 5 and 10 days of differentiation. We identified 30 genes that are strongly associated with neural differentiation. The C17.2 cell line can be differentiated into a co-culture of both neurons and neuroglial cells, giving a more relevant picture of the brain than using neuronal cells alone. Among the most highly upregulated genes were genes involved in neurogenesis (CHRDL1), axonal guidance (BMP4), neuronal connectivity (PLXDC2), axonogenesis (RTN4R) and astrocyte differentiation (S100B). The 30 biomarkers were further validated by exposure to non-cytotoxic concentrations of two DNT-inducing compounds (valproic acid and methylmercury) and one neurotoxic chemical possessing a possible DNT activity (acrylamide). Twenty-eight of the 30 biomarkers were altered by at least one of the neurotoxic substances, proving the importance of these biomarkers during differentiation. These results suggest that gene expression profiling using a predefined set of biomarkers could be used as a sensitive tool for initial DNT screening of chemicals. Using a predefined set of mRNA biomarkers, instead of the whole genome, makes this model affordable and high-throughput. The use of such models could help speed up the initial screening of substances, possibly indicating alerts that need to be further studied in more sophisticated models."
https://openalex.org/W2777437447,"Sclerotinia Head Rot (SHR), a disease caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, is one of the most limiting factors in sunflower production. In this study, we identified genomic loci associated with resistance to SHR to support the development of assisted breeding strategies. We genotyped 114 Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs) along with their parental lines (PAC2 –partially resistant–and RHA266 –susceptible–) by using a 384 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) Illumina Oligo Pool Assay to saturate a sunflower genetic map. Subsequently, we tested these lines for SHR resistance using assisted inoculations with S. sclerotiorum ascospores. We also conducted a randomized complete-block assays with three replicates to visually score disease incidence (DI), disease severity (DS), disease intensity (DInt) and incubation period (IP) through four field trials (2010–2014). We finally assessed main effect quantitative trait loci (M-QTLs) and epistatic QTLs (E-QTLs) by composite interval mapping (CIM) and mixed-model-based composite interval mapping (MCIM), respectively. As a result of this study, the improved map incorporates 61 new SNPs over candidate genes. We detected a broad range of narrow sense heritability (h2) values (1.86–59.9%) as well as 36 M-QTLs and 13 E-QTLs along 14 linkage groups (LGs). On LG1, LG10, and LG15, we repeatedly detected QTLs across field trials; which emphasizes their putative effectiveness against SHR. In all selected variables, most of the identified QTLs showed high determination coefficients, associated with moderate to high heritability values. Using markers shared with previous Sclerotinia resistance studies, we compared the QTL locations in LG1, LG2, LG8, LG10, LG11, LG15 and LG16. This study constitutes the largest report of QTLs for SHR resistance in sunflower. Further studies focusing on the regions in LG1, LG10, and LG15 harboring the detected QTLs are necessary to identify causal alleles and contribute to unraveling the complex genetic basis governing the resistance."

A total of 30 species (28 demosponges and two calcareous sponges) living associated to the reef structures are here reported. Six of these species are new records to the Hawai'ian Porifera catalogue and are suspected to be recent introductions to these islands. Morphological descriptions of the voucher specimens are provided, along with sequencing data of two partitions involving the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) marker and a fragment covering partial (18S and 28S) and full (ITS-1, 5.8S and ITS-2) nuclear ribosomal genes. Species delimitations based on genetic distances were calculated to valitate how taxonomic assignments from DNA barcoding aligned with morphological identifications. Of the 60 sequences submitted to GenBank ~88% are the first sequencing records for the corresponding species and genetic marker.

https://openalex.org/W2776828749,"Coal mining is one of the core industries that contribute to the economic development of a country but deteriorate the environment. Being the primary source of energy, coal has become essential to meet the energy demand of a country. It is excavated by both opencast and underground mining methods and affects the environment, especially hydrological cycle, by discharging huge amounts of mine water. Natural hydrological processes have been well known to be vulnerable to human activities, especially large scale mining activities, which inevitably generate surface cracks and subsidence. It is therefore valuable to assess the impact of mining on river runoff for the sustainable development of regional economy. In this paper, the impact of coal mining on river runoff is assessed in one of the national key coal mining sites, Gujiao mining area, Shanxi Province, China. The characteristics of water cycle are described, the similarities and differences of runoff formation are analyzed in both coal mining and pre-mining periods. The integrated distributed hydrological model named MIKE SHE is employed to simulate and evaluate the influence of coal mining on river runoff. The study shows that mining one ton of raw coal leads to the reduction of river runoff by 2.87 m3 between 1981 and 2008, of which the surface runoff decreases by 0.24 m3 and the baseflow by 2.63 m3. The reduction degree of river runoff for mining one ton of raw coal shows an increasing trend over years. The current study also reveals that large scale coal mining initiates the formation of surface cracks and subsidence, which intercepts overland flow and enhances precipitation infiltration. Together with mine drainage, the natural hydrological processes and the stream flows have been altered and the river run off has been greatly reduced."

However, its impact on the liver transcriptomes associated with prevention of hepatosteatosis is yet to be determined. In the present study, we use liver transcriptomics and plasma metabolomics analysis to characterize the effects of various estrogens on liver. The CE+BZA combination was very effective at preventing ovariectomy-induced weight gain in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). In CE+BZA treated animals, liver weight and hepatic lipid deposition were significantly lower than in Vehicle (Veh) treated animals. Additionally, CE+BZA induced unique liver transcriptome and plasma metabolome profiles compared to estradiol, conjugated estrogens alone, and bazedoxifene alone. Blood plasma metabolite analysis identified several metabolites similar to and distinct from other estrogen treatments. Integrated pathway analysis showed that gene networks that were associated with inflammation, reactive oxygen species pathway and lipid metabolism and their relevant metabolites were regulated significantly by CE+BZA treatment. Thus, long-term CE+BZA treatment modulated hepatic metabolic gene networks and their associated metabolites and improves hepatic health without stimulating the uterus."
https://openalex.org/W2951906515,"Environments can change in incremental fashions, where a shift from one state to another occurs over multiple organismal generations. The rate of the environmental change is expected to influence how and how well populations adapt to the final environmental state. We used a model system, the lytic RNA bacteriophage Φ6, to investigate this question empirically. We evolved viruses for thermostability by exposing them to heat shocks that increased to a maximum temperature at different rates. We observed increases in the ability of many heat-shocked populations to survive high temperature heat shocks. On their first exposure to the highest temperature, populations that experienced a gradual increase in temperature had higher average survival than populations that experienced a rapid temperature increase. However, at the end of the experiment, neither the survival of populations at the highest temperature nor the number of mutations per population varied significantly according to the rate of thermal change. We also evaluated mutations from the endpoint populations for their effects on viral thermostability and growth. As expected, some mutations did increase viral thermostability. However, other mutations decreased thermostability but increased growth rate, suggesting that benefits of an increased replication rate may have sometimes outweighed the benefits of enhanced thermostability. Our study highlights the importance of considering the effects of multiple selective pressures, even in environments where a single factor changes."
https://openalex.org/W2776782318,"Risk communication aims to promote health and understanding through information exchange; however, explanations regarding the basis of regulation values for the public are insufficient. Moreover, it is unclear how information presentation affects the public's sense of safety and their consumption intentions. We first investigated the relationship between perception of mercury-risk in fish and shellfish and individual attributes and knowledge. We then examined how presenting information on regulation values and primary factors regarding perception affected sense of safety toward regulations and food-consumption intentions. An online survey was conducted with Japanese individuals (N = 1148). Respondents were randomly assigned to one of three groups based on the presentation level of regulation values. People who frequently consumed tuna had a high perception of dread risk of mercury. This suggests that the dread risk perception of mercury does not determine tuna-type consumption behavior; rather, individuals' consumption behavior determines dread risk perception of mercury. Among those with high tuna-type consumption, those receiving information that a safety factor of 10 times had been considered showed a significantly greater sense of safety than did the group that was not presented with information on regulation values (odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 2.04 (1.18-3.53), p < 0.05). However, presentation of regulation values showed a weak but significantly positive correlation with excessive intake of tuna-type fish (odds ratio: 2.95 (0.93-9.32), p < 0.10). Presenting the information on regulation values increases sense of safety; however, it may also lead to excessive intake."
https://openalex.org/W2777694514,"Life-history traits influence colonization, persistence, and extinction of species on islands and are important aspects of theories predicting the geographical distribution and evolution of species. We used data collected from a large freshwater lake (1,413 km2) in central Canada to test the effects of island area and isolation on species richness and abundance of carabid beetles as a function of body size, wing length, and breeding season. A total of 10,018 individual beetles from 37 species were collected during the frost-free period of 2013 using transects of pitfall traps on 30 forested islands ranging in area from 0.2 to 980.7 ha. Life-history traits improved the predictive ability and significantly modified the shape of species-area and abundance-area curves. Abundance and richness of small-bodied (< 13.9 mm), macropterous (winged), and spring-breeding species decreased with island area and increased with isolation. In contrast, richness and abundance of larger-bodied (> 14.0 mm) and flightless species increased with area, but not isolation. Body size of female Carabus taedatus Fabricius, the largest-bodied species, was positively related to island area, while body size on the adjacent mainland was most similar to that on smaller islands. Overall, species with large body size and low dispersal ability, as indicated by flightlessness, were most sensitive to reductions in area. We suggest that large-bodied, flightless species are rare on small islands because habitat is less suitable for them and immigration rates are lower because they depend on freshwater drift for dispersal to islands."

This study was undertaken to evaluate dystrophin and calpain-1 in the transition from compensated cardiac hypertrophy to HF. Wistar rats were subjected to abdominal aorta constriction and killed at 30, 60 and 90 days post surgery (dps). Cardiac function and blood pressure were evaluated. The hearts were collected and Western blotting and immunofluorescence performed for dystrophin, calpain-1, alpha-fodrin and calpastatin. Statistical analyses were performed and considered significant when p<0.05. After 90 dps, 70% of the animals showed hypertrophic hearts (HH) and 30% hypertrophic+dilated hearts (HD). Systolic and diastolic functions were preserved at 30 and 60 dps, however, decreased in the HD group. Blood pressure, cardiomyocyte diameter and collagen content were increased at all time points. Dystrophin expression was lightly increased at 30 and 60 dps and HH group. HD group showed decreased expression of dystrophin and calpastatin and increased expression of calpain-1 and alpha-fodrin fragments. The first signals of dystrophin reduction were observed as early as 60 dps. In conclusion, some hearts present a distinct molecular pattern at an early stage of the disease; this pattern could provide an opportunity to identify these failure-prone hearts during the development of the cardiac disease. We showed that decreased expression of dystrophin and increased expression of calpains are coincident and could work as possible therapeutic targets to prevent heart failure as a consequence of cardiac hypertrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2779260363,"Introduction Coronary heart disease (CHD) patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) have higher rates of depression than the general population. However, few researchers have assessed the impact of depression on the secondary prevention of CHD in China. Objective The main purpose of this investigation was to explore the relationship between depression and secondary prevention of CHD in Chinese patients after PCI. Methods This descriptive, cross-sectional one-site study recruited both elective and emergency PCI patients one year after discharge. Data from 1934 patients were collected in the clinic using questionnaires and medical history records between August 2013 and September 2015. Depression was evaluated by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire. Secondary prevention of CHD was compared between depression and non-depression groups. Results We found that depression affected secondary prevention of CHD in the following aspects: lipid levels, blood glucose levels, smoking status, physical activity, BMI, and rates of medication use. Conclusions Depressive patients with CHD are at increased risk of not achieving the lifestyle and risk factor control goals recommended in the 2006 AHA guidelines. Screening should focus on patients after PCI because treating depression can improve outcomes by improving secondary prevention of CHD."
https://openalex.org/W2779796700,"Research shows that perception of physical size and status are positively associated. The current study was developed to replicate and extend earlier research on height perceptions of political leaders, indicating that supporters perceive their leaders as taller than non-supporters do, and winners are perceived as taller after the elections, while losers are perceived as shorter after the elections (winner/loser effects). Individuals use greater height and strength as indications of greater physical formidability. We hypothesized that in-group leaders' height and strength, but not weight, would be overestimated more compared to out-group leaders', and that this status-size association is not only driven by dominance, but also by prestige. We also tested whether previously found gender effects in estimates were due to using one's own height as an anchor, and we used an improved methodological approach by relying on multiple measurements of physical formidability and a within-subject design for testing winner/loser effects. The results of a two-part longitudinal study (self-selected sample via voting advice website; NWave1 = 2,011; NWave2 = 322) suggest that estimated physical formidability of political leaders is affected by motivated perception, as prestige was positively associated with estimated formidability, and in-group leaders were estimated more formidable than out-group leaders. We conclude that distortions in judged formidability related to social status are the result of motivated social perception in order to promote group functioning and leadership. Although we did not replicate a winner-effect (greater estimations of formidability after winning the elections), we did find some evidence for a loser-effect. Earlier suggestions that men make larger estimations than women because of their own larger body size are not supported. Implications for theory and future research are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2779880061,"Scatter contamination is one of the main sources of decreasing the image quality in cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). The moving blocker method is economic and effective for scatter correction (SC), which can simultaneously estimate scatter and reconstruct the complete volume within the field of view (FOV) from a single CBCT scan. However, at the regions with large intensity transition in the projection images along the axial blocker moving direction, the estimation of scatter signal from blocked regions in a single projection view can produce large error and cause significant artifacts in reconstructed images and null the usability of these regions. Furthermore, blocker edge detection error can significantly deteriorate both primary signal and scatter signal estimation and lead to unacceptable reconstruction results. In this study, we propose to use the adjacent multi-view projection images to jointly estimate scatter signal more accurately. In return, the more accurately estimated scatter signal can be utilized to detect blocker edges more accurately for greatly improved robustness of moving-blocker based SC. The experimental results using a Catphan phantom and an anthropomorphic pelvis phantom CBCT data show that the new method can effectively suppress the estimation errors of scatter signal in the fast signal transition regions and is able to correct the blocker detection errors. This development will expand the utility of moving-blocker based SC for the target with sharp intensity changes in the projection images and provide the needed robustness for its clinical translation."
https://openalex.org/W2780353862,"We previously found that 17β-estradiol (E2) stimulates apolipoprotein A-IV (apoA-IV) gene expression in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) of lean ovariectomized (OVX) rodents. Here we report that in the NTS of high-fat diet-induced obese (DIO) rats, the apoA-IV mRNA level is significantly reduced and that the estrogenic effects on apoA-IV gene expression and food intake are impaired. E2 regulates apoA-IV gene expression through its nuclear receptor α (ERα), which requires co-activators, such as steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1), to facilitate the transcription of targeted genes. Interestingly, SRC-1 gene expression is significantly reduced in DIO OVX rats. SRC-1 is colocalized with apoA-IV in the cells of the NTS and E2 treatment enhances the recruitment of ERα and SRC-1 to the estrogen response element at the apoA-V promoter, implying the participation of SRC-1 in E2’s stimulatory effect on apoA-IV gene expression. Using small hairpin RNA (shRNA), which was validated in cultured neuronal cells, we found that SRC-1 gene knockdown specifically in the NTS significantly diminished E2’s anorectic action, leading to increased food intake and body weight. More importantly, the stimulatory effect of E2 on apoA-IV gene expression in the NTS was significantly attenuated in SRC-1 knockdown rats. These results collectively demonstrate the critical roles of NTS SRC-1 in mediating E2’s actions on food intake and apoA-IV gene expression and suggest that reduced levels of endogenous SRC-1 and apoA-IV expression are responsible for the impaired E2’s anorectic action in obese females.

The appropriate number of CC personnel for minimizing rescuer's fatigue is mostly unknown.We determined the optimal number of personnel needed for 30-min CPR in a rescue-team.We conducted a randomized, manikin trial on healthcare providers. We divided them into Groups A to D according to the assigned different rest period to each group between the 2 min CCs. Groups A, B, C, and D performed CCs at 2, 4, 6, and 8 min rest period. All participants performed CCs for 30 min with a different rest period; participants allocated to Groups A, B, C, and D performed, eight, five, four, and three cycles, respectively. We compared a quality change of CCs among these groups to investigate how the assigned rest period affects the maintenance of CC quality during the 30-min CPR.This study involved 143 participants (male 58 [41%]; mean age, 24 years,) for the evaluation. As participants had less rest periods, the quality of their CCs such as sufficient depth ratio declined over 30-min CPR. A significant decrease in the sufficient CC depth ratio was observed in the second to the last cycle as compared to the first cycle. (median changes; A: -4%, B: -3%, C: 0%, and D: 0% p < 0.01).A 6 min rest period after 2 min CC is vital in order to sustain the quality of CC during a 30-min CPR cycle. At least four personnel may be needed to reduce rescuer's fatigue for a 30-min CPR cycle when the team consists of men and women."
https://openalex.org/W2780926567,"Objective Family-centered care (FCC) has been related to positive healthcare outcomes in pediatric care. Our aim was to assess whether an FCC approach also leads to better and earlier identification of social-emotional problems and less child psychosocial problems at age 18 months. Methods In a quasi-experimental study within routine well-child care in the Netherlands, we compared those regions in which an FCC approach was implemented (FCC-JointStart) to those regions with “care-as-usual” (CAU), including all children. In all regions, professionals performed well-child visits (2–18 months) and assessed social-emotional problems, or risks developing these, by rating outcomes of assessments as “not optimal” or as “a problem.” We compared FCC-JointStart and CAU regarding the rates of newly identified (risks for) social-emotional problems, the pace of identification over time, and the child’s psychosocial wellbeing at eighteen months as measured by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). For participants that received extra care, we compared FCC-JointStart and CAU regarding the severity of parent-reported problems. Parents were blinded, professionals were not. Results 5658 parents (68%) agreed to participate in the study. In the FCC-JointStart group, risks were identified more frequently, though differences were small (24.7% versus 22.0%, odds ratio (95%-confidence interval) adjusted for confounders: 1.44 (0.96; 2.18), Phi = .03). Risks were also identified earlier (p = .008), and additional care was provided to more severe cases than in CAU. Effect sizes r ranged from 0.17 (PSBC) to 0.22 (FAD). CBCL scores at 18 months did not differ between groups. Conclusions FFC-JointStart may contribute to more and earlier identification of risks for social-emotional problems and of families that need additional care, but not to fewer child psychosocial problems at age 18 months.

https://openalex.org/W2776368669,"The issue discussed in the current publication is a process of emulsions penetration in the granular media driven by the capillary force. The research work focuses on the study of rate and height of multiphase liquids penetration in a porous bed. Changes of the medium porosity and saturation level occurring as a result of pores obstruction by the droplets of an inner phase, were considered. The surfactant-stabilized emulsions with the different dispersed phase concentrations were investigated applying a classical wicking test. The modified version of Kozeny-Carman theory was proposed in order to describe the observed imbibition process in porous structures composed of spherical grains. This approach allowed to predict transport of emulsions considering an effect of bed saturation and porosity changes. In practice, the introduced concept can be appropriable in the numerous industries and scientific fields to predict the imbibition process of the multiphase liquids in granular structures regarding variation of the investigated bed permeability."
https://openalex.org/W2780743029,"The cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) and serum aluminum levels are both associated with mortality in hemodialysis patients. However, limited data regarding the association between serum aluminum levels and the CTR have been published to date. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate this association in patients on chronic hemodialysis (CHD). We investigated the association between the serum aluminum level and the CTR in CHD in a retrospective cross-sectional study of 547 Taiwanese patients on CHD. The mean age of patients was 62.5±13.2 years, with a mean hemodialysis time of 7.1±5.2 years. Among the patients, 36.9% were diabetic and 47.9% were male. After natural logarithmic transformation (ln(aluminum)), the serum aluminum level exhibited an independent and linear relationship with the CTR (β: 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.6-2.2). A high serum aluminum level (≥6 ng/dL) was significantly associated with a CTR >0.5 in the crude analysis (odds ratio (OR): 2.15, 95% CI, 1.52-3.04) and remained significant after multivariable adjustment (OR: 2.45, 95% CI, 1.63-3.67). Moreover, the ln(aluminum) value was significantly associated with a CTR >0.5 (OR: 1.71, 95%CI, 1.28-2.29) in multivariable analysis, indicating a dose effect of aluminum on cardiomegaly. In conclusion, the serum aluminum level was independently associated with cardiac remodeling (elevated CTR) in patients on CHD."
https://openalex.org/W2777084375,"This study examined the feasibility of quantitatively evaluating multiple biokinetic models and established the validity of the different compartment models using an assembled water phantom. Most commercialized phantoms are made to survey the imaging system since this is essential to increase the diagnostic accuracy for quality assurance. In contrast, few customized phantoms are specifically made to represent multi-compartment biokinetic models. This is because the complicated calculations as defined to solve the biokinetic models and the time-consuming verifications of the obtained solutions are impeded greatly the progress over the past decade. Nevertheless, in this work, five biokinetic models were separately defined by five groups of simultaneous differential equations to obtain the time-dependent radioactive concentration changes inside the water phantom. The water phantom was assembled by seven acrylic boxes in four different sizes, and the boxes were linked to varying combinations of hoses to signify the multiple biokinetic models from the biomedical perspective. The boxes that were connected by hoses were then regarded as a closed water loop with only one infusion and drain. 129.1±24.2 MBq of Tc-99m labeled methylene diphosphonate (MDP) solution was thoroughly infused into the water boxes before gamma scanning; then the water was replaced with de-ionized water to simulate the biological removal rate among the boxes. The water was driven by an automatic infusion pump at 6.7 c.c./min, while the biological half-life of the four different-sized boxes (64, 144, 252, and 612 c.c.) was 4.8, 10.7, 18.8, and 45.5 min, respectively. The five models of derived time-dependent concentrations for the boxes were estimated either by a self-developed program run in MATLAB or by scanning via a gamma camera facility. Either agreement or disagreement between the practical scanning and the theoretical prediction in five models was thoroughly discussed. The derived biokinetic model represented the metabolic mechanism in the human body and helped to solidify the internal circulatory system into concert with numerical verification."

An machine-vision system of gap inspection for grafted muskmelon seedlings was developed in this study. The image acquiring system consists of a CCD camera, a lens and a front white lighting source. The image of inspected gap was processed and analyzed by software of HALCON 12.0. The recognition algorithm for the system is based on principle of deformable template matching. A template should be created from an image of qualified grafted seedling gap. Then the gap image of the grafted seedling will be compared with the created template to determine their matching degree. Based on the similarity between the gap image of grafted seedling and the template, the matching degree will be 0 to 1. The less similar for the grafted seedling gap with the template the smaller of matching degree. Thirdly, the gap will be output as qualified or unqualified. If the matching degree of grafted seedling gap and the template is less than 0.58, or there is no match is found, the gap will be judged as unqualified; otherwise the gap will be qualified. Finally, 100 muskmelon seedlings were grafted and inspected to test the gap inspection system. Results showed that the gap inspection machine-vision system could recognize the gap qualification correctly as 98% of human vision. And the inspection speed of this system can reach 15 seedlings·min-1. The gap inspection process in grafting can be fully automated with this developed machine-vision system, and the gap inspection system will be a key step of a fully-automatic grafting robots."
https://openalex.org/W2781034821,"The accurate characterization of proteins in both their native and denatured states is essential to effectively understand protein function, folding and stability. As a proof of concept, a micro rheological method is applied, based on the characterization of thermal fluctuations of a micro cantilever immersed in a bovine serum albumin solution, to assess changes in the viscosity associated with modifications in the protein's structure under the denaturant effect of urea. Through modeling the power spectrum density of the cantilever's fluctuations over a broad frequency band, it is possible to implement a fitting procedure to accurately determine the viscosity of the fluid, even at low volumes. Increases in viscosity during the denaturant process are identified using the assumption that the protein is a hard sphere, with a hydrodynamic radius that increases during unfolding. This is modeled accordingly through the Einstein-Batchelor formula. The Einstein-Batchelor formula estimates are verified through dynamic light scattering, which measures the hydrodynamic radius of proteins. Thus, this methodology is proven to be suitable for the study of protein folding in samples of small size at vanishing shear stresses."
https://openalex.org/W2780937367,"Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC) cells expression of a novel carbohydrate antigen was defined using a human VH4-34 encoded IgM monoclonal antibody (mAb216). MAb216 binds to a poly N-acetyllactosamine epitope expressed on B cells and kills normal and malignant B cells in vitro and in vivo. EOC patient ascites and EOC cell lines were used to study the anti tumor effect of mAb216. Various assays were used to characterize the epitope and demonstrate antibody-mediated binding and cytotoxicity in EOC. Drug and antibody combination effects were determined by calculating the combination index values using the Chou and Talalay method. MAb216 displays direct antibody mediated cytotoxicity on a population of human EOC tumor and ascites samples and EOC cell lines, which express high amounts of poly N-acetyllactosamine epitope, carried by CD147/CD98. Eighty four percent of patient samples, including platin resistant, had a tumor population that bound the monoclonal antibody. The binding pattern of mAb216 and mechanism of cytotoxicity was similar to that seen on normal and malignant B cells with unique general membrane disruption and ""pore"" formation. In vitro incubation with mAb216 and cisplatin enhanced killing of OVCAR3 cell line. In EOC cell lines percent cytotoxicity correlated with percent expression of epitope. Although in vitro data shows specific EOC cytotoxicity, for possible treatment of EOC MAb216 would need to be evaluated in a clinical trial with or without chemotherapy."

Network function virtualization (NFV) can improve the speed and flexibility of network service deployment. However, with the evolution of the network, network service layout may become inefficient. Regarding this problem, this paper proposes a service chain migration (SCM) method with the framework of ""software defined network + network function virtualization"" (SDN+NFV), which migrates service chains to adapt to network evolution and improves the efficiency of the network service layout. SCM is modeled as an integer linear programming problem and resolved via particle swarm optimization. An SCM prototype system is designed based on an SDN controller. Experiments demonstrate that SCM could reduce the network traffic cost and energy consumption efficiently."
