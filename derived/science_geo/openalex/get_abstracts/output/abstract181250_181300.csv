https://openalex.org/W1991991142,"The abnormal accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) in the brain is an early and invariant feature in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is believed to play a pivotal role in the etiology and pathogenesis of the disease. As such, a major focus of AD research has been the elucidation of the mechanisms responsible for the generation of Aβ. As with any peptide, however, the degree of Aβ accumulation is dependent not only on its production but also on its removal. In cell-based and in vitro models we have previously characterized endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1) as an Aβ-degrading enzyme that appears to act intracellularly, thus limiting the amount of Aβ available for secretion. To determine the physiological significance of this activity, we analyzed Aβ levels in the brains of mice deficient for ECE-1 and a closely related enzyme, ECE-2. Significant increases in the levels of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 were found in the brains of these animals when compared with age-matched littermate controls. The increase in Aβ levels in the ECE-deficient mice provides the first direct evidence for a physiological role for both ECE-1 and ECE-2 in limiting Aβ accumulation in the brain and also provides further insight into the factors involved in Aβ clearance in vivo."

Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) was achieved either directly by treatment with 4-α-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or by activating the Gαq-coupled human substance P receptor (hNK-1) co-expressed with hDAT in HEK293 cells and in N2A neuroblastoma cells. In both cell lines, activation of the hNK-1 receptor by substance P reduced the V max for [3H]dopamine uptake to the same degree as did PMA (∼50 and ∼20% in HEK293 and N2A cells, respectively). In HEK293 cells, the reduction in transport capacity could be accounted for by internalization of the transporter, as assessed by cell surface biotinylation experiments, and by fluorescence microscopy using enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged hDAT. In HEK293 cells, hNK-1 receptor activation, as well as direct PKC activation by PMA, was accompanied by a marked increase in transporter phosphorylation. However, truncation of the first 22 N-terminal residues almost abolished detectable phosphorylation without affecting the SP- or PMA-induced reduction in transport capacity and internalization. In this background truncation construct, systematic mutation of all the phosphorylation consensus serines and threonines in hDAT, alone and in various combinations, did also not alter the effect of hNK-1 receptor activation or PMA treatment in either HEK293 or N2A cells. Mutation of a dileucine and of two tyrosine-based motifs in hDAT was similarly without effect. We conclude that the major phosphorylation sites in hDAT are within the distal N terminus, which contains several serines. Moreover, the present data strongly suggest that neither this phosphorylation, nor the phosphorylation of any other sites within hDAT, is required for either receptor-mediated or direct PKC-mediated internalization of the hDAT.

Accordingly, the transporter plays a critical role in regulating the availability of dopamine in the synaptic cleft and thus in modulating the physiological functions of dopamine, including locomotor activity, higher cognitive functions, and neuroendocrine systems (1Amara S.G. Kuhar M.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 73-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 2Giros B. Caron M.G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 43-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the DAT is the principle target for the action of widely abused psychostimulants such as cocaine and amphetamine (1Amara S.G. Kuhar M.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 73-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 2Giros B. Caron M.G. Trends Pharmacol.

The transporter belongs to the family of Na+/Cl−-dependent transporters, along with transporters for several other neurotransmitters including the norepinephrine (NET), serotonin (SERT), γ-aminobutyric acid (GAT), and glycine (GLYT) transporters (3Norregaard L. Gether U. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Dev. 2001; 4: 591-601PubMed Google Scholar, 4Chen N. Reith M.E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 405: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This class of transporters is characterized structurally by 12 transmembrane segments, intracellular N and C termini, and a large glycosylated second extracellular loop (3Norregaard L. Gether U. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Dev. 2001; 4: 591-601PubMed Google Scholar, 4Chen N. Reith M.E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 405: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). No high resolution structural information is available for any related transporter, and our insight into the packing of the 12 helices remains quite limited (3Norregaard L. Gether U. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Dev. 2001; 4: 591-601PubMed Google Scholar, 4Chen N. Reith M.E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 405: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Given the critical role of the DAT in regulating dopaminergic neurotransmission, it is not surprising that the activity and availability of the DAT at the cell surface is tightly regulated. Most significantly, activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by phorbol esters such as 4-α-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) is known to lead to an acute reduction in the activity of the dopamine transporter (for review, see Refs. 5Blakely R.D. Bauman A.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 6Robinson M.B. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 7Zahniser N.R. Doolen S. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 92: 21-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). This has been demonstrated both in synaptosomal preparations (8Vaughan R.A. Huff R.A. Uhl G.R. Kuhar M.J. J.

Ther. 1996; 277: 1527-1532PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in transfected cell lines and Xenopus oocytes (10Huff R.A. Vaughan R.A. Kuhar M.J. Uhl G.R. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 11Zhu S.J. Kavanaugh M.P. Sonders M.S. Amara S.G. Zahniser N.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Chem. 1999; 274: 35794-35801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). A similar effect of PKC activation has also been observed for other neurotransmitter transporters within the same class including the SERT, NET, GAT-1, and GLYT-1 (reviewed in Refs. 5Blakely R.D. Bauman A.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 6Robinson M.B. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 7Zahniser N.R. Doolen S. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 92: 21-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Compelling evidence suggests that the PKC-mediated reduction in uptake is the result of an internalization of the transporters rather than a change in the activity of the transporter molecules residing in the membrane (5Blakely R.D. Bauman A.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 6Robinson M.B. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 7Zahniser N.R.

Synapse. 1998; 30: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The internalization of the DAT is believed to occur via a clathrin and dynamin-dependent mechanism, resulting in accumulation of the transporter in early endosomes where it co-localizes with transferrin (13Daniels G.M. Amara S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35794-35801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The activation of PKC leads to a marked increase in phosphorylation of DAT (8Vaughan R.A. Huff R.A. Uhl G.R. Kuhar M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15541-15546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 9Copeland B.J. Vogelsberg V. Neff N.H. Hadjiconstantinou M. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

It has been hypothesized, therefore, albeit without direct evidence, that serine and/or threonine phosphorylation of the DAT is the molecular event that drives the internalization process. In light of the predicted high specificity by which these transporters are regulated, it would accordingly be expected that a specific Ser/Thr phosphorylation site (or sites) could be identified within the intracellular domains of the transporter and that mutation of this site(s) would result in a concomitant impairment of internalization and phosphorylation. Alternatively, the phosphorylation could represent an independent process and phosphorylation of unidentified associated proteins may be the actual trigger of the internalization process. In the present study, we have investigated the structural basis and putative role of direct phosphorylation of DAT for its acute down-regulation and internalization. Importantly, we examine not only phosphorylation induced by direct PKC stimulation with phorbol esters but also that induced upon activation of a Gαq-coupled human substance P (hNK-1) receptor co-expressed with hDAT in HEK293 cells (human embryonic kidney cells) and in N2A neuroblastoma cells. The hNK-1 receptor was chosen as a typical Gαq-coupled receptor that stimulates PKC activity via Gαq-dependent activation of phospholipase C (16Quartara L. Maggi C.A. Neuropeptides. 1997; 31: 537-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), is expressed in dopaminergic neurons along with DAT (17Futami T. Hatanaka Y. Matsushita K. Furuya S. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 54: 183-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and shown to involved in dopamine release (18Tremblay L. Kemel M.L. Desban M. Gauchy C. Glowinski J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11214-11218Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Our results show that activation of the co-expressed hNK-1 receptor, as well as direct activation of PKC by phorbol esters, markedly reduced the transport capacity of DAT and that this reduction can be accounted for by rapid internalization of the transporter to an intracellular compartment. Moreover, in agreement with a recent in vivo study of phosphorylation of the rat DAT (19Foster J.D. Pananusorn B. Vaughan R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25178-25186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), evidence is obtained that the increase in transporter phosphorylation seen in response to both hNK-1 receptor and PKC activation is caused almost entirely by phosphorylation of the distal N terminus of DAT. Neither receptor-mediated nor direct PKC-mediated internalization of DAT, however, is impaired by truncation of the putative sites of phosphorylation, suggesting that DAT internalization is not dependent on DAT phosphorylation. Subsequent mutation, alone and in combination, of multiple serines and threonines throughout the intracellular domains of the transporter, also had no effect on hNK-1 receptor-mediated or direct PKC-mediated internalization of DAT, thereby providing additional support for the dissociation of internalization and phosphorylation, at least in two heterologous expression systems. The cDNA encoding the human dopamine transporter (hDAT) in pRC/CMV (20Giros B. el Mestikawy S. Godinot N. Zheng K. Han H. Yang-Feng T. Caron M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 383-390PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Marc G. Caron (Duke University, Durham, NC). The FLAG-tag sequence (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys) (Sigma) was added to the N terminus of the hDAT cDNA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-derived mutagenesis using Pfu polymerase according to the instructions from the manufacturer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The resulting FLAG-hDAT construct was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The mutations Y335A (21Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Litman T. Gether U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1683-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), D436A, D436A/L440A/L441A, and Y575A were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis in the background of this construct (pcDNA3- FLAG-hDAT). The truncation mutant Δ1–22FLAG-HA-hDAT (HA is hemagglutinin) was generated from a synthetic hDAT cDNA as previously described (22Hastrup H. Karlin A. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10055-10060Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and cloned into the bicistronic expression vector pCIhygro containing the hygromycin resistance gene (23Rees S. Coote J. Stables J. Goodson S. Harris S. Lee M.G. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). All serine and threonine mutations, as well as Y593A, were generated in the background of pCIhygro-Δ1–22FLAG-HA-hDAT. The cDNA encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was fused to the N terminus of synthetic hDAT cDNA and inserted into pCIhygro resulting in pCIhygro-EGFP-hDAT (21Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Litman T. Gether U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1683-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding the human hNK-1 (substance P) receptor was excised from pTEJ-8 (24Jensen C.J. Gerard N.P. Schwartz T.W. Gether U. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 294-299PubMed Google Scholar) and cloned into the bicistronic expression vector pCIN4 (23Rees S. Coote J. Stables J. Goodson S. Harris S. Lee M.G. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). For all mutations, the generated PCR fragments were digested with the appropriate enzymes, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and cloned into the appropriate eukaryotic expression vectors. All mutations were confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping and automated DNA sequencing. HEK293 cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Glutamax I supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 0.01 mg/ml gentamicin (all products from Invitrogen). N2A neuroblastoma cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Earle's salts with Glutamax-1 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mmsodium pyruvate, 0.05 g/liter streptomycin, and 0.06 g/liter penicillin G (all products from Invitrogen). For stable expression, the HEK293 or N2A cells were seeded in 100-mm tissue culture plates, grown to ∼30% confluence, and subsequently transfected with 2 μg of the pCIN4 or PCIhygro constructs using the LipofectAMINETM/Opti-MEMTM (Invitrogen) transfection system. A stably transfected pool was selected with Geneticin (G418) (0.35 mg/ml) or hygromycin (0.35 mg/ml), respectively, as previously described (25Javitch J.A. Fu D. Liapakis G. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18546-18549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). For stable co-expression, a G418-resistant cell line expressing the hNK-1 receptor was transfected with the desired hDAT constructs and stable cell pools expressing both the hNK-1 receptor and the appropriate hDAT construct were obtained by combined selection with hygromycin (0.25 mg/ml) and G418 (0.1 mg/ml). Uptake assays were modified from Giros et al. (20Giros B. el Mestikawy S. Godinot N. Zheng K. Han H. Yang-Feng T. Caron M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 383-390PubMed Google Scholar) using 2,5,6-[3H]dopamine (7–21 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom). Transfected cells were plated in poly-d-lysine-coated 24-well dishes (2 × 105 to 4 × 105 cells/well). The cells were grown for 48 h prior to the experiment. On the day of the experiment, the cells were washed once in 500 μl of uptake buffer (7.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.1, with 5 mm Tris base, 120 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.2 mmCaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mml-ascorbic acid, 5 mmd-glucose, and 1 μm amount of the catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor Ro 41–0960 (26Percy E. Kaye D.M. Lambert G.W. Gruskin S. Esler M.D. Du X.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 774-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Subsequently, indicated concentrations of 4-α-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma), substance P (Peninsula Laboratories, Inc., San Carlos, CA), okadaic acid (Sigma), staurosporine (Sigma), or vehicle were added in a final volume of 400 μl of uptake buffer before incubation for 30 min at 37 °C. The uptake experiment was initiated by addition of 70 nm [3H]dopamine to a final volume of 500 μl. Nonspecific uptake was determined in the presence of 1 mm non-labeled dopamine (Research Biochemicals International, Natick, MA). For determination ofV max and K m values, increasing concentrations of non-labeled dopamine (11 different concentrations in triplicate) were added immediately before [3H]dopamine. After 5 min of incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed twice with 500 μl of uptake buffer, lysed in 300 μl of 1% SDS, and left 1 h at 37 °C. All samples were transferred to 24-well counting plates (Wallac, Turku, Finland), 600 μl of Opti-phase Hi Safe 3 scintillation fluid (Wallac) was added, and the plates were counted in a Wallac Tri-Lux β-scintillation counter (Wallac). All determinations were performed in triplicate. Binding assays were carried out essentially as described (27Holst B. Zoffmann S. Elling C.E. Hjorth S.A. Schwartz T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) on whole cells using125I-labeled substance P (2000 Ci/mmol) (AmershamBiosciences, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom) as radioligand. Transfected cells were plated in poly-d-lysine-coated 96-well dishes (2 × 104 cells/well). The cells were incubated for 48 h prior to the experiment. Binding assays were performed in a final volume of 100 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MnCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 40 μg/ml bacitracin) with 0.4 nm125I-labeled substance P plus increasing concentrations of non-labeled substance P for determination of B max andK D values. Binding was terminated after 2 h at 4 °C by washing the cells twice in 200 μl of binding buffer. 200 μl of Opti-phase Hi Safe 3 scintillation fluid (Wallac) was added to each sample, and the plates were counted in a Wallac Tri-Lux β-scintillation counter (Wallac). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm substance P. Determinations were made in triplicate. Biotinylation of cell surface proteins was performed by reaction with the membrane-impermeant amine-specific biotinylating reagent sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce). Transfected HEK293 cells were seeded in poly-d-lysine-coated 100-mm cell culture dishes (Corning, Corning, NY) at 5 × 106 cells/dish and grown for 24 h before the experiment. Cells were stimulated with 200 nm SP, 1 μm PMA, or vehicle for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were subsequently washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)/Ca-Mg, pH 7.3, before treatment with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (1.5 mg/ml) at 4 °C for 40 min in PBS/Ca-Mg, followed by two washes with 100 mm glycine in PBS/Ca-Mg, and incubation with 100 mm glycine for 20 min. The cells were washed with PBS/Ca-Mg and lysed with 3 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, with 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm N-ethyl maleimide, 200 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Diagnostics)), scraped off, and centrifuged at 1,000 ×g for 5 min. The cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of solubilization buffer (lysis buffer supplemented with 150 mm NaCl and 1.0% Triton X) and left for 30 min at 4 °C with constant shaking. Lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentration in the supernatants was determined using a Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. Monomeric avidin beads (175 μl) (Pierce) were added to the samples, 500 μg of total cell protein was used for the Δ1–22 and N′ mutants, whereas 1000 and 1500 μg were used for the for N+C and ICL mutants, respectively. The volume was adjusted to 1.0 ml with solubilization buffer, and the samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were washed four times with solubilization buffer, before elution with 50 μl of 2× loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 10% SDS, 0.1m dithiothreitol, and 0.2% bromphenol blue) for 30 min at room temperature. The eluates (25 μl) were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) and immunoblotted with monoclonal mouse HA antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:2000. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000) and the ECL detection method (Amersham Biosciences). Quantification of bands was performed on a model 300A densitometer in combination with ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences) by using film exposures that were in the linear range. Transfected HEK293 cells (3.5 × 106) were seeded in poly-d-lysine-coated 25-cm2 flasks and grown for 48 h reaching ∼70% confluence. The cells were washed in phosphate-free medium before labeling at 37 °C for 4h in phosphate-free medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and 1.0 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (AmershamBiosciences). Upon the addition of phosphatase inhibitors, 1 μm okadaic acid and 50 μmNa3VO4, the cells were stimulated with 200 nm SP, 1 μm PMA, or vehicle for 60 min followed by washing in 5 ml ice-cold PBS and subsequent lysis by shaking for 15 min on ice in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, with 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 μm okadaic acid, and 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitors (0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and a protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Diagnostics)). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and precleared with 4 mg/ml mouse IgG and 100 μl of protein G-Sepharose before immunoprecipitation for 1 h at 4 °C using an antibody against the FLAG epitope (2 μg of M2 antibody, Sigma). For immunoprecipitation of the Δ1–22FLAG-HA-hDAT, 900 μg of total cell protein was used, and, for immunoprecipitation of FLAG-hDAT, 750 μg was used. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10%) and either transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and blotted with a biotinylated M2 antibody (Sigma) according to instructions from the manufacturer or exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, quantified using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed with ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Stably transfected HEK293 cells were seeded in eight-well Lab-Tek II glass chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL). After 36 h, the medium was changed to uptake buffer and the cells were incubated in the presence of indicated substances or vehicle (control) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were examined using a confocal microscope (Leica DM IRBE HCB S100 Fluo TCS) microscope (magnification, ×63). The filter sets for the epifluorescence were BP 450–490 nm for excitation of EGFP, and the emitted light passed through a LP 515-nm filter. Uptake and binding data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis using Prism 3.0 from GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA. One-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett'spost hoc test was used for statistical comparisons. The hNK-1 (substance P) receptor, which is a typical Gαq-coupled 7-transmembrane segment receptor (16Quartara L. Maggi C.A. Neuropeptides. 1997; 31: 537-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), was stably expressed in HEK293 cells using the bicistronic vector pCIN4 (23Rees S. Coote J. Stables J. Goodson S. Harris S. Lee M.G. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Expression of the receptor was demonstrated by detection of specific high affinity binding of 125I-labeled substance P in a whole cell binding assay (K D = 0.22 ± 0.04 nm,B max = 3.2 ± 1.3 fmol/10,000 cells,n = 4). Specific binding could not be detected in non-transfected cells (data not shown). The effect of hNK-1 receptor activation on hDAT activity in comparison to that of direct PKC activation by phorbol esters was investigated upon transient expression of the hDAT tagged at the N terminus with the FLAG epitope (FLAG-hDAT) in the hNK-1 receptor-expressing cells. Note that the addition of this FLAG tag does not affect the functional properties of the protein. 2L. Norregaard, C. J. Loland, and U. Gether, unpublished observation. In agreement with previous observations, stimulation with the phorbol ester PMA (1 μm for 30 min) resulted in a marked reduction in transporter uptake capacity (∼50%) that could be reversed by the PKC inhibitor staurosporine (Fig. 1 A). Also as expected, the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid reduced uptake capacity, although to a smaller extent (∼25%) (Fig. 1 A). These responses were compared with those observed in response to the hNK-1 receptor agonist substance P. As shown in Fig. 1 A, stimulation with 200 nm substance P for 30 min reduced 3H]dopamine uptake capacity to approximately the same extent as PMA. Importantly, a similar effect of 200 nm substance P was observed for the non-tagged hDAT (data not shown). The combined addition of PMA and substance P as well as the combined addition of okadaic acid and substance P resulted in only marginally higher responses than those observed in response to the individual compounds (Fig. 1 A). Addition of the PKC inhibitor staurosporine markedly inhibited the response to substance P, although not as efficiently as it inhibited the response to PMA. This suggests that the inhibitory effect of substance P on hDAT is mediated, at least in part, via PKC, consistent with the ability of the hNK-1 receptor to activate Gαq-dependent pathways. The acute down-regulation observed in response to substance P treatment of HEK293 cells co-expressing the hDAT and the hNK-1 receptor was further investigated. Incubation of the cells co-expressing FLAG-hDAT and hNK-1 with increasing concentrations of substance P for 30 min caused a dose-dependent reduction in the specific [3H]dopamine uptake with an EC50 of 5.5 ± 0.1 nm (n = 5) and a maximal inhibition of around 40% (Fig. 1 B). Addition of 1 μmselective high affinity hNK-1 receptor antagonist LY303870 (28Gitter B.D. Bruns R.F. Howbert J.J. Waters D.C. Threlkeld P.G. Cox L.M. Nixon J.A. Lobb K.L. Mason N.R. Stengel P.W. et al.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 275: 737-744PubMed Google Scholar) essentially eliminated the effect of substance P on [3H]dopamine uptake (Fig. 1 B), consistent with the specific action of substance P at hNK-1. Moreover, no effect of substance P was observed when the same experiments were performed on HEK293 cells expressing FLAG-hDAT but not the hNK-1 receptor (data not shown). Finally, to assess the mechanism of the inhibitory effect of substance P"

We find human PON1 acted as a phospholipase A2 but not as a phospholipase C or D through cleavage of phosphodiester bonds as expected. PON1 requires divalent cations, but EDTA did not block the phospholipase A2 activity of PON1. In contrast, a serine esterase inhibitor abolished phospholipase activity even though PON1 has no active-site serine residues. PAF acetylhydrolase, an oxidized phospholipid phospholipase A2, is a serine esterase associated with specific HDL particles. Western blotting did not reveal detectable amounts of PAF acetylhydrolase in PON1 preparations, although very low amounts of PAF acetylhydrolase might still account for PON1 phospholipase A2 activity. We revised the standard PON1 purification by first depleting HDL of PAF acetylhydrolase to find PON1 purified in this way no longer hydrolyzed oxidized phospholipids or PAF. Serum from a donor with an inactivating mutation in the PAF acetylhydrolase gene did not hydrolyze oxidized phospholipids or PAF, yet displayed full paraoxonase activity. We conclude that PAF acetylhydrolase is the sole phospholipase A2 of HDL and that PON1 has no phospholipase activity toward PAF or pro-atherogenic oxidized phospholipids.

Insects and birds, in contrast to mammals, lack this activity, rendering them sensitive to various organophosphates (1Mackness M.I. Mackness B. Durrington P.N. Connelly P.W. Hegele R.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1996; 7: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of these substrates by PON1 is Ca2+-dependent, and the enzyme is extraordinarily sensitive to EDTA (2Kuo C.L. La Du B.N. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1995; 23: 935-944PubMed Google Scholar); for instance EDTA used as an anti-coagulant destabilizes and irreversibly inactivates the enzyme (3Mackness M.I. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 136: 195-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). PON1 is of interest for a second reason documented in a broad range of literature (4Mackness M.I. Arrol S. Durrington P.N.

For example, mice lacking PON1 are more susceptible to organophosphate toxicity and are also more susceptible to atherosclerosis when fed a high fat diet (7Shih D.M., Gu, L. Xia Y.R. Navab M., Li, W.F. Hama S. Castellani L.W. Furlong C.E. Costa L.G. Fogelman A.M. Lusis A.J. Nature. 1998; 394: 284-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). Additionally PON1 has two common phenotypes that affect catalysis with certain substrates, and one phenotype correlates with a propensity toward vascular disease (14Jarvik G.P. Rozek L.S. Brophy V.H. Hatsukami T.S. Richter R.J. Schellenberg G.D. Furlong C.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2441-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Additionally, there are polymorphisms that affect circulating PON1 levels (15Furlong C.E. Cole T.B. Jarvik G.P. Costa L.G. Pharmacogenomics. 2002; 3: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) that may alter the propensity to develop vascular disease.Despite the association of PON1 with less vascular disease, two essential components in defining a biologic role for PON1 remain mysterious. The biologic substrate of PON1 is unknown, because it did not evolve to detoxify organophosphorous pesticides and neurotoxins and, at least in part because of the uncertainty over its substrates, the way by which PON1 lessens atherogenesis is also unknown. The search for a mechanistic role for PON1 reveals that it acts as an antioxidant (11Durrington P.N. Mackness B. Mackness M.I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar) and has peroxidase activity (6Aviram M. Rosenblat M. Bisgaier C.L. Newton R.S. Primo-Parmo S.L. La Du B.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1581-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). However, the antioxidant activity of PON1 is independent of its esterase activity (16Cao H. Girard-Globa A. Berthezene F. Moulin P. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 133-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is at variance with its aryl esterase activity in isoforms arising from genetic polymorphisms (11Durrington P.N. Mackness B. Mackness M.I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 16Cao H. Girard-Globa A. Berthezene F. Moulin P. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 133-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and is unaffected by either heat or EDTA treatment that destroy aryl esterase activity (16Cao H. Girard-Globa A. Berthezene F. Moulin P. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 133-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PON1 has a single unpaired cysteine residue that mutagenesis shows has no role in catalysis or stability (17Sorenson R.C. Primo-Parmo S.L. Kuo C.L. Adkins S. Lockridge O. La Du B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7187-7191Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), but this residue is absolutely essential for the antioxidant effect of PON1 (10Aviram M. Hardak E. Vaya J. Mahmood S. Milo S. Hoffman A. Billicke S. Draganov D. Rosenblat M. Circulation. 2000; 101: 2510-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 18Aviram M. Billecke S. Sorenson R. Bisgaier C. Newton R. Rosenblat M. Erogul J. Hsu C. Dunlop C. La Du B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1617-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The possibility that PON1 has two active sites that separately catalyze its esterase and antioxidant activities has been raised (11Durrington P.N. Mackness B. Mackness M.I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar).Oxidized lipoprotein particles contain pro-inflammatory lipid mediators that include ones that functionally mimic the potent phospholipid mediator platelet-activating factor (PAF) (19McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25189-25192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). PAF initiates physiologic inflammation and is active at picomolar levels. PAF is recognized by a single molecularly characterized receptor found on a number of cells that comprise the innate immune system (20Izumi T. Shimizu T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). High affinity recognition of PAF by the PAF receptor depends on ansn-1 ether bond, the short acetyl sn-2 residue, and the choline head group of this phospholipid mediator. Oxidation ofsn-2 polyunsaturated fatty acyl residues of ether phosphatidylcholines, as occurs during oxidation of lipoprotein particles, generates phospholipid products with shortenedsn-2 residues that are inflammatory agents (21Silva A.R. de Assis E.F. Caiado L.F. Marathe G.K. Bozza M.T. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. Bozza P.T. Castro-Faria-Neto H.C. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4112-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) because they are PAF receptor agonists (22Heery J.M. Kozak M. Stafforini D.M. Jones D.A. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M.

The oxidative formation of PAF-like lipids results from an unregulated chemical reaction, in contrast to the tight regulation of PAF synthesis (24Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 419-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), and this process occurs in atherosclerotic lesions (25Watson A.D. Leitinger N. Navab M. Faull K.F.

This enzyme is a serine esterase with the signature catalytic triad (30Tjoelker L.W. Eberhardt C. Unger J. Trong H.L. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Gray P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25481-25487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and so is sensitive to serine esterase inhibitors but not divalent ion chelators. PAF acetylhydrolase circulates in association with LDL and HDL particles and can migrate between them in a pH-dependent fashion (31Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Carter M.E. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4215-4222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).PON1 is reported to hydrolyze PAF (32Rodrigo L. Mackness B. Durrington P.N. Hernandez A. Mackness M.I. Biochem.

The existence of two distinct enzymes in the same lipoprotein particle apparently catalyzing the same reaction has yet to be tested directly. Here, we show that trace amounts of PAF acetylhydrolase contaminate PON1 preparations and that PON1 lacking PAF acetylhydrolase displays no phospholipase activity.MATERIALS AND METHODSCibacron blue 3GA-agarose (type 3000-CL), DEAE-Sepharose 6B, concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B, deoxycholate, methyl-α-d-mannopyranoside, IGEPAL CA-630, potassium bromide, phenyl acetate, phospholipase A2 (bee venom), phospholipase C (Bacillus cereus), and phospholipase D (cabbage) were from Sigma, and Extracti-gel was from Pierce.

Smolen A. Eckerson H.W. La Du B.N. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1991; 19: 100-106PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Human blood was collected in heparin, and plasma was generated from this and then calcified with CaCl2 to a final concentration of 1 mm before the resulting fibrin clot was separated by centrifugation. In few experiments the plasma pH was adjusted to either to pH 6.0 or to pH 9.0 with 1 n HCl or NaOH prior to an overnight incubation. These plasma samples (9 ml) were adjusted to a density of 1.3 with potassium bromide and then layered with 27 ml of saline in a centrifuge tube prior to ultracentrifugation for 3 h at 150,000 × g to separate HDL and LDL. HDL particles enriched with PON1 were mixed with Cibacron blue 3GA-agarose in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), and loosely bound proteins were removed with 4 m NaCl buffer. PON1 bound to the Cibacron blue was then eluted with 0.1% deoxycholate and mixed with either DEAE-biogel or DEAE-Sepharose 6B in 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630 (rather than Nonidet P-40) before PON1 with was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0.0–0.5 m) in 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630. DEAE fractions containing aryl esterase activity were diluted and rechromatographed on a DEAE-Sepharose 6B column. The final purification step used a concanavalin A-Sepharose column, and material from this step was concentrated with a Centricon apparatus. We resolved the proteins in the various fractions by 12% SDS-PAGE. PON1 was made detergent-free by passing it over Extracti-gel when the products of its reaction(s) were to be analyzed in a bioassay.Aryl esterase activity of PON1 was determined spectrophotometrically using phenyl acetate as the substrate (2Kuo C.L. La Du B.N. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1995; 23: 935-944PubMed Google Scholar). The assay contained 1 mm phenyl acetate, 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), and 1 mm CaCl2. Blanks without enzyme were used to correct for spontaneous hydrolysis. Activity was calculated from the molar extinction coefficient at 270 nm (using differences in the absorbance of phenol versus phenyl acetate) of 1310m−1 cm−1. One unit of aryl esterase activity was defined as a micromole of phenyl acetate hydrolyzed per min.We measured PAF acetylhydrolase activity using [3H]acetate-PAF as described by Stafforini et al.

For this, human neutrophils were isolated by dextran sedimentation and centrifugation over Ficoll as before (35Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Clin.

The amount of PAF stated in the figures (typically at 10−10m) was pretreated with detergent-free PON1 or recombinant PAF acetylhydrolase for the specified time at 37 °C before the entire reaction was tested in the Ca2+ mobilization assay. We find as little as 5 to 10 ng of PAF acetylhydrolase in 15 min abolishes the calcium signal generated by 0.1 nm PAF. In some experiments, purified PON1 was pretreated for 1 h at 37 °C with either EDTA (100 μm) or the serine esterase inhibitor Pefabloc (100 μm) prior to assay. In some experiments PAF or 2-O-methyl PAF were treated with 10 μg of bee venom phospholipase A2 (in 0.5% human serum albumin in Hank's balanced salt solution with 10 mm Ca2+), 10 units of phospholipase C (B. cereus), or 10 units of phospholipase D (cabbage) for 2 h at 37 °C and then tested in the Ca2+-flux bioassay. The analysis of Ca2+flux in PMN was as described (23Marathe G.K. Davies S.S. Harrison K.A. Silva A.R. Murphy R.C. Castro-Faria Neto H. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol.

The resolved proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and probed with PAF acetylhydrolase polyclonal antibody (diluted 1:1000). A standard of truncated, non-glycosylated (the form approved for clinical trials) recombinant PAF acetylhydrolase was examined in a separate lane of the gel. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody was the secondary antibody (diluted 1:10000) with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent used for visualization. In some experiments, the primary anti-PAF acetylhydrolase antibody was pre-incubated with 200 μg per blot of the cognate blocking peptide.DISCUSSIONWe discovered that highly purified preparations of human PON1 inactivate PAF and PAF-like oxidatively fragmented phospholipids by hydrolyzing the sn-2 residue to produce two inactive products, lysoPAF and a short chain free fatty acid. This reaction suppresses atherogenesis, and it protects lipoprotein particles from chemically reactive phospholipids. Genetic deletion of PON1 activity in mice creates animals that are susceptible to organophosphate intoxication and, importantly, demonstrate an increased propensity to form atherosclerotic lesions when placed on a high fat diet or an apoE knock-out background (7Shih D.M., Gu, L.

If PON1 attacks the phosphodiester of biologically active phosphatidylcholines then it would inactivate 1-O-hexadecyl-2-O-methyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, a PAF analog that is not a substrate for the esterolytic activity of phospholipases A1 or A2. It did not. Instead we find that purified human PON1 inactivated PAF, as reported (32Rodrigo L. Mackness B. Durrington P.N. Hernandez A. Mackness M.I. Biochem.

This is the same type of activity displayed by the PAF acetylhydrolase that is also a component of certain HDL particles (31Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Carter M.E. Prescott S.M. J. Biol.

The second extracellular loop and amino-terminal domain of CCR5 are critical for chemokine binding, whereas the transmembrane helix bundle is involved in receptor activation. Chemokine domains and residues important for CCR5 binding and/or activation have also been identified. However, the precise way by which chemokines interact with and activate CCR5 is presently unknown. In this study, we have compared the binding and functional properties of chemokine variants onto wild-type CCR5 and CCR5 point mutants. Several mutations in CCR5 extracellular domains (E172A, R168A, K191A, and D276A) strongly affected MIP-1α binding but had little effect on RANTES binding. However, a MIP/RANTES chimera, containing the MIP-1α N terminus and the RANTES core, bound to these mutants with an affinity similar to that of RANTES. Several CCR5 mutants affecting transmembrane helices 2 and 3 (L104F, L104F/F109H/F112Y, F85L/L104F) reduced the potency of MIP-1α by 10–100 fold with little effect on activation by RANTES. However, the MIP/RANTES chimera activated these mutants with a potency similar to that of MIP-1α. In contrast, LD78β, a natural MIP-1α variant, which, like RANTES, contains a proline at position 2, activated these mutants as well as RANTES. Altogether, these results suggest that the core domains of MIP-1α and RANTES bind distinct residues in CCR5 extracellular domains, whereas the N terminus of chemokines mediates receptor activation by interacting with the transmembrane helix bundle.

Chemokines are a family of small proteins (8–12 kDa) that play a crucial role in the development of immune response by organizing the recruitment and the trafficking of immune cell populations throughout the body, under both physiological and pathological conditions (1Rossi D.

CCR5 is also the principal coreceptor of human immunodeficiency viruses that, in concert with CD4, mediates the binding of the viral envelope protein to the cell surface, allowing subsequent entry into target cells (7Berger E.A. Murphy P.M. Farber J.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 657-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar). The key role played by CCR5 in human immunodeficiency virus pathogenesis has been demonstrated by the almost complete resistance to human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection of individuals homozygous for a 32-base pair deletion in the coding sequence of the receptor, which results in the absence of functional coreceptor at the cell surface (8Samson M. Libert F. Doranz B.J. Rucker J. Liesnard C. Farber C.M. Saragosti S. Lapoumeroulie C. Cognaux J. Forceille C. Muyldermans G. Verhofstede C. Burtonboy G. Georges M. Imai T. Rana S. Yi Y. Smyth R.J.

The absence of pathological phenotype in individuals lacking functional CCR5, together with the potent human immunodeficiency virus-suppressive activity of CCR5 antagonists, makes this receptor an attractive candidate for pharmacological intervention (10Moore J.P. Stevenson M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 40-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Moreover, CCR5 appears to be involved in a much broader range of human immune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and renal allograft rejection, suggesting that blocking CCR5 function might be beneficial in these diseases as well (11Gerard C. Rollins B.J. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 108-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar, 12Fischereder M. Luckow B. Hocher B. Wuthrich R.P. Rothenpieler U. Schneeberger H. Panzer U. Stahl R.A.

For these reasons, understanding at the molecular level how CCR5 interacts with chemokines and gp120 and how CCR5 activates G protein signaling as a consequence of chemokine binding might help in the rational design of CCR5 blocking agents.Chemokines share a similar monomeric fold, characterized by a disordered amino-terminal domain, followed by a conserved core region, consisting of the so called “N-loop,” three anti-parallel β-strands, and a carboxyl-terminal α-helix (13Clark-Lewis I. Kim K.S. Rajarathnam K. Gong J.H. Dewald B. Moser B. Baggiolini M. Sykes B.D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The currently prevailing model for chemokine-chemokine receptor interaction postulates a two-step mechanism, in which the core of the chemokine interacts first with a binding site formed by the extracellular domains of the receptor, while another interaction is required between the chemokine N terminus and a second binding site on the receptor in order to trigger receptor activation. Such a two-step model is analogous to the interaction of C5a, a chemoattractant protein with a size similar to that of chemokines, with its cognate G protein-coupled receptor (14Siciliano S.J. Rollins T.E. DeMartino J. Konteatis Z. Malkowitz L. Van Riper G. Bondy S. Rosen H. Springer M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1214-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In agreement with this model, amino-terminal truncations of various CC-chemokines, including CCR5 ligands such as MIP-1α and RANTES, result in a profound reduction of their biological activity, although they retain most of their binding capability (13Clark-Lewis I.

On the other hand, we and others have recently identified various residues located in the core domain of CC-chemokines that contribute to their high affinity binding to receptors (17Laurence J.S.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13548-13555Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). There is, however, no direct experimental demonstration that the N-terminal and core domains of chemokines interact with structurally and functionally independent sites on their cognate receptors.In this study, we have determined the binding and functional properties of chemokines and chemokine variants onto CCR5 point mutants. We have found that several residues in CCR5 extracellular domains are able to discriminate between the core region of MIP-1α and RANTES. We have also identified several residues in CCR5 transmembrane helices 2 and 3 that are crucial for chemokine-induced receptor activation. Their substitution affects differentially the functional response of MIP-1α and RANTES, and we show that the N-terminal domain of chemokines is involved in this specificity.DISCUSSIONA number of studies have identified residues in chemokines or chemokine receptors that are important for binding and receptor activation, although the precise molecular mechanisms by which chemokines interact with their receptors are largely unknown. By using chimeras between CCR5 and its closest homologue, CCR2b, we have previously identified the second extracellular loop (ECL2) of CCR5 as the main determinant of ligand selectivity (23Samson M. LaRosa G. Libert F. Paindavoine P. Detheux M. Vassart G. Parmentier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24934-24941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The importance of the CCR5 amino-terminal domain for chemokine binding was also demonstrated, in particular structural determinants consisting of negatively charged and aromatic residues (34Blanpain C. Doranz B.J. Vakili J. Rucker J. Govaerts C. Baik S.S. Lorthioir O. Migeotte I. Libert F. Baleux F. Vassart G. Doms R.W. Parmentier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34719-34727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A number of tyrosines in the amino-terminal domain of CCR5 are sulfated, and this post-translational modification has been proposed to provide a larger, potentially more flexible and negatively charged surface for ligand binding (35Farzan M.

Some CCR5 mutations, including in extracellular domains, affect the pharmacological profile of the receptor, with a loss of functional response to specific chemokines but not others. This observation suggests that different chemokines interact with different residues within the extracellular domains of a given receptor (30Blanpain C. Lee B. Tackoen M. Puffer B. Boom A. Libert F. Sharron M. Wittamer V. Vassart G. Doms R.W. Parmentier M. Blood. 2000; 96: 1638-1645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such mutants are particularly interesting because they may help to test hypotheses concerning the precise way chemokines bind and activate their receptors. In this study, we have used CCR5 mutants that discriminate between MIP-1α and RANTES, to determine which chemokine domains interact with specific CCR5 sites and the role of these interactions in determining binding affinity and receptor activation.The Globular Core of the Chemokine Interacts with the Extracellular Domain of CCR5Using different chemokines as tracers, we found that a number of CCR5 mutants, in which charged residues in extracellular domains were substituted for alanine, continued to bind RANTES with high affinity, but not MIP-1α. These mutations were largely located in ECL2. We determined, by using a chimeric chemokine (MIP/RANTES) containing the amino-terminal domain of MIP-1α and the RANTES core, which chemokine region was responsible for this specific binding deficit. MIP/RANTES bound and activated most receptor mutants (R168A, K191A, and D276A) with affinities and potencies similar to RANTES. These results strongly suggest that important determinants involved in the differential binding of MIP-1α and RANTES are located in CCR5 ECL2 and that these determinants interact with the core domain of these chemokines. The affinity of MIP/RANTES for E172A was reduced as compared with RANTES, although much less severely than that of MIP-1α. This might be the consequence of a conformational change of this mutant receptor, as suggested by the lower fluorescence-activated cell sorting signal obtained with several conformation-sensitive mAbs (26Lee B. Sharron M. Blanpain C. Doranz B.J. Vakili J. Setoh P. Berg E. Liu G. Guy H.R. Durell S.R. Parmentier M. Chang C.N. Price K. Tsang M. Doms R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9617-9626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that this region of ECL2 might interact both with the chemokine core and with the amino-terminal domain.We and others have identified in different CCR5 ligands conserved or chemokine-specific residues that are important for receptor binding. A conserved aromatic residue located in the N-loop of MIP-1β (Phe13) plays a critical role in CCR5 binding (17Laurence J.S. Blanpain C. Burgner J.W. Parmentier M. LiWang P.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3401-3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The same residue is also important for the binding of other CC-chemokines, including RANTES, to their respective receptors (15Jarnagin K. Grunberger D. Mulkins M. Wong B. Hemmerich S. Paavola C.

Conserved basic residues located in the N-loop (Arg18, Lys19), 310-helix (Arg22), and 40s loop (Arg46–Lys48) of MIP-1β also contribute to CCR5 binding (18Laurence J.S. Blanpain C. De Leener A. Parmentier M. LiWang P.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4990-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 22Bondue A. Shu-Chuan J. Blanpain C. Parmentier M. LiWang P.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13548-13555Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and homologous residues of MCP-1 and eotaxin play a similar role for CCR2b and CCR3 binding, respectively (20Hemmerich S. Paavola C. Bloom A. Bhakta S. Freedman R. Grunberger D. Krstenansky J. Lee S. McCarley D. Mulkins M. Wong B. Pease J. Mizoue L. Mirzadegan T. Polsky I. Thompson K. Handel T.M. Jarnagin K.

This suggests that a common binding surface of CC-chemokines to their receptors involves patches of basic residues separated by an hydrophobic groove. With the exception of Lys33, single substitutions of basic residues in RANTES do not result in a significant decrease of affinity for CCR5, although combinations of these mutations result in a progressive reduction of binding affinity (19Martin L. Blanpain C. Garnier P. Wittamer V. Parmentier M. Vita C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6303-6318Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). 2C. Blanpain, B. J. Doranz, A. Bondue, C. Govaerts, A. De Leener, G. Vassart, R. W. Doms, A. Proudfoot, and M. Parmentier, unpublished results. The functional response of CCR5 to these chemokine mutants correlates well with their binding affinity, suggesting that these residues are involved in binding but not directly in the activation process (18Laurence J.S. Blanpain C. De Leener A. Parmentier M. LiWang P.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4990-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 19Martin L. Blanpain C. Garnier P. Wittamer V. Parmentier M. Vita C.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13548-13555Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).Motifs of acidic and hydrophobic residues located in the amino-terminal domain of chemokine receptors represent a common binding motif for chemokines (20Hemmerich S. Paavola C. Bloom A. Bhakta S. Freedman R. Grunberger D. Krstenansky J. Lee S. McCarley D. Mulkins M. Wong B. Pease J. Mizoue L. Mirzadegan T. Polsky I. Thompson K. Handel T.M. Jarnagin K.

It is therefore tempting to speculate that the conserved binding sites identified in chemokines and in chemokine receptors interact with one another. This common interaction surface might account for the promiscuous character of CC-chemokine binding to their receptors. In addition to this conserved binding site in the N-terminal domain, CCR5-specific residues, in particular those in ECL2, are involved in the selective binding of a chemokine subset. As discussed above, the MIP-1α residues involved in ECL2 binding are expected to be charged amino acids located in the core domain of the protein. Although these residues are presently unknown, the alignment of MIP-1α and RANTES sequences (Fig. 1 B) shows that MIP-1α is much more acidic than RANTES. It exhibits several clusters of acidic residues, especially in the 30s and 50s loops and in the carboxyl-terminal α-helix, but also a cluster of basic residues in the 40s loop. Identifying which of these residues interacts with charged amino acids of CCR5 extracellular domain will require further investigation.The Amino Terminus of the Chemokine Interacts with the TM Domain of CCR5Activation of G protein-coupled receptors is thought to involve conformational changes within transmembrane helices, which are either induced or stabilized upon agonist binding and which allow the receptor to trigger signaling through G proteins (39Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). We have recently identified a key motif (TXP) in CCR5 transmembrane helix 2 that plays a major role in chemokine-induced receptor activation (32Govaerts C. Blanpain C. Deupi X. Ballet S. Ballesteros J.A. Wodak S.J. Vassart G. Pardo L. Parmentier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13217-13225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We found that mutations of this TXP motif induce a profound alteration of CCR5 activation, although this functional defect was strongly chemokine-selective. RANTES responses were the least affected, whereas MCP-2 effects were highly dependent on the integrity of this motif. Molecular dynamics simulations predicted that the Pro residue of this structural determinant would orient the extracellular part of TM2 toward TM3, and not toward TM1 as seen in the structure of rhodopsin, suggesting a direct interaction between TM2 and TM3 at this level. To analyze further the residues involved in the activation switch of CCR5, we studied the role of a cluster of aromatic residues located at close proximity of the TXP motif in TM helices 2 and 3. The substitution of these aromatic residues in CCR5 by their CCR2b counterparts resulted, for some of the mutants, in a profound alteration of their ability to functionally respond to chemokines, while retaining their ability to bind them with high affinity. As for TXP mutants, the functional alteration induced by mutations of aromatic residues was chemokine-selective, some mutants presenting a clear difference in their respective response to MIP-1α or RANTES (33Govaerts C. Bondue A. Springael J.Y. Olivella M. Deupi X. Le Poul E. Wodak S.J. Parmentier M. Pardo L. Blanpain C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1892-1903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Because the amino-terminal domain of chemokines is known to be important for receptor activation, it is tempting to hypothesize that this part of the ligand interacts with a CCR5 domain involved in receptor activation. This hypothesis was tested by measuring the biological activity of chemokines, differing in their amino-terminal domain, onto these CCR5 mutants. The binding and functional properties of amino-terminally truncated chemokines were not affected by mutations of the aromatic cluster of CCR5. In contrast to what was found for extracellular mutants, the chimeric chemokine MIP/RANTES displayed a biological activity similar to that of MIP-1α on CCR5 aromatic cluster mutants, while retaining a normal binding affinity. LD78β activated these mutants as well as RANTES, which can probably be attributed to the presence of a Pro residue in position 2 (5Nibbs R.J. Yang J. Landau N.R. Mao J.H. Graham G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17478-17483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), as found in RANTES. These results strongly argue for an interaction between the chemokine N terminus and a site in the helix bundle of the receptor, necessary for triggering the activation process.The most widely accepted model for G protein-coupled receptor activation is the ternary complex model (39Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). According to this model, the receptor exists in a equilibrium between an inactive conformation (R) and an active conformation (R*). Agonists are predicted to bind with high affinity to the R* conformation, and due to the mass action law, to increase the proportion of R*. It is somewhat surprising that the mutation of residues expected to interact with the N-terminal domain of chemokines does not result in a significant decrease in the measured binding affinity. It is therefore likely that the interaction responsible for receptor activation does not contribute much to the overall stability of the chemokine-receptor complex, in which the contacts between the core of the chemokine and the extracellular domains of the receptor play the major role. Mutations strongly impairing activation without significantly affecting ligand binding have been described for other G protein-coupled receptors, including the C5a receptor (40Gerber B.O. Meng E.C. Dotsch V. Baranski T.J. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3394-3400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and the thyrotropin receptor (41Govaerts C. Lefort A. Costagliola S. Wodak S.J. Ballesteros J.A. Van Sande J. Pardo L. Vassart G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22991-22999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).Several structural differences between the amino-terminal domain of the various chemokines might account for the differences in their ability to activate receptors mutated in the aromatic cluster. The N terminus of RANTES is shorter (9 residues) than that of other CCR5 ligands (10 residues). RANTES, like LD78β and MIP-1β, have a Pro in position 2, whereas MIP-1α has a Ser. This Pro residue certainly plays an important role in chemokine function, since the P2A substitution significantly decreases the biological activity of RANTES (38Pakianathan D.R. Kuta E.G. Artis D.R. Skelton N.J. Hebert C.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9642-9648Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This role is, however, highly context-dependent, since cleavage of RANTES by the CD26 peptidase, removing the Pro and generating RANTES-(3–68), does not affect its activity (42Struyf S.DeM.I Scharpe S. Lenaerts J.P. Menten P. Wang J.M. Proost P. Van Damme J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 1262-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Mutational analyses of different chemokines has shown that high sequence variability in the N-terminal domain is well tolerated for normal function, suggesting that interactions between this domain and the receptor might involve primarily backbone atoms (13Clark-Lewis I.

The core domain of chemokines mediates high affinity receptor binding through interactions with various residues located in CCR5 extracellular domains, whereas their amino-terminal domain interacts with TM residues and mediates receptor activation. Further studies will be needed to understand more precisely the molecular details of this process. Chemokines are a family of small proteins (8–12 kDa) that play a crucial role in the development of immune response by organizing the recruitment and the trafficking of immune cell populations throughout the b"

To investigate the role(s) of the titin M-line segment, we have conditionally deleted the exons MEx1 and MEx2 (encoding the kinase domain plus flanking sequences) at different stages of embryonic development. Our data demonstrate an important role for MEx1 and MEx2 in early cardiac development (embryonic lethality) as well as postnatally when disruption of M-line titin leads to muscle weakness and death at ∼5 weeks of age. Myopathic changes include pale M-lines devoid of MURF-1, and gradual sarcomeric disassembly.

Titin is the third myofilament of vertebrate striated muscles and spans the half-sarcomere by integrating into the Z-disc and M-line through its amino and carboxyl terminus, respectively (1Gregorio C.C.

Close to its carboxyl-terminal M-line region, titin contains a kinase domain that shares homology with the catalytic serine/threonine kinase domain of smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), 1The abbreviations used are: MLCK, myosin light chain kinase; MURF, muscle-specific ring finger; MHC, myosin heavy chain; ES, embryonic stem; FRT, flp recombinase target; KO, knockout; MCK, muscle creatine kinase; CARP, cardiac ankyrin repeat protein; ankrd, ankyrin repeat domain and the invertebrate muscle proteins twitchin, projectin, and stretchin-MLCK and Ce titin (9Ayme-Southgate A.

Gernert K. Shmeleva N. Tang X. Mercer K. Borodovsky M. Benian G. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 533Google Scholar). Although a variety of different functions have been hypothesized for the titin kinase domain, its physiological substrate(s) remain unknown. Based on its crystal structure, Mayanset al. proposed that the titin kinase is under strong autoinhibitory control with a dual activation mechanism that controls kinase activity (15Mayans O. van der Ven P.F. Wilm M. Mues A. Young P. Fnrst D.O. Wilmanns M. Gautel M. Nature. 1998; 395: 863-869Google Scholar). In vitro phosphorylation experiments using a constitutively active kinase fragment suggested that the titin kinase domain phosphorylates the sarcomeric protein telethonin/T-cap, a Z-line-associated protein. More recently, Centner et al.searched for proteins that specifically interact with the titin kinase region to identify potential titin kinase substrate or regulator molecules (16Centner T. Yano J. Kimura E. McElhinny A.S. Pelin K. Witt C.C. Bang M.L. Trombitas K. Granzier H. Gregorio C.C. Sorimachi H. Labeit S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 717-726Google Scholar). This demonstrated that the novel RING finger protein MURF-1 binds to the A168/A169 Fn3/Ig repeats of titin, which locate amino-terminal to the titin kinase domain at the periphery of the M-line lattice. MURF-1 together with its close homologues MURF-2 and MURF-3 form a distinct subgroup of the known RING finger proteins that has been implicated in the control of muscle degeneration, microtubule stabilization, M-line function, and transcriptional regulation (17Spencer J.A. Eliazer S. Ilaria R.L.J. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 771-784Google Scholar,18McElhinny A.S. Kakinuma K. Sorimachi H. Labeit S. Gregorio C.C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 125-136Google Scholar). Within the MURF family, only MURF-1 interacts with the A168/A169 Fn3/Ig repeats of titin, and it has been suggested that MURF-1 may participate in the regulation of titin kinase activity (16Centner T. Yano J. Kimura E. McElhinny A.S. Pelin K. Witt C.C. Bang M.L. Trombitas K. Granzier H. Gregorio C.C. Sorimachi H. Labeit S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 717-726Google Scholar). Recently, titin has been identified as the gene mutated in an autosomal dominant form of dilated cardiomyopathy (19Siu B.L. Niimura H. Osborne J.A. Fatkin D. MacRae C. Solomon S. Benson D.W. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. Circulation. 1999; 99: 1022-1026Google Scholar, 20Gerull B. Gramlich M. Atherton J. McNabb M. Trombitas K. Sasse-Klaassen S. Seidman J.G. Seidman C. Granzier H. Labeit S. Frenneaux M. Thierfelder L. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 201-204Google Scholar). The mutation results in a truncated titin, and patients that express the truncated protein suffer from heart failure of variable age of onset in the absence of clinically detectable skeletal muscle disease. In contrast, mutations within the carboxyl-terminal region of titin cause the distal type skeletal muscular dystrophy TMD without affecting the heart (21Hackman P. Vihola A. Aravuori H. Archand S. Arpanta J. Eze J. Labeit S. Witt C.C. Peltonen L. Richard I. Udd B. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). Because these mutations occur in a constitutively expressed region of titin it is unclear why some of these mutations cause a disease specific to the heart muscle, whereas other mutations cause a skeletal-muscle-specific myopathy. To investigate the physiological function(s) of the titin kinase domain, we have used a conditional knockout approach to selectively delete the M-line exons MEx1 (which encodes the kinase domain) and MEx2 (to maintain the reading frame) in heart and skeletal muscle. When exons MEx1/MEx2 are excised early in embryonic development (using the α-MHC promoter) mice die in utero. In contrast, excision during late embryonic development (using the MCK promoter) allows the mice to survive but causes development of a progressive myopathy, resulting in death at 5 weeks of age. Ultrastructural analysis indicates that sarcomeres incorporate the mutant titins but subsequently disassemble. Gene expression profiling data suggest that a family of molecules involved in myocyte signaling become dysregulated after deletion of MEx1/MEx2, including members of the ankyrin repeat family. This raises the possibility that MEx1/MEx2 are involved in myofibrillar signaling and in maintaining the structural integrity of the contracting sarcomere. A targeting construct was assembled by standard procedures from a mouse genomic BAC clone (bacterial artificial chromosome library MGS1 from mouse ES cells; Genome Systems/Incyte Genomics) spanning the 3′ region of the mouse titin gene (Fig. 1 a). To preserve the open reading frame we flanked exon MEx1, which contains the kinase domain, and the neighboring downstream exon MEx2 with loxP sites. Briefly, a PCR-based strategy was used to introduce a neomycin expression cassette flanked by loxP- and FRT-sites into the intron 3′ of exon MEx2 (for nomenclature of M-line titin exons see Ref. 22Kolmerer B. Olivieri N. Witt C.C. Herrmann B.G. Labeit S. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 556-563Google Scholar). An additional loxP site was placed in the intron 5′ of MEx1. The targeting vector was verified by sequencing. Homologous recombination with this targeting vector occurred in 10% of all G418-resistant ES cell colonies. ∼30% of the clones also contained the loxP site 5′ to MEx1. These clones were used to derive chimeric animals as described previously (23Willnow T.E. Herz J. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 305-334Google Scholar). The intronic neomycin cassette has the potential to affect the phenotype of knockout animals (24Kaul A. Koster M. Neuhaus H. Braun T. Cell. 2000; 102: 17-19Google Scholar). Therefore, we mated heterozygous animals that contained the altered titin locus to transgenic mice that expressed the Flp recombinase in their germline (25Dymecki S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6191-6196Google Scholar). Offspring from this mating in which the neomycin cassette had been removed by Flp-mediated excision was used to generate a colony of homozygous mice that only contained the loxP sequences in the two introns flanking MEx1 and MEx2 and one residual FRT site in the 3′ intron (Fig. 1 a). Genomic DNA from embryonic and postnatal mouse tails or yolk sacs was genotyped as described (Fig. 1 and Refs. 26Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar, 27Herz J. Gotthardt M. Willnow T.E. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 161-166Google Scholar). Primers were designed to detect homologous recombination, presence of the 5′ loxP site, and Flp- and Cre-mediated recombination (Fig. 1 a). For Southern genotyping, genomic DNA was digested with HindIII and probed with a SmaI fragment 3′ of Exon MEx2 (Fig. 1, aand b) according to standard procedures (26Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Timed matings and harvesting of embryos were performed as follows: female mice were superovulated using 10 IU intraperitoneal pregnant mare's serum (Sigma), followed 48 h later by 10 IU intraperitoneal human chorionic gonadotropin (Sigma) and mating to corresponding males. The morning of detection of a vaginal plug was regarded as day 0.5 postconception. Embryos and resorbtion bodies were harvested at E15.

All animal experiments were carried out under protocols approved by the University of Texas Southwestern Institutional Review Committee for animal use and followed the National Institutes of Health guidelines, “Using Animals in Intramural Research.” Cryosections (25 μm) of 3%-paraformaldehyde-fixed tissue were stained with X-gal and counterstained with eosin using the “Stain for β-Galactosidase Expression” (Speciality Media (www.specialitymedia.com)) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Templates to generate in situ hybridization probes were amplified from genomic DNA and included the kinase region (kin) and the exon MEx5 3′ of the kinase domain, respectively. PCR fragments were subcloned using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen), sequenced, linearized with HindIII (kin) or BamHI (MEx5), and transcribed with T7 polymerase using the Ambion in vitro transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Embryos and adult hearts were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 5-μm paraffin sections were used for in situ hybridization as described previously (31Gotthardt M. Trommsdorff M. Nevitt M.F. Shelton J.

Cells and tissues designated for protein preparation were snap-frozen, pulverized, and quickly solubilized with 9 volumes of hot 1.1× solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 80 mmdithiothreitol, 30 μg/ml pyronin Y, pH 6.8 at 25 °C) (34Granzier H.L.

To allow conditional tissue-specific excision of the titin kinase region we have used homologous recombination in ES cells to introduce loxP and FRT recombination sites into introns flanking the kinase (Fig. 1 a). To maintain an uninterrupted open reading frame, exon MEx1, which encodes the kinase domain, and the neighboring downstream exon MEx2 were both designated to be deleted. Introduction of loxP sites into the gene did not interfere with normal mRNA transcription and had no discernable phenotypic effect in mice that were homozygous for the floxed allele. The targeting frequency was 1:10 with one-third of the targeting events including the lox site 3′ of MEx1 (data not shown). Chimeric mice derived from targeted ES cells were mated to Flp transgenic mice to remove the intronic neomycin expression cassette and to avoid any potential adverse physiological effects (24Kaul A. Koster M. Neuhaus H. Braun T. Cell. 2000; 102: 17-19Google Scholar). Offspring in which the neomycin cassette had been deleted was used to derive a colony of homozygous mice (RECf+/+) that only contained the loxP sequences in the two introns flanking MEx1 and MEx2 and one residual FRT site in the 3′ intron (Fig. 1 a). These animals showed no morphological or functional abnormalities and were indistinguishable from genetically similar wild type controls. Genotyping and PCR analysis of Cre/loxP and Flp/FRT recombination was performed as shown in Fig. 1,b–e. Both recombination with the FLP recombinase (Fig.1 d) as well as with the Cre recombinase (Fig. 1 e) worked well. The efficiency of recombination in the germline through the Flp/FRT recombination has been reported to be incomplete (25Dymecki S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6191-6196Google Scholar). In our animals ∼40% of male germ cells were recombined as judged from germline transmission, i.e. 40% of all transmitted floxed titin alleles were recombined. Additionally, the integration of the lox site does not interfere with titin gene function since heterozygous matings lead to offspring at the expected Mendelian ratios (wild-type:heterozygote:knockout = 14:30:16 and Fig.1 c). Both heterozygous and homozygous animals with and without the neomycin cassette were phenotypically normal. To remove the titin kinase domain from striated muscle, we obtained Cre transgenic animals that direct recombination to heart and skeletal muscle (29Agah R. Frenkel P.A. French B.A. Michael L.H. Overbeek P.A. Schneider M.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 169-179Google Scholar, 30Bruning J.C. Michael M.D. Winnay J.N. Hayashi T. Horsch D. Accili D. Goodyear L.J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 559-569Google Scholar). Expression of the Cre recombinase under control of the α-myosin heavy chain promoter (MHCcre) resulted in recombination of the ROSA26-lacZ reporter construct in heart and large arteries of the lung (Fig. 2, a–e). Cre expression under control of the muscle creatine kinase promoter (MCKcre) caused recombination in all striated muscle including the heart and in smooth muscle cells in large arteries (Fig. 2,f–j). The more uniform staining in MHCcre-versus MCKcre-expressing hearts (Fig. 2, a andf) reflects higher efficiency of recombination. Deletion of the kinase domain from cardiac titin during development (by the MHCcre transgene) led to early embryonic lethality. Resorbtion bodies from knockout animals were isolated at embryonic day 15 (Fig. 3 a). No homozygous offspring was obtained, indicating a critical role for titin in heart development. In contrast to the MHCcre animals expressing the Cre recombinase from the early stages during development, the skeletal muscle-specific MCKcre transgene allowed generation of live-born mice that expressed the recombinase and that were homozygous for the floxed allele at the expected Mendelian ratios (data not shown). These animals, in which deletion of the titin kinase domain in skeletal muscle was virtually quantitative (see below), developed a severe syndrome characterized by progressive muscle weakness, which affected their posture and gait and caused ptosis of the eyelids (movie available at titin.mdc-berlin.de/titinmovie.html; Fig. 3 b). Failure to thrive was usually apparent at 3 weeks of age, with progression of the phenotype until death at ∼5 weeks of age (Fig. 3 d). During autopsies, the heart of titin kinase-deficient animals appeared small but in proportion when compared with body size (results not shown). Light microscopy did not show evidence for necrosis or myositis (Fig.4 a). To verify that this phenotype was due to the selective loss of the targeted titin M-line segment and not caused by aberrant splicing of the transcript, which might introduce additional defects in the carboxyl-terminal end of the molecule, we confirmed by in situ hybridization that exons 3′ of the deleted kinase region were transcribed at normal levels (Fig. 4 b). Furthermore, reverse transcribed-PCR across the new splice junction confirmed removal of MEx1/MEx2 and maintenance of the open reading frame when joining A170 to MEx3 (data not shown). In situ hybridization demonstrated that by 4 weeks of age, wild-type titin message was found in only a few isolated fibers (Fig. 4 b, panel F), whereas mutant titin protein had almost completely replaced full-length titin in heart muscle (Fig. 5, b andc). Western blots with MEx1- and MEx3/MEx4-specific antibodies and quantification by densitometry demonstrated that >80% of the expressed titin was deficient in its kinase region. The presence of the carboxyl terminus in the recombined titin protein was confirmed by Western blotting with antibodies directed against the kinase domain or against epitopes located at the amino- and carboxyl terminus of titin (Fig. 5, a and d). Electron microscopy of RECf+/+ control animals revealed normal sarcomeres with well resolved M-line bridges (see arrow in Fig.6 a, panel A). Myocytes of 4-week-old KO animals (MCKcre RECf+/+) contained regions with sarcomeres with relatively normal structure (>50% of the area of the cells) as well as irregular regions with sarcomeres in various stages of disarray. Sarcomeres of KO animals had typically widened and pale M-lines that were devoid of M-line bridges (arrows in Fig. 6 a, panels B and C). When sarcomeres were labeled with anti-M7-M9 (MEx3/MEx4) M-line epitopes were obtained that were ∼100 nm apart in control animals (Fig.6 b, panel A), but in the KO animals this distance had significantly increased (Fig. 6 b, panel B, and 6 c). Interestingly, the epitope separation appeared to correlate with the degree of disassembly of the sarcomere (see Fig.6 c, myofibril with ends labeled with arrows). We also used an antibody against MURF-1 and found M-line labeling in control animals (Fig. 6 d, panel A) but absence of M-line labeling in KO animals (Fig. 6 d, panel B). Because in vitro studies have shown that MURF-1 binds to the A169/A170 domains that are encoded by MEx1 (16Centner T. Yano J. Kimura E. McElhinny A.S. Pelin K. Witt C.C. Bang M.L. Trombitas K. Granzier H. Gregorio C.C. Sorimachi H. Labeit S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 717-726Google Scholar), absence of MURF-1 supports the notion that MEx1 has been excised from sarcomeres in KO animals, whereas labeling with M7-M9 indicates that the titin carboxyl terminus is present. Impaired titin function most likely cannot be substituted by another gene, since no other gene coding for a protein of similar size and complexity is known. Therefore, we expected that mice after conventional gene targeting of the titin locus would die during early embryonic development, precluding studies of the role of titin in muscle. Accordingly we introduced an intragenic deletion in a specific region of titin using a conditional gene-targeting strategy. We anticipated that the deletion of the MEx1 exon might provide insights into structural and regulatory roles of titin because MEx1 codes for the 200-kDa M-line portion of titin, which is highly conserved between species and contains a serine/threonine kinase domain and a binding site for the RING finger protein MURF-1. We addressed the biological roles of the titin kinase in the heart and in skeletal muscle at different stages of embryonic and postnatal development by using transgenic animals that express Cre recombinase under control of the well characterized muscle-specific promoters α-MHC and MCK. These transgenic animals used to derive the MEx1–2 knockouts have been described by others (29Agah R. Frenkel P.A. French B.A. Michael L.H. Overbeek P.A. Schneider M.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 169-179Google Scholar, 30Bruning J.C. Michael M.D. Winnay J.N. Hayashi T. Horsch D. Accili D. Goodyear L.J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 559-569Google Scholar) but have not been compared side by side. We confirmed their tissue distribution (Fig. 2) with more generalized muscular expression of the MCK promoter. In rat, expression of MCK begins at embryonic day 17, rises to 40% of maximum activity by birth, and plateaus at day 10 of life (37Trask R.V. Billadello J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1049: 182-188Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the delayed activity of the MCKcre system may allow homozygous mice to survive through early postnatal stages, whereas Cre expression driven by the α-MHC promoter may lead to early developmental recombination with potential embryonic and perinatal effects (38Minamino T. Gaussin V. DeMayo F.J. Schneider M.D. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 587-592Google Scholar). These expectations were supported by the stronger β-galactosidase staining in α-MHCcre hearts versus hearts from MCKcre animals (Fig. 2, a and f) and by the early embryonic lethality of the α-MHCcre RECf+/+ mice. The expected mutant titin transcripts were detected by reverse transcribed-PCR in which the exons 357 (coding for A167/A168 located in the periphery of the M-line) and exon 360 (MEx3 coding for M8) were joined in-frame. Thus, at the protein level a 214-kDa segment coding for most of the M-line portion of titin was deleted, including the binding site for the RING finger protein MURF-1 and the serine-threonine kinase domain of titin. Consistent with this, when analyzing the myofibrillar proteins on low percentage protein gels, titin from the mutant mice showed an increased mobility on SDS gels. The levels of myofibrillar titin in the mutant and wild-type mice were comparable (Fig. 5 b). Therefore, the mutant titin transcribed from the exon 358/359-deficient gene locus is correctly spliced, translated, and incorporated into myofibrils. The strategy applied here for the removal of the titin exons 358/359 is applicable for the deletion of other regions of interest in titin, while keeping the remainder of this giant molecule intact. The most obvious phenotype of our mice is their progressive muscle wasting, leading to a pronounced weakness, apparent for example by ptosis of both eyes (Fig. 3 b), inability to climb, and progressively impaired gait (compare at titin.mdc-berlin.de/titinmovie.html). Muscle weakness is evident at 2–3 weeks of age, before the mutant mice become dystrophic at around 4 weeks of age. This suggests that the muscle weakness it not a secondary effect of e.g. reduced cardiac output. The sarcomeres containing mutant titin appeared to be unstable (Fig.6). Within the same region of the myocyte, sarcomeric structure varied from relatively normal sarcomeres with pale M-lines devoid of M-bridges (Fig. 6 b, panel B) to nearly fully disassembled sarcomeres (Fig. 6 c, left). Interestingly, the C-terminal M7-M9 antibody labels two epitopes in the center of the A-band, separated by ∼100 nm in the control but up to ∼200 nm in the KO animals (Fig. 6 c). The separation in control sarcomeres is consistent with a model in which titins from opposite half-sarcomeres overlap by ∼100 mm within M-lines (39Obermann W.M. Gautel M. Steiner F. van der Ven P.F. Weber K. Furst D.O. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1441-1453Google Scholar). The reduced size of mutant titin (∼200 kDa) suggests that titin molecules do not overlap, but instead stop short of the center of the A-band. Absence of titin from the center of the A-band, a region of the sarcomere under high systolic stress, is likely to compromise the mechanical strength of the sarcomere, and this may contribute to sarcomeric disassembly. Our mouse model will allow future studies on the physiological role(s) of the titin kinase domain and its potentialin vivo substrate(s). Interestingly, the potential candidate substrates for the titin kinase, Tcap/telethonin and MURF-1 (15Mayans O. van der Ven P.F. Wilm M. Mues A. Young P. Fnrst D.O. Wilmanns M. Gautel M. Nature. 1998; 395: 863-869Google Scholar, 16Centner T. Yano J. Kimura E. McElhinny A.S. Pelin K. Witt C.C. Bang M.L. Trombitas K. Granzier H. Gregorio C.C. Sorimachi H. Labeit S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 717-726Google Scholar), were not significantly affected in our animal model as verified both by TaqMan and Western blot analysis (data not shown). In contrast, transcripts for CARP (CARP-1) and its homolog ankrd2 (CARP-2) were both significantly up-regulated, and Western blotting with specific antibodies confirmed elevated CARP/ankrd2 protein levels in the titin kinase-deficient mice (Fig. 5 e). CARP epitopes have been shown to co-localize with N2A titin and myopalladin epitopes during myofibrillar stretch, which suggests that titin, CARP, and myopalladin form an I-band-associated signaling complex (36Bang M.L. Mudry R.E. McElhinny A.S. Trombitas K. Geach A.J. Yamasaki R. Sorimachi H. Granzier H.L. Gregorio C.C. Labeit S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 413-428Google Scholar). ankrd2 (CARP-2) in turn has been shown to increase in expression upon chronic myofibrillar stretch (40Kemp T.J. Sadusky T.J. Saltisi F. Carey N. Moss J. Yang S.Y. Sassoon D.A. Goldspink G. Coulton G.R. Genomics. 2000; 66: 229-241Google Scholar). Our present finding that both CARP and ankrd2 are up-regulated in titin kinase-deficient mice raises the possibility that CARP and titin-dependent signal pathways could be connected. Since titin-based signaling is likely to respond to myofibrillar stretch (8Granzier H. Labeit S. J. Physiol. 2002; 541: 335-342Google Scholar) and CARP-based signaling to modulate NKX2.5-dependent muscle gene expression (41Zou Y. Evans S. Chen J. Kuo H.C. Harvey R.P. Chien K.R. Development. 1997; 124: 793-804Google Scholar), we speculate that the titin-dependent signaling involves CARPs, coordinating myofibribrillar stretch with the regulation of muscle gene expression. In summary, we used a conditional gene targeting strategy as a novel approach toward functional characterization of the titin M-line region (MEx1–2). Excision of MEx1–2 from cardiac titin during development (by the MHCcre transgene) leads to absence of homozygous offspring. This indicates a critical role for MEx1–2 in heart development. This is consistent with the report by Gerull et al. who found patients with heterozygous titin defects, but no homozygous carriers, in pedigrees of familial cardiomyopathy (20Gerull B. Gramlich M. Atherton J. McNabb M. Trombitas K. Sasse-Klaassen S. Seidman J.G. Seidman C. Granzier H. Labeit S. Frenneaux M. Thierfelder L. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 201-204Google Scholar). In addition the titin M-line region is likely to play a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity of the sarcomere and myofibrillar signaling following birth (excision by the MCKcre transgene) when skeletal muscle are load-bearing and the heart is actively pumping blood, continuously stressing the M-line region of the sarcomere. The conditional knockout technology used in this work appears to be well suited for investigating selected regions of the giant titin molecule both during development and in mature muscle tissues. This approach can also be applied to those regions of titin that cause titin-dependent familial myopathies in humans.

https://openalex.org/W1995650456,"β-Catenin is a key mediator of the Wnt pathway, which plays a critical role in embryogenesis and oncogenesis. As a transcriptional activator, β-catenin binds the transcription factors, T-cell factor and lymphoid enhancer factor, and regulates gene expression in response to Wnt signaling. Abnormal activation of β-catenin has been linked to various types of cancer. In a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified the four and a half of LIM-only protein 2 (FHL2) as a novel β-catenin-interacting protein. Here we show specific interaction of FHL2 with β-catenin, which requires the intact structure of FHL2 and armadillo repeats 1–9 of β-catenin. FHL2 cooperated with β-catenin to activate T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor-dependent transcription from a synthetic reporter and the cyclin D1 and interleukin-8 promoters in kidney and colon cell lines. In contrast, coexpression of β-catenin and FHL2 had no synergistic effect on androgen receptor-mediated transcription, whereas each of these two coactivators independently stimulated AR transcriptional activity. Thus, the ability of FHL2 to stimulate the trans-activating function of β-catenin might be dependent on the promoter context. The detection of increased FHL2 expression in hepatoblastoma, a liver tumor harboring frequent β-catenin mutations, suggests that FHL2 might enforce β-catenin transactivation activity in cancer cells. These findings reveal a new function of the LIM coactivator FHL2 in transcriptional activation of Wnt-responsive genes. β-Catenin is a key mediator of the Wnt pathway, which plays a critical role in embryogenesis and oncogenesis.

These findings reveal a new function of the LIM coactivator FHL2 in transcriptional activation of Wnt-responsive genes. β-Catenin is a binding partner of E-cadherin in cell-cell adherens junctions and a key effector in the Wnt signaling pathway, which plays a critical role in development and homeostasis (1Peifer M. Polakis P. Science. 2000; 287: 1606-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar, 2Moon R.T. Brown J.D. Torres M. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 157-162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). β-Catenin is composed of three domains: a regulatory N-terminal region followed by 12 armadillo (arm) 1The abbreviations used are: arm, armadillo; IL, interleukin; FHL2, four and a half of LIM-only protein 2; ACT, activator of CREM in testis; AR, androgen receptor; TCF, T-cell factor; LEF, lymphoid enhancer factor; CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein; CBP, CREB-binding protein; DHT, dihydrotestosterone; His, histidine epitope tag; RT, reverse transcription; MMTV, mouse mammary tumor virus; DBD, DNA-binding domain; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; Luc, luciferase repeats and a C-terminal transactivation domain. The N-terminal region contains serine and threonine residues whose phosphorylation signals ubiquitin-dependent degradation of cytosolic β-catenin. Phosphorylation of β-catenin is controlled by a multiprotein complex composed of tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli, Axin, glycogen synthase kinase-3, and casein kinase Iα. The arm repeats in the core region mediate β-catenin interactions with a majority of partners such as E-cadherin and the transcriptional factors, T-cell factor (TCF) and lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF). Cytosolic accumulation of β-catenin leads to trans-location of the protein into the nucleus where it forms a complex with DNA-binding factors of the TCF/LEF family (3Behrens J. von Kries J.P. Kuhl M. Bruhn L. Wedlich D. Grosschedl R. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 382: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (2605) Google Scholar). This bipartite transcription factor complex recruits multiple transcriptional coactivators and activates TCF/LEF-dependent transcription through the C-terminal trans-activation domain of β-catenin (4Barker N. Morin P.J. Clevers H. Adv. Cancer Res. 2000; 77: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The tight regulation of gene expression by Wnt signaling guarantees a stringent spatiotemporal coordination of downstream gene expression in response to developmental and physiological cues. It has been shown that deregulation of β-catenin, which leads to its nuclear accumulation and activation of gene expression, is implicated in the development of cancer (reviewed in Ref. 5Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among several candidate downstream target genes, β-catenin activates transcription from the promoters of c-myc, cyclin D1, the matrix metalloproteinase-7, neuronal cell adhesion molecule, and interleukin-8 (IL-8), which are frequently overexpressed in human colon carcinoma (6He T.C.

Moreover, β-catenin-interacting proteins, such as the chromatin-remodeling factor Brg-1 and CBP/p300, can be involved in altering chromatin structure to allow access of RNA polymerase II (16Barker N.

Here, we report the identification of four and a half of LIM-only protein 2 (FHL2) as a novel β-catenin-binding protein that possesses intrinsic trans-activation activity. Initially cloned by its abundant expression in human heart and its down-regulated expression in rhabdomyosarcoma cells (17Chan K.K. Tsui S.K. Lee S.M. Luk S.C. Liew C.C. Fung K.P. Waye M.M. Lee C.Y.

The LIM domain is a specialized double zinc finger protein motif, and LIM proteins play multiple roles as adapters and functional modifiers in protein interactions (20Dawid I.B. Breen J.J. Toyama R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 156-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Containing exclusively four and a half of LIM domains, FHL proteins display a high degree of homology between family members and tissue-specific expression (21Fimia G.M. De Cesare D. Sassone-Corsi P.

The activity of FHL2 in transcriptional regulation has been evidenced in recent reports demonstrating that FHL2 is a coactivator of the androgen receptor (AR) and the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) (21Fimia G.M.

A link between FHL2 and β-catenin was first suggested by the findings that both FHL2 and β-catenin interact with AR and are capable of enhancing AR function in androgen-dependent transcription (23Muller J.M.

Although FHL2 alone had no effect on TCF/LEF-dependent transcription, it potentiated the trans-activating activity of β-catenin on the transcription of the Wnt-responsive cyclin D1 and IL-8 promoters. FHL2 and β-catenin independently enhanced AR activity in a hormone-dependent manner, but in this context, the combined action of both proteins had only additive effects. Evidence of up-regulated FHL2 expression in primary tumors suggests that FHL2-activating function on β-catenin may be implicated in oncogenesis by further enhancing the expression of Wnt target genes. cDNA sequences encoding β-catenin arm repeats 1–10 (amino acids 132–554) used as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen as well as fragments encompassing different arm repeats were inserted in-frame with Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) into the pAS2ΔΔ vector (a gift of Dr. P. Legrain). FHL2 full-length cDNA was isolated from a HeLa cDNA library after a two-hybrid screen with the β-catenin bait. FHL2 deletion mutants were constructed by inserting PCR-amplified fragments in-frame with the Gal4 activation domain into pACT2 (Clontech). ACT full-length cDNA cloned into pACT2 was provided by Dr. M. Morgan. pGEX-β-catenin, pGEX-FHL2, and pGEX-FHL2N-term were constructed by inserting full-length β-catenin and FHL2 cDNAs and FHL2 sequences coding for amino acids 1–126 in-frame with glutathioneS-transferase (GST) into pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences). pSGHis-β-catenin and pSGHis-arm1–12 (amino acids 132–702) were constructed by inserting the RGSH6 sequence at the N-terminal end of β-catenin into pSG5 (Stratagene). Expression vectors for full-length FHL2 (pcDNAFHL2), β-catenin (pcDNAβ-cat), and β-catenin T41A (pcDNAβ-catT41A) were used in transient transfection assays. The IL-8 promoter-luciferase construct used in this study contains 193 bp upstream of the transcription start site (193-IL-8-Luc) as described previously (11Levy L. Neuveut C. Renard C.A. Charneau P. Branchereau S. Gauthier F. Van Nhieu J.T. Cherqui D. Petit-Bertron A.F. Mathieu D. Buendia M.A. J. Biol.

The promoter with mutated TCF site at position −186 to −177 (193mt-IL-8-Luc) was used as control (11Levy L. Neuveut C. Renard C.A. Charneau P. Branchereau S. Gauthier F. Van Nhieu J.T. Cherqui D.

Clevers; pA3Luc (cyclin D1 promoter) was provided by Dr. R. Pestell; pMMTV-Luc was provided by Dr. P. Chambon; and pSG5-hAR (human androgen receptor) was provided by Dr. G. Castoria. Standard recombinant DNA techniques including PCR followed by sequencing were used to construct all of the plasmids. The two-hybrid screen was performed using the mating protocol described by Fromont-Racineet al. (27Fromont-Racine M. Rain J. Legrain P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). CG1945 cells transformed with Gal4 DBD-β-catenin-arm1–10 were mixed with Y187 cells transformed with a HeLa MATCHMAKER cDNA library (HL4048AH, Clontech). Transformants were selected by their ability to grow on minimal medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. Positive clones were then confirmed in β-galactosidase overlay assay. Prey plasmids with high β-galactosidase activity were rescued in Escherichia coli, and their sequences were subsequently analyzed. To map interaction domains in β-catenin and FHL2, deletion constructs were cotransformed into the diploid strain CG1945/Y187 and quantitative β-galactosidase assay was performed as described previously (28Transy C. Legrain P. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 21: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled proteins were produced in vitro using TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). The GST-β-catenin and GST-FHL2 fusion proteins were purified from E. coli according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences) and then linked to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Incubation with in vitrotranslated proteins was carried out for 4 h at 4 °C in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Beads were washed with the binding buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with Laemmli buffer at 95 °C and subjected to SDS-PAGE. 293, SW480, CV1 and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfection of 293 cells was carried out by calcium phosphate precipitation with 50 ng of β-catenin T41A, 0.25–1 μg of FHL2, 250 ng of ΔNTcf4, and 0.5 μg of pTOPFLASH or pFOPFLASH or with 250 ng of β-catenin T41A, 0.25–1 μg of FHL2, and 0.5 μg of pCyclinD1-Luc or 0.25 μg of pIL-8-Luc. SW480 cell transfection was performed using calcium phosphate precipitation with 0.25 or 1 μg of FHL2, 250 ng of ΔNTcf4, and 0.5 μg of pTOPFLASH or pFOPFLASH. CV1 cells were cotransfected with 0.5 μg of pMMTV-Luc, 50 ng of pSG5-hAR, 0.5 μg of β-catenin, and 0.25 μg of FHL2 using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen). For AR transcriptional activity assays, CV1 cells were washed 3 h after transfection and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% stripped fetal calf serum in the presence or absence of 10 nm dihydrotestosterone (DHT) (Sigma). The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by adding pcDNA3. Each transfection was performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times. A thymidine kinase-β-galactosidase plasmid was cotransfected to normalize luciferase activity for transfection efficiency. However, because FHL2 was found to activate transcription of this reporter, it could not be used for normalization; the results were confirmed by multiple independent assays. A polyclonal anti-FHL2 antibody was generated by injection of GST-FHL2N-term (amino acids 1–126) into rabbits. Anti-RGSH, anti-β-catenin, and anti-FLAG antibodies were purchased from Qiagen, Transduction Laboratories, and Sigma, respectively. For coimmunoprecipitation assays, HeLa cells were transfected with His-β-catenin or His-arm1–12 using LipofectAMINE. Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture. Cell lysates were incubated with polyclonal anti-FHL2 antibody. Bound proteins were eluted and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-RGSH monoclonal antibodies at 1:1000 dilution. Immunofluorescence staining was carried out as described previously (29Carvalho T. Seeler J.S. Öhman K. Jordan P. Pettersson U. Akusjärvi G. Carmo-Fonseca M. Dejean A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). HeLa cells grown on coverslips were transfected with 2 μg of β-catenin T41A and FLAG-FHL2 with calcium phosphate. 24 h later, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then incubated with monoclonal mouse anti-β-catenin and polyclonal rabbit anti-FLAG antibodies followed by incubation with the corresponding Texas Red- and fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled secondary antibodies. Images were obtained on a Leica DMRB microscope equipped with a Princeton CoolSnapFX CCD camera controlled by MetaVue software. Frozen tumor tissues were obtained after surgery from different French hospitals. Total RNA was isolated from tumor and liver tissues using RNA-Plus RNA extraction solution (Quantum Biotechnologies). Up to 2 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript II RT RNase H-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) primer. PCR was carried out as follows: 94 °C for 3 min followed by 32 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s; 57 °C for 30 s; 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension of 6 min. PCR products were analyzed in 1.5% agarose gels. The 18 S ribosomal RNA was amplified as control. The primer sequences are as follows: FHL2-F, 5′-GCCAAGAAGTGTGCTGGG-3′; FHL2-R, 5′-GCAACGGGAGGTTACAGAG-3′; 18S-F, 5′-GTAACCCGTTGAACCCCATT-3′; and 18S-R, 5′-CCATCCAATCGGTAGTAGCG-3′. To identify β-catenin-binding proteins, a yeast two-hybrid system was used to screen a HeLa cDNA expression library with β-catenin arm repeats 1–10 (amino acids 132–554) as a bait (Fig. 1 A). One clone interacting specifically with β-catenin contained the coding sequence for full-length FHL2 (279 amino acids) (Fig. 1 B). The interaction of FHL2 with β-catenin was further confirmed by GST pull down. Using GST-β-catenin bound to Sepharose beads and in vitro expressed 35S-labeled FHL2 or conversely with GST-FHL2 and 35S-labeled β-catenin, we found specific binding of FHL2 to β-catenin, since GST alone was not able to pull down the binding partners (Fig. 2 A).Figure 2Interaction of FHL2 with β-catenin in vitro and in vivo. A, 35S-labeled FHL2 or β-catenin proteins were incubated with GST-β-catenin or GST-FHL2, respectively. GST was used as control. 50% of input was loaded on the gels. B, the FHL2 antibody specifically recognizes the N-terminal domain of FHL2. Plasmids expressing LIM domains 3 and 4 (L3–4), full-length FHL2, and the N-terminal LIM domains (L1/2–2) were transfected in HeLa cells. Cells lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with FHL2 antibody.C, β-catenin coimmunoprecipitates with FHL2. HeLa cells were transfected with His-tagged β-catenin and arm repeats 1–12. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with FHL2 antibody, and β-catenin in the immune complexes was revealed by immunoblotting with anti-His antibody (panel I). Expression of β-catenin (panel II) and FHL2 (panel III) in HeLa cells was revealed by immunoblotting with His and FHL2 antibodies. The arrow inpanel I indicates His-tagged arm repeats 1–12 immunoprecipitated by FHL2. IP, immunoprecipitation;IB, immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) FHL2 and β-catenin interaction was tested next by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. We generated a polyclonal antibody against the N-terminal domain of FHL2, which recognized specifically the FHL2 protein (Fig. 2 B). His-tagged full-length β-catenin and His-tagged arm repeats 1–12 were transiently transfected in HeLa cells, and cell lysates were precipitated by FHL2 antibody followed by immunoblotting analysis with anti-His antibody. Both full-length and arm1–12 β-catenin proteins were revealed in the immune complexes (Fig. 2 C, panel I). Specific coimmunoprecipitation of β-catenin with FHL2 was verified using preimmune sera that failed to precipitate β-catenin (Fig. 2 C, panel IV). Thus, the interaction of FHL2 with β-catenin observed in the two-hybrid system also occurs in mammalian cells. To test the binding specificity between β-catenin and FHL2, we next tested whether ACT, a related member of the FHL family (30Fimia G.M. De Cesare D. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1999; 398: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), can interact with β-catenin in the yeast two-hybrid assay. When full-length ACT in the pACT2 vector was cotransformed with the β-catenin bait arm1–10 into yeast cells, no interaction was observed between β-catenin and ACT (data not shown). Serial deletion mutants of β-catenin carrying various arm repeat sequences in-frame with GAL4 DBD (Fig. 1 A) were first tested for their trans-activation activity in yeast, and constructs devoid of intrinsic activity were used to map the region mediating the binding to FHL2. Stable expression of β-catenin fragments in yeast was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-GAL4 antibody (data not shown). Our results show that the arm repeats 3–8, which mediate β-catenin binding to LEF1 (31von Kries J.P. Winbeck G. Asbrand C. Schwarz-Romond T. Sochnikova N. Dell'Oro A. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 800-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), were required but not sufficient for interaction with FHL2 (see Fig. 1 A). Deletion of arm repeat 10 resulted in a 4-fold increase of binding activity, designating β-catenin arm repeats 1–9 as the optimal domain responsible for FHL2 binding. To map the FHL2 domain mediating the interaction with β-catenin, overlapping constructs containing different LIM domains in fusion with GAL4 activation domain were tested for interaction with β-catenin arm repeats 1–10 in the yeast (see Fig. 1 B). Although truncated FHL2 proteins were stably expressed in yeast (data not shown), all of the four and half of LIM domains were required for interaction with β-catenin, consistent with the finding that only full-length FHL2 was pulled out from the initial two-hybrid screen. The β-catenin-TCF complex activates gene expression in response to Wnt signaling. Therefore, we assessed the effect of FHL2 on β-catenin trans-activating function in 293 cells using the TOPFLASH luciferase reporter, which contains TCF/LEF consensus-binding sites. As expected, the TOPFLASH reporter gene activity was enhanced by 20-fold by the constitutively active β-catenin T41A in which threonine 41 was changed to alanine, as frequently found in tumors (Fig. 3 A) (32Koch A. Denkhaus D. Albrecht S. Leuschner I. von Schweinitz D. Pietsch T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 269-273PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, when FHL2 was coexpressed with β-catenin, the reporter gene activity was further enhanced up to 4.5-fold in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 A), indicating synergistic cooperation between FHL2 and β-catenin on trans-activation of the reporter gene. FHL2 trans-activation activity was dependent on β-catenin, because expression of the dominant negative TCF4 (ΔNTCF4), which retains DNA binding activity but fails to interact with β-catenin, completely abolished this effect (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, coexpression of FHL2 and β-catenin failed to trans-activate the luciferase gene under the control of mutant TCF/LEF-binding elements (FOPFLASH), demonstrating that the synergistic function of FHL2 and β-catenin was dependent on TCF/LEF. However, FHL2 alone had a weak dose-dependent effect on TOPFLASH and FOPFLASH reporter gene activity (Fig. 3 A, lane 10), suggesting that it might also activate transcription through β-catenin-independent mechanisms. In SW480 colon carcinoma cells, endogenous wild type β-catenin is constitutively active because of defective adenomatous polyposis coli in this cell line. Transient expression of FHL2 in SW480 cells resulted in dose-dependent activation of the TOPFLASH reporter, which was inhibited by the dominant negative Tcf4 (Fig. 3 B). Thus, FHL2 is able to stimulate the trans-activating activity of both wild type and stabilized mutant β-catenin. We then assessed the synergistic function of FHL2 and β-catenin on natural TCF-responsive promoters. 293 cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter controlled by either the cyclin D1promoter known to be regulated by the β-catenin-TCF complex (8Shtutman M. Zhurinsky J. Simcha I. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Pestell R. Ben-Ze'ev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5522-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1926) Google Scholar) or the IL-8 promoter, recently identified as a direct β-catenin-TCF target (11Levy L. Neuveut C. Renard C.A. Charneau P. Branchereau S. Gauthier F. Van Nhieu J.T. Cherqui D. Petit-Bertron A.F. Mathieu D. Buendia M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42386-42393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). As found for the synthetic TOPFLASH reporter, FHL2 increased the cyclin D1 promoter activity in association with β-catenin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 C). This cooperative effect was strongly inhibited by ΔNTcf4 and totally abolished in reporter assays using a cyclin D1 promoter carrying mutated TCF-binding sites (data not shown). Similarly, coexpression of β-catenin and FHL2 synergistically activated the wild type IL-8 promoter, and this effect was abolished when the TCF-binding site in the promoter was mutated (Fig. 3 D). These data suggest that the synergistic interaction of FHL2 and β-catenin might function in vivo on Wnt-responsive genes. We next examined cellular localization of β-catenin and FHL2 in transfected cells by immunofluorescence analysis. When constitutively active β-catenin T41A and FLAG-tagged FHL2 were exogenously expressed in HeLa cells, the two proteins showed a predominant nuclear staining (Fig. 3 E), suggesting that their interaction may occur in the nucleus. To assess the implication of FHL2 in activated expression of cancer-related Wnt-responsive genes, we examined its expression in hepatoblastoma in which a high rate of genetic mutations is associated with nuclear accumulation of β-catenin in a majority of cases (32Koch A. Denkhaus D. Albrecht S. Leuschner I. von Schweinitz D. Pietsch T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 269-273PubMed Google Scholar, 33Wei Y. Fabre M. Branchereau S. Gauthier F. Perilongo G. Buendia M.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 498-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). FHL2 expression was detected by RT-PCR in all of the tumor samples (Fig. 4). Importantly, in 8 of 10 cases, FHL2 expression was markedly up-regulated in tumors compared with matched nontumor livers. This finding suggests that FHL2 expression might play a role in tumor cells by enhancing the trans-activation function of β-catenin. It has been shown that FHL2 as well as β-catenin can individually interact with AR and activate AR-driven transcription (23Muller J.M. Isele U. Metzger E. Rempel A. Moser M. Pscherer A. Breyer T. Holubarsch C. Buettner R. Schule R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 24Truica C.I. Byers S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4709-4713PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of FHL2 to AR was confirmed by GST pull-down experiments using GST-FHL2 and in vitro translated35S-labeled AR (Fig. 5 A). To explore the potential effect of the interaction between FHL2 and β-catenin coactivators on AR function, we cotransfected CV1 cells with a luciferase reporter gene under control of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter (MMTV-Luc) known to be regulated by steroid hormone receptors and vectors expressing wild type β-catenin, FHL2, and human AR. In accordance with previous reports, luciferase activity was enhanced ∼2-fold by either β-catenin or FHL2 in the presence of DHT (Fig. 5 B). When β-catenin and FHL2 were coexpressed with AR, they enhanced AR transcriptional activity by ∼4-fold (Fig. 5 B), indicating that the combined effect of both proteins was only additive. This effect was dependent on the presence of DHT, indicating that transcriptional activation of AR by β-catenin and FHL2 was not attributed to nonspecific interactions of β-catenin or FHL2 with the reporter. This result was further confirmed by the observation that β-catenin and FHL2 were not able to activate the MMTV promoter in the absence of AR (Fig. 5 B). The association of β-catenin with TCF is an essential step in the transduction of the Wnt signal, and transcriptional activity of the β-catenin-TCF complex can be modulated by coactivators and corepressors that interact with β-catenin or TCF. Here we report that FHL2 is a novel partner and coactivator of β-catenin. The physical interaction between FHL2 and β-catenin was demonstrated by in vitro and in vivo assays, including yeast two-hybrid screens, in vitro pull-down assays, and coimmunoprecipitation. Further characterization of the interaction using the yeast two-hybrid assay showed that β-catenin arm repeats 1–9 and the complete set of LIM domains in FHL2 were required for optimal binding. By contrast, no interaction could be detected between β-catenin and ACT, a LIM domain protein closely related to FHL2, ruling out the possibility that LIM domains might mediate nonspecific association with β-catenin. Furthermore, we show that FHL2 potentiates β-catenin trans-activating function on TCF/LEF-dependent transcription of Wnt-responsive genes such as cyclin D1 and interleukin-8 in human kidney and colon cells. Importantly, FHL2 expression in the absence of nuclear β-catenin did not affect the activity of TCF target gene promoters, and cooperation between FHL2 and β-catenin was strictly dependent upon the presence of consensus TCF-binding sites in the cyclin D1 and IL-8 promoters. Finally, ectopically expressed FHL2 and β-catenin were found to colocalize in HeLa cell nuclei, suggesting that nuclear interaction of these proteins might be involved in enhancing TCF transcription. Taken together, our data support the idea that FHL2 might be recruited by β-catenin to TCF-dependent promoters, although no direct evidence has been provided so far for the interaction of FHL2 at an endogenous β-catenin target promoters. While this paper was in revision, similar conclusions were reported by Martin et al.(34Martin B. Schneider R. Janetzky S. Waibler Z. Pandur P. Kuhl M. Behrens J. von der Mark K. Starzinski-Powitz A. Wixler V. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that FHL2 specifically and functionally interacts with endogenous β-catenin in vivo but not with LEF-1 and that β-catenin is able to bind simultaneously FHL2 and LEF-1, forming a ternary protein complex in vitro. The authors identified the N-terminal region and first arm repeat of β-catenin as the FHL2-binding region. However, in our study, the arm repeats 1 and 2 of β-catenin were required for the interaction with FHL2, but optimal binding efficiency was observed for repeats 1–9. This apparent discrepancy might be explained by different strategies that have been used to localize the interacting regions. Alternatively, it is conceivable that different β-catenin domains might be able to bind FHL2. It is striking that different regions in β-catenin have been implicated in the binding of several partners, including TATA-binding protein (12Hecht A. Litterst C.M. Huber O. Kemler R. J. Biol.

In previous studies, FHL2 has been shown to bind different transcription factors acting either as a transcriptional coactivator or as a corepressor (21Fimia G.M. De Cesare D. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8613-8622Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 23Muller J.M. Isele U. Metzger E. Rempel A. Moser M. Pscherer A. Breyer T. Holubarsch C. Buettner R. Schule R.

Chem. 2002; 277: 37045-37053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Interestingly, FHL2 has been shown to activate β-catenin-dependent transcription in epithelial cells (this study and Ref. 34Martin B. Schneider R. Janetzky S. Waibler Z. Pandur P. Kuhl M. Behrens J. von der Mark K. Starzinski-Powitz A. Wixler V. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) while it has opposite down-regulating effect in myoblasts, suggesting a cell type-specific regulation of β-catenin function by FHL2 (34Martin B. Schneider R. Janetzky S. Waibler Z. Pandur P. Kuhl M. Behrens J. von der Mark K. Starzinski-Powitz A. Wixler V. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). LIM domains function as molecular adapters mediating the assembly of multiprotein complexes. Therefore, FHL2 might target other cofactors to β-catenin to link the β-catenin-TCF complex to the RNA polymerase II machinery or to chromatin-remodeling complexes. The impact of FHL2-β-catenin interaction on AR transcriptional activity remains unclear, since we did not observe a cooperative effect of these AR coactivators. Furthermore, all of the FHL2 deletion mutants analyzed had lost the ability to bind AR as well as β-catenin, and the activity of FHL2 and β-catenin on AR transcriptional function did not appear to be dose-dependent. 2C. Labalette and Y. Wei, unpublished data. Therefore, our data might be interpreted as additive effects of each individual protein in contrast with the results obtained for TCF/LEF, which indicates that synergistic activity of β-catenin and FHL2 may be dependent on the promoter context. Further studies using FHL2 null cells or FHL2 mutants retaining only binding to either AR or β-catenin would shed light on the role of FHL2-β-catenin interaction on AR function. Whether the interaction of FHL2 with β-catenin plays a role during oncogenesis is an interesting issue. In human cancers affecting epithelial tissues, β-catenin is frequently activated and the stimulating function of FHL2 on β-catenin might have impact on oncogenic processes. This notion is strongly supported by our finding that the cyclin D1 promoter is markedly activated by FHL2 in a β-catenin-dependent manner and that FHL2 expression is up-regulated in hepatoblastoma. In this pediatric liver tumor, β-catenin was found to be mutated in >50% of cases (32Koch A. Denkhaus D. Albrecht S. Leuschner I. von Schweinitz D. Pietsch T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 269-273PubMed Google Scholar, 33Wei Y. Fabre M. Branchereau S. Gauthier F. Perilongo G. Buendia M.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 498-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and overexpression of cyclin D1 was correlated with β-catenin mutation (39Takayasu H. Horie H. Hiyama E. Matsunaga T. Hayashi Y. Watanabe Y. Suita S. Kaneko M. Sasaki F. Hashizume K. Ozaki T. Furuuchi K. Tada M. Ohnuma N. Nakagawara A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 901-908PubMed Google Scholar). In recent studies of prostate cancer (40Muller J.M. Metzger E. Greschik H. Bosserhoff A.K. Mercep L. Buettner R. Schule R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 736-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), nuclear expression of FHL2 has been detected at higher levels in tumor cells than in normal prostate epithelium, and nuclear trans-location and transcriptional activity of FHL2 might be induced by Rho signaling. Rho family members are frequently overexpressed in human tumors, and the activation of Rho signaling might be involved in the migration and dissemination of tumor cells. Localized in both cytoplasm and nucleus, FHL2 has been found to bind multiple partners including α- and β-integrins that are key regulators of cell adhesion and migration (22Wixler V. Geerts D.

Platelets contribute to lipid uptake by macrophages through mechanisms that are only partially understood. We have previously shown that platelet factor 4 (PF4) inhibits the binding and degradation of LDL through its receptor, a process that could promote the formation of oxidized LDL (ox-LDL). We have now characterized the effect of PF4 on the binding of ox-LDL to vascular cells and macrophages and on the accumulation of cholesterol esters. PF4 bound to ox-LDL directly and also increased ox-LDL binding to vascular cells and macrophages. PF4 did not stimulate ox-LDL binding to cells that do not synthesize glycosaminoglycans or after enzymatic cleavage of cell surface heparan and chondroitin sulfates. The effect of PF4 on binding ox-LDL was dependent on specific lysine residues in its C terminus. Addition of PF4 also caused an ∼10-fold increase in the amount of ox-LDL esterified by macrophages. Furthermore, PF4 and ox-LDL co-localize in atherosclerotic lesion, especially in macrophage-derived foam cells. These observations offer a potential mechanism by which platelet activation at sites of vascular injury may promote the accumulation of deleterious lipoproteins and offer a new focus for pharmacological intervention in the development of atherosclerosis.

These observations offer a potential mechanism by which platelet activation at sites of vascular injury may promote the accumulation of deleterious lipoproteins and offer a new focus for pharmacological intervention in the development of atherosclerosis. The development of atherosclerosis has been attributed to an interplay among several factors, including endothelial cell denudation, adherence and activation of platelets, genetic and acquired hyperlipidemia, oxidation of lipoproteins, infiltration of the vessel wall with macrophages and their conversion to foam cells, and smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration (1Williams K.J. Tabas I. Arterios. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 551-558Google Scholar). Activated platelets may contribute to the progression of atherosclerosis through diverse pathways, including the release of potent smooth muscle cell mitogens such as platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and transforming growth factor-β (2Woolf N.

In accord with these observations, interventions that reduce platelet number and/or inhibit platelet activation retard the formation of atherosclerotic lesions in several experimental systems (7Harker L. Ross R. Slichter S. Scott C. J. Clin. Invest. 1976; 58: 731-741Google Scholar, 8Moore S.R. Friedman R.J. Singal D.P. Gauldie J. Blajchman M. Thromb. Diath. Haemorrhagica. 1976; 35: 70-81Google Scholar). Platelet activation also promotes the accumulation of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) 1The abbreviations used are: LDL, low-density lipoproteins; PF4, platelet factor 4; WT, wild type; NAP, neutrophil-activating protein; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; XT, xylosyl transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; ox-LDL, oxidized LDL; ac-LDL, acetylated LDL; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PG, proteoglycan; HVSMC, human vascular smooth muscle cell by macrophage foam cells (for review see Refs. 9Sevitt S.

The mechanism(s) by which platelets contribute to the accumulation of LDL in the vessel wall are less clear (14Osterud B. Thromb. Res. 1997; 85: 1-22Google Scholar). One potential candidate that might be involved in the accumulation of LDL is platelet factor 4 (PF4), a cationic protein that is released in large amounts when platelets are activated and that is found in atherosclerotic lesions (15Chesterman C.N. Berndt M.C. Clin. Hematol. 1986; 15: 323-353Google Scholar, 16O'Brien J.R. Etherington M.D. Pashley M. Thromb. Haemost. 1984; 51: 354-357Google Scholar). Mature human PF4 is a 70-amino acid, lysine-rich platelet-specific protein that belongs to the CXC (or β) chemokine subfamily, in which the first two of the four conserved cysteine residues are separated by one amino acid residue (17Rollins J.R. Blood. 1997; 90: 909Google Scholar). Human PF4 has been sequenced (18Deuel T.F. Keim P.S. Farmer M. Heinrikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2256-2258Google Scholar) and cloned (19Poncz M. Surrey S. LaRocco P. Weiss M.J. Rappoport E.F. Conway T.M. Schwartz E. Blood. 1987; 69: 219-223Google Scholar), and its x-ray crystallographic structure has been defined (20Zhang X. Chen L. Bancroft D.P. Lai C.K. Maione T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8361-8366Google Scholar). PF4 is synthesized by megakaryocytes and comprises 2–3% of the total protein in mature platelets (21Niewiarowski S. Bloom A.L. Thomas D.P. Hemostasis and Thrombosis. Churchill Livingstone, London1993: 167-177Google Scholar). When platelets are activated, PF4 is secreted in concentrations approaching ∼25 μg/ml (4 μm) in the vicinity of the vessel wall (22St. Stuckey J. Charles R. Edwards B.F. Proteins. 1992; 14: 277-287Google Scholar). PF4 exists as a tetramer with the three β-sheets of each subunit facing inwards and the N and C termini lying on the surface of the molecule. The four lysine-rich C-terminal α-helices form a circumferential band around the tetramer, where they and other cationic residues have been implicated in the binding of heparin (22St. Stuckey J. Charles R. Edwards B.F. Proteins. 1992; 14: 277-287Google Scholar, 23Stern D. Nawroth P. Marcum J. Handley D. Kisiel W. Rosenberg R. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 272-279Google Scholar). PF4 secreted by platelets binds primarily to endothelial heparan sulfate-rich proteoglycans, inhibiting the activity of anti-thrombin III (23Stern D. Nawroth P. Marcum J. Handley D. Kisiel W. Rosenberg R. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 272-279Google Scholar), to the chemokine receptor Duffy on erythrocytes and endothelial cells (24Hadley T.J. Lu Z. Wasniowska K. Martin A.W. Peiper S.C.

Young T.A. Key N.S. Slungaard S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31785-31792Google Scholar). PF4 also binds to exposed subendothelium (29Goldberg I.D. Stemerman M.B. Handin R.I. Science. 1980; 209: 611-612Google Scholar), where it may function as an inhibitor of endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis (30Maione T.E. Gray G.S. Petro J. Hunt A.J. Donner A.L. Bauer S.I. Carson H.F. Sharpe R.J. Science. 1990; 247: 77-79Google Scholar). However, its effects on vessel wall biology and the formation of atherosclerosis are less clear. Although platelet activation promotes the accumulation of LDL by macrophages, PF4 inhibits the uptake of LDL by fibroblasts (31Brown M.S. Deul T.F. Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Supramol. Struc. 1978; 8: 223-234Google Scholar). In an attempt to elucidate the mechanism by which PF4 may facilitate the incorporation of LDL into cells, we previously reported that PF4 diverts the uptake of LDL from the LDL receptor to the relatively inefficient PG-dependent endocytic pathway, likely increasing its residency time in tissue and its propensity to undergo oxidation (47Sachais B.S. Kuo A. Nassar T. Morgan J. Kariko K. Williams K.J. Feldman M. Aviram M. Shah N. Jarett L. Poncz M. Cines D.B. Higazi A.A.-R. Sachais B.S. Kuo A. Nassar T. Morgan J. Kariko K. Williams K.J. Feldman M. Aviram M. Shah N. Jarett L. Poncz M. Cines D.B. Higazi A.A.-R. Blood. 2002; 99: 3613-3622Google Scholar). LDL that has not been internalized and degraded is subject to oxidation in the vascular microenvironment (32Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1785-1792Google Scholar). Unlike LDL, which is internalized primarily through the LDL receptor, oxidized LDL is internalized by the scavenger receptor and several other, more recently described receptors (33Hajjar D.P. Haberland M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22975-22978Google Scholar, 34Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20963-20966Google Scholar, 35Ji Z.-S. Dichek H.L. Miranda R.D. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31285-31292Google Scholar). In the present study we extend these studies by showing that, in contrast to LDL, PF4 stimulates the binding of ox-LDL by vascular cells and promotes its esterification. We propose a novel mechanism by which platelet activation may contribute to the development of atherosclerosis through the release of PF4. A number of recombinant PF4-like proteins that had been previously expressed and purified from prokaryotic cells and characterized for their heparin affinity were used. These include wild type (WT) PF4 and neutrophil-activating protein-2 (NAP-2), a series of lysine to alanine substitutions in the lysine-rich C terminus of PF4, and chimeric proteins between PF4 and NAP-2 (36Ziporen L. Li Z.Q. Park K.S. Sabnekar P. Liu W.Y. Arepally G. Shoenfeld Y. Kieber-Emmons T. Cines D.B. Poncz M. Blood. 1998; 92: 3250-3259Google Scholar). PF4 was radiolabeled with 125I using lactoperoxidase (Sigma) as described (37Higazi A.A.-R. Ganz T. Kariko K. Cines D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17650-17655Google Scholar). Labeled protein was separated from the free iodine using gel filtration (PD-10;Amersham Biosciences), and the protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad microprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. All cell cultures were maintained at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells lacking xylosyl transferase (XT−), and therefore incapable of initiating the synthesis of heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfate chains, were the kind gifts of Dr. J. Esko, University of California, San Diego, CA (38Esko J.D. Cur. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 805-816Google Scholar). WT and mutant CHO cells were grown in Ham's F-12 media supplemented with fetal calf serum (10%), glutamine (200 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and smooth muscle cells were cultured as previously described (39Grobmeyer S.R. Kuo A. Orishimo M. Okada S.S. Cines D.B. Barnathan E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13291-13300Google Scholar). 125I-LDL was prepared, radiolabeled, and characterized as described (40Esterbauer H. Striegl G. Puhl H. Rotheneder M. Free Rad. Res. Commun. 1989; 6: 67-75Google Scholar, 41Aviram M. Dornfeld L. Rosenblat M. Volkova N. Kaplan M. Coleman R. Hayek T. Presser D. Fuhrman B. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2000; 71: 1062-1076Google Scholar). Briefly, LDL was isolated by ultrafiltration at d = 1.019–1.63 g/ml from human plasma containing 1 mg/ml EDTA. The preparation was filtered under sterile conditions, aliquoted into plastic tubes and kept under N2 at 4 °C without exposure to light. LDL was oxidized as described in Ref. 41Aviram M. Dornfeld L. Rosenblat M. Volkova N. Kaplan M. Coleman R. Hayek T. Presser D. Fuhrman B. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2000; 71: 1062-1076Google Scholar. Briefly, LDL was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C to remove EDTA, then diluted with PBS to 0.1 mg of protein per ml prior to oxidation. LDL was incubated with 10 μm CuSO4 at 37 °C for 18 h. LDL oxidation was terminated by adding 25 μmbutylated hydroxytoluene and 100 μm EDTA and by refrigerating the LDL samples at 4 °C. The extent of LDL oxidation was analyzed by the thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances assay, which measures malondialdehyde equivalents (42Buege J. Aust S. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 301-310Google Scholar), and by the lipid peroxides assay that analyzes their capacity to convert iodide to iodine (43El-Saadani M. Esterbauer H. El-Sayed M. Goher M. Nassar A. Jurgens G. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 627-630Google Scholar). The amount of cholesteryl linoleate hydroperoxides was measured by high pressure liquid chromatography (44Aviram M. Rosenblat M. Bisgaier C. Newton R. Primo-Parmo S. La Du B. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1581-1590Google Scholar). Electrophoresis of the lipoproteins was performed on 1% agarose using a Hydragel-Lipo kit (Sebia). The results of the characterization of the ox-LDL are depicted in Table I. Acetylated LDL (Ac-LDL) was prepared by addition of acetic anhydride to a stock solution of LDL (3 mg of protein/ml) diluted 1:1 v:v with a solution of saturated ammonium acetate at 4 °C by the method of Basu et al. (45Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cells were grown to confluence in 48-well Falcon multiwell tissue culture plates (Becton Dickinson, Lincoln Park, NJ) to a final density of ∼5 × 104 cells/well. The cells were prechilled to 4 °C for 30 min and washed twice with cold binding buffer composed of PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). The cells were then incubated with 125I-LDL alone or in the presence of PF4 for 3 h at 4 °C. The incubation was terminated by washing the cells four times with binding buffer to remove unbound ligand. Radiolabeled ligand bound to the cell surface was released with 50 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.8. The cells were then solubilized by adding 0.1 n NaOH, and the residual cell-associated radioactivity was measured. Nonspecific binding was determined by measuring cell-associated radioactivity in the presence of 20-fold molar excess unlabeled LDL. Specific binding was defined as the difference between total and nonspecific binding. The same cells and conditions were used to measure the binding 125I-PF4 as were used to determine the binding of 125I-LDL. In other experiments, the formation of complexes between125I-PF4 with LDL and with ox-LDL was examined.125I-rPF4 (25 nm) was incubated with LDL, ox-LDL, or BSA (50 nm) for 30 min at 37 °C in PBS. The mixture was applied to a Bio-spin 30-gel filtration column (Bio-Rad), and the radioactivity in the excluded volume was measured. To examine the binding of 125I-ox-LDL/PF4 complexes to cells,125I-ox-LDL was incubated with rPF4 or BSA for 30 min at 37 °C in PBS. The complexes were separated on Sephadex G-75. These and all experiments described below were performed in triplicates and were repeated a minimum of three times, unless otherwise noted. All data are presented as mean ± S.D. of the three experiments. Cells grown on coverslips were incubated in DMEM containing ox-LDL with or without PF4 and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed three times with PBS, fixed for 10 min with 4% formaldehyde in PBS, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton x-100 in PBS-BSA buffer for 3 min. The coverslips were overlaid for 20 min with 2% normal horse serum and then incubated for 40 min with anti-ox-LDL antibodies diluted 1:500 with PBS. After four washes with PBS, the cells were stained for 40 min with Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit serum (Molecular Probes), washed four times with PBS and mounted in 80% glycerol and 20% PBS supplemented with 3% DABCO (1,4-diazabicyclo-(2, 2)-octane) as anti-bleaching agent. No staining was seen when either anti-defensin or the secondary antibody was omitted. Confocal microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal laser scanning system attached to the Zeiss axiovert 135 minverted microscope 40×/1.3 plain oil immersion lens. The system was equipped with a 25-mW argon laser (488 nm excitation line with 515 nm low pass barrier filter) for the excitation of Alexa 488 green fluorescence. The differential interference contrast images according to Nomarski were collected simultaneously using a transmitted light detector. Autofluorescence of the specimen was set to background level. J774 murine macrophages were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were washed, and the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 200 nm native or ox-LDL in the presence or absence of 100 nm PF4. 3H-oleic acid (100 μm) was added in the form of oleate-albumin complex (3:1 molar ratio) for 24 h at 37 °C, and the incorporation of 3H-oleic acid was measured as a marker of cholesterol ester formation. To do so, the medium was collected, the cells were washed four times with PBS, and 1 ml of absolute ethanol was then added for 2 h. The ethanol extract was separated by thin layer chromatography on silica gels. The bands were identified and isolated, and the radioactivity incorporated into the cholesterol ester fraction was counted. The total and free cholesterol contents of J774 cells were determined using an enzymatic kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For these assays, J774 cells were harvested by scraping into distilled water and processed as described previously (46Kruth H.S. Skarlatos S. Gaynor P. G. W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12420-12423Google Scholar). J774 protein content was determined by the method of Lowry et al. using BSA as a standard. Human atherosclerotic arteries were obtained anonymously from either surgically removed or autopsy specimens from the Cooperative Human Tissue Network, Eastern division, after approval from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine Institutional Review Board. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded 5-μm sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 0.9% peroxide in methanol and unreactive sites were blocked with 10% goat serum in 1× automation buffer (Biomeda Corp.) for 20 min at 37 °C. Slides were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with either rabbit anti-PF4 antibody (1 μg/ml polyclonal affinity-purified antibody from PeproTech), rabbit anti-ox-LDL antibody (1:250 dilution of rabbit serum from CHEMICON International), or normal rabbit serum as control. Sections were then washed in 1× automation buffer and incubated for 30 min with biotinylated goat-anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA) diluted 1:200 at 37 °C. Slides were washed and incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Research Genetics) for 30 min at 37 °C and washed, and stable diaminobenzine chromogen (Research Genetics) was applied for 5 min at 20 °C. Slides were counterstained with dilute hematoxylin. We have previously reported that PF4 diverts the uptake of LDL from the LDL receptor to the relatively inefficient PG-dependent endocytic pathway, likely increasing its residency time in tissue and its propensity to undergo oxidation (47Sachais B.S.

LDL that has not been internalized and degraded is subject to oxidation in the vascular microenvironment (32Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1785-1792Google Scholar). Unlike LDL, which is internalized primarily through the LDL receptor, oxidized LDL is internalized by the scavenger receptor and several other, more recently described receptors (33Hajjar D.P. Haberland M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22975-22978Google Scholar, 34Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20963-20966Google Scholar, 35Ji Z.-S. Dichek H.L. Miranda R.D. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31285-31292Google Scholar). Therefore, based on its effects on LDL, we examined the effect of PF4 on the uptake of ox-LDL by cells involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. In contrast to its inhibitory effect on the binding of LDL to cells (47Sachais B.S. Kuo A. Nassar T. Morgan J. Kariko K. Williams K.J. Feldman M. Aviram M. Shah N. Jarett L. Poncz M. Cines D.B. Higazi A.A.-R. Sachais B.S. Kuo A. Nassar T. Morgan J. Kariko K. Williams K.J. Feldman M. Aviram M. Shah N. Jarett L. Poncz M. Cines D.B. Higazi A.A.-R. Blood. 2002; 99: 3613-3622Google Scholar), PF4 promoted the binding of ox-LDL to cultured endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells ∼5-fold, and to J774 cells ∼7-fold (Fig.1 A). Binding of ox-LDL to HUVEC was increased by PF4 in a dose-dependent and saturable manner (Fig. 1); half-maximal enhancement was observed at a PF4 concentration of 1.63 μm. Lower concentrations of PF4 (50 nm) were sufficient to enhance the internalization of ox-LDL as assessed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 1 B). These data are consistent with the known enhancement of platelet activation on LDL metabolism and cholesterol ester accumulation by macrophages (9Sevitt S. Atherosclerosis. 1986; 61: 107-115Google Scholar, 10Kruth H.S. Science. 1985; 227: 1243-1245Google Scholar, 11Curtiss L.K. Black A.S. Takagi Y. Plow E.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 367-373Google Scholar, 12Aviram M. Thromb. Haemost. 1995; 74: 560-564Google Scholar). The finding that PF4 has opposing effects on the binding of LDL and ox-LDL suggests that it may interact differently with the two forms of the lipoprotein. To explore this possibility, we examined the binding of125I-PF4 to LDL or ox-LDL directly using gel filtration. Indeed, ox-LDL, but not WT LDL or BSA, bound radiolabeled PF4 (Fig.2 A). To examine the consequences of this interaction, we next examined the binding of ox-LDL/PF4 complexes to vascular cells and macrophages. Radiolabeled ox-LDL was incubated with PF4, the complexes were isolated by gel filtration, and binding to cells was measured.125I-ox-LDL/PF4 complexes exhibited ∼5-fold more binding to endothelial cells than did 125I-ox-LDL alone (Fig.2 B). We observed a comparable increase in the binding of PF4-ox-LDL complexes to HVSMC and J774 cells (data not shown). These data suggest that PF4 and ox-LDL bind to cells as a complex. Based on this finding, our next aim was to define the portion of the complex (ox-LDL or PF4) that mediates cell binding. To address this question, we examined the effect of ox-LDL on the binding of125I-PF4 to cells. ox-LDL did not stimulate the binding of PF4 (data not shown). The finding that PF4 stimulated the binding of ox-LDL, whereas ox-LDL did not stimulate the binding of PF4, is consistent with a model wherein PF4 mediates the binding of the complex to the cells and binding of ox-LDL itself does not contribute to this process. To understand the mechanism by which PF4-ox-LDL complexes bind to cells, we took advantage of the fact that PF4 binds to heparin (48Nath N. Lowery C.T. Niewiarowski S. Blood. 1975; 45: 537-550Google Scholar) and to cell surface-associated proteoglycans (49Rucinski B. Niewiarowski S. Strzyzewski M. Holt J.C. Mayo K.H. Thromb. Haemost. 1990; 63: 493-498Google Scholar) and that the binding to proteoglycans is inhibited by heparin. Furthermore, heparin does not bind ox-LDL (50Keidar S. Kaplan M. Aviram M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 97-105Google Scholar). Based on this, we examined the effect of heparin on the binding of ox-LDL/PF4 to cells. Heparin inhibited the binding of ox-LDL/PF4 to HUVEC to essentially the same level as ox-LDL alone (Fig.2 B). Taken together, these data suggest that components on the cell surface that share properties with heparin and that bind PF4 are engaged in the binding of the ox-LDL/PF4 complexes. Given the above data, proteoglycans containing glycosaminoglycans that share similarity with heparin and bind PF4 are likely candidates to be the cell surface binding sites for ox-LDL/PF4 complexes. To examine this possibility, we compared the binding of the ox-LDL/PF4 complexes to cells with altered proteoglycan cell surface expression. In these experiments we used two independent approaches. In the first approach, we used a XT− CHO cells that are incapable of synthesizing heparan or chondroitin sulfates. These cells bound ox-LDL/PF4 complexes poorly compared with WT CHO cells (Fig.3). Second, simultaneous digestion of heparan and chondroitin sulfates from the cell surface neutralized the stimulatory effect of PF4 on ox-LDL binding to WT CHO cells by more than 80% (data not shown). Enzymatic cleavage of heparan and chondroitin sulfates also greatly decreased the capacity of HUVEC to bind ox-LDL/PF4 complexes (Fig. 3). As a third, independent approach toward understanding the requirements for PF4 to promote the binding of ox-LDL to cells, we studied the effect of NAP-2, another member of the CXC chemokine family that shares extensive sequence homology with PF4 and demonstrates significant affinity for heparin (51Walz A. Baggiolini M. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 449-454Google Scholar, 52Yan Z. Zhang J. Holt J.C. Stewart G.J. Niewiarowski S. Poncz M. Blood. 1994; 84: 2329-2339Google Scholar). NAP-2 did not affect the binding of ox-LDL (Fig.4 A). Two chimeric constructs in which sequences from PF4 had been exchanged with an analogous region of NAP-2 were then used to further define the structural elements in PF4 involved ox-LDL metabolism. These constructs were NPPP, in which the N-terminal eight amino acids before the first of the four conserved cysteine residues in PF4 was replaced with the homologous NAP-2 sequence, and NNNP, in which the complete PF4 sequence from the N terminus to the fourth cysteine residue was replaced with the homologous sequence from NAP-2. Previous studies showed that NPPP binds heparin with the same affinity as PF4, while NNNP binds similarly to both NAP-2 and the lysine to alanine PF4 C-terminal substitutions discussed below (36Ziporen L. Li Z.Q. Park K.S. Sabnekar P. Liu W.Y. Arepally G. Shoenfeld Y. Kieber-Emmons T. Cines D.B. Poncz M. Blood. 1998; 92: 3250-3259Google Scholar). NPPP was as effective as PF4 in stimulating ox-LDL binding by HUVEC, whereas NNNP was as ineffective as NAP-2 (Fig.4 A). These studies showed that the N terminus of PF4 is not critically involved in modulating ox-LDL binding. Consistent with the ability of heparin to block PF4/ox-LDL complexes from binding to cell surfaces (Fig. 2 B), the importance of surface heparanoid molecules in complex binding (Fig. 3), and the fact that NAP-2 binds heparin with somewhat lower affinity than does PF4 (37Higazi A.A.-R. Ganz T. Kariko K. Cines D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17650-17655Google Scholar), we next examined the determinants in PF4 required to bind heparin in greater detail and to consider their impact on ox-LDL binding. Each PF4 monomer contains four lysine residues that have been implicated in the binding of heparin and that are located in the C-terminal α-helical domain (20Zhang X. Chen L. Bancroft D.P. Lai C.K. Maione T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8361-8366Google Scholar). The results of a previous study (36Ziporen L. Li Z.Q. Park K.S. Sabnekar P. Liu W.Y. Arepally G. Shoenfeld Y. Kieber-Emmons T. Cines D.B. Poncz M. Blood. 1998; 92: 3250-3259Google Scholar) show that mutation of any of the four amino acids residues from lysine to alanine reduced heparin-binding affinity of the PF4 tetramer. In the current study, we asked whether these lysine residues were also involved in the capacity of PF4 to stimulate binding of ox-LDL to cells. To do so, we compared the capacity of recombinant PF4 variants with individual Lys to Ala substitutions at positions 62, 65, or 66 to inhibit the binding of 125I-LDL to the cells. (PF4K63A did not express well, and no protein was available to test its function). Whereas PF4K62A and PF4K65A were almost as potent as PF4 both in terms of inhibiting LDL binding and promoting ox-LDL binding to endothelial cells, PF4K66A was less potent than PF4 but more potent than NAP-2 (Fig. 4 B). These data suggest that the heparin-binding lysine residues in the C-terminal α-domain of PF4 contribute to the stimulation of ox-LDL binding. However, the data also indicate that although the binding to heparin is important, it appears not to be the only feature as retention of certain Lys residues are more critical than others with PF4K65A retaining nearly normal activity despite having a reduced heparin-binding capacity comparable to NAP-2. The capacity of NAP-2 and PF4 variants to form complexes with ox-LDL paralleled their capacity to stimulate binding of ox-LDL to cells. Specifically, ox-LDL bound to the chimera NPPP but not to NAP-2 or NNNP (Fig. 5). None of the WT or chimeric chemokines bound to LDL (data not shown), suggesting that the capacity of PF4 to bind to ox-LDL, but not LDL, underlies its divergent effect on the cellular binding of the two lipoproteins. The capacity of each active PF4 variant and the NPPP chimera to stimulate ox-LDL binding was negated in cells genetically lacking or enzymatically stripped of proteoglycans (data not shown), suggesting that each act by the same mechanism as PF4. Even early atherosclerotic lesions are characterized by macrophage-derived foam cells enriched in cholesterol ester. Therefore, we next examined the effect of PF4 on the esterification of cholesterol from ox-LDL. PF4 increases esterification of ox-LDL cholesterol by J774 cells almost 10-fold (Fig.6), while NAP-2 had no effect. Furthermore, Fig. 6 shows that PF4 stimulates the esterification of Ac-LDL cholesterol but not that from native LDL. To study the role of proteoglycans in the PF4-mediated stimulation of ox-LDL esterification, we incubated the cells with heparanase and chondroitinase. Enzymatic cleavage of proteoglycans decreased the capacity of J774 cells to esterify cholesterol from the ox-LDL/PF4 complex by more than 70% (data not shown). These studies show that PF4 binds ox-LDL in vitro, and the resultant complex shows enhanced binding to vascular cells and promote esterification of ox-LDL by J774 cells. To confirm the effect of PF4 on ox-LDL metabolism after incubation of J774 cells with ox-LDL in the presence and absence of PF4, the cell content of cholesterol and cholesterol ester was determined. The presence of PF4 during the incubation increased the cell content of cholesterol from 17 ± 3.3 nmol/mg cell protein at time zero to 104 ± 7.3 after 24 h. In the absence of PF4 the increase of cellular cholesterol was only to 37 ± 4.5 nmol/mg cell protein. Similarly, at the end of the incubation, in the presence of PF4, the cellular content of cholesterol ester from ox-LDL was 9.8 ± 1.4 nmol/mg cell protein compared to 1.3 ± 0.7 in its absence. Similar results were obtained with Ac-LDL (data not shown). Lastly, to evaluate the relevance of these in vitro findings, we examined the localization of PF4 and ox-LDL in human atherosclerotic lesions. Immunohistochemical staining of serial sections of human arteries involved by atherosclerosis demonstrated the presence of both PF4 and ox-LDL in macrophages (Fig. 7). This was true for early lesions (Fig. 7) as well as more advanced lesions (data not shown). That PF4 is present with ox-LDL in early atherosclerotic lesions supports our hypothesis that PF4 may contribute to early lesion formation by increasing the vascular accumulation of ox-LDL. The molecular basis of the development of atherosclerosis is complex, multifaceted, and incompletely understood. Platelets may contribute to this process by stimulating lipid uptake by macrophages (10Kruth H.S. Science. 1985; 227: 1243-1245Google Scholar, 11Curtiss L.K. Black A.S. Takagi Y. Plow E.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 367-373Google Scholar, 12Aviram M. Thromb. Haemost. 1995; 74: 560-564Google Scholar). However, the mediators responsible for this activity and the mechanism by which they act have not been defined and merit detailed investigation in an era where chronic administration of inhibitors of platelet activation has become possible. One potential mediator of platelet involvement in atherosclerosis is PF4, a chemokine that comprises 2–3% of the total protein releasate on a molar basis (21Niewiarowski S. Bloom A.L. Thomas D.P. Hemostasis and Thrombosis. Churchill Livingstone, London1993: 167-177Google Scholar). The biological role of PF4 is unclear, although it clearly binds to heparin and heparanoid side-chains with high affinity. The potential involvement of PF4 in LDL metabolism has been controversial because of two apparently contradictory observations: PF4 inhibits the uptake of LDL by fibroblasts (47Sachais B.S. Kuo A. Nassar T. Morgan J. Kariko K. Williams K.J. Feldman M. Aviram M. Shah N. Jarett L. Poncz M. Cines D.B. Higazi A.A.-R. Sachais B.S. Kuo A. Nassar T. Morgan J. Kariko K. Williams K.J. Feldman M. Aviram M. Shah N. Jarett L. Poncz M. Cines D.B. Higazi A.A.-R. Blood. 2002; 99: 3613-3622Google Scholar), while, on the other hand, platelet activation stimulates macrophage uptake of cholesterol (9Sevitt S. Atherosclerosis. 1986; 61: 107-115Google Scholar, 10Kruth H.S. Science. 1985; 227: 1243-1245Google Scholar, 11Curtiss L.K. Black A.S. Takagi Y. Plow E.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 367-373Google Scholar, 12Aviram M. Thromb. Haemost. 1995; 74: 560-564Google Scholar). Our finding that PF4 inhibits the binding and degradation of LDL by cells but stimulates the binding of ox-LDL offers an explanation for these apparently divergent findings. The effect of PF4 on both forms of the lipoprotein involves its capacity to bind heparin-like molecules. Mutation of the amino acid residues involved in heparin binding decreases its capacity to affect the binding of both subtypes of LDL. Moreover, heparin inhibits the effect of PF4 on both species of LDL. How does the interaction of PF4 with heparin inhibit the binding of LDL to cells while stimulating ox-LDL binding to the same cells? Our studies provide insight into this aspect of the process by showing that one striking difference is that PF4 binds to ox-LDL but not to LDL. The stimulatory effect of PF4 depends on its ability to bind heparin and ox-LDL simultaneously. Only WT PF4 and mutants that bind heparin and form complexes with ox-LDL enhance lipoprotein binding to cells. Similarly, chimeric PF4 constructs that bind heparin weakly and/or that do not bind ox-LDL had no stimulatory effect. The mechanism we propose to explain the effect of PF4 on ox-LDL binding to cells is consistent with studies suggesting that several cell types express a low affinity, high capacity pathway for the uptake of cationized lipoproteins (45Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3178-3182Google Scholar). Taking into consideration our studies and those previously reported, we propose that PF4 released from activated platelets in the vicinity of a perturbed vascular wall stimulates atherosclerosis through the following mechanism: PF4 blocks LDL uptake by the LDL receptor expressed by all of the prevalent cell types in the vascular wall, increasing its retention within the vascular space. Increased residence time in the vasculature permits the lipoprotein to undergo oxidative and non-oxidative modifications. PF4 binds to nascent and preformed ox-LDL. PF4 bridges ox-LDL and cell surface proteoglycans promoting vascular retention. PF4 also enhances the endocytosis and subsequent esterification of the cell-bound ox-LDL in macrophages, accelerating the formation of foam cells. Our data lead us to propose a multistep process by which PF4 accelerates the rate of plasma-derived LDL cholesterol accumulation in the vascular tissue. PF4 has been imputed to participate in diverse other biologic functions through its strong affinity for heparin-like molecules in addition to those reported in this study. Some of these, such as its chemotactic properties for inflammatory cells (6Holvoet P. Collen D. Curr. Opin. Lipid. 1997; 8: 320-328Google Scholar, 54Gawaz M. Neumann F.J. Dickfeld T. Koch W. Laugwitz K.L. Adelsberger H. Langenbrink K. Page S. Neumeier D. Schomig A. Brand K. Circulation. 1998; 98: 1164-1171Google Scholar) and its ability to induce monocytes to differentiate into macrophages (53Scheuerer B. Ernst M. Durrbaum-Landmann I. Fleischer J. Grage-Griebenow E. Brandt E. Flad H.D. Petersen F. Blood. 2000; 95: 1158-1166Google Scholar) may also contribute to the development of atherosclerosis. The fact that PF4 and ox-LDL were found to be co-localized in human atherosclerotic lesions supports the conclusions of our in vitro studies. Nevertheless, in vivo studies underway in our laboratory in which PF4 concentrations are enhanced or eliminated in transgenic animal models are needed to determine the biological relevance of PF4 for the development of atherosclerosis."

Purified pol II and oligo(dC)-tailed templates containing a single non-bulky DNA lesion on the transcribed strand such as an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site, uracil, or 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) were used for transcription elongation assays. In this system pol II could bypass both the AP site and uracil without pausing and insert cytosine opposite the AP site and either guanine or adenine opposite to uracil. Thus, the AP site on the DNA templates could lead to correct transcription only if depurination at guanine occurred, whereas uracil generated either the correct transcriptional product or an incorrect one with a G:C to A:T transition. In the case of 8-oxoG, pol II stalled at the lesion, but sometimes bypassed it and inserted a cytosine residue or the incorrect adenine residue leading to a G:C to T:A transversion. These findings indicate that 8-oxoG lesions caused a blockage of transcription elongation and/or the misincorporation of a ribonucleotide by pol II, implying the initiation of transcription-coupled repair of 8-oxoG and/or transcriptional mutagenesis.

Once the DNA has lesions, essential DNA-dependent processes are interfered with and mutation or cell death can occur. Thus, DNA repair removes lesions from DNA to maintain genomic integrity. To remove DNA lesions, cells have two major repair pathways; nucleotide excision repair (NER)1 operating primarily on bulky helix-distorting damage caused by environmental mutagens and base excision repair (BER) for non-bulky and non-helix-distorting DNA modifications caused by endogenous and some chemical carcinogen-induced damage (1Lindahl T. Wood R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar, 2de Laat W.L. Jaspers N.G.J. Hoeijmakers J.H.J.

American Society of Microbiology, Washington, DC.1995Google Scholar). When RNA polymerase II in the elongation phase encounters DNA damage that blocks transcription, transcription-coupled repair (TCR), a specialized pathway that efficiently removes lesions on the transcribed strand, operates to counteract the immediate and cytotoxic response of the interference (4Tornaletti S. Hanawalt P.C. Biochimie. (Paris). 1999; 81: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 5Hanawalt P.C. Mutat. Res. 2001; 485: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 6Svejstrup J.Q. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The transcribed strand is repaired much faster by TCR than is the non-transcribed strand or inactive regions by global genome repair (GGR) (7Mellon I. Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1987; 51: 241-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). TCR is found not only in eukaryotes but also in prokaryotes (5Hanawalt P.C. Mutat. Res. 2001; 485: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Its importance in humans has been suggested by studies of autosomal recessive human inherited diseases: xeroderma pigementosum (XP) and Cockayne's syndrome (CS) (8Nance M.A. Berry S.A. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1992; 42: 68-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). NER-deficient XP is classified into seven genetic complementation groups (XP-A to XP-G). Both the TCR and GGR subpathways of NER are defective in all these groups except for XP-C and XP-E, in which only GGR is impaired. CS is mostly classified into two genetic complementation groups (CS-A and CS-B). XP-B patients and certain individuals with XP-D or XP-G show features of CS in addition to XP symptoms (XP-B/CS, XP-D/CS, and XP-G/CS). CS-A and CS-B cells are deficient in TCR but proficient in GGR. Although TCR was first thought to be a specific subpathway of NER, it was recently reported that 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) and thymine glycol are also repaired by a TCR subpathway of BER (TCR of oxidative damage), and this subpathway is specifically deficient in CS-A, CS-B, XP-B/CS, XP-D/CS, and XP-G/CS but proficient in XP-A. These results suggest that the symptoms of CS, such as postnatal growth failure and neurological complications, result from a defect in the TCR of oxidative damage, the repair requiring XPG and TFIIH as well as CSA and CSB (9Le Page F.

Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, DC.1995Google Scholar). Its biological significance is revealed by the existence of a three-tiered defense system composed of the proteins MutT (8-oxodGTPase), Fpg (DNA glycosylase/AP lyase), and MutY (DNA glycosylase) in Escherichia coli. Inactivation of any of the genes of these three generates a mutator phenotype attributed to the persistence of 8-oxoG in DNA or in the pool of deoxynucleoside-triphosphates (11Michaels M.L. Miller J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6321-6325Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 12Tajiri T. Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Mutat. Res. 1995; 336: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In human cells, thehOGG1gene encodes a DNA glycosylase/AP lyase that catalyzes the removal of 8-oxoG and incises DNA at the resulting AP site. However, it was reported that the TCR of 8-oxoG was proficient inmOGG1 (−/−) cells, suggesting that the TCR of oxidative damage occurs independent of OGG1 (13Le Page F. Klungland A. Barnes D.E. Sarasin A. Boiteux S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8397-8402Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of TCR is unknown, the process is thought to be initiated by a blockage of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II at DNA lesions (6Svejstrup J.Q. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 23Sugasawa K. Ng J.M. Masutani C. Iwai S. van der Spek P.J. Eker A.P. Hanaoka F. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. Mol.

Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, DC.1995Google Scholar), it is unlikely that it blocks RNA polymerase II. Moreover, it was reported that DNA polymerases preferentially insert an adenine residue opposite 8-oxoG, leading to A:8-oxoG mispairs (14Shibutani S. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Nature. 1991; 349: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2047) Google Scholar, 15Maki H. Sekiguchi M.

To assess the contribution of RNA polymerase II to the TCR of 8-oxoG in mammalian cells, we investigated whether the purified RNA polymerase II stalls at the AP site, uracil, and 8-oxoG on the transcribed strand during the elongation reaction. RNA polymerase II (pol II) was prepared from HeLa nuclear pellets as described (18Usuda Y. Kubota A. Berk A.J. Handa H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2305-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). E. coli formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg) and human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (AP endonuclease) were purchased from Trevigen. Uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) was obtained from USB. NTPs were from Amersham Biosciences, and restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs and TOYOBO. The 24-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotides containing an AP site analogue (3-hydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)-tetrahydrofuran) (dSpacer), uracil, or 8-oxoG shown in Fig. 1 A were synthesized and purified by Qiagen. To generate a substrate suitable for transcription elongation by mammalian RNA pol II on a lesion, oligonucleotides containing a lesion were 5′-phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase using ATP and incorporated into covalently closed circular DNA as described (19Shivji M.K.K. Moggs J.G. Kuraoka I. Wood R.D. Henderson D.S. DNA Repair Protocols: Eukaryotic Systems. 113. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 373-392Google Scholar). The plasmid pBlueScript II KS-GTG (pBSII KS-GTG) was constructed by replacing the ApaI-KpnI fragment of pBlueScript II KS- with the synthetic 99-bp DNA duplex containing the damage site (Fig. 1 A). The purity of each DNA substrate was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. To confirm the proper insertion of a lesion into pBSII KS-GTG, each DNA substrate was incubated with the indicated enzyme and analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. For the elongation reaction by pol II, an oligo(dC)-tailed template was prepared as described (20Kitajima S. Chibazakura T. Yonaha M. Yasukochi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29970-29977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from the covalently closed circular DNA containing a site-specific DNA lesion. The pBSII KS-GTG containing a lesion at a specific site was digested with PstI, and poly(dC) tails of 35–40 nucleotides were added to the 3′ ends by terminal deoxynucleotide transferase using dCTP. After digestion of the DNA with SmaI to generate two fragments, the DNA substrate fragment with a lesion was purified on an agarose gel and used as a template. For the transcription elongation assay (21Yamaguchi Y. Takagi T. Wada T. Yano K. Furuya A. Sugimoto S. Hasegawa J. Handa H. Cell. 1999; 97: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), 20 μl of reaction mixtures containing 50 ng of dC-tailed template and 0.5 μl of pol II in a buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 3.2% polyethylene glycol, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, 6 mm MgCl2, and 8 units RNase inhibitor (Promega)) were preincubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Elongation was started by adding 5 μl of NTP mixture (50 μm each of ATP, CTP, and GTP, 10 μm UTP, and 1 μCi [α-32P]UTP) and terminated by adding 100 μl of Stop buffer (7 m urea, 0.35 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS) at the times indicated. The purified transcripts were resuspended in formamide loading dye (98% deionized formamide, 25 mm Tris borate-EDTA, 0.025% bromphenol blue, and 0.025% xylene cyanol) and separated on a denatured 6% polyacrylamide gel. The dried gels were analyzed using a FUJIFILM BAS 2500 bio-image analyzer. RNA transcripts for sequence analysis were extracted from mixtures of the elongation reaction in the presence of a cold NTP mixture (50 μm each of ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP) with an RNA purification kit (Qiagen) and then treated with RNase-free DNase I (TAKARA) as recommended by the supplier. Purified RNAs were employed to synthesize PCR products with a One-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) or a cMaster RT-PCR system and RT kit (Eppendorf) and primers (751–770) 5′-GCCCTGCTGCCATGCGCGG-3′ and (1003–984) 5′-ACTCATTAGGCACCCCAGGC-3′. The PCR products (253 bp) were purified with a PCR purification kit (Qiagen), analyzed by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel or on a 6% non-denatured polyacrylamide gel, and then sequenced using the BigDye Terminator kit (Applied Biosystems) with PCR primers. To analyze the transcription elongation at DNA lesions (AP site, uracil, and 8-oxoG) by human RNA polymerase II, oligo(dC)-tailed templates were generated from purified closed circular duplex DNA substrates containing a lesion at a specific site (Fig.1 A). A 3054-bp substrate, designated pBSII KS-GTG, contains these DNA lesions within the recognition sequence (5′-GTGCAC-3′) of the restriction enzymeAlw44I (Fig. 1 A). When control DNA substrate (with no damage) was digested with Alw44I, three DNA fragments (1246 bp, 1078 bp, and 730 bp) were observed (Fig.1 B, lanes 2). DNA substrates containing either an AP site or uracil were also completely digested by Alw44I (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4 and 6), while DNA substrate with 8-oxoG was completely resistant to the cleavage (Fig.1 B, lane 8), indicating that ∼100% of the substrate contained 8-oxoG lesions. When closed circular DNA substrates containing either uracil or 8-oxoG were incubated with DNA repair enzymes (uracil DNA glycosylase and HAP endonuclease, or Fpg glycosylase), those with the lesion were cleaved to an open circular form but the control substrate was not. The partial digestion of the template with DNA repair enzymes was due to an insufficient concentration of enzymes available from the supplier (Fig. 1,C and D). The AP site was not tested because the dSpacer, a (3-hydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)-tetrahydrofuran) that was used as an analogue of the AP site in the experiments, is known to be resistant to the nicking activity of AP lyase. These results, as well as those from the sequence analysis of RT-PCR products (Fig.3 C), indicate the presence of site-specific DNA damage in the DNA substrate. Transcription elongation by pol II was carried out with oligo(dC)-tailed templates containing no damage (control template), AP site, uracil, or 8-oxoG. (The lesions were built on the template strand.) pol II could synthesize transcripts using the control template as expected (Fig.2 B, lanes 1 and2). Using control template digested with eitherAlw44I or N.BstNBI, which partially generates double or single strand breaks under the conditions, pol II produced 129 nt (from the PstI site to the Alw44I site) and 101 nt (from the PstI site to the N.BstNBI site) transcripts (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 3–6). When the template containing either the AP site or uracil was used, pol II could catalyze the synthesis of the transcript (Fig.2 B, lanes 7–10). On the other hand, using the template with 8-oxoG, pol II synthesized 128-nt transcripts from thePstI site to 8-oxoG (Fig. 2 B, lanes 11and 12, arrow) and bypassed the lesion as well (Fig. 2 B, bracket), suggesting that some pol II stalled at the 8-oxoG site while some bypassed the lesion. When these templates containing a base lesion were incubated with T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNA pol), instead of human pol II, T7 RNA Pol did not stall at the lesion (data not shown). To confirm the pausing of 8-oxoG on transcription elongation by pol II at 8-oxoG, time course experiments were carried out (Fig.2 C), and the transcripts (shown by brackets in Fig.2 C) were quantified (Fig. 2 D). In the case of the templates containing no damage, AP site, or uracil, pol II generated similar amounts of transcripts beyond the lesion in a time-dependent manner. In contrast, the amount of bypassed transcripts that was synthesized for 12 min by pol II using the oligo(dC) template containing 8-oxoG, was less than one-third that of the others. These results indicate that 8-oxoG lesions partly inhibited the transcription elongation by pol II. To examine the nucleotide preference for incorporation opposite a lesion, we next investigated the sequences of DNA fragments produced by RT-PCR using bypassed transcription products. The RT-PCR products (253 bp) were observed only when a purified RNA fraction was incubated with RT (Fig.3 A, upper panel). Incubation of the RNA fraction with RNase I generated no RT-PCR products (Fig. 3 A, lower panel). These results indicated that under our experimental conditions, the PCR product was generated by the transcripts but not by the template DNA. The RT-PCR products were digested with Alw44I. If there are mutations at a restriction site (GTGCAC) containing a lesion, PCR products from the transcripts should be resistant to cleavage. The results (Fig.3 B) showed that the PCR products from the uracil template were partially resistant, but the products derived from templates with no damage, AP site, or 8-oxoG were not resistant. Sequence analyses (Fig. 3 C) indicated that in the transcripts from the template with no damage or AP site, no change of sequence was observed. In contrast, the uracil lesion partially generated G:C to A:T transitions. The results are consistent with the finding that UDG-deficient E. coli cells have more G:C to A:T transitions in DNA and mRNA (3Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, DC.1995Google Scholar, 17Viswanathan A. Doetsch P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21276-21281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 22Viswanathan A. You H.J. Doetsch P.W. Science. 1999; 284: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As for 8-oxoG, pol II inserted not only cytosine but also adenine opposite the lesion, although less adenine was incorporated than cytosine. It is known that the 8-oxoG lesion is mutagenic because of its ambiguous pairing with cytosine and adenine (15Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 16Chen Y.H. Bogenhagen D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5849-5855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine which pairing causes pol II to stall, the product of transcription stalled at the 8-oxoG site was quantified at different concentrations of CTP, ATP, or GTP. As the CTP concentration increased, the amount of transcript at pausing sites increased (Fig.4 B, lanes 1–3 andC, circle), whereas as the ATP concentration increased the amount decreased (Fig. 4 B, lanes 5–7 and C, square). When the concentration of GTP or UTP was increased, no effect was observed (Fig.4 A, lanes 1 and 4, and data not shown). In addition, sequence analyses of the bypassed transcription products (Fig. 4 D) revealed that G:C to T:A transversions were increased at high ATP concentrations, but decreased at high CTP concentrations (Fig. 4 E and see the panel for 8-oxoG in Fig. 3 C). Considering that the flanking sequence of the lesion is very rich in TC, high levels of ATP may indirectly improve read-through by facilitating elongation around the lesion. However, this is not the case because high levels of GTP did not affect the read-through. Although we did not directly examine the inserted nucleotide of the paused transcripts, our results indicate that pol II stalled at 8-oxoG lesions due to the insertion of a cytosine, while it bypassed the lesions by inserting adenine. In this study, we found that elongating pol II can efficiently bypass AP sites by inserting cytosine residues and bypass uracil lesions by inserting either adenine or guanine residues. On the other hand, a significant fraction of pol II stalled at 8-oxoG lesions by inserting the correct base, while the rest bypassed the site using either correct or incorrect base insertions. The results are summarized in Table I.Table IStall of RNA polymerase II and inserted base in transcripts on damaged templatesLesionPrecursorStall of pol IIInserted base in transcriptsAP siteG (depurination)NoCUracilC (deamination)NoT or G8-oxoGG (oxidative stress)Yesa8-oxoG might mainly from the syn glycosidic conformation.C >>Aa 8-oxoG might mainly from the syn glycosidic conformation. Open table in a new tab AP sites are the most frequent DNA base lesions in cells and potentially genotoxic and mutagenic (1Lindahl T. Wood R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar, 3Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, DC.1995Google Scholar). These lesions are generated by spontaneous depurination at guanine at an estimated rate of ∼9000/day/genome in humans (24Kunkel T.A. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 93-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that pol II could insert cytosine residues opposite AP sites without pausing. When depurination occurred at guanine, no mutant proteins were generated through a bypass elongation reaction at the AP site. The mechanism by which pol II inserts cytosine opposite AP sites without any Watson-Crick pairing information is unknown as yet. It is known thatE. coli RNA or DNA polymerase exhibits the preferential insertion of adenine opposite AP sites (4Tornaletti S. Hanawalt P.C. Biochimie. (Paris). 1999; 81: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 30Zhou W. Doetsch P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6601-6605Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Therefore, in mammals, bypass transcription at the AP site might play a role in maintaining genome integrity. However, we cannot rule out the possibility, due to the limitation of the sensitivity of our assay that pol II inserts bases other than cytosine at low frequency. Uracil in DNA is frequently generated by the deamination of cytosine in a pH- and temperature-dependent manner (3Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, DC.1995Google Scholar, 24Kunkel T.A. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 93-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Uracil can pair with adenine without blocking DNA replication and therefore is very mutagenic. In fact, UDG-deficient E. coli shows a high frequency of spontaneous G:C to A:T transitions. However, the present study indicates that in transcription, pol II inserts guanine and adenine opposite uracil without blocking transcription elongation.E. coli RNA polymerase also can insert guanine and adenine opposite lesions in vitro (17Viswanathan A. Doetsch P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21276-21281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus, uracil in DNA would cause transcriptional infidelity and produce mutant proteins. In fact, it has been reported that the transcriptional bypass of uracil byE. coli RNA polymerase results in the production of mutant proteins in vivo (22Viswanathan A. You H.J. Doetsch P.W. Science. 1999; 284: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These results suggest that uracil has to be removed before pol II meets the lesion to avoid the production of a mutant protein. In mammalian cells, four types of uracil DNA glycosylase exist to remove uracil lesions (1Lindahl T. Wood R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). Although the exact role of each of these uracil DNA glycosylases in the cells is not known, it is likely that they remove uracil lesions on transcribed DNA and thus prevent transcriptional mutagenesis. 8-oxoG on the template strand of DNA directs the incorporation of non-cognate dAMP as well as dCMP through DNA replication leading to G:C to T:A transversions (14Shibutani S. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Nature. 1991; 349: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2047) Google Scholar, 15Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). It has been shown that CS cells are deficient in the TCR of oxidative damage such as 8-oxoG and thymine glycol as well as TCR in NER. Moreover, the frequency of G:C to T:A transversions at 8-oxoG in CS cells was 30–40%, while that in normal cells was 1–4%. The results indicate that the unrepaired 8-oxoG blocked transcription by pol II in CS/XP-G cells but not in normal cells (9Le Page F. Kwoh E.E. Avrutskaya A. Gentil A. Leadon S.A. Sarasin A. Cooper P.K. Cell. 2000; 101: 159-171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Their results are consistent with the present findings that pol II stalled at 8-oxoG on the transcribed strand in the in vitro transcription elongation assay using oligo(dC) template. In addition, some pol II stalled at 8-oxoG lesions upon inserting cytosine, while others could bypass the site by inserting cytosine. What mechanisms are involved in the preference for either stalling or bypassing? 8-oxoG forms base pairs with both cytosine and adenine, depending on whether the base adopts a syn or ananti conformation about the glycosidic bond (25Cooke M.S. Herbert K.E. Butler P.C. Lunec J. Free Radic. Res. 1998; 28: 28459-28469Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 26McAuley-Hecht K.E. Leonard G.A. Gibson N.J. Thomson J.B. Watson W.P. Hunter W.N. Brown T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10266-10270Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Thesyn conformations, which 8-oxoG favors, can pair with adenine, while the anti forms can pair with cytosine. It is speculated that when pol II inserts an adenine opposite thesyn conformation or cytosine opposite the antiform it might be able to bypass the lesion because of the expected base pairing. However, when pol II inserts a cytosine opposite an 8-oxoGsyn form, cytosine can not pair in the proper manner and pol II stalls at the lesion. Our results indicate that higher concentrations of adenine decreased the pausing, while higher concentrations of cytosine led to the stalling of pol II at the lesion, indicating that adenine can properly pair with 8-oxoG but cytosine can not (Fig. 4). These findings would support the idea that thesyn conformation of 8-oxoG lesions blocks pol II elongation. However, in regard to the blocking of pol II by 8-oxoG, we cannot rule out the possibility that additional factors may be required to ensure the stalling of pol II at 8-oxoG (27Tornaletti S. Maeda S. Lloyd D.R. Reines D. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45367-45371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we obtained mutant products of bypassed transcription from the 8-oxoG templates as well as the uracil templates. It has been reported that MutT-deficient strains of E. coli that lack the sanitization of 8-oxo-dGTP, produced such mutant proteins (28Taddei F. Hayakawa H. Bouton M. Cirinesi A. Matic I. Sekiguchi M. Radman M. Science. 1997; 278: 128-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 29Dukan S. Farewell A. Ballesteros M. Taddei F. Radman M. Nystrom T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5746-5749Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). These results suggest that mutant transcripts generated by bypass transcription produce mutant proteins. Since 8-oxoG is not repaired in CS cells, more mutant proteins might be produced in CS cells, which could contribute to the symptoms of CS. We thank Aya Yanagida for technical assistance."

Dozois C.M. Luirink J. Oudega B. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It represents the first described member of the serine protease autotransporters of Enterobacteriaceae (SPATE) group of autotransporter proteins (3Henderson I.R. Navarro-Garcia F. Nataro J.P. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 370-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The key feature of an autotransporter is that it contains all the information for secretion in the precursor of the secreted protein itself (3Henderson I.R. Navarro-Garcia F. Nataro J.P. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 370-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Autotransporters comprise three functional domains: 1) an N-terminal targeting domain; 2) a C-terminal translocation domain; and, in between these two, 3) the passenger domain that is the actual secreted moiety. The C-terminal domain is supposed to form a β-barrel structure in the outer membrane that may form an oligomeric channel around a cavity to allow the passage of the passenger domain (4Veiga E. Sugawara E. Nikaido H. de Lorenzo V. Fernandez L.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2122-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain is thought to function as a signal peptide to mediate targeting to and translocation across the inner membrane. Compared with other signal peptides in E. coli, the putative signal peptide of Hbp is unusually long (1Otto B.R. van Dooren S.J. Nuijens J.H. Luirink J. Oudega B. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1091-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Analogously, several other autotransporters are predicted to have long signal peptides (3Henderson I.R. Navarro-Garcia F. Nataro J.P. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 370-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 5Henderson I.R. Cappello R. Nataro J.P. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 529-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). All these signal peptides display a conserved domain structure. The C terminus resembles a normal signal peptide with a basic N-terminal region, a hydrophobic core region, and a C-terminal consensus signal peptidase cleavage site. The N terminus forms a conserved extension, the function of which is not known (Fig. 1). Most periplasmic and outer membrane proteins synthesized with a cleavable signal peptide are translocated through the Sec-translocon. The core translocase consists of the integral inner membrane proteins (IMPs) SecY, SecE, and SecG, which constitute an oligomeric complex homologous to the Sec61 channel complex in the endoplasmic reticulum (6Manting E.H. Driessen A.J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 226-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The peripheral membrane ATPase SecA is unique to bacteria and catalyzes the actual polypeptide transfer through the translocase. Targeting to the Sec-translocon may occur after translation and often requires the cytosolic chaperone SecB. The Sec-translocon is also used for the membrane insertion of most IMPs that are synthesized with uncleaved, relatively hydrophobic signal peptides (7de Gier J.W. Luirink J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Targeting of IMPs to the Sec-translocon is not mediated by SecB but by the signal recognition particle (SRP) and its receptor, FtsY, in a co-translational mechanism that resembles targeting to the Sec61 complex in the endoplasmic reticulum (8Herskovits A.A. Bochkareva E.S. Bibi E. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Here we provide evidence that the long signal peptide of Hbp mediates targeting to the inner membrane via the SRP pathway. When the SRP pathway is compromised, SecB can prevent, to a certain extent, the mislocalization of pre-pro-Hbp. Subsequent translocation across the inner membrane involves the Sec-translocon. This is the first demonstration of the use of the co-translational SRP pathway for inner membrane targeting of an extracellular protein.

All other chemicals were supplied by Sigma. Antiserum J40 raised against purified Hbp has been described previously (2Otto B.R. van Dooren S.J. Dozois C.M. Luirink J. Oudega B. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Antisera against β-lactamase, OmpA/OmpC, trigger factor (TF)/SecA, and SufI were gifts from J.-M. van Dijl, J.-W. de Gier, W. Wickner, and T. Palmer, respectively. For cross-linking of nascent Hbp, we constructed pC4MethssHbp, which encodes the 110 N-terminal amino acid residues of Hbp fused to a C-terminal 4× methionine tag and a three amino acid linker sequence to improve labeling efficiency. The construct was obtained by PCR using pHE12.6 as a template and the primers Hbp-EcoRI-for (5′-GCCGGAATTCTAATATGAACAGAATTTATTCTCTTC-3′ with theEcoRI restriction site in boldface) and Hbp-BamHI-rev (5′-GCGGGATCCACCGATTTCCGAATCCACA-3′ with the BamHI restriction site in boldface). The PCR fragment was cloned EcoRI/ BamHI into pC4Meth (10Valent Q.A. de Gier J.W.L. van Heijne G. Kendall D.A. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Oudega B. Luirink J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To construct plasmid pHB6.4-HbpΔss, the signal peptide coding region of hbp was removed from plasmid pHB6.4-Hbp using the Exsite PCR-based, site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The plasmid pHB6.4-Hbp is derived from pHE12.6 (1Otto B.R. van Dooren S.J. Nuijens J.H. Luirink J. Oudega B. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1091-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The primers used were Hbp-NheI-for (5′-CTTGCTAGCGTCAATA-ATGAACTCGGGTATC-3′ with theNheI restriction site in boldface) and Hbp-BglII-rev (5′-CTGATTTTATTTTTCTCAGGAGTAATTAAAAATGAAGAGATCTAAG-3′ with the BglII restriction site in boldface). Upon ligation of the linear DNA, the last three bases from each end constitute a HindIII restriction site. The resulting plasmid encodes the Hbp protein without its signal peptide but with six extra N-terminal amino acids (MKRSKL) and two altered amino acids (GT → AS) at the start of the mature Hbp region. Truncated mRNA was prepared as described previously (11Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) from HindIII linearized pC4MethssHbp.In vitro translation, targeting to inverted membrane vesicles (IMVs), cross-linking with DSS, and carbonate extraction of nascent Hbp were carried out as described (11Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The samples were either analyzed directly by 15% SDS-PAGE or immunoprecipitated first using 4-fold the amount used for direct analysis. For Ffh depletion studies, strains HDB51 and HDB52 were grown overnight in M9 containing 0.1% casaminoacids (Difco), 0.2% fructose, and 0.2%l-arabinose, washed in the same medium lackingl-arabinose, and diluted to an OD660 of 0.004 in M9 containing fructose (0.2%) and either l-arabinose (0.2%) or glucose (0.2%). Cells were grown to an OD660 of ∼0.3 before labeling. Depletion of Ffh was verified by Western blotting. The temperature-sensitive SecY mutant strains IQ85 and its isogenic wild type strain IQ86 were grown overnight at 30 °C in LB medium, diluted into fresh medium to an OD660 of 0.02, and grown to an OD660 of 0.3. Growth was then continued at 30 or 42 °C for 3 h. For overexpression of a dominant lethalftsY allele, strain BL21(DE3) harboring pET9-FtsY-A449 was grown overnight at 37 °C in M9 medium with 0.2% glycerol as a carbon source and diluted into fresh medium to an OD660 of 0.03. When cells reached an OD660 of 0.2, 40 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to induce FtsY-A449 expression, and growth was continued for 15 min. To inhibit SecA functioning in MC4100, 3 mmNaN3 was added 3 min prior to labeling. In all experiments, 2.4 OD660 units of cells were washed and diluted into 3 ml of M9 medium containing appropriate sugars and a mixture of 18 amino acids except methionine and cysteine. After recovery for 15–45 min at 30, 37, or 42 °C as indicated, cells were pulse labeled for 1 min by the addition of 10 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and chased for various times by adding cold methionine (2 mm). To stop the chase, cells were rapidly cooled in ice water and centrifuged at 4 °C for 2 min at 8,000 × g. Supernatants were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and subjected directly to 8–15% SDS-PAGE. Cell pellets were first lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-Hbp and anti-OmpA serum essentially as described (12Luirink J. High S. Wood H. Giner A. Tollervey D. Dobberstein B. Nature. 1992; 359: 741-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). For analysis of steady-state levels of Hbp, E. coli strains harboring an hbp expression plasmid were grown to an OD660 of 0.5. Aliquots were removed from the cultures and centrifuged (1 min at 16,000 ×g). The culture supernatants were trichloroacetic acid precipitated. Equivalent amounts of cells and supernatant were analyzed by Western blotting. Blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence using Lumi-light Western blotting substrate. Radiolabeled proteins were visualized by phosphorimaging using a Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager 473 and quantified using the ImageQuant quantification software fromAmersham Biosciences. Chemiluminescent Western blots were analyzed using the Fluor-S MultiImager and Multianalyst software (Bio-Rad). Hbp is synthesized in a pre-pro form (148 kDa) (1Otto B.R. van Dooren S.J. Nuijens J.H. Luirink J. Oudega B. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1091-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The N-terminal signal peptide is cleaved during passage of the pre-pro-Hbp through the inner membrane, leaving the pro-Hbp (142 kDa) in the periplasm. The C-terminal β-barrel domain is cleaved from the pro-Hbp at the outer membrane and mediates the transfer of the mature Hbp (111 kDa) into the culture medium. To analyze the role of the Hbp signal peptide, it was deleted from the pre-pro-Hbp, and the consequences for maturation and secretion were analyzed by Western blotting of cell samples and culture supernatants using Hbp-specific antibodies (Fig. 2 A). As expected, deletion of the signal peptide (Δss) prevented secretion of mature Hbp into the medium. Only a small amount of pro-HbpΔss was detected in the cells. In contrast, most wild-type pre-pro-Hbp was processed to mature Hbp, which was either secreted or remained cell-associated as observed previously (1Otto B.R. van Dooren S.J. Nuijens J.H. Luirink J. Oudega B. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1091-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition, some pre-pro- or pro-Hbp accumulated in the cells. We next investigated the reason for the low expression level of pro-HbpΔss. It has been observed previously that secreted proteins and IMPs that fail to be translocated across or inserted into the inner membrane are prone to proteolytic degradation (13Bernstein K.D. Hyndman J.B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 7: 2187-2197Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To investigate this possibility, HbpΔss was expressed in strain HDB107, which lacks the major cytoplasmic proteases Lon and ClpYQ (13Bernstein K.D. Hyndman J.B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 7: 2187-2197Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase labeling was employed to compare the stability of HbpΔss species in strain HDB107 and its isogenic parental strain HDB97 (Fig. 2 B). HbpΔss remained almost completely stable for at least 10 min in HDB107, whereas only limited amounts were detected in HDB97 after a 10-min chase. In fact, relatively little HbpΔss was detected in HDB97 even when samples were analyzed directly after pulse labeling. These data indicated that Hbp requires its signal peptide for targeting to the inner membrane and, consequently, for secretion of mature Hbp. Mislocalized pro-Hbp is rapidly degraded by the cytoplasmic proteases Lon and/or ClpYQ. To investigate the molecular interactions of the atypical Hbp signal peptide in the cytoplasm and the membrane, we used anin vitro cross-linking assay. A radiolabeled Hbp translation intermediate of 117 amino acid residues was generated by in vitro translation of truncated mRNA in a homologous cell-free translation system developed previously in our laboratory (11Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Because the truncated RNA does not contain a stop codon, the nascent chain remains associated with the ribosome, and the signal peptide is exposed outside the ribosome that covers ∼35 C-terminal amino acids. Translation was carried out in the presence of purified IMVs to allow targeting and membrane insertion. Subsequently, interactions of the nascent Hbp were fixed by using the membrane-permeable, lysine-specific cross-linking reagent DSS. Finally, the samples were extracted with sodium carbonate to separate membrane integrated from the soluble and peripheral membrane proteins. Approximately 30% of the synthesized nascent Hbp was detected in the carbonate pellet (Fig. 3, quantification data not shown). Given the relatively low intrinsic efficiency of theE. coli in vitro translocation system, this result indicated that nascent Hbp is properly targeted and inserted into the membrane and remains anchored via its signal peptide that is not cleaved at this nascent chain length. In the untargeted (carbonate soluble) fraction, a cross-linking product of ∼60 kDa appeared that could be immunoprecipitated using serum directed against Ffh, the protein component of the SRP (Fig. 3, lane 4). The molecular mass of this product is consistent with the combined molecular mass of Ffh (50 kDa) and the Hbp 117-mer (13 kDa). The cross-linking to Ffh is remarkably strong considering the low abundance of the SRP in the translation lysate, suggesting that it represents a functional interaction. Weaker cross-linking products of slightly higher molecular mass were immunoprecipitated using anti-TF serum (Fig. 3, lane 3). TF (54 kDa) cross-linked to nascent chains often migrates at varying positions (10Valent Q.A. de Gier J.W.L. van Heijne G. Kendall D.A. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Oudega B. Luirink J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The membrane-integrated nascent Hbp was primarily cross-linked to SecA (102kDa) (Fig. 3, lane 7). In addition, a very faint cross-linking smear was observed at ∼46 kDa that contained SecY, as evident from long exposures of immunoprecipitated samples (not shown). Together, the cross-link patterns are reminiscent of those found with the nascent IMPs FtsQ and leader peptidase I (Lep) (10Valent Q.A. de Gier J.W.L. van Heijne G. Kendall D.A. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Oudega B. Luirink J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 11Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 14Houben E.N.G. Scotti P.A. Valent Q.A. Brunner J. de Gier J.W.L. Oudega B. Luirink J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Both FtsQ and leader peptidase I are targeted by the SRP to the Sec-translocon (15Urbanus M.L. Scotti P.A. Froderberg L. Saaf A. de Gier J.W.L. Brunner J. Samuelson J.C. Dalbey R.E. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 6: 524-529Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 16de Gier J.W.L. Mansournia P. Valent Q.A. Phillips G.J. Luirink J. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 307-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Apparently, nascent Hbp can be targeted to the inner membrane and inserts close to the Sec-translocon. The unprecedented strong cross-linking to Ffh, considering the extremely low abundance of Ffh in the translation lysate, suggests a high affinity of the Hbp signal peptide for the SRP and, consequently, a role for the SRP in the targeting of Hbp. We investigated whether the interaction of nascent Hbp with the SRP observed in vitro reflects a dependence on the SRP targeting pathway for processing and secretion of the full-length protein in vivo. Strains that are conditional for the expression of targeting factors were used in pulse-chase experiments to analyze the effects on the kinetics of processing as described above. Furthermore, spent medium of the pulse-chase samples was analyzed to monitor the secretion of mature Hbp in time. Under normal conditions, N-terminal processing appeared to be very fast, and pre-pro-Hbp could only be detected in the pulsed sample (Fig. 4 A, lane 7) as has been observed for many pre-secretory proteins such as OmpA (see also Fig. 4 C, lane 4). However, C-terminal processing of Hbp is much slower. Under the expression conditions used, not all pro-Hbp was converted into mature Hbp even after 1 h of chase (Fig. 4 A, lane 12). The actual release of mature Hbp into the culture medium is even slower, appearing prominently only after 1 h of chase (Fig. 4 B, lane 12). Depletion of Ffh resulted in an accumulation of pre-pro-Hbp in the cells (Fig. 4 A, left panel). The amount of secreted mature Hbp after 60 min of chase, but not the kinetics of the secretion of mature Hbp, appeared affected upon depletion of Ffh (Fig. 4 B, left panel). As a control, the processing of OmpA was hardly influenced (Fig. 4 C, left panel), which is in agreement with its requirement for SecB rather than SRP for targeting (17Kumamoto C.A. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 267-274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In an alternative approach to analyzing the role of the SRP-targeting pathway in Hbp secretion, the effect of overexpression of FtsY-A449 was investigated. This mutant SRP receptor has a reduced GTP-binding capacity as a result of an amino acid substitution in the fourth GTP-binding consensus element (18Kusters R. Lentzen G. Eppens E. van Geel A. van der Weijden C.C. Wintermeyer W. Luirink J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Moderate overexpression of FtsY-A449 has been shown to compromise SRP-mediated protein targeting (18Kusters R. Lentzen G. Eppens E. van Geel A. van der Weijden C.C. Wintermeyer W. Luirink J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Hbp processing and, consequently, also secretion appeared to be impaired upon moderate overexpression of FtsY-A449 as opposed to the non-induced expression level (Fig. 4, Dand E). OmpA processing was not affected under these conditions (Fig. 4 F). To examine whether the other major targeting factor, SecB, is also involved in Hbp targeting, Hbp was expressed in strain MM152, which lacks SecB, and in its isogenic wild-type strain, MC4100. Pre-pro-Hbp did not accumulate in the SecB minus strain, nor was the secretion of mature Hbp affected (Fig. 4, G and H). As a control, pre-OmpA accumulated at early chase times in strain MM152. Apparently, SecB is not necessary for efficient targeting of Hbpper se. We next considered the possibility that the residual processing and secretion of Hbp under Ffh-deficient conditions is due to alternative targeting via SecB. Consistent with this explanation, the expression of Hbp in a double mutant strain (SecB knockout, Ffh conditional) showed a much stronger secretion phenotype upon Ffh depletion than the single (Ffh conditional) mutant (Fig. 4, J and K,left panels). The secretion defect was greatly reduced in cells that express Ffh (Fig. 4, J andK, right panels), again suggesting that SecB is not required for the targeting of Hbp under normal conditions. The accumulation of pre-pro Hbp under these conditions at early chase times remains unexplained but may be related to adverse effects of the unnatural control of Ffh expression from the arabinose promoter. Interestingly, a similar but opposite additive effect is observed for OmpA. When the preferred targeting factor, SecB, is absent, processing is impaired (Fig. 4 L, right panel). Additional depletion of Ffh completely blocks residual OmpA processing (Fig. 4 L, left panel). Together, these results suggested that Hbp requires the SRP pathway for optimal targeting to the inner membrane. Although SecB is not essential for targeting per se, it can apparently compensate to a certain extent for depletion of the SRP. Two main types of translocons mediate the transfer of proteins across the inner membrane, namely the Sec-translocon (6Manting E.H. Driessen A.J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 226-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and the Tat-translocon (19Berks B.C. Sargent F. Palmer T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 260-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). We investigated the role of these translocons in the secretion of Hbp in vivo using the pulse-chase approach described above. A temperature-dependent conditional secY mutant strain was used to deplete the cells for functional Sec-translocons. At the non-permissive temperature, processing of the control Sec substrate OmpA was severely impaired in this strain as compared with its parental wild-type strain (Fig. 5 C). Likewise, pre-pro-Hbp accumulated in the secY Ts cells (Fig. 5 A, left panel), indicating that translocation of Hbp across the inner membrane proceeds through the Sec-translocon. To study the role of SecA, its ATPase activity was perturbed with azide. Under the conditions used, processing of OmpA was almost completely inhibited (Fig. 5 F, left panel). Again, pre-pro-Hbp accumulated in the cells, indicating that translocation of Hbp is dependent on SecA (Fig. 5 A, left panel). A similar dependence on functional SecA was observed when a temperature-dependent conditional secA mutant strain was used (data not shown). The Tat-translocon is used by a subset of preproteins that are folded prior to translocation (19Berks B.C. Sargent F. Palmer T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 260-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Tat substrates carry an essential twin arginine motif in their signal peptide just upstream of the hydrophobic domain. Although the Hbp signal peptide does not fully comply with this motif, it does contain two consecutive arginine residues upstream of the hydrophobic core region. This feature prompted us to investigate a possible role of the Tat-translocon using a strain that lacks TatA and TatE, rendering it completely unable to translocate Tat substrates. This double mutant strain showed normal kinetics of processing and secretion of Hbp whereas processing of the known Tat substrate SufI was completely blocked, arguing that the Tat-translocon is not involved in secretion of Hbp (data not shown). Together, the data suggest that Hbp uses the Sec-translocon for transfer across the inner membrane consistent with the in vitro cross-link data (Fig. 3). SecA appears to be required to drive the translocation process. In the present work, we have addressed the question how the autotransporter Hbp is targeted to and translocated across the inner membrane. Both in vitro cross-linking and in vivopulse-chase labeling experiments point to the use of a co-translational targeting and translocation mechanism involving the targeting factor SRP and the Sec translocation machinery. This is the first example of an extracellular protein that can be targeted by the SRP. Interestingly, in the absence of a functional SRP pathway, part of the mistargeted Hbp is rescued by SecB, underscoring the inherent flexibility of protein targeting in E. coli (20Kim J. Rusch S. Luirink J. Kendall D.A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 2: 245-248Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). What are the features in the Hbp signal peptide that determine SRP binding? Previous work in our group has demonstrated that the SRP preferentially interacts with relatively hydrophobic signal peptides such as those that are present in IMPs (10Valent Q.A. de Gier J.W.L. van Heijne G. Kendall D.A. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Oudega B. Luirink J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, the hydrophobic core region at the C terminus of the Hbp signal peptide is not particularly hydrophobic. Interestingly, the Hbp signal peptide is relatively long (52 amino acids) and appears to contain an N-terminal extension that precedes a “classical” signal peptide (Fig. 1). It is attractive to speculate that the N-terminal extension plays a role in the recognition by the SRP either directly or indirectly by presenting the hydrophobic core in a favorable conformation or by recruiting other factors that increase the affinity of the Hbp signal peptide for the SRP. It is worth mentioning that the only other known example of a secreted protein that makes use of the SRP for targeting, SecM, is also synthesized with a long signal peptide that comprises an N-terminal extension and a moderately hydrophobic core region (21Sarker S. Rudd K.E. Oliver D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5592-5595Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). SecM is a regulatory protein that functions in the secretion-responsive control of SecA expression. In wild-type cells, SecM is translocated to the periplasm where it is rapidly degraded (22Nakatogawa H. Ito K. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 185-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the N-region (KCVHKSVRR) between the hydrophobic core and the N-terminal extension might be important for SRP recognition of the Hbp signal peptide. Compared with other signal peptides in Gram-negative bacteria, this region is more basic. Interestingly, the crystal structure of the SRP has revealed an unusual RNA-protein interface that is thought to constitute the signal peptide binding groove (23Batey R.T. Rambo R.P. Lucast L. Rha B. Doudna J.A. Science. 2000; 287: 1232-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the protein moiety of the interface interacts with the hydrophobic core of the signal peptide, whereas the RNA is responsible for recognizing the basic N-domain. Following this reasoning, a more basic N-domain might compensate for a less hydrophobic core region in SRP binding. These possibilities are currently being investigated. Translocation of autotransporters across the inner membrane has been proposed to involve the N-terminal signal peptide and occur via the Sec-pathway, which is also used by periplasmic and outer membrane proteins (3Henderson I.R. Navarro-Garcia F. Nataro J.P. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 370-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Consistent with this proposal, our data suggest that the Sec-translocon receives and translocates the nascent Hbp. In this respect, Hbp resembles IMPs like leader peptidase I, FtsQ, and MtlA (7de Gier J.W. Luirink J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). An accessory translocon component, YidC, is specifically involved in membrane integration of these IMPs but not in the translocation of secretory proteins (11Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 24Samuelson J.C. Chen M.Y. Jiang F.L. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). 2E. N. G. Houben, personal communication. We have not observed any cross-linking of nascent Hbp with YidC. Moreover, depletion of YidC did not affect processing and secretion of Hbp (data not shown). Apparently, YidC is dispensable for the reception of Hbp at, as well as the translocation of Hbp across, the inner membrane-embedded Sec-translocon. It is not unlikely that other members of the autotransporter family follow the same pathway of targeting and translocation across the bacterial inner membrane. Many autotransporters carry signal peptides of similar length and domain structure (3Henderson I.R. Navarro-Garcia F. Nataro J.P. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 370-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The N-terminal extension in these signal peptides is remarkably conserved, as is the basic character of the N-domain. In addition, substrates of an analogous secretion system, the “two-partner secretion” (TPS) pathway in which the β-barrel domain is present in a separate protein, also possess signal peptides that are conserved with members of the classical autotransporter family (5Henderson I.R. Cappello R. Nataro J.P. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 529-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). One of these substrates, the HMW1 adhesin from Haemophilus influenzae that carries a 68 amino acid-long signal peptide was shown to require SecA and SecE for maturation and secretion (25Grass S. St. Geme III, J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). What would be the benefit of co-translational translocation for autotransporters? For Hbp, it might prevent degradation or premature folding of Hbp in the cytoplasm. Hbp that lacks its signal peptide appeared to be vulnerable to degradation by cytoplasmic proteases. It should be noted that both the autotransporter and two-partner secretion families comprise many virulence factors such as hemagglutinins, hemolysins, cytolysins, and proteases (5Henderson I.R. Cappello R. Nataro J.P. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 529-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) that may be harmful when expressed in the cytoplasm of the pathogenic bacterium. Furthermore, the autotransporters are relatively large molecules with a typical domain structure. The passenger domain that is expressed in the cytoplasm may fold into a conformation that is incompatible with translocation through the Sec-translocon, even when the β-barrel domain is still being synthesized."
https://openalex.org/W2062892135,"Glycine betaine (N,N,N-trimethylglycine) is an important osmoprotectant and is synthesized in response to abiotic stresses. Although almost all known biosynthetic pathways of betaine are two-step oxidation of choline, here we isolated twoN-methyltransferase genes from a halotolerant cyanobacterium Aphanothece halophytica. One of gene products (ORF1) catalyzed the methylation reactions of glycine and sarcosine with S-adenosylmethionine acting as the methyl donor. The other one (ORF2) specifically catalyzed the methylation of dimethylglycine to betaine. Both enzymes are active as monomers. Betaine, a final product, did not show the feed back inhibition for the methyltransferases even in the presence of 2 m. A reaction product, S-adenosyl homocysteine, inhibited the methylation reactions with relatively low affinities. The co-expressing of two enzymes in Escherichia coli increased the betaine level and enhanced the growth rates. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the accumulation levels of both enzymes in A. halophytica cells increased with increasing the salinity. These results indicate thatA. halophytica cells synthesize betaine from glycine by a three-step methylation. The changes of amino acids Arg-169 to Lys or Glu in ORF1 and Pro-171 to Gln and/or Met-172 to Arg in ORF2 significantly decreased V max and increasedK m for methyl acceptors (glycine, sarcosine, and dimethylglycine) but modestly affected K m forS-adenosylmethionine, indicating the importance of these amino acids for the binding of methyl acceptors. Physiological and functional properties of methyltransferases were discussed. Glycine betaine (N,N,N-trimethylglycine) is an important osmoprotectant and is synthesized in response to abiotic stresses. Although almost all known biosynthetic pathways of betaine are two-step oxidation of choline, here we isolated twoN-methyltransferase genes from a halotolerant cyanobacterium Aphanothece halophytica. One of gene products (ORF1) catalyzed the methylation reactions of glycine and sarcosine with S-adenosylmethionine acting as the methyl donor. The other one (ORF2) specifically catalyzed the methylation of dimethylglycine to betaine. Both enzymes are active as monomers. Betaine, a final product, did not show the feed back inhibition for the methyltransferases even in the presence of 2 m. A reaction product, S-adenosyl homocysteine, inhibited the methylation reactions with relatively low affinities. The co-expressing of two enzymes in Escherichia coli increased the betaine level and enhanced the growth rates. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the accumulation levels of both enzymes in A. halophytica cells increased with increasing the salinity.

Physiological and functional properties of methyltransferases were discussed. The most known biosynthetic pathways of betaine are the two-step oxidation of choline. Many bacteria, plants, and animals accumulate glycine betaine (here after betaine) under abiotic stress conditions (1Rhodes D. Hanson A.D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Mol.

In these organisms, it was shown that betaine is synthesized by two steps, choline → betaine aldehyde → glycine betaine. The enzyme involved in the second step seems to be the same in plants, animals, and bacteria, namely NAD+-dependent betaine-aldehyde dehydrogenase (4Weretilnyk E.A. Hanson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In plants, it was catalyzed by a novel Rieske-type iron-sulfur enzyme choline monooxygenase (7Burnet M. Lafontaine P.J. Hanson A.D.

In animals and many bacteria, the first step is catalyzed by membrane-bound choline dehydrogenase or soluble choline oxidase (9Lamark T. Kaasen I. Eshoo M.W. McDougall J. Strom A.R. Mol.

Yang D.-R. Chuang M.-J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 828-833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and anaerobic phototrophic sulfur bacterium Ectothiorhodospira halochloris (13Galinski E.A. Trüper H.G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 15: 95-108Crossref Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Betaine synthesis from simple carbon sources has also been suggested in aerobic heterotrophic eubacteriumActinopolyspora halophila (13Galinski E.A. Trüper H.G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 15: 95-108Crossref Scopus (336) Google Scholar) and halotolerant cyanobacterium of Aphanothece halophytica (14Reed R.H. Borowitzka L.J. Mackay M.A. Chudek J.A. Foster R. Warr S.R.C. Moore D.J. Stewart W.D.P. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 39: 51-56Crossref Google Scholar). Recently, the methyltransferase genes that are involved in betaine synthesis have been isolated from E. halochloris andA. halophila (15Nyyssola A. Kerovuo J. Kaukinen P. von Weymarrn N. Reinikainen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22196-22201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Two methyltransferase genes were involved in E. halochloris. One of gene products catalyzed the methylation reactions of glycine and sarcosine to sarcosine and dimethylglycine, respectively (EcGSMT), 1The abbreviations used are: EcGSMT, E. halochloris glycine sarcosine methyltransferase; EcSDMT, E. halochloris sarcosine dimethylglycine methyltransferase; GMT, glycine N-methyltransferase; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; AdoHcy, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine; ApDMT, A. halophytica dimethylglycine methyltransferase; ApGSMT, A. halophytica glycine sarcosine methyltransferase; EA, ethanolamine; Ptd, phosphatidyl; Ptd-EA, phosphatidylethanolamine 1The abbreviations used are: EcGSMT, E. halochloris glycine sarcosine methyltransferase; EcSDMT, E. halochloris sarcosine dimethylglycine methyltransferase; GMT, glycine N-methyltransferase; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; AdoHcy, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine; ApDMT, A. halophytica dimethylglycine methyltransferase; ApGSMT, A. halophytica glycine sarcosine methyltransferase; EA, ethanolamine; Ptd, phosphatidyl; Ptd-EA, phosphatidylethanolamine whereas the other one catalyzed the methylations of sarcosine and dimethylglycine to dimethylglycine and betaine, respectively (EcSDMT) (15Nyyssola A.

Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 2044-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). By contrast, one ORF was found in A. halophila of which the N- and C-terminal parts had homologous sequences to those of EcGSMT and EcSDMT, respectively (15Nyyssola A. Kerovuo J. Kaukinen P. von Weymarrn N. Reinikainen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22196-22201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The functionality of A. halophila methyltransferase was not well shown due to the formation of cell pellet when expressed in Escherichia coli.Glycine N-methyltransferase (GMT) catalyzing the methylation of glycine to sarcosine is known in mammalian cells although the enzymes catalyzing the further methylation steps do not occur (17Huang Y. Komoto J. Konishi K. Takata Y. Ogawa H. Gomi T. Fujioka M. Takusagawa F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18Ogawa H. Gomi T. Takusagawa F. Fujioka M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The homology of amino acid sequences between mammalian GMT and EcGSMT was low. No homologous sequences to those of EcGSMT, EcSDMT, andA. halophila methyltransferase could be found. Therefore, it was interesting to examine whether betaine is synthesized from glycine by three-step methylation reactions in other organisms.A. halophytica is an oxygen-evolving halotolerant cyanobacterium that can grow in a wide range of salinity conditions from 0.25 to 3.0 m NaCl concomitant with the accumulation of betaine (14Reed R.H. Borowitzka L.J. Mackay M.A. Chudek J.A. Foster R. Warr S.R.C. Moore D.J. Stewart W.D.P. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 39: 51-56Crossref Google Scholar, 20Incharoensakdi A. Takabe T. Akazawa T. Plant Physiol. 1986; 81: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that A. halophytica has unique systems to survive under severe environmental conditions (20Incharoensakdi A. Takabe T. Akazawa T.

Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase of A. halophytica dissociates easily into large and small subunits when betaine was absent (20Incharoensakdi A. Takabe T. Akazawa T. Plant Physiol. 1986; 81: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A. halophytica DnaK has been shown to contain the longer C-terminal segment than other DnaK/Hsp70 family members (21Lee B.H. Hibino T. Jo J. Viale A.M. Takabe T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 763-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and exhibit extremely high protein folding activity at high salinity (22Hibino T. Kaku N. Yoshikawa H. Takabe T. Takabe T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It was also shown that A. halophytica Na+/H+antiporter has novel ion specificity (23Waditee R. Hibino T. Tanaka Y. Nakamura T. Incharoensakdi A. Takabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36931-36938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and could confer the tolerance for salt stress of fresh water cyanobacterium capable of growing in sea water (24Waditee R. Hibino T. Nakamura T. Incharoensakdi A. Takabe T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4109-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Here, we show that in contrast to other oxygen-evolving photosynthetic organisms, A. halophyticasynthesizes betaine from glycine by a three-step methylation. Two novel methyltransferase genes were isolated, and their functional properties were examined. From the mutagenesis approach, the information on the substrate binding sites in both enzymes was obtained.DISCUSSIONPresent results clearly indicate that in contrast to other oxygen-evolving photosynthetic organisms, betaine is synthesized from glycine by a three-step methylation in a halotolerant cyanobacteriumA. halophytica. This conclusion was supported by several experimental evidences. Isolated genes exhibited homology to recently discovered glycine methyltransferase genes (Fig. 1) (15Nyyssola A. Kerovuo J. Kaukinen P. von Weymarrn N. Reinikainen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22196-22201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 16Nyyssola A. Reinikainen T. Leisola M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 2044-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The purified enzymes catalyzed the methyl transfer reactions to glycine, sarcosine, and dimethylglycine (Fig. 3). The methyl transfer activities of glycine, sarcosine, and dimethylglycine were detected in A. halophytica but not in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942, a betaine non-accumulating cyanobacterium (Fig. 7 A). The accumulation levels of ApGSMT and ApDMT in A. halophyticacells increased upon the increase of salinity (Fig. 7 B). Co-expression of ApGSMT and ApDMT in E. coli cells increased the accumulation levels of betaine (Fig. 8).Two methyltransferase genes, encoding ApGSMT and ApDMT, were isolated from A. halophytica (Fig. 1). ApGSMT catalyzed the methylation reactions of glycine and sarcosine, whereas ApDMT specifically catalyzed the methylation reaction of dimethylglycine (Fig. 3). Homologous sequences to ApGSMT and ApDMT were only found inE. halochloris and A. halophila. A. halophyticamethyltransferases were different from that of A. halophilain which one gene was found (15Nyyssola A. Kerovuo J. Kaukinen P. von Weymarrn N. Reinikainen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22196-22201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). ApGSMT and ApDMT of A. halophytica were similar to EcGSMT and EcSDMT of E. halochloris, respectively, but substrate specificity of ApDMT was different from EcSDMT (Fig. 3).Similar to betaine (trimethylglycine), choline is a trimethyl compound of ethanolamine (EA), and synthesized from EA via free-base, phospho-base, and phosphatidyl (Ptd)-base, depending on the species (1Rhodes D. Hanson A.D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 357-384Crossref Scopus (1050) Google Scholar,27Nuccio M.L. Ziemak M.J. Henry S.A. Weretilnyk E.A. Hanson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14095-14101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Several N-methyltransferases are involved in choline biogenesis. For instance, three-step methylation reactions of phosphatidylethanolamine (Ptd-EA), Ptd-monomethyl-EA, and Ptd-dimethyl-EA have been catalyzed by a single Ptd-EAN-methyltransferase in the cases of Rhodobacter sphaeroides and liver (30Vance D.E. Walkey C.J. Cui Z. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 31Arondel V. Benning C. Somerville C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16002-16008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in yeast, these reactions are catalyzed by two enzymes, one mediating the first methylation of Ptd-EA and another mediating the last two (32Kanipes M.I. Henry S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the phospho-base pathway, presence of three separate N-methyltransferases has been reported in nerve tissues (33Mukherjee S. Freysz L. Kanfer J.N. Neurochem. Res. 1995; 20: 1233-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), whereas in plants, three-step methylation reactions were catalyzed by a single enzyme comprising two similar tandem methyltransferase domains (27Nuccio M.L. Ziemak M.J. Henry S.A. Weretilnyk E.A. Hanson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14095-14101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, the biogenesis ofN-trimethyl compounds occurs via diversity methyltransferases. Despite of diversity methyltransferases, betaine synthesis from glycine was only observed in halotolerant organisms (15Nyyssola A. Kerovuo J. Kaukinen P. von Weymarrn N. Reinikainen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22196-22201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This suggests that the methyltransferase genes, encoding ApGSMT and ApDMT, in A. halophytica might evolve independently from those of methyltransferases in choline biogenesis and mammalian glycineN-methyltransferase.Fig. 4 shows that acetate inhibited the methyl transfers to glycine and sarcosine. The inhibition of glycine methylation by acetate in mammalian GMTs has been reported (17Huang Y. Komoto J. Konishi K. Takata Y. Ogawa H. Gomi T. Fujioka M. Takusagawa F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18Ogawa H. Gomi T. Takusagawa F. Fujioka M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These results suggest some similarity of methyl acceptor domain between ApGSMT and mammalian GMT although mammalian GMTs could not catalyze the methyl transfer to sarcosine. Mammalian GMTs are tetrameric enzyme (17Huang Y. Komoto J. Konishi K. Takata Y. Ogawa H. Gomi T. Fujioka M. Takusagawa F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18Ogawa H. Gomi T. Takusagawa F. Fujioka M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), whereas ApGSMT was monomer. It has also been reported that rat GMT plays another function such as a major folate-binding protein (34Cook R.J. Wagner C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3631-3634Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Despite these functional differences between ApGSMT and mammalian GMTs, it was found that the amino acid sequence after AdoMet binding motif III was relatively conserved between them (Fig. 9). Especially Arg-176 in rat GMT, the putative glycine binding site in rat GMT, was conserved. The chemical modification of Arg by phenylglyoxal and site-directed mutagenesis experiments (Fig. 9) showed that the Arg-169 in ApGSMT plays an important role for binding of glycine and sarcosine but not of AdoMet.ApDMT is an unique enzyme. Its substrate specificity was different from that of EcSDMT (Fig. 3). The amino acid sequence after AdoMet binding motif III in ApDMT did not show the homology to that of mammalian GMTs. Site-directed mutagenesis of Pro-170 and Met-171 showed that these amino acids play important role for binding of dimethylglycine, but not of glycine or sarcosine. The results of Figs. 9 and 10 suggest that the amino acid sequence just after AdoMet binding motif III might play important role for binding of methyl acceptor group in small moleculeN-methyltransferases, which remains to be tested experimentally.AdoHcy is a potent inhibitor in almost all AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases. For the continuous synthesis of betaine, AdoHcy must be removed by AdoHcy-hydrolase, which catalyzes both synthesis and hydrolysis reactions. The results of Fig. 5 A show that in contrast to most other AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases, the activities of ApGSMT and ApDMT were inhibited by AdoHcy with relatively low affinities. The K i values of ApGSMT and ApDMT were about 10-fold higher than that of rat GMT and 1000-fold higher than that of tRNA methyltransferase (Fig. 5 A). Allowance of relatively high concentrations of AdoHcy during the betaine synthesis could shift the equilibrium to the hydrolysis direction that would be suitable for the synthesis of large amount of betaine.Fig. 5 B shows that one of final product, betaine, did not inhibit the methyl transfer activities of ApGSMT and ApDMT. This property is also suitable for the synthesis of high concentrations of betaine. The results of Fig. 4 indicate that acetate and dimethylglycine are inhibitors for ApGSMT whereas n-butylic acid was an inhibitor for ApDMT. Any examined amino acids except glycine, ethanolamines derivatives, and several acids did not affect the methyl transfer activities. These facts suggest that betaine synthesis could occur relatively without interference of metabolites.Hitherto, extensive studies have been carried out for genetic engineering of betaine accumulation (35Rontein D. Basset G. Hanson A.D. Metab. Eng. 2002; 4: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 36Chen T.H. Murata N. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 250-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). All of them used the genes encoding choline-oxidizing enzymes such as choline monooxygenase, choline dehydrogenase, choline oxidase, and betaine-aldehyde dehydrogenase. However, the produced betaine levels were generally low. Several factors limiting the betaine levels are considered. Supply of choline, transport of choline to the place choline oxidizing enzyme localized, and increase of choline-oxidizing enzyme levels might be important to improve the abiotic tolerance of plants. The data of Fig. 8 show that ApGSMT and ApDMT could produce large amount of betaine inE. coli. Therefore, overexpression of ApGSMT and ApDMT in photosynthetic organisms are interesting subjects to be tested, which is in progress in this laboratory. The most known biosynthetic pathways of betaine are the two-step oxidation of choline. Many bacteria, plants, and animals accumulate glycine betaine (here after betaine) under abiotic stress conditions (1Rhodes D. Hanson A.D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 357-384Crossref Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 2Kempf B. Bremer E. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 170: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 3Takabe T. Nakamura T. Nomura M.

One of gene products catalyzed the methylation reactions of glycine and sarcosine to sarcosine and dimethylglycine, respectively (EcGSMT), 1The abbreviations used are: EcGSMT, E. halochloris glycine sarcosine methyltransferase; EcSDMT, E. halochloris sarcosine dimethylglycine methyltransferase; GMT, glycine N-methyltransferase; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; AdoHcy, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine; ApDMT, A. halophytica dimethylglycine methyltransferase; ApGSMT, A. halophytica glycine sarcosine methyltransferase; EA, ethanolamine; Ptd, phosphatidyl; Ptd-EA, phosphatidylethanolamine 1The abbreviations used are: EcGSMT, E. halochloris glycine sarcosine methyltransferase; EcSDMT, E. halochloris sarcosine dimethylglycine methyltransferase; GMT, glycine N-methyltransferase; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; AdoHcy, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine; ApDMT, A. halophytica dimethylglycine methyltransferase; ApGSMT, A. halophytica glycine sarcosine methyltransferase; EA, ethanolamine; Ptd, phosphatidyl; Ptd-EA, phosphatidylethanolamine whereas the other one catalyzed the methylations of sarcosine and dimethylglycine to dimethylglycine and betaine, respectively (EcSDMT) (15Nyyssola A.

Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 2044-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). By contrast, one ORF was found in A. halophila of which the N- and C-terminal parts had homologous sequences to those of EcGSMT and EcSDMT, respectively (15Nyyssola A. Kerovuo J. Kaukinen P. von Weymarrn N. Reinikainen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22196-22201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The functionality of A. halophila methyltransferase was not well shown due to the formation of cell pellet when expressed in Escherichia coli. Glycine N-methyltransferase (GMT) catalyzing the methylation of glycine to sarcosine is known in mammalian cells although the enzymes catalyzing the further methylation steps do not occur (17Huang Y. Komoto J. Konishi K. Takata Y. Ogawa H. Gomi T. Fujioka M. Takusagawa F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18Ogawa H. Gomi T. Takusagawa F. Fujioka M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The homology of amino acid sequences between mammalian GMT and EcGSMT was low. No homologous sequences to those of EcGSMT, EcSDMT, andA. halophila methyltransferase could be found. Therefore, it was interesting to examine whether betaine is synthesized from glycine by three-step methylation reactions in other organisms. A. halophytica is an oxygen-evolving halotolerant cyanobacterium that can grow in a wide range of salinity conditions from 0.25 to 3.0 m NaCl concomitant with the accumulation of betaine (14Reed R.H. Borowitzka L.J. Mackay M.A. Chudek J.A. Foster R. Warr S.R.C. Moore D.J. Stewart W.D.P. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 39: 51-56Crossref Google Scholar, 20Incharoensakdi A. Takabe T. Akazawa T. Plant Physiol. 1986; 81: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that A. halophytica has unique systems to survive under severe environmental conditions (20Incharoensakdi A. Takabe T. Akazawa T. Plant Physiol. 1986; 81: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lee B.H. Hibino T. Jo J. Viale A.M. Takabe T. Plant Mol.

Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase of A. halophytica dissociates easily into large and small subunits when betaine was absent (20Incharoensakdi A. Takabe T. Akazawa T. Plant Physiol. 1986; 81: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A. halophytica DnaK has been shown to contain the longer C-terminal segment than other DnaK/Hsp70 family members (21Lee B.H. Hibino T. Jo J. Viale A.M. Takabe T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 763-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and exhibit extremely high protein folding activity at high salinity (22Hibino T. Kaku N. Yoshikawa H. Takabe T. Takabe T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It was also shown that A. halophytica Na+/H+antiporter has novel ion specificity (23Waditee R. Hibino T. Tanaka Y. Nakamura T. Incharoensakdi A. Takabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36931-36938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and could confer the tolerance for salt stress of fresh water cyanobacterium capable of growing in sea water (24Waditee R. Hibino T. Nakamura T. Incharoensakdi A. Takabe T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4109-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Here, we show that in contrast to other oxygen-evolving photosynthetic organisms, A. halophyticasynthesizes betaine from glycine by a three-step methylation. Two novel methyltransferase genes were isolated, and their functional properties were examined. From the mutagenesis approach, the information on the substrate binding sites in both enzymes was obtained. DISCUSSIONPresent results clearly indicate that in contrast to other oxygen-evolving photosynthetic organisms, betaine is synthesized from glycine by a three-step methylation in a halotolerant cyanobacteriumA. halophytica. This conclusion was supported by several experimental evidences. Isolated genes exhibited homology to recently discovered glycine methyltransferase genes (Fig. 1) (15Nyyssola A. Kerovuo J. Kaukinen P. von Weymarrn N. Reinikainen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22196-22201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 16Nyyssola A. Reinikainen T. Leisola M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 2044-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The purified enzymes catalyzed the methyl transfer reactions to glycine, sarcosine, and dimethylglycine (Fig. 3). The methyl transfer activities of glycine, sarcosine, and dimethylglycine were detected in A. halophytica but not in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942, a betaine non-accumulating cyanobacterium (Fig. 7 A). The accumulation levels of ApGSMT and ApDMT in A. halophyticacells increased upon the increase of salinity (Fig. 7 B). Co-expression of ApGSMT and ApDMT in E. coli cells increased the accumulation levels of betaine (Fig. 8).Two methyltransferase genes, encoding ApGSMT and ApDMT, were isolated from A. halophytica (Fig. 1). ApGSMT catalyzed the methylation reactions of glycine and sarcosine, whereas ApDMT specifically catalyzed the methylation reaction of dimethylglycine (Fig. 3). Homologous sequences to ApGSMT and ApDMT were only found inE. halochloris and A. halophila. A. halophyticamethyltransferases were different from that of A. halophilain which one gene was found (15Nyyssola A. Kerovuo J. Kaukinen P. von Weymarrn N. Reinikainen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22196-22201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). ApGSMT and ApDMT of A. halophytica were similar to EcGSMT and EcSDMT of E. halochloris, respectively, but substrate specificity of ApDMT was different from EcSDMT (Fig. 3).Similar to betaine (trimethylglycine), choline is a trimethyl compound of ethanolamine (EA), and synthesized from EA via free-base, phospho-base, and phosphatidyl (Ptd)-base, depending on the species (1Rhodes D. Hanson A.D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 357-384Crossref Scopus (1050) Google Scholar,27Nuccio M.L. Ziemak M.J. Henry S.A. Weretilnyk E.A. Hanson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14095-14101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Several N-methyltransferases are involved in choline biogenesis. For instance, three-step methylation reactions of phosphatidylethanolamine (Ptd-EA), Ptd-monomethyl-EA, and Ptd-dimethyl-EA have been catalyzed by a single Ptd-EAN-methyltransferase in the cases of Rhodobacter sphaeroides and liver (30Vance D.E. Walkey C.J. Cui Z. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 31Arondel V. Benning C. Somerville C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16002-16008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in yeast, these reactions are catalyzed by two enzymes, one mediating the first methylation of Ptd-EA and another mediating the last two (32Kanipes M.I. Henry S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the phospho-base pathway, presence of three separate N-methyltransferases has been reported in nerve tissues (33Mukherjee S. Freysz L. Kanfer J.N. Neurochem. Res. 1995; 20: 1233-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), whereas in plants, three-step methylation reactions were catalyzed by a single enzyme comprising two similar tandem methyltransferase domains (27Nuccio M.L. Ziemak M.J. Henry S.A. Weretilnyk E.A. Hanson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14095-14101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, the biogenesis ofN-trimethyl compounds occurs via diversity methyltransferases. Despite of diversity methyltransferases, betaine synthesis from glycine was only observed in halotolerant organisms (15Nyyssola A. Kerovuo J. Kaukinen P. von Weymarrn N. Reinikainen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22196-22201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This suggests that the methyltransferase genes, encoding ApGSMT and ApDMT, in A. halophytica might evolve independently from those of methyltransferases in choline biogenesis and mammalian glycineN-methyltransferase.Fig. 4 shows that acetate inhibited the methyl transfers to glycine and sarcosine. The inhibition of glycine methylation by acetate in mammalian GMTs has been reported (17Huang Y. Komoto J. Konishi K. Takata Y. Ogawa H. Gomi T. Fujioka M. Takusagawa F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18Ogawa H. Gomi T. Takusagawa F. Fujioka M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These results suggest some similarity of methyl acceptor domain between ApGSMT and mammalian GMT although mammalian GMTs could not catalyze the methyl transfer to sarcosine. Mammalian GMTs are tetrameric enzyme (17Huang Y. Komoto J. Konishi K. Takata Y. Ogawa H. Gomi T. Fujioka M. Takusagawa F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18Ogawa H. Gomi T. Takusagawa F. Fujioka M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), whereas ApGSMT was monomer. It has also been reported that rat GMT plays another function such as a major folate-binding protein (34Cook R.J. Wagner C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3631-3634Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Despite these functional differences between ApGSMT and mammalian GMTs, it was found that the amino acid sequence after AdoMet binding motif III was relatively conserved between them (Fig. 9). Especially Arg-176 in rat GMT, the putative glycine binding site in rat GMT, was conserved. The chemical modification of Arg by phenylglyoxal and site-directed mutagenesis experiments (Fig. 9) showed that the Arg-169 in ApGSMT plays an important role for binding of glycine and sarcosine but not of AdoMet.ApDMT is an unique enzyme. Its substrate specificity was different from that of EcSDMT (Fig. 3). The amino acid sequence after AdoMet binding motif III in ApDMT did not show the homology to that of mammalian GMTs. Site-directed mutagenesis of Pro-170 and Met-171 showed that these amino acids play important role for binding of dimethylglycine, but not of glycine or sarcosine. The results of Figs. 9 and 10 suggest that the amino acid sequence just after AdoMet binding motif III might play important role for binding of methyl acceptor group in small moleculeN-methyltransferases, which remains to be tested experimentally.AdoHcy is a potent inhibitor in almost all AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases. For the continuous synthesis of betaine, AdoHcy must be removed by AdoHcy-hydrolase, which catalyzes both synthesis and hydrolysis reactions. The results of Fig. 5 A show that in contrast to most other AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases, the activities of ApGSMT and ApDMT were inhibited by AdoHcy with relatively low affinities. The K i values of ApGSMT and ApDMT were about 10-fold higher than that of rat GMT and 1000-fold higher than that of tRNA methyltransferase (Fig. 5 A). Allowance of relatively high concentrations of AdoHcy during the betaine synthesis could shift the equilibrium to the hydrolysis direction that would be suitable for the synthesis of large amount of betaine.Fig. 5 B shows that one of final product, betaine, did not inhibit the methyl transfer activities of ApGSMT and ApDMT. This property is also suitable for the synthesis of high concentrations of betaine. The results of Fig. 4 indicate that acetate and dimethylglycine are inhibitors for ApGSMT whereas n-butylic acid was an inhibitor for ApDMT. Any examined amino acids except glycine, ethanolamines derivatives, and several acids did not affect the methyl transfer activities. These facts suggest that betaine synthesis could occur relatively without interference of metabolites.Hitherto, extensive studies have been carried out for genetic engineering of betaine accumulation (35Rontein D. Basset G. Hanson A.D. Metab. Eng. 2002; 4: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 36Chen T.H. Murata N. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 250-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). All of them used the genes encoding choline-oxidizing enzymes such as choline monooxygenase, choline dehydrogenase, choline oxidase, and betaine-aldehyde dehydrogenase. However, the produced betaine levels were generally low. Several factors limiting the betaine levels are considered. Supply of choline, transport of choline to the place choline oxidizing enzyme localized, and increase of choline-oxidizing enzyme levels might be important to improve the abiotic tolerance of plants. The data of Fig. 8 show that ApGSMT and ApDMT could produce large amount of betaine inE. coli. Therefore, overexpression of ApGSMT and ApDMT in photosynthetic organisms are interesting subjects to be tested, which is in progress in this laboratory. Present results clearly indicate that in contrast to other oxygen-evolving photosynthetic organisms, betaine is synthesized from glycine by a three-step methylation in a halotolerant cyanobacteriumA. halophytica.

https://openalex.org/W2109587559,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand and receptor superfamily members play critical roles in diverse developmental and pathological settings. In search for novel TNF superfamily members, we identified a murine chromosomal locus that contains three new TNF receptor-related genes. Sequence alignments suggest that the ligand binding regions of these murine TNF receptor homologues, mTNFRH1, -2 and -3, are most homologous to those of the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors. By using a number of in vitro ligand-receptor binding assays, we demonstrate that mTNFRH1 and -2, but not mTNFRH3, bind murine TRAIL, suggesting that they are indeed TRAIL receptors. This notion is further supported by our demonstration that both mTNFRH1:Fc and mTNFRH2:Fc fusion proteins inhibited mTRAIL-induced apoptosis of Jurkat cells. Unlike the only other known murine TRAIL receptor mTRAILR2, however, neither mTNFRH2 nor mTNFRH3 has a cytoplasmic region containing the well characterized death domain motif. Coupled with our observation that overexpression of mTNFRH1 and -2 in 293T cells neither induces apoptosis nor triggers NFκB activation, we propose that themTnfrh1 and mTnfrh2 genes encode the first described murine decoy receptors for TRAIL, and we renamed themmDcTrailr1 and -r2, respectively. Interestingly, the overall sequence structures of mDcTRAILR1 and -R2 are quite distinct from those of the known human decoy TRAIL receptors, suggesting that the presence of TRAIL decoy receptors represents a more recent evolutionary event.

One group of ligand/receptor pairings critical to this decision-making process is the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TRAIL, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; CRDs, cysteine-rich domains; TM, transmembrane; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TNFR, TNF receptor; mTNFR, murine TNF receptor; PI-PLC, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; RT, reverse transcriptase; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; aa, amino acid; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; GFP, green fluorescent protein; BWS, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome; 7-AAD, 7-aminoactinomycin D; TRAF, TNF receptor-associated factor ligand and receptor superfamily (1Locksley R.M.

Upon ligand engagement, TNF receptors trigger intracellular signaling pathways that lead to cell proliferation, differentiation, or apoptosis. The pivotal roles of these TNF ligands and receptors across diverse biological areas are perhaps best illustrated by gene knockout studies demonstrating the essential involvement of the lymphotoxin pathway in lymphoorganogenesis (2Koni P.A.

Genet. 1999; 22: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The ability of many members of this family to regulate both innate and adaptive immunity also makes them attractive targets for therapeutic intervention of various immune disorders, as exemplified by the success of anti-TNF therapy in treating rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease (7Taylor P.C. Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 2001; 13: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). TNF receptor family members are characterized by the presence of cysteine-rich repeats (CRDs) in their extracellular domains (8Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 19-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 9Naismith J.H. Sprang S.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 74-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). A CRD typically contains two structural motifs, called modules, that are stabilized by disulfide bridges formed between the cysteine residues. The linear arrangement of modules creates a scaffold that supports the unusual elongated structures seen in all known crystal structures of TNFR family members. In contrast to the absolute conservation of CRDs, the signaling potentials of TNF receptors vary a great deal. Whereas most TNF receptors, such as TNFR1, CD40, and Fas, have cytoplasmic domains containing well characterized signaling motifs such as TRAF-binding sites and/or death domain (10Inoue J. Ishida T. Tsukamoto N. Kobayashi N. Naito A. Azuma S. Yamamoto T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 11Hofmann K. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1113-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), others lack signaling capacity. These non-signaling receptors include soluble receptors OPG and DcR3, the GPI-anchored human TRAILR3, and human TRAILR4 that contains a defective signaling cytoplasmic tail. The biological function of these so-called “decoy receptors” is likely to antagonize the pairing between ligands and their signaling receptor counterparts, providing a critical mechanism for ligand desensitization (12Marsters S.A.

Whereas many members of the TNF ligand superfamily demonstrate one-to-one pairing with their cognate receptors, others exhibit complex ligand/receptor cross-talks (8Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 19-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). In particular, the TNF ligand TRAIL has five receptors in human, at least based on in vitrobinding assays (16Griffith T.S. Lynch D.H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 559-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 17Emery J.G. McDonnell P. Burke M.B. Deen K.C. Lyn S. Silverman C. Dul E. Appelbaum E.R. Eichman C. DiPrinzio R. Dodds R.A.

Among the hTRAIL receptors, hTRAILR1 and -R2 each contain a death domain in the cytoplasmic region, and as a result hTRAIL can efficiently induce caspase-dependent apoptosis in cell lines expressing these receptors (18Pan G. O'Rourke K. Chinnaiyan A.M. Gentz R. Ebner R. Ni J. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 276: 111-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar, 19Pan G. Ni J. Wei Y.F. Yu G. Gentz R. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 277: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). As mentioned before, hTRAILR3 and -R4 are both considered decoy receptors, but theirin vivo function is not clear. The fifth TRAIL-binding TNF receptor is OPG, which also binds to RANKL (17Emery J.G. McDonnell P. Burke M.B. Deen K.C. Lyn S. Silverman C. Dul E. Appelbaum E.R. Eichman C. DiPrinzio R. Dodds R.A. James I.E. Rosenberg M. Lee J.C. Young P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14363-14367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). Whereas studies of OPG knockout mice have clearly demonstrated OPG as a decoy receptor for RANKL, the in vivo relevance of OPG to TRAIL biology remains to be established (17Emery J.G. McDonnell P.

Lacey D.L. Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1260-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar). Interestingly, only one murine TRAIL receptor, mTRAILR2/mKiller, has been identified so far (21Wu G.S. Burns T.F. Zhan Y. Alnemri E.S. El-Deiry W.S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2770-2775PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to hTRAILR1 and -R2, mTRAILR2 contains a death domain motif and induces apoptosis when overexpressed or engaged by TRAIL. Known as the TNF receptor “signature,” the uniquely spaced cysteine residues found in these receptors allows identification of potential new family members from unprocessed genomic sequences by bioinformatic means. In this study, we describe the identification through genome mining of three new TNFR family members closely clustered on mouse chromosome 7. All three genes, named mTNFRH1, -2and -3, encode proteins containing classic TNF receptor-like CRDs. We also demonstrate that, whereas mTNFRH3 remains an orphan receptor, mTNFRH1 and two splice variants of mTNFRH2 can specifically bind murine TRAIL, but not the closely related RANKL nor any other ligand we have tested. Both sequence analysis and transient overexpression studies, however, suggest that mTNFRH1 and -2 are not signaling TRAIL receptors but rather the previously unknown murine TRAIL “decoy” receptors. Given their low overall sequence homology to hTRAILR3 and hTRAILR4, we propose that mTNFRH1 and -2 belong to a new class of TRAIL decoy receptors and thus named them mDcTRAILR1 and -R2, respectively. The identification of these two murine TRAIL decoy receptors will likely facilitate our understanding of the complex biology underlying TRAIL ligand/receptor interactions through the generation of mice deficient in these receptors. Anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody, M2-agarose, and Biot-M2 were purchased from Sigma. PI-PLC from Bacillus thuringiensis was purchased from ICN Biochemicals (Aurora, OH). hTRAIL, hRANKL, hEDA, hTRAILR1:Fc, hTRAILR2:Fc, hTRAILR3:Fc, hTRAILR4:Fc, hOPG, and hEDAR:Fc were from Apotech (www.apotech.com). muOPG:Fc was purchased from R & D Systems (www.rndsystems.com). Cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen. 293T cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS). Jurkat cells were maintained in RPMI + 10% FCS and HEK-293 cells in DMEM:F12 + 2% FCS. All media contained 10 μg/ml each penicillin and streptomycin. All the cell lines used for Northern analysis were purchased from ATCC and grown in recommended culture media. Transient transfections in 293T cells for the production of soluble proteins in serum-free Opti-MEM and establishment of stable transfectants in HEK-293 cells were performed as described previously (22Schneider P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 325-345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA of mTNFRH1/mDcTRAILR1 was obtained from EST clones (GenBankTM accession numbersAI156311, AI747041, and BG077775). A full-length coding cDNA was generated from these clones by a PCR-based method and cloned into the PCR-3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). The full-length cDNA clone of mTNFRH3 was obtained by screening a mouse spleen phage cDNA library (Stratagene) using a partial cDNA probe amplified from the E14 ES cell line. The screening was performed according to recommended protocol from Stratagene and resulted in one cDNA clone from about 1 × 106independent clones. The cDNAs of both splicing variants of mTNFRH2/mDcTRAILR2 were obtained by RT-PCR using primer sequences designed on genomic sequences. Briefly, total RNA was isolated from NIH3T3 cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) followed by first strand synthesis using Superscript II (Invitrogen). PCR was performed using the Touchdown protocol. The cDNA of mTRAILR2/mKiller was obtained similarly using RNA from the J1 ES cell line. The PCR-3 mammalian expression vectors encoding the various FLAG ligand and receptor:Fc fusion proteins were generated as described (22Schneider P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 325-345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using cDNA sequences encoding the following amino acid residues: mDcTRAILR1 (aa 1–158), mDcTRAILR2L (aa 1–171), mDcTRAILR2S (aa 1–180), mTNFRH3 (aa 1–162), muTRAILR2 (aa 1–177), muRANK (aa 1–200), muTRAIL (aa 120–291), and muRANKL (aa 157–316). Tissue expression patterns were done using premade Northern blots from Ambion. For expression patterns in various murine cell lines, total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and 20 μg of total RNA was loaded for each lane. Probes for each gene were generated using PCR amplification of the coding regions and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Ready-To-Go DNA labeling beads (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were hybridized and washed in ExpressHyb solution (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Receptors:Fc (∼500 ng) mixed with FLAG ligands (200 ng) in 1 ml of PBS were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C on a wheel with 2.5 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Beads were harvested, loaded in empty mini-columns, washed 3× with 100 volumes of PBS, eluted with 15 μl of 0.1 m citrate NaOH, pH 2.7, neutralized, and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG M2 antibody. Membranes were subsequently reprobed with goat anti-human IgG antibodies. The interaction between receptor:Fc and FLAG ligands by ELISA was performed as described previously (23Thompson J.S. Bixler S.A. Qian F. Vora K. Scott M.L. Cachero T.G. Hession C. Schneider P. Sizing I.D. Mullen C. Strauch K. Zafari M. Benjamin C.D. Tschopp J. Browning J.L. Ambrose C. Science. 2001; 293: 2108-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Briefly, ELISA plates were coated with mouse anti-human IgG and then sequentially incubated at 37 °C with receptor:Fc, FLAG ligands, biotinylated M2, and horseradish peroxidase-coupled streptavidin. The binding of receptor:Fc was also probed directly with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled rabbit anti-human IgG polyclonal antibody. Parental HEK-293 cells (2 × 105) and stable transfectants expressing full-length mDcTRAILR1 or full-length mDcTRAILR2L were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 100 μl of DMEM + 10% FCS containing or not 0.05 unit of PI-PLC from B. thuringiensis. After transfer on ice, cells were washed and sequentially stained with 50 μl of FLAG-muTRAIL (100 ng/ml), 50 μl of biotinylated M2 (1:500), and 50 μl of phycoerythrin-coupled streptavidin (1:500), and submitted to FACS analysis. For mTRAIL-induced Jurkat cell death, assays were performed as described (22Schneider P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 325-345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the TRAIL-sensitive Jurkat cells were incubated for 16 h with the indicated amount of FLAG-hTRAIL or FLAG-mTRAIL in the presence of 2 μg/ml anti-FLAG M2 cross-linking antibody. In other experiments, cell death induced by a fixed dose of FLAG-mTRAIL (50 ng/ml) + M2 antibody (2 μg/ml) was inhibited with the indicated amount of mDcTRAILR1:Fc, mDcTRAILR2:Fc, or hTRAILR2:Fc. Cell viability was measured by the phenazine methosulfate/3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium assay (Promega). For 293T cell death induced by expression of various TNF receptor family members, both adherent and floating cells, were collected 24–48 h post-transfection and stained with annexin V and 7-AAD (Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Transfected cells were identified as cells expressing GFP. Dead cells were quantified as the percentage of GFP-positive cells that were also positive for 7-AAD staining. For caspase activity assay, 293T cells (90-mm dish) were transfected with 7 μg of indicated plasmids. Cells were washed and harvested 24 h post-transfection and lysed in 70 μl of lysis buffer (0.2% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) for 10 min on ice. Caspase activity was determined by loading 20 μl (triplicate) of lysates in black 96-well plate followed by addition of 100 μl of DEVDase buffer (0.1% CHAPS, 2 mmMgCl2, 5 mm of EGTA, 150 mmNaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, + 21 μl of 0.1m dithiothreitol + 15 μl of DEVD-AMC 5 mm in Me2SO). Fluorescence was then measured (excitation 355 nm, emission 460 nm) at different time points, and 5-h time point values are shown. For NFκB assay, 2 × 105 293T cells were plated in each well of 24-well plates overnight and then transfected with various amounts of the indicated TNF receptor expressing vectors in triplicate together with 40 ng of an NFκB luciferase reporter construct. Luciferase activity was measured 24 h post-transfection using the LucLite luciferase reporter gene assay kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). 293T cells were transfected with various TNF receptor family members using the Polyfect Tranfection (Qiagen) protocol. Briefly, cells were plated at 5 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates for 24 h and then cotransfected with 500 ng of a GFP expression construct (AN050) and various concentrations of expression constructs containing the individual TNF receptor family members. After 24–48 h, cells were harvested and sequentially stained with FLAG-tagged mTRAIL, an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma, 1:2000), and phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-murine IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:200) each for 30 min at 4 °C. All cell samples were analyzed on the BD Biosciences FACSCalibur. To detect the binding of mTRAIL expressed on the cell surface, 293T cells were transfected with either mock vector or full-length murine TRAIL using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the recommended protocol. The cells were harvested 24 h later with 5 mm EDTA in PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the following murine receptor Fc fusion proteins diluted in FACS buffer: DcTRAILR2L:Fc (10 μg/ml), BCMA:Fc (10 μg/ml), TRAILR2:Fc at (10 μg/ml), and DcTRAILR2S:Fc (100 μl of tissue culture supernatant). After washing, the cells were incubated with phycoerythrin-labeled goat anti-human IgG:Fc (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at 1:200 dilution for 30 min at room temperature. After final washes, cells were resuspended in 1% paraformaldehyde/PBS and analyzed using the BD Biosciences FACSCalibur. Models ofmTRAIL trimer (residues 125–291) complexed to a single subunit of mTNFRH3 (residues 41–148), mDcTRAILR1(residues 52–160), and mDcTRAILR2 (residues 62–170) were built based on the crystal structure of human TRAIL/DR5 (TRAILR2) complex (Protein Data Bank code 1D4V (24Mongkolsapaya J. Grimes J.M. Chen N. Xu X.N. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. Screaton G.R. Nat. Struct.

MODELLER: Implementing 3D Protein Modeling, Version 5.0. MC2 Molecular Simulations Inc., Burlington, MA1995Google Scholar)). The alignment of the receptors used for modeling is shown in Fig. 2 A. Multiple models generated for each complex were validated using ProsaII program (25Šali A. MODELLER: Implementing 3D Protein Modeling, Version 5.0. MC2 Molecular Simulations Inc., Burlington, MA1995Google Scholar), and the ones having lowest the z scores were selected for further analysis. The models were visualized in the MOLMOL program (26Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14 (29–32): 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar, 27Engemann S. Strodicke M. Paulsen M. Franck O. Reinhardt R. Lane N. Reik W. Walter J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2691-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To identify potential new TNF receptor family members, we used a TNFR signature profile (Prf:TNFR_NGFR_2 at www.expasy.ch/cgi-bin/nicedoc.pl?PDOC00561) to search a data base generated by the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics that predicts proteins from the public genomic data bases. Our initial screening resulted in one TNFR signature-containing hit from the mouse genomic BAC clone RP23-6I17 (GenBankTM accession number AC068006). By using RT-PCR, we were able to confirm that this TNF receptor-like gene was indeed expressed (data not shown). Subsequent determination of its genomic localization revealed a tight linkage to two potentially novel TNF receptor homologous genes, Tnfrh1 and-2, predicted from the genomic sequencing effort on the distal region of the mouse chromosome 7, the murine syntenic region of the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) region in human ((27) GenBankTM accession number of the full genomic locus,AJ276505). Because the TNF receptor-like gene we identified is located to the immediate 3′ of the predicted Tnfrh1 and-2 genes, we named the gene Tnfrh3. Based on the above information, we hypothesized that there exists a previously unknown TNF receptor cluster on the distal region of mouse chromosome 7. We then proceeded to obtain the full-length coding regions of all three Tnfrh genes (see below), and we identified several BAC clones (Resgen) containing the entire Tnfrhs locus. Upon extensive sequencing efforts, we concluded that, sandwiched between theobph1 and car1 genes, the three mTnfrhgenes span roughly 100 kb with no other apparent intervening genes, based on analysis using GenScan (Fig. 1 A). Because of our functional data (see below), we propose to rename the first two Tnfrh genesmDcTrailr1 and -r2. Upon data base search, we found that a full-length cDNA sequence containing the predicted cDNA sequence formDcTrailr1 had been isolated previously and reported in a patent filing (international publication number, WO 98/43998). We then employed two different approaches to obtain the complete coding sequences for mDcTrailr2 and mTnfrh3. FormTnfrh3, partial cDNA fragment amplified by RT-PCR from total RNA prepared from the mouse ES cell line E14 was used to probe a Stratagene mouse spleen cDNA phage library, resulting in the isolation of a single mTnfrh3 full-length cDNA clone (GenBankTM accession number AY165628). FormDcTrailr2, the full coding region was obtained by a combination of computer-assisted exon prediction and PCR amplification from 1st strand DNA synthesized from NIH3T3 total RNA, which revealed the presence of two alternatively spliced mDcTrailr2variants (GenBankTM accession numbers AY165626 andAY165627) (Fig. 1 B). As expected, each mTNFRH contains a signal peptide sequence at the N terminus followed by TNFR-like cysteine-rich repeats, consistent with the typical type I membrane protein topology observed in most TNFR family members (Fig. 1 B). The structures of their CRDs are remarkably similar, with three tandem A1/B2 domains in both mDcTRAILR1 and mDcTRAILR2, whereas mTNFRH3 has two A1/B2 followed by one A2/B2 domain (8Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 19-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 C). The C-terminal portions of the mTNFRHs, however, are surprisingly divergent. Whereas mTNFRH3 contains a typical transmembrane domain (TM), the C terminus of mDcTRAILR1 instead exhibits structural features of a GPI anchor addition signal (Fig. 1 B) (28Udenfriend S. Kodukula K. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The two splice variants of mDcTRAILR2 also diverge in their C termini. The cDNA spanning exons 1–7 contains a stop codon within exon 6 and encodes a secreted soluble receptor (mDcTRAILR2S), whereas the splice variant lacking exon 6 encodes a longer isoform (mDcTRAILR2L) containing a TM region and a short intracellular domain. Finally, mDcTRAILR1 and -R2 are highly homologous with 71% identity at the amino acid level (Fig. 1 B), indicating a recent gene duplication event at this locus. We next examined the expression patterns of mTNFRHs in both mouse tissues and cell lines. Based on Northern blot analysis, the expression of mTnfrh3 is primarily restricted to lymphoid tissues with a single ∼3-kb message detected in both the thymus and spleen and at low but detectable levels in the lung (Fig. 2 A). The lymphoid-specific expression pattern of mTnfrh3 was largely confirmed in Northern analysis of a number of murine cell lines, with its expression detected almost exclusively in lymphoid cell lines, including both the T and B lineages. The only noticeable exception is Colon 26, a colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line that also expressedmTnfrh3 (Fig. 2 B). The analysis of expression patterns of mDcTrailr1 and mDcTrailr2, however, is complicated by the extremely high homology between these two genes. Although we could confirm by RT-PCR that both mDcTrailr1 and-2 are indeed expressed genes (data not shown), we were unable to distinguish their individual expression patterns by Northern analysis due to cross-hybridization of the probe to both mRNAs. Instead, the combined expression of mDcTrailr1 and mDcTrailr2, as determined by the presence of at least one of the mRNA species, could be detected at low levels in all the mouse tissues upon prolonged exposure (data not shown). In contrast, the levels of expression were considerably higher in murine cell lines, and various levels of combined expression can be detected in most of mouse lines we have tested so far without obvious patterns in the tissue/organ origins of the positive cell lines (Fig. 2 C). The CRDs of TNF receptors not only provide the overall structural scaffold but also determine their ligand binding specificity (8Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 19-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). In an attempt to “deorphanize” mTNFRHs, we performed sequence alignments of their CRD regions with those of the other known TNF receptors. Our analysis revealed significant homologies between mTNFRHs and TRAIL receptors, particularly in regions of the TRAIL receptors that are involved in binding to TRAIL (Fig. 1 C), as suggested by the crystallographic studies of the hTRAIL-hTRAILR2 complex (24Mongkolsapaya J.

To examine experimentally whether these novel TNF receptors can indeed bind to the TNF ligand TRAIL, we first used an ELISA-based screening assay that has been optimized for the detection of interactions between TNF family ligands and receptors (22Schneider P.

https://openalex.org/W2039274143,"Hypertonic stress (HS) can alter the function of mammalian cells. We have reported that HS enhances differentiated responses of T cells by increasing their ability to produce interleukin (IL)-2, a finding of clinical interest because hypertonic infusions may modulate immune function in patients. HS shrinks cells and mechanically deforms membranes, which results in ATP release from many cell types. Here we investigate if ATP release is an underlying mechanism through which HS augments T cell function. We found that mechanical stress and HS induced rapid ATP release from Jurkat T cells. HS and exogenous ATP mobilized intracellular Ca2+, activated p38 MAPK, and increased IL-2 expression. Ca2+ mobilization was attenuated in the presence of EGTA or by removal of extracellular ATP with apyrase. Adenosine did not increase IL-2 expression, as did ATP. Apyrase, inhibition of P2 receptors, or inhibition of p38 MAPK with SB203580 reduced the stimulatory effects of HS, indicating that HS enhances IL-2 expression through a mechanism that involves ATP release, P2 (perhaps P2X7) receptors, and p38 MAPK activation. We conclude that release of and response to ATP plays a key role in the mechanism through which hypertonic stress regulates the function of T cells.

Hypertonic solutions can be used to resuscitate trauma patients, who are predisposed to septic complications, and can improve T cell function after hemorrhagic shock, reducing the risk of sepsis after trauma (1Junger W.G.

The enhancing effect of HS on IL-2 expression is paralleled by robust tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of intracellular proteins including p38 MAPK (2Junger W.G. Hoyt D.B. Hamreus M. Liu F.C. Herdon-Remelius C. Junger W. Altman A. J. Trauma. 1997; 42: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This kinase is structurally related to the yeast protein HOG-1, which is part of the signaling system that allows yeast cells to regulate gene transcription in response to osmotic stress (7Kültz D. Burg M. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 3015-3021PubMed Google Scholar). In human T cells, p38 MAPK signaling is involved in the activation of IL-2 gene expression (8Matsuda S. Moriguchi T. Koyasu S. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12378-12382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Therefore, by analogy with its yeast counterpart, osmotic activation of the p38 MAPK may be involved in the mechanisms whereby HS enhances IL-2 expression of T cells. In yeast, two osmoreceptors are known to activate HOG-1. No equivalent mammalian osmoreceptors have been identified to date, and, thus, the mechanisms whereby T cells respond to extracellular tonicity are unclear (7Kültz D. Burg M. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 3015-3021PubMed Google Scholar). HS results in cell shrinkage and mechanical deformation of the cell membrane. In a number of cell types, mechanical stress activates multiple signaling enzymes, including p38 MAPK (9Liang F. Gardner D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1603-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 10Nguyen H.T. Adam R.M. Bride S.H. Park J.M. Peters C.A. Freeman M.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1155-C1167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanisms by which these cells detect and respond to direct mechanical stimulation may be similar to those involved in the recognition of HS. Mechanical stimulation can cause the rapid release of ATP (11Pedersen S. Pedersen S.F. Nilius B. Lambert I.H. Hoffmann E.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1416: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 12Yegutkin G. Bodin P. Burnstock G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 13Ostrom R.S.

Once released into the extracellular environment, ATP can regulate cell function in an autocrine/paracrine manner by interacting with P2X and/or P2Y receptors that are expressed on the surface of virtually all mammalian cells (13Ostrom R.S.

Extracellular ATP and its metabolic products, including adenosine, which acts via P1 receptors, exert a strong influence on lymphocyte function: ATP can stimulate the proliferation of mouse thymocytes, and ATP and adenosine can antagonize and/or complement T cell receptor-induced signaling, apoptosis, and thymocyte differentiation (16Dubyak G.R.

Blood. 2001; 97: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that ATP release in response to osmotic stimulation could be a mechanism whereby HS enhances IL-2 expression of T cells. ATP and a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, ATPγS, suramin, apyrase, adenosine deaminase, and Me2SO were from Sigma, whereas 1-[N,O-bis(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-N-methyl-l-tyrosyl]-4-phenylpiperazine (KN-62), 2′,3′-dialdehyde ATP (oxidized ATP, o-ATP), pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid (PPADS), and SB203580 were from Calbiochem. The Ca2+-sensitive intracellular probe Fura-2 was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Antibodies to CD3 were purified from the supernatant of OKT-3 cells (clone CRL 8001) obtained from ATCC and anti-CD28 antibodies (clone CD28.2) were from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Polyclonal goat anti-P2X7 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and normal horse serum, biotinylated anti-goat antibodies, and fluorescein avidin D cell sorter grade conjugate were from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Jurkat T cells (clone E6–1) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in RPMI 1640 (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (University of California San Diego core facility, La Jolla, CA), and 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Irvine Scientific). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from the heparinized venous blood of healthy human volunteers as described before (5Loomis W.H. Namiki S. Hoyt D.B. Junger W.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C840-C848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Jurkat cells were stimulated by simultaneously activating the T cell receptor-CD3 complex and CD28 co-receptor with Dynabeads (Dynal Inc., Lake Success, NY) coated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. The beads (107), precoated with anti-mouse IgG, were coated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 by incubation with 5 μg of each antibody at room temperature for 1 h. Then the beads were washed twice with RPMI with 10% fetal calf serum and resuspended at 107beads/ml, and 20 μl was added to 2 × 104 Jurkat cells (10 beads/cell). The cells were incubated in a final volume of 200 μl for 20 h at 37 °C under tissue culture conditions, and IL-2 in the supernatant was determined. PBMC were suspended in the RPMI medium described above (105/ml) and stimulated under tissue culture conditions with 0.5 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin (PHA; Abbott) in a final volume of 200 μl for 20 h. IL-2 concentrations in the supernatants were determined with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method described below. Where indicated, cells were pretreated for 1 h at 37 °C with different agents including P1 and P2 receptor antagonists or the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (19Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNutty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3147) Google Scholar). Cells were subjected to HS by adding appropriate volumes of RPMI containing 1 m NaCl. All materials and compounds used in these experiments were sterile and endotoxin-free. ATP release from Jurkat cells was monitored in real time with cells suspended in luciferase reagent. Cells were brought to a density of 5 × 105/ml in RPMI without fetal calf serum, and 25 μl/well was transferred to a 96-well luminometer plate. Luciferase reagent in RPMI (25 μl/well) was then added (ATP Bioluminescence Assay Kit CLS II; Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). The plate was placed in a temperature-controlled luminometer (Luminoskan; Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland), and sequential readings were taken as indicated. For quantitative ATP measurements, cells were preincubated for 3 h at 37 °C and stimulated with hypertonic saline for different periods. The cells were then placed on ice, and ATP concentrations in the supernatants were determined. IL-2 released into the supernatants after 20 h was measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using monoclonal mouse anti-human IL-2 as a primary antibody (clone 5355.111) and biotinylated goat anti-human IL-2 as a secondary antibody (both from R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN), recombinant human IL-2 as a standard (Genzyme Diagnostics, Cambridge, MA), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed according to the recommendations provided by R&D Systems. To measure p38 MAPK activation, Jurkat cells (106 cells/sample) stimulated in the different experiments were placed on ice, centrifuged, resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold SDS sample buffer containing 100 mmdithiothreitol, and lysed by boiling for 5 min. The cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis using 8–16% Tris/glycine polyacrylamide gradient gels (Novex, San Diego, CA). Lysed proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and the membranes were subjected to immunoblotting with phospho-specific antibodies that recognize the phosphorylated (on Thr180/Tyr182), and thereby activated, form of p38 MAPK (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Antibodies recognizing both active and inactive p38 MAPK were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and secondary antibody conjugates as well as the ECL assay kit were from Amersham Biosciences. Intracellular Ca2+ levels were determined as described previously (20Junger W.G. Hoyt D.B. Davis R.E. Herdon-Remelius C. Namiki S. Junger H. Loomis W. Altman A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2768-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) using the fluorescent Ca2+ probe Fura-2 and a spectrofluorimeter (Kontron Instruments, Zurich, Switzerland). In experiments, where extracellular Ca2+ was chelated, EGTA (Calbiochem) was added at a final concentration of 10 mm. Expression of the P2X7 receptor in Jurkat cells was determined by immunoblotting of cell membrane fractions and by immunofluorescence staining. Cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 5 ml of homogenization buffer (30 mm HEPES, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 2 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.5), homogenized with a sonicator, and centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, resulting in a pellet containing a crude membrane preparation. Purified plasma membrane preparations were obtained by density gradient centrifugation of the cell homogenate using 30% Percoll at 64,000 × g for 30 min. The crude and purified membrane preparations were boiled in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with goat anti-P2X7 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For immunostaining, cells were attached to microscope slides by cytocentrifugation, fixed with chilled acetone for 10 s, and dried. Then the cells were blocked with 10% normal horse serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min and incubated with 20 μg/ml goat anti-P2X7 antibody in 10% horse serum for 1 h. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated for 10 min with biotinylated horse anti-goat IgG antibody in 10% horse serum, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated for another 10 min with fluorescein avidin D cell sorter grade conjugate according to the supplier's recommendations. The cells were washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline, mounted with Crystal/Mount (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA), and examined with a fluorescence microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Fluorescence and modulation contrast images were acquired of cells that were stained with anti-P2X7 and of control cells that were treated identically to the antibody-stained cells, except that the primary anti-P2X7 antibody was omitted. Unless otherwise indicated, data are presented as mean ± S.D. Sets of data were compared with Student's t test, using p < 0.05 as the level of significance. We first investigated whether mechanical stimulation causes ATP release from Jurkat cells. Cells were suspended in RPMI containing luciferase reagent, and ATP release was monitored on-line with a luminometer. Initially high luminescence readings, indicative of ATP release due to cell handling, gradually decreased, reaching base-line levels within 150 min (Fig. 1 A, left). When the cells were mechanically stimulated by gentle aspiration with a pipette four times, the luminescence signal rapidly peaked within 1 min and returned toward base-line levels by 100 min. These results show that mechanical stimulation causes the release of ATP into the extracellular space. The steady decline of luminescence readings after mechanical stimulation indicates that ATP release ceases shortly after the stimulus and that released ATP is hydrolyzed, presumably by ectoapyrases, ecto-ATPases, and/or ecto-5′-nucleotidases expressed on the Jurkat cell surface (21Zimmermann H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 231-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Because HS causes rapid cell shrinkage, we hypothesized that the associated mechanical forces could trigger ATP release from T cells. We tested this possibility by monitoring ATP release in response to increasing levels of HS. The addition of hypertonic solutions rapidly released ATP in a concentration-dependent fashion (Fig. 1 A, right). Peak luminescence signals reached a maximum within 4 min and gradually decreased to base-line readings with kinetics similar to those observed with mechanical agitation. The peak ATP signal in response to stimulation with 80 mmhypertonicity was more than 3 times as high as that observed in response to 40 mm hypertonicity. ATP release was less pronounced in response to 160 mm, suggesting that higher levels of hypertonicity may exert suppressive effects on ATP release. The relation between HS levels and ATP release was further examined by measuring ATP release using an approach similar to that described by Yegutkin et al. (12Yegutkin G. Bodin P. Burnstock G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), who prevented the degradation of extracellular ATP with suramin, a drug that blocks P2 receptors and also inhibits ecto-5′-nucleotidases. These experiments confirmed that exposure to HS causes a fast and dose-dependent increase in extracellular ATP. The addition of an equivalent volume of isotonic control solution caused a considerably smaller increase in extracellular ATP, which is likely the result of mechanical perturbations caused by adding this solution (Fig. 1 B,left). ATP release increased with hypertonicity levels peaking at 80 mm HS (Fig. 1 B,right). The similarities between ATP release and other T cell responses to HS suggested that ATP release could be involved in the mechanisms whereby HS enhances IL-2 expression. To test this possibility, Jurkat cells were stimulated with antibodies to CD3 and CD28 in the presence of increasing levels of HS or exogenous ATP, and IL-2 production was measured 20 h later. HS at concentrations up to 60 mmincreased IL-2 expression of Jurkat cells and isolated PBMC, whereas higher levels of HS suppressed IL-2 production (Fig. 2 A). Similar to HS, the addition of exogenous ATP significantly increased IL-2 expression of Jurkat cells in a concentration-dependent fashion (Fig. 2 B, left). ATP concentrations of 10–40 μm significantly increased IL-2 expression. As with increasing levels of HS, higher concentrations of ATP progressively reduced the enhancement of IL-2 expression. The nonhydrolyzable ATP analog ATPγS also enhanced IL-2 expression, doubling IL-2 expression at concentrations of ≥20 μm (Fig. 2 B,left). In contrast to the results with ATP and HS, we observed no bimodal effect at higher concentrations of ATPγS. UTP at concentrations between 0.02 and 1 μm also enhanced IL-2 expression, whereas ADP and adenosine (ADO) had no discernible effects (Fig. 2 B, right). These data demonstrate that certain nucleotides, but not ADP and adenosine, can co-stimulate IL-2 expression, supporting the notion that activation of specific nucleotide receptors may contribute to the regulation of T cell function by HS. Extracellular nucleotides, such as ATP, act via plasma membrane P2Y and P2X receptors (14Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar, 16Dubyak G.R. J. Auton. Nerv. Syst. 2000; 81: 64-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18Di Virgilio F. Chiozzi P. Ferrari D. Falzoni S. Sanz J.M. Morelli A. Torboli M. Bolognesi G. Baricordi O.R. Blood. 2001; 97: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Activation of both receptor types results in intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. To test whether exposure of Jurkat cells to HS or ATP could elicit intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, we loaded Jurkat cells with the Ca2+ probe Fura-2 and assessed [Ca2+] in response to HS or the addition of ATP. HS rapidly and concentration-dependently increased intracellular [Ca2+] in Jurkat cells (Fig. 3 A, left). This response was blunted when extracellular ATP was hydrolyzed with apyrase or when extracellular Ca2+ was bound with EGTA (Fig. 3 A, right). The peak Ca2+concentrations corresponded to the applied levels of HS and were consistently reduced by apyrase (Fig. 3 B). Exogenous ATP and ATPγS mobilized Ca2+ over a similar time course (Fig. 3 C). Whereas 0.5–1.0 mm ATP was required to mobilize calcium, ∼100-fold lower concentrations of ATPγS increased intracellular [Ca2+], suggesting that much of the added ATP may be hydrolyzed before it can activate P2 receptors on the T cell membrane. Together, these findings suggest that HS-promoted ATP release can trigger secondary signaling events, such as Ca2+mobilization via activation of purinergic receptors, which may be involved in the up-regulation of IL-2 expression by HS. As a further test of the idea that ATP released in response to HS augments the ability of CD3/CD28-stimulated T cells to express IL-2, we exposed CD3/CD28-stimulated Jurkat cells to HS in the presence of apyrase, an enzyme that scavenges extracellular ATP (22Roman R.M. Feranchak A.P. Davison A. Schwiebert E.M. Fitz J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1222-G1230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Apyrase concentration-dependently reduced the co-stimulatory effects of HS (Fig. 4 A). At a concentration of 20 units/ml, apyrase almost completely prevented the enhancement of IL-2 expression by increasing levels of HS (Fig. 4 B). These data are consistent with the idea that ATP released into the extracellular space plays a critical role in the events that lead to enhanced IL-2 expression in the presence of HS. As a second approach to examine the role of ATP release in the enhancement of IL-2 expression, we used the P2 receptor antagonist, suramin, which nonselectively blocks P2 receptors and, in addition, as noted above, inhibits ecto-ATPases (14Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). Suramin significantly reduced the enhancing effects of HS on IL-2 production (Fig. 4 C). ATP can be hydrolyzed to adenosine by ectoenzymes (17Apasov S. Koshiba M. Redegeld F. Sitkovsky M.V. Immunol. Rev. 1995; 146: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and we investigated whether adenosine might be involved in the enhancing effects of HS on IL-2 production. The addition of adenosine deaminase to hydrolyze adenosine did not alter the effect of HS on IL-2 expression (Fig. 4 D). This suggests that ATP but not adenosine is responsible for the enhancing effects of HS. Stimulation of P2X7 receptors has been reported to increase intracellular [Ca2+] and to synergize T cell proliferation in response to mitogens, such as PHA (18Di Virgilio F. Chiozzi P. Ferrari D. Falzoni S. Sanz J.M. Morelli A. Torboli M. Bolognesi G. Baricordi O.R. Blood. 2001; 97: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). We used two approaches, immunoblotting of membranes (Fig. 5 A) and immune fluorescence analysis of cells (Fig. 5 B), and found that Jurkat T cells express P2X7 receptors. In addition, we tested the role of P2X7 in the response of T cells to HS using the P2 receptor antagonists KN-62, o-ATP, and PPADS, all of which antagonize P2X7 receptors (14Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). Jurkat T cells or isolated PBMC were treated with increasing concentrations of these antagonists for 20 min, exposed to 40 mm HS, and stimulated with CD3/CD28 or PHA, respectively. With IC50values of about 0.1 μm, KN-62 was the most potent of the three compounds in reducing the effect of HS on IL-2 production (Fig. 5 C). PPADS and o-ATP also reduced IL-2 expression, although higher antagonist concentrations were needed; both PPADS and o-ATP suppressed IL-2 expression of PBMC beyond the IL-2 expression level reached under isotonic conditions (dashed line). PBMC preparations consist not only of T cells but also of B cells and monocytes; the antagonists may affect P2 receptors in these other cells that serve as accessory cells to T cells. The inhibitory effect by o-ATP was observed with both Jurkat and peripheral T cells, suggesting that o-ATP may not only affect the P2X7 receptor but also perhaps other P2 receptors that influence T cell activation under normal, isotonic conditions. HS is known to activate p38 MAPK in T cells (2Junger W.G. Hoyt D.B. Hamreus M. Liu F.C. Herdon-Remelius C. Junger W. Altman A. J. Trauma. 1997; 42: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Because p38 MAPK signaling targets several nuclear factors that may be responsible for T cell gene regulation, we tested whether p38 MAPK contributes to the mechanisms through which HS enhances IL-2 expression. We thus compared the roles of p38 MAPK signaling in response to stimulation with ATP or HS. HS levels of 20, 40, and 100 mm activated p38 MAPK in a concentration- and time-dependent fashion (Fig. 6 A). p38 MAPK activation was detectable at 40 and 100 mm hypertonicity by 3 min, but the highest activation levels were observed 30–60 min after stimulation with HS. Stimulation of T cells with ATP caused a less pronounced activation of p38 MAPK with a peak at 1 min (Fig. 6 B). ATP concentrations between 0.01 and 1 μm were most effective in the stimulation of p38 MAPK activation (Fig. 6 C). These data show that extracellular ATP can trigger p38 MAPK activation and that ATP release in response to hypertonic stimulation of T cells may contribute to HS-promoted activation of p38 MAPK. A reason for the different kinetics and amplitudes of p38 MAPK stimulation by HS and ATP may be the prolonged nature of hypertonic stimulation compared with stimulation with ATP. The findings above suggest that p38 MAPK signaling may contribute to the enhancement of IL-2 expression by HS and ATP. We thus inhibited p38 MAPK with the inhibitor SB203580 and investigated whether this would prevent the enhancing effects of HS on CD3/CD28-stimulated IL-2 expression. SB203580 concentration-dependently reduced the enhancement of IL-2 expression by 40 mm hypertonicity. Increasing concentrations of SB203580 also reduced IL-2 expression of cells stimulated in the absence of HS (Fig. 7). The latter finding corresponds to earlier reports that suggested a role of p38 MAPK in the activation of IL-2 expression of Jurkat cells (8Matsuda S. Moriguchi T. Koyasu S. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12378-12382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). SB203580 completely abrogated the enhancement of IL-2 expression by a wide range of HS conditions (Fig. 7). These results imply that p38 MAPK plays a major role in the enhancement of IL-2 expression by HS. Under normal physiological conditions, plasma tonicity can vary significantly as a consequence of water loss and salt uptake. Plasma tonicity is affected by age (23McLean K.A. O'Neill P.A. Davies I. Morris J. Age Ageing. 1992; 21: 56-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), climate, and seasonal changes (24Henrotte J.G. Fed.

Med. 1994; 12: 441-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the latter of which can affect the ratio of T cell subsets in the circulation (25Greenleaf J.E. Jackson C.G. Lawless D. Med. Sci. Sports Exercise. 1995; 27: 194-199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas these external influences can alter plasma tonicity, even more extreme differences in extracellular tonicity occur within the organs of the gastrointestinal and urinary tract. It is possible that elevated tonicity could increase the level of vigilance of the immune cells patrolling these organs. Aside from HS, other conditions leading to cellular distress can result in ATP release (e.g. tissue injury or hypoxia during hemorrhagic shock) (27Bouma M.G. van den Wildenberg F.A. Buurman W.A. Shock. 1997; 8: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). ATP and its metabolites may allow the host to better cope with injury by increasing T cell function. Indeed, administration of ATP-MgCl2 or inhibition of adenosine kinase has been shown to improve survival after hemorrhagic shock and sepsis and to protect lungs from ischemia reperfusion injury (27Bouma M.G. van den Wildenberg F.A. Buurman W.A. Shock. 1997; 8: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 28Harkema J.M. Chaudry I.H. Crit.

Immunol. 1994; 152: 5853-5859PubMed Google Scholar). Because of its protective effects, the ATP metabolite, adenosine, has been termed the “retaliatory metabolite in ischemia-reperfusion” (27Bouma M.G. van den Wildenberg F.A. Buurman W.A. Shock. 1997; 8: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In trauma patients, hypertonic solutions can be used to rapidly restore lost blood volume (6Mattox K.L. Maningas P.A. Moore E.E. Mateer J.R. Marx J.A. Aprahamian C. Burch J.M. Pepe P.E. Ann. Surg. 1991; 213: 482-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The infusion of these solutions transiently increases plasma tonicity to levels that we report here to cause substantial ATP release from T cells. As observed with ATP-MgCl2 administration, hypertonic solutions can improve the outcome after hemorrhagic shock and sepsis in both animal models and patients (1Junger W.G. Coimbra R. Liu F.C. Herdon-Remelius C. Junger W. Junger H. Loomis W. Hoyt D.B. Altman A. Shock. 1997; 8: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 6Mattox K.L. Maningas P.A. Moore E.E. Mateer J.R. Marx J.A. Aprahamian C. Burch J.M. Pepe P.E. Ann. Surg. 1991; 213: 482-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The present study suggests that ATP release in response to hypertonic solutions could mediate these beneficialin vivo effects by enhancing the function of T cells. It has long been recognized that cells release ATP under pathological conditions that involve hypoxia, cell damage, loss of cell viability, and cytolysis (14Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar, 15Dubyak G.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C242-C244Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been noted that healthy cells release ATP under normal physiological conditions. Mechanical and osmotic stimulation have been shown to cause ATP release from several different cell types including endothelial and epithelial cells, fibroblasts, hepatocytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells (e.g. Refs. 12Yegutkin G. Bodin P. Burnstock G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 13Ostrom R.S. Gregorian C. Insel P.A. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2002; 282: C289-C301Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). There are at least three possible mechanisms for the regulated release of nucleotides under physiological conditions: exocytosis of ATP-filled vesicles, conductive transport through membrane ion channels, and facilitated diffusion by nucleotide-specific transporters. However, work to date has not precisely resolved which mechanism is operative (22Roman R.M. Feranchak A.P. Davison A. Schwiebert E.M. Fitz J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1222-G1230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Schwiebert E.M. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2001; 28: 340-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates for the first time that mechanical agitation and exposure to HS stimulate Jurkat T lymphocytes to release ATP in a manner that correlates with the level of hypertonicity to which the cells are exposed (Fig. 1). Similar ATP release patterns have been reported in response to direct mechanical stimulation of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells (13Ostrom R.S. Gregorian C. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11735-11739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 32Hamada K. Takuwa N. Yokoyama K. Takuwa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6334-6340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Exposure of mammalian cells to HS causes rapid cell shrinkage, which is accompanied by membrane deformation. Modest mechanical forces of hemodynamic origin and forces associated with increased perfusion flow rates have been shown to trigger ATP release from vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells (15Dubyak G.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C242-C244Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 32Hamada K. Takuwa N. Yokoyama K. Takuwa Y. J. Biol.

A. 1996; 93: 12020-12025Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Mechanical and hypertonic stimulation of T cells resulted in a rapid ATP release followed by a decrease toward base-line levels (Fig. 1). This decrease of extracellular ATP is presumed to occur via ATP hydrolysis by ecto-ATPases and ecto-5′-nucleotidases, such as CD39 and CD73, which may be expressed on the T cell membrane (18Di Virgilio F. Chiozzi P. Ferrari D. Falzoni S. Sanz J.M. Morelli A. Torboli M. Bolognesi G. Baricordi O.R. Blood. 2001; 97: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 21Zimmermann H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 231-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Other pathways for metabolism of extracellular nucleotides have been identified recently (e.g. Ref. 34Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31061-31068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). As with HS, the addition of exogenous ATP, its nonhydrolyzable analog ATPγS, and UTP significantly increased the ability of Jurkat cells to produce IL-2, and the addition of apyrase blunted this response (Figs.2 and 4). The results demonstrate that ATP release in response to osmotic stimulation can enhance IL-2 expression in an autocrine/paracrine fashion that probably involves P2 receptors expressed on the T cell surface. The ATP product adenosine (ADO) did not influence IL-2 expression (Fig. 2 B), and adenosine deaminase, a scavenger of adenosine, did not reduce the enhancing effect of HS on IL-2 production (Fig. 4 D), suggesting that adenosine and the adenosine or P1 receptors are not involved in the regulation of T cell function by HS. Based on their molecular structures, P2 receptors are divided into two subfamilies: the G protein-coupled heptahelical P2Y receptors and P2X receptors that are ligand-gated ion channels. Of the mammalian P2 receptors that have been cloned to date (14Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar), only P2X-like receptors (P2X1, P2X4, and P2X7) seem to be expressed by human T lymphocytes (18Di Virgilio F. Chiozzi P. Ferrari D. Falzoni S. Sanz J.M. Morelli A. Torboli M. Bolognesi G. Baricordi O.R. Blood. 2001; 97: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). We found that Jurkat cells express P2X7 and that P2X7-specific antagonists can attenuate the enhancing effect of HS on IL-2 expression (Fig. 5). These observations suggest that P2X7 may play an important role in the response of T cells to HS. HS triggered robust Ca2+ mobilization at HS levels that increased extracellular ATP concentrations to ∼2 μm(Fig. 1 B). In comparison, much higher concentrations of exogenous ATP were required for equivalent increases of intracellular Ca2+ levels (Fig. 3) or p38 MAPK activation (Fig. 6). This discrepancy could be due to differences of the ATP concentrations in proximity to the T cell membrane compared with the bulk media. Extracellular nucleotides can be hydrolyzed by ecto-ATPases and ecto-5′-nucleotidases that exist on the plasma membrane of cells (21Zimmermann H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 231-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar,34Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31061-31068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar); our data (Fig. 1) suggest the presence of such enzymes on Jurkat cells. ATP released in response to hypertonic stimulation is likely to achieve its highest concentrations in close proximity to the plasma membrane (i.e. adjacent to P2 receptors) (35Beigi R. Kobatake E. Aizawa M. Dubyak G.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C267-C278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This explanation is consistent with our observation that nonhydrolyzable ATPγS was about 50 times as effective as ATP in triggering Ca2+ mobilization in Jurkat cells. Mechanical stimulation of other cell types causes ATP release and the propagation of Ca2+ waves along monolayers, indicating that ATP-induced Ca2+ signaling can serve as a means of communication between neighboring cells (36Sauer H. Hescheler J. Wartenberg M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: C295-C307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data suggest that HS-induced ATP release may also serve as messenger between osmotically stressed cells. p38 MAPK is activated by cellular stresses, inflammatory cytokines, lipopolysaccharide, and G protein-coupled receptors (37Lee J.C. Young P.R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 38Yamauchi J. Nagao M. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27771-27777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Activated p38 MAPK in turn mediates cytokine production and other stress responses (19Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNutty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3147) Google Scholar, 38Yamauchi J. Nagao M. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27771-27777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). p38 MAPK is also activated by mechanical stimulation in a number of cell types (e.g. Refs. 39Sawada Y. Nakamura K. Doi K. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Saitoh M. Morita K. Komuro I. De Vos K. Sheetz M. Ichijo H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1221-1227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and40Volonte D. Galbiati F. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8094-8103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Mechanical stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cells recently has been shown to activate p38 MAPK through a mechanism that involves ATP release and a feedback mechanism involving extracellular ATP and adenosine (32Hamada K. Takuwa N. Yokoyama K. Takuwa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6334-6340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that a similar feedback mechanism may be involved in the response of Jurkat T cells to HS (Fig. 6). Inhibition of p38 MAPK with SB203580 prevented the enhancement of IL-2 expression by HS, consistent with the idea that p38 MAPK signaling plays a critical role in the response of T cells to HS. Overall, our results suggest a regulatory pathway where HS causes the release of ATP. ATP in turn activates P2 receptors that increase Ca2+ influx and the activation of p38 MAPK. Finally, p38 MAPK exerts a co-stimulatory signal that enhances IL-2 expression of CD3/CD28-stimulated T cells, thereby enhancing T cell function (Fig. 8). Existence of this pathway identifies new targets for the modulation of T cell function. We thank Tatjana Orlic, Jennifer Rietfors, and Dr. Yu Chen for excellent technical help."

The morphological features of apoptosis and demise of the cell are because of the cleavage of structural and non-structural proteins by a family of proteases called caspases (for review, see Ref. 1Núñez G. Benedict M.A., Hu, Y. Inohara N. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3237-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation by apoptotic stimuli, proximal caspases are activated and cleave downstream effector caspases leading to an amplification of proteolytic activity within the dying cells. Activation of proximal caspases requires upstream regulators that have domains homologous to those present in the N-terminal prodomains of proximal caspases, namely death effector domains (DEDs)1 and caspase recruitment domains (CARDs). Homophilic interactions between the CARDs or DEDs of upstream regulators and proximal caspases mediate caspase activation (1Núñez G. Benedict M.A., Hu, Y. Inohara N. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3237-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). For example, homophilic interactions between the DEDs of Fas-associated death domain protein and procaspase-8 and between the CARDs of Apaf-1 and procaspase-9 are essential for caspase activation (2Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10964-10967Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Activation of proximal caspases is thought to be induced via proximity of their catalytic subunits, a process that is mediated through oligomerization of their upstream regulators. For example, Fas-associated death domain protein and Apaf-1 contain a death domain (DD) and nucleotide-binding domain, respectively, that mediate their oligomerization in a ligand-dependent manner (1Núñez G. Benedict M.A., Hu, Y. Inohara N. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3237-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). Bioinformatic and protein structure analyses have revealed that the CARD, DED, and DD share similar structural and functional features (3Huang B. Eberstadt M. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W.

These domains are found not only in apoptosis regulators but also in proteins that are associated with inflammation, cell cycle regulation, and cytoskeletal organization (4Hofmann K. Bucher P.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Thus, these α-helix-rich domains mediate homophilic interactions between signaling components of diverse signaling pathways, most notably those involved in apoptosis and inflammation (8Hsu H.

The pyrin domain (also called DAPIN, PYRIN, and PAAD) was originally found in pyrin, the product of the familial Mediterranean fever-associated gene (12International FMF Consortium Cell. 1997; 90: 797-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar), and in ASC, a component of the “speck,” a granular structure induced in the cytosol of certain apoptotic cells (13Masumoto J.

Furthermore, the pyrin domain mediates homophilic interactions between pyrin domain-containing proteins (16Staub E. Dahl E. Rosenthal A. Trends Biochem.

Commun. 2001; 280: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, the functional significance of these pyrin-pyrin homophilic interactions is presently poorly understood. The vertebrate zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a model organism whose genome encodes the great majority of the components that mediate apoptosis and inflammation in mammals including humans (10Inohara N. Núñez G. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 509-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 21Aravind L. Dixit V.M. Koonin E.V. Science. 2001; 291: 1279-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Thus, analysis of zebrafish components should provide insight into the mechanisms that mediate apoptosis and inflammation in mammalian systems. Here we report the identification and initial characterization of the zebrafish orthologue of ASC (zAsc) and two zebrafish pyrin-containing caspases, Caspy and Caspy2. We provide evidence that zAsc associates with and activates Caspy through a homophilic pyrin-pyrin domain interaction. In addition, we show that Caspy is required for normal development of the jaw and pharyngeal arches. Zebrafish genes with homology to the pyrin domain of human ASC were searched in public data bases of ESTs, using the program TBLASTN (National Center for Biotechnology Information). The nucleotide sequences of the EST clones AW174631,AI384922 (zAsc), AI331460 (Caspy), and BF156256 (Caspy2) were determined by dideoxy sequencing. The entire open reading frames of zebrafish Caspy, Caspy2, and zAsc were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a cDNA pool prepared from the whole body of an adult zebrafish.

Bull. 1999; 48: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected, and immunoprecipitation assay was performed as described with slight modifications (27Masumoto J. Taniguchi S. Nakayama K. Ayukawa K. Sagara J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001. 2001; 262: 128-133Google Scholar). The total amount of transfected plasmid DNA was adjusted with pcDNA3 to always be the same within individual experiments. 1 × 106 COS-7 cells were transfected with 2.4 μg of expression plasmids using LipofectAMINE-PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The supernatant was immunoprecipitated with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) conjugated with anti-Myc polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to 16% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis and detected by Western blotting using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma). For cellular localization assay, COS-7 cells were transiently cotransfected with pEGFP-zAsc and pEGFP-Caspy. For coexpression assay, COS-7 cells were transiently cotransfected with pDsRed-zAsc and pEGFP-Caspy. After 24 h, cells were fixed with 70% ethanol. Signals were detected by immunofluorescence microscopy. Cell death assays with 293T cells were performed as described (28Inohara N. Koseki T., Hu, Y. Chen S. Núñez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10717-10722Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). For Fig. 4 B, transfected cells were incubated with 20 μm zVAD-fmk (benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-(OMe)-fluoromethylketone) or left untreated. FLAG-Caspy and Caspy2-Myc were purified by immunoprecipitation from 293T cells transfected by pcDNA3-FLAG-Caspy and pcDNA3-Caspy2-Myc, respectively, as described above, and caspase enzymatic assays were performed as described (29Wu D. Wallen H.D. Inohara N. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21449-21454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) using caspase-type-specific substrates (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) indicated in the figure legends. The concentration of the cleavage products was estimated from comparison with the fluorescence of AMC (7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin) or AFC (7-amino-4-(trimethyl-fluoromethyl) coumarin) standards. Each morpholino (Gene Tools, LLC) was resuspended in sterile water to a concentration of 1 mm. For injections, the stock solution was diluted to 250 nm in Danieau buffer. A 3-nl volume of the solution was injected into one to four cell-stage embryos at the yolk and cytoplasm interface. The sequences ofcaspy and control morpholino oligonucleotides were 5′-GCCATGTTTAGCTCAGGGCGCTGAC-3′ and 5′-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3′, respectively. For the morphological assay, larvae were euthanized in tricane, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and washed for 3 min in acid-alcohol (0.37% HCl, 70% ethanol). The fixed larvae were stained for 1 h with 0.1% Alcian blue. After rinsing in ethanol, animals were suspended in 50% glycerol, 0.25% KOH overnight. Stained preparations were clarified with 1% H2O2 and mounted in glycerol-KOH. To identify novel pyrin domain-containing proteins in zebrafish, we screened the zebrafish GenBankTM EST data base for cDNAs encoding amino acid sequences with homology to the pyrin domain (amino acids 1–91) of human ASC by the program TBLASTN. We identified the zebrafish orthologue of human ASC (referred to here as zAsc) and two zebrafish caspases (designated here as Caspy and Caspy2). Sequence analysis of zAsc cDNA revealed that it encodes a protein of 203 amino acid residues composed of a N-terminal pyrin domain linked to a C-terminal CARD as reported for its mammalian orthologues (GenBankTM accession numbers were as follows: human ASC, AB023416; mouse ASC, AB032249; bovine ASC,AB050006; rat ASC, AB053165). Caspy and Caspy2 contained N-terminal pyrin domains and C-terminal caspase catalytic domains (Fig. 1 A). The N-terminal pyrin domain of Caspy was most homologous to that present in zAsc (87% similarity) whereas that of Caspy2 was most homologous to that of human Cryopyrin/PYPAF1 (46% similarity), a pyrin-domain containing Nod-family protein (30Hoffman H.M. Mueller J.L. Broide D.H. Wanderer A.A. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar, 31Manji G.A. Wang L. Geddes B.J. Brown M. Merriam S., Al- Garawi A.

Comparison of these zebrafish and human caspases showed that the catalytic domains of Caspy and Caspy2 share highest homology with those of human caspase-1 and caspase-5, respectively (54 and 57% similarity, respectively). Caspy and Caspy2 contained conserved His and Cys amino acid residues, which are essential for proteolytic catalysis (depicted by arrows in Fig. 1 A), and also conserved residues, which are essential for interaction with critical core residues of substrates, suggesting that both Caspy and Caspy2 are enzymatically active. Notably, Caspy, like human caspase-1, has His at position 318, corresponding to the residue at position 342, which binds the specific P3 residue of the substrate (Ala of YVAD) in human caspase-1 (32Wilson K.P. Black J.F. Thomson J.A. Kim E.E. Griffith J.P. Navia M.A. Murcko M.A. Chambers S.P. Aldape R.A. Raybuck S.A. Livingston D.J. Nature. 1994; 370: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar), whereas Caspy2 and human caspase-5, which can not digest peptides carrying Ala residue at P3 (33Thornberry N.A. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 100-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), have Asn and Asp residues, respectively, at the corresponding positions (arrowhead; see Fig. 1 A). Genomic mapping experiments using the heat shock doubled haploid meiotic mapping panel revealed that caspyand caspy2 are located on linkage groups 16 and 1, respectively (Fig. 2). HumanCASP1 and CASP5, which are homologues ofcaspy and caspy2, are located as tandem genes on human chromosome 11. We did not find any conclusive evidence supporting conserved syntenies between the zebrafish and human regions containing the zebrafish and human caspase genes (Fig. 2). Notably,caspy was adjacent to asc on linkage group 16 (z06s003336 at www.ensembl.org/Danio_rerio/blastview), whereas the human orthologue of asc is located on chromosome 16. Sequence analysis also showed that the pyrin domain of Caspy2 exhibited significant homology not only to pyrin domains but also to the CARDs of Xenopus caspase-1 (49% similarity) and bovine caspase-13 (45% similarity, previously known as human caspase-13) (Fig. 1 B). Thus, both the pyrin domain and CARD are predicted to be α-helix rich and to share a similar organization in their predicted secondary structure (Fig. 1 B). We performed in situ hybridization to assess the expression of zAsc, Caspy, and Caspy2 mRNA in zebrafish embryos. At embryonic development of 48 and 72 h post-fertilization, zAsc (Fig. 3, A–C), Caspy (Fig. 3, E–G), and Caspy2 (Fig. 3,I–K) mRNA exhibited a similar labeling pattern with expression being detected primarily in epidermis (arrows), mouth (single arrowhead), and pharyngeal arches (white arrowheads) shown in Fig. 3. Significantly, the expression ofasc and caspy2 appeared stronger than that observed for caspy. Similar results were observed in embryos at 36 h post-fertilization. 2W. Zhou and J. Y. Kuwada, unpublished data. The expression pattern of asc (Fig. 3, A andB) is consistent with that of human ASC, which was reported to be expressed in epithelial cells including squamous epithelium of skin and mouth (34Masumoto J. Taniguchi S. Nakayama J. Shiohara M. Hidaka E. Katsuyama T. Murase S. Sagara J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2001; 49: 1269-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To begin to assess the molecular function of Caspy and Caspy2, we constructed expression plasmids of tagged and non-tagged Caspy and Caspy2 and transiently transfected the plasmids into 293T cells, respectively. A significant percentage of Caspy- and Caspy2-transfected cells displayed morphological features of adherent cells undergoing apoptosis such as rounding, membrane blebbing, and detachment from the dish (Fig. 4 A). At 24 h post-transfection, about 20–40 and 95% of the cells transfected with the highest dose of both tagged and non-tagged Caspy and Caspy2 constructs, respectively, displayed morphological features of apoptosis compared with less than 1% of the cells transfected with control plasmid (Fig. 4 A). To determine whether the proapoptotic activity of Caspy and Caspy2 is because of the their enzymatic activities, the ability of these proteins to induce apoptosis was tested in the presence of the caspase inhibitors, p35, CrmA, and zVAD-fmk. Expression of baculoviral p35 attenuated apoptosis induced by both Caspy and Caspy2 whereas incubation with zVAD-fmk greatly inhibited apoptosis (Fig. 4 B). Interestingly, CrmA, an inhibitor of human caspase-1 and certain caspases (35Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E.P. Leiting B. Ruel R. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32608-32613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar), inhibited apoptosis induced by Caspy but not by Caspy2 (Fig. 4 B). These data were also similar compared with the results using non-tagged Caspy and non-tagged Caspy2 (Fig. 4 B). These results suggest that apoptosis induced by Caspy and Caspy2 is dependent on caspase activity and that the proapoptotic activity of Caspy and Caspy2 can be dissociated based on the inhibition with CrmA. To test more directly whether Caspy and Caspy2 are active enzymes, a panel of fluorogenic peptide substrates of mammalian caspases were incubated with Caspy or Caspy2 immunoprecipitated from extracts of cells transfected with plasmids producing the relevant caspases. Both caspases cleaved several caspase peptide substrates, demonstrating that Caspy and Caspy2 are active caspases (Fig. 4,C and D). Notably, Caspy preferentially cleaved AcYVAD-AMC, a caspase-1 substrate, whereas Caspy2 was more active on AcWEHD-AFC, a preferred substrate of caspase-5, and it did not cleave AcYVAD-AMC (Fig. 4, C and D). These results suggest that Caspy and Caspy2 are enzymatically active caspases that exhibit different substrate specificity. Because Caspy and Caspy2 contain a pyrin domain highly homologous to that of zAsc, the ability of both caspases to interact with zAsc was tested using a co-immunoprecipitation assay. zAsc was co-immunoprecipitated with Caspy but not with Caspy2 (Fig. 5). Mutational analysis revealed that a zAsc mutant containing the pyrin domain but lacking the CARD was co-immunoprecipitated with Caspy (Fig. 5, FLAG-zAsc-PD), suggesting that the pyrin domain of zAsc mediates the binding to Caspy. Furthermore, a zAsc mutant-lacking pyrin domain did not co-immunoprecipitate with Caspy (Fig. 5, FLAG-zAsc-ΔPD), indicating the pyrin domain of zAsc is necessary and sufficient for the interaction with Caspy. In addition, a Caspy mutant lacking the pyrin domain (Fig. 5, Myc-Caspy-ΔPD) failed to interact with a zAsc mutant containing a pyrin domain (Fig. 5, FLAG-zAsc-PD) suggesting that zAsc and Caspy associate through a homophilic pyrin-pyrin domain interaction. To further assess the association between zAsc and Caspy, we constructed plasmids to express GFP-Caspy, GFP-zAsc, and DsRed-zAsc fusion proteins to facilitate the analysis of their subcellular localization. Expression of GFP-Caspy and GFP-zAsc induced the formation of specks (Fig. 6 B, GFP-Caspy andGFP-zAsc, respectively), and double labeling analysis of the same cells revealed that both GFP-Caspy (Fig. 6 A,Green) and DsRed-zAsc (Fig. 6 A, Red) co-localized to the same speck visualized in yellow (Fig. 6 A, Merge). These observation demonstrates that zAsc interacts with Caspy in the same speck.Figure 6Co-localization of Caspy and zAsc.A, co-expression of both the GFP-Caspy and the DsRed-zAsc in COS-7 cells. 1 × 103 COS-7 cells were transiently co-transfected with 4.8 ng of pEGFP-Caspy (Green) and pDsRed-zAsc (Red). After 24 h, cells were fixed with 70% ethanol. Blue nuclei were stained by DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride) (Blue). Signals were detected by immunofluorescence microscopy. Green fluorescence, red fluorescence, and blue fluorescence were visualized in the same field (Merge). GFP-Caspy signal (Green) and DsRed-zAsc signal (Red) accumulate in the same speck (arrowheads). B, as controls, cells were transiently transfected with pEGFP or pDsRed as a vector control. Diffuse green or red florescent signals were detected in the cells (GFP and DsRed, respectively). Cells were transiently transfected with pEGFP-zAsc alone or pEGFP-Caspy alone (GFP-zAsc and GFP-Caspy, respectively). Green fluorescence signals were detected in the cells (arrowheads).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the functional relevance of the interaction between Caspy and zAsc, we first tested whether co-expression of zAsc enhances apoptosis induced by Caspy and Caspy2. In these experiments we expressed low amounts of plasmid so that we could assess whether zAsc could enhance tagged and non-tagged Caspy- and Caspy2-induced apoptosis. Under these experimental conditions, expression of zAsc did not augment apoptosis induced by either Caspy or Caspy2 (Fig. 7,A and B). This result suggested that the interaction between Caspy and zAsc was not sufficient to induce caspase activation. Enforced oligomerization of the CARD of Apaf-1 and that of the DD of Fas, which are protein modules structurally related to the pyrin domain, is known to induce the activation of target caspases (36Hu Y. Benedict M.A. Ding L. Núñez G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3586-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar,37Muzio M. Stockwell B.R. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2926-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that zAsc might similarly promote Caspy activation through zAsc oligomerization. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a plasmid to express a zAsc-Fpk3 fusion protein that can be oligomerized with the ligand AP1510 (14Inohara N. Koseki T. Lin J. del Peso L. Lucas P.C. Chen F.F. Ogura Y. Núñez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27823-27831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Co-expression of zAsc-Fpk3, like that of zAsc, did not enhance apoptosis induced by Caspy in the absence of AP1510 (Fig. 7, A and B). In contrast, greater than 50% of the cells underwent apoptosis when both zAsc-Fpk3 and Caspy were co-expressed in the presence of AP1510 (Fig. 7,A and B). In control experiments, co-expression of zAsc-Fpk3 did not enhance the ability of Caspy2 or caspase-9 to induce apoptosis in the presence of AP1510 (Fig. 7 B). In reciprocal experiments, co-expression of Apaf-1, a regulator of caspase-9, enhanced apoptosis induced by caspase-9, but it did not augment Caspy- or Caspy2-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 7 B). These results suggest that oligomerization of zAsc is required for enhancement of Caspy-dependent apoptosis. Oligomerization of zAsc is presumably induced through an interaction between the C-terminal CARD of zAsc and a putative upstream regulator that needs to be identified. Because Caspy2 did not interact with zAsc, we suggest that Caspy2, which possesses caspase-5 like enzymatic activity, mediates apoptosis and/or inflammation in a zAsc-independent manner. To examine whether the activation of Caspy is enhanced by zAsc, we determined whether oligomerization of zAsc induces the processing of Caspy. Analysis of cell extracts by immunoblotting revealed that a processed form of Caspy was immunodetected in extracts from cells co-expressing zAsc-Fpk3 and Caspy in the presence but not in the absence of dimerizer AP1510 (Fig. 7 C). When Caspy was immunoprecipitated with antibody, processing of Caspy was observed in extracts from cells co-expressing Caspy and zAsc even in the absence of the dimerizer (Fig. 7 C). A possible explanation for the latter finding is that Caspy activation can be induced through antibody-mediated aggregation of zAsc-Caspy complexes in vitro resulting from the immunoprecipitation procedure. Significantly, zAsc was still required for processing of Caspy in vitro, suggesting that the interaction of zAsc with Caspy is important for caspase processing and activation. To assess whether Caspy was required for normal development of zebrafish, we designed a morpholino antisense oligonucleotide to interfere with caspy translation. Microinjection of the blocking antisense oligonucleotide into one- to four-cell stage embryos resulted in an open mouth phenotype as observed by simple morphological examination of larvae at 6 days post-injection. This phenotype was observed at least 4 days post-injection. To assess the phenotype in more detail, we injectedcaspy and control morpholino oligonucleotides into early cleavage embryos and stained the head cartilage of the resulting larvae with Alcian blue. The analysis revealed that 12/19 larvae injected with the caspy antisense morpholino exhibited several abnormalities in the development of the cartilaginous pharyngeal skeleton. The abnormal phenotype included deformed and thinned Meckel's and palatoquadrate cartilages, which form the jaw, deformed ceratohyal cartilages, which are pointing posteriorly, and disorganized branchial cartilages (Fig. 8). The larvae were still alive approximately 1 week post-fertilization but then started to die as yolk disappeared. Of the seven remaining larvae derived from early embryos injected with the caspy antisense oligonucleotide, 5/19 showed a similar but less marked phenotype, whereas 2/19 larvae appeared normal. The phenotype is consistent with the expression of caspy in the pharyngeal arches (Fig. 3). No other abnormalities were identified in any other part of the body including the brain, eyes, or pectoral fins of the larvae injected with the caspy antisense oligonucleotide. The latter is consistent with the observation that caspy is not expressed in the brain, eyes, or pectoral fins during embryonic development (Fig. 3). None of the embryos injected with control morpholino oligonucleotide showed any alteration in the cartilaginous structures of the jaw or gills. In this report we provide evidence that the zebrafish ASC mediates the activation of Caspy, a pyrin domain-containing caspase. Although mammalian orthologues of zebrafish Caspy have not been yet identified, ASC is highly conserved in vertebrates. It is possible that mammals have Caspy-like molecules with typical pyrin domains, but they need to be identified. Because the CARD is highly related to the pyrin domain, it is also possible that one of the mammalian CARD-containing caspases is the Caspy orthologue. Caspy exhibits the highest homology to human caspase-1 and preferentially cleaved caspase-1 substrates whereas Caspy2 showed the highest homology to human caspase-5 and preference for caspase-5-like substrates. Apoptosis induced by Caspy was blocked by CrmA, a caspase inhibitor that inhibits human caspase-1 at low concentrations (35Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E.P. Leiting B. Ruel R. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32608-32613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 B). Both caspase-1 and caspase-5 belong to the same subfamily of CARD-containing caspases (33Thornberry N.A. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 100-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but their activator(s) are unknown or are poorly understood. Thus, it will be important to test for interactions between these known CARD-containing caspases and mammalian ASC. zAsc, like its mammalian orthologues, is composed of an N-terminal pyrin domain linked to a C-terminal CARD. Recent studies of the three-dimensional structure of several apoptosis regulators have suggested that the stoichiometry of the homophilic interaction between the CARD and related domains is one by one (38Chou J.J. Matsuo H. Duan H. Wagner G. Cell. 1998; 94: 171-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 39Zhou P. Chou J. Olea R.S. Yuan J. Wagner G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11265-11270Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is unlikely that the pyrin domain of zAsc binds to other pyrin or CARD-containing factors in the Caspy/zAsc signaling complex. Enforced oligomerization of zAsc enhanced Caspy-induced apoptosis. These findings suggest that the C-terminal CARD of zAsc and that of its mammalian orthologues might be important for oligomerization. In this model, zAsc acts as an adaptor molecule linking a putative upstream factor to caspases such as Caspy. Potential upstream factors include Defcap/NAC/CARD7/NALP1 and Ipaf-1/CARD12/CLAN, Cryopyrin/PYPAF1, CARD-, or pyrin domain-containing proteins with structural homology to a family of Apaf-1-like molecules that include Nod1 and Nod2 (9Inohara N.

Chem. 2001; 276: 4812-4818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). Such a factor may interact via its CARD with Caspy, an event that may lead to zAsc oligomerization and association with Caspy, leading to caspase activation. Alternatively, self-oligomerization of zAsc might be mediated via its CARD, which might be induced by upstream molecules such as protein kinases or other factors. Consistent with the latter, it has been shown that a mutant form of human ASC carrying the CARD alone can self-associate (20Masumoto J. Taniguchi S. Sagara J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Further studies are required to understand the mechanism by which caspases are activated by zAsc and its mammalian orthologues. Analysis of animals in which caspy activity was knocked down by morpholino antisense oligonucleotide revealed abnormal development of the pharyngeal skeleton containing the jaw and branchial arches. The pharyngeal skeleton in vertebrates derives from migrating neural crest cells, and its development involves a complex program of interactions among neural crest cells, mesodermal mesenchyme, and surrounding epithelia (46Le Douarin N.M. Dupin E. Ziller C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 685-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The abnormal phenotype involving the anterior and posterior arch cartilages indicates that Caspy is required for proper development of neural crest derivatives. It is possible that Caspy is involved in the execution of a program of neural crest cell death required for proper development and assembly of the cartilages. For example, cell death may be required to release the ceratohyal from ventral attachment to the basibranchials allowing it to assume its normal anterior projection. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) analysis did not reveal any differences in the level of apoptosis betweencaspy knocked-down and control morphants.2However, we cannot rule out a subtle defect in apoptosis that was not revealed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling analysis. Another possibility is that Caspy is involved in processing a zebrafish homologue of interleukin-1/interleukin-18 and/or another factor that is required for normal development of pharyngeal arch cartilages. For example, mutant mice deficient in the endothelin-1 converting enzyme, which processes the endothelin-1 precursor to biologically active endothelin-1, exhibit defects in branchial arch-derived craniofacial tissues (47Yanagisawa H. Yanagisawa M. Kapur R.P. Richardson J.A. Williams S.C. Clouthier D.E. de Wit D. Emoto N. Hammer R.E. Development. 1998; 125: 825-836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, endothelin-1 is essential for development of the ventral aspect of zebrafish pharyngeal arches (48Miller C.T. Schilling T.F. Lee K. Parker J. Kimmel C.B. Development. 2000; 127: 3815-3828PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic screens in the zebrafish have revealed a large number of loci required for pharyngeal arch development (49Schilling T.F. Piotrowski T. Grandel H. Brand M. Heisenberg C.P. Jiang Y.J. Beuchle D. Hammerschmidt M. Kane D.A. Mullins M.C. van Eeden F.J. Kelsh R.N. Furutani-Seiki M. Granato M. Haffter P. Odenthal J. Warga R.M. Trowe T.

Some of the mutant fish exhibit phenotypes that are similar but not identical to that observed in caspymorpholino knocked-down animals. Thus, it is possible that Caspy is a component of a signaling pathway that includes some of the genes identified in the genetic screens. Additional studies are needed to understand the precise role of Caspy in the genetic program involved in the development of the jaw and branchial arch cartilages. We thank V.

https://openalex.org/W2020791282,"Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), the enzyme catalyzing the initial step in the biosynthesis of sphingolipids, comprises two different subunits, LCB1 and LCB2. LCB1 has a single highly hydrophobic domain near the N terminus. Chinese hamster ovary cell mutant LY-B cells are defective in SPT activity because of the lack of expression of an endogenous LCB1 subunit. Stable expression of LCB1 having an epitope tag at either the N or C terminus restored SPT activity of LY-B cells, suggesting that the epitope tag did not affect the localization or topology of LCB1. Indirect immunostaining showed that the N- and C-terminal epitopes are oriented toward the lumenal and cytosol side, respectively, at the endoplasmic reticulum. Interestingly, there was far less LCB2 in LY-B cells than in wild-type cells, and the amount of LCB2 in LY-B cells was restored to the wild-type level by transfection with LCB1 cDNA. In addition, overproduction of the LCB2 subunit required co-overproduction of the LCB1 subunit. These results indicated that the LCB1 subunit is most likely an integral protein having a single transmembrane domain with a lumenal orientation of its N terminus in the endoplasmic reticulum and that the LCB1 subunit is indispensable for the maintenance of the LCB2 subunit in mammalian cells. Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), the enzyme catalyzing the initial step in the biosynthesis of sphingolipids, comprises two different subunits, LCB1 and LCB2. LCB1 has a single highly hydrophobic domain near the N terminus. Chinese hamster ovary cell mutant LY-B cells are defective in SPT activity because of the lack of expression of an endogenous LCB1 subunit. Stable expression of LCB1 having an epitope tag at either the N or C terminus restored SPT activity of LY-B cells, suggesting that the epitope tag did not affect the localization or topology of LCB1. Indirect immunostaining showed that the N- and C-terminal epitopes are oriented toward the lumenal and cytosol side, respectively, at the endoplasmic reticulum. Interestingly, there was far less LCB2 in LY-B cells than in wild-type cells, and the amount of LCB2 in LY-B cells was restored to the wild-type level by transfection with LCB1 cDNA. In addition, overproduction of the LCB2 subunit required co-overproduction of the LCB1 subunit. These results indicated that the LCB1 subunit is most likely an integral protein having a single transmembrane domain with a lumenal orientation of its N terminus in the endoplasmic reticulum and that the LCB1 subunit is indispensable for the maintenance of the LCB2 subunit in mammalian cells. serine palmitoyltransferase coenzyme A endoplasmic reticulum Chinese hamster ovary pyridoxal phosphate PLP-dependent α-oxoamine synthase transmembrane domain hemagglutinin phosphate-buffered saline bovine serum albumin Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT)1 is the enzyme catalyzing the initial step of sphingolipid biosynthesis and catalyzes the condensation of palmitoyl coenzyme A (CoA) withl-serine to generate 3-ketodihydrosphingosine (1Merrill A.H., Jr. J.

The subfamily members including SPT catalyze similar reactions, the condensation of carboxyl CoA thioesters with amino acids to generate α-oxoamines. Eukaryote SPT is a membrane-bound enzyme consisting of different subunits, whereas other members of the PLP-dependent α-oxoamine synthase (POAS) family are soluble homodimers. Curiously, although the LCB2 subunit of SPT has the PLP-binding motif conserved in the POAS family, the LCB1 subunit does not (2Hanada K. Hara T. Nishijima M. Kuge O. Dickson R.C. Nagiec M.M. J.

In addition, the Gram-negative bacteriumSphingomonus paucimobilis produces a soluble SPT as a homodimer of a protein having the PLP-binding motif (13Ikushiro H. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18249-18256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the LCB1 subunit has a function(s) specific for the heterosubunit type of SPT. However, it remains poorly understood why mammalian SPT comprises an LCB1 subunit, as well as the LCB2 subunit, having the PLP-binding motif.Previous biochemical studies have shown that SPT is a membrane-bound protein enriched in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (14Williams R.D.

Consistently, hydrophobic profiles of deduced amino acid sequences predict that both the LCB1 and LCB2 subunits contain, at least, single transmembrane domain (TMD) motifs (2Hanada K. Hara T.

However, the number of possible TMDs depends on algorithms used for prediction, indicating the necessity of experimental approaches to determine the topology of the SPT subunits.In the present study, we determine the topology of the LCB1 subunit experimentally. In addition, we show that the LCB1 subunit of mammalian SPT is indispensable for the maintenance of the LCB2 subunit.DISCUSSIONAlthough hydrophobic profiles of the primary structure of membrane-bound proteins predict possible TMDs and also their membrane topology, different algorithms sometimes give different predictions (21Chen C.P. Rost B. Appl. Bioinform. 2002; 1: 21-35PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ott C.M. Lingappa V.R. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2003-2009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, for the elucidation of topology of membrane proteins, experimental approaches remain indispensable. In the present study, we determined the orientation of the N and C termini of the hamster LCB1 subunit by using epitope-tagged constructs (Fig. 4) and also showed the predominant distribution of this protein in the ER at the confocal microscopic level (Fig. 5). The ER localization of the LCB1 subunit is consistent with previous studies showing that SPT activity is enriched in the ER fraction among various subcellular fractions (14Williams R.D. Wang E. Merrill A.H., Jr. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 228: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 15Mandon E.C. Ehses I. Rother J. van Echten G. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11144-11148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From the hydropathy profile of the LCB1 protein, together with our experimental results shown above, we conclude that hamster LCB1 is an integral protein having a single TMD with a lumenal orientation of its N terminus in the ER. One might imagine other possible models, in which the protein had three or five TDMs, because LCB1 has several moderately hydrophobic regions (Fig. 1 A). However, such regions (includingHD2-4 in Fig. 1 A) show significant similarities to corresponding regions of soluble enzymes of the POAS family in sequence alignments. In contrast, the highly hydrophobic domain of the LCB1 protein (HD1 in Fig. 1 A) has no similarity to any other member of the family. These bioinformatic analyses strongly suggest the moderately hydrophobic regions of the LCB1 protein serve as internal domains of a globular part of the protein, not as TMDs, although further studies would be needed to prove this prediction.The topological assignment we made above is most likely valid in LCB1 proteins of other organisms, because hamster LCB1 has ∼95% identity to human and mouse LCB1 and 35% identity to yeast Lcb1p at the amino acid level (2Hanada K. Hara T. Nishijima M. Kuge O. Dickson R.C. Nagiec M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32108-32114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 5Weiss B. Stoffel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). From the topological model for the LCB1 subunit, the catalytic site of SPT can be deduced to be oriented to the cytosolic space at the ER, assuming that the catalytic site of mammalian SPT is formed at the interface of the LCB1 and LCB2 subunits as discussed below. This deduction is consistent with a previous study (15Mandon E.C. Ehses I. Rother J. van Echten G. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11144-11148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showing that SPT bound to isolated intact microsomes is inactivated by externally added proteases. The cytosolic orientation of the catalytic site of SPT is probably relevant to the accessibility of enzyme substrates, because the cytosol is the major pool of serine and palmitoyl CoA in cells.In the present study, we obtained evidence that the LCB1 subunit is required for the maintenance of the LCB2 subunit in mammalian cells. First, the amount of LCB2 in CHO mutant cells lacking the endogenous LCB1 subunit was found to be far lower than the wild-type level (see Fig. 2 B and Fig. 6 A). When the LCB1 subunit was expressed in the mutant cells by transfection, the LCB2 level was restored to the wild-type level (see Fig. 2 B and Fig. 6 A). In addition, overproduction of the LCB2 subunit in CHO cells required overproduction of the LCB1 subunit (see Figs. 7 and 8). The requirement of LCB1 expression for the maintenance of the LCB2 subunit was unlikely because of a possible transcriptional regulation of the LCB2 gene by the level of the LCB1 subunit, because the LCB2 mRNA level in LY-B cells is similar to that in CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 6 B). In addition, LCB1-dependent alteration of the LCB2 subunit was observed even when the expression of cLCB1 and cLCB2 was driven by an SV40-derived promoter (see Figs. 7 and 8). Probably, post-transcriptional events cause the alteration of the LCB2 subunit. Taking account of the fact that almost all of the overproduced LCB2 protein molecules are associated with the LCB1 subunit (Fig. 8), we suggest that the LCB2 subunit is unstable unless it is associated with the LCB1 subunit.The nature of the LCB2 subunit, which requires the LCB1 subunit for maintenance, may be conserved among eukaryotes, because a lack of Lcb1p also causes a reduction in Lcb2p in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (23Gable K. Slife H. Bacikova D. Monaghan E. Dunn T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7597-7603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). By contrast, the LCB1 subunit can be highly overproduced without co-overproduction of the LCB2 subunit (see Figs. 7and 8). These results suggest that, if a pool of free LCB1 subunit is available, cells can regulate the level of LCB1/LCB2 complex through transcriptional regulation of the LCB2 gene even without parallel regulation of LCB1. This scenario might account for the previously reported observation that the change in SPT activity in response to ultraviolet irradiation parallels the change in theLCB2 mRNA level but not the LCB1 mRNA level in cultured human keratinocytes (24Farrell A.M. Uchida Y. Nagiec M.M. Harris I.R. Dickson R.C. Elias P.M. Holleran W.M. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2031-2038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nature of the LCB2 subunit could also serve to prevent harmful side reactions by free LCB2 having a latently reactive PLP. The LCB1 subunit has no PLP-binding motif and, therefore, is theoretically inert. Thus, free LCB1 might not be severely toxic.We previously demonstrated that hamster LCB1 forms a complex with hamster LCB2 at a molecular ratio of 1:1 (4Hanada K. Hara T. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8409-8415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the present study, we further showed that, when expressed in wild-type CHO cells, a FLAG-tagged LCB1 was co-immunoprecipitated with the endogenous (and also co-overproduced) LCB2 but not any endogenous LCB1 (Fig. 8). These results demonstrate that two LCB1 molecules are not simultaneously integrated into one LCB1/LCB2 complex, consistent with the results observed in a yeast system (9Gable K. Han G. Monaghan E. Bacikova D. Natarajan M. Williams R. Dunn T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10194-10200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although additional gene product, Tsc3p, is required for the optimum activity of SPT in yeast cells (23Gable K. Slife H. Bacikova D. Monaghan E. Dunn T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7597-7603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), no mammalian homolog of Tsc3 has been found even in the human genome data base. Moreover, no proteins except for LCB1 and LCB2 proteins were detected in silver staining patterns of purified hamster SPT (4Hanada K. Hara T. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8409-8415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Collectively, it is most likely that mammalian SPT is a heterodimer of the LCB1 and LCB2 subunits, although as yet unknown factors might associate with the LCB1/LCB2 complex to regulate the activity of SPT in vivo.Analysis of the tertiary structure of bacterial oxononanoate synthase, a member of the POAS family, has revealed that the catalytic site forms at the interface of each subunit of this homodimer enzyme (25Alexeev D. Alexeeva M. Baxter R.L. Campopiano D.J. Webster S.P. Sawyer L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 401-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 26Webster S.P. Alexeev D. Campopiano D.J. Watt R.M. Alexeeva M. Sawyer L. Baxter R.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 516-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). By analogy, SPT is suggested to form its catalytic site at the interface of the subunits in the LCB1/LCB2 heterodimer. If so, the LCB1 subunit may play crucial roles in the formation of the enzyme catalytic site, besides the role in the maintenance of the LCB2 subunit. This is supported by recent studies showing that several specific missense mutations in LCB1 confer dominant negative effects on SPT activity without affecting the steady state level of LCB2 subunit in yeast (9Gable K.

These results suggest that the LCB1 subunit has a function(s) specific for the heterosubunit type of SPT. However, it remains poorly understood why mammalian SPT comprises an LCB1 subunit, as well as the LCB2 subunit, having the PLP-binding motif.

However, the number of possible TMDs depends on algorithms used for prediction, indicating the necessity of experimental approaches to determine the topology of the SPT subunits. In the present study, we determine the topology of the LCB1 subunit experimentally. In addition, we show that the LCB1 subunit of mammalian SPT is indispensable for the maintenance of the LCB2 subunit. DISCUSSIONAlthough hydrophobic profiles of the primary structure of membrane-bound proteins predict possible TMDs and also their membrane topology, different algorithms sometimes give different predictions (21Chen C.P.

Therefore, for the elucidation of topology of membrane proteins, experimental approaches remain indispensable. In the present study, we determined the orientation of the N and C termini of the hamster LCB1 subunit by using epitope-tagged constructs (Fig. 4) and also showed the predominant distribution of this protein in the ER at the confocal microscopic level (Fig. 5). The ER localization of the LCB1 subunit is consistent with previous studies showing that SPT activity is enriched in the ER fraction among various subcellular fractions (14Williams R.D. Wang E.

Chem. 1992; 267: 11144-11148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From the hydropathy profile of the LCB1 protein, together with our experimental results shown above, we conclude that hamster LCB1 is an integral protein having a single TMD with a lumenal orientation of its N terminus in the ER. One might imagine other possible models, in which the protein had three or five TDMs, because LCB1 has several moderately hydrophobic regions (Fig. 1 A). However, such regions (includingHD2-4 in Fig. 1 A) show significant similarities to corresponding regions of soluble enzymes of the POAS family in sequence alignments. In contrast, the highly hydrophobic domain of the LCB1 protein (HD1 in Fig. 1 A) has no similarity to any other member of the family. These bioinformatic analyses strongly suggest the moderately hydrophobic regions of the LCB1 protein serve as internal domains of a globular part of the protein, not as TMDs, although further studies would be needed to prove this prediction.The topological assignment we made above is most likely valid in LCB1 proteins of other organisms, because hamster LCB1 has ∼95% identity to human and mouse LCB1 and 35% identity to yeast Lcb1p at the amino acid level (2Hanada K. Hara T. Nishijima M. Kuge O. Dickson R.C. Nagiec M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32108-32114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 5Weiss B. Stoffel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). From the topological model for the LCB1 subunit, the catalytic site of SPT can be deduced to be oriented to the cytosolic space at the ER, assuming that the catalytic site of mammalian SPT is formed at the interface of the LCB1 and LCB2 subunits as discussed below. This deduction is consistent with a previous study (15Mandon E.C. Ehses I. Rother J. van Echten G. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11144-11148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showing that SPT bound to isolated intact microsomes is inactivated by externally added proteases. The cytosolic orientation of the catalytic site of SPT is probably relevant to the accessibility of enzyme substrates, because the cytosol is the major pool of serine and palmitoyl CoA in cells.In the present study, we obtained evidence that the LCB1 subunit is required for the maintenance of the LCB2 subunit in mammalian cells. First, the amount of LCB2 in CHO mutant cells lacking the endogenous LCB1 subunit was found to be far lower than the wild-type level (see Fig. 2 B and Fig. 6 A). When the LCB1 subunit was expressed in the mutant cells by transfection, the LCB2 level was restored to the wild-type level (see Fig. 2 B and Fig. 6 A). In addition, overproduction of the LCB2 subunit in CHO cells required overproduction of the LCB1 subunit (see Figs. 7 and 8). The requirement of LCB1 expression for the maintenance of the LCB2 subunit was unlikely because of a possible transcriptional regulation of the LCB2 gene by the level of the LCB1 subunit, because the LCB2 mRNA level in LY-B cells is similar to that in CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 6 B). In addition, LCB1-dependent alteration of the LCB2 subunit was observed even when the expression of cLCB1 and cLCB2 was driven by an SV40-derived promoter (see Figs. 7 and 8). Probably, post-transcriptional events cause the alteration of the LCB2 subunit. Taking account of the fact that almost all of the overproduced LCB2 protein molecules are associated with the LCB1 subunit (Fig. 8), we suggest that the LCB2 subunit is unstable unless it is associated with the LCB1 subunit.The nature of the LCB2 subunit, which requires the LCB1 subunit for maintenance, may be conserved among eukaryotes, because a lack of Lcb1p also causes a reduction in Lcb2p in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (23Gable K. Slife H. Bacikova D. Monaghan E. Dunn T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7597-7603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). By contrast, the LCB1 subunit can be highly overproduced without co-overproduction of the LCB2 subunit (see Figs. 7and 8). These results suggest that, if a pool of free LCB1 subunit is available, cells can regulate the level of LCB1/LCB2 complex through transcriptional regulation of the LCB2 gene even without parallel regulation of LCB1. This scenario might account for the previously reported observation that the change in SPT activity in response to ultraviolet irradiation parallels the change in theLCB2 mRNA level but not the LCB1 mRNA level in cultured human keratinocytes (24Farrell A.M. Uchida Y. Nagiec M.M. Harris I.R. Dickson R.C. Elias P.M. Holleran W.M. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2031-2038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nature of the LCB2 subunit could also serve to prevent harmful side reactions by free LCB2 having a latently reactive PLP. The LCB1 subunit has no PLP-binding motif and, therefore, is theoretically inert. Thus, free LCB1 might not be severely toxic.We previously demonstrated that hamster LCB1 forms a complex with hamster LCB2 at a molecular ratio of 1:1 (4Hanada K. Hara T. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8409-8415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the present study, we further showed that, when expressed in wild-type CHO cells, a FLAG-tagged LCB1 was co-immunoprecipitated with the endogenous (and also co-overproduced) LCB2 but not any endogenous LCB1 (Fig. 8). These results demonstrate that two LCB1 molecules are not simultaneously integrated into one LCB1/LCB2 complex, consistent with the results observed in a yeast system (9Gable K. Han G. Monaghan E. Bacikova D. Natarajan M. Williams R. Dunn T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10194-10200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although additional gene product, Tsc3p, is required for the optimum activity of SPT in yeast cells (23Gable K. Slife H. Bacikova D. Monaghan E. Dunn T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7597-7603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), no mammalian homolog of Tsc3 has been found even in the human genome data base. Moreover, no proteins except for LCB1 and LCB2 proteins were detected in silver staining patterns of purified hamster SPT (4Hanada K. Hara T. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8409-8415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Collectively, it is most likely that mammalian SPT is a heterodimer of the LCB1 and LCB2 subunits, although as yet unknown factors might associate with the LCB1/LCB2 complex to regulate the activity of SPT in vivo.Analysis of the tertiary structure of bacterial oxononanoate synthase, a member of the POAS family, has revealed that the catalytic site forms at the interface of each subunit of this homodimer enzyme (25Alexeev D. Alexeeva M. Baxter R.L. Campopiano D.J. Webster S.P. Sawyer L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 401-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 26Webster S.P. Alexeev D. Campopiano D.J. Watt R.M. Alexeeva M. Sawyer L. Baxter R.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 516-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). By analogy, SPT is suggested to form its catalytic site at the interface of the subunits in the LCB1/LCB2 heterodimer. If so, the LCB1 subunit may play crucial roles in the formation of the enzyme catalytic site, besides the role in the maintenance of the LCB2 subunit. This is supported by recent studies showing that several specific missense mutations in LCB1 confer dominant negative effects on SPT activity without affecting the steady state level of LCB2 subunit in yeast (9Gable K. Han G. Monaghan E. Bacikova D. Natarajan M. Williams R. Dunn T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10194-10200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and mammalian cells (8Bejaoui K. Uchida Y. Yasuda S., Ho, M. Nishijima M. Brown R.H., Jr. Holleran W.M. Hanada K. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1301-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although hydrophobic profiles of the primary structure of membrane-bound proteins predict possible TMDs and also their membrane topology, different algorithms sometimes give different predictions (21Chen C.P. Rost B. Appl. Bioinform. 2002; 1: 21-35PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ott C.M. Lingappa V.R. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2003-2009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, for the elucidation of topology of membrane proteins, experimental approaches remain indispensable. In the present study, we determined the orientation of the N and C termini of the hamster LCB1 subunit by using epitope-tagged constructs (Fig. 4) and also showed the predominant distribution of this protein in the ER at the confocal microscopic level (Fig. 5). The ER localization of the LCB1 subunit is consistent with previous studies showing that SPT activity is enriched in the ER fraction among various subcellular fractions (14Williams R.D. Wang E. Merrill A.H., Jr. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 228: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 15Mandon E.C. Ehses I. Rother J. van Echten G. Sandhoff K. J. Biol.

Capillary electrophoresis (CE), mass spectroscopy (MS), and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy have been used to elucidate the biosynthesis pathway, which proceeds in five reaction steps.

The Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes fatal lung infections in patients suffering from the inherited disorder cystic fibrosis; it also affects burn victims and immunocompromised individuals undergoing anticancer chemotherapy and those infected with human immunodeficiency virus. This bacterium produces a variety of polysaccharide structures, one of which is lipopolysaccharide (LPS).1 LPS is composed of three distinct units: (i) lipid A, which noncovalently binds the molecule into the outer membrane, (ii) the core region that links, and (iii) the O antigen, composed of linear repeats of di- to hexasaccharide units, to the lipid A anchor (1Raetz C.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 129-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). In the case ofP. aeruginosa, two different O antigens are made, namely A-band and B-band (2Rocchetta H.L. Burrows L.L. Lam J.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 523-553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A-band is a homopolymer ofd-rhamnose present in most serotypes, whereas B-band is a serospecific heteropolymer consisting of di- to pentasaccharide repeating units. Differences in B-band repeating units are responsible for the classification into 20 International Antigenic Typing System serotypes (3Liu P.V. Matsumoto H. Kusama H. Bergan T. Int. J. Sys. Bacteriol. 1983; 33: 256-264Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 4Liu P.V. Wang S. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1990; 28: 922-925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutants devoid of O antigen are 1000-fold less virulent than wild-type bacteria (5Cryz S.J., Jr. Pitt T.L. Furer E. Germanier R. Infect. Immun. 1984; 44: 508-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Staphylococcus aureus is an important bacterial pathogen responsible for a broad spectrum of human and animal diseases including cutaneous as well as wound infections and more life-threatening infections such as endocarditis and bacteremia. Moreover, S. aureus produces numerous exotoxins, some of which cause diseases such as toxic shock syndrome and food poisoning (6Lowy F.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 520-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (4673) Google Scholar). The majority of clinical S. aureus isolates produce either a type 5 or type 8 capsule (CP), which renders the organisms resistant to phagocytic uptake (7Thakker M. Park J.S. Carey V. Lee J.C. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 5183-5189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, CP production has been shown to enhance virulence in animal models of infection (8Portoles M. Kiser K.B. Bhasin N. Chan K.H. Lee J.C. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). S. aureus is highly efficient at acquiring resistance to antibiotics; the first documented case of a vancomycin-resistant S. aureus infection in a United States patient was recently reported by the Centers for Disease Control (60Sievert D.M. Boulton M.L. Stoltman G. Johnson D. Stobierski M.G. Downes F.P. Somsel P.A. Rudrik J.T. Hafeez W. Lundstrom T. Flanagan E. Johnson R. Mitchell J. Chang S. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. 51. Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta2002: 565-567Google Scholar). l-FucNAc has thus far been described exclusively as a constituent of bacterial polysaccharide structures. It is part of the O antigen of P. aeruginosa serotypes O4, O11, and O12, of the CP of S. aureus serotypes 5 and 8, and ofStreptococcus pneumoniae CP type 4 (9Knirel Y.A. Kochetkov N.K.

Forster M.J. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 221: 95-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). LPSs ofEscherichia coli O26 and CP of Bacteroides fragilis also contain l-FucNAc (13Manca M.C. Weintraub A. Widmalm G. Carbohydr. Res. 1996; 281: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 14Kasper D.L. Weintraub A. Lindberg A.A. Lonngren J. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 991-997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that not all l-FucNAc-containing bacteria are listed above; for the scope of this study, only those bacteria for which sequence data of the corresponding polysaccharide biosynthesis gene clusters are available have been taken into consideration (E. coli O26 polysaccharide cluster data are referred to in Ref. 15Jiang S.M. Wang L. Reeves P.R. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1244-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). With respect to P. aeruginosa, thel-FucNAc-containing strains, particularly International Antigenic Typing System O4 and O11, belong to the most clinically prevalent strains besides serotypes O3 and O6 (16Pitt T.L. Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 1988; 7: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The O11 strain PA103 is a high level exotoxin A producer (17Pavlovskis O.R. Pollack M. Callahan III, L.T. Iglewski B.H. Infect. Immun. 1977; 18: 596-602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). S. aureus CP serotypes 5 and 8 make up ∼80% of clinical isolates (18Sompolinsky D. Samra Z. Karakawa W.W. Vann W.F. Schneerson R. Malik Z. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1985; 22: 828-834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), andl-FucNAc is a component of both CP structures. Moreover, both P. aeruginosa and S. aureus are associated with nosocomial infections, as well as being known for resistance against antibiotics. S. pneumoniae type 4 capsule is a component of a heptavalent streptococcal vaccine, which is available commercially (19Alpern E.R. Alessandrini E.A. McGowan K.L. Bell L.M. Shaw K.N. Pediatrics. 2001; 108: E23Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These data implicate the importance of thel-FucNAc residue in pathogenicity. Targeting its biosynthesis could lead to the development of therapeutic agents that affect important virulence factors of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. To date, the biosynthesis pathway leading to the nucleotide-activated precursor of l-FucNAc is not clearly defined. Two putative pathways have been proposed, both lacking any experimental evidence.

CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1999: 185-205Crossref Google Scholar) suggested a three-step route starting from UDP-d-ManNAc and involving (i) 3-epimerization, (ii) 5-epimerization, and (iii) 6-dehydration leading to UDP-l-FucNAc. Jiang et al. (15Jiang S.M. Wang L. Reeves P.R. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1244-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) proposed a reaction scheme analogous to the biosynthesis of GDP-l-fucose from GDP-d-mannose. This group suggested that UDP-d-GlcNAc is first converted to UDP-d-ManNAc to get the same precursor as in the above pathway. The next reaction step is 4,6-dehydration to get UDP-2-acetamido-2,6-dideoxy-d-lyxo-4-hexulose, and finally a bifunctional enzyme would catalyze 3,5-epimerization and 4-reduction to yield UDP-l-FucNAc. The S. aureusgenes cap5/8E, cap5/8F, andcap5/8G or the homologous S. pneumoniae genes cps4M(J), cps4N(K), andcps4L have been proposed to be involved in this biosynthesis (15Jiang S.M. Wang L. Reeves P.R. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1244-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 20Lee J.C. Lee C.Y. Goldberg J.B. Genetics of Bacterial Polysaccharides. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1999: 185-205Crossref Google Scholar). We present for the first time a proposed biosynthetic pathway for nucleotide-activated l-FucNAc, namely UDP-l-FucNAc from its precursor UDP-d-GlcNAc. We provide evidence that three P. aeruginosa enzymes, WbjB, WbjC, and WbjD (and their S. aureus homologs Cap5E, Cap5F, and Cap5G) catalyze a five-step reaction cascade. UDP-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, UDP-N-acetyl-d-galactosamine, UDP-d-glucose, NAD+, NADH, NADP+, NADPH, and the antibiotics used in this study were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. HiTrap Chelating columns were purchased from AmershamBiosciences, Econo-Pac High Q columns were from Bio-Rad, and pET28a, pET24a+, and pET24c+ were from Novagen (Madison, WI). The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. P. aeruginosa strains were grown in Luria broth (Invitrogen) or onPseudomonas Isolation Agar (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI). S. aureus was grown in tryptic soy broth (Difco Laboratories). E. coli strains Top10 (Invitrogen) and JM109 (21Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar) were used for plasmid propagation. E. coli strain SM10 (22Simon R. Priefer U. Puhler A. BioTechnology. 1983; 1: 784-791Crossref Scopus (5658) Google Scholar) was used as donor in bacterial conjugation. For protein overexpression E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was used (Novagen). Overexpression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Invitrogen) at a final concentration of 1 mm. The media were supplemented with ampicillin (100–250 μg/ml), kanamycin (25 μg/ml or 50 μg/ml), carbenicillin (250 μg/ml for E. coli and 300 μg/ml for P. aeruginosa), gentamicin (15 μg/ml forE. coli and 300 μg/ml for P. aeruginosa), tetracycline (15 μg/ml for E. coli and 100 μg/ml forP. aeruginosa), chloramphenicol (10 μg/ml), or erythromycin (10 μg/ml) when necessary.Table IBacterial strains and plasmids used in this studyGenotype/descriptionSourceStrains E. coli Top10F− mcrAΔ(mrr-hsdRMS-mcrBC) φ80lacZΔM15 ΔlacX74 deoR recA1araD139 Δ(araA-leu)7697galU gal K rpsL (StrR)endA1 nupGInvitrogen JM109endA1 recA1 gyrA96thi hsdR17 (r k−,m k+)relA1 supE44 λ− Δ(lac-proAB) [F′ traD36 proABlaqIqZΔM15Ref. 21Yanisch-Perron C.

Foster (Ireland) Open table in a new tab SDS-PAGE was done according to the method of Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Sigma-Aldrich). The protein concentrations were determined as described by Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). LPS was prepared according to the method of Hitchcock and Brown (25Hitchcock P.J. Brown T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 269-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were run on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel, and the LPS was either transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane or visualized by a rapid silver staining procedure (26Fomsgaard A. Freudenberg M.A. Galanos C. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1990; 28: 2627-2631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies MF55-1 (mAb to B-band O antigen of serotype O11) (27Lam J.S. MacDonald L.A. Lam M.Y.

The blots were developed with anti-mouse immunoglobulin G alkaline phosphatase (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) for mAbs, and anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad) for the polyclonal antiserum. 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium (Sigma-Aldrich) were used as the alkaline phosphatase substrate. Colony immunoblot analysis was performed as previously described (29Lee J.C. Liu M.J. Parsonnet J. Arbeit R.D. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1990; 28: 2612-2615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the use of CP5-specific polyclonal rabbit antiserum. The blots were developed using protein A-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) and the Bio-Rad horseradish peroxidase conjugate substrate kit. BLAST (30Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) and Multalin (31Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4347) Google Scholar) were used for analysis of nucleotide and protein sequences. All of the standard DNA recombinant procedures were performed according to the methods described by Sambrook et al. (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or as recommended by the corresponding manufacturer. PCR was carried out with a GeneAmp PCR System 2400 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). DNA sequencing was performed by Mobix Lab (Hamilton, Canada) or by the Beth Israel Deaconess Molecular Medicine Unit (Boston, MA). N-terminal protein sequencing was performed by the Dana Farber Molecular Biology Core Facility (Boston, MA). The oligonucleotide primer sequences are given in Table II. Chromosomal DNA ofP. aeruginosa International Antigenic Typing System strain O11 or S. aureus capsular type 5 was used for amplification of the genes. Pwo polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used for PCR amplification. Primer pairs wbjB1F/wbjB2R, wbjC1F/wbjC2R, wbjD1F/wbjD2R, and capE1F/capE2R were used for amplification of thewbjB, wbjC, wbjD, and cap5E(clinical isolate provided by A. Chow, Vancouver, Canada) genes, respectively. The PCR products of genes wbjD andcap5E were digested with NcoI andBamHI and ligated into the modified pET23 derivative (33Newton D.T. Mangroo D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), cut with the same enzymes. PCR product wbjC was cut withNdeI and HindIII and ligated into appropriately digested pET28a. Finally, PCR product wbjB was digested withNdeI and EcoRI and ligated intoNdeI/EcoRI-cut pET28a. The corresponding plasmids pFuc11 (wbjB), pFuc12 (wbjC), pFuc13 (wbjD), and pFuc21 (cap5E) were confirmed by DNA sequencing and used for amplification of PCR products for complementation studies and/or overexpression of N-terminal histidine-tagged fusion proteins.Table IIOligonucleotide primers used in this studyPrimer2-aForward and reverse primers are represented by plus and minus signs, respectively.Primer sequence2-bThe underlined sequences represent the restriction sites used to clone the PCR products.wbjB1F (+)5′-GGACTCGAGCATATGGATAAGAACTCTGTTC-3′wbjB2R (−)5′-GGAATTCAGTTACAAGAACTTTCATCG-3′wbjC1F (+)5′-GTAGATCTCATATGAAAGTTCTTGTAACTG-3′wbjC2R (−)5′-GACAAGCTTCTCACTATACCTTACGCACC-3′wbjD1F (+)5′-CGAGATCTACCATGGAGAAGCTAAAAGTCG-3′wbjD2R (−)5′-GAGAATTCGGATCCTTGCCATCAACTCC-3′wzy11F (+)5′-GTTATGGTTCGATCTATATGG-3′cap5E1F (+)5′-GCAGAGCTCCATGGTCGATGACAAAATTTTAT-3′cap5E2R (−)5′-TGGGATCCGGTACCTCTCCTATCTCATTGAAGC-3′T7 (+)5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′gent1F (+)5′-GTTAGGTGGCTCAAGTATGG-3′gent2R (−)5′-AGATCACATAAGCACCAAGC-3′KKI (+)5′-ACAATCTAGAGCCAGATACGTATTTCTTGG-3′KK2 (−)5′-ACAAGAATTCCATTTCCTCCAAGTATTTCG-3′5E-F (+)5′-GGAGGCTAGCATGTTCGATGACAAAATT-3′5E-R (−)5′-CTCTCGAGTCTCATTGAAGCTTTATAAT-3′5F-F (−)5′-GATAGGCTAGCTTGACGTTGAAT-3′5F-R (−)5′-TCCATGCGCTCGAGCTCCAAGA-3′12402F1 (+)5′-GCATGAGCTCAAGGTGGCGAAGTATT-3′12402R2 (−)5′-TGGAGTTCCTTCAATAGCACGCTTTA-3′12402F2 (+)5′-CAGTCTAGACTCGATCGAACATTGCC-3′12402R2 (−)5′-TTATCTAGACAATCGCTATCCTCATC-3′2-a Forward and reverse primers are represented by plus and minus signs, respectively.2-b The underlined sequences represent the restriction sites used to clone the PCR products. Open table in a new tab S. aureus cap5E, capF, and capG genes were PCR-amplified from strain Newman chromosomal DNA with High Fidelity PCR Supermix (Invitrogen). Primers 5E-F and 5E-R were utilized to amplify the cap5E gene. This amplicon was digested withXhoI and NheI and ligated to pET24a+ digested with the same enzymes. The resultant plasmid pKBK50d contained the ribosomal-binding site and the ATG start site of the pET vector in-frame with the entire cap5E gene and C-terminal six-histidine tag. A similar strategy was applied to clone thecap5F gene; it was amplified with primers 5F-F and 5F-R and cloned into the pET24a+ vector, creating plasmid pET5F1.1. Thecap5G gene was amplified with KK1 and KK2. The 1.18-kb amplicon was digested with XbaI and EcoRI and ligated to appropriately digested pET24c+, yielding plasmid pKBK6a with a C-terminal histidine tag. All of the plasmids were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing of the PCR-amplified genes. To construct the plasmids containing a nonpolar gene disruption ofP. aeruginosa wbjB, the PCR product described above was ligated into SmaI-cut pEX100T, taking advantage of the blunt-end PCR product made by Pwo polymerase. ThewbjB-containing plasmid pKOB1 was subsequently cut withKpnI, and the aacC1 gene (gentamicin resistance cassette) from pUCGm was ligated into pKOB1 to yield thewbjB knockout plasmid pKOB2. To create a plasmid for S. aureus cap5G gene disruption, subclone pJCL69 (containing the end of cap5E through the start of cap5I) was digested with BclI, releasing a 294-bp fragment 50 bp downstream of the ATG start site ofcap5G yielding pJCL69-2. The ermB gene from pERMB was ligated into the BclI site of pJCL69-2 to create pJCL69-2ermB. A 4402-bp XbaI-BamHI fragment from pJCL69-2ermB was ligated to digested pCL10 to yield pKOR1. To create a knockout plasmid for use in cap5F allelic replacement, a modified pCL10 plasmid containing ermB in theBamHI site was constructed (pAP1.2EX). A 1.6-kb region of the cap5 gene locus (containing 450 bp of cap5Fgene and 1124 bp of the cap5G gene) was PCR-amplified using primers 12402F2 and 12402R2, digested with XbaI, and ligated to XbaI-digested pAP1.2EX to form pKOR3. A 1941-bp region of the cap5 locus containing 385 bp of cap5D, the complete open reading frame (1026 bp) of cap5E gene, and 530 bp of cap5F was PCR-amplified using primers 12402F1 and 12402R1. This amplicon was digested with SacI andEcoRV and ligated to similarly digested pKOR3 to yield the 11.32-kb plasmid pKOR4. pFuc11 and pFuc21 plasmid DNA was used to amplify the genes for the complementation plasmids. PCR was carried out with T7 forward primer and the corresponding reverse primers used to get the expression plasmids. The XbaI site in the T7 promoter sequence was used to ligate the PCR product into pUCP27 digested withXbaI/EcoRI for wbjB orXbaI/KpnI in the case of cap5E. Thus, we could take advantage of the ribosomal-binding site of the pET vectors and achieve complementation with the N-terminally histidine-tagged fusion proteins. The resulting plasmids pPAB27 and pSAE27 were confirmed by DNA sequencing. S. aureusplasmid pKOR2 was constructed by ligating a 2.2-kbBamHI-XbaI fragment from pJCL43 containing thecap5G gene along with 920 bp of upstream and 144 bp of downstream flanking sequences into the E. coli/S. aureus shuttle vector pLI50. Expressions were carried out at 37 °C using terrific broth (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin for WbjB and WbjC, with 25 μg/ml kanamycin for Cap5E, Cap5F, or Cap5G, or with 250 μg/ml ampicillin for WbjD. The cultures were grown to an A 600 nm of 0.6, and expression was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 1 mm. WbjB ,WbjD, Cap5E, and Cap5F expression was carried out for 3 h at 37 °C, WbjC was expressed for 4 h at 37 °C, and Cap5G was expressed for 4 h at 30 °C. The cells were disrupted on ice by ultrasonication. Cell debris and membrane fractions were removed by ultracentrifugation at 300,000 × g. Purifications using nickel chelating columns were performed as recommended by the manufacturers. Purified WbjC and WbjD could be obtained at 200 mm imidazole, whereas WbjB, Cap5E, Cap5F, and Cap5G were eluted from the column at 300 mm imidazole. Dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the proteins were stored at −20 °C after the addition of 40% glycerol. The purity of the enzymes was checked by SDS-PAGE analysis on a 10% gel, and N-terminal protein sequencing was performed on Cap5E, Cap5F, and Cap5G to verify the purified proteins. CE analysis was performed with a P/ACE MDQ Glycoprotein system with UV detection (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). The samples were separated at 22 kV in 25 mm borate buffer (pH 9.5) at 25 °C. Typically, the reactions contained 0.5 mm UDP-d-GlcNAc, 0.1 mm NADP+, and an excess of hydride donor (NADH or NADPH). For CE-MS analysis, the UDP-d-GlcNAc concentration was 0.1 or 0.5 mm. The standard reaction buffer was 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0 supplemented with 10 mm MgCl2. The enzymes (∼1 μg each) were added, and the reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min before being analyzed by CE. The reaction cascades were investigated as stepwise reactions adding one enzyme at a time (allowing optimal substrate conversion on each reaction step) and as combined reactions adding more than one enzyme to start the reaction. The crystal model 310 CE instrument (ATI Unicam, Boston, MA) was coupled to an API 3000 mass spectrometer (MDS/Sciex, Concord, Canada) via a micro Ionspray interface. A sheath solution (isopropanol:methanol, 2:1) was delivered at a flow rate of 1 nl/min to a low dead volume tee (internal diameter, 250 μm; Chromatographic Specialties, Brockville, Canada). The separation was achieved using a 90-cm bare fused silica capillary with a buffer of 30 mm morpholine/formic acid in deionized water, pH 9.0, with 5% methanol. For positive detection mode, a 10 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 9.0, containing 5% methanol was used. A separation voltage of 30 kV was typicall"

Animal mating calls that exert a comparatively high sound pressure propagate over greater distances and generally have greater attractive power1,2. Here we show that calling male Bornean tree-hole frogs (Metaphrynella sundana) actively exploit the acoustic properties of cavities in tree trunks that are partially filled with water and which are primarily used as egg-deposition sites. By tuning their vocalizations to the resonant frequency of the hole, which varies with the amount of water that it contains, these frogs enhance their chances of attracting females."

Dps homologs have been identified in various bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Listeria innocua. Recently we have reported the presence of a Dps homolog, Ms-Dps, in Mycobacterium smegmatis. Ms-Dps was found to have a nonspecific DNA binding ability. Here we have detected two stable oligomeric forms of Ms-Dpsin vitro, a trimeric and a dodecameric form. Interestingly, the conversion of Dps from a trimeric to a dodecameric form takes place upon incubation at 37 °C for 12 h. These two oligomeric forms differ in their DNA binding properties. The dodecameric form is capable of DNA binding and forming large crystalline arrays with DNA, whereas the trimeric form cannot do so. However, even in the absence of DNA binding, the trimeric form has the capacity to protect the DNA against Fenton's-mediated damage. The protection is afforded by the ferroxidase activity of the trimer. However, the trimeric form cannot protect DNA from DNaseI attack, for which a direct physical shielding of DNA by the dodecamer is required. Thus we suggest that Ms-Dps provides a bimodal protection of DNA by its two different oligomeric forms.

Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 363-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), and a nonspecific DNA binding and protecting protein, Dps, (DNA binding protein from stationary phase cells) (5Almiron M. Link A.J. Furlong D. Kolter R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar) are a few examples in this category. Almost all the bacteria when exposed to ROS exhibit an adaptive response by switching on the expression of genes coding for these proteins (6Christman M.F. Morgan R.W. Jacobson F.S. Ames B.N. Cell. 1985; 41: 753-762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Such strategies are all the more important for pathogenic bacteria because production of reactive oxygen species is a major killing mechanism adopted by many hosts. These schemes also become important during the growth of the organism in stationary phase or during nutrient limiting condition. Thus, the regulation of gene expression upon the induction of starvation and during the stationary phase has been an area of intense research. In the stationary phase cultures of Escherichia coli, the existence of a novel protein Dps was discovered around a decade ago (5Almiron M. Link A.J. Furlong D. Kolter R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). It is a nonspecific DNA binding protein with a structure very similar to ferritins. Because of their structural homology they have been classified under the same superfamily in the SCOP data base (7Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5539) Google Scholar). Despite being a DNA binding protein, Dps lacks any of the known DNA binding motifs. Even though the crystal structure of E. coliDps has been solved (8Grant R.A. Filman D.J. Finkel S.E. Kolter R. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), the exact mechanism with which it binds to DNA is not fully understood. Whatever the mechanism, Dps provides a novel way of binding to DNA. Highly crystalline and ordered assemblies of Dps-DNA complexes have been identified both in vitro (5Almiron M. Link A.J. Furlong D. Kolter R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar) andin vivo (9Wolf S.G. Frenkiel D. Arad T. Finkel S.E. Kolter R. Minsky A. Nature. 1999; 400: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Functionally, Dps has been shown to protect the cells against oxidative radicals generated by Fenton's reaction and also against various other DNA damaging agents (10Martinez A. Kolter R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5188-5194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ferguson G.P. Creighton R.I. Nikolaev Y. Booth I.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1030-1036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the predominance of such radicals becomes greater during the stationary phase of the bacterial growth cycle, Dps expression has also been shown to be induced in stationary phase and upon nutrient starvation (12Lomovskaya O.L. Kidwell J.P. Matin A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 170: 3928-3935Crossref Google Scholar). Besides its protective role, Dps also has a global regulatory role in controlling gene expression during prolonged starvation (5Almiron M. Link A.J. Furlong D. Kolter R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Dps-like proteins have been identified in distantly related bacteria such as E. coli, Bacillus subtilis,Listeria innocua, and Synechococcus sp. (5Almiron M. Link A.J. Furlong D. Kolter R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar,13Chen L. Helmann J.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 14Bozzi M. Mignogna G.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22478-22482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We have earlier reported the presence of a Dps homolog, Ms-Dps, in Mycobacterium smegmatis (16Gupta S. Pandit S.B. Srinivasan N. Chatterji D. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this study we throw further light on the DNA binding ability of Ms-Dps. We show that only the dodecameric species of Ms-Dps is capable of complex formation with DNA. We also report a bimodal type of protection of DNA by Ms-Dps, one without physical interaction with DNA and the other by direct binding to DNA. Last, the importance of Ms-Dps as an evolutionary link between ferritins and Dps is also discussed. The DH5α strain ofE. coli was used for cloning purposes and the BL21 DE3 (pLys) strain was used for protein purification. pET-dps is a pET21b derivative containing the M. smegmatis dps gene (16Gupta S. Pandit S.B. Srinivasan N. Chatterji D. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Plasmid pUC19 (17Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene. 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11410) Google Scholar) was used for in vitro DNA binding and DNA damage assays. Ms-Dps purification was performed as described earlier (16Gupta S. Pandit S.B. Srinivasan N. Chatterji D. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In brief, E. coli strain BL21 DE3 (pLys) was transformed with pET-dps. These cells were grown at 37 °C in Luria Bertani medium to anA 600 of 0.5 and then induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Single-step purification was performed using the Qiagen Ni-NTA affinity matrix according to the manufacturer's instructions. After checking the purity of the protein on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, protein was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mmNaCl overnight and used for further analysis. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (18Lowry O.H. Rosenbrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 266-275Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). For the formation of the higher oligomer, protein at a concentration of 1 mg/ml was incubated at 37 °C for 12 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl. A 10% native polyacrylamide gel was prepared using discontinuous buffer system according to the method of Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205496) Google Scholar). The gel recipe was the same, excluding the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Samples were loaded with a dye (10% glycerol, 0.002% bromphenol blue), and the electrophoresis was carried out at a constant current of 15 mA. Gels were then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and horse spleen ferritin were used as markers. pUC19 DNA was mixed with Ms-Dps at a DNA:protein molar ratio of 1:102 or 1:103 in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl. The incubation was carried out at 30 °C for 30 min. Wherever indicated, Ms-Dps was incubated at 37 °C for 12 h prior to the DNA binding. The complex was then resolved on a 1% agarose gel in 0.5% TBE buffer consisting of 89 mm Tris borate (pH 8.0) and 1 mm EDTA. The electrophoresis was carried out at a constant voltage of 50 V. The unbound free and protein-bound DNA was then detected by ethidium bromide staining. Purified Ms-Dps was first incubated at 37 °C for 6 h to allow partial oligomerization. 100 μg of this preparation was then incubated with 1 mmferrous sulfate in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl for 1 h at room temperature. The products were resolved on a 10% native PAGE. The gel was then stained with potassium ferricyanide solution, 100 mm K3(Fe(CN)6) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, for 10 min in the dark and destained with 10% trichloroacetic acid/methanol solution. After taking an image of the stained gel, it was subjected to Coomassie Blue staining using standard techniques. Horse spleen ferritin and BSA were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. pUC19 DNA was used to assess the ability of Ms-Dps to protect DNA from oxidative damage. In a total reaction volume of 20 μl containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, Ms-Dps was allowed to interact with pUC19 DNA at 30 °C for 30 min. Then to assay for oxidative damage, FeSO4 was added at a concentration of 25 or 50 μm and incubated for 5 min, followed by further addition of 5 mm H2O2 and incubation for another 5 min. To check for DNA damage induced by DNaseI, MgCl2 was added to a final concentration of 40 mm followed by treatment with 1 unit of DNaseI (1 unit is defined as the amount of enzyme causing an increase in absorbance at 260 nm by 0.001 per minute) for 5 min at room temperature. The reactions were stopped with 50 mm EDTA. The products of the reactions were resolved on a 1% agarose gel in 0.5% TBE buffer and stained with ethidium bromide. Wherever indicated, Ms-Dps was incubated at 37 °C for 12 h prior to the DNA damage assays. Ms-Dps after incubation at 37 °C for 12 h alone and the Ms-Dps-DNA complexes were placed on copper grids. After 2 min of absorption at room temperature, the samples were negatively stained with uranyl acetate for 5 min. Specimens were examined in a Jeol 100 CxII electron microscope at 80 kV. The photographs were taken at ×65,000 magnification. The diameters of the rings were measured from electron microscopic negatives with the aid of a Wild-Heerbrugg MPS12 zoom stereomicroscope. About 40 numbers of differentially placed rings were measured. The iron oxidation and incorporation kinetics were followed spectrophotometrically at 305 nm on a Jasco V-530 spectrophotometer. The solution of Ms-Dps (6 μm) was initially scanned for 300 s; subsequently, freshly prepared 10 μm ferrous sulfate was added and scanned again for 300 s. As a control the rate of Fe2+ auto-oxidation was measured in parallel. We have recently reported the identification, purification, and DNA binding ability of Ms-Dps (16Gupta S. Pandit S.B. Srinivasan N. Chatterji D. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, in the gel retardation assay, even at a large excess of Ms-Dps over DNA, generation of higher molecular weight species was not observed, unlike in the E. coli DNA-Dps complex (5Almiron M. Link A.J. Furlong D. Kolter R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Because all the Dps family members are known to form multimers and different oligomeric forms might have different DNA binding abilities, it was thought that the oligomeric status of Ms-Dps should first be identified. For this purpose, protein was subjected to native PAGE analysis. The recombinant protein when purified under native conditions shows the presence of two major species on a 10% native PAGE (Fig. 1, lanes 1–3), one lower oligomeric form that runs near BSA (MW-63,000) and another higher oligomeric form that runs near ferritin (MW-450,000). Both BSA and ferritin are globular, acidic proteins with isoelectric points similar to that of Ms-Dps (BSA-4.8, ferritin-4.5, Ms-Dps-5.4). Thus they can be used as markers in native PAGE analysis. The mobility of the lower oligomer on the gel indicates that it could be a trimeric species (MW of Ms-Dps monomer-216,000). As is evident in Fig. 1,lane 3, the trimeric form is predominant over the higher oligomeric form. This preparation of protein was then checked for its DNA binding ability. As shown in Fig. 2, the protein did not retard the pUC19 DNA on a 1% agarose gel even at 1:103 DNA: protein molar ratio.Figure 2Absence of binding of lower oligomeric form of Ms-Dps to DNA. Free pUC19 DNA (lane 1). Incubated with Ms-Dps at 30 °C for 30 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl at DNA:protein molar ratio of 1:102 (lane 2) and 1:103 (lane 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When this protein preparation, the purification of which had been carried out at 4 °C, was incubated at 37 °C for 12 h and checked on 10% native PAGE, the higher oligomeric form became predominant over the trimeric form (Fig. 1, lane 4). The switch in relative ratio of trimer to higher oligomer upon 37 °C incubation was consistently observed with different protein preparations. The formation of the higher oligomer was found to be an irreversible process, i.e. when incubated back at 4 °C or at room temperature the higher oligomer did not dissociate into the trimer. It is possible that the formation of the higher oligomer is an energy-requiring process. The probability of temperature-induced structural changes in the monomers, which favor higher oligomer formation, also cannot be ruled out. However, the secondary structures of Ms-Dps both at 4 °C and after incubation at 37 °C were the same, as was seen by circular dichroism studies (data not shown). A gel retardation assay was then performed after the incubation of Ms-Dps at 37 °C for 12 h. As shown in Fig. 3, this treatment enabled the protein to form a complex with pUC19 DNA, and the complex did not enter 1% agarose gel. This property is similar to that observed with E. coli Dps (5Almiron M. Link A.J. Furlong D. Kolter R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 10Martinez A. Kolter R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5188-5194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It should be mentioned here that some batches of the purified Ms-Dps showed only a slight mobility shift of DNA (16Gupta S. Pandit S.B. Srinivasan N. Chatterji D. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), but upon incubation at 37 °C, the high molecular weight complex with DNA forms instantaneously. Upon correlating the native PAGE analysis with the gel retardation assays, it is apparent that the presence of the higher oligomeric form of the protein is mandatory for complex formation with DNA. Electron microscopic studies were then performed on the 37 °C-incubated Ms-Dps and Ms-Dps-DNA complexes. Preparations of the protein alone when visualized under electron microscope showed discrete ring-like structures of ∼9 nm diameter (Fig. 4 a). This size correlates well with the diameter of the modeled Ms-Dps dodecameric molecule, which is 8.8 nm (16Gupta S. Pandit S.B. Srinivasan N. Chatterji D. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and also with that of the crystal structure of E. coli Dps, which is 9 nm (8Grant R.A. Filman D.J. Finkel S.E. Kolter R. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). When the same protein was incubated with DNA and then visualized in the electron microscope, large and highly ordered two-dimensional arrays of the rings were seen (Fig. 4 b). This honeycomb-like arrangement is very similar to that observed with E. coli Dps-DNA complexes (5Almiron M. Link A.J. Furlong D. Kolter R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Electron microscopic analysis suggests that the higher oligomer seen on the native gels is a dodecamer. Various different multimeric forms ofE. coli Dps were detected earlier (8Grant R.A. Filman D.J. Finkel S.E. Kolter R. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), but it is not known which one of these is the actual DNA binding species. Our results presented here indicate that it is the dodecameric form of Ms-Dps, which is capable of forming high molecular weight complexes with DNA. Other lower oligomeric forms and the monomers do not have this ability. Some Dps family proteins, like Dps of E. coli, the ferritin of L. innocua, and Dpr from Streptococcus mutans have been shown to bind iron (5Almiron M. Link A.J. Furlong D. Kolter R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 14Bozzi M. Mignogna G. Stefanini S. Barra D. Longhi C. Valenti P. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3259-3265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 20Yamamoto Y. Poole L.B. Hantgan R.R. Kamio Y. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2931-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Therefore, in this study the iron-binding ability of Ms-Dps was examined. First the oligomerization was allowed to proceed by incubating purified Ms-Dps at 37 °C. The incubation was carried out only for 6 h so as to attain a population of both the oligomeric forms in the reaction mixture. Both oligomeric forms were then allowed to incorporate iron by incubating with 1 mmferrous sulfate. The two forms were then separated on a native PAGE. Upon staining with K3(Fe(CN)6, as is seen in Fig. 5 A, the higher oligomeric form was stained, along with ferritin which was used as a positive control. However, no band was visible that corresponded to the lower oligomer. The same gel when stained with Coomassie Blue showed the presence of the lower oligomer as well as of BSA (Fig. 5 B). The following is a structurally interesting observation. The dodecameric structure of modeled Ms-Dps (16Gupta S. Pandit S.B. Srinivasan N. Chatterji D. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) has a hollow core in the center in which ferrous ions can be incorporated. The formation of a trimer, on the other hand, would give rise to an open structure with no such hollow core (Fig. 6). The trimeric species, therefore, offers no place for iron incorporation to occur. The structures of the trimeric and dodecameric forms of E. coli Dps as adopted from Ref. 8Grant R.A. Filman D.J. Finkel S.E. Kolter R. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar are shown in Fig. 6. Recently it has been shown that in E. coli Dps, iron oxidation and hydrolysis can lead to incorporation of about 500 ferric ions inside the dodecameric protein shell (21Ilari A. Ceci P. Ferrari D. Rossi G. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37619-37623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Our experiments here suggest that the dodecameric Ms-Dps is also capable of incorporating iron ions inside its protein shell, whereas the probable trimeric species cannot accumulate iron because of structural constraints. One important function of Dpsin vivo is to protect the DNA from oxidative radicals. To investigate whether Ms-Dps also has this protective ability, anin vitro DNA damage assay was performed. H2O2 in the presence of ferrous ions generates OH· radicals through the Fenton reaction: Fe2+ + H2O2 → Fe3+ + OH− + OH·. The OH· radicals thus generated have a DNA-nicking ability. Various concentrations of ferrous ions and H2O2 were used to bring about DNA damage. As seen in Fig. 7, in the presence of 25 μm FeSO4 and 5 mmH2O2 all the supercoiled pUC19 DNA was nicked, resulting in relaxed DNA, whereas in the presence of Ms-Dps, DNA was protected against this nicking. At 50 μm ferrous sulfate and 5 mm H2O2 the DNA was totally degraded, whereas it remained intact in the presence of Ms-Dps. This experiment shows that Ms-Dps has the ability to protect DNA against Fenton's-mediated damage. The protein used in this assay had not undergone 37 °C incubation. Because trimeric Ms-Dps does not bind DNA, it was quite interesting to note its DNA protection ability from the free radical onslaught. As expected, Ms-Dps after incubation at 37 °C also showed DNA protection in the same assay in the presence of FeSO4 and H2O2 (Fig. 8). These observations point toward an important characteristic of the protein. Ms-Dps seems to provide a bimodal type of protection to DNA. When the protein is predominantly in trimeric form, it does not bind DNA. Even in the absence of direct physical interaction with the DNA, the trimeric form is capable of protecting the DNA from Fenton's-mediated damage. Under the conditions where it forms the dodecamer, it generates a complex network with the DNA and thus protects it from damage. This type of protection might also be important against various other DNA-damaging agents such as nucleases, alkylating agents, and chemical mutagens. The capability of these two oligomeric forms to protect DNA against DNaseI was then tested. As shown in Fig. 9, DNA incubated with the trimeric form of Ms-Dps was totally degraded by DNaseI, whereas upon incubation with the dodecameric form, DNA remained intact. It can be inferred from this experiment that because the trimeric form does not bind DNA, DNA was free to be digested by the endonuclease DNaseI. Direct physical interaction of Ms-Dps with DNA is required to protect it from an enzyme like DNaseI, which can be afforded only by the dodecameric form. Thus the mechanism of protection provided by the two oligomeric forms of the same protein is not the same. The higher oligomer protects by physically shielding the DNA, whereas the lower oligomer protects without even directly interacting with DNA. The latter mode of protection can be explained mechanistically if the protein has an iron-chelating activity. Although we have not seen any iron incorporation ability in the trimeric species (Fig. 5), it does not rule out the possibility of the trimer having iron-binding and ferroxidase activity. As has been reported recently (22Zhao G. Ceci P. Ilari A. Giangiacomo L. Laue T.M. Chiancone E. Chasteen N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27689-27696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), E. coli Dps has a ferroxidase activity, i.e. conversion of Fe2+ to Fe3+ using H2O2as an oxidant. The protein has been shown to form coordinate complexes with Fe2+, which is then oxidized to Fe3+ using H2O2 via a mechanism that does not allow Fenton's reaction to proceed. The generation of OH· radicals is thereby inhibited. We thus speculated that the lower oligomeric form of Ms-Dps could also be protecting the DNA through such a ferroxidase activity. To check this hypothesis spectral analysis at 305 nm was employed, because Fe3+ species absorbs at 305 nm where Fe2+ does not. As shown in Fig. 10 A, the buffer alone did not absorb at 305 nm. However, upon addition of FeSO4, the absorbance gradually increased with time, which implies that Fe2+ was converted to Fe3+ by utilizing molecular oxygen of air. Because the spectrum was taken only until 300 s, all of the ferrous ions did not get oxidized to ferric ions in this short span of time, and thus the saturation was not reached. In the presence of protein, when FeSO4 was added there was a sudden exponential increase in the absorbance, which later reached saturation (Fig. 10 B). The presence of protein allowed the conversion of total ferrous ions to ferric ions within 300 s. This clearly shows that the trimeric Ms-Dps has a ferroxidase center that can rapidly oxidize Fe2+ to Fe3+ using molecular oxygen of air. Addition of H2O2 after 300 s did not bring about any further change in the absorbance (data not shown). We would like to speculate here that the trimeric form of Ms-Dps is capable of protecting DNA without physically interacting with it, because of its ability to chelate out Fe2+ ions in the vicinity of DNA and then oxidize them to Fe3+ using molecular oxygen. This observation is in contrast to that of a recent report (22Zhao G. Ceci P. Ilari A. Giangiacomo L. Laue T.M. Chiancone E. Chasteen N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27689-27696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), in which the authors found that the E. coli Dps cannot utilize oxygen to convert Fe2+ to Fe3+effectively. H2O2 was shown to be a better oxidant than oxygen. However, this property is unlike those of ferritins, because ferritins utilize oxygen as an oxidant. Therefore it appears that Ms-Dps is exhibiting ferroxidase property similar to that of ferritins and not like that of E. coli Dps. This protein is thus a unique member of the Dps family with a DNA binding ability like that of Dps and a ferroxidase activity like that of ferritins. One of the members of the family, Dps of L. innocua, has been identified as a true dodecameric ferritin functioning in iron storage (14Bozzi M. Mignogna G. Stefanini S. Barra D. Longhi C. Valenti P. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3259-3265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), but this protein does not have DNA binding ability. Recently Dlp1 and Dlp2, the two Dps-like proteins from B. anthracis, have been designated as mini-ferritins (23Papinutto E. Dundon W.G. Pitulis N. Battistutta R. Montecucco C. Zanotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15093-15098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) because they are ferritins that are dodecamers rather than the usual 24-mers. They also do not bind DNA. Although Dps A of Synechococcus sp. is a DNA-binding hemoprotein possessing a weak catalase activity, it is not known to have a ferroxidase activity (15Pena M.M. Bullerjahn G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22478-22482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To date, no other single member of this family is known to possess both DNA-binding and ferritin-like ferroxidase activities. As had been discussed elsewhere (15Pena M.M. Bullerjahn G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22478-22482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), Dps proteins might have evolved as metal-binding proteins that later acquired DNA binding ability. The Ms-Dps, thus, could be a link between the two extremes, having a DNA binding property while still retaining the ferroxidase activity of ferritins. During the evolution of life, the appearance of atmospheric oxygen offered the opportunity to utilize molecular oxygen as the oxidant in respiration. This provided energetic advantages over fermentation and respiratory pathways, which rely on other oxidants. However, the presence of intracellular oxygen also allowed unavoidable production of reactive oxygen species, which damage critical biomolecules. In most cases toxicity is exerted because of their direct damaging effects on DNA. A number of preventive mechanisms evolved since then to take care of such ROS-mediated toxicity. One important question that has been quite frequently addressed is the protection of DNA from ROS in a bacterial cell under stationary phase or under some kind of nutritional stress. Because of constraints of resources under these conditions, many energetic expensive mechanisms of DNA protection cannot be employed. This question attains further importance in mycobacterial species because the latent pathogenic mycobacteria can survive within the host for a very long time devoid of all necessary nutrients and later can resume growth at an appropriate moment (24Parrish N.M. Dick J.D. Bishai W.R. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 107-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Naturally, the organism should be able to adopt efficient mechanisms to protect its genetic material under such nutritionally stressful conditions. Recently we have analyzed the proteome ofM. smegmatis under carbon starvation with the aim of identifying some such mechanisms (16Gupta S. Pandit S.B. Srinivasan N. Chatterji D. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although M. smegmatisis a non-pathogenic species, we thought it would be worthwhile to identify the proteins that are overexpressed under carbon starvation, because then attempts could be made to correlate the expression of such proteins in its pathogenic counterpart. Comparatively faster growth kinetics of M. smegmatis under carbon starvation (25Ojha A.K. Mukherjee T.K. Chatterji D. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4084-4091Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and the known genome sequence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (26Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6403) Google Scholar) help in such an endeavor. Through such an exercise we have identified a Dps-like protein in M. smegmatis (16Gupta S. Pandit S.B. Srinivasan N. Chatterji D. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although the role of Dps has been worked out in E. coli and some other organisms as mentioned earlier, its presence was not reported in mycobacteria before. However, the most interesting aspect was the absence of a sequence homolog of Dps in the M. tuberculosis genome, naturally raising questions regarding its ubiquitous function in protecting DNA under starvation conditions. As was mentioned earlier, ferritins and Dps are members of the same superfamily of proteins and are known to have evolved as divergent homologs from a common ancestor (15Pena M.M. Bullerjahn G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22478-22482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, the functional complementation of these proteins is not reported in literature. Still it is tempting to speculate here that one of the ferritins of M. tuberculosis might be performing the function performed by Dps-like proteins in other mycobacteria, such as M. smegmatis and Mycobacterium avium. Our results presented in this manuscript suggest that Ms-Dps has a bimodal way of protecting DNA under free radical onslaught. Dps has earlier been shown to cause considerable compaction of DNA upon binding (8Grant R.A. Filman D.J. Finkel S.E. Kolter R. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Such a nonspecific complex network formation with DNA can make the DNA inaccessible to polymerases and other important DNA-modifying enzymes during the growth of the bacteria. At the same time, protection of DNA against oxidative stress also has to be taken care of. Our findings here show that Ms-Dps has a unique capability of protecting the DNA from such oxidative damage without physically interacting with it. This protection appears to be carried out by the ability of Ms-Dps to chelate out Fe2+ ions in the vicinity of DNA and to oxidize them to Fe3+ using molecular oxygen. This reaction bypasses the Fenton's reaction by which DNA-damaging OH· radicals are generated. Thus by oxidizing Fe2+ to Fe3+, Ms-Dps is capable of protecting the most important molecule of the bacterial cell in critical situations. The temperature incubation step involved in the conversion of Ms-Dps from non-DNA binding to DNA binding form is interesting. This indicates that the trimeric species, the non-DNA binding form of Ms-Dps, is more stable and naturally occurring in M. smegmatis. It needs to take care of only the oxidative radicals generated during normal growth. Under stress conditions such as entry into stationary phase or nutrient deprivation, where other DNA damaging agents also come into the picture, oligomerization of Dps into a dodecamer becomes a necessity to provide more efficient DNA protection by physically shielding the DNA. It should be mentioned here that for protein purification we have grown the cells at 37 °C, and then all the further purification steps were performed at 4 °C. The trimeric form of Ms-Dps thus obtained could be irreversibly converted to dodecameric form upon incubation at 37 °C, and this is intriguing. We have no simple answer to this apparent discrepancy. It appears that in vivo Ms-Dps maintains equilibrium between trimer and dodecamer as a function of growth or by the participation of other factors. Perhaps this conversion is not irreversible as we have noticed in vitro; we are currently pursuing a detailed analysis of the same. We thank Dr. S. S. Indy, IISc for help in electron microscopic analysis."

Several genetic approaches revealed that trypanothione reductase is essential for the parasites (Ref. 5Krieger S. Schwarz W. Ariyanayagam M.R. Fairlamb A.H. Krauth-Siegel R.L. Clayton C. Mol.

So far the trypanothione metabolism is the only known thiol system of the parasites where it replaces the otherwise ubiquitous glutathione/glutathione reductase couple. We could show that African trypanosomes contain also a classical thioredoxin but the respective specific reductase has not yet been described in any kinetoplastid organism (6Reckenfelderbäumer N.

Trypanothione is the donor of reducing equivalents in several vital pathways of the parasites, like reduction dehydroascorbate (7Krauth-Siegel R.L. Lüdemann H. Mol. Biochem.

Trypanosomes are exposed to various reactive oxygen species such as superoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide, and products of the host myeloperoxidase system. However, their ability to cope with oxidative stress seems to be surprisingly weak. Although pathogenic trypanosomes possess an iron-containing superoxide dismutase, they lack both catalase and a selenocysteine-containing classical glutathione peroxidase (GPX),1 which are the main hydroperoxide metabolising enzymes in the mammalian host. In trypanosomatids, the metabolism of hydrogen peroxides is achieved by a unique trypanothione-dependent cascade first described in the insect parasite Crithidia fasciculata (12Gommel D.U.

With NADPH as final electron donor, the reducing equivalents flow from trypanothione onto tryparedoxin and finally a tryparedoxin peroxidase, which then catalyzes the reduction of the hydroperoxide. The latter enzyme is a member of the 2-Cys peroxiredoxin protein family. Components of this pathway have been demonstrated in many trypanosomatid organisms (14Flohé L. Steinert P. Hecht H.J.

Distinct mitochondrial tryparedoxin peroxidases have been found in T. cruzi (15Wilkinson S.R. Temperton N.J. Mondragon A. Kelly J.M. J. Biol.

Classical glutathione peroxidases are selenoproteins, which catalyze the reduction of different hydroperoxides at the expense of glutathione (17Flohé L. Loschen G. Gunzler W.A. Eichele E.

Four distinct selenocysteine-glutathione peroxidases occur in mammals, cytosolic GPX 1, also called classic or cellular GPX, gastrointestinal GPX 2, the GPX 3 found in human plasma, and the phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase GPX 4 (19Brigelius-Flohé R.

Classical glutathione peroxidases have so far only been detected in vertebrates and a GPX 4 in the helminth Schistosoma mansoni(21Williams D.L. Pierce R.J. Cookson E. Capron A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 52: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Genes encoding homologous proteins in which the active site selenocysteine is replaced by cysteine are widely distributed in nature but in most cases catalytic activities have not yet been demonstrated. Recently a putative cysteine-containing glutathione peroxidase has been studied in the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The recombinant protein proved to be much more efficient with thioredoxin than with glutathione as electron source (22Sztajer H. Gamain B. Aumann K.D. Slomianny C. Becker K. Brigelius-Flohé R.

In T. cruzithe gene of a cysteine homologue of glutathione peroxidases has been cloned and overexpressed and the recombinant protein has been described as glutathione peroxidase (23Wilkinson S.R. Meyer D.J. Kelly J.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 755-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The reported activity with glutathione was extremely low, resulting in an apparent V maxof 30 milliunits/mg in the presence of 3 mm GSH and aK m for GSH of about 7 mm. Recently the enzyme was shown also to use trypanothione/tryparedoxin as electron source to reduce different hydroperoxides but not hydrogenperoxide (24Wilkinson S.R. Meyer D.J. Taylor M.C.

The marginal activity of the T. cruzi enzyme with GSH and the fact that the GSH concentration is conspicuously low in trypanosomes prompted us to study the respective peroxidase system in African trypanosomes and to elucidate the physiological electron donor(s). Here we report on the cloning and functional characterization of the T. brucei peroxidase. The enzyme accepts different thiols as substrate but shows a very high preference for the trypanothione/tryparedoxin couple.

Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against the recombinant T. brucei peroxidase were produced by BioScience, Göttingen. Cultured procyclic T. brucei cells of strain 449 [strain 427 (MiTat 1, Ref. 28Melville S.E. Leech V. Navarro M. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem.

Long slender and short stumpy cells isolated from mice, and cultured procyclic cells (all of strain AnTat 1.1, Ref. 30Van Meirvenne N. Janssens P.G. Magnus E. Ann. Soc. Belg. Med. Trop. 1975; 55: 1-23PubMed Google Scholar) were a gift of Dr. Dietmar Steverding, Heidelberg. Isolated T. brucei mitochondria were kindly provided by Dr. André Schneider, Fribourg, Switzerland. Trypanothione disulfide was purchased from Bachem, t-butyl hydroperoxide and cumene hydroperoxide from Sigma. Total RNA of T. brucei bloodstream form parasites of strain 449 was reverse transcribed with OmniscriptTM Reverse Transcriptase (Qiagen). The cDNA was amplified by 10 cycles of PCR using a spliced leader primer (5′-CTATTATTAGAACAGTTTCTGTAC-3′) and an oligo(T) primer (95 °C, 2 min; 95 °C, 1 min; 50 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 5 min; 10 cycles; 72 °C, 10 min). The 5′-region of the peroxidase gene was amplified from the cDNA pool with a gene-specific primer (5′-ATCAATGAGGAAGGATGTAAAGTTCC-3′) and the spliced leader primer. For the 3′-region a gene-specific primer (5′-CTCATGCTGCGTTCATCTCGG-3′) and the oligo(T) primer were used (94 °C, 2 min; 94 °C, 30 s; 50 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 3 min; 30 cycles; 72 °C, 5 min). Two specific primers (5′-GCGCGGATCCCTGCGTTCATCTCGG-3′ and 5′-GCATGGTACCCAGCGACAAATCC-3′) were derived from the resulting sequences for gene amplification from genomic DNA of bloodstream strain 449 (94 °C, 2 min; 94 °C, 30 s; 50 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 2 min; 30 cycles; 72 °C, 5 min). The PCR product was cloned using the BamHI and KpnI restriction sites (underlined sequences) into the pQE-30 vector (Qiagen) and used as digoxigenin-labeled hybridization probe for screening the P1 library. Labeling and luminescence detection components from Roche Molecular Biochemicals were used as described by the provider. Four positive clones were isolated, digested withPvuII and BamHI, and the three positive fragments obtained were subcloned into the pBluescript KS(+) vector (Stratagene). Both strands of the subclones were completely sequenced by MWG Biotech. The sequence of the complete peroxidase locus later revealed that the 5′- and 3′-primers used to generate the hybridization probe corresponded to px III and px I or II, respectively, and that the genomic amplification had generated a chimeric product. Therefore for the functional characterization of the peroxidase III (Px III) protein, the authentic gene was cloned and overexpressed as described below. Genomic DNA of T. brucei strain 449 was prepared using the DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen). 10 μg of DNA was digested with the respective restriction enzyme. The fragments were separated on a 1% agarose gel, blotted onto HybondTM-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized with the digoxigenin-labeled peroxidase gene. Total RNA from cultured T. brucei cells of procyclic and bloodstream strains 449 (7 × 108 cells) was prepared with the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). Poly(A)+mRNA was enriched from 475 μg of total RNA using the Oligotex® mRNA Kit (Qiagen) and separated on a 1% agarose gel containing 1.8% formaldehyde. Blotting and hybridization were performed as described above. For the production of the recombinant peroxidase III with an N-terminal His6 tag, the coding region without the initial ATG was amplified by PCR using gene-specific primers (5′-GCGCGGATCCCTGCGTTCATCTCGG-3′ and 5′-GCATGGTACCGTCCAGAGACGTATTC-3′) and genomic DNA from procyclic strain AnTat 1.1 (94 °C, 2 min; 94 °C, 30 s; 50 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 2 min; 35 cycles; 72 °C, 5 min, Pfu polymerase). The amplification product was digested withKpnI and BamHI, cloned into the pQE-30 vector (Qiagen), and sequenced. Competent Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue cells were transformed with the pQE-30/px III plasmid. A 5-ml overnight culture was diluted 1:100 in 2× YT medium containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin. The cells were grown at 37 °C and 180 rpm to an OD600 of 0.6. Expression was induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside overnight at 30 °C. After centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in 15 ml of buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) containing 10 mm imidazole, 150 nm pepstatin, 4 nm cystatin, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.5 mg lysozyme, 0.15 mg DNase A, and disintegrated by sonification. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was applied onto a 4-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetate matrix Superflow column (Qiagen). The column was washed with 50 ml of 25 mm imidazole in buffer A, and the His-tagged protein was eluted with 250 mm imidazole in buffer A. The protein fractions were analyzed for homogeneity by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stored at 4 °C. The protein concentration was determined using the bicin choninic acid kit (Pierce). For homogenous peroxidase III, a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml corresponds to an ΔA 280 of 1. The subunit composition of T. brucei peroxidase III was determined by FPLC on a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences). 160 μg of purified recombinant protein was applied onto the column equilibrated in 0.1 mpotassium phosphate buffer, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0 and run at room temperature with a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Bovine serum albumin, rabbit aldolase, horse cytochrome c, and ferritin served as molecular mass standards. Culture-adapted bloodstream T. brucei of cell line 449 were grown in HMI-9 medium (31Hirumi H. Hirumi K. J. Parasitol. 1989; 75: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar) supplemented with 1.5 mm cysteine, 0.0014% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, and 0.2 μg/ml phleomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Cultured cells and mice isolates (2 × 106 trypanosomes each) were centrifuged. The cell pellets were mixed with 20 μl of loading buffer (0.25 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 8% (v/v) SDS, 40% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm DTE, 0.04% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and directly loaded onto a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto a HybondTM-P membrane (AmershamBiosciences) by semidry electroblotting and probed with the polyclonal rabbit antiserum against the recombinant protein (dilution 1:1000). Anti-rabbit IgG (dilution 1:5000) served as secondary antibody. The immune complex was visualized using the ECL plus system (AmershamBiosciences). Glutathione peroxidase activity was measured at 25 °C in a total volume of 90 μl in 0.1 mTris, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.6, containing 240 μmNADPH, 2.5–12 mm GSH, 75 milliunits of human glutathione reductase, 4 μm T. brucei peroxidase, and 50 μm hydroperoxide. The reaction was followed at 340 nm by measuring the glutathione reductase catalyzed oxidation of NADPH. The total concentration of the hydroperoxide substrate was determined by allowing the reaction to run to completion, and the concentration at each time point was calculated from the initial concentration. The assays were standardized with glutathione peroxidase from bovine erythrocytes (Sigma). Thioredoxin peroxidase activity was assayed as described above except that GSH and glutathione reductase were replaced by 1.5–20 μm T. brucei thioredoxin and human thioredoxin reductase. The trypanothione/tryparedoxin-dependent peroxidase activity was measured at a fixed concentration of 100 μmtrypanothione, 90 milliunits of trypanothione reductase, 0.6–8.3 μm tryparedoxin, and 1 μm peroxidase. All other parameters were those described above for the glutathione peroxidase assay. The reactions were started by adding the hydroperoxide substrate (H2O2,t-butyl hydroperoxide, cumene hydroperoxide). Control assays lacked the peroxidase, tryparedoxin, GSH, thioredoxin, and trypanothione, respectively. Concentration dependence of the initial velocities was obtained by analyzing the time progression curve of NADPH consumption in a Beckman DU 65 spectrophotometer with data acquisition every 1.5 s. The data were analyzed using the integrated Dalziel equation for a two substrate enzyme reaction (32Dalziel K. Acta Chem. Scand. 1957; 11: 27670-27678Google Scholar, 33Forstrom J.W. Stults F.H.

The genome sequencing project of Trypanosoma brucei revealed several fragments encoding a glutathione peroxidase-related gene. Based on this information, the gene has been cloned from cDNA of bloodstream parasites of strain 449. The 5′-region was amplified by PCR using a sequence specific reverse primer and a spliced leader primer, which is the very 5′-end of all trypanosomal mRNAs added by transsplicing. The 3′-region was amplified with a specific forward primer and a poly(T) primer. The complete coding region of the gene was then amplified from genomic DNA with two gene-specific primers and used as hybridization probe in Southern blot analysis. Digestion of T. brucei genomic DNA (procyclic strain 927–449) with several restriction enzymes revealed the presence of more than one peroxidase gene (Fig.1 A). The combined digestion with PvuII and BamHI resulted in three fragments of ≥0.9 kb, each fragment being larger than the coding region of the gene (about 0.5 kb) used for hybridization. The upper band in thePvuII digest represents two fragments of which one is cleaved in the double digestion with BamHI yielding the 1.2-kb fragment. To elucidate the complete structure of the locus, a P1 library of T. brucei genomic DNA (strain TREU 927/4) on high density filters was screened with the peroxidase probe. Four positive clones were obtained which yielded an identical restriction pattern (data not shown). The three positive fragments of P1 clone 21E1 were cloned and sequenced (EMBL/GenBankTM accession numberAJ298281). The sequence and Southern blot data were in accordance with a genomic locus of 4.4 kb containing three clustered peroxidase genes (px I–px III) (Fig. 1 B). The existence of more than three gene copies can be excluded since the BsaI/BamHI fragment of 3.2 kb comprises all three peroxidase genes. Further thorough Southern blot analyses of genomic DNA digested withEcoRI, EcoRV, BamHI,HindIII, Bsp143I, and BsaI fully agreed with the arrangement of three genes depicted in Fig.1 B. Some of the blots showed a few very faint additional bands, which may indicate the existence of distantly related gene(s) outside this locus. The three protein sequences deduced from the genomic peroxidase locus consist of 166, 169, and 176 amino acid residues, respectively (Fig. 2). The overall sequences are almost identical except for the very N- and C-terminal regions. Peroxidase III, which is characterized here, is the largest one and has a calculated pI value of 9.5. In contrast, the peroxidases I and II have pI values of 6.28 and 8.34, respectively. The very basic pI of peroxidase III is mainly due to its N-terminal extension. The sequence MLRSSRKKMSAA is rich in positively charged and hydroxylated residues and shows homology to other exceptionally short (7–9 amino acid residues) mitochondrial targeting signals of trypanosomatids (34Schöneck R. Billaut-Mulot O. Numrich P. Ouaissi M.A. Krauth-Siegel R.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar,35Häusler T. Stierhof Y.D. Blattner J. Clayton C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 240-251PubMed Google Scholar). When the gene is overexpressed from the pQE-30/pxIII inE. coli, two protein species are obtained, one with the His6 tag and the complete N-terminal sequence and a second about a 2-kDa smaller protein, which does not bind to the metal matrix. Both proteins are fully active. N-terminal Edman degradation revealed that the recombinant protein has been cleaved between two basic residues of the RKK motif resulting in a protein starting with (K)KMSAA. The motif is obviously recognized by a bacterial protease. Interestingly, T. brucei possesses an endopeptidase which preferentially cleaves after two basic residues and which has been discussed to play a role in protein processing (36Kornblatt M.J. Mpimbaza G.W. Lonsdale-Eccles J.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 293: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Px III has also a C-terminal ARL motif, which could be a variation of the peroxisomal and glycosomal PTS 1 targeting signal SKL. Since such variations have been shown to be functional (37Sommer J.M. Cheng Q.L. Keller G.A. Wang C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), the peroxidase III might be also localized in glycosomes. The structurally closely related T. cruziperoxidase I possesses a C-terminal ARI sequence and occurs both in the cytosol and in glycosomes (24Wilkinson S.R. Meyer D.J. Taylor M.C. Bromley E.V. Miles M.A. Kelly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17062-17071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The other two T. bruceiproteins Px I and Px II lack known signal peptides and are probably located in the cytoplasm of the parasites. Except from the very N- and C-terminal regions, only eight residues are not identical in the three proteins (Fig. 2). Five substitutions are found only in Px I and the other three in the Px II sequence. In any case, only two different residues occur at the respective position. Two of these biases (positions 59 and 86 in Px III) are even present when comparing the peroxidase III sequences from strain TREU 927/4 (27Turner C.M. Sternberg J. Buchanan N. Smith E. Hide G. Tait A. Parasitology. 1990; 101: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and strain AnTat 1.1 (30Van Meirvenne N. Janssens P.G. Magnus E. Ann. Soc. Belg. Med. Trop. 1975; 55: 1-23PubMed Google Scholar). With the possible exception of lysines 131 and 165, which occur only in the peroxidase II, the substitutions seem to be randomly distributed in accordance with a microheterogeneity of these genes. Taken together, the data suggest very similar or identical catalytic properties for the three peroxidases. The primary structures of the T. brucei peroxidases described here classify the proteins as members of a large protein family comprising the selenocysteine-containing glutathione peroxidases (GPX). Classical glutathione peroxidases have a strictly conserved catalytic triad composed of a Se-Cys, a Gln, and a Trp residue (Fig. 3). The highest similarity of the T. brucei peroxidases is found with aT. cruzi protein described as glutathione peroxidase I (23Wilkinson S.R. Meyer D.J. Kelly J.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 755-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar,24Wilkinson S.R. Meyer D.J. Taylor M.C. Bromley E.V. Miles M.A. Kelly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17062-17071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) where 72% of all residues are conserved (Fig. 3). In the trypanosomal proteins the selenocysteine is replaced by a cysteine residue as it is the case in the protein of the malarial parasiteP. falciparum (22Sztajer H. Gamain B. Aumann K.D.

Chem. 2001; 276: 7397-7403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and many functionally not well characterized plant proteins. To other members of the family the highest degree of similarity is found with glutathione peroxidase-like proteins from plants; for instance 49% of all residues are identical in the putative phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase fromArabidopsis thaliana (38Sugimoto M. Sakamoto W. Genes Genet. Syst. 1997; 72: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The closest relative of the four human selenocysteine-containing glutathione peroxidases is the phospholipid hydroperoxide GPX 4 (39% identity), followed by the cytosolic GPX 1 (35%), the gastrointestinal GPX 2 (30%), and the extracellular GPX 3 (25%). The 3-dimensional structures of bovine erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase (GPX 1) and of the human plasma glutathione peroxidase (GPX 3) (39Epp O. Ladenstein R. Wendel A. Eur. J.

For the cytosolic bovine GPX 1, several basic residues have been suggested to play a role in glutathione binding (39Epp O. Ladenstein R. Wendel A. Eur. J.

Although calreticulin is a soluble, luminal protein, calnexin is a type I membrane protein (1Williams D.B. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 123-132Google Scholar, 2Michalak M. Milner R.E. Burns K. Opas M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 681-692Google Scholar). Segments of these proteins share amino acid identity ranging from 42 to 78% (3Wada I. Rindress D. Cameron P.H. Ou W.-J. Doherty J.J. II Louvard D. Bell A.W. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19599-19610Google Scholar). Calreticulin is a highly conserved ubiquitous protein (Mr 46,000) and has been implicated in Ca2+ storage and intracellular Ca2+ signaling in the sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticula (4Smith M.J. Koch G.L.E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3581-3586Google Scholar, 5Krause K.-H. Michalak M. Cell. 1997; 88: 439-443Google Scholar). CRT has been divided into three regions: the N-terminal, the C-terminal, and the central P-domain, which consists of short sequence motifs repeated three times in tandem. The N-terminal domain is highly conserved among CRTs from different species and potentially mediates interactions between CRT and the ER folding catalysts, protein disulfide isomerase and ERp57 (6Corbett E.F. Oikawa K. Francois P. Tessier D.C. Kay C. Bergeron J.J.M. Thomas D.Y. Krause K.-H. Michalak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6203-6211Google Scholar, 7Baksh S. Burns K. Andrin C. Michalak M. J. Biol.

Recent studies show that the P-domain, previously thought to be involved in oligosaccharide binding, interacts directly with ERp57 (8Frickel Eva-Maria Riek R. Jelesarov I. Helenius A. Wüthrich K.

The C-domain is characterized by a high content of acidic residues (4Smith M.J. Koch G.L.E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3581-3586Google Scholar, 11Fliegel L. Burns K. MacLennan D.H. Reithmeier R.A.F. Michalak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21522-21528Google Scholar), which is consistent with the location of a low affinity (K d = ∼1–2 mm), high capacity (∼25–50 mol) calcium-binding site (12Ostwald T.J. MacLennan D.H. Dorrington K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5867-5871Google Scholar) and contains the ER retrieval sequence.The ER plays an essential role in the folding and maturation of newly synthesized proteins in the secretory pathway. ER quality control operates at various levels; one of the most common modifications of proteins translocated into the ER is the addition ofN-linked glycans (13Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Google Scholar). CRT has been found to bind to partially trimmed, monoglucosylated glycans, and it has been shown that the binding of calreticulin involves a direct oligosaccharide-protein interaction specific for monoglucosylated oligosaccharides (14Spiro R.G. Zhu Q. Bhoyroo V. Söling H.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11588-11594Google Scholar, 15Peterson J.R. Ora A. Nguyen Van P. Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1173-1184Google Scholar, 16Rodan A.R.

Recently the crystal structure of the luminal domain of calnexin has been published (18Schrag J.D. Bergeron J.J.M. Li Y. Borisova S. Hahn M. Thomas D.Y. Cygler M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 633-644Google Scholar), which shows a single carbohydrate-binding site in its lectin domain. Given the sequence similarity between calnexin and calreticulin, the carbohydrate-binding site in the latter should reside in the corresponding homologous domain.The binding of CRT is exquisitely specific for the monoglucosylatedN-linked oligosaccharides, which appear as transient intermediates in vivo. The chaperone function of calreticulin is assisted by two enzymes of contrasting catalytic activities: UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase and glucosidase. The sequential action of glucosidase I and II removes two glucose residues from Glc3Man5–9GlcNAc2 fromN-linked glycoproteins in the ER (19Ora A. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26060-26062Google Scholar), whereas UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase catalyzes the addition of glucose on the nonreducing end mannose of the α1–3 arm of Man5–9GlcNAc2 chains of unfolded glycoproteins, thereby acting as a folding sensor (20Sousa M.C. Parodi A.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4196-4203Google Scholar, 21Parodi A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1462: 287-295Google Scholar). Repeated cycles of reglucosylation by the glucosyltransferase lead to prolonged association of calreticulin with the unfolded protein until its appropriate folding occurs. Should this process fail, the protein is retrotranslocated to the cytosol and subsequently degraded by the proteasome (22Tsai B. Ye Y. Rapoport T.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 246-255Google Scholar).Substrate studies have identified the single-terminal glucose residue as a critical determinant recognized by calreticulin because oligosaccharides containing 0, 2, or 3 glucose residues fail to bind (14Spiro R.G. Zhu Q. Bhoyroo V. Söling H.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11588-11594Google Scholar, 23Ware F. Vassilakos A. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4697-4704Google Scholar). Oligosaccharide binding is critical for the formation of complexes between glycoproteins and calreticulin. IfN-linked glycosylation is blocked with tunicamycin or if production of the Glc1Man9GlcNAc2species is prevented by treatment with the glucosidase inhibitors castenospermine or deoxynojirimycin, the binding of calreticulin to a vast majority of proteins is inhibited (15Peterson J.R. Ora A. Nguyen Van P. Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1173-1184Google Scholar, 24Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Google Scholar).Thus, because of the importance of the calreticulin-glycoprotein interaction in various biological processes, the study of calreticulin-oligosaccharide interactions at the molecular level has become imperative. The oligosaccharide binding studies on calreticulin and calnexin have been limited because of the nonavailability ofN-linked sugar Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 in sufficient amounts from natural sources as well as the difficulty in synthesizing such large oligosaccharide structures. Here, we report the interaction of di-, tri-, and tetrasaccharide with calreticulin using the quantitative technique of isothermal titration calorimetry. We report the stoichiometry, binding constant, and various thermodynamic parameters for these interactions. Calreticulin-sugar binding is enthalpically driven, the binding enthalpies of tetrasaccharide being larger than those of the trisaccharide and the enthalpies of trisaccharide binding being larger than those observed for disaccharide. These thermodynamic data thus define in quantitative terms the extended combining site of calreticulin for the glucosylated arm of the oligosaccharide. Moreover, these data are consistent with the model of the complexes of calreticulin with these sugars.RESULTSWe studied the oligosaccharide binding properties of calreticulin by isothermal titration calorimetry as it provides a direct estimate of the binding constants (Kb) and changes in enthalpy of binding (ΔHb°) as well as the stoichiometry of the reaction (n). Additionally, the results obtained were rationalized on the model of calreticulin built by its homology with the recently solved structure of calnexin (18Schrag J.D. Bergeron J.J.M. Li Y. Borisova S. Hahn M. Thomas D.Y. Cygler M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 633-644Google Scholar).Thermodynamics of Calreticulin-Sugar InteractionsThe results of a representative titration of the disaccharide, trisaccharide, and tetrasaccharide to calreticulin at 293 K are shown in Fig.1. Each of these titrations exhibits a monotonic decrease in the exothermic heat of binding with each successive injection until saturation is achieved. A nonlinear least-squares fit of the ITC data to the identical site model is also shown. The close fit of the data to the identical site model shows that calreticulin has only one type of site for its complementary sugar ligand. The thermodynamic parameters, ΔGb°, ΔHb°, and ΔSb at 279 and 293 K, determined from the titration calorimetry measurements are presented in Table I. The values ofKb increase almost by a factor of 2 from tri- to tetrasaccharide. Also, there is a greater than 25-fold increase in the binding constant from di- to trisaccharide. These findings demonstrate that calreticulin recognizes all four of the residues on the glucosylated branch of the Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide. The disaccharide Manα1–2ManαMe and Manα1–3ManαMe did not show any binding to the protein, thus demonstrating the importance of the terminal glucose residue for the interaction. These studies are qualitatively consistent with those of Williams and colleagues (38Vassilakos A. Michalak M. Lehrman M. Williams D.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3480-3490Google Scholar), who tested a variety of mono-, di-, and oligosaccharides for their ability to inhibit the binding of [3H]Glc1Man9GlcNAc2to GST-CRT immobilized on glutathione-agarose. The smallest inhibitory compounds were the disaccharides, Glcα1–3Man and Glcα1–3Glc. Also, the trisaccharide, Glcα1–3Manα1–2Man, and the tetrasaccharide, Glcα1–3Manα1–2Manα1–2Man, were ∼100- and ∼500-fold, respectively, more potent inhibitors than the disaccharides.Table IThermodynamic quantities for the binding of sugars to calreticulinLigandTnK b × 10−4−ΔG°b−ΔH°bΔS bKm−1kcal/molkcal/molcal/mol/KDisaccharide Glcα1–3Man2790.87 (±0.06)4.19 (±0.13)5.89 (±0.04)1.84 (±0.12)14.49 (±0.67)2930.95 (±0.07)2.2 (±0.12)5.82 (±0.03)2.30 (±0.15)11.87 (±0.58)Trisaccharide Glcα1–3Manα1–2Man2790.91 (±0.05)112.0 (±5.18)7.70 (±0.03)5.70 (±0.33)7.20 (±0.45)2930.93 (±0.03)56.3 (±3.13)7.69 (±0.03)7.30 (±0.24)1.37 (±0.92)Tetrasaccaride Glcα1–3Manα1–2Manα1–2Man2790.87 (±0.02)230.0 (±5.6)8.10 (±0.03)9.02 (±0.29)−3.31 (±0.15)2930.92 (±0.05)102.0 (±4.9)8.05 (±0.03)10.44 (±0.38)−10.70 (±1.26)Each value is an average of four determinations.

Open table in a new tab The thermodynamics of the binding reaction presented in Table Ishows that the binding reaction is entropically driven for Glcα1–3ManαMe and enthalpically driven for the tetrasaccharide, whereas for the trisaccharide, Glcα1–3Manα1–2ManαMe, the switch between these two modes occur. The changes in enthalpy observed upon the binding of tetrasaccharide are the highest. Also from the data in Table I, it appears that the changes in enthalpy and entropy upon binding are compensatory (Fig.2). Similar enthalpy-entropy compensation has been observed earlier for many protein-ligand interactions (39Lumry R. Rajender S. Biopolymers. 1970; 9: 1125-1227Google Scholar).Figure 2Enthalpy-entropy compensation plot of ΔH b ° as a function ofTΔS b for the binding of di (▴)-, tri (▾)-, and tetrasaccharide (●) to calreticulin.The plot shows a linear relationship with a slope of 1.25.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Calreticulin Modeling StudiesA model of calreticulin based upon the structure of calnexin is shown in Fig.3 B. The modeling studies provided a rationale for the sugar specificity of calreticulin. The binding site residues in calreticulin for glucose corresponding to those in calnexin are Tyr-109, Lys-111, Tyr-128, Met-131, Asp-135, Gly-124, and Asp-317 (Fig. 4 and Ref.18Schrag J.D. Bergeron J.J.M. Li Y. Borisova S. Hahn M. Thomas D.Y. Cygler M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 633-644Google Scholar). The monosaccharide, i.e. GlcαMe, was hydrogen-bonded to the side chains of Tyr-109, Tyr-128, Asp-135, and Asp-317. The best conformer of the disaccharide interacted with the protein through six hydrogen bonds made by the second sugar moiety along with the five hydrogen bonds contributed by the first sugar. The addition of the third sugar to the disaccharide introduced three more hydrogen bonds with the protein. The fourth sugar of the tetrasaccharide contributed three additional hydrogen bonds to the interactions with the protein. Likewise, the nonpolar interactions also increased with the size of the oligosaccharide chain. The contacts with the residues of the protein made by the four sugars are listed in Table II.Figure 3A, the sequence alignment of calnexin and calreticulin. The structure of calreticulin was obtained by homology modeling using the crystal structure of calnexin (PDB code1JHN).

Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONThe Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 glycan intermediate formed after cleavage of two glucose residues by α-glucosidase I and II from the precursor N-glycan Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 in the ER mediates the interaction of glycoproteins with calreticulin and calnexin. These two lectin chaperones promote the correct folding of their glycoprotein substrates.The recently solved crystal structure of calnexin shows that its sugar-binding domain has a striking similarity with that of a “legume lectin” fold (40Ravishankar R. Thomas C.J. Suguna K. Surolia A. Vijayan M. Proteins. 2001; 43: 260-270Google Scholar, 41Prabu M.M. Suguna K. Vijayan M. Proteins. 1999; 35: 58-69Google Scholar, 42Srinivas V.R. Reddy G.B. Ahmad N.

Thus, a wealth of data on the molecular features of carbohydrate recognition by legume lectins helps us to explain in molecular terms the mode of interaction of the saccharides to calreticulin (43Sharma V. Vijayan M. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21209-21213Google Scholar, 44Dam T.K. Brewer C.F. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 387-429Google Scholar, 45Surolia A. Sharon N. Schwarz F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17697-17703Google Scholar). In CRT, as in legume lectins, the concave and convex sheets are made of six and seven strands, respectively, whereas the roof region consists of only two strands as compared with five in legume lectins (Fig. 3 B). An important finding that comes from the modeling studies is that the presence of a helix behind the convex β-sheet perhaps shields the hydrophobic regions of the sheet, thus preventing the oligomerization through interactions between the “convex” sheets of the monomers. This in turn explains why CRT, in contrast to the legume lectins, exists as a monomer.Elucidation of the stoichiometry of interaction of calreticulin with its substrate has been a matter of speculations and debate. The ITC data presented here establish unambiguously that calreticulin-sugar interactions have a stoichiometry of 1 (Fig. 1). Indeed, the recent structural solution of calnexin also reports one site for glucose binding in this molecule, although the low affinity of this ligand and the consequent low occupancy of the chaperone with glucose cannot be ignored at this moment. The extremely low affinity of glucose for calreticulin is not surprising (Kb ∼ 60m−1), 2M. Kapoor and A. Surolia, unpublished results. as the modeling studies do not show any aromatic residue within the striking distance for stacking with the monosaccharide. The importance of the stacking interactions between the hydrophobic β-face of the pyranose ring of the monosaccharide and the lectins is well known (46Chandra N.R. Prabu M.M. Suguna K. Vijayan M. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 857-866Google Scholar). For example, the studies of Sharma and Surolia (47Sharma V. Surolia A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 433-445Google Scholar) explicitly noted that the failure of Phaseolus vulgarislectin to bind to monosaccharides is related to the absence of such a stacking interaction. Indeed, the introduction of an aromatic residue in a P. vulgaris mutant that can stack with the monosaccharide makes up for this deficiency of the native protein (48Hamelryck T.W. Dao-Thi M.H. Poortmans F. Chrispeels M.J. Wyns L. Loris R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20479-22048Google Scholar). The inability of manno-oligosaccharides by themselves to bind shows that glucose at the nonreducing end is necessary for saccharide substrates to bind to calreticulin. An essential requirement of glucose in α-1,3 linkage to mannose is supported by modeling studies showing that the equatorially oriented hydroxyl group at C-2 of glucose in the saccharide substrates is making a favorable contribution to the binding process by hydrogen bonding with Asp-317 and Tyr-109 of calreticulin (Table II). The lack of such an interaction between oligosaccharides devoid of α-1,3-linked nonreducing end glucose,i.e. as in Manα1–3Man, thus explains the obligatory requirement of glucose in α-1,3 linkage for binding to CRT.The affinity of glucose per se or methyl α-glucopyranoside to calreticulin is very poor. However, its extension by mannose in α-1,3 linkage increases the binding constant in a striking manner. The extension of this structure by mannose in α-1,2 linkage, as in Glucα1–3Manα1–2ManαMe and Glucα1–3Manα1–2Manα1–2ManαMe, enhances the binding further by 25- and 50-fold, respectively, indicating that the combining site of the chaperone consists of a number of subsites each of which can accommodate a hexapyranosyl residue. As the −ΔG for any of the saccharides equals the sum of the free energies from each subsite filled, the contribution of −ΔG from each subsite of calreticulin is obtained by comparing a pair of saccharides. These values together with the corresponding subsite occupied by the constituent sugar units of the saccharides are shown in TableIII. An increase in −ΔG as the successive units of mannose are added supports our suggestion that subsites A–D are contiguous, favorable subsites. Of these subsites, B, C, and D are the strong binding subsites, with subsite C being the strongest, whereas subsite A is a weakly interacting subsite. These interpretations are supported by favorable changes in enthalpies as the size of the oligosaccharides is increased. Thus, subsites C and D contribute −5.0 and −3.14 kcal/mol, respectively, to the enthalpy of binding.Table IIISubsite model for calreticulinAΔGb°ΔHb°ΔSΔΔGb°ΔΔHb°ΔΔSkcal/molcal/mol/Kkcal/molcal/mol/KGlc-ManαMe−5.82−2.311.87Glc-Man-ManαMe−7.69−7.31.37−1.87−5.0−10.50Glc-Man-Man-ManαMe−8.05−10.44−10.70−0.36−3.14−9.33The saccharides are arranged in their respective subsites with the reducing end to the right. The contribution of each subsite to the association of an oligosaccharide with calreticulin was calculated by comparing the ΔGb°, ΔHb°, and ΔS values for pairs of saccharides that differ by a single sugar residue. It is assumed that an additional sugar residue (italicized) is bound at the subsite listed above. Open table in a new tab The decrease in the enthalpy of binding of saccharides with the decrease in their sizes implies more extensive hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions for the larger saccharides. This is also borne out by modeling studies, which show a progressive increase in the number of hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions from glucose to the tetrasaccharide. As the maximum increment in ΔH occurs for subsite C, it is not surprising to find that the mannosyl residue occupying this subsite is involved in a maximum number of hydrogen bonds. Generally, the hydrogen bond between the charged atom and a hydroxyl group is stronger than that involving a neutral atom (49Fersht A.R. Shi J.P. Knill-Jones J. Lowe D.M. Wilson A.J. Blow D.M. Brick P. Corles P. Waye M.M.Y. Winter G. Nature. 1985; 314: 235-238Google Scholar). A perusal of the model of calreticulin-sugar interaction indeed shows many hydrogen bonds between sugar hydroxyls and the charged atoms of CRT. This explains the greater affinities of CRT-oligosaccharide interactions as compared with other lectin-sugar interactions. In addition to hydrogen bonding, residues Arg-73, Tyr-109, Asp-125, Met-131, Leu-318, and Tyr-319 make hydrophobic interactions with the sugar. Interestingly, the phenyl ring of Trp-319 may possibly make an OH-π interaction with the third sugar (mannose of Glcα1–3Manα1–2Manα1–2ManαMe). The O-4 hydroxyl group of the mannose moiety makes contacts with all of the carbon atoms of the phenyl ring of Trp-319 within a distance ranging from 2.9 to 3.6 Å. OH-π interactions have been observed only recently in protein structures (50Steiner T. Koellner G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 535-557Google Scholar, 51Brandl M. Weiss M.S. Jabs A. Suhnel J. Hilgenfeld R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 357-377Google Scholar). In the case of protein-sugar interactions, there is only one recent example from our own laboratory (52Jeyaprakash A.A. Rani P.G. Reddy G.B. Banumathi S. Betzel C. Sekar K. Surolia A. Vijayan M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 637-645Google Scholar).Interestingly, calreticulin-saccharide interactions, unlike most other protein-carbohydrate reactions, show that for the binding of Glcα1–3ManαMe and Glcα1–3Manα1–2ManαMe, the values of free energies are more negative than those of the enthalpies (44Dam T.K. Brewer C.F. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 387-429Google Scholar). This indicates the favorable entropic effects for binding, especially for Glcα1–3ManαMe. This favorable entropic contribution could reflect the hydrophobic nature of the reaction. This is also borne out by greater burial of the apolar surface as the size of the oligosaccharide increases and is more pronounced for the disaccharide. The burial of the hydrophobic surface area was calculated by subtracting the accessible hydrophobic surface area (calreticulin and sugar) from that of the complex. A value of 122 Å was obtained for the monosaccharide, and it increased to 220 Å for the disaccharide. For the trisaccharide and tetrasaccharide, this value was 233 and 260 Å, respectively. However, as the plot of enthalpy-entropy compensation has a slope of 1.25, enthalpic factors, viz. hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions, appear to dominate calreticulin-saccharide interactions as is also attested to by modeling studies. The observation of enthalpy-entropy compensation in calreticulin-saccharide recognition can be explained in two ways (Fig.2). In one, the release or uptake of water has been explained as the primary source of this compensation (53Swaminathan C.P. Surolia N. Surolia A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5153-5159Google Scholar). Another and perhaps more likely explanation is that a progressively greater portion of the hydrophobic surface gets buried with an increase in the size of ligand. However, this favorable term is countered by the effect of the restriction of the ligand in the combining site; the larger the ligand, the tighter the binding (i.e. more number of interactions), and consequently, the greater the extent of restriction of degrees of freedom and the larger the change in the unfavorable entropy term with increasing ligand size, as observed experimentally.In conclusion, our calorimetric studies demonstrate that calreticulin has a single binding site for its respective glycan moiety and provide evidence for the interaction of various oligosaccharides with calreticulin, showing that the entire Glcα1–3Manα1–2Manα1–2Man structure of the oligosaccharide is recognized by calreticulin. Our modeling studies demonstrate that an increased number of hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions occurs as the size of the oligosaccharide is increased, which supports the observed thermodynamic data.

In T4, the gp16 (small subunit) and gp17 (large subunit) terminase proteins are essential proteins for DNA packaging. (Similar proteins are gpA and gpNu1 in λ phage, gp18 and gp19 in phage T7/T3, gp2 and gp3 in phage P22, and gp3 and gp16 in phage φ29.) As generally found among these phage terminases, the T4 small subunit confers the specific DNA-binding/association properties (1Wu C.H. Lin H. Black L.W. J. Mol.

However, because the measured in vitro ATPase activities of isolated terminase proteins (8Rubinchik S. Parris W. Gold M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13586-13593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hamada K. Fujisawa H. Minagawa T. Virology. 1987; 159: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have been low in comparison with measured rates of ATP consumption in packaging (10Guo P. Peterson C. Anderson D. J. Mol.

Virology. 1993; 193: 748-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the identification of terminases as DNA-translocating ATPases has been problematic. What is clear is that packaging is ATP-driven and involves the cooperation of the DNA-associated terminase proteins with the prohead-associated portal vertex protein (7Black L.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1989; 43: 267-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 12Frackman S. Siegele D.A. Feiss M. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 13Bazinet C. King J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1985; 39: 109-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) in phage T4, gp20. The T4 terminase large subunit protein, gp17, has proven difficult to purify because of the protein's limited solubility and toxicity to host cells (14Bhattacharyya S.P. Rao V.B. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 146: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Coexpression with the gp16 small subunit reduces toxicity; thus, gp17 could be purified with gp16 in low amounts from a temperature-induced expression vector (4Rao V.B. Black L.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A vector that makes gp17 with a 20-amino acid OmpT leader peptide results in low amounts of uninduced, soluble, and active protein, whereas the overexpressed protein is insoluble and inactive and resists renaturation (15Lin H. The Mechanism of the Phage T4 Terminase Complex, gp16 and gp17, in DNA Packaging.Ph.D. thesis. University of Maryland School of Medicine, 1996Google Scholar). A His-tagged gp17 protein was also overexpressed and showed similar problems in protein solubility as well as amino acid changes, possibly to reduce toxicity. 2R. G. Baumann and L. W. Black, unpublished data. 2R. G. Baumann and L. W. Black, unpublished data. However, Leffers and Rao (5Leffers G. Rao V.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37127-37136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) overcame these problems by modifying the growth conditions and strictly controlling the basal level expression from a His-tagged cloned gene. Although gp17 terminase is specifically assayed by its ability to make phage by in vitro DNA packaging and to bind and hydrolyze ATP (4Rao V.B. Black L.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 5Leffers G. Rao V.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37127-37136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 16Black L.W. Virology. 1981; 113: 336-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), it was unclear whether its ATPase and nuclease activities require interaction with additional nucleic acid or protein factors. To address these issues and to highly purify gp17, we employed three column steps, including the use of dsDNA- and ssDNA-cellulose to separate gp17 from other nucleic acid-interacting proteins. The purified gp17 terminase ATPase activity is stimulated by interactions with phage T4 proteins gp32 and gp20 and, most strongly, with the terminase small subunit, gp16. We also discovered that the enzyme preparation was composed of at least two forms of the protein, a form that could be activated by gp16 to a high turnover ATPase and a less active form separable by immunoprecipitation with antiserum prepared against denatured gp17. After removal of low activity protein, ATPase activity of 400 ATPs/gp17/min remained, the highest activity reported for any large subunit terminase. These experiments suggest that significant structural differences allow separation of the two forms and also show that terminase undergoes a major conformational change to form a gp16-induced multimer whose high activity is not dependent upon continued interaction with gp16. The findings advance our understanding of terminase interactions and conformational changes that lead to the catalytically active packasome. Chemicals were reagent-grade, and enzymes were used as recommended by the suppliers. Routine cloning was performed as described (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA concentrations were estimated using a spectrophotometric determination at 260 and 280 nm as described (25Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Protein determinations were made by the Bradford procedure using commercially available reagents (Bio-Rad). Full-length active gp17 was purified based on the Impact system of cloning (New England Biolabs, Inc.). To clone the wild-type gene 17 sequence into vector pCYB2 (6843 bp), a cloning method was devised employing PCR primers 1 (5′-GACGGGTAACCCTGTCGACTCATATGGAACAACCGATTAATGT-3′) and 2 (3′-GTACCATACAGTTACCATGGGCCCCCT-5′). Primer 1 was designed for the 5′-end of the gene and introduced anNdeI site immediately at the start of gene 17 (boldface). Primer 2 was designed for the 3′-end of the gene and replaced the stop codon of gene 17 with a SmaI site (boldface). Purified wild-type T4 DNA served as template for PCR, and a 1851-bp fragment was isolated, digested with NdeI/SmaI, and purified. This fragment was ligated into NdeI/SmaI-cut pCYB2, yielding vector pH5 (8634 bp). This original tacpromoter-containing vector was electroporated intoEscherichia coli DH5α, successfully making the gp17-intein/chitin-binding domain (CBD) fusion, and full-length active gp17 was purified. To improve protein yield, a new T7 promoter-driven plasmid from New England Biolabs Inc. (pTYB2, 7283 bp) was employed. The gene 17 fragment was isolated from vector pH5 afterNdeI/SacII digestion and ligated intoNdeI/SacII-cut pTYB2 to make plasmid pT5 (∼9074 bp). This vector was electroporated into E. coliHMS174(DE3) and used to perform large-scale purification of active soluble gp17 for these studies. Large-scale cultures were done at the University of Maryland Bioprocess Facility (College Park, MD). 100 liters of HMS174(DE3)/pT5 were grown to A 600 nm= 0.6, induced for 3 h with 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and pelleted (∼340 g). ∼100 g were minced with a minimum volume (200 ml) of Q buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm ZnCl2, and 1 mm ATP containing 10% glycerol), and the cells were stirred gently at 4 °C until completely homogenized. The cells were French-pressed two times at 18,000 p.s.i. and spun at 14,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was removed and recentrifuged overnight at 20,000 × g. The supernatant was removed, applied through Nalgene glass-fiber syringe prefilters, and loaded onto a 300-ml chitin column pre-equilibrated in Q buffer. The column was washed with 1–2 volumes of Q buffer, 2–3 column volumes of 1m NaCl and 0.5% Triton X-100 in Q buffer, and 1 column volume of Q buffer. 1 column volume of Q buffer with 40 mmdithiothreitol (DTT) was added, and the column was incubated overnight at 4 °C prior to eluting in 9-ml fractions with Q buffer with 40 mm DTT. The fractions showed that gp17 was cleaved from the column and eluted to near homogeneity. Peak fractions were combined, concentrated, and re-equilibrated in Q buffer with no DTT. The final volume was kept large to avoid precipitation of gp17, which we found to occur at protein concentrations over ∼0.75 mg/ml. The protein was applied to a 3-ml ssDNA/dsDNA-cellulose column (Invitrogen), and the flow-through fraction of the gp17 protein was collected. What bound to the column was eluted in Q buffer, 1 m NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100 and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Flow-through fractions were applied (1 ml/min) to a 5-ml blue Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in Q buffer. After gp17 binding, the column was washed with 25 ml of Q buffer containing 0.5m NaCl, 1 m NaCl, 10 mm ATP, and 50 mm ATP at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The protein was eluted from the column in 25 ml of 50 mm ATP and 1 mNaCl in Q buffer and dialyzed overnight against 1 liter of Q buffer (without NaCl and ATP) and then 1 liter of Q buffer containing 30% glycerol, the long-term storage buffer for enzyme at −20 °C. The enzyme has been stable for >3 years under these conditions. SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 protein staining or by blotting using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) for fluorescence detection of primary antibody bound to protein was done using standard Western blot protocols (25Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Automated Edman sequencing of the purified full-length 70-kDa gp17 protein and the sample fragmented to 65 kDa was done over six cycles directly from solution samples at the Johns Hopkins University Synthesis and Sequencing Facility. In vitropackaging was performed as previously described (17Malys N. Chang D.Y. Baumann R.G. Xie D. Black L.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 289-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Purified gp17 and gp16 proteins were preincubated with an equal volume of 8% polyethylene glycol before addition of the same volume of 2× ATPase buffer to start the reaction. The final reaction buffer was 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 0.1m NaCl, 1 mm spermidine HCl, 0.1 mmputrescine, 1 mm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP label. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C, and 1-μl aliquots were removed at various times and processed as described (26Manne V. Rao V.B. Black L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13223-13232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA cleavage assays were carried out in numerous ways, typically using a reaction mixture that finally contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mmMgCl2, 80 mm KCl, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm spermidine, and 2.7% polyethylene glycol (PEG). Mixtures of the terminase proteins (1.5 μg of gp17 + 0.5–1.5 μg of gp16) in 15 μl of buffer were made, and the reactions were started by addition of 4 μg of DNA. Various DNA substrates were analyzed, including linear marker DNAs and plasmid DNAs such as pCBR2 and pR67 (4Rao V.B. Black L.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), which contain the gene 16–17 sequence, and pDH72DE3 (29Herendeen D.R. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P.

Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 3 h and heated at 65 °C for 10 min prior to 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining following standard methods (25Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). As in the study of large viral protein assemblies (22Duda R.L. Hempel J.

Gels were run at 70–90 V (20–40 mA) from 19 to 22 °C, and the pH of the buffer was kept constant. Ferguson plot and log-log graph analyses of the gel data were done as described (23Gallagher S.R. Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science.

Glycerol gradients were made inside 5 × 41-mm polyethylene tubes by placing 300 μl of 40% glycerol in Q buffer underneath 300 μl of 10% glycerol in Q buffer and forming the gradient using a Biocomp Gradient Master 105 gradient maker set at 86° and 46 s, run at 22 rpm, and equilibrated to 4 °C. Up to 60 μl of sample could be loaded and run at 30,000 × g in an SW 50.1 swinging bucket rotor overnight at 4 °C for 15–20 h. Fractions were collected using a modified 25-gauge (5/8) needle pierced through the bottom of the tube to collect drops. Immunoprecipitation was carried out as described by Springer (27Springer T.A. Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1991: 10.16.1-10.16.10Google Scholar). Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was washed as a 50% slurry in dilution buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.025% sodium azide) and kept at 4 °C prior to use. For coupling, proteins were diluted in 200 μl of buffer; antibody from serum (usually 1–5 μl) was added; and the mixture was rocked at 4 °C for 1.5 h. 10–40 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose slurry were added, and the mixture was rocked for another 1.5 h at 4 °C. The mixture was centrifuged at low speed at 200× g, and the supernatant was carefully removed. The pellet was washed repeatedly with dilution buffer and, for gel or titer analysis, brought up in a minimum volume (50 or 100 μl) of buffer containing 5.8 g/liter NaCl, 2 g/liter MgSO4·7H2O, 50 ml/liter 1 mTris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 5 ml/liter 2% gelatin; and a fraction of the pellet slurry was analyzed. The development of polyclonal antisera raised against native and active gp16 (3Lin H. Simon M.N. Black L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3495-3501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and against the denatured form of OmpT leader/gp17 terminase has been described previously by Lin (15Lin H. The Mechanism of the Phage T4 Terminase Complex, gp16 and gp17, in DNA Packaging.Ph.D. thesis. University of Maryland School of Medicine, 1996Google Scholar), following a protocol of eluting the SDS-PAGE-isolated proteins from gels (28Hager D.A. Burgess R.R. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). To purify the gp17 IgG from the other serum proteins, 1 ml of anti-gp17 antiserum was diluted to 5 ml in Q buffer and loaded onto a 1-ml protein A column previously washed with 10 ml of water and 10 ml of 0.1m sodium citrate, pH 3–4, and equilibrated in Q buffer. After loading (0.5 ml/min), the column was washed with 10 ml of Q buffer. A large non-binding fraction of serum proteins was saved for further analysis. For IgG elution, 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 3.5, was added to the column, and IgG eluting in a single sharp peak was immediately neutralized to pH 7.0 with 2 m NaOH (∼30–35 μl/1–1.5 ml of sodium citrate/antibody wash). This antibody fraction was not stimulatory for the gp17 ATPase until further dialyzed from sodium citrate against Q buffer (with no ATP) and was concentrated to its original volume of ∼1 ml using a Centriprep C30 membrane concentrator. The serum protein fraction was also concentrated to approximately the original serum concentration. Most terminase analyses started with a 1:1 or 1:1.5 (w/w) gp17/gp16 mixture (giving a 4–6-fold molar excess of gp16), except where indicated. 30 μl (15 μg) of gp16 were first mixed with 15 μl of 12.5% PEG solution, and 15 μl (10 μg) of gp17 were added and mixed by light pipetting and then mixing for 10 min at 4 °C. 7.5 μl of crude anti-gp17 antiserum were added, and the tubes were rocked for 1 h. 50 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose slurry were added and incubated for 1 h with mixing; the tubes were spun at 1500 rpm (200 × g); and the supernatant was carefully removed for analysis. Generally, a small fraction of the immunoprecipitation supernatant was loaded onto the glycerol gradient, and 45–50-μl fractions were collected from the gradient. 6.6 μg (10 μl) of purified gp17 protein were incubated with 5 μg (10 μl) of gp16 protein for 30 min; 30 μl of purified anti-gp17 antibody were added; and the reaction was rotated for 1 h. The solution was placed on top of a 600-μl glycerol gradient (10–40%) and separated by spinning at 40,000 rpm for 5 h. SDS-PAGE or Western blot data were analyzed using the AlphaImager 2000 documentation and analysis system. Most data were visualized using the trans-white illumination apparatus and quantitated using AlphaImager Version 3.3b software (Alpha Innotech Corp.). Purification of the gp17 terminase large subunit was based on the New England Biolabs intein/CBD fusion protein method. Gene 17 was cloned into the pTYB2 fusion vector to make vector pT5, which expresses the gp17-intein/CBD fusion. In the cell lysate, this fusion protein was >75% soluble and produced in large amounts as detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-gp17 antibody (Fig. 1 A). Significant accumulation of fusion protein was detected after 3 h of induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. For protein preparation, cells expressing the gp17 fusion protein were induced for 3 h, centrifuged, and lysed by French press, and the clarified supernatant containing the fusion protein was loaded onto a chitin column (see “Experimental Procedures”). As Fig. 1 Bshows, many proteins were removed in the insoluble pellet fractions (P 1 and P 2 lanes) or did not bind and eluted in the flow-through fraction of the column (FT lanes). Many other proteins, bound nonspecifically to chitin or associated weakly with the gp17-intein/CBD fusion protein, could also be removed after washing the column (W 1and W 2 lanes). After equilibration of the column overnight in DTT, cleaved gp17 protein eluted over the span of many fractions (fractions 6–36) (Fig. 1 B). Further analysis showed that the isolated protein could be concentrated from these dilute fractions using Amicon filtration membranes, but had a solubility limit of ∼0.75 mg/ml. gp17 from the chitin column is apparently homogeneous as determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 B). Nevertheless, we discovered that gp17 in fractions eluted from the chitin column was slowly converted to 68- and 65-kDa forms if stored at 4 °C without further purification. In Fig. 2, sample A represents the full-length chitin-purified protein, which was slowly converted to sample B. The samples were N-terminally sequenced, and the results of this analysis (Fig. 2, boldface) confirmed that sample A was the full-length gp17 (70 kDa) and that the transition to sample B (65 kDa) resulted from cleavage of gp17 at two distinct positions in its C terminus, both of which were identified within the gp17 sequence by N-terminal sequencing of six amino acid residues of the released peptides. We also found that gp17 did not bind to ssDNA-cellulose (4Rao V.B. Black L.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) or dsDNA-cellulose (this work), and the use of these media removed not only the proteolytic activity, but also contaminating nucleases present in the preparation that interfered with subsequent analysis. In fact, washing ssDNA/dsDNA-cellulose after gp17 elution with 1 m NaCl and 1% Triton X-100 and concentrating showed that E. coliproteins, some close in size to gp17 and some that cross-reacted with anti-gp17 antibody upon longer exposure of Western blots, were purified from the gp17 sample (data not shown). As a final step, gp17 was bound to blue Sepharose and washed with 1 m NaCl or 50 mm ATP and was not removed from the column until elution at both concentrations of NaCl and ATP (4Rao V.B. Black L.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). After elution, the protein was dialyzed thoroughly in storage buffer and stored unfrozen at −20 °C or frozen at −80 °C. This purification procedure yielded ∼60 mg of gp17 from 33 liters of cells, a significant improvement over previously described methods. The packaging of T4 DNA in vitro is the definitive test of the identity and functionality of the terminase proteins (4Rao V.B. Black L.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 16Black L.W. Virology. 1981; 113: 336-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 17Malys N. Chang D.Y. Baumann R.G. Xie D.

In this assay, extracts are made with 16am17amΔrIIA(H88) mutant phage that produce all components necessary to assemble phage except for terminase proteins. Addition of terminase proteins (gp16 + gp17)in vitro to these extracts showed that new phage can be packaged and completed, indicating that the gp17 protein is functional (Table I). Mixed extracts of mutant phage-infected bacteria also produced phage, as expected; but addition of high concentrations of purified terminase proteins enhanced activity ∼10-fold. The use of this purified gp17 protein resulted in a marked improvement (>100-fold) over titers using previously purified terminase proteins (4Rao V.B. Black L.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), approaching the wild-type level (yield of ∼10%) of phage that were synthesized under the extract growth conditions and agreeing with more recently determined values (5Leffers G.

Open table in a new tab Numerous attempts were made to determine whether gp17 alone or with T4 proteins with which it is known to interact can cleave DNA in vitro. Various plasmids and other linear DNAs have been analyzed, including some with the gene 16 sequence identified as the location of a Pac site (3Lin H. Simon M.N. Black L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3495-3501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar); and thus far, none have been cleaved significantly by gp17 or by gp17 co-incubated with other T4 proteins (gp20, gp16, and gp32). In numerous experiments, no significant nicking or cutting of various plasmid DNAs was seen for the terminase proteins compared with control buffer with or without co-incubation with the other T4 proteins, even when gp17 and gp16 were added at >10-fold molar excess compared with plasmid DNA. Purified gp17 was found to contain an intrinsic ATPase activity (1 ATP hydrolyzed/gp17/min) that could be significantly stimulated (∼100-fold) by addition of the gp16 small subunit terminase protein (120 ATPs hydrolyzed/gp17/min). The gp16 protein itself was previously shown to lack ATPase activity (3Lin H. Simon M.N. Black L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3495-3501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Subjecting gp17 to numerous freeze/thaw cycles did not decrease the ATPase activity of the preparation, although gp17 showed a half-life at 37 °C of ∼1 h. Addition of the polymer PEG (∼20 kDa) at 8% (w/v) to the terminase proteins increased the activity seen, presumably by promoting protein interactions. The purified terminase subunit lacked detectable nucleic acid, and addition of numerous nucleic acids failed to stimulate the ATPase. These included wild-type T4 DNA cut with restriction enzymes or uncut; λ/HindIII DNA fragments; 25-bp, 100-bp, and 1-kb DNA marker fragments; supercoiled plasmid DNA containing genes 16 and 17; relaxed plasmid DNA cut with blunt or sticky end restriction endonucleases; ssDNA; yeast tRNA; and mammalian RNA samples. None showed any substantial effects on the rates of ATP hydrolysis. Mg2+ ions were essential for the ATPase, and EDTA abolished activity. The ATPase activity was maximal at ∼5 mm MgCl2. The PEG and MgCl2effects on ATPase are in good agreement with the data for optimal T4in vitro packaging by addition of these components (4Rao V.B. Black L.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We also tested the effect of gp20 portal addition on the ATPase hydrolysis rate of gp17 plus gp16. A number of different portal protein-containing preparations were analyzed, including purified gp20 dodecamer (18Driedonks R.A. Engel A. tenHeggeler B. van Driel R. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 152: 641-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), gp20-green fluorescent protein fusion dodecamer (19Baumann R.G.

The M7IQ5 contained five calmodulins. Based upon native gel electrophoresis and gel filtration, it was found that M7IQ5 was single-headed, whereas M7full was two-headed, suggesting that the tail domain contributes to form the two-headed structure. M7IQ5 had Mg2+-ATPase activity that was markedly activated by actin with K actin of 33 μm andV max of 0.53 s−1head−1. Myosin VIIA required an extremely high ATP concentration for ATPase activity, ATP-induced dissociation from actin, and in vitro actin-translocating activity. ADP markedly inhibited the actin-activated ATPase activity. ADP also significantly inhibited the ATP-induced dissociation of myosin VIIA from actin. Consistently, ADP decreased K actin of the actin-activated ATPase. ADP decreased the actin gliding velocity, although ADP did not stop the actin gliding even at high concentration. These results suggest that myosin VIIA has slow ATP binding or low affinity for ATP and relatively high affinity for ADP.

Myosins are mechanochemical proteins with a motor domain containing an ATP and actin-binding region, a neck domain that interacts with light chains or calmodulin, and a tail domain that serves to anchor and position the motor domain so that it can properly interact with actin filaments at a specific intracellular location.

Among them, the entire coding region has been determined for myosin VIIA. In mammals, myosin VIIA is expressed in a variety of organs and tissues including eye, inner ear, olfactory epithelium, brain, choroid plexus, intestine, liver, kidney, adrenal gland, testis, and lymphocytes (12Chen Z.Y.

In the retina, myosin VIIA is found in the pigmented epithelial cells and is postulated to play a role in phagocytosis of cell debris that accumulates as a result of sloughing off of photoreceptor outer segments. Of interest is that defects of myosin VIIA cause the mouseshaker-1 phenotype and human Usher syndrome 1B, which are characterized by deafness, lack of vestibular function, and (in humans) progressive retinal degeneration (5Gibson F.

In humans, two forms of dominant and recessive nonsyndromic deafness, DFNB2 and DFNA11, are also caused by myosin VIIA mutations (16Liu X.Z. Walsh J. Mburu P. Kendrick-Jones J. Cope M.J. Steel K.P.

In the tail domain, a very short predicted coiled-coil region was found; therefore, it has been assumed that myosin VIIA forms a two-headed structure. Two “band 4.1 protein, ezrin, radixin, moesin” (FERM) 1The abbreviations used are: FERM, band 4.1 protein, ezrin, radixin, moesin; M7full, full-length myosin VIIA; DTT, dithiothreitol; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid 1The abbreviations used are: FERM, band 4.1 protein, ezrin, radixin, moesin; M7full, full-length myosin VIIA; DTT, dithiothreitol; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid domains that have been implicated in cytoskeletal protein interactions have been found in the tail region. There are two myosin tail homology 4 domains found in the tail region. Although similar domains are found in myosin IV and XV, the function of this domain is unclear. The tail domain of unconventional myosins has been implicated to serve as the anchoring site for the cellular target proteins. For myosin VIIa, several tail binding proteins have been identified. The type I regulatory subunit of protein kinase A binds to the FERM domain at the C terminus of myosin VIIA (19Kussel-Andermann P. El-Amraoui A. Safieddine S. Hardelin J.P. Nouaille S. Camonis J. Petit C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29654-29659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), although the role of protein kinase A in the function and regulation of myosin VIIA is unknown. It was shown that the FERM domain is involved in anchoring with adherens junction via a cadherin-catenins complex (20Kussel-Andermann P. El-Amraoui A. Safieddine S. Nouaille S. Perfettini I. Lecuit M. Cossart P. Wolfrum U. Petit C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6020-6029Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Todorov et al. reported (21Todorov P.T. Hardisty R.E. Brown S.D. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) that the myosin VIIA tail has an affinity for microtubule-associated protein 2B, suggesting the interaction of myosin VIIA with the microtubule-based motility system. Quite recently, El-Amraoui et al. (22El-Amraoui A. Schonn J.S. Kussel-Andermann P. Blanchard S. Desnos C. Henry J.P. Wolfrum U. Darchen F. Petit C. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) reported that myosin VIIa binds to myosin VIIa- and Rab27-interacting protein, associates with melanosomes via Rab27A, and plays a role in melanosome trafficking. On the other hand, little is known about the motor function of myosin VIIa at a molecular level.Unlike the case for the well characterized conventional myosins, it becomes evident that the motor function among various members of the unconventional myosin subfamily varies uniquely from one to another, which is thought to be critical for specific physiological roles in diverse cellular motile processes. For example, recent studies have revealed that myosin V is a processive motor that can move in large steps approximating the 36-nm pseudorepeat of the actin filament (23Walker M.L. Burgess S.A. Sellers J.R. Wang F. Hammer III, J.A. Trinick J. Knight P.J. Nature. 2000; 405: 804-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 24Sakamoto T. Amitani I. Yokota E. Ando T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Nature. 2002; 415: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These characteristics are quite important to understand the physiological function of myosin V, since the processive nature of myosin V with large step size is suitable for the motors involved in cargo movement in cells.Recently, myosin VI was also demonstrated to be a processive motor with a large step size (27Rock R.S. Rice S.E. Wells A.L. Purcell T.J. Spudich J.A. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13655-13659Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 28Nishikawa S. Homma K. Komori Y.

A unique feature of myosin VI is that it moves backward on the actin filament (29Wells A.L. Lin A.W. Chen L.Q. Safer D. Cain S.M. Hasson T. Carragher B.O. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). It was originally proposed that the myosin VI unique large insertion between the neck and converter domains is responsible for the reverse directionality of myosin VI (29Wells A.L. Lin A.W. Chen L.Q. Safer D. Cain S.M. Hasson T. Carragher B.O. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). This view was based upon the hypothesis that the orientation of the motor domain of myosin VI against actin filament is the same direction as other myosins but the attachment of the position of the “lever arm” (a long α-helical region following the motor domain) (30Block S.M. Cell. 1996; 87: 151-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) is different so that the same movement of the catalytic core would rotate the lever arm in the opposite direction on actin. Since the insertion is located between the converter domain (a compact subdomain thought to amplify the conformational change of the motor domain) (31Houdusse A. Kalabokis V.N. Himmel D. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Cell. 1999; 97: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 32Dominguez R. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. Cohen C.

The present study has determined the motor properties of myosin VIIA. In order to prepare mammalian myosin VIIA, we decided to express recombinant myosin VIIA rather than to purify it from tissues for several reasons. First, it is known that various types of myosins are present in the same tissue and it would be difficult to completely eliminate the contamination of other myosins. This problem can be overcome by overexpressing myosin VIIA in Sf9 cells and purifying with a histidine tag. Also, large quantities of the protein can be made and prepared in a short period of time. This is critical for preventing the denaturation and degradation of the protein during preparation.We produced a M7IQ5 construct that contains the entire head domain plus coiled-coil domain. It has been thought that myosin VIIA is a double-headed myosin because of the presence of the coiled-coil domain (12Chen Z.Y. Hasson T. Kelley P.M. Schwender B.J. Schwartz M.F. Ramakrishnan M. Kimberling W.J. Mooseker M.S. Corey D.P. Genomics. 1996; 36: 440-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, the length of the coiled-coil domain is relatively short, and there is no conclusive evidence for the two-headed structure of myosin VIIA. Our results clearly demonstrated that M7IQ5, having an entire coiled-coil domain of myosin VIIA, is single-headed. However, quite interestingly, the full-length myosin VIIA formed a two-headed structure. The result suggests that the relatively short coiled-coil domain of myosin VIIA is not sufficient to stabilize the two-headed structure, and the tail domains of myosin VIIA in the two heavy chains interact with each other, which contributes to form a stable two-headed structure of myosin VIIA.Myosin VIIA showed maximum actin-translocating velocity of 0.16 ± 0.02 μm/s at 25 °C. This value agrees with that of mouse myosin VIIA (0.19 μm/s) as recently reported by Udovichenko et al. (53Udovichenko I.P. Gibbs D. Williams D.S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 445-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, to our surprise, myosin VIIA requires an extremely high ATP concentration for its motility activity. Consistently, a high ATP concentration was needed for the saturation of the actin-activated ATPase activity of myosin VIIA and the ATP-induced dissociation of myosin VIIA from actin (Table I). These results suggest either an extremely slow ATP binding or a weak affinity of myosin VIIA for ATP. A very slow rate of ATP binding has been reported formyr1 (54Coluccio L.M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21575-21580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). On the other hand, ADP significantly inhibited the actin-activated ATPase activity of myosin VIIA. Consistently, the actin-translocating velocity of myosin VIIA was also inhibited by ADP. These results suggest the relatively strong binding of myosin VIIA to ADP. Of particular interest is the observation that ADP markedly reduced K actin, thus increasing the apparent affinity for actin during the ATPase cycle (Table I). Consistently, the addition of ADP markedly increased the binding of myosin VIIA to actin filaments in the presence of ATP. Even in the presence of 1 mm ATP, the addition of ADP enhanced the binding of myosin VIIA, with nearly 100% of myosin VIIA binding to actin filaments. These results suggest that a significant fraction of myosin VIIA during the ATPase cycle is in a strong binding state in the presence of ADP, presumably in a myosin VIIA/ADP form.If this is true, then it is plausible that myosin VIIA plays a role in connecting actin cytoskeleton and cellular components to maintain stress. Myosin VIIA is associated with cross-links between adjacent stereocilia (55Hasson T. Gillespie P.G. Garcia J.A. MacDonald R.B. Zhao Y. Yee A.G. Mooseker M.S. Corey D.P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1287-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), suggesting a role in maintaining their structural integrity. The present results are consistent with this earlier finding and provide a molecular basis for this notion.The weak affinity for actin in the presence of ATP suggests the low duty ratio of myosin VIIA. However, the tight binding of ADP usually suggests slow ADP dissociation. If so, the myosin would tend to give high duty ratio. In the presence of ADP, myosin movement is inhibited, but the inhibition required a relatively high ADP concentration. A likely scenario would be that the ADP affinity is not very high, but because ATP binding is weak, relatively low ADP concentration decreases the ATPase activity. In the presence of sufficiently high ADP concentration, myosin movement is inhibited by the presence of myosin-ADP complex. If this is the case, myosin VII may function to maintain tension in cells where a significant fraction binds ADP. Tension maintenance in cells has also been proposed for myr1 (54Coluccio L.M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21575-21580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).Directionality of myosin movement is another important issue to understand the physiological relevance of each myosin motor. The present results clearly indicate that myosin VIIA is a (+)-ended motor, unlike myosin VI. Quite recently, it was assumed thatDictyostelium myosin VII would be a plus end-directed motor, because it may function in the assembly and disassembly of adhesion proteins at the plasma membrane, and the actin at areas of membrane extension is arranged with the plus ends outermost (55Hasson T.

Whereas myosin VI and VIIA are present in the sensory hair cells in the inner ear and the mutation of these two classes of myosins causes auditory dysfunction, the present results strongly suggest that the function of these two types of myosins in the sensory hair cells must be distinct from each other. Myosins are mechanochemical proteins with a motor domain containing an ATP and actin-binding region, a neck domain that interacts with light chains or calmodulin, and a tail domain that serves to anchor and position the motor domain so that it can properly interact with actin filaments at a specific intracellular location.

Among them, the entire coding region has been determined for myosin VIIA.

In the retina, myosin VIIA is found in the pigmented epithelial cells and is postulated to play a role in phagocytosis of cell debris that accumulates as a result of sloughing off of photoreceptor outer segments. Of interest is that defects of myosin VIIA cause the mouseshaker-1 phenotype and human Usher syndrome 1B, which are characterized by deafness, lack of vestibular function, and (in humans) progressive retinal degeneration (5Gibson F.

In humans, two forms of dominant and recessive nonsyndromic deafness, DFNB2 and DFNA11, are also caused by myosin VIIA mutations (16Liu X.Z. Walsh J. Mburu P. Kendrick-Jones J. Cope M.J. Steel K.P.

Amino acid sequence analysis of myosin VIIA has indicated that this myosin has a motor domain containing actin-binding and ATP-binding sites, and five IQ motifs at the neck domain. In the tail domain, a very short predicted coiled-coil region was found; therefore, it has been assumed that myosin VIIA forms a two-headed structure. Two “band 4.1 protein, ezrin, radixin, moesin” (FERM) 1The abbreviations used are: FERM, band 4.1 protein, ezrin, radixin, moesin; M7full, full-length myosin VIIA; DTT, dithiothreitol; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid 1The abbreviations used are: FERM, band 4.1 protein, ezrin, radixin, moesin; M7full, full-length myosin VIIA; DTT, dithiothreitol; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid domains that have been implicated in cytoskeletal protein interactions have been found in the tail region. There are two myosin tail homology 4 domains found in the tail region. Although similar domains are found in myosin IV and XV, the function of this domain is unclear. The tail domain of unconventional myosins has been implicated to serve as the anchoring site for the cellular target proteins. For myosin VIIa, several tail binding proteins have been identified. The type I regulatory subunit of protein kinase A binds to the FERM domain at the C terminus of myosin VIIA (19Kussel-Andermann P. El-Amraoui A. Safieddine S. Hardelin J.P. Nouaille S. Camonis J. Petit C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29654-29659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), although the role of protein kinase A in the function and regulation of myosin VIIA is unknown. It was shown that the FERM domain is involved in anchoring with adherens junction via a cadherin-catenins complex (20Kussel-Andermann P. El-Amraoui A. Safieddine S. Nouaille S. Perfettini I. Lecuit M. Cossart P. Wolfrum U. Petit C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6020-6029Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Todorov et al. reported (21Todorov P.T. Hardisty R.E. Brown S.D. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) that the myosin VIIA tail has an affinity for microtubule-associated protein 2B, suggesting the interaction of myosin VIIA with the microtubule-based motility system. Quite recently, El-Amraoui et al. (22El-Amraoui A. Schonn J.S. Kussel-Andermann P. Blanchard S. Desnos C. Henry J.P. Wolfrum U. Darchen F. Petit C. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) reported that myosin VIIa binds to myosin VIIa- and Rab27-interacting protein, associates with melanosomes via Rab27A, and plays a role in melanosome trafficking. On the other hand, little is known about the motor function of myosin VIIa at a molecular level. Unlike the case for the well characterized conventional myosins, it becomes evident that the motor function among various members of the unconventional myosin subfamily varies uniquely from one to another, which is thought to be critical for specific physiological roles in diverse cellular motile processes. For example, recent studies have revealed that myosin V is a processive motor that can move in large steps approximating the 36-nm pseudorepeat of the actin filament (23Walker M.L. Burgess S.A.

Nature. 2002; 415: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These characteristics are quite important to understand the physiological function of myosin V, since the processive nature of myosin V with large step size is suitable for the motors involved in cargo movement in cells. Recently, myosin VI was also demonstrated to be a processive motor with a large step size (27Rock R.S. Rice S.E. Wells A.L. Purcell T.J. Spudich J.A. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). A unique feature of myosin VI is that it moves backward on the actin filament (29Wells A.L. Lin A.W. Chen L.Q. Safer D. Cain S.M. Hasson T. Carragher B.O. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). It was originally proposed that the myosin VI unique large insertion between the neck and converter domains is responsible for the reverse directionality of myosin VI (29Wells A.L. Lin A.W. Chen L.Q. Safer D. Cain S.M. Hasson T. Carragher B.O. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). This view was based upon the hypothesis that the orientation of the motor domain of myosin VI against actin filament is the same direction as other myosins but the attachment of the position of the “lever arm” (a long α-helical region following the motor domain) (30Block S.M. Cell. 1996; 87: 151-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) is different so that the same movement of the catalytic core would rotate the lever arm in the opposite direction on actin. Since the insertion is located between the converter domain (a compact subdomain thought to amplify the conformational change of the motor domain) (31Houdusse A. Kalabokis V.N. Himmel D.

If this is the case, myosin VII may function to maintain tension in cells where a significant fraction binds ADP. Tension maintenance in cells has also been proposed for myr1 (54Coluccio L.M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21575-21580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).Directionality of myosin movement is another important issue to understand the physiological relevance of each myosin motor. The present results clearly indicate that myosin VIIA is a (+)-ended motor, unlike myosin VI. Quite recently, it was assumed thatDictyostelium myosin VII would be a plus end-directed motor, because it may function in the assembly and disassembly of adhesion proteins at the plasma membrane, and the actin at areas of membrane extension is arranged with the plus ends outermost (55Hasson T.

Whereas myosin VI and VIIA are present in the sensory hair cells in the inner ear and the mutation of these two classes of myosins causes auditory dysfunction, the present results strongly suggest that the function of these two types of myosins in the sensory hair cells must be distinct from each other. A number of unconventional myosins have been found during the last decade, and it has been anticipated that these newly found myosins play a key role in diverse cellular motile processes. Whereas their unique C-terminal domain would be important for targeting each myosin to a specific cellular component, it is anticipated that the uniqueness of the motor properties of each myosin is also critical for its physiological function, in particular motile processes in cells. For myosin VIIA, where gene disruption is responsible for hereditary deafness and blindness (5Gibson F. Walsh J. Mburu P. Varela A. Brown K.A. Antonio M. Beisel K.W. Steel K.P. Brown S.D.

Brown S.D. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 268-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), little is known regarding its motor function at a molecular level. The present study has determined the motor properties of myosin VIIA. In order to prepare mammalian myosin VIIA, we decided to express recombinant myosin VIIA rather than to purify it from tissues for several reasons. First, it is known that various types of myosins are present in the same tissue and it would be difficult to completely eliminate the contamination of other myosins. This problem can be overcome by overexpressing myosin VIIA in Sf9 cells and purifying with a histidine tag. Also, large quantities of the protein can be made and prepared in a short period of time. This is critical for preventing the denaturation and degradation of the protein during preparation. We produced a M7IQ5 construct that contains the entire head domain plus coiled-coil domain. It has been thought that myosin VIIA is a double-headed myosin because of the presence of the coiled-coil domain (12Chen Z.Y. Hasson T. Kelley P.M. Schwender B.J. Schwartz M.F. Ramakrishnan M. Kimberling W.J. Mooseker M.S. Corey D.P. Genomics. 1996; 36: 440-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, the length of the coiled-coil domain is relatively short, and there is no conclusive evidence for the two-headed structure of myosin VIIA. Our results clearly demonstrated that M7IQ5, having an entire coiled-coil domain of myosin VIIA, is single-headed. However, quite interestingly, the full-length myosin VIIA formed a two-headed structure. The result suggests that the relatively short coiled-coil domain of myosin VIIA is not sufficient to stabilize the two-headed structure, and the tail domains of myosin VIIA in the two heavy chains interact with each other, which contributes to form a stable two-headed structure of myosin VIIA. Myosin VIIA showed maximum actin-translocating velocity of 0.16 ± 0.02 μm/s at 25 °C. This value agrees with that of mouse myosin VIIA (0.19 μm/s) as recently reported by Udovichenko et al. (53Udovichenko I.P. Gibbs D. Williams D.S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 445-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, to our surprise, myosin VIIA requires an extremely high ATP concentration for its motility activity. Consistently, a high ATP concentration was needed for the saturation of the actin-activated ATPase activity of myosin VIIA and the ATP-induced dissociation of myosin VIIA from actin (Table I). These results suggest either an extremely slow ATP binding or a weak affinity of myosin VIIA for ATP. A very slow rate of ATP binding has been reported formyr1 (54Coluccio L.M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21575-21580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). On the other hand, ADP significantly inhibited the actin-activated ATPase activity of myosin VIIA. Consistently, the actin-translocating velocity of myosin VIIA was also inhibited by ADP. These results suggest the relatively strong binding of myosin VIIA to ADP. Of particular interest is the observation that ADP markedly reduced K actin, thus increasing the apparent affinity for actin during the ATPase cycle (Table I). Consistently, the addition of ADP markedly increased the binding of myosin VIIA to actin filaments in the presence of ATP. Even in the presence of 1 mm ATP, the addition of ADP enhanced the binding of myosin VIIA, with nearly 100% of myosin VIIA binding to actin filaments. These results suggest that a significant fraction of myosin VIIA during the ATPase cycle is in a strong binding state in the presence of ADP, presumably in a myosin VIIA/ADP form. If this is true, then it is plausible that myosin VIIA plays a role in connecting actin cytoskeleton and cellular components to maintain stress. Myosin VIIA is associated with cross-links between adjacent stereocilia (55Hasson T. Gillespie P.G. Garcia J.A. MacDonald R.B. Zhao Y. Yee A.G. Mooseker M.S. Corey D.P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1287-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), suggesting a role in maintaining their structural integrity. The present results are consistent with this earlier finding and provide a molecular basis for this notion. The weak affinity for actin in the presence of ATP suggests the low duty ratio of myosin VIIA. However, the tight binding of ADP usually suggests slow ADP dissociation. If so, the myosin would tend to give high duty ratio. In the presence of ADP, myosin movement is inhibited, but the inhibition required a relatively high ADP concentration. A likely scenario would be that the ADP affinity is not very high, but because ATP binding is weak, relatively low ADP concentration decreases the ATPase activity. In the presence of sufficiently high ADP concentration, myosin movement is inhibited by the presence of myosin-ADP complex.

https://openalex.org/W1992240396,"Saporin-6 produced by the plant <i>Saponaria officinalis</i> belongs to the family of single chain ribosome-inactivating proteins. It potently inhibits protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells, by cleaving the <i>N</i>-glycosidic bond of a specific adenine in 28 S rRNA, which results in the cell death. Saporin-6 has also been shown to be active on DNA and induces apoptosis. In the current study, we have investigated the roles of rRNA depurination and the activity of saporin-6 on genomic DNA in its cytotoxic activity. The role of putative active site residues, Tyr<sup>72</sup>, Tyr<sup>120</sup>, Glu<sup>176</sup>, Arg<sup>179</sup>, and Trp<sup>208</sup>, and two invariant residues, Tyr<sup>16</sup> and Arg<sup>24</sup>, proposed to be important for structural stability of saporin-6, has been investigated in its catalytic and cytotoxic activity. These residues were mutated to alanine to generate seven mutants, Y16A, R24A, Y72A, Y120A, E176A, R179A, and W208A. We show that for the RNA <i>N</i>-glycosidase activity of saporin-6, residues Tyr<sup>16</sup>, Tyr<sup>72</sup>, and Arg<sup>179</sup> are absolutely critical; Tyr<sup>120</sup> and Glu<sup>176</sup> can be partially dispensed with, whereas Trp<sup>208</sup> and Arg<sup>24</sup> do not appear to be involved in this activity. The residues Tyr<sup>72</sup>, Tyr<sup>120</sup>, Glu<sup>176</sup>, Arg<sup>179</sup>, and Trp<sup>208</sup> were found to be essential for the genomic DNA fragmentation activity, whereas residues Tyr<sup>16</sup> and Arg<sup>24</sup> do not appear to be required for the DNA fragmentation. The study shows that saporin-6 possesses two catalytic activities, namely RNA<i>N</i>-glycosidase and genomic DNA fragmentation activity, and for its complete cytotoxic activity both activities are required."
https://openalex.org/W2067647143,"Expression of sodium-hydrogen exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3) in the intestinal and renal epithelium plays a critical role in sodium absorption and acid/base homeostasis. To decipher rat NHE3 gene regulation, its cis-acting regulatory elements and associated transcription factors were characterized by transient transfection of Caco-2, IEC-6, Qt6, and Drosophila SL2 cells. Deletion and mutational analyses demonstrated that the atypical TATA box located at bp -26/-31 was not necessary for promoter activity, and that a -20/+8-bp fragment represents a functional initiator. Within the 81-bp upstream region, three Sp transcription factor binding sites were critical because their mutation drastically reduced promoter activity. The roles of Sp1 and Sp3 were further demonstrated by electromobility shift assay and by transactivation of the NHE3 promoter in SL2 cells by forced expression of Sp1 and Sp3. Both of these transcription factors were found to act synergistically with GATA-5 bound to a GATA box in exon 1 (+20/+23 bp). These studies demonstrate that rat NHE3 promoter is initiator-driven and controlled mainly by Sp1 and Sp3, which functionally interact with GATA-5. This interaction represents a novel regulatory mechanism, which is likely to participate in a gradient of intestinal gene expression along the crypt-villus axis."
https://openalex.org/W1998713271,"DNA binding properties of the Type 1 DNA polymerases from Thermus aquaticus (Taq, Klentaq) and Escherichia coli (Klenow) have been examined as a function of [KCl] and [MgCl2]. Full-lengthTaq and its Klentaq “large fragment” behave similarly in all assays. The two different species of polymerases bind DNA with sub-micromolar affinities in very different salt concentration ranges. Consequently, at similar [KCl] the binding of Klenow is ∼ 3 kcal/mol (150×) tighter than that of Taq/Klentaq to the same DNA. Linkage analysis reveals a net release of 2–3 ions upon DNA binding of Taq/Klentaq and 4–5 ions upon binding of Klenow. DNA binding of Taq at a higher temperature (60 °C) slightly decreases the ion release. Linkage analysis of binding versus [MgCl2] reports the ultimate release of ∼1 Mg2+ ion upon complex formation. However, the MgCl2 dependence for Klenow, but not Klentaq, shows two distinct phases. In 10 mm EDTA, both polymerase species still bind DNA, but their binding affinity is significantly diminished, Klenow more than Klentaq. In summary, the two polymerase species, when binding to identical DNA, differ substantially in their sensitivity to the salt concentration range, bind with very different affinities when compared under similar conditions, release different numbers of ions upon binding, and differ in their interactions with divalent cations.

This study focuses primarily on the functional characteristics of this homologous mesophilic/thermophilic pair of polymerases in an effort to understand the functional similarities and differences between the two polymerases. Herein we focus on the initial functional step in DNA replication; that is, the binding of the polymerase to DNA and the dependence of DNA binding on salt. Taq polymerase is a single chain polypeptide with a molecular mass of 94 kDa (1Chien A. Edgar D.B. Trela J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 127: 1550-1557Google Scholar, 2Kaledin A.S. Sliusarenko A.G.

Due to its use in PCR, Taqpolymerase is one of the most important biotechnological reagents in use in the world today. The enzyme has both polymerase activity and 5′ nuclease activity and is a member of the Pol I polymerase family by virtue of its similarity to E. coli Pol I DNA polymerase (1Chien A. Edgar D.B. Trela J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 127: 1550-1557Google Scholar, 2Kaledin A.S. Sliusarenko A.G. Gorodetskii S.I. Biokhimiya. 1980; 45: 644-651Google Scholar, 3Lawyer F.C. Stoffel S. Saiki R.K. Myambo K.

Protein Chem. 1996; 48: 377-435Google Scholar), but unlike E. coli Pol I, Taq polymerase lacks 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity (so called “proofreading activity”) (1Chien A. Edgar D.B. Trela J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 127: 1550-1557Google Scholar, 2Kaledin A.S. Sliusarenko A.G. Gorodetskii S.I. Biokhimiya. 1980; 45: 644-651Google Scholar, 3Lawyer F.C. Stoffel S. Saiki R.K. Myambo K. Drummond R.

Overgaard-Hansen K. FEBS Lett. 1970; 6: 25-27Google Scholar). Removal of the same domain from Taq polymerase produces the 62.5-kDa Klentaq fragment (8Barnes W.M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 112: 29-35Google Scholar). The non-covalent driving forces that lead to stable protein-DNA complexes are strongly influenced by the solution environment (salt concentration and type, temperature, pH, etc.). As a result of this dependence on the solution conditions it is impossible to understand the forces that drive these interactions based solely on structural considerations. Rather, the functional properties (thermodynamics and kinetics) of these interactions must also be investigated as a function of solution conditions to understand the origins of the stability of the complexes. Models and mechanistic explanations of function in the Pol I polymerase family are often extrapolated from one family member to another. These extrapolations are well justified given the structural similarities among the family members as revealed by the extensive series of recent co-crystal structures of different family members (for review, see Refs. 9Patel P.H. Suzuki M. Adman E. Shinkai A. Loeb L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 823-837Google Scholar and 10Patel P.H. Loeb L.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 656-659Google Scholar) as well as sequence similarities among the active sites (9Patel P.H. Suzuki M. Adman E. Shinkai A. Loeb L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 823-837Google Scholar). Assays of function and mutagenesis studies, however, often reveal subtle and not so subtle differences among the family members (e.g. Refs. 11Cowart M. Gibson K.J. Allen D.J. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1975-1983Google Scholar and 12Morales J.C. Kool E.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12979-12988Google Scholar), but directly comparative functional studies between different family members are relatively scarce. In this study, we have characterized the basic binding equilibria of full-length Taq, Klentaq, and Klenow polymerases to DNA using a fluorescence anisotropy assay. We have further characterized the KCl and MgCl2dependencies of DNA binding by the different polymerases and have quantitated the linked ion releases upon DNA binding for all three polymerases. The results show that these two species of polymerase, when binding to the same DNA, differ in their salt “sensitivities,” their intrinsic affinities, their linked ion releases, and their need for bound divalent cations. The proteins examined are full-lengthTaq DNA polymerase, the Klentaq fragment of Taqpolymerase (8Barnes W.M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 112: 29-35Google Scholar), and the D424A mutant of Klenow polymerase (13Derbyshire V. Freemont P.S. Sanderson M.R. Beese L. Friedman J.M. Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Science. 1988; 240: 199-201Google Scholar). The Klenow D424A mutant lacks 3′-exonuclease activity and is commonly referred to as “Klenow exo minus” (KF exo−). It is the predominant variant of Klenow polymerase used in the majority of functional studies of Klenow over the past decade. The Taq DNA polymerase gene was cloned, and the protein was expressed and purified in our laboratory. The clone of Klentaq was constructed by Wayne Barnes at Washington University (8Barnes W.M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 112: 29-35Google Scholar) and was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The clone for D424A Klenow fragment was a gift from Catherine Joyce at Yale University. The gene for Taq DNA polymerase was PCR-amplified using the strategy and primers described by Engelke (14Engelke D.R. Krikos A. Bruck M.E. Ginsburg D. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 191: 396-400Google Scholar). The amplified product was cloned into a pTrc99A expression plasmid (Amersham Biosciences) using EcoR1 and BamH1 restriction sites. The gene was then cut from this clone using NcoI and SalI restriction sites, re-ligated into a pET-15b expression plasmid (Novagen), and transformed into the BL21(DE3) strain of E. coli for expression and purification of the protein. The correctTaq coding sequence of the resulting plasmid (pKDTaq3) was verified by DNA sequencing. The protein purification procedure forTaq was based largely on the procedure described by Barnes (15.Barnes, W. M. (1995) (July 25, 1995) U. S. Patent 5,436,149.Google Scholar) for Klentaq with a number of modifications, as follows. Cell pellets were solubilized in the lysis buffer (50 mmTris-Cl, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mmdextrose, 250 mm KCl, pH 7.9) with lysozyme and heated to 75 °C for 1 h. Contaminating nucleic acids were then removed by polyethyleneimine precipitation in the presence of 250 mmKCl. The supernatant containing the protein was loaded over a Bio-Rex 70 ion-exchange column, pre-equilibrated with KTA buffer (20 mm Tris, 22 mm(NH4)2SO4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, pH 7.9) to remove the excess polyethyleneimine. The flow-through was then loaded over a heparin-Sepharose column in the same buffer, and Taqpolymerase was eluted with a 22–270 mm(NH4)2SO4 gradient. TheTaq eluent was applied to a second Bio-Rex 70 column in KTA buffer, pH 8.8, and the flow-through contained the purified protein. Klentaq polymerase was purified as published (15.Barnes, W. M. (1995) (July 25, 1995) U. S. Patent 5,436,149.Google Scholar) with the following modifications; no surfactant was used during purification, the ammonium sulfate precipitation step was omitted, and a second Bio-Rex 70 column, at pH 9.1, was added subsequent to the heparin column. The flow-through of the second Bio-Rex column contained the purified protein. Klenow exo minus (plasmid pXS106) was transformed into E. coliexpression strain CJ376 and grown and induced as described previously (16Joyce C.M. Derbyshire V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 3-13Google Scholar). The protein was purified as previously described for full-length Pol I (17Minkley Jr., E.G. Leney A.T. Bodner J.B. Panicker M.M. Brown W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10386-10392Google Scholar) with omission of the DEAE-cellulose column. No surfactant was used during purification or storage of any of the polymerases. Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford method (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Stoichiometric and equilibrium DNA binding experiments were performed with the following primer-template sets: 13/20-mer, 5′-TCGCAGCCGTCCA-3′ and 3′-AGCGTCGGCAGGTTCCCAAA-5′, and 63/70-mer, 5′-TACGCAGCGTACATGCTCGTGACTGGGATAACCGTGCCGTTTGCCGACTTTCGCAGCCGTCCA-3′ and 3′-ATGCGT- CGCATGTACGAGCACTGACCCTATTGGCACGGCAAACGGCTGAA- AGCGTCGGCAGGTTCCCAAA-5′. The 13/20-mer primer template set used is the same as that used for kinetic studies of Klenow DNA binding by Benkovic and co-workers (19Kuchta R.D. Mizrahi V. Benkovic P.A. Johnson K.A. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8410-8417Google Scholar). The longer primer-template pair (63/70-mer) was designed for use at higher temperatures. The 63/70-mer uses the same putative binding region sequence as the 13/20-mer, with added “random” sequence selected from the same region of the M13 bacteriophage sequence. DNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. Fluorescently labeled DNA was labeled at the 5′ end of the primer strand with rhodamine-X (ROX) and was purchased directly from Integrated DNA Technologies. ROX-labeled DNA was titrated with increasing concentrations of protein, and binding was monitored using the anisotropy signal change as protein-DNA complex is formed (20Heyduk T. Lee J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1744-1748Google Scholar, 21Heyduk T. Ma Y. Tang H. Ebright R.H. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 492-503Google Scholar). Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were performed using a FluoroMax-2 fluorometer equipped with an automated polarizer and regulated at the indicated temperatures. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 583 and 605 nm respectively, with 8-nm band-pass and an integration time of 10 s. For all the equilibrium titrations the DNA concentration used was 1 nm. In all the experiments the protein was titrated into fluorescently labeled DNA, with the total [DNA] < K d. After each addition the sample was equilibrated at the required temperature for 8 min, and anisotropy was measured. All titrations were performed in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.9, buffer at the indicated salt (KCl and MgCl2) concentrations and temperature. The pH was adjusted by mixing Tris base and Tris-HCl. KCl and MgCl2 concentrations were varied across the widest possible range for each polymerase. Limiting titrations at low KCl concentrations were those where theK d approached the total [DNA]. Limiting values at high KCl concentrations were the point where well behaved, reproducible isotherms could no longer be obtained. For assays examining the effects of EDTA on binding, the titrations were carried out in 10 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.9, with KCl concentrations of 50 mm for Klentaq and 300 mmfor Klenow. Before measurement of the binding in the presence of EDTA the proteins were extensively dialyzed against this same buffer. Stoichiometric binding curves were fit to the equation, ΔA=ΔAT/2DT{(ET+DT+Kd)−[(ET+DT+Kd)2−4ETDT]1/2}(Eq. 1) where ΔA is the change in anisotropy, ΔA T is the total anisotropy change,E T is the total polymerase concentration at each point in the titration, D T is the total DNA concentration, and K d is the dissociation constant (20Heyduk T. Lee J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1744-1748Google Scholar, 22Inglese J. Blatchly R.A. Benkovic S.J. J. Med. Chem. 1989; 32: 937-940Google Scholar). When used to analyze stoichiometric binding curves, bothD T and K d are allowed to vary during the non-linear regression, and the binding stoichiometry was determined as the ratio of the fitted D T and the known D T. Equilibrium binding curves were fit both to the equation above and to a simplified standard single site isotherm usable when the [DNA] ≪K d, and which thus assumes effective equality between the free polymerase concentration and the total polymerase concentration, ΔA={ΔAT(ET/Kd)/(1+ET/Kd)}(Eq. 2) where ΔA is the change in fluorescence anisotropy, ΔA T is the total change in anisotropy,E T is the total polymerase concentration at each point in the titration, and K d is the dissociation constant for polymerase-DNA binding. Both equations have strengths and weaknesses for fitting equilibrium binding data. The fittedK d in Equation 1 is quite sensitive to the exact fixed total DNA concentration and any uncertainty in the determination of this concentration, whereas in Equation 2 the actual difference between the total and free polymerase concentrations propagates directly into the fitted K d. Fits to the titrations with the very tightest (lowest) K d values in each salt series in this study gave ≤10% variation in the fittedK d values using Equations 1 and 2. All other titrations in all salt series gave, within error, identical fittedK d values with both equations. Values and errors reported in the tables are those returned from fits to Equation 1. All non-linear fitting was performed using the program KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software). Linked ion release upon binding of the polymerases to DNA was calculated using a basic linkage relationship (23Wyman J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1964; 19: 223-286Google Scholar, 24Record M.T. Zhang W.

For routine use in PCR, full purification of the polymerase is not required, and the majority of the published or patented descriptions ofTaq purification are aimed at producing Taq for use in PCR. Our procedures have been designed for producingTaq for use in biochemical and biophysical studies. As such, no additional tagged sequences (such as His tags) have been added to the polymerase. Also, no surfactants have been used in the purification, since their effects on the polymerase remain uncharacterized. In addition, we assayed for potential damaging effects of the ubiquitous 70 °C heat incubation step included in published and patented Taq purification procedures. Full purification of the polymerase without the heat step was performed; however, this “cold prep” polymerase behaved identically in all of our assays as the normal “heat-prepared” polymerase (data not shown), and so the heat incubation step was retained in the final purification protocol. Stoichiometric titrations of each of the polymerases versus DNA were performed using fluorescence anisotropy, and the results are shown in Fig. 2 for Taq polymerase. Polymerases were titrated into ROX-labeled DNA at high concentrations of DNA ([DNA] ≫ K d). The anisotropy of the DNA increases as protein binds due to the decreasing rate of molecular rotation of the DNA in the complex. The stoichiometry of binding was determined by fitting the data to Equation 1 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The ratio of bound protein to DNA at saturation is 0.97 for Taq, 1.04 for Klentaq, and 0.82–0.95 for Klenow binding to the 13/20-mer primer-template pair. The binding stoichiometry to the longer 63/70-mer primer-template pair was 1.1 forTaq and 1.15 for Klentaq. As a control, it was determined whether unlabeled DNA could effectively compete with fluorescently labeled DNA for binding to the polymerase. The second curve in the stoichiometric titration plots of Fig. 2 shows a stoichiometric titration of protein versus double the amount of DNA, where half the DNA is ROX-labeled, and half is not. Only the fluorescently labeled DNA is anisotropically visible, so the displacement and apparent doubling of the stoichiometric value for this second curve indicates approximately equally effective binding of both the labeled and unlabeled DNA to the polymerases. Unlabeled DNA effectively competed with ROX-labeled DNA binding to all three polymerases. It should be noted that DNA labeled with fluorescein, which was examined first, is not effectively competed by unlabeled DNA for binding (data not shown), underscoring the importance of the unlabeled competitive control. Fig.3 shows representative fluorescence anisotropic titrations of the binding of Klenow and Klentaq polymerases to identical pieces of DNA at several different KCl concentrations at 25 °C. Each titration curve fits well to a single site binding isotherm, and it can be seen from the precision of the data that even modest shifts in K d can be readily quantitated. Fig.4 shows the thermodynamic linkage plots for DNA binding as a function of KCl concentration (∂ln1/K d versus ∂ln[salt]) for the polymerases in the presence and absence of 5 mmMgCl2. The negative slopes of the linkage plots are indicative of net ion release upon formation of the protein-DNA complex (23Wyman J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1964; 19: 223-286Google Scholar, 24Record M.T.

Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 400-424Google Scholar). As observed for most DNA-binding proteins, DNA binding is linked to ion release for all the polymerases. Full-lengthTaq polymerase and the Klentaq fragment behave essentially identically. The exact linked ion releases are reported in TableI.Figure 4KCl linkages (∂ln1/K d versus ∂ln[KCl]) for the binding of Klentaq and Klenow polymerases to 13/20-mer DNA at 25 °C.

Open table in a new tab All titrations were performed at 25 °C in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.9, with the listed concentrations of KCl. Titrations performed with MgCl2 contained 5 mm MgCl2. Several points are notable about these data. The most striking observation is the significant difference in salt ranges where sub-micromolar binding occurs. DNA binding across the ∼10–300 nm K d range occurs at KCl concentrations about an order of magnitude higher for Klenow than forTaq/Klentaq. This means that under similar solution conditions the binding of Klenow to DNA is much tighter than that ofTaq/Klentaq. Both species of polymerase were titrated over the widest possible KCl concentration ranges that produced acceptable and analyzable titration curves. Although the two [KCl] ranges do not overlap, by extrapolation the binding of Klenow is, on average, about 3 kcal/mol (∼150×) tighter than the binding of Taq/Klentaq to the same DNA at similar salt concentrations. This difference is also reflected in the extrapolation of the linkage plots to 1 msalt (ln[KCl] = 0), which provides an estimate of the non-electrostatic components of the binding interaction (24Record M.T. Zhang W. Anderson C.F. Adv. Protein Chem. 1998; 51: 281-353Google Scholar, 25Record M.T. Ha J.-H. Fisher M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 291-343Google Scholar, 26Lohman T.M. Mascotti D.P. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 400-424Google Scholar). At 1m salt the binding free energy for Klenow to DNA is ∼2 kcal/mol tighter than the ΔG binding ofTaq/Klentaq to the same DNA (Table I). In addition to the intrinsic affinity difference between theE. coli and Taq polymerases, the slopes of the linkage plots with KCl indicate that the binding of Klenow to DNA results in the release of 1.5 more ions than the binding ofTaq/Klentaq to the same DNA both in the presence and absence of MgCl2. This is an ∼50% increase in the linked ion release for Klenow relative to Taq/Klentaq. For both polymerases, removal of MgCl2 from the buffer increases the reported linked ion release by about 0.6 ions, indicating that part of the ion release in the presence of MgCl2 is due to magnesium ion release. Binding titrations were also performed as a function of MgCl2 at fixed KCl concentrations for Klentaq and Klenow polymerases. Fig.5 shows the individual titration curves at different MgCl2 concentrations for the two polymerases as well as the thermodynamic linkage plots for bindingversus [MgCl2]. It is clear that binding of Klentaq is linked to the release of Mg2+ across the entire [MgCl2] range, but the [MgCl2] dependence of Klenow DNA binding is not monotonic. The MgCl2 linkage plot for Klentaq (Fig. 5 C) indicates a linked Mg2+ release of 0.9 ions. For Klenow, on the other hand, the MgCl2 linkage plot and inspection of the titration curves themselves (Fig. 5 B) both show the absence of a linked Mg2+ release (rather, a small uptake) upon binding of Klenow to DNA up until 10 mm MgCl2, whereas above 10 mm MgCl2 there is a net release of 1.2 Mg2+ upon binding (TableII).Table IIMgCl2 dependence of DNA binding for Klentaq and Klenow polymerases[MgCl2]KlentaqK dIons releasedaValues determined from the slope of the ∂ln1/K d versus ∂ln[MgCl2] linkage.[MgCl2]KlenowK dIons releasedaValues determined from the slope of the ∂ln1/K d versus ∂ln[MgCl2] linkage.mmnmmmnm05.7 ± 0.3012.8 ± 0.529.2 ± 0.3210.5 ± 0.5311.2 ± 0.30.9 ± 0.158.5 ± 0.3517.6 ± 0.5108.1 ± 0.3bValues used to calculate linked ion release for Klenow.723.5 ± 0.51511.6 ± 0.2bValues used to calculate linked ion release for Klenow.1.2 ± 0.141038.7 ± 22011.7 ± 0.5bValues used to calculate linked ion release for Klenow.3021.3 ± 0.7bValues used to calculate linked ion release for Klenow.4037.4 ± 0.8bValues used to calculate linked ion release for Klenow.5052.4 ± 2bValues used to calculate linked ion release for Klenow.Titrations were performed at 25 °C in either 10 mm Tris, 50 mm KCl, pH 7.9 (Klentaq), or 10 mm Tris, 300 mm KCl, pH 7.9 (Klenow).a Values determined from the slope of the ∂ln1/K d versus ∂ln[MgCl2] linkage.b Values used to calculate linked ion release for Klenow.

https://openalex.org/W2087220115,"Estrogen receptor α (ERα) mediates the effects of estrogen by altering gene expression following hormone binding. It has recently been shown that kinase-mediated phosphorylation of ERα also transcriptionally activates the receptor in the absence of estrogen. We now report that ERα-dependent gene expression also is regulated by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). ERα co-immunoprecipitates with enzymatically active PP2A. ERα binds directly to the catalytic subunit of PP2A, which dephosphorylates serine 118 of the receptor. Amino acids 176–182 in the A/B domain of ERα are required for the interaction between PP2A and the receptor. Phosphatase inhibition disrupts the ERα-PP2A complex and induces formation of an ERα-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase complex, phosphorylation of ERα on serine 118, and transcriptional activation. These findings demonstrate that estrogen receptors exist in complexes with phosphatases as well as kinases. We propose a new model of ligand-independent activation of estrogen receptors in which the level of phosphorylation of ERα, and hence its transcriptional activation, is determined by the net effect of these counterregulatory pathways.

Although the mechanisms that mediate hormone-independent activation of the ER are incompletely understood, the most completely studied pathway to date involves direct phosphorylation of ERα on serine 118 in the N-terminal transcriptional activation (A/B) domain by MAP kinase (13Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P. Science. 1995; 270: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar). Ligand-independent activation of the ER links mitogenic stimulation of cells by growth factors with estrogen receptor-dependent regulation of gene expression, which may support a role for estrogen receptors in regulating cellular function in situations when estrogen levels are low, such as in men and postmenopausal women. Given the importance of phosphatases in regulating the activity of kinases, we hypothesized that phosphatases may also regulate ER-dependent signaling. In the current study, ERα is shown to directly bind the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a heterotrimeric serine/threonine phosphatase known to regulate many important cell signaling pathways. We also demonstrate that PP2A regulates the transcriptional activation of ERα by counteracting MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation of the receptor. These findings thus support a new model for the regulation of ligand-independent transcriptional activation of ERα. Unless stated otherwise, all reagents were obtained from Sigma.

The washed immunopellets were then used for immunoblotting, phosphatase assays, or kinase assays as described below. In a subset of experiments a second immunoprecipitation was performed by re-suspending the beads in 0.1 ml of resolubilization buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5% SDS), boiling for 5 min, adding 1 ml of lysis buffer, and re-immunoprecipitating with anti-ERα antibody or nonimmune mouse IgG as described above. Phosphatase assays were performed essentially as described (19Surks H.K. Mochizuki N. Kasai Y. Georgescu S.P. Tang K.M. Ito M. Lincoln T.M. Mendelsohn M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Briefly, 32P-labeled myelin basic protein substrate was produced by phosphorylation with protein kinase A catalytic subunit (New England Biolabs). Radiolabeled ER substrate was produced by the kinase reaction described below. In samples where okadaic acid was included, the samples were preincubated with okadaic acid for 30 min before addition of substrate. 10 μl of32P-myelin basic protein (0.3 mg/ml) was added and the reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 30 min. Proteins were precipitated in 10% trichloroacetic acid and the supernatant was then analyzed by scintillation counting. The activity contained in the nonimmune pellets was subtracted from all other counts. The results of the phosphatase assay are expressed as a percent of the total counts determined for the labeled substrate alone. Each determination was performed in duplicate and each experiment was independently performed three times or more. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and then probed with the appropriate primary antibody. Antibodies used include anti-ERα antibody (Ab7 at 1:200; Neo Markers), anti-PP2A antibody (1:4000; Transduction Laboratories, Beverly, MA), anti-PP1antibody (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), an antibody specific for ERα phosphorylated on serine 118 (1:2000 dilution; kind gift of Dr. Simak Ali (20Ali S. Lutz Y. Bellocq J.-P. Chenard-Neu M.-P. Rouyer N. Metzger D. Hybridoma. 1993; 12: 391-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar)), a rabbit polyclonal anti-MAP kinase antibody (at 1:1000; Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), a rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-MAP kinase antibody (at 1:1000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology), or an anti-endothelial cell nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) antibody (1:1000 dilution; Translab). The membranes were then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody and developed with ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Quiescent cells were transfected with ER expression plasmids, and/or the ERE-Luc reporter plasmid by electroporation as previously described (9Karas R.H. Gauer E.A. Bieber H.E. Baur W.E. Mendelsohn M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2851-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 18Karas R.H. Patterson B.L. Mendelsohn M.E. Circulation. 1994; 89: 1943-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Cells were infected with adeno-GFP-ERα, or the control virus adeno-GFP at a multiplicity of infection of 100. Luciferase reporter assays were performed as previously described (9Karas R.H. Gauer E.A. Bieber H.E. Baur W.E. Mendelsohn M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2851-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 18Karas R.H. Patterson B.L. Mendelsohn M.E. Circulation. 1994; 89: 1943-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). For the reporter assays, cells were co-transfected with a β-galactosidase expression plasmid and all results are reported corrected for the activity of this plasmid. Each treatment was carried out in triplicate, and each experiment was performed a minimum of three different times. GST pull-down experiments were performed essentially as described (19Surks H.K. Mochizuki N. Kasai Y. Georgescu S.P. Tang K.M. Ito M. Lincoln T.M. Mendelsohn M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Briefly, GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli XL10-Gold (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Expression was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Cell lysates were incubated with 50 μl of the GST fusion protein beads, rocked at 4 °C overnight, washed 3 times, and then boiled in SDS sample buffer. Associated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as described above. In a subset of experiments recombinant human ERα (rERα; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) was diluted 1:100, and 10 μl of the diluted rERα was incubated with GST fusion proteins as described above. In vitro labeling using ERα immunopellets, or nonimmune controls, from Rad91 cells were washed and then suspended in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium). 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP was added and the solutions were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding SDS sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. In vivo labeling using quiescent cells were cultured in phosphate- and serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.5 mCi of 32P (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 10-cm dishes. Cells were then treated with vehicle, 17β-estradiol (E2; 10 nm), or okadaic acid (OA; 1 μm) for 2 h. In a subset of experiments, the cells were also preincubated with the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 for 30 min (50 μm; New England Biolabs). The cells were then rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed, and ERα was immunoprecipitated as described above. In a subset of experiments, recombinant ERα or GST-ER fusion proteins were used as a substrate for the kinase reaction using 10 ng of recombinant MAP kinase (Upstate Biotechnology). In vitrolabeled ER was also used as a substrate for phosphatase reactions using PP2A immunopellets or purified PP2A complexes (Upstate Biotechnology). After either in vitro or in vivo labeling, the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and exposed to a PhosphorImager overnight. The membranes were then subsequently immunoblotted as described above. All experiments shown were performed a minimum of three independent times. Where quantitative comparisons were made, groups were compared using the Student's t test, and a p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. As a first step to investigate the possible role of phosphatases in regulating estrogen receptor function, in vivo 32P labeling experiments were conducted in Rad91 cells infected with adeno-GFP-ER and cultured in the absence or presence of the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid. Okadaic acid treatment resulted in a substantial increase in phosphorylation of the ER (Fig. 1 A). As expected, incubation of the cells with estrogen also induced an increase in ER phosphorylation (Fig. 1 A). The effect of okadaic acid on ERα phosphorylation was also examinedin vitro. In vitro kinase reactions were performed on ERα immunopellets obtained from lysates of Rad91 cells infected with adeno-GFP-ER. Okadaic acid pretreatment also enhanced phosphorylation of ERα in these experiments (Fig. 1 B). Additional studies using Rad91 cells transfected with ERα containing a different epitope tag confirmed the identity of this phosphoband as ERα (data not shown). To identify the site(s) on ERα that are phosphorylated following exposure to okadaic acid, wild-type and mutant ERαs were expressed and then immunoprecipitated from Rad91 cells treated with vehicle or okadaic acid and subjected to the in vitro kinase reaction. In contrast to the wild-type ER, ERα containing a serine to alanine mutation at position 118 (ER-S118A) was only minimally phosphorylated in the presence of okadaic acid (Fig. 1 C). These data demonstrate that okadaic acid-mediated phosphatase inhibition results in enhanced phosphorylation of ERα on serine 118. To determine whether ERα immunopellets contain active phosphatases, we immunoprecipitated ERα from EAhy926 cells and BAEC and tested for phosphatase activity. As shown in Fig. 2 A, phosphatase assays using ER immunopellets derived from BAEC released 31.5 ± 16.0% of total counts (p < 0.01 versus nonimmune) and ERα immunopellets from Eahy926 cells released 35.2 ± 13% of total counts (p < 0.01 versusnonimmune). Phosphatase activity also was detected in ERα immunopellets derived from Rad91 cells infected with adeno-GFP-ER (40.5 ± 3.7% of the total counts; Fig. 2 A;p < 0.001; n = five independent experiments). Phosphatase activity of nonimmune pellets was minimal (1.4 ± 0.3% of total counts; Fig. 2 A), as was that in immunopellets from Rad91 cells not infected with ERα (data not shown). The phosphatase activity recovered with ERα immunoprecipitated from Rad91 was inhibited by co-incubation with 10 nm okadaic acid (40.5 ± 4.2%; Fig. 2 A). 1 μm okadaic acid inhibited 76.1 ± 4.3% of the phosphatase activity in the Rad91 ER immunopellet (Fig. 2 A). 10 nm okadaic acid inhibited the phosphatase activity associated with PP2A immunopellets by 99.0 ± 0.2% but that of immunoprecipitated PP1 by <10% (data not shown), consistent with previous reports demonstrating relative specificity for inhibition of PP2A at low concentrations of okadaic acid (21Favre B. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). These data support that the phosphatase activity detected in the ER immunopellet is most likely attributable to the presence of members of the PPP family of phosphatases (22Millward T.A. Zolnierowicz S. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 186-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), which is predominantly comprised of (23Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 24Cohen P.T.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) PP1, PP2A, and PP2B (22Millward T.A. Zolnierowicz S. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 186-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 24Cohen P.T.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The partial inhibition of the ER-associated phosphatase activity observed with low dose okadaic acid is consistent with PP2A being a member of the complex (21Favre B. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The additional inhibition observed at 1 μm okadaic acid supports that PP1 also may be in the complex (21Favre B. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting studies confirmed that both PP2A and PP1 were present in ER immunopellets derived from BAEC (Fig. 2 B). PP2A and PP1 also were both detected in ER immunopellets derived from Rad91 cells infected with adeno-GFP-ER, but not those infected with only the backbone adenoviral vector (Fig. 2 B). PP2B and PP5, a phosphatase previously reported to complex with glucocorticoid receptors (26Zuo Z. Urban G. Scammell J.G. Dean N.M. McLean T.K. Aragon I. Honkanen R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8849-8857Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), were absent or only barely detectable, respectively, in these immunopellets (data not shown). Ligand-independent activation of the ER is known to occur by both MAP and Akt kinases (reviewed in Ref. 24Cohen P.T.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), and these enzymes are in turn known to be regulated by PP2A. Therefore, we sought to characterize further the interaction between ERα and PP2A. To determine whether ERα is a substrate for PP2A, ER immunoprecipitated from Rad91 cells was radiolabeled in vitro and used as substrate in phosphatase assays. Addition of PP2A immunoprecipitated from Rad91 cells significantly reduced the degree of ERα phosphorylation in mixing experiments (p < 0.05; data not shown). Incubation of radiolabeled ER with highly purified PP2A reduced the degree of ER phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner, and this was blocked completely by co-incubation with okadaic acid (Fig. 2 C). Cell lysates from Rad91 cells infected with adeno-GFP-ER were incubated with GST-PP2A fusion proteins to localize which domain(s) of ERα and PP2A mediate their binding. ERα bound to the catalytic (C)-subunit of PP2A, but not the A-subunit of the phosphatase (Fig. 3). Incubation of the catalytic subunit of PP2A with recombinant ERα gave similar results (Fig. 3), confirming that the catalytic subunit of PP2A binds directly to ERα. To localize the ERα domain that interacts with PP2A C subunit, GST pull-down experiments were performed with lysates of COS 1 cells transiently transfected with cDNAs for specific domains of ERα (Fig. 4 A). The truncation mutant ER-(1–271) and the deletion mutant ER-(Δ1–176) both interacted with GST-PP2A C-subunit, as did fragments ER-(176–271), ER-(Δ254–370), and ERα-(176–253), but not the control fragment ERα-(254–370) (Fig. 4 B). None of these ERα fragments were pulled down in parallel experiments using GST-PP2A A-subunit (data not shown). Complementary experiments using GST fusion proteins containing ERα fragments confirmed amino acids 176–253 of ERα as the domain mediating binding to PP2A (Fig. 4 C). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments in Rad91 cells transfected with ERα fragment 176–253 supported that this interaction also occurs in vivo (Fig. 4 D).Figure 4Definition of the PP2A binding domain of ERα. A, schematic representation of ERα fragments used in GST pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation experiments. B, GST-PP2A-C was incubated with cell lysates from COS 1 cells, untransfected (Ctrl), or transfected with ERα fragments shown in panel A. Immunoblotting for ERα fragments localized the interacting domain to amino acids 176–253 of the ER.C, GST fusion proteins containing full-length ERα (WT) or PCR-derived ERα fragments were incubated with lysates of Rad91 cells. Immunoblotting for PP2A confirmed the interaction between the ERα fragment containing amino acids 176–253 and PP2A. D, ERα was immunoprecipitated from Rad91 cells transfected with ERα-(176–253). Immunoblotting revealed PP2A in the ERα fragment immunopellet, but not in the nonimmune pellet.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Although many PP2A-interacting proteins have been identified, few have been shown definitively to directly bind with the catalytic subunit of PP2A (27Inui S. Sanjo H. Maeda K. Yamamoto H. Miyamoto E. Sakaguchi N. Blood. 1998; 92: 539-546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Muarata K. Wu J. Brautigan D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10624-10629Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison of the PP2A binding region of one such protein, the α4 protein (amino acids 94–202), and full-length ERα identified an 8-amino acid sequence within ERα, beginning with amino acid 175, that contains 6 amino acids that are identical or similar to the α4 sequence (Fig. 5). Additional GST-PP2A-C subunit pull-down experiments demonstrated that ERα fragment 183–253 that lacks these amino acids no longer interacted with PP2A, identifying the sequence between amino acids 176 and 182 as critical for PP2A binding with ERα (Fig. 5). As shown above, in quiescent Rad91 cells infected with GFP-ERα, PP2A co-immunoprecipitated with the ER (Fig. 6 A, lane 1). Pretreatment of the cells in vivo with 1 μmokadaic acid for 2 h disrupted the interaction between these two proteins (Fig. 6 A, lane 2). Identical results were obtained by immunoprecipitating PP2A and immunoblotting for ERα (data not shown). Because okadaic acid treatment induces phosphorylation of ERα on serine 118 (cf. Fig. 1), and previous reports have identified this serine as the MAP kinase phosphorylation site in ERα, we hypothesized that ERα might also bind MAP kinase. Okadaic acid treatment, which markedly reduces the amount of PP2A recovered in ERα immunopellets, markedly increased the abundance of MAP kinase in ERα immunopellets (Fig. 6 A). Preincubation with PD98059, an inhibitor of MEK1-dependent activation of the MAP kinase, reversed the association of ER with phospho-MAP kinase induced by okadaic acid (Fig. 6 B). PD98059 also inhibited okadaic acid-induced hyperphosphorylation of the ER. Immunoblotting using an antibody that specifically detects ERα phosphorylated on serine 118 confirmed this as the site of phosphorylation of the ER under these conditions (Fig. 6 B). The okadaic acid-induced increase in the serine 118 phospho-form of the ER also was blocked by pretreatment with PD98059 (Fig. 6 B). The effect of PP2A on MAP kinase-mediated ER phosphorylation was examined next. In vitro kinase reactions were carried out with recombinant MAP kinase using either recombinant ERα or GST-ERα as substrate. Recombinant MAP kinase phosphorylated GST-ER, but not GST-ER-S118A (Fig. 6 C). Recombinant MAP kinase also phosphorylated recombinant ERα, and this was abolished by co-incubation with highly purified PP2A (Fig. 6 C). PP2A-mediated inhibition of MAP kinase-induced ER phosphorylation was blocked by okadaic acid (Fig. 6 C). To investigate the possible role of PP2A in regulating transcriptional activation of ERα, pulmonary vein endothelial cells were infected with adeno-GFP-ER and co-transfected with an estrogen response element-driven luciferase reporter plasmid. Exposure of quiescent cells to okadaic acid dose dependently activated the reporter plasmid (maximal activation = 3.7 ± 1.4-fold at 100 nm okadaic acid; Fig. 7 A; p < 0.05versus control; n = 4 independent experiments). Exposure of the cells to 10 nm17β-estradiol increased activity of the reporter plasmid 6.1 ± 1.6-fold, and this was further enhanced to 15.9 ± 6.3 to 18.3 ± 5.5-fold by okadaic acid (Fig. 7 A;p < 0.05 versus estradiol alone at both 50 and 100 nm okadaic acid; n = 4 independent experiments). In control experiments, okadaic acid had no effect on reporter plasmid activity in cells that were not infected with adeno-GFP-ER, and okadaic acid-induced activation of the reporter was blocked completely by co-incubation with the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182780 (data not shown). To determine whether okadaic acid-induced transcriptional activation of ERα alters the abundance of endogenously expressed proteins, we next examined the effect of okadaic acid on expression of eNOS, a protein previously shown to be regulated by estrogen in an ER-dependent manner (29Weiner C.P. Lizasoain I. Baylis S.A. Knowles R.G. Charles I.G. Moncada S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5212-5216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Okadaic acid increased eNOS protein abundance in untransfected Eahy926 cells (Fig. 7 B). Furthermore, the increase in eNOS protein abundance following okadaic acid exposure was blocked by co-incubation with ICI 182780 (Fig. 7 B). Estrogen receptors are transcription factors that regulate gene expression by both estrogen-dependent and estrogen-independent pathways (reviewed in Refs. 5Carson-Jurica M.A. Schrader W.T. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1990; 11: 201-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 6Greene G.L. Press M.F. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1986; 24: 1-7Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 7Bruno C. Picard D. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 10: 41-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Kinase-mediated ER phosphorylation contributes to transcriptional activation of the ER by both of these pathways. The data presented above demonstrate for the first time that ERα directly binds phosphatases that are important for regulating the degree of ER phosphorylation. ERα-associated phosphatase activity was partially inhibited by low dose okadaic acid, and more completely inhibited by high dose okadaic acid, suggesting that multiple phosphatases exist in this complex. Indeed, immunoprecipitation experiments identified both PP1 and PP2A as ERα-associated proteins. In the current series of studies we focused specifically on the interaction of ERα with PP2A because PP2A regulates signaling by kinases such as MAP kinase that are known to regulate ligand-independent transcriptional activation of the ER (13Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P. Science. 1995; 270: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar,30Ugi S. Takeshi I. Ricketts W. Olefsky M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2375-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). GST fusion protein pull-down experiments confirmed the direct interaction between PP2A and ERα and demonstrated further that this interaction occurs via the catalytic subunit of PP2A. This identifies ERα as one of only a small number of proteins known to interact directly with the catalytic subunit rather than a structural subunit of PP2A. The interacting domain of ERα was localized to amino acids 176–253, which contains an 8-amino acid sequence that shares a high degree of homology with a portion of the α4 protein, another protein known to bind the C-subunit of PP2A. Deletion of this sequence from the ERα fragment abolished binding with PP2A, supporting that this sequence mediates the direct interaction between these two proteins and suggesting further that this sequence (AMESAKET) may represent a previously unidentified binding motif for the catalytic subunit of PP2A. Because of the technical difficulties involved in attempting to overexpress PP2A (31Baharians Z. Schonthal A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19019-19024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 32Chung H.Y. Brautigan D.L. Cell. Signalling. 1999; 11: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we turned instead to inhibitor studies to explore the functional significance of the interaction between PP2A and ERα. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that okadaic acid, at concentrations that preferentially inhibit PP2A over PP1 (21Favre B. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 23Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), increased phosphorylation of the ER on serine 118 and resulted in transcriptional activation of the ER. Additional studies showed further that okadaic acid treatment disrupted the ER/PP2A interaction and induced an interaction between ERα and phospho-MAP kinase. Although ERα has previously been reported to be a substrate for MAP kinase, a physical interaction between these two proteins has not previously been demonstrated. These studies show that estrogen receptors exist in complexes with both kinases and phosphatases that exert opposing effects on the phosphorylation and transcriptional activation of the ER (cf. Fig. 4 D). The data presented above suggest that PP2A can regulate the degree of phosphorylation of the ER by two pathways: (i) indirectly by regulating activation of kinase cascades that in turn regulate transcriptional activation of the ER, and (ii) directly by dephosphorylating the ER. Based on this model, the overall degree of transcriptional activation of ERα is likely determined by the reciprocal formation of complexes between ERα and either PP2A or MAP kinase (Fig. 8). The current findings, demonstrating a specific interaction between PP2A and ERα extend previous reports of stable interactions between PP2A and other proteins. For example, PP2A has previously been shown to regulate Wnt- and β-catenin-dependent downstream transcriptional events via a specific interaction between the B56 regulatory subunit of PP2A and the adenomatous polyposis coli protein (33Li X. Yost H. Virshup D.M. Seeling J.M. EMBO. 2002; 20: 4122-4131Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 34Seeling J.M. Miller J.R. Gil R. Moon R.T. White R. Virshup D.M. Science. 2002; 283: 2089-2091Crossref Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Although the findings presented above clearly demonstrate that PP2A directly binds to ERα and regulates its degree of phosphorylation, they also leave open many unanswered questions. For example, despite using okadaic acid at concentrations that preferentially inhibit PP2A, the effects of okadaic acid clearly are not restricted to PP2A alone. Thus the specificity of the observed effects of okadaic acid for PP2A requires further investigation. Similarly, we have shown that ERα also complexes with PP1, but the importance of this interaction has not been explored. The observation that 1 μm okadaic acid did not fully inhibit the phosphatase activity contained in the ER immunopellet (cf. Fig. 1) suggests that additional phosphatases may also complex to the ER, and these have yet to be identified. Although we have identified MAP kinase as an ER-associated protein, previous reports have shown that Akt kinase also can transcriptionally activate the ER (25Campbell R.A. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Patel N.M. Constantinidou D. Ali S. Nakshatri H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9817-9824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar), making it likely that other kinases also can form complexes with ERα. It also remains to be seen whether PP2A and ERβ bind one another. In summary, the data presented above support that estrogen receptors can exist in complexes with both kinases and phosphatases that regulate its transcriptional activation. The importance of kinase-mediated phosphorylation of the ER in regulating its transcriptional activity has previously been recognized. The present findings extend these observations by demonstrating for the first time, a counterregulatory role for the phosphatase PP2A in determining the state of estrogen receptor phosphorylation and its transcriptional activation.

DP97 has RNA-dependent ATPase activity, and mapping studies localize the interacting regions of DP97 and nuclear receptors to the C-terminal region of DP97 and the hormone binding/activation function-2 region of estrogen receptors (ER), as well as several other nuclear receptors. Repression by DP97 maps to a small region (amino acids 589–631) that has homology to a repression domain in the corepressor protein NCoR2/SMRTe. This region of DP97 is necessary and sufficient for its intrinsic repression activity. The N-terminal helicase region of DP97 is, however, dispensable for its transcriptional repressor activity. The knockdown of endogenous cellular DP97 by antisense DP97 or RNA interference (siRNA for DP97) results in significant enhancement of the expression of estradiol-ER-stimulated genes and attenuation of the repression of genes inhibited by the estradiol-ER. This implies that endogenous DP97 normally dampens stimulation and intensifies repression of estradiol-ER-regulated genes. Our findings add to the growing evidence that RNA helicases can associate with nuclear receptors and function as coregulators to modulate receptor transcriptional activity.

These ligands, which are naturally occurring as well as synthetic, display a spectrum of activities ranging from full agonist to full antagonist that are reflective of changes in receptor conformation engendered by the ligand and the distinct coactivator/corepressor proteins recruited. These observations have led to the designation of some of these ligands as selective ER modulators (SERMs) (2Katzenellenbogen B.S. Katzenellenbogen J.A.

ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, such as BRG1/hBrm, and the TRAP-DRIP-ARC complex, which act sequentially or combinatorially, also enhance gene transcription by facilitating RNA polymerase II recruitment to promoters (4Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar).In contrast to the coactivators, far fewer corepressors are known. Most fully characterized are NCoR (nuclear receptor corepressor) and SMRT (silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor), which function as major negative regulators of several members of the nuclear receptor family, including thyroid and retinoic acid receptors. These corepressors exert much of their repressive activities through recruitment of histone deacetylases to promote a repressive chromatin state (6Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. J. Biol.

In the case of the ER, a few additional negative coregulator proteins have been identified; these are the repressor of estrogen receptor activity (REA) (14Montano M.M. Ekena K. Delage-Mourroux R.

Through this screen, we have isolated a novel DEAD box RNA helicase, DP97, a 97-kDa protein, that acts as a corepressor of the liganded ER, and also of other nuclear hormone receptor superfamily members. This protein is a member of DNA/RNA helicase superfamily 2, which includes the DEAD box and DEAH box proteins (18Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1997; 88: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 19Tanner N.K. Linder P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 251-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar) that have roles in ribosome biogenesis, mRNA splicing, and transcriptional regulation (20Linder P. Daugeron M.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 97-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 21Linder P. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).In this study, we have characterized this novel DEAD box protein and shown that it has several intriguing properties. DP97 has RNA-dependent ATPase activity, consistent with its being an RNA helicase. DP97 interacts in a ligand-dependent manner with ERs and with other nuclear receptors, and represses their transcriptional activity. The transcriptional repression by DP97 maps to a small region that shows significant homology to a repression domain in the well-characterized nuclear receptor corepressor, NCoR2/SMRTe.DISCUSSIONIn this work, we describe the identification of a novel DEAD box protein, DP97, that interacts in a hormone-dependent manner with the estrogen receptor and other nuclear receptors and has several interesting properties. DP97 has RNA-dependent ATPase activity, consistent with its being an RNA helicase; it interacts with and represses the activity of nuclear receptors; and it has a small region of sequence homology with NCoR2/SMRTe that is responsible for its transcription repression activity. Analysis of the repression activity of truncated forms of DP97 shows that the DEAD box helicase motifs are dispensable for DP97 repression activity, indicating that its RNA helicase and corepressor activities represent distinct, separable functions.Nuclear receptor corepressors, such as NCoR1 or NCoR2, typically have separable functional domains for nuclear receptor interaction and for transcriptional repression (50Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar, 51Ordentlich P. Downes M. Evans R.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2001; 254: 101-116PubMed Google Scholar). This is the case, as well, with DP97. Its repression activity maps to a small region (589–631), while a more C-terminal part of DP97-(664–865) is the region that interacts with the C-terminal portion of nuclear receptors encompassing the ligand binding/AF-2 regions. Although DP97 contains 3 NR boxes (LXXLL motifs) and a possible CoRNR box through which many coregulators interact with nuclear receptors, these receptor interaction motifs are in the N-terminal half of DP97, not in the C-terminal region that interacts with nuclear receptors, indicating that other sequences in DP97 are responsible for its receptor interaction. This is consistent with findings from peptide phage display and studies with other coregulators (14Montano M.M. Ekena K. Delage-Mourroux R. Chang W. Martini P. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Like DP97, several other transcriptional repressor proteins have small regions with active transcriptional repression activity. These include Nab-1, a direct acting corepressor of the NGFI-A family of zinc finger transcription factors (54Swirnoff A.H. Apel E.D. Svaren J. Sevetson B.R. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 512-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), Sim-2, a protein involved in midline development in mice (55Moffett P. Reece M. Pelletier J. Mol. Cell.

Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).It is of note that the repression region of DP97-(589–631) shows considerable homology with two regions in the well known corepressor, NCoR2/SMRTe, amino acids 498–534 and 813–839 (34Ordentlich P. Downes M. Xie W. Genin A. Spinner N.B. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2639-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 43Park E.J. Schroen D.J. Yang M. Li H. Li L.

The latter (813–839) is within the second repression domain (RD2) of NCoR2 (34Ordentlich P. Downes M. Xie W. Genin A. Spinner N.B. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2639-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), whereas the former (498–534) encompasses a polyglutamine and acidic/basic region (43Park E.J. Schroen D.J. Yang M. Li H. Li L. Chen J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3519-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) that is between SANT(SWI3,ADA2, NCoR, TFIIIB) domains A and B. Since this former region (498–534) has only been examined as a Gal4 fusion along with other repressive regions of NCoR2, such as the SANT domains and the region of high similarity between NCoR and NCoR2 (51Ordentlich P. Downes M. Evans R.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2001; 254: 101-116PubMed Google Scholar), it is not known whether NCoR2-(498–534) has intrinsic repression activity on its own. Nevertheless, our observations with DP97 expand the utilization of these motifs for nuclear receptor regulation beyond SMRT/NCoR to a new corepressor, DP97.The ligand requirements for interaction of SMRT and NCoR with nuclear receptors is quite different from that observed with DP97. SMRT and NCoR interact preferentially with type II nuclear receptors, including retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors, and interaction with these receptors is observed primarily in the absence of ligand, with ligand occupancy resulting in dissociation of SMRT or NCoR. These corepressor proteins have also been reported to interact with estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors, but only in the presence of antagonist ligands (4Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar, 13Wagner B.L. Norris J.D. Knotts T.A. Weigel N.L. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1369-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In contrast, DP97 interacts with nuclear receptors in the presence of agonist or antagonist ligand, and shows no interaction in the absence of ligand. Hence, SMRT/NCoR and DP97 may serve distinct transcriptional regulatory activities that differ in their hormonal requirements, providing potentially multiple combinatorial regulatory mechanisms (11Jepsen K. Hermanson O. Onami T.M. Gleiberman A.S. Lunyak V. McEvilly R.J. Kurokawa R. Kumar V. Liu F. Seto E. Hedrick S.M. Mandel G. Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 2000; 102: 753-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Indeed, there is already evidence that NCoR and SMRT preferentially regulate different receptors (36Hu X. Lazar M.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) and that they exhibit distinct promoter and cell-type specificity.With the exception of the small repression region (amino acids 589–631) of DP97, DP97 shows no structural resemblance to NCoR or SMRT or to three other proteins known to be negative coregulators for nuclear receptors (REA, MTA1, and RTA). Like DP97, REA preferentially interacts with antiestrogen-liganded ER but it also interacts with estrogen-occupied ER. However, in sharp contrast to DP97, REA is an ER-selective coregulator (14Montano M.M. Ekena K. Delage-Mourroux R. Chang W. Martini P. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6947-6952Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 15Delage-Mourroux R. Martini P.G. Choi I. Kraichely D.M. Hoeksema J. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 20: 6224-6232Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). RTA (16Norris J.D. Fan D. Sherk A. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and MTA1 (17Mazumdar A. Wang R.A. Mishra S.K. Adam L. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Mandal M. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) bind to ER as well as other nuclear hormone receptors, as does DP97, but RTA interacts through the N-terminal region of the receptors in a ligand-independent manner, whereas DP97 interaction with receptor, like that of RTA and MTA1, is via the hormone binding/activation function-2 domain and is ligand-regulated. MTA1 is identical to NuRD-70, a component of nucleosome remodeling complexes (17Mazumdar A. Wang R.A. Mishra S.K. Adam L. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Mandal M. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Of interest, RTA contains RNA recognition motifs that are required for its repressor function, indicating a role for RNA binding in regulation of nuclear receptor activity (16Norris J.D. Fan D. Sherk A. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For DP97, its repressor activity is physically and functionally separable from its DEAD box motif-containing region.DP97 Variants, Subcellular Localization, and Comparisons with other DEAD Box RNA Helicases and Coregulators Known to Modulate Nuclear Receptor Activity and RNA ProcessingDP97 may exist in several splice variant forms in cells. We found that DP97 mRNA was present as 3.1-kb and 4.3-kb species. The 3.1-kb message corresponds to the clone shown in Fig. 1, and the 4.3-kb message appears in the GenBankTM (accession number NM024072.2) as a similar clone, isolated from human placenta, that contains in addition a 1.2-kb 3′-untranslated region accounting for the 4.3-kb size. No publication associated with this GenBankTM entry has appeared. The 3.1-kb mRNA is the predominant form, accounting for 85% of the total cellular DP97 mRNA in the several human cell lines we examined (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and HepG2). Also, in our isolation of a full-length DP97 clone from a cDNA library, we found an alternatively spliced form that would encode a protein missing amino acids 453–533. It is of note that RNA-binding proteins that modulate ER activity, such as RTA, also exist in multiple alternatively spliced forms (16Norris J.D. Fan D. Sherk A. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).Two other DEAD box RNA helicase proteins have been shown to be specifically involved in modulating nuclear receptor transcriptional activity. RNA helicase p68 interacts with the N-terminal A/B region of ERα and selectively potentiates the activity of ERα; this coactivator does not interact with or serve as a coactivator of either ERβ or other nuclear receptors (58Endoh H. Maruyama K. Masuhiro Y. Kobayashi Y. Goto M. Tai H. Yanagisawa J. Metzger D. Hashimoto S. Kato S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5363-5372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 59Watanabe M. Yanagisawa J. Kitagawa H. Takeyama K. Ogawa S. Arao Y. Suzawa M. Kobayashi Y. Yano T. Yoshikawa H. Masuhiro Y. Kato S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1341-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Another DEAD box RNA helicase, DP103, interacts with the orphan nuclear receptor, steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), and potentiates its transcriptional repression (23Kraus W.L. Montano M.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1603-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In contrast, DP97 interacts with the C-terminal hormone binding region of ERα, ERβ and other nuclear receptors, and functions more broadly as a corepressor of these nuclear hormone receptors. Our findings with DP97 antisense and siRNA provide evidence that endogenous DP97 normally dampens the stimulation and intensifies the repression of estradiol-ER-regulated genes, such that the knockdown of DP97 enables greater estrogen stimulation of up-regulated genes and attenuates the repression of genes that are normally inhibited by the E2-ER complex.Our identification of DP97 localization in nucleoli, as well as throughout the nucleus, is consistent with the reported intracellular localization of most RNA helicases. Since ERα has been previously shown to be nuclear and present in the nucleoplasm, but largely excluded from nucleoli, the interaction between ERα and DP97 may occur either at the edge of the nucleoli and/or with the portion of DP97 that exists within the nucleoplasm. Many nucleolar proteins are dynamic, and constantly cycle between the nucleolus and nucleoplasm (60Chen D. Huang S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), and this may be the case for DP97. The presence of DP97 in the nucleolus suggests that it may have regulatory roles, possibly in RNA and ribosome biosynthesis and processing, in addition to its role in regulation of nuclear hormone receptor activity. In this regard, it is of note that the coregulator PGC1, originally identified as a coregulator of PPARγ-mediated transcriptional activity, but shown more recently to also serve as a coregulator of the ER (61Tcherepanova I. Puigserver P. Norris J.D. Spiegelman B.M. McDonnell D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16302-16308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), exerts dual regulation in that, in addition to its transcriptional regulatory role, it also mediates mRNA splicing (62Monsalve M. Wu Z. Adelmant G. Puigserver P. Fan M. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 307-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Such dual regulatory functions may prove to be a common theme among nuclear receptor coregulators.DEAD-box RNA helicases, as well as certain RNA species themselves, may be involved more broadly than previously envisioned in the actions of nuclear receptor superfamily members and in the regulation of transcription and RNA splicing (63Fan S. Wang J. Yuan R. Ma Y. Meng Q. Erdos M.R. Pestell R.G. Yuan F. Auborn K.J. Goldberg I.D. Rosen E.M. Science. 1999; 284: 1354-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 64Honig A. Auboeuf D.

In addition to the DEAD box RNA helicase DP103 that represses SF-1 activity (65Schulz M. Schneider S. Lottspeich F. Renkawitz R. Eggert M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 476-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and the RNA helicase p68 that functions as a specific hormone-independent coactivator of ERα (66Kato S.H. Endoh Y. Masuhiro Y.

Controversy surrounding this receptor concerns both the nature of the second messengers produced as well as its associated signaling mechanisms. Using the neuronal cell line NG108-15, we have reported previously that activation of the AT2 receptor induced morphological differentiation in a p21 ras -independent, but p42/p44 mapk -dependent mechanism. The activation of p42/p44 mapk was delayed, sustained, and had been shown to be essential for neurite elongation. In the present report, we demonstrate that activation of the AT2 receptor rapidly, but transiently, activated the Rap1/B-Raf complex of signaling proteins. In RapN17- and Rap1GAP-transfected cells, the effects induced by Ang II were abolished, demonstrating that activation of these proteins was responsible for the observed p42/p44 mapk phosphorylation and for morphological differentiation. To assess whether cAMP was involved in the activation of Rap1/B-Raf and neuronal differentiation induced by Ang II, NG108-15 cells were treated with stimulators or inhibitors of the cAMP pathway. We found that dibutyryl cAMP and forskolin did not stimulate Rap1 or p42/p44 mapk activity. Furthermore, adding H-89, an inhibitor of protein kinase A, or Rp-8-Br-cAMP-S, an inactive cAMP analog, failed to impair p42/p44 mapk activity and neurite outgrowth induced by Ang II. The present observations clearly indicate that cAMP, a well known stimulus of neuronal differentiation, did not participate in the AT2 receptor signaling pathways in the NG108-15 cells. Therefore, the AT2 receptor of Ang II activates the signaling modules of Rap1/B-Raf and p42/p44 mapk via a cAMP-independent pathway to induce morphological differentiation of NG108-15 cells.

However, various mediators, which could individually exert opposite effects, such as cGMP, tyrosine or serine/threonine phosphatases, and the extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK1/ERK2 (p42/p44 mapk ) have been associated with activation of the AT2 receptor, depending on cell types and experimental conditions used. More precisely, AT2 receptor activation was shown to decrease p42/p44 mapk activities (35Elbaz N. Bedecs K. Masson M. Sutren M. Strosberg A.D. Nahmias C. Mol.

In their undifferentiated state, neuroblastoma × glioma hybrid NG108-15 cells have a rounded shape and divide actively. It is now well documented that chronic exposure to dibutyryl cAMP induces a process resulting in both morphological and functional differentiation (42Beaman-Hall C.M. Vallano M.L. J.

Methods Enzymol. 1985; 109: 316-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that these cells express only the AT2 receptor of Ang II (6Buisson B.

Gallo J.-M. Payet M.D. Gallo-Payet N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22729-22735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), through a mechanism involving p21 ras inhibition, and a sustained increase in p42/p44 mapk activity (41Gendron L. Laflamme L. Rivard N. Asselin C. Payet M. Gallo-Payet N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1615-1626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because inhibition of p21 ras using the dominant negative mutant RasN17 failed to impair the ability of Ang II to stimulate p42/p44 mapk activity, an alternative pathway for the activation of the p42/p44 mapk cascade must be considered. We have demonstrated recently that nitric oxide and cGMP are involved in the AT2 receptor effects on neurite outgrowth. However, this pathway appeared to be a parallel, complementary, rather than an intermediary step of the AT2 signaling cascade directed to p42/p44 mapk activation (33Gendron L. Côté F. Payet M.D. Gallo-Payet N. Neuroendocrinology. 2002; 75: 70-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).In PC12 cells stimulated with NGF, initiation of neurite outgrowth was accompanied by a sustained increase in p42/p44 mapk activities (44Cowley S.

The active GTP-bound form of Rap1 is known to bind, in vitro, to most p21 ras effectors of the Raf family of kinases, in particular B-Raf and the Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RalGEFs), RalGDS (49Wolthuis R.

Moreover, NGF stimulated Rap1 activity via the exchange factor Crk/C3G and was also shown to activate this pathway through a cAMP-dependent mechanism, involving (51Yao H. York R. Misra-Press A. Carr D. Stork P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8240-8247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) or not involving protein kinase A (52de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar). Similar mechanisms could also be considered for NG108-15 cells because chronic treatment with cAMP analogs is a well known differentiating factor for these cells (42Beaman-Hall C.M. Vallano M.L. J. Neurobiol. 1993; 24: 1500-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 43Hamprecht B. Glaser T. Reiser G. Bayer E. Propst F. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 109: 316-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the Rap1/B-Raf pathway could be involved in the Ang II-induced sustained increase in p42/p44 mapk activity participating in the morphological differentiation of the NG108-15 cells and to verify whether cAMP could be involved in the signaling pathway of the AT2 receptor.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have demonstrated that the binding of Ang II to the AT2 receptor, in NG108-15 cells, increased Rap1/B-Raf activities, two events accompanied by a concomitant decrease in p21 ras and a sustained increase in p42/p44 mapk activities. However, in contrast to many G protein-coupled receptors that activate the Rap1/B-Raf cascade, the action of Ang II is independent of cAMP or PKA, again confirming the atypical nature of this seven-transmembrane domain receptor.Application of Ang II, on NG108-15 cells, led to a transient stimulation of B-Raf kinase activity, as measured by an in vitro kinase assay using MEK1 as a substrate, but it did not affect the basal level of Raf-1 activity. One of the better described activators of B-Raf is the small G protein Rap1 (62Zwartkruis F.J. Bos J.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Using RalGDS as affinity probe, we found that Ang II treatment of NG108-15 cells significantly increased the active, GTP-bound form, of Rap1 within 1 min and B-Raf within 5 min, whereas Raf-1 activity was not modified.Members of the Raf family of proteins include Raf-1, A-Raf, and B-Raf. Neurons are known to express the ubiquitous isoform Raf-1 and the specific neuronal isoform B-Raf (63Dugan L. Kim J. Zhang Y. Bart R. Sun Y. Holtzman D. Gutmann D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25842-25848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In neurons stimulated with NGF, B-Raf is the major isoform activated, with only 5% of the total activity attributed to Raf-1 (64Zheng J. Felder M. Connor J. Poo M. Nature. 1994; 368: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 65Kao S. Jaiswal R.K. Kolch W. Landreth G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18169-18177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The findings that both proteins, Rap1 and B-Raf, are activated after Ang II treatment are thus compatible with the observation that activation of p42/p44 mapk is stimulated in a p21 ras -independent mechanism by the AT2 receptor (41Gendron L. Laflamme L. Rivard N. Asselin C. Payet M. Gallo-Payet N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1615-1626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, our results demonstrated that Rap1 activation is responsible for the AT2-induced p42/p44 mapk phosphorylation as well as for the Ang II-induced neurite outgrowth in NG108-15 cells. In fact, we find that in cells transfected with RapN17 or Rap1GAP constructs (in which the endogenous Rap1 activity is substantially decreased), Ang II-induced p42/p44 mapk activation is abolished. In addition, these transfected cells exposed to Ang II have the same morphology as the native, untreated NG108-15 cells. As we have shown previously that a sustained activation of the p42/p44 mapk pathway was an essential event to promote neurite outgrowth in NG108-15 cells treated with Ang II (41Gendron L. Laflamme L. Rivard N. Asselin C. Payet M. Gallo-Payet N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1615-1626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these results indicate that Rap1 activation is necessary for Ang II to induce p42/p44 mapk activation and that Rap1 is required for the Ang II-induced neurite outgrowth.How Rap1 could be activated in our model remain unknown. In several models, cAMP and cAMP-activated proteins appeared to be of great importance, and many studies have reported the requirement of PKA for NGF activation of Rap1 as well as for p42/p44 mapk (47York R. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C. Eckert S. McCleskey E. Stork P. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Indeed, several studies indicate that treatment of cells with cAMP or analogs induced neurite outgrowth, both in PC12 (44Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1845) Google Scholar) and in NG108-15 cells (24Laflamme L., De Gasparo M. Gallo J.-M. Payet M.D. Gallo-Payet N. J. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1985; 109: 316-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Activation of Rap1 by cAMP favored its association with Raf-1, consequently inhibiting the transient p21 ras -dependent activation of p42/p44 mapk (66Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3671-3683Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In parallel, the action of Rap1 on B-Raf accounted for the sustained stimulatory effect on p42/p44 mapk activity (51Yao H.

In PC12 cells stimulated with NGF, cAMP is required for a sustained increase of p42/p44 mapk activity (51Yao H. York R. Misra-Press A. Carr D. Stork P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8240-8247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), even if in these cells, the NGF TrkA receptor is coupled directly to Rap1 through the adaptor protein CrkII (47York R. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C. Eckert S. McCleskey E. Stork P. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar).However, in the NG108-15 cells stimulated with Ang II, the present results indicate that cAMP (or analogs) and PKA are not involved in the increased activities of Rap1 and B-Raf. We report that the PKA inhibitor H-89 or an inactive cAMP analog, Rp-8-Br-cAMP-S, neither impaired the ability of Ang II to induce p42/p44 mapk activation nor did either affect morphological differentiation. Furthermore, forskolin-induced cAMP production in NG108-15 cells inhibited p42/p44 mapk phosphorylation but did not modify Rap1 activity. These results corroborate our previous observations that coincubation of Ang II with dibutyryl cAMP inhibits differentiation induced by each stimulus alone (24Laflamme L., De Gasparo M. Gallo J.-M. Payet M.D. Gallo-Payet N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22729-22735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Ang II did not stimulate cAMP production or accumulation, demonstrating that the cAMP/PKA pathway is not involved in the AT2 receptor signaling mechanisms leading to p42/p44 mapk activation and neuronal differentiation of NG108-15 cells. Those results corroborate the observations of Sanchez et al. (67Sanchez S. Sayas C. Lim F. Diaz-Nido J. Avila J. Wandosell F. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 468-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) which indicate that in the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y, cAMP-induced neurite outgrowth was independent of p42/p44 mapk activation.Fig. 11 shows, in the same time scale, the sequential activation of Rap1/B-Raf and p42/p44 mapk . The delay between B-Raf and p42/p44 mapk could be explained by the presence of an intermediate type of reaction, such as activation of MEK. In NGF-stimulated cells, York et al. (56York R. Molliver D. Grewal S. Stenberg P. McCleskey E. Stork P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8069-8083Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) have shown a sustained Rap1 activation mediated by TrkA internalization and phosphoinositide 3-kinase activation. In this system, the authors proposed that phosphoinositide 3-kinase favors clathrin-dependent TrkA internalization into the endocytotic compartment where Rap1 is localized. However, such a mechanism is incompatible with the known behavior of the AT2 receptor. Indeed, in contrast to many G protein-coupled receptors, including the AT1 receptor, the AT2receptor does not internalize (68Ouali R. Berthelon M.-C. Bégeot M. Saez J. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 725-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 69Hein L. Meinel L. Pratt R. Dzau V. Kobilka B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1266-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In addition, the differences in activation kinetics could be also the result of variations in the molecular composition and the stability of protein complexes recruited by the different receptors (65Kao S. Jaiswal R.K. Kolch W. Landreth G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18169-18177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar).Our recent observations on the AT2 receptor signaling mechanisms in NG108-15 cells are summarized in Fig. 12. After binding of Ang II, the activated AT2 receptor rapidly inactivates p21 ras (5–120 min) (41Gendron L. Laflamme L. Rivard N. Asselin C. Payet M. Gallo-Payet N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1615-1626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and enhances the level of the GTP-bound form of Rap1 (1–5 min). Activated Rap1 then enhances the activity of B-Raf (5–15 min) which in turn stimulates p42/p44 mapk phosphorylation (30–60 min). Finally, the return of p42/p44 mapk phosphorylation to basal level, occurring much later (seen after 120 min of Ang II treatment), may be under a phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity such as SHP-1, shown to be activated after the AT2receptor stimulation (39Bedecs K. Elbaz N. Sutren M. Masson M. Susini C. Strosberg A.D. Nahmias C. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar).Figure 12Schematic representation of the AT2 receptor signaling mechanisms in the NG108-15 cells. The Ang II AT2 receptor induction of neurite outgrowth and elongation involves at least two distinct, independent, but complementary pathways. First, after binding of Ang II, the activated AT2 receptor rapidly inactivates p21 ras and activates the Rap1/B-Raf pathway, leading to a delayed p42/p44 mapk phosphorylation. Another pathway involving the nitric oxide/soluble guanylyl cyclase/cGMP cascade of signaling is also necessary to observe neurite outgrowth. Stimulation of these two parallel pathways could modulate gene expression and the phosphorylation state of different microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) to control microtubules stability/dynamic responsible for neurite elongation.NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; NO, nitric oxide;sGC, soluble guanylyl cyclase; unP-MAPs, unphosphorylated MAPs; P-MAPs, phosphorylated MAPs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Ang II also stimulates the nitric oxide/soluble guanylyl cyclase/cGMP cascade of signaling (33Gendron L. Côté F. Payet M.D. Gallo-Payet N. Neuroendocrinology. 2002; 75: 70-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Our studies have shown that this cascade, together with MAPK activation, is involved in neurite outgrowth, through a mechanism independent of Ras activation. All of these pathways may have as final targets regulation of gene expression and modulation of the phosphorylation states of different microtubule-associated proteins such as MAP2, tau, and MAP1b, as we have shown previously in NG108-15 cells (24Laflamme L., De Gasparo M. Gallo J.-M. Payet M.D. Gallo-Payet N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22729-22735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) as well as in granule cells from rat cerebellum (25Côté F., Do, T. Laflamme L. Gallo J. Gallo-Payet N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31686-31692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).Three important conclusions can be drawn from the present work. First, Ang II, in NG108-15 cells, induced a rapid activation of Rap1 and B-Raf, two proteins that account for the sustained activation of p42/p44 mapk induced by the AT2receptor. Second, AT2 signaling mechanisms leading to Rap1/B-Raf-dependent p42/p44 mapk activation and neurite elongation are clearly cAMP-independent. Third, the capability of cAMP to induce neurite outgrowth and neuronal differentiation in the NG108-15 cells occurs independently of the sustained increase in p42/p44 mapk activity. Altogether, these observations suggest that when present in the cell type studied, such as neurons, the Rap1/B-Raf signaling cascade could play a pivotal role in transduction (63Dugan L. Kim J. Zhang Y. Bart R. Sun Y. Holtzman D. Gutmann D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25842-25848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of Rap1/B-Raf may explain the controver"

ESCP is homologous to cathepsin C enzymes of higher eukaryotes, but is distinguished from other lysosomal cysteine proteases because it possesses a transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic tail. Tyrosine-based motifs within tails of membrane proteins are known to participate in endosomal/lysosomal protein sorting in higher eukaryotes. In this study, we show that a YRPI motif within the ESCP cytoplasmic tail is necessary and sufficient to mediate ESCP sorting to peripheral vacuoles in Giardia. Deletion and point mutation analysis demonstrated that the tyrosine residue is critical for ESCP sorting, whereas amino acids located at the Y+1 (Arg), Y+2 (Pro), and Y+3 (Ile) positions show minimal effect. Loss of the motif resulted in surface localization, whereas addition of the motif to a variant-specific surface protein resulted in lysosomal localization. Although Giardia trophozoites lack a morphologically discernible Golgi apparatus, our findings indicate that this parasite directs proteins to the lysosomes using a conserved sorting signal similar to that used by yeast and mammalian cells. Because Giardia is one of the earliest branching protist, these results demonstrate that sorting motifs for specific protein traffic developed very early during eukaryotic evolution.

Because Giardia is one of the earliest branching protist, these results demonstrate that sorting motifs for specific protein traffic developed very early during eukaryotic evolution. Lysosomes are membrane-bound acidic organelles involved in degradation of endogenous and exogenous macromolecules via biosynthetic or endocytic pathways, respectively (1Schekman R. Orci L. Science. 1996; 271: 1526-1533Google Scholar, 2Hunziker W. Geuze H.J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 379-389Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, trafficking between the trans-Golgi network (TGN), 1The abbreviations used are: TGN, trans-Golgi network; PV, peripheral vacuole; AP, adaptor protein; ESCP, encystation-specific cysteine protease; HA, hemagglutinin; VSP, variant-specific surface protein; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CWP, cyst wall protein; ESVs, encystation-specific secretory vesicles 1The abbreviations used are: TGN, trans-Golgi network; PV, peripheral vacuole; AP, adaptor protein; ESCP, encystation-specific cysteine protease; HA, hemagglutinin; VSP, variant-specific surface protein; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CWP, cyst wall protein; ESVs, encystation-specific secretory vesicles endosomes, and lysosomes involves several pathways. Mannose 6-phosphate receptors, TGN-38, furin, sortilin, and other proteins are cycled between the TGN and endosomes without ever reaching the lysosomes. Soluble hydrolases bind to mannose 6-phosphate receptors in the TGN by 6-phosphomannosyl residues and travel to endosomes, where they dissociate from their receptor and subsequently reach lysosomes (3Le Borgne R. Hoflack B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 195-209Google Scholar, 4Conibear E. Stevens T.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 211-230Google Scholar). Structural lysosome-associated membrane proteins are sorted from the TGN to the lysosomes through endosomes by way of tyrosine-based motifs. In addition, other proteins are transported directly to the lysosomes without trafficking through endosomes (5Gu F. Crump C.M. Thomas G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1067-1084Google Scholar). Yeast, unlike mammalian cells, contains an endosomal or prevacuolar compartment and a large vacuole that functions like a lysosome. Carboxypeptidase Y is transported to the yeast vacuole by its receptor, Vps10p, which returns to the Golgi by the yeast retromer complex. Alternatively, yeast alkaline phosphatase is transported to the vacuole by a different mechanism that avoids the yeast prevacuolar compartment (5Gu F. Crump C.M. Thomas G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1067-1084Google Scholar). In yeast and mammalian cells, a clear distinction between early/late endosomes and lysosomes has been established. In contrast,Giardia lamblia possesses peripheral vacuoles (PVs) located underneath the plasma membrane that function as endosomes and lysosomes and are therefore considered a primitive endosomal/lysosomal complex (6Lanfredi-Rangel A. Attias M. de Carvalho T.M. Kattenbach W.M. De Souza W. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 123: 225-235Google Scholar). These vacuoles, also called peripheral vesicles, are acidic organelles because they can be labeled with lysosomal markers like acridine orange (6Lanfredi-Rangel A. Attias M. de Carvalho T.M. Kattenbach W.M. De Souza W. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 123: 225-235Google Scholar) and LysoSensor (7Touz M.C. Nores M.J. Slavin I. Carmona C. Conrad J.T. Mowatt M.R. Nash T.E. Coronel C.E. Luján H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8474-8481Google Scholar). PVs can take up horseradish peroxidase without delivering it to any other subcellular compartment, suggesting that PVs may be a unique endocytic compartment (6Lanfredi-Rangel A. Attias M. de Carvalho T.M. Kattenbach W.M. De Souza W. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 123: 225-235Google Scholar). In addition, numerous soluble enzymes such as acid phosphatase, cathepsins B, and RNase are also present in these vacuoles, indicating their lysosomal nature (8Feely D.E. Dyer J.K. J. Protozool. 1987; 34: 80-83Google Scholar, 9Lindmark D.G. Exp. Parasitol. 1988; 65: 141-147Google Scholar, 10Ward W. Alvarado L. Rawlings N.D. Engel J.C. Franklin C. McKerrow J.H. Cell. 1997; 89: 437-444Google Scholar); nevertheless, no receptors involved in the sorting of any of these enzymes have yet been described. Interestingly, PVs are important not only for food degradation, but also for completion of the life cycle of this intestinal parasite.Giardia cycles between the disease-causing flagellated trophozoite and the environmentally resistant cyst, which is released with feces and is responsible for transmission of the disease (11Adam R.D. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 447-475Google Scholar). The participation of PVs has also been described to influence secretory granule discharge during cyst wall formation (12McCaffery J.M. Faubert G.M. Gillin F.D. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 79: 236-249Google Scholar), and PVs act as secretory organelles that release cyst wall-disrupting enzymes during excystation (10Ward W. Alvarado L. Rawlings N.D. Engel J.C. Franklin C. McKerrow J.H. Cell. 1997; 89: 437-444Google Scholar, 13Slavin I. Saura A. Carranza P.G. Touz M.C. Nores M.J. Luján H.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 122: 95-98Google Scholar). In mammalian cells as well as in yeast, specific sorting signals direct transmembrane proteins to endosomes and/or lysosomes, either from the TGN or from the cell surface, and involve tyrosine-based motifs (YXXφ, where X is any amino acid and φ is an amino acid with a bulky hydrophobic side chain) and/or acidic cluster dileucine motifs located in their cytoplasmic tails. These motifs can be found in single or multiple copies and also in combination (14Dell'Angelica E.C. Payne G.S. Cell. 2001; 106: 395-398Google Scholar). The interaction of proteins carrying these motifs with adaptor proteins (APs) and GGA (Golgi-localized,gamma-ear-containing ADP-ribosylation factor-binding) proteins seems to be critical for endosomal/lysosomal protein transport (14Dell'Angelica E.C. Payne G.S. Cell. 2001; 106: 395-398Google Scholar, 15Bonifacino J.S. Dell'Angelica E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 923-926Google Scholar). We recently reported that a cysteine protease of the cathepsin C family is implicated in the processing of a cyst wall protein during encystation and that this enzyme localizes to the peripheral vacuoles of non-encysting Giardia trophozoites (7Touz M.C. Nores M.J. Slavin I. Carmona C. Conrad J.T. Mowatt M.R. Nash T.E. Coronel C.E. Luján H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8474-8481Google Scholar). This encystation-specific cysteine protease (ESCP) possesses a transmembrane domain and a 12-amino acid cytoplasmic tail, unlike cathepsin C enzymes from higher eukaryotes. In the present study, we show that a tyrosine-based sorting signal (YRPI) within the ESCP cytoplasmic tail functions in the sorting of ESCP to lysosome-like peripheral vacuoles in Giardia. To constitutively express ESCP along with three influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitopes (YPYDVPDYAYPYDVPDYAYPYDVPDYA) at the C terminus, the plasmid pTubH7pac carrying the variant-specific surface protein gene vsph7(16Elmendorf H.G. Singer S.M. Pierce J. Cowan J. Nash T.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 113: 157-169Google Scholar) was modified to introduce the tag just before the TGA stop codon and an ApaI site immediately following the vsph7ATG start codon. First, one round of PCR was performed using sense oligonucleotide 5′-ggtacgcgtacccctacgatgtaccagactatgcatagggatccgacttaggtagtaaacgtcatggt-3′ and antisense oligonucleotide 5′-tcgacgcgtaatcgggaacatcatacggataagcgtagtcaggcacatcatatggatagatatccgccttcc cgcggcagacgaacca-3′ (with the MluI site in boldface, the BamHI site underlined, and the EcoRV site in italics), which were restricted with MluI and ligated together. Another round of PCR using the same strategy allowed the insertion of an ApaI site using sense 5′-cctGGGCCCttaattaattgcctaatagcaagcact-3′ and antisense 5′-taaGGGCCCcatggttttatttccgcccgtccagact-3′ primers (with theApaI site in uppercase), resulting in pTubH7HApac. To exchange the escp gene for the vsph7 gene, pTubH7HApac was digested with ApaI and EcoRV to release vsph7. The DNA fragment corresponding to the entireescp coding region was amplified from Giardiagenomic DNA (isolate WB/clone 1267) by PCR using sense 5′-ctgGGGCCCcttttcatcttggcgctcctg-3′ and antisense 5′-taagatatctgcaattattggacggtattt-3′ primers carryingApaI and EcoRV sites, respectively; digested; and ligated into the restricted vector, resulting in pTubESCPHApac. A site-directed mutagenesis kit (QuikChange, Stratagene) was employed to construct deletion/mutations of ESCP inside pTubESCPHApac using two complementary mutagenic oligonucleotide primers based on escp sequence reported previously (GenBankTM/EBI accession numberAF293408) (7Touz M.C. Nores M.J. Slavin I. Carmona C. Conrad J.T. Mowatt M.R. Nash T.E. Coronel C.E. Luján H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8474-8481Google Scholar). For ΔK/A, a second EcoRV site was introduced at the end of the sequence coding for the ESCP transmembrane domain. The plasmid was restricted with EcoRV and ligated together, thereby eliminating the sequence corresponding to the ESCP cytoplasmic tail. For ΔK/K, two complementary primers were designed to omit bases 1588–1606. For ΔY/A, the same strategy was followed, introducing a deletion of bases 1606–1624 (see Fig. 2 A). For the ΔYRPI, ΔY, ΔRP, and ΔI point mutations, the corresponding amino acids were replaced with alanine residues (see Fig.4 A). ESCP variants were confirmed by sequencing using dye terminator cycle sequencing (Beckman Coulter).Figure 4The tyrosine-based motif in the ESCP cytoplasmic tail is essential for lysosomal localization.

Encystation of trophozoite monolayers was accomplished following the method described by Boucher and Gillin (20Boucher S.E. Gillin F.D. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3516-3522Google Scholar). Trophozoites were transfected with the constructs by electroporation and selected by puromycin as previously described (16Elmendorf H.G. Singer S.M. Pierce J. Cowan J. Nash T.E. Mol. Biochem.

Nash T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29307-29313Google Scholar). Primary anti-HA mAb (Sigma) was used to detect ESCP and ESCP variants, and anti-HA mAb or VSPH7-specific mAb G10/4 (27Nash T.E.

The specimens were examined with a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope and/or a Leica TCS-NT/SP confocal microscope. Controls included omission of primary antibody and staining of untransfected cells. For PV localization,Giardia trophozoites were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h in growth medium containing 70 nm LysoTrackerTMRed DND-99 (Molecular Probes, Inc.) as suggested by the manufacturer, chilled, washed twice with PBS and 0.1% growth medium, and attached to coverslips for 30 min at 37 °C. After 40 min of fixation with 4% formaldehyde, the cells were blocked with 10% normal goat serum in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min and then incubated for 1 h with anti-HA antibody in PBS containing 3% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100. Fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Cappel, West Chester, PA) was used to reveal the labeling patterns. Western blotting was performed as previously reported (23Luján H.D. Mowatt M.R. Conrad J.T. Bowers B. Nash T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29307-29313Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of total protein/lane from transfected non-encysting trophozoites were resuspended in 30 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) with 2-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 5 min, and electrophoresed on a 4–12% Tris/glycine-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Invitrogen) and probed with anti-HA antibody (1:2000 dilution). Encysting Giardiatrophozoites were rinsed twice with PBS and 0.1% growth medium; chilled; attached to Thermanox coverslips (Nunc, Naperville, IL); and processed as described previously (24Hayman J.R. Hayes S.F. Amon J. Nash T.E. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7057-7066Google Scholar), except that the primary antibody for tagged ESCP was anti-HA mAb diluted 1:1000. HA-tagged ESCP was constitutively expressed in WB/1267 trophozoites. With anti-HA mAb, ESCP showed a PV localization pattern and colocalized with LysoTracker (Fig.1 and Supplemental Fig. 1), a probe for acidic organelles in living cells (25Wubbolts R. Fernandez-Borja M. Oomen L. Verwoerd D. Janssen H. Calafat J. Tulp A. Dusseljee S. Neefjes J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 611-622Google Scholar). To verify that the HA tag does not interfere with ESCP sorting, tagged variants of ESCP carrying V5 and FLAG epitopes as well as green fluorescent protein were expressed and localized to the PVs by immunofluorescence assays using specific mAbs (data not shown). In addition, acid phosphatase (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AAK97085) and the variant-specific surface protein VSPH7 tagged with HA localized to the PVs 2M. C. Touz and T. E.

To analyze whether the YRPI motif located in the cytoplasmic tail of ESCP determines its localization to the PVs, we constructed a series of variants of this enzyme by deletions and mutations (see “Experimental Procedures” and Figs. 2 A and4 A). The sorting of these variants was examined by immunofluorescence assays using anti-HA mAb. As was previously documented, ESCP localizes to the PVs in Giardia (7Touz M.C. Nores M.J. Slavin I. Carmona C. Conrad J.T. Mowatt M.R. Nash T.E. Coronel C.E. Luján H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8474-8481Google Scholar), but the truncated version ΔK/A showed surface localization indicated by staining of the trophozoite surface and flagella (Fig. 2 B and Supplemental Fig. 2). Expression of ΔK/K, which still has the YXXφ motif, resulted in no change in ESCP localization (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, ΔY/A, which lacks the YRPIIA sequence, relocated the enzyme to the plasma membrane (Fig.2 B). Western blot analysis of total protein extracted from transfected trophozoites confirmed the expression of ESCP and its variants. In every case, 65- and 45-kDa bands corresponding to the immature and mature forms of ESCP, respectively, were observed (Fig.3) (7Touz M.C. Nores M.J. Slavin I. Carmona C. Conrad J.T. Mowatt M.R. Nash T.E. Coronel C.E. Luján H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8474-8481Google Scholar). These results prompted us to perform a more detailed analysis of the YRPI sorting signal because only the construct lacking this motif failed to localize ESCP to peripheral vacuoles. Mutation of YRPI (ΔYRPI) to alanine residues resulted in missorting of the protein to the plasma membrane, showing that this motif is essential for ESCP localization (Fig. 4,A and B). Exchanging tyrosine (ΔY) with alanine localized ΔY to the surface, whereas replacement of the residue that follow tyrosine at position +3 (ΔI) had an intermediate effect because the enzyme was detected both at the surface and in the PVs (Fig. 4, A and B). However, when Arg and Pro were replaced, the enzyme remained in the PVs (data not shown). These results indicate that the tyrosine within the cytoplasmic tail is critical for ESCP peripheral vacuole localization. VSPH7 is a variant-specific surface protein ofGiardia clone GS/M-H7 that possesses a single transmembrane domain and a conserved CRGKA cytoplasmic tail and that covers the entire cell surface, including the flagella (26Nash T.E. Mowatt M.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 51: 219-227Google Scholar). VSPH7 is not expressed in Giardia clone WB/1267, allowing detection of VSPH7 at the surface of transfected WB trophozoites using VSPH7-specific mAb G10/4 (16Elmendorf H.G. Singer S.M. Pierce J. Cowan J. Nash T.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 113: 157-169Google Scholar, 27Nash T.E. Conrad J.T. Mowatt M.R. J. Eukaryotic Microbiol. 1995; 42: 604-609Google Scholar). First, it was important to determine whether VSPH7 does have also a sorting motif for its plasma membrane localization. In this way, expression of VSPH7-HA (VSPH7 with an HA tag at its C terminus), ΔH7 (tagged VSPH7 without its cytoplasmic tail), and ΔH7-AA (tagged VSPH7 with the amino acids in its tail changed to alanine residues) showed the same localization profile on the surface of trophozoites compared with expression of native VSPH7, as determined using either anti-HA mAb (Fig. 5,A and B) or mAb G10/4 (data not shown). Thus, these result shows that the HA epitope does not affect VSPH7 localization and that the conserved CRGKA cytoplasmic tail is not involved in VSPH7 plasma membrane sorting. To analyze whether the ESCP cytoplasmic tail can modify VSPH7 sorting, two different chimeras were expressed in WB/1267 trophozoites: VSPH7-HA possessing the transmembrane domain of ESCP (cH7TM) and VSPH7-HA possessing the ESCP cytoplasmic tail instead of its own conserved tail (cH7CT) (Fig. 6 A). Expression of cH7TM resulted in no change in localization because the chimera remained in the plasma membrane (Fig. 6 B). Immunofluorescence assay using G10/4, a mAb that recognizes the VSPH7 extracellular domain, confirmed the surface localization of cH7TM in viable trophozoites (Supplemental Fig. 3). These results indicate that the 27-amino acid transmembrane domain of VSPH7 does not contain a specific signal for surface localization and that a protein carrying the 24-amino acid ESCP transmembrane domain is transported to the plasma membrane. In contrast, cH7CT was localized to the PVs, the same subcellular localization as ESCP (Fig. 6 C). Moreover, in viable cells, mAb G10/4 failed to detect cH7CT at the surface of the trophozoite (Supplemental Fig. 3). Taken together, these results show that the cytoplasmic tail of ESCP has all the information necessary to direct proteins to Giardia peripheral vesicles. Furthermore, these findings suggest that a long transmembrane domain is essential for VSPs to be transported to the plasma membrane (see “Discussion”). ESCP expression and activity increase during encystation and are involved in the processing of one of the proteins forming the cyst wall (CWP2) (7Touz M.C. Nores M.J. Slavin I. Carmona C. Conrad J.T. Mowatt M.R. Nash T.E. Coronel C.E. Luján H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8474-8481Google Scholar). Although CWP2 and ESCP colocalize in encysting cells, how and where this interaction takes place are unknown (7Touz M.C. Nores M.J. Slavin I. Carmona C. Conrad J.T. Mowatt M.R. Nash T.E. Coronel C.E. Luján H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8474-8481Google Scholar). Here, we analyzed ESCP/CWP2 interaction during encystation by immunofluorescence and ESCP subcellular localization by immunoelectron microscopy in encysting trophozoites. Using directly labeled anti-CWP2 mAb and anti-HA mAb for the detection of ESCP, we found that, at the beginning of encystation, ESCP was in the PVs close to the encysting trophozoite plasma membrane, whereas CWP2 was detected in the ESVs (Fig.7 A). In contrast, during cyst wall formation, both colocalized in the developing cyst wall and in the cyst wall in mature cysts (Fig. 7 A). Immunoelectron microscopy showed ESCP in ESVs as well as on the surface and in the PVs of encysting cells (Fig. 7 B and Supplemental Fig. 4). The fact that ESCP could be found inside ESVs close to peripheral vacuoles and its localization at the surface suggest that ESVs interact with PVs during ESV discharge and/or at the time of release onto the surface of encysting trophozoites. In higher eukaryotes, the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex play a central role in the correct protein folding and transport. Proteins transported to endosomes or lysosomes are generally sorted away from the trafficking pathway taken by secretory proteins and are instead targeted to the endocytic compartments (28Traub L.M. Kornfeld S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 527-533Google Scholar).Giardia does have an endomembranous system that differs from that of higher eukaryotes (29Adam R.D. Int. J. Parasitol. 2000; 30: 475-484Google Scholar). Giardia lacks organelles that resemble early and late endosomes and instead has peripheral vacuoles with hydrolytic activity. The property of these organelles to accumulate macromolecules and, at the same time, the presence of lysosome-like soluble hydrolases suggest that this parasite possesses an endosomal/lysosomal system represented in this single organelle (6Lanfredi-Rangel A. Attias M. de Carvalho T.M. Kattenbach W.M. De Souza W. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 123: 225-235Google Scholar). In addition, these vacuoles seem to perform multiple cellular functions because they also act as secretory organelles at certain points of theGiardia life cycle (7Touz M.C. Nores M.J. Slavin I. Carmona C. Conrad J.T. Mowatt M.R. Nash T.E. Coronel C.E. Luján H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8474-8481Google Scholar, 13Slavin I. Saura A. Carranza P.G. Touz M.C. Nores M.J. Luján H.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 122: 95-98Google Scholar). Despite these differences, in a number of ways, protein transport in Giardia resembles that in higher eukaryotes. One example is the constitutive secretion of VSPs (26Nash T.E. Mowatt M.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 51: 219-227Google Scholar, 27Nash T.E. Conrad J.T. Mowatt M.R. J. Eukaryotic Microbiol. 1995; 42: 604-609Google Scholar) and the regulated secretion of CWPs (23Luján H.D. Mowatt M.R. Conrad J.T. Bowers B. Nash T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29307-29313Google Scholar, 30Mowatt M.R. Luján H.D. Cotten D.B. Bowers B. Yee J. Nash T.E. Stibbs H.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 955-963Google Scholar, 31Luján H.D. Mowatt M.R. Nash T.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 294-304Google Scholar). In addition, signal peptides target VSPs and CWPs through the secretory pathway inGiardia (26Nash T.E. Mowatt M.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 51: 219-227Google Scholar, 27Nash T.E. Conrad J.T. Mowatt M.R. J. Eukaryotic Microbiol. 1995; 42: 604-609Google Scholar), and conserved motifs such as the BiP chaperone/endoplasmic reticulum retention motif (KDEL) are present in this parasite (32Luján H.D. Mowatt M.R. Conrad J.T. Nash T.E. Biol. Cell. 1996; 86: 11-18Google Scholar). The tyrosine-based motif (YRPI) involved in ESCP transport to the PVs in Giardia is another example of similarity of secretory mechanisms to more evolved cells. In higher eukaryotes, a tyrosine-based signal defines a motif that has the consensus YXXφ or NPXY (33Marks M.S. Woodruff L. Ohno H. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 341-354Google Scholar). In vitro analyses have shown that this motif interacts with the μ-subunits of almost all APs described so far (14Dell'Angelica E.C. Payne G.S. Cell. 2001; 106: 395-398Google Scholar, 15Bonifacino J.S. Dell'Angelica E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 923-926Google Scholar). Despite that each μ-subunit has a preference for 1 amino acid at the X position favoring a nonpolar, an arginine-rich, and an acidic amino acid for AP1, AP2, and AP3, respectively, there is also an overlapping specificity (YIPL) among them (34Ohno H. Aguilar R.C. Yeh D. Taura D. Saito T. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25915-25921Google Scholar). Furthermore, AP μ-subunits also have predilections for the φ position, preferring leucine and isoleucine over other hydrophobic amino acids (34Ohno H. Aguilar R.C. Yeh D. Taura D. Saito T. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25915-25921Google Scholar). In the case ofGiardia, the YRPI motif within the ESCP cytoplasmic tail appears to be a putative adaptor-binding domain because it has a proline and an isoleucine at the Y+2 and Y+3 positions, respectively. The exchange of YRPI for alanine residues altered the localization of ESCP from the PVs to the plasma membrane. Moreover, recognition by tyrosine plays a major role in ESCP localization because its replacement was sufficient to relocate the enzyme to other cellular organelles. Point mutation of residues Y+1/Y+2 and Y+3 showed that only the isoleucine at position +3 has a moderate effect on ESCP subcellular localization. It is possible that, as was described for other proteins (15Bonifacino J.S. Dell'Angelica E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 923-926Google Scholar), residues Y+2 and Y+3 may help expose the tyrosine residue to the adaptor subunit, rather than being involved in adaptor recognition. To better understand protein sorting signals in the primitive eukaryoteG. lamblia, we performed additional experiments using a type I membrane protein, the variant-specific surface protein VSPH7. When VSPH7 (VSP of Giardia clone GS/M) is expressed inGiardia clone WB/1267, it shows a surface pattern (16Elmendorf H.G. Singer S.M. Pierce J. Cowan J. Nash T.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 113: 157-169Google Scholar). Like all VSPs described so far (26Nash T.E. Mowatt M.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 51: 219-227Google Scholar, 27Nash T.E. Conrad J.T. Mowatt M.R. J. Eukaryotic Microbiol. 1995; 42: 604-609Google Scholar, 35Papanastasiou P. Bruderer T. Li Y. Bommeli C. Kohler P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 86: 13-27Google Scholar, 36Papanastasiou P.

Chem. 1995; 270: 13807-13813Google Scholar, 38Nash T.E. Luján H.T. Mowatt M.R. Conrad J.T. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1922-1923Google Scholar), VSPH7 possesses a 27-amino acid transmembrane domain and a conserved 5-amino acid cytoplasmic tail (CRGKA). When the 24-residues ESCP transmembrane segment replaced the VSPH7 transmembrane domain, the localization of the VSPH7 chimera remained unchanged. In addition, when VSPH7 lacking the cytoplasmic tail was expressed, the protein appeared on the surface, similar to when the CRGKA tail of VSPH7 was exchanged for 5 alanine residues. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the length of the transmembrane domain is critical for protein localization, supporting the model wherein short transmembrane domains (≤17 residues) direct proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum and cis-Golgi, and proteins with long transmembrane domains (≥23 residues) direct proteins to the plasma membrane (39Honsho M. Mitoma J.Y. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20860-20866Google Scholar, 40Yang M. Ellenberg J. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1970-1975Google Scholar, 41Itin C. Schindler R. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 57-67Google Scholar, 42Itin C. Foguet M. Kappeler F. Klumperman J. Hauri H.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 541-544Google Scholar, 43Watson R.T. Pessin J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C215-C223Google Scholar). Transmembrane proteins inGiardia seem to follow the same criteria. Similar to VSPs, other proteins such as dipeptidyl peptidase IV (44Touz M.C. Nores M.J. Slavin I. Piacenza L. Acosta D. Carmona C. Luján H.D. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 703-710Google Scholar) and syntaxin-1 (GenBankTM/EBI accession numberAF293409), 2M. C. Touz and T. E. Nash, unpublished data., 3M. C. Touz, M. J. Nores, N. Gottig, and H. D. Luján, unpublished data. which have long transmembrane domains, also localized to the plasma membrane, whereas syntaxin-2 (accession number AF293410), a protein with a short transmembrane domain, localized at the Golgi of encysting trophozoites. 4M. C. Touz, H. D. Luján, and T. E. Nash, unpublished data. In addition, a recent report showed that when the VSPH7 transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail were added to the extracellular domain of a membrane-anchored SAG1 protein of Toxoplasma gondii, the protein was localized to the surface, including the flagella ofGiardia trophozoites (45Marti M. Li Y. Kohler P. Hehl A.B. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 1014-1016Google Scholar). This agrees with the idea that the transmembrane domain, but not a motif or special structure inside the VSPH7 extracellular domain, is critical for its localization. Furthermore, we found that the VSPH7 cytoplasmic tail does not contain a trafficking motif, but, because it is highly conserved, may have an additional unknown function. When the cytoplasmic tail of VSPH7 was substituted for the ESCP counterpart, the localization of VSPH7 changed from the cell surface to the PVs. These findings suggest that the transmembrane domain directs the transport of membrane-associated proteins in Giardiaunless they have a sorting signal that specifically routes the protein to another organelle. There are at least two different mechanisms involved in protein trafficking to the PVs in Giardia. This study shows that a conserved tyrosine-based motif in the cytoplasmic tail of ESCP is critical for ESCP localization to the PVs. In contrast, soluble PV proteins such as acid phosphatase and cathepsins B do not contain a tyrosine-based motif. It is possible that these soluble lysosomal proteins, similar to those in the mammalian system, require a receptor-mediated sorting process that involves mannose 6-phosphate receptor- and adaptor-like proteins. Although mannose 6-phosphate receptor-like proteins have not been reported in Giardia, proteins with some homology to the α-subunit (α-adaptin gene, GenBankTM/EBI accession number AF486293) and γ-subunit (γ-adaptin gene, accession number AF486294) as well as the μ-subunit (GiMuA, accession number AAL82729; and GiMuB, accession number AY078978) of putative APs have been identified, supporting this idea. It is also well known that the Giardia secretory system undergoes radical changes during encystation (23Luján H.D. Mowatt M.R. Conrad J.T. Bowers B. Nash T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29307-29313Google Scholar, 30Mowatt M.R. Luján H.D. Cotten D.B. Bowers B. Yee J. Nash T.E. Stibbs H.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 955-963Google Scholar, 46Luján H.D. Marotta A.

The most remarkable events are the presence of a well defined Golgi apparatus and the biogenesis of ESVs that transport newly synthesized CWPs to the plasma membrane for release and cyst wall formation. In the present study, during encystation, ESCP was seen inside ESVs and in the plasma membrane in addition to the PVs. Because ESCP is involved in the processing of CWP2 during cyst wall formation, it is possible that PVs fuse with ESVs where interaction between the enzyme ESCP and the substrate CWP2 takes place. After CWP2 processing, both proteins could then be released by exocytosis in a way that involves a calcium-dependent process (49Touz M.C. Gottig N. Nash T.E. Luján H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50557-50563Google Scholar). The findings presented here confirm the previous suggestion that ESVs interact with PVs during the latter stages of encystation (31Luján H.D. Mowatt M.R. Nash T.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 294-304Google Scholar). As an early diverging protist, Giardia seems to have a relatively elementary subcellular organization (11Adam R.D. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 447-475Google Scholar). In particular, it has one of the most basic systems for protein transport and degradation (11Adam R.D. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 447-475Google Scholar). However, it also shares many characteristics with higher eukaryotes, as in the case of conserved sorting motifs. Further studies regarding different sorting signals in Giardia and the molecules interacting with them will provide new insight to better understand the evolution of intracellular protein transport and subcellular organization in eukaryotes and also contribute to defining new targets for therapeutic intervention. We thank Drs. Dennis M. Dwyer and Cecilia Arighi for helpful discussion and John T. Conrad and Liudmila Kulakova for technical suggestions."
https://openalex.org/W2082887794,"We have previously demonstrated that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) is necessary and sufficient to account for epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced mitogenesis in rat primary hepatocytes. A cytosolic Gab2-containing complex accounts for >80% of the total EGF-induced PI3-kinase activity (Kong, M., Mounier, C., Wu, J., and Posner, B. I. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 36035-36042), suggesting a key role for Gab2 in EGF-induced mitogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that PP1, a selective inhibitor of Src family kinases, blocks the EGF-induced Gab2 tyrosine phosphorylation without inhibiting EGF-induced phosphorylation of the EGF receptor, ErbB3, or Shc. We also show that Gab2 phosphorylation is increased in Csk knockout cells in which Src family kinases are constitutively activated. Furthermore, PP1 blocks Gab2-associated downstream events including EGF-induced PI3-kinase activation, Akt phosphorylation, and DNA synthesis. We demonstrate that Gab2 and Src are constitutively associated. Since this association involves the proline-rich sequences of Gab2, it probably involves the Src homology 3 domain of Src kinase. Mutation of the proline-rich sequences in Gab2 prevented EGF-induced Gab2 phosphorylation, PI3-kinase/Akt activation, and DNA synthesis, demonstrating that Gab2 phosphorylation is critical for EGF-induced mitogenesis and is not complemented by ErbB3 or Shc phosphorylation. We also found that overexpression of a Gab2 mutant lacking SHP2 binding sites increased EGF-induced Gab2 phosphorylation and the activation of PI3-kinase but blocked activation of MAPK. In addition, we demonstrated that the Src-induced response was down-regulated by Gab2-associated SHP2. In summary, our results have defined the role for Src activation in EGF-induced hepatic mitogenesis through the phosphorylation of Gab2 and the activation of the PI3-kinase cascade."

Although these diseases involve similar mutations in very close locations in rhodopsin, their progression is very different, with retinitis pigmentosa being severe and causing retinal degeneration. We report on the expression and characterization of the recently found T94I mutation associated with congenital night blindness, in the second transmembrane helix or rhodopsin, and mutations at the same site. T94I mutant rhodopsin folded properly and was able to bind 11-cis-retinal to form chromophore, but it showed a blue-shifted visible band at 478 nm and reduced molar extinction coefficient. Furthermore, T94I showed dramatically reduced thermal stability, extremely long lived metarhodopsin II intermediate, and highly increased reactivity toward hydroxylamine in the dark, when compared with wild type rhodopsin. The results are consistent with the location of Thr-94 in close proximity to Glu-113 counterion in the vicinity of the Schiff base linkage and suggest a role for this residue in maintaining the correct dark inactive conformation of the receptor. The reported results, together with previously published data on the other two known congenital night blindness mutants, suggest that the molecular mechanism underlying this disease may not be structural misfolding, as proposed for retinitis pigmentosa mutants, but abnormal functioning of the receptor by decreased thermal stability and/or constitutive activity.

Naturally occurring mutations in rhodopsin (most of them single amino acid replacements) are associated with retinal disease. Most of these are the cause of retinitis pigmentosa (RP), 1The abbreviations used are: RP, retinitis pigmentosa; CNB, congenital night blindness; DM, n-docecyl β-d-maltoside; MetaI, metarhodopsin I; MetaII, metarhodopsin II; PSB, protonated Schiff base; WT, wild type a group of inherited retinal degenerative diseases (1Farrar G.J.

Over 100 mutations have been found to date in the opsin gene associated with RP, most of them being inherited as an autosomal dominant trait (1Farrar G.J. Kenna P.F. Humphries P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 857-864Google Scholar). These are located in all the three domains of rhodopsin, namely the intradiscal, the transmembrane, and the cytoplasmic domains of the protein (5Berson E.L. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1993; 34: 1659-1676Google Scholar). Mutations in the transmembrane and intradiscal domains of rhodopsin that cause RP have been shown to cause misfolding of the mutant proteins (6Liu X. Garriga P. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4554-4559Google Scholar, 7Garriga P. Liu X. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4560-4564Google Scholar, 8Hwa J. Garriga P. Liu X. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10571-10576Google Scholar). Only a very small number of mutations have been associated with the retinal disease characterized by a congenital night blindness (CNB) phenotype. CNB appears to be a stable condition that does not seem to cause photoreceptor degeneration resulting mainly in night vision impairment. Two of these mutations were previously studied, namely G90D (9Rao V.K. Cohen G.B. Oprian D.D. Nature. 1994; 367: 639-642Google Scholar) and A292E (10Dryja T.P. Berson E.L. Rao V.R. Oprian D.D. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 280-283Google Scholar) in transmembrane helices II and VII of rhodopsin, respectively. The mechanism of action of the G90D and A292E mutations was proposed to be persistent activation of the phototransduction pathway by constitutive activity of the mutant proteins (9Rao V.K. Cohen G.B. Oprian D.D. Nature. 1994; 367: 639-642Google Scholar, 10Dryja T.P. Berson E.L. Rao V.R. Oprian D.D. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 280-283Google Scholar, 11Rao V.R. Oprian D.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1996; 25: 287-314Google Scholar). Another possible explanation for the observed G90D mutant phenotype has been proposed, i.e. enhanced rate of thermal isomerization due to lowered activation energy caused by the mutation (12Sieving P.A. Richards J.E. Naarendorp F. Bingham E.L. Scott K. Alpern M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 880-884Google Scholar, 13Sieving P.A. Fowler M.L. Bush R.A. Machida S. Calvert P.D. Green D.G. Makino C.L. McHenry C.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5449-5460Google Scholar). More recently, a third mutation associated with CNB, T94I, in the second transmembrane helix of rhodopsin, has been described (14al-Jandal N. Farrar G.J. Kiang A.S. Humphries M.M. Bannon N. Findlay J.B. Humphries P. Kenna P.F. Hum. Mutat. 1999; 13: 75-81Google Scholar). The study of mutations associated with CNB can provide important information about the differences between RP and CNB at the molecular level. A region of rhodopsin in the transmembrane helix II, toward the intradiscal site of the protein, is particularly interesting to investigate these differences. In this region, similar mutations in close proximity in rhodopsin cause RP and CNB: G87D (RP), G89D (RP), G90D (CNB), and T94I (CNB) (Fig. 1). Thus, although these diseases involve similar mutations in very close locations in rhodopsin, it is still a puzzle that their progression is very different, with RP being responsible for a severe phenotype causing retinal degeneration. We report here on the expression and characterization of the T94I CNB mutant and other mutations at the 94 site, T94D, T94S, and T94K. Our results are consistent with the location of Thr-94 close to the retinal Schiff base linkage and suggest a role for this residue in keeping the correct structure of the retinal binding pocket of rhodopsin. A very unusual property is the extremely slow Meta II decay process of the mutant T94I. Although no misfolding is detected for this mutant, the high hydroxylamine reactivity indicates that its dark structure is significantly altered. Also, the low thermal stability in the dark may be relevant to the molecular mechanism of CNB (12Sieving P.A. Richards J.E. Naarendorp F. Bingham E.L. Scott K. Alpern M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 880-884Google Scholar, 13Sieving P.A. Fowler M.L. Bush R.A. Machida S. Calvert P.D. Green D.G. Makino C.L. McHenry C.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5449-5460Google Scholar). The results obtained for the Thr-94 mutants highlight the tight coupling between the structural domains of rhodopsin in in vivo folding of this receptor. They also provide evidence that the molecular mechanism of CNB does not involve misfolding of the mutated proteins, as has been proposed (or shown) for many RP mutations, but it may be related to conformational stability changes of the mutant receptors. 11-cis-Retinal was purified from illuminated all-trans-retinal using a modified version of a protocol described previously (15Liu R.S.H. Asato A.E. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 88: 506-516Google Scholar). Dodecyl maltoside (DM) was from Anatrace (Maumee, OH). Antirhodopsin monoclonal antibody rho-1D4 was obtained from the National Cell Culture Center (Minneapolis, MN) and was coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Sigma). The binding capacity of the resulting antibody Sepharose was 0.6 μg/μl of the beads. The buffers used are as follows: buffer A, 1.8 mmKH2PO4, 10 mmNa2HPO4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.2; buffer B, buffer A plus 5 mmATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% (w/v) DM; buffer C, buffer A plus 0.05% DM; buffer D, 2 mmNaH2PO4, pH 6.0, 0.05% DM; buffer E, buffer D plus 150 mm NaCl. Construction of the mutant opsin genes at position 94 was carried out by replacement of the BglII-NcoI restriction fragment in the synthetic opsin gene in the pMT4 vector (16Franke R.R. Sakmar T.P. Oprian D.D. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2119-2122Google Scholar). The cloning strategy involved the ligation of a large fragment from EcoRI/NotI digestion (5128 bp), a small fragment from EcoRI/BglII digestion (251 bp), and a small fragment from NcoI/NotI/XmnI digestion (752 bp) with the appropriate annealed synthetic oligonucleotide duplexes. The synthetic oligonucleotides used were 51-mer (both strands), with the following sequence for the wild type for the top strand 5′-gAT CTC TTC Atg gTC TTC ggT ggC TTCACC ACC ACC CTC TAC ACC TCT CTC-3′, and 5′-CTAg gAg AgA ggT gTA gAg ggT ggT gAA gCC ACC gAA gAC CAT gAA gA-3′ for the bottom strand. The mutants contained the following codon changes at the threonine codon (ACC) underlined above: T94I, ACC → ATC; T94D, ACC → GAT; T94S, ACC → TCT; and T94K, ACC → AAG. Plasmid DNAs were analyzed first by restriction analysis (using NcoI enzyme) followed by DNA sequencing by the dideoxy chain-terminated method. The wild type and the mutant genes were expressed in transiently transfected monkey kidney cells (COS-1) as described (17Oprian D.D. Molday R.S. Kaufman R.J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8874-8878Google Scholar). Transfected cells were harvested 50 h from the time of DNA incubation, washed twice with buffer A, and treated with 50 μm11-cis-retinal for 12 h at 4 °C for reconstitution. The cells were then solubilized in buffer B but in the absence of 5 mm ATP and 5 mm MgCl2 (2 ml/plate) for 1 h at 4 °C. Regeneration with all-trans-retinal was carried out by addition of 50 μm purified all-trans-retinal to the COS-cell suspension for 12 h at 4 °C. Purification was carried out using rho-1D4 Sepharose in a newly designed glass microcolumn (5.6 cm × 3 mm internal diameter). The packed bed volume of the column was 400 μl of rho-1D4-Sepharose resin (binding capacity of 0.6 μg/μl). The column was first equilibrated with 10 ml of buffer A containing 1% DM, and the protein was loaded onto the column for ∼2 h at a rate of 100 μl/min. The column was subsequently washed with 10 ml of buffer C, followed by 10-ml wash with buffer D at the same rate, and eluted in buffer D containing 100 μm of C′1–9 peptide, at a rate of 60 μl/min. Twenty four elution fractions, about 400 μl/each, were collected. The first 12 fractions eluted were with low salt elution (buffer D), and the next 12 fractions were with high salt elution (buffer E). Absorption spectra were recorded with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences λ6 spectrophotometer equipped with water-jacketed cuvette holders connected to a circulating water bath. All spectra were recorded with a bandwidth of 2 nm, response time of 1 s, and scan speed of 480 nm/min at 20 °C. For photobleaching experiments, the samples were illuminated with a 150-watt fiber optic light equipped with a 495-nm long pass filter for 10 s, and spectra were immediately recorded. In some cases the bleaching was carried out for further periods of time up to 2 min. Hydroxylamine treatment was performed by adding an aliquot of a 1m NH2OH, pH 7.0, stock solution to the sample, to a final concentration of 30 mm. Thermal bleaching experiments involved measuring the decrease of absorption at λmax in the visible with time at 37 °C. The rate of MetaII decay was measured, after illumination of the samples for 30 s, by means of fluorescence spectroscopy (18Farrens D.L. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5073-5076Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μg of protein in 200 μl of buffer D were allowed to equilibrate at 20 °C for 30 min, then bleached for 30 s, and the fluorescence increase measured. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 295 (slit = 0.25 nm) and 330 nm (slit = 12 nm), respectively. Spectra were normalized and fitted to single exponential functions using SigmaPlot to derive thet 12 values. The expressed opsin proteins from T94I, T94D, T94S, and T94K were purified (Fig. 2) using separation on a rho-1D4 Sepharose column as under “Experimental Procedures.” A selective elution chromatographic method (19Ridge K.D. Lu Z. Liu X. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3261-3267Google Scholar) was used to separate the folded (retinal-binding species; eluted at pH 6, no salt) and misfolded fractions (non-retinal binding species; eluted at pH 6, 150 mm NaCl) of the different recombinant rhodopsins studied. This method was previously used in the study of mutants associated with RP (6Liu X. Garriga P. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4554-4559Google Scholar, 7Garriga P. Liu X. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4560-4564Google Scholar, 8Hwa J. Garriga P. Liu X. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10571-10576Google Scholar). Similar elution profiles were obtained for the wild type and the T94I and T94D mutants (Fig. 2, A–C) with most of the protein eluting with pH 6 buffer, with no salt, in the third fraction, and only a very small amount of non-retinal binding fraction eluting with added salt. In the case of the T94S mutant the elution behavior was similar to that for the wild type, but, in addition, a significant amount of protein eluted with 150 mm salt (Fig. 2 D). In contrast, the protein from T94K mutant eluted predominantly at high salt conditions with very little protein being eluted at low salt condition indicating that most of the protein is misfolded. UV-visible absorption spectra in the dark for the wild type and for the low salt eluting fractions from the Thr-94 mutants are shown in Fig.3. Thus, all the rhodopsin mutants (A–D), except for T94K (E), showed rhodopsin-like chromophores withA 280/A 500 ratios in the 1.7–1.9 range (WT and T94D, 1.7; T94I, 1.9; and T94S, 1.8). T94K (E) formed very little A 500 absorbing chromophore and showed some absorption at about 380 nm. In the case of the mutant T94S there was some amount of misfolded protein eluting at high salt (trace II, D). The amount of misfolded opsin eluted at high salt conditions was very high for the mutant T94K indicating that most of this mutant protein was misfolded (trace II,E). T94I formed chromophore like the wild type protein, the slightly higher A 280/A 500ratio being presumably due to a change in the ε of the maximum of the visible absorption band for the mutant protein. All the mutants studied showed blue-shifted visible absorption maxima, especially the T94I mutant with an absorption maximum in the visible region at 478 nm (Table I). The shift for the other mutants is less pronounced, with λmax of 494 nm for T94S and 496 nm for T94D, respectively.Table IAbsorbance maxima (λmax) and Metall decay rates of wild type and rhodopsin mutantsRecombinant rhodopsinλmaxaλmax, wavelength of the absorption band in the visible region for wild type and the mutants.Retinal release, t 1/2, minbBy the fluorescence increase assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Wild type50015.8T94I47896.9T94D49630.1T94S4947.2T94KNDcND, not determined due to the extremely low amount of chromophore formed by this mutant.NDcND, not determined due to the extremely low amount of chromophore formed by this mutant.a λmax, wavelength of the absorption band in the visible region for wild type and the mutants.b By the fluorescence increase assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.”c ND, not determined due to the extremely low amount of chromophore formed by this mutant. Open table in a new tab The photobleaching of the T94I and T94S mutants showed wild type-like behavior on illumination (Fig. 4). Thus, after 10 s of illumination with light >495 nm formed the characteristic 380 nm-absorbing species with concomitant disappearance of the visible band (Fig. 4, A–C). In contrast, T94D showed a very abnormal behavior (Fig. 4 D). After 10 s of illumination, the product showed λmax at 480 nm, presumably a MetaI-like product that changed little upon further illumination for up to 2 min and then being kept in the dark for 1 h. Altered photobleaching has also been reported for the G90D mutant (9Rao V.K. Cohen G.B. Oprian D.D. Nature. 1994; 367: 639-642Google Scholar), but in this case the Meta I-like species formed upon illumination decayed in the dark in a 1-h period even at the lower temperature of 15 °C (9Rao V.K. Cohen G.B. Oprian D.D. Nature. 1994; 367: 639-642Google Scholar). Altered photobleaching has been also reported for other mutants involving the introduction of Asp, like the RP G89D mutant (8Hwa J. Garriga P. Liu X. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10571-10576Google Scholar). In this case, the species formed upon illumination decayed in the dark to free opsin plus all-trans-retinal which is different from the behavior observed for the T94D mutant we describe here which does not decay in the dark in the same period of time. An aspect relevant to the functionality of the mutant proteins is the stability of their photoactive conformations, i.e. their MetaII species. The decay of the photointermediate MetaII formed upon rhodopsin illumination was examined for the wild type and the Thr-94 mutants by fluorescence spectroscopy. The fluorescence curves were fitted to a single exponential function, and thet 12 for the processes was derived (Table I). Thet 12 values for the MetaII decay for the wild type rhodopsin is typically about 15 min under the conditions of the assay. All the mutants studied showed very abnormal values compared with wild type. T94D and T94I showed very slow decay processes, being about 2- and 6.5-fold slower than the wild type, respectively. In the case of the T94I this is the slowest MetaII decay process reported for a mutant so far. T94S showed a 2-fold faster MetaII decay than wild type rhodopsin. Although the purified mutants showed goodA 280/A 500 ratio indicating the presence of correctly folded proteins, it was important to investigate the stability of these proteins in the dark state and their Schiff base accessibility. To this goal, assays were carried out to measure the chromophore stability in the dark (thermal bleaching) and the accessibility of the protonated Schiff base (PSB) in the dark (hydroxylamine reactivity). Thermal bleaching was followed by monitoring the decay of the visible absorption band with time at 37 °C in the dark (Fig.5 A). The results obtained show that wild type rhodopsin and the mutant T94S had the same behavior in their stability in the period studied. The mutant T94D was less stable (20% decrease in 5 h), and T94I, in particular, showed reduced thermal stability (loss of 70% absorption in 5 h, Fig.5 A). The accessibility of the PSB toward hydroxylamine was also measured in the dark (Fig. 5 B). Again, wild type rhodopsin and the mutant T94S were completely stable to NH2OH reactivity in the dark for 2 h, and the susceptibility of the mutants T94D and T94I to hydroxylamine again followed the order they showed for thermal instability. After 2 h about 45% of the mutant T94D had survived, although the mutant T94I had reacted with hydroxylamine more than 80%. As seen in Fig.6, the T94I mutant also bound all-trans-retinal forming a chromophore with its visible absorption band located at 466 nm, close to the 478 nm band observed for the same mutant regenerated with 11-cis-retinal (Fig.6). Because the λmax for the PSB under denaturing conditions is 440 nm, the chromophore for all-trans-retinal-constituted pigment reflects most likely the presence of a PSB linkage. The presence of the PSB was confirmed by acidification of the sample that resulted in the formation of the 440-nm characteristic absorption (data not shown). RP mutations in rhodopsin have been shown to affect correct folding of the receptor resulting in impaired 11-cis-retinal binding (6Liu X. Garriga P. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4554-4559Google Scholar, 7Garriga P. Liu X. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4560-4564Google Scholar, 8Hwa J. Garriga P. Liu X. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10571-10576Google Scholar). This misfolding would be caused by structural uncoupling between the packing of the helices and the formation of the tertiary structure in the intradiscal domain of the protein (8Hwa J. Garriga P. Liu X. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10571-10576Google Scholar). Rhodopsin mutations associated with CNB have been proposed to act by a constitutive activity mechanism involving disruption of the electrostatic salt bridge between Glu-113 and the PSB (9Rao V.K. Cohen G.B. Oprian D.D. Nature. 1994; 367: 639-642Google Scholar, 11Rao V.R. Oprian D.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1996; 25: 287-314Google Scholar). In contrast, it has been shown that constitutive activity is not the cause of photoreceptor degeneration in transgenic mice carrying RP mutations (20Li T. Franson W.K. Gordon J.W. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3551-3555Google Scholar). An alternative mechanism, involving thermal instability of the mutant rhodopsins, has also been proposed for CNB mutations, like G90D (12Sieving P.A. Richards J.E. Naarendorp F. Bingham E.L. Scott K. Alpern M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 880-884Google Scholar, 13Sieving P.A. Fowler M.L. Bush R.A. Machida S. Calvert P.D. Green D.G. Makino C.L. McHenry C.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5449-5460Google Scholar). Thus, different molecular mechanisms underlying RP and CNB have been outlined previously (34Garriga P. Manyosa J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 528: 17-22Google Scholar). We wanted to provide new insights into the differences between the molecular mechanisms of RP and CNB by studying the phenotypic features of the recently found T94I mutant associated with CNB, and comparing them with those observed for other CNB and RP mutants reported previously (6Liu X. Garriga P. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4554-4559Google Scholar, 7Garriga P. Liu X. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4560-4564Google Scholar, 8Hwa J.

Bingham E.L. Scott K. Alpern M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 880-884Google Scholar, 13Sieving P.A. Fowler M.L. Bush R.A. Machida S. Calvert P.D. Green D.G. Makino C.L. McHenry C.L. J.

The T94I mutant protein could be eluted at low salt conditions indicating that the protein is folded and forms the retinal binding pocket. However, in the case of T94S, a small amount of misfolded protein could be eluted at high salt conditions indicating the presence of some misfolded opsin. T94K was mostly misfolded because most of the protein was eluted at high salt conditions, and only a very small amount could be eluted at low salt conditions. The mutants that formed chromophore showed blue-shifted λmax in the visible region. The observed blue shifts in the λmax in the visible absorption bands, particularly for T94I, involving a change from a polar to a hydrophobic side chain, indicate that Thr-94 in rhodopsin is located in proximity to the retinal binding pocket. The results obtained indicate that the dark state conformation of the T94I mutant must be significantly different from that of wild type rhodopsin. This conclusion can be reached from the following results. (i) This purified mutant protein showed reduced thermal stability in the dark, and even at the moderate temperature of 37 °C the decay of the chromophoric band was greatly accelerated compared with that of the wild type rhodopsin (mutant T94I samples stored at 4 °C also decayed in several weeks). In contrast, T94S mutant shows the same stability as wild type rhodopsin. (ii) T94I mutant protein shows reactivity toward hydroxylamine in the dark. This may be interpreted as an increase in the accessibility of the PSB by the reagent, reflecting structural alterations in the PSB environment and in the intradiscal domain, in the dark state. (iii) T94I mutant is able to regenerate chromophore with all-trans-retinal to give a PSB. A different behavior can be observed for the mutants upon illumination. T94I and T94S showed the same photobleaching behavior than wild type, whereas T94D showed a very abnormal photobleaching pattern. Both T94I and T94S showed the formation of the 380-nm Meta II conformation. T94D showed the formation of a MetaI-like photoproduct at 480 nm that is stable at 20 °C for at least 1 h. This result is in contrast with those found for other mutants, like the RP G89D mutant (8Hwa J. Garriga P. Liu X. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10571-10576Google Scholar) and the CNB G90D mutant, which showed also an altered photobleaching (with formation of the of the MetaI-like species), but the resulting species did decay in the dark in 1 h in these latter cases (even at 15 °C in the case of G90D (9Rao V.K. Cohen G.B. Oprian D.D. Nature. 1994; 367: 639-642Google Scholar)). Thus, mutations involving the introduction of an Asp residue in the transmembrane domain show an altered photobleaching pattern, but the T94D mutation here described is different in the very slow decay of the species formed after bleaching. The T94I mutant can regenerate chromophore with all-trans-retinal to form a PSB linkage in the dark. Several mutant rhodopsins have been described previously that can bind all-trans-retinal to form stable complexes. Among them, E113Q, involving mutation at the site of the counterion to the PSB which alters the pK a of the PSB, was found to be able to bind all-trans-retinal to form a 380 nm absorbing species (21Sakmar T.P. Franke R.R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8309-8313Google Scholar). More recently, mutations at position 257, M257A for example, have been shown to bind all-trans-retinal to form a covalent complex that could be purified in detergent solution (22Han M. Sakmar T.P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 251-269Google Scholar). The ability to bind all-trans-retinal has been correlated to the constitutive activity of the Met-257 mutants in the opsin state (23Han M. Smith S.O. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8253-8261Google Scholar). However, in all these previously reported cases, all-trans-retinal-bound forms of the mutants had absorbance maxima at 380 nm reflecting the presence of an unprotonated Schiff base linkage. In our case, the all-trans-retinal-bound mutant conformation resulting from photobleaching of the T94I (originally regenerated with 11-cis-retinal) mutant must be different from the all-trans-retinal form obtained from regenerating the mutant T94I opsin with all-trans-retinal, because both conformations show very different spectra, with the former showing an absorption band at 380 nm and the latter at 466 nm. It is interesting to note that a different binding site for all-trans and 11-cis conformations of retinal in rhodopsin has been proposed (24Jager S. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2908-2910Google Scholar). Thus, Thr-94 could be related to the all-trans-retinal-binding site proposed. Although T94S and T94I showed the same photobleaching behavior, the stability of the MetaII conformation formed was dramatically different. Whereas T94S showed a 2-fold faster decay than wild type rhodopsin (Table I), T94I showed a dramatically slower MetaII decay, this being 6.5-fold slower than that of the wild type. T94D also showed a slower decay than wild type rhodopsin. An electrostatic switch at Glu-113, in addition to the steric switch provided by photoisomerization, has been proposed as a critical determinant of rhodopsin activation (25Fahmy K. Siebert F. Sakmar T.P. Biophys. Chem. 1995; 56: 171-181Google Scholar). Our results suggest that Thr-94 may be part of this electrostatic switch between the active and inactive conformations of rhodopsin. Molecular models place Thr-94 close to the Glu-113 counterion (26Pogozheva I.D. Lomize A.L. Mosberg H.I. Biophys. J. 1997; 70: 1963-1985Google Scholar) and to the water molecule proposed to be in the vicinity of the PSB (27Deng H. Huang L. Callender R. Ebrey T. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1129-1136Google Scholar, 28Nagata T. Terakita A. Kandori H. Kojima D. Shichida Y. Maeda A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6164-6170Google Scholar, 29Nagata T. Terakita A. Kandori H. Shichida Y. Maeda A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17216-17222Google Scholar, 30Eilers M. Reeves P.J. Ying W. Khorana H.G. Smith S.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 487-492Google Scholar). More importantly, the OH group of Thr-94 has been located within 3.4 Å of one of the oxygen atoms of the Glu-113 counterion in the recently published crystal structure of rhodopsin (31Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Trong I.L. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Google Scholar, 32Teller D.C. Okada T. Behnke C.A. Palczewski K. Stenkamp E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7761-7772Google Scholar). A water molecule is also proposed to be in the vicinity of Thr-94 in the crystal structure (33Okada T. Fujiyoshi Y. Silow M. Navarro J. Landau E.M. Shichida Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5982-5987Google Scholar). Our results would be compatible with the structural effect of Thr-94 being exerted by forming a hydrogen bond with this water molecule or by direct interaction with Glu-113 (34Garriga P. Manyosa J.

A structural model (based on recent crystal structure data) of the different amino acid substitutions studied is depicted in Fig. 7, showing the location of Thr-94 and providing the structural basis for the results obtained. The structural model for wild type rhodopsin shows close proximity of Thr-94 to the PSB at 296 and to 11-cis-retinal (Fig. 7 A). In the case of the mutant T94I, the hydrophobic side chain of Ile at position 94 is seen close to Glu-113 (Fig. 7 B). Substitution of the polar Thr by the hydrophobic Ile would plausibly explain the marked blue shift in the λmax of T94I relative to wild type rhodopsin, as well as the stability and conformational specific properties of this mutant when compared with wild type rhodopsin. The T94K mutant shows the ε-amino group of Lys-94 extending to Lys-296 (site of the PSB) with steric and electrostatic effects (Fig. 7 C) that would explain the extensive misfolding observed for the mutant protein. The model for the mutant T94D shows close proximity of a carboxyl oxygen of Asp with the oxygen of the Glu-113 counterion (Fig. 7 D). This proximity would cause a change in the electrostatic interactions network around the PSB and would account for the observed effects on the spectral and bleaching properties of this mutant rhodopsin. It is also interesting to note that a similar mutation to the T94I studied, T90A, has been recently shown to affect the properties of bacteriorhodopsin by affecting the Schiff base environment of this bacterial rhodopsin (35Perálvarez A. Barnadas R. Sabés M. Querol E. Padrós E. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 399-402Google Scholar). From the reported results, taken together with those reported previously for G90D (9Rao V.K. Cohen G.B. Oprian D.D. Nature. 1994; 367: 639-642Google Scholar) and A292E (10Dryja T.P. Berson E.L. Rao V.R. Oprian D.D. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 280-283Google Scholar), it was foreseen that T94I mutant could be also constitutively active. In fact constitutive activity of the T94I mutant has been recently observed. 2Gross, A., Rao, V., and Oprian, D. (2003)Biochemistry, in press. These results indicate that mutations at the same site can cause either constitutive activity (T94I) or misfolding (T94K). These point mutations in the transmembrane domain can affect the coupling between the packing of the transmembrane domain and the formation of either the structure in the cytoplasmic domain or that in the intradiscal domain. RP mutations like V87D and G89D (6Liu X. Garriga P. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4554-4559Google Scholar, 7Garriga P. Liu X. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2001; 98: 4872-4876Google Scholar). The RP mutations V87D and G89D are located in helical-helical interacting regions. In contrast, T94I and other CNB mutants like G90D are located in the vicinity of the retinal Schiff base and cause structural instability of the dark state of the mutant proteins. This decrease in stability may be relevant to a proposed molecular mechanism for CNB (13Sieving P.A. Fowler M.L. Bush R.A. Machida S. Calvert P.D. Green D.G. Makino C.L. McHenry C.L. J.

Here we report the characterization of a new mammalian PAK3 mRNA that contains a 45-bp alternatively spliced exon. This exon encodes for 15 amino acids that are inserted in the regulatory domain, inside the autoinhibitory domain but outside the Cdc42 and Rac interactive binding domain. The transcript of the 68-kDa new isoform named PAK3b is expressed in various areas of the adult mouse brain. In contrast to PAK3 without the exon b (PAK3a), whose basal kinase activity is weak in resting cells, PAK3b displays a high kinase activity in starved cells that is not further stimulated by active GTPases. Indeed, we demonstrate that the autoinhibitory domain of PAK3b no longer inhibits the kinase activity of PAK3. Moreover, we show that the 15-amino acid insertion within the autoinhibitory domain impedes the ability of PAK3b to bind to the GTPases Rac and Cdc42 and changes its specificity toward the GTPases. Altogether, our results show that the new PAK3b isoform has unique properties and would signal differently from PAK3a in neurons. p21-activated kinases (PAK) are involved in the control of cytoskeleton dynamics and cell cycle progression.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Mammalian PAKs of subgroup I (PAK1/α, PAK2/γ, and PAK3/β) share another feature, which is an autoinhibitory domain (AID) partially overlapping the CRIB domain (2Jaffer Z.M. Chernoff J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 713-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar,16Frost J.A. Khokhlatchev A. Stippec S. White M.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

Parrini M.C. Eck M.J. Mayer B.J. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Intermolecular interactions were shown to occur between the conserved AID and the catalytic domain of two different kinase monomers, resulting in inactive PAK dimers under resting conditions (18Lei M., Lu, W. Meng W. Parrini M.C. Eck M.J. Mayer B.J. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 19Parrini M.C. Lei M. Harrison S.C. Mayer B.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The main mechanism of PAK catalytic activation results from their interaction with the GTP-bound form of the GTPases Rac and Cdc42 (1Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). GTPase binding to the PAK CRIB domain induces a conformational change of the inhibitory switch in the AID, which interrupts the interaction between the AID and the catalytic domain and leads to monomeric PAK in an opened conformation (18Lei M., Lu, W. Meng W. Parrini M.C. Eck M.J. Mayer B.J. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation at several sites in both the regulatory domain and in the kinase domain then occurs and maintains the open conformation, allowing kinase activation (20Buchwald G. Hostinova E. Rudolph M.G. Kraemer A. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Scheffzek K. Wittinghofer A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5179-5189Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, membrane recruitment of PAK is also required for its activation (21Lu W. Katz S. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and to date several potential mechanisms have been described. Indeed, under resting conditions, PAK1 to -3 interact with the Nck adapter that upon activation links tyrosine kinase receptors and brings PAK to the membrane (for a review, see Ref. 22Li W. Fan J. Woodley D.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6403-6417Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, PAKs also form stable complexes with the guanine exchange factors for Rac and Cdc42 of the PIX/Cool family, and these interactions are not only closely involved in targeting PAK to the membrane but also in regulating its kinase activity (23Daniels R.H. Bokoch G.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 24Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Jordon K.A. Van Aelst L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Despite sharing high sequence identity, PAK1, -2, and -3 differ in pattern of expression. Indeed, PAK2 is ubiquitously expressed and is activated by proteolytic cleavage during apoptosis and plays a cytostatic role (26Roig J. Traugh J.A. Vitam. Horm. 2001; 62: 167-198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, PAK1 and PAK3 are restrained to the nervous system (27Knaus U.G. Bokoch G.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and are regulated at the time of the growth cone guidance (10Shamah S.M. Lin M.Z. Goldberg J.L. Estrach S. Sahin M., Hu, L. Bazalakova M. Neve R.L. Corfas G. Debant A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 2001; 105: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). But to date, no specific functions were attributed to either neuronal PAK1 or PAK3. Here we report the first characterization of a splice variant of the mouse PAK3 gene we isolated from brain mRNA. This new cDNA contains an alternatively spliced exon (exon b) of 45 bp that is totally conserved in humans. The 15 amino acids encoded by this exon are located in the regulatory domain, inside the inhibitory switch. This PAK3b isoform is abundant in the brain and possesses high basal kinase activity that is not further activated by active Cdc42 proteins. Moreover, the alternatively spliced exon b inhibits interactions with active GTPases Rac and Cdc42. Our results strongly indicate that PAK3b may act through original pathways designed for specific functions in neuronal signaling. An RT-PCR-based approach was used to isolate cDNAs encoding PAK3 isoforms from adult mouse brain mRNA. Based on published mouse PAK3 coding sequence (15Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 28Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22731-22737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), a set of two primers containing engineered BamHI andXbaI restriction sites (underlined) was designed to amplify the open reading frames of mouse PAK3 (primer set 1: 5′-CCGGATCCAGGATCTGACAGCTTGGATAACG-3′ and 5′-GGCTCTAGACTAACGGCTACTGTTCTTAATTGC-3′). A high fidelity Pfu polymerase (Promega) was used for the amplification, and the PCR products were cloned into TOPO 2.1 vector (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions and sequenced. The isoform without insertion was named PAK3a, and the isoform containing the insert was named PAK3b. The accession numbers for the mouse PAK3a and PAK3b are AJ496262 and AJ496263, respectively. The amino acid numbering of PAK3 used in this article corresponds to the coding sequence of mammalian PAK3 protein. The BamHI/XbaI fragments of the PAK3a and PAK3b cDNAs were cloned into the pcDNA3 vector in order to obtain HA-tagged PAK3 expression plasmids named pHA-PAK3a and pHA-PAK3b, respectively. Mutants and constructs were prepared from pHA-PAK3a and pHA-PAK3b plasmids with Pfupolymerase, using procedures based upon the QuickChange protocol (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing. In order to obtain a constitutive activation of the kinase, the oligonucleotide set (5′-CCTGAGCAAAGTAAACGAAGCGAGATGGTGGGAACTCCCTAT-3′ and 5′-CCAATAGGGAGTTCCCACCATCTCGCTTCGTTTACTTTGCTC-3′) was used for site-directed mutagenesis of the threonine residue 421 to a glutamate residue, as initially described (29Manser E.

In order to obtain dead kinase mutants, the oligonucleotide set (5′-CTGGACAAGAGGTGGCCATACTGCAGATGAACCTTCAACAGCAGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCTGCTGTTGAAGGTTCATCTGCAGTATGGCCACCTCTTGTCCAG-3′) was used to change the lysine residue 297 to leucine, located in the putative ATP binding site of the kinase domain of PAK3. The constitutively active mutant was named pHA-PAK3a-ca, and kinase-dead mutants were named pHA-PAK3a-kd and pHA-PAK3b-kd. The PBD domains of PAK3 (amino acids Lys65–Lys136) (28Bagrodia S.

TheBamHI/XhoI fragments were digested and subcloned into pGEX-6P vector (Amersham Biosciences), leading to pGST-PBD-PAK3a and pGST-PBD-PAK3b constructs. The AIDs of PAK3 isoforms (amino acids His78–Ser146) (17Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Chen X.Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were amplified with the oligonucleotide set (5′-GCGGATCCCATACGATTCATGTGGGT-3′ and 5′-GCCTCGAGTTAACTTTTATCTCCTGACGT-3′). Fragments wereBamHI/XhoI subcloned into pGEX-6P (AmershamBiosciences), leading to pGST-AID-PAK3a and pGST-AID-PAK3b constructs. The vector pEGFP-C3 was purchased from Clontech. Plasmids expressing GFP-fused active GTPases (RhoAG14V, RifQ77L, RhoGG12V, Rac1G12V, Cdc42G12V, TC10Q75L, TCLQ79L, and ChpQ89L) were a generous gift from P. Fort (CNRS, CRBM, Montpellier). The GST-Rac1wt, GST-Cdc42wt, and GST-Cdc42V12 prokaryotic expression plasmids were previously described (3Faure S. Vigneron S. Doree M. Morin N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5550-5561Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). RNAs from human brain or from adult mouse tissues were prepared and reverse transcribed as previously described (31Barnier J.V. Papin C. Eychene A. Lecoq O. Calothy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23381-23389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Expression of the new PAK3b isoform was characterized from mouse or human brain cDNA using an exon b-specific sense primer and a species-specific reverse primer, leading to a mouse set (primer set 2: 5′-CCAGATCTCTATGGCTCACAG-3′ and 5′-GGAGGAGCCAAAGGAGGTTC-3′) or a human set (primer set 3: 5′-CCAGATCTCTATGGCTCACAG-3′ and 5′-GGAGGGGCCAATGGAGGC-3′), giving rise to a 275-bp fragment. A mouse multiple tissue cDNA panel was used to analyze the expression of PAK3 isoforms by using the exon b-specific primer set 2 as mentioned above and the mouse PAK3 isoform primer set 4 (5′-TGAGCAATGGGCACGACTAC-3′ and 5′-CTTGGTGCAATGACAGGCGG-3′), giving rise to a 297-bp fragment. To confirm successful reverse transcription and to normalize the samples, a 500-bp fragment of β-actin was amplified in parallel using primer set 5 (5′-CCAACCGTGAAAAGATGACC-3′ and 5′-AATTGAATGTAGTTTCATGGATG-3′). The PCR products were separated on agarose gel and analyzed after ethidium bromide staining. GST-PBD-PAK3a, GST-PBD-PAK3b, GST-AID-PAK3a, GST-AID-PAK3b, GST-Rac1wt, GST-Cdc42wt, and GST-Cdc42V12 recombinant proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli and purified on glutathione-agarose beads as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies to HA (12CA5) and to GFP were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The anti-PAK3-N19 antibody (N19) directed against the 19 N-terminal amino acids was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and the anti-phospho-PAK1 (Thr423), which also recognizes the phospho-Thr421 of PAK3, was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. A rabbit polyclonal antiserum was raised against the exon b-encoded synthetic peptide PDLYGSQMCPGKLPE conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Sigma). Antibodies were affinity-purified by Ultralink column chromatography (Pierce) after covalent attachment of the corresponding peptide, following the manufacturer's instructions. For Western blot analysis, protein samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Immunodetection was performed using the SuperSignal chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce). Quantification of chemiluminescence was performed after acquisition with a CDD camera (SynGene) and quantification software (GeneSnap and GeneTools; SynGene). COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA (10 μg) was transfected into 3 × 106 COS-7 cells using the electroporation method with an electroporator (Bio-Rad). Transfected cells were lysed as previously described (31Barnier J.V. Papin C. Eychene A. Lecoq O. Calothy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23381-23389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In some experiments, in order to activate the kinase, cleared cell extracts from PAK3-transfected cells were incubated with 5 μg of recombinant Cdc42V12 in the presence of 25 μm ATP during 30 min at room temperature. Extracts were then immunoprecipitated by incubating with 4 μl of 12CA5 anti-HA antibody plus 40 μl of Pansorbin (Calbiochem) for 3 h at 4 °C. After washing, aliquots of immunocomplexes were subjected to immunoblotting to ensure that PAK proteins were correctly expressed and immunoprecipitated. For kinase reactions, immunoprecipitates were washed once more time in the kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mmMgCl2, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm orthovanadate). Immunoprecipitates were then incubated in the kinase buffer containing 20 μm ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) for 20 min at 30 °C, in the absence or in the presence of H2B (3 μg; Sigma) or MBP (3 μg; Invitrogen) as a substrate. Boiling in SDS-Laemmli sample buffer stopped the reaction, and the products were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The incorporation of32P was quantified using a PhosphorImager (AmershamBiosciences). For the kinase activity inhibition by AID, immunoprecipitated HA-PAK3a protein was incubated with increasing concentrations of GST-AID-PAK3 proteins in the presence of Cdc42V12 and ATP for 30 min at 30 °C before performing a kinase assay as previously described (17Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Chen X.Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The overlay assay was done as previously described by Faure et al. (3Faure S. Vigneron S. Doree M. Morin N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5550-5561Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μg of purified recombinant GST alone or in fusion with PBD-PAK3a or PBD-PAK3b was loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the overlay assay was performed using recombinant purified wild-type GST-Cdc42wt or GST-Rac1wt loaded with [γ-35S]GTP (3Faure S. Vigneron S. Doree M. Morin N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5550-5561Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For overlay assays with full-length PAK3 proteins, the same procedure was used from HA-PAK3 plasmid-expressing COS-7 cells. Briefly, COS-7 cells were transfected with pHA-PAK3a, pHA-PAK3b, or mutants. The amount of PAK3 protein in the immune complexes was first determined by Western blotting on an aliquot. Samples containing equal amounts of PAK3 proteins were used for the overlay assay as described before. Quantification of the binding of [35S]GTPases was done using a PhosphorImager. Pull-down assays were performed as described by Vignal et al. (32Vignal E., De Toledo M. Comunale F. Ladopoulou A. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Blangy A. Fort P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36457-36464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-7 cells were transfected with constructs expressing GFP alone or fused to the constitutive active mutants of GTPases of the Rho/Rac/Cdc42 family. 30 h later, cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and protein inhibitor mixture. After 15 min on ice, lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min. Cleared cell extracts were incubated with 20 μg of GST, GST-PBD-PAK3a, or GST-PBD-PAK3b recombinant proteins, immobilized on glutathione beads, for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed with the lysis buffer, and precipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting, using the anti-GFP antibody. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed as described by Reeder et al. (33Reeder M.K. Serebriiskii I.G. Golemis E.A. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40606-40613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-7 cells were transfected with 5 μg of active GFP-tagged Rac or Cdc42 along with 5 μg of HA-tagged PAK3a and PAK3b constructs. Cell lysates in Robert's lysis buffer were immunoprecipitated overnight with anti-HA antibodies (anti-HA affinity matrix; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Immune complexes were separated by electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes before Western blotting analysis with anti-PAK3 N19 antibodies to detect PAK3 isoforms or with anti-GFP antibodies to detect co-precipitated Cdc42 or Rac1 proteins. In order to clone mouse PAK3 cDNA, we performed RT-PCRs on mouse brain mRNAs and subcloned and sequenced the PCR-amplified products. The sequence of the mouse gene we isolated (accession number AJ496262) is slightly different from published sequences (accession numbers U39738 andAF082297) (15Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22731-22737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The main difference resides in Leu to Phe amino acid substitution at position 271. A Phe residue is present as well in the homologous position in human (AF068864) and rat (U33314) (34Allen K.M. Gleeson J.G. Shoup S.M. Walsh C.A. Genomics. 1998; 52: 214-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 35Manser E. Chong C. Zhao Z.S. Leung T. Michael G. Hall C. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25070-25078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). But most importantly, we found that some of the clones contained an additional in-frame 45-bp sequence (Fig. 1 A). Sequence of several clones generated by independent RT-PCR confirmed the presence of this insert in certain PAK3 mRNA. Moreover, this sequence was identified in several mouse expressed sequence tags (BE952172, AU08080098,BB621877, and BE952177) (36Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). The isoform without insertion was named PAK3a, and the isoform containing the insert was named PAK3b (accession number AJ496263). Using the same approach, we then searched for this insert in different mammalian species. To do so, human and mouse brain RNAs were reverse transcribed and amplified using a specific forward primer for the 45-bp insert and reverse species-specific primers, both designed to amplify a 275-bp fragment. The size of the DNA fragment that we amplified in both species is in agreement with a 45-bp insertion as shown in Fig. 1 B. An identical product was obtained from rat brain RNA (data not shown). Finally, a BLAST search conducted in human genomic data banks, using the 45-bp inserted sequence, demonstrated that this sequence is strictly identical to a sequence lying on chromosome X in position Xq22.3-q23 within the human PAK3 gene (34Allen K.M. Gleeson J.G. Shoup S.M. Walsh C.A. Genomics. 1998; 52: 214-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The sequence is located within the 5540-bp intron lying between exon 2 and exon 3 and is flanked by 4342 and 1172 base pairs of intronic sequences at its 5′- and 3′-end, respectively. The flanking sequences of the 45-bp insert are in good agreement with the consensus for donor and acceptor splicing sites (37Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3298) Google Scholar). Altogether, these results demonstrate that the 45-bp insertion in mouse PAK3 cDNA defines a new alternatively spliced exon, henceforth referred to as exon b. We further show that this alternatively spliced exon of PAK3 is strictly conserved in different mammalian species. Exon b translation leads to a 15-amino acid in-frame addition that has no significant identity with any sequence in the currently available databases. Alignment of PAK3a, the previously characterized PAK3 isoform without an alternatively spliced exon, with the different PAK3b sequences in the region surrounding exon b is shown in Fig. 1 A. In order to specifically identify PAK3 isoforms, we developed antibodies (IS-Eb) directed against the peptide encoded by the alternatively spliced exon b. To ensure the specificity of IS-Eb antibodies, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with pHA-PAK3a (Fig. 2 A, lane 2) and pHA-PAK3b (Fig. 2 A, lane 3) constructs. Transfected cells were lysed 24 h later and further analyzed in Western blots. In pHA-PAK3b transfected cells, affinity-purified IS-Eb recognized a single 70-kDa protein but failed to detect any band in pHA-PAK3a-transfected COS cells (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, the N19-PAK3 polyclonal serum (as well as anti-HA monoclonal antibodies; data not shown) recognized 67- and 70-kDa proteins in pHA-PAK3a- and pHA-PAK3b-transfected cells, respectively (Fig. 2 A). Indeed, these controls demonstrate that IS-Eb antibodies are specific of the PAK3b isoform. Next, to detect and identify PAK3 endogenous isoforms in adult mouse brain, we performed immunoprecipitation of PAK3 proteins from brain lysate using the N19-PAK3 serum that reacts with both isoforms. Immunoprecipitates were further analyzed by Western blot and probed with both N19 and IS-Eb sera. Two 65- and 68-kDa protein species were recognized with N19 antibodies, whereas the IS-Eb serum detected a unique 68-kDa species (Fig. 2 B). Thus, the latter 68-kDa/PAK3b species is expressed in adult mouse brain at a significant and slightly lower level than PAK3a. In summary, our results show that two different PAK3 isoforms, namely PAK3a and PAK3b, are expressed in adult mouse brain. These results raised the question of whether the two PAK3 gene products PAK3a and PAK3b may display a narrow and distinct tissue specificity. To address this question, we studied the expression profile of mouse PAK3b by semiquantitative RT-PCR in various adult tissues. Because PAK3 expression is known to be restricted to brain and, at a lower level, testis (35Manser E. Chong C. Zhao Z.S. Leung T. Michael G. Hall C. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25070-25078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), we investigated PAK3 RNA expression in different adult mouse tissues as well as in different regions of the brain. First, equal amounts of first strand cDNA were analyzed after normalization using β-actin (Fig. 3 C). Then the tissue distribution of both PAK3 mRNAs was investigated by RT-PCR amplification of the carboxyl-terminal part of the regulatory domain, since this domain is not subject to alternative splicing. Our results demonstrate that PAK3 (a and b isoforms) RNAs are highly expressed in the different parts of the adult mouse brain, with a slightly higher expression in the spinal cord and in the midbrain. PAK3 is highly expressed in testis and to a lower extent in heart and muscles. No expression was detected in other tissues (Fig. 3 A). In parallel, the analysis of expression of the PAK3b isoform was performed using an exon b-specific forward primer as shown in Fig. 3 B. PAK3b expression was detected in the different parts of the brain and in the spinal cord, and, like PAK3a, PAK3b displays a slightly higher expression in midbrain and spinal cord. Nonetheless, PAK3b transcript distribution is narrower than PAK3a, since, unlike PAK3a, it is not detected in testis. Whereas PAK3b tissue distribution is not specific to any brain territory, it appears to be restricted to the brain in the adult mouse. Since the alternatively spliced exon b is located within the N-terminal regulatory domain of PAK3, we investigated whether its expression might interfere with the intrinsic kinase activity in an in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 4). To do so, COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmids coding for either wild type PAK3a (a) and PAK3b (b) isoforms or for their corresponding kinase-dead mutants that are mutated on their ATP binding site (a-kd and b-kd) or for a constitutively active mutant for PAK3a (a-ca) (see “Experimental Procedures”). 48 h after transfection, cell lysates were incubated with or without recombina"

Inositol 5-phosphatases participate in the regulation of these signaling molecules. We have identified four inositol 5-phosphatases inDictyostelium discoideum, Dd5P1–4, showing a high diversity in domain composition. Dd5P1 possesses only a inositol 5-phosphatase catalytic domain. An unique domain composition is present in Dd5P2 containing a RCC1-like domain. RCC1 has a seven-bladed propeller structure and interacts with G-proteins. Dd5P3 and Dd5P4 have a domain composition similar to human Synaptojanin with aSacI domain and OCRL with a RhoGAP domain, respectively. We have expressed the catalytic domains and show that these inositol 5-phosphatases have different substrate preferences. Single and double gene inactivation suggest a functional redundancy for Dd5P1, Dd5P2, and Dd5P3. Inactivation of the gene coding for Dd5P4 leads to defects in growth and development. These defects are restored by the expression of the complete protein but not by the 5-phosphatase catalytic domain.

Inositol phosphates play a role in a variety of eukaryotic cellular processes, including chemotaxis and membrane trafficking. They are regulated by a number of enzymes. The group of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K) 1The abbreviations used are: PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PI(3, 4)P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate; PI(4, 5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PI(3, 4,5)P3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; Ins(1, 4,5)P3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; Ins(1, 3,4,5)P4, inositol 1,4,5-tetrakisphosphate; SH2, Src homology 2; SHIP, SH2 domain-containing inositol 5′-phosphatase; INPP, inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase; PH, pleckstrin homology; GAP, GTPase-activating protein 1The abbreviations used are: PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PI(3, 4)P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate; PI(4, 5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PI(3, 4,5)P3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; Ins(1, 4,5)P3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; Ins(1, 3,4,5)P4, inositol 1,4,5-tetrakisphosphate; SH2, Src homology 2; SHIP, SH2 domain-containing inositol 5′-phosphatase; INPP, inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase; PH, pleckstrin homology; GAP, GTPase-activating protein phosphorylates the lipid substrates PI, PI(4)P, and PI(4,5)P2 at the 3-position of the inositol ring (1Cantrell D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1439-1445Google Scholar). The lipid product PI(3,4,5)P3 has been strongly implicated to be important in chemotaxis in neutrophils and fibroblasts (2Servant G. Weiner O.D. Herzmark P. Balla T. Sedat J.W. Bourne H.R. Science. 2000; 287: 1037-1040Google Scholar, 3Haugh J.M. Codazzi F. Teruel M. Meyer T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1269-1280Google Scholar). PTEN, identified as a tumor suppressor gene (4Li J. Yen C. Liaw D. Podsypanina K. Bose S. Wang S.I. Puc J. Miliaresis C. Rodgers L. McCombie R. Bigner S.H. Giovanella B.C. Ittmann M. Tycko B.

Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Google Scholar). Another group of enzymes, the inositol 5-phosphatases, can remove the phosphate group at the 5-position of the inositol ring (6Erneux C. Govaerts C. Communi D. Pesesse X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 185-199Google Scholar, 7Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 427-431Google Scholar, 8Majerus P.W. Kisseleva M.V. Norris F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10669-10672Google Scholar). The importance of inositol 5-phosphatase activity in PI(3,4,5)P3 regulation is demonstrated by SHIP1. In stimulated B-cells, SHIP1 accounts for the major phosphatase activity toward PI(3,4,5)P3, and inactivation of SHIP1 leads to an increased and prolonged PI(3,4,5)P3 production (9Brauweiler A. Tamir I. Dal Porto J. Benschop R.J. Helgason C.D. Humphries R.K. Freed J.H. Cambier J.C. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1545-1554Google Scholar). Other inositol 5-phosphatases have been shown to play important roles in a number of cellular processes. Mutations in the inositol 5-phosphatase OCRL are responsible for Lowe syndrome in human (10Attree O. Olivos I.M. Okabe I. Bailey L.C. Nelson D.L. Lewis R.A. McInnes R.R. Nussbaum R.L. Nature. 1992; 358: 239-242Google Scholar), and deletion of the presynaptic inositol 5-phosphatase Synaptojanin leads to neurological abnormalities and early death of mice (11Cremona O. Di Paolo G. Wenk M.R. Luthi A. Kim W.T. Takei K. Daniell L. Nemoto Y. Shears S.B. Flavell R.A. McCormick D.A. De Camilli P. Cell. 1999; 99: 179-188Google Scholar). In the social amoeba, Dictyostelium discoideum chemotaxis toward folic acid and cAMP is an essential strategy for survival (12Parent C.A. Devreotes P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 411-440Google Scholar). Several observations suggest that phosphatidylinositol phosphates mediate chemotaxis and, in particular, the localization of the signal inside D. discoideum cells. The PH domains of a number of proteins involved in chemotaxis, including CRAC, Akt/PKB, and PhdA, have been shown to transiently localize at the leading edge of cells moving in a chemotactic gradient (13Parent C.A. Blacklock B.J. Froehlich W.M. Murphy D.B. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1998; 95: 81-91Google Scholar, 14Meili R. Ellsworth C. Lee S. Reddy T.B. Ma H. Firtel R.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2092-2105Google Scholar, 15Funamoto S. Milan K. Meili R. Firtel R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 795-810Google Scholar). As these PH domains bind to PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2, an asymmetric lipid distribution is implicated by these observations. Inpi3k1/2-null cells, a strain with two putative PI3Ks inactivated (16Zhou K. Takegawa K. Emr S.D. Firtel R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5645-5656Google Scholar), the transient localization of PhdA can no longer be observed and cells show reduced chemotaxis (15Funamoto S. Milan K. Meili R. Firtel R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 795-810Google Scholar). On the other hand, in PTEN-null cells, a strain in which a putative 3-phosphatase is inactivated, the localization of PH-domains is prolonged and broadened and chemotaxis is also reduced (17Iijima M. Devreotes P. Cell. 2002; 109: 599-610Google Scholar, 18Funamoto S. Meili R. Lee S. Parry L. Firtel R.A. Cell. 2002; 109: 611-623Google Scholar). Inositol 5-phosphatases may play an important role in the regulation of the phosphoinositides. As this group of enzymes leads to the degradation of PI(3,4,5)P3 and at the same time formation of PI(3,4)P2, another PH-binding molecule, they can be central players in the metabolic route of these signaling molecules. Phosphoinositides have also been implicated in endocytosis in D. discoideum. Pi3k1/2-null cells are affected with respect to pinocytosis (19Buczynski G. Grove B. Nomura A. Kleve M. Bush J. Firtel R.A. Cardelli J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1271-1286Google Scholar), suggesting a role for PI(3,4,5)P3 in this process. The inhibitors of phospholipase C, an enzyme converting PI(4,5)P2 into Ins(1,4,5)P3 and diacylglycerol, reduce the rate of phagocytosis (20Peracino B. Borleis J. Jin T. Westphal M. Schwartz J.M. Wu L. Bracco E. Gerisch G. Devreotes P. Bozzaro S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1529-1537Google Scholar, 21Seastone D.J. Zhang L. Buczynski G. Rebstein P. Weeks G. Spiegelman G. Cardelli J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 393-406Google Scholar). Because inositol 5-phosphatases can act on PI(4,5)P2, PI(3,4,5)P3, and Ins(1,4,5)P3, they are probably important in the endocytotic pathway. To investigate the role of inositol 5-phosphatases in chemotaxis and endocytosis, we cloned and characterized four D. discoideum inositol 5-phosphatases. Catalytic activity was determined, indicating that they act as inositol 5-phosphatases. Single and double gene disruptants were obtained and growth, chemotaxis, and development were studied in these knock-out strains. The first putative inositol 5-phosphatase sequence was obtained using degenerated primers complementary to the conserved motifs I and II present in inositol 5-phosphatases (see “Results”), and the PCR product was used to screen a cDNA library kindly provided by Dr. R. A. Firtel. TheD. discoideum genomic (www.sdsc.edu/mpr/dicty) and cDNA databases (www.csm.biol.tsukuba.ac.jp) were screened for other putative inositol 5-phosphatases using either the conserved motif I or II. Using Seqman from Lasergene (DNAstar), contigs were formed. Additional sequences were obtained by screening a cDNA library, kindly provided by Dr. R. H. Gomer, with a PCR fragment containing part of the catalytic domain (used primers: Dd5P2: 5P2S1 + 5P2R1; Dd5P3: 5P5S1 + 5P5R1; and Dd5P4: 5P4S1 + 5P4R1, see “Appendix A”). The longest clones obtained for Dd5P3 (4212 bp) and Dd5P4 (2795 bp) encode the complete open reading frame of 1377 and 787 amino acids, respectively. For Dd5P2, the longest clone only encoded for the amino acids 1–599. In combination with data from the genomic data base, a complete open reading frame of 1794 amino acids was constructed. The longest clone obtained for Dd5P1 encodes for amino acids 118–678; the missing part of the 5′-open reading frame was obtained from the data base. A comparison of the sequence obtained from cDNA clones with the genomic data base sequences revealed the presence of one intron in each inositol 5-phosphatase gene (Dd5P1: nucleotides 397–499; Dd5P2: nucleotides 53–187; Dd5P3: nucleotides 241–384; and Dd5P4: nucleotides 1357–1622) (GenBankTM accession numbers AY184992, AY184993, AY184994, and AY184995, respectively). BLAST, Smart, Pfam, and Expasy programs were used to analyze the obtained sequences. Alignments are made using Megalign (Lasergene) and Genedoc followed by optimizing by eye. The D. discoideumstrains AX3 (wild type), DH1 (uracil auxotroph wild type), and the mutant strains described were grown in HG5 medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml blasticidin S or G418 when necessary. Selection for presence of the pyr5/6 cassette was obtained using the uracil-deficient FM medium. When grown in shaking culture, the cell density was kept below 6.106 cells/ml. Growth on bacterial lawns was studied using Klebsiella aerogens grown on 3 × LP plates (8.3 mmlactose, 2 mm KH2PO4, 2 mmNa2HPO4, 3 g/liter bactopeptone, 15 g/liter agar). To determine whether cells were capable to aggregate properly, they were put on non-nutrient agar plates (11 mm KH2PO4, 2.8 mm Na2HPO4, 15 g/liter agar) at three different cell densities (2 × 106, 4 × 105, and 8 × 104 cells/cm2). Chemotaxis toward cAMP was studied using the small-droplet chemotaxis assay (22Konijn T.M. Experientia. 1970; 26: 367-369Google Scholar). RNA was isolated from cells grown on plates or starved on non-nutrient plates for 3 or 6 h or from tight aggregates, slugs, or culminants using RNeasy Mini kit from Qiagen. Equal amounts of RNA (∼40 μg) were loaded on the gel. The probes used to screen the cDNA library were used for hybridization of inositol 5-phosphatase RNA. For Dd5P1, the PCR product of primer 6BIr + 6BIf was used. DNA was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the random primer method (High Prime, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Blots were incubated overnight at 65 °C in hybridization solution (0.5 mNaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 7.0, 7% SDS, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Stringency of the final washes was 0.1 mNaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 7.0, 1% SDS at 65 °C. Bands were visualized using a PhosphorImager. Gene inactivation was obtained by replacing part of the gene by the bsr orpyr5/6 cassette. The cassettes were inserted into NdeI/NsiI site of Dd5P1,NdeI/EcoRI (nucleotide 1210) site ofDd5P2, AccI (nucleotide 1648)/BglII site of Dd5P3, and NcoI (nucleotide 887)/NdeI site of Dd5P4. Orientation of the cassette was opposite to the orientation ofDd5P1(bsr and pyr),Dd5P2(bsr), and Dd5P3(bsr) and similar to the orientation of Dd5P2(pyr) andDd5P4(bsr and pyr). The place of insertion of the selection marker is indicated by an asterisk in Fig. 1. Single gene inactivation was performed with AX3 cells, whereas double gene inactivation was performed with DH1 cells. Potential knock-outs were screened by PCR and confirmed by Southern and/or Northern blots. As initiation from an internal ATG does not occur, at the most the N-terminal part of the protein will be expressed. A truncated RNA transcript could be observed for strains in whichDd5P2, Dd5P3, or Dd5P4 was inactivated. The size corresponded with the expected size for transcription of the first part of the gene. Therefore, the catalytic inositol 5-phosphatase domain is not transcribed and not expressed. The inositol 5-phosphatase catalytic domains were cloned into the BamHI site (Dd5P1, Dd5P2, and Dd5P4) orXhoI/PstI site (Dd5P3) of pRSETB (Invitrogen) using primers shown in “Appendix A” (Dd5P1: 1OES2 + 1OER1; Dd5P2: 2OES1 + 2OER1; Dd5P3: 5OES2 + 5OER2; and Dd5P4: 4OES1 + 4OER1). The catalytic domains were expressed in E. coli BL21DE3 (pLysS) (Novagen). The expression of the proteins was induced at 22 °C using 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a cell density of A 600 nm = 0.4–0.6 in 2× YT (16 g/liter Trypton peptone, 10 g/liter yeast extract, 0.09m NaCl). After 3–5 h of induction, 0.5–3.0 liters of cell culture were harvested, resuspended in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole), lysed with lysozyme (0.5 g/liter) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), and ultrasonificated. Soluble proteins were purified from supernatant by the binding of the His tag to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid and elution of the protein (binding buffer with 60, 100, 80, and 60 mm imidazole for Dd5P1, Dd5P2, Dd5P3, and Dd5P4, respectively). The purified inositol 5-phosphatase catalytic domains were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by immunostaining with Penta-His Antibody (Qiagen) and Anti-mouse IgG peroxidase conjugate (Sigma). Bands were visualized using chemiluminescence blotting substrate POD (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 1-min exposure to film. Prestained Protein Marker, Broad Range (New England Biolabs) was used to determine the size. To express proteins in D. discoideum, the desired DNA fragment was cloned into an extrachromosomal vector containing a neomycin cassette (pMB74 or pAH2). This results in expressing the protein from actin 15 promoter. To express the full-length Dd5P4 inDd5P4− cells, the obtained full-length cDNA clone was inserted into the BglII site of pMB74. To clone the inositol 5-phosphatase catalytic domain, the domain was excised from the pRSETB vector (see above) with BamHI andBglII and cloned into the BglII site of pAH2. The RhoGAP domain was obtained by PCR using primer OE4GAPs1 (see “Appendix A”) and the universal T7 primer with cDNA as template. The PCR product was digested withBamHI/XhoI and cloned into theBamHI/XhoI site of pRSETB. The insert was sequenced and cloned into the BglII site of pAH2. Activity toward Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 was determined as described previously (23Erneux C. Takazawa K. Verjans B. Methods Neurosci. 1994; 18: 312Google Scholar). 5 μl (diluted) of enzyme was added to the reaction mixture (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 48 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), containing either 100 μmIns(1,4,5)P3/[3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 or 10 μmIns(1,3,4,5)P4/[3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. After 15 min of incubation the reaction was stopped and the products were separated on Dowex columns. Activity toward PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 was determined as described previously (24Giuriato S.

Vesicles were formed by sonication, and 1 μl of 1 mMgCl2 and 60 μl of (diluted) enzyme were added. After 30 min, the reaction was stopped and the lipids were extracted. Lipids were separated by TLC and visualized by exposure to film or PhosphorImager. In the case of the PI(4,5)P2 assay, the spots were visualized using EN3Hance spray (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and scraped from the plates (Silica Gel 60, Merck) and radioactivity was measured. [32P]PI(3,4,5)P3 was prepared by making vesicles containing 50 μg of PI(4,5)P2 and 100 μg of phosphatidyl serine and incubation with PI3K (purified from baculovirus using an expression vector kindly provided by B. Vanhaesebroeck (25Vanhaesebroeck B. Stein R.C. Waterfield M.D. Cancer Surv. 1996; 27: 249-270Google Scholar)) and 70 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1.5 mmdithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP). After 30 min, the reaction was stopped and lipids were extracted. The first potential inositol 5-phosphatase inD. discoideum was identified by performing a PCR with degenerated primers. The obtained PCR product was used as probe for cDNA library screening. The gene found using this method was calledDd5P1 (D. discoideum 5-phosphatase 1) and codes for a protein of 678 amino acids (see “Appendix B”). To identify other putative inositol 5-phosphatases in D. discoideum, we searched the D. discoideum data base for sequences showing homology to the conserved motifs I and II, WXGDXN(Y/F)R and P(A/S)W(C/T)DR(I/V)L respectively, which are characteristic for inositol 5-phosphatases (6Erneux C. Govaerts C. Communi D. Pesesse X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 185-199Google Scholar). Using the partial sequence obtained from the data base, complete sequences were obtained from cDNA library screens. Three putative inositol 5-phosphatases were identified (see “Appendix B”), coding for proteins consisting of 1800, 1377, and 787 amino acids, respectively. A comparison of the sequence obtained from cDNA clones with the genomic data base sequences revealed the presence of one intron in each inositol 5-phosphatase gene. The position of the introns is indicated by a triangle in Fig.1. Alignment of the catalytic domain of the fourD. discoideum inositol 5-phosphatases with other inositol 5-phosphatase catalytic domains shows a high degree of identity between the amino acid sequence of the four proteins and type II inositol 5-phosphatases (Fig. 2) (see “Appendix C”). All of the four proteins contain the conserved amino acids present in motifs I and II that are important for inositol 5-phosphatase activity (26Communi D. Lecocq R. Erneux C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11676-11683Google Scholar, 27Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7890-7894Google Scholar, 28Tsujishita Y. Guo S. Stolz L.E. York J.D. Hurley J.H. Cell. 2001; 105: 379-389Google Scholar). Also, the amino acids strongly conserved in other regions of the inositol 5-phosphatase domains are present in all four D. discoideum inositol 5-phosphatases, suggesting that they are active inositol 5-phosphatases. The four inositol 5-phosphatases differ with respect to their domain composition (Fig. 1). Dd5P1 shows the least complex composition containing only the inositol 5-phosphatase domain. A BLAST analysis with the catalytic domain shows the highest score (Expect value = 2e−54) with the catalytic domain of human SHIP2 (30% identity, 44% similarity) (29Pesesse X. Deleu S. De Smedt F. Drayer L. Erneux C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 697-700Google Scholar). This score is clearly higher than scores for non-SHIP-like proteins with the highest score for inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase II of Mus musculus (Expect value = 7e−37). The homology with SHIP2 does not expand to the N-terminal part of the protein, because the SH2 domain present in SHIP2 is not present in Dd5P1. Besides the inositol 5-phosphatase domain, Dd5P2 contains a region homologous to RCC1 (“Appendix D”) (30Ohtsubo M. Kai R. Furuno N. Sekiguchi T. Sekiguchi M. Hayashida H. Kuma K. Miyata T. Fukushige S. Murotsu T. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 585-593Google Scholar). The structure of RCC1 has been solved, revealing a seven-bladed propeller with each blade comprising by four β-sheets (31Renault L. Nassar N. Vetter I. Becker J. Klebe C. Roth M. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1998; 392: 97-101Google Scholar). RCC1 is known to bind Ran, a small G-protein present at high concentrations in the nucleus. The binding of RCC1 to Ran leads to an increased rate of exchange of GDP for GTP, thus acting as a guanine exchange factor for Ran (32Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Nature. 1991; 354: 80-82Google Scholar). The highest BLAST score of the catalytic domain of Dd5P2 is shown with the catalytic domain of mouse inositolpolyphosphate 5-phosphataseb (INPP5b), a RhoGAP domain containing protein (41% identity, 59% similarity) (33Matzaris M. O'Malley C.J. Badger A. Speed C.J. Bird P.I. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8256-8267Google Scholar). The long C terminus of Dd5P2 (∼1000 amino acids) does not represent a known domain structure. Three poly(N) stretches and a poly(D/E) stretch are present in this C-terminal part of the protein. These kind of stretches are not unusual in D. discoideum proteins. The other two inositol 5-phosphatases identified in D. discoideum are homologous to human inositol 5-phosphatases. Dd5P3 resembles the synaptojanin-like proteins found in both human and yeast with the highest BLAST score of the catalytic domain with that of INP52p from fission yeast (37% identity, 59% similarity) (34Stolz L.E. Huynh C.V. Thorner J. York J.D. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1715-1729Google Scholar). Similar to human Synaptojanin and yeast INP52p, Dd5P3 has aSacI-like domain including the conserved RXNCXDCLDRTN motif (35Hughes W.E. Cooke F.T. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 337-352Google Scholar, 36Guo S. Stolz L.E. Lemrow S.M. York J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12990-12995Google Scholar) in front of the inositol 5-phosphatase domain (see “Appendix E”). The SacI domains of Synaptojanin and INP52p have been shown to remove the phosphate group of PI(4)P, PI(3)P, and at a low rate, both phosphates of PI(3,5)P2(36). The long C-terminal part of Dd5P3 does not have any homology with known domains and consists of poly(Q) and poly(N) repeats. Dd5P4 is homologous to human OCRL (10Attree O. Olivos I.M. Okabe I. Bailey L.C. Nelson D.L. Lewis R.A. McInnes R.R. Nussbaum R.L. Nature. 1992; 358: 239-242Google Scholar) and INPP5b (37Mitchell C.A. Connolly T.M. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8873-8877Google Scholar, 38Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9370-9377Google Scholar), consisting of a inositol 5-phosphatase domain followed by a RhoGAP domain (see “Appendix F”). The catalytic domain has the highest BLAST score with the catalytic domain of human INPP5b (44% identity, 60% similarity). RhoGAP domains are known to catalyze the GTPase activity of Rho proteins. The crystal structure of human RhoGAP has been solved indicating a role for two conserved amino acids, Arg-85p50RhoGAP and Asn-194p50RhoGAP, in GAP-activated GTP hydrolysis (39Rittinger K. Walker P.A. Eccleston J.F. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 758-762Google Scholar). The role of these amino acids is supported by mutational analysis (39Rittinger K. Walker P.A. Eccleston J.F. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 758-762Google Scholar, 40Graham D.L. Eccleston J.F. Lowe P.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 985-991Google Scholar, 41Harris T.W. Hartwieg E. Horvitz H.R. Jorgensen E.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 589-600Google Scholar). Mutational analysis has also shown that the conserved Arg is not predominantly involved in the binding of Rho proteins (40Graham D.L. Eccleston J.F. Lowe P.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 985-991Google Scholar). In Dd5P4, the Arg and the Asn are substituted by an Ile and Gln, respectively. This observation may suggest that Dd5P4 does not exhibit high RhoGAP activity, but may still bind Rho proteins. To determine the transcription levels of the D. discoideuminositol 5-phosphatases, Northern blot analysis was performed. Very low transcription levels were observed for the four inositol 5-phosphatases in all stages of the D. discoideum life cycle (Fig.3). Dd5P1 and Dd5P3were equally transcribed in all stages with the exception of the even lower transcription of Dd5P3 in the vegetative stage. The levels of transcription of Dd5P2 were higher during aggregation than during growth and multicellular development. The transcription of Dd5P4 was relatively high during growth, decreased during aggregation, and returned to almost vegetative levels in the multicellular stages. Furthermore, a smaller transcript of 2.5 kilobases was observed in the multicellular stages. To determine whether the four putative inositol 5-phosphatases identified in D. discoideum can function as inositol 5-phosphatases, the catalytic activity and specificity of the inositol 5-phosphatase domains were studied in vitro. The catalytic domains were expressed as His tag fusion proteins in E. coli and purified. The protein of the expected size could be detected by Western blot analysis for Dd5P1–3 (Fig. 4). The Western blot analysis performed for Dd5P4 showed a band at a higher position than expected (62 instead of 55 kDa), but the purified protein did show inositol 5-phosphatase activity. Unfortunately, because of the very low expression levels obtained for the catalytic domain of Dd5P1, no activity could be determined for this protein. The purified catalytic domains of Dd5P2, Dd5P3, and Dd5P4 were incubated with the phospholipids PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 and the water-soluble inositol phosphates Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. Substrate degradation was quantified using thin-layer chromatography for the phospholipids and ion-exchange chromatography for the water-soluble inositol phosphates. The results are summarized in Fig.5 demonstrating good degradation of PI(4,5)P2 by all inositol 5-phosphatases, whereas PI(3,4,5)P3 is degraded predominantly by Dd5P2 and also by Dd5P4 but not by Dd5P3. Good degradation of the water-soluble inositol phosphates Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 is observed for Dd5P2, Dd5P3, and Dd5P4, showing the best degradation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 by Dd5P3, whereas Ins(1,3,4,5)P4is best degraded by Dd5P2 (Fig. 5 C). Comparing the activity of the four enzymes for each substrate indicates the relatively preferred substrates (Table I). The protein with the highest activity toward Ins(1,4,5)P3 is the catalytic domain of Dd5P3. This protein, compared with the other proteins, is poor in dephosphorylation of lipid-soluble substrates. This substrate specificity is almost opposite to the specificity of the homologue INP51p, which degrades PI(4,5)P2 but does not hydrolyze Ins(1,4,5)P3. Dd5P2, in contrast, is a very good PI(3,4,5)P3- and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4-metabolizing enzyme.Table ISubstrate specificity of Dd5P1–4 towards different substratesEnzymesRelative activityIns(1,4,5) P3Ins(1,3,4,5) P4PI(4,5) P2PI(3,4,5) P3Dd5P1NDNDNDNDDd5P2++++++++++++Dd5P3++++++++/−Dd5P4++++Catalytic domains of Dd5P1–4 were expressed in E. coli,purified, and incubated with the four substrates.

The formed aggregate develops into a migrating slug or fruiting body. The spores of the fruiting body are resistant to severe conditions and maturate into single amoeba under better conditions. To get an indication of the function of inositol 5-phosphatases inD. discoideum, the four identified inositol 5-phosphatase genes have been knocked out. The effect of gene inactivation on chemotaxis has been investigated by determining the response of cells toward different cAMP concentrations using the small-droplet chemotaxis assay. Single gene inactivation of either Dd5P3 orDd5P4 or double gene inactivation of Dd5P2 andDd5P3 (Dd5P2/3−) did not negatively affect chemotaxis, whereas single disruption ofDd5P1 or Dd5P2 slightly improved chemotaxis (Fig.6). Also, the double disruption of eitherDd5P1 and Dd5P2(Dd5P1/2−) or Dd5P1 andDd5P3 (Dd5P1/3−) resulted in slightly improved chemotaxis. Growth and development of the cells were also studied. The single gene inactivation of Dd5P1,Dd5P2, or Dd5P3 did not result in any observable difference in growth rate in axenic medium or on bacterial lawns (data not shown). The single disruptants Dd5P1−,Dd5P2−, and Dd5P3− were deposited on non-nutrient agar plates or grown on bacterial lawns to study the development of the cells. Aggregation of the cells proceeded at a rate comparable to wild-type cells. Slug formation was also normal as well as the formation of fruiting bodies. The spores that were formed were viable (data not shown). Also,Dd5P1/2−,Dd5P1/3−, orDd5P2/3− cells showed no defect in growth or development. The single disruption of Dd5P4 did affect growth and development. The growth rate in axenic medium was significantly lower for Dd5P4 cells compared with wild-type AX3 cells (Fig.7). Whereas the doubling time of wild-type cells is ∼15 h in shaking culture, the doubling time of Dd5P4-deficient cells is 41 h. The growth rate on bacterial lawns was affected as well for Dd5P4− cells. Amoeba were deposited on a bacterial lawn and incubated at 22 °C. Approximately 90% wild-type amoeba formed visible plaques within 4 days, whereas <1% Dd5P4− cells formed visible plaques after 9 days. The development of the Dd5P4 cells when grown on bacterial lawns was affected as well. The inactivation of Dd5P4 lead to the formation of multiple-tipped aggregates (Fig. 8).Figure 8Development of wild-type AX3,Dd5P4 −, andDd5P4 −/Dd5P4 on K. aerogens. Pictures were taken of tipped aggregates using ×40 magnification.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The overexpression of the full-length Dd5P4 restored the defects ofDd5P4− cells in growth and development, confirming that the disruption of Dd5P4 was indeed responsible for the observed defects. Growth rate in axenic medium was comparable to the growth rate of wild-type cells (AX3) with a doubling time of 15 h (Fig. 7). When grown on bacterial plates, ∼90% of the amoeba formed visible plaques within 4 days, and the multiple-tipped phenotype observed for theDd5P4− cells could not be observed anymore (Fig. 8). Overexpression of the inositol 5-phosphatase catalytic domain or the RhoGAP domain of Dd5P4 in the Dd5P4 knock-out strains (Dd5P4−/cat5P4 andDd5P4−/GAP5P4, respectively) did not restore any of the defects. As can be seen in Fig. 7, growth rate in axenic medium was not enhanced by overexpression of either one of the domains. Also, growth rate and development on bacterial lawns were not restored (data not shown). The implicated role of phosphoinositide molecules in signal localization has lead to an increased interest in metabolizing enzymes such as inositol 5-phosphatases. The amount of data on mammalian inositol 5-phosphatases has expanded rapidly over the last few years, showing important functions for inositol 5-phosphatases in several processes (6Erneux C. Govaerts C. Communi D. Pesesse X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 185-199Google Scholar). Human inositol 5-phosphatases are divided in two groups. Type I inositol 5-phosphatases only convert the water-soluble substrates Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. They do not convert lipid substrates. Type II inositol 5-phosphatases do convert phosphoinositides (e.g. PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3), and in most cases, they also convert water-soluble substrates. The insertions present in Type I enzymes may prevent the enzymes from binding to the membrane surface, which may explain the differences in substrate specificity between Types I and II inositol 5-phosphatases (28Tsujishita Y. Guo S. Stolz L.E. York J.D. Hurley J.H. Cell. 2001; 105: 379-389Google Scholar). The insertions present in Type I inositol 5-phosphatases are not present in either one of the D. discoideum inositol 5-phosphatases. As expected by this sequence analysis, the D. discoideum 5-phosphatases Dd5P2, Dd5P3, and Dd5P4 catalyze the dephosphorylation of both water-soluble and lipid substrates, which classify them as Type II inositol 5-phosphatases. The D. discoideum genome has been sequenced to near completion, making it unlikely that more inositol 5-phosphatases containing the motifs WXGDXN(Y/F)R and P(A/S)W(C/T)DR(I/V)L are present. Therefore, probably no Type I and only four Type II inositol 5-phosphatases are present in D. discoideum. Type II inositol 5-phosphatases can be divided in three subgroups on the basis of domain composition. SHIP1 represents the group of SH2 domain containing inositol 5-phosphatases Synaptojanin, theSacI domain containing enzymes, and OCRL, the RhoGAP domain containing inositol 5-phosphatases (Fig. 1). Mammals contain all three groups of proteins. Six non-mammalian organisms containing putative inositol 5-phosphatases have been sequenced completely so far. The metazoa C. elegans and D. melanogaster lack inositol 5-phosphatases containing a SH2 domain, but both contain one Synaptojanin-like protein ((41) and Q9W296, respectively) and one OCRL-like protein (O17590 and O46049, respectively). The diversity in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the yeast strainsSaccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and the microsporidia Encephalitozoon cuniculiis even less. The inositol 5-phosphatases of A. thalianacontain only WD40 repeats as additional domains (e.g. Q9SKB7 and O80560), whereas in yeast only Synaptojanin-like proteins are present (28Tsujishita Y. Guo S. Stolz L.E. York J.D. Hurley J.H. Cell. 2001; 105: 379-389Google Scholar, 34Stolz L.E. Huynh C.V. Thorner J. York J.D. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1715-1729Google Scholar). The one inositol 5-phosphatase ofE. cuniculi (CAD25856) only contains the inositol 5-phosphatase catalytic domain. In prokaryotes, no inositol 5-phosphatases have been identified. The four inositol 5-phosphatases in D. discoideum show a high diversity in domain composition compared with the evolutionary position of this organism between plants and yeast. A homologue of OCRL (Dd5P4) and a homologue of Synaptojanin (Dd5P3) were identified. Also, a unique combination of a RCC1-like domain in front of the inositol 5-phosphatase domain was identified (Dd5P2). This combination of domains has not been found in any other protein reported or present in the GenBankTM so far. Knock-out strains with one or a combination of two inactive genes for Dd5P1, Dd5P2, and Dd5P3 show no defects in growth and development, suggesting a redundancy among these proteins. Chemotaxis toward cAMP is similar or slightly improved in all of the inositol 5-phosphatase knock-out cell lines compared with wild type. Recently, it has been shown that the 3-phosphatase PTEN is the major PI(3,4,5)P3/PI(3,4)P2-degrading enzyme. It has been suggested that inositol 5-phosphatases add an addition layer of regulation of these molecules, fine-tuning the chemotactic signal (42Comer F.I. Parent C.A. Cell. 2002; 109: 541-544Google Scholar). Our results support the role of the group of inositol 5-phosphatases as a minor negative regulator of chemotaxis in D. discoideum. It will be interesting to study the effects of either overexpression or inactivation of the inositol 5-phosphatases in a PTEN-null background. Inactivation of Dd5P4 resulted in defects in growth and development. The reduced growth rate, either in axenic culture or grown on bacterial plates, suggests a role for Dd5P4 in endocytosis. Development is also affected as the cells form multiple-tipped aggregates. The relative high transcription levels of Dd5P4 at vegetative and multicellular stages support the role of Dd5P4 in growth and development. Knock-out strains of PI3K1 + 2 are defective in chemotaxis, growth, and development (15Funamoto S. Milan K. Meili R. Firtel R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 795-810Google Scholar, 16Zhou K. Takegawa K. Emr S.D. Firtel R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5645-5656Google Scholar). The cells grow slowly on bacterial lawns and in axenic medium and form multiple-tipped aggregates resembling the phenotype of Dd5P4. No enzyme activity measurements have been reported for the PI3K in D. discoideum, but they have been suggested to catalyze the formation of PI(3)P, PI(3,4)P2, and PI(3,4,5)P3on basis of sequence homology. Our results support a role for PI(3,4,5)P3 and/or PI(3,4)P2 in growth and development; Dd5P4 regulates the levels of these phospholipids by degradation of PI(3,4,5)P3 and production of PI(3,4)P2. On the other hand, the effect of inactivation of Dd5P4 could also be assigned to its action on either PI(4,5)P2 or Ins(1,4,5)P3, two signaling molecules also implicated in endocytosis (20Peracino B. Borleis J. Jin T. Westphal M. Schwartz J.M. Wu L. Bracco E. Gerisch G. Devreotes P. Bozzaro S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1529-1537Google Scholar, 21Seastone D.J. Zhang L. Buczynski G. Rebstein P. Weeks G. Spiegelman G. Cardelli J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 393-406Google Scholar). In addition, the RhoGAP domain could be responsible for the function of Dd5P4 in endocytosis. Rho proteins have been shown to play a role in both development and growth. The defects in growth and development ofDd5P4− cells can be rescued by overexpression of the full-length protein. These defects can not be restored by transfection of D. discoideum cells with an expression vector containing either the inositol 5-phosphatase catalytic domain or the RhoGAP domain. Although we can not exclude that the domains are not properly expressed or folded, the fact that the inositol 5-phosphatase catalytic domain expressed in E. coli is catalytically active would suggest that inositol 5-phosphatase activity is not sufficient to restore the defects ofDd5P4−cells. It is possible that the RhoGAP and inositol 5-phosphatase catalytic domain act together to perform its function in growth. The binding of a Rho protein to the RhoGAP domain could affect the inositol 5-phosphatase activity. This would lead to a direct interaction between the Rho and phosphoinositide pathways. It would be interesting to see if and which Rho protein binds to the GAP domain of Dd5P4. We are indebted to all of the teams involved in the Dictyostelium sequencing projects. We thank L. Drayer and H. Otsuka for their contribution in cloning and analyzing Dd5P1."

The early branching eukaryote Entamoeba histolytica is a human parasite that is the etiologic agent of amebic dysentery and liver abscess. Only one of every 10 infections leads to disease (1Padilla-Vaca F. Ankri S. Bracha R. Koole L.A. Mirelman D. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2096-2102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the parasite and host factors that control the outcome of infection are not well understood. Alteration in transcriptional control of certain crucial genes may contribute to the expression of a virulence phenotype. Padilla-Vaca et al. (1Padilla-Vaca F. Ankri S. Bracha R. Koole L.A. Mirelman D. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2096-2102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that co-cultivation of E. histolytica with Escherichia coli O55 resulted in increased virulence and a decrease in the expression of the Gal/GalNAc-inhibitable lectin light subunit. Ramakrishnan et al. (2Ramakrishnan G. Ragland B.D. Purdy J.E. Mann B.J. Mol.

To increase our understanding of transcriptional regulation in this organism we investigated the mechanisms of transcriptional control of a well characterized virulence protein, the galactose- andN-acetyl-d-galactosamine-inhibitable lectin (Gal/GalNAc-inhibitable lectin), which is essential for parasite adherence and contact-mediated cytolysis. The promoter for one of the genes encoding the lectin heavy subunit (hgl5) contains five major regulatory regions (upstream regulatory elements 1–5 (URE1–5)) 1The abbreviations used are: URE, upstream regulatory element; BP, binding protein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MUT, mutant; mAb, monoclonal antibody; ChIP, Chromatin immunoprecipitation; wt, wild-type; DREAM, downstream regulatory element antagonist modulator 1The abbreviations used are: URE, upstream regulatory element; BP, binding protein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; MUT, mutant; mAb, monoclonal antibody; ChIP, Chromatin immunoprecipitation; wt, wild-type; DREAM, downstream regulatory element antagonist modulator upstream of the core promoter (4Purdy J.E.

Thehgl5 UREs differ in whether they regulate transcription via the TATA or the GAAC elements, with the URE3 exerting its effect on mRNA transcription via GAAC (9Singh U. Gilchrist C.A. Schaenman J.M.

Interestingly, mutation of the URE3 motif in the hgl5 promoter leads to an increase in transcription and in the fdx promoter decreased promoter strength (10Gilchrist C.A. Mann B.J. Petri Jr., W.A. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2383-2386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that, as is the case for the mouse context-dependant Pax-5 transcription factor, the URE3 sequence can mediate both positive and negative control in different milieu (11Linderson Y. French N.S. Neurath M.F. Pettersson S. Gene. 2001; 262: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Two different genes encode the ferredoxin proteins of E. histolytica. The fdx URE3-containing promoter regulates the gene that encodes the ferredoxin 1 protein. This transcript is down-regulated in metronidazole-resistant amebae, in contrast with the level of the ferredoxin 2 transcript (fd2), which is unaltered (12Wassmann C. Hellberg A. Tannich E.

Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1063-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) discovered thatfd2 mRNA is one of the transcripts up-regulated in ameba cultured from liver abscesses. These two papers suggest that ferredoxins may be tightly regulated in E. histolytica. Investigation of the sequence surrounding the fd2 gene showed that a URE3 motif was located 1.2 kb 5′ of the initiation codon (International Entamoeba Genome Sequencing Project) 2Z. Wang, J.

Loftus, unpublished data., but it is unclear whether this motif would play any role in fd2regulation.A yeast-one-hybrid screen of an E. histolytica cDNA library using the URE3 element as “bait” identified the URE3-binding protein (URE3-BP) (14Gilchrist C.A.

Analysis of the URE3-BP amino acid sequence did not identify any canonical DNA binding motifs but did reveal the presence of two EF-hand motifs, which are correlated with the ability of a protein to bind to calcium (15Kawasaki H. Kretsinger R.H. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 297-490PubMed Google Scholar). This suggested that the URE3-BP protein might function as both a calcium sensor and a transcription factor. The only other reported sequence-specific DNA-binding protein known to contain EF-hand motifs is DREAM. DREAM is a human neuronal protein (also known as Calsenilin and KChIP3) that functions both as a transcription factor (16Carrion A.M. Link W.A. Ledo F. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R.

Neurosci. 2002; 19: 552-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). DREAM contains four EF-hand sequence motifs. Typically, the binding of Ca2+ to EF-hands induces structural changes that alter the function of the protein. In the case of DREAM, binding of Ca2+ to its EF-hands leads to a reduced affinity for sequence-specific binding to its target downstream regulatory element sequence (16Carrion A.M. Link W.A. Ledo F. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Nature. 1999; 398: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar).Previous analysis of the recombinant URE3-BP protein sequence-specific DNA binding by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that recognition of a URE3-containing oligonucleotide was blocked in vitro by calcium (14Gilchrist C.A.

In this report, we tested the in vivo role of the EF-hand motifs of URE3-BP in protein-promoter interactions.DISCUSSIONThis work demonstrates that URE3-BP is a calcium-binding protein that can function as both a transcription factor and calcium sensor inE. histolytica. Only one other calcium binding eukaryotic transcription factor, DREAM, has been described. DREAM (also known as Calsenilin or KChIP3) also contains EF-hand motifs and is similar to URE3-BP in that it exhibits sequence-specific binding to DNA. An increase in calcium levels in vitro blocks DNA binding by DREAM and URE3-BP. The mutation of EF(2) of URE3-BP had little effect on DNA binding but impeded the ability of Ca2+ to blockin vitro DNA binding to URE3. This showed that the second EF-hand motif of URE3-BP was essential for the calcium modulation of URE3-BP DNA binding.Promoter occupancy of URE3-BP in vivo on the native chromatin of URE3-BP of the fdx and hgl5 promoters was tested in this work. To determine whether URE3-BP interacted with URE3-containing promoters in the nucleus we utilized the ChIP assay in conjunction with real time PCR. This allowed measurement of URE3-BP bound to URE3-containing promoters in intact trophozoites. Our results indicated that URE3-BP was located on both the fdx and hgl5 promoters in the nuclear environment.Internal changes in [Ca2+]i have been observed in response to various stimuli (25Carbajal M.E.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and several important calcium-binding proteins have been discovered inE. histolytica including a protein similar to calmodulin,EhCaBP (36Nickel R.

Parasitol. 1992; 52: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition, the multidrug resistance phenotype mediated by the up-regulation of the EhPgp1 andEhPgp5 genes of E. histolytica has been shown to be reversed by calcium-channel blocker verapamil (38Marchat L.A. Gomez C. Perez D.G. Paz F. Mendoza L. Orozco E. Cell Microbiol. 2002; 4: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 39Perez D.G. Gomez C. Lopez-Bayghen E. Tannich E. Orozco E. J. Biol.

Parasitol. 1990; 71: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of URE3-BP as a calcium sensor protein we investigated the impact of altering [Ca2+]i on URE3-BP promoter occupancy. A significant decrease in URE3-BP location at both thehgl5 and fdx promoters was observed upon an increase in [Ca2+]i. Therefore, calcium not only prevented in vitro binding of URE3-BP to URE3 but also blocked the occupancy of URE3-containing promoters by URE3-BP in vivo.Because calcium levels influenced the binding of URE3-BP to the URE3-containing promoters the effect of calcium on the steady state levels of fdx and URE3-BP mRNA was examined. The hgl5 mRNA was not analyzed, because it was not possible to design PCR primers that would amplify hgl5 mRNA without cross-hybridizing to other hgl genes that lack URE3-containing promoters (2Ramakrishnan G. Ragland B.D. Purdy J.E. Mann B.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the case of the fdxgene, its transcript was not significantly changed by increases in intracellular calcium. This perhaps was not surprising as changes in intracellular calcium would be predicted to have pluripotent effects on the trophozoite that could have disparate effects on fdxmRNA abundance.In contrast to the situation for fdx mRNA, the addition of calcium sharply decreased the level of the URE3-BP mRNA. This decrease could be mediated by an autofeedback mechanism where URE3-BP is displaced by calcium from the URE3 motif located at the 3′ sequence of URE3-BP. Mutational analysis of the URE3 motif in the 3′ noncoding region of URE-3BP will be required to test directly whether the gene is directly autoregulated, although one might expect, as is the case for the fdx gene, that URE-3BP will fall under complex regulatory responses to changes in intracellular calcium. In either case these results indicate that increases in intracellular calcium not only decrease the ability of URE-3BP to bind DNA but also decrease its mRNA abundance. This suggests that URE3-BP is both an effector and a responder in a cascade of calcium-regulated gene expression in the parasite.One of the mysteries of amebiasis is why only a minority of infected individuals develop invasive disease. E. histolyticaencounters differing levels of extracellular calcium in the human intestine where it lives. We have shown here that intracellular calcium levels in the parasite are exquisitely sensitive to changes in extracellular calcium. The extracellular calcium concentration in the intestinal lumen is influenced by the amount of calcium ingested, absorbed, and excreted. In the small intestine where the parasite excysts, luminal calcium concentrations are well above 1 mm (42Nellans H.N. Miner. Electrolyte Metab. 1990; 16: 101-108PubMed Google Scholar). E. histolytica trophozoites colonizing the large intestine are exposed to extracellular calcium levels that vary depending upon the diet (13Civitelli R. Avioli L.V. Johnson L.R. Alpers D.H. Christensen J. Jacobsen E. 3rd Ed. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 2. Raven Press, New York1994: 2173-2182Google Scholar, 42Nellans H.N. Miner. Electrolyte Metab. 1990; 16: 101-108PubMed Google Scholar). In hosts with a high calcium diet trophozoites would be exposed to >1.25 mm calcium. We would predict from our data that these calcium levels would be sufficient to block URE3-BP binding and decrease URE3-BP synthesis. In a low calcium diet, luminal calcium concentration may drop to ∼1.25 mm. In this circumstance calcium absorption in the large intestine is considerably enhanced, and free Ca2+ will be further decreased (42Nellans H.N. Miner. Electrolyte Metab. 1990; 16: 101-108PubMed Google Scholar). URE3-BP-mediated gene regulation would then play a significant role in the regulation of transcription. It is possible that calcium and calcium sensors including URE3-BP influence the expression of the virulence phenotype of E. histolyticain the large intestine and impact the development of disease. The early branching eukaryote Entamoeba histolytica is a human parasite that is the etiologic agent of amebic dysentery and liver abscess. Only one of every 10 infections leads to disease (1Padilla-Vaca F. Ankri S. Bracha R. Koole L.A. Mirelman D. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2096-2102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the parasite and host factors that control the outcome of infection are not well understood. Alteration in transcriptional control of certain crucial genes may contribute to the expression of a virulence phenotype. Padilla-Vaca et al. (1Padilla-Vaca F. Ankri S. Bracha R. Koole L.A. Mirelman D. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2096-2102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that co-cultivation of E. histolytica with Escherichia coli O55 resulted in increased virulence and a decrease in the expression of the Gal/GalNAc-inhibitable lectin light subunit. Ramakrishnan et al. (2Ramakrishnan G. Ragland B.D. Purdy J.E. Mann B.J. Mol.

In this report, we tested the in vivo role of the EF-hand motifs of URE3-BP in protein-promoter interactions. DISCUSSIONThis work demonstrates that URE3-BP is a calcium-binding protein that can function as both a transcription factor and calcium sensor inE. histolytica. Only one other calcium binding eukaryotic transcription factor, DREAM, has been described. DREAM (also known as Calsenilin or KChIP3) also contains EF-hand motifs and is similar to URE3-BP in that it exhibits sequence-specific binding to DNA. An increase in calcium levels in vitro blocks DNA binding by DREAM and URE3-BP. The mutation of EF(2) of URE3-BP had little effect on DNA binding but impeded the ability of Ca2+ to blockin vitro DNA binding to URE3. This showed that the second EF-hand motif of URE3-BP was essential for the calcium modulation of URE3-BP DNA binding.Promoter occupancy of URE3-BP in vivo on the native chromatin of URE3-BP of the fdx and hgl5 promoters was tested in this work. To determine whether URE3-BP interacted with URE3-containing promoters in the nucleus we utilized the ChIP assay in conjunction with real time PCR. This allowed measurement of URE3-BP bound to URE3-containing promoters in intact trophozoites. Our results indicated that URE3-BP was located on both the fdx and hgl5 promoters in the nuclear environment.Internal changes in [Ca2+]i have been observed in response to various stimuli (25Carbajal M.E.

To investigate the role of URE3-BP as a calcium sensor protein we investigated the impact of altering [Ca2+]i on URE3-BP promoter occupancy. A significant decrease in URE3-BP location at both thehgl5 and fdx promoters was observed upon an increase in [Ca2+]i. Therefore, calcium not only prevented in vitro binding of URE3-BP to URE3 but also blocked the occupancy of URE3-containing promoters by URE3-BP in vivo.Because calcium levels influenced the binding of URE3-BP to the URE3-containing promoters the effect of calcium on the steady state levels of fdx and URE3-BP mRNA was examined. The hgl5 mRNA was not analyzed, because it was not possible to design PCR primers that would amplify hgl5 mRNA without cross-hybridizing to other hgl genes that lack URE3-containing promoters (2Ramakrishnan G. Ragland B.D. Purdy J.E. Mann B.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the case of the fdxgene, its transcript was not significantly changed by increases in intracellular calcium. This perhaps was not surprising as changes in intracellular calcium would be predicted to have pluripotent effects on the trophozoite that could have disparate effects on fdxmRNA abundance.In contrast to the situation for fdx mRNA, the addition of calcium sharply decreased the level of the URE3-BP mRNA. This decrease could be mediated by an autofeedback mechanism where URE3-BP is displaced by calcium from the URE3 motif located at the 3′ sequence of URE3-BP. Mutational analysis of the URE3 motif in the 3′ noncoding region of URE-3BP will be required to test directly whether the gene is directly autoregulated, although one might expect, as is the case for the fdx gene, that URE-3BP will fall under complex regulatory responses to changes in intracellular calcium. In either case these results indicate that increases in intracellular calcium not only decrease the ability of URE-3BP to bind DNA but also decrease its mRNA abundance. This suggests that URE3-BP is both an effector and a responder in a cascade of calcium-regulated gene expression in the parasite.One of the mysteries of amebiasis is why only a minority of infected individuals develop invasive disease. E. histolyticaencounters differing levels of extracellular calcium in the human intestine where it lives. We have shown here that intracellular calcium levels in the parasite are exquisitely sensitive to changes in extracellular calcium. The extracellular calcium concentration in the intestinal lumen is influenced by the amount of calcium ingested, absorbed, and excreted. In the small intestine where the parasite excysts, luminal calcium concentrations are well above 1 mm (42Nellans H.N. Miner. Electrolyte Metab. 1990; 16: 101-108PubMed Google Scholar). E. histolytica trophozoites colonizing the large intestine are exposed to extracellular calcium levels that vary depending upon the diet (13Civitelli R. Avioli L.V. Johnson L.R. Alpers D.H. Christensen J. Jacobsen E. 3rd Ed. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 2. Raven Press, New York1994: 2173-2182Google Scholar, 42Nellans H.N. Miner. Electrolyte Metab. 1990; 16: 101-108PubMed Google Scholar). In hosts with a high calcium diet trophozoites would be exposed to >1.25 mm calcium. We would predict from our data that these calcium levels would be sufficient to block URE3-BP binding and decrease URE3-BP synthesis. In a low calcium diet, luminal calcium concentration may drop to ∼1.25 mm. In this circumstance calcium absorption in the large intestine is considerably enhanced, and free Ca2+ will be further decreased (42Nellans H.N. Miner. Electrolyte Metab. 1990; 16: 101-108PubMed Google Scholar). URE3-BP-mediated gene regulation would then play a significant role in the regulation of transcription. It is possible that calcium and calcium sensors including URE3-BP influence the expression of the virulence phenotype of E. histolyticain the large intestine and impact the development of disease. This work demonstrates that URE3-BP is a calcium-binding protein that can function as both a transcription factor and calcium sensor inE. histolytica. Only one other calcium binding eukaryotic transcription factor, DREAM, has been described. DREAM (also known as Calsenilin or KChIP3) also contains EF-hand motifs and is similar to URE3-BP in that it exhibits sequence-specific binding to DNA. An increase in calcium levels in vitro blocks DNA binding by DREAM and URE3-BP. The mutation of EF(2) of URE3-BP had little effect on DNA binding but impeded the ability of Ca2+ to blockin vitro DNA binding to URE3. This showed that the second EF-hand motif of URE3-BP was essential for the calcium modulation of URE3-BP DNA binding. Promoter occupancy of URE3-BP in vivo on the native chromatin of URE3-BP of the fdx and hgl5 promoters was tested in this work. To determine whether URE3-BP interacted with URE3-containing promoters in the nucleus we utilized the ChIP assay in conjunction with real time PCR.

https://openalex.org/W1990515867,"Phosducin-like protein (PhLP) is a member of the phosducin family of G-protein βγ-regulators and exists in two splice variants. The long isoform PhLPLand the short isoform PhLPS differ by the presence or absence of an 83-amino acid N terminus. In isolated biochemical assay systems, PhLPL is the more potent Gβγ-inhibitor, whereas the functional role of PhLPS is still unclear. We now report that in intact HEK 293 cells, PhLPS inhibited Gβγ-induced inositol phosphate generation with ∼20-fold greater potency than PhLPL. Radiolabeling of transfected HEK 293 cells with [32P] revealed that PhLPL is constitutively phosphorylated, whereas PhLPS is not. Because PhLPL has several consensus sites for the constitutively active kinase casein kinase 2 (CK2) in its N terminus, we tested the phosphorylation of the recombinant proteins by either HEK cell cytosol in the presence or absence of kinase inhibitors or by purified CK2. PhLPL was a good CK2 substrate, whereas PhLPS and phosducin were not. Progressive truncation and serine/threonine to alanine mutations of the PhLPL N terminus identified a serine/threonine cluster (Ser-18/Thr-19/Ser-20) within a small N-terminal region of PhLPL (amino acids 5–28) as the site in which PhLPL function was modified in HEK 293 cells. In native tissue, PhLPL also seems to be regulated by phosphorylation because phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of PhLPL were detected in mouse brain and adrenal gland. Moreover, the alternatively spliced isoform PhLPS was also found in adrenal tissue. Therefore, the physiological control of G-protein regulation by PhLP seems to involve phosphorylation by CK2 and alternative splicing of the regulator.

PhLP has a high sequence homology to the G-protein βγ-subunit (Gβγ) regulator phosducin. Similarly, as phosducin, PhLP has been found to bind to Gβγ with high affinity (2Schröder S. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2100-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and act as a Gβγ-binding protein in intact cells (3Thibault C. Sganga M.W. Miles M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12253-12256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The PhLP mRNA exists in two major splice variants coding for two proteins, which differ by the presence (PhLPL) or absence (PhLPS) of the N-terminal 83 amino acids (1Miles M.F. Barhite S. Sganga M. Elliott M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10831-10835Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 4Thibault C. Feng Wang J. Charnas R. Mirel D. Barhite S. Miles M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1444: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies on diverse tissues demonstrated that PhLPL is expressed in many organs at high protein levels (e.g. brain, heart, and liver), whereas PhLPS protein levels could not or only hardly be detected in these organs (4Thibault C. Feng Wang J. Charnas R. Mirel D. Barhite S. Miles M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1444: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 5Schröder S. Lohse M.J. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2000; 362: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Direct comparison of the affinities toward Gβγ showed a 15-fold weaker interaction for PhLPS compared with phosducin or PhLPL (5Schröder S. Lohse M.J. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2000; 362: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Therefore, PhLPS had been believed to play only a minor role in G-protein regulation. Recently, it was reported that PhLPS could be purified from cultured bovine chromaffin cells where it might inhibit nicotine-stimulated exocytosis of catecholamines by a pathway involving a Gβγ·ADP-ribosylation factor 6 complex (6Gensse M. Vitale N. Chasserot-Golaz S. Bader M.F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that alternative splicing of PhLP might indeed occur in at least one organ or under specific conditions and therefore might play a role in differential functions of the PhLP isoforms. Regulation of the homologous protein phosducin has been found to occur by phosphorylation via the serine/threonine kinases PKA, GRK, or CaM-dependent kinase II (7Lee R.H. Brown B.M. Lolley R.N. J.

Phosphorylation of phosducin reduces the affinity for Gβγ, and as a consequence, phosducin looses its ability to regulate G-protein function. In the case of PhLP, phosphorylation as a regulatory mechanism has been suggested but has never been demonstrated (10Ruiz-Gomez A. Humrich J. Murga C. Quitterer U. Lohse M.J. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29724-29730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Here we report that the Gβγ-regulatory function of PhLPL is inhibited in cells by N-terminal phosphorylation via casein kinase 2 (CK2), whereas PhLPS lacks such a regulatory mechanism. CK2 is a constitutively active and ubiquitously expressed serine-threonine kinase (12Allende J.E. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 13Pinna L.A. Meggio F. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1997; 3: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Our findings further provide strong evidence that the extended N terminus of PhLPL becomes autoinhibitory upon phosphorylation by CK2. In contrast, alternative splicing leads to PhLPS, which is not a substrate for CK2 and thus escapes this inhibitory mechanism. [32P]ATP, [32P]orthophosphoric acid, andmyo-[2-3H]inositol were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The kinase inhibitors staurosporine, BAPTA-AM, and 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranylbenzimidazole (DRB) were purchased from Calbiochem. Heparin sodium salt (average molecular weight 6,000) was from Sigma. Primary antibodies used were rabbit polyclonal anti-PhLPS as described previously (5Schröder S. Lohse M.J. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2000; 362: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and rabbit polyclonal anti-PhLP-CT. This synthetic peptide was derived from the very C terminus of PhLPL and PhLPS(sequence: CHSEDSDLEID). After coupling to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (14Liu F.T. Zinnecker M. Hamaoka T. Katz D.H.

Secondary goat anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase was from Dianova. Protein A-Sepharose was obtained fromAmersham Biosciences. Phosphorimaging and quantification were done on a FLA-3000 from Fuji. ScanProsite was accessed at www.expasy.ch. All of the cDNAs used in these studies were subcloned into pcDNA3. The cDNA for PhLPL was originally cloned from rat brain (2Schröder S. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2100-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The construction of deletion mutants and Ser/Thr to Ala mutants of PhLPL were done by a PCR-based strategy and confirmed by automated sequencing. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were grown in DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum and were kept in 7% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Cells were transfected by using the CaPO4 method (16Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) on 10-cm dishes at 70% confluency with a constant total amount of DNA. Transfection efficiency was usually between 60 and 80% and was equal for all of the cDNAs used as controlled by transfection of different green fluorescent protein-tagged constructs. For determination of inositol phosphates, cells were seeded in six-well plates and labeled withmyo-[2-3H]inositol (2 μCi/ml; specific activity 21 Ci/mmol) for 16 h in inositol-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.2% fetal calf serum. Unlabeled cells from the same transfection also seeded in six-well plates were used for Western blotting to control expression levels. After labeling, cells were washed once in incubation buffer (138 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.6 mm CaCl2, 1 g/liter glucose, 20 mmNa+-HEPES, pH 7.3) and then incubated at 37 °C for 20 min in incubation buffer containing 10 mm LiCl. Reactions were stopped, and inositol phosphates were extracted as described previously (17Quitterer U. AbdAlla S. Jarnagin K. Müller-Esterl W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13368-13377Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Inositol determinations were performed in triplicates, and results were analyzed as the means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. ANOVA and post-test comparison (Bonferroni) were performed as appropriate. For the control of expression levels, cells of one well were lysed in 250 μl of hypotonic lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris base, pH 10.5) for 15 min on ice and then centrifuged. Supernatants were analyzed by Western blots using polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) and anti-PhLP-CT antibodies. Detection was performed with goat anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase antibodies and the Uptilight horseradish peroxidase-blotting kit (Interchim). Phosducin, PhLPL, and PhLPS were purified from Escherichia coli as C-terminally His6-tagged proteins (5Schröder S. Lohse M.J. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2000; 362: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). PKA phosphorylation was performed as described (10Ruiz-Gomez A. Humrich J. Murga C. Quitterer U. Lohse M.J. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29724-29730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and phosphoproteins were visualized by exposure to Biomax MS films (Eastman Kodak Co.). CK2 kinase assays were performed with recombinant human CK2 enzyme (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or cell extracts. In kinase assays using recombinant human CK2, a 50-μl volume containing 400 nm recombinant PhLPL, PhLPS or phosducin, CK2 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol), 0.04 or 0.3 milliunit of CK2, and 200 μm ATP (1 μCi of [32P]ATP) was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min or at 37 °C for 120 min. The reaction was terminated by boiling samples in Laemmli buffer followed by SDS-PAGE, Coomassie Blue staining, and phosphorimaging. For kinase assays using HEK cell cytosol, a lysate was prepared by resuspending cells of one 15-cm dish in 5 ml of CK2 buffer (supplemented with 1 mm PMSF), disrupting the cells by sonication and clearing the lysate by centrifugation (20,000 ×g, 10 min). Protein content was determined in the supernatant by the Bradford method. Phosphorylation was then performed by adding 150 μg of total protein of cell extract to a 250-μl reaction with 400 nm His6-tagged protein and 10 μCi of [32P]ATP and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were then placed on ice, diluted with 5 volumes of ice-cold pull-down buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl), supplemented with 50 μl of Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen), and rotated at 4 °C for 10 min. The beads were then washed, boiled, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. Phosphorylation of PhLP in intact HEK 293 cells was done essentially as described with minor modifications (18Malecz N. Bambino T. Bencsik M. Nissenson R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1846-1856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection and 36 h after seeding in six-well plates, HEK 293 cells were washed in phosphate- and serum-free DMEM supplemented with 20 mm Na+-HEPES, pH 7.4, (labeling buffer) and then incubated in the same buffer for 30 min. Labeling of the intracellular ATP pool was then performed with 200 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphoric acid (specific activity 10 mCi/ml) for 2 h at 30 °C. Where indicated, cells were stimulated with 1 mm carbachol for 5 min. Cells were immediately placed on ice and washed once with ice-cold buffer. The cells then were lysed on ice with 1 ml of lysis buffer (300 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mmNa4P2O7, 5 mmEDTA-Na2, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.01% NaN3, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, freshly supplemented with 10 mm iodoacetamide and 1 mmPMSF). After 20 min, the Triton X-100-insoluble fractions were removed by centrifugation (20,000 × g for 15 min) and PhLP was immunoprecipitated from the supernatants by the anti-PhLPSantibody precoupled to protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing, immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and radiolabeled PhLP was visualized and quantified by phosphorimaging. Expression of PhLP was controlled by Western blotting of an aliquot obtained from the centrifuged lysates (with the use of the anti-PhLP-CT antibody). Mouse heart, brain, adrenal gland, and embryo (day 10.5 post-conception) were homogenized in five volumes of the same lysis buffer as described above (containing phosphatase inhibitors). After centrifugation and adjustment of total protein levels in supernatants as indicated, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. In the case of dephosphorylation experiments, lysis was performed in 40 mmTris base, pH 10.5, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm PMSF (phosphatase inhibitors were omitted), samples were cleared by centrifugation (20,000 × g for 10 min), and protein content was determined by the Bradford method. Dephosporylation was then performed by adding 50 μg of HEK cell lysate or 100 μg of brain lysate to a 50-μl reaction with phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij 35) and with or without 1000 units of λ-protein phosphatase (λ-PPase) (New England Biolabs) at 37 °C for 20 min. The reaction was terminated by boiling in Laemmli buffer followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. To investigate the functional role of PhLPL and PhLPS as Gβγ-regulators in living cells, we subcloned the appropriate cDNAs into the pcDNA3 expression vector and determined the inositol phosphate formation stimulated by the transient co-transfection of phospholipase Cβ2(PLCβ2) and G-protein subunits Gβ1 and Gγ2 as described previously (19Xu J. Wu D. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2086-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 20Quitterer U. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Without addition of any Gβγ-inhibiting proteins, the transfection of PLCβ2 and Gβ1γ2 cDNA (3 μg each) enhanced basal inositol phosphate accumulation ∼5-fold compared with mock-transfected cells (data not shown). Co-transfection of the cDNA encoding PhLPL inhibited the Gβγ-stimulated production of inositol phosphates significantly (Fig. 1 A). Unexpectedly, the short splice variant PhLPS turned out to be more effective than the long splice variant PhLPL, although PhLPSinteracts with purified Gβγ less efficiently than PhLPL(5Schröder S. Lohse M.J. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2000; 362: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Co-transfection of 8 μg of cDNA for each Gβγ-binding protein inhibited the total inositol phosphate formation by 32.2 ± 8.4% (n = 13) for PhLPL, 78.3 ± 3.8% (n = 7) for PhLPS, and 75.0 ± 4.0% (n = 3) for GRK2-K220R, which served as positive control (21Dicker F. Quitterer U. Winstel R. Honold K. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5476-5481Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Because inositol phosphate levels of untransfected control cells were ∼20% of the inositol phosphate levels of PLCβ2, Gβ1γ2 co-expressing cells (data not shown), inhibition by ∼80%, can be considered full inhibition. Thus, inhibition by PhLPS was almost complete. The differences between control and PhLPL and between PhLPL and PhLPS were highly significant (p < 0.01). The different effects of PhLPLand PhLPS were not because of different protein expression as shown by Western blot analysis of the transfected cells (Fig. 1 B). The blot with samples from three independent experiments shows equal expression of PhLPL and PhLPS within individual experiments and between different experiments. To analyze further the different effects of PhLPL and PhLPS on Gβγ-function, dose-response experiments were performed. The cDNA of PhLPL or PhLPS was diluted with empty vector to maintain the total amount of transfected cDNA, and inositol phosphates were determined as before. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the IC50 of PhLPL was 20-fold higher than that of PhLPS (13.2 and 0.64 μg of cDNA, respectively). Fig. 2, B and C, shows that the transfection of HEK 293 cells with increasing amounts of cDNA did indeed result in the expression of corresponding amounts of PhLPL or PhLPS, respectively. To analyze the role of phosphorylation in intact cells as a possible regulatory mechanism, we labeled HEK 293 cells with [32P]orthophosphate and looked for basal- and receptor-stimulated phosphorylation. PhLP cDNAs were co-transfected with M3 muscarinic receptor cDNA. The M3muscarinic receptor was chosen because of the prominent inositol phosphate signal that can be achieved by its stimulation (data not shown). 48 h after transfection, the receptors were stimulated with carbachol for 5 min (Fig. 3). PhLPL exhibited a markedly higher degree of basal phosphorylation compared with PhLPS. However, in both cases, stimulation of the M3 receptor by carbachol did not enhance the extent of phosphorylation (Fig. 3 A, left panel). Fig. 3 B summarizes a series of similar experiments demonstrating that the basal phosphorylation of PhLPL was ∼8-fold higher than that of PhLPS, but that carbachol did not significantly stimulate the phosphorylation of PhLPL or of PhLPS. Expression was controlled by Western blotting with the PhLP-CT antibody and showed that both proteins were equally expressed (Fig. 3 A, right panel). Overexpression of PhLPS did not affect the phosphorylation state of PhLPL (data not shown). These findings demonstrate that PhLPL was constitutively phosphorylated in HEK 293 cells, whereas PhLPS only exhibited very low levels of phosphorylation. To identify the responsible kinase for PhLPL phosphorylation, a computer analysis (ScanProsite) of the sequence of the N-terminal 83 amino acids of PhLPL revealed seven putative CK2 phosphorylation sites each within a classical CK2 phosphorylation motif ((S/T)-X-X-(D/E)) (see (Fig. 5 A)). To test whether PhLPL could be a substrate of CK2 phosphorylation in vitro, we performed kinase assays with human recombinant CK2 and found that recombinant PhLPLwas indeed a substrate, whereas PhLPS and phosducin were not (Fig. 4 A). We used the potent but unspecific kinase inhibitor staurosporine (22Ruegg U.T. Burgess G.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; 10: 218-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) and the intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM (23Billman G.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H1529-H1535PubMed Google Scholar, 24Jiang S. Chow S.C. Nicotera P. Orrenius S. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) to test their effects on recombinant CK2 and found no effect on PhLPLphosphorylation. On the other hand, we tested two substances that were known to inhibit CK2: the glycosaminoglycan heparin (EC50∼3 nm) (12Allende J.E. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 25Block K. Boyer T.G. Yew P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41049-41058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 26Zandomeni R.O. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 469-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 27Kim S.J. Kahn C.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 681-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and the nucleoside derivative DRB (EC50 ∼7 μm) (26, 27). In the in vitro kinase assay, 3 μm heparin completely abolished PhLPL phosphorylation by CK2 and 100 μm DRB markedly inhibited PhLPLphosphorylation. To determine whether CK2 is the predominant PhLPL kinase in HEK 293 cells, we performed kinase assays using HEK cell lysate and recombinant PhLPL with and without the addition of kinase inhibitors and recombinant PhLPS as well as phosducin (Fig. 4 B). Previous studies have shown that CK2 is abundantly present in mammalian cell lysates (12Allende J.E. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 28Lin A. Frost J. Deng T. Smeal T. al-Alawi N. Kikkawa U. Hunter T. Brenner D. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 777-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that PhLPL but not PhLPS or phosducin was predominantly phosphorylated by HEK cell lysate. This phosphorylation was inhibited by heparin (3 μm) and DRB (100 μm), whereas staurosporine only weakly inhibited and BAPTA-AM weakly stimulated the phosphorylation of PhLPL. These results provide strong evidence that CK2 is the predominant kinase in HEK 293 cells that constitutively phosphorylates PhLPL. We then asked whether PhLP was also a substrate for PKA phosphorylation in vitrosimilar to PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the homologous protein phosducin. PKA kinase assays were done with the same concentration (400 nm) of purified recombinant phosducin, PhLPL, and PhLPS (Fig. 4 C). Phosducin was an excellent PKA substrate, whereas both PhLP variants were not. They roughly showed 10–20-fold less radioactivity incorporated than phosducin. These results demonstrate that the different members of the phosducin family exhibit differential regulation by different kinases.Figure 4Phosphorylation of recombinant phosducin and PhLP by HEK cell lysate, recombinant casein kinase 2, and protein kinase A. Equimolar concentrations (400 nm) of recombinant C-terminally His6-tagged PhLPL(14.04 μg/ml), PhLPS (10.3 μg/ml), and phosducin (11.62 μg/ml) purified from E. coli were phosphorylated by either recombinant human casein kinase 2 or by HEK cell lysate or purified catalytic subunit of PKA. A, recombinant human CK2 (0.04 milliunit/reaction) was used to phosphorylate recombinant PhLPL, PhLPS, and phosducin at 30 °C for 30 min. After SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (Coomassie), the gel was subjected to phosphorimaging (32 P). CK2 phosphorylated PhLPL efficiently, whereas PhLPSwas only phosphorylated weakly (21% PhLPL) and phosducin was not (2% PhLPL). The concentration of the inhibitors used was 1 μm for staurosporine (Stauro), 100 μm for BAPTA-AM (BAPTA), 3 μmfor heparin, and 100 μm for DRB. Me2SO (DMSO) (1% v/v) served as solvent control. B, HEK 293 cell lysate extracted as detailed under “Experimental Procedures” was used to phosphorylate recombinant PhLPLin the absence or presence of kinase inhibitors as well as PhLPS and phosducin at 30 °C for 30 min. Recombinant proteins were pulled down by Ni-NTA-agarose and processed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Control denotes HEK cell lysate without any recombinant protein and reflects background phosphorylation. Shown is the gel as visualized by phosphorimaging (32 P) and by Coomassie Blue staining (Coomassie). PhLPL phosphorylation was inhibited by heparin and DRB (both known to inhibit CK2) but not by staurosporine or BAPTA, whereas PhLPS or phosducin was only weakly phosphorylated. C, recombinant phosducin, PhLPL, and PhLPS were phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of PKA (100 units) at 30 °C for 15 min. Reactions were stopped by Laemmli buffer, boiled, and separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Shown is the film (32 P) and the corresponding gel (Coomassie) to demonstrate that PKA phosphorylation of PhLP isoforms is not significant compared with phosducin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We then asked whether any particular region of the PhLPL N terminus was responsible for the weaker functional effects of PhLPL compared with PhLPS as well as for the constitutive phosphorylation in HEK 293 cells. As depicted in Fig. 5 A, the N terminus of PhLPL contains several putative phosphorylation sites that occur in clusters of serines and threonines. Seven of these sites could serve as CK2 phosphorylation sites. We constructed PhLPLmutants by stepwise shortening of the N terminus. The five PhLPL constructs were as follows: L5 (amino acids 5–301 with the loss of Thr-2 and Thr-3), L29 (amino acids 29–301 with the additional loss of Ser-18, Thr-19, Ser-20 and Ser-25), L36 (amino acids 36–301), L46 (amino acids 46–301 with the additional loss of Ser-39, Ser-40, Ser-41, and Thr-42), and L58 (amino acids 58–301 with the additional loss of Ser-54 and Thr-57). The determination of Gβγ-dependent inositol phosphate generation showed that a region within amino acids 5–28 caused the only major step in the gain of inhibitory function from PhLPL to PhLPSas demonstrated by the functional difference between L5 and L29 (Fig. 5 A, lower panel). The removal of the first 28 amino acids of PhLPL (as in L29, L36, L46, and L58) was sufficient to gain the full Gβγ-inhibitory activity of PhLPS. Western blots showed that all of the constructs with the exception of L5 were stable and that the expression levels of the constructs were comparable (Fig. 5 B). We next asked whether the putative CK2 phosphorylation sites of the region compromising amino acids 5–28 might play a functional role in PhLPL regulation, and if so, which of the four candidates (Ser-18, Thr-19, Ser-20, and Ser-25) was involved. Two mutants were constructed, PhLPLA18–20 in which Ser-18, Thr-19, and Ser-20 were changed to alanines, and PhLPLA25 in which Ser-25 was changed to an alanine. These constructs were tested for their ability to inhibit Gβγ-dependent inositol phosphate generation. PhLPLA18–20 showed the same Gβγ-inhibitory capability as PhLPS and L29 (Fig. 6 A), whereas PhLPLA25 exhibited the same functional capability as PhLPLA25. The differences between the effects of PhLPL and PhLPLA25 on the one hand and PhLPS, L29, and PhLPLA18–20 on the other hand were highly significant (Fig. 6 A). Again, equal expression of the constructs was demonstrated in Western blot experiments (Fig. 6 B). These data suggest that the cluster of Ser-18, Thr-19, and Ser-20 contains the phosphorylation sites responsible for the diminished Gβγ-inhibitory effects of PhLPL, whereas Ser-25 most probably was not involved. Overexpression of PhLPL in a 4-fold excess over PhLPS or PhLPLA18–20 reduced the inhibition of the latter to the level exerted by PhLPL alone (Fig. 6 C), suggesting that PhLPL competed with PhLPS for inhibiting Gβγ. A 4-fold overexpression of PhLPL over PhLPS was controlled by Western blots (data not shown). Finally, we asked whether the observed phenomenon of PhLP regulation via N-terminal phosphorylation or splicing might play a role in different mouse organs, which had been described to contain considerable amounts of PhLPL (heart and brain) (4Thibault C. Feng Wang J. Charnas R. Mirel D. Barhite S. Miles M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1444: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar,5Schröder S. Lohse M.J. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2000; 362: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and which might also contain PhLPS (adrenal gland) (6Gensse M. Vitale N. Chasserot-Golaz S. Bader M.F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In addition, embryos were chosen because CK2 plays an essential role in developing cells and cell cycle progression (13Pinna L.A. Meggio F. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1997; 3: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Therefore, we expected to detect a high level of phospho-PhLPL. PhLPL was detected by Western blotting in all three organs as well as in day 10.5 embryo and also in control (empty vector) transfected HEK 293 cells (Fig. 7 A). In contrast, PhLPS was present in clearly detectable amounts only in the adrenal gland and in HEK 293 cells after transfection of the PhLPS cDNA (Fig. 7 A). After longer exposure of the film, PhLPS seemed to be present also in heart and brain but not in HEK 293 cells or embryo (data not shown). In most instances, PhLPL ran as a doublet, one band corresponding to the position of recombinant PhLPL purified from E. coli (Fig. 7, A and B, lower arrowhead) and one to the position of cellular PhLPL(Fig. 7, A and B, upper arrowhead). Because the presence of phosphate moieties is known to change the gel mobility, we wondered whether the mutation in Ser-18, Thr-19, and Ser-20 (PhLPLA18–20) would lead to a similar gel mobility shift (Fig. 7 B). Indeed PhLPLA18–20 corresponded to the lower band in brain and adrenal gland as well as recombinant PhLPL purified from E. coli(Fig. 7 B). HEK 293 cell lysate and mouse brain lysate were then treated with λ-PPase, which has been described to efficiently remove phosphates from serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues (29Zhuo S. Clemens J.C. Hakes D.J. Barford D. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17754-17761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This resulted in the loss of the PhLPL high molecular mass form as detected by Western blotting, whereas the low molecular mass form of PhLPL became detectable in HEK 293 cells and was enhanced in mouse brain (Fig. 7 C). The contention that the upper band represents phosphorylated PhLPL was supported by the observation that phosphorylation of PhLPL by CK2in vitro caused a reduction of gel mobility (Fig. 7 D). Together, these data demonstrate that there is constitutive phosphorylation of PhLPL in different mouse tissues and that in brain and adrenal gland non-phosphorylated PhLPL seems to play a role. G-protein function is regulated by different classes of proteins, most notably the RGS proteins and the members of the phosducin family. The members of the phosducin family bind to the Gβγ-subunits (30Lee R.H. Lieberman B.S. Lolley R.N. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3983-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 31Gaudet R. Bohm A. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) and therefore inhibit G-protein function. This might result in the disruption of the G-protein cycle, (32Müller S. Straub A. Schröder S. Bauer P.H. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11781-11786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 33Bauer P.H. Lohse M.J. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1998; 357: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and/or in the inhibition of Gβγ-mediated effects like activation of PLCβ isoforms and G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (9Yoshida T.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22546-22551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this work, we used the activation of a Gβγ-dependent phospholipase Cβ2 in HEK 293 cells as a functional readout of Gβγ-inhibition to demonstrate that PhLP inhibits Gβγ-functions in living cells. According to present knowledge, PhLP exists in two isoforms: 1) the long variant PhLPL with an additional N terminus of 83 amino acids and 2) the short variant PhLPS, which lacks this N terminus (Figs. 5 A and8) (1Miles M.F. Barhite S. Sganga M. Elliott M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10831-10835Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, the functional differences of these two isotypes in living cells remained to be elucidated, because (a) in vitro experiments showed that the short form, which lacks one Gβγ-binding region according to structural data (Fig. 8) (31Gaudet R. Bohm A. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), exhibited a markedly reduced binding affinity toward Gβγ-subunits compared with PhLPL and phosducin (2Schröder S. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2100-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 5Schröder S. Lohse M.J. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2000; 362: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and (b) tissue levels of the PhLP isoforms appropriate for a physiological role in Gβγ-inhibition could only be demonstrated for the long form, PhLPL (4Thibault C. Feng Wang J. Charnas R. Mirel D. Barhite S. Miles M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1444: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 5Schröder S. Lohse M.J. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2000; 362: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This finding appeared to suggest that the physiological Gβγ-regulator should be the long form, PhLPL. Our present data show that in contrast to this hypothesis, PhLPS is an effective regulator of Gβγ-function in HEK 293 cells. The yeast phosducin homolog resembles PhLPS in size and domain structure (Fig. 8), suggesting that important Gβγ-regulating properties are contained in these proteins. Furthermore, our data suggest that the different forms of PhLP cooperate in inhibiting Gβγ to a variable extent in that the phosphorylated form of PhLPL appears to have a partial dominant negative effect on the inhibitory function of PhLPS. PhLPS was found in mouse adrenal gland in amounts comparable with the levels of PhLPL in mouse brain and heart. In the latter organs, tissue levels of PhLPL have been calculated to be sufficient for in vivo regulation of G-proteins (5Schröder S. Lohse M.J. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2000; 362: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The detection of PhLPS in adrenal glands is in line with its purification from bovine chromaffin cells (6Gensse M. Vitale N. Chasserot-Golaz S. Bader M.F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These findings underline the contention that not only PhLPL but also PhLPS is a relevant physiological regulator of G-protein function. In the case of phosducin, it has been shown that G-protein inhibition is subject to regulation by phosphorylation by several kinases, most notably PKA (7Lee R.H. Brown B.M. Lolley R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15860-15866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Bauer P.H. Müller S. Puzicha M. Pippig S. Obermaier B. Helmreich E.J. Lohse M.J.

A PKA consensus motif is also present in PhLP (amino acids 117–121 in PhLPL: GKMT*L) 2Asterisk in sequence denotes potential phosphorylation site. but does not appear to serve as a PKA site in vitro or in vivo. However, in HEK 293 cells as well as in mouse organs, PhLPL is apparently constitutively phosphorylated in its N terminus at Ser-18, Thr-19, and Ser-20. CK2 is an ubiquitously expressed and constitutively active serine-threonine kinase (12Allende J.E. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 13Pinna L.A. Meggio F. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1997; 3: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), which has recently been found to constitutively phosphorylate arrestin-3, another protein of the G-protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway (36Kim Y.M. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16837-16846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Here, we report that recombinant PhLPL but not PhLPS or phosducin were substrates of CK2 phosphorylation, whereas PKA phosphorylated only phosducin. Therefore, we conclude that the different members of the phosducin family are differentially regulated by different kinases. Further evidence that CK2 is a regulatory kinase for PhLPL comes from the findings that (a) Ser-18, Thr-19, and Ser-20 contain the consensus motif for CK2, (b) mutation of the consensus sites into alanines resulted in a non-phosphorylated form in intact cells, (c) progressive N-terminal truncation or serine/threonine to alanine mutation at these sites both converted PhLPL into a protein with the same potency and efficacy as PhLPS, and (d) phosphorylation of PhLPL by kinase activity from HEK cell lysates was inhibited by two different CK2-specific inhibitors, whereas other kinase inhibitors did not result in inhibition. Taken together, these findings indicate a regulatory function of the N terminus of PhLPL and underline the role of N-terminal regulation of the members of the phosducin family. Our data also show that PhLP isoforms differ in the mode of activity control and that the Gβγ-inhibitory effects of PhLPL are subject to regulation via the N-terminal domain. Phosphorylation of the N terminus, in vivo most probably by CK2, diminishes the ability of PhLPL to inhibit Gβγ-functions. The analysis of PhLP expression in mouse organs shows that both mechanisms are usedin vivo."

The 12-lipoxygenase blocker, baicalein, prevents epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced activation of protein kinase C (PKC) α and β in lens epithelial cells, whereas supplementation with 12(S)HETE reverses this effect, suggesting that EGF and 12(S)HETE may work together to activate PKC. This study investigates the mechanism of PKCβ activation by EGF and 12(S)HETE. 12(S)HETE alone directed translocation of PKCβ through the C1 rather than the C2 domain, without activating phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) or MAPK signaling or increasing intracellular calcium concentration. In the presence of baicalein, EGF triggered an asymmetric phosphorylation of the EGF receptor initiating signaling through PI3K and MAPK, but not PLCγ. Together, 12(S)HETE and EGF synergistically increased phosphorylation of PKCβ in the activation loop and C terminus as well as PKCβ-specific activity. PI3K inhibitors blocked phosphorylation, but MEK1 inhibitors did not. Microvesicles containing phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate mimicked the action of EGF on PKCβ activity in the presence of 12(S)HETE. Kinase-inactive PKCβ mutations in either activation loop or C terminus were effectively translocated by 12(S)HETE, as was PKCβ in the presence of chelerythrine or Gö-6983. These findings indicate that unphosphorylated PKCβ is translocated to the membrane by 12(S)HETE and phosphorylated by EGF-dependent PI3K signaling, to generate catalytically competent PKCβ. 12(S)-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12(S)HETE) is a bioactive metabolite of arachidonic acid synthesized by 12-lipoxygenase.

Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2001; 20: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although 12(S)HETE is synthesized primarily in platelets and leukocytes, a number of other cell types have some capacity to make this hydroxylipid, including the epithelial cells of the lens and cornea (3Lysz T.W.

Previous studies from this laboratory found that inhibitors of endogenous 12(S)HETE synthesis prevent EGF-dependent DNA synthesis and c-fos mRNA induction in cultured lens epithelial cells. This effect was specifically reversed by exogenous 12(S)HETE, but not by closely related HETEs, suggesting that 12(S)HETE plays an essential role in regulating lens cell proliferation (6Arora J.K. Lysz T.W. Zelenka P.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Res. 1996; 37: 1411-1418PubMed Google Scholar, 7Haque M.S. Arora J.K. Dikdan G. Lysz T.W. Zelenka P.S. Mol Vis. 1999; : 5PubMed Google Scholar). Further investigation of the role of 12(S)HETE showed that the selective lipoxygenase inhibitor, baicalein, prevented EGF-induced activation of classic PKC isoforms, PKCα and PKCβ (8Seth R.K. Haque M.S. Zelenka P.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 3239-3246PubMed Google Scholar), raising the possibility that a cooperative effect of EGF and 12(S)HETE is needed for full activation of PKC in these cells. In addition, because inhibition of the classic PKC isoforms was sufficient to block both c-fosmRNA induction and DNA synthesis, these findings pinpointed PKC as an important target of 12(S)HETE action in regulating lens epithelial cell proliferation (8Seth R.K. Haque M.S. Zelenka P.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 3239-3246PubMed Google Scholar). Structural studies of the classic PKC isoforms (PKCα, β, and γ) have identified several functional domains (9Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 10Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). These include an autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate domain at the N terminus, the C1 domain, containing a diacylgycerol binding site (11Oancea E. Meyer T. Cell. 1998; 95: 307-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), the C2 domain, containing binding sites for both anionic lipids and calcium (12Johnson J.E. Giorgione J. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1136-11369Google Scholar), an activation loop adjacent to the active site, and the C-terminal domain. The classic PKC isoforms require diacylglycerol and calcium as well as PtdSer for full activity. In contrast, amino acid replacements at certain key residues in the C2 domain of the novel PKC isoforms (PKCδ, ε, η, and θ) has made these isoforms insensitive to calcium signals, whereas changes in both the C1 and C2 domains of the atypical isoforms (PKCζ and ι) have rendered these isoforms insensitive to both calcium and diacylglycerol (9Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 10Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). However, all isoforms require PtdSer or other acidic phospholipids for activity. Activation of PKC involves both phosphorylation of the enzyme at the activation loop and C terminus and translocation to the membrane, where it interacts with its lipid cofactors, PtdSer and diacylglycerol. Phosphorylation at the activation loop seems to be catalyzed by the phospholipid-dependent kinase, PDK1 (13Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 14Balendran A. Hare G.R. Kieloch A. Williams M.R. Alessi D.R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 6461-6468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of PKC is thought to introduce a conformational change, which allows it to respond to lipid second messengers, such as diacylglycerol (18Edwards A.S. Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6461-6468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Upon binding at the membrane, an additional conformational change removes the autoinhibitory substrate domain from the active site and the enzyme becomes catalytically active (9Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 10Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Because previous studies of lens epithelial cells had suggested that EGF and 12(S)HETE may cooperate in some way to activate PKCα and PKCβ, the present study was undertaken to investigate the mechanism of this effect, using a GFP-tagged PKCβ fusion protein to study the respective effects of 12(S)HETE and EGF on translocation, phosphorylation, and activation. The results indicate that the synergistic effect of EGF and 12(S)HETE on PKCβ activation is due to 12(S)HETE-dependent translocation of unphosphorylated PKCβ to the cytoplasmic membrane, where it is phosphorylated by a PI3K-dependent mechanism activated by EGF. Wortmannin, LY294002, PD 98059, and the PepTag nonradioactive PKC assay kit were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), ionomycin, and chelerythrine chloride were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). 12(S)HETE, baicalein, Gö-6983, and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) were from BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). EGF was from Invitrogen (Rockville, MD). Polyclonal anti-PKCβ antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against phosphorylated sites in PKCβ C terminus, EGF receptor, and phosphorylated sites in EGF receptor as well as PI3K and MAPK signaling sampler kits were all purchased from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (Beverly, MA). Monoclonal and polyclonal anti-GFP antibodies were from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Rabbit polyclonal (P500) antibody directed against the phosphorylated activation loop of PKCβ was a gift from Dr. Alexandra C. Newton (Department of Pharmacology, University of California, San Diego, CA). Calcium indicator, Fluo-3 ester, was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). The rabbit lens epithelial cell line, N/N1003A (a gift from Dr. John Reddan, Oakland University, Rochester, MI), was cultured at 35 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 1 mm glutamine, 8% heat-inactivated rabbit serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For PKC activity assay, cells were plated in 75-mm flasks in an initial density of 2 × 106 cells. At 90–95% confluence, the medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM for 24 h, and the endogenous PKCβ or stably expressed PKCβ-GFP was precipitated with anti-PKCβ or anti-GFP antibodies. For confocal observation of GFP-tagged PKCβ translocation, cells were cultured in a glass-bottomed chamber (LabTek-II Chamber Coverglass, VWR International, Bridgeport, NJ) and transfected with PKCβ-GFP (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using FuGENE transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). After 48 h, transfected cells were visualized with a Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). For immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting of PKCβ or PKCβ-GFP, N/N1003A cells were cultured in six-well plates. In all experiments, the cells were incubated with baicalein (30 μm) 8 h before stimulation to block the endogenous synthesis of 12(S)HETE. To check whether PI3K or MAPKs participate in the EGF-induced PKCβ phosphorylation, cells were pretreated with either PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin, LY294002, or the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 for 30 min. The preparation of constructs with mutations in either activation loop or C terminus of PKCβ-GFP was done with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene Corp. (La Jolla, CA). The changed bases are underlined. The oligonucleotides used for introducing the T500A, T641A, and S660A mutations in pEGFP-PKCβ were as follows (5′ → 3′): for T500A, GGTGACAACCAAGGCATTCTGTGGCACTCC (15 cycles, 95 °C, 30 s; 50 °C, 30 s; and 60 °C, 14 min); for T641A, CCATCCACCAGTCCTAGCACCTCCTGACCAGGAAG (16 cycles, 95 °C, 30 s; 50 °C 1 min; and 65 °C, 14 min); for S660A, CAGAATTCGAAGGATTTGCCTTTGTTAACTCTGAATTTTTAAAAC (16 cycles, 95 °C, 30 s; 50 °C 1 min; and 65 °C, 14 min). For introducing the double mutation in the C terminus, mutant T641A was used as a template for synthesis of the S660A mutation. The T500A, T641A, and T641A/S660A mutation sites were confirmed by full sequencing and then prepared in large quantity. For constructing truncated C1 and C2 domains of PKCβ, the two fragments were amplified by PCR withpfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using primers that introduced flanking restriction sites for EcoRI andBglII. The primers for amplification of C1 (residues 17–172) and C2 (residues 171–267) domains are as follows (5′ → 3′): for C1, sense/ATGGGGGCCCGGTACCTTGGGGCGGGCCAC and antisense/CGGAATTCCCCACGCCGCAAAGGGAGGGCACGCTGCGCAC; for C2, sense/GAAGATCTATGGGGGCCCTAGAGCGCCGTGGACGTCTGC and antisense/CGGAATTCTGGTACCTCTCGCCCTCCTCCTGGTTCAGTAACTTG. The two PCR products were purified and cut with EcoRI andBglII, and the digested fragments were cloned into pEGFP-N3 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Transient transfection into N/N1003A cells was performed by FuGENE transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's standard protocol (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). Plasmids encoding wild-type or mutated PKCβ-GFP or GFP-tagged truncated C1 or C2 domains were transfected into 6 × 106 cells. After the transfection, cells were cultured at 35 °C to obtain the optimal fluorescence of GFP, and experiments were performed 2 days after the transfection. N/N1003A cells were transiently transfected with PKCβ wild-type, T500A, T641A, and T641A/S660A, respectively, by FuGENE transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN). Clones were selected based on G418 (400 μg/ml) resistance, and GFP fluorescence was checked under a fluorescence microscope (Axioscope, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) to confirm the stability of expression. Whole-cell lysates were prepared by lysing cells in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1.0% Triton X-100 (v/v), 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholic acid, and 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (w/v). Cells were scraped off the plate, transferred to a microcentrifuge tube on ice, and sonicated in a cold-water bath. Lysates were kept on ice for 15 min and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resultant supernatants were stored at −80 °C for immunoblot analysis. Subcellular fractions for immunoblotting and PKC activity assays were prepared as previously described (8Seth R.K. Haque M.S. Zelenka P.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 3239-3246PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was performed as previously described (19Negash S. Wang H.S. Gao C. Ledee D. Zelenka P. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2109-2117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKCβ-GFP-transfected cells were spread onto the glass-bottomed chamber (LabTek-II, Ashland, MA) and cultured for at least 36 h. Serum-containing medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM 24 h before experiments. PKCβ-GFP fluorescence was measured by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Leica TCS SP2, Leica Microsystems) using 488-nm argon laser excitation, a 500-nm RSP dichroic filter, and a 500- to 550-nm emission spectrum. Reagents were diluted directly into the serum-free medium to obtain the appropriate final concentration, and real-time images were collected to monitor PKCβ-GFP movement. Images were collected at room temperature. Protein concentration was measured by the bicinchoninic acid method (BCA Protein Assay Reagent kit, Pierce, Rockford, IL). Aliquots of fractions containing 20 μg of protein were mixed with an equal volume of 2× loading buffer, electrophoresed on 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (0.45-μm pore size, Novex, San Diego, CA) for 90 min at 400 mA as described previously (20Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). After transfer, membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 5% skim milk (Difco, Detroit, MI) in TBST (15 mm Tris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, with 0.05% Tween 20). After blocking, membranes were probed with specific primary antibodies according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Antibodies used were as follows: PKCβ (1:500) mouse monoclonal (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), rabbit polyclonal antibody to Erk1/2 and phospho-44/42 Erk1/2 (T202/Y204) (1:1000), and rabbit polyclonal antibody to Akt or phospho-Akt (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA). The immunoblots were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature on a shaking platform, washed three times with TBST, and incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, either anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG, (1:2500, New England BioLabs) for 30 min at room temperature. Specific immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Plus, Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). Chemiluminescence was quantified by densitometric scanning of x-ray films with image analysis software (ImageQuaNT Scientific Software, version 5.0, Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The PepTag assay utilizes a brightly colored, fluorescent peptide substrate that is highly specific to PKC (Promega). Phosphorylation by PKC changes the net charge of the substrate from +1 to −1, thereby allowing the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated versions of the substrate to be separated on an agarose (0.8%) gel. The phosphorylated species migrates toward the positive electrode, whereas the nonphosphorylated substrate migrates toward the negative electrode. The phosphorylated peptide in the band can then be visualized under UV light. Immunoprecipitated PKC was incubated with PKC reaction mixture (25 μl) according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega) at 30 °C for 30 min. The reactions were stopped by placing the tubes in a boiling water bath for 10 min. After adding 80% glycerol (1 μl), the samples were loaded onto an agarose gel (0.8% agarose in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The samples were separated on the agarose gel in the same buffer at 75 V for 25 min, and the bands were visualized under UV light and quantified by ImageQuaNT Scientific Software (version 5.0, Amersham Biosciences). Intracellular Ca2+ was monitored with Fluo-3 AM, a membrane-permeable long wavelength fluorescence indicator. N/N1003 cells were plated in glass-bottomed chambers (LabTek-II Chamber Coverglass, VWR International, Bridgeport, NJ) and cultured in the standard medium for 24 h. The cells were loaded with acetoxymethyl ester of Fluo-3 (5 μm) for 30 min; after loading, a period of at least 30 min elapsed before experimentation to allow for de-esterification of the intracellularly accumulated Fluo-3 AM. A Leica TCS-SP2 laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Germany) was used to visualize Ca2+-mediated fluorescence in the cells. Fluo-3 was excited with the 488-nm line of an argon laser, and Fluo-3 fluorescence was collected between 524 and 540 nm. Scanning was performed every 10 s for a total of 20 min after treatment with 12(S)HETE (800 nm) or EGF (15 ng/ml). For quantitative measurements, scanning was performed every 30 s for 40 min, and the ratio of fluorescence intensity to initial fluorescence intensity (F/F 0) was calculated at each point. Data were collected on 14 cells, and the results were averaged. To examine the effect of 12(S)HETE and EGF on PKCβ activation, we immunoprecipitated both endogenous PKCβ and exogenous GFP-tagged PKCβ from the membrane fraction of N/N1003 cells and measured its activity using the PKC peptide substrate, PepTag. We also calculated the specific enzymatic activity of PKCβ by normalizing the relative level of phosphorylated PepTag to the relative amount of PKCβ in the immunoprecipitate, as determined by immunoblotting. The results showed that EGF (15 ng/ml) in the presence of baicalein (30 μm) did not significantly increase either the phosphorylation of the PepTag substrate (Fig. 1 A, upper panel) or the amount of PKCβ in the membrane fraction (Fig. 1 A,lower panel). Treatment with 12(S)HETE (300 nm) increased the amount of PKCβ in the membrane fraction and increased the phosphorylation of the PepTag substrate somewhat but produced no increase in the specific enzymatic activity of PKCβ (Fig. 1, A and B). However, combining 12(S)HETE (300 nm) with EGF (15 ng/ml) significantly enhanced PepTag phosphorylation and produced an ∼2-fold increase in the specific enzymatic activity of PKCβ (Fig. 1,A and B). These results confirm that 12(S)HETE and EGF have a synergistic effect on PKCβ activation. For further studies of this effect, we established a cell line that stably expresses GFP-tagged PKCβ. The GFP tag was fused with the C terminus of PKCβ (Fig. 2 A), because this fusion protein has previously been shown to retain full catalytic competence (21Sakai N. Sasaki K. Ikegaki N. Shirai Y. Ono Y. Saito N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1465-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of PKCβ-GFP with monoclonal anti-GFP antibody confirmed that its behavior was indistinguishable from that of endogenous PKCβ with respect to activation in the presence and absence of 12(S)HETE (Fig. 1 B, lower panel).Figure 2Co-application of 12(S)HETE (300 nm) with EGF (15 ng/ml) does not enhance PKC β translocation to the membrane.

B, time series images showing accumulation of GFP fluorescence at the plasma membrane within 20 min after serum-deprived cells were treated with 12(S)HETE (upper panel), EGF (middle panel), or both 12(S)HETE and EGF in combination (lower panel).Scale bar, 25 μm. C, to quantify the time course of PKCβ-GFP redistribution, a translocation factor was calculated by comparing changes in the fluorescence intensity in two pre-assigned areas, one in the membrane and another in the cytosol (upper panel). 12(S)HETE and EGF in combination showed no synergistic effect on PKCβ-GFP membrane translocation within 20 min (lower panel). D, time series images showing C1-GFP (upper panel, scale bar, 25 μm) or C2-GFP (middle panel, scale bar, 50 μm) translocation and Fluo-3 fluorescence changes after treatment with 12(S)HETE (800 nm). This concentration of 12(S)HETE had no effect on C2-GFP translocation or Fluo-3 fluorescence (lower panel, scale bar, 45 μm), although both parameters responded rapidly to ionomycin (0.5 μm) after 12(S)HETE was washed out.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because translocation of PKC to the membrane is often considered sufficient for its activation, we next examined the effect of 12(S)HETE and EGF on PKCβ translocation, using real-time imaging to follow the movement of PKCβ-GFP in living cells. As in the above experiments, the cells were incubated with the selective 12-lipoxygenase inhibitor, baicalein (30 μm), to block the endogenous generation of 12(S)HETE (8Seth R.K. Haque M.S. Zelenka P.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 3239-3246PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, exogenous application of 12(S)HETE (300 nm) rapidly delivered GFP-tagged PKCβ to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2 B). PKCβ-GFP fluorescence began to localize at the plasma membrane about 10 min after 12(S)HETE addition and reached a plateau after about 15 min. In contrast, in the presence of baicalein, EGF (15 ng/ml) had no effect on PKCβ-GFP translocation, whereas 12(S)HETE plus EGF showed a time course of PKCβ translocation very similar to that seen with 12(S)HETE alone (Fig. 2 B). To quantify the time course of PKC translocation induced by 12(S)HETE and EGF, we calculated a translocation factor (R), defined as the difference between fluorescence intensity in the plasma membrane (I M) and cytoplasm (I C) divided by the intensity in the cytoplasm (I C). Thus, R=(IM−IC)/ICEquation 1 A time series of confocal images was taken, and the value ofR was calculated automatically by comparing the changes of the fluorescence intensity in two pre-assigned areas: one in the membrane (representing I M), another in the cytosol (representing I C) (Fig. 2 C). The results demonstrated that the rate and extent of translocation produced by 12(S)HETE and EGF in combination was indistinguishable from that produced by 12(S)HETE alone (Fig. 2 C). To investigate the mechanism underlying the 12(S)HETE-dependent translocation of PKCβ, we tested the effect of 12(S)HETE on GFP-tagged constructs of the truncated C1 and C2 domains of PKCβ. Previous studies have identified these domains as membrane targeting modules that mediate PKC translocation by binding with diacylglycerol and calcium, respectively (11Oancea E. Meyer T. Cell. 1998; 95: 307-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 12Johnson J.E. Giorgione J. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1136-11369Google Scholar, 22Ono Y. Fujii T.

Chem. 1993; 268: 23580-23584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In control experiments, TPA (1.5 μg/ml) induced a translocation of the C1-GFP domain to the membrane, where it remained for more than 20 min (not shown). Similarly, control experiments with ionomycin (0.5 μm) induced translocation of GFP-C2 (Fig. 2 D). In this case, however, the time course of translocation was very rapid, with membrane-associated fluorescence reaching a peak and returning to baseline within 60 s in most cells (Fig. 2 D). Interestingly, ionomycin (0.5 μm) also caused translocation of GFP-C1 to the membrane (data not shown). Because previous studies of the isolated C1 domain indicate that it binds to the membranes in a calcium-independent manner (12Johnson J.E. Giorgione J. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1136-11369Google Scholar), the response to ionomycin may reflect a calcium-dependent change in membrane lipids. Incubating cells in 300 nm12(S)HETE, a concentration that promoted translocation of full-length PKCβ-GFP (30/34 cells imaged) within about 14 min, had a weak effect on C1-GFP membrane translocation (2/15 cells imaged) and no effect on C2-GFP (data not shown). Increasing the concentration of 12(S)HETE to 800 nm strongly directed C1-GFP to the membrane (14/16 cells imaged) but had no effect on C2-GFP translocation (Fig. 2 D). These findings suggest that 12(S)HETE promotes the translocation of PKCβ by affecting either the lipid composition of the membrane or the lipid binding capacity of PKCβ, rather than by mobilizing Ca2+. In addition, the observation that higher concentrations of 12(S)HETE are needed for translocation of the isolated C1 domain than for the full-length protein suggests that interactions between C1 and other regions of PKCβ, such as the recently reported interaction between C1 and C2 (24Slater S.J. Seiz J.L. Cook A.C. Buzas C.J. Malinowski S.A. Kershner J.L. Stagliano B.A. Stubbs C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15277-15285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), may facilitate membrane binding. In view of the inability of 12(S)HETE to direct the translocation of the calcium-responsive C2 domain, we next tested whether 12(S)HETE has any effect on cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels. To measure changes in cytoplasmic calcium, we loaded N/N1003A cells with the membrane-permeable calcium indicator, Fluo-3 ester, and monitored the Ca2+-dependent fluorescence by real-time imaging, sampling every 10 s for 20 min. Application of 12(S)HETE (800 nm) had no effect on intracellular Ca2+ levels (Fig. 2 D). Thus, 12(S)HETE seems to mediate translocation of PKCβ through a preferential effect on the C1 domain, which is not accompanied by changes in intracellular calcium. The EGF receptor undergoes tyrosine autophosphorylation in its intracellular domain after binding with EGF (25Grant S. Qiao L. Dent P. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: d376-d389Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated tyrosine residues then serve as docking sites for recruitment of different signaling molecules"

Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) 1The abbreviations used are: HDV, hepatitis delta virus; SSB, single-stranded DNA-binding protein; aa, amino acid(s); nt, nucleotide(s); oligo, oligonucleotide; snRNA, small nuclear RNA; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA is a satellite virus of hepatitis B virus. The genome of HDV comprises single-stranded circular RNA of ∼1700 nucleotides, and HDV RNA replicates through a symmetrical rolling circle mechanism (1Wang K.S. Choo Q.L. Weiner A.J. Ou J.H. Najarian R.A. Thayer R.M. Mullenbach G.T. Denniston K.L. Gerin J.L. Hoighton M. Nature. 1986; 323: 508-515Google Scholar). Hepatitis delta antigen is the only protein coded by HDV that is critical for viral replication (2Chao M. Hsieh S.Y. Taylor J.M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5066-5069Google Scholar) and virion assembly (3Glenn J.S. Watson J.A. Havel C.M. White J.M. Science. 1992; 256: 1331-1334Google Scholar), although the molecular mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. HDV RNA, of both genomic and antigenomic senses, contains a ribozyme domain that can adopt a pseudoknot-like structure and undergo cis-cleavage in vitro (4Kuo M.Y.P. Sharmeen L. Dinter-Gottlieb G. Taylor J.M. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 4439-4444Google Scholar, 5Wu H.N. Lin Y.J. Lin F.P. Makino S. Chang M.F. Lai M.M.C. Proc. Natil. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1831-1835Google Scholar, 6Perrotta A.T.

The cis-cleaving activity is essential for generating monomeric size RNA molecules during viral replication (8Macnaughton T.B. Wang Y.J. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2228-2234Google Scholar, 9Jeng K.S. Daniel A. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2403-2410Google Scholar). Hepatitis delta antigen may enhance, although it is not required for, the processing of multimeric size HDV RNA in vivo (10Jeng K.S. Su P.Y. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4205-4209Google Scholar). Conceivably, hepatitis delta antigen by itself, or together with unidentified cellular factors, acts as an RNA chaperone that modulates the ribozyme activity of HDV RNA. RNA chaperones are defined as proteins that aid in the folding of RNA by preventing misfolding or by resolving misfolded structures (11Herschlag D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20871-20874Google Scholar). The RNA chaperone activities in vitro of several proteins that interact with RNA with broad specificity have been explored through their effect on ribozyme reactions. These proteins, including severalEscherichia coli ribosomal proteins (12Coetzee T. Herschlag D. Belfort M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1575-1588Google Scholar), the C-terminal domain of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 protein (13Bertrand E.L. Rossi J.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2904-2912Google Scholar), and the nucleocapsid protein of human immunodeficiency virus (14Tsuchihashi Z. Khosla M. Herschlag D. Science. 1993; 262: 99-102Google Scholar, 15Herschlag D. Khosla M. Tsuchihashi Z. Karpel R.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2913-2924Google Scholar), can overcome the general limitations of ribozyme reactions and facilitate ribozyme catalysis. Proteins with RNA chaperone activity are thought to lower the activation energy necessary for breaking and reforming of base pairs, although the molecular mechanism underlying RNA chaperone activity is not known. In vitro, hepatitis delta antigen can modulate the cis-cleaving activities of HDV genomic RNA fragments and facilitate a trans-acting hammerhead ribozyme to find its target in RNAs of various sequences and lengths (16Huang Z.S. Wu H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26455-26461Google Scholar). Hepatitis delta antigen exerts its effect on these RNA-mediated processes by modifying the conformation of RNA molecules and by promoting strand annealing and strand dissociation. These properties of hepatitis delta antigen parallel many cellular proteins and viral proteins with RNA/nucleic acid chaperone activity (12Coetzee T. Herschlag D. Belfort M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1575-1588Google Scholar, 13Bertrand E.L. Rossi J.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2904-2912Google Scholar, 14Tsuchihashi Z. Khosla M. Herschlag D.

The functional domain of hepatitis delta antigen appears to locate at the N-terminal region that is rich in basic amino acids and contains the cryptic RNA binding domain, coiled-coil domain, and nuclear localization signal (16Huang Z.S. Wu H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26455-26461Google Scholar). The core of the functional domain overlaps with the coiled-coil domain, whereas the RNA binding domain that binds HDV RNA specifically is not required for the RNA chaperone activity (16Huang Z.S. Wu H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26455-26461Google Scholar). Here we investigated further the basis of the stimulatory effect of the N-terminal domain of hepatitis delta antigen, named as NdAg, on RNA structural rearrangement. The results confirm and extend our previous model. The results showed that NdAg could promote the annealing of a variety of complementary sequences and stabilize RNA duplexes. NdAg preferentially stimulated the formation of a more extended duplex among competing sequences by facilitating strand annealing and strand exchange in a selective fashion. Moreover, NdAg was able to facilitate a trans-acting hammerhead ribozyme to discriminate a completely matched from a non-completely matched target in a substrate RNA, but may not alter the structure of a stable RNA molecule. The selective strand annealing and selective strand exchange activity of NdAg may be important for modulating the folding of viral RNA for replication and transcription. The N-terminal region (residues 1–88) of hepatitis delta antigen, named as NdAg, was produced in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells and purified by phosphocellulose column chromatography as described previously (16Huang Z.S. Wu H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26455-26461Google Scholar). Fractions containing NdAg were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. The concentration of NdAg was determined by ninhydrin assay with lysine as standard. NdAg was diluted to the desired concentrations with protein dilution buffer (50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 1 mNaCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and 20% glycerol) and used as 10× stock. T4 phage gene 32 protein (T4gp32) and E. colisingle-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) were purchased from AmershamBiosciences. RNA oligos 11, 14, 17, and 22 and DNA oligos A, B, and C were chemically synthesized. Short unlabeled nucleic acid oligos were used directly without purification. DNA oligos A and B were gel-purified. The concentration of each nucleic acid fragment was determined by its absorbance at 260 nm. Carrier-free 5′ end-labeled RNA oligo 22 and DNA oligo C were made using [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). These 5′ end-labeled nucleic acid fragments were purified from polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels, and their concentrations were calculated from the radioactivity of each fragment and the specific activity of [γ-32P]ATP. HH16 and HH163 RNAs were synthesized by T3 RNA polymerase (Promega) with synthetic DNAs as templates. HJ12L RNA, Rz1.H2 RNA, KSS3 RNA, yeast U4 and U6 snRNAs, and P9 RNA were run-off transcripts of the T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) with restriction enzyme-linearized plasmid DNA as templates. These RNAs were internally labeled by incorporating [α-32P]CTP to in vitro transcription reactions and then purified from polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels. The concentration of labeled RNA was calculated from the radioactivity of RNA and the specific activity of CTP. The cellular RNA of E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells was isolated by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the instructions from the manufacturer. φX174 virion ssDNA and φX174 replication form dsDNA were purchased from New England Biolabs. Nucleic acid concentrations were determined according to their absorbance at 260 nm. All nucleic acids were resuspended in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mm EDTA) and stored at −20 °C. Complementary RNA oligos, complementary DNA oligos, or U4 and U6 snRNAs were heated separately at 95 °C for 2 min, cooled to room temperature, and incubated at the reaction temperature for at least 5 min before use. In general, 10-μl reaction mixtures contained indicated amounts of nucleic acid fragments and NdAg or other protein in 1× reaction buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1m NaCl, 0.02 mm EDTA, 2% glycerol). Reactions were performed at different temperatures; timings initiated by the addition of NdAg or other protein unless otherwise indicated. Reactions were terminated by transfer to ice, and the addition of 2 μl of ice-cold stop solution (50 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 2.5% SDS, 25% glycerol, 0.01% xylene cyanol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue). Different nucleic acid species were resolved by electrophoresis through a native polyacrylamide gel in TBE buffer (89 mm Tris-HCl, 89 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA) with or without 0.1% SDS at 4 °C. Gels were dried and examined by autoradiography. The pre-annealed RNA duplex was made by mixing 0.5 μm32P-labeled oligo 22 with 2 μm complement in TE buffer. The RNA solution was heated at 95 °C for 2 min, cooled slowly (∼1 h) to room temperature, and stored at −20 °C until used. The 32P-labeled pre-annealed RNA duplex was diluted in TE buffer and mixed with or without a competing RNA oligo, in the presence or absence of NdAg in 10 μl of reaction buffer at room temperature. Timing was initiated upon the addition of NdAg, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of a 0.2 reaction volume of ice-cold stop solution. All of the reaction mixtures were kept on ice before analysis. Electrophoresis of the RNA samples and the subsequent data analysis were performed as described for the annealing assay. Tubes containing the pre-annealed RNA duplex in 10 μl of reaction buffer were transferred to a PCR machine and incubated for 3 min at each indicated temperature. One tube was removed at 5 °C intervals through the temperature range indicated, and 2 μl of ice-cold stop solution was added immediately to terminate the reaction. All of the reaction mixtures were kept on ice before analysis. Electrophoresis of the RNA samples and the subsequent data analysis were performed as described for the annealing assay. Hepatitis delta ribozymes HJ12L and Rz1.H2 were heated at 95 °C for 2 min, cooled to room temperature, and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min before use. RNA was pre-incubated with NdAg in 1× reaction buffer for 30 min at 37 °C, and the cis-cleavage reaction of HJ12L or Rz1.H2 was initiated by the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 12 mm. The reaction was performed at 37 °C for various periods of time. Further cis-cleavage was inhibited by the addition of an equal volume of quench solution containing 50 mm EDTA, 7 m urea, 0.005% xylene cyanol, and 0.005% bromphenol blue. RNAs in the ribozyme reaction mixture were analyzed on a 10% polyacrylamide, 7m urea gel. Hammerhead ribozyme and the KSS3 substrate RNA were separately heated at 95 °C for 2 min and then cooled to the reaction temperature for at least 5 min. The two RNAs were mixed and pre-incubated with NdAg in 1× reaction buffer for 30 min at 30 °C, and the trans-cleavage reaction was initiated by the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 12 mm. The reaction was performed at 30 °C for 15 min, after which samples were treated with 1 mg/ml proteinase K at 37 °C for 25 min. RNAs in the ribozyme reaction mixture were analyzed on a 15% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel. The radioactivity of each RNA fragment was determined by quantification using a PhosphorImager (ImageQuant; AmershamBiosciences). The relative amount of each RNA fragment was determined by dividing the radioactivity of the RNA fragment with the number of C residues in the RNA molecule; thus, the fraction of RNA undergoing cleavage was calculated. Previously we had shown that the N-terminal domain of hepatitis delta antigen (NdAg) modulates the cis-cleaving activity of HDV genomic RNA fragments and activates the trans-cleavage reaction between hammerhead ribozymes and cognate substrates in vitro(16Huang Z.S. Wu H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26455-26461Google Scholar). Conceivably, NdAg exerts its effect on RNA-mediated processes by acting as an RNA chaperone, promoting RNA re-folding by facilitating the breakage and reforming of base pairs. To further investigate the basis of RNA chaperone activity, purified NdAg was assayed for the ability to promote the annealing of complementary sequences in RNA oligos and complicated RNA molecules in dilute solutions, and to accelerate strand exchange between an RNA duplex and a competing sequence. To assay the stimulatory effect of NdAg on strand annealing, complementary oligos of low concentrations were mixed, and duplex formation was monitored. In the case of RNA oligos 22 (0.025 nm) and 11 (0.125 nm) (Fig. 1 A), there was only negligible duplex formation in the absence of NdAg, but the extent and the rate of duplex formation were significantly elevated in the presence of 1 μm NdAg (Fig.2 A). Thus, NdAg promoted the annealing of complementary RNA oligos.Figure 2Effect of NdAg on strand annealing/hybrid formation.

To address the question of the effect of Mg2+ on the strand annealing activity of NdAg, we performed the strand annealing reaction in the presence of MgCl2 and/or NdAg. We found that MgCl2 of 10–40 mm alone facilitated the annealing of RNA oligos 22 and 11, although its stimulatory activity was significantly lower than that of NdAg. Nevertheless, MgCl2 at this concentration range reduced, although it did not eliminate, the strand annealing activity of 1 μm NdAg (Fig. 2 A and data not shown). Annealing assays were done on other complementary nucleic acid pairs of 11–56 nt; NdAg facilitated the annealing of all nucleic acid pairs tested, including DNA-DNA, DNA-RNA, and RNA-RNA pairs (data not shown). In the case of DNA oligos A (43 nt), B (56 nt), and C (18 nt) (oligos A and C are complementary to different regions of oligo B; Fig.1 B), NdAg greatly promoted the formation of the trimolecular duplex and both bimolecular duplexes at low DNA concentrations (∼0.5 nm) (B/C and B/CA duplex data are shown in Fig.2 B). Furthermore, NdAg accelerated the hybridization of more complicated RNAs in addition to simple complementary nucleic acid pairs. 50–500 nm NdAg facilitated 0.5 nm U4 snRNA and 2.5 nm U6 snRNA to form U4/U6 hybrid that potentially contains two intermolecular base pairing regions (Figs. 1 C and2 C). All of the aforementioned simple complementary nucleic acid pairs hybridize spontaneously; however, U4 snRNA and U6 snRNA did not hybridize spontaneously at even up to 25 nm in the absence of NdAg (data not shown). This suggests NdAg influences the ability of complex RNAs to interact. Therefore, in addition to short complementary oligos, NdAg also promotes the annealing of the complementary sequences reside in longer or more complicated RNAs. To test whether non-homologous nucleotide sequences perturb the acceleration of strand annealing or hybrid formation stimulated by NdAg, we analyzed the hybridization of a constant amount of U4 snRNA (0.5 nm161-nt RNA, 80.5 nm nucleotide) and U6 snRNA (2.5 nm 112-nt RNA, 280 nm nucleotide)) in the presence of increasing amounts of a non-homologous P9 RNA (a 160-nt run-off transcript of pET15b vector) at 100, 250, or 500 nmNdAg. As shown in Fig. 3 A, for a 360 nm nucleotide concentration of U4 snRNA (0.5 nm RNA, 80.5 nm nucleotide) and U6 snRNA (2.5 nm RNA, 280 nm nucleotide), U4/U6 hybridization was not inhibited until the molar ratio of total nucleotide (the sum of two snRNAs and P9 RNA) to NdAg exceeded 5:1, and at higher molar ratios (>5:1), U4/U6 hybrid did not form. The result suggests that there is a finite amount of NdAg available to facilitate duplex hybridization with a limiting ratio of one NdAg to five nucleotides. To confirm this finding, we performed strand annealing reactions of DNA oligos A and B at low concentrations (total nucleotide was ∼5 nm) in the presence of a relatively high concentration of NdAg (1 μm) and increasing concentrations of three kinds of nucleic acid: E. coli cellular RNA, φX174 ssDNA and φX174 dsDNA. As shown in Fig. 3 B, B/A duplex formation was not affected by the E. coli cellular RNA or φX174 ssDNA until the total nucleotide concentration exceeded 5 μm, whereas the presence of φX174 dsDNA did not fully inhibit the annealing of oligos A and B at even 12 μm total nucleotide. These results support the notion that the binding site size of an NdAg monomer is ∼5 nucleotides, and suggests that complementary strand annealing can occur in the presence of a 100–1000-fold excess of non-homologous sequence as long as the amount of NdAg is sufficient to coat the non-homologous sequences and the complementary nucleic acid pair. The acceleration of strand annealing/hybrid formation associated with NdAg is not specific for any particular type of nucleic acid. Hence, NdAg interacts with nucleic acid with broad specificity. We tested whether two other general nucleic acid-binding proteins share similar strand annealing properties with NdAg. We found that E. coliSSB (single-stranded nucleic acid-binding protein) and T4 phage gp32 protein at a concentration range of 1–10 μm failed to promote U4/U6 hybrid formation or to stimulate DNA or RNA duplex formation (data not shown). In addition, the stimulatory effect of 50 nm NdAg on U4/U6 hybrid formation was not perturbed in the presence of a 20-fold excess of T4 phage gp32 protein, a 50-fold excess of E. coli SSB, or a 200-fold excess of bovine serum albumin (Fig. 4). Thus, NdAg can facilitate strand annealing/hybrid formation in the presence of these two nucleic acid-binding proteins. These results indicate that the stimulation of strand annealing is not a general property of nucleic acid-binding proteins. We next examined the stimulatory effect of NdAg on the annealing of RNA oligos of different lengths to a common sequence. RNA oligos 11, 17, and 22 were used for this study (Fig. 1 A). Both oligos 11 and 17 are complementary to oligo 22. Oligo 17 has the same sequence as oligo 11 but also has a 2-nt extension at the 5′ terminus and a 3-nt extension at the 3′ terminus. Hence, oligo 17 can form a 17-base pair duplex with oligo 22, whereas oligo 11 can form an 11-base pair duplex with oligo 22. In the presence of 1 μm NdAg, the kinetics of annealing of oligos 22 and 17, and oligos 22 and 11 were quite similar, and the duplex formation reaction of both pairs of oligos reached an equilibrium within 10 min at 30, 37, and 42 °C (data not shown). The melting temperatures of the 22/11 duplex and 22/17 duplex were ∼50 and ∼65 °C, respectively, under annealing reaction conditions (Fig. 5 A). The competitive strand annealing reaction was performed in the presence of 0.025 nm32P-labeled oligo 22 and 0.5 nm oligos 11 and 17 at temperatures below theTm of each duplex. In the absence of NdAg, only a small fraction of oligos formed duplexes at 30, 37, or 42 °C. Moreover, the amount of 22/11 duplex was slightly higher than that of 22/17 duplex at each temperature, and both duplexes were stable at 42 °C (Fig. 5 B). In the presence of 1 μmNdAg, all of oligo 22 participated in duplex formation. However, oligo 22 annealed more favorably to oligo 17 at 30 and 37 °C, and exclusively to oligo 17 at 42 °C (Fig. 5 B). Moreover, the relative amount of 22/17 and 22/11 duplexes at each incubation temperature was not changed when the reaction time varied between 10 and 180 min (data not shown). Thus, NdAg promotes the formation of a more extended duplex among competing sequences, with the activity higher at 42 °C than 30 and 37 °C. Therefore, hypothetically NdAg facilitates strand annealing or stimulates duplex dissociation in a selective manner. We next monitored the ability of NdAg to promote strand exchange between an RNA duplex and a competing RNA oligo (Fig.6). The pre-annealed32P-labeled 22/11 duplex (0.25 nm) was mixed with a 100-fold excess of oligo 17 (25 nm). In the absence of NdAg, the pre-annealed duplex gradually dissociated over a 30-min period, with the released 32P-labeled oligo 22 concurrently forming a duplex with oligo 17. Consequently, the32P-labeled 22/11 duplex was converted to the32P-labeled 22/17 duplex (Fig. 6 A). In the presence of NdAg, the conversion of 22/11 duplex to 22/17 duplex occurred at an elevated rate at least during the first 10 min of the reaction (Fig. 6 A). Thus, in this experiment, NdAg facilitated strand exchange. However, a strikingly different result was obtained when the assay was performed using two other combinations of pre-annealed RNA duplex and a competing RNA oligo in the presence of NdAg. The data in Fig. 6 (B and C) show that strand exchange between a pre-annealed 22/14 duplex (0.25 nm) and oligo 11 (25 nm) as well as between a pre-annealed 22/17 duplex (0.25 nm) and oligo 11 (25 nm) was not observed in the presence of 1 μmNdAg; each pre-annealed duplex was stabilized by NdAg instead. In the absence of NdAg, there was a build-up of 22/11 duplex after 10 min, whereas the conversion of the pre-annealed duplex to 22/11 duplex was not completed. Because 22/14 duplex and 22/17 duplex contain more base pairs than 22/11 duplex, NdAg appears to promote strand exchange only when the formation of a more extended duplex occurs. These results suggest that NdAg promotes strand exchange in a selective fashion, and excludes the only role of NdAg in the strand exchange process as being the promotion of the dissociation of the pre-annealed duplex. Furthermore, the strand exchange reaction was also performed in the presence of MgCl2 with or without NdAg. We found that 1 μm NdAg speeded up the strand exchange reaction between 22/11 duplex and RNA oligo 17 in the presence of 0–5 mmMgCl2 but failed to facilitate the conversion of 22/11 duplex to 22/17 duplex in the presence of 10 or 20 mmMgCl2 (Fig. 6 D). The studies with the synthetic nucleic acid oligos disclose that NdAg promotes strand annealing and strand exchange in a selective fashion, with this property allowing NdAg to stimulate the formation of the most stable duplex among complementary sequences. This finding led us to speculate that NdAg could assist a contiguous sequence in adopting a stable structure, which may not be biologically active, and that NdAg would not alter the structure of a stable RNA. Here we investigated these speculations by studying the effect of NdAg on an RNA that contains the autolytic domain of the HDV genome and a cis-acting hepatitis delta ribozyme mutant that has a more stable structure than its wild type counterpart. Because hepatitis delta ribozyme has to adopt a specific catalytic structure, the alteration of autocatalytic activity upon NdAg treatment reflects ribozyme structure change. HJ12L contains the autolytic domain of the HDV genome, and Rz1.H2 is a hepatitis delta ribozyme mutant that has had its helix 1 substituted, the helix 2 extended from 5 to 8 base pairs, and the helix 4 replaced by a stable hairpin loop (Fig.7 A). Rz1.H2 cis-cleaved efficiently and rapidly in the absence of NdAg, whereas HJ12L was much less active under the same conditions (Fig. 7 B). The extended helix 2 rather than the alterations in helixes 1 and 4 of Rz1.H2 may account for the elevated cis-cleaving activity under native conditions, because we showed previously that the elongation of helix 2 enhances the resistance to formamide and stabilized the catalytic core of hepatitis delta ribozymes (17Lee C.B. Lai Y.C. Ping Y.H. Huang Z.S. Lin J.Y. Wu H.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12303-12312Google Scholar). Moreover, in the experiment shown in Fig. 7 B, we found that pre-mixing with NdAg prior to the initiation of cis-cleavage did not alter the cis-cleavage reaction of Rz1.H2, whereas the same treatment attenuated the cis-cleaving activity of HJ12L. The results indicate that NdAg modified the structure of HJ12L but not Rz1.H2 and that the interaction with NdAg does not alter the catalysis of Rz1.H2. The finding supports the hypothesis that NdAg does not modify the structure of a stable RNA. We then used the trans-cleavage reactions of a hammerhead ribozyme HH16 to further study the RNA chaperone activity of NdAg. The trans-cleavage reaction of a hammerhead ribozyme involves at least two steps. First, the ribozyme anneals to its target in a substrate RNA for the assembly of a hammerhead catalytic domain; then, cleavage occurs at a specific location by the catalysis of divalent cations (18Hertel K.L. Herschlag D. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3374-3385Google Scholar). KSS3 is a 107-nt RNA containing three targets for the hammerhead ribozyme HH16 (Fig.8 A). The first target has a C to A substitution; hence, upon binding to HH16, the helix I of the reconstituted hammerhead catalytic domain contains an AG mismatched pair. The second and the third targets are completely matched to HH16; each can form 16 base pairs with HH16. HH163 is a mutant of HH16 and has a G to U substitution to compensate for the mutation of the first ribozyme target of KSS3 (i.e. no mismatch; Fig.8 A). We showed previously that NdAg promotes the trans-cleavage reaction of HH16 and all its targets in KSS3 under ribozyme excess conditions, with NdAg appearing to exert its effect by elevating the mutual accessibility of two RNAs (16Huang Z.S. Wu H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26455-26461Google Scholar). Here, we found that >95% of KSS3 was cleaved by HH16 and HH163 when 1 nmKSS3 and 10 nm of each ribozyme were pre-incubated with 1 μm NdAg prior to the initiation of trans-cleavage (Fig.8 B). Furthermore, the major products of the two ribozymes were the same; they were the 49-, 23/22-, and 13-nt RNAs, with none of them containing any ribozym"

The reaction center (RC)1 of purple bacteria is a membrane protein complex consisting of L, M, H, and cytochrome subunits. The L and M subunits, which are significantly homologous to each other, form a heterodimer in the membrane and bind bacteriochlorophylls, bacteriopheophytins, and quinines, which work in the transfer of electrons across the membrane (1Lancaster C.R.D. Ermler U. Michel H. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 503-526Google Scholar). The cytochrome subunit, which contains four c-type hemes, is bound to the LM core at the periplasmic side and works as the electron donor to the photooxidized special pair of bacteriochlorophylls in the RC (1Lancaster C.R.D. Ermler U. Michel H. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 503-526Google Scholar). One of two quinone molecules bound to the RC diffuses out of the RC after receiving two electrons and two protons. The cytochromebc 1 complex and water-soluble electron carrier proteins, such as cytochrome c 2, mediate the electron transfer from the doubly reduced quinone (quinol) molecule to the oxidized c-type hemes in the cytochrome subunit (2Meyer T.E. Donohue T.J. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 725-745Google Scholar). Some species, such as Rhodobacter sphaeroides, Rhodospirillum rubrum, and Rhodopseudomonas palustris, have another type of RC complex in which the cytochrome subunit is absent. The L and M subunits of RC are encoded by the pufL andpufM genes, respectively, which form an operon calledpuf together with the pufB and pufAgenes that encode the β and α subunits of the light-harvesting 1 complex. In species containing the RC-bound cytochrome subunit, thepufC gene coding for this subunit is located immediately downstream of the pufM gene. Amino acid sequences derived from the nucleotide sequences of the pufC genes of purple bacteria contain four CXXCH sequence motifs to bind c-type hemes (3Nagashima K.V.P. Sakuragi Y. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Photosynth. Res. 1998; 55: 349-355Crossref Google Scholar), with an exception in the Rhodovulum species (4Masuda S. Yoshida M. Nagashima K.V.P. Shimada K. Matsuura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10795-10801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The hemes have been numbered as heme-1 to heme-4 according to the order of the appearance of the respective binding motifs in the amino acid sequence (5Weyer K.A. Lottspeich F. Gruenberg H. Lang F.

Its crystal structure showed that the four c-type hemes are arranged in a roughly linear manner, almost perpendicularly to the membrane. The spectrophotometric and thermodynamic properties of the four hemes and their arrangement in the structure have been extensively studied (11Dracheva S.M. Drachev L.A. Konstantinov A.A. Semenov A.Y.

The four hemes have high-low-high-low midpoint potentials from the special pair to the periplasmic space. They are distinguishable in terms of the peak positions in their α-absorption bands. A gene manipulation system for B. viridis was established previously (17Laußermair E. Oesterhelt D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 777-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and some studies had been done using site-directed mutagenesis manipulated into the LM core complex and into the cytochrome subunit of B. viridis (18Chen I.P. Mathis P. Koepke J. Michel H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3592-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). B. viridiscannot be inoculated aerobically and grows with a doubling time of 24 h under microaerobic respiratory conditions (17Laußermair E. Oesterhelt D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 777-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The very low growth rate makes it difficult to obtain a sufficient number of the mutant strains of B. viridis. The expression of the B. viridis cytochrome subunit gene in Escherichia colicells was also challenged. However, it resulted in the accumulation of the inclusion body without heme incorporation (19Grisshammer R. Oeckl C. Michel H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1088: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The cytochrome subunit of Rubrivivax gelatinosus, which belongs to the β-subclass of purple bacteria, has also been studied and shown to be similar to that of B. viridis in terms of the redox potentials of hemes (20Nitschke W. Agalidis I. Rutherford A.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1100: 49-57Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). R. gelatinosus grows well under respiratory conditions (about 2 h of the doubling time) as well as under photosynthetic conditions (about 2.5 h of the doubling time); therefore, it is easy to introduce mutations into the photosynthetic apparatus (21Nagashima K.V.P. Shimada K. Matsuura K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The photosynthetic growth rate of theR. gelatinosus mutant lacking the cytochrome subunit was about a half of that of the wild type, showing that the cytochrome subunit is not essential but is advantageous for photosynthesis (21Nagashima K.V.P. Shimada K. Matsuura K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Based on the mutational replacements of charged amino acid residues distributed on the surface of the subunit, Osyczka et al.(22Osyczka A. Nagashima K.V.P. Sogabe S. Miki K. Yoshida M. Shimada K.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15779-15790Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) have shown that the low potential heme-1 located at the most distant position from the special pair is a direct electron acceptor from the soluble electron carrier, which suggests that all four hemes are involved in the electron transfer to the special pair. Several water-soluble electron carrier proteins are present in the periplasmic space of R. gelatinosus. Three of these proteins (high potential iron-sulfur protein (HiPIP), high potential cytochromec 8, and low potential cytochromec 8), have been shown to work as the electron donors to the RC-bound cytochrome (25Schoepp B. Parot P. Menin L. Gaillard J. Richaud P. Verméglio A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11736-11742Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 26Osyczka A. Yoshida M. Nagashima K.V.P. Shimada K. Matsuura K.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15238-15244Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The physiological electron donor to the B. viridis RC is the cytochromec 2. The ionic strength dependence studies on the reaction of the cytochrome c 2 with theB. viridis RC have suggested that the heme-1 of the cytochrome subunit is the primary electron acceptor from the cytochrome c 2 (28Knaff D.B. Wille A. Long J.E. Kriauciunas A. Durham B. Millett F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1303-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, direct evidence for the precise interaction mechanisms between the soluble electron donor and heme-1 in B. viridis is not yet available. In this study, the gene for the cytochrome subunit of R. gelatinosus was replaced by that of B. viridisusing a common restriction site at a conserved DNA region in both species. The mutagenized cells of R. gelatinosus produced a chimeric RC complex containing the cytochrome subunit derived fromB. viridis and the other subunits from the host. The chimeric RC was isolated and characterized. R. gelatinosus strain IL144RL2, which is a spontaneous mutant of the wild-type strain IL144 and shows greatly depressed production of the light-harvesting 2 complex, was used as a host strain for gene manipulations in this study. The R. gelatinosus strain ΔC constructed in a previous study was also used in this study, in which thepufC gene was knocked out by insertion of a kanamycin resistance gene (22Osyczka A. Nagashima K.V.P. Sogabe S. Miki K. Yoshida M. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11732-11744Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). R. gelatinosus strains were grown under aerobic-dark or anaerobic-light conditions at 30 °C with a PYS medium (21Nagashima K.V.P. Shimada K. Matsuura K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). B. viridis cells were grown under anaerobic-light conditions at 30 °C in a malate-basal salt medium containing 0.5% sodium malate, 0.1% yeast extract (Difco), 0.1% ammonium sulfate, 1% basal salt solution (29Nagashima K.V.P. Hiraishi A. Shimada K. Matsuura K. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 45: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), 0.1% vitamin solution (29Nagashima K.V.P. Hiraishi A. Shimada K. Matsuura K. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 45: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). E. coli strain JM109 was used as a host for plasmids and grown aerobically with a Luria-Bertani medium or an SOB medium at 37 °C (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). When needed, ampicillin, kanamycin, or chloramphenicol was added to the E. coli and R. gelatinosus cultures at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. The plasmid pGELPUF containing the 4.6-kb whole puf operon of R. gelatinosus was created by connecting two DNA fragments, pGH37 and pGI7, previously cloned from the genomic DNA library of R. gelatinosus strain IL144 (31Nagashima K.V.P. Matsuura K. Ohyama S. Shimada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2477-2484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 3.7-kb region flanked byNotI restriction sites within the puf operon ofR. gelatinosus was replaced by an ampicillin resistance gene. This plasmid was named pΔPUF2 (Fig. 1 A) and used for construction of the R. gelatinosus mutant lacking thepuf operon. A 2.5-kb DNA fragment flanked byBamHI restriction sites and containing the 3′-region ofpufM and the entire pufC of B. viridiswas cloned from the genomic library of B. viridis DNA using a pUC119 plasmid as a cloning vector. This plasmid was named p9VP3 (Fig. 1 B). The nucleotide sequence of pufC in the p9VP3 plasmid was confirmed to be identical to that previously reported for the B. viridis pufC (5Weyer K.A. Lottspeich F. Gruenberg H. Lang F. Oesterhelt D. Michel H. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2197-2202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both the genes for the M subunits of R. gelatinosus and B. viridis have a common SalI restriction site at the conserved 3′-regions. The region downstream of this SalI site in the insert DNA of the plasmid pGELPUF was removed and replaced by the DNA fragment containing the region downstream of the corresponding SalI site of the p9VP3 plasmid, in which the entire pufC ofB. viridis was contained (Fig. 1 B). The DNA fragment containing this “chimeric” puf operon was cloned into a pHSG298 plasmid. The p2GPVC-KF plasmid was thus obtained. A frameshift did not occur in this “chimeric” pufoperon. The presumed pufM product derived from this plasmid was expected to have the N-terminal 292 amino acids of the R. gelatinosus M subunit and the C-terminal 34 amino acids from theB. viridis M subunit. DNA manipulation and hybridization were carried out according to a manual on molecular cloning (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or according to instructions supplied by the enzyme manufacturers. Plasmid DNAs were introduced into R. gelatinosus cells by means of electroporation, according to the methods previously described (21Nagashima K.V.P. Shimada K. Matsuura K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Cells in the late logarithmic growth phase were harvested by centrifugation at 7,200 × g for 20 min, washed, and suspended in 10 mm MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.0). The cells were disrupted by passage through a French pressure cell at 1100–1200 kg/cm2 in the presence of a few grains of DNase I. The disrupted cell suspension was centrifuged at 28,000 × g for 15 min to remove the debris and ultracentrifuged at 340,000 × g for 20 min. The sediment was used as the membrane preparation. The cytochromec 2 of B. viridis and HiPIP ofR. gelatinosus were isolated from the remaining supernatant according to the methods previously reported (26Osyczka A. Yoshida M. Nagashima K.V.P. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1321: 93-99Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The protein content in the membrane was determined with a Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad), using bovine serum albumin (fraction V) as a standard protein. Reduced-minus-oxidized difference spectra were measured with a UV-3000 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu). Two millimolar (final concentration) of potassium ferricyanide or a few grains of sodium dithionite were added for the oxidation or the reduction of the membrane preparations. SDS-PAGE was carried out according to Laemmli (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The proteins with a concentration of 5 mg/ml were denatured in 1% SDS by boiling for 1 min. Ten micrograms of protein was applied to each lane of the gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was treated with Coomassie Brilliant Blue using a Quick-CBB Kit (Wako, Japan) for staining the proteins or treated with TMBZ for detection of the hemes according to the method of Thomas et al. (33Thomas P.E. Ryan D. Levin W. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). The membranes prepared were suspended in a buffer containing 10 mmMOPS-NaOH (pH 7.0) to give an absorbance of 40 at 875 nm. The suspension was mixed with an equal volume of precooled 1.6% (v/v) β-d-octylthioglucoside and incubated on ice for 40 min with stirring. Subsequently, the suspension was applied on the top of a sucrose density gradient (from top to bottom, 10–40%, w/v) containing 10 mm MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.0) and 0.05% Triton X-100 and ultracentrifuged at 146,000 × g for 20 h. A brownish red band that formed at a sucrose density of about 25% was recovered as an RC fraction and concentrated with Centriflo CF25 membrane cones (Amicon). The RC fraction was diluted with a buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 20 mm MOPS-KOH (pH 7.0), and 0.05% Triton X-100. Xenon flash-induced absorption changes were measured with a single beam spectrophotometer designed and assembled in our laboratory (34Matsuura K. Shimada K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 852: 9-18Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The membranes were suspended in a 20 mm MOPS-KOH buffer (pH 7.0) containing 100 mmKCl, 1 mm sodium ascorbate, and 10 μm DAD. The concentrations of the samples were adjusted to give an absorbance of 1 at 860 nm for the R. gelatinosus strain ΔC, at 875 nm for other R. gelatinosus strains, and at 1012 nm forB. viridis. One micromolar valinomycin was added to the membrane preparation of the R. gelatinosus strain ΔC to reduce the effect of the band shift of carotenoids responding to the membrane potential. The kinetics of an electron transfer from the soluble electron donor to the RC was measured in a buffer containing 5 mm MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.0). The R. gelatinosus HiPIP and the B. viridis cytochrome c 2 were added at the final concentrations of 1 μm. One millimolar sodium ascorbate, 10 μm DAD, and 0.03% Triton X-100 were also added. Redox titration of hemes in the RC-bound cytochrome c was carried out as described previously (35Dutton P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 226: 63-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) using a double beam spectrophotometer UV-3000 (Shimadzu). The redox potential was monitored with an Ag/AgCl electrode (TOA) connected to an HM-40S voltmeter (TOA). The concentration of the sample was adjusted to give an absorbance of 2 at 875 nm for R. gelatinosus and at 1012 nm for B. viridis. The buffer for the measurements contained 100 mm KCl, 20 mm MOPS-KOH (pH 7.0), and 0.05% Triton X-100. The redox mediators used are as follows: 100 μm potassium ferrocyanide, 10 μm DAD, 100 μm Fe-EDTA, 10 μm phenazine methosulfate, 10 μm vitamin K3, 10 μm2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, and 3 μm pyocyanine. The oxygen was eliminated by a continuous stream of nitrogen gas. At the beginning of the measurements, the suspension was reduced by the addition of a solution of sodium ascorbate or sodium dithionite. Subsequently, the redox potential was raised stepwise by additions of a solution of potassium ferricyanide. The plasmid pΔPUF2, which contains a kanamycin resistance gene and the R. gelatinosus puf operon disrupted by the insertion of an ampicillin resistance gene (Fig. 1 A), was introduced into the cells of the R. gelatinosus strain IL144RL2. A strain showing resistance to ampicillin but sensitivity to kanamycin was picked up after successive cultivation under the pressure of ampicillin and named DP2. An absorption spectrum of the membrane prepared from the strain DP2 cells showed no accumulation of the RC-light-harvesting 1 complex (Fig. 2). Southern hybridization, PCR, and DNA sequencing experiments for the genomic DNA isolated from the strain DP2 showed that the 3.7-kb NotI-NotI DNA region containing pufBALMC was replaced by the ampicillin resistance gene (data not shown), probably due to a double cross-over recombination between the genomic DNA and the pΔPUF2 plasmid. The strain DP2 could not grow photosynthetically. The plasmid p2GPVC-KF, which contains the majority of thepuf genes of R. gelatinosus and the entirepufC of B. viridis (Fig. 1), was introduced into the R. gelatinosus strain DP2 cells. A new strain showing resistance to kanamycin was obtained and named VC-F. The VC-F cells were able to grow under anaerobic light conditions, although the growth rate was about 3 times slower than that of the strain IL144RL2. An absorption spectrum of the strain VC-F membrane was nearly identical with that of the strain IL144RL2 membrane (Fig. 2), suggesting that the strain VC-F recovered the ability to synthesize the RC-light-harvesting 1 complex without significant alterations in the environments of the photosynthetic pigments. The presence of puf genes in the strain VC-F cells was confirmed by Southern hybridization experiments. The p2GPVC-KF plasmid was detected in the cell lysate of the strain VC-F and seemed to be reproducible in the VC-F cells. The synthesis of the RC-bound cytochrome subunit derived from theB. viridis pufC gene in the cells of the R. gelatinosus strain VC-F was examined by SDS-PAGE of the membranes, as shown in Fig. 3. The band patterns stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue were almost identical among the membrane samples of the three strains of R. gelatinosus. Minor differences between the patterns lower than 14 kDa for the strain ΔC and for two other strains, IL144RL2 and VC-F, may reflect the difference in the contents of the light-harvesting 2 complexes. In the gel stained for hemes, a peptide with a molecular mass of 43 kDa was detected in the membrane of the strain IL144RL2, which was assigned to the cytochrome subunit (36Fukushima A. Matsuura K. Shimada K. Satoh T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 933: 399-405Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). No heme-stained peptides were observed in the membrane of the strain ΔC, which lacks the cytochrome subunit (22Osyczka A. Nagashima K.V.P. Sogabe S. Miki K. Yoshida M. Shimada K. Matsuura K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11732-11744Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the membrane of the strain VC-F, a heme-stained peptide was detected at the 39-kDa molecular mass, which coincided with that of the RC-bound cytochrome subunit of B. viridis. This result suggested that the RC-bound cytochrome subunit derived from B. viridis was expressed in the R. gelatinosus strain VC-F. Fig. 4 shows the reduced-minus-oxidized difference spectrum in the α-absorption band region of the cytochromes c in the membrane of the strain VC-F, together with those of the strains IL144RL2 and ΔC ofR. gelatinosus and B. viridis. The difference spectrum of the strain IL144RL2 membrane, which has two low potential hemes that peaked at 551 nm and two high potential hemes that peaked at 555 nm in the cytochrome subunit, showed an absorption maximum at 552 nm, which was consistent with the results obtained from the wild type of R. gelatinosus shown in a previous study (36Fukushima A. Matsuura K. Shimada K. Satoh T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 933: 399-405Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the strain ΔC, the absorption bands derived from cytochromes were very small, as expected (21Nagashima K.V.P. Shimada K. Matsuura K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The broad and small bands detected in the strain ΔC membrane were probably due to the cytochromebc 1 complex. The membrane of the strain VC-F, on the other hand, showed a different spectrum with an absorption maximum at 553 nm with a shoulder around 559 nm, which was similar to that obtained for the membrane of B. viridis. Hemes contained in the cytochrome subunit of the R. gelatinosus strain VC-F were further characterized by redox titration (Fig. 5). Four redox components were detected when the peak heights of the α-absorption bands of the cytochromes c in the membrane preparation were plotted against the ambient potentials. When the data were fitted with Nernst equations, the redox midpoint potentials (E m values) of these components were estimated to be −60, +32, +320, and +419 mV in the membrane and −60, +32, +310, and +398 mV in the solubilized RC complex (Fig. 5). These values were consistent with those reported for the four hemes in the B. viridis cytochrome subunit (TableI). Fig. 6shows the reduced-minus-oxidized difference spectra of the four components in the strain VC-F membrane. Four c-type hemes with different absorption maxima in the α-band regions were resolved. The heme with the highest E m value showed a narrow α-band peaked at 559 nm with a shoulder at near 552 nm. The heme with the second highest E m had a somewhat broad α-band peaked at 556 nm. The two low potential hemes showed narrow α-bands with peaks at 552 and 553 nm. These spectral and redox characteristics in the strain VC-F were almost identical with those reported forB. viridis (11Dracheva S.M. Drachev L.A. Konstantinov A.A. Semenov A.Y. Skulachev V.P. Arutjunjan A.M. Shuvalov V.A. Zeberezhnaya S.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This indicated that the environments surrounding the hemes in the cytochrome subunit in the strain VC-F were almost the same as those in the original RC complex of B. viridis.Table IRedox and spectral properties of hemes in cytochrome subunits of R. gelatinosus and B. viridisHeme1-aNumbering of hemes was based on the appearance in the amino acid sequence (5).Reference/source1234Cytochrome subunit of R. gelatinosus peak position in α-band (nm)1-bWavelength of absorption maximum in the redox difference spectrum measured in this study.551555555551 R. gelatinosus Strain IL144RL2+64+281+348+64This work Fukushima et al.+90+330+330+90Ref. 36Fukushima A.

The values of the redox midpoint potentials in R. gelatinosus IL144RL2 were +64 mV for the two low potential hemes peaking at 551 nm and +281 and +348 mV for the two high potential hemes peaking at 555 nm. These E m values were consistent with those for the R. gelatinosusstrain IL144 (36Fukushima A. Matsuura K. Shimada K. Satoh T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 933: 399-405Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and for the R. gelatinosus strain 52 (20). Thus, the redox midpoint potentials of the four hemes determined in the strain VC-F and their spectra in the α-band region were clearly different from those in R. gelatinosus IL144RL2. Fig. 7 shows flash-induced absorption changes in the α-band region of the cytochromes c in the membranes prepared from the cells of R. gelatinosus strains and B. viridis. For these measurements, the two high potential hemes in the cytochrome subunit were reduced prior to the flash activation by the addition of 1 mm sodium ascorbate. In the membrane of the strain VC-F, rapid oxidation of the cytochrome was observed, as in the membranes of R. gelatinosus IL144RL2 and B. viridis. The flash-induced spectra derived from this rapid oxidation showed a peak at 556 nm in the membranes of the strain VC-F and B. viridis, indicating that the second high potential heme, c556 (heme-2), was oxidized by the flash. In the flash-induced absorption change of the cytochromes in the membrane of the strains IL144RL2, the major oxidized component showed a peak at 553 nm. This suggested that the low potential hemes peaked at 551 nm in the IL144RL2 cytochrome subunit were partially reduced prior to the flash activation possibly due to their relatively high redox potentials. No remarkable peaks were observed in the flash-induced spectrum in the membrane preparation of the strain ΔC due to the lack of the cytochrome subunit. Fig. 8 shows the kinetics of the electron transfer from the soluble electron carrier proteins to the cytochrome subunit in the prepared membrane. When the R. gelatinosusHiPIP was added, re-reduction of the cytochrome was observed with a second order rate constant of 1.82 × 10−7 in the IL144RL2 membrane but not in the membranes of the strain VC-F andB. viridis. This suggested that HiPIP, which is the physiologically main electron donor to the oxidized cytochrome subunit in the R. gelatinosus wild-type cells, was not a good electron donor to the RC in the strain VC-F cells. When theB. viridis cytochrome c 2 was added to the membrane of the strain VC-F, re-reduction of the RC-bound cytochrome and concomitant oxidation of the cytochromec 2 were observed with a second order rate constant of 7.75 × 10−6, which was comparable with the value obtained from the measurement for the B. viridismembrane, 5.05 × 10−6. The membrane of the strain IL144RL2 did not show an apparent electron transfer reaction with theB. viridis cytochrome c 2. In this study, the RC-bound cytochrome subunit of B. viridis was shown to be synthesized in the distantly related species of purple bacteria, R. gelatinosus. Measurements of spectra and flash-induced redox changes of the cytochromes cshowed that the B. viridis cytochrome subunit was not only synthesized in R. gelatinosus but also functioned as the rapid electron donor to the photooxidized special pair. This means that the B. viridis cytochrome subunit can form a functional “chimeric” RC complex together with the R. gelatinosusLM core polypeptides. This was somewhat surprising, since the amino acid sequence identities of the L, M, and cytochrome subunits betweenB. viridis and R. gelatinosus are only 66, 61, and 45%, respectively. It has been reported in the fine structure of the B. viridis RC that 30 amino acids in the cytochrome subunit are bound to the LM core via hydrogen bonds and salt bridges (10Deisenhofer J. Epp O. Sinning I. Michel H. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 429-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). These amino acids are indicated with the primary structure shown in Fig. 9. In the cytochrome subunit of R. gelatinosus, only 8 of these 30 amino acids are conserved, based on the comparison of the amino acid sequences. Some of the amino acid residues located near the binding residues are absent in the R. gelatinosus cytochrome subunit (Fig. 9). These observations suggest that the local protein structure contributing to the binding should be different between the cytochrome subunits of B. viridis and R. gelatinosus. It is known that the cytochrome subunit of R. gelatinosus is easily dissociated from the LM core by a moderate detergent treatment (36Fukushima A. Matsuura K. Shimada K. Satoh T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 933: 399-405Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar), although that of B. viridisis tightly bound to the core, possibly reflecting the structural difference. The cytochrome subunit of B. viridis seemed to be tightly bound to the R. gelatinosus LM core in the strain VC-F, since the RC complex with the cytochrome subunit was successfully isolated from the membranes of the strain VC-F under conditions in which the subunit was dissociated from the core complex in the R. gelatinosus wild type. On the other hand, most of the amino acid residues connecting the cytochrome subunit, based on the fine structure of the B. viridis RC (10Deisenhofer J. Epp O. Sinning I. Michel H. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 429-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), were well conserved in the L (12 of 15 residues) and M (14 of 19 residues) subunits of R. gelatinosus (Fig. 9). The amino acid sequences around these residues also seemed to be well conserved. These findings suggest that the surfaces on the LM core that bind to the cytochrome subunit are similar in the two species and that the R. gelatinosus LM core can interact rather tightly with the B. viridis cytochrome subunit. In addition, the C-terminal residues of the M subunit may also contribute to the formation of the chimeric RC complex, since the C-terminal 34 amino acid residues after the 289th valine of the M subunit of the strain VC-F were derived from B. viridis. It has been suggested that the C terminus region of the M subunit is strongly associated with the cytochrome subunit in B. viridis as well as in other species (37Nitschke W. Dracheva S.M. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.T. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 775-805Google Scholar). Thus, the cytochrome subunit of B. viridis in the strain VC-F would be closely associated with the “chimeric” M subunit. It is known that the N-terminal 20 amino acid residues in the precursor form of the cytochrome subunit of B. viridis function as a signal peptide and are removed possibly after secretion for the periplasmic space (5Weyer K.A. Lottspeich F. Gruenberg H. Lang F. Oesterhelt D. Michel H. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2197-2202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal first amino acid of the mature form of the subunit is a cysteine residue, which is modified by two fatty acid molecules (38Weyer K.A. Schafer W. Lottspeich F. Michel H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2909-2914Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The sequence LVAGC at positions 17–21 in the precursor protein of B. viridis may be responsible for this modification and for the cleavage by signal peptidase II (38Weyer K.A. Schafer W. Lottspeich F. Michel H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2909-2914Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The cytochrome subunit of R. gelatinosus also has a similar motif, LLAGC, at positions 19–23 (31Nagashima K.V.P. Matsuura K. Ohyama S. Shimada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2477-2484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The post-translational modification shown in B. viridis presumably occurs in the cells of R. gelatinosus. Evidence for this comes from the results of SDS-PAGE, which showed that the mobility of a band corresponding to the B. viridis cytochrome subunit synthesized in the R. gelatinosus strain VC-F was identical with that in the B. viridis membrane, as shown in Fig. 3. The redox midpoint potentials and the spectroscopic characteristics of four hemes in the cytochrome subunit of the strain VC-F were almost the same as those in the original B. viridis complex. This result suggests that the association with the R. gelatinosus LM core did not significantly affect the electrochemical properties of the hemes, except possibly for hemec559. Thus, the cytochrome subunit derived from the B. viridis gene probably holds its original structure and functions in the chimerical RC complex in the R. gelatinosusstrains VC-F. The results of flash-induced spectrophotometric measurements in the membrane preparation of the R. gelatinosus strain VC-F indicated that the cytochrome subunit derived from B. viridis functioned as an efficient electron donor to the photooxidized special pair in the strain VC-F. The rate of electron transfer from soluble electron carriers to the hemes in the cytochrome subunit in the strain VC-F was largely different from that in the wild-type strains of R. gelatinosus. This can be explained by the fact that the major electron donor to the cytochrome subunit is cytochromec 2 in B. viridis but HiPIP inR. gelatinosus. A previous study showed that the R. gelatinosus HiPIP is a very poor electron donor to theB. viridis RC (39Osyczka A. Nagashima K.V.P. Sogabe S. Miki K. Shimada K. Matsuura K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24108-24112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Consistently, an addition of the R. gelatinosus HiPIP to the strain VC-F membrane had no detectable effects on the reduction of the cytochrome, as shown in Fig. 8. This may be one of the reasons that the growth rate of the strain VC-F is considerably lower than those of the wild-type strains under photosynthetic conditions. On the other hand, the B. viridiscytochrome c 2 worked as a good electron donor to the chimeric RC in the strain VC-F membrane, as observed for the native RC of B. viridis. The native structure of the B. viridis cytochrome subunit seems to be well maintained in theR. gelatinosus strain VC-F. Previous studies have shown that the cluster of acidic residues immediately surrounding the heme-1 of the RC-bound cytochrome subunit forms an electrostatically favorable binding site to cytochromes inR. gelatinosus (22Osyczka A.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15779-15790Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A comparison of the three-dimensional structure of the cytochrome subunit solved inB. viridis and that predicted for R. gelatinosussuggested that these species are different in the distribution of the acidic residues around the heme-1. As part of a future study, it will be interesting to introduce site-specific mutations to the chimeric RC to clarify the interaction between the cytochrome subunit and the cytochrome c 2 of B. viridis. Further physiological and kinetic studies and additional site-directed mutagenesis on the cytochrome subunit of the strain VC-F should be useful for the clarification of the precise mechanisms of the electron transfer and of the physiological roles of the cytochrome subunit. A great number of studies have been conducted on the cytochrome subunit of B. viridis, resulting in a significant body of available structural and kinetic information. This information and the system established for R. gelatinosus in this study have made it easier than before to obtain further information about the relationships between the structure and function in the electron transfer protein."
https://openalex.org/W2091652889,"The ST486 cell line, derived from a human Burkitt's lymphoma, is a model for antigen-induced clonal deletion in germinal center B-lymphocytes, with apoptosis induced upon cross-linking of surface IgM. Moreover, this cell line is highly sensitive to the induction of apoptosis by many chemicals, including sodium arsenite, a significant environmental contaminant with immunotoxic activity. In contrast to arsenite and other chemicals, surface IgM cross-linking induces apoptosis in ST486 cells with delayed kinetics. Moreover, the initial signaling events following IgM stimulation are associated with cell survival and proliferation and include activation of the extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. We examined the question of whether IgM-mediated activation of the ERK and PI3K pathways can influence the apoptotic response of ST486 cells following exposure to arsenite and selected drugs with different molecular targets, including cycloheximide, etoposide, and camptothecin, and a physical stress, hyperthermia. Our findings show that IgM-stimulated cells are significantly protected against arsenite and drug-induced apoptosis during a window of several hours after surface IgM cross-linking, as evidenced by an inhibition of cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and lack of morphological changes indicative of apoptosis. Significantly, surface IgM cross-linking also protects against arsenite-induced mitochondrial depolarization as well as caspase-9 cleavage. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this IgM-mediated protection requires the activation of the ERK and PI3K pathways, because inhibition of either pathway blocks the ability of antigen receptor activation to protect against apoptosis. Our study also provides evidence for p90S6 ribosomal kinase as a point of convergence between the two signaling pathways resulting in the phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bad at serine 112. This investigation demonstrates, for the first time, that specific signals transduced by activation of the B-cell receptor protect cells at a common point of regulation in the apoptotic pathways for diverse stresses."

The structures have led to more detailed hypotheses regarding the mechanisms by which force generation is coupled to ATP hydrolysis. However, the three-dimensional structure of double-headed myosin consisting of two S1 subfragments has not yet been solved. Therefore, to investigate the overall shape and relative orientations of the two heads of myosin, we performed small-angle x-ray and neutron scattering measurements of heavy meromyosin containing all three light chains (LC1–3) in solution. The resulting small-angle scattering intensity profiles were best fit by models of the heavy meromyosin head-tail junction in which the angular separation between heads was less than 180 degrees. The S1 heads of the best fit models are not related by an axis of symmetry, and one of the two S1 heads is bent back along the rod. These results provide new information on the structure of the head-tail junction of myosin and indicate that combining scattering measurements with high resolution structural modeling is a feasible approach for investigating myosin head-head interactions in solution.

Myosin II, the major contractile protein of muscle, consists of two globular catalytic domains, referred to as S1 subfragments, attached to a long coiled-coil rod. Insights into the mechanisms of contraction were provided by x-ray crystal structures of individual S1 fragments from several myosin isoforms (1Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.H. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Google Scholar, 2Xie X. Harrison D.H. Schlichting I. Sweet R.M. Kalabokis V.N. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C.

From these studies it is now apparent that each S1 can be divided into two subdomains; that is, a globular motor domain that contains separate actin and nucleotide binding sites and an unusual ∼8.5-nm α-helical segment, the so-called light chain binding domain, which connects the motor domain to the coiled-coil rod. ATP hydrolysis at the catalytic domain is thought to result in an angular rotation of the light chain binding domain that corresponds to the force-generating “power stroke” of the catalytic cycle of the enzyme (4Holmes K.C. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 112-118Google Scholar). Despite recent progress toward understanding the molecular basis of force generation, significant questions regarding the structure and function of myosin remain. In particular, since a high resolution structure for a two-headed myosin molecule is not yet available, comparatively little is known regarding potential head-head interactions or the arrangement at the S1/S2 junction, i.e.the region where each S1 domain joins the proximal (S2) section of the myosin rod. In smooth and invertebrate myosins, activation of ATPase activity is dependent on events occurring at this junction, such as Ca2+ binding or phosphorylation of the regulatory light chains, accessory proteins that bind the light chain binding domain near the S1/S2 junction. For these regulated myosins, activation appears to involve a significant conformational change that encompasses both head-head and head-tail interactions (5Wendt T. Taylor D. Messier T. Trybus K.M. Taylor K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1385-1389Google Scholar). By contrast, activation of unregulated myosins such as those of skeletal and cardiac muscle occurs primarily through events related to Ca2+ binding to the thin filament. Nonetheless, characteristics of the S1/S2 junction such as flexibility and angle of S1 attachment are still expected to have significant effects on the magnitude and rate of force generation. Consistent with this, regulatory light chain phosphorylation potentiates force and the rate of force development in skeletal muscle fibers (6Metzger J.M. Greaser M.L. Moss R.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 93: 855-883Google Scholar). Steric constraints or cooperative interactions between heads may also affect motor function in unregulated myosins. For instance, steric hindrance between the heads may result in nonequivalent actin binding affinities, potentially leading to cooperative binding (7Offer G. Elliott A. Nature. 1978; 271: 325-329Google Scholar, 8Conibear P.B. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 926-937Google Scholar). Similarly, cooperativity was implied by single molecule force and displacement measurements that indicated both heads are necessary for maximum force generation by myosin (9Tyska M.J.D.E.D. Guilford W.H. Patlak J.B. Waller G.S. Trybus K.M. Warshaw D.M. Lowey S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4402-4407Google Scholar). However, because spectroscopic (10Mendelson R.A. Morales M.F. Botts J. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 2250-2255Google Scholar) and electron micrograph studies (11Elliott A. Offer G. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 123: 505-519Google Scholar, 12Knight P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 269-274Google Scholar) suggest the S1/S2 junction is quite flexible, a structural basis for head-head interactions has been difficult to resolve. In this paper, we present low resolution structural data on the overall conformation of myosin in solution. Small-angle x-ray and neutron scattering experiments were performed on heavy meromyosin (HMM), 1The abbreviations used are: HMM, heavy meromyosin a soluble proteolytic fragment of myosin. Neutron scattering measurements were used to obtain structural information regarding the longest particle dimensions of HMM that were necessary to accurately describe and model the molecule. X-ray scattering measurements were used for comparison to confirm overall HMM configuration as well as to check for monodispersity in solution and assure there were no concentration-dependent interparticle interference effects that would bias the modeling. Comparisons of the neutron scattering intensity profiles with simulated spectra generated from an existing model of the head-tail junction of myosin (13Offer G. Knight P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 407-416Google Scholar) indicated that the model may not accurately represent the structure of HMM in solution. Instead, experimental small- angle scattering intensity profiles were reproduced by simple models in which the S1 heads were joined asymmetrically to a coiled-coil rod. Myosin was purified from rabbit back and leg fast twitch skeletal muscle according to Wagner and Giniger (14Wagner P.D. Giniger E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12647-12650Google Scholar). HMM was prepared by limited α-chymotryptic digestion of myosin according to Weeds and Pope (15Weeds A.G. Pope B. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 111: 129-157Google Scholar). To minimize degradation of regulatory light chain, myosin was digested in the presence of 2 mmMgCl2 at a myosin:chymotrypsin ratio of 400:1 for 6 min at 22 °C. After precipitation of rod fragments and undigested myosin in 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm dithiothreitol, HMM in the supernatant was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.2, and further fractionated by fast protein liquid chromatography over a Q-Sepharose ion exchange column. Peak fractions were pooled, mixed with an equal volume of glycerol, and stored at −20 °C before use (within 14 days) in scattering experiments. For x-ray scattering measurements, purified HMM was dialyzed extensively against experimental buffers containing 150 mmKCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Solutions of similar composition were used for neutron scattering experiments, except that D2O was used in place of H2O to increase scattering signal, which depends upon the scattering density difference between the protein and solution (16Wall M.E. Gallagher S.C. Trewhella J. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 2000; 51: 355-380Google Scholar). HMM scattering intensity profiles in H2O and D2O solutions were comparable, suggesting that HMM shape was not affected by the presence of D2O. For solutions containing divalent ions, 2 mm MgCl2 or 2 mm CaCl2was added to achieve ∼1 mm free Mg2+ or Ca2+. After dialysis, HMM samples were clarified by ultracentrifugation (150,000 × g, 45 min) and concentrated (3–30 mg/ml) using Centricon concentrators (Amicon). Concentration of HMM was estimated assuming 350 kDa for molecular mass and E 280 nm = 6.47 cm−1 (15Weeds A.G. Pope B. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 111: 129-157Google Scholar). Sedimentation velocity values for HMM were determined by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation as described (17Amann K.J. Guo A.W. Ervasti J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35375-35380Google Scholar). Thyroglobulin, catalase, aldolase, and albumin (Amersham Biosciences) were used as standards. 100 μg HMM or standard was layered onto a linear 5–20% (w/v) sucrose gradient in buffer containing 150 mm KCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm MgCl2. Samples were centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 90 min at 10 °C in a 65.1 VTi rotor. 0.5-ml fractions were collected, sucrose concentrations were measured, and proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The Stokes radius of HMM was determined by gel filtration chromatography using a Superose 6 fast protein liquid chromatography column and protein standards (albumin, catalase, ferritin, thyroglobulin, and laminin). HMM and standards were chromatographed in a solution containing 150 mm KCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mmMgCl2. Molecular weight was determined using the equation (18Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Google Scholar), Mr=(6πηNRs)/(1−νρ20·w)(Eq. 1) where η = 0.010019 g/s·cm, N = 6.02 × 1023, R s represents the Stokes radius (cm), s represents the sedimentation coefficient (Svedberg), ν represents partial specific volume (g/ml), and ρ20,w = 0.99823 g/ml. Small-angle x-ray scattering experiments were performed on the 2-m instrument at Los Alamos National Laboratory (19Heidorn D.B. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 909-915Google Scholar). The instrument uses a sealed x-ray tube to produce Cu-Kα x-rays (1.54 A, 8.5 keV) focused to a vertical line at the plane of a one-dimensional position-sensitive detector. Sample and buffer data were collected to produce intensity profilesI(q) versus q(q = 4π(sinθ)/λ, λ = wavelength, 2θ = scattering angle) by following published procedures (19Heidorn D.B. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 909-915Google Scholar). Theq range used for data analysis was 0.01–0.15 Å−1. Data collection times were typically 1–4 h, depending on the sample concentration, and the sample cell was maintained at a constant temperature (7 ± 1 °C) over the course of an experiment. To assess concentration dependence of scattering, scattering data were collected on a dilution series for each HMM protein sample and extrapolated at infinite dilution. Molecular weight, M r, was calculated by comparing the forward scattering (I 0) at infinite dilution to that of a standard of known molecular weight according to the following equation. Mr,unknown=(I0,unknown/I0,known)Mr,known(Eq. 2) Lysozyme (M r = 14.2 kDa, Sigma) (20Krigbaum W.R. Kugler F.R. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 1216-1223Google Scholar) was used as the protein standard. Neutron scattering data were collected on the NG3 30-m SANS instrument at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, MD. Data were reduced according to published methods (21Hammouda B. Barker J.G. Krueger S. Small Angle Neutron Scattering Manuals. National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD1996Google Scholar) to correct for detector sensitivity and sample background. The neutron wavelength was set to 5.5 Å with a wavelength spread Δλ/λ of 0.35 to maximize neutron flux. Sample-to-detector distances of 13.1 and 1.7 m were used to cover the appropriate q-range (0.003–0.025 and 0.021–0.27 Å−1, respectively). Intensity profiles for samples and corresponding buffers were collected at both detector distances to correct for background. HMM samples (8–10 mg/ml) and buffers were maintained at 10 °C throughout data collection. Typical data collection times were 4 h for the 13.1-m sample-to-detector distance and 30 min for the 1.7-m distance. The data from the two detector distances were merged using procedures included with the National Institute of Standards and Technology data reduction software. The higher contrast and lower measured minimum q value for the neutron scattering experiments meant that these data have significantly greater statistical precision and are able to more accurately determine the scale parameters of the large HMM molecule. Therefore, neutron scattering data were used for all model comparisons. The small-angle x-ray or neutron scattering from a homogeneous solution of monodisperse particles can be written as, I(q)=‖〈∫r(ρ(r)−ρs)e−iq·rd3r〉‖2(Eq. 3) where ρ(r) is the scattering length density of the scattering particle and ρs is the scattering length density of the solvent. q is the momentum transfer, having the magnitude given above. The integration over the particle volume is rotationally averaged, and the experiment measures the time and ensemble average for all particles in solution. In addition to traditional Guinier analysis (22Guinier A. Ann. Phys. (Paris). 1939; 12: 161-237Google Scholar) of the data for the radius of gyration, R g, the probable distribution of vector lengths within the scattering object,P(r), can be determined from the scattering intensity profile. I(q) andP(r) are related by the Fourier transform in Equation 4. I(q)=4π∫0∞dr·P(r)(sin(qr))/(qr)(Eq. 4) The 0th and second moments of P(r) gives the forward scatter (I 0) andR g values for the scattering object typically with greater precision than Guinier analysis because the calculations utilize the information in the entire measured scattering profile. The indirect Fourier transform algorithm implemented in the program GNOM (23Svergun D. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 485-492Google Scholar, 24Svergun D. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Google Scholar) was used to determine P(r) from the measured intensity (25Svergun D.I. Semeniuk A.V. Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR. 1987; 297: 1373-1377Google Scholar, 26Svergun D.I. Semeniuk A.V. Feigin L.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1988; 44: 244-250Google Scholar). A slit smearing correction was applied to the small-angle x-ray scattering data to correct for the instrument geometry. No correction for smearing was required for the neutron scattering data because the dimensions of the beam are adequately approximated as a point source for these experiments. To compare experimental scattering spectra with a published model of HMM structure (13Offer G. Knight P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 407-416Google Scholar), simulated scattering intensity profiles and P(r) functions were generated from the atomic coordinates of the model using software (PR_PDB) developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory (27Gallagher S.C. Callaghan A.J. Zhao J. Dalton H. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6752-6760Google Scholar). A second program developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory, called XTAL_STR (28Heller W.T. Abusamhadneh E. Finley N. Rosevear P.R. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15654-15663Google Scholar), was used to produce composite models that fit the scattering intensity profiles. The known structures can either be atomic coordinates, such as crystal structure coordinates or coordinates of points randomly distributed within the volume of a shape such as an ellipsoid. Composite model structures are made by randomly positioning and orienting the known structures with respect to one another. The program assumes that the density of each component structure is uniform to calculate P(r) from the coordinates of the substructures. P(r) is transformed intoI(q) through the transform defined in Equation 4. The quality of the fit of the model intensity profile to the experimental intensity profile is measured using F, a modification of the reduced χ-squared parameter, as defined in Equation 5. F=1Npts(∑Npts(I(q)−Im(q))2σ(q)2)(Eq. 5) Npts is the number of points in the data set,I(q) and Im(q) are the experimental and model intensity values, respectively, and ς(q) is the experimental uncertainty ofI(q). The set of known structures used for the modeling were generated from the Offer and Knight HMM model (13Offer G. Knight P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 407-416Google Scholar). The original model was broken into three sections, the two S1 heads and the coiled-coil tail. To obtain optimized models using the small-angle scattering data, XTAL_STR was used such that the subunits were constrained to remain in contact at fixed points. Model structures were produced by randomly rotating each substructure around the connection points. Thus, there were six degrees of freedom in the modeling done by XTAL_STR (two hinges with three Euler angles each). The published model has a truncated coiled-coil tail; therefore additional models with longer tails ranging from the length of the published structure (∼180 Å) up to 1500 Å were tested to find the length that best fit the data. The tail length used for the final modeling was ∼380 Å. Each XTAL_STR run tested in excess of 300,000 model iterations, and a single best fit model was selected from each run. Three independent runs of XTAL_STR were performed to determine the reproducibility of the modeling. Fig. 1 shows physical characteristics of purified HMM. In contrast to HMM produced by tryptic digestion, HMM produced by mild α-chymotryptic digestion is relatively homogenous (15Weeds A.G. Pope B. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 111: 129-157Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1,inset) showed that the HMM heavy chain migrated as a high molecular mass band at ∼140 kDa. All three light chain peptides were also evident as bands at ∼21 (LC 1), 19 (regulatory light chain), and 16.5 kDa (LC 3). The sedimentation coefficient (Fig. 1 A) and Stokes radius (Fig. 1 B) of HMM were determined by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation and gel filtration chromatography, respectively. A calculated value of 371 kDa for the molecular mass of HMM was obtained using sedimentation coefficient and Stokes radius values (see “Materials and Methods”). The value was similar to published values of HMM (15Weeds A.G. Pope B. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 111: 129-157Google Scholar) and is consistent with HMM being monodisperse in solution. Fig.2 A shows the neutron scattering intensity profiles obtained for HMM in solutions containing EDTA with and without added Ca2+ or Mg2+. The merged data sets for each condition extend over the q range 0.004–0.24 Å−1. Guinier regions for each data set are shown in Fig. 2 B. Each shows evidence for two linear regions, the larger slope associated with the R gvalue for the overall shape and the lesser slope associated with the head group region. The rollover of the data at the lowest qvalues is expected for asymmetric, rod-like particles of finite length. Fig. 2 C shows the pair-vector distribution functions,P(r) versus r, obtained via Fourier transform of the data using the GNOM software package. TheP(r) profile for each data set exhibited two prominent maxima, one at r = ∼37 Å and one atr = ∼110 Å. The peak at r = 37 Å is a consistent feature of P(r) profiles derived from solution scattering measurements of myosin S1 subfragments (29Wakabayashi K. Tokunaga M. Kohno I. Sugimoto Y. Hamanaka T. Takezawa Y. Wakabayashi T. Amemiya Y. Science. 1992; 258: 443-447Google Scholar,30Garrigos M. Mallam S. Vachette P. Bordas J. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1462-1470Google Scholar) and, therefore, is likely to reflect interatomic vector lengths within the S1 head. The longer vector lengths most likely reflect contributions from both head-head and head-rod scattering vectors (see below). The P(r) functions were similar for all buffers, suggesting that the overall conformation of HMM was not measurably different in buffers with or without added divalent cations. The length at which the P(r) function goes to zero gives the maximum chord length of the molecule,d max. All three data sets were fit well at ad max of 390–400 Å and radius of gyration (R g) values of 110–112 Å using neutron scattering data with a q min of 0.004 Å−1. Ad max value of ∼400 Å is consistent with electron microscope observations that indicate a sharp bend in the myosin rod 43 nm from the head-tail junction (11Elliott A. Offer G. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 123: 505-519Google Scholar). Flexibility of the rod at this position and limitations from q mincould contribute to an apparent foreshortening from the longest estimated lengths of the S2 rod (72 nm) (31Lu R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2010-2013Google Scholar). X-ray scattering measurements were used to obtain plots ofR g versus concentration, c, to extrapolate values of R g at infinite dilution (Fig.2 D). For these data scattering was corrected for effects of slit smearing (see “Materials and Methods”), andR g values were again determined fromP(r) analysis. As expected for monodisperse particles, the R g versus crelations showed either no concentration dependence or showed thatR g decreased with increasing c, which is characteristic of interparticle interference. The difference between the R g of HMM in solutions containing EDTA and in solutions containing free added Mg2+ or Ca2+ is not statistically significant, consistent with our conclusion from the neutron scattering data that the addition of divalent cations does not cause a large scale redistribution of molecular mass, i.e.the disposition of the head groups with respect to each other and to the rod are similar for each form. I 0 values obtained fromP(r) analysis of the x-ray scattering data were used to calculate molecular weight values by comparison with lysozyme as a standard (20Krigbaum W.R. Kugler F.R. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 1216-1223Google Scholar). Molecular weight values calculated from the x-ray scattering data underestimated published values for chymotryptic HMM by as much as 25%. The underestimate was likely due to the large dimensions of HMM combined with our limited ability to collect x-ray scattering data below 0.01 Å−1, which are required to adequately sample the long vector lengths within the particle. Indeed the P(r) profiles calculated from the x-ray scattering data go to zero at shorter vector lengths (∼270 Å), effectively truncating the vector lengths associated with the long tail of the HMM molecule. To determine whether the existing model of the head-tail junction of myosin (13Offer G. Knight P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 407-416Google Scholar) could adequately account for experimental scattering by HMM, neutron scattering profiles were compared with simulated spectra from a similar model. The original model was constructed by aligning the crystal coordinates of two scallop regulatory domains with model coordinates for a scallop α-helical coiled-coil rod. The remainder of the catalytic domain was generated by the addition of chicken S1 coordinates (1Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.H. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Google Scholar). According to the resulting structure, the two S1 heads are predicted to lie in a plane nearly anti-parallel to one another, with heads overlapping at the distal ends of the light chain binding domains. The structure has 2-fold rotational symmetry about the axis of the coiled-coil tail. Scattering intensity profiles were generated from the model using an algorithm previously described (27Gallagher S.C. Callaghan A.J. Zhao J. Dalton H. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6752-6760Google Scholar). Intensity profiles were also generated from models with coiled-coil tails of varying lengths (see “Materials and Methods”). Fig.3 A shows one such model (tail length = 380 Å) and a comparison of P(r) functions (Fig. 3 B) derived from the model to that obtained from experimental scattering data (neutron scattering data from HMM in solutions containing EDTA). Although the maxima at r = ∼37 and 110 Å in the experimental P(r) were reproduced reasonably well by the simulated data, the relative intensities of the two peaks differed between the experimental and model P(r) functions. The functions also differed at a third maximum (r = ∼200 Å), with the modelP(r) function giving a much more pronounced peak compared with the experimental data function. The comparisons indicate that significant differences exist between the published HMM model (13Offer G. Knight P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 407-416Google Scholar) and HMM conformation in solution. Three independent best-fit models produced by allowing the two S1 heads to freely rotate relative to the S2 tail are shown in Fig.4. As can be seen from the wire frame models, all three of the structures obtained using this approach exhibited similar features, although two of the models differed from the third with respect to chirality (handedness) of the heads. Because small-angle scattering cannot distinguish between equivalent conformations of different handedness, neither conformation can be excluded. Compared with the starting model (Fig. 3 A), the S1 heads in the optimized models are less planar and show marked asymmetry with respect to the rod. Fig. 5 shows theP(r) functions of the models compared with that derived from experimental neutron scattering data. All three models reproduce the initial peak at r = ∼37 Å and approximate the relative intensity of a second maximum. However, the position of the second maximum shifts to shorter vector lengths (r = ∼87 versus 110 Å). A third peak atr = ∼176 Å is also more prominent in the modelP(r) functions.Figure 5Comparison of theoreticalP(r) functions calculated from best-fit HMM structural models using PR_PDB. Neutron scattering data is shown in black, model 1011 is shown inred, model 1508 is shown in green, and model 1608 is shown in blue. P(r) functions were generated from the scattering data using GNOM software, and the area under each curve was normalized to 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) P(r) functions derived from the breakdown of one of the models produced by XTAL_STR into its component parts are shown in Fig. 6. According to this analysis, the three broad maxima in the P(r) profile of the complete model can be deconstructed into four peaks arising from model subcomponents. The first and second of these, occurring atr = 37 and 85 Å, are due primarily to scattering lengths within the individual heads and between the individual heads and the rod, respectively. The third and fourth, at r = 115 and 176 Å, are due to vectors corresponding to distances between the two S1 heads. Potentially, the ratio of the first and second peak intensities could be affected by segmental flexibility of the rod and account for divergence of vector lengths among model and experimental data in this region. Similarly, flexion of the individual heads at the junction between the catalytic and light chain binding domains (29Wakabayashi K. Tokunaga M. Kohno I. Sugimoto Y. Hamanaka T. Takezawa Y. Wakabayashi T. Amemiya Y. Science. 1992; 258: 443-447Google Scholar) could modulate peak intensity at r = 176 Å. However, these additional points of flexibility were not incorporated into the current modeling because they would have introduced an unacceptable number of degrees of freedom into the modeling. The results presented here are the first to use small-angle x-ray and neutron scattering measurements to produce a model of the three-dimensional structure of a double-headed myosin fragment in solution. In contrast to previous studies of HMM by small-angle x-ray scattering (32Mendelson R.A. Wagner P.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 153-171Google Scholar, 33Faruqi A.R. Cross R.A. Kendrick-Jones J. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1991; 14: 23-26Google Scholar), we utilized available S1 crystal structures to construct HMM models that satisfy experimental scattering profiles of HMM in solution. Although equivalent small-angle scattering intensity profiles do not necessarily imply a unique structural solution, the ability to obtain reproducible fits using constraints of known crystal structures suggests that the models described here are reasonable representations of the three-dimensional shape of two-headed myosin in solution. The major new finding of this work is that the head-tail junction of HMM is not symmetric. Although it has been appreciated that the two heads of myosin may adopt defined conformations with re"
