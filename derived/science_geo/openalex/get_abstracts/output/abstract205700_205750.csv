https://openalex.org/W2049836560,"A procedure involving music and noise has been effective in suppressing pain in 5000 dental operations. The music promotes relaxation, and the noise (the main agent) directly suppresses pain. The dental procedure and results are described, and an explanatory hypothesis is suggested."

https://openalex.org/W2056363307,A pedigree of hairy ear rims published in Italy in 1907 indicated holandric inheritance. The recent collection of over 20 pedigrees in India appears to show conclusively that the gene for hairy ear rims is in the Y chromosome. This is further evidence of relationship between the Mediterranean race in Europe and the population of India.

https://openalex.org/W2047022356,A transactional position suggests the hypothesis that there should be changes in the fine eye movements of a fixating subject if the fixated visual display is altered. It is shown that the mean saccadic eye movements are unequivocally different with different positions of the stimulus within the visual field.

The method is attractive since no sample preparation is involved, and the activities are measured directly on the filter paper wetted with the scintillator solution. A linear dependence of counting rate on total activity was found for iodine-131, phosphorus-32, sodium-22, and carbon-14, and counting efficiencies were determined."

https://openalex.org/W1998286999,"Land has recently studied the perception of colors resulting from appropriate mixtures of two colors or of one color and light from an incandescent lamp. In an ""image situation,"" colors of all hues may result from such mixtures. The findings presented demonstrate that the mixing which Land accomplished by superimposing two projected images on a screen can be achieved when the two color separation images are presented simultaneously but separately to the two eyes."

https://openalex.org/W2078808931,"Hungry rats were trained to time precisely by rewarding with food those lever responses spaced 20 to 22 seconds apart. Injections of nicotine disrupted the timing behavior slightly, but pronounced delayed effects occurred 3 and 4 days after the drug injection and following a temporary return to base-line performance."

https://openalex.org/W2023023830,"X-rays and ultraviolet radiations delay regeneration and division of Blepharisma undulans. Irradiated blepharisma which have not been cut divide once or twice fairly soon after the controls, then they cease dividing for a period of time (stasis) which may last for many hours or even days. Once they recover from stasis they divide at a rate comparable to controls. Cut, irradiated blepharisma, on the other hand, having to replace lost parts, start to divide later than the uncut irradiated individuals, but little if any stasis occurs. As a consequence, although irradiated with the same dosage, cut individuals recover a normal rate of division sooner than uncut ones."

https://openalex.org/W2172278022,"(Received for publication, March 16, 1960) The “citric acid cycle” is now regarded as the final common pathway of metabolism serving as the primary route for the oxi- dation of metabolites. Likewise, the thyroid hormone is con- sidered a major regulatory substance for biological oxidations. It, therefore, seemed logical to study possible quantitative altera- tions in the cycle acids in experimental hypo- and hyperthyroid states. The concentrations of the cycle acids in metabolically active tissues, liver and muscle, were determined in experimental hypo- and hyperthyroid and control rats."
