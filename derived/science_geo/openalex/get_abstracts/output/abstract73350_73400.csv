Long-term survivors of this reaction developed lymphoid neoplasms which resembled Hodgkin's disease and lymphosarcoma. Mice with these tumors were chimeras, but the parental cells present within their spleens had specific immunological tolerance toward host antigens. This, together with the finding that the tumors were transplantable only to isogenic recipients, indicates that the tumors were of host rather than donor origin."

https://openalex.org/W2064997484,"BIOCHANIN A (I), genistein (II) and formononetin (III) have been shown to act as oestrogens in mice, rats and guinea-pigs, and are considered to be responsible for the depression of fertility noted in sheep grazing subterranean clover1. An examination has now been made of the urinary metabolites produced when these isoflavones are administered to sheep. Nilsson2 reported that biochanin A, injected intraperitoneally into rats, was largely excreted in the faeces as biochanin A and genistein or their conjugates. In our experiments with sheep, only trace amounts of free or conjugated isoflavones were found in the faeces."

An examination of a given class of phospholipids reveals that these melting points are, to a large extent, independent of the fatty acid residues present. Thus, 2-oleoyl-3-stearoyl-L-1-phosphatidylcholine and 2,3-distearoyl-L-1-phosphatidylcholine both have recorded melting points3 of 230°–231° C. The thermal transitions of phospholipids are difficult to observe with normal melting equipment, even when using a microscope. Occasionally some workers have observed ‘sintering points’, corresponding to thermal transitions, which occur below the normal melting point. However, the relevance of these points has never been demonstrated."

https://openalex.org/W2059467231,Starch-gel electrophoresis of plasina reveals two mnutually exclusive forms of alkaline phosphatase. Analysis of the plasma of 931 birds from 96 sib families of two inbred lines through two generations shows that the faster-moving isozymne is determined by an autosomal gene Ap(2) which is completely dominant to its allele Ap(4) determining the slower form.

Statistical fluctuations are minimized in that 100,000 animals are used to determine a single median anesthetic dose value. The technique was developed to study molecular mechanisms of general anesthesia."

These findings were unexpected, at least with respect to the blue-green organisms, for two groups of authors5,6 found that the distribution of 14C in the products formed during photosynthesis was similar to that obtained with Chlorella, an alga which contains aldolase. This manuscript is concerned with the partial characterization of aldolase in Anacystis nidulans and R. spheroides. A similar enzyme was also detected in extracts of Tolypothrix tenuis and Anabaenopsis sp."
https://openalex.org/W2063602314,"IN this communication we report the presence of glycolyl-neuraminic acid in sialic acids from ox brain gangliosides. Our method of analysis consisted of the following six steps: (i) gangliosides were extracted from ox brain grey matter and purified according to a method which we have previously described1; (ii) gangliosides so obtained were hydrolysed in 0.1 N sulphuric acid at 80° C for 2 h, to split off sialic acid; (iii) sialic acid was purified on ‘Dowex’ 2 × 8 column as acetate according to Svennerholm2, and desalted on ‘Amberlite IR–120’; (iv) the solution was dried in vacuum and the residue was hydrolysed in 1 N sulphuric acid for 5 h at 100° C to obtain glycolic acid3; (v) glycolic acid was purified on ‘Dowex’ 2 × 8 column as acetate and eluted with NaCl 2 M; (vi) the glycolic acid was identified by the Eegriwe reaction4 and by gas-chromatography."

https://openalex.org/W2000743240,"THE median eminence and the true portal system of the higher vertebrates have not been observed in the teleost pituitary, although the blood vascular supply of the teleost pituitary has been described by Bretschneider and de Wit1, Green2 and Barrington3 in some detail. It is often reported that the pituitary gland in teleosts receives a direct blood supply from the internal carotid arteries and that the neurohypophysis and the adenohypophysis share a common vascularization. On this basis Green2 homologizes the neurohypophysis of the fish pituitary with the median eminence of the higher vertebrates. Barrington3 has attempted to show some degree of resemblance between the richly vascularized portion of the infundibulum of the minnow and the median eminence of Rana. However, he denies the existence of a true portal system in the minnow as most of the blood enters the gland directly through a ‘ring vessel’."

Consistently present in the triploid cells were two marker chromosomes, a small centric fragment, and an apparently telocentric D. At various times triploid cells constituted 40 to 80 percent of the cell population. The possible origin of the triploid cell is a diploid/ triploid mosaic amnion."

https://openalex.org/W2079793000,"DURING hypothermia the arterial blood pressure of the chicken has been reported to decrease pari passu with the diminution in body-temperature1. However, it is not known whether the decrease in blood pressure is the result of a diminution of the cardiac output or of the total peripheral vascular resistance. The purpose of the experiments reported here was therefore to obtain data on the cardiac outputs and blood pressures of chickens during hypothermia. From such data the total peripheral resistances could be calculated."

Radioactivity of the kidney and liver increased after the first measurement; that of the ganglia declined during the first day but later remained constant."
