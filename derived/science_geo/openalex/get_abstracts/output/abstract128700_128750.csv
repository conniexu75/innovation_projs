https://openalex.org/W2171258458,"CRM1 is distantly related to receptors that mediate nuclear protein import and was previously shown to interact with the nuclear pore complex. Overexpression of CRM1 in Xenopus oocytes stimulates Rev and U snRNA export from the nucleus. Conversely, leptomycin B, a cytotoxin that is shown to bind to CRM1 protein, specifically inhibits the nuclear export of Rev and U snRNAs. In vitro, CRM1 forms a leptomycin B-sensitive complex involving cooperative binding of both RanGTP and the nuclear export signal (NES) from either the Rev or PKI proteins. We conclude that CRM1 is an export receptor for leucine-rich nuclear export signals and discuss a model for the role of RanGTP in CRM1 function and in nuclear export in general."
https://openalex.org/W2165721689,"The caspase-3 (CPP32, apopain, YAMA) family of cysteinyl proteases has been implicated as key mediators of apoptosis in mammalian cells. Gelsolin was identified as a substrate for caspase-3 by screening the translation products of small complementary DNA pools for sensitivity to cleavage by caspase-3. Gelsolin was cleaved in vivo in a caspase-dependent manner in cells stimulated by Fas. Caspase-cleaved gelsolin severed actin filaments in vitro in a Ca 2+ -independent manner. Expression of the gelsolin cleavage product in multiple cell types caused the cells to round up, detach from the plate, and undergo nuclear fragmentation. Neutrophils isolated from mice lacking gelsolin had delayed onset of both blebbing and DNA fragmentation, following apoptosis induction, compared with wild-type neutrophils. Thus, cleaved gelsolin may be one physiological effector of morphologic change during apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2155085170,"Nuclear protein export is mediated by nuclear export signals (NESs), but the mechanisms governing this transport process are not well understood. Using a novel protein export assay in S. cerevisiae, we identify CRM1 as an essential mediator of nuclear protein export in yeast. Crm1p shows homology to importin beta-like transport factors and is able to specifically interact with both the NES motif and the Ran GTPase. A mutation in the shuttling protein Crm1p affects not only protein export, but also mRNA export, indicating that these pathways are tightly coupled in S. cerevisiae. The presented data are consistent with the conclusion that Crm1p is a carrier for the NES-mediated protein export pathway. We propose CRM1 be renamed exportin 1 (XPO1)."
https://openalex.org/W2056807976,"Gene targeting experiments have demonstrated that the expression of immunoglobulin heavy chain in the pre-B cell receptor (pBCR) and of heavy and light chains in the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) marks checkpoints in early B cell development that the cells have to pass to survive. To investigate whether the persistence of mature B cells in the peripheral immune system also depends on BCR expression, we have generated a transgenic mouse in which the BCR can be inducibly ablated through V region gene deletion. Ablation leads to rapid death of mature B lymphocytes, which is preceded by down-regulation of MHC antigens and up-regulation of CD95 (Fas) and can be delayed by constitutive bcl-2 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2081294646,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) communicates with the nucleus through the unfolded protein response (UPR), which senses accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen and leads to increased transcription of genes encoding ER-resident chaperones. As a key regulatory step in this signaling pathway, the mRNA encoding the UPR-specific transcription factor Hac1p becomes spliced by a unique mechanism that requires tRNA ligase but not the spliceosome. Splicing is initiated upon activation of Ire1p, a transmembrane kinase that lies in the ER and/or inner nuclear membrane. We show that Ire1p is a bifunctional enzyme: in addition to being a kinase, it is a site-specific endoribonuclease that cleaves HAC1 mRNA specifically at both splice junctions. The addition of purified tRNA ligase completes splicing; we therefore have reconstituted HAC1 mRNA splicing in vitro from purified components."
https://openalex.org/W2031811175,"In normal animals, peripheral nerve injury produces a persistent, neuropathic pain state in which pain is exaggerated and can be produced by nonpainful stimuli. Here, mice that lack protein kinase C gamma (PKCgamma) displayed normal responses to acute pain stimuli, but they almost completely failed to develop a neuropathic pain syndrome after partial sciatic nerve section, and the neurochemical changes that occurred in the spinal cord after nerve injury were blunted. Also, PKCgamma was shown to be restricted to a small subset of dorsal horn neurons, thus identifying a potential biochemical target for the prevention and therapy of persistent pain."
https://openalex.org/W2045647450,"The molecular components of mammalian circadian clocks are elusive. We have isolated a human gene termed RIGUI that encodes a bHLH/PAS protein 44% homologous to Drosophila period. The highly conserved mouse homolog (m-rigui) is expressed in a circadian pattern in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the master regulator of circadian clocks in mammals. Circadian expression in the SCN continues in constant darkness, and a shift in the light/dark cycle evokes a proportional shift of m-rigui expression in the SCN. m-rigui transcripts also appear in a periodic pattern in Purkinje neurons, pars tuberalis, and retina, but with a timing of oscillation different from that seen in the SCN. Sequence homology and circadian patterns of expression suggest that RIGUI is a mammalian ortholog of the Drosophila period gene, raising the possibility that a regulator of circadian clocks is conserved."
https://openalex.org/W2074697255,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an often fatal neuromuscular disease that has been directly linked to the protein product of the Survival of Motor Neurons (SMN) gene. The SMN protein is tightly associated with a novel protein, SIP1, and together they form a complex with several spliceosomal snRNP proteins. Here we show that the SMN-SIP1 complex is associated with spliceosomal snRNAs U1 and U5 in the cytoplasm of Xenopus oocytes. Antibodies directed against the SMN-SIP1 complex strongly interfere with the cytoplasmic assembly of the common (Sm) snRNP proteins with spliceosomal snRNAs and with the import of the snRNP complex into the nucleus. Thus, the SMN-SIP1 complex is directly involved in the biogenesis of spliceosomal snRNPs. Defects in spliceosomal snRNP biogenesis may, therefore, be the cause of SMA."
https://openalex.org/W2096650232,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), one of the most common fatal autosomal recessive diseases, is characterized by degeneration of motor neurons and muscular atrophy. The SMA disease gene, termed Survival of Motor Neurons (SMN), is deleted or mutated in over 98% of SMA patients. The function of the SMN protein is unknown. We found that SMN is tightly associated with a novel protein, SIP1, and together they form a specific complex with several spliceosomal snRNP proteins. SMN interacts directly with several of the snRNP Sm core proteins, including B, D1-3, and E. Interestingly, SIP1 has significant sequence similarity with Brr1, a yeast protein critical for snRNP biogenesis. These findings suggest a role for SMN and SIP1 in spliceosomal snRNP biogenesis and function and provide a likely molecular mechanism for the cause of SMA."
https://openalex.org/W2019416837,"Substance P is released in the spinal cord in response to painful stimuli, but its role in nociceptive signaling remains unclear. When a conjugate of substance P and the ribosome-inactivating protein saporin was infused into the spinal cord, it was internalized and cytotoxic to lamina I spinal cord neurons that express the substance P receptor. This treatment left responses to mild noxious stimuli unchanged, but markedly attenuated responses to highly noxious stimuli and mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia. Thus, lamina I spinal cord neurons that express the substance P receptor play a pivotal role in the transmission of highly noxious stimuli and the maintenance of hyperalgesia."
https://openalex.org/W1991018390,"NLS proteins are transported into the nucleus by the importin α/β heterodimer. Importin α binds the NLS, while importin β mediates translocation through the nuclear pore complex. After translocation, RanGTP, whose predicted concentration is high in the nucleus and low in the cytoplasm, binds importin β and displaces importin α. Importin α must then be returned to the cytoplasm, leaving the NLS protein behind. Here, we report that the previously identified CAS protein mediates importin α re-export. CAS binds strongly to importin α only in the presence of RanGTP, forming an importin α/CAS/RanGTP complex. Importin α is released from this complex in the cytoplasm by the combined action of RanBP1 and RanGAP1. CAS binds preferentially to NLS-free importin α, explaining why import substrates stay in the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2074851426,"The small GTPase Rab5 plays an essential role in endocytic traffic. Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor delivers Rab5 to the membrane, where a nucleotide exchange activity allows recruitment of an effector protein, Rabaptin-5. Here we uncovered a novel 60 kDa Rab5-binding protein, Rabex-5. Rabex-5 forms a tight physical complex with Rabaptin-5, and this complex is essential for endocytic membrane fusion. Sequencing of mammalian Rabex-5 by nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry and cloning revealed striking homology to Vps9p, a yeast protein implicated in endocytic traffic. Rabex-5 displays GDP/GTP exchange activity on Rab5 upon delivery of the GTPase to the membrane. This demonstrates that a soluble exchange factor coupled to a Rab effector translocates from cytosol to the membrane, where the complex stabilizes the GTPase in the active state."
https://openalex.org/W2046764234,"The coactivator CBP has been proposed to stimulate the expression of certain signal-dependent genes via its association with RNA polymerase II complexes. Here we show that complex formation between CBP and RNA polymerase II requires RNA helicase A (RHA), a nuclear DNA/RNA helicase that is related to the Drosophila male dosage compensation factor mle. In transient transfection assays, RHA was found to cooperate with CBP in mediating target gene activation via the CAMP responsive factor CREB. As a mutation in RHA that compromised its helicase activity correspondingly reduced CREB-dependent transcription, we propose that RHA may induce local changes in chromatin structure that promote engagement of the transcriptional apparatus on signal responsive promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2002426370,"Exocytic transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi complex has been visualized in living cells using a chimera of the temperature-sensitive glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus and green fluorescent protein (ts-G-GFPct). Upon shifting to permissive temperature, ts-G-GFPct concentrates into COPII-positive structures close to the ER, which then build up to form an intermediate compartment or transport complex, containing ERGIC-53 and the KDEL receptor, where COPII is replaced by COPI. These structures appear heterogenous and move in a microtubule-dependent manner toward the Golgi complex. Our results suggest a sequential mode of COPII and COPI action and indicate that the transport complexes are ER-to-Golgi transport intermediates from which COPI may be involved in recycling material to the ER."
https://openalex.org/W2145561586,"Unique among known human herpesviruses, Kaposi's sarcoma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV or HHV-8) encodes chemokine-like proteins (vMIP-I and vMIP-II). vMIP-II was shown to block infection of human immunodeficiency virus–type 1 (HIV-1) on a CD4-positive cell line expressing CCR3 and to a lesser extent on one expressing CCR5, whereas both vMIP-I and vMIP-II partially inhibited HIV infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Like eotaxin, vMIP-II activated and chemoattracted human eosinophils by way of CCR3. vMIP-I and vMIP-II, but not cellular MIP-1α or RANTES, were highly angiogenic in the chorioallantoic assay, suggesting a possible pathogenic role in Kaposi's sarcoma."
https://openalex.org/W1975977959,"The human dopamine D4 receptor (D4R) has received considerable attention because of its high affinity for the atypical antipsychotic clozapine and the unusually polymorphic nature of its gene. To clarify the in vivo role of the D4R, we produced and analyzed mutant mice (D4R−/−) lacking this protein. Although less active in open field tests, D4R−/− mice outperformed wild-type mice on the rotarod and displayed locomotor supersensitivity to ethanol, cocaine, and methamphetamine. Biochemical analyses revealed that dopamine synthesis and its conversion to DOPAC were elevated in the dorsal striatum from D4R−/− mice. Based on these findings, we propose that the D4R modulates normal, coordinated and drug-stimulated motor behaviors as well as the activity of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2114531852,"Meiotic recombination occurs preferentially between homologous nonsister chromatids rather than between sisters, opposite to the bias of mitotic recombinational repair. We have examined formation of joint molecule recombination intermediates (JMs) between homologs and between sisters in yeast strains lacking the meiotic chromosomal protein Red1, the meiotic recA homolog Dmc1, and/or mitotic recA homolog(s), Rad51, Rad55, and Rad57. Mutant phenotypes imply that most meiotic recombination occurs via an interhomolog-only pathway along which interhomolog bias is established early, prior to or during double strand break (DSB) formation, and then enforced, just at the time when DSBs initiate JM formation. A parallel, less differentiated pathway yields intersister and, probably, a few interhomolog events. Coordinate action of mitotic recA homologs as one functional unit, two functions of RED1, and an interhomolog interaction function of DMC1 are also revealed."
https://openalex.org/W2121968955,"The human CD1b protein presents lipid antigens to T cells, but the molecular mechanism is unknown. Identification of mycobacterial glucose monomycolate (GMM) as a CD1b-presented glycolipid allowed determination of the structural requirements for its recognition by T cells. Presentation of GMM to CD1b-restricted T cells was not affected by substantial variations in its lipid tails, but was extremely sensitive to chemical alterations in its carbohydrate or other polar substituents. These findings support the view that the recently demonstrated hydrophobic CD1 groove binds the acyl chains of lipid antigens relatively nonspecifically, thereby positioning the hydrophilic components for highly specific interactions with T cell antigen receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2048729396,"A single double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) break will cause yeast cells to arrest in G2/M at the DNA damage checkpoint. If the dsDNA break cannot be repaired, cells will eventually override (that is, adapt to) this checkpoint, even though the damage that elicited the arrest is still present. Here, we report the identification of two adaptation-defective mutants that remain permanently arrested as large-budded cells when faced with an irreparable dsDNA break in a nonessential chromosome. This adaptation-defective phenotype was entirely relieved by deletion of RAD9, a gene required for the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint arrest. We show that one mutation resides in CDC5, which encodes a polo-like kinase, whereas a second, less penetrant, adaptation-defective mutant is affected at the CKB2 locus, which encodes a nonessential specificity subunit of casein kinase II."
https://openalex.org/W2033766178,"We have investigated DNA segregation in E. coli by inserting multiple lac operator sequences into the chromosome near the origin of replication (oriC), in the hisC gene, a terminus marker, and into plasmids P1 and F. Expression of a GFP–LacI fusion protein allowed visualization of lac operator localization. oriC was shown to be specifically localized at or near the cell poles, and when duplicated, one copy moved to the site of new pole formation near the site of cell division. In contrast, P1 and F localized to the cell center and on duplication appeared to move rapidly to the quarter positions in the cell. Our analysis suggests that different active processes are involved in movement and localization of the chromosome and of the two plasmids during segregation."
https://openalex.org/W2035750944,"A high frequency (about 60%) of ret rearrangements in papillary thyroid carcinomas of children exposed to radioactive fallout in Belarus after the Chernobyl accident, has been reported by three recent studies (Fugazzola et al., 1995; Ito et al., 1994; Klugbauer et al., 1995). These studies suggested that the radiation exposure may be a direct inducer of activating rearrangements in the ret gene. In order to confirm the postulated link between irradiation and the role of the ret proto-oncogene in thyroid tumorigenesis, we analysed for the presence of ret activating rearrangements using RT-PCR, XL-PCR, Southern blot and direct sequencing techniques, 39 human thyroid tumors (19 papillary carcinomas and 20 follicular adenomas), from patients who had received external radiation for benign or malignant conditions. As controls, we studied 39 'spontaneous' tumors (20 papillary carcinomas and 19 follicular adenomas). Our data concerning the radiation-associated tumors, showed that: (1) the overall frequency of ret rearrangements was 84% in papillary carcinomas (16/19) and 45% (9/20) in follicular adenomas; (2) in contrast with the results obtained in the Chernobyl tumors, the most frequently observed chimeric gene was RET/PTC1 instead of the RET/PTC3 and (3) all the tumors were negative for RET/PTC2. In the 'spontaneous' tumors, only the papillary carcinomas presented a ret rearrangement (15%:3/20): 1 RET/PTC1, 1 RET/ PTC3 and 1 uncharacterized. In conclusion, our results confirm the crucial role played by the ret proto-oncogene activating rearrangements in the development of radiation-associated thyroid tumors appearing after therapeutic or accidental ionizing irradiation, and show, for the first time, the presence of RET/PTC genes in follicular adenomas appeared after external irradiation."
https://openalex.org/W2049570304,"Reexpression of the V(D)J recombinase-activating genes RAG1 and RAG2 in germinal center B cells creates the potential for immunoglobulin gene rearrangement and the generation of new antigen receptor specificities. Intermediate products of V(D)J recombination are abundant in a subset of germinal center B cells, demonstrating that the κ immunoglobulin light-chain locus becomes a substrate for renewed V(D)J recombinase activity. This recombinationally active cell compartment contains many heavy-chain VDJ rearrangements that encode low-affinity or nonfunctional antibody. In germinal centers, secondary V(D)J recombination may be induced by diminished binding to antigen ligands, thereby limiting abrupt changes in receptor specificity to B cells that are usually eliminated from the germinal center reaction. This restriction preserves efficient antigen-driven selection in germinal centers while allowing for saltations in the somatic evolution of B cells."
https://openalex.org/W2050892074,"Ceramide (N-acylsphingosine) biosynthesis has been proposed to involve introduction of the 4,5-trans-double bond of sphingosine after synthesis of dihydroceramide (i.e. N-acylsphinganine). For the first time, the in vitro conversion of dihydroceramide to ceramide has been demonstrated using rat liver microsomes andN-[1-14C]octanoyl-d-erythro-sphinganine (st-H2Cer) and either NADH or NADPH as co-substrate; the apparent K m values for st-H2Cer and NADH were 340 and 120 μm, respectively. Molecular oxygen is required for enzymatic activity, and cyanide, divalent copper, as well as antibodies raised against cytochrome b 5are inhibitory, which suggests that this enzyme should be named dihydroceramide desaturase based on these similarities with the mechanism of Δ9-desaturase (stearoyl-CoA desaturase). Factors that influenced the activity of dihydroceramide desaturase include the alkyl chain length of the sphingoid base (in the order C18 > C12 > C8) and fatty acid (C8 > C18); the stereochemistry of the sphingoid base (d-erythro- >l-threo-dihydroceramides); the nature of the headgroup, with the highest activity with dihydroceramide, but some (∼20%) activity with dihydrosphingomyelin (activity was not detected with dihydroglucosylceramide, however); and the ability to utilize alternative reductants (ascorbic acid could substitute for a reduced pyridine nucleotide, but was inhibitory at higher concentrations). Dihydroceramide desaturase was inhibited by dithiothreitol, which suggests that it might be possible to alter ceramide synthesis by varying the thiol status of hepatocytes. Consistent with this hypothesis, when rat hepatocytes were cultured in varying concentrations of N-acetylcysteine (5 and 10 mm), there was a decrease in the relative incorporation of [14C]serine into [14C]ceramide. These studies have conclusively established the pathway of ceramide synthesis via desaturation of dihydroceramide and have uncovered several properties of this reaction that warrant further consideration for their relevance to both sphingolipid metabolism and signaling.

These studies have conclusively established the pathway of ceramide synthesis via desaturation of dihydroceramide and have uncovered several properties of this reaction that warrant further consideration for their relevance to both sphingolipid metabolism and signaling. Over the last few years, it has become clear that ceramide plays important roles in the metabolism of cells. It is involved as a second messenger in what has become known as the sphingomyelin cycle (reviewed in Ref. 1Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and, to name but a few, serves as a mediator of cellular senescence (2Venable M.E. Lee J.Y. Smyth M.J. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30701-30708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), apoptosis, and differentiation in many cell types (3Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). It was also observed that not only ceramide derived from the sphingomyelin pool found in the plasma membrane but also that fromde novo synthesis is involved in the cellular responses to inducers of apoptosis (4Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar) and differentiation (5Yokoyama K. Nojiri H. Suzuki M. Setaka M. Suzuki A. Nojima S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These results suggest an important role of the anabolic pathway of ceramides in signal transduction. It is therefore very likely that sphingolipid biosynthesis is tightly regulated. Taking into consideration that dihydroceramide does not mimic the effects of ceramide (6Bielawska A. Crane H.M. Liotta D. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26226-26232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wiesner D.A. Dawson G. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1418-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), one possible site of regulation might be dihydroceramide desaturase. In addition, ceramide is also involved in the transport of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins, for example in yeast (8Horvath A. Sutterlin C. Manningkrieg U. Movva N.R. Riezman H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3687-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of the lipid anchor of all glycosphingolipids and sphingomyelin starts with the condensation of l-serine and palmitoyl-CoA catalyzed by the pyridoxal phosphate-dependent serine palmitoyltransferase (EC2.3.1.50). Its product, 3-dehydrosphinganine, is immediately reduced by the NADPH-dependent 3-dehydrosphinganine reductase yieldingd-erythro-sphinganine (see Ref. 9Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3764-3769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, and references therein). Whether this sphingoid base is first desaturated to form sphingosine and then acylated to yield ceramide (reviewed in Ref. 9Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3764-3769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or first acylated and then desaturated as proposed by several authors (9Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 14486-14490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) remained unclear for some time, although experimental results strongly favored the latter pathway. The discovery of fumonisin B1 as a potent inhibitor of the N-acylation of sphingoid bases (12Wang E. Norred W.P. Bacon C.W. Riley R.T. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14486-14490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Merrill Jr., A.H. van Echten G. Wang E. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27299-27306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), helped us and others to demonstrate that, indeed, dihydroceramide is an intermediate in sphingolipid biosynthesis in many cell types (14Rother J. van Echten G. Schwarzmann G. Sandhoff K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 15Chigorno V. Valsecchi M. Sonnino S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 1095-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), whereas sphingosine is not. Thus,d-erythro-sphinganine is first acylated and subsequent introduction of the 4,5-double bond by the dihydroceramide desaturase leads to the formation of ceramide. The first three enzymes involved in sphingolipid biosynthesis are well characterized, and their subcellular localization and topology were found to be the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum (16Mandon E.C.

Chicken anti-rat cytochrome b 5 antibodies and chicken control IgG were kindly provided by Dr. John B. Schenkman (Department of Pharmacology, University of Connecticut, Farmington, CT). The activity and specificity against rat liver microsomes were shown by Western blot analysis using horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-chicken IgG as secondary antibody. The anti-cytochromeb 5 antibodies bound exclusively to cytochromeb 5, while treating the blot with the chicken control IgG showed no detectable staining. All solutions were prepared a day before use and stored at 0–4 °C. Male Wistar rats (50–55 days old, 200–250 g) were starved for 12 h and killed by decapitation. The livers were excised and washed twice in ice-cold sucrose/phosphate buffer (0.25 msucrose, 100 mmNaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 7.4). All subsequent procedures were carried out at 0–4 °C. Individual livers were weighed, minced with a scalpel, added to the same sucrose/phosphate buffer (0.5 g of liver/ml) and homogenized with 5 up-and-down strokes at 600 rpm in a Braun glass homogenizer with a loose-fitting Teflon pestle. The homogenate was centrifuged at 680 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was saved, and the pellet was resuspended and centrifuged the same way as described above. The combined supernatants were centrifuged at 10,000 × gfor 10 min and the resulting supernatant at 105,000 ×g for 1 h. The pellet was resuspended in alkaline phosphate buffer (100 mmNaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 8.0) (1 g of liver/ml). After centrifugation at 105,000 ×g for 1 h, the pellet finally was resuspended in phosphate buffer (100 mmNaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) (2.5 g of liver/ml), frozen in aliquots in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Defatted glass plates were each coated with a mixture of 30 ml of double-distilled water, 0.8 g of Na2B4O7·10H2O, and 14 g of Silica gel G 60 and were allowed to dry for 2 days at room temperature (18Braun P.E. Morell P. Radin N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 335-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The labeled substrates were synthesized by activation of 1-[14C]fatty acid with N-hydroxysuccinimide and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide for subsequent acylation of the respective sphingoid base as described previously (19Schwarzmann G. Sandhoff K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 319-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The crude product mixtures were evaporated under a stream of nitrogen. Purification first involved separation by TLC with CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (80:10:1, v/v) for Cer and H2Cer, CHCl3/CH3OH/2n ammonia (65:25:4, v/v) for st-GlcCer and CHCl3/CH3OH/2 n ammonia (60:35:8, v/v) for st-SM as the developing systems. After detection by radioactive scanning, the spots were scraped from the TLC plate and re-extracted with CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1, v/v). Separation from free fatty acid was achieved by TLC with diethyl ether/CH3OH (99:2, v/v) as the developing system, scraping, and re-extraction with CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1, v/v). To obtain the saturated compounds, st-SM, st-GlcCer, andN-[6-3H]octanoyl-C8-sphingosine were reduced with H2/Pd(OAc)2 (1.5 torr, 1 h) in methanol. Purification was achieved by silica gel/sodium borate TLC using the developing systems described above, scraping and re-extracting with CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1, v/v). Defatted BSA·H2Cer complexes were prepared as described for other lipids (20Pagano R.E. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 29: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), omitting dialysis to remove the ethanol (10%, v/v). The solution contained 30 nmol of BSA, 15 nmol of st-H2Cer, 10 μl of ethanol, and 90 μl of phosphate buffer (100 mmNaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 7.4). A solution containing 15 nmol of substrate was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen in a 1.5 ml test tube. A solution of 1.1 mg of CHAPS in 10 μl of phosphate buffer (100 mmNaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) was added, thoroughly mixed, and sonicated for 3 min. A solution containing 15 nmol of substrate was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen in a 1.5-ml test tube. After dissolving in ethanol/dodecane (98:2, v/v; 1% final concentration), phosphate buffer (100 mmNaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) was added and the solution was sonicated for 3 min. A microsomal suspension 2The results described in this report are for rat liver microsomes; however, activity was also detected in the homogenates of rat lung, rat brain, mouse liver, and mouse brain, as well as in cultured mouse cerebellar neurons and rat B104 neuroblastoma cells. containing 600 μg of protein and a solution of 15 nmol of lipid substrate were added in a test tube, brought to a volume of 300 μl with phosphate buffer (100 mmNaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 7.4), and thoroughly mixed. All solutions were kept and mixed at 4 °C. After a preincubation time of 5 min at 37 °C, 1 μmol of NADH in 30 μl of phosphate buffer was added and the reaction mixture was incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by addition of 200 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH (83:17, v/v) on ice. Lipid extraction was achieved by addition of 343 μl of CH3OH and 22 μl of CHCl3, and vigorously mixing for 20 min. Phases were separated by centrifugation, and the lower phase was collected. The extraction procedure was repeated twice with 200 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH (83:17, v/v), each. The combined organic phases were evaporated under a steam of N2 and dissolved in 30 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1, v/v). The lipid mixture was separated by TLC using silica gel/sodium borate plates. The following were used as developing systems: CHCl3/CH3OH (9:1, v/v) for Cer/H2Cer, CHCl3/CH3OH/2 n ammonia (65:25:4, v/v) for st-GlcH2Cer/GlcCer, and CHCl3/CH3OH/2 n ammonia (60:35:8, v/v) for st-H2SM/st-SM. TLC was done twice to achieve a better separation of radiolabeled compounds. The lipids were visualized by autoradiography, and theR F values for st-H2Cer and st-Cer were 0.7 ± 0.1 and 0.6 ± 0.1, respectively (depending on the homogenity of the plates; however, a ΔR F of at least 0.1 was always observed). The lipids were recovered from the plate by scraping, and the radioactivities determined by liquid scintillation counting in a Packard 1900CA Tri-Carb analyzer using Ultima Gold (Packard, Frankfurt, Germany) as the scintillation liquid, after allowing the samples to stand at room temperatur for 1 h. A background value of radioactivity, which was subtracted from each corresponding value, was obtained by scraping an area of about the same size in each lane of the plate containing no detectable radioactivity. Rat hepatocytes were isolated and placed in primary culture, and sphingolipid biosynthesis from [14C]serine was analyzed as described previously (22Messmer T.O. Wang E. Stevens V.L. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Nutr. 1989; 119: 534-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 23Merrill Jr., A.H. Lingrell S. Wang E. Nikolova-Karakashian M. Vales T.R. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13834-13841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Briefly, to each dish (approximately 1 mg of protein/dish) was added 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 μCi of [14C]serine (for a total serine concentration of 1 mm) and 0, 5, or 10 m N-acetylcysteine (or sodium acetate). After incubation for 12 h, the lipids were extracted and acid-hydrolyzed to release the radiolabeled sphinganine and sphingosine backbones, and the radiolabeled sphingoid bases were quantified by thin layer chromatography and scintillation counting (22Messmer T.O. Wang E. Stevens V.L. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Nutr. 1989; 119: 534-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 23Merrill Jr., A.H. Lingrell S. Wang E. Nikolova-Karakashian M. Vales T.R. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13834-13841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured by the method of Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard protein. All data presented are means of at least duplicate determinations. Most single values are the mean of three to four separate determinations. All individual values are in the range of ±5% up to ±15% of the mean. The in vitro assay described under “Experimental Procedures” allowed us to characterize the enzymatic reaction that is responsible for converting dihydroceramide to ceramide. Examination of the lipid extracts from these assays by TLC (Fig. 1, lane 1) revealed that [14C]st-Cer was produced from [14C]st-H2Cer, and that these compounds accounted for at least 90% of the radiolabel. The identity of these compounds was confirmed by fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy of the radioactive material that was recovered from the regions of the TLC plate marked st-Cer and st-H2Cer in Fig. 1. Characteristic peaks were observed at m/z 426 for MH+, m/z 408 for MH+-H2O, and m/z 448 for MNa+, which were identical to those obtained from synthetic st-Cer. In addition, when the extracted st-Cer was reduced by H2/Pd(OAc)2 (1.5 torr, 1 h) in methanol, it was converted to st-H2Cer. These procedures were applied to all the substrates used in this study, and the respective enzyme products were obtained. The remaining radioactive products seen in Fig. 1 were identified as [1-14C]octanoic acid (from cleavage of either the substrate or product by ceramidase, which is known to be present in microsomal preparations), and uncharacterized polar product(s) (which are likely to include [14C]sphingomyelin). These products were not formed when the enzyme was denatured prior to use in the assay (Fig. 1, lane 2). Thin layer chromatography of the products using CHCl3/CH3OH (9:1, v/v) as the developing system (which separates the cis and trans compounds by approximately 0.15 R F) revealed that the double bond introduced by this enzyme had a trans- or (E)-configuration, which is the same stereochemistry as for ceramides that are produced in vivo. The conversion of st-H2Cer to st-Cer required a reductant; the apparentK m for NADH was 120 μm, and NADPH worked equally well (data not shown). Ascorbic acid, another water-soluble electron donor, was able to substitute for a pyridine nucleotide in the assay; however, ascorbate also inhibited the activity with an apparent IC50 of 10 μm. The requirement for an electron donor (rather than acceptor) suggests that this reaction is catalyzed by a desaturase rather than a dehydrogenase. If so, molecular oxygen would be required as the electron acceptor in the desaturation process, and an oxygen scavenger, such as pyrogallol (1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene), should be inhibitory. As shown in Fig. 2, replacing the air in the assay tube with argon caused a small reduction in enzymatic activity (the lack of complete inhibition is not surprising because the solutions were not purged of residual oxygen); moreover, the conversion of st-H2Cer to st-Cer was strongly inhibited by adding increasing concentrations of pyrogallol, with >90% inhibition at 30 mm (no activity was detected at concentrations higher than 30 mm). The inhibition by pyrogallol was less potent if the assays were conducted under an oxygen atmosphere rather than argon; thus, it can be concluded that molecular oxygen is required for enzymatic introduction of the double bond into st-H2Cer. The characteristics of this activity (presence in microsomes, utilization of a reduced pyridine nucleotide, and requirement for oxygen) are similar to the microsomal stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (Δ9 desaturase, reviewed in Ref. 25Jeffcoat R. Essays Biochem. 1979; 15: 1-36PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme is part of a multi-enzyme complex, which consists of NADH-cytochromeb 5 reductase, cytochromeb 5, and Δ9 desaturase. The knowledge about this system and its inhibitors gave us the opportunity to study further the likelihood that conversion of st-H2Cer to st-Cer is catalyzed by an analogous desaturase. First, cyanide is known to inhibit the Δ9 desaturase activity, because it is bound more tightly than O2, and we found that NaCN also inhibits the in vitro conversion of st-H2Cer to st-Cer with an IC50 of 100 μm. Second, divalent copper blocks electron transport to molecular oxygen in Δ9 desaturase (by inhibiting the formation of intermediate superoxide anions from O2) (26Sreekrishna K. Joshi V.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 619: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and was inhibitory for dihydroceramide desaturation as well (with an IC50 of 31 μm). Third, antibodies raised against cytochrome b 5 have been found to inhibit plasmalogen desaturase utilizing the cytochromeb 5 electron transport system (27Paltauf F. Prough R.A. Masters B.S.S. Johnston J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2661-2662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, when rat liver microsomes were incubated for 30 min with different amounts of anti-cytochrome b 5 antibodies prior to the desaturase assay, formation of ceramide was inhibited by 48% up to 82% compared with controls when varying the dilution of the antibody serum from 1:1000 to undiluted, respectively (four different dilutions; data not shown). Despite these similarities, an iron(II)-chelator (bathophenanthroline sulfonate) that inhibits Δ9 desaturase by removing non-heme bound and catalytically important iron(II) (28Strittmatter P. Spatz L. Corcoran D. Rogers M.J. Setlow B. Redline R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4565-4569Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) had no effect on dihydroceramide desaturation. Thus, dihydroceramide desaturase and Δ9 desaturase are likely to have similar electron transport system(s), but are clearly distinct enzymes. A Lineweaver-Burk plot of the activity with varying concentrations ofN-octanoyl-d-erythro-C18-sphinganine (st-H2Cer) (and 20 mm NADH) produced an apparent K m for this substrate of 340 μm. Other dihydroceramide analogs that differed in chain length, stereochemistry, and type of headgroup were also analyzed (Fig.3). 3The results shown in Fig. 3 were obtained using method C to solubilize the substrates, but similar results were found using the other two methods described under “Experimental Procedures.”The in vitro activity decreased as the chain length of the amide-linked fatty acid of the H2Cer was increased (i.e. 18/8 > 18/12 > 18/18), presumably due to the greater insolubility of the longer chain homologs. No desaturation of the unmodified sphingoid base (sphinganine) was detected. The activity was lower with a truncated sphinganine analog than with the natural, 18-carbon sphingoid base (cf. 8/8 and 18/8 H2-Cer) (Fig. 3). The stereochemistry of the sphingoid base had a large effect on activity; the activity withN-octanoyl-d-erythro-C18-sphinganine (DE-18/8-H2Cer) was approximately 10-fold higher than with the unnatural l-threo-isomer (LT-18/8-H2Cer); a 2-fold difference was seen with DE-12/8-H2Cer versusLT-12/8-H2Cer. Somewhat surprisingly, dihydrosphingomyelin (DE-18/8-H2SM) was a relatively good substrate for the desaturase, yielding 20% of the activity with DE-18/8-H2Cer. In contrast, st-GlcH2Cer was not desaturated at a detectable ratein vitro, although there was considerable hydrolysis of GlcH2Cer by the microsomes (50–60% of the total radioactive substrate added) and Cer was produced, presumably due to desaturation of the st-H2Cer. To exclude the possibility that GlcCer was formed from GlcH2Cer, but was not detected because it was hydrolyzed, the hydrolysis was inhibited with conduritol β-epoxide (a potent β-glucosidase inhibitor that reduced the hydrolysis to <10% of the total radioactivity), and no desaturation of st-GlcH2Cer was detected. The conclusion that H2SM is a substrate for the desaturase is more definitive than the lack of activity with st-GlcH2Cer, because the latter might be affected by the physical state of the substrate or another artifact of the in vitro assay conditions. Nonetheless, these observations are consistent with studies that have been conducted in intact cells. Smith and Merrill (29Smith E.R. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18749-18758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) have reported that de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis from [14C]serine by J774 cells initially produces large amounts of complex sphingolipids with a [14C]sphinganine backbone, and which are converted to the more typical sphingosine-containing species over time. Another study of the metabolism of NBD-labeled sphingolipids by HT-29 cells 4Kok, J. W., Nicolova-Karakashian, M., Klappe, K., Alexander, C., and Merrill, A. H., Jr. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 21128–21136. has found that NBD-H2Cer is initially incorporated into Glc-NBD-H2Cer, but direct desaturation of Glc-NBD-H2Cer was not observed. Thus, as was seen on our study of the desaturase activity in vitro, desaturation of GlcH2Cer actually reflected hydrolysis of the glycoconjugate to the (NBD-)H2Cer, which was oxidized and (in the case of the studies of the NBD-sphingolipids in intact cells) the glycosyl headgroup was added. The addition of the product of the desaturase reaction, st-Cer, to thein vitro assay mixture (with DE-18/8-H2Cer as the substrate) was found to inhibit the activity of the desaturase with an IC50 of 140 μm. Future studies should determine whether this product inhibition is competitive or represents allosteric regulation of the desaturase. The activity of dihydroceramide desaturase is relatively stable: approximately 50% of the activity was lost after 1 year of storage at −80 °C, or 7 days at 4 °C, or 3 h at 37 °C. When the assays were conducted at varying temperature, activity could be detected at 5 °C (about 8% of maximal activity) and steadily increased with the incubation temperature until a maximum of 43 °C (the half-maximal enzymatic activities were at 27 °C and 47 °C); above 60 °C, no activity was detected (data not shown). Optimal activity was obtained over a fairly wide pH range (pH 6.5–9) (data not shown). A much lower activity was obtained at pH < 6.5; however, this may reflect a buffer effect (at least in part) because there was a large drop in activity of about 80% at pH 6 when the assay was conducted with citrate buffer instead of phosphate buffer. Nevertheless, further decrease of citrate buffer pH value (down to pH 4) resulted in further reduction of activity. When the assays were conducted at neutral pH, the same activities were found when HEPES/NaOH, MOPS/KOH, NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, or glycine/NaOH were used over a range of concentrations (50–300 mm); however, the activity using Tris/HCl was reduced by approximately 30%. Addition of various cations (CaCl2 at 0.1–100 μm, MgCl2 at 1 μm to 1 mm, MnCl2 at 1 μm to 1 mm, FeCl2 at 1–100 μm, KCl at 10–150 mm, NaCl at 10–100 mm, Na2SO4 at 10–100 mm, and EDTA at 10–100 mm) had no effect on the activity, whereas ZnCl2 (at 1 mm) decreased the activity by 25% (data not shown). Thus, the enzyme is tolerant to many inorganic cations. In contrast, the activity was inhibited 81% by addition of 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), a common reagent used to protect protein thiol groups from oxidation. This may explain why this reaction has not been observed in previous studies since 10 mm DTT is commonly used in preparing microsomes. Once this observation was made, our protocol omitted DTT from the procedure. A possible explanation for this effect is that dihydroceramide desaturase may have one (or more) disulfide bonds that is (are) required for protein stability and/or catalytic activity. Previous studies have shown that radiolabeled serine is incorporated into Cer and SM by intact rat hepatocytes with little accumulation of H2Cer (22Messmer T.O. Wang E. Stevens V.L. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Nutr. 1989; 119: 534-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 23Merrill Jr., A.H. Lingrell S. Wang E. Nikolova-Karakashian M. Vales T.R. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13834-13841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar); therefore, the desaturase reaction is not rate-limiting in these cells (at least, under the conditions used). Since dihydroceramide desaturase is inhibited by DTT, we examined whether elevation of cellular thiols would suppress the formation of ceramide(s) by cultured rat hepatocytes. These experiments were conducted by incubating the hepatocytes with increasing concentrations of N-acetyl-l-cysteine, which is taken up by hepatocytes and deacetylated to increase the levels of intracellular thiols (glutathione and protein thiols) (30Larrauri A. Fabra R. Gomez-Lechon M.J. Trullenque R. Castell J.V. Mol. Toxicol. 1988; 1: 301-311Google Scholar, 31Nakagawa Y. Nakajima K. Moore G. Moldeus P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 270: 341-348PubMed Google Scholar, 32Duval D.L. Sieg D.J. Billings R.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 699-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 33Meister A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4,N-acetyl-l-cysteine did not cause the accumulation of label in H2Cer, but reduced the amount of label in sphingosine-containing sphingolipids by approximately half. Since dihydroceramides have been found to accumulate in several other cell systems (9Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3764-3769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Smith E.R. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18749-18758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), it would be interesting to know if this is due to a difference in the levels of dihydroceramide desaturase per se or its modulation by factors such as the cellular thiol status. For the first time, it has become possible to demonstrate the in vitro conversion of dihydroceramide to ceramide, to assign the name dihydroceramide desaturase to the enzyme that catalyzes this reaction, and to delineate the pathway for introduction of the 4,5-trans-double bond of sphingosine as shown in Fig. 5 (i.e. at the level of dihydroceramide and dihydrosphingomyelin). This not only fills a missing “gap” in the pathway of sphingolipid biosynthesis, it also enables more sophisticated studies of how cells regulate the formation of ceramide de novo. Control of this step of sphingolipid metabolism is clearly important because ceramide affects cell growth, differentiation, diverse cell behaviors, and programmed cell death, and induction of ceramide synthesis by some chemotherapeutic agents (such as daunorubicin) has been proposed to mediate their toxicity (3Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Since dihydroceramides are much less potent than ceramides in many signaling events (34Bielawska A. Linardic C.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18493-18497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the finding that dihydrosphingomyelin can serve as a substrate for the desaturase suggests that cells could minimize the amount of free ceramide that is produced during membrane biogenesis by utilizing the so far hypothetical pathway dihydroceramide → dihydrosphingomyelin → sphingomyelin. The existence of this pathway in vivo also depends on the topology of the enzymes involved. Sphingomyelin formation has been assigned to the luminal side of the Golgi membranes (35Futerman A.H. Stieger B. Hubbard A.L. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8650-8657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas desaturation of dihydroceramide presumably occurs at ER membranes with so far unknown topology."
https://openalex.org/W2317760542,The p53 tumor suppressor orchestrates a number of important genes involved in cell-cycle control and apoptosis. Mice deficient for p53 show a high incidence of cancer but are developmentally normal suggesting that compensatory mechanisms exist in embryogenesis and differentiation. The new KET protein is the first mammalian protein with strong homology to p53 in all evolutionary conserved regions. This conservation makes a functional redundancy of the two proteins in cell-cycle control possible. KET is expressed during embryonic development and in certain adult tissues. Among all of the known p53 proteins of different species KET is most closely related to that found in squid. The relationship between KET and the invertebrate p53 protein sheds light on the evolutionary origin of p53. KET appears to be an ancestral p53-related protein in vertebrates with a possible role in development and differentiation while the ubiquitously expressed p53 protein attained its general role as `guardian of the genome' during evolution.

https://openalex.org/W1985238450,"The farnesyltransferase (FTase) inhibitor FTI-277 is highly effective at blocking oncogenic H-Ras but not K-Ras4B processing and signaling. While inhibition of processing and signaling of oncogenic K-Ras4B is more sensitive to the geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGTase I) inhibitor GGTI-286 than it is to FTI-277 in K-Ras4B-transformed NIH3T3 cells, the sensitivity of K-Ras as well as H- and N-Ras to the CAAX peptidomimetics in human tumor cell lines is not known. Here, we report that a panel of five human carcinoma cell lines from pancreatic, pulmonary, and bladder origins all express H-, N-, and K-Ras, and their respective prenylation sensitivities to the FTase and GGTase I inhibitors is variable. In all of the cell lines investigated, the prenylation of N-Ras was highly sensitive to FTI-277, and in two of the cell lines, N-Ras showed slight sensitivity to GGTI-298, an analog of GGTI-286. Although the prenylation of H-Ras was also sensitive to FTI-277, complete inhibition of H-Ras processing even at high concentrations of FTI-277 and/or GGTI-298 was never achieved. The prenylation of K-Ras, on the other hand, was highly resistant to FTI-277 and GGTI-298. Most significantly, treatment of human tumor cell lines with both inhibitors was required for inhibition of K-Ras prenylation. In one cell line, the human lung adenocarcinoma A-549, prenylation of K-Ras was highly resistant even when co-treated with both inhibitors. Furthermore, soft agar experiments demonstrated that in all the human tumor cell lines tested inhibition of K-Ras prenylation was not necessary for inhibition of anchorage-independent growth. In addition, although GGTI-298 had very little effect on soft agar growth, the combination of FTI-277 and GGTI-298 resulted in significant growth inhibition. Therefore, the results demonstrate that while FTI-277 inhibits N-Ras and H-Ras processing in the human tumor cell lines evaluated, inhibition of K-Ras processing requires both an FTase inhibitor as well as a GGTase I inhibitor, and that inhibition of human tumor growth in soft agar does not require inhibition of oncogenic K-Ras processing."

To investigate these issues, we examined the biochemical response of Itk to TCR stimulation. We found that Itk is tyrosine-phosphorylated after TCR cross-linking and that this phosphorylation depends on the presence of functional Lck. To determine if this Lck dependence results from direct phosphorylation of Itk by Lck, we generated recombinant Itk and Lck using a baculovirus expression system and used these proteins in subsequent biochemical analyses. We found that Lck phosphorylates Itk upon co-expression in insect cells and, further, that this phosphorylation of Itk results in increased Itk in vitro kinase activity. The major site of Lck phosphorylation on Itk was mapped to the conserved tyrosine (Tyr511) in the activation loop of the Itk kinase domain. Substitution of this tyrosine with phenylalanine abolishes Itk kinase activity in insect cells, indicating that phosphorylation at this site plays a critical role in regulating Itk function. The Tec family tyrosine kinase Itk has been implicated in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, yet its precise role and mechanism of activation remain undefined. To investigate these issues, we examined the biochemical response of Itk to TCR stimulation.

Engagement of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) 1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T cell antigen receptor; ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif; PLC, phospholipase C; Btk, Bruton's tyrosine kinase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. by physiological ligands triggers multiple signal transduction cascades (for review, see Ref. 1Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 197-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The initiation of these cascades depends on the activation of Lck and Fyn, cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases associated with the activated antigen receptor. These Src family kinases phosphorylate activation motifs (ITAMs) in the CD3ε and CD3ζ subunits of the TCR. The tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAMs recruit additional Src homology-2 domain-containing signaling molecules, including the tyrosine kinase Zap-70, which binds doubly phosphorylated ITAMs via tandem Src homology-2 domains. This recruitment of Zap-70 facilitates both its tyrosine phosphorylation and activation. Zap-70 then contributes to the activation of downstream signaling pathways, leading to the eventual phosphorylation and activation of PLCγ. The resulting cleavage of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate by activated PLCγ generates the second messengers diacyl glycerol and inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate, thus activating protein kinase C and mobilizing intracellular calcium, respectively. TCR stimulation also leads to the activation, recruitment, and/or phosphorylation of additional downstream signaling molecules, including both widely expressed proteins, such as phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase, Ras, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and Jun N-terminal kinase, and hematopoietic-specific proteins such as Vav, SLP-76, and pp36. In most cases, the precise mechanisms by which Zap-70, Lck, and Fyn activate these proteins have not been fully elucidated. The roles of additional tyrosine kinases, such as Itk (2Gibson S. Leung B.

It is likely that these tyrosine kinases will be found to synergize with Zap-70, Lck, and Fyn to facilitate the activation of the signaling proteins described above. Genetic evidence has implicated the Tec family tyrosine kinase Itk in signaling through the TCR. T cells from Itk-deficient mice have a defect in TCR-induced proliferation that can be overcome by bypassing the TCR with phorbol ester and calcium ionophore treatment (8Liao X.C. Littman D.R. Immunity. 1995; 3: 757-769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In addition, Itk-deficient T cells produce virtually no interleukin-2 and fail to generate a calcium flux in response to TCR stimulation. 2K. Liu, S. C. Bunnell, and L. J. Berg, unpublished observations. Finally, Itk-deficient mice have a defect in T cell development consistent with decreased TCR signaling during positive selection in the thymus (8Liao X.C. Littman D.R. Immunity. 1995; 3: 757-769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Further support for the involvement of Tec family kinases in antigen receptor signaling pathways comes from studies of Btk, a Tec family member expressed primarily in B cells and mast cells. Btk was first identified as the gene defective in the human and murine immunodeficiencies X-linked agammaglobulinemia (9Vetrie D. Vorechovsky I. Sideras P. Holland J. Davies A. Flinter F.

In addition, Btk-deficient B cells isolated from X-linked immunodeficiency mice have defects in calcium mobilization and proliferative responses to antigen receptor stimulation (17Scher I. Adv. Immunol. 1982; 33: 1-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Despite these genetic data, biochemical evidence clarifying the role of Itk in TCR signaling is sparse. One study has shown that Itk is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to TCR stimulation of Jurkat cells but not of Jurkat cells lacking the Src family kinase, Lck (18Gibson S. August A. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. Dupont B. Mills G.B. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2716-2722PubMed Google Scholar). We confirm these findings and, further, using recombinant proteins expressed in insect cells, show that Lck directly phosphorylates Itk. We also demonstrate that the phosphorylation of Itk by Lck leads to enhanced Itk in vitro kinase activity. Finally, we map the major site of tyrosine phosphorylation by Lck and show that a mutant Itk protein with a tyrosine to phenylalanine substitution at this position has dramatically reduced kinase activity in vivo. Jurkat clone E6–1 and J.CaM1.6 cells (19Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar), obtained from ATCC, were cultured as described (20Bunnell S.C. Henry P.A. Kolluri R. Kirchhausen T. Rickles R.J. Berg L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25646-25656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and were shown to have equivalent levels of surface TCR/CD3 expression (data not shown). Anti-CD28 antibody 9.3 was kindly provided by Craig Thompson (University of Chicago, Chicago, IL). Anti-CD8 and anti-CD3 antibody-producing hybridomas, OKT8 and OKT3, respectively, were purchased from ATCC; antibodies were purified from tissue culture supernatants on Protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). The cross-linking secondary antibody, rabbit anti-mouse Ig, was purchased from Sigma. Anti-Lck antibody 3A5 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G.10 was kindly provided by Brian Druker (Oregon Health Science University, Portland, OR). Anti-Itk monoclonal antibodies 2F12 and 7F10 were generated by injecting Balb/C mice with a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein of Itk amino acids 1–26; monoclonal antibody 10B2 was generated against a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein of Itk amino acids 97–174. Splenocytes from the immunized mice were fused with the P3.AG myeloma line. 2F12 and 7F10 are both IgG1, and 10B2 is IgG2a. All baculovirus Itk immunoprecipitations and kinase assays were done using 2F12 ascites; for all other experiments, ascites fluid containing each antibody were used interchangeably. The CD8-CD28 chimera was generated by subcloning a PCR product encoding the carboxyl-terminal 42 amino acids of CD28 into PCRII/CD8, which was then transferred into expression vector EMCV.SRα (gifts of Ian MacNeil, ARIAD, Cambridge, MA). To generate stable lines, the expression vector was linearized and transfected into Jurkat T cells (15 μg of expression vector and 107 cells in 300 μl of media, electroporated at 960 microfarads, 250-V GenePulser, Bio-Rad) and selected in 1 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Neomycin-resistant lines were screened for surface expression of CD8 by flow cytometry. Sublines expressing high levels of the CD8-CD28 chimera were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. To assess CD8 and CD3 surface expression, cells were stained with OKT8 or OKT3, respectively, followed by goat anti-mouse Ig-FITC (Cappel). Jurkat and J.CaM1.6 cells were stimulated, and lysates were prepared as described previously (20Bunnell S.C. Henry P.A. Kolluri R. Kirchhausen T. Rickles R.J. Berg L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25646-25656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were precleared and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Itk mAb or anti-Lck mAb prebound to protein G-agarose beads (Life Technologies, Inc.). Immunoprecipitates were extensively washed with either lysis buffer or lysis buffer supplemented with 1% deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS (where indicated). Immunoprecipitates were then either subjected to an in vitrokinase assay or directly resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For Western blotting, proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore Corp.), blocked and probed as described previously (20Bunnell S.C. Henry P.A. Kolluri R. Kirchhausen T. Rickles R.J. Berg L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25646-25656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Sf9 insect cells were obtained from ATCC. Cells were grown and baculovirus stocks were produced using the BAC-to-BAC system (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described in the system manual with one exception: cultures were carried for 10 days after Bacmid DNA transfection to produce optimal virus titers (1–3 × 108 pfu/ml). K390R and Y511F mutants of Itk were produced by site-directed mutagenesis. Sf9 cells were infected with Itk-expressing or wild-type baculovirus (100 μl of high titer virus/100-mm dish unless otherwise indicated) and/or with Lck-expressing virus (1, 5, or 10 μl of high titer virus/100-mm dish unless otherwise indicated) and incubated for 72 h prior to harvesting. Immunoprecipitates were rinsed once with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and resuspended at room temperature in 25 μl of kinase assay buffer. Buffer and kinase assay conditions were as described (21Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, New York1992Google Scholar). For autophosphorylation assays, samples were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and subjected to autoradiography. Quantitation was determined by densitometry using a pdi (Huntington Station, New York) machine and software. To assess phosphorylation of the RR-src peptide (22Casnellie J.E. Harrison M.L. Pike L.J. Hellstrom K.E. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), samples were spotted onto p81 phosphocellulose filter paper discs (Whatman) and analyzed by liquid scintillation counting as described (21Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, New York1992Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were co-infected with baculovirus expressing kinase-inactive Itk (Itk-KR, 100 μl/100-mm dish) and Lck (10 μl/100-mm dish) for 72 h. Itk was affinity-purified with Itk mAb bound to protein G-Sepharose and loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis preparative gel. The Itk band, containing approximately 5 μg of protein, was excised and subjected to extensive destaining, followed by in geltryptic digestion as described by Hellman et al. (23Hellman U. Wernstedt C., G- ñez J. Heldin C.-H. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), but without the addition of 0.02% Tween. The resulting peptide mixture was separated by microbore high performance liquid chromatography using a Zorbax C18 1.0 × 150-mm reverse-phase column on a Hewlett-Packard 1090 HPLC/1040 diode array detector. Monitoring peaks of absorbance at 205 nm, 124 peptide fractions were collected over 90 min. Fraction 55 was collected at 41 min, and fraction 107 was collected at 74 min. One-half the volume of each fraction was spotted onto high retention polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, 4G.10. Approximately 50 pmol of synthetic tyrosine-phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated peptides (Tufts University Peptide Facility) were spotted as controls. The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was fitted into the manifold and wetted with 100% methanol. Samples, diluted to 50% methanol in a 96-well plate, were rapidly loaded using a multichannel pipetter. The membrane was allowed to air dry overnight in the manifold. The filter was then blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody as described above. Phosphotyrosine-positive fractions were screened for length and homogeneity by matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry on a Finnigan Lasermat 2000 (Hemel, United Kingdom). Strategies for peak selection, reverse-phase separation, and Edman microsequencing have been previously described (24Lane W.S. Galat A. Harding M.W. Schreiber S.L. J. Protein Chem. 1991; 10: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequences of tryptic peptides in fraction 55 were obtained by automated Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems 477A protein sequencer (Foster City, CA). Trypsin digestion, HPLC fractionation, mass spectrometry, and peptide sequencing were performed by the Harvard Microchemistry Facility. Due to similarity between Itk and Btk and to the genetic evidence implicating Itk as a proximal signaling molecule downstream of the TCR (8Liao X.C. Littman D.R. Immunity. 1995; 3: 757-769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), we were interested in examining the biochemical responses of Itk to TCR stimulation. For these experiments, we used a T cell tumor line, Jurkat. Jurkat cells were stimulated by TCR cross-linking, and the Itk protein was immunoprecipitated using the Itk monoclonal antibody 2F12. Itk immunoprecipitates were probed with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, 4G.10. As shown in Fig.1 A, Itk becomes highly phosphorylated within 2 min of TCR stimulation; this phosphorylation is maintained for approximately 5 min and diminishes by 15 min poststimulation. Given the rapid kinetics of Itk tyrosine phosphorylation after TCR cross-linking, it seemed likely that this phosphorylation was mediated by an Src family kinase activated by TCR signaling. We therefore tested whether Itk tyrosine phosphorylation would still occur in a variant line of Jurkat cells, J.CaM1, which lacks functional Lck (19Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). When J.CaM1 cells were TCR-stimulated by cross-linking CD3ε, we were unable to detect tyrosine phosphorylation of Itk (Fig. 1 A). These results indicate that Itk is downstream of Lck in the TCR signal transduction pathway, as has previously been reported (18Gibson S. August A. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. Dupont B. Mills G.B. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2716-2722PubMed Google Scholar). To further address the dependence of Itk tyrosine phosphorylation on Lck, we also examined Jurkat and J.CaM1 cells that were treated with pervanadate, a potent inhibitor of phosphotyrosine phosphatases. Pervanadate treatment shifts the balance between the competing activities of kinases and phosphatases, allowing tyrosine phosphorylation to accumulate on a variety of cellular proteins. This experiment, therefore, addresses the possibility that the lack of Itk tyrosine phosphorylation results from the increased activity of a tyrosine phosphatase in the J.CaM1 cells. As can be seen in Fig.1 B, pervanadate treatment of Jurkat cells for 2 min leads to the accumulation of tyrosine phosphorylation on Itk; increased phosphorylation is observed with longer treatment times (up to 20 min). In contrast, pervanadate treatment of J.CaM1 cells, which lack the tyrosine kinase Lck, leads to barely detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of Itk, even after 20 min. These data confirm that the presence of a functional Lck kinase is essential for the tyrosine phosphorylation of Itk in Jurkat cells. Several recent studies have reported an association between Itk and the cytoplasmic tail of the T cell co-stimulatory molecule CD28 and the phosphorylation and activation of Itk in response to CD28 stimulation (25August A. Gibson S. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. Mills G.B. Dupont B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9347-9351Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 26Raab M. Cai Y.C. Heyeck S.D. Bunnell S.C.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7079-7083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We attempted to confirm the phosphorylation of Itk in Jurkat cells after CD28 stimulation with anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody 9.3, but were unsuccessful at doing so (data not shown). Due to limited access to this antibody, we chose to pursue this issue by generating a chimeric protein containing the extracellular and transmembrane domains of human CD8α fused to the cytoplasmic domain of human CD28 (CD8/CD28). This chimeric protein was transfected into Jurkat cells, and cell lines were generated that stably expressed the CD8/CD28 chimeric protein. Fig. 2 Ashows the flow cytometry analysis confirming the expression of CD8 on the transfected cells, but not on the parental Jurkat cells. This analysis also indicated that the transfected cells express a slightly lower level of the TCR·CD3 complex compared with the parental Jurkat cells. Using these transfected cells, we compared the level of tyrosine phosphorylation on Itk induced by TCR (anti-CD3 cross-linking)versus CD28 (anti-CD8 cross-linking) stimulation. As can be seen in Fig. 2 B, cross-linking of the TCR, but not of the CD8/CD28 chimera, led to rapid and substantial phosphorylation of Itk. While some weak phosphorylation of Itk could be detected after CD8/CD28 stimulation, the overall magnitude of this response was minor compared with the response induced after TCR stimulation and was similar to that seen in the absence of primary antibody. Furthermore, co-cross-linking the CD8/CD28 chimera with the TCR did not enhance the phosphorylation of Itk relative to TCR cross-linking (data not shown). It should be noted that we observed only very weak changes in overall tyrosine phosphorylation in total lysates of CD28- or CD8/CD28-stimulated cells (data not shown); thus, our failure to observe significant tyrosine phosphorylation of Itk may correlate with this poor induction of tyrosine phosphorylation. The data described above indicate that Itk is downstream of the TCR and that TCR-induced Itk phosphorylation is dependent on the Lck kinase. To test the role of Lck in Itk phosphorylation more directly, we generated recombinant Itk and Lck proteins in Sf9 insect cells using the baculovirus expression system. Baculoviruses encoding Itk and Lck were generated. We also generated a mutant form of the Itk protein, containing a single amino acid substitution of a conserved lysine in the kinase domain (Itk K390R; referred to as Itk-KR). In many other kinases, substitution of this lysine with arginine generates a kinase-inactive form of the protein (28Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 29Hannick M. Donoghue D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Finally, a baculovirus was generated that encodes a kinase-inactive form of the Lck protein (Lck K273R; referred to as Lck-KR). These baculoviruses were used to infect Sf9 insect cells; subsequently, the tyrosine phosphorylation of Itk was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 3, our anti-Itk antibodies are highly specific; following expression of Lck alone, neither Itk nor tyrosine phosphoproteins were detected in Itk immunoprecipitates. However, when Itk was expressed alone, the immunoprecipitated Itk protein was found to be tyrosine-phosphorylated. Co-infection of the insect cells with baculoviruses encoding Itk and increasing amounts of Lck led to increased tyrosine phosphorylation on Itk. In contrast, co-infection of Itk with kinase-inactive Lck (Lck-KR) had no effect on Itk tyrosine phosphorylation. These results suggested that Lck could directly phosphorylate Itk; however, we could not rule out an indirect effect of the Lck kinase on Itk autophosphorylation activity. We therefore examined this issue using the kinase-inactive form of Itk, Itk-KR. When expressed alone in Sf9 cells, Itk-KR has severely reduced autophosphorylation activity, as indicated by the unphosphorylated state of the immunoprecipitated Itk protein. Co-infection of Itk-KR with Lck led to substantial tyrosine phosphorylation of Itk; in contrast, co-infection with Lck-KR did not. Together, these data indicate that co-expression of Itk with kinase-active Lck leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of Itk by Lck, most likely due to direct phosphorylation. Since we observed that Itk is phosphorylated by Lck when the two proteins are co-expressed in insect cells, we were interested in determining whether this phosphorylation had any effect on Itk kinase activity. At the time of these studies, only one substrate had been reported for the Itk kinase, the RR-src peptide derived from the kinase domain of Src (18Gibson S. August A. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. Dupont B. Mills G.B. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2716-2722PubMed Google Scholar, 27Gibson S. August A. Branch D. Dupont B. Mills G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7079-7083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, in our system we could not detect Itk phosphorylation of this substrate inin vitro kinase assays (see below). Therefore, we examined instead Itk autophosphorylation activity. We performed these experiments using the recombinant Itk protein generated by baculovirus infection of insect cells, allowing the use of a kinase-inactive Itk mutant as a control. To confirm that the K390R mutation in the Itk kinase domain did abolish kinase activity, we examined autophosphorylation activity of Itk and Itk-KR. Itk was isolated from infected cells and subjected to in vitro kinase assays. As can be seen in Fig. 4 A, duplicate samples of wild-type Itk show strong in vitrokinase activity, with a major phosphorylated band present at 72 kDa; in contrast, Itk-KR has virtually no in vitro kinase activity in this assay. The two minor phosphorylated bands visible at molecular weights lower than full-length Itk in the wild-type Itk kinase assay are likely to be breakdown products of Itk. This experiment indicates that the K390R mutation abolishes Itk in vitro kinase activity and demonstrates that the in vitro kinase activity observed with wild-type Itk is not due to a contaminating kinase activity present in the immunoprecipitates. To determine whether Lck phosphorylation of Itk affects Itk kinase activity, insect cells were co-infected with baculoviruses encoding Lck and either wild-type Itk or kinase-inactive Itk. Itk was then immunoprecipitated and subjected to in vitro kinase assays. Insect cells infected with empty baculovirus or expressing Lck alone show no detectable in vitro kinase activity in Itk immune complexes (Fig. 4 B). When Itk is expressed alone and immunoprecipitated, kinase activity is observed. After co-expression with increasing amounts of Lck, the Itk in vitro kinase activity increases markedly; quantitation of this increase in three independent experiments indicates that Itk is 2.5 ± 0.1-fold more active after phosphorylation by Lck. To ensure that this increase in phosphorylation is due to increased Itk kinase activity, and not to contaminating Lck in the Itk immunoprecipitates, this analysis was also performed with the kinase-inactive Itk control. As can be seen in Fig.4 B, Itk-KR expressed alone has no detectable kinase activity; after co-expression with increasing amounts of Lck, a small amount of kinase activity was observed in the Itk immunoprecipitates. This modest phosphorylation is most likely due to Lck contaminating the Itk immunoprecipitates. However, this weak background is unlikely to account for the increased kinase activity observed with wild-type Itk upon co-expression of Lck. Interestingly, this background activity probably results from weak binding between Itk and Lck, since no such background is seen in Itk immunoprecipitates from cells infected with Lck alone (Fig. 4 B). Although a number of measures were taken to eliminate Lck contamination from the Itk immunoprecipitates, including stringent wash conditions (RIPA buffer: lysis buffer supplemented with 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), a small amount of Lck apparently remained associated with Itk in the in vitro kinase assays. To further assess the level of Lck contamination, we subjected the Itk immune complexes to kinase assays using an exogenous substrate of the Lck kinase. This substrate, RR-src, is a peptide derived from the sequence flanking the autophosphorylation site in the Src kinase domain (22Casnellie J.E. Harrison M.L. Pike L.J. Hellstrom K.E. Krebs E.G. Proc.

Interestingly, this substrate has been used by others as an exogenous substrate for assessing Itk in vitro kinase activity. When in vitro kinase assays were performed, low levels of activity on the RR-src peptide were observed in Itk immune complexes from cells infected with either empty baculovirus or Itk baculovirus (Fig.5). A similar low background was seen in Itk immune complexes from cells infected with the Itk-KR baculovirus. Together, these data indicate that Itk does not detectably phosphorylate the RR-src peptide.

Activation of c-myc expression in quiescent cells is sufficient to mediate cell cycle entry, whereas inhibition of c-myc expression causes cycling cells to withdraw from the cell cycle. To search for components of the cell cycle machinery that are targets of c-Myc, we have made a mutant c-Myc protein, named MadMyc, that actively represses c-myc target genes. Expression of MadMyc in cycling NIH3T3 cells causes a significant accumulation of cells in G1. The MadMyc-induced G1 arrest is rescued by ectopic expression of cyclin E/CDK2 and cyclin D1/CDK4, but not by Cdc25A, a known cell cycle target of c-Myc. The MadMyc G1 arrest does not require the presence of a functional retinoblastoma protein and is associated with a strong reduction in cyclin E/CDK2 kinase activity in arrested cells. MadMyc does not cause alterations in the expression levels of cyclin E, CDK2, p27kip1, cyclin D1 or CDK4 in G1-arrested cells. These data indicate that inhibition of c-Myc activity in exponentially growing cells leads to G1 arrest through loss of cyclin E-associated kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2317025328,"An allelotype covering all autosomes was constructed for the embryonal form of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) in order to identify regions encompassing tumorsuppressor genes (TSG) involved in ERMS. Thusfar most studies were focussed on chromosome 11p15.5, which frequently shows loss of heterozygozity (LOH) in embryonal tumors like RMS and Wilms' tumor (WT). In this study we show that, besides LOH of chromosome 11p15.5 (72%), LOH of chromosome 16q was present in 54% of the tumors analysed. Delineation of these two regions shows that the smallest region of overlap (SRO) for chromosome 11 was between D11S988 and D11S922. This region, estimated to be 7 cM and 3-5 Mb, is also the location of the putative Wilms' tumor WT2 TSG. It contains several genes including IGF2 and potential tumorsuppressor genes like H19 and p57kip2, which might contribute to the carcinogenesis of RMS. Analysis of chromosome 16q LOH defined the SRO between D16S752 and D16S413. LOH of chromosome 16 is also found in other tumors, including WT. Our data suggest that genes involved in the development of RMS and WT may not only be similar for chromosome 11 but also for chromosome 16."

Mice lacking CBF subunits or expressing the CBF beta-SMMHC or AML1-ETO oncoproteins failed to develop definitive hematopoiesis. To investigate these effects on hematopoiesis, we expressed CBF beta-SMMHC from the metallothionein promoter, in both 32D cl3 myeloid cells and Ba/F3 B-lymphoid cells. Addition of zinc increased CBF beta-SMMHC levels more than tenfold, with higher levels evident in Ba/F3 lines. Levels obtained in 32D cl3 cells were similar to those of endogenous CBF beta. Indirect immunofluorescence revealed zinc-inducible speckled, nuclear staining in Ba/F3 cells and diffuse nuclear staining in 32D cl3 cells. CBF beta-SMMHC reduced endogenous CBF DNA-binding fivefold in both cell types, increased cell generation time 1.9-fold, on average, in 32D cl3 cells and 1.5-fold in Ba/ F3 cells and decreased tritiated thymidine incorporation into DNA correspondingly. CBF beta-SMMHC increased the proportion of cells in G1 1.7-fold, on average, in 32D cl3 and Ba/F3 cells, and decreased the proportion of cells in S phase by a similar degree. CBF beta-SMMHC induced a marked increase in hypophosphorylated Rb, but did not alter IL-3 Receptor alpha or beta subunit levels. Neither apoptosis nor 32D differentiation was induced by zinc in IL-3 in these lines. Induction of CBF beta-SMMHC in 32D cl3 cells did not inhibit their differentiation to neutrophils or their expression of myeloperoxidase mRNA in G-CSF, and did not produce an eosinophilic phenotype. Additional, proliferative genetic changes in M4eo AMLs might potentiate inhibition of differentiation by CBF beta-SMMHC by allowing its increased expression."
https://openalex.org/W2318797269,"The major differentiation products of maturing keratinocytes contain AP-1 regulatory motifs, and AP-1 DNA binding activity increases in cultured keratinocytes induced to differentiate by calcium. Here, we have analysed AP-1 transcriptional activity in mouse keratinocytes treated with calcium and 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), two agents that induce terminal differentiation of keratinocytes with different phenotypic consequences. Reporter constructs representing multimers of AP-1 sequences found in keratinocyte marker genes demonstrated that the calcium-induced AP-1 DNA binding activity does not correlate with transcriptional activation. Moreover, expression from active subunits of the profilaggrin and spr 1 promoters increased in calcium-treated keratinocytes when the AP-1 sites were disrupted, indicating that AP-1 may negatively regulate certain promoters in these cells. In contrast, AP-1 reporter activity was increased in keratinocytes treated with TPA. This induction was dependent upon the expression of c-Fos since AP-1 transcriptional activity was not increased in TPA-treated keratinocytes derived from c-fos null mice. Analysis of AP-1 protein expression in calcium- and TPA-treated keratinocytes demonstrated that only TPA increased the expression of c-Jun, while Jun B and Jun D were induced by both of these agents. c-Fos was expressed only in TPA treated keratinocytes, Fra-2 was expressed only in calcium-treated cells, and Fra-1 was expressed in both. Exogenous expression of Fra-2 repressed AP-1 transcriptional activity in TPA-treated keratinocytes, while c-Fos expression activated the AP-1 sequence in calcium-treated keratinocytes. These data indicate that Fra-2 and c-Fos play opposing roles in regulating AP-1 activity in keratinocytes and that multiple inducer-dependent regulatory pathways may exist for the expression of keratinocyte differentiation markers."

Male transgenic rabbits fed normal chow had up to 8-fold (289 ± 148 mg/dl) and 15-fold (697 ± 452 mg/dl) increases in plasma total cholesterol and triglycerides, respectively, compared with nontransgenic males. Female transgenic rabbits had only a modest hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol, 140 ± 46 mg/dl; total triglycerides, 174 ± 66 mg/dl). Both sexes displayed the hallmarks of type III HLP: β-migrating very low density lipoproteins (β-VLDL) (intestinal and hepatic remnant lipoproteins) and significantly increased VLDL and intermediate density lipoproteins. Apolipoprotein E2-containing VLDL particles were cleared from the circulation more slowly and were more resistant to lipoprotein lipase-mediated lipolysis than normal VLDL. Only females had increased high density lipoproteins (HDL) (40%), which were shifted from typical small HDL to larger HDL1. Plasma apoE2 was predominantly associated with β-VLDL in males and with HDL in females. To ascertain reasons for the phenotypic gender difference, we treated the male transgenic rabbits with 17α-ethinyl estradiol. Estrogen treatment for 10 days dramatically decreased total cholesterol (73%) and triglycerides (89%) and converted β-VLDL to pre-β-migrating VLDL. Concomitantly, lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase activities increased by 90%, low density lipoprotein receptor activity was stimulated significantly, apoE2 was redistributed to HDL, and HDL were converted to HDL1. Conversely, ovariectomy in female transgenic rabbits significantly increased total cholesterol (75%), triglycerides (117%), and β-VLDL, while decreasing lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase activities by 35% and redistributing apoE2 to the β-VLDL.

In contrast, apoE knockout mice (a model of human apoE deficiency) develop spontaneous atherosclerosis, but their lipoprotein phenotype differs from human type III HLP in that their plasma triglyceride levels are only slightly increased, and the markedly cholesterol-enriched remnant lipoproteins that accumulate are atypical of β-VLDL in human type III HLP (17Zhang S.H.

However, because of the general resistance of mice to the development of atherosclerosis and because of some significant differences in lipoprotein metabolism between mice and humans, additional animal models of type III HLP that resemble the human disease more closely may be required to investigate the pathogenesis of this disorder and the associated susceptibility to atherosclerosis.Rabbits have been used successfully to express several transgenes (19Fan J.

Rabbits have higher levels of apoB-containing lipoproteins than mice (23Chapman M.J. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 70-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), a lipoprotein profile more like that of humans, and a pattern of hepatic apoB100 and intestinal apoB48 synthesis resembling that of humans. Like humans and unlike mice, rabbits have cholesteryl ester transfer protein, which has been reported to be elevated in human type III HLP patients (24McPherson R. Mann C.J. Tall A.R. Hogue M. Martin L. Milne R.W. Marcel Y.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The larger plasma volumes in rabbits permit metabolic studies of lipoprotein subclasses and facilitate lipoprotein turnover studies. Furthermore, rabbits are very susceptible to the development of atherosclerosis, and the lesions can resemble those seen in human atherosclerosis (25Tsukada T. Rosenfeld M. Ross R. Gown A.M. Arteriosclerosis. 1986; 6: 601-613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Adams C.W.M. Miller N.E. Morgan R.S. Rao S.N. Atherosclerosis. 1982; 44: 1-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For these reasons, we generated transgenic rabbits that express human apoE2 in the liver. Here, we report that high expression levels of apoE2 in transgenic rabbits lead to a type III HLP phenotype with a significant gender difference in which estrogen plays a major role. The transgenic rabbits also develop spontaneous atherosclerosis.DISCUSSIONWe have generated transgenic rabbits that express high levels (30–70 mg/dl) of human apoE2 (i.e. apoE2(Cys-158)). These rabbits present a lipid and lipoprotein phenotype resembling that of human type III HLP, including its biochemical hallmark—accumulation of β-VLDL in plasma. The severity of the hyperlipidemia in the transgenic rabbits, especially the hypercholesterolemia, appears to depend on the expression levels of apoE2, as in apoE2 transgenic mice (13Huang Y. Schwendner S.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29146-29151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). High levels of apoE2 overexpression in the rabbits would be expected to create a situation biologically analogous (but not identical) to apoE2/2 homozygosity (i.e. a preponderance of apoE2 that effectively excludes or overwhelms the biological activity of the endogenous apoE). Supporting this presumption is the demonstration that the apoE2-containing β-VLDL are removed from circulation at a slower rate than normal VLDL and are a poor substrate for lipolysis. The lower rate of lipolysis appears to be specific for LPL. Since hepatic lipase is thought to be involved in the final conversion of IDL to LDL in the lipolytic cascade, our results suggest that the impediment occurs earlier in the cascade. Therefore, if the lipolytic defect caused by the presence of apoE2 contributes to the lower LDL levels seen in human type III HLP, LPL may be primarily involved. Previously, we demonstrated in vitro that apoE2 impairs the lipolytic conversion of VLDL to LDL (44Ehnholm C. Mahley R.W. Chappell D.A. Weisgraber K.H. Ludwig E. Witztum J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Metabolism. 1990; 39: 155-160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In rabbits, as in humans, cholesteryl ester transfer protein facilitates the transfer of cholesteryl esters from HDL to VLDL and LDL (48Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar) and may be one of the factors that determine the cholesteryl ester content of β-VLDL.Noteworthy in this study is the significant gender difference in the expression of type III HLP in apoE2 transgenic rabbits, with females having less severe hyperlipidemia. Estrogen treatment markedly reduced the hyperlipidemia in male apoE2 transgenic rabbits and converted the lipoprotein profile toward a normal pattern. Conversely, ovariectomy increased the hyperlipidemia in female apoE2 transgenic rabbits and induced a more overt type III HLP phenotype. Therefore, these gender differences are at least partly due to the estrogen status of these animals and clearly indicate that estrogen modulates the expression of the hyperlipidemia in the type III HLP transgenic rabbits. These results help to explain why women who are homozygous for apoE2 usually develop type III HLP only after menopause, whereas men can develop the overt type III HLP profile at a younger age (1Mahley R.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 1953-1980Google Scholar).There are several possible mechanisms for the estrogen effect in the transgenic rabbits. First, estrogen may stimulate both lipase and LDL receptor activities, most likely by affecting transcription of the relevant genes, although this remains to be proven. The involvement of estrogen in stimulating these activities has been demonstrated (36Ma P.T.S. Yamamoto T. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 792-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 49Kovanen P.T. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11367-11373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,50Demacker P.N.M. Staels B. Stalenhoef A.F.H. Auwerx J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 1652-1659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and our studies show the dramatic effect it has in modulating type III HLP. Second, estrogen's ability to lower plasma lipid levels (and account for the lesser severity of hyperlipidemia in females) may be due principally to its ability to overcome two blockades to catabolism caused by the presence of apoE2. Consistent with the higher lipolytic activity in both nontransgenic and transgenic females are the lower triglyceride content of female transgenic rabbit β-VLDL and the surface protrusions on their β-VLDL particles, presumably indicating an excess surface resulting from rapid lipolysis of β-VLDL. Furthermore, the higher HDL levels in the female transgenic rabbits may be due to a stimulated apoAI production rate by estrogen (51Sacks F.M. Walsh B.W. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and could serve as a sink to “attract and sequester” the apoE2 from the remnant lipoproteins, leading to a decreased distribution of apoE2 in the β-VLDL and a further decrease in the already impaired clearance of remnant lipoproteins. In our studies, estrogen treatment of male apoE2 transgenic rabbits shifted the distribution of apoE2 from β-VLDL to HDL fractions and increased HDL, supporting this possible mechanism. Conversely, ovariectomy of female transgenic rabbits redistributed apoE2 from HDL to β-VLDL. The redistribution of apoE2 and the changes in HDL cholesterol were attenuated in the ovariectomized females compared with the estrogen-treated males (implying that the changes may occur at a slower rate). While this may be due primarily to the pharmacologic doses of estrogen given to the male rabbits, it is possible that the higher amount of apoE2 on female transgenic HDL may be interfering with a processing event leading to plasma HDL changes. Based on our studies so far, it seems that the apoE2 transgenic rabbits provide a good animal model for the study of other secondary factors and mechanisms that modulate the expression of type III HLP.The status of LDL receptors in type III HLP is a matter of some interest. One hypothesis is that these receptors are up-regulated in response to a “perceived” deficiency in cholesterol delivery because of the defective apoE2 ligand on circulating lipoproteins, resulting in low plasma LDL levels, which do occur in type III HLP (1Mahley R.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 1953-1980Google Scholar). Another possibility is that the LDL receptors are down-regulated because they become saturated with the overwhelming levels of circulating lipoproteins (β-VLDL) in type III HLP. Our results on the plasma clearance of antibody 9D9 (Fig. 6) suggest that the latter might be the case. The 9D9 clearance data showed a trend (but did not reach statistical significance) toward expression of fewer LDL receptors (certainly not more) in the type III HLP rabbits than in normal rabbits. Down-regulation of LDL receptors associated with apoE2 overexpression could lead to an increase in LDL levels; however, LDL levels were not increased. Therefore, we suspect that the lipolytic defect associated with apoE2, rather than LDL receptor status, is the primary contributor to low LDL levels in type III HLP. More data of this type may help in reaching a final conclusion.Rabbits have been used widely for experimental atherosclerosis studies, generally by feeding with a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet (25Tsukada T. Rosenfeld M. Ross R. Gown A.M. Arteriosclerosis. 1986; 6: 601-613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Adams C.W.M. Miller N.E. Morgan R.S. Rao S.N. Atherosclerosis. 1982; 44: 1-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition, a model of spontaneous atherosclerosis has also been established in Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits, a model of familial hypercholesterolemia due to LDL receptor deficiency (52Tanzawa K. Shimada Y. Kuroda M. Tsujita Y. Arai M. Watanabe H. FEBS Lett. 1980; 118: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 53Kita T. Brown M.S. Watanabe Y. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2268-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In WHHL rabbits, as in rabbits fed a high cholesterol diet, atherosclerotic lesions mainly involve the aortic arch and thoracic aorta, with less involvement of the abdominal aorta (54Buja L.M. Kita T. Goldstein J.L. Watanabe Y. Brown M.S. Arteriosclerosis. 1983; 3: 87-101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 55Shiomi M. Ito T. Tsukada T. Yata T. Watanabe Y. Tsujita Y. Fukami M. Fukushige J.-I. Hosokawa T. Tamura A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1938-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In apoE2 transgenic rabbits, however, the atherosclerotic lesions mainly involved the aortic arch and abdominal aorta, with much less involvement of the thoracic aorta. Also, there may be differences in the qualitative nature of the lesions, since the lesions in this study were not particularly complex. Whether qualitative and/or distribution differences in lesions between WHHL and apoE2 transgenic rabbits reflect a significant difference related to the type of hyperlipidemia needs to be further evaluated. Nevertheless, the development of spontaneous atherosclerosis in transgenic rabbits expressing high plasma levels of apoE2 makes them a valuable animal model. The rabbits breed normally and require only hemizygosity for human apoE2; thus, they represent an attractive alternative model to WHHL and cholesterol-fed rabbits. Furthermore, these studies have again demonstrated the atherogenic potential of β-VLDL (for review, see Refs. 1Mahley R.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 1953-1980Google Scholar, 56Mahley R.W.

Sci. 1985; 454: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Because these rabbits develop hyperlipidemia, as well as spontaneous atherosclerotic lesions, both detrimental and protective genetic and environmental factors can be investigated. Since lipid metabolism in rabbits resembles that in humans rather closely, and seemingly more closely in some regards than that in transgenic mice, this rabbit model should be very useful in future studies to investigate other factors that modulate the expression of type III HLP and that influence the development of atherosclerosis.

There is an associated accumulation of abnormal plasma lipoproteins, namely β-migrating very low density lipoproteins (β-VLDL), which are cholesterol-enriched remnant lipoproteins derived from both intestine and liver (for a review, see Ref. 1Mahley R.W.

Haimo L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1996; 164: 269-327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Skoufias D. Scholey J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 3Walker R. Sheetz M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 429-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Kinesin is a tetramer composed of two heavy chains and two light chains (4Kuznetsov S.A. Langford G.M. Weiss D.G. Nature. 1992; 356: 722-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Each heavy chain can be divided into three regions (5Yang J. Laymon R. Goldstein L. Cell. 1989; 56: 879-889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The N-terminal head domain is globular and contains the ATPase and MT-binding activities characteristic of kinesin. The central region forms an extended coiled coil with a second heavy chain molecule, forming a stalk. The C terminus again forms globular domains, around which the two light chains coil producing the fully functional molecule. Since both the ATPase activity and MT-binding activity are located within the heavy chain, a kinesin heavy chain dimer has in vitro motor activity (6Hackney D.D. Levitt J.D. Wagner D.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 810-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The association of the two light chains with the heavy chains may confer cargo specificity to kinesin in vivo. Although the function and structure of kinesin are well characterized, little is known about its regulation. Since phosphorylation is important in the regulation of the myosin motor proteins (7Tan J.L. Shoshana R. Spudich J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 721-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), it is also expected to play a role in the regulation of the MT motor proteins. Indeed, a growing body of evidence suggests that this is the case. Kinesin heavy and light chains can be phosphorylated in vitro by purified protein kinase C and protein kinase A (8Matthies H.J.G. Miller R.J. Palfrey H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11176-11187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Sato-Yoshitake R. Yorifuji H. Inagaki M. Hirokawa N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23930-23936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but these kinases are not likely to phosphorylate kinesin in vivo (10Hollenbeck P.J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 2265-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic dynein and kinesin have both been shown to exist as phosphoisoforms in vivo (11Lin S.X.H. Ferro K. Collins C. J. Cell. Biol. 1994; 127: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 12Lee K.-D. Hollenbeck P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5600-5605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), with both kinesin heavy chain (KHC) and kinesin light chain (KLC) shown to be phosphorylated on multiple sites (12Lee K.-D. Hollenbeck P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5600-5605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Increased phosphorylation of cytoplasmic dynein correlates with dissociation from lysosomal vesicles (11Lin S.X.H. Ferro K. Collins C. J. Cell. Biol. 1994; 127: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In contrast, the membrane-bound form of kinesin has a higher state of phosphorylation than soluble kinesin (12Lee K.-D. Hollenbeck P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5600-5605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In vivostudies by Hamm-Alvarez et al. (13Hamm-Alvarez S. Kim P. Sheetz M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 955-966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that treatment of serum-starved CV-1 cells in culture with the phosphatase (PPase) inhibitor okadaic acid (OA) resulted in an increase in the number of vesicle movements within the cells. McIlvain et al. (14McIlvain Jr., J.M. Burkhardt J.K. Hamm-Alvarez S. Argon Y. Sheetz M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19176-19182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that treatment of the MT-depleted cytosol with OA before purification of the motor proteins resulted in a 2-fold increase in kinesin motor activity in an in vitro MT-gliding assay. Further, they were able to show that this treatment resulted in increased phosphorylation of three kinesin-associated proteins, a 150-, 79-, and 73-kDa kinesin-associated phosphoprotein (KAPP). These data provided the first direct correlation between phosphorylation of particular proteins and kinesin motor activity. Here we demonstrate that the 79-kDa KAPP is a kinesin light chain isoform (KLC79) and that phosphorylation of KLC alone is sufficient to reproduce the increased activity described previously. We find that the phosphorylation state of KLC is mediated by a 100-kDa kinase and a 150-kDa type 1 PPase, both of which co-purify with KHC. Together with the other data, the present results suggest that kinesin exists as a complex consisting of at least KHC, KLC, KLC kinase, and KLC PPase. The murine T hybridoma cell line 2B23.18 was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose and 5% fetal calf serum. The human myelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 was cultured in RPMI 1640 and 10% fetal calf serum. Chick embryo brains were collected from 12-day-old chick embryos. All media were supplemented with 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. All cell culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Cytosolic fractions were prepared as described previously for cell lines (14McIlvain Jr., J.M. Burkhardt J.K. Hamm-Alvarez S. Argon Y. Sheetz M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19176-19182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and chick embryo brains (15Toyoshima I. Yu H. Steuer E.R. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), except endogenous MTs were resuspended in 1 m KCl/20 μm taxol, diluted to 0.5 m KCl with PMEE/20 μm taxol and pelleted at 100,000 × g, 15 min, 21 °C before being used for MT affinity. The MT-depleted cytosol was incubated with protein A-agarose beads (Pierce) for 1 h before addition of antibody. After removing the preclearing beads, antibody was added and the samples left on ice for 1 h. Fresh protein A-agarose beads were added, and the samples left on a rotator at 4 °C overnight. The beads were then washed repeatedly in PMEE before being used in an assay. The bead-coupled immune complexes were then treated with either buffer or inhibitors before the addition of [γ-32P]ATP. After the phosphorylation reactions were complete, the beads were washed, and the immune complexes released by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The kinesin-associated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Samples were treated with either of the PPase inhibitors, OA (LC Services, Woburn, MA) or inhibitor-2 (I-2) (generously provided by David Brautigan, University of Virginia, Charlottesville), or the kinase inhibitor staurosporine (LC Services) for at least 15 min before the phosphorylation reactions were initiated by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C with 3,000 Ci/mmol [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Corp.) in the presence or absence of inhibitors. Motor fraction phospholabeling was at a concentration of 200 μCi/ml. Bead-bound KHC immunoprecipitates were adjusted to a volume equal to the preimmunoprecipitation cytosol with PMEE and incubated with 10 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP. MT motors were purified by a MT affinity/ATP elution protocol as described before (14McIlvain Jr., J.M. Burkhardt J.K. Hamm-Alvarez S. Argon Y. Sheetz M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19176-19182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with an additional step. Actin and myosin were removed by the addition of 9 mg/ml glucose and 10 units/ml hexokinase (Boehringer Mannheim) to the MT-depleted cytosol. The samples were incubated at room temperature until a white flocculate precipitate developed and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g, for 30 min at 21 °C to pellet the complex before proceeding with the MT affinity protocol. MT-gliding assays were performed as described previously (14McIlvain Jr., J.M. Burkhardt J.K. Hamm-Alvarez S. Argon Y. Sheetz M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19176-19182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, microtubules were polymerized by diluting 4 volumes of 3–3.5 mg/ml purified porcine brain tubulin with 1 volume of PMEE containing 5 mm GTP and 100 μm taxol and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. A flow chamber was constructed using acid-washed coverslips overlaid on two strips of double stick tape on a standard microscope slide. Tape strips were spaced 2–3 mm apart, forming a chamber of 5–10 μl. The chamber was filled with 1 volume of motor fraction, incubated for 5 min at 24 °C, and washed with 3 volumes of 150 μg/ml casein (60% α, 40% β, from bovine milk (Sigma)) in PMEE. Where indicated, the motor fraction was preincubated with buffer or 125 nm OA before addition to the slide chamber, as described previously (14McIlvain Jr., J.M. Burkhardt J.K. Hamm-Alvarez S. Argon Y. Sheetz M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19176-19182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two volumes of microtubule/nucleotide mixture containing 20 μg/ml of polymerized microtubule stock (sheared by trituration to give an average microtubule length of 3–5 μm), 10 mm ATP, 150 μg/ml casein, 10 mm creatine phosphate (Boehringer Mannheim), and 80 μg/ml creatine kinase (Boehringer Mannheim) in PMEE were then flowed into the chamber and incubated for 5 min before visualization by video-enhanced differential interference microscopy. The gliding assays were done using limiting dilutions of the motor fraction in the presence of excess microtubules and analyzed as described previously (14McIlvain Jr., J.M. Burkhardt J.K. Hamm-Alvarez S. Argon Y. Sheetz M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19176-19182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The kinase was identified by its ability to autophosphorylate under renaturing conditions while embedded within an SDS-PAGE gel matrix. MT affinity-purified motors were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gels washed in 20% isopropanol in 0.05 m Tris, pH 8.0, 4 mm dithiothreitol (buffer A), then in buffer A alone, and finally in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride (Sigma) in buffer A for 0.5 h with two changes of each buffer. After washing, the proteins were allowed to slowly renature in buffer A plus 0.1% Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C with several changes of buffer. The gel was then washed for 30 min in PMEE, 300 μm NaVO4(buffer B) before incubation for 1 h in buffer B plus 25 μm ATP and 4 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP. The phosphorylation reactions were stopped, and the proteins precipitated within the gel by repeated washes with 5% trichloroacetic acid, 1% sodium pyrophosphate. The gels were then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and autoradiographed. MT affinity-purified motor proteins were separated by velocity sedimentation through a 5–20% linear sucrose gradient. Gradients were typically 13 ml and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 16–18 h, 4 °C. PPase activity was determined by the ability of a sample to dephosphorylate [32P]phosphorylase a (Life Technologies, Inc.). The substrate was prepared as the manufacturer recommended. Samples were incubated with the substrate at 30 °C, and the dephosphorylation reaction stopped by the addition of 20% trichloroacetic acid. The 32P freed from [32P]phosphorylase a by PPase activity remained acid soluble while the proteins precipitated out of solution. The amount of freed 32P was quantitated by measuring the counts per minute (cpm) in the trichloroacetic acid-precipitation supernatant. The resulting cpm were normalized to the peak value for each experiment and reported as the PPase activity. To determine the size of the PPase, MT affinity-purified motor proteins were applied to a Superose 6 gel filtration column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The column was developed at 0.5 ml/min with 30 ml PMEE, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, and 0.5 ml fractions collected. An elution volume standard curve was constructed using proteins of known molecular weight, and the molecular weight of the PPase determined by comparison of the elution volume of the peak of PPase activity with this curve. Phospholabeling was analyzed using a Fuji Fujix BAS1000 phosphorimaging system (Fuji, Stamford, CT). A Fuji imaging plate was exposed to a dried radiolabeled gel inside an Amersham film cassette. After exposure, the imaging plate was scanned by the BAS1000 and converted into digital form. Analysis of the image was done using Fuji Fujix MacBas software for the BAS1000. Our previously reported correlation between increased phosphorylation of the KAPPs and increased kinesin motor activity suggested that phosphorylation of these proteins plays an important regulatory role. Therefore, the identification of these proteins would lead to a better understanding of kinesin function. Since the 79-kDa KAPP falls within the range of predicted molecular weights for chick KLC, we began by evaluating the isoforms of KLC found in chick embryo brains. The MT-depleted cytosol was immunoprecipitated with the anti-KHC monoclonal antibody SUK4 (16Ingold A. Cohn S. Scholey J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2657-2667Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and the bead-coupled immune complex incubated with [γ-32P]ATP. As expected, the major components of the SUK4 immune complex were KHC and KLC (Fig.1). Immunoblotting with a series of antibodies was then used to identify the components of the immune complex. The monoclonal anti-KLC antibodies CKLC.3.9C1 (12Lee K.-D. Hollenbeck P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5600-5605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 17Yu H. Toyoshima I. Steuer E.R. Sheetz M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20457-20464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and CKLC.2.7F8 (15Toyoshima I. Yu H. Steuer E.R. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) were previously produced in our laboratory. Using CKLC.3.9C1 only the 70-kDa predominate isoform of KLC, as seen by Coomassie staining of the gel, was detected. However, CKLC.2.7F8 cross-reacted with the predominant 70-kDa KLC and an additional isoform of KLC with an apparent molecular mass of 79 kDa. Autoradiography of the blots showed that this 79-kDa KLC was the only phosphoprotein within the KHC immune complex. This conclusion is supported by studies that used bovine anti-KLC antibodies. 2J. M. McIlvain, Jr., unpublished results. These results identify the 79-kDa KAPP as a phosphoisoform of KLC. Several KAPPs are present in the purified motor fraction from 2B23.18 cells (14McIlvain Jr., J.M. Burkhardt J.K. Hamm-Alvarez S. Argon Y. Sheetz M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19176-19182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the effect of phosphorylation of KLC79 on kinesin activity, motor proteins were prepared from 2B23.18 cells by a MT affinity protocol and incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence or absence of OA. The 79-kDa KLC was the only protein found to be consistently phosphorylated under these conditions (Fig. 2 A). The 150- and 73-kDa KAPPs were not observed. To determine if increased phosphorylation of KLC alone was sufficient to stimulate kinesin motor activity, the purified and phosphorylated motor fraction from 2B23.18 cells was assayed for the ability to support MT gliding in vitro. Compared with untreated samples, twice as many microtubules were observed to be bound or gliding in the samples treated with OA (Fig. 2 B). Since the same relation between enhanced phosphorylation of KLC79 and kinesin motor activity was seen as when the 150- and 79-kDa KAPPs were hyperphosphorylated (14McIlvain Jr., J.M. Burkhardt J.K.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19176-19182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we conclude that phosphorylation of KLC79 alone is sufficient for regulating kinesin motor activity as measured in the MT-gliding assay. The response of KLC79 in the purified motor fraction (Fig. 2 A) suggested that the KLC kinase and PPase remain associated with the motors during MT affinity purification. To further investigate the KLC kinase activity, proteins of purified motor fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and assayed for their ability to renature and autophosphorylate within an acrylamide gel matrix. Under these conditions, one phosphoprotein was seen at 100 kDa. To verify that this 100-kDa phosphoprotein represented an autophosphorylating kinase and not an ATP-binding protein, the renatured gel was pretreated with the kinase inhibitor staurosporine at 100 nm before the addition of [γ-32P]ATP. The observed inhibition of phosphorylation confirms that the protein is a kinase (Fig.3) and makes it a likely candidate for the KLC kinase. Using this technique, a similar 100-kDa putative kinase was found in different species and cell types, including the mouse hybridoma 2B23.18 and the human myelocytic leukemia line HL-60 (data not shown) as well as chick embryo brains (Fig. 3). The enhanced phosphorylation of KLC79 upon OA treatment of the MT affinity-purified motors (Fig. 2 A) indicates that either a type 1 or type 2A Ser/Thr PPase dephosphorylates the protein. PP1 and PP2A activities can be distinguished from each other based on their sensitivity to OA. The PP2A family is inhibited at 1–10 nanomolar concentrations of OA, whereas the PP1 family remains active at concentrations 100-fold higher (18Ishihara H. Martin B. Brautigan D. Karaki H. Ozaki H. Kato Y. Fusetani N. Watabe S. Hashimoto K. Uemura D. Hartshorne D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). To determine if a PP1 or PP2A was responsible for dephosphorylation of KLC79, the MT affinity-purified motors from 2B23.18 and HL-60 cells were used to dephosphorylate [32P]phosphorylase a, a well characterized substrate for PP1 and PP2A PPases. When compared with the buffer controls, little change in the amount of PPase activity was observed upon addition of 5 nm OA to the reaction mixture, whereas the PPase activity was significantly inhibited in the presence of 500 nm OA. This result indicates that a PP1 phosphatase was present in the motor fraction (Fig.4 A). To further characterize the PPase, the MT affinity-purified motors were fractionated by a Superose 6 gel filtration column (Fig.4 B), and the resulting fractions were assayed for the ability to dephosphorylate [32P]phosphorylasea. Two peaks of PPase activity were identified, corresponding to molecular masses of approximately 150- and 80-kDa. The first peak is the PPase holoenzyme, while the second peak co-eluted with a commercial PP1 catalytic subunit, representing a dimer of the PPase catalytic subunit freed during enzyme purification (19Brautigan D.L. Shriner C.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 275: 44-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Similar peaks of activity were also identified from gel filtration analysis of motor proteins purified from HL-60 cells (data not shown). To confirm that the single PPase identified in the bulk motor fraction was a PP1 enzyme, biochemical classification studies were done on the PPase holoenzyme and catalytic subunit isolated from the 2B23.18 cells. MT affinity-purified motors were separated by velocity sedimentation through a 5–20% linear sucrose gradient, and each fraction was assayed for its ability to dephosphorylate [32P]phosphorylase a (Fig.5 A). The fractions corresponding to the holoenzyme (which co-sedimented with kinesin) and the catalytic subunit were incubated with OA (Fig. 5 B) or I-2 (Fig. 5 C) before being analyzed for PPase activity. I-2 is a PP1-specific inhibitor. It does not inhibit PP2A even at micromolar concentrations. The PPase holoenzyme was not affected by 5 nm OA, showed little activity after incubation with 125 nm OA, and was inhibited by I-2 at nanomolar concentrations. The PPase catalytic subunit was slightly more sensitive to the inhibitors, but exhibited the same overall characteristics as the holoenzyme. In contrast, a commercial PP2A catalytic subunit was completely inhibited at 5 nm OA but was not effected by 200 nm I-2 (data not shown), which confirms that the 150-kDa motor-associated PPase is a member of the PP1 family. The antibody SUK4 binds kinesin heavy chain near the motor domain (16Ingold A. Cohn S. Scholey J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2657-2667Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and immunoprecipitates a complex of proteins including KHC, KLC, and other accessory factors needed for kinesin motility in vitro (20Burkhardt J.K. McIlvain J.J. Sheetz M.P. Argon Y. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 151-162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if the KLC kinase and PPase are among these accessory proteins, the SUK4 immune complex from 2B23.18 cells was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence or absence of phosphotransferase inhibitors. Without treatment with inhibitors, the two major proteins that were consistently phosphorylated within the kinesin heavy chain immune complex of these cells were the 150-kDa KAPP and KLC79 (Fig.6) (as previously reported (14McIlvain Jr., J.M. Burkhardt J.K. Hamm-Alvarez S. Argon Y. Sheetz M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19176-19182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), which confirms that the KLC kinase is kinesin associated. To evaluate the effect of kinase inhibition on the phosphorylation of KLC79, the SUK4 immune complex was pretreated with 100 nmstaurosporine before incubation with [γ-32P]ATP. Under these conditions phosphorylation of KLC79 was eliminated (Fig.6 A). These data are in agreement with the autophosphorylation inhibition of the kinase shown in Fig. 3 and further suggest that the 100-kDa kinase present in the MT affinity-purified motor fraction phosphorylates KLC within the kinesin complex. In addition, pretreatment of the kinesin heavy chain immune complex with 500 nm OA before incubation with [γ-32P]ATP increased phosphate incorporation into KLC (Fig. 6 B) and demonstrated that the KLC PPase is active within the kinesin complex. Identification of the kinesin-associated phosphoproteins and the phosphotransferases that regulate them may elucidate the control of vesicle motility mediated by the motor proteins. Our original work describing the KAPPs (14McIlvain Jr., J.M. Burkhardt J.K. Hamm-Alvarez S. Argon Y. Sheetz M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19176-19182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and later work on KLC (12Lee K.-D. Hollenbeck P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5600-5605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) suggested that the 79-kDa KAPP was not KLC. This conclusion was based primarily on results in both laboratories from Western blots using the CKLC.3.9C1 antibody. However, our current work characterizes CKLC.3.9C1 as cross-reactive with only the predominant isoform of KLC and explains why Lee and Hollenbeck (12Lee K.-D. Hollenbeck P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5600-5605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) did not observe cross-reactivity of the 70–80-kDa KAPPs with CKLC.3.9C1 in their studies. An alternative anti-KLC monoclonal antibody (CKLC.2.7F8) made this clarification possible because it cross-reacted with multiple isoforms, including the 79-kDa KAPP of KLC in multiple species, making it a particularly useful tool in our studies on phosphoisoforms of KLC. KLCs are suspected to be involved in cargo selection. They are associated with the KHC fan-shaped tail and therefore are located at the proposed vesicle docking site (5Yang J. Laymon R. Goldstein L. Cell. 1989; 56: 879-889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). This strongly suggests that the multiple isoforms of KLC provide cargo specificity. An OA-induced increased phosphorylation state of the KLC, represented by KLC79, may resemble the membrane-bound form of KLC and thus activate kinesin motor activity. This idea is consistent with data showing that the more highly phosphorylated forms of kinesin are vesicle-bound, whereas less phosphorylated forms are soluble (12Lee K.-D. Hollenbeck P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5600-5605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The experiments that led to the identification of the KAPPs and the correlation between KAPP phosphorylation and kinesin activity (14McIlvain Jr., J.M. Burkhardt J.K. Hamm-Alvarez S. Argon Y. Sheetz M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19176-19182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) relied on cytosolic phosphorylation of the activating proteins. Here we demonstrate that further purification did not result in a loss of hyperphosphorylation activity. In fact, we were still able to obtain the same level of activation as observed in the previous report under conditions where only KLC was consistently phosphorylated. The level of phosphorylation of KLC is controlled by two phosphotransferases that can be found in association with the kinesin molecule. The kinase is at present uncharacterized, but its size and sensitivity to specific kinase inhibitors indicates that it may be a novel enzyme. The phosphatase has been characterized to be a type 1 Ser/Thr PPase. Other type 1 PPases have been implicated in the regulation of both cytoplasmic dynein (21Allan V. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 879-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and the nonmuscle myosin motors (7Tan J.L. Shoshana R. Spudich J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 721-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Although the apparent molecular weight of the motor-associated PP1 is similar to the 150-kDa KAPP, they are different proteins, since the PP1 size was estimated for the native holoenzyme, whereas the KAPP size was derived from SDS-PAGE analysis. Work is underway to define which of the three subsets of PP1 is the relevant KLC phosphatase. The present data show that phosphorylation of the 150-kDa KAPP is not essential for the enhancement of kinesin activity in the MT-gliding assay. However, it is associated with kinesin through various purification steps in several cell lines that we have examined and thus is likely to play a regulatory role that is not measured in thein vitro MT-gliding assay. For example, the 150-kDa KAPP may be important in maintaining the kinesin motor complex together in membrane association of the kinesin complex or in another step ofin vivo vesicle motility, since highly purified kinesin is unable to transport vesicles in vitro (22Schroer T. Sheetz M. J. Cell. Biol. 1991; 115: 1309-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). We are currently investigating the parameters that define the association of the 150-kDa KAPP with kinesin as well as regulation of its phosphorylation state in different kinesin preparations. The 100-kDa kinase was the only kinase activity detected in the MT affinity-purified motor preparation, and the KLC was the only phosphoprotein detected when the MT affinity-purified motors were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP. This suggests that the 100-kDa kinase is a KLC kinase. This hypothesis is supported by similar results obtained when a different method, immunoprecipitation, was used in the purification. These data suggest that autophosphorylation activates the 100-kDa kinase, which then results in phosphorylation of the KLC and subsequent activation of kinesin motor activity. To unequivocally identify the 100-kDa kinase and 150-kDa PPase as KLC-specific, all of the components will have to be purified to homogeneity. Nonetheless, the work presented here and in a previous paper (14McIlvain Jr., J.M. Burkhardt J.K. Hamm-Alvarez S. Argon Y. Sheetz M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19176-19182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that the active kinesin motor is an assembly of a number of proteins, including kinesin heavy and light chains, a kinase, and a phosphatase. We consider it likely that phosphorylation of kinesin accessory factors is one step in a cascade of signal transduction that regulates kinesin activity and anterograde organelle movement. Our data support this by demonstrating that the phosphorylation level of KLC is modulated by a kinesin-associated kinase and PPase, and the level of KLC phosphorylation directly correlates with activation of kinesin motor activity. Future studies will address how the activities of the KLC kinase and PPase are controlled in turn. We thank the members of the Sheetz and Argon laboratories for continued support and advice, and Dr. David Brautigan for inhibitor-2."

Here, we report characterization of the full length OS4 cDNA derived from 12q13-q15 (Su et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 91: 9121 – 9125, 1994), a region frequently amplified in sarcomas and brain tumors. This cDNA consists of 4833 base pairs (bp) encoding an open reading frame (ORF) of 283 amino acids. The ORF predicts a water-soluble acidic (pI 5.50) polypeptide with a molecular weight of 31 759. Database searches revealed highly significant similarity between OS4 and eight proteins predicted from genomic sequences of Caenorhabditis elegans, Schizosaccaharomyces pombe, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Thus, OS4 defines a novel evolutionarily conserved gene superfamily. Northern and database analyses revealed OS4 transcripts in numerous human tissues demonstrating its ubiquitous expression. We also observed overexpression of OS4 in three cancer cell lines with amplification of this gene. Furthermore, we detected OS4 amplification in 5/5 primary sarcomas with known amplification of the closely linked marker CDK4. These results demonstrate that the highly conserved OS4 gene is frequently included in the 12q13-q15 amplicon and may contribute to the development of a subset of sarcomas."

https://openalex.org/W2324763502,"Formation of active cdk (cyclin dependent kinase)/ cyclin kinases involves phosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue in the T loop of the cdk catalytic-subunit by CAK (Cdk Activating Kinase). CAK was first purified biochemically from higher eukaryotes and identified as a trimeric complex containing a cdk7 catalytic subunit, cyclin H and MAT1 (Ménage à trois), a member of the RING finger family. The same trimeric complex is also part of basal transcription factor TFIIH. In budding yeast, the closest homologs of cdk7 and cyclin H, KIN28 and CCL1, respectively, also associate with TFIIH. However, the KIN28/CCL1 complex does not display CAK activity and a distinct protein kinase able to phosphorylate monomeric CDC28 and GST-cdk2 was recently identified, challenging the identification of cdk7 as the physiological CAK in higher eukaryotes. Here we demonstrate that immunodepletion of cdk7 suppresses CAK activity from cycling Xenopus egg extracts, and arrest them before M-phase. We also show that specific translation of mRNAs encoding Xenopus cdk7 and its associated subunits restores CAK activity in cdk7-immunodepleted Xenopus egg extracts. Hence, the cdk7 complex is necessary and sufficient for activation of cdk-cyclin complexes in cycling Xenopus egg extracts."

Of particular interest with respect to the function of these proteins is that they are extensively modified posttranslationally. All four are phosphorylated (15Wilcox K.W. Kohn A. Sklyanskaya E. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1980; 33: 167-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ICP4 has been shown to be poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated both in vitro and in infected cells (16Preston C.M. Notarianni E.L. Virology. 1983; 131: 492-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 17Blaho J.A. Michael M. Kang V. Aboul-Ela N. Smulson M. Jacobson M.K. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6398-6407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, this laboratory reported that these proteins are also guanylylated and adenylylated (18Blaho J. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3759-3769Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Blaho J.A. Mitchell C. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3891-3900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This conclusion was based on the observations that these proteins were labeled in isolated nuclei with [α-32P]GTP and [α-32P]ATP, as well as with [2-3H]ATP where the tritium atom is in the purine ring. The four α regulatory proteins contain a common amino acid sequence RR(A/T)(P/S)R designated the alpha protein basic (APB) site. The hypothesis that the APB sequence signals a posttranslational modification was supported by the observation that it accurately predicted the identity of four additional viral proteins labeled by [α-32P]GTP and [α-32P]ATP (20Blaho J.A. Mitchell C. Roizman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17401-17410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We should stress that the genes encoding these proteins were mapped by first defining the domains of genome encoding nucleotidylylated proteins from analyses of proteins specified by HSV-1 X HSV-2 intertypic recombinants containing specific regions of the HSV-2 genome in a HSV-1 background. In the second step, the genes whose proteins are nucleotidylylated were identified. These earlier studies suggested the possibility that ICP22 was nucleotidylylated by a cellular enzyme (19Blaho J.A. Mitchell C. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3891-3900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this conclusion, it was shown that an ICP22-GST fusion protein (GST22P) was nucleotidylylated by an enzyme present in a nuclear extract from uninfected HeLa cells (21Mitchell C. Blaho J.A. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11864-11868Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Also, the addition of GST22P to the reaction containing [α-32P]ATP and HeLa cell nuclear extracts inhibited the labeling of at least two host cell proteins (H2 and H3) by [α-32P]ATP. The substrate specificity and subcellular localization of the nucleotidylylating activity led us to test the hypothesis that this enzyme might be casein kinase II (CKII). Subsequent studies showed that GST22P could be nucleotidylylated by CKII purified from the Sea Star (21Mitchell C. Blaho J.A. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11864-11868Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) with [α-32P]ATP, [α-32P]GTP, or [2-3H]ATP but not with [α-32P]CTP. Casein kinase II is a ubiquitous serine/threonine eukaryotic kinase existing as a heterotetramer of either α2β2, α′2β2, or αα′β2 where the subunits have an apparentM r of 24–28 kDa (β), 40–44 kDa (α), and 37–41 kDa (α′) (22Edelman A.M. Blumanthal D.K. Krebs E.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 567-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). The α and α′ subunits are encoded by separate but related genes showing 85% homology to each other (23Lozeman F.J. Litchfield D.W. Piening C. Takio K. Walsh K.A. Krebs E.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8436-8447Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and are capable of phosphotransferase activity as monomers (24Hu E. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20609-20615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The significance of the divergence in the α and α′ subunits has yet to be determined. It has been suggested that the β subunit has a regulatory function (25Traugh J.A. Lin W.-J. Takada-Axelrod F. Tuazon P.T. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1990; 24: 224-229PubMed Google Scholar) and that the addition of the β subunit to form the heterotetramer stimulates the phosphorylation activity by at least 10-fold (24Hu E. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20609-20615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinase activity is inhibited by heparin and stimulated by the addition of basic peptides such as polylysine. The β subunit is normally phosphorylated, but the α subunit may be phosphorylated in the presence of basic substrates (25Traugh J.A. Lin W.-J. Takada-Axelrod F. Tuazon P.T. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1990; 24: 224-229PubMed Google Scholar); the function of these modifications is unknown. CKII is predominantly a nuclear enzyme (26Kreck W. Maridor G. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar); it can be co-precipitated with a transcription complex containing ATF1 since it specifically binds to an ATF1-GST fusion protein (27Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Kawase H. Hiramoto M. Ferduos A. Takayama M. Lee K.A.W. Hurst H.C. Handa H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 876-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). CKII has been reported to be present in purified virions of HSV-1(F) (28Stevely W.S. Katan M. Stirling V. Smith G. Leader D.P. J. Gen. Virol. 1985; 66: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The function and posttranslational modifications of ICP22 have been of interest to this laboratory for several reasons. In earlier studies with a virus (R325) containing a carboxyl-terminal truncation of ICP22, this laboratory showed that ICP22 is required for optimal viral replication in primary human cell strains and in cell lines of rodent origin; in these cells, the virus yields and the production of late (γ) proteins are reduced (13Sears A.E. Halliburton I.W. Meignier B. Silver S. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1985; 55: 338-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Purves F.C. Ogle W.O. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6701-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). It is relevant to note that ICP22 is phosphorylated by both the UL13 and US3 protein kinases (29Purves F.C. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7310-7314Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and that the phenotype of viruses lacking the UL13 kinase was similar to that of mutants lacking the α22 gene, i.e. phosphorylation of ICP22 by UL13 is required for optimal expression of α0 mRNA, ICP0, and a subset of γ proteins (14Purves F.C. Ogle W.O. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6701-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). However, deletion of both UL13 and US3 genes from the viral genome did not affect nucleotidylylation of viral proteins (20Blaho J.A. Mitchell C. Roizman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17401-17410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We now report the following. (i) An activity present in a partially purified uninfected HeLa cell extract that contains CKII (fraction III) was able to specifically label a GST fusion protein containing 151 amino acids from the amino portion of the ICP22 protein with either [α-32P]ATP or [2-3H]ATP. (ii) Heparin specifically inhibited nucleotidylylation of ICP22 by this extract. (iii) The CKII present in fraction III was purified to near homogeneity. (iv) Purified CKII labeled GST-ICP22 fusion proteins in a positive cooperative manner and had a K m = 37.7 μm for ATP. (v) A GST fusion protein with a mutated APB site was not labeled in our assay. (vi) Casein was not nucleotidylylated in our assay. We conclude that HeLa CKII, in addition to phosphorylation with [γ-32P]ATP, is capable of catalyzing a nucleotidylylation reaction inasmuch as glutathioneS-transferase-ICP22 fusion proteins were labeled with [α-32P]ATP and [2-3H]ATP using purified CKII. The HeLa S3 cell line obtained from the American Type Culture Collection was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum. HSV-1 strain F is the prototype HSV-1 strain used in this laboratory (30Ejercito P.M. Kieff E.D. Roizman B. J. Gen. Virol. 1968; 2: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Subconfluent HeLa S3 cultures containing approximately 4 × 106 cells were exposed to 5 plaque-forming units per cell for 1 h and then incubated at 37 °C in medium containing 2% newborn calf serum. All protease inhibitors, tyrosine-agarose, heparin-agarose, nucleotides, and biochemicals, including heparin, were from Sigma. Q-Sepharose fast flow was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). The silver stain kit was purchased from Diachii (Tokyo, Japan) and was used according to the manufacturer's directions. All plasmids derived in this study were made by standard procedures described elsewhere (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). Restriction endonucleases were from New England Biolabs and T4 DNA ligase was from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Construction of the GST-ICP22 fusion GST22P (pRB4654) was described elsewhere (21Mitchell C. Blaho J.A. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11864-11868Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For construction of pRB4829 expressing a GST-ICP22 fusion protein with a mutated APB site (GST22M), site-directed mutagenesis was done using the M13 “Muta-gene” protocol as recommended by the vendor (Bio-Rad). The sequence of the oligonucleotide used for mutagenesis was 5′-GGTGGCCTTAAGGCCCCCCAGAAGCTTGGG; it generated a uniqueAflII and a HindIII site in the α22 gene for ease of cloning. The mutation was verified both by DNA sequencing and restriction endonuclease cleavage at these unique sites. The sites of the mutations in ICP22 were R76L, R77K, R80E, and R81K. Plasmid pGEX2T was obtained from Pharmacia. The plasmid pRB5071, expressing a GST-ICP22 fusion protein with an additional 6 histidine residues on the carboxyl terminus was created by insertion of the double stranded oligo, 5′-CCATCACCATCACCATCACTAAGCTTG-3′ with appropriate overhang on the noncoding strand, into pRB4654. Suspension cultures of HeLa S3 cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% newborn calf serum to a density of approximately 3–5 ml of packed cells per liter. All extraction procedures were at 4 °C. The pelleted cells were rinsed three times in 8–10 packed cell volumes of phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4), and the cells were lysed by resuspension in 1.5 volumes of 20 mmHEPES (pH 7.8), 520 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μml-1-chloro-3-(4-tosylamido)-4-phenyl-2-butanone (TPCK), 10 μml-1-chlor-3-(4-tosylamido)-7-amino-2-heptanon-hydrochloride (TLCK), 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in 25% glycerol followed by rotating the samples for 60 min at 4 °C. After pelleting the cellular debris, samples were stored at −80 °C. Prior to fractionation, dry ammonium sulfate was added directly to the supernatant (fraction I) and mixed thoroughly by inversion. Initially, a 20% saturation was taken and discarded, and a 60% saturation was pelleted, dissolved in lysis buffer, and then dialyzed into column buffer (20 mm ethanolamine (pH 9.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm TPCK, 10 μm TLCK, and 25% glycerol). The dialyzed fraction (fraction II) was clarified by centrifugation, filtered through a 0.2 micron cellulose acetate filter (Corning) and then the extract was chromatographed at 4 °C on a Q-Sepharose column using standard techniques (32Deutscher M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Briefly, after application of fraction II, the column was rinsed with 1.5-column volumes of column buffer. The bound protein was then eluted with a 10.5-column volume linear gradient beginning at 50 mm NaCl and ending at 540 mm NaCl. The fractions were then assayed for the ability to label GST22P as described below, and the fractions active for nucleotidylylation were pooled (fraction III). Preparation of fraction III was as outlined above except the concentration of buffer in the extraction buffer was increased to 50 mm HEPES. Following ammonium sulfate fractionation, the precipitate was resuspended in Q-Sepharose column buffer to 0.5 × the starting volume. The suspension was passed through a Sephadex G-50 column equilibrated with column buffer, and the volume of the eluate was reduced by concentration against polyethylene glycol flakes (Calbiochem). The concentrated protein (fraction II) was filtered through a 0.45 micron polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the proteins were fractionated on a Q-Sepharose column as described above. The fractions active for nucleotidylylation were pooled (fraction III). To concentrate the pooled sample, fraction III was diluted 2-fold with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 25% glycerol, reapplied to a 5-ml Q-Sepharose column, eluted with a 100-ml gradient as described above, and the active fractions were pooled. Subsequent purification steps were a modification of the procedure used by J.S. Sanghera, et al. (33Sanghera J.S. Charlton L.A. Paddon H.B. Pelach S.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The Q-Sepharose pool was diluted with an equal volume of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm EDTA (Buffer B) containing 1.6 m (35% saturation) (NH4)2SO4. The extract was stirred over ice for 10 min and then centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and loaded onto a tyrosine-agarose column pre-equilibrated in Buffer B containing 0.8 m(NH4)2SO4. The column was developed with a 200-ml decreasing linear gradient starting with 0.8m (NH4)2SO4 in Buffer B, ending with Buffer B, and 4-ml fractions were collected. The fractions containing activity that labeled GST22P with [α-32P]ATP were pooled, diluted 1:3 with Buffer B, and loaded onto a heparin-agarose column pre-equilibrated with Buffer B. The column was rinsed with 10-column volumes of Buffer B containing 50 mm NaCl and then the proteins were eluted with a 100-ml linear gradient from 50 to 800 mm NaCl. The fractions containing nucleotidylylating activity were pooled and assayed for purity using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining (Diachii, Tokyo, Japan). The procedures for the growth, induction, and purification of herpesviral fusion proteins in E. coli were a modification of procedures described previously (34Studier F.W. Moffat B.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4770) Google Scholar). In general, E. coli do not express herpesvirus proteins stably either because of the high guanine/cytosine content of viral DNA or the high content of proline in viral proteins. The following protocol reproducibly generated intact fusion protein to yields as high as 8 mg/liter of bacterial culture. Briefly, E. coli BL21 cells containing plasmids that expressed appropriate fusion proteins were stored in 15% glycerol at −70 °C as a freezer stock. One loop full of the freezer stock served as the inoculum for 50 ml of L-broth containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) that was incubated at 37 °C overnight. This 50-ml culture was used to inoculate 500 ml of L-broth containing ampicillin that was placed in a shaking incubator at 30 °C and incubated until anA 600 of 0.8 to 1.2 was reached. At that point, 60 μl of a freshly prepared 20% isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside solution was added, and the cells where incubated for an additional 2 h. Pelleted cells were resuspended in 5 ml of ice cold 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl (TBS), briefly sonicated on ice, and 500 μl of Triton X-100 (1/10 volume) was added prior to pelleting the cellular debris at 10,000 rpm for 5 min in a Sorvall SS34 rotor at 4 °C. For GST22P and GST22M, the supernatant fluid was mixed with 1.0 ml of a 50% slurry of glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) in TBS and rotated for 30–60 min. The agarose beads were pelleted and rinsed four times in 50 ml of TBS. Last, the fusion protein was eluted from the glutathione beads by two sequential incubations with 1.0 ml of 5 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for 30 min at room temperature, and the two elutants were stored separately at −70 °C. For GST22PH, the cell extract was prepared as specified above and allowed to bind overnight at 4 °C with 0.5 ml of a 50% slurry of Ni-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen) in TBS. The agarose beads were pelleted and rinsed 4 times with 50 ml of TBS; the fusion protein was eluted by three sequential 1-ml volumes of TBS containing 500 mmimidazole. The pooled eluant was then incubated for 30–60 min at 4 °C with 0.5 ml of a 50% slurry of glutathione-agarose beads in TBS. The beads were rinsed, and the fusion protein was eluted and stored as described for GST22P. Protein yield was typically 0.3–0.5 mg/ml. Fractionated proteins (50 μg) were added to 50-μl mixtures containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 30 nm[α-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol; Amersham) and 150 μm ATP (Sigma) and incubated at either 15 or 30 °C, as indicated. Reactions were terminated by the addition of EDTA to 25 mm, which has been shown to completely inhibit the reaction (18Blaho J. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3759-3769Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For reactions containing fusion proteins, the labeling conditions were the same except that 10 μg of chimeric protein were added to the mixtures. The reaction mixture was then solubilized in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and subjected to electrophoresis in denaturing gels and autoradiography as described previously or analyzed in a filter binding assay as described below. The assay was done at 30 °C as described above except that [2-3H]ATP (23 Ci/mmol; Amersham) was diluted 1:100 into 1 mm ATP, ATPαS, or ATPγS and then diluted to give a final concentration of 100 μm ATP (or as indicated) in the assay. The reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA to 250 mm. The extent of protein labeling was quantitated in a nitrocellulose filter binding assay as described previously (21Mitchell C. Blaho J.A. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11864-11868Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, the labeling mixtures were filtered though nitrocellulose (BA83) membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) that had been pre-wet in phosphate-buffered saline and inserted in a “dot-blot” manifold as recommended by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). After the sample had been added to the wells, the nitrocellulose sheet was rinsed by filtration with three sequential 0.5-ml amounts of phosphate-buffered saline filtered through each spot. The membrane was removed from the apparatus and dried, and the radioactivity retained in each spot was measured by cutting the sections apart and dissolving the portions of the membrane in tetrahydrofuran (Sigma), followed by addition of BCS-NA scintillant (Amersham), and counting in a Beckman liquid scintillation counter. Electrophoretic separations of denatured proteins were performed on 12% polyacrylamide gels cross-linked withN,N′-diallyltartardiamide containing 0.1% SDS at 1 mA/cm for 15 h. The separated polypeptides were either stained as indicated or electrically transferred to nitrocellulose sheets in a gel buffer containing 0.025% SDS at 120 V for 5 h at 4 °C. Densitometric analysis of the stained gels was performed using an Eagle Eye II (Stratagene). Labeled proteins were subjected to autoradiography at −70 °C on Kodak X-OMAT film. Polypeptides were visualized on nitrocellulose after staining with specific antibodies in an immunoalkaline phosphatase-coupled reaction (Bio-Rad) or by immunoluminescence and measured with a chemiluminescence (ECL) kit as recommended by the vendor (Amersham). The antibody against GST (SC-138), which was used to visualize all of the fusion proteins, and the antibody against Erk-1 (SC-94) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The antibodies to the α subunit of CKII were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY) or a generous gift of E. G. Krebs (6461D) as indicated. Earlier studies from this laboratory have shown that GST22P can be labeled in vitro with uninfected HeLa cell nuclear extract using [α-32P]ATP or [α-32P]GTP, suggesting that a HeLa nuclear enzyme was required for this modification (21Mitchell C. Blaho J.A. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11864-11868Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several lines of evidence suggesting that this enzyme had characteristics in common with CKII led to the demonstration that purified Sea Star CKII (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) could label GST22P with either [α-32P]ATP or [2-3H]ATP in a filter binding assay. Because of the high background in the labeling reaction with HeLa cell nuclear extracts, we partially purified the HeLa cell CKII as described under “Materials and Methods” (fraction III). To verify the presence of CKII in fraction III, HeLa cell protein was fractionated on Q-Sepharose, labeled with [α-32P]ATP, separated on a denaturing 12% gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with antibodies to either CKII or Erk-1 using the ECL technique as described under “Materials and Methods.” The immunoblot was probed for Erk-1 since it is also a nuclear kinase and has an electrophoretic mobility similar to that of the HeLa cell proteins H2 and H3 reported previously (19Blaho J.A. Mitchell C. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3891-3900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,21Mitchell C. Blaho J.A. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11864-11868Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The results (Fig. 1) were as follows. (i) Panel A shows the nucleotidylylation profile of HeLa cell proteins fractionated on a Q-Sepharose column. Bands H2 and H3 predominate in the flow-through, wash, and in the early (low salt) elutions. The majority of the other major labeled bands partition in fractions 33–43. Using a dot-blot apparatus in an in vitronucleotidylylation assay with GST22P as the substrate, we observed that the activity, which specifically labeled GST22P with [α-32P]ATP, peaked between fractions 37 and 41 (data not shown), and the pool of these fractions was termed fraction III. (ii) Erk-1 (panel C) did not partition with either H2/H3 or the peak of major labeled bands, whereas CKII (panel B) eluted in fractions 33–45 and peaked in fraction 39. From these results we conclude that CKII, but not Erk-1, is present in the protein fraction (III), which is capable of nucleotidylylating ICP22. To characterize the nucleotidylylation of ICP22, we generated a series of GST fusion proteins (Fig. 2) that contain amino acids 49 to 200 of ICP22. This domain of ICP22 was specifically chosen because earlier studies showed that it is of a sufficient length to be nucleotidylylated by an uninfected cell extract as well as by purified sea star CKII (21Mitchell C. Blaho J.A. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11864-11868Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, the amino-terminal fragment of ICP22, expressed in recombinant virus R325, is nucleotidylylated (19Blaho J.A. Mitchell C. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3891-3900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, earlier studies showed that the ABP site could be used to predict the HSV-1 proteins that would be nucleotidylylated (20Blaho J.A. Mitchell C. Roizman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17401-17410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that this site is either the labeling site or is involved in substrate recognition. To provide a negative control for our in vitro assay, we created GST22M, which has a mutated APB site with the sequence “LKAPEK” instead of “RRAPRR” at ICP22 amino acids 76–81. In addition, we created a histidine-tagged version of GST22P consisting of the glutathione S-transferase at the amino te"
https://openalex.org/W2329979475,"To further our understanding of the molecular mechanism of Bcr-Abl mediated transformation, a yeast two hybrid screen was used to identify proteins binding to the Abl tyrosine kinase. Two partial cDNAs encoding novel SH2 domain-containing proteins were cloned and designated Shd and She. Both have homology to Shb, a previously reported SH2 domain-containing protein. Northern blot analysis showed that She is expressed in heart, lung, brain, and skeletal muscle, while expression of Shd is restricted to the brain. The deduced amino acid sequence of the full length mouse Shd cDNA contains an amino-terminal proline-rich region, and a carboxyterminal SH2 domain. A bacterially expressed Shd domain bound multiple tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with relative molecular weights of 200, 170, 130, 100, 90, 78, 72 and 32 kDa from K562 cell lysates. Shd contains five YXXP motifs, a substrate sequence preferred by Abl tyrosine kinases. Shd was tyrosine phosphorylated in COS-7 cells co-transfected with Shd and c-Abl or Bcr-Abl. These results suggest that Shd may be a physiological substrate of c-Abl and may function as an adapter protein in the central nervous system."

Other glycoamidases catalyzing the same reaction have been reported in plants (e.g. almond PNGase A) (6Takahashi N. Nishibe H. J. Biochem.

Biochem. 1981; 163: 167-173Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and, more recently, in mammalian cells (8Suzuki T. Seko A. Kitajima K. Inoue Y. Inoue S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17611-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where the enzyme is thought to have a regulatory role in glycoprotein maturation (9Suzuki T. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 779-789Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, only the bacterial glycoamidase PNGase F has been characterized at the molecular level, and an understanding of the primary structure of even the simplest eukaryotic glycoamidase is still lacking. During the course of a glycoamidase survey, we discovered high levels of a new PNGase type enzyme in crude commercial pectinase extracts derived from Aspergillus tubigensis. Preliminary studies demonstrated that this glycoamidase, designated PNGase At, appeared significantly different from PNGase F in terms of its molecular weight, state of glycosylation, low pH optimum, and thermostability as to warrant further investigation into its protein structure and mechanism of action. In this report we describe the purification of PNGase At to homogeneity. The enzyme has been cloned and sequenced, and the deduced amino acid sequence verified independently to greater than 80% by ESI-MS. On the basis of the structural organization of the gene, PNGase At is initially synthesized as a single polypeptide of about 59,000 daltons. It acquires asparagine-linked glycans during post-translational processing and is cleaved into non-identical subunits. Subunit formation represents a fundamental departure from the structure of the corresponding bacterial enzyme and may reflect a different mechanism for catalysis of the β-aspartylglucosylamine bond. This study represents the first description of a glycoamidase at the eukaryotic level. A. tubigensis strain 7 DNA, RNA, and Multifect PL enzyme were obtained from Genencor. Pfu polymerase, Bluescript KS+, SK+, and PCR script SK+ cloning vectors were obtained from Stratagene. Reverse transcriptase, RNase inhibitor, and RNase-free DNase were from Promega. T4 DNA ligase, polynucleotide kinase, and all the restriction enzymes used in this project were from New England Biolabs. PCR amplification reactions were performed using 100 ng ofA. tubigensis total DNA, 100 pmol of each primer, 200 mm dNTP, 2.5 units Pfu DNA polymerase, and 1 × Pfu buffer (Stratagene) in a total volume of 100 μl. The reactions were carried out in a DNA thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer) programmed for 30 three-step cycles of denaturation (1 min at 94 °C), annealing (1 min at either 45 °C for degenerate primers or 55 °C for specific primers), and elongation (1 min at 70 °C). A further elongation at 72 °C was performed for 10 min at the end of the program. Based on the peptide sequence analysis, two oppositely oriented degenerated oligonucleotides were designed, AnS1(5′-ACAGAATTCGARGTNTTYGARGTNTAYCARCC-3′, amino acid residues 3–10) andAnA4 (5′-ACAAAGCTTCGRAANACYTCNGTRTCNCC-3′, amino acid residues 75–81) where N is either G, A, T, or C, R is G or A, and Y is C or T. Using these primers, a PCR product of 294 bp was obtained. This fragment was digested with EcoRI and HindIII restriction enzymes and cloned into pBlueScript (Stratagene) pre-digested with the same enzymes. The sequence reactions were performed using a Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). To extend the sequence further, upstream and downstream regions of this fragment were amplified using RAGE (10Bloomquist B.T. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (11Schaefer B.C. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 255-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) protocols. Briefly, in vitropolyadenylated cDNAs (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) or restriction fragments of genomic DNA (RAGE) were used in PCR reactions with a specific primer and an oligo(dT) to amplify unknown sequences. Using this information, the whole gene was then amplified in two large fragments. For amplifying fragment A, the following primers were used,AnA17 (5′-ATCTCGAACGAATGGGACTTGTTG-3′, nucleotides 912–935) and AnS18 (5′-GAAATCTCCGCATGCAGAGCACGT-3′ (5′-translated region, not shown)). A second, nested PCR amplification was performed using primers AnA8 (5′-ATACTCATCGGCAGAGAGGACGTTG-3′, nucleotides 669–693) and AnS18, resulting in a fragment of 1075 bp long. The same strategy was applied to amplify fragment B as follows: the first PCR reaction was carried out with primersAnS11 (5′-CAACGCCACAGTGCAATATCAGATC-3′, nucleotides 573–597) and AnA19 (5′-CTAGCTCTCAGTATCCGAAACAACCGT-3′, nucleotides 1651–1677). A nested PCR reaction was performed using primers AnS6 (5′-ACAGCATCCCGTGCAGTCGTGTCC-3′, nucleotides 604–627) and AnA19. The PCR end product was 1074 bp long. Fragments A and B were cloned into PCRScript (Stratagene), and the nucleotide sequence for each of them was determined from two independent clones. The reconstruction of the gene from these two fragments was done in Bluescript SK+. All operations were performed at room temperature. 150 ml of the crude dark brown Multifect PL extract (Genencor) was applied to a 7.6 × 58-cm column of Sephadex G-75 (63–88 μm) equilibrated in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2, containing 1% butanol. The column was developed at 190 ml/h, and 19-ml fractions were collected. PNGase At eluted sharply after the void volume (tubes 42–64) and was well separated from most of the dark brown pigmented material. The PNGase At Pool from two gel filtration runs was applied to a 2.0 × 11-cm column of Toyopearl DEAE 650 (35 μm) equilibrated in 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2. A linear gradient was developed from 0 to 0.4m NaCl over 4 h with a Waters 650 E advanced protein purification system. The flow rate was 300 ml/h, and 10-ml fractions were collected. PNGase At fractions were pooled from tubes 31 to 68 (0.05–0.15 m NaCl). Pooled fractions were diluted 10% by volume of 0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, brought to pH 7.3 with cold 1 n NaOH, and adjusted to 1 m ammonium sulfate. The extract was applied to a 1.6 × 47-cm column of Toyopearl butyl-650 M equilibrated in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 1 mammonium sulfate and 10 mm EDTA. A deceasing linear gradient (Waters, curve 6) to 50 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm EDTA was generated at 120 ml/h over 7 h, and 5-ml fractions were collected. The enzyme began eluting from the column at about 0.5 m ammonium sulfate. Pooled fractions from the previous step were dialyzed against 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and applied to a 1.6 × 11 cm column of Protein-Pak DEAE 15 HR (15 μm, Waters). A linear gradient was developed from 0 to 0.3 m NaCl over 3.5 h at a flow of 180 ml/h, and 4.5-ml fractions were collected. The PNGase At fractions from above were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon) to 19.5 ml, and the pH was raised to 7.5 with 1 m Tris chloride, pH 8.6. The sample was applied to a 0.9 × 19-cm column of concanavalin A-Sepharose (Sigma, type VA) equilibrated in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mmMgCl2. The column was washed in starting buffer for 1 h at a flow of 24 ml/h and then developed with a linear gradient to 250 mm methyl-d-mannoside over 6.8 h. Fractions of 1.6 ml were collected. PNGase At eluted as the most retarded material in tubes 45–76. The pooled fractions were dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and the retentate was loaded on a 0.9 × 14-cm column of Macro-Prep ceramic hydroxyapatite (type 1, Bio-Rad) equilibrated in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. The column was washed for 15 min at a flow rate of 30 ml/h and developed with a linear gradient from 0 to 0.1 m NaCl for 130 min. PNGase At in its native state was digested with trypsin, endoproteinase Glu-C, or endoproteinase Asp-N in ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8, according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Boehringer Mannheim). Trypsin-insoluble peptides were further degraded with pepsin in 0.1% formic acid. Peptides were isolated from these digests by reverse-phase HPLC on 1 × 150-cm Vydac columns. Unfractionated digests or purified glycopeptides were treated with PNGase F at pH 8.0 to release asparagine-linked oligosaccharides. All spectra were acquired on a Finnigan TSQ 700 equipped with a Finnigan ESI source. Samples were introduced into the mass spectrometer by infusion at a flow rate of 0.3 μl/min through a 20-μm inner diameter fused silica capillary. Solvents were various mixtures of water/methanol/acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid or 0.04% trifluoroacetic acid. LC-MS was accomplished with a homemade ∼50:1 splitter to introduce sample into the mass spectrometer at 0.5 to 1 μl/min. Peptide fractions from LC-MS were automatically collected for sequence analysis. Methyl ester derivatives were prepared by exposure to 1 n methanolic HCl. MS/MS spectra were generated at 20–40 eV collision energy with argon as the collision gas. Automated Edman degradation was performed with a model 477A Applied Biosystem pulsed liquid sequenator equipped with a model 120A amino acid analyzer. Sequence analysis (50–200 pmol) was conducted on samples isolated by HPLC or from Western blots on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes following SDS-PAGE (13Tarentino A.L. Quinones G. Hauer C.R. Changchien L.-M. Plummer Jr., T.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Native PNGase At (3.13 mg, 53 nmol) and equimolar Endo F1 (1.77 mg, 56 nmol) were incubated at 37 °C in 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.0, in a total volume of 15.3 ml. At 20 h the reaction was terminated by lyophilization. The sample was redissolved in 10 ml of water, and the pH was adjusted to 5.2 with 0.1 n acetic acid. The conductivity of the solution was equalized to 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2 by addition of water. To separate Endo F1 from deglycosylated PNGase At, the diluted sample was applied to a 0.5 × 10.5-cm column of Protein-Pak DEAE 15 HR (Waters) in 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2, at a flow rate of 30 ml/h. The column was washed in starting buffer for 20 min to completely remove Endo F1, followed by a gradient from 0 to 0.25 m NaCl over 30 min. Deglycosylated PNGase At was eluted in a stepwise manner with 0.5m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and then 0.5 m sodium acetate, pH 6.5. Carbohydrate analysis of deglycosylated PNGase At indicated a very low hexose content, consistent with essentially complete removal of the asparagine-linked oligosaccharides. Total carbohydrate was determined on PNGase At samples by the phenol-sulfuric acid method (14DuBois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (40861) Google Scholar). Monosaccharide and glucosamine analyses were done using 2 n trifluoroacetic acid at 100 °C for 5 h, and 4 n HCl at 100 °C for 6 h, respectively (15Weitzhandler M. Pohl C. Rohrer J. Narayanan L. Slingsby R. Avdalovic N. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 241: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Parallel analyses were done using 2 nHCl at 100° for 2.5 h (16Plummer Jr., T.H. Hurwitz M.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3907-3912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hen ovomucoid, GTN(CHO)ISK, was isolated from reduced carboxymethylated ovomucoid after tryptic followed by chymotryptic digestion. Glycopeptides were purified on Sephadex G-50 followed by chromatography on Dowex 50-X2 as described for IgM glycopeptides (17Plummer Jr., T.H. Tarentino A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10243-10246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other glycopeptides were purified as indicated: bovine fetuin, LAN(CHO)AeCS (where AeC is aminoethylcysteine) and LAN(CHO)CmCS (where CmC is carboxymethylcysteine) (18Plummer Jr., T.H. Tarentino A.L. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar); porcine fibrinogen, VEN(CHO)K, and VGEN(CHO)R (19Plummer Jr., T.H. Phelan A. Tarentino A.L. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 235: 98-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Pineapple bromelein glycopeptide was isolated from a thermolytic digest of reduced carboxymethylated enzyme after chromatography on Sephadex G-50 (17Plummer Jr., T.H. Tarentino A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10243-10246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Bakerbond Wide Pore C18 (19Plummer Jr., T.H. Phelan A. Tarentino A.L. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 235: 98-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A modified glycopeptide containing a core GlcNAc with an α1→6-linked fucose was produced as follows: Dns VGEN(CHO)R (0.78 μmol) was digested with Endo F3 (15 μg) in 400 μl of 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.75, for 3 h at 37 °C. The digestion mixture was fractionated on a 0.9 × 130-cm column of Sephadex G-15 developed in 0.1 n acetic acid. The truncated glycopeptide eluting at 45–57 ml was the major peak and was lyophilized and quantitated for use in rate determinations. Glycopeptides were dansylated by the method of Tapuchiet al. (20Tapuchi Y. Schmidt D.E. Linder W. Karger B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 115: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). PNGase assays were performed by HPLC as described previously for Endo F2 and Endo F3 (2Tarentino A.L. Plummer Jr., T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) but were done in 0.1m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, for PNGase At and PNGase A and in 0.1 m HEPES, pH 8.8, for PNGase F. One milliunit corresponds to 1 nmol of glycopeptide hydrolyzed per min at 37 °C at the appropriate pH. Products from PNGase At-hydrolyzed glycopeptides were identified on HPLC by reference to the known cleavage products from PNGase A and PNGase F. Multifect PL enzyme is a highly concentrated commercial extract of the secretory enzymes from a proprietary strain (Genencor) of the fungus, A. tubigensis. It contains numerous glycosidases, carbohydrases, and proteases, etc. and is widely used in the food industry. The purification of PNGase At to homogeneity from this crude material is summarized in TableI. Typically, 300 ml of multifect PL extract yielded 4 mg of pure PNGase At at an average final specific activity of 53,860 nmol of di-dansyl fetuin glycopeptide hydrolyzed per min per mg. The enzyme migrated on SDS-PAGE as a heterogeneous band with an apparent M r of about 43,000 (Fig.1, lane 1). Peptide fragments derived from purified PNGase At were used to design oligonucleotides for cloning the PNGase At gene.Table ISummary of the purification of PNGase AtPurification stepVolumeTotal A 2801-aThe absorbance at 280 nm was used as an approximation to the protein concentration during purification.

Open table in a new tab The PNGase At gene was cloned and sequenced in two fragments using PCR-based methodology. The gene was reconstructed as depicted in Fig.2, and the complete sequence reconfirmed. The complete nucleotide sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence of the PNGase At gene is presented in Fig.3. Edman analysis identified the amino terminus of native PNGase At as LLEVFEVYQ…., but a background sequence was also present in the data and identified as another subunit only in retrospect (see below). Assuming that the first methionine at position −21 is the translation start codon, as is the case with most fungal genes (21Gurr S.J. Unkles S.E. Kinghorn J.R. Kinghorn J.R. The Structure and Organization of Filamentous Fungi. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1987: 93-139Google Scholar), then the open reading frame of the gene encodes a typical hydrophobic signal peptide of 21 amino acids as expected for a protein secreted by A. tubigensis. The open reading frame contains a single 58-bp intron (Fig. 2) with the expected 5′-donor and 3′-acceptor splice sites (22Van den Hombergh J.P.T.W. Jarai G. Buxton F.P. Visser J. Gene ( Amst .). 1994; 151: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and codes for a mature protein of 537 amino acids with a predicted molecular average mass of 59,335 Da. Twelve potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) were identified and are highlighted in Fig.3.Figure 3The nucleotide sequence of the PNGase At cDNA and the deduced amino acid sequence. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences are numbered from the leftbeginning with the first start codon. The signal sequence starts at [mimus]21 and is underlined.

Thedouble asterisks (**) indicate the cleavage site for α-and β-subunit formation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As shown in TableII, over 80% of the deduced amino acid sequence was corroborated independently by ESI-MS and Edman analysis of protease fragments of PNGase At. Of the 12 potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites (Table III), sites 1, 6, and 11 were unoccupied and sites 9 and 12 were not identified at the peptide level. Sites 9 and 12 must be glycosylated since glucosamine and mannose analysis of the intact protein by phenol-sulfuric assay estimated a total of 9.6 oligosaccharide chains. Seven sites were shown by ESI-MS analysis to be fully or partially occupied with high mannose oligosaccharides. Man6GlcNAc2 was found almost exclusively at site 2. ESI-MS analysis of permethylated Endo F1-released oligosaccharides as well as Dionex PA-100 chromatographic analysis demonstrated that all other glycosylation sites were predominantly Man5GlcNAc (71%), with small amounts of Man6–9 GlcNAc. At sites 3–5, 7, and 10, peptides were identified by MS analysis with a mass consistent with the presence of a single GlcNAc residue (5–10%). This finding suggests the action of a trace endoglycosidase in the Multifect PL preparation that cleaves the di-N-acetylchitobiose linkage at accessible sites in PNGase At, but thus far such an activity has not been detected.Table IIVerification of the deduced DNA sequence of the PNGase At gene by peptide analysis of the mature proteinAmino termini2-aDetermined from Edman analysis of the isolated subunits after SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.TrypsinPepsinEndo-AspNresidue numberα-Subunit 1–1969–8151–572-bPeptides containing asparagine-linked glycosylation sites.28–502-bPeptides containing asparagine-linked glycosylation sites.266–372β-Subunit 336–35382–98124–1332-bPeptides containing asparagine-linked glycosylation sites.91–115273–282339–35699–108165–1752-bPeptides containing asparagine-linked glycosylation sites.116–122290–299269–282186–191123–128429–4442-bPeptides containing asparagine-linked glycosylation sites.286–292279–2902-bPeptides containing asparagine-linked glycosylation sites.129–146445–457336–353306–313147–1632-bPeptides containing asparagine-linked glycosylation sites.458–480354–3742-bPeptides containing asparagine-linked glycosylation sites.315–321208–212481–508375–379213–226507–5182-cIsolated from S. aureus V8 protease digest.406–4242-bPeptides containing asparagine-linked glycosylation sites.240–2652-a Determined from Edman analysis of the isolated subunits after SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.2-b Peptides containing asparagine-linked glycosylation sites.2-c Isolated from S. aureus V8 protease digest.

One O-linked glycosylation site at Thr352 was found by mass spectrometry; it contained mainly a single hexose (95%) and a small amount of a di-hexose (5%). From the DNA sequence (Fig. 3) it is clear that the primary translation product of PNGase At is a single polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 59,335 Da. Post-transcriptional processing adds between 7 and 9 high mannose chains (average, Man5GlcNAc2) increasing the mass by about 9–11 kDa to over 70,000 Da. Because of the well-known anomalous behavior of large glycoproteins during SDS-PAGE, it was expected that PNGase At would migrate with an apparentM r greater than its calculated mass of 70,000 daltons. However, six different preparations showed the same unusual result; PNGase At migrated on SDS-PAGE as a heterogeneous band with an apparent M r slightly less than 43,000 (Fig. 1,lane 1). This result suggests that PNGase At consists of two glycosylated subunits that dissociate in SDS and co-migrate on SDS-PAGE with an apparent M r around 43,000. After removal of the asparagine-linked oligosaccharides with Endo F1, deglycosylated PNGase At migrated as two well-resolved polypeptides (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 4), an α-subunit with an apparent M r about 38,000 and a lighter staining β-subunit with an apparent M r of 28,000. Additional evidence that PNGase At is composed of two non-identical subunits was provided by size-exclusion HPLC using the LKB Blue column. Under non-denaturing conditions PNGase At eluted in a high molecular weight form estimated to be 80,000 (Fig.4 A). However, after denaturation with SDS, the enzyme eluted as two subunits with an estimated M r of 42,000 and 26,000, respectively (Fig. 4 B). Both the glycosylated and deglycosylated form of PNGase At were resolved into their subunits by HPLC, whereas on SDS-PAGE only the deglycosylated form was resolved. Note thatA and B are not directly comparable by sizeversus elution time because SDS shifts the molecular weight standard curve to the left. The amino acid sequence of the two subunits was determined on deglycosylated PNGase At by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting of the subunits to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Edman analysis (TableII) of the deglycosylated α-subunit gave the amino-terminal sequence LLEVFEVYQ …, which corresponds to the amino terminus found for the intact protein. The deglycosylated β-subunit sequenced as two polypeptides, TGQAPEIYAPAP … (40%) and a truncated form APEIYAPAP … (60%). Re-examination of the original sequence data on intact PNGase At (see above) indicated that the background sequence referred to in the cloning section corresponded to the amino-terminal sequence of the β-subunit and that the α- and β-subunits are present in approximately 1:1 ratio. Subunit formation occurs in a Ser/Thr-rich hydrophilic region of PNGase At between residues Thr335-Thr336 (Fig. 3, **). At this point it has not been established whether this cleavage is the result of a specific protease or is caused by an autoproteolytic reaction. As a working hypothesis we favor the latter, because of the similarity of PNGase At to a new class of amidase/amidohydrolase enzymes, designated Ntn-amidohydrolases (reviewed in Ref. 23Aronson Jr., N.N. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Ntn-amidohydrolases (e.g. glycosylasparaginase) are derived from a single inactive precursor gene product via an autoproteolytic reaction. This mechanism places a reactive Thr, Ser, or Cys residue on the amino end of the β-subunit, where it functions as a combined base-nucleophile catalyst. If autoproteolysis is responsible for the Thr336 form on the β-subunit of PNGase At, the enzyme should be only 40% active because 60% of the molecules have been degraded to the Ala339 form. This conversion did not result from deglycosylation by Endo F1 because native and deglycosylated PNGase At have the same specific activity. It is probably due to an aminopeptidase in the multifect PL extract. PNGase At has no structural homology to PNGase F or to any other protein in the data bases. It has a 2-fold excess of acidic amino acids and a relatively low isoelectric point of 4.1. The pH activity curve is broad with a pH optimum at 5.0; at pH 3 and pH 8.6 the enzyme is 80 and 65%, respectively, of the maximum. In contrast PNGase F is less than 20% active at pH 5, and its pH optimum is between 8.6 and 9.0. Like many proteins secreted by A. tubigensis, PNGase At is relatively thermostable. It retains 65–70% of its original activity during incubation at 62 °C for 8 h, unlike PNGase F, which is inactive after 1 h at 62 °C. Glycopeptides can be hydrolyzed by PNGase At at 62 °C at over three times the rate at 37 °C. This is a useful property especially for glycopeptides with amino-terminal or carboxyl-terminal oligosaccharides, which are, in general, poor substrates for PNGase-type enzymes. Thus PNGase At is functional under conditions beyond the useful range for PNGase F. A comparative analysis of the rates of hydrolysis of PNGase At and PNGase F toward selected glycopeptides is shown in TableIV. PNGase At has a broad substrate specificity hydrolyzing triantennary, biantennary, hybrid (Table IV), as well as high mannose-type (not shown) glycans. Triantennary glycans were preferred substrates for PNGase At and PNGase F. The negative charge of the carboxy-methyl group adjacent to the deglycosylation site adversely affects both enzymes compared with the corresponding amino-ethyl derivative. In general, the rates of hydrolysis by PNGase At were 3–4-fold slower at 37 °C than for PNGase F, except for the last two substrates in Table IV. As indicated in the preceding section, however, PNGase At may only be 40% active because of the loss of Thr336 from the β-subunit. Interestingly, a truncated porcine fibrinogen glycopeptide (core fucα1→6GlcNAc) was hydrolyzed completely by PNGase At, albeit at a low rate, whereas it was completely resistant to PNGase F. This is an expected finding since a di-N-acetylchitobiose moiety is the minimum carbohydrate length required for PNGase F activity. Another indication of a difference in the active center of PNGase At and PNGase F is illustrated by the bromelain glycopeptide data in Table IV. PNGase At cleaved this glycopeptide at a very good rate, but it was totally resistant to PNGase F. The di-N-acetylchitobiose-binding domain in the active center of PNGase F allows for hydrolysis of glycans with fucose attached to the α1→6 position of the core proximal GlcNAc residue but lacks space for binding glycans with fucose in the α1→3 position (5Kuhn P.

Open table in a new tab PNGase At is more closely related in terms of substrate specificity to the almond enzyme PNGase A (glycopeptidase A) than to the bacterial enzyme PNGase F. PNGase At and PNGase A (24Takahashi N. Takahashi N. Muramatsu T. Handbook of Endoglycosidases and Glycoamidases. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 183-198Google Scholar) both hydrolyze a broad array of oligosaccharide types, including very short glycans, as well as oligosaccharides with α1→6 or α1→3 core-linked fucose (25Tretter V.

J. 1995; 12: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). PNGase At, like PNGase A, does not hydrolyze intact glycoproteins efficiently but prefers glycopeptide substrates. For two enzymes performing the same catalytic function, it is striking that PNGase At and PNGase F are so dissimilar; they have no primary structural homology, their molecular weight and subunit structure are very different, and their physical properties and specificity are different. Among the large endoglycosidase family of enzymes, for example, one always sees clear indications of relatedness in structure and function, but the glycoamidases PNGase F and PNGase At appear to have developed along different evolutionary lines. What path a mammalian enzyme would follow is unclear at this time. We are currently developing a high expression system to study PNGase At. Unresolved questions will require a demonstration of the putative primary translation product and its conversion to α- and β-subunits. X-ray crystallographic analysis of PNGase At and comparison with PNGase F will be important for investigating the development of the active center of these glycoamidases.

This gene is unusual in that it codes for two distinct proteins: a small mitochondrial protein, p8MTCP1, and a putative oncogenic protein, p13MTCP1. Scarcity of material from t(X;14)-associated proliferations and very low levels of mRNA expression have so far prevented a thorough description of p13MTCP1-encoding transcripts. Here, we characterize two additional t(X;14) bearing leukemias allowing this analysis. In one case, with a breakpoint located 5' to the MTCP1 gene, the level of transcription of previously described p13MTCP1-encoding transcripts is enhanced. In the second case, with a breakpoint within the MTCP1 intron I, an alternative transcription initiation site is demonstrated in the tumor cells at 229 bp upstream to exon II. The identification of this internal promoter, together with the similarity between TCL1 and MTCP1 genomic structures, allow us to propose a model in which the duplication of an ancestral gene was followed by the insertion of one copy within the intron of a p8-encoding gene, accounting for the unusual feature of the MTCP1 gene."
