https://openalex.org/W1510858660,"Abstract Polynucleotide ligase has been purified 1000-fold from extracts of Escherichia coli infected with bacteriophage T4. The enzyme catalyzes (a) the repair of phosphodiester bond scissions introduced into the strands of bihelical DNA by pancreatic DNase and (b) the conversion of hydrogen-bonded circular duplexes or concatemers of λ bacteriophage DNA to covalently bonded circular molecules or concatemers, respectively. The DNA products of these reactions have been characterized by sedimentation and end group analysis. The ligase does not catalyze the end to end joining of T7 bacteriophage DNA. The standard assay for ligase activity measures the protection of a 32P-labeled 5'-phosphoryl group, located at a single strand break in DNA, from attack by bacterial alkaline phosphatase. The enzyme purification procedure has been redesigned to eliminate the necessity for enzyme assays during the early fractionation steps and to permit the use of a simple assay, based on ATP-PPi exchange, during the later stages of purification. The ligase reaction has a specific requirement for a bihelical DNA substrate and for ATP, and it results in the formation of phosphodiester bonds, AMP, and pyrophosphate. The Km for DNA containing single strand breaks is 1.5 x 10-9 m expressed as the concentration of internal phosphomonoesters. The Km for ATP is 1.4 x 10-5 m, and dATP is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme (Ki of 3.5 x 10-5 m)."

https://openalex.org/W1969324074,"Terminal events in protein synthesis were studied with trinucleotide codons. Initiator and terminator trinucleotides sequentially stimulate N-formyl-methionyl-tRNA binding to ribosomes and the release of free N-formyl-methionine from the ribosomal intermediate. The release factor discovered by Capecchi is also required. The trinucleotides UGA, UAA, and UAG were found to be terminator codons. This pattern of codon degeneracy has not been observed with other trinucleotides and transfer RNA."

https://openalex.org/W1529003424,"Abstract A system for detecting the effects of metal ions, repressors, and mutations on the biosynthesis in vivo of alkaline phosphatase of Escherichia coli is described. If E. coli constitutive for alkaline phosphatase are grown in a medium containing 65Zn and are subject to osmotic shock, about 50% of the zinc taken up by the cells is released into the medium. Chromatography of this medium shows that most of the 65Zn is associated with alkaline phosphatase. The ratio of specific radioactivity to enzyme shows 2 to 3 g atoms of zinc incorporated per mole of alkaline phosphatase under these conditions. This biosynthetically incorporated zinc is not exchangeable with exogenous zinc added to the medium after osmotic shock. In the case of the wild type organisms, phosphate suppresses but does not abolish incorporation of 65Zn into the cell region accessible to osmotic shock. Chromatography shows no 65Zn alkaline phosphatase, but does show the presence of another zinc protein unaffected by the presence of phosphate. E. coli mutants, U9 and U47, which produce defective alkaline phosphatases do not incorporate 65Zn normally. Under zinc-free conditions (l10-8 m Zn (II)) E. coli grows normally and synthesizes a zinc-free inactive apoenzyme. The highly purified biosynthesized apoenzyme can be completely reactivated by zinc. Optical rotatory dispersion, circular dichroism, and sedimentation velocity centrifugation reveal that the conformation and quaternary structure of this product do not differ significantly from the enzyme synthesized in the presence of Zn(II). In the presence of Co(II) and Cd(II), the organism can be forced to synthesize alkaline phosphatases containing these metal ions. If equal concentrations of Zn(II) are present, however, the enzyme is synthesized containing only Zn(II)."

The enzyme is homogeneous in the ultracentrifuge and better than 98% pure by disc acrylamide electrophoresis. The s020,w is 12.65 x 10-13 sec at pH 7.6, 12.72 x 10-13 sec at pH 6.0, and 12.66 x 10-13 sec at pH 5.0. There is no evidence of concentration-dependent dissociation of the enzyme from pH 5.0 to pH 7.6. The molecular weight determined by sedimentation equilibrium is 3.62 ± 0.16 x 105. The enzyme exhibits only slight activity toward d-fucose, l-fucose, and d-xylose and no activity toward any of the other compounds tested. Several polyalcohols, from 3 to 5 carbon atoms in length, are effective inhibitors of the enzyme, and at least two of these, l-arabitol and ribitol, are competitive inhibitors. Activation by Mn++ has been demonstrated by means of enzyme dialyzed against ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, but not with nondialyzed enzyme. An amino acid analysis is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1559100537,"Polynucleotide ligase from Escherichia coli infected with bacteriophage T4 catalyzes the esterification of interrupted phosphodiester bonds (single strand breaks) within a DNA duplex. Purified preparations of the enzyme also catalyze an isotopic exchange reaction between ATP and 32PPi. However, they do not catalyze a measurable exchange between 3H-AMP and ATP. A radioactively labeled ligaseAMP complex has been isolated by gel filtration and its properties have been studied. Although purified preparations of polynucleotide ligase require ATP for the esterification of interrupted phosphodiester bonds in a DNA substrate, preparations of ligase-AMP can form phosphodiester bonds in the absence of added ATP. Release of AMP occurs during this reaction and is dependent on the presence of 5′-phosphomonoesters at single strand breaks in the DNA duplex. The extent of the release of AMP is proportional to the number of internal 5′-phosphomonoesters present in the reaction mixture. Native T7 DNA, denatured DNA, sonically treated DNA, and DNA containing only 5′-hydroxyl end groups produce little, if any, ligase-AMP breakdown. The DNA-dependent breakdown of the ligase-AMP complex provides a sensitive method for determining the number of internal 5′-phosphomonoesters in preparations of duplex DNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1574553471,"Abstract Alkaline phosphatase of intestinal origin hydrolyzed the S-substituted monoesters of phosphorothioic acid of the type RSPO3Na2 (R = —CH2CH2NH2, —CH2CH2NHCOCH3, —CH2COO, or —CH2CH2COOC2H5) at the S—P bond to yield orthophosphate and the corresponding thioalcohols. The rate of enzymic hydrolysis of cysteamine S-phosphate was measured at pH 9.0 in 0.1 n sodium barbital buffer at different concentrations of substrate and MgCl2. The Km and Vmax values obtained, as well as the amount of MgCl2 required for complete activation of the enzyme, were similar to the corresponding values obtained when p-nitrophenyl phosphate was used as the substrate. In marked contrast, however, O-substituted monoesters of phosphorothioic acid of the type ROPO2SKH (R = —CH3, —CH2CH3, or [See PDF for structure]NO2) were completely resistant to hydrolysis by alkaline phosphatases from Escherichia coli and from intestine. The O-substituted monoesters of thiophosphoric acid (10-7 m) inhibited the enzymic hydrolysis of both cysteamine S-phosphate and p-nitrophenyl phosphate (10-3 m) at a 10-fold concentration of the enzyme. Acid phosphatases from wheat germ, potato, and prostate gland did not hydrolyze S-substituted monoesters of phosphorothioic acid at detectable rates, but did hydrolyze O-substituted monoesters of phosphorothioic acid at rates comparable with those obtained when p-nitrophenyl phosphate served as the substrate for these enzymes. These findings suggest that acid and alkaline phosphatases act by two different mechanisms."

Phagocytosis of normal or parasitized red cells was not observed."
https://openalex.org/W1577918603,"Abstract A new method for the assay of DNA endonuclease activity has been devised. It is based on the release of DNA fragments from DNA entrapped in a polyacrylamide gel. The average molecular weight of the fragments released is approximately 400,000. This method has been used to examine the kinetics of DNA degradation. Hydrolysis by DNase I as a function of time and also as a function of enzyme concentration with Mg2+ as the divalent cation showed an initial lag. This was not observed with DNase II or Escherichia coli endonuclease I. The difference in kinetics is considered to represent the difference between a double hit and a single hit mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W32638465,"Seryl transfer RNA synthetase from bakers' yeast reacted with adenosine triphosphate and serine in the presence of magnesium to form a seryladenylate-enzyme complex which could transfer its seryl moiety to serine tRNA from yeast only in the presence of magnesium or other suitable cofactor. Spermidine was an effective substitute for magnesium in the transfer reaction. Serine-specific tRNA from yeast had a marked labilizing effect on the seryladenylate-enzyme complex to a greater extent than could be accounted for by the degree of transfer. Non-amino acid-accepting CpC terminal serine tRNA from yeast also had this property, but serine tRNA from Escherichia coli and a mixture of non-serine tRNAs from yeast did not."

https://openalex.org/W1578799016,"Abstract The initial step in biosynthesis of the O-antigen of Salmonella typhimurium is the formation of a lipid-linked derivative of galactose 1-phosphate, according to the reaction UDP-galactose + P-lipid ⇌ galactose-1-PP-lipid + UMP. The enzyme activity has been detected in the cell envelope fraction of Citrobacter strain 139 (0–4, 5, 12) as well as in wild type S. typhimurium strain LT-2, but is most readily demonstrated in cell envelope fractions obtained from a mutant strain of S. typhimurium lacking UDP-galactose 4-epimerase following growth in the presence of galactose. The enzyme catalyzes transfer of the entire galactose 1-phosphate moiety of UDP-galactose to the lipid acceptor with concomitant formation of stoichiometric amounts of UMP. The reaction is readily reversible, with an apparent equilibrium constant of approximately 0.5."

https://openalex.org/W1530750782,"Abstract The effect of ribosome species on ambiguity during the transfer of amino acids from Escherichia coli aminoacyl transfer RNAs into protein has been examined under a variety of environmental conditions. Streptomycin greatly enhanced polyuridylic acid-directed transfer of leucine relative to phenylalanine (ambiguity ratio) with E. coli ribosomes, but had little effect with equivalent concentrations of reticulocyte ribosomes. The addition of E. coli supernatant fraction did not increase the ambiguity ratio obtained with reticulocyte ribosomes. In the presence of streptomycin, ambiguity was maximal at low concentrations of transfer RNA with E. coli ribosomes; transfer RNA concentration had a lesser effect on the low ambiguity obtained with reticulocyte ribosomes. Raising the magnesium concentration from 6 to 13 x 10-3 m increased the ambiguity ratio from 9 to 63% with E. coli ribosomes and from 0 to 25% with reticulocyte ribosomes. Ethanol increased the ambiguity ratio with E. coli ribosomes but not with reticulocyte ribosomes. The high fidelity of reticulocyte ribosomes was not restricted to leucine-phenylalanine ambiguity; although streptomycin caused a copolymer of uridylic and guanylic acid to miscode for arginine with E. coli ribosomes, this effect was not observed with reticulocyte ribosomes. These results show that streptomycin, a low concentration of transfer RNA, a high concentration of magnesium, and the addition of ethanol exert their miscoding effects at the ribosomal level. The fact that reticulocyte ribosomes are more resistant to these miscoding effects than E. coli ribosomes suggests that the ribosome plays an active role in codon recognition."

https://openalex.org/W1585155417,"Abstract An enzyme, catalyzing phosphoryl transfers from phosphoramidate or from various hexose phosphates, has been purified to a high degree from extracts of Escherichia coli. The purification involves the preferential denaturation of contaminating proteins at acid and at alkaline pH values, followed by chromatography on Biogel P-20, carboxymethyl cellulose, and diethylaminoethyl cellulose. The resulting enzyme is essentially homogeneous as shown by acrylamide gel electrophoresis and sucrose gradient centrifugation. It is capable of transferring phosphoryl groups from phosphoramidate and from several hexose phosphates to a variety of hexose (glucose, fructose, and mannose) acceptors and also to water. The pH optima, inhibitor specificities, and characteristics of the various reactions catalyzed by the enzyme are reported."
https://openalex.org/W1523567424,"Abstract The optical rotatory behavior of six proteins with and without supporting electrolyte was examined over a broad concentration range, 0.25 to 36% (w/v) in the case of bovine plasma albumin. The specific optical rotation, Moffitt-Yang parameters (a0 and b0), and Shechter-Blout parameters were calculated in the wave length region of 330 to 600 mµ. Values of the specific optical rotation and a0 of α-chymotrypsin at pH 3.7 in the absence of added electrolyte were reversibly dependent upon concentration while b0 remained constant. Raising the pH of the solution to 6.2 suppressed the concentration dependence, and ionic strengths near 0.2 completely abolished it. Sedimentation velocity, chromatography, and viscosity experiments ruled out polymerization as a source of the observed optical rotatory dispersion changes. It is concluded that α-chymotrypsin under certain conditions (pH 3.7 and ionic strength much less than 0.2) undergoes a detectable change in conformation. A possibility exists that this transition of α-chymotrypsin can be influenced by the dissociation of a small molecule (or molecules). Values of all the optical rotatory parameters for bovine plasma albumin, lysozyme, pepsin, egg albumin, and β-lactoglobulin were found to be independent of concentration. This suggests that the self-association of most globular proteins in solutions up to 36% protein leads to no conformational changes as judged from optical rotatory dispersion measurements. This is so with a strongly interacting and multidisperse solution, with no known biological function, such as lysozyme and bovine plasma albumin (16% total protein). These results provide a firm experimental basis for the investigation of biologically interesting systems at extraordinarily high concentrations by means of optical rotation."

https://openalex.org/W1581800633,"Abstract A highly purified phosphoryl transfer enzyme obtained from Escherichia coli catalyzes the transfer of phosphoryl groups from phosphoramidate, glucose 1-phosphate, and glucose 6-phosphate to either water or to glucose and structurally related hexoses. The various phosphoryl donor substrates have been shown to be mutually competitive inhibitors in kinetic studies, and product-labeling experiments have confirmed this finding. Evidence for the intermediate formation of a phosphorylated enzyme which was shown to be acid-, but not alkali-, labile has been obtained. It is suggested that the several transfer processes catalyzed by this enzyme are mediated by a common phosphoryl intermediate."

https://openalex.org/W1504537893,"Abstract Diaminopimelate-2-14C incorporation was used as one index of peptidoglycan synthesis in Escherichia coli B. Typical log phase E. coli B cells incorporated diaminopimelate into an acid-insoluble form linearly, whereas nutritionally induced log phase filamentous E. coli B did not incorporate this isotope into mucopeptide. Characterization of the acid-soluble radioactive components showed that both normal and filamentous cells metabolized diaminopimelate. Uridine diphosphomuramyl tri- and pentapeptide intermediates in peptidoglycan synthesis accumulated in filamentous but not in the normal E. coli B cells. N-Acetylglucosamine-14C was synthesized from uniformly labeled glucosamine-14C. Incorporation of N-acetylglucosamine was used as a second index of peptidoglycan synthesis. While not as specific a precursor as diaminopimelate, it was incorporated 25 times more efficiently in the normal cells. Isolation of the mucopeptide fraction showed at least 88% inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis in the filamentous E. coli B cells. Lipopolysaccharide synthesis in filamentous cells was also inhibited. This was characterized by a 50% reduction in 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate and a 70% reduction in glucose content as compared to isolated lipopolysaccharide from normal cells. The heptose, phosphorus, and β-hydroxymyristate concentrations were the same in lipopolysaccharides isolated from both cell forms. These data suggest that some steps involved in mucopeptide and lipopolysaccharide polymerizations are inhibited in the nutritionally induced filamentous cell form of E. coli B. These reactions involving nucleotide-activated precursors may be inhibited because of an altered membrane structure which has already been observed both morphologically and biochemically in these cells."
