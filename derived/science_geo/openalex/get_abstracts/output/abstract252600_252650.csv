https://openalex.org/W2108920131,"Bacterial pathogens frequently use protein secretion to mediate interactions with their hosts. Here we found that a virulence locus (HSI-I) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa encodes a protein secretion apparatus. The apparatus assembled in discrete subcellular locations and exported Hcp1, a hexameric protein that forms rings with a 40 angstrom internal diameter. Regulatory patterns of HSI-I suggested that the apparatus functions during chronic infections. We detected Hcp1 in pulmonary secretions of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and Hcp1-specific antibodies in their sera. Thus, HSI-I likely contributes to the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa in CF patients. HSI-I–related loci are widely distributed among bacterial pathogens and may play a general role in mediating host interactions."

https://openalex.org/W2160174395,"Horizontal gene transfer plays a major role in microbial evolution. However, newly acquired sequences can decrease fitness unless integrated into preexisting regulatory networks. We found that the histone-like nucleoid structuring protein (H-NS) selectively silences horizontally acquired genes by targeting sequences with GC content lower than the resident genome. Mutations in hns are lethal in Salmonella unless accompanied by compensatory mutations in other regulatory loci. Thus, H-NS provides a previously unrecognized mechanism of bacterial defense against foreign DNA, enabling the acquisition of DNA from exogenous sources while avoiding detrimental consequences from unregulated expression of newly acquired genes. Characteristic GC/AT ratios of bacterial genomes may facilitate discrimination between a cell's own DNA and foreign DNA."

However, ceria nanoparticles synthesized by existing techniques are irregularly faceted, and they scratch the silicon wafers and increase defect concentrations. We developed an approach for large-scale synthesis of single-crystal ceria nanospheres that can reduce the polishing defects by 80% and increase the silica removal rate by 50%, facilitating precise and reliable mass-manufacturing of chips for nanoelectronics. We doped the ceria system with titanium, using flame temperatures that facilitate crystallization of the ceria yet retain the titania in a molten state. In conjunction with molecular dynamics simulation, we show that under these conditions, the inner ceria core evolves in a single-crystal spherical shape without faceting, because throughout the crystallization it is completely encapsulated by a molten 1- to 2-nanometer shell of titania that, in liquid state, minimizes the surface energy. The principle demonstrated here could be applied to other oxide systems."

Previous functional imaging experiments have not been able to answer this question because proficient bilinguals activate the same brain regions irrespective of the language being tested. Here, we reveal that neuronal responses within the left caudate are sensitive to changes in the language or the meaning of words. By demonstrating this effect in populations of German-English and Japanese-English bilinguals, we suggest that the left caudate plays a universal role in monitoring and controlling the language in use."

In Arabidopsis , the topless-1 ( tpl-1 ) mutation transforms the shoot pole into a second root pole. Here, we show that TPL resembles known transcriptional corepressors and that tpl-1 acts as a dominant negative mutation for multiple TPL-related proteins. Mutations in the putative coactivator HISTONE ACETYLTRANSFERASE GNAT SUPERFAMILY1 suppress the tpl-1 phenotype. Mutations in HISTONE DEACETYLASE19 , a putative corepressor, increase the penetrance of tpl-1 and display similar apical defects. These data point to a transcriptional repression mechanism that prevents root formation in the shoot pole during Arabidopsis embryogenesis."

We immunized monkeys with plasmid DNA and replication-defective adenoviral vectors encoding SIV proteins and then challenged them with pathogenic SIV. Although these monkeys demonstrated a reduction in viremia restricted to the early phase of SIV infection, they showed a prolonged survival. This survival was associated with preserved central memory CD4 + T lymphocytes and could be predicted by the magnitude of the vaccine-induced cellular immune response. These immune correlates of vaccine efficacy should guide the evaluation of AIDS vaccines in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2142896906,"During the early Pliocene, 5 to 3 million years ago, globally averaged temperatures were substantially higher than they are today, even though the external factors that determine climate were essentially the same. In the tropics, El Niño was continual (or “permanent”) rather than intermittent. The appearance of northern continental glaciers, and of cold surface waters in oceanic upwelling zones in low latitudes (both coastal and equatorial), signaled the termination of those warm climate conditions and the end of permanent El Niño. This led to the amplification of obliquity (but not precession) cycles in equatorial sea surface temperatures and in global ice volume, with the former leading the latter by several thousand years. A possible explanation is that the gradual shoaling of the oceanic thermocline reached a threshold around 3 million years ago, when the winds started bringing cold waters to the surface in low latitudes. This introduced feedbacks involving ocean-atmosphere interactions that, along with ice-albedo feedbacks, amplified obliquity cycles. A future melting of glaciers, changes in the hydrological cycle, and a deepening of the thermocline could restore the warm conditions of the early Pliocene."

However, 10 Be exposure dates show that large-scale retreat of mid-latitude Last Glacial Maximum glaciers commenced at about the same time in both hemispheres. The timing of retreat is consistent with the onset of temperature and atmospheric CO 2 increases in Antarctic ice cores. We suggest that a global trend of rising summer temperatures at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum was obscured in North Atlantic regions by hypercold winters associated with unusually extensive winter sea ice."

By using metal and semiconducting nanoparticles, a ∼100-nm-thick, large-area thin-film device is self-assembled such that the change in current density through the film and the electroluminescent light intensity are linearly proportional to the local stress. A stress image is obtained by pressing a copper grid and a United States 1-cent coin on the device and focusing the resulting electroluminescent light directly on the charge-coupled device. Both the lateral and height resolution of texture are comparable to the human finger at similar stress levels of ∼10 kilopascals."

Reversible adsorption of H 2 S on cerium and lanthanum oxide surfaces is demonstrated over many cycles at temperatures as high as 800°C, on both fresh or presulfided sorbents, and at very high space velocities. The adsorption and desorption processes are very fast, and removal of H 2 S to sub–parts per million levels is achieved at very short (millisecond) contact times.

https://openalex.org/W2130493719,"Most ecological hypotheses about species coexistence hinge on species differences, but quantifying trait differences across species in diverse communities is often unfeasible. We examined the variation of demographic traits using a global tropical forest data set covering 4500 species in 10 large-scale tree inventories. With a hierarchical Bayesian approach, we quantified the distribution of mortality and growth rates of all tree species at each site. This allowed us to test the prediction that demographic differences facilitate species richness, as suggested by the theory that a tradeoff between high growth and high survival allows species to coexist. Contrary to the prediction, the most diverse forests had the least demographic variation. Although demographic differences may foster coexistence, they do not explain any of the 16-fold variation in tree species richness observed across the tropics."
https://openalex.org/W1966950471,"Homozygous inactivation of BLM gives rise to Bloom's syndrome, a disorder associated with genomic instability and cancer predisposition. BLM encodes a member of the RecQ DNA helicase family that is required for the maintenance of genome stability and the suppression of sister-chromatid exchanges. BLM has been proposed to function in the rescue of replication forks that have collapsed or stalled as a result of encountering lesions that block fork progression. One proposed mechanism of fork rescue involves regression in which the nascent leading and lagging strands anneal to create a so-called “chicken foot” structure. Here we have developed an in vitro system for analysis of fork regression and show that BLM, but not Escherichia coli RecQ, can promote the regression of a model replication fork. BLM-mediated fork regression is ATP-dependent and occurs processively, generating regressed arms of >250 bp in length. These data establish the existence of a eukaryotic protein that could promote replication fork regression in vivo and suggest a novel pathway through which BLM might suppress genetic exchanges.

These data establish the existence of a eukaryotic protein that could promote replication fork regression in vivo and suggest a novel pathway through which BLM might suppress genetic exchanges. In every cell cycle, the replication apparatus encounters numerous chemical and protein blocks that can perturb fork progression (1Rothstein R. Michel B. Gangloff S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1-10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The consequences of such encounters and the subsequent replication re-start processes employed will depend on both the type of lesion and on the template strand on which the damage resides. Lesions on the lagging strand template can, theoretically, be by-passed via the priming of an Okazaki fragment downstream of the lesion resulting in a gap in the nascent lagging strand. These gaps can then be filled, post-replicatively, by error-prone translesion polymerases or repaired in an error-free manner by homologous recombination (1Rothstein R. Michel B. Gangloff S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1-10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Friedberg E.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Lesions on the leading strand template, however, may cause the replisome to stall. On such occasions, lagging strand synthesis can become uncoupled from leading strand synthesis, with the result that the lagging strand is extended beyond the site of the lesion (3Higuchi K. Katayama T. Iwai S. Hidaka M. Horiuchi T. Maki H. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 437-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 4McInerney P. O'Donnell M. J. Biol.

This apparently futile extension of the nascent lagging strand may actually serve an important role in lesion bypass. If, as proposed, the fork were to regress via annealing of the nascent strands, the longer lagging strand can provide a template for the prematurely terminated leading strand to be extended. In this way, by a process of template switching, leading strand synthesis can be continued beyond the point of the block on the parental template, effectively “bypassing” the lesion. The fork can then be re-established to allow leading strand synthesis to re-commence through either reversal of the regressed fork or recombination-dependent invasion of the regressed arm into the parental template at a point downstream of the lesion (7Cox M.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 53-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 8McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 413-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, a number of proteins have been shown to promote the regression of stalled forks, which include the DNA helicase RecG and the recombinase protein RecA (9McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Cell. 2000; 101: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 10Robu M.E. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8211-8218Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These proteins are unrelated functionally, which suggests that multiple mechanisms may exist to promote fork regression that could be utilized under different circumstances of replication fork repair (11Robu M.E. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10973-10981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, the mechanisms for processing stalled forks is less well characterized. Nevertheless, several lines of evidence indicate that fork regression might occur at eukaryotic replication forks (12Sogo J.M. Lopes M. Foiani M. Science. 2002; 297: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 13Zou H. Rothstein R. Cell. 1997; 90: 87-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). However, how the process of fork regression is facilitated in eukaryotes is, as yet, unclear. The Bloom's syndrome (BS) 2The abbreviations used are: BS, Bloom's syndrome; SCE, sister-chromatid exchange; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; nt, nucleotide. helicase, BLM, has been implicated in the repair of damaged replication forks (14Hickson I.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). BLM is a member of the highly conserved RecQ family of DNA helicases. The family is named after the E. coli prototypical member RecQ, and members are defined by the presence of a conserved catalytic helicase domain (15Bachrati C.Z. Hickson I.D. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 577-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Several RecQ helicases also contain additional identifiable motifs, known as the RQC and HRDC domains (15Bachrati C.Z. Hickson I.D. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 577-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The precise function of these domains is unknown, although they have been implicated in the binding of proteins and/or DNA structures (16Bernstein D.A. Keck J.L.

In all organisms, RecQ helicases are essential for the maintenance of genome stability with many RecQ helicase mutants displaying replication defects and elevated levels of recombination events (14Hickson I.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Indeed, one of the defining characteristics of BS cells is an increased frequency of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) (23Chaganti R.S. Schonberg S. German J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4508-4512Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar), which are thought to arise from the aberrant repair of damaged replication forks (14Hickson I.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). The BLM protein has been shown to contain three distinct biochemical activities as follows: a 3′-5′ DNA unwinding activity, a Holliday junction branch migration activity, and a single-stranded DNA annealing activity (24Cheok C.F. Wu L. Garcia P.L. Janscak P. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 3932-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 25Karow J.K. Chakraverty R.K. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30611-30614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 26Karow J.K. Constantinou A. Li J.L. West S.C. Hickson I.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2005; 280: 23397-23407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In what role and in which cellular context these activities function remain to be determined. Given that the process of fork regression involves the annealing of the nascent leading and lagging strands to extrude a fourth arm, which can be extended and thus stabilized by branch migration, one possibility is that the three known catalytic activities of BLM might coordinate to promote fork regression. Here we show that BLM can convert model substrates that mimic stalled replication forks into “chicken foot” structures containing regressed arms that are in excess of several hundred base pairs. Moreover, we show that this ability to regress replication forks is not a general feature of RecQ helicases, suggesting a potentially specific role for BLM in the regression of forks during replication re-start pathways. Proteins—BLM was expressed and purified as described previously (25Karow J.K. Chakraverty R.K. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30611-30614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). RecG, RecQ, and RusA were kind gifts from Drs. Peter McGlynn, James L. Keck, and Robert G.

Fork Regression Assays—The replication fork substrate (10 pm) was incubated with the indicated concentration of BLM, RecG, or RecQ in buffer H (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). Where indicated 1 μl (2-10 units) of wheat germ topoisomerase I was also included in the reactions. Unless otherwise indicated, reactions were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C and then quenched with 10 mm ATPγS and 125 ng of M13 ssDNA prior to the addition of 8 mm MgCl2 and 1 μl (2-20 units depending on the enzyme) of the indicated restriction enzyme. Reactions were incubated for a further 60 min to ensure products were digested to completion, and the reaction products were then separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Gels were dried and exposed to PhosphorImaging screens for quantitative analysis using a Storm scanner and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). RusA Cleavage Assays—The X12 four-way junction substrate, prepared as described previously (28Mohaghegh P. Karow J.K. Brosh Jr., R.M. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D.

Helicase Assays—The splayed arm helicase substrate, prepared as described previously (28Mohaghegh P. Karow J.K. Brosh Jr., R.M. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2843-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), was incubated with either BLM or RecQ, at the indicated concentrations, in buffer H at 37 °C for 30 min. Reaction products were separated on native 10% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were dried and exposed to PhosphorImaging screens for quantitative analysis using a Storm scanner and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Preparation of a Model Stalled Replication Fork—To analyze events that occur during replication fork repair, we developed a strategy for the preparation of structural mimics of a stalled replication fork, as outlined in Fig. 1A. This protocol involves the annealing of a plasmid (pG68-A) to a near identical plasmid (pG46-B5′) via a 68-nt single-stranded gap in pG68-A and a complementary 46-nt, 5′ end-labeled, single-stranded gap in pG46-B5′ (Fig. 1A). The annealing creates a paranemic joint, which can be converted to a plectonemic joint by treatment of the DNA with topoisomerase I. This concomitantly results in the catenation of the two plasmids (Fig. 1A). The resulting joint molecule, termed RF, contains a structural mimic of a replication fork in which the 5′ end of the “lagging strand” is labeled. RF contains a number of features that make it particularly amenable for analyzing the process of replication fork regression. First, the sequences of the arms representing the daughter chromosomes are homologous, allowing fork regression to occur unimpeded by sequence heterology. Second, the absence of free DNA ends, other than those at the fork, eliminates potential artifactual loading sites onto the substrate that would not exist in vivo. Third, the ability to individually alter the length of the single-stranded gaps on each of the constituent plasmids of RF enables analysis of the effect that different configurations of nascent strands at the fork might have on fork regression (see below). Further details of the preparation of RF are contained in supplemental Methods and supplemental Figs. 1-4. Regression of the labeled fork in RF would result in the transfer of restriction endonuclease recognition sites from those arms representing the daughter chromosomes into the regressed arm of the fork (Fig. 1B). Therefore, regression can be assessed by the restriction endonuclease-dependent release of the 5′ label of pG46-B5′ as a linear duplex fragment of a predefined length that is dependent on the particular restriction enzyme used (Fig. 1B). In the nonregressed state, the label in RF remains associated with the joint molecule following digestion. Because of the differentially sized gaps in pG68-A and pG46-B, the labeled fork in substrate RF resembles a stalled replication fork in that there is a single-stranded gap (of 14 nt) on the leading strand template, a situation that would arise following the uncoupling of leading and lagging strand synthesis (Fig. 1, A and B). The 14-nt gap also served to prevent spontaneous fork regression. To confirm this, we generated a related joint molecule, RFII, in which the single-stranded gap on the leading strand template is only 3 nt as opposed to the 14 nt in the RF joint molecule (supplemental Methods and Fig. 1B). Because of the close proximity of the ends of the “nascent” strands at the fork of RFII, these strands would be more likely to anneal and result in spontaneous fork regression. RF and RFII were digested with AvrII to detect the presence of a labeled regressed arm. Digestion of RFII with AvrII released ∼45% of the label as a 36-bp fragment indicating that nearly half of the labeled forks in substrate RFII had undergone spontaneous fork regression (Fig. 1C). In contrast, a similar sized fragment was not released following AvrII digestion of RF (Fig. 1C). This indicates that the 14-nt gap on RF suppresses spontaneous fork regression and that the majority (>90%) of the labeled end in RF is therefore in a fork configuration. Predictably, digestion of RF with either EcoRI or BamHI, whose sites are more distal to the 5′-labeled end of pG46-B5′, also did not release any appreciable amount of label as fragments predicted to arise from digestion of regressed arms (Fig. 1, B and E, lanes 1-4). To confirm that the release of the 36-bp product by AvrII digestion of RFII was because of spontaneous conversion of the labeled fork into a Holliday junction, we treated RFII with the Holliday junction-specific endonuclease, RusA (29Bolt E.L. Lloyd R.G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 187-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To do this, we pre-digested RFII with HindIII, which cuts at a unique site in both circular halves of RFII to generate a labeled replication fork that contains “replicated” arms of ∼2.8 kb (Fig. 1D). This allowed us to analyze specifically the labeled branch structure in RFII, because resolution of the labeled regressed fork by RusA in the HindIII linearized substrate would be expected to release a labeled linear fragment of 2.8 kb (Fig. 1D). As a control we also incubated RusA with a Holliday junction (X12) that was constructed from oligonucleotides and consisted of four 25-bp duplex arms. The junction was mobile because of a 12-bp homologous core, which contained a single CC dinucleotide, the preferred cleavage site for RusA (29Bolt E.L. Lloyd R.G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 187-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As predicted, RusA was found to cleave X12 to completion, whereas ∼45% of RFII was cleaved by RusA to release linearized pG46B5′ (Fig. 1D). This indicated that nearly half of the labeled forks in RFII were in a Holliday junction configuration, a finding consistent with the fraction of label released as the 36-bp fragment following digestion of RFII with AvrII (Fig. 1, C and D). In contrast to RFII/HindIII, <10% of HindIII-digested RF was cleaved by RusA, further confirming that the 14-nt gap on the leading strand in RF suppresses spontaneous fork regression (Fig. 1D). To establish that the labeled fork in RF could be converted to a Holliday junction, we treated RF with RecG, which has a known ability to promote fork regression (9McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Cell. 2000; 101: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). RecG was found to efficiently transfer the labeled end of RF into regressed arms, which could be cut with EcoRI, BamHI, or AvrII to release the labeled linear fragments that were predicted to arise from digestion of the regressed arm (Fig. 1, B and E). Together, these data confirm that >90% of the labeled forks in RF are in a fork configuration and that these forks can be regressed by the fork regression activity of RecG. BLM Can Reverse a Stalled Replication Fork to Generate a Regressed Arm—We next investigated if BLM could regress the labeled fork in RF into a Holliday junction. To do this, BLM was incubated with substrate RF. Reaction products were then digested with AvrII, BamHI, or EcoRI to detect the presence of regressed arms. BLM was found, in a concentration-dependent manner, to convert forks in the RF substrate into Holliday junctions as evidenced by the restriction enzyme-dependent release of labeled fragments whose sizes were identical to those generated by RecG (Fig. 2A and data not shown). The generation of the released linear product was dependent on the presence of ATP, indicating a requirement for the helicase and/or branch migration activity of BLM (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 3 and 4). At the highest concentration of BLM tested, ∼40% of RF molecules contained a regressed arm (Fig. 2A). Given that <10% of the starting substrate RF contained pre-existing Holliday junctions (Fig. 1), we conclude that BLM can generate regressed arms de novo from a replication fork structure. Because the detection of fork regression required the sequential digestion of the BLM-treated substrate with restriction enzymes, it was possible that the linear released product arose as a secondary action of BLM on the linearized substrate by a process unrelated to fork regression. To eliminate this possibility, reactions were quenched by addition of 10 mm ATPγS and 125 ng of M13 single-stranded DNA to competitively inhibit further action of BLM prior to the addition of EcoRI. EcoRI-released products could only be detected if ATPγS and M13 ssDNA were added together with EcoRI (i.e. following BLM incubation) but not if added at the start of the reaction together with BLM (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 2 and 4). This result confirms that ATPγS and M13 ssDNA acted as effective competitive inhibitors of BLM and that the released labeled product arose as a result of EcoRI digestion of BLM-generated products and not the action of BLM on EcoRI-digested pG46-B5′. To further establish that the EcoRI-released product arose as a result of fork regression, the product was confirmed to be double-stranded and to contain the restriction sites for BamHI and AvrII, which are located between the EcoRI site and the 5′ end of the gap in pG46-B5′ (Fig. 1B). Digestion of the EcoRI-released product with either BamHI or AvrII gave rise to labeled products of 61 or 36 bp in length, respectively, consistent with the EcoRI-generated product being double-stranded and arising as a result of fork regression (Fig. 2C, lanes 8-10). BLM Acts Progressively to Generate Regressed Arms >250 bp in Length—Next, we analyzed the extent to which BLM could promote fork regression on RF. Using PvuII, regressed arms of 266 bp could be detected following BLM incubation (Figs. 1B and 3A, lanes 11 and 17). However, few forks regressed far enough to transfer a BsaXI site into the regressed arm, which is 39 bp distal to the PvuII site and would be predicted to release a 305-bp fragment when cut with BsaXI (Figs. 1B and 3A, lanes 12 and 18). Fork regression is predicted to be a progressive process in which the length of the regressed arm would be proportional to protein concentration and/or time. Interestingly, however, although the fraction of molecules that contained regressed forks was proportional to the concentration of BLM, the length of each individual regressed arm was BLM concentration-independent; that is, for any given concentration of BLM, all regressed forks contained a regressed arm of 266-300 bp (Figs. 2A and 3A). This suggests that BLM acts in a processive, and not a distributive, manner to regress stalled replication forks. To confirm that BLM-mediated fork regression is a progressive process, the extent of fork regression was monitored over time using either the BamHI or PvuII sites, which are 205 bp apart in the regressed arm (Fig. 1B). At a fixed concentration of BLM, the restriction site for BamHI was transferred into the regressed arm ∼5 min prior to the more distal site for PvuII (Fig. 3B). This indicates that, as predicted, fork regression catalyzed by BLM is a progressive phenomenon that initiates at the fork. BLM-mediated Fork Regression Occurs Independently of the Generation of DNA Supercoiling—Positive supercoiling can induce spontaneous fork regression in partially replicated plasmids (30Postow L. Ullsperger C. Keller R.W. Bustamante C. Vologodskii A.V. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2790-2796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was possible that BLM does not act directly at the replication fork in substrate RF to promote regression. Rather, because of the circular nature of RF, BLM, through its ability to track along DNA, could induce positive supercoils within the substrate that indirectly cause fork regression. To investigate if supercoiling is required for BLM to promote fork regression, we tested BLM on RF that had been linearized by HindIII to prevent the formation of any DNA supercoiling that might arise because of translocation of BLM along the uncut substrate (Fig. 1D). BLM was found to efficiently regress the labeled fork in RF/HindIII (Fig. 4A). This indicates that any supercoiling that might arise within intact circular RF is not the driving force for BLM-mediated fork regression and that the generation of positive supercoils is therefore not the mechanism by which BLM promotes fork regression. Further confirmation that supercoiling is not required for BLM-mediated fork regression was provided by the fact that the inclusion of wheat germ topoisomerase I, which relaxes both positive and negative supercoils, did not inhibit the ability of BLM to regress forks within RF (Fig. 4B). Fork Regression Activity Is Not a General Feature of RecQ Helicases—BLM can unwind or process a wide variety of branched and non-B-form DNA structures, which are also substrates for certain other helicases (15Bachrati C.Z. Hickson I.D. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 577-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 26Karow J.K. Constantinou A. Li J.L. West S.C. Hickson I.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 27587-27592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Among these is E. coli RecQ, which contains the three functional domains (the helicase, RQC, and HRDC domains), that are found in many RecQ family helicases, including BLM (15Bachrati C.Z. Hickson I.D. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 577-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). RecQ has also been implicated in the unwinding of the lagging strand of stalled replication forks in vivo (32Courcelle J. Hanawalt P.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 33Hishida T. Han Y.W. Shibata T. Kubota Y. Ishino Y. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1886-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, E. coli RecQ was not able to catalyze fork regression on RF at concentrations at which BLM promoted robust fork regression (Fig. 5, C and D, compare lanes 1-4 and 10-12). Moreover, even at vast molar excesses of RecQ (1 μm) over BLM (20 nm), RecQ was still unable to catalyze fork regression (data not shown). Analysis of helicase activity using a conventional splayed armed duplex substrate indicated that, at equimolar concentrations, RecQ had an ∼50-fold higher helicase activity than did BLM (Fig. 5, A and B). To eliminate the possibility that excessive RecQ helicase activity might be inhibitory to fork regression, we used concentrations of RecQ and BLM that gave equivalent helicase activity, as determined by analyses using the splayed arm substrate. At these lower concentrations, RecQ was still unable to catalyze fork regression (Fig. 5, compare lanes 1-4 with lanes 5-9). The disruption of replication forks is a common occurrence in all actively dividing cells, and several pathways have been proposed to explain how replication might be re-initiated from a stalled fork (Fig. 6). Here we have shown that BLM is capable of promoting the regression of model stalled replication forks in vitro. This novel activity of BLM acts directly at the replication fork and regresses the fork in a processive manner for distances of >250 bp. Regression to this extent is consistent with the size of chicken foot structures present in replication intermediates purified from yeast cells exposed to replicative stress (12Sogo J.M. Lopes M. Foiani M. Science. 2002; 297: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 34Lopes M. Foiani M. Sogo J.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 15-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which BLM catalyzes fork regression of RF requires further investigation to determine which of the helicase, branch migration, and strand annealing activities of BLM is required and how they coordinate to facilitate fork regression. A simple model, in which the nascent strands are unwound by the helicase activity of BLM, followed by their subsequent spontaneous annealing to each other, is unlikely, because fork regression could not be induced with E. coli RecQ, which can efficiently unwind lagging strands at replication forks (33Hishida T. Han Y.W. Shibata T. Kubota Y. Ishino Y. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1886-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The inability of RecQ to catalyze fork regression suggests that this activity might be a specific activity of BLM and not an ancestral function of RecQ helicases. The simplest interpretation of the comparison between BLM and RecQ is that the nonconserved regions of BLM are required for promoting fork regression. However, the HRDC domain, which is conserved in BLM, RecQ, and several other RecQ family helicases, has been shown to modulate the structure-specific binding and unwinding activities of the protein in which it resides and has been implicated in functionally distinguishing members of the RecQ helicase family (16Bernstein D.A. Keck J.L. Structure (Camb.). 2005; 13: 1173-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22Wu L. Lung Chan K. Ralf C. Bernstein D.A. Garcia P.L. Bohr V.A. Vindigni A. Janscak P. Keck J.L. Hickson I.D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2679-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Ongoing studies aim to identify which conserved and nonconserved regions of BLM are important for catalyzing fork regression. The cellular diagnostic feature of BS cells is an elevated frequency of SCEs, which are generated by homologous recombination (35Sonoda E. Sasaki M.S. Morrison C. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Takata M. Takeda S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5166-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). One proposed mechanism by which BLM suppresses SCEs is through the dissolution of double Holliday junctions into noncrossover products (36Wu L. Hickson I.D. Nature. 2003; 426: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). BLM-mediated dissolution is dependent on the type IA topoisomerase hTOPO IIIα, which requires a physical interaction with BLM for its correct cellular localization (36Wu L. Hickson I.D. Nature. 2003; 426: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 37Wu L. Davies S.L. North P.S. Goulaouic H. Riou J.F. Turley H. Gatter K.C. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9636-9644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Despite this requirement, a mutant BLM protein that lacks the evolutionarily conserved hTOPO IIIα interaction domain is still able to partially suppress the elevated SCEs seen in BS cells (38Hu P. Beresten S.F. van Brabant A.J. Ye T.Z. Pandolfi P.P. Johnson F.B. Guarente L. Ellis N.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, under some circumstances, BLM and hTOPO IIIα dissociate in response to replicative stress (39Rao V.A. Fan A.M. Meng L. Doe C.F. North P.S. Hickson I.D. Pommier Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8925-8937Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that BLM may function in both hTOPO IIIα-dependent and hTOPO IIIα-independent pathways to prevent SCEs. One possibility is that fork regression by BLM generates the substrates utilized in both of these pathways. Following template switching (Fig. 6, c and d), the regressed fork may be reversed to reset the fork by the branch migration activity of BLM (Fig. 6, d and e), as suggested previously (26Karow J.K. Constantinou A. Li J.L. West S.C. Hickson I.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6504-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the regressed arm may be utilized by the recombination repair machinery to re-initiate replication downstream of the fork arresting lesion, generating a second Holliday junction (Fig. 6, f and g). This is a particularly attractive model because BLM will already be at the site of the stalled fork and will therefore be poised to dissolve the double Holliday junction before other junction resolvases can resolve the Holliday junctions into crossover products giving rise to SCEs (Fig. 6, g and h). The presence of BLM may also prevent resolvases from cleaving the first Holliday junction arising from fork regression and thus generating a double strand break. BLM-mediated fork regression may therefore be important in keeping stalled forks intact. In the absence of BLM, stalled forks may be converted to double strand breaks by endonucleases, such as MUS81, stimulating the inter-sister and inter-homologue recombination seen in BS cells (Fig. 6, i-l) (23Chaganti R.S. Schonberg S. German J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4508-4512Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 40Luo G. Santoro I.M. McDaniel L.D. Nishijima I. Mills M. Youssoufian H. Vogel H. Schultz R.A. Bradley A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In humans, four other RecQ helicases exist in addition to BLM. Where studied, the phenotypes of metazoan RecQ helicase mutants indicate both overlapping and nonredundant roles for RecQ helicases (41Hu Y. Lu X. Barnes E. Yan M. Lou H. Luo G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3431-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 42Wang W. Seki M. Narita Y. Nakagawa T. Yoshimura A. Otsuki M. Kawabe Y. Tada S. Yagi H. Ishii Y. Enomoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3527-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In common with BS cells, elevated SCEs are also a feature of RECQ5β deficiency in mouse and chicken cells (41Hu Y. Lu X. Barnes E. Yan M. Lou H. Luo G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3431-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 42Wang W. Seki M. Narita Y. Nakagawa T. Yoshimura A. Otsuki M. Kawabe Y. Tada S. Yagi H. Ishii Y. Enomoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3527-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Therefore, although fork regression might be an activity specific for BLM, it remains to be determined whether other human RecQ helicases could also promote fork regression that might act in either partially redundant or parallel pathways to BLM to prevent SCEs.

We found that the intermembrane space domain of Tim50 induced the Tim23 channel to close. Presequences overcame this effect and activated the channel for translocation.

Skeletal muscle homogenates also contain all of the NOX2 protein components and display an activity that generates superoxide anion at the expense of NADH oxidation (30Javesghani D. Magder S.A. Barreiro E. Quinn M.T. Hussain S.N. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 165: 412-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In addition, human skeletal muscle tissue exhibits transcripts for the NOX2 and NOX4 isoforms (31Cheng G. Cao Z. Xu X. van Meir E.G. Lambeth J.D. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 269: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). All of these findings provide experimental support to earlier proposals suggesting the presence of NOX in skeletal muscle cells (32Brotto M.A. Nosek T.M. J. Appl. Physiol. 1996; 81: 731-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 33Reid M.B. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 90: 724-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We have found recently that tetanic field stimulation of rat skeletal muscle cells in primary culture increases NOX-dependent ROS production and elicits ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ signals that are significantly decreased by NOX inhibitors. 4Espinosa, A., Leiva, A., Peña, A., Müller, A., Debandi, A., Hidalgo, C., Carrasco, M. A., and Jaimovich, E. (2006) J. Cell Physiol., in press.4Espinosa, A., Leiva, A., Peña, A., Müller, A., Debandi, A., Hidalgo, C., Carrasco, M. A., and Jaimovich, E. (2006) J. Cell Physiol., in press. These results suggest a role for activity-dependent NOX as a source of RyR-modifying ROS in skeletal muscle. In this work, we investigated the membrane origin of the skeletal muscle NOX and the effects of NOX-generated ROS on RyR1 activity and RyR1 S-glutathionylation levels. For these experiments, we used either intact fibers isolated from adult mouse skeletal muscle or three different membrane fractions isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle: transverse tubules (T-tubules), triads (which contain 10-15% T-tubules attached to junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles), and junctional (heavy) SR vesicles devoid of T-tubules but enriched in RyR1 channels. Immunohistochemistry with specific antibodies showed that the NOX membrane gp91phox subunit and the cytoplasmic p47phox regulatory subunit co-localized with the α1s subunit of dihydropyridine receptors (DHPR) in T-tubules of adult mice fibers. Western blot analysis showed that the NOX integral membrane components gp91phox and p22phox were markedly enriched in T-tubules and also present in triads but were absent from heavy SR vesicles. Triads displayed NADPH-dependent generation of superoxide anion and H2O2 that was significantly decreased by NOX inhibitors. In addition to promoting NOX activity, NADPH enhanced significantly RyR1 S-glutathionylation and increased RyR1 activity. Possible physiological consequences of these findings, in terms of potential cross-talk between redox and calcium signaling cascades that may lead to enhanced Ca2+ release in skeletal muscle, are discussed. Materials—All reagents used were of analytical grade. Ryanodine, bovine serum albumin, bovine liver catalase, β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors (leupeptin, pepstatin A, benzamidine, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were from Sigma. Bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD), rotenone, NADH, NADPH, lucigenin, 2,4-dithiothreitol, diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic) acid, and NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester were from Calbiochem. [3H]Ryanodine was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, apocynin was from Aldrich, and 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydrophenoxazine (Amplex Red reagent) was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were from Bio-Rad. Antibodies—The mouse monoclonal anti-gp91phox, anti-p22phox, anti-p47phox, and anti-p67phox antibodies used for Western blot assays were a kind gift from Dr. Mark T. Quinn (Veterinary Molecular Biology, Montana State University, Bozeman, MT); these antibodies were raised as described previously (34Burritt J.B. Quinn M.T. Jutila M.A. Bond C.W. Jesaitis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16974-16980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The goat polyclonal anti-gp91phox and anti-p47phox antibodies used for immunohistochemical experiments, as well as the antibodies against RyR or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG (anti-mouse or anti-rabbit) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-glutathione (anti-GSH) antibody was from Virogen (Watertown, MA). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against the α1s subunit of DHPR were from Affinity BioReagents (Golden, CO), and Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes. Fiber Isolation and Immunohistochemistry—Adult AJ mice were anesthetized with ketamine, following a procedure approved by the local animal ethics committee. The flexor digitorum longus or tibialis anterioris muscles were dissected out, placed in Krebs solution (135 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 11.5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 11.5 mm glucose) and immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (134 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 17 mm Na2HPO4, 2.3 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) for 30 min at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, muscle fibers were obtained by gentle mechanical dissociation with a surgical tool. Isolated fibers were permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 added to PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) to block nonspecific binding sites. After a 10-h incubation, the Triton X-100 solution was replaced by PBS plus 1% BSA; antibodies against gp91phox, p47phox, or the α1s subunit of DHPR were added at a 1:100 dilution; and the fibers were incubated for 10 h at room temperature. Fibers were washed three times with PBS plus 1% BSA and were incubated for 1 h with Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies (1:500). After five washes with PBS plus 1% BSA, fibers were placed on glass coverslips to record fluorescent images in an inverted confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss LSM 5 Pascal, Oberkochen, Germany). Fluorescent images were analyzed with the Image J 1.32j software; the percentage of colocalization was estimated using the colocalization finder plugin, version 1.1. Control experiments with the secondary antibodies did not show detectable fluorescence. Membrane Isolation—Membrane preparations from rabbit fast skeletal muscle were isolated as described previously (35Hidalgo C. González M.E. Lagos R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 259: 13937-13945Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 36Hidalgo C. Jorquera J. Tapia V. Donoso P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15111-15117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Triad-enriched SR vesicles isolated from rabbit muscle (hereafter referred to as triads) contain 10-15% attached T-tubules, as evidenced by their density of [3H]ouabain binding sites. Membrane fractions were stored in liquid nitrogen and were used within 3 days; longer storage resulted in significant deterioration of NOX activity. Protein was determined (37Hartree E.F. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 48: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (4493) Google Scholar) using commercial BSA as a standard. Western Blotting—Triad vesicles (10 μg) were incubated in nonreducing loading buffer (6 m urea, 1% SDS, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 50 mm NaH2PO4, 17mm Na2HPO4) plus 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide at 60 °C for 20 min. Proteins were separated in 3.5-8% gradient gels by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, as described elsewhere (38Aracena P. Sanchez G. Donoso P. Hamilton S.L. Hidalgo C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42927-42935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For RyR1 detection, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes at 350 mA for 3 h at 4°C; for smaller molecular weight proteins, the transfer times were only 1 h under the same conditions. Membranes were blocked with 5% BSA in Tris-saline buffer (140 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6) plus 0.2% Tween 20 and were probed with specific antibodies directed to RyR, GSH, gp91phox, p22phox, p47phox, or p67phox. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG was used as secondary antibody. Blots were developed using an ECL kit (Pierce). Membranes were stripped between blots by 30-min incubation at 50 °C with a solution containing 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7. Determination of NADPH Oxidase Activity—To determine NOX activity, we measured the oxidation of both NADH and NADPH as well as the generation of superoxide anion and H2O2. Oxidation of NADH or NADPH by triads (0.1 mg/ml) was monitored at 340 nm (ϵ = 6,250 m-1 cm-1) in a Hewlett-Packard ChemStation UV-visible spectrophotometer (Waldbronn, Germany). Superoxide generation was measured by the lucigenin-derived chemiluminiscence method in a Berthold FB 12 luminometer; SR vesicles (0.2 mg/ml) were incubated at 25 °C with 100 mm MOPS-Tris, pH 7.0, 5 μm lucigenin, and variable concentrations of NADPH, as specified in each case. Chemiluminiscence was expressed as nmol of superoxide ion generated/mg of protein/min; calibration was done using hypoxanthine and xanthine oxidase as described (30Javesghani D. Magder S.A. Barreiro E. Quinn M.T. Hussain S.N. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 165: 412-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Hydrogen peroxide generation was measured at 37 °C or at 25 °C in a FluoroMax 2 spectrofluorotometer (ISA Jobinybon-Spex) with λex = 527 nm, λem = 583 nm, using Amplex Red as described (39Zhou M. Diwu Z. Panchuk-Voloshina N. Haugland R.P. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 253: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). The effects of DPI (10 μm), apocynin (4 mm), rotenone (200 nm), NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (2 mm), and SOD (300 units/ml) on superoxide anion or H2O2 generation were also tested, as indicated in each case. Nonenzymatic controls were performed using vesicles heat-denatured for 10 min at 100 °C; this procedure essentially abolished H2O2 generation and reduced by >90% NADH/NADPH oxidation and superoxide anion generation. To calculate specific activities, the activity displayed by heat-denatured vesicles was subtracted from the total activity. Detection of Endogenous or NADPH-promoted RyR1 S-Glutathionylation—To detect endogenous RyR1 S-glutathionylation, triad vesicles (10 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions as described above. After electrophoresis and transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, proteins were probed with anti-GSH antibody (1:10,000). Following ECL detection of the antigen-antibody reaction, membranes were stripped and probed with anti-RyR antibody. Blots were quantified by densitometric analysis (Quantity One software; Bio-Rad). Results were expressed as the ratio of anti-GSH/anti-RyR band densities. To detect NADPH-promoted S-glutathionylation, triad vesicles (1 mg/ml) were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min in a solution containing 0.1-0.5 mm NADPH, 100 mm MOPS-Tris, pH 7.0. The effect of apocynin (8 mm) was tested in some experiments. Labeling of Triad Proteins with [35S]GSH—Vesicles were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in a solution containing 100 mm MOPS-Tris, pH 7.2, 0.1 mm NADPH plus [35S]GSH added as tracer. The reaction was terminated by the addition of nonreducing sample buffer plus 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide. Triad proteins (10 μg) were separated in 3.5-8% nonreducing gels as above. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, and the 35S radioactivity incorporated into RyR1 was determined in a Molecular Imager FX system (Bio-Rad) using a CP Phosphor Screen (Eastman Kodak Co.) essentially as reported earlier (38Aracena P. Sanchez G. Donoso P. Hamilton S.L. Hidalgo C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42927-42935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Titration of Total Sulfhydryl Content—Triads were incubated at 0.1 mg/ml at 37 °C for 10 min with or without 0.1 mm NADH; samples were taken at different times to determine their total sulfhydryl content. For this purpose, triads were incubated for an additional 30-min period at 25 °C with 0.1 mm 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic) acid in 50 mm Tris-base (40Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (20884) Google Scholar). Alternatively, triads (0.1 mg/ml) were incubated with 100 μm H2O2 for 10 min at 37 °C prior to sulfhydryl titration as above. The effects of apocynin (2 mm) or catalase (300 units/ml) were tested in some experiments. Detection of NADPH-dependent S-S Cross-link Formation between RyR1 Subunits—Triads were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with 0.1 mm NADPH or with 0.25 mm diamide. To analyze RyR cross-linked products, the procedure described in detail elsewhere (41Aghdasi B. Zhang J.Z. Wu Y. Reid M.B. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3739-3748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) was followed without substantial modifications. [3H]Ryanodine Binding—To measure initial rates of [3H]ryanodine binding, triads (0.2 mg/ml) were incubated at pCa 5 under high ionic strength conditions (500 mm KCl, 20 mm MOPS-Tris, pH 7.2). Total binding, determined in the presence of 5 nm [3H]ryanodine, was measured at 37 °C for 10 min, taking samples at 5-, 7-, and 10-min intervals; nonspecific binding was determined in the additional presence of 10 μm ryanodine. To test the effects of NADH, NADPH, GSH, or DPI, vesicles were preincubated with these reagents for 2 min at 25 °C. The effects of SOD plus catalase or of H2O2 were tested in some experiments. Calcium Release Kinetics—Calcium release kinetics was determined as described in detail elsewhere (38Aracena P. Sanchez G. Donoso P. Hamilton S.L. Hidalgo C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42927-42935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, triads were actively loaded with calcium by incubation for 10 min at 25 °C in a solution containing 100 mm KCl, 2 mm ATP (sodium salt), 3 mm MgCl2, 20 mm MOPS/Tris, pH 7.20, 10 mm phosphocreatine, and 15 units/ml creatine kinase. Vesicles were then mixed (1:10) in a stopped flow fluorescence spectrophotometer with a releasing solution containing 100 mm KCl, 7 mm ATP-Na, 5.56 mm MgCl2, 0.165 mm CaCl2, 20 mm MOPS/Tris, pH 7.20, plus 1 μm Calcium Green-5N. Upon mixing, free concentrations were 1.4 mm ATP, 0.348 mm Mg2+, and 0.019 mm Ca2+ (pCa 4.7). To test the effects of NADPH, GSH, or DPI on calcium release kinetics, vesicles were incubated with these reagents for 10 min at 25 °C during active loading as above. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. of at least three independent determinations. For statistical comparisons, depending on the number of determinations, an analysis of variance test was performed either with Dunnett post-test analysis using the GraphPad® Prism software or the Holm-t test using the Primer of Bioestatistics software. Values were considered significantly different if p was <0.05. Occurrence of NADPH Oxidase Subunits in Transverse Tubules of Mouse Skeletal Muscle Fibers—Rat skeletal muscle contains mRNA and proteins for the NOX gp91phox, p22phox, p47phox, and p67phox subunits localized in close proximity to the sarcolemma, albeit their precise membrane location was not specified (30Javesghani D. Magder S.A. Barreiro E. Quinn M.T. Hussain S.N. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 165: 412-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Our earlier observations 5J. L. Fernandez and C. Hidalgo, unpublished observations. indicating that isolated T-tubules but not SR vesicles oxidized NADH at high rates suggested a T-tubular location for this NADH oxidase activity. In this work, we detected the presence of the NOX subunits gp91phox and p47phox in skeletal muscle fibers from adult mice (Fig. 1). Over 95% colocalization of these two NOX subunits with the α1S DHPR subunit was found in confocal serial images, strongly suggesting that the skeletal muscle NOX is localized in the T-tubule system. Presence of NOX Protein Subunits in Isolated Triads and T-tubule Vesicles—Western blot analysis of isolated triads, T-tubules, and heavy SR vesicles revealed that antibodies against the NOX integral membrane subunit gp91phox or p22phox recognized protein bands in triads but not in heavy SR vesicles; these two protein bands were markedly enriched in isolated T-tubules (Fig. 2). The enrichment in gp91phox and p22phox in T-tubules relative to triads was consistently observed in all preparations studied. Antibodies against the NOX cytosolic components p47phox and p67phox also recognized protein bands in T-tubules and triads but not in heavy SR vesicles (Fig. 2). In contrast to the bands recognized by antibodies against gp91phox and p22phox, these two regulatory components were not enriched in the isolated T-tubule preparation illustrated in Fig. 2. Furthermore, some isolated T-tubule preparations had somewhat lower p47phox and p67phox contents than triads, suggesting that these regulatory subunits were lost to varying degrees during T-tubule isolation. This finding may explain why our attempts to measure NADH/NADPH oxidation and the coupled ROS generation by isolated T-tubule vesicles yielded variable results (see below). The presence of the two NOX integral subunits gp91phox and p22phox in triads but not in heavy SR vesicles plus their marked enrichment in T-tubules reinforce the proposal that the skeletal NOX enzyme is a T-tubule enzyme. NADPH Oxidase Activity in Triads—As described below, isolated triad vesicles, which are composed by junctional T-tubule and SR membranes, contain a NOX activity that can oxidize both NADH- and NADPH-generating superoxide anion and H2O2. Isolated triads have the capacity to promote significant oxidation of 0.1 mm NADPH or NADH, as illustrated in Fig. 3A. On average, at 37 °C, triads oxidized NADPH at a rate of 25.1 ± 1.4 nmol/mg/min (n = 3) and NADH at a rate of 20.5 ± 1.3 nmol/mg/min (n = 7). Lowering the reaction temperature to 25 °C decreased NADPH oxidation to 14 ± 1.2 nmol/mg/min (n = 3). The addition to triads of increasing NADPH concentrations, from 100 μm to1mm, immediately elicited superoxide anion generation; at 25 °C, the reaction followed a linear time course for up to 20 min (Fig. 3B, left), and at 100 μm NADPH, the average rate was 2.01 ± 0.12 nmol/mg/min (n = 10). Increasing [NADPH] to 1 mm produced a hyperbolic increase in the rate of superoxide anion generation, with an apparent Km of 204 ± 49 μm and a Vmax of 6.25 ± 0.06 nmol/mg/min. The addition of 10 μm DPI or SOD (300 units/ml) inhibited markedly the rate of superoxide anion generation induced by 100 μm NADPH; 4 mm apocynin exerted a less pronounced inhibitory effect, whereas rotenone (200 nm) had no effect (Fig. 3B, right). Preincubation with 2 mm NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, a nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor, did not produce detectable effects on superoxide anion generation (data not shown). These results make unlikely mitochondrial contribution or nitric-oxide synthase as sources of superoxide anion. The addition of 0.1 mm NADPH or NADH to triad vesicles induced H2O2 generation after a short delay (Fig. 4A, left). The average H2O2-generating activities at 37 °C (calculated from the linear part of the curves) were 3.3 ± 0.6 (n = 4) and 3.6 ± 0.4 (n = 6) (in nmol/mg/min) for triads incubated with 0.1 mm NADPH or NADH, respectively (Fig. 4A, right). At 25 °C, triads incubated with 0.1 mm NADPH generated 1.18 nmol of H"

Interactions of eIF4G with eIF4E, eIF4A, eIF3, poly(A)-binding protein, and Mnk1/2 have been mapped to discrete domains on eIF4G, and conversely, the eIF4G-binding sites on all but one of these ligands have been determined.

However, binding of partially proteolyzed HeLa eIF3 to the eIF3-binding domain of human eIF4G-1, followed by high throughput analysis of mass spectrometric data with a novel peptide matching algorithm, identified a single subunit, eIF3e (p48/Int-6).

Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 33-88Google Scholar). The factors required for recruitment of mRNA include eIF3, eIF4A, eIF4B, eIF4E, eIF4G, eIF4H, and PABP. eIF4E and PABP bind the 5′ cap and 3′ poly(A) tract of mRNA, respectively, whereas eIF4A unwinds 5′-terminal secondary structure in an ATP-dependent process that also involves the RNA-binding proteins eIF4B and eIF4H. eIF4G forms specific complexes with eIF4E, eIF4A, and PABP, thereby linking the processes of cap recognition, poly(A) binding, and secondary structure melting. eIF4G in turn is recruited to the 40 S ribosomal subunit via binding to the multisubunit complex eIF3. eIF3 in mammals is the largest initiation factor (∼800 kDa) and includes 13 nonidentical polypeptides designated eIF3a-m 3A unified nomenclature system for eIF3 subunits assigns the same letter to homologous subunits across all eukaryotic organisms (2Browning K.S.

Five of these (eIF3a, -b, -c, -g, and -i) are conserved in all eukaryotes and are considered to be the “conserved core” of eIF3 (2Browning K.S. Gallie D.R. Hershey J.W. Hinnebusch A.G. Maitra U.

Most of the eight mammalian “non-core” subunits are found in other higher eukaryotes, Schizosaccharomyces pombe lacking only eIF3j, -k, and -l; Triticum aesitivum lacking eIF3j, -l, and -m; Arabidopsis thaliana lacking eIF3j and -m; and Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans lacking eIF3m (4Zhou C.

Biol. 2006; 26: 2984-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although the subunit compositions of S. cerevisiae and mammalian eIF3 are different, the functions of the core subunits appear to be the same, as suggested by the observation that the S. cerevisiae conserved core can substitute for mammalian eIF3 in an assay for Met-puromycin synthesis containing all other eIFs of mammalian origin (6Phan L.

Biol. 1998; 18: 4935-4946Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). eIF3 is required for both 43 S and 48 S initiation complex formation and is also involved in dissociation of 80 S complexes and anti-association of 40 S and 60 S subunits (1Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 33-88Google Scholar). The 43 S complex consists of eIF3, eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAi, eIF5, eIF1, eIF1A, and the 40 S ribosomal subunit (1Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 33-88Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, a multifactor complex has been identified consisting of eIF3, eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAi, eIF5, and eIF1 (14Asano K. Clayton J. Shalev A. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2534-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). eIF3 stabilizes this complex through direct interactions with eIF1, eIF2, eIF5, and the 40 S ribosomal subunit (15Valasek L. Nielsen K.H. Zhang F. Fekete C.A. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9437-9455Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Most of these interactions have been mapped to individual eIF3 subunits. For example, eIF3a and eIF3c bind to eIF1 (14Asano K. Clayton J. Shalev A. Hinnebusch A.G.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5886-5898Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). eIF3 also binds eIF1A (17Olsen D.S. Savner E.M. Mathew A. Zhang F. Krishnamoorthy T. Phan L. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), although the subunit that mediates this interaction has not been reported. In mammals, eIF3 binds eIF1 (through eIF3c) (18Fletcher C.M. Pestova T.V. Hellen C.U. Wagner G.

Jivotovskaya A. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2984-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Finally, eIF3a in mammals (20Methot N. Song M.S. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5328-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and eIF3g in plants (21Park H.S. Browning K.S. Hohn T. Ryabova L.A.

Mammalian eIF3 participates in assembly of the 48 S complex through high affinity binding to eIF4G (23Korneeva N.L. Lamphear B.J. Hennigan F.L.C. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41369-41376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This may not be the case for S. cerevisiae, where a requirement for eIF4G in mRNA recruitment to the 43 S complex has not been demonstrated (24Jivotovskaya A.V. Valasek L. Hinnebusch A.G. Nielsen K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1355-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), correlating with the lack of an observed eIF3-eIF4G interaction in this organism. Binding of eIF4G to eIF3 in mammals is regulated by insulin via association of mTOR with eIF3, specifically eIF3f (25Holz M.K. Ballif B.A. Gygi S.P. Blenis J.

Sachs A.B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3153-3163Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The only eIF4G ligand for which this has not been determined is eIF3. However, the recently solved cryo-EM structure of an eIF4G·eIF3·40 S complex suggests a small surface contact between eIF4G and eIF3 (39Siridechadilok B. Fraser C.S. Hall R.J. Doudna J.A. Nogales E. Science. 2005; 310: 1513-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), likely composed of one or a few eIF3 subunits. The interaction between eIF3 and eIF4G is critical because it is essential for bringing mRNA and all of the proteins bound to eIF4G to the 43 S initiation complex. In this study, we have sought to identify the mammalian eIF3 subunit(s) that directly interact with eIF4G. Binding of peptides from partially proteolyzed eIF3 suggests one subunit, eIF3e, is more involved than the other 12. Adding FLAG-tagged eIF3e to a cell-free translation system decreases the overall rate of protein synthesis and polysome accumulation. FLAG-eIF3e inhibits eIF4G-dependent translation significantly more than eIF4G-independent (IRES-driven) translation. Finally, FLAG-eIF3e causes a dramatic reduction in the amount of eIF4G and eIF2 associated with complexes sedimenting at ∼40 S. These functional activities would be expected for an eIF3 subunit involved in eIF4G binding.

S-eIF4G(1015-1118) was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) and purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose chromatography. One-liter cultures were grown at 37 °C to A600 0.4-0.6, and expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside for 3.5 h. Cell pellets were harvested and stored at −80 °C. Thawed cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer containing Complete Mini EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science) and disrupted by sonication. Cleared extracts were incubated in batch with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (1 ml packed) with rotation for 2 h at 4°C. Bound material was washed five times batchwise with 20 ml of Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.6) and twice with 20 ml of Buffer B (same as Buffer A except 500 mm KCl), after which the resin was equilibrated in 10 ml of Buffer C (same as Buffer A except 100 mm KCl) and loaded into a gravity flow column for elution. S-eIF4G(1015-1118) was eluted with 5 ml of Buffer D (same as Buffer C except 300 mm imidazole), and 1-ml fractions were collected.

Sf9 cells from frozen stocks were grown in 250-ml sterile flasks at 27 °C and 135 rpm in Sf-900 II SFM media in a New Brunswick Scientific Innova® 44 orbital shaker. For expression of recombinant proteins, cells were expanded to ∼2 × 106 cells/ml in 50 ml of Sf-900 II SFM media prior to infection with recombinant baculoviruses expressing FLAG-eIF3e, FLAG-eIF3i, or FLAG-eIF3j. Cells were harvested after 72 h by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min followed by a single wash with 1× phosphate-buffered saline. A single cell pellet from each 50-ml culture was stored at −80 °C.

The mRNAs generated from these four templates are referred to as m7G-CycB2-HCV-NS′, m7G-CycB2-CSFV-NS′, m7G-Luc-A31, and m7G-Luc-A60, respectively. 32P-Labeled nucleotides were included when the pluc-A60 template was used to make 32P-labeled mRNA for measurement of polysomal distribution. Following incubation for 45 min at 37 °C, fresh T7 RNA polymerase was added, and the reaction was continued for an additional 45 min at 37 °C. DNA was digested by addition of 3.0 units of RQ1 RNase-Free DNase followed by incubation for 10 min at 65 °C. mRNA was then purified using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). mRNA concentration and purity were assessed by absorbance at 260 and 280 nm. In Vitro Translation—All in vitro translation reactions were performed at 30 °C with a micrococcal nuclease-treated RRL system (45Cai A. Jankowska-Anyszka M. Centers A. Chlebicka L. Stepinski J.

For measurement of translational inhibition utilizing the luciferase assay, m7G-Luc-A60 and nonradioactive amino acids were used. For measurement of translational inhibition utilizing m7G-CycB2-HCV-NS′ or m7G-CycB2-CSFV-NS′ bicistronic mRNAs, nonradioactive Met was omitted and [35S]Met was included at 0.5 μCi/μl. For time course measurements, reactions contained m7G-Luc-A31 and [35S]Met at 0.2 μCi/μl. When inhibition of protein synthesis was measured, FLAG-tagged eIF3 subunits and nonradiolabeled mRNA were added simultaneously. When polysomal distribution of mRNA was determined, reaction mixtures containing nonradiolabeled amino acids were preincubated with FLAG-tagged eIF3 subunits for 15 min at 30 °C prior to addition of 32P-labeled m7G-Luc-A60. In all reaction mixtures, the volume of added Buffer G (except lacking FLAG peptide) was kept constant. For measurement of luciferase synthesis in the presence of FLAG-eIF3e, luciferase assays were performed using beetle luciferin following the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). For inhibition of bicistronic mRNA translation, 2 μl of each reaction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 15% gels followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Newly synthesized protein was detected by exposure of each dried gel to a PhosphorScreen for 2 h and scanning with a STORM 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Cyclin B2 (∼50 kDa) and NS′ (∼20 kDa) were quantitated with ImageQuant software, version 5.0 (Amersham Biosciences). Curves were fit, as if for competitive inhibition of an enzymatic reaction, with Kaleidagraph software (version 3.5; Synergy Software, Reading, PA) using the equation y = m1/(1 + M0/m2), where y = synthesis of cyclin B2, NS′, or luciferase in the presence of a FLAG-tagged eIF3 subunit; m1 = cyclin B2, NS′, or luciferase synthesized in the absence of the eIF3 subunit; M0 = concentration of the eIF3 subunit in μm, and m2 = the inhibition constant (KI). For time course measurements of inhibition of m7G-Luc-A31 mRNA translation, 10-μl aliquots of each reaction were removed at the indicated times and diluted 1:10 in 10 μg/ml BSA, 10 mm Met, and 10 μm cycloheximide on ice. Aliquots of 5 μl were spotted on Whatman 540 filter disks, and total trichloroacetic acid-precipitatable 35S radioactivity was measured by scintillation spectrometry.

Partial measurement, where full wavefunction collapse is not the only outcome, provides a detailed test of the measurement process. We introduce quantum-state tomography in a superconducting qubit that exhibits high-fidelity single-shot measurement. For the two probabilistic outcomes of partial measurement, we find either a full collapse or a coherent yet nonunitary evolution of the state. This latter behavior explicitly confirms modern quantum-measurement theory and may prove important for error-correction algorithms in quantum computation."
https://openalex.org/W2078631770,The links between the cell cycle machinery and the cytoskeletal proteins controlling cytokinesis are poorly understood. The small guanine nucleotide triphosphate (GTP)–binding protein RhoA stimulates type II myosin contractility and formin-dependent assembly of the cytokinetic actin contractile ring. We found that budding yeast Polo-like kinase Cdc5 controls the targeting and activation of Rho1 (RhoA) at the division site via Rho1 guanine nucleotide exchange factors. This role of Cdc5 (Polo-like kinase) in regulating Rho1 is likely to be relevant to cytokinesis and asymmetric cell division in other organisms.

https://openalex.org/W2005060302,"In Bacillus subtilis most peroxide-inducible oxidative stress genes are regulated by a metal-dependent repressor, PerR. PerR is a dimeric, Zn2+-containing metalloprotein with a regulatory metal-binding site that binds Fe2+ (PerR:Zn,Fe) or Mn2+ (PerR: Zn,Mn). Reaction of PerR:Zn,Fe with low levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) leads to oxidation of two His residues thereby leading to derepression. When bound to Mn2+, the resulting PerR:Zn,Mn is much less sensitive to oxidative inactivation. Here we demonstrate that the structural Zn2+ is coordinated in a highly stable, intrasubunit Cys4:Zn2+ site. Oxidation of this Cys4:Zn2+ site by H2O2 leads to the formation of intrasubunit disulfide bonds. The rate of oxidation is too slow to account for induction of the peroxide stress response by micromolar levels of H2O2 but could contribute to induction under severe oxidative stress conditions. In vivo studies demonstrated that inactivation of PerR:Zn,Mn required 10 mm H2O2, a level at least 1000 times greater than that needed for inactivation of PerR:Zn,Fe. Surprisingly even under these severe oxidation conditions there was little if any detectable oxidation of cysteine residues in vivo: derepression was correlated with oxidation of the regulatory site. Because oxidation at this site required bound Fe2+ in vitro, we suggest that treatment of cells with 10 mm H2O2 released sufficient Fe2+ into the cytosol to effect a transition of PerR from the PerR:Zn,Mn form to the peroxide-sensitive PerR: Zn,Fe form.

This model is supported by metal ion affinity measurements demonstrating that PerR bound Fe2+ with higher affinity than Mn2+. Bacillus subtilis PerR is a metal-dependent repressor that regulates the peroxide-inducible expression of oxidative stress genes. The PerR regulon includes the major vegetative catalase (KatA), alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (AhpCF), enzymes of heme biosynthesis (HemAXCDBL), a zinc uptake P-type ATPase (ZosA), a Dps-like protein (MrgA), and both the PerR and Fur metalloregulatory proteins. Expression of these genes is elevated in a perR null mutant, and PerR binds directly to operator sites overlapping the promoters for these operons, establishing PerR as a direct repressor of transcription (1Herbig A.F. Helmann J.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 2Fuangthong M. Herbig A.F. Bsat N. Helmann J.D. J.

Microbiol. 1998; 29: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). PerR is a member of the Fur family of metal-dependent regulators, and many Fur family proteins contain one Zn2+ ion per monomer in addition to a regulatory metal ion. The x-ray absorption spectroscopy of Escherichia coli Fur (FurEC) revealed Zn2+ bound in a tetrahedral environment composed of two S and two N/O donor ligands (4Jacquamet L. Aberdam D. Adrait A. Hazemann J.L. Latour J.M. Michaud-Soret I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2564-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies using chemical modification and mass spectroscopy assigned Cys92 and Cys95 as Zn2+ ligands (5Gonzalez de Peredo A. Saint-Pierre C. Adrait A. Jacquamet L. Latour J.M. Michaud-Soret I. Forest E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8582-8589Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), a conclusion supported by site-directed mutagenesis studies (6Coy M. Doyle C. Besser J. Neilands J.B. Biometals. 1994; 7: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To date, the only structure available for a protein from the Fur superfamily is Pseudomonas aeruginosa Fur (FurPA) that was crystallized in the presence of Zn2+ (7Pohl E. Haller J.C. Mijovilovich A. Meyer-Klaucke W. Garman E. Vasil M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 903-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). FurPA contains two metal-binding sites assigned as a high affinity Zn2+-binding site and low affinity Fe2+-binding site, respectively, by accompanying spectroscopy. No cysteine residues were involved in metal coordination in FurPA, and there is still considerable uncertainty surrounding the functional role of the metal-binding sites. For example, multiple mutants in the corresponding residues in Bradyrhizobium japonicum Fur failed to abrogate metal sensing (8Friedman Y.E. O'Brian M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32100-32105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Moreover putative Zn2+ ligands in FurPA correspond to residues in PerR required for binding the regulatory metal ion (Fe2+ or Mn2+) but not the structurally important Zn2+ (9Lee J.W. Helmann J.D. Nature. 2006; 440: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Most PerR-regulated genes are derepressed when cells are exposed to low levels of H2O2 (<10 μm), by limitation for metal ions or by transition into stationary phase during aerobic growth, which leads to an increase in the endogenous production of H2O2 (2Fuangthong M. Herbig A.F. Bsat N. Helmann J.D. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3276-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 10Helmann J.D. Wu M.F. Gaballa A. Kobel P.A. Morshedi M.M. Fawcett P. Paddon C. J.

Physiological studies have revealed that PerR-regulated genes are strongly repressed in medium supplemented with manganese (and lacking added iron) and that, under these growth conditions, the ability of H2O2 to induce expression is greatly reduced. In contrast, in iron-containing growth medium PerR repression is rapidly relieved upon exposure to H2O2 (2Fuangthong M. Herbig A.F. Bsat N. Helmann J.D. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3276-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These results led to a model in which PerR could bind either Mn2+ or Fe2+ as corepressor to generate two forms of PerR that differ in their sensitivity to reactive oxygen species. Biochemical analyses of the reconstituted PerR:Zn,Fe and PerR:Zn,Mn forms of the repressor provide an explanation for this difference: the high sensitivity of PerR:Zn,Fe results from the regio-specific oxidation of two His residues directly coordinated to the activating ferrous ion (9Lee J.W. Helmann J.D. Nature. 2006; 440: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Thus, in contrast with most peroxide sensors characterized to date (12Kiley P.J. Storz G. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e400Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 13Green J. Paget M.S. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 954-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 14Paget M.S. Buttner M.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2003; 37: 91-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), PerR does not appear to use thiol disulfide chemistry to sense oxidative stress despite the presence of four conserved cysteine residues in the protein sequence. Previous results from homology modeling of PerR on the FurPA structure, combined with site-directed mutagenesis, support a model in which these four residues form a high affinity Cys4:Zn2+ structural site (9Lee J.W. Helmann J.D. Nature. 2006; 440: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Although the Cys4:Zn2+ site is not involved in sensing low levels of peroxides, this does not rule out a possible role under conditions of severe oxidative stress. Indeed it has been previously proposed that other PerR homologs sense H2O2 by Cys-based redox reactions as inferred from studies done with 5–10 mm H2O2 (15Ortiz de Orue Lucana D. Schrempf H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 264: 341-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 16Hahn J.S. Oh S.Y. Chater K.F. Cho Y.H. Roe J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38254-38260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Analysis of E. coli HSP33 indicates that cells may contain systems that respond specifically to severe oxidative stress conditions. HSP33 is a redox-regulated protein chaperone that contains a Cys4:Zn2+ site that is only oxidized in the presence of high levels of peroxides (e.g. 4 mm H2O2) and elevated temperatures (e.g. 43 °C) (17Jakob U. Muse W. Eser M. Bardwell J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated oxidation of the Cys4:Zn2+ site and its possible role in peroxide sensing in vivo. By monitoring Zn2+ release, we found a rate constant for the in vitro oxidation of this Cys4:Zn2+ site by H2O2 of ∼0.05 m–1 s–1. Oxidation led to the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds between cysteine residues in the two CXXC motifs, and the resulting oxidized species could be resolved by SDS-PAGE. The in vitro sensitivity of the Cys4:Zn2+ site to oxidation suggests that this site could mediate inactivation of the PerR: Zn,Mn form of the repressor under severe oxidative stress conditions. However, even when treated with high levels of H2O2 there was little if any detectable cysteine oxidation in vivo, and derepression was correlated with oxidation of the regulatory site. Because PerR bound Fe2+ with higher affinity than Mn2+, we propose a model in which high levels of H2O2 release sufficient Fe2+ into the cytosol to effect a transition of PerR from the PerR:Zn,Mn form to the peroxide-sensitive PerR:Zn,Fe form.

Media and Growth—E. coli and B. subtilis cells were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) media with appropriate antibiotics. For metal-restricted growth of B. subtilis, 10 μm FeCl3 or 10 μm MnCl2 was added to defined MOPS-buffered minimal medium (MM) containing 40 mm MOPS (adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH), 2 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 20 g/liter glucose, 2 g/liter (NH4)2SO4, 0.2 g/liter MgSO4 ·7H2O, 1 g/liter sodium citrate ·2H2O, 1 g/liter potassium glutamate, 10 mg/liter tryptophan, 3 nm (NH4)6Mo7O24, 400 nm H3BO3, 30 nm CoCl2, 10 nm CuSO4, 10 nm ZnSO4, and 80 nm MnCl2. Construction of PerR-overexpressing E. coli Strains—The perR open reading frame was PCR-amplified using forward primer 5′-GGTGCATGACCCATGGCTGCACAT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TGACCGTTTCGTGGGATCCGCTTA-3′, creating NcoI and BamHI sites, respectively (underlined), with B. subtilis CU1065 chromosomal DNA as template. For the construction of the PerR-FLAG-overexpressing E. coli strain, forward primer 5′-AAGAGAGGTGCATGACCCATGGCTGCA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GATGACCTCGGATCCACCGGAATTAGC-3′, creating NcoI and BamHI sites, respectively (underlined), were used with HB9612 genomic DNA (see below) as template. These PCR fragments were cloned into the NcoI and BamHI sites of expression vector pET16b (Novagen) resulting in plasmids named pJL041 and pJL069, respectively. These plasmids were introduced into E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS resulting in PerR- and PerR-FLAG-overexpressing E. coli strains named HE9501 and HE9526, respectively. Purification of PerR after Overexpression in E. coli—E. coli cells were harvested from the 10 ml of overnight culture in LB medium and inoculated into 1 liter of fresh LB medium containing 0.4% glucose, 34 mg/liter chloramphenicol, and 100 mg/liter ampicillin. Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to final concentrations of 1 mm at A600 of ∼0.6, and the cells were allowed to grow for an additional 2 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellets were resuspended in 50 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris ·HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 5% (v/v) glycerol) containing 10 mm EDTA. After lysis by sonication, cell debris were removed by centrifugation, and the resulting supernatant was loaded onto a 20-ml heparin-Sepharose column. After application of a linear gradient of 0.1–1 m NaCl, PerR-containing fractions were pooled and buffer-exchanged to buffer A containing 10 mm EDTA using a YM-10 ultrafiltration membrane under the pressure of N2 gas. The resultant PerR was applied to a Mono Q column using an FPLC system (GE Healthcare) and separated using a linear gradient of 0.1–1 m NaCl. The PerR-containing factions were further purified on a Superdex 200 HiLoad 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with Chelex-100-treated buffer A without EDTA. Purification of PerR was also carried out as above in the absence of EDTA or in the presence of DTT. Active PerR (purified in the presence of 10 mm EDTA) contained ∼1.6 mol of zinc/dimer as judged by inductively coupled plasma MS and could be reconstituted with Mn2+ to give protein with ∼60% active molecules in a DNA binding assay. PerR purified in the absence of EDTA was also dimeric and contained stoichiometric zinc (∼1.9 mol of zinc and ∼0.1 mol of iron/dimer) but was largely inactive due to oxidation of the regulatory metal site as reported previously (9Lee J.W. Helmann J.D. Nature. 2006; 440: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Determination of Protein Concentration—The concentration of purified PerR was determined by measuring A277 nm using the calculated value of ϵ277 nm = 10,400 m–1 cm–1. The concentration of proteins in the cell crude extract was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay and/or Bio-Rad DC protein assay (for samples containing SDS) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Construction of FLAG-tagged PerR in B. subtilis—A partial perR gene corresponding to about 350 bp from the 3′-end of perR excluding the stop codon was amplified by PCR using forward primer 5′-GCAGGTACCGCTCTGGAAGGGAAATTTCCTAACATGAGC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GCACGGCCGATGATTTTCTTTTTTCGAACACTCTTGGCAGAC-3′ with B. subtilis CU1065 chromosomal DNA as template. These PCR fragments were cloned into the KpnI and EagI sites of epitope protein-tagging integration vector pMUTIN-FLAG (18Kaltwasser M. Wiegert T. Schumann W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 2624-2628Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) resulting in plasmid pJL062. This plasmid was passed through E. coli JM105 (recA), and the resulting plasmids were used for transformation of B. subtilis CU1065. The generation of perR-FLAG, upon integration of pJL062 into perR, was verified by PCR followed by sequencing, and the resulting strain was named HB9612. The perR-FLAG open reading frame was PCR-amplified using forward primer 5′-CCATGTAGCCGAAAAGCTTCAAACCC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GTTTCCACCGGAATTCGCTTGCATGG-3′ with HB9612 genomic DNA as template. These PCR fragments were cloned into the HindIII and EcoRI sites of pDG1730 resulting in plasmid pJL070. The ScaI digest of pJL070 was used for transformation of HB2080 (CU1065 perR::kan amyE::cat pheA1) or HB9703 (CU1065 perR::tet) to generate transformants containing perR-FLAG in amyE locus designated HB9620 or HB9735, respectively.

Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5815-5821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used for the transduction of CU1065 to give strains containing reporter fusion for mrgA-cat-lacZ, feuA-cat-lacZ, and yciC-cat-lacZ, respectively. The HB9738 strain was made by transduction of HB9735 with SPβ phage from HB1122. SDS-PAGE Sample Preparation and Analysis—For Fig. 1A, purified PerR protein was incubated with 10 mm DTT, 10 mm H2O2, 10 mm diamide, or 10 mm EDTA at 80 °C for 5 min in SDS sample buffer containing 2% SDS and resolved by non-reducing SDS-PAGE using a Tris-Tricine buffer system (22Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). For Fig. 1B, purified PerR protein was treated with 1 mm DTT, 10 mm H2O2, or 10 mm diamide at room temperature for 30 min in buffer A, and residual reagents were removed by precipitation and washing with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Recovered samples were modified by 50 mm AMS in the presence of 10 mm EDTA and 2% SDS and separated by non-reducing SDS-PAGE. For Fig. 4B, under anaerobic conditions 10 μm PerR (in 20 μl) was treated with 100 μm Fe2+ or Mn2+ for 5 min and then exposed to varying amounts of H2O2 for 10 min. PerR was recovered by precipitation with 20 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid. After washing with 10% trichloroacetic acid, the pellets were resuspended in buffer A containing 2% SDS, 20 mm EDTA, and 50 mm AMS and incubated for 30 min in the dark. Then the samples were analyzed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE.FIGURE 4Oxidation of Cys4:Zn2+ site by H2O2 leads to Zn2+ release and Cys oxidation. A, release of Zn2+ from PerR:Zn by H2O2.5 μm PerR (PerR:Zn) was treated with 0, 1, 10, or 100 mm H2O2 in the presence of 100 μm PAR at 25 °C, and the formation of the Zn2+-PAR complex was monitored by measuring absorbance at 494 nm every 1 s for 30 min. Data were fit to an effective first order rate equation, A = Ao (1 – e–k[H2O2]t) + B, where A is absorbance at 494 nm, Ao is the amplitude of the absorbance change, k is the second order rate constant, t is time in seconds, and B is the initial absorbance. The calculated second order rate constant is 0.054 ± 0.009 m–1 s–1. B, oxidation of Cys residues by H2O2. PerR:Zn,Fe or PerR:Zn,Mn was treated with H2O2 under anaerobic conditions, and the remaining reduced Cys residues were monitored by AMS modification.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) On-gel Zn2+ Detection—PerR protein (20 μg) treated with 10 mm DTT or 10 mm H2O2 was resolved on non-reducing SDS-PAGE gels. The SDS-PAGE gel was soaked in buffer A containing 500 μm PAR for 1 min, and subsequently 50 mm H2O2 was added to release Zn2+. Because the color development (light orange) was transient, a photograph of the gel was taken within 10 min. Analysis of SDS-PAGE-fractionated Protein by MALDI-TOF MS—To alkylate reduced Cys residues, the SDS-PAGE gels were directly submerged and incubated in buffer A containing 50 mm EDTA and 50 mm iodoacetamide for 30 min with gentle rocking in the dark. Then the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R and subsequently destained. The stained bands were cut and washed three times by incubating with 100 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 15 min at 37 °C. The washed gel pieces were dried for 20 min in a Speed-Vac and rehydrated with 10–20 μl of trypsin solution (20 ng/μl trypsin in 9% acetonitrile solution containing 40 mm ammonium bicarbonate). The samples were digested for ∼4 h (Fig. 2; partial digestion) or ∼18 h (Fig. 3; full digestion) at 37 °C. A volume of 0.5 μl of sample was mixed with an equal volume of matrix (saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxysuccinamic acid in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid) on the target plate and allowed to air dry. MALDI mass spectra were recorded with an Applied Biosystems 4700 mass spectrometer. For the analysis of oxidation of PerR:Zn,Mn (Fig. 5), PerR:Zn,Mn (10 μm purified PerR + 100 μm MnCl2) was incubated with 0, 0.1, 1, 10, or 100 mm H2O2 for 10 min under anaerobic conditions, and the proteins were recovered by precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid, modified using 50 mm iodoacetamide, trypsinized, and analyzed using a Bruker BIFLEXIII mass spectrometer.FIGURE 3Effects of Cys oxidation by H2O2 on the mobility of PerR during SDS-PAGE.

B–D, after treatment of the whole gel with 50 mm iodoacetamide, band 3 (B), band 2(C), and band 4 (D) were analyzed by in-gel tryptic digestion followed by MALDI-TOF MS. Spectra in the upper right insets correspond to the regions of m/z values from 3300 to 3700 with intensities multiplied by 10. E, schematic representations of bands 1, 2, 3, and 4. The dotted line indicates coordination of Zn2+ by Cys thiolate (band 1) or disulfide bonds between Cys residues (bands 2–4).

PerR:Zn,Mn (10 μm purified PerR + 100 μm MnCl2) was incubated with 0 (A), 0.1 (B), 1(C), 10 (D), or 100 (E) mm H2O2 for 10 min under anaerobic conditions. Proteins were recovered by precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid, modified using 50 mm iodoacetamide, trypsinized, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. Peptides containing two carbamidomethyl-modified Cys residues are designated with open triangles and marked with asterisks as in Fig. 2. CXXC motif-containing peptides (T11 and T14) are exclusively detected as fully alkylated forms up to 1 mm H2O2 treatment. In samples treated with 100 mm H2O2 (E), CXXC motif-containing peptides are detected without alkylation at Cys residues. Note that T11 shows no increase in oxidation at His91 residue despite the full oxidation at Cys96 and Cys99 residues by 100 mm H2O2 treatment (T11 contains a small amount of oxidation as judged by the small peak with a +16-Da mass shift. This oxidation is present in the purified PerR protein and is not further increased by peroxide treatment of Mn2+-supplemented protein. This corresponds to His91 oxidation and correlates with the observation that the protein, as purified, is ∼60% active for DNA binding.) T7 containing Met54 gains +16 m/z units, indicative of methionine sulfoxide formation. By analogy, the gain of +16 m/z units on T5 seems to indicate the oxidation at Met35 rather than His37.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Electrospray Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Electrospray ionization MS was performed using a Bruker Esquire-LC ion trap mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Breman, Germany). The ion spray voltage was set at 4 kV, the orifice voltage was set at 80 V, and the interface temperature was set at 80 °C. PerR (stored in buffer A) was buffer-exchanged with 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) by using a Micro Bio-Spin 6 chromatography column. For standard acidic denaturing conditions, 25% (v/v) methanol and 1% (v/v) acetic acid in 5 mm ammonium bicarbonate was used as vector solution. For the detection of Zn2+-bound PerR, 5% (v/v) methanol in 5 mm ammonium bicarbonate was used as vector solvent. Sample volumes of 20 μl were infused into the spectrometer using a syringe pump at a flow rate of 3 μl/min. Mass spectra were analyzed and manipulated using the Bruker Daltonics DataAnalysis program. Measurement of Zn2+ Release by H2O2 Using PAR—Under our buffer conditions (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol; 25 °C) the absorption maximum of Zn2+-PAR complex was observed at 494 nm, and the ϵ494 nm was measured to be 8.5 ± 0.25 × 104 m–1 cm–1 in the range of 0–6 μm Zn2+ (compared with ϵ500 nm = 6.6 ± 0.2 × 104 m–1 cm–1 for (PAR)2-Zn2+ at pH 7 (23Hunt J.B. Neece S.H. Ginsburg A. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 146: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar)). 5 μm PerR (PerR: Zn) in buffer A (or buffer A containing 7 m urea) was treated with 0, 1, 10, or 100 mm H2O2 in the presence of 100 μm PAR at 25 °C, and released Zn2+ was measured by monitoring the Zn2+-PAR complex at 494 nm every 1 s for 30 min. Because the affinity of PAR to Zn2+ was high and the rate of association of the Zn2+ with PAR was much faster than that of Zn2+ release from PerR (reported value of second order k for forming Zn2+-PAR complex at pH 7 is ∼2 × 107 m–1 s–1), all the released Zn2+ ions were assumed to be present as Zn2+-PAR complex. The data were fitted to an effective first order rate equation, A = Ao (1 – e–k[H2O2]t) + B, where A is absorbance at 494 nm, Ao is the amplitude of absorbance, k is the second order rate constant, t is time in seconds, and B is the initial absorbance. β-Galactosidase Assay—Overnight cultures of cells in MM containing 10 μm FeCl3 and 10 μm MnCl2 were washed with MM and inoculated by 25× dilution into fresh MM containing 10 μm FeCl3 or 10 μm MnCl2. At an A600 of ∼0.6, aliquots of each culture were treated with H2O2 and further incubated for 30 min. Alternatively cells were treated with H2O2 for 10 min, residual H2O2 was removed by centrifugation, and cells were resuspended in fresh MM containing metal ions and further incubated for 30 min. β-Galactosidase assays were performed as reported previously (2Fuangthong M. Herbig A.F. Bsat N. Helmann J.D. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3276-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Analysis of in Vivo Oxidation Status of Cys Residues by AMS Modification—HB9738 cells grown overnight in MM containing 10 μm FeCl3 and 10 μm MnCl2 were washed twice with MM and diluted 25× in 55 ml of fresh LB medium, MM containing 10 μm FeCl3, or MM containing 10 μm MnCl2. At A600 = 0.6 aliquots of 10-ml culture were mixed with 1.1 ml of trichloroacetic acid at a given time point before and after H2O2 treatment. After centrifugation, pellets were resuspended in 10% trichloroacetic acid, split into two fractions, and washed with acetone. Each fraction was sonicated in 150 μl of 20 mm iodoacetamide or 20 mm AMS solution containing 200 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 5% glycerol, 1% SDS, and 20 mm EDTA. Alkylations were performed at room temperature in the dark for 1 h, and ∼10 μl (corresponding to 30 μg of protein as assayed by DC protein assay (Bio-Rad)) of alkylated samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, proteins were blotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with polyclonal anti-FLAG antibody from rabbit and anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. Analysis of in Vivo Oxidation of PerR by MS—HB9738 cells were grown overnight in 25 ml of MM containing 10 μm FeCl3 and 10 μm MnCl2. Cells were washed two times with MM and inoculated into 0.8 liter of MM supplemented with 10 μm MnCl2.Atan A600 of ∼0.5, aliquots of 250-ml cell culture were treated with 0, 0.1, or 10 mm H2O2 for 5 min, harvested by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 10 min, and washed two times with Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 150 mm NaCl) containing 20 mm EDTA (TBS + EDTA). Cells were sonicated in 1.3 ml of TBS + EDTA containing protease inhibitor mixture, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, and 2% Triton X-100. After removal of cell debris by centrifugation at 16,100 × g for 10 min, the resulting supernatants were incubated with 40 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel for 1 h and then washed with 1 ml of TBS + EDTA three times. Anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel suspensions containing PerR-FLAG were m"
https://openalex.org/W2073147706,"A novel, quantitative saturation (QS) scanning strategy was developed to obtain a comprehensive data base of the structural and functional effects of all possible mutations across a large protein-protein interface. The QS scan approach was applied to the high affinity site of human growth hormone (hGH) for binding to its receptor (hGHR). Although the published structure-function data base describing this system is probably the most extensive for any large protein-protein interface, it is nonetheless too sparse to accurately describe the nature of the energetics governing the interaction. Our comprehensive data base affords a complete view of the binding site and provides important new insights into the general principles underlying protein-protein interactions. The hGH binding interface is highly adaptable to mutations, but the nature of the tolerated mutations challenges generally accepted views about the evolutionary and biophysical pressures governing protein-protein interactions. Many substitutions that would be considered chemically conservative are not tolerated, while conversely, many non-conservative substitutions can be accommodated. Furthermore, conservation across species is a poor predictor of the chemical character of tolerated substitutions across the interface. Numerous deviations from generally accepted expectations indicate that mutational tolerance is highly context dependent and, furthermore, cannot be predicted by our current knowledge base. The type of data produced by the comprehensive QS scan can fill the gaps in the structure-function matrix. The compilation of analogous data bases from studies of other protein-protein interactions should greatly aid the development of computational methods for explaining and designing molecular recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2038495426,"Glutathione (GSH) plays a crucial role in plant metabolism and stress response. The rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of GSH is catalyzed by glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) the activity of which is tightly regulated. The regulation of plant GCLs is poorly understood. The crystal structure of substrate-bound GCL from Brassica juncea at 2.1-Å resolution reveals a plant-unique regulatory mechanism based on two intramolecular redox-sensitive disulfide bonds. Reduction of one disulfide bond allows a β-hairpin motif to shield the active site of B. juncea GCL, thereby preventing the access of substrates. Reduction of the second disulfide bond reversibly controls dimer to monomer transition of B. juncea GCL that is associated with a significant inactivation of the enzyme. These regulatory events provide a molecular link between high GSH levels in the plant cell and associated down-regulation of its biosynthesis. Furthermore, known mutations in the Arabidopsis GCL gene affect residues in the close proximity of the active site and thus explain the decreased GSH levels in mutant plants. In particular, the mutation in rax1-1 plants causes impaired binding of cysteine. Glutathione (GSH) plays a crucial role in plant metabolism and stress response.

Rausch T. Photosynth. Res. 2005; 86: 459-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Through reversible oxidation to glutathione disulfide, it acts as a major cellular redox buffer. In the plant chloroplast GSH can reach millimolar concentrations depending on diverse external stress stimuli and on the day-night transition. Light/dark-induced changes in stromal pH further modulate the redox potential of GSH (2Meyer A.J. Hell R. Photosynth. Res. 2005; 86: 435-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar).In plants, GSH detoxifies reactive oxygen species via the ascorbic acid-GSH-cycle (3Foyer C.H. Noctor G. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 1866-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (2024) Google Scholar) and glutathione peroxidases (4Rodriguez Milla M.A. Maurer A. Rodriguez Huete A. Gustafson J.P. Plant J. 2003; 36: 602-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). It is involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics via glutathione S-transferases (5Wagner U. Edwards R. Dixon D.P. Mauch F. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 49: 515-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), represents the precursor for the heavy metal ions sequestering phytochelatins (6Cobbett C. Goldsbrough P. Annu. Rev.

Trends Plant Sci. 2005; 10: 503-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). GSH can post-translationally modify proteins via glutathionylation (8Michelet L. Zaffagnini M.

Maughan S.C. Cobbett C.S. Van Montagu M. Inze D. May M.J. Sung Z.R. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 97-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, GSH represents a major storage and transport form of reduced sulfur in plants (12Kopriva S. Rennenberg H. J. Exp. Bot. 2004; 55: 1831-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar).The biosynthesis of GSH occurs in two sequential ATP-dependent steps. Glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL, 3The abbreviations used are: GCL, glutamate cysteine ligase (alternate name: γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase); BjGCL, B. juncea glutamate cysteine ligase; AtGCL, A. thaliana glutamate cysteine ligase; BSO, l-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine; TCEP, Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride; CC1, disulfide bridge 1 (Cys341-Cys356); CC2, disulfide bridge 2 (Cys178-Cys398); r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine.3The abbreviations used are: GCL, glutamate cysteine ligase (alternate name: γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase); BjGCL, B. juncea glutamate cysteine ligase; AtGCL, A. thaliana glutamate cysteine ligase; BSO, l-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine; TCEP, Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride; CC1, disulfide bridge 1 (Cys341-Cys356); CC2, disulfide bridge 2 (Cys178-Cys398); r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. EC 6.3.2.2.) produces the reaction intermediate γ-glutamylcysteine (Scheme 1). Glutathione synthetase (EC 6.3.2.3.) then catalyzes the addition of a glycine residue.L-glutamate+L-cysteine+ATP→L-γ-glutamyl-L-cysteine+ADP+PiBoth enzymes are encoded by single genes in Arabidopsis, belonging to the Brassicaceae family (13May M.J. Leaver C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10059-10063Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 14Ullmann P. Gondet L. Potier S. Bach T.J. Eur. J.

In this plant family GCL is localized exclusively in the plastids, whereas glutathione synthetase is found both in plastids and in the cytosol (16Wachter A. Wolf S. Steininger H. Bogs J. Rausch T. Plant J. 2005; 41: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Under most conditions, GCL activity is rate-limiting in plant GSH biosynthesis (17Noctor G. Arisi A.C. Jouanin L. Foyer C.H. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This is highlighted by significantly reduced glutathione levels in AtGCL mutants (18Cobbett C.S. May M.J. Howden R. Rolls B. Plant J. 1998; 16: 73-78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ball L. Accotto G.P. Bechtold U. Creissen G. Funck D. Jimenez A. Kular B. Leyland N. Mejia-Carranza J. Reynolds H. Karpinski S. Mullineaux P.M. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2448-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar).Plant GCL protein sequences diverge from those of non-plant eukaryotic organisms (mammals, Drosophila). Although some bacteria share low sequence homology with BjGCL (15% identity with the Escherichia coli enzyme) other species such as Agrobacterium tumefaciens show up to 70% sequence identity. The molecular architecture of GCL in non-plant eukaryotes and bacteria is remarkably distinct. Whereas mammalian and Drosophila GCL consist of a catalytic and a regulatory subunit that reversibly dissociate (20Seelig G.F. Simondsen R.P. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9345-9347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Fraser J.A. Saunders R.D. McLellan L.I. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 50-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Catalytic properties of plant GCL have been studied in vitro (23Jez J.M. Cahoon R.E. Chen S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33463-33470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), but the regulation of the plant enzyme is poorly understood. Currently, it is known that GCL mRNA levels are increased in response to stress (24Xiang C. Oliver D.J. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1539-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). However, a stress-induced increase of glutamate cysteine ligase activity has been monitored in cell suspension cultures while no transcriptional up-regulation of AtGCL was observed (25May M.J. Vernoux T. Sanchez-Fernandez R. Van Montagu M. Inze D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12049-12054Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).These findings point toward a post-translational regulation of plant GCL that was suggested by Hell and Bergmann (26Hell R. Bergmann L. Planta. 1990; 180: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Addition of reducing agents led to severe inhibition of plant GCL directly purified from tobacco cell suspensions. Similar findings could recently be quantified by monitoring the enzymatic activity of recombinant AtGCL in the presence and absence of reducing agents (23Jez J.M. Cahoon R.E. Chen S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33463-33470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The authors suggested the presence of an intramolecular disulfide bridge that, upon reduction, would trigger the inactivation of the enzyme.In this study we have used X-ray crystallography to address the question of whether such a redox-sensitive mechanism exists in plant GCL and how it is implemented at the structural level. The first crystal structure of a plant GCL reveals the presence of two intramolecular disulfide bridges. Using site-directed mutants in biochemical experiments, we have analyzed their role in the regulation of the enzyme.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification—BjGCL (acc AJ563921) was PCR-amplified using sense primer 5′-ACTGCCATGGGGGCGGCGAGTCCTCCCAC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-TAAGTCGACTCAGTAAAGCAGTTCCTGGAA-3′, thereby omitting the predicted plastidic transit peptide (residues 1-65). Subsequently, the NcoI/SalI-excised fragment was ligated into vector pETM20 (27Hothorn M. Bonneau F. Stier G. Greiner S. Scheffzek K. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 2279-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The thioredoxin fusion protein was expressed in E. coli Rosetta gami DE3 (Novagen, Madison, WI). Cells grown to an A600 nm of 1.5 were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside in Terrific Broth at 28 °C for 18 h. Pelleted cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm NaPi (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 50 mm glutamate, 25 μg/ml DNase I) and lysed with an EmulsiFlex-C5 (Avestin Inc., Ottawa, Canada). The suspension was centrifuged at 22,000 × g for 30 min and purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The column was washed, and the protein was eluted by applying increasing concentrations (10-200 mm) of imidazole. The eluted fusion protein was concentrated using a Vivaspin concentrator (10-kDa MWCO, Vivascience, Hannover, Germany) and dialyzed against 50 mm NaPi (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl. The fusion protein was then cleaved with recombinant tobacco etch virus protease for 12 h at 4 °C. BjGCL was separated from the His6-tagged protease and thioredoxin by a second Ni2+ affinity step. Out of 3 liters of culture, ∼10 mg of pure BjGCL was concentrated to ∼12 mg/ml and dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0) and 50 mm glutamate.Selenomethionine-labeled BjGCL was expressed in E. coli strain B834(DE3) at 28 °C, after induction for 18 h with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, using Terrific Broth medium supplemented with 40 μg/ml seleno-l-methionine and purified as described above.Crystallization and Data Collection—Monoclinic crystals of selenomethionine-labeled GCL (form A, see Table 1) were grown at room temperature by vapor diffusion from hanging drops composed of equal volumes (1 + 1 μl) of protein solution and crystallization buffer (15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3,350, 0.2 m Mg(CH3COO)2 × 4H2O, 0.1 m Tricine, pH 8.0) suspended of 0.5 ml of the latter as reservoir solution. Plate-like crystals of up to 150 × 50 × 30 μm developed using micro-seeding protocols in the presence of 10 mm BSO. They were transferred into reservoir solution containing 15% (v/v) ethylene glycol and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. A hexagonal crystal form developed from unlabeled protein at a slightly increased polyethylene glycol concentration (18% (w/v) poly-ethylene glycol 3,350) and in the presence of 0.1 m ATP. These crystals were used in micro-seeding protocols to grow larger hexagonal crystals in the presence of l-glutamate as the only additive. Multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion data were collected from a monoclinic crystal containing selenomethionine-labeled protein at beam line ID14-4 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France. In the case of the hexagonal crystal form, a dataset at 2.1-Å resolution has been recorded at beam line PX01 at Swiss Light Source, Villigen, Switzerland, using a large area detector.

This supports a role of CC2 during the folding of the protein rather than a structural role in the stabilization of the folded enzyme. The very low enzymatic activity of C178S measured in GCL activity assays is likely due to a largely unfolded protein species. were introduced with the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions and subsequently verified by DNA sequencing. Mutant proteins were produced using similar protocols as described for wt-BjGCL and purified to homogeneity by preparative size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 HR 16/60 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, and 50 mm l-glutamate.Analytical Size-exclusion Chromatography—This was performed using Superdex 200 or 75 HR 10/30 columns (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated in 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, and 50 mm l-glutamate. 50 μl of the sample (10 mg/ml) was loaded onto the column, and elution at 0.8 ml/min was monitored by ultraviolet absorbance at 280 nm.For reduction experiments, half of the C341S or C356A mutant protein from one preparation was loaded on the column equilibrated in 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, and 50 mm l-glutamate, whereas the other half was extensively dialyzed over night against 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm l-glutamate, and 5 mm TCEP or 5 mm dithiothreitol, respectively, and then applied to the column equilibrated in the reducing buffer. For re-oxidation the reduced protein was dialyzed overnight against 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, and 50 mm l-glutamate and then reapplied to the column equilibrated in the oxidizing buffer.CD Spectroscopy—This was performed on a temperature-controlled J-710 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Easton, MD) at a cell path length of 0.2 cm and at a sensitivity of 50 millidegrees using protein samples at a concentration of 0.25 mg/ml, dialyzed against 5 mm Na Pi (pH 8.0), 5 mm NaCl. Spectra were analyzed using the statistical package R (40Ihaka R. Gentleman R. J. Comput. Graph. Stat. 1996; 5: 299-314Google Scholar).Enzyme Assays—Pure samples of recombinant BjGCL were analyzed in a coupled enzymatic assay as described before (41Abbott J.J. Pei J. Ford J.L. Qi Y. Grishin V.N.

A standard reaction mixture (0.5 ml) contained 100 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm l-cysteine, 20 mm l-glutamate, 5 mm ATP, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 mm NADH, 5 units of type II rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase, and 10 units of type II rabbit muscle lactic dehydrogenase (chemicals and enzymes were purchased from Sigma). Reactions were initiated by addition of BjGCL (100-400 ng). The resulting decrease of A340 nm was followed, and steady-state kinetic parameters were determined by initial velocity experiments. For determining the Km values for cysteine and glutamate, their concentrations were varied from 0.2 to 20 mm (cysteine) or 0.5 to 25 mm (glutamate) while keeping the other component concentrations constant. Kinetic parameters were calculated to fit data to v = [S]/(Km + [S]) using the plotting method described by Hanes (42Hanes C.S. Biochem. J. 1932; 26: 1406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Atomic Coordinates—and structure factors have been submitted to the Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org) with code 2GWC (crystal form A) and 2GWD (crystal form B), respectively.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAn Unexpected β-Hairpin in Plant GCL—Plant GCL from Brassica juncea (residues 66-514) has been produced in a bacterial expression system allowing for the formation of disulfide bonds (see “Experimental Procedures”). BjGCL was crystallized under oxidizing conditions, and its structure was solved and refined in two crystal forms at resolutions of 2.18 Å (form A, Rfree 0.24) and 2.1 Å (form B, Rfree 0.23), respectively (Table 1). The molecules in the asymmetric units of both crystal forms are almost identical and comprise residues 79-514. Form A crystals contain the inhibitor BSO along with Mg2+ in the active site. Form B shows the enzyme bound to l-glutamate.In contrast to previous predictions (13May M.J. Leaver C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10059-10063Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), plant GCL shares significant structural similarity with the E. coli enzyme (43Hibi T. Nii H. Nakatsu T. Kimura A. Kato H. Hiratake J. Oda J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15052-15057Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The primary sequence folds into a six-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet forming a bowl-like structure flanked by helical regions as shown in Fig. 1. This central part of BjGCL superimposes well with its bacterial counterpart (root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) between 223 corresponding Cα atoms <2.2 Å; see supplemental Fig. S1).A plant-unique feature in BjGCL is a β-hairpin motif (residues 326-346; shown in red in Fig. 1) that is stabilized by a disulfide bridge (Cys341-Cys356, named `CC1′ hereafter; see Fig. 1). The active site is located at the bottom of a solvent-accessible cavity that is formed by two arm-like structures flanking the central β-sheet (shown in light and dark green in Fig. 1). Two helices from the N and C termini are linked by a second disulfide bridge (Cys178-Cys398, named “CC2” hereafter; see Fig. 1). The presence of two disulfide bonds in BjGCL has important implications for the regulation of plant GCL activity, which we discuss below.Catalytic Residues Are Conserved among Plant and E. coli GCL—The crystal forms of BjGCL in complex with l-glutamate or BSO and Mg2+ allow identifying residues important for substrate binding and catalysis in plant GCL. One Mg2+ ion is coordinated by three glutamate residues (Fig. 2A), one of which is replaced by aspartate in E. coli (supplemental Fig. S2) (43Hibi T. Nii H. Nakatsu T. Kimura A. Kato H. Hiratake J. Oda J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15052-15057Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). BjGCL has been crystallized in the absence of the nucleotide, but the position of its binding pocket can be inferred from the high structural similarity with the E. coli enzyme, bound to ADP (see supplemental Fig. S3).FIGURE 2Substrate binding in plant GCL.

C, stereo close-up view of the plant GCL cysteine binding pocket formed by mostly hydrophobic residues (in blue) around the aliphatic side chain of BSO (in light gray). The corresponding secondary structure elements and residues in E. coli GCL (PDB-ID: 1VA6) are shown in orange. D, known mutations in the Arabidopsis GCL gene are in proximity of the substrate binding sites in plant GCL. BjGCL in ribbon representation is shown with BSO and ADP (modeled) in bonds representation (in yellow). Small spheres indicate the positions of residues affected in AtGCL mutant plants (in magenta). Enlarged versions provide models on how the affected residues in rax1-1 and rml1 mutants may interact with GCL substrates. The rax1-1 arginine residue (Arg220) is shown in a modeled rotamer configuration bringing its guanidinium group in close proximity to the terminal methyl of BSO that corresponds to the sulfhydryl group of cysteine (in green). Interactions are highlighted by dotted lines (in magenta).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Structural comparison of form A and B crystals (Table 1) shows l-glutamate in the same position as is the glutamate mimicking portion of BSO (Fig. 2A). The substrate is coordinated by the highly conserved Arg292 along with Thr242 (Ile146 in E. coli, Fig. 2 (A and B) and supplemental Fig. S2). In BjGCL, additional contacts are made by Trp296 that are not present in the E. coli protein (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S2). These variations in the substrate-binding residues might account for the differences in affinity for l-glutamate in bacterial and plant GCL (23Jez J.M. Cahoon R.E. Chen S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33463-33470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 44Huang C.S. Moore W.R. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2464-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).The aliphatic side chain of the inhibitor BSO is bound in the cysteine binding site. This portion of the binding pocket is formed by mainly hydrophobic residues reaching the alkyl chain of BSO from four directions (Fig. 2C), very similar to E. coli GCL (shown in orange in Fig. 2C) (43Hibi T.

Notably, the positions of Arg220 and Tyr221 in BjGCL are reversed with respect to the E. coli enzyme (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S2).Depressed GSH Levels in the Arabidopsis rax1-1 Mutant Are Caused by Impaired Cysteine Binding—Recently, the mutant regulator of ascorbate peroxidase 2 (rax1-1) has been identified as a missense mutation in the Arabidopsis GCL gene, resulting in decreased glutathione levels (19Ball L. Accotto G.P. Bechtold U. Creissen G. Funck D. Jimenez A. Kular B. Leyland N. Mejia-Carranza J. Reynolds H. Karpinski S. Mullineaux P.M. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2448-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In the protein, the mutation substitutes Arg229 (Arg220 in B. juncea) for lysine. The arginine is located at the proximal side of the cysteine binding pocket (Fig. 2C), and its guanidinium group may be important for recognition of the sulfhydryl group of cysteine in plant GCL (Fig. 2D). We have engineered the mutation and analyzed its consequences on the affinity of BjGCL for the three substrates with respect to the wild-type protein. As shown in Table 2, the Km value for cysteine is ∼5-fold increased, whereas the affinities for either glutamate or ATP are unaffected. The decrease in binding affinity highlights the importance of Arg220 in the recognition of cysteine. Because the Km for cysteine of wild-type BjGCL is comparable to"
https://openalex.org/W2044608069,"Sulfatases are a highly conserved family of enzymes found in all three domains of life. To be active, sulfatases undergo a unique post-translational modification leading to the conversion of either a critical cysteine (“Cys-type” sulfatases) or a serine (“Ser-type” sulfatases) into a Cα-formylglycine (FGly). This conversion depends on a strictly conserved sequence called “sulfatase signature” (C/S)XPXR. In a search for new enzymes from the human microbiota, we identified the first sulfatase from Firmicutes. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analysis revealed that this enzyme undergoes conversion of its critical cysteine residue into FGly, even though it has a modified (C/S)XAXR sulfatase signature. Examination of the bacterial and archaeal genomes sequenced to date has identified many genes bearing this new motif, suggesting that the definition of the sulfatase signature should be expanded. Furthermore, we have also identified a new Cys-type sulfatase-maturating enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of cysteine into FGly, in anaerobic conditions, whereas the only enzyme reported so far to be able to catalyze this reaction is oxygen-dependent. The new enzyme belongs to the radical S-adenosyl-l-methionine enzyme superfamily and is related to the Ser-type sulfatase-maturating enzymes. This finding leads to the definition of a new enzyme family of sulfatase-maturating enzymes that we have named anSME (anaerobic sulfatase-maturating enzyme). This family includes enzymes able to maturate Cys-type as well as Ser-type sulfatases in anaerobic conditions.

Sulfatases are widespread enzymes found from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. They are involved in various metabolic processes, ranging from sulfate starvation response in bacteria to hormone biosynthesis and the modulation of developmental cell signaling in mammals (1Parenti G. Meroni G. Ballabio A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 386-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In humans, their biological relevance is particularly underlined by their involvement in several inherited diseases such as mucopolysaccharidoses (2Dorfman A. Matalon R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sulfatases act on a broad diversity of substrates, which leads to their classification by the IUBMB into 17 classes (from EC 3.1.6.1 to EC 3.1.6.18). Despite this apparent heterogeneity, the primary and tertiary structures of sulfatases are highly conserved (6Bond C.S. Clements P.R. Ashby S.J. Collyer C.A. Harrop S.J. Hopwood J.J. Guss J.M.

In a search for enzymes from human microbiota that are able to hydrolyze nutritionally relevant sulfated compounds, namely glucosinolates (β-thioglucoside-N-hydroxysulfates) (18Fahey J.W. Zalcmann A.T. Talalay P. Phytochemistry. 2001; 56: 5-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (2168) Google Scholar), we investigated the biochemical activities of Clostridium perfringens. This led us to identify the first sulfatase from Firmicutes. This sulfatase, a Cys-type, is the first one described that lacks the canonical sulfatase signature sequence. Furthermore, while searching for enzymes responsible for its maturation in vivo, we could not identify any FGE-type enzyme, the only Cys-type maturating enzyme identified to date. Instead, we discovered the C. perfringens genome encodes a protein related to the Ser-type sulfatase-maturating enzyme, AtsB. We demonstrate that this enzyme activates the newly discovered sulfatase, making it the first enzyme described as being able to convert cysteine to FGly in anaerobic bacteria. Chemicals—p-Nitrophenyl sulfate was purchased from Sigma. Enzymes, oligonucleotides, and culture media were purchased from VWR Scientific. Other chemicals and reagents were obtained from commercial sources and were of analytical grade. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and DNA Manipulations—The C. perfringens strain used in this study was the ATCC 13124 strain. Escherichia coli DH5α was used for routine DNA manipulations. E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Stratagene) was used for C. perfringens sulfatase and maturation enzyme overexpression. The pET-28(a) plasmid (Novagen) used to clone the cpe0231 gene was engineered to bear the ampicillin resistance gene. The cpe0635 gene was cloned in the pRSF plasmid (Novagen). T4 DNA ligase was from Promega. The plasmid DNA purification kit and QIAprep spin were from Qiagen. DNA fragments were extracted from agarose gel and purified with Wizard SV gel and PCR clean up system kit (Promega). DNA sequencing was performed by VWR Scientific. Preparation of C. perfringens Protein Extracts—C. perfringens ATCC 13124 was grown overnight in an anaerobic chamber (Bactron, Cornelius, OR) in TYH broth (tryptone, yeast extract, and hemin broth) supplemented with or without 50 mm ammonium sulfate. At the end of the culture, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (4,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min) and disrupted by sonication (1 min). After centrifugation (10,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min), the resulting supernatant constituting the protein extract was stored at −20 °C. Enzyme Assays—Sulfatase activity was assayed at 30 °C for 10 min using 50 mm p-nitrophenyl sulfate in 100 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.15. The p-nitrophenol released was measured spectrophotometrically at 405 nm (ϵ = 9 000 mol−1·cm−1 at pH 7.15). Cloning and Construction of the pET-6His-CPE0231 Overexpressing Plasmid—C. perfringens ATCC 13124 was grown anaerobically in BHI medium, pH 7.0, and the cells were harvested to extract the genomic DNA using the Wizard genomic kit from Promega. The cpe0231 gene encoding the putative sulfatase was amplified by a PCR-based method using genomic DNA as a template. The following primers were used: 5′-catATGaagccaaatattgtgttaatcatggtt-3′ (NdeI site underlined and ATG codon in uppercase) hybridized to the noncoding strand at the 5′ terminus of the gene and 5′-ctcgagttattatcttatatgttttaaagtgcttac-3′ (XhoI site underlined) hybridized to the coding strand. PCR was run as follows. Genomic DNA (1 μg) in the presence of the primers (0.5 μm each) was mixed with the Hot Start kit (Promega), and 30 cycles of PCR were performed (1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 50 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C), followed by a final 10-min elongation step at 72 °C. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and XhoI and then ligated with T4 DNA ligase into pET28(a) plasmid digested previously with the same restriction enzymes. The entire sequence of the cloned gene was sequenced to ensure that no errors were introduced during the PCR. The plasmid was named pET-6His-CPE0231. Cloning and Construction of the pRSF-CPE0635 Overexpressing Plasmid—In a similar manner, the cpe0635 gene was cloned with the following modifications. The primers used were 5′-catATGccaccattaagtttgcttattaagcca-3′ (NdeI site underlined, ATG codon in uppercase) hybridized to the noncoding strand at the 5′ terminus of the gene and 5′-ctcgagttattatttaatattgttgcaacatttat-3′ (XhoI site underlined) hybridized to the coding strand. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and XhoI and then ligated with T4 DNA ligase into pRSF plasmid digested previously with the same restriction enzymes. The entire sequence of the cloned gene was sequenced to ensure that no errors were introduced during the PCR, and the plasmid was named pRSF-CPE0635. Protein Expression—E. coli BL21(DE3) was transformed with pET-6His-CP0231 and then grown overnight at 37 °C in LB medium (100 ml) supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg·ml−1). The overnight culture was then used to inoculate fresh LB medium (1 liter) supplemented with the same antibiotic, and bacterial growth proceeded at 37 °C until the A600 reached 0.6. The cells were induced by adding 500 μm of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and were collected after 3 h of culture by centrifugation at 4,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. After resuspension in Tris buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.0), the cells were disrupted by sonication and centrifuged at 220,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. The solution was then loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose column equilibrated with 0.1 m Tris buffer, pH 7.0. The column was washed extensively with the same buffer. Some of the adsorbed proteins were eluted by a washing step with 30 and 100 mm imidazole, and the overexpressed protein was eluted by applying 500 mm imidazole. Fractions containing the protein were immediately concentrated in Ultrafree cells (Millipore) with a molecular cut-off of 10 kDa. Protein Co-expression—E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed previously with the plasmid pET-6His-CP0231 were made chemically competent and then further transformed with the plasmid pRSF-CPE0635. Transformed bacteria were selected on LB medium containing ampicillin and kanamycin, and protein expression was induced with 500 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. MALDI-TOF Analysis—Samples were prepared as follows. The overexpressed protein (50 pmol·μl−1) was digested overnight with trypsin (20 ng·μl−1) in ammonium carbonate buffer, pH 8.0, at 37 °C. Then 5 μl of the solution was further hydrolyzed with 5 μl of CNBr (20 mg·ml−1 in 0.2 m HCl) in the dark at 45 °C for 4 h. The α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix (CHCA) was prepared at 4 mg·ml−1 in 0.15% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile. The 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone acid matrix (DNPH) was prepared at 1.3 mg·ml−1 in 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile. Equal volumes (1 μl) of matrix and sample were spotted onto the MALDI-TOF target plate. MALDI-TOF analysis was then performed on a Voyager DE STR Instrument (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, CA). Spectra were acquired in the reflector mode with 20-kV accelerating voltage, 62% grid voltage, and a 120-ns delay. Computational Analysis—The 16 S rDNA sequences from each bacterial strain were aligned with each other using ClustalW (19Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55389) Google Scholar). The phylogenetic tree was drawn by using the neighbor-joining method (20Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar) with the Kimura two-parameter calculation model. Sulfatase Activity of C. perfringens—Protein extract from C. perfringens was assayed for sulfatase activity using the synthetic substrate, p-nitrophenyl sulfate (PNP-S). At neutral pH, the extract exhibited a weak sulfatase activity of 0.25 nmol·min−1·mg−1, which almost vanished when we grew C. perfringens in presence of 50 mm ammonium sulfate. This result suggested that C. perfringens possesses at least one sulfatase enzyme regulated by the sulfate content of the medium. A search for genes annotated as sulfatases in the C. perfringens genome did not show any obvious candidates (15Dierks T. Schmidt B. VonFigura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11963-11968Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), whereas a blast search with sulfatase sequences led to the identification of one gene, cpe0231, annotated as a “probable phosphonate monoester hydrolase” (21Dotson S.B. Smith C.E. Ling C.S. Barry G.F. Kishore G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25754-25761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 22Shimizu T. Ohtani K. Hirakawa H. Ohshima K. Yamashita A. Shiba T. Ogasawara N. Hattori M. Kuhara S. Hayashi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 996-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Despite its annotation, the sequence of the putative protein coded by the cpe0231 gene shared significant identity (from 20 to 24%) with other known bacterial sulfatases. Nevertheless, although all the sequenced sulfatases studied to date share a consensus motif (C/S)XPXR, the protein encoded by the cpe0231 gene was predicted to be devoid of the strictly conserved proline (Fig. 1). Cloning and Sulfatase Activity of the cpe0231 Gene—The cpe0231 gene was cloned and overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). Following purification, the recombinant protein was analyzed by gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. The protein was essentially pure and migrated in accordance with its predicted molecular mass of 58 kDa (data not shown). The pure protein was then investigated for its sulfatase activity, using PNP-S as a substrate. Analysis revealed that it efficiently hydrolyzed PNP-S with a Km value of 38 mm. Cations, usually calcium, have been described as promoting the activity of sulfatases (6Bond C.S. Clements P.R. Ashby S.J. Collyer C.A. Harrop S.J. Hopwood J.J. Guss J.M.

Kertesz M.A. Uson I. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 483-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Therefore we checked if calcium is able to increase the activity of the cloned enzyme. Indeed, the sulfatase activity increased when we added up to 10 mm of CaCl2, leading to a slight Km decrease from 38 to 30 mm but a doubling of its maximum velocity (Vm = 2.75 μmol·min−1). Thus, in optimal conditions, the specific activity of the purified enzyme toward PNP-S was determined to be 0.08 μmol·min−1·mg−1. MALDI-TOF Analysis of the Protein Encoded by the cpe0231 Gene—Sequence analysis of the protein encoded by the cpe0231 gene indicated that Cys-51 (Cys-67 with the addition of the Tag in the recombinant enzyme) is likely to be the key residue involved in sulfate hydrolysis and thus to undergo the conversion into FGly. To provide evidence of this conversion, we applied MALDI-TOF analysis to the peptides released from a trypsin/CNBr digestion. We clearly obtained two relevant peptides, labeled Cys-51–71 and FGly-51–71 (Fig. 2A). The former has a molecular mass of 2263.96 Da and thus corresponds to the peptide 51ATEGYNFENAYTAVPSCIASR71 (theoretical molecular mass of 2264.03 Da) containing the critical cysteine Cys-67; the latter has a molecular mass of 2246.03 Da, i.e. 18 Da less, as expected from the conversion of the cysteine residue into FGly (Fig. 2A). To ascertain the nature of the modification undergone by the peptide 51–71, we performed MALDI-TOF analysis using DNPH as a matrix. Indeed, FGly-containing peptides specifically react with DNPH to form a hydrazone derivative with a mass increment of 180 Da (23Peng J. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Dierks T. J. Mass Spectrom. 2003; 38: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). With the DNPH matrix a new peptide with the expected molecular mass of 2425.95 Da appeared (Fig. 2B). Nevertheless, in E. coli, the overexpressed sulfatase was only partially maturated, as we were able to detect a large amount of the nonmaturated peptide Cys-51–71 (Fig. 2). Thus, the protein encoded by the cpe0231 gene, as with all the sulfatases studied to date, is endowed with a conversion of its critical residue into FGly. However, this sulfatase possesses the sequence “FGlyXAXR” at its active site, whereas the other known sulfatases, regardless of their origin (i.e. prokaryotic or eukaryotic) or their type (Ser-type or Cys-type), bear the sequence FGlyXPXR. Cloning and Sulfatase Maturation Activity of the cpe0635 Gene—C. perfringens does not encode any FGE-type enzyme, the only Cys-type maturation enzyme identified to date. Nevertheless, an examination of C. perfringens genome revealed the existence of the gene cpe0635, located almost 500 kbp downstream of the sulfatase gene. This gene codes for a protein that shares homology (48%) with AtsB, the maturation enzyme of Ser-type sulfatases in Klebsiella pneumoniae (14Szameit C. Miech C. Balleininger M. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Dierks T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15375-15381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). AtsB has been described to be strictly dependent on the presence of an N-terminal signal peptide and on a critical serine residue in the sulfatase active site (24Marquordt C. Fang Q. Will E. Peng J. von Figura K. Dierks T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2212-2218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), both features being absent with C. perfringens sulfatase. We cloned CPE0635 into a plasmid allowing co-expression with the C. perfringens sulfatase gene in E. coli BL21 (DE3). As shown in Fig. 3 (lane B), we obtain an efficient co-expression of both proteins. As only the sulfatase bears a His tag, it was easily purified and further analyzed to check if co-expression with the cpe0635 gene enhanced the sulfatase maturation. MALDI-TOF analysis revealed that when co-expressed with the cpe0635 gene, the sulfatase was fully mature because no immature Cys-51–71 peptide could be detected (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, analysis with the DNPH matrix confirmed the nature and the efficiency of the maturation, as the signal originating from the peptide “FGly-DNPH” dominates the MALDI-TOF spectrum (Fig. 4B). As a consequence of a more efficient maturation, the specific activity of C. perfringens sulfatase increased more than 6-fold, rising from 0.08 to 0.53 μmol·min−1·mg−1. “CXAXR” Sulfatases in Other Bacteria—We searched to see if the C. perfringens sulfatase motif CXAXR exists in other potential microbial sulfatases. For this purpose we performed a blast search, using the following motif (CS)XAXR, in all the bacterial genomes sequenced thus far. Only sequences that have significant homologies to authentic sulfatases were further considered. We found several genes encoding potential sulfatases lacking the consensus proline at position 3 of the sulfatase signature. These genes were found in 22 bacterial species corresponding to the major bacterial phyla (Fig. 5): Proteobacteria (Bordetella, Bradyrhizobium, Colwellia, Mesorhizobium, Novosphingobium, Pseudoalteromonas, Pseudomonas, Ralstonia, Shewanella, Silicibacter, Sinorhizobium, and Vibrio), Planctomycetes (Rhodopirellula), Cyanobacteria (Crocosphaera), Bacteroidetes (Bacteroides), and in two new phyla regarded until recently as deprived of sulfatases (17Sardiello M. Annunziata I. Roma G. Ballabio A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 3203-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These phyla are the large phylum of the Firmicutes and the recently described phylum of the Acidobacteria (25Quaiser A. Ochsenreiter T. Lanz C. Schuster S.C. Treusch A.H. Eck J. Schleper C. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). We also identified potential sulfatases with the CXAXR motif in one archaeal genus, Methanosarcina. Examination of the genomes encoding sulfatases with the CXAXR motif revealed various situations. Some genomes, as those of C. perfringens or Methanosarcina mazei, only encode sulfatases with the CXAXR motif, whereas others, as those of Rhodopirellula baltica or Solibacter usitatus, encode both types of cysteine sulfatases, i.e. with either the “CXPXR” or the CXAXR motif. Finally, we also found, although less frequently, genomes encoding potential serine sulfatases with an “SXAXR” motif, as exemplified by Vibrio parahemeolyticus, Vibrio vulnificus, and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. In a search for enzymes from C. perfringens able to hydrolyze sulfated compounds, namely glucosinolates (18Fahey J.W. Zalcmann A.T. Talalay P. Phytochemistry. 2001; 56: 5-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (2168) Google Scholar, 26Leoni O. Iori R. Haddoum T. Marlier M. Wathetet J.P. Rollin P. Palmieri S. Ind. Crops Prod. 1998; 7: 335-343Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we found that a protein extract of C. perfringens exhibits a sulfatase activity toward the synthetic substrate PNP-S. Analysis of the genome of C. perfringens showed no genes annotated as “sulfatase” (22Shimizu T. Ohtani K. Hirakawa H. Ohshima K. Yamashita A. Shiba T. Ogasawara N. Hattori M. Kuhara S. Hayashi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 996-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), and we found no protein with the so-called sulfatase signature (C/S)XPXR (17Sardiello M. Annunziata I. Roma G. Ballabio A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 3203-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 27Hanson S.R. Best M.D. Wong C.H. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

A. 2006; 103: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This result was expected as Clostridia and the Firmicutes in general are regarded as devoid of sulfatases (17Sardiello M. Annunziata I. Roma G. Ballabio A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 3203-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we identified the cpe0231 gene as a potential sulfatase-coding gene. This gene encodes a protein that possesses a CXAXR motif instead of the consensus motif (C/S)XPXR. Previous studies have clearly established that this substitution (alanine for proline) prevents sulfatases maturation (15Dierks T. Schmidt B. VonFigura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11963-11968Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 16Dierks T. Lecca M.R. Schlotterhose P. Schmidt B. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2084-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) leading to the current definition of the sulfatase signature (17Sardiello M. Annunziata I. Roma G. Ballabio A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 3203-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 27Hanson S.R. Best M.D. Wong C.H. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2004; 43: 5736-5763Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the purified protein exhibited sulfatase activity and shares many common features with sulfatases described previously. Its activity is increased by calcium, a co-factor found in most of the active sites of sulfatases studied thus far (6Bond C.S. Clements P.R. Ashby S.J. Collyer C.A. Harrop S.J. Hopwood J.J. Guss J.M.

A. 1997; 94: 11963-11968Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), namely the conversion of the cysteine residue present in the new motif CXAXR into a FGly. The sulfatase from C. perfringens is thus an authentic sulfatase bearing the motif FGlyXAXR in its active site and should be classified in the IUBMB subclass of arylsulfatases (EC 3.1.6.1). These results rule out the current paradigm defining the sulfatase signature (17Sardiello M. Annunziata I. Roma G. Ballabio A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 3203-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 27Hanson S.R. Best M.D. Wong C.H. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2004; 43: 5736-5763Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) and demonstrate that the definition of the sulfatase signature should be expanded to include the novel motif CXAXR. Our results also indicate that the number of genes encoding sulfatases and of bacterial species bearing sulfatase enzymes is currently underestimated. This has biochemical significance because recent findings highlight the involvement of sulfatases in the pathogenic properties of bacteria (29Mougous J.D. Green R.E. Williams S.J. Brenner S.E. Bertozzi C.R. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 767-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 30Hoffman J.A. Badger J.L. Zhang Y. Huang S.H. Kim K.S. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5062-5067Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Our study also brings new data in the general scheme of prokaryote sulfatase maturation. Until now it was considered that the maturation of sulfatases is dependent on two enzymatic systems, according to the nature of the amino acid residue encoded in the active site. The first, which has attracted considerable attention, is FGE, an oxygen-dependent oxidoreductase found from prokaryotes to eukaryotes (12Cosma M.P. Pepe S. Annunziata I. Newbold R.F. Grompe M. Parenti G. Ballabio A. Cell. 2003; 113: 445-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 13Dierks T. Schmidt B. Borissenko L.V. Peng J.H. Preusser A.

Gene (Amst.). 2003; 316: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This enzyme is the only one described to date able to convert cysteine into FGly (12Cosma M.P. Pepe S. Annunziata I.

Schmidt B. Mariappan M. von Figura K. Ficner R. Rudolph M.G. Cell. 2005; 121: 541-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The other system, which accounts for the maturation of Ser-type sulfatases, is called AtsB and probably belongs to the radical S-adenosyl-l-methionine enzyme superfamily (34Sofia H.J. Chen G. Hetzler B.G. Reyes-Spindola J.F. Miller N.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). AtsB has been reported previously to be specific of sulfatases bearing the SXPXR motif and to be strictly dependent on the presence of a signal peptide (24Marquordt C. Fang Q. Will E. Peng J. von Figura K. Dierks T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2212-2218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid assays have shown that the presence of cysteine instead of a serine in the active site disrupted AtsB/Sulfatase interactions (24Marquordt C. Fang Q. Will E. Peng J. von Figura K. Dierks T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2212-2218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 35Fang Q. Peng J. Dierks T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14570-14578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) preventing further maturation of the enzyme. In C. perfringens we were unable to identify any FGE-related protein able to account for the physiological maturation of the cloned Cys-type sulfatase. Surprisingly, we identified a gene encoding a protein showing high homology with AtsB, the enzyme responsible for the maturation of Ser-type sulfatases. AtsB and the enzyme found in C. perfringens not only have high sequence identity but also bear the CX3CX2C motif, which is a signature for radical S-adenosyl-l-methionine enzymes (34Sofia H.J. Chen G. Hetzler B.G. Reyes-Spindola J.F. Miller N.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Co-expression of both genes, encoding the sulfatase and the putative maturation enzyme, led to a fully maturated sulfatase. Thus, in vivo, C. perfringens sulfatase is not modified by an FGE-type enzyme but by an enzyme closer to the Ser-type sulfatase maturation machinery. The Cys-type maturating enzyme identified in C. perfringens strongly differs from the other Cys-type maturating enzyme (FGE) because it is able to catalyze the conversion of cysteine into FGly under strict anaerobic conditions. Indeed, FGE has been reported recently to be strictly dependent on molecular oxygen (28Roeser D. Preusser-Kunze A. Schmidt B. Gasow K. Wittmann J.G. Dierks T. von Figura K. Rudolph M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 33Dierks T. Dickmanns A. Preusser-Kunze A. Schmidt B. Mariappan M. von Figura K. Ficner R. Rudolph M.G. Cell. 2005; 121: 541-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), which raised the question of how Cys-type sulfatases can be maturated in anaerobic or facultative aerobic bacteria? The new maturation enzyme identified in C. perfringens, a strictly anaerobic microorganism, answers this question, at least in part, and provides evidence that Cys-type sulfatases can be maturated by oxygen-independent oxidoreductases. Supporting this conclusion, a search among sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes showed that strict anaerobes never bear FGE-related genes but rather AtsB-related genes like many facultative anaerobes such as E. coli. Until now it was unclear why E. coli, while being deprived of any FGE-related enzyme, is able to mature Cys-type sulfatases (36Beil S. Kehrli H. James P. Staudenmann W. Cook A.M. Leisinger T. Kertesz M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 37Myette J.R. Shriver Z. Claycamp C. McLean M.W. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12157-12166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This led to the hypothesis of the existence of a yet unidentified system responsible for the maturation of Cys-type sulfatases among prokaryotes (11Dierks T. Miech C. Hummerjohann J. Schmidt B.

Dierks T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15375-15381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Our findings, in agreement with the recent bio-computing study of Ballabio and co-workers (17Sardiello M. Annunziata I. Roma G. Ballabio A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 3203-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), demonstrate that bacteria such as C. perfringens, which possess only enzymes related to AtsB, are able to maturate Cys-type sulfatases. Thus, it is tempting to hypothesize that a similar pathway accounts for the maturation of a Cys-type sulfatase in E. coli, which possesses two AtsB-related genes. We thus propose a new scheme for sulfatase maturation among prokaryotes (Fig. 6). In this new scheme, sulfatase maturation is based on oxygen-dependent (FGE) versus oxygen-independent (AtsB, CPE0635) machineries, rather than amino acid specific enzymes as currently stated (17Sardiello M. Annunziata I. Roma G. Ballabio A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 3203-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 27Hanson S.R. Best M.D. Wong C.H. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

We propose that AtsB and CPE0635 belong to the same family that we suggest to name anSME (i.e. anaerobic sulfatase maturation enzyme). In our proposed sulfatase maturation pathway, anSMEs are able to modify both types of sulfatases (i.e. Cys- and Ser-types), and FGE is strictly dedicated to the maturation of Cys-type sulfatases in aerobic organisms. We thank Jon K. Rubach for critical reading of this manuscript."

However, the normal function for TEM8 remains unknown. We show that TEM8 functions as an adhesion molecule mediating cell spreading on immobilized PA and collagen I. The mechanism for TEM8 interaction with collagen I was cell type-specific, because binding to collagen I was abrogated by β1 integrin function blocking antibody in HEK293 cells, but not in primary synovial rabbit fibroblasts. Binding to PA remained unaffected by the addition of β1 integrin function blocking antibody. Whereas the extracellular and transmembrane domains of TEM8 were sufficient to provide cell attachment, the intracellular domain was critical for spreading. Fusion of the cytosolic domain of TEM8 to the IL-2 receptor, conferred cell-spreading capability on IL-2 receptor antibody substrates. The cytoplasmic domain mediated linkage with the actin cytoskeleton as it co-precipitated actin and determined partitioning of TEM8 to the actin-containing detergent insoluble cellular fraction. TEM8 anchorage to actin was relevant as spreading was inhibited by the cytoskeleton-disrupting drug cytochalasin D, but persisted in the presence of the microtubule-depolymerizing drug nocodazole, and in cells lacking intermediate filaments.

Thus, our results indicate that TEM8 is a new adhesion molecule linking collagen I or PA to the actin cytoskeleton. The rapid and fatal course of Bacillus anthracis sepsis results from the massive release of the bacterial codified proteins, Protective Antigen (PA), 2The abbreviations used are: PA, Protective Antigen; IL, interleukin; ECM, extracellular matrix; TEM, tumor endothelium marker; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; LF, Lethal Factor; EF, Edema Factor; MA, Matrigel; BSA, bovine serum albumin; HEK, human embryonic kidney.2The abbreviations used are: PA, Protective Antigen; IL, interleukin; ECM, extracellular matrix; TEM, tumor endothelium marker; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; LF, Lethal Factor; EF, Edema Factor; MA, Matrigel; BSA, bovine serum albumin; HEK, human embryonic kidney. Lethal Factor (LF), and Edema Factor (EF), which assemble into a toxic complex at the cell surface. Susceptible cells express receptors that bind the PA component of the toxin. Upon binding, furin-like proteases at the cell surface process PA, triggering oligomerization and exposure of sites that bind the catalytic components of the toxin, Lethal Factor and Edema Factor (reviewed in Ref. 1Collier R.J. Young J.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 45-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The tripartite toxic complex is internalized via lipid rafts and directed to endosomal compartments. In endosomes, the acidic pH triggers PA-heptamer insertion into the membrane to form a pore that translocates LF and EF into the cytosol (2Abrami L. Liu S. Cosson P. Leppla S.H. van der Goot F.G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Although much is known about the mechanism by which the toxin enters the cell, less is known about the targets of LF and EF in the cytosol and the consequences of their activity for toxicity. Edema factor is a calmodulin-dependent adenylyl cyclase, raising the intracellular concentration of cAMP and thereby leading to tissue edema (3Leppla S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3162-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). LF is a metalloprotease that cleaves most mitogen-activated protein kinase isoforms (4Duesbery N.S. Webb C.P. Leppla S.H. Gordon V.M. Klimpel K.R. Copeland T.D. Ahn N.G. Oskarsson M.K. Fukasawa K. Paull K.D. Vande Woude G.F. Science. 1998; 280: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). The PA-binding receptors play a mayor role in toxin activity by directing assembly on target cells and insertion site of the oligomer into the membrane along endosomal compartments (5Lacy D.B.

However, binding of PA to the receptors could have additional still unrecognized roles in anthrax pathogenesis associated with the normal, yet unexplored, function of these receptors. Two different cellular receptors mediate anthrax toxin entry to the cells: anthrax receptor 1 (ATR1), also called tumor endothelium marker 8 (TEM8) (7Bradley K.A. Mogridge J. Mourez M. Collier R.J. Young J.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar); and ATR2, also known as capillary morphogenetic protein 2 (CMG2) (8Scobie H.M. Rainey G.J. Bradley K.A. Young J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5170-5174Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). TEM8 was identified by its increased expression in tumor-associated endothelial cells (9St Croix B. Rago C. Velculescu V. Traverso G. Romans K.E. Montgomery E. Lal A. Riggins G.J. Lengauer C. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 2000; 289: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar) and, therefore, has been proposed as a candidate molecule to target antitumor therapies (10Liu S. Redeye V. Kuremsky J.G. Kuhnen M. Molinolo A. Bugge T.H. Leppla S.H. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Antibody-based evidence suggests that TEM8 is also expressed in tissues where the bacterium spores enter the organism, such as skin, lungs, and small intestine (11Bonuccelli G. Sotgia F. Frank P.G. Williams T.M. de Almeida C.J. Tanowitz H.B. Scherer P.E. Hotchkiss K.A. Terman B.I. Rollman B. Alileche A. Brojatsch J. Lisanti M.P. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2005; 288: C1402-C1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The soluble extracellular domain of TEM8 binds to collagen type 1 and gelatin (12Hotchkiss K.A. Basile C.M. Spring S.C. Bonuccelli G. Lisanti M.P. Terman B.I. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 305: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and co-immunoprecipitates with the C5 domain of collagen α3 (VI) (13Nanda A. Carson-Walter E.B. Seaman S. Barber T.D. Stampfl J. Singh S. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. St Croix B. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 817-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This evidence suggests interaction with molecules of the extracellular matrix (ECM); however the implications of these interactions for cell adhesion remain undetermined. TEM8 also increases endothelial cell chemotactic activity on collagen substrata; however the mechanism for this function remains unclear (12Hotchkiss K.A. Basile C.M. Spring S.C. Bonuccelli G. Lisanti M.P. Terman B.I. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 305: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The second receptor, CMG2, is robustly induced during capillary tube formation in collagen gels and has a more ubiquitous pattern of expression than TEM8 (14Bell S.E. Mavila A. Salazar R. Bayless K.J. Kanagala S. Maxwell S.A. Davis G.E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2755-2773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CMG2 extracellular domain shows binding activity to collagen type IV and laminin (14Bell S.E. Mavila A. Salazar R. Bayless K.J. Kanagala S. Maxwell S.A. Davis G.E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2755-2773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, genetic mutations identified in juvenile hyaline fibromatosis and infantile systemic hyalinosis show reduced fibroblast adhesion to laminin substrates but not to collagen I or collagen IV (15Dowling O. Difeo A. Ramirez M.C. Tukel T. Narla G. Bonafe L. Kayserili H. Yuksel-Apak M. Paller A.S. Norton K. Teebi A.S. Grum-Tokars V. Martin G.S. Davis G.E. Glucksman M.J. Martignetti J.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 73: 957-966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Both receptors are type I transmembrane proteins sharing a 60% homology at the amino acid level, concentrated in a von Willebrand factor type A (VWA) domain similar to the inserted (I) domain present in a subset of integrins. This domain includes a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) motif necessary for cation-dependent binding of PA, functionally similar to the binding of ECM proteins to integrin (16Bradley K.A. Mogridge J. Jonah G. Rainey A. Batty S. Young J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49342-49347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In contrast, much less is known about the function of the cytosolic domain of both receptors, for which at least three different variants can be generated by differential splicing (7Bradley K.A. Mogridge J. Mourez M. Collier R.J. Young J.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 8Scobie H.M. Rainey G.J. Bradley K.A. Young J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5170-5174Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). In silico analysis reveals that TEM8 has a consensus signal for basolateral sorting and for phosphorylation. The cytosolic domain is palmitoylated and ubiquitinated, modifications controlling endocytosis of the receptor (17Abrami L. Leppla S.H. van der Goot F.G. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, no other known protein motifs or interacting proteins have been described so far that could give additional clues about the function of the receptor cytosolic domain. Importantly, whereas this domain is not required for toxin delivery (18Liu S. Leppla S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5227-5234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), it could potentially play a determinant role in regulating receptor localization or contribute to the host response triggered by toxin internalization. Given the interaction of the extracellular domain of TEM8 with ECM molecules and TEM8 modulation of cell chemotactic activity, we decided to test the hypothesis that TEM8 functions as an adhesion molecule, directly linking extracellular ligands with the cytoskeleton. Using engineered chimeric receptors containing either the extracellular or intracellular domains of TEM8, we analyzed the role of these domains in linking proteins of the extracellular milieu with the actin cytoskeleton. Our results indicate that the cytosolic domain of TEM8 mediates actin-dependent cell spreading when binding to the immobilized ligand. Cells, Plasmids, Transfections, and Adenoviral Infections—Stably full-length TEM8 or extracellular domain TEM8- (18Liu S. Leppla S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5227-5234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) expressing cell lines were obtained by selection of hygromycin-resistant HEK293 cells (QB1-293 from Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA). HEK293 cells transiently expressing TEM8, IL-2R, IL-2RVE cadherin CD or IL-2R/TEM8-CD were obtained by 14-h infection with recombinant adenoviruses. The recombinant adenoviruses were prepared according to published methods (19He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar) by subcloning TEM8 HA from pIRES using the sites BsrG1 and EcoRV into the EcoRV site of pShuttle CMV (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The IL-2 R/TEM8-CD was constructed by addition of a HindIII site to the 5′-side of the cytosolic domain of TEM8 by PCR using the 5′-primer CACCAAGCTTTGCTGCACTGTGATTATCAAGGAGGTCCC. The PCR product was cloned into pcDNA3 and then subcloned into pAdTrack vector containing IL-2R with an engineered HindIII site at the 3′-end (23Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24233-24236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The construct was sequenced, and expression was verified by Western blot using anti-TEM8 antibody (Imgenex, San Diego, CA) and anti-IL-2R (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit synovial fibroblasts were isolated and used as described before (20Werner E. Werb Z. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Substrate Coating—Plastic dishes and glass coverslips were coated with 1% heat-inactivated bovine serum albumin, 10 μg/ml PA, 10 μg/ml anti-IL-2 receptor monoclonal antibody (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA) in PBS, 20 μg/ml of collagen I in 0.02 m HAc or Matrigel (MA, BD Biosciences) diluted 1:40 in DME (Cellgro, Hendon, VA) for 4 h at room temperature. After a PBS wash, plates were blocked for 20 min with heat-inactivated 0.3% BSA in PBS. Excess of BSA and other proteins was removed by three washes with PBS. Cell Attachment Assay—Cells were released with trypsin, resuspended in serum-free DME (if not stated otherwise) at a concentration ranging 350,000 to 500,000 cells/ml and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C before adding 100 μl of cell suspension to substrate-coated MaxiSorb 96 wells Immuno Plate (Nunc, Rochester, NY) for the indicated time at 37 °C. After binding, the plate was washed three times by immersion in PBS supplemented with Ca2+ and Mg2+. The attached cells were quantitated by crystal violet staining and dye solubilization. Percentage of attachment was calculated considering 0% the readings obtained by binding to BSA and 100% the readings obtained using Matrigel. Binding to Matrigel was high, unaltered by transfection or infection and directly related to the amount of cells seeded. Thus these readings were used to correct for the number of cells competent to bind between the different cell groups. The cells were preincubated for 5 min with the blocking antibodies before adding them to the coated plates. The anti-human β1 blocking antibody clone P5D2 was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The antibodies AIIB2 and BIIG2 were developed by Dr. Damsky and were used protein G-purified (in spreading assay) or from concentrate obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (Iowa University) in the cell attachment assay. Cell Spreading—Cells were trypsinized, resuspended in DME, and incubated for the indicated time on substrate-coated glass coverslips. The drugs cytochalasin D and nocodazole were obtained from Sigma and Calbiochem (EMD Biosciences, La Jolla, CA), respectively. Unattached cells were washed with PBS, and the remaining cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 20 min and embedded in gelvatol. Fields selected at random were photographed at ×20 magnification under phase contrast in a Leica fluorescence microscope (model DMR-E) equipped with narrow band pass filters and a camera (model Orca; Hamamatsu). Images were captured and processed using Open Lab software (Improvision Inc.). Spreading area of 100 cells selected at random, was measured by registering the pixel area covered by the cell body, excluding filopodia and thin protrusions using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging, Dowingtown, PA). The distribution plots were obtained by determining the number of cells included in 500 pixels sized bins ranging from 0 to the maximum pixel area measured in the experiment. Step plots were produced in Kaleidagraph 3.6 (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). The arrows mark the value of the median. MEK1 Cleavage Assay—Cells were incubated for the indicated time with a mixture of 1 μg/ml of PA and 0.1 μg/ml of LF (List Biological Laboratories, Inc., Campbell, CA) in DME supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The selective cleavage of the N terminus domain of MEK1 (MAPKK-1) was detected by Western blot analysis with antibodies directed to the N terminus (Nt MEK1) (Upstate Biotechnology, Charlottesville, VA) and compared with the existing MEK1 detected by probing after blot stripping with an antibody recognizing the C terminus (Ct MEK1) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cytoskeleton Association Assay—Cells were plated on substrate-coated dishes for the indicated time, and the soluble proteins were extracted following the procedure described by Ref. 21Schliwa M. van Blerkom J. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 90: 222-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, using a 5-min extraction with 0.15% Triton X-100 in 360 mm piperazine diethanesulfonic acid, 25 mm HEPES, 10 mm ethyl-eneglycol bis(3-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 2mm MgCI2, pH 6.9 buffer and antiproteases on ice. Laemmli sample buffer with antiproteases was used to recover Triton-insoluble proteins (I) and to equalize the volume of the Triton-solubilized proteins (S) to the (I) fraction. The proteins present in comparable proportion of each fraction were analyzed by Western blot using antibodies anti-β actin, tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich), and IL-2R (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Solubility index was determined by densitometric analysis of the bands using NIH Image Software and defined as (Triton-soluble/Triton-insoluble) - 1. Co-immunoprecipitation and Immunofluorescence—Cells were lysed in buffer A (22Styers M.L. Salazar G. Love R. Peden A.A. Kowalczyk A.P. Faundez V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5369-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and equal amounts of protein were added to protein G beads preincubated with monoclonal anti-IL-2R or anti-HA (Roche Applied Science). After washing, the immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE using non-reducing sample buffer to avoid interference of the immunoglobulin chains with actin and tubulin detection. Cells were processed for immunofluorescence as described before (22Styers M.L. Salazar G. Love R. Peden A.A. Kowalczyk A.P. Faundez V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5369-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Actin filaments were stained with Alexa 568-conjugated Phalloidin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The specimens were viewed using an Axiovert 100 m confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss) coupled to a HeNe1 and Argon ion lasers and equipped with BP 565-615 and BP 500-550IR filters and a Plan Apochromat ×63/1.4 oil DiC objective with filters. Images were acquired using LSM 500 sp1 software (Carl Zeiss). Statistics—Error bars in the graphs represent S.E. The distribution of the spreading area data and cell attachment were considered to be parametric; therefore, significance was determined applying a two-tailed Student's t test assuming equal variance. To determine whether TEM8 could function as an adhesion molecule, we used PA as a known TEM8 ligand to engage its extracellular domain. PA interacts with the MIDAS motif in the integrin-like inserted domain of TEM8 in a similar manner as ligands of ECM interact with integrins (16Bradley K.A. Mogridge J. Jonah G. Rainey A. Batty S. Young J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49342-49347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), thus we tested whether PA would engage TEM8 when immobilized on a surface. HA-tagged TEM8 was expressed in HEK293 cells, which lack detectable levels of endogenous full-length TEM8 ((13Nanda A. Carson-Walter E.B. Seaman S. Barber T.D. Stampfl J. Singh S. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. St Croix B. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 817-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and Fig. 1A, compare lanes 1 and 2). When added in soluble form together with LF, PA binding triggers lethal toxin internalization and LF translocation into the cytosol, resulting in the N-terminal cleavage of MEK1. MEK1 cleavage occurred earlier in TEM8-expressing cells than in non-transfected cells (Control, Fig. 1B). This result confirms the expression of a functional PA receptor at the cell surface that is competent to deliver toxin into cells. When PA was used to coat plastic dishes, mimicking an ECM substrate, TEM8-expressing cells showed increased attachment activity modulated by the presence of divalent cation (Fig. 1C). Maximum attachment to PA occurred in the presence of 1 mm Mn2+, both in PBS or in DME media, whereas Mg2+ and Ca2+ had less effect, results consistent with the known cation selectivity profile for PA binding to TEM8 (16Bradley K.A. Mogridge J. Jonah G. Rainey A. Batty S. Young J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49342-49347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Non-transfected cells attachment to PA increased by Mn2+ addition, which could be caused by a low level expression of short variants of TEM8 or by CMG2, not detected with our antibodies. However, this background activity did not become evident in the spreading assay (see below). Upon attachment to PA tethered to a surface, TEM8 induced wide-spread cell shape changes and cell body extension. Spreading area was quantitated as the number of pixels covered by the cell body and expressed in frequency distribution histograms. Within 30 min of plating on PA or collagen type I, a recently described endogenous ligand for the extracellular domain of TEM8 (12Hotchkiss K.A. Basile C.M. Spring S.C. Bonuccelli G. Lisanti M.P. Terman B.I. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 305: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), either stably expressing cell lines (Fig. 1D) or transiently TEM8-expressing cells (Fig. 3, C and D) covered a significantly larger area than non-transfected cells (Fig. 1D, compare dashed versus continuous lines, p < 0.001). Collagen I promoted cell spreading with efficiency comparable to PA, as the cell areas did not significantly differ when spread on either substrate (p = 0.5). The fact that cell spreading occurs upon attachment to two different immobilized ligands, indicates that this attribute is not unique to the interaction of TEM8 with PA. Spreading on tethered ligands is a hallmark of adhesion molecules associated with the cytoskeleton. Linkage to the cytoskeleton could occur directly through the cytosolic domain or indirectly through association with other transmembrane molecules. Many cell surface proteins cooperate and modulate the adhesive function of integrins (reviewed in Refs. 23Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24233-24236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 24Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 130-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 25Hemler M.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 801-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Therefore, to define whether there is a possible functional cooperation between TEM8 and integrins to accomplish cell spreading, we sought to disrupt the function of collagen binding integrins, which mostly belong to β1 family of integrins, with β1 integrin-blocking antibodies (26Gullberg D. Gehlsen K.R. Turner D.C. Ahlen K. Zijenah L.S. Barnes M.J. Rubin K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3865-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). TEM8 expression in HEK293 did not increase overall cell attachment to collagen (Fig. 2A), most likely because of the high endogenous collagen attachment activity, which was evident even in the absence of added Mn2+. Interestingly, addition of a β1 function-blocking antibody (P5D2) abrogated completely attachment to collagen, without modifying binding activity to PA. As a control, we used BIIG2, which is a rat monoclonal antibody that interferes with human α5β1 integrin binding to fibronectin (27Werb Z. Tremble P.M. Behrendtsen O. Crowley E. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar) without affecting binding to collagen. To examine further whether TEM8 expression can increase cell attachment to collagen, we used next a different cell type, primary rabbit synovial fibroblasts, because they are efficiently infected with adenovirus and this cell type uses α1 and α2β1 integrins to bind collagen I when integrins are activated with divalent cations, (26Gullberg D. Gehlsen K.R. Turner D.C. Ahlen K. Zijenah L.S. Barnes M.J. Rubin K. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3865-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). TEM8 expression increased cell attachment to collagen in the absence of added Mn2+ (Fig. 2B). Upon Mn2+ addition, binding was elevated with or without TEM8 expression. Addition of the β1-blocking antibodies P5D2 and AIIB2, competed for attachment of control cells in a small but significant proportion (p < 0.05), without affecting attachment of TEM8-expressing cells to collagen or to PA. BIIG2 did not affect attachment. These contrasting effects of the β1 blocking antibodies were more apparent in spreading assays. We measured spreading of control or TEM8 adenovirus infected cells on collagen I (Fig. 2C) in the absence or presence of the β1 integrin function-perturbing antibody AIIB2 (Fig. 2C). After 1 h, TEM8-expressing fibroblasts spread significantly more efficiently than non-infected cells (p < 0.001). Interference with β1 integrin function using AIIB2, reduced cell spreading of non-infected (control) cells (compare full line versus dashed line in left panel of Fig. 2C, p < 0.001), but did not affect TEM8-expressing fibroblast spreading on collagen I, in right panel of Fig. 2C (p > 0.1). Furthermore, selectively modifying α5β1 integrin (fibronectin receptor) function with BIIG2 (light line) did not affect spreading of control cells (p > 0.1) nor TEM8-expressing cells (p > 0.1), indicating that the inhibition by the anti-β1 antibody is integrin-selective. Thus, these experiments suggest that the participation of β1 integrins can be excluded in TEM8-mediated cell spreading on collagen in primary fibroblasts. However, collectively, they indicate that the participation of these integrins in TEM8 spreading on collagen vary with cell type. The activity of TEM8 as an adhesion molecule predicts that TEM8 lacking the cytosolic domain will not be sufficient to mediate cell spreading. HEK293 cells expressing a construct comprising the extracellular and transmembrane domains only (ED-TEM8, 1-343 amino acids), were more susceptible to lethal toxin than non-transfected cells as assessed by MEK1 cleavage (Fig. 3A). These results are consistent with published studies showing that the extracellular domain tethered to the plasma membrane is sufficient to mediate toxin internalization (18Liu S. Leppla S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5227-5234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In fact, MEK1 was cleaved at a similar rate as in full-length TEM8-expressing cells (Fig. 3A), suggesting comparable expression levels of both receptors. Like TEM8, ED-TEM8 expression increased cell attachment to PA-coated plates (Fig. 3B). However, ED-TEM8 failed to promote cell spreading as assessed by direct observation by phase contrast microscopy (Fig. 3C). ED-TEM8-expressing cells did not extend on PA-coated dishes after 1 h of plating, although they were fully capable of spreading on MA, a complex mixture of ECM proteins found in basement membranes that engages multiple adhesion molecules (Fig. 3D). These experiments indicate that the extracellular domain of TEM8 is sufficient to mediate cell attachment and toxin internalization, but not cell spreading, thus implicating the essential role for the cytosolic domain in cell spreading. To directly test the role of the intracellular domain in cell spreading, the cytosolic domain of TEM8 (TEM8-CD) was fused to the extracellular domain of the IL-2 receptor α-subunit (IL-2R). IL-2R is a cell surface molecule involved in signal transduction, with no reported role in adhesion or cell shape control; thus, it has been widely used to study the role of cytosolic domains of other adhesion molecules (28LaFlamme S.E. Thomas L.A. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 29Meredith Jr., J.E. Kiosses W.B. Takada Y. Schwartz M.A. J. Biol.

The addition of TEM8-CD to the IL-2 receptor shifted the molecular weight of IL-2R from 55 to 80 kDa (Fig. 4A) and imparted immunoreactivity to the anti-TEM8 cytosolic epitope antibody (Fig. 4A). Expression of IL-2R, as well as IL-2R/TEM8-CD chimera, conferred specific cell attachment to dishes coated with a monoclonal antibody against t"

Among the other 36, 29 mutants exhibited completely abolished or strongly inhibited Ca2+-ATPase activity, whereas the other seven possessed fairly high or normal ATPase activity. In four of the aforementioned seven mutants, Ca2+ transport activity was significantly reduced or almost completely lost, therefore uncoupled from ATP hydrolysis. The other three were exceptional cases as they were seemingly normal in protein expression and Ca2+ transport function, but were found to have abnormalities in the kinetic properties altered by the three mutations, which happened to be in the three DD pedigrees found by us previously (Sato, K., Yamasaki, K., Daiho, T., Miyauchi, Y., Takahashi, H., Ishida-Yamamoto, A., Nakamura, S., Iizuka, H., and Suzuki, H. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 35595-35603). Collectively, our results indicated that in most cases (48 of 51) DD mutations cause severe disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis by the defects in protein expression and/or transport function and hence DD, but even a slight disturbance of the homeostasis will result in the disease. Our results also provided further insight into the structure-function relationship of SERCAs and revealed critical regions and residues of the enzyme. We examined possible defects of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 2b (SERCA2b) associated with its 51 mutations found in Darier disease (DD) pedigrees, i.e. most of the substitution and deletion mutations of residues reported so far. COS-1 cells were transfected with each of the mutant cDNAs, and the expression and function of the SERCA2b protein was analyzed with microsomes prepared from the cells and compared with those of the wild type. Fifteen mutants showed markedly reduced expression. Among the other 36, 29 mutants exhibited completely abolished or strongly inhibited Ca2+-ATPase activity, whereas the other seven possessed fairly high or normal ATPase activity.

SERCAs have three cytoplasmic domains: phosphorylation (P), nucleotide binding (N), and actuator (A) and 10 transmembrane helices (M1-M10 or 11 in the SERCA2b isoform, M11). In the Ca2+ transport cycle, the ATPase is activated by the binding of two Ca2+ ions from the cytoplasm to the transport sites composed of M4, M5, M6, and M8 (E2 → E1Ca2, step 1). Asp351 in the P domain is then phosphorylated with MgATP to form the phosphorylated intermediate (EP) (step 2). During dephosphorylation of EP, the Ca2+ ions are released into the lumen. In the detailed mechanism, the dephosphorylation process includes the conformational transition of EP associated with Ca2+ release (step 3) and the subsequent hydrolysis of the acylphosphate bond (step 4).

The mutations are located throughout the SERCA2b molecule and show no “hot spots” on the primary sequence. To understand how each of the substitution and deletion mutations affects SERCA2b protein, a limited number of mutations had been explored (9 by Ahn et al. (25Ahn W. Lee M.G. Kim K.H. Muallem S. J.

To provide a comprehensive insight into the molecular basis of DD, as well as to understand the basis for each case of the DD pedigrees, it is necessary to analyze further the many unexplored substitution and deletion mutations. We therefore carried out in this study a comprehensive analysis of the expression and function of most of the DD causing substitution and deletion mutations reported, i.e. the 51 mutations shown in Fig. 2. Our results showed that most of the mutations (48 of the 51) cause severe defects in protein expression and/or Ca2+ transport function. The loss of the transport function was ascribed to markedly reduced ATP hydrolysis or uncoupling from ATP hydrolysis. The remaining three mutations were exceptional in that they exhibited seemingly normal protein expression and Ca2+ transport function but with altered kinetic properties. Results therefore indicated diverse molecular defects as the cause of DD in the 51 pedigrees. On the basis of the atomic structures of SERCA1a, our results also provided further insight into the structure-function relationship of SERCAs.FIGURE 2Locations of DD mutations examined in this study on the secondary structure model of SERCA2b (a) and on the atomic structure of SERCA1a (b). a, the residues with the 51 DD mutations examined in this study are indicated by red circles (substitutions) and dotted red circles (deletions) on the secondary structure model of SERCA2b depicted on the basis of the SERCA1a model, the sequence of human SERCA2b, and its hydropathy profile (5MacLennan D.H.

The residue Gly509 in SERCA1a is absent in SERCA2b, therefore the numbering of residues after this position in SERCA2b is lower by one than in SERCA1a. SERCA2b possesses the 11th transmembrane helix (M11) in its long extra C terminus region, i.e. 1040 residues in SERCA2b versus 994 residues in SERCA1a (8Lytton J. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

The amino acid sequence of SERCA2b is otherwise highly homologous to that of SERCA1a; actually the residues with the 51 DD mutations examined here and the residues described under “Discussion” and in the supplemental discussion in relation to these DD mutations for the structure/function relationship are all conserved in SERCA1a and 2b. b, residues with the DD mutations examined are shown with the main chain α-carbons (blue, green, and red) on the atomic structure E1Ca2 of SERCA1a (PDB accession code 1SU4 (39Toyoshima C.

Appropriate restriction fragments with the desired mutation were excised and ligated back into the corresponding region of the full-length SERCA2b cDNA in the plasmid. The full-length SERCA2b cDNA was then excised and ligated into the pMT2 expression vector (27Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V.K. Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 946-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The pMT2 DNA was transfected into COS-1 cells using the liposome-mediated transfection method. Microsomes were prepared from the cells as described previously (28Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The “control microsomes” were prepared from COS-1 cells transfected with the pMT2 vector containing no SERCA2b cDNA. The amount of expressed SERCA2b protein was quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with SERCA2b-specific monoclonal antibody IID8 (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO), and the expression level of the mutant in the microsomes was obtained as a value relative to that of the wild type. The amount of intrinsic SERCA2b in the control microsomes was less than 1% of the amount of SERCA2b in the microsomes from the cells transfected with the wild-type cDNA. RNA Preparation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted by the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) from COS-1 cells transfected with the pMT2 vector containing wild-type or mutant SERCA2b cDNA, and 0.5 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed and blotted onto Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization was performed with a digoxigenin-labeled RNA probe for the region (nucleotides 2249-2620) of SERCA2b cDNA. Digoxigenin labeling of the probe was performed with the DIG Northern Starter Kit (Roche Applied Science). Digoxigenin-labeled actin RNA probe (Roche Applied Science) was used as the control probe. After washing the blotted membrane, digoxigenin-labeled RNA was detected with anti-digoxigenin Fab fragments and visualized by the chemiluminescence technique with CDP-Star (Roche Applied Science). Quantitative Real Time Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—The SERCA2b mRNA level in 0.02 μg of the total RNA was determined by the real time reverse transcriptase-PCR with the LightCycler™ system and the LightCycler-RNA Master SYBR® Green I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Melting curve analysis was performed to enhance specificity of the amplification reaction, and LightCycler software version 3.5 was used to evaluate the amplification efficiency and thus quantify the relative mRNA level in comparison with the internal standard curve obtained with the cells transfected with wild-type SERCA2b. The mRNA levels of the mutants relative to the wild-type level thus obtained were corrected by the mRNA level of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The primers used for SERCA2b were GGCAATCTACAACAACATGAAAC (forward) and GTAGGAAATGACTCAGCTTGG (reverse), and for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, CATGTTCGTCATGGGTGTGA (forward) and AGTGAGCTTCCCGTTCAGCTC (reverse). ATPase Activity—The rate of ATP hydrolysis was determined at 37 °C in a mixture containing 20 μg/ml microsomal protein, 1 mm ATP, 1 μm A23187, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m KCl, 5 mm NaN3, 50 mm MOPS/Tris (pH 7.0), and 1.84 mm CaCl2 with 2 mm EGTA (3.2 μm free Ca2+ (pCa 5.5)). When the Ca2+ concentration dependence was determined, the CaCl2 concentration was varied in the presence of 2 mm EGTA. The reaction was terminated by the addition of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid, and the amount of Pi released was quantified by the Youngburg and Youngburg method (29Youngburg G.E. Youngburg M.V. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1930; 16: 158-166Google Scholar). Total Ca2+-ATPase activity of the microsomes was obtained as above, but by subtracting the Ca2+-independent ATPase activity, determined in the presence of 5 mm EGTA without added CaCl2. The Ca2+-ATPase activity of the expressed SERCA2b was then obtained by subtracting the Ca2+-ATPase activity of the control microsomes (background level) from that of the microsomes expressing SERCA2b. This background level was as low as 3% of the activity of those microsomes expressing the wild-type SERCA2b from its cDNA. The Ca2+-ATPase activity of the expressed wild type in the microsomes thus obtained was 122.6 ± 3.7 nmol/min/mg of microsomal protein (n = 5). The Ca2+-ATPase activity of each of the mutants was normalized to its protein expression level relative to that of the wild type (determined as above), thus the specific Ca2+-ATPase activity of each of the mutants relative to that of the wild type was obtained. Ca2+ Transport Activity—Oxalate-dependent and thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ transport was assayed as described previously (30Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Suzuki H. Saino T. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23910-23915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) at 25 °C in the presence and absence of 0.5 μm thapsigargin in a mixture containing 20 μg/ml microsomal protein, 1 mm ATP, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m KCl, 20 mm MOPS/Tris (pH 7.0), 5 mm potassium oxalate, and 0.462 mm 45CaCl2 with 0.5 mm EGTA (3.2 μm free 45Ca2+ (pCa 5.5)). The Ca2+ transport activity of the SERCA2b expressed from its cDNA in the microsomes was obtained by subtracting the thapsigargin-sensitive activity of the control microsomes (background level) from that of the microsomes expressing SERCA2b from its cDNA. This background level was as low as 1% of the activity of microsomes expressing the wild-type SERCA2b from its cDNA. The Ca2+ transport activity of the expressed wild type in the microsomes thus obtained was 68.1 ± 4 nmol/min/mg of microsomal protein (n = 4). The Ca2+ transport activity of each of the mutants was normalized to its protein-expression level relative to that of the wild type (determined as above), thus the specific Ca2+ transport activity of each of the mutants relative to that of the wild type was obtained. Formation of EP—Phosphorylation of SERCA2b in microsomes with [γ-32P]ATP or 32Pi was performed under conditions described in the figure legends and Table 1. The reaction was quenched with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid containing Pi. The precipitated proteins were separated by 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 6.0 according to the Weber and Osborn method (31Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The radioactivity associated with the separated SERCA2b was quantitated by digital autoradiography as described previously (32Daiho T. Suzuki H. Yamasaki K. Saino T. Kanazawa T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The amount of EP formed with the expressed SERCA2b was obtained by subtracting the background radioactivity with the control microsomes. This background level was less than 5% of the radioactivity of EP formed with the expressed wild-type SERCA2b.TABLE 1Summary for functional properties of DD-causing mutants The 36 DD mutants, whose protein expression levels were higher than 30% of that of the wild type, were subjected to functional analyses, and the data obtained are summarized. The specific Ca2+ -ATPase activity of each of the mutants relative to that of the wild type (WT) was determined as described in the legend to Fig. 4, and shown in the fourth column. The mutants are placed from the top row in the table according to their activities thus obtained (i.e. from highest to lowest). The specific Ca2+ transport activity of each of the mutants relative to that of the wild type was determined in Fig. 5. The amount of EP formed from [γ-32P]ATP of the mutant was determined at steady state and at 0 °C, pCa 5.5, and normalized to its expression level relative to that of the wild type as described in the legend to Fig. 6. K0.5 and the Hill coefficient (n) were determined in the Ca2+ dependence of this EP formation at 0 °C by fitting the data to the Hill equation. EP formation from [γ-32P]ATP was also performed at 25 °C, 10 mm Ca2+ for 10 s in a mixture containing 40 μg/ml of microsomal protein, 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 80 mm KCl, 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 10 mm CaCl2, and the amount of EP in the mutant was calculated as above. The amount of EP formed with the wild type was 126 ± 6 (n = 6) pmol/mg of microsomal protein, and nearly the same as that at 0 °C and pCa 5.5. EP formation from 32Pi was performed in the absence of Ca2+ at 25 °C for 10 min in a mixture containing 40 μg/ml of microsomal protein, 0.1 mm 32Pi, 1 μm A23187, 10 mm MgCl2, 35% (v/v) Me2SO, 50 mm MES/Tris (pH 6.0), and 5 mm EGTA, i.e. under the conditions previously demonstrated by Barrabin et al. (70Barrabin H. Scofano H.M. Inesi G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) with SR Ca2+ -ATPase to phosphorylate virtually all the phosphorylation sites. The amount of EP formed with the mutant was calculated as above. The amount of EP formed with the wild type was 134 ± 9 (n = 4) pmol/mg of microsomal protein. All the values are the mean values obtained in three to eight independent experiments (shown without the standard deviations for simplicity, but see figures for the deviations). In the second and third columns, the locations of the DD mutation in the gene and in the enzyme protein are indicated with the exon number and the region in the tertiary structure, respectively.

Free Ca2+ concentrations were calculated as described previously (34Kubota T. Daiho T. Kanazawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1163: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed using Origin software (Microcal Software, Inc., Northampton, MA). Three-dimensional models of the enzyme were reproduced by the program VMD (35Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J.

Effects of DD Mutations on Protein Expression and ATPase Activity—Each of the 51 DD-causing substitution and deletion mutations was introduced into SERCA2b cDNA, and the mutant cDNA or wild-type cDNA was transfected into COS-1 cells. The expression level of the mutant protein in microsomes prepared from the cells was determined and compared with that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 3a). The amount of intrinsic wild-type SERCA2b protein in the control microsomes (prepared from the control cells transfected with the vector without having the SERCA2b cDNA) was less than 1% of the wild-type protein expressed with the cDNA. Depending on the mutations introduced, the expression of mutants varied significantly from undetectable levels to those comparable with the wild-type level. Expression levels of the 15 mutants were less than 30% of the wild-type level, thus very low. There were no hot spots on the primary and tertiary structures for the markedly reduced expression (see Figs. 2b and 3b). Such markedly reduced expression occurred with the specific mutations in the cytoplasmic, transmembrane, and lumenal regions of the enzyme. The transcription levels were checked by the Northern blot analysis and more quantitatively by the real time reverse transcriptase-PCR method for these 15 mutants and three more mutants of the relatively low protein expression (30-40% of the wild-type level). We found, first of all, that the mRNA levels of all these mutants as well as of the wild type were ∼500 to 800 times higher than the intrinsic wild-type SERCA2b mRNA level of the control cells, showing their extremely high transcription levels and suggesting high transfection efficiency. In the Northern blot analysis, the size of the mRNA of all these mutants and that of the wild type in the expression vector were shown to be exactly the same and their expression levels were very similar with no major reduction in the mutants (data not shown).

To characterize the domains that are involved in oligomerization and detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) association, we expressed truncation and point mutants of stomatin and analyzed their size and buoyancy by ultracentrifugation methods. A small C-terminal region of stomatin that is largely hydrophobic, Ser-Thr-Ile-Val-Phe-Pro-Leu-Pro-Ile (residues 264–272), proved to be crucial for oligomerization, whereas the N-terminal domain (residues 1–20) and the last 12 C-terminal amino acids (residues 276–287) were not essential. The introduction of alanine substitutions in the region 264–272 resulted in the appearance of monomers. Remarkably, only three of these residues, Ile-Val-Phe (residues 266–268), were found to be indispensable for the DRM association. Interestingly, the exchange of Pro-269 and to some extent the residues 270–272, which are essential for oligomerization, did not affect the DRM association of stomatin. This suggests that the formation of oligomers is not necessary for the association of stomatin with DRMs. Internal deletions near the membrane anchoring domain resulted in the formation of intermediate size oligomers suggesting a conformational interdependence of large parts of the C-terminal region. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis of the tagged, monomeric, non-DRM mutant ST-(1–262)-green fluorescent protein and wild type stomatin StomGFP showed a significantly higher lateral mobility of the truncation mutant in the plasma membrane suggesting a membrane interaction of the respective C-terminal region also in vivo.

The 31-kDa integral protein stomatin was first identified as an abundant component of the human erythrocyte membrane (1Hiebl-Dirschmied C.M. Adolf G.R. Prohaska R. Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 1991; 1090: 123-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) is characterized by a highly charged 24-residue N terminus followed by a 29-residue hydrophobic sequence that is most probably associated with the membrane and the large C-terminal region containing 234 residues. Stomatin has an unusual topology (7Salzer U. Ahorn H. Prohaska R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1151: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), similar to caveolin (8Monier S. Parton R.G. Vogel F. Behlke J. Henske A. Kurzchalia T.V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 911-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), with the hydrophobic domain forming a putative “hairpin loop” in the lipid bilayer and the N and C termini facing the cytoplasm. Palmitoylation of the cysteine residues Cys-29 and Cys-86 further increases the affinity of stomatin for the membrane (9Snyers L. Umlauf E. Prohaska R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The association of stomatin with the lipid droplet phospholipid monolayer (10Umlauf E. Csaszar E. Moertelmaier M. Schuetz G.J. Parton R.G. Prohaska R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23699-23709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) suggests that the hydrophobic domain is embedded only in the cytoplasmic leaflet of lipid bilayer membranes. In the human epithelial cell line of amniotic origin (UAC), stomatin concentrates in plasma membrane protrusions and juxtanuclear vesicles that are positive for the late endosomal/lysosomal marker lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP-2) (11Snyers L. Umlauf E. Prohaska R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 802-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). At the plasma membrane, the protein is directly or indirectly linked to the cortical actin microfilaments, and this connection remains intact even after treatment with the actin filament-disrupting drug cytochalasin D (12Snyers L. Thines-Sempoux D. Prohaska R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 281-285PubMed Google Scholar). A structural characteristic of stomatin is its organization in high-order homo-oligomeric complexes of about 300 kDa, comprising 9- to 12-mers, within the epithelial plasma membrane (13Snyers L. Umlauf E. Prohaska R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17221-17226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In the erythrocyte membrane, these oligomers are even larger, in the range of 200 to 600 kDa (14Salzer U. Prohaska R. Blood. 2001; 97: 1141-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). A C-terminal truncation mutant of stomatin, ST-(1–262)myc5, is not incorporated into oligomers indicating that the last 25 C-terminal amino acids are required for the oligomeric complex formation (11Snyers L. Umlauf E. Prohaska R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 802-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Another hallmark of stomatin is its presence in detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) 2The abbreviations used are: DRM, detergent-resistant membrane; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PHB, prohibitin; ROI, region of interest; SPFH, stomatin, prohibitin, flotillin, HflC/K; WT, wild type. 2The abbreviations used are: DRM, detergent-resistant membrane; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PHB, prohibitin; ROI, region of interest; SPFH, stomatin, prohibitin, flotillin, HflC/K; WT, wild type. that are enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol (11Snyers L.

A. 2003; 100: 5813-5818Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). These DRMs are thought to originate from specialized membrane domains, known as lipid rafts, that are suggested to play a role in cellular events such as receptor signaling, membrane trafficking, and sorting to the apical membrane of polarized cells (16Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8051) Google Scholar, 17Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2004; 33: 269-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). The truncation mutant ST-(1–262)myc5 does not associate with DRMs. Because this mutant lost both the ability to oligomerize and associate with DRMs, we suggested that the raft association of stomatin may depend on its oligomeric structure (11Snyers L. Umlauf E. Prohaska R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 802-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that the C-terminal region between residues 264 and 272 is essential for oligomerization and that only three hydrophobic residues (266–268) within this region are necessary for DRM association. The residues 269–272, which are indispensable for oligomerization, are not essential for DRM association, suggesting that stomatin oligomerization is not necessary for raft association. FRAP analyses independently showed that the C terminus (residues 263–287) contained a membrane-interacting domain regulating the lateral mobility. Reagents—The mouse monoclonal antibodies against stomatin, GARP-50 and GARP-61, have been described (1Hiebl-Dirschmied C.M. Adolf G.R. Prohaska R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1065: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and were used directly from the hybridoma supernatants. Protease inhibitors were from Sigma, laboratory chemicals were from Merck, and reinforced nitrocellulose Optitran BA-S 83 was from Schleicher & Schuell. Cell Culture—Human epithelial cells of amniotic origin, squamous epithelial carcinoma cells (A431), and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco′s modified Eagle′s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin) under standard conditions. DNA Mutagenesis and Cell Transfection—The vector pEF-Puro.PL3, used to stably express stomatin truncation mutants or alanine substitutions in full-length stomatin, has been described (13Snyers L. Umlauf E. Prohaska R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17221-17226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 20Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). The cDNAs of truncated stomatin variants were generated by polymerase chain reaction and were directionally cloned into the unique restriction sites SpeI/EcoRV of pEFBOS-Puro.PL3. The cDNAs encoding full-length stomatin point mutants and internal deletion mutants were generated by overlap extension using complementary oligonucleotides carrying the desired mutation/deletion and peripheral primers carrying the 5′- or 3′-end of stomatin cDNA flanked by the restrictions sites SpeI or EcoRI, respectively. Subsequently, the cDNA fragments were subcloned into pEF-Puro.PL3. A431 or UAC cells were stably transfected using the Profection mammalian transfection system (Promega). Membrane Preparation—Membrane preparations of confluent A431 or UAC clones (one 15-cm dish each) were performed using two centrifugation steps as described previously (13Snyers L. Umlauf E. Prohaska R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17221-17226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Density Gradient Centrifugation—Cellular membranes were prepared, solubilized, and subjected to density gradient ultracentrifugation as described (13Snyers L. Umlauf E. Prohaska R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17221-17226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, the membranes of confluent A431 or UAC cells stably expressing stomatin mutants or wild type (WT) stomatin were solubilized in 200 μl of 1% Triton X-100 in TNE buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at room temperature for 10 min. The solubilized proteins were applied on top of a linear density gradient and centrifuged in an SW 40 rotor (Beckman) at 40,000 rpm for 19 h. Nineteen fractions were collected from the top and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For gradient calibration, marker proteins (gel filtration molecular weight markers, Sigma) were used in parallel and detected by Coomassie Blue staining of polyacrylamide gels. In some experiments, a modified lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 instead of 1% was used and yielded identical results comparable with 1% Triton X-100. Flotation Assay—Flotation was carried out as described (11Snyers L. Umlauf E. Prohaska R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 802-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, cellular membranes of confluent A431 or UAC clones (one 15-cm dish each) were prepared by homogenization and centrifugation and subsequently lysed in 280 μl of ice-cold TNE buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 10 min. The lysate was adjusted to 50% sucrose by the addition of 490 μl of 80% sucrose in TNE and overlaid with 3 ml of 35% sucrose followed by 1.2 ml of 5% sucrose in the same buffer. After ultracentrifugation at 48,000 rpm in an SW 55 rotor (Beckman) for 18 h, 8 fractions were collected from the top and analyzed by Western blotting. DRM components were identified in the low-density fractions 2 and 3, whereas Triton X-100-soluble proteins were found in the dense fractions 6, 7, and 8. Western Blotting—Immunoblotting was performed as described (10Umlauf E. Csaszar E. Moertelmaier M. Schuetz G.J. Parton R.G. Prohaska R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23699-23709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) using the SuperSignal system (Pierce). For the detection of stomatin mutants, the mouse monoclonal antibody against the N terminus of stomatin, GARP-50 (diluted 1/15), was used except for the N-terminal truncation mutant ST-(21–287) that was detected by GARP-61 (diluted 1/15), an antibody against a C-terminal epitope of stomatin. FRAP Analysis—HeLa cells were transiently transfected with pEGFP-N3-stomatin or pEGFP-N3-ST-(1–262) as described (10Umlauf E. Csaszar E. Moertelmaier M. Schuetz G.J. Parton R.G. Prohaska R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23699-23709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 12 h after transfection, cells were seeded on 35-mm glass-bottom dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA), and FRAP analysis was performed after another 24 h, essentially as described (21Kenworthy A.K. Nichols B.J. Remmert C.L. Hendrix G.M. Kumar M. Zimmerberg J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 735-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 22Goodwin J.S. Kenworthy A.K. Methods. 2005; 37: 154-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution and mounted in prewarmed Hanks' balanced salt solution (supplemented with 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) on a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope equipped with a stage heater (37 °C). Cells were imaged with a ×63 NA1.4 Plan-Apochromat oil immersion lens at 4-fold magnification. For quantitative FRAP, pre- and post-bleach images were monitored with the 488 nm laser line of a 30-milliwatt argon laser set to 60% laser power at 1% transmission and a confocal pinhole of 1.5 airy units. Photobleaching of a circular region of interest (ROI) with a diameter of 1.8 μm was performed by 12 bleach iterations with all argon laser lines set to 100% transmission. Images were recorded with a 2-s time lapse at a scan time of about 0.8 s. Fluorescence intensity data of the whole cell ROI, the bleached ROI, and a background ROI were quantified using the physiology evaluation software package (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Jena, Germany). Recovery curves were bleach- and background-corrected, and mobile fractions were calculated as described (22Goodwin J.S. Kenworthy A.K. Methods. 2005; 37: 154-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For the calculation of the recovery half-time (t½), the normalized and bleach-corrected recovery data were fitted to the following formula to estimate recovery kinetics, I(t) = a(1 – exp(–kt)). The recovery half-time was then calculated as t½ = ln 2/k as described (23Shimi T. Koujin T. Segura-Totten M. Wilson K.L. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 147: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). For qualitative FRAP, the diameter of the bleach ROI was increased to 3.4 μm, the pinhole was set to 1 airy unit, and laser transmission was increased to 2–3% for pre- and post-bleach images. Postbleach images were acquired with a 30-s time lapse, and 4-line averaging was used to get high quality pictures. The other settings were identical to those used in the quantitative experiments. Amino Acid Residues between Positions 262 and 275 Are Essential for Oligomerization—We have previously shown that the last 25 C-terminal amino acid residues of stomatin are essential for homo-oligomerization (13Snyers L. Umlauf E. Prohaska R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17221-17226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To determine whether the rather basic C-terminal end, 276QGIIGAKHSHLG287, or the more proximal, mainly hydrophobic region, 262KNSTIVFPLPIDML275 (Fig. 1), was important for oligomerization, we generated several C-terminal truncation mutants and stably expressed them in A431 or UAC cells. A431 cells were chosen because they lacked endogenous stomatin that might interfere with mutant-mutant interactions. The cell membranes were isolated and solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 at room temperature, and the protein complexes were separated according to size by linear density gradient centrifugation. SDS-PAGE of the collected fractions, subsequent Western blotting, and densitometric evaluation showed that about 90% of the C-terminal truncation mutant, ST-(1–275), is oligomeric (Figs. 2 and 6), similar to WT stomatin, ST-(1–287). This result shows that the outermost 12 residues of the C terminus are not required for oligomeric complex formation. Likewise, the short hydrophilic N terminus is not involved in oligomerization because the N-terminal truncation mutant, ST-(21–287), shows a similar distribution within the gradient. In contrast, further truncation at the C terminus, as in ST-(1–270), ST-(1–266), and ST-(1–262), resulted in complete loss of the oligomeric complexes (Figs. 2 and 6). The upper bands (marked end.) that are visible in the analyses of ST-(1–262) and ST-(21–287) represent the endogenous stomatin of UAC cells and show that the gradients have formed correctly. Whereas the N-terminal truncation mutant exactly co-migrated with the endogenous stomatin suggesting the presence of mixed oligomers, the C-terminal mutant ST-(1–262) did not. The degradation visible in the analyses of ST-(1–270) and ST-(1–266) may be explained by the lack of protection by oligomerization and/or improper folding resulting in a higher accessibility to proteases even though the standard protease inhibitors were present. On the other hand, ST-(1–262) appears to be more stable possibly because of an intact secondary structure. Interestingly, internal deletions of five amino acids within the C-terminal region more proximal to the membrane attachment site, ST-(Δ136–140) and ST-(Δ145–150), also affected oligomerization. ST-(Δ136–140) formed pentamers, whereas ST-(Δ145–150) gave rise to a mixture of complexes corresponding to trimers and 9- to 12-mers (Figs. 2 and 6).FIGURE 2Stomatin oligomerization depends on residues located upstream of position 275. Cell membranes of confluent A431 or UAC cells stably expressing the indicated stomatin truncation mutants or WT stomatin, ST-(1–287), were isolated, solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 at room temperature, and loaded on top of linear density gradients. After ultracentrifugation, 19 fractions were collected from the top and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (fractions 1–19 were loaded from left to right). The results are representative of 2–3 analyzed clones per mutant. Regarding ST-(1–262) and ST-(21–287) that were expressed in UAC cells, the upper band (labeled end.) corresponds to the endogenous stomatin serving as a marker for the oligomers and indicator of proper gradient formation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 6Summary of the oligomerization and DRM association data of stomatin mutants. For the WT stomatin and the indicated mutants, the intensity of Western blot bands was determined by densitometry and quantified by ImageQuant 5.1 software. The position numbers of the amino acid residues are indicated. Below the amino acid sequence, the values of oligomerization (oligomers) and DRM (raft) association (percent relative to WT stomatin) for the respective point mutants are given. In the lower part of the figure, the values for the truncation mutants ST-(1–266), ST-(1–270), and ST-(1–275) are shown. For the calculation of percent oligomerization, the sum of the densitometric values obtained for fractions 2 and 3 (monomers) plus 10 and 11 (oligomers) was set to 100%. For DRM association, the sum of fractions 2 and 3 (DRMs) and 6–8 (non-DRMs) was set to 100%. Using these calculations, 96% of WT stomatin was oligomeric, and 80% was associated with DRMs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Amino Acid Residues 264–272 Are Indispensable for Oligomerization—To determine in detail which amino acids within the region 262–275 are essential for oligomerization, we performed an alanine scan of this region in full-length stomatin (Fig. 1). The alanine-substituted point mutants were stably expressed in A431 cells and subjected to density gradient centrifugation, and the collected fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. As shown in Figs. 3 and 6, the mutation of each of the amino acid residues in the region 265TIVFPL270 and Ile-272 resulted in the complete loss of oligomeric complexes. The residues Ser-264 and Pro-271 are also important because the oligomers of these mutants only account for about 18% (Figs. 3 and 6). Therefore, we conclude that the oligomerization domain is located between residues 264 and 272. The residues flanking this region, Lys-262, Asn-263, Asp-273, Met-274, and Leu-275, apparently play a minor role in the formation of stomatin oligomers. In addition, we analyzed several stomatin variants carrying point mutations that were located more proximal to the membrane attachment site. The residues Thr-181 and Trp-184 were part of a conserved region within the stomatin family, 181TDAWG185 (bold letters indicate more than 60% identity) (Fig. 1, BAND_7). Whereas the mutation T181A had no effect, substitution of Trp-184 prevented oligomerization. Unfortunately, we were not able to generate stable clones of ST-G185A. The substitution of Tyr-251, the only tyrosine residue within a sequence of about 130 residues, resulted in the absence of oligomers (Figs. 3 and 6). Truncation Mutants Deficient in Oligomerization Do Not Associate with DRMs—We have already shown that endogenous stomatin associates with lipid rafts in UAC cells, whereas the monomeric C-terminal truncation mutant, ST-(1–262), is not detected in DRMs (11Snyers L. Umlauf E. Prohaska R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 802-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To analyze the effect of the outermost C terminus on the DRM association in more detail, we performed flotation experiments using A431 cells expressing three additional stomatin truncation mutants. As mentioned above, we used A431 cells to rule out the possible interference of endogenous stomatin with lipid raft association of the mutants via oligomerization. However, lipid rafts in these cells appeared to be less stable and/or less abundant than in UAC cells because under the conditions used for the UAC cells, even the WT stomatin was excluded from DRMs and apparently dissolved (data not shown). We therefore reduced the Triton X-100 concentration during solubilization at 4 °C to final 0.1%. This resulted in the association of 80% of WT stomatin with the floating fractions and the exclusion of the monomeric, C-terminal truncation mutant ST-(1–266) (Figs. 4 and 6), as observed with UAC cells (not shown). To demonstrate the applicability of this modified technique, the presence of two other raft markers, placental alkaline phosphatase and flotillin-2, was tested. The distribution of A431-derived DRMs proved to be similar to the UAC-derived DRMs, which were isolated with 1% Triton X-100. Throughout the following experiments, these two raft markers served as positive controls for the proper isolation of DRMs (not shown). To test whether the reduced detergent concentration affects the oligomerization behavior of stomatin and mutants, we solubilized the cell membranes in 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature and performed linear gradient centrifugation in 0.1% Triton X-100. For all tested constructs, we obtained equal results compared with the experiments with 1% Triton X-100 (data not shown). ST-(1–275), lacking only the outermost 12 amino acid residues, shows a distribution similar to WT stomatin regarding both oligomerization and DRM association (Figs. 4 and 6). Interestingly, the completely monomeric C-terminal truncation mutant ST-(1–270) shows some association with DRMs. The analysis of the oligomeric N-terminal truncation mutant ST-(21–287) revealed, as expected, that the hydrophilic N terminus was not necessary for DRM association (Figs. 4 and 6). Ile-266, Val-267, and Phe-268 Are Crucial for DRM Association but Not for Oligomerization—To study the significance of the amino acid residues in the region 262–275 for DRM association, we determined the buoyancy of the stomatin point mutants that already had been analyzed for oligomerization. Interestingly, only three amino acids, Ile-266, Val-267, and Phe-268, are indispensable for DRM association (Figs. 5 and 6). Surprisingly, the monomeric mutant ST-P269A associated with DRMs equally well as WT stomatin (Figs. 5 and 6) challenging the hypothesis that oligomerization is necessary for raft association. Several other monomeric point mutants, namely ST-S264A, ST-T265A, ST-L270A, ST-P271A, and ST-I272A, are also associated with DRMs (Fig. 5) albeit to a reduced extent when compared with WT stomatin (Fig. 6). The remaining stomatin mutants, ST-K262A, ST-N263A, ST-D273A, ST-M274A, and ST-L275A, are partially oligomeric and also show reduced DRM association. The C Terminus Modifies the Lateral Mobility of Stomatin in the Plasma Membrane—Our in vitro analyses defined the C-terminal region 262–275 to be important for oligomerization and residues 266–268 for DRM association. To test whether this region is also relevant for interactions in vivo, we studied its effect on the lateral mobility in the plasma membrane. We performed FRAP analyses of the GFP-tagged WT stomatin, StomGFP, and the monomeric, non-DRM truncation mutant, ST-(1–262)GFP, respectively. HeLa cells transiently expressing these fusion proteins were studied at 37 °C. For qualitative analysis, an ROI with a diameter of 3.4 μm in the lateral membrane of these cells was photobleached, and the recovery of the respective fluorescent protein was documented after 30 and 120 s. For each protein, a representative experiment is shown in Fig. 7A. For quantitative analysis, we reduced the diameter of the bleach ROI to 1.8 μm to reduce the recovery time. Recovery was monitored at 2-s intervals for 230 s for StomGFP and for 135 s for ST-(1–262)GFP. The recovery curves shown in Fig. 7B were calculated from seven identical measurements each, as described (22Goodwin J.S. Kenworthy A.K. Methods. 2005; 37: 154-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The recovery curves in Fig. 7B clearly demonstrate that a large proportion of StomGFP is immobile and does not recover (mobile fraction (Mf) = 56%). The monomeric, non-DRM mutant ST-(1–262)GFP shows an increased mobile fraction (Mf = 82%). To analyze the diffusion speed of the two constructs, we calculated the recovery half-time (t½) and found that the ST-(1–262)GFP construct has a lower (t½) value and therefore its diffusional velocity is higher than the one for StomGFP. Fig. 7C shows a comparison of the two parameters Mf and t½. Previous studies showed that the outermost C terminus of stomatin is involved in oligomerization (13Snyers L. Umlauf E. Prohaska R. J.

Rev. 2003; 55: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). A large body of evidence points to a major role of the receptors in mediating CRF effects in anxiety and depressive disorders and in stress-associated pathologies. Two types of CRF receptors are known, the CRF1 and the CRF2 receptors. The CRF1 receptor is expressed mainly in the pituitary and central nervous system and binds CRF with high affinity. It mediates adrenocorticotrophic hormone release from the anterior pituitary and is involved in the endocrine, autonomic, and cognitive responses to stress stimuli. The CRF2 receptors are expressed in the central nervous system but also in the periphery including skeletal muscle cells, cardiac myocytes, and cells of the gastrointestinal tract. Three splice variants of CRF2 receptors have been described: CRF2(a), CRF2(b), and CRF2(c) receptors. They bind CRF with low and the urocortins 1-3 with high affinity. The CRF2 receptors are involved in the regulation of feeding behavior (4Spina M. Merlo-Pich E. Chan R.K. Basso A.M. Rivier J. Vale W. Koob G.F. Science. 1996; 273: 1561-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar) and in recovery from a stress response (5Coste S.C. Kesterson R.A. Heldwein K.A. Stevens S.L. Heard A.D. Hollis J.H. Murray S.E. Hill J.K. Pantely G.A. Hohimer A.R. Hatton D.C. Phillips T.J. Finn D.A. Low M.J. Rittenberg M.B. Stenzel P. Stenzel-Poore M.P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). It is likely that they are also involved in modulating anxiety-related behavior. The CRF receptors belong to the small subgroup of GPCRs (5-10%) possessing putative N-terminal signal peptides. These peptides are believed to be cleaved-off after mediating the ER targeting/insertion process (6Wallin E. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 7Higy M. Junne T. Spiess M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12716-12722Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The majority (90-95%) of the GPCRs do not possess cleavable signal peptides. Here, one of the transmembrane helices (TM) of the mature receptors (usually TM1) mediates ER targeting/insertion as an uncleaved signal anchor sequence (6Wallin E. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The reason as to why some membrane proteins including GPCRs require additional signal peptides, whereas others do not, is not completely understood. An initial function of a signal sequence (cleaved signal peptide or uncleaved signal anchor sequence) is to stop the cytoplasmic translation of a membrane protein (“elongation arrest”) by its binding to the signal recognition particle (SRP) (8Shan S.O. Walter P. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 9Halic M. Beckmann R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 116-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The resulting complex is targeted to the translocon at the ER membrane and the signal sequence promotes translocon gating. Protein synthesis starts again and the nascent chains are integrated into the bilayer. Without a signal peptide, the N tail of a membrane protein is synthesized in the cytoplasm, because translation continues until the signal anchor sequence (TM1) appears. The N tail must thus be translocated post-translationally. In contrast, in the presence of an additional signal peptide, the N tail of the GPCR is not translated in the cytosol, because SRP binding to the preceding signal peptide stops elongation. Here, the N tail can be translocated co-translationally through the translocon. Taking these considerations into account, it was proposed that signal peptides facilitate N tail translocation of those membrane proteins for which a post-translational translocation of the N tail is impaired (10Köchl R. Alken M. Rutz C. Krause G. Oksche A. Rosenthal W. Schülein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16131-16138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 11Andersson H. D'Antona A.M. Kendall D.A. von Heijne G. Chin C.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 570-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), for example, because rapidly folding domains are present (12Denzer A.J. Nabholz C.E. Spiess M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6311-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Usually, these proteins contain long N-tails (6Wallin E. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the case of GPCRs, it was shown that the signal peptide of the endothelin B (ETB) receptor is indeed essential for N tail translocation across the ER membrane (10Köchl R. Alken M. Rutz C. Krause G. Oksche A. Rosenthal W. Schülein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16131-16138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Addition of a cleavable signal peptide also promotes N tail translocation of GPCRs normally containing only signal anchor sequences (11Andersson H. D'Antona A.M. Kendall D.A. von Heijne G. Chin C.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 570-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 13Guan X.M. Kobilka T.S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21995-21998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Signal peptides may also facilitate predominantly ER targeting. Such a function was recently described for the signal peptide of the CRF1 receptor (14Alken M. Rutz C. Köchl R. Donalies U. Oueslati M. Furkert J. Wietfeld D. Hermosilla R. Scholz A. Beyermann M. Rosenthal W. Schülein R. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Here, we have assessed the functional significance of the putative signal peptide of the CRF2(a) receptor. We show that this receptor does not possess a conventional cleaved signal peptide like the homologous CRF1 receptor. Instead, it contains a pseudo signal peptide that forms part of the mature receptor protein. This sequence represents a novel hydrophobic receptor domain in the GPCR family.

Proteinase K digestion (0.5 mg/ml) was for 60 min at 0 °C; reactions were terminated with 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Triton X-100 (1%) was used to permeabilize membranes, and the peptide NYT (NH2-Asp-Tyr-Thr-COOH) (100 μm) to inhibit N-glycosylation of the constructs. All samples were transferred into 10 preheated volumes of 1% SDS and 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 12% Tris/Tricine gels. Proteins were visualized by autoradiography. [125I-TyrO]Sauvagine Displacement Binding Assay—Crude membranes of stably transfected HEK 293 cells were incubated in a final volume of 200 μl of Tris/BAME buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm CaCl2, 15 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm benzamidine, 3.2 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 210 mg/ml bacitracin, pH 7.2) containing 0.1 nm [125I-TyrO]sauvagine alone and increasing concentrations of unlabeled ligand (1 × 10-11-1 × 10-6m). Binding was determined and data were analyzed as described previously (16Wietfeld D. Heinrich N. Furkert J. Fechner K. Beyermann M. Bienert M. Berger H. J. Biol.

Saturation analysis yielded KD values of 0.33 and 0.28 nm for constructs CRF2(a) and ΔSP-CRF2(a), respectively. These values were used for calculations of the Ki values of the unlabeled ligands (displacement experiments). [125I-TyrO]Sauvagine Binding Assay to Intact Cells—HEK 293 cells (1 × 105) grown on 24-well plates were transiently transfected with plasmid DNA (200 ng) and FuGENE 6 according to the supplier's recommendations. Cells were grown for 24 h and washed once with DPBS (PBS containing 0.9 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mm MgCl2). Then DPBS supplemented with 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm benzamidine, 1.4 μg/ml aprotinin, 3.2 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 210 mg/ml bacitracin, 0.05% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and [125I-TyrO]sauvagine (15 nm = saturating conditions) was added (final volume 300 μl). For determination of the nonspecific binding, 1 μm sauvagine was added. The samples were incubated at 25 °C for 2 h. Cells were washed 2 times with ice-cold DPBS and lysed with 500 μl of 100 mm NaOH solution. Bound [125I-TyrO]sauvagine was quantified using a PerkinElmer 1470 Wizard™ liquid scintillation counter. Immunoprecipitation of GFP-tagged Full-length CRF1 and CRF2(a) Receptor Constructs and Analysis of Their Glycosylation State—Cells (HEK 293 = 4 × 106; PC12 and SH-SY5Y = 5 × 106; AtT 20 = 3 × 106; COS.M6 = 2 × 106) grown on 100-mm diameter dishes were transiently transfected with plasmid DNA (HEK 293 = 6 μg; AtT 20, COS.M6, PC12 and SH-SY5Y cells = 24 μg) and FuGENE 6 (HEK 293 cells) or Lipofectamine 2000 (AtT 20, COS.M6, PC12, and SH-5YSY cells) according to the supplier's recommendations. Cells were cultivated for 24 h, washed twice with PBS (pH 7.4), and lysed for 1 h with 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, pH 8.0, supplemented with 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm benzamidine, 1.4 μg/ml aprotinin, 3.2 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor). Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation (15 min, 26,000 × g). The supernatant was supplemented with polyclonal rabbit anti-GFP antiserum 01 coupled to protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads and the sample was incubated for 3 h (beads were prepared by equilibrating 10 mg of the beads with lysis buffer and subsequent overnight incubation with 4 μl of polyclonal rabbit anti-GFP antiserum 01). GFP-tagged receptors were precipitated (2 min, 700 × g), and the beads were washed 2 times with 2 ml of washing buffer 1 (50 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, pH 8.0) and once with 2 ml of washing buffer 2 (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA pH 8.0, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, pH 7.4). Precipitated receptors were divided into three aliquots. One sample was supplemented with Roti-Load sample buffer, incubated for 5 min at 95 °C, and directly used for SDS-PAGE/immunoblot analysis. The proteins of the second and third sample were treated with PNGaseF or EndoH prior to immunoblot analysis according to the supplier's recommendations. The GFP-tagged receptors were detected by high resolution SDS-PAGE (8% SDS, 48-cm2 gels) and immunoblotting using a monoclonal mouse anti-GFP antibody and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. Immunoblots were carried out as described (20Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar). The CRF2(a) Receptor Meets All Sequence Criteria for the Presence of a Functional and Cleaved Signal Peptide—Cleavable signal peptides of eukaryotic membrane proteins share characteristic features with signal peptides of eukaryotic secretory proteins (21von Heijne G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 604-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar): a polar and often charged N-terminal (n) region, a central hydrophobic (h) region, and a polar C-terminal (c) region. The C-terminal end often contains helix-breaking proline and glycine residues and small uncharged residues at positions -1 and -3 of the cleavage site. Fig. 1B shows that both the rat CRF1 receptor and the rat CRF2(a) receptor contain putative signal peptides when monitored with the novel program “Signal P 3.0” (22Bendtsen J.D. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (5658) Google Scholar, 23Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar). Signal peptide probability is 0.99 in the case of the CRF1 receptor and 0.98 in the case of the CRF2(a) receptor. The maximal cleavage site probability for the CRF1 receptor is 0.59 between residues Ser24 and Lys25 and 0.76 for the CRF2(a) receptor between residues Ala18 and Glu19, i.e. cleavage is even better predictable for the CRF2(a) receptor. In the case of the CRF1 receptor, the presence of a cleaved signal peptide has been demonstrated experimentally (14Alken M. Rutz C. Köchl R. Donalies U. Oueslati M. Furkert J. Wietfeld D.

This signal peptide facilitates one of the early steps of receptor biogenesis such as ER targeting/translocon gating (14Alken M. Rutz C. Köchl R. Donalies U. Oueslati M. Furkert J. Wietfeld D. Hermosilla R. Scholz A. Beyermann M. Rosenthal W. Schülein R. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The Putative Signal Peptide of the CRF2(a) Receptor Is Incapable of Mediating ER Targeting of Heterologous Proteins—To assess whether the putative signal peptide of the CRF2(a) receptor is functional, the sequence for the N tail of the receptor with and without signal peptide was fused with a His-tagged GFP as a soluble marker protein (Fig. 1A; constructs CRF2(a).NT and ΔSP-CRF2(a).NT, respectively). Constructs containing the N tail of the CRF1 receptor and its signal peptide mutant were used as a control (Fig. 1A; constructs CRF1.NT and ΔSP-CRF1.NT, respectively; see also Alken et al. (14Alken M. Rutz C. Köchl R. Donalies U. Oueslati M. Furkert J. Wietfeld D. Hermosilla R. Scholz A. Beyermann M. Rosenthal W. Schülein R. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar)). If a cleavable signal peptide is present in the N tail of the CRF2(a) receptor, it should direct the soluble GFP marker to the ER and subsequently via the secretory pathway to the cell culture medium. If the sequence does not contain a functional signal peptide, the marker protein will remain in the cytosol. HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with the constructs and the GFP fluorescence signals were localized by confocal LSM (Fig. 2A, upper panel). In the case of ΔSP-CRF1.NT, the GFP signals were detected diffusely throughout the cell, indicating that this fusion did not enter the ER (it has been demonstrated previously that non-membrane-bound, soluble GFP is distributed equally between the cytoplasm and nucleus (26Begitt A. Meyer T. van Rossum M. Vinkemeier U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10418-10423Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar)). If the signal peptide of the CRF1 receptor control is present (construct CRF1.NT), reticular signals and a GFP-free nucleus (n in Fig. 2A) were detected, indicating that this fusion was directed to the ER membrane and into the ER lumen. In contrast, cytosolic and nuclear GFP signals were detected in the case of CRF2(a).NT and ΔSP-CRF2(a).NT, indicating that the signal peptide of the CRF2(a) is unable to mediate ER targeting/insertion of heterologous proteins. From the same batch of transiently transfected HEK 293 cells, the secreted GFP fusions were purified from the cell culture medium using their His tag and detected fluorimetrically (Fig. 2A, central panel) or by immunoblotting using anti-GFP antibodies (Fig. 2A, lower panel). GFP fluorescence or secreted proteins indicating a functional signal peptide were detectable only in the case of the CRF1.NT construct, consistent with the data obtained by confocal LSM. The data that the putative signal peptide of the CRF2(a) receptor is incapable of mediating ER targeting raise the question as to how this receptor is targeted to the ER membrane. It was shown previously (27Audigier Y. Friedlander M. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5783-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) that almost every TM of a GPCR can function as a signal anchor sequence. It was th"

A. (1999) J. Biomol. NMR 13, 161–174). To uncover the structural requirements for the hormone bioactivity, we investigated several sCT analogs. They were designed so as to alter the length of the central helix by removal and/or replacement of flanking residues and by selectively mutating or deleting residues inside the helix. The helix content was assessed by circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopies; the receptor binding affinity in human breast cancer cell line T 47D and the in vivo hypocalcemic activity were also evaluated. In particular, by NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics calculations we studied Leu23,Ala24-sCT in which Pro23 and Arg24 were replaced by helix inducing residues. Compared with sCT, it assumes a longer amphipathic α-helix, with decreased binding affinity and one-fifth of the hypocalcemic activity, therefore supporting the idea of a relationship between a definite helix length and bioactivity. From the analysis of other sCT mutants, we inferred that the correct helix length is located in the 9–19 region and requires long range interactions and the presence of specific regions of residues within the sequence for high binding affinity and hypocalcemic activity. Taken together, the structural and biological data identify well defined structural parameters of the helix for sCT bioactivity. Salmon calcitonin (sCT) forms an amphipathic helix in the region 9–19, with the C-terminal decapeptide interacting with the helix (Amodeo, P., Motta, A., Strazzullo, G., Castiglione Morelli, M. A.

This forms the basis for its primary clinical use in the treatment of bone-related disorders such as Paget disease, osteoporosis, and hypercalcemia of malignancy (1Purdue B.W. Tilakaratne N. Sexton P.M. Receptors Channels. 2002; 8: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). CT activity also includes modulation of renal ion excretion, analgesia, inhibition of appetite, and gastric acid secretion as well as influence on reproduction via the effects on embryological implantation and sperm function (Ref. 1Purdue B.W. Tilakaratne N. Sexton P.M. Receptors Channels. 2002; 8: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar and references therein). Recently, CT has been put forward as an ideal agent for treatment of osteoarthritis (2Manicourt D.H. Devogelaer J.P., Azria Silverman S. J. Musculoskelet. Neuronal Interact. 2005; 5: 285-293PubMed Google Scholar). CT is a single-chain polypeptide hormone of 32 amino acids with an N-terminal disulfide bridge between positions 1 and 7 and a C-terminal amidated proline. CT species so far studied can be subdivided into three major classes: human/rodent, artiodactyl, and teleost/avian; of these, the members of the teleost/avian group are generally the most potent, although relative potency varies in a species- and isoform-specific manner (3Gorn A.H. Lin H.Y. Yamin M. Auron P.E. Flannery M.R. Tapp D.R. Manning C.A. Lodish H.F. Krane S.M. Goldring S.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 90: 1726-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The higher potency combined with a longer in vivo half-life has led to fish-like CT, exemplified by salmon CT (sCT), as the standard form of CT used for the clinical treatment of bone disorders (4Zaidi M. Inzerillo A.M. Troen B. Moonga B. Abe E. Burckhardt P. Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. Vol. 2. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2002: 1423-1440Google Scholar). However, the usefulness of CT is limited by the development of clinical resistance. This can be due to development of circulating antibodies against non-human CT (5Singer F.R. Aldred J.P. Neer R.M. Krane S.M. Potts Jr., J.T. Bloch K.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1972; 51: 2331-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and/or loss of responsiveness to CT, presumably via receptor down-regulation and inhibition of new receptor synthesis (6Wada S. Martin T.J. Findlay D.M. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2611-2621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, human CT (hCT) easily associates and precipitates as insoluble fibrils (7Arvinte T. Cudd A. Drake A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6415-6422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which limits its usefulness as a therapeutic. Structure-activity relationship of CT from various species has been studied extensively. In organic solvents (8Meyer J.-P. Pelton J.T. Hoflack J. Saudek V. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 9Meadows R.P. Nikonowicz E.P. Jones C.R. Bastian J.W. Gorenstein D.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) sCT assumes an amphipathic α-helix in the region 8–22, whereas in SDS (10Motta A. Pastore A. Goud N.A. Castiglione Morelli M.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10444-10450Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 11Castiglione Morelli M.A. Pastore A. Motta A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 335-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) the helix spans the region 6–22, with the C-terminal tail folded back toward the helix. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (12Amodeo P. Motta A. Strazzullo G. Castiglione Morelli M.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have indicated that the stable helix of sCT is confined in the region 9–19, with the flanking residues 6–8 and 20–22 acting as stabilizers and the C terminus interacting with the helix. Among the structural determinants suggested to explain CT bioactivity, a role for the central helix has been put forward for activity, aggregation, and fibril formation. Kaiser and coworkers (13Moe G.R. Kaiser E.T. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1971-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 14Green III, F.R. Lynch B. Kaiser E.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8340-8344Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) provided evidence that the model of an amphipathic helix in the region 8–22 is a useful guide to designing potent sCT activity, although the primacy of conformational flexibility over amphipathicity has been invoked as an important parameter for activity (15Epand R.M. Epand R.F. Orlowski R.C. Seyler J.K. Colescott R.L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1964-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These apparently conflicting results could be explained by the existence of subtypes of CT receptor (CTR) showing variable affinity for helical and non-helical peptides (1Purdue B.W. Tilakaratne N. Sexton P.M. Receptors Channels. 2002; 8: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 16Nakamuta H. Orlowsky R.C. Epand R.M. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Alternative RNA splicing yields multiple CTR mRNA isoforms. In man, at least six potential variants exist (3Gorn A.H. Lin H.Y. Yamin M. Auron P.E. Flannery M.R. Tapp D.R. Manning C.A. Lodish H.F. Krane S.M. Goldring S.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 90: 1726-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 17Moore E.E.

Irving P. Cobb J. Kadwell S. Beaumont K. Rimele T. Kenakin T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 1164-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar); however, the most common human CTR isoforms differ by the presence (hCTRb) or absence (hCTRa) of a 16-amino acid insert between amino acids 174 and 175, within the first intracellular loop of the receptor (19Gorn A.H. Rudolph S.M. Flannery M.R. Morton C.C. Weremowicz S. Wang T.Z. Krane S.M. Goldring S.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 2680-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Of these, the hCTRa is the major human receptor isoform and is expressed in essentially all tissues known to express the CTR. The α-helical central region of CT peptides has been reported to interact directly with the receptor N terminus (20Stroop S.D. Nakamuta H. Küstner R.E. Moore E.E. Epand R.E. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4752-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and a short segment of the hCTRa close to the transmembrane domain 1 is proximal to amino acid 19 of helix (21Pham V. Wade J.D. Purdue B.W. Sexton P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6720-6729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a strict relationship between the binding receptor affinity and the helicity of the hormone has been observed, with a correlation between amphipathicity and potency (16Nakamuta H. Orlowsky R.C. Epand R.M. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 22Epand R.F. Orlowski R.C. Epand R.M. Biopolymers. 2004; 76: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Two questions arise. Does the hormone-receptor interaction require a CT helix of definite length? Is the interaction simulated by any model amphipathic helix, as suggested by Kaiser and co-workers (13Moe G.R. Kaiser E.T. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1971-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 14Green III, F.R. Lynch B. Kaiser E.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8340-8344Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)? Because the higher affinity of sCT in binding CTRs involves residues within the C terminus (amino acids 22–32) of the hormone (23Houssami S. Findlay D.M. Brady C.L. Martin T.J. Epand R.M. Moore E.E. Murayama E. Tamura T. Orlowski R.C. Sexton P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 798-809PubMed Google Scholar) (that is, residues located outside of the helix (12Amodeo P. Motta A. Strazzullo G. Castiglione Morelli M.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar)), we designed an sCT mutant (referred to as Leu23,Ala24-sCT) in which Pro23 and Arg24 were substituted for Leu23 and Ala24, respectively (24Andreotti G. Motta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6364-6370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Insertion of two helix-promoting residues should prolong the helical C terminus, so as to deal with the first question. The second question was tackled by analyzing the conformational properties by circular dichroism (CD) and NMR spectroscopies of a number of sCT analogs showing variable helix length in SDS. Furthermore, we evaluated the receptor binding affinity and the in vivo hypocalcemic activity, which were linked to the helical length and chemical properties of the hydrophobic face. Our structural and biological data together with those of other CT analogs suggest a strict relationship between the amphipathic α-helix of definite length, located in the 9–19 region, and the biological activity of sCT. Because of variability of calcitonin sequences in that region (in particular, for sCT and hCT, 10 of the 16 amino acid substitutions are concentrated in the segment 8–22), it is suggested that the helix does not have to be a perfect amphipathic α-helix; it can be distorted or somewhat shortened but located in the 9–19 region. Also important is the Leu distribution within the helix; in fact, CT bioactivity is altered when Leu is substituted for Ala, showing that the chemical properties of the hydrophobic side chains within the helix are relevant for receptor binding affinity and the in vivo hypocalcemic activity.

Peptide chain assembly was performed using N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl chemistry (25Carpino L.A. Han G.Y. J. Org.

Peptide purity was confirmed by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry using a Bruker Biflex instrument (Bremen, Germany) in the linear mode at 19.5 kV. NMR Experiments—For acquisition of NMR spectra, the concentration of each sample in 90% 1H2O, 10% 2H2O (Cortec-Net, Paris, France), and 100% 2H2O was 0.0012 mm. Solid perdeuterated SDS (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Woburn, MA) was added, and its concentration was maintained well above the critical micelle concentration, with a peptide-SDS molar ratio of about 1:120. 1H NMR spectra, acquired at the NMR Service of Istituto di Chimica Biomolecolare del CNR (Pozzuoli, Italy), were recorded at 600 MHz on a Bruker DRX-600 spectrometer using an inverse multinuclear probe head fitted with gradients along the x, y, and z axes. Spectra were referenced to internal sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl)-(2,2,3,3-2H4) propionate (Aldrich). Clean total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) (27Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn.

Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4825) Google Scholar) spectra were recorded by using the time-proportional phase incrementation of the first pulse and incorporating the excitation sculpting sequence (30Hwang T.-L. Shaka A.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1995; 112: 275-279Crossref Scopus (1539) Google Scholar) for water suppression. We used a double-pulsed field gradient echo with a soft square pulse of 4 ms at the water resonance frequency, with the gradient pulses of 1 ms each in duration. In general, 512 equally spaced evolution time period t1 values were acquired averaging 16 transients of 2048 points, with 6024 Hz of spectral width. Time-domain data matrices were all zero-filled to 4096 points in both dimensions, thus yielding a digital resolution of 2.94 Hz/point. Before Fourier transformation, a Lorentz-Gauss window with different parameters was applied for both t1 and t2 dimensions for all the experiments. NOESY spectra were obtained with different mixing times (0.10, 0.20, and 0.25 s); TOCSY experiments were recorded with a spin-lock period of 64 and 96 ms, achieved with the MLEV-17 pulse sequence. Both NOESY and TOCSY experiments were performed at 310 and 324 K. 3JHNα coupling constants of isolated resonances were measured from one-dimensional experiments acquired with 131,072 points after application of strong Lorentian-Gaussian resolution enhancement. Structure Calculations for Leu23,Ala24-sCT; Simulated Annealing and Molecular Dynamics Refinement—Distance restraints were obtained from NOESY spectra of Leu23,Ala24-sCT recorded with 0.10- and 0.25-s mixing times in SDS micelles at 300, 310, and 324 K. Spectra taken at all temperatures show no significant differences in the distribution and intensity of NOE cross-peaks along the whole peptide sequence, thus indicating a similar solution structure. NOE volumes were integrated and calibrated with the TRIAD software (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO). In all, 304 NOE cross-peaks (97 intraresidual, 207 sequential and medium range) were converted into upper-limit distances and used together with van der Waals radii as distance restraints for structure calculations with the AMBER 6 package (31Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.S. Cheatham III, T.E. DeBolt S. Ferguson D. Seibel G. Kollman P. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 1-41Crossref Scopus (2642) Google Scholar). As described for native hCT (32Motta A. Andreotti G. Amodeo P. Strazzullo G. Castiglione Morelli M.A. Proteins. 1998; 32: 314-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and sCT (12Amodeo P. Motta A. Strazzullo G. Castiglione Morelli M.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we used different NOE cross-peak reference for the calibration of intraresidual and interresidual NOEs. Furthermore, independent calibrations were performed for the NH-NH, the NH-aliphatic, and the aliphatic-aliphatic regions of NOESY spectra. Intraresidual NOEs were calibrated by using the Gln14 NHi-αCHi (0.27 nm) and the Pro32 αCHi-βCHi (0.27 nm) NOEs for the NH-aliphatic and the aliphatic-aliphatic regions, respectively. Calibration of interresidual NOEs was achieved assigning regular intrahelical distances to isolated cross-peaks between residues for which an unambiguous experimental evidence of an helical conformation exists, i.e. the Lys11-Leu12 NHi-NHi + 1 (0.28 nm), the Lys11-Leu12 αCHi-NHi + 1 (0.35 nm), and the Ser13-Leu16 αCHi-βCHi + 3 (0.29 nm) cross-peaks. Finally, all of the distances calculated from NOESY spectra acquired with 0.10-s mixing time were used with a tolerance of +10%, whereas a 20% tolerance was allowed for those coming from spectra recorded at longer mixing time. The self-consistency of the choice of reference distances was checked in the resulting structures. Additional conformational restraints were inferred from 3JNHα scalar couplings constraints. Only 11 scalar couplings were considered with values falling clearly below the 6–8-Hz region, a range that usually indicate rotationally averaged torsion angles (33Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986: 162-175Google Scholar). Restraints on the trans amide bonds were also imposed. The ω dihedral angles were restrained in the range of 170–190 degrees. The β-methylene groups were stereospecifically assigned with the program HABAS (34Güntert P. Braun W. Billeter M. Wüthrich K.

When no stereospecific assignment was possible for methyl and methylene protons, the r–6 distance-weighted ambiguous restraints were used. The Leu23,Ala24-sCT starting structure was generated with the AMBER 6 package using the special residue data base with reduced charges for amino acid side chains. We used the AMBER 91 all-atom forcefield (35Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. Nguyen D.T. Case D.A. J. Comput. Chem. 1986; 7: 230-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (3589) Google Scholar) to compute the intrinsic strain energy and, additionally, a parabolic or linear penalty function for NOE distance bounds and torsion angles restraints. The force constants for distance and torsion angle restraints were, respectively, 8.33 × 103 kJ mol–1 nm–2 and 83.33 kJ mol–1 rad–2. Inall in vacuo calculations a distance-dependent dielectric function was used to mimic the presence of a high dielectric constant solvent, with a cutoff radius of 0.8 nm for nonbonded interactions and a residue-based pair-list routine. Structures were sampled and refined with a restrained simulated annealing (SA)/energy minimization approach previously described (36Jourdan F. Lazzaroni S. López Méndez B. de Julio M. Lo Cantore P. Amodeo P. Iacobellis N.S. Evidente A. Motta A. Proteins. 2003; 52: 534-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) giving a final set of 50 structures. Subsequently, MD calculations in methanol were performed on the lowest energy Leu23,Ala24-sCT structure using the particle mesh Ewald method (37Darden T. York D. Pedersen L. J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (20420) Google Scholar) for calculating the full electrostatic energy of the unit cell. The AMBER-OPLS united atom force field (38Jorgensen W.L. Tirado-Rives J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (4028) Google Scholar) was employed for the peptide in conjunction with explicit methanol molecules and chloride counterions (39Lybrand T.P. McCammonn J.A. Wipff G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 833-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The Leu23,Ala24-sCT initial structure was first neutralized with 3 chloride ions and subsequently solvated with 3211 methanol molecules in a periodic rectangular box (edge lengths of 6.94, 4.81, and 5.07 nm). Preparation and equilibration of the unit cell before the 1000-ps production run was performed as reported (36Jourdan F. Lazzaroni S. López Méndez B. de Julio M. Lo Cantore P. Amodeo P. Iacobellis N.S. Evidente A. Motta A. Proteins. 2003; 52: 534-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Throughout the 1000-ps production run we collected coordinates, velocities, and energy every 10 ps to perform statistical analysis. Simulations were performed in the nTP ensemble (T = 300 K and P = 1 atm) with a constant temperature and constant pressure relaxation times, respectively, of 0.05 and 0.2 ps for the equilibration runs and 1 and 2 ps for the 1000-ps production run. The molecular graphics program MOLMOL (40Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6476) Google Scholar) was used to analyze and represent the three-dimensional structures of Leu23,Ala24-sCT. As reference, the same calculation procedure was applied to sCT. The solution structures of sCT and Leu23,Ala24-sCT have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (codes 2GLH and 2GLG, respectively). In Vivo Hypocalcemic Assay—Biological activity was estimated by in vivo hypocalcemic activity assay. Eight-week-old Wistar male rats (Japan SLC, Hamamatsu, Japan; Morini SAS, Polo D'Enza, Italy) whose body weights were in the range of 220–240 g were used. Rats were withdrawn food at least 12 h before experiments. All calcitonins were diluted with 1% gelatin in 0.9% NaCl solution at pH 3.2 and injected into subcutaneous space. Doses used were 7.5, 25, 75, 250, and 750 ng/kg of body weight for sCT and 25, 75, 250, and 750 ng/kg for different calcitonins. Blood (0.5 ml) was collected from the tail vein at 0, 1, and 3 h after administration, and Ca2+ levels in plasma were measured by Ca2+/pH analyzer (634, CIBA Corning Diagnostics). The hypocalcemic response of each dose was normalized to that observed for 750 ng/kg of sCT, since it was found that a dose of 750 ng/kg of sCT was sufficient for the plateau to be reached. The following formula was used: Hypocalcemic response (&percnt;)=[Ca2+]0 h−[Ca2+]1 h after admin[Ca2+]0 h−[Ca2+]1 h after admin 750 ng/kg sCT×100 The dose-response curve was made by linear regression, and 50% of effective dose (ED50) value was calculated. Cell Culture—Human breast cancer T 47D cells were cultured as described (20Stroop S.D. Nakamuta H. Küstner R.E. Moore E.E. Epand R.E. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4752-4756Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) in RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% streptomycin/penicillin, 0.1 μm insulin, and 0.1 μm hydrocortisone in 5% CO2 and 310 K. The latter hormones were omitted from the medium when subculturing cells to be used 1–3 days later for the receptor binding assay. Subculturing was performed with trypsin/EDTA as described (41Kazantzis A. Waldner M. Taylor J.W. Kapurniotu A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 780-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 42Lamp S.J. Findlay D.M. Moseley J.M. Martin T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12269-12274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and for the binding experiments cells were subcultured in 12-well dishes. Receptor binding experiments were performed when cells reached 90% confluence (1–3 days after subculture). Receptor Binding Assay—The assay was performed according to established protocols (41Kazantzis A. Waldner M. Taylor J.W. Kapurniotu A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 780-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 42Lamp S.J. Findlay D.M. Moseley J.M. Martin T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12269-12274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells in the 12-well dishes were washed with NaCl/Pi (1 ml) at room temperature, and then prewarmed (310 K) assay buffer (RPMI 1640 and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) was added to the cells (950 μl). Lyophilized 125I-labeled sCT (5 μCi, specific activity 2000 μCi·mmol–1) was reconstituted in 100 mm HCl (200 μl), separated into aliquots at 277 K in Eppendorf tubes (15 μl each), and kept at 253 K, and for each 12-well plate one tube was thawed at room temperature, diluted with assay buffer (250 μl), and used immediately. Twenty microliters of the 125I-labeled sCT solution (15.2 pmol) were then added to each well, and the wells were mixed by gentle shaking. Thereafter, solutions (50 μl) of different concentrations of the peptides in assay buffer were added to the cells, and after gentle mixing cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Peptide solutions were freshly made before each experiment by diluting peptide stocks (≈500 μm in 1 mm HCl) (43Kapurniotu A. Taylor J.W. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 836-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) in assay buffer. Binding was terminated by aspiration of the medium and washing of the cells with NaCl/Pi three times. Cells were then removed from the wells by short treatment (1 min) with 0.5 m NaOH (2 × 0.5 ml), and bound radioactivity was assessed by γ-counting (counter efficiency ≈ 75%). Nonspecific binding was determ"
https://openalex.org/W1986140188,"The principal bridge connecting the erythrocyte membrane to the spectrin-based skeleton is established by band 3 and ankyrin; mutations leading to reduced bridge formation or increased bridge rupture result in morphological and mechanical abnormalities. Because membrane mechanical properties are determined in part by the protein interactions that stabilize the membrane, we have evaluated the rates of rupture and reattachment of band 3-ankyrin bridges under both resting and mechanically stressed conditions. To accomplish this, we have examined the rate of ankyrin displacement from inside-out vesicles by the hexahistidine-tagged cytoplasmic domain of band 3, cdb3-(His)6 and the rate of substitution of cdb3-(His)6 into endogenous band 3-ankyrin bridges in resealed erythrocytes in the presence and absence of shear stress. We demonstrate that 1) exogenous cdb3-(His)6 displaces endogenous ankyrin from IOVs with a half-time and first order rate constant of 42 ± 14 min and 0.017 ± 0.0058 min−1, respectively; 2) exogenous cdb3-(His)6 substitutes endogenous band 3 in its linkage to ankyrin in resealed cells with a half-time and first order rate constant of 12 ± 3.6 min and 0.060 ± 0.019 min−1, respectively; 3) cdb3-(His)6-mediated rupture of the band 3-ankyrin bridge in resealed cells results in decreased membrane mechanical stability, decreased deformability, abnormal morphology, and spontaneous vesiculation of the cells; and 4) the above on/off rates are not significantly accelerated by mechanical shear stress. We conclude that the off rates of the band 3-ankyrin interaction are sufficiently slow to allow sustained erythrocyte deformation without loss of elasticity."

The question of whether or not Orf1.9 (wcaH) is a bona fide member of the Nudix hydrolase superfamily is discussed. Due to the rapid advances in DNA sequencing technology over the past several years, there has been an explosive addition of partial nucleotide sequences and whole genomes from a multitude of organisms deposited in the data banks. These nucleotide sequences are analyzed by specialized “gene finder” software, so the identification of genes is no longer the purview of the geneticist who relies on some discernible function, or phenotype, for discovery. Consequently, large numbers of genes are being discovered and decoded into open reading frames representing proteins of unknown functions. The goal of functional genomics, or proteomics, is to discover roles played by these orphan proteins, whether they be structural, regulatory, or enzymatic. A major tool in annotating or relating a protein to a function is the recognition of structural motifs or amino acid signature sequences. In this vein, we have discovered a superfamily of enzymes related by the similarity of their substrates and defined by a highly conserved sequence of amino acids, the “Nudix box” 3Since there is considerable variation in the position of the Nudix box in respect to the N terminus of individual members of the Nudix hydrolase superfamily, it has become awkward to use the standard numbering system (from N- to C-terminal) to specify amino acids within the conserved Nudix sequence when discussing different proteins. We suggest numbering the signature sequence separately and consecutively from 1-23 as follows: GXXXXXEXXXXXXXREUXEEXGU (1234567...... .15......23). Amino acids in the Nudix box could then be designated as follows: G1N, X5N, E7N, R15N, etc., and an amino acid substitution by alanine, for example, would be designated as G1NA, X5NA, E7NA etc. according to standard convention. as follows,G1XXXXXEXXXXXXXREUXEEXGU23SCHEME 1 where X represents any amino acid, and U is usually a bulky hydrophobic amino acid, such as Leu, Val, or Ile. This amino acid motif is of highly predictive value, because proteins (enzymes) containing the Nudix box invariably catalyze the hydrolysis of nucleoside diphosphates linked to some other moiety, X, hence the acronym, Nudix (1Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. O'Handley S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25059-25062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), although in a few cases other organic compounds containing pyrophosphate linkages are also hydrolyzed. At this writing, over 2000 members of the superfamily from 200 species ranging from viruses to humans have been identified through BLAST (2Altschul S.F. Gish W. Meyers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 203: 403-410Crossref Scopus (70758) Google Scholar) searches, and we have been systematically cloning, expressing, and characterizing their activities. The range of substrates includes, among others, nucleoside triphosphates, nucleotide sugars, ADP-ribose, various coenzymes, and diadenosine oligophosphates of the form adenosine(5′)pn(5′)adenosine, where n = 3-6. All free living organisms contain at least one Nudix gene, and many have several genes coding for different Nudix hydrolases, although the number of representatives in each species seems to be dependent on factors other than genome size. Bacillus cereus has 26 genes, Saccharomyces cerevisiae has 7, Drosophila melanogaster has 20, and Homo sapiens has 22, with respective genome sizes of 5.4, 13, 165, and 3200 Mb. Escherichia coli, with a genome of 4.6 Mb and 13 Nudix hydrolase genes, may be considered the progenitor of the superfamily, since it was the first organism revealing the amino acid signature sequence diagnostic of the family, and it may be considered paradigmatic of the rest of the extended family, because several of the enzymes first discovered in E. coli have since been found in other prokaryotes, archaea, and eukaryotes. Eleven of the 13 E. coli Nudix proteins contain the consensus Nudix box, one (Orf191) has a conservative replacement of lysine for arginine (R15NK), 3Since there is considerable variation in the position of the Nudix box in respect to the N terminus of individual members of the Nudix hydrolase superfamily, it has become awkward to use the standard numbering system (from N- to C-terminal) to specify amino acids within the conserved Nudix sequence when discussing different proteins. We suggest numbering the signature sequence separately and consecutively from 1-23 as follows: GXXXXXEXXXXXXXREUXEEXGU (1234567...... .15......23).

We have previously identified enzymatic activities for eight of these proteins. In this paper, we describe the cloning and expression of three more of the Nudix genes and the identification of their respective enzymatic activities. Thus, 11 of the 13 Nudix candidates have now been accounted for. Oligonucleotide primers were from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA); expression plasmids, and E. coli hosts were from Novagen (Madison, WI) or laboratory stocks; E. coli chromosomal DNA for cloning was prepared in this laboratory from strain MG1655 was kindly provided by Dr. Frederick R. Blattner (University of Wisconsin). Restriction enzymes, kits for the polymerase chain reaction, calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, and yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Substrates and common biochemicals were from Sigma, and the Bradford reagent (3Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 242-254Crossref Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) for protein determinations was from Bio-Rad. Cloning of the Nudix Genes of E. coli into pET Expression Vectors—The genes were amplified from genomic DNA using the DNA polymerase chain reaction incorporating NdeI and BamHI sites at the start and end of the gene. The amplified DNA was cut with the appropriate restriction enzyme and ligated into pET11b (orf141 and orf153) or pET24a (orf191 and orf192) under control of the T7 lac promoter. The resultant plasmids were transformed into HMS174(DE3), the transformants were screened for the correct size insert, and the cloned fragments were sequenced at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine facility. Permanent stocks of the cells were stored at −80 °C in LB broth containing 10% dimethyl sulfoxide. Growth and Expression of the Transformed Cells—One colony of the expression strain was inoculated into 40 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (pET11b) or 30 μg/ml kanamycin (pET24a), incubated on a rotary shaker at 37 °C overnight, transferred to 2 liters of the same medium, and grown to an A600 of 0.8. At this point, the cells were derepressed by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a concentration of 1 mm, incubated for an additional 3 h, after which the cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed in buffered isotonic saline solution, and frozen at −80 °C. Purification of the Enzymes—All of the following steps were conducted at 0-4 °C. The expressed proteins of Orf141 and Orf153 were extracted from the thawed cells into 2.5 volumes of buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. Orf191 was not extractable under these conditions, so the cells were sonicated in 2.5 volumes of buffer A and centrifuged, and the precipitate was discarded. The extracts were adjusted to protein concentrations of 10 mg/ml with buffer A, and the nucleic acids were precipitated by the dropwise addition of 10% streptomycin sulfate to a final concentration of 1.5%. The precipitates were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatants were adjusted to 70% saturation with solid ammonium sulfate. After 1 h on ice, the precipitates were collected, dissolved in a minimal volume of buffer A, and chromatographed on a gel filtration column of Sephadex, G-100 (2.5 × 50 cm), equilibrated and run with 200 mm NaCl in buffer A. Fractions were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and those estimated to be >90% pure were combined and concentrated by pressure dialysis or by precipitation with ammonium sulfate. Enzyme Assays—The standard reaction mixture contained the following in 50 μl: 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, 5 mm Mg2+ or Mn2+, 2 mm substrate, and 0.5 units of yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase for nucleoside triphosphates when PPi was one of the products, and 0.2-2 milliunits of enzyme. Assay of all other substrates depends on the conversion of a phosphatase-resistant substrate to a phosphatase sensitive product, and 3 units of alkaline phosphatase was substituted for the inorganic pyrophosphatase. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and stopped by the addition of Norit (charcoal activated by an acid wash) for nucleoside triphosphates or EDTA for other substrates, and the liberated inorganic orthophosphate was assayed by the colorimetric procedure of Fiske and SubbaRow (4Fiske C.H. SubbaRow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) as modified by Ames and Dubin (5Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol.

The enzymatic rates obtained with this assay are reliable to approximately ±10%. Gene Cloning, Expression, and Enzyme Purification—Cloning of all three genes went without incident, and the plasmid inserts were sequenced and found to be identical to those reported in the data banks. As with some of the other Nudix hydrolases (6Dunn C.A. O'Handley S.F. Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. J. Biol.

This left the bulk of the cellular proteins behind, thereby considerably simplifying the purification procedure. At present, there is no satisfactory explanation as to why only a subset of the expressed Nudix hydrolases are extractable under these conditions. It does not appear to reflect their localization within the cell, since foreign proteins expressed in E. coli also follow this unpredictable behavior. Identification of Enzyme Activities and Specificities—A unifying property of the Nudix hydrolases is their activity on nucleoside diphosphate derivatives, although these substrates may vary widely for different members of the superfamily. It has been possible to classify some of the proteins into subfamilies based on landmark amino acids outside of the Nudix box that are diagnostic of enzymes having similar specificities (6Dunn C.A.

However, the three proteins described here do not have any distinguishing characteristics of predictive value. Accordingly, the enzymes were tested with a battery of nucleoside diphosphate derivatives. Orf141—Table 1 shows that Orf141 prefers the pyrimidine deoxynucleoside triphosphates dUTP, dTTP, and dCTP and is less active on the corresponding diphosphates. Since the Nudix hydrolases Orf17 (7O'Handley S.F. Frick D.N. Bullions L.F. Mildvan A.S. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24649-24654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), MutT (14Bhatnagar S.K. Bullions L.C. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9050-9054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Orf135 (10O'Handley S.F. Dunn C.A. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5421-5426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) prefer dATP, dGTP, and dCTP, respectively, the activity of Orf141 for dTTP completes the set of enzymes in E. coli active on the four canonical deoxynucleoside triphosphates. Like the other three enzymes, the products of the hydrolysis catalyzed by Orf141 are a nucleoside monophosphate and inorganic pyrophosphate according to the following reaction.dTTP+H2O→dTMP+PP1REACTION 1 When inorganic pyrophosphatase is omitted from the standard assay, dTMP is produced, as measured by high pressure liquid chromatography, but no Pi is formed (data not shown). It has been demonstrated previously by conducting the enzymatic hydrolysis in H218O, that the mechanism of hydrolysis catalyzed by the Nudix hydrolases, MutT dGTPase (15Weber D.J. Bhatnagar S.K. Bullions L.C. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16939-16942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Orf17 dATPase (7O'Handley S.F. Frick D.N. Bullions L.F. Mildvan A.S. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24649-24654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), is by nucleophilic attack on the β-phosphorus, leading to the formation of the corresponding nucleoside monophosphate and PPi. In all likelihood, Orf141 dTTPase follows the same mechanism as well as for the hydrolysis of nucleoside diphosphates (Table 1) to nucleoside monophosphates and Pi.TABLE 1Substrate specificities of Orf141 and Orf153 All substrates were present at a concentration of 2 mm in the standard colorimetric enzyme assays described under “Methods.”SubstrateOrf141Orf153Specific activityaA unit of enzyme hydrolyzes 1 μmol of substrate/min under standard assay conditionsRelative activitySpecific activityRelative activityunits mg−1%units mg−1%dUTP57(100)dTTP3867327dCTP3358111dGTP916327dATP814218dTDP2340873dCDP1629763dGDP916655dADP916982UTP916327CTP24218GTP24327ATP12218UDP611327CDP1018545GDP5911(100)ADP36545NMPsbNucleoside monophosphates, ADP-ribose<1<2<0.5<5NADH, GDP-mannosea A unit of enzyme hydrolyzes 1 μmol of substrate/min under standard assay conditionsb Nucleoside monophosphates Open table in a new tab Orf153—This enzyme differs from all four of the other Nudix nucleoside triphosphatases in E. coli in the following respects. 1) It hydrolyzes nucleoside triphosphates in a stepwise manner, forming Pi instead of PPi. Thus, inorganic pyrophosphatase can be omitted from the assay. 2) It has no general preference for deoxyribose or ribose. 3) The nucleoside diphosphates are generally as good substrates as the triphosphates. None of the other Nudix hydrolase substrates tested, including NADH, GDP-mannose, and ADP-ribose, are acted upon by the enzyme. It is interesting that with the exception of GDP, Orf141 has much higher or equal activities on their common substrates compared with Orf153, raising the question as to what role Orf153 might play in the cell. Orf191—In our original BLAST searches of the E. coli genome, we missed Orf191, most likely due to the replacement of the highly conserved arginine (R15N) by a lysine (Fig. 1). Subsequently, using less stringent search criteria, we identified Orf191 as a potential Nudix hydrolase with a conservative R14NK substitution, and the proline 15 amino acids downstream of the Nudix box suggested that it might be a member of the ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase subfamily (6Dunn C.A. O'Handley S.F. Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32318-32324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we tested the expressed protein and found that it did indeed catalyze the hydrolysis of ADP-ribose, but a subsequent survey of related compounds revealed that GDP-mannose was a better substrate. Table 2 compares the relative activities of Orf191 on several potential substrates. It appears that the enzyme prefers purine over pyrimidine nucleotide sugars (compare GDP-glucose with UDP- and CDP-glucose) and, within the purine series, prefers a 6-keto over a 6-amino group (compare GDP-mannose, IDP-ribose, and GDP-glucose with ADP-ribose and ADP-glucose). X-ray crystallographic analysis of the enzyme-substrate complex should provide the structural basis of the specificity of the enzyme. 4S. B. Gabelli, L. M. Amzel, and M. J. Bessman, work in progress.TABLE 2Substrate specificity of Orf191 All substrates were present at a concentration of 2 mm in the standard colorimetric enzyme assays described under “Methods.”SubstrateSpecific activityaA unit of enzyme hydrolyzes 1 μmol of substrate/min under standard assay conditionsRelative activityunits mg−1%GDP-mannose166(100)IDP-ribose15694GDP-glucose7344ADP-ribose3722UDP-glucose2515CDP-glycerol2012FAD138NADH32ADP-glucose, CDP-glucose, (d)NTPs, (d)NDPs, and Ap4AbAdenosine 5′-tetraphospho-5′-adenosine<1<1a A unit of enzyme hydrolyzes 1 μmol of substrate/min under standard assay conditionsb Adenosine 5′-tetraphospho-5′-adenosine Open table in a new tab The enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of the pyrophosphate bond, always releasing a nucleoside monophosphate and a phosphorylated moiety, depending on the substrate. For GDP-mannose, the reaction may be written as follows.GDP-mannose+H2O→GMP+mannose-1-phosphateREACTION 2 In the absence of alkaline phosphatase, no Pi is liberated during the course of the reaction, whereas in its presence, 2 mol of Pi are liberated per mol of GDP-mannose hydrolyzed. Other Properties of the Enzymes—As with all the other Nudix hydrolases characterized so far, these three enzymes absolutely require a divalent cation cofactor for activity, and Mg2+ at 5 mm is optimum. Also characteristic of the members of the superfamily, the three enzymes are optimally active in the alkaline range around pH 8.5. Both Orf141 and Orf153 elute from a calibrated gel filtration column as monomers, whereas Orf191 with a molecular mass of 20 kDa elutes as a 60-kDa homotrimer. One other Nudix hydrolase, the MutX dGTPase from Streptococcus pneumoniae, also behaves as a trimer in solution (16Bullions L.C. Méjean V. Claverys J.P. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12339-12344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase from E. coli (17Gabelli S.B. Bianchet M.A. Bessman M.J. Amzel L.M. Nat. Struct. 2001; 8: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and the diadenosine tetraphosphate pyrophosphatase from Deinococcus radiodurans (18Ranatunga W. Hill E.E. Mooster J.L.

Thus, quaternary structure is not a common feature of members of the Nudix hydrolase superfamily. The kinetic constants for the three enzymes are shown in Table 3 along with the constants for Orf1.9, another GDP-mannose hydrolase present in E. coli. Orf1.9 was one of the original open reading frames detected in our first BLAST search for proteins containing the Nudix signature sequence (19Méjean V. Salles C. Bullions L.C. Bessman M.J. Claverys J.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and at that time, we noticed that there were some differences in the arrangement of amino acids in its Nudix box. Two of the highly conserved amino acids, E16N and E19N were replaced by a leucine and alanine, respectively (Fig. 1). Nevertheless, we found that the expressed and purified protein was active on the nucleoside diphosphate, GDP-mannose (9Frick D.N. Townsend B.D. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24086-24091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), suggesting that the enzyme was a bona fide member of the Nudix hydrolases. In addition to the amino acid discrepancies, we were also surprised by the products of the reaction, which were GDP and free mannose according to the following reaction.GDP-mannose+H2O→GDP+mannoseREACTION 3 In all other Nudix hydrolase reactions, the nucleophilic attack is on phosphorus, resulting in the cleavage of a pyrophosphate linkage, whereas the mechanism of Orf1.9 involves attack on carbon as has been shown by NMR of a reaction run in H218O (20Legler P.M. Massiah M.A. Bessman M.J. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8603-8608Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Our recent discovery of Orf191, an authentic GDP-mannose pyrophosphatase member of the Nudix hydrolases, raises the question as to whether Orf1.9 is indeed a member of the family. Comparison of the kinetic constants in Table 3 shows that Orf191 has a kcat 150 times higher and a catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) 60 times higher than Orf1.9. An attractive hypothesis is that Orf1.9 is an example of convergent evolution, not gene duplication as is the case for all other members of the superfamily, and that hydrolysis of GDP-mannose is not the physiological role of the enzyme. One possibility is that Orf1.9 is in reality a GDP-mannosyl transferase that transfers mannose to water in the absence of its physiological acceptor. Precedence for this has been seen with phage T-4 β-glucosyltransferase (21Moréra S. Imberty A. Aschke-Sonnenborn U. Rüger W. Freemont P.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 717-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and the UDP-glucosyltransferase of Clostridium difficile toxin (22Ciesla W.P. Bobak D.A. J. Biol.

In Fig. 1B, two as yet unidentified open reading frames are shown. Most likely, Orf192 is a CoA pyrophosphatase, because it has an amino acid motif upstream of the Nudix box (shown in boldface type, underlined), designating the CoA pyrophosphatase subfamily of the Nudix hydrolases (13Cartwright J.L. Gasmi L. Spiller D.G. McLennan A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32925-32930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, we have cloned and expressed Orf192 into several vectors and hosts, and we have not yet been successful in producing enough soluble protein to identify the activity unequivocally. On the other hand, we have cloned, expressed, and purified Orf180, one of the first open reading frames we uncovered in a BLAST search, and although it is a readily soluble protein and contains a canonical Nudix box, it still remains an enigma."
https://openalex.org/W2048417077,"Currently, the detailed regulation of major pathways of glycerophospholipid synthesis upon cholesterol loading is largely unknown. Therefore, a detailed lipid metabolic profiling using stable isotope-labeled choline, ethanolamine, and serine was performed by quantitative electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) in free cholesterol (FC), oxidized (Ox-LDL) and enzymatically modified LDL (E-LDL)-loaded primary human skin fibroblasts. As previously described, an adaptive induction of phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis via CDP-choline was found upon FC loading. In contrast to PC, CDP-ethanolamine-mediated phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) synthesis was inhibited by FC incubation. Furthermore, FC induced a shift toward polyunsaturated PE and PC species, which was mediated primarily by PE biosynthesis but not PE remodeling, whereas PC species were shifted mainly by fatty acid (FA) remodeling of existing PC. Modified lipoprotein incubation revealed rather different effects on glycerophospholipid synthesis. E-LDL greatly enhanced PC synthesis, whereas Ox-LDL did not change PC synthesis. Addition of different free FAs (FFA) with and without FC coincubation, as major components of E-LDL, clearly indicated an incorporation of FFA into newly synthesized PC and PE species as well as FFA as important driving force for PC synthesis. Because FC and FFA are known to affect lipid membrane properties including membrane curvature, these data support that CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyl-transferase activity and consequently PC synthesis are regulated by modulation of membrane characteristics at the cellular level. In conclusion, the application of high throughput metabolic profiling of major glycerophospholipid pathways by ESI-MS/MS is a powerful tool to unravel mechanisms underlying the regulation of cellular lipid metabolism.

Lipoprotein accumulation and retention in the arterial wall is the first step in a cascade that leads to the development of atherosclerosis (1Williams K.J. Tabas I. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Enrichment of lipid-loaded macrophage foam cells in the subendothelium of the vessel wall is a hallmark of atherosclerosis (2Ross R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar).

The best characterized modification is the oxidation of LDL (3Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. Witztum J.L. Annu. Rev. Med. 1992; 43: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The emerging non-aggregated and non-opsonized minimally oxidized LDL (Ox-LDL) is preferentially internalized via receptor-mediated uptake through clathrin-coated pits (4Jessup W. Wilson P. Gaus K. Kritharides L. Vascul. Pharmacol. 2002; 38: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 5Steinbrecher U.P. Witztum J.L. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. Arteriosclerosis. 1987; 7: 135-143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another modification relates to the enzymatic digestion of LDL (E-LDL) retained in the vessel wall. E-LDL consists of liposome like cholesteryl ester core-depleted lipoprotein particles with a high amount of free cholesterol (FC) and free fatty acids (FFA). E-LDL is found in atherosclerotic lesions (6Bhakdi S. Lackner K.J. Han S.R. Torzewski M. Husmann M. Thromb. Haemost. 2004; 91: 639-645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is taken up by clathrin-independent and opsonin-driven phagocytosis involving complement and Fcγ receptors leading to macrophage foam cell formation (7Kapinsky M.

Circulation. 2004; 109: 1870-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).Advanced atherosclerotic lesion macrophages accumulate cholesteryl ester (CE) and FC (9Tabas I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), which may exert cytotoxic effects (10Tabas I. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 905-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). FC decreases membrane fluidity (11Huster D. Arnold K. Gawrisch K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17299-17308Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). A balanced FC/phospholipid ratio resulting in a narrow physiological range of membrane fluidity is necessary for integral membrane protein function as well as formation of lipid membrane microdomains (10Tabas I. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 905-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 12Simons K. Ikonen E. Science. 2000; 290: 1721-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). In addition to FC esterification by ACAT (acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase) and FC efflux, cells are able to induce phospholipid synthesis as an adaptive response to FC accumulation (10Tabas I. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 905-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Thus, FC loading increases phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis by induction of the rate-limiting enzyme CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT) in macrophages (13Shiratori Y. Houweling M. Zha X. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29894-29903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and human skin fibroblasts (14Leppimaki P. Mattinen J. Slotte J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6385-6394Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Moreover, cholesterol loading induces sphingomyelin (SM) synthesis (15Leppimaki P. Kronqvist R. Slotte J.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 16Schmitz G. Beuck M. Fischer H. Nowicka G. Robenek H. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1741-1752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another adaptive cellular response is a species shift upon FC loading for PC and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) from saturated and monounsaturated toward polyunsaturated species (17Blom T.S. Koivusalo M. Kuismanen E. Kostiainen R. Somerharju P. Ikonen E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14635-14644Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This increases membrane fluidity because unsaturated species have a lower gel-to-liquid-crystalline phase transition temperature Tm compared with saturated species (18Huang C. Li S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1422: 273-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar).Because no precise information about the influence of cholesterol loading on glycerophospholipid metabolism are available, our aim was to perform a detailed metabolic profiling of the major glycerophospholipid metabolism pathways using electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) in FC-, Ox-LDL-, and E-LDL-loaded primary human skin fibroblasts.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Materials—Methyl alcohol and chloroform were HPLC grade from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), ammonium acetate and acetyl chloride were of the highest analytical grade available purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Cholesteryl esterase was from Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany). Bovine serum albumin, trypsin, free fatty acids, cholesterol, and cholesteryl ester standards were from Sigma; the standards with purities higher than 95%. Phospholipid standards were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). [25,26,26,26,27,27,27-D7]cholesterol, [13C3]serine, [D4]ethanolamine, and [D9]choline chloride were obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA) with an isotope purity higher than 98%. The serine- and choline-depleted Dulbeccos modified Eagle's medium was from PAN Biotech (Aidenbach, Germany). Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Biochrom (Berlin, Germany) and Falcon® 6-well plates were used for cell culture (Becton Dickinson Labware).Cell Culture—Fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with l-glutamine, nonessential amino acids, and 10% fetal calf serum in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. The experiments described were performed with cells at passages 7-14. Mycoplasma contamination of fibroblasts was routinely tested using MycoAlert® Mycoplasma Detection Assay (Cambrex, USA) and only negative tested cells were used for experiments. For lipid analysis, cells were seeded into 6-well plates at a density of 80,000 cells per well. They were grown to confluence and then incubated in serine- and choline-depleted Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mg/ml fatty acid free bovine serum albumin supplemented with 50 μg/ml of [13C3]serine, [D4]ethanolamine, and [D9]choline chloride. In parallel lipid loading was performed using 15 μg/ml FC, 40 μg/ml E-LDL, or Ox-LDL, respectively. At the indicated time points fibroblasts were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 0.2% SDS.Lipoprotein Preparation—LDL (d = 1.019-1.063 g/ml) from sera of normolipidemic volunteers was isolated and enzymatically modified as described previously (19Drobnik W. Borsukova H. Bottcher A. Pfeiffer A. Liebisch G. Schutz G.J. Schindler H. Schmitz G. Traffic. 2002; 3: 268-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) with slight modifications in the preparation of E-LDL. Briefly, for enzymatic modification, LDL was diluted to 2 mg/ml protein in phosphate-buffered saline. Enzyme treatment was performed with trypsin (6.6 μg/ml) and cholesteryl esterase (40 μg/ml) for 48 h at 37 °C. Oxidation of LDL was performed according to published protocols (20Wieland E. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5929-5933Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, LDL was diluted to 1 mg/ml protein in phosphate-buffered saline and dialyzed against 5 μm Cu2+ (42 h, 4 °C). The modified lipoproteins were stored at 4 °C and used within a week.Protein Determination—Protein concentrations were measured using bicinchoninic acid as described previously (21Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18427) Google Scholar). Prior lipid extraction an aliquot of SDS lysed fibroblasts was taken for protein determination.Lipid Extraction—Lipids were extracted according to the procedure described by Bligh and Dyer (22Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42070) Google Scholar) in the presence of not naturally occurring lipid species as internal standards. The chloroform phase was dried in a vacuum centrifuge and dissolved as described below for quantitative lipid analysis.Mass Spectrometry—Lipids were quantified by ESI-MS/MS in positive ion mode (as described previously (23Brugger B.

Acta. 2006; 1761: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar)). Samples were quantified by direct flow injection analysis using the analytical setup described by Liebisch et al. (24Liebisch G. Lieser B. Rathenberg J. Drobnik W. Schmitz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1686: 108-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 25Liebisch G. Binder M. Schifferer R. Langmann T. Schulz B. Schmitz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). A precursor ion scan of m/z 184 specific for phosphocholine containing lipids was used for PC, SM (24Liebisch G. Lieser B. Rathenberg J. Drobnik W. Schmitz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1686: 108-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) (26Liebisch G. Drobnik W. Lieser B. Schmitz G. Clin. Chem. 2002; 48: 2217-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). [D9]Choline-labeled lipids were analyzed by precursor ion scan of m/z 193. Neutral loss scans of m/z 141 and m/z 185 were used for PE and phosphatidylserine (PS), respectively (23Brugger B. Erben G. Sandhoff R. Wieland F.T. Lehmann W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2339-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Analogous, neutral loss scans were used for stable isotope-labeled [D4]PE (m/z 145) and [13C3]PS (m/z 188). FC and CE were quantified using a fragment ion of m/z 369 after selective derivatization of FC using acetyl chloride (25Liebisch G. Binder M. Schifferer R. Langmann T. Schulz B. Schmitz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Additionally, lipids present at low concentration were analyzed in a second run by selected reaction monitoring (SRM) to increase precision (especially for stable isotope labeled species at early time points). Correction of isotopic overlap of lipid species as well as data analysis by self-programmed Excel macros was performed for all lipid classes according to the principles described previously (24Liebisch G. Lieser B. Rathenberg J. Drobnik W. Schmitz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1686: 108-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar).To quantify for all lipid classes analyzed non-naturally occurring lipid species were used as internal standards (PC 28:0, 44:0, LPC 13:0, 19:0, PE 28:0, 40:0, PS 28:0, 40:0, D7-FC, CE 17:0, 22:0). Quantification was performed by standard addition calibration to cell homogenates (lipoproteins) using several naturally occurring lipid species for each lipid class (PC 34:1, 36:2, 38:4, 40:0; SM 16:0, 18:1, 18:0; LPC 16:0, 18:1, 18:0; PE 34:1, 36:2, 38:4, 40:6; PS 34:1, 36:2, 38:4, 40:6; FC, CE 16:0, 18:2, 18:1, 18:0). These calibration lines also were applied for not calibrated species, as follows: Concentrations of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated species were calculated using the closest related saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated calibration line slope, respectively. For example PE 36:2 calibration was used for PE 36:1, PE 36:3, PE 36:4; PE 38:4 calibration was used for PE 38:3 and PE 38:5 and so on. Assuming a similar analytical response for stable isotope labeled and unlabeled species, labeled species were quantified using the internal standards and calibration lines described above. The quantitative values were related to the protein amount of the sample.RESULTSLipid Composition of E-LDL and Ox-LDL—To characterize and compare the lipid composition of LDL, E-LDL, and Ox-LDL ESI-MS/MS was carried out. FC and CE represented the predominant lipid fraction in all three LDL preparations with ∼75 mol% of all analyzed lipids (Fig. 1). In contrast to native LDL, which contains about two-thirds of total cholesterol as CE, enzymatic modification of LDL with trypsin and cholesteryl esterase decreased the proportion of CE to about one-third. Mild oxidation of LDL did not significantly influence the FC fraction, whereas the proportion of CE decreased compared with native LDL. Analysis of Ox-LDL using a precursor ion scan of m/z 369 specific for CE (25Liebisch G. Binder M. Schifferer R. Langmann T. Schulz B. Schmitz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) revealed peaks absent in native LDL or E-LDL (Fig. 1). These peaks likely arise from oxidative modification of the fatty acid moiety of CE (a detailed lipid analysis of LDL modifications will be subject of a separate article).Oxidation of LDL also affected polyunsaturated PC species, reducing the PC fraction from 15 mol% in native LDL to 11 mol% in Ox-LDL. Concomitantly, a strong rise of the LPC fraction was found in Ox-LDL compared with LDL (5-fold to 5 mol%; Fig. 1).Cellular Lipid Level upon Lipid Loading—Primary human skin fibroblasts were loaded with FC, E-LDL, and Ox-LDL, and the lipid loading kinetics were determined by ESI-MS/MS. Cholesterol uptake occurred mainly in the first 24 h, and no major changes in cellular cholesterol levels were observed up to 72 h (data not shown). FC loading increased FC levels to 275%, whereas E-LDL and Ox-LDL increased cellular FC only to 165 and 143% (Table 1), respectively. In contrast to FC loading, where only a marginal increase was observed to 130%, modified lipoproteins induced cellular CE levels of almost 300% compared with unloaded controls (Table 1). Interestingly, FC loading did not increase total PC concentration and led to a remarkable decrease of 40% of total PE level. Modified LDL slightly increased cellular PC level (Table 1), which may be caused by the high content of PC in E-LDL and Ox-LDL (Fig. 1). PE and PS are only minor components of modified LDL (Fig. 1), fitting to minor changes observed in cellular PE and PS level upon E-LDL and Ox-LDL loading (Table 1).TABLE 1Cellular uptake of FC and modified lipoproteins Lipid concentration of unloaded control is shown in nmol per mg cell protein after 24 h of treatment. Lipid concentration measured after cholesterol loading is expressed as percentage of unloaded control. Values are mean ± S.D. of one representative experiment of four each performed in triplicate. The following variations were observed between different experiments (CV): 15% (FC), 49% (CE), 16% (PC), 25% (PE) and 9% (PS).Lipid speciesControlFCE-LDLOx-LDLnmol/mg protein% control% control% controlCellular FC119 ± 11275 ± 27165 ± 14143 ± 13Cellular CE6.3 ± 1.1129 ± 16292 ± 24284 ± 56Cellular PC138 ± 1798 ± 6120 ± 9112 ± 4Cellular PE41 ± 361 ± 3111 ± 9104 ± 2Cellular PS31 ± 1116 ± 6114 ± 9109 ± 10 Open table in a new tab Effects of Lipid Loading on [D9]PC—One major goal of the present study was to investigate the effects of FC and lipoprotein loading on cellular glycerophospholipid metabolism. Therefore, parallel to loading with lipids stable isotope-labeled precursors were used to monitor the main pathways of glycerophospholipid metabolism (Fig. 2A). [D9]Choline, [D4]ethanolamine, and [13C3]serine labels were substituted in medium deficient for the natural compounds. Both unlabeled and stable isotope-labeled phospholipids were analyzed by ESI-MS/MS using specific scan types (see “Experimental Procedures”). As expected, newly synthesized PC was solely derived from the Kennedy pathway via CK, CT, and CPT resulting in [D9]PC, but no [D4]PC derived from PE N-methylation was detected (data not shown). Although total PC levels were only marginally influenced (Table 1), pronounced changes were observed in the de novo synthesis of PC upon lipid loading (Fig. 3). Whereas Ox-LDL did not significantly change PC synthesis, FC incubation led to a 40% increase in PC synthesis compared with unloaded control. E-LDL revealed an almost 2-fold increase of PC synthesis compared with control (Fig. 3).FIGURE 2Stable isotope labeling of major glycerophospholipid metabolism pathways. Displayed are the incorporation of stable isotope labels into PS by head group transfer either from PE or PC as well as via Kennedy pathway in ethanolamine- and choline-derived PE and PC (A), respectively. B shows pathways of glycerophospholipid species modifications, which occur without label incorporation: On the one hand transacylation of fatty acids from a phospholipid to any lysophospholipid (CoA-dependent or independent). On the other hand phospholipase-mediated lysophospholipid generation with subsequent re-acylation. The following abbreviations were used: Cho, choline; CK, choline kinase; CPT, CDP-choline:1,2-diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase; CT, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase; Etn, ethanolamine; EK, ethanolamine kinase; EPT, CDP-ethanolamine:1,2-diacylglycerol ethanolaminephosphotransferase; LAT, lyso-phospholipid acyltransferase; LPL, lyso-phospholipid; PEMT, phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase; PL, phospholipid; PLA, phospholipase A; PSS1, phosphatidylserine synthase 1; PSS2, phosphatidylserine synthase 2; PSD, phosphatidylserine decarboxylase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Effect of lipid loading on cellular [D9]PC level. Fibroblasts were loaded with FC (15 μg/ml) or modified lipoproteins E-LDL (40 μg/ml) and Ox-LDL (40 μg/ml) in medium containing [D9]choline, [D4]ethanolamine, and [13C3]serine (each 50 μg/ml). After 24, 48, and 72 h incubation cells were harvested and lipids were analyzed by ESI-MS/MS as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Naturally occurring PC species were discriminated from labeled species using a precursor ion scan of m/z 184 and m/z 193, respectively. Values are mean ± S.D. of one representative experiment from four, each performed in triplicate. (The effects were consistent between different experiments; however CV up to 50% were observed for [D9]PC from four experiments).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To analyze, whether the lipid species profile is also influenced, as suggested by Blom et al. (17Blom T.S. Koivusalo M. Kuismanen E. Kostiainen R. Somerharju P. Ikonen E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14635-14644Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) both detailed species patterns of undeuterated and deuterated [D9]PC species, were investigated in loaded fibroblasts. FC loading did only induce marginal changes in the species profile of undeuterated PC compared with control (Fig. 4A), but [D9]PC species profile shifted to longer and more unsaturated species, mainly at the expense of PC 32:1 (increase of PC 36:4, PC 36:3, PC 36:2, PC 36:1, PC 38:5, PC 38:4; Fig. 4B). Calculation of total species shift from control to FC-loaded fibroblasts revealed a significantly increased proportion of 13.5% for [D9]PC compared with 5.0% for undeuterated PC. However, it has to be taken into account that only 10% of total PC was labeled at 24 h (Table 2). Consequently, related to the total PC, it appeared that the de novo synthesized PC contributed the minor proportion with 1.3% compared with 4.5% for unlabeled PC of total species shift.FIGURE 4PC species composition in unloaded fibroblasts and upon lipid loading. Cells were loaded, harvested, and analyzed as described in Fig. 3. Displayed are mol percentages either of total undeuterated PC (A) or total [D9]PC (B) after 24 h of treatment.

Values are mean ± S.D. of one representative experiment from four, each performed in triplicate.

Thus, a substantial shift toward polyunsaturated species in both undeuterated and deuterated PC species profile was induced by E-LDL treatment compared with control (increase of PC 34:2, 36:4, 36:3, 38:5, 38:4; Fig. 4, A and B). For undeuterated PC species it has to be taken into account, that PC is a substantial component of E-LDL (Fig. 1), which may be responsible for the species shift. The main PC species observed in E-LDL are PC 34:2 (25%), 34:1 (15%), 36:2 (12%), 36:4 (9%), and 36:3 (6%) fitting to the observed changes in the species profile of undeuterated PC. Beside an unaltered synthesis rate of [D9]PC, incubation with Ox-LDL did not result in a major shift of both undeuterated and [D9]PC species profile compared with unloaded control (Fig. 4, A and B).Effects of Lipid Loading on [D4]PE—Compared with total cellular concentrations, [D4]PE synthesis was about 5-fold higher than [D9]PC synthesis at 24 h in unloaded controls (Table 2). In contrast to CDP-ethanolamine-derived PE, no decarboxylation of [13C3]PS to [D3]PE was observed (data not shown). Whereas incubation of fibroblasts with modified lipoproteins showed no significant changes of [D4]PE levels, FC loading decreased [D4]PE levels to 40-50% compared with the unloaded control (Fig. 5).FIGURE 5Effect of lipid loading on cellular [D4]PE level. Cells were loaded, harvested, and analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 3. Naturally occurring PE species were discriminated from labeled species using a neutral loss scan of m/z 141 and m/z 145, respectively. Values are mean ± S.D. of one representative experiment from four, each performed in triplicate. The variations observed between different experiments were similar as described in the legend to Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The species pattern of undeuterated PE did not reveal major changes upon lipid loading (Fig. 6A). However, significant species shifts were observed upon FC and E-LDL incubation for [D4]PE (Fig. 6B). Thus, [D4]PE species pattern shifted toward long chain and polyunsaturated species at the expense of PE 34:2 and PE 34:1 upon FC incubation (increase of PE 36:1, 38:4, 38:3, 40:6, 40:5, 40:4; Fig. 6B). The overall species shift upon FC loading compared with control was much more pronounced for [D4]PE with 17% of total [D4]PE compared with 4% for undeuterated PE. Taking into account that 23% of total PE were newly synthesized (Table 2), the majority of PE species shift was derived from de novo synthesized [D4]PE (4.0% related to total PE) compared with unlabeled PE (3.0% related to total PE). E-LDL incubation induced a pronounced species shift to polyunsaturated [D4]PE 36:4, 36:3 34:2 (Fig. 6B), whereas Ox-LDL loading did not cause a significant shift of [D4]PE pattern (Fig. 6).FIGURE 6PE species composition in unloaded fibroblasts and upon lipid loading.

An extensive search and analysis for Src homology domain 3 (SH3) ligand motifs revealed a myriad of broadly distributed SH3 ligand motifs, with the highest density in the PEVK segments of human titin. Besides the canonical class I and II motifs with opposite orientations, novel overlapping motifs consisting of one or more of each canonical motif are abundant.

Titin is a family of giant structural proteins (3-4 MDa) that constitute an elastic matrix in striated muscle sarcomeres (1Wang K. Shay J.W. Cell and Muscle Motility. 6. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1985: 315-369Crossref Google Scholar), as well as smooth muscle (2Kim K. Keller T.C.S. J.

Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Titin and associated proteins in the elastic matrix may play major physiological roles, including the genesis of long range elasticity, the maintenance of sarcomere stability, the assembly of nascent sarcomeres in developing muscle cells, and the assembly of myosin in the microfilaments in non-muscle cells (4Bang M.L.

In vertebrate skeletal and cardiac muscles, each titin molecule spans half a sarcomere from the M-line to the Z-line, adheres to myosin thick filaments along most of its length, and connects the thick filaments to the Z-line via an extensible I-band segment. In the I-band region, where titin extends during passive force development, titin is comprised of serially linked motifs of the following three types: (i) the folded 100-residue modular repeats of Ig or fibronectin type 3 (Fn3) 4The abbreviations used are: Fn3, fibronectin type 3-like; SH3, Src homology domain 3; PPII, polyproline type II helices; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; HRP, horse radish peroxidase; SA, simulated annealing; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; MD, molecular dynamics; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; nSH3, nebulin SH3 domain; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; MOPS, 4-morpholinepro-panesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.4The abbreviations used are: Fn3, fibronectin type 3-like; SH3, Src homology domain 3; PPII, polyproline type II helices; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; HRP, horse radish peroxidase; SA, simulated annealing; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; MD, molecular dynamics; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; nSH3, nebulin SH3 domain; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; MOPS, 4-morpholinepro-panesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. domains, (ii) the N2-A or N2-B insert, and (iii) a unique elastic 28-residue PEVK region of which 70% is composed of proline, glutamate, valine, and lysine residues (4Bang M.L.

Rapid progress is being made in the roles of titin in several distinct signaling pathways (11Hoshijima M. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: H1313-H1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The kinase domain near the titin carboxyl terminus at the M-line region of the sarcomere is dually regulated by calcium/calmodulin and tyrosine phosphorylation. The agonist-sensitive phosphorylation of titin fore-casted its involvement in signaling mechanisms (12Somerville L.L. Wang K. Arch. Biochem.

Z-line repeat Z4 and the 700-kDa titin isoform “novex-3 titin” interact with obscurin, an ∼700-kDa protein that is involved in regulating Rho-like GTPases and A-band assembly (19Young P. Ehler E.

In the I-band region, N2B domain and PEVK segment interact with crystallin that is known to be a chaperonin in assisting protein folding (21Bullard B. Ferguson C. Minajeva A. Leake M.C. Gautel M.

The interaction of the polyproline type II helices (PPII) in the PEVK segment with Src homology domain 3 (SH3) invokes SH3 signaling pathways and possibly in the assembly and targeting and orientation of the nebulin during sarcomere assembly (22Ma K. Wang K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Our recently detailed analysis of the conformational states of a representative PEVK module (human exon 172) and a 16-PEVK module (473-residue) protein fragment of human fetal titin (TP1) has clearly demonstrated the presence of PPII, unordered coil, and β-turn structure motifs in the largely unstructured PEVK segment (23Ma K. Kan L.S. Wang K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3427-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 24Ma K. Wang K. Biochem.

The facile interconversion of these conformational states under subtle environmental conditions such as temperature, ionic strength, and solvent polarity has revealed that the titin PEVK segment is conformationally malleable, without involving proline trans/cis isomerization. The elasticity of PEVK also varies with ionic strength, where the elasticity has been measured to either decrease (26Forbes J.G. Jin A.J. Ma K. Gutierrez-Cruz G. Tsai W.L. Wang K. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2005; 26: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 27Leake M.C. Wilson D. Gautel M. Simmons R.M. Biophys.

J. 2005; 89: 329-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with increasing ionic strength. This behavior implies that ionic interactions within the PEVK segment play an important role in the ensemble average of the polypeptide configuration and therefore the relative entropic and enthalpic contributions to molecular elasticity. We have proposed that the titin PEVK segment is an open and flexible poly-ampholyte with its elasticity driven and modulated by the number and location of internal salt bridges (26Forbes J.G. Jin A.J. Ma K. Gutierrez-Cruz G. Tsai W.L. Wang K. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2005; 26: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The elasticity of adult soleus titin PEVK appears to vary along its length, with the amino-terminal region being more rigid than its carboxyl-terminal region (28Nagy A. Grama L. Huber T. Bianco P. Trombitas K. Granzier H.L. Kellermayer M.S.Z. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 329-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The elastic PEVK segment is also a major binding region for protein interactions. The segment appears to be involved in interfilament adhesion between thin filaments in both skeletal and cardiac muscles. In skeletal muscle, PEVK binds actin and nebulin, with only the PEVK/nebulin interaction being inhibited by Ca2+/S100A (25Gutierrez-Cruz G. Van Heerden A.H. Wang K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7442-7449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 29Adhikari B.B. Wang K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 497: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This S100 sensitivity of the adhesion between PEVK and thin filaments was later observed in the cardiac muscle, resulting instead from its effect on PEVK/actin interaction (30Yamasaki R. Berri M. Wu Y. Trombitas K. McNabb M. Kellermayer M.S.Z. Witt C. Labeit D. Labeit S. Greaser M. Granzier H. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2297-2313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The interaction of titin PEVK with the thin filament proteins thus may be manifested as a calcium-sensitive and reversible resistance to stretching (i.e. viscous drag) of the muscle fiber (31Linke W.A. Kulke M. Li H.B. Fujita-Becker S. Neagoe C. Manstein D.J. Gautel M. Fernandez J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 2002; 137: 194-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Proline-rich peptide sequences in intrinsically disordered proteins or protein domains are hallmarks of protein-protein recognition sites in signaling pathways, by acting as ligands that bind modular adapter domains such as SH3, WW, and EVH1 (32Zarrinpar A. Bhattacharyya R.P. Lim W.A. Sci. STKE 2003. 2003; : RE8Google Scholar). The SH3 domain, a family of small globular proteins of 60 amino acids found in more than 1500 eukaryotic proteins (33Mayer B.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), has a hydrophobic cleft formed by two orthogonal β-sheets that bind to 7-10-residue polyproline II helices with a canonical ligand motif PXXP. The peripheral sequences around the core-binding motif of SH3 determine which of the two possible orientations each ligand takes in the binding cleft. Two classes of ligands, class I, with the consensus sequence R(K)XXPXXP, and class II, with the consensus sequence XPXXPXR(K) (34Feng S. Chen J.K. Yu H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar), bind to the surface cleft of SH3 domains in opposite orientations. Recently, several SH3 domains were found to recognize non-PXXP motifs: PXXDY (by EPS) (35Mongiovi A.M. Romano P.R. Panni S. Mendoza M. Wong W.T. Musacchio A. Cesareni G. Di Fiore P.P.

Cell. 2003; 11: 471-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Moreover, a few SH3 domains are known to bind ligands outside of the conventional hydrophobic cleft (42Pires J.R. Hong X.J. Brockmann C. Volkmer-Engert R. Schneider-Mergener J. Oschkinat H. Erdmann R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 1427-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Further insights of the determinants of ligand orientation have been provided by the “tryptophan switch” concept proposed by Fernandez-Ballester et al. (43Fernandez-Ballester G. Blanes-Mira C. Serrano L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The authors classified the SH3-ligand complexes according to two distinct angles between the conserved Trp indole ring and Pro residues at the YPW triad in the binding site of the SH3, each correlating with one of the two ligand orientations (43Fernandez-Ballester G. Blanes-Mira C. Serrano L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The richness of natural proline sequences in the titin family qualifies titin as one of the largest intrinsically disordered proteins in nature and provides a unique opportunity to understand the biological function and structural basis of protein recognition based on natural selection. This search complements the powerful screening approaches based on combinatorial phage or bacterial display libraries. Our recent demonstration of nebulin SH3 domain interaction with the central PPII helix of a representative PEVK repeating module (22Ma K. Wang K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) raised the intriguing possibility that titin PEVK may contain multiple SH3-binding sites and even as tandem repeats in some titin isoforms. In this study, we address this question by carrying out an extensive search and analysis for SH3-binding motifs in the protein sequences of titin and titin-like proteins, including human titin, invertebrate connectin (titin), Drosophila titin PEVK and Caenorhabditis elegans titin PEVT/K segments. Besides classical class I and II motifs, novel motifs consisting of overlapping motifs with opposite orientation are abundant. Experimentally, we evaluated the binding affinity of these motifs toward nebulin SH3 domain and other SH3-containing proteins in muscle and non-muscle cells with the peptide array technology. The feasibility of binding the bipolar motifs to SH3 in opposite orientations was also demonstrated by molecular modeling. These findings have important implications for the signaling roles, mechanical sensing of and inter-receptor interactions of intrinsically disordered proline-rich domains in signaling proteins. SH3-binding Motifs in PEVK Exons of Titin and Titin-like Protein Genes—The search for SH3-binding motifs was performed on the following sequences (from NCBI or GenBank™): complete DNA sequence for titin PEVK exons (AJ277892); human cardiac N2B titin PEVK (CAA62188, residues 4429-4614); human cardiac N2BA titin PEVK (AF525413, residues 232-2887) and human soleus PEVK (CAD12456, residues 1-2154); D-titin PEVK1 (CAB93524, residues 5389-6535); D-titin PEVK2 (CAB93524, residues 9233-14474); I-connectin PEVK1 (AB055861, residues 4822-8186); I-connectin PEVK2 (AB055861, residues 13,675-14,985); and C. elegans titin PEVK (AY130758, residues 4600-6857) and human cardiac N2B titin A-band (CAA62188, residues 7386-26342). Preparation of nSH3, Muscle, and HeLa Extracts—The soluble nSH3 (AAB02622) was expressed using Bl21(DE3)pLysS host cells transfected with a pET3d plasmid (Novagen, Madison, WI) in LB medium and purified as described previously (44Wang K. Knipfer M. Huang Q.Q. van Heerden A. Hsu L.C. Gutierrez G. Quian X.L. Stedman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4304-4314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). For muscle extracts, an 8-pound New Zealand White rabbit was injected intramuscularly in the haunch with 3 ml of anesthetic (Ketaset/Xyla-Jet 9:1). After confirming euthanasia, the rabbit was exsanguinated followed by dissection. Each of the four striated muscles were dissected: longissimus dorsi (6 g), psoas (5.7 g), soleus (2.3 g), and heart (5.6 g). Each of the four rabbit muscles was individually homogenized three times, 15 s each, with a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments) in 5-8 ml/g of muscle (v/w) in pyrophosphate relaxing buffer (0.1 m KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.01 m Tris, pH 6.7, 2 mm Na4P2O7, pH 7.2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethyl-sulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 0.5% Triton X-100, v/v). Small aliquots of the homogenized material (whole muscle) were saved for further Western blotting analysis. The rest of the homogenates were centrifuged at 1500 × g for 15 min (Beckman, JA 25.50 rotor). The supernatants (S1) were then further centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min using the same rotor and finally a high speed centrifugation at 65,000 × g for 15 min (Beckman TLA 100.4) to prepare soluble muscle extracts free of any traces of insoluble components. The pellets (P1) were resuspended by vortexing into 35 ml of low salt buffer (0.1 m KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.01 m Tris, pH 6.7, 0.1% Triton X-100, v/v), followed by pelleting at 1500 × g for 15 min and washing nine times. These highly washed myofibrils were for Western blotting analysis. HeLa cell nuclear extract and HeLa cell cytoplasmic extract were generous gifts from Drs. Louis Schiltz and Vittorio Sartorelli of Laboratory of Muscle Biology, NIAMS, National Institutes of Health, which were prepared as described previously (45Nakatani Y. Ogryzko V. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 370: 430-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Western Blotting Analysis—The monoclonal anti-amphiphysin, anti-BMX, anti-BRAMP2, anti-Btk, anti-CASK, anti-CDC42GAP, anti-cortactin, anti-Crk, anti-Dlg, anti-Eps8, anti-Fyn, anti-GRB2, anti-GRB14, anti-HS1, anti-Lck, anti-Lyn, anti-Nck, anti-Ntk, anti-p130cas, anti-PI3-K, anti-PSD-95, anti-Ras-GAP, and anti-Csk were obtained from BD Biosciences. Polyclonal anti-Abl SH3 domain and anti-JIP½ (SH3) were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., and Zymed Laboratories Inc., respectively. Monoclonal anti-α-I spectrin and anti-α-II spectrin were purchased from Signet Laboratories, Inc. Polyclonal rabbit anti-nebulin SH3 was prepared against the human nebulin (P20929) carboxyl-terminal peptide 6652VQRTGRTGMLPANYVE6667C in our laboratory and was affinity-purified by binding to peptide sulfolink-coupled agarose gel (Pierce), followed by elution using 100 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.8, and 8 m urea in PBS. Protein loading per lane was adjusted according to the intensity of myosin for whole muscles and myofibrils with roughly 30 μg of total proteins per lane. Whole muscle tissues, myofibrils, and muscle extracts were resolved on either 2-well NuPAGE BisTris 4-12% gel (MOPS running buffer) or 2-well NuPAGE Tris acetate 4-12% (TA running buffer) in order to resolve giant muscle proteins. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membrane by 51 mA for 3 h in NuPAGE transfer buffer (Invitrogen), 10% methanol. Membrane was blocked using 1% alkali-soluble casein in PBS (Novagen), washed by TBS-T (10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, v/v) for 10 min, and cut into 28 3-mm wide slices. Each slice was incubated with appropriate dilution of first antibodies as recommended by the manufacturers (supplemental Table ST1) and detected by either anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or anti-rabbit HRP (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), followed by chemiluminescence as described in the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Several different exposures on film for each blot were made routinely to detect weaker bands. The apparent molecular weight for each positive band was determined by the standard curve derived from See Blue Plus2 Pre-stained Standard (Invitrogen) in either MOPS buffer or TA buffer. Peptides and Ligand Arrays of SH3-binding Motifs—A 28-residue titin PEVK (GenBank™ accession number AF321609) module, PEPPKEVVPEKKAPVAPPKKPEVPPVKV, was synthesized and purified as described elsewhere (23Ma K. Kan L.S. Wang K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3427-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The purity of the peptides (>98%) was confirmed by analytical high pressure liquid chromatography and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. Peptide arrays containing peptide covalently attached to Whatman 50 cellulose membrane supports were prepared by Sigma Genosys using the in situ synthesis technique of SPOTs synthesis technology (46Kramer A. Schneider-Mergener J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 87: 25-39PubMed Google Scholar). Each peptide spot contains ∼5-10 nmol of 12-mer peptide with the carboxyl terminus attached to a diglycyl peptide spacer via an ester bond to the hydroxyls of cellulose. As controls, each membrane contains the same set of positive control peptides that are known to bind SH3 domains (Fig. 3B). A total of 229 (10-13)-mer peptides of class I, class II, and non-PXXP SH3-binding motifs were synthesized based on the entire human exons, as well as the open reading frames of D-titin, I-connectin, and Ce titin (supplemental Table ST1). nSH3 Binding to Ligand Arrays—The dry SPOTs membranes were first rinsed with methanol for 2 min and three times for 10 min in TBS-T (10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, v/v) and then blocked overnight in the blocking buffer (1% alkali-soluble casein, Novagen) and then shaken at room temperature. The blocked membranes were then incubated with nSH3 (2-5 μm) in blocking solution for 4 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking. Unbound nSH3 was removed by washing with TBS-T (three times for 10 min), plus a final wash with H2O (5 min) at 4 °C, and the bound nSH3 was electrotransferred in a semi-dry blotter (Bio-Rad) at a constant power of 0.8 mA/cm2 for 20 min between 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, soaked blotting papers onto activated PVDF membrane (pretreated with 1% glutaraldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Ft. Washington, PA) for 30 min, followed by extensive washing with H2O (five times for 6 min)). Electrotransfer was conducted in buffer at pH 7 to allow the dissociated nSH3 (pI 4.3) to migrate toward the anode and be captured by the activated PVDF membrane. (The nonactivated PVDF membrane failed to capture the SH3 molecules.) After electrotransfer, the membrane was quenched in 0.1 m glycine, pH 7.0, for 30 min, followed by washing with H2O (5 min). The bound nSH3 was detected using anti-nSH3 rabbit IgG primary antibody (0.11 μg/ml) followed by a secondary goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated antibody and chemiluminescence measurement (ECL kit, Amersham Biosciences). The intensity of each positive spot was quantified by integrating the entire spot using ImageJ. Immediately after use, SPOTs membrane was regenerated according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). Briefly, the membrane was first washed three times with 20 ml of water for 10 min each time at room temperature, followed by three times incubation with 20 ml of buffer A (8 m urea, 1% SDS, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol), 30 min each time at 40 °C, and three times washing with 20 ml of buffer B (50% ethanol, 10% acetic acid) for 30 min each time at 20 °C. Finally, the membrane was washed with methanol (20 ml, 10 min, two times) and TBS-T (20 ml, 10 min, three times). The regenerated membrane was routinely tested for complete removal of bound SH3 by anti-SH3 Western blotting before reuse. Binding of SH3-containing Proteins of Muscle and Non-muscle Cells to Ligand Arrays—Muscle longissimus dorsi, soleus, heart, and psoas cell extracts, non-muscle HeLa cell nuclear extract, and HeLa cell cytoplasmic extracts were prepared according to the procedures described above. Cell extract mixture was generated by mixing 1.5 ml of soleus extract, 4 ml of psoas extract, 5 ml of longissimus dorsi extract, 2 ml of heart extract, 1 ml of HeLa nuclear extract, and 20 ml of HeLa cytoplasmic extract together with protease inhibitor mixtures (Sigma). The mixture was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant (28 ml) was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter and concentrated to 8 ml by spinning in Millipore Ultrafree-15 centrifuge filter unit (2000 × g, 4 °C, 10-kDa cutoff). After dialysis against 10 mm potassium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, the extract solution was centrifuged at 78,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was mixed with 5% casein in 1× PBS to produce 1% casein as the final blocking solution in the cell extract mixture. The SPOTs membranes were first blocked with 1% casein overnight and then incubated with the cell extract mixture for 4 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking. Unbound proteins was removed by washing with TBS-T (10 times for 10 min), whereas bound SH3-containing proteins were detected directly on the SPOTs membrane using anti-SH3 antibody pool (anti-Abl SH3, anti-JIP SH3, anti-nebulin SH3, and anti-α-II spectrin), fol"

https://openalex.org/W1968442655,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) plays a central role in whole body metabolism by regulating adipocyte differentiation and energy storage. Recently, however, PPAR-γ has also been demonstrated to affect proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of different cell types. As we have previously shown that BAY 11-7085-induced synovial fibroblast apoptosis is prevented by PPAR-γ agonist 15d-PGJ2; the expression of PPAR-γ in these cells was studied. Both PPAR-γ1 and PPAR-γ2 isoforms were cloned from synovial fibroblast RNA, but only PPAR-γ1 was detected by Western blot, showing constitutive nuclear expression. Within minutes of BAY 11-7085 treatment, a PPAR-γ1-specific band was shifted into a form of higher mobility, suggesting dephosphorylation, as confirmed by phosphatase treatment of cell extracts. Of interest, BAY 11-7085-induced PPAR-γ1 dephosphorylation was followed by PARP and caspase-8 cleavage as well as by PPAR-γ1 protein degradation. PPAR-γ1 dephosphorylation was followed by the loss of PPAR-DNA binding activity ubiquitously present in synovial fibroblast nuclear extracts. Unlike the phosphorylated form, dephosphorylated PPAR-γ1 was found in insoluble membrane cell fraction and was not ubiquitinated before degradation. PPAR-γ1 dephosphorylation coincided with ERK1/2 phosphorylation that accompanies BAY 11-7085-induced synovial fibroblasts apoptosis. 15d-PGJ2, PGD2, and partially UO126, down-regulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, protected cells from BAY 11-7085-induced apoptosis, and reversed both PPAR-γ dephosphorylation and degradation. Furthermore, PPAR-γ antagonist BADGE induced PPAR-γ1 degradation, ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and synovial fibroblasts apoptosis. The results presented suggest an anti-apoptotic role for PPAR-γ1 in synovial fibroblasts. Since apoptotic marker PARP is cleaved after PPAR-γ1 dephosphorylation but before PPAR-γ1 degradation, dephosphorylation event might be enough to mediate BAY 11-7085-induced apoptosis in synovial fibroblasts."

To study the assembly and function of mammalian ORC proteins in their native environment, HeLa cells were constructed that constitutively expressed an epitope-tagged, recombinant human Orc2 subunit that had been genetically altered. Analysis of these cell lines revealed that Orc2 contains a single ORC assembly domain that is required in vivo for interaction with all other ORC subunits, as well as two nuclear localization signals (NLSs) that are required for ORC accumulation in the nucleus. The recombinant Orc2 existed in the nucleus either as an ORC-(2-5) or ORC-(1-5) complex; no other combinations of ORC subunits were detected. Moreover, only ORC-(1-5) was bound to the chromatin fraction, suggesting that Orc1 is required in vivo to load ORC-(2-5) onto chromatin. Surprisingly, recombinant Orc2 suppressed expression of endogenous Orc2, revealing that mammalian cells limit the intracellular level of Orc2, and thereby limit the amount of ORC-(2-5) in the nucleus. Because this suppression required only the ORC assembly and NLS domains, these domains appear to constitute the functional domain of Orc2.

In eukaryotic cells, initiation sites for DNA replication are determined by the binding of a six subunit origin recognition complex (ORC) 3The abbreviations used are: ORC, origin recognition complex; NLS, nuclear localization signal; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HA, hemagglutinin; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; wt, wild type. to DNA. During the M to G1 phase transition in the cell division cycle, prereplication complexes are assembled at these ORC-DNA sites where they are subsequently activated during the G1 to S phase transition to unwind the DNA and initiate the assembly of replication forks (1Mendez J. Stillman B. Bioessays. 2003; 25: 1158-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Although this process is highly conserved, significant differences do exist. For example, in both budding and fission yeast, ORC consists of a stable complex of six different subunits that remain bound to chromatin throughout the cell division cycle (Ref. 2Kong D. DePamphilis M.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 8095-8103Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar and references therein). In mammalian cells, the amount of chromatinbound ORC subunits 2-6 also remains essentially constant throughout the cell division cycle, although the interaction between between Orc1 and the remaining ORC subunits can vary significantly during the cell division cycle (reviewed in Ref. 3DePamphilis M.L. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Orc1 has been observed to undergo cell cycle-dependent changes in its association with chromatin, ubiquitination, degradation, and phosphorylation; changes that could account for the demonstrable absence of ORC activity in mammalian cells undergoing mitosis (reviewed in Ref. 3DePamphilis M.L. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The emerging picture is one in which a stable ORC-(2-5) core complex remains bound to chromatin throughout cell division, while changes in the status of Orc1 determines when this complex is active. This hypothesis is consistent with the properties of ORC proteins in vitro. Purification of human ORC and transient co-expression of its subunits in insect cells has revealed at least three intermediates in ORC assembly and function. The first is a stable core complex consisting of subunits 2, 3, 4, and 5 (ORC-(2-5)) that interacts weakly with Orc1 and Orc6 (Refs. 4Dhar S.K. Delmolino L. Dutta A. J. Biol.

Putter V. Szalay A.A. Grummt F. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 111-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The second is a less stable complex consisting of ORC-(1-5) that is essential for assembly of prereplication complexes and for initiation of DNA replication in vitro (5Giordano-Coltart J. Ying C.Y. Gautier J. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 9Chesnokov I. Remus D. Botchan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 41535-41540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The third complex, ORC-(1-6), is presumptive, because Orc6 neither co-purifies with the other ORC subunits (4Dhar S.K. Delmolino L. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29067-29071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 5Giordano-Coltart J. Ying C.Y. Gautier J. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 11Vashee S. Cvetic C. Lu W. Simancek P. Kelly T.J. Walter J.C. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1894-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In fact, there is little evolutionary relationship between fungal Orc6 and human Orc6 proteins (12Iyer L.M. Aravind L. DePamphilis M.L. DNA Replication and Human Disease. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2006: 751-760Google Scholar), making Orc6 the least conserved of the ORC subunits. Because the conditions under which these studies were carried out may not have accurately reflected those in mammalian cells, we endeavored to investigate ORC assembly and function under native conditions by constructing human cell lines that constitutively expressed a specific HsORC subunit to which two unique epitopes were added to one terminus. These epitope tags not only allowed the recombinant protein to be distinguished from the endogenous protein, but they also allowed the recombinant protein to be rapidly purified under non-denaturing conditions in order to identify proteins that associate with it in vivo (13Vassilev A. Kaneko K.J. Shu H. Zhao Y. DePamphilis M.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1229-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Thus, multiprotein complexes could be detected that were assembled from proteins synthesized and modified under native conditions. In addition, mutations could be generated in the recombinant protein and the effects of these mutations examined in vivo. This strategy was applied first to the Orc2 subunit for four reasons. Orc2 is unique among the ORC subunits in that it is the only one that does not induce TP53-dependent apoptosis, suggesting that Orc2 may suppress the lethal effects of other ORC subunits during mammalian development (14Saha T. Ghosh S. Vassilev A. Depamphilis M.L. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1371-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Orc2 plays a central role in the assembly of ORC-(2-5) core complexes in vitro (4Dhar S.K. Delmolino L. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29067-29071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 6Vashee S. Simancek P. Challberg M.D. Kelly T.J. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4294-4303Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and remains with the chromatin fraction throughout cell division. Finally, Orc2 has been implicated in the regulation of chromosome structure and centrosome copy number as well as in DNA replication (18Prasanth S.G. Prasanth K.V. Siddiqui K. Spector D.L. Stillman B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2651-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Results presented here confirm previous studies the on mammalian ORC and extend them by demonstrating that the intracellular level of Orc2 is regulated, and that Orc2 contains a single domain that is required in vivo for interaction with any of the other ORC subunits, as well as two NLSs that are required for accumulation of Orc2 and ORC-(2-5) in the nucleus. Moreover, although ORC-(2-5) accumulated in the nucleus, only ORC-(1-5) was bound to the chromatin fraction, suggesting that Orc1 is required for binding the ORC-(2-5) core complex to chromatin. Cell Culture—HeLa-RR cells are a suspension cell line that was previously used for preparation of accurate transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II (19Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). HeLa-CSHL cells are a monolayer cell line that was previously used to characterize Orc1 and kindly provided by Mendez et al. (20Mendez J. Zou-Yang X.H. Kim S.Y. Hidaka M. Tansey W.P. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 481-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Phoenix-A cells were obtained from the ATCC (no. 3443 with permission from Garry Nolan). All three cell lines were cultured routinely in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, non-essential amino acids (BIOSOURCE), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. HeLa-RR cells in volumes >1 liter were cultured in spinner flasks under the same conditions, except that DMEM and 10% fetal bovine serum were replaced by DMEM/RPMI and 5% calf serum. Recombinant Orc2 Mutants—A full-length human Orc2 open reading frame was isolated from HeLa cell RNA using reverse transcriptase and PCR to produce a DNA copy that was then cloned into the XhoI/NotI site in pCI (Promega). The cloned human Orc2 sequence was identical to that given under accession number BC014834 (National Center for Biotechnology Information). Orc2 deletions (Table 1 and Fig. 2A) and amino acid substitutions (Table 2) were generated by PCR amplification of the N- and C-terminal fragments flanking the deleted region using Tgo DNA polymerase (Roche). External primers contained either a XhoI restriction site for the N-terminal fragment or a NotI site for the C-terminal fragment. The internal primers contained a SpeI restriction site so that the N-terminal fragment could be cloned into the XhoI/SpeI restriction site and the C-terminal fragment into the SpeI/NotI site in pBS KSII+ (Stratagene). The two fragments were then sequenced, excised from pBS KSII+, ligated together at their SpeI ends, and cloned into the XhoI/NotI site in pCI. For M28, M29, M30, M31, and M32, SacII was used as internal cloning site.TABLE 1Deletion mutants in Orc2 and their phenotypeNameAmino acids deletedReplaced with:Subcellular localizationORC assemblyD11-123NoneN+D2124-226TSaThese amino acids resulted from the restriction site used to construct the deletion.N+D3227-363TSC−D4364-479TSN−D5480-577NoneN+D7234-363TSN + C−D8364-390TSN−D9391-408TSN−D10409-435TSN−D11436-451TSN−D12452-479TSN±D14241-363TSN−D15241-261TSN+D16262-288TSN±D17289-314TSN−D18315-338TSN + C−D19339-363TSN−D22227-261TSN + CD23227-288TSN + Ca These amino acids resulted from the restriction site used to construct the deletion.

Open table in a new tab Stable Cell Lines—The cloned mutants were excised from pCI and then ligated into pOP, a derivative of the Moloney mouse leukemia virus derived pOZ retroviral vector developed by Bruce Howard (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) upstream of the puromycin-N-acetyl-transferase gene. Both genes are translated from an internal ribosomal entry site as a bi-cistronic mRNA. The multicloning site in pOZ contains the sequence ACCATGgactacaaggacgacgatgacaag CTCGATGGAGGAtacccctacgacgtgcccgactacgccGGAGGACTCGAG-Orc2, which encodes FLAG and hemagglutinin (HA) epitopes (lower case). Translation begins at the Kozak consensus sequence (underlined) to produce M-DYKDDDDK-LDGG-YPYDVPDYA-GGLE (2927 Da). LDGG and GGLE are spacers. Translated amino acid sequences were confirmed by sequencing the Orc2 DNA insert in all recombinant DNA molecules. Stable cell lines expressing recombinant FH-Orc2 molecules were established as previously described (13Vassilev A. Kaneko K.J. Shu H. Zhao Y. DePamphilis M.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1229-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Retroviruses containing the pOP constructs were generated after Ca2+-phosphate transfection of Phoenix-A cells, and the viral supernatant was used for transduction of HeLa-RR cells. Cells expressing the recombinant Orc2 protein were selected by their resistance to 1 μg/ml puromycin, pooled, and then expanded by culturing in the presence of puromycin. Immunoblotting (Western Blotting)—Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then lysed in SDS sample loading buffer, as previously described (13Vassilev A. Kaneko K.J. Shu H. Zhao Y. DePamphilis M.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1229-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Aliquots were subjected to electrophoresis through a 4-12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen), and the fractionated proteins were then transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), according to the manufacturer's instructions. To detect FH-Orc2 proteins, the membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h and incubated with either anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) or anti-HA 12CA5 (Roche) monoclonal antibody. With total cell lysates, both antibodies were used to increase detection sensitivity. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antimouse antibody (Amersham Biosciences) was the secondary antibody and Super Signal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate kit (Pierce) for detection according to the manufacturer's instructions. Goat polyclonal anti-Orc1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Orc2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Orc3 (US Biological), and anti-Orc4 (Abcam) were used at a dilution of 1:700, followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rat antigoat antibody (1:30,000, Pierce). Affinity Purification—All steps were carried out on ice or at 4 °C. HeLa-RR cells (107) expressing wild-type FH-Orc2 were extracted for 30 min with 200 μl of buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin) containing 100 mm KCl. The lysate was then centrifuged for 20 min at 15,000 × g. The soluble fraction (B100) was recovered, and the pellet was extracted for 20 min with buffer B containing 300 mm KCl. The soluble fraction (B300) was recovered, and the protocol was repeated using buffer B containing 500 mm KCl. The B100 and B300 fractions were incubated with 1.3 μl and 0.3 μl, respectively, M2 anti-FLAG agarose beads (Sigma) for 4 h with rotation. The beads were then washed six times with 10 volumes of either B100 or B300. FLAG-tagged protein was selectively eluted by rotating the beads for 1 h with 0.2 mg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma) in the appropriate buffer. From three to seven times as many cells were lysed with cell lines expressing FH-Orc2 mutants at amounts less than FH-Orc2(wt), but the same amount of M2 was used to collect the FH-Orc2 protein. Immunofluorescence—Cells were cultured on coverslips, fixed for 10 min with ice-cold methanol (−20 °C), and then washed with PBS. The coverslips were then covered with anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:900 in PBS, incubated at room temperature for 1 h, washed three times with PBS, and then incubated at room temperature for 1 h with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted 1:400 in 1 μg of Hoechst per ml of PBS. The coverslips were then mounted on a glass slide in fluorescent mounting medium (Dako Cytomation) and viewed using an Nikon Eclipse E600 fluorescence microscope with a Nikon DXM1200F digital camera. Images were captured with ACT-1 software (Nikon) and merged using MetaVue software (Universal Imaging). Recombinant Orc2 Can Replace Endogenous Orc2 in Vivo—To identify the functional domains of Orc2 protein in its native environment, HeLa cells were constructed that constitutively expressed an N-FLAG-hemagglutinin-Orc2 fusion protein (FH-Orc2) that was distinguished from endogenous Orc2 using either anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 1A). The steadystate level of FH-Orc2 in these cells was only 3-fold greater than the steady-state level of endogenous Orc2 in the parent cell line (Fig. 1, B and D). Surprisingly, constitutive expression of FH-Orc2 suppressed expression of endogenous Orc2 (Fig. 1, B and D, compare Orc2 with pOP). This suppression was specific for FH-Orc2, because cells that constitutively expressed other HsORC subunits (Fig. 1A) did not suppress Orc2 expression (Fig. 1B). These results revealed that mammalian cells limit the level of intracellular Orc2. To determine whether or not the ability of ectopic Orc2 to suppress expression of endogenous Orc2 required a particular region of Orc2, deletions D1-D5 were constructed in Orc2 that spanned the entire molecule. These deletions systematically eliminated each of the three NLSs predicted from sequence analysis of Orc2, the two cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) phosphorylation consensus sequences, and the six consensus sequences for binding cyclin proteins (Fig. 2). Like FH-Orc2(wt), each deletion mutant carried the FLAG-HA epitopes at its N terminus. Immunoblotting with anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies revealed that deletion mutants D1, D2, and D5 were expressed at levels equivalent to FH-Orc2(wt) (Fig. 1C). Immunoblotting with anti-Orc2 antibody revealed that wt, D1, D2, and D5 each suppressed the expression of endogenous Orc2 (Fig. 1D). D5 was not detected by the anti-Orc2 antibody, because it recognizes an epitope in the C terminus of Orc2 that is absent in D5. In contrast, D3 and D4 were expressed to much lower levels than wt, D1, D2, and D5 (Fig. 1C), and the level of endogenous Orc2 in these cell lines was affected only slightly by the presence of the ectopic protein (Fig. 1D). These data suggest that the sequences deleted in mutants D1, D2, and D5 were not required for Orc2 function, whereas the sequences deleted in mutants D3 and D4 (the region from amino acids 227 to 479) were required. Nevertheless, changes were not detected either in the rate of cell proliferation or in the distribution of cells between the G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell division cycle (fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis) among wt and mutant Orc2 proteins. Therefore, the ability of recombinant Orc2 to replace endogenous Orc2 required the region defined by deletions D3 and D4. Because the results described below showed that this region was required both for ORC assembly and for nuclear localization, it was termed the “Orc2 functional domain” (Fig. 2A). Selecting cells for their ability to constitutively express a recombinant Orc2 apparently selected for cells in which functional endogenous Orc2 was replaced by functional recombinant Orc2, thus maintaining the intracellular level of Orc2 relatively constant. ORC-(2-5) Does Not Bind Stably to Chromatin in Vivo—As a prelude to identifying Orc2 regions required for Orc2 function in HeLa cells, optimal conditions were determined for recovering FH-Orc2 and its associated proteins. Cells expressing FH-Orc2 were lysed in buffer B containing 100 mm KCl (see “Affinity Purification”). The soluble fraction (B100) was recovered by centrifugation, and the pellet was resuspended in buffer B containing 300 mm KCl. The soluble proteins were recovered as the B300 fraction, and the process was repeated to obtain a B500 fraction. About 85% of the FH-Orc2(wt) was recovered in the B100 fraction, and the remainder in the B300 fraction (Fig. 3). Orc2 deletion mutants D1, D2, and D5 gave results similar to those of wtOrc2. However, mutants D3 and D4 were expressed at levels too low to allow reproducible detection of protein in the B300 fraction. The results described above suggested that most of the ectopically produced FH-Orc2 was bound to the chromatin fraction weakly, if at all. To determine whether or not this was an artifact of ectopic expression of an epitope-tagged protein, cells that constitutively expressed FH-Orc2(wt), and their parental cell line, HeLa-RR, were extracted in parallel with buffer B containing either 0, 10, or 100 mm KCl. Remarkably, ∼80% of the FH-Orc2 protein (Fig. 4A) and ∼50% of the endogenous Orc2 (Fig. 4B) was soluble in buffer B alone, revealing that these proteins had little, if any, affinity for chromatin. Moreover, whereas endogenous Orc1 was bound to the chromatin fraction from HeLa-RR cells, about half of the endogenous ORC-(2-5) core complex in these cells was not. To determine whether or not the experimental protocol used in this study was responsible for the large fraction of soluble ORC-(2-5) detected in HeLa-RR cells, a second HeLa cell line was examined. Mendez et al. (20Mendez J. Zou-Yang X.H. Kim S.Y. Hidaka M. Tansey W.P. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 481-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 21Mendez J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 8602-8612Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar) have reported that all of the ORC subunits in their HeLa cells (designated HeLa-CSHL) were bound to the chromatin fraction. Therefore, HeLa-CSHL cells, which are anchorage-dependent, were examined in parallel with HeLa-RR cells, which proliferate in suspension culture. As previously reported (20Mendez J. Zou-Yang X.H. Kim S.Y. Hidaka M. Tansey W.P. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 481-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 21Mendez J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 8602-8612Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar), Orc1, Orc2, Orc3, and Orc4 each required at least 300 mm salt to extract them from asynchronously proliferating HeLa-CSHL cells (Fig. 4C). Thus, the apparent differences in the affinity of ORC subunits for the chromatin fraction resulted not from differences in experimental protocols, but from differences inherent among HeLa cell lines. Furthermore, the surprising observation that the fraction of ORC-(2-5) tightly bound to the chromatin fraction varied among HeLa cell lines could not be attributed to differences in the concentrations of ORC subunits, because the relative amounts of ORC subunits 1-4 in HeLa-CSHL and HeLa-RR cells were essentially the same (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that retention of ORC-(2-5) with the chromatin fraction may require more than Orc1, and that the retention of Orc1 with the chromatin fraction may not require ORC-(2-5). Recombinant Orc2 Is Assembled into ORCs in Vivo—To determine whether or not constitutively expressed FH-Orc2 associates with other ORC subunits in vivo, cells were lysed in B100, and the pellet was extracted in B300, as described above. The soluble proteins in each fraction were then bound to anti-FLAG antibody coupled to agarose beads, washed with the corresponding buffer (B100 or B300), and then eluted with FLAG peptide to selectively release FH-Orc2. This affinity-purified FH-Orc2 was then fractionated by SDS-PAGE. Based on their apparent molecular masses in silver stained SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 5) and their reactivity with appropriate antibodies (Fig. 6), FH-Orc2 in the B100 fraction was associated with Orc3, Orc4, and Orc5. Orc6 was not detected either in the B100 or the B300 fraction, consistent with previous reports that Orc6 is not associated either with purified HsORC or with HsORC subunits transiently expressed in insect cells (4Dhar S.K.

https://openalex.org/W2008130929,"Reactivity of factor IXa with basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor is enhanced by low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin). Previous studies by us have suggested that this effect involves allosteric modulation of factor IXa. We examined the reactivity of factor IXa with several isolated Kunitz-type inhibitor domains: basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, the Kunitz inhibitor domain of protease Nexin-2, and the first two inhibitor domains of tissue factor pathway inhibitor. We find that enhancement of factor IXa reactivity by enoxaparin is greatest for basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (>10-fold), followed by the second tissue factor pathway inhibitor domain (1.7-fold) and the Kunitz inhibitor domain of protease Nexin-2 (1.4-fold). Modeling studies of factor IXa with basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor suggest that binding of this inhibitor is sterically hindered by the 99-loop of factor IXa, specifically residue Lys98. Slow-binding kinetic studies support the formation of a weak initial enzyme-inhibitor complex between factor IXa and basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor that is facilitated by enoxaparin binding. Mutation of Lys98 to Ala in factor IXa results in enhanced reactivity with all inhibitors examined, whereas almost completely abrogating the enhancing effects of enoxaparin. The results implicate Lys98 and the 99-loop of factor IXa in defining enzyme inhibitor specificity. More importantly, these results demonstrate the ability of factor IXa to be allosterically modulated by occupation of the heparin-binding exosite. Reactivity of factor IXa with basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor is enhanced by low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin). Previous studies by us have suggested that this effect involves allosteric modulation of factor IXa. We examined the reactivity of factor IXa with several isolated Kunitz-type inhibitor domains: basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, the Kunitz inhibitor domain of protease Nexin-2, and the first two inhibitor domains of tissue factor pathway inhibitor. We find that enhancement of factor IXa reactivity by enoxaparin is greatest for basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (>10-fold), followed by the second tissue factor pathway inhibitor domain (1.7-fold) and the Kunitz inhibitor domain of protease Nexin-2 (1.4-fold). Modeling studies of factor IXa with basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor suggest that binding of this inhibitor is sterically hindered by the 99-loop of factor IXa, specifically residue Lys98. Slow-binding kinetic studies support the formation of a weak initial enzyme-inhibitor complex between factor IXa and basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor that is facilitated by enoxaparin binding. Mutation of Lys98 to Ala in factor IXa results in enhanced reactivity with all inhibitors examined, whereas almost completely abrogating the enhancing effects of enoxaparin. The results implicate Lys98 and the 99-loop of factor IXa in defining enzyme inhibitor specificity. More importantly, these results demonstrate the ability of factor IXa to be allosterically modulated by occupation of the heparin-binding exosite.

Williams Hematology. 5th Ed. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1995: 1227-1238Google Scholar). As with other blood coagulation factors (namely factors VIIa, Xa, and thrombin) fIXa is a member of the serine protease family and shares a high degree of homology with trypsin. Despite this homology, the blood coagulation enzymes differ drastically from trypsin in that their activities are profoundly modulated by the binding of various protein and non-protein cofactors. In the case of fIXa, the ability of activated factor VIII (fVIIIa), anionic phospholipid, and ionic calcium to enhance the procoagulant activity of fIXa is well documented (3van Dieijen G. Tans G.

The molecular details of this conversion have not been defined in total and are the subject of intense investigation by numerous groups.The major inhibitor of fIXa in plasma is antithrombin, whose reactivity with fIXa essentially requires heparin (7Rosenberg J.S.

Heparin is known to bind to antithrombin and sterically alter its conformation to allow this serpin to react with its target (10Villaneuva G.B. Danishefsky I. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 2002; 277: 50756-50760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) allowing long chains of heparin to additionally catalyze the interaction of fIXa with antithrombin via the formation of bridged complexes where heparin acts as a “template.” Recently, we have shown that low molecular weight heparin binding to fIXa enhances reactivity of fIXa with the Kunitz-type inhibitor BPTI (15Neuenschwander P.F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2978-2986Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), suggesting that oligosaccharide binding can also allosterically modulate the fIXa active site region. In this study we examine in greater detail the ability of heparin to modulate fIXa reactivity toward several isolated Kunitz-type inhibitor domains. We show that the modulatory effect of heparin can be completely abrogated by mutating a single amino acid residue in the 99-loop region of the extended fIXa active site cleft outside of the heparin binding exosite.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Factor IXaβ, factor VIIa, factor XIa, and the factor X activator from Russell's Viper venom were purchased from Hematologic Technologies Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). Recombinant soluble tissue factor (the extracellular domain of tissue factor) was expressed and purified from bacteria as previously described (16Rezaie A.R. Fiore M.M. Neuenschwander P.F. Esmon C.T. Morrissey J.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Factor Xa was prepared from plasma-derived factor X as previously described (17Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8007-8013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enoxaparin (Lovenox®) was purchased from Aventis Pharmaceuticals (Bridgewater, NJ). Purified heparin-derived oligosaccharides of 6, 10, 14, and 18 saccharide units (H6, H10, H14, and H18) were prepared and characterized essentially as described (18Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D.

Bovine serum albumin (Fraction V, fatty acid free) was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA), and ethylene glycol was from Fisher Scientific. The chromogenic substrate CBS 31.39 (CH3SO2-d-LGR-pNA) was purchased from Diagnostica Stago (Parsippany, NJ). All other reagents were of the highest quality available.Construction and Expression of Recombinant Inhibitors—Appropriate expression clones encoded for: BPTI (59 amino acids) (21Anderer F.A. Z. Naturforsch. B. 1965; 20: 462-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 22Anderer F.A. Hoernle S. Z. Naturforsch. B. 1965; 20: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), PN2-KPI (61 amino acids corresponding to residues 285-344 of Protease Nexin-2) (23Wagner S.L. Siegel R.S. Vedvick T.S. Raschke W.C. Van Nostrand W.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 1138-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), TFPI-K1 (58 amino acids corresponding to residues 50-107 of TFPI) (24Wun T.C. Kretzmer K.K. Girard T.J. Miletich J.P. Broze Jr., G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6001-6004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and TFPI-K2 (59 amino acids corresponding to residues 121-178 of TFPI) (24Wun T.C. Kretzmer K.K. Girard T.J. Miletich J.P. Broze Jr., G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6001-6004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each construct was directionally cloned into pET11a (Novagen) and verified by sequencing. Inhibitors were expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Transformed bacterial cells were first grown to log phase at 37 °C in TB media containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin. Protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.5 mm (0.1 mm for TFPI-K1) and the cells were allowed to continue growing for 4 h at 37°C.Inclusion bodies were isolated essentially as described (25Steinle A. Li P. Morris D.L. Groh V. Lanier L.L. Strong R.K. Spies T. Immunogenetics. 2001; 53: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) and solubilized with 6 m guanidine HCl containing 20 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA to obtain a total protein concentration of roughly 20 mg/ml. The solution was then clarified by centrifugation (16,000 × g for 30 min) and oxidative refolding (26De Bernardez Clark E. Hevehan D. Szela S. Maachupalli-Reddy J. Biotechnol. Prog. 1998; 14: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) of each protein preparation was performed by rapid dilution into 20 volumes of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 m guanidine HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm oxidized glutathione (Sigma), and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The diluted protein solution was incubated at room temperature for 6 h with slow stirring for completion of protein refolding followed by exhaustive dialysis into an appropriate buffer for ionexchange chromatography.Construction and Expression of Wild-type and Mutant fIX—The coding sequence for wild-type fIX in pBR322 (27Kurachi K. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6461-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) was a generous gift of Dr. Earl Davie (University of Washington). The fIX coding sequence was removed into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and sequenced to verify the correct orientation. This construct (pFN04) was used for expression of wild-type fIX as well as PCR-based mutagenesis (28Horton R.M. Cai Z. Ho S.N. Please L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar) to generate fIXK98A essentially as previously described for constructing fVII mutants (29Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8701-8707Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Expression constructs were transfected into human 293 cells using Lipofectin ® (Invitrogen) and high expressing clones isolated by limiting dilution.Protein Purifications—Purification of refolded BPTI was accomplished by ion-exchange chromatography using Mono-S HR 5/5 (Amersham Biosciences) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The column was developed with a 0-1 m NaCl gradient and BPTI eluted as a single peak at roughly 0.43 m NaCl. The specific activity of recombinant BPTI preparations was equivalent to or better than that of commercial preparations of aprotinin (not shown). Purification of refolded PN2-KPI and TFPI-K2 was accomplished by ion-exchange chromatography using Mono-Q HR 5/5 (Amersham Biosciences) in 20 mm MES, pH 6.0. In both cases the column was developed with a 0-0.5 m NaCl gradient. PN2-KPI eluted at roughly 90 mm NaCl and TFPI-K2 eluted at roughly 50 mm NaCl. Purification of refolded TFPI-K1 was accomplished by affinity chromatography over a trypsin-agarose column. Trypsin-agarose was prepared by coupling 20 mg of l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Worthington Biochemicals) to 2.5 ml of Affi-Gel 10 in 100 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 10 mm CaCl2, and 100 μg/ml leupeptin overnight at 4 °C. This was followed by blocking non-reacted sites with 1 m ethanolamine-HCl, pH 8.0. Refolded TFPI-K1 was loaded onto the prepared trypsin-agarose column in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl. The column was extensively washed with the same buffer before eluting the inhibitor with 10 mm HCl, pH 2.1, 100 mm NaCl. The pH of the eluted fractions was immediately neutralized with 0.02 volumes of 2 m Tris buffer. All inhibitors were judged >95% pure by SDS-PAGE.Recombinant human wild-type fIX and fIXK98A were isolated from 293 cell supernatants using a combination of ionexchange and heparin affinity chromatography. A 10-fold concentrate of cell supernatant was diluted 2-fold with deionized water to reduce the ionic strength before loading a 150-ml DEAE FF Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated in 25 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.0, 33 mm NaCl, and 1 mm benzamidine. After loading, the column was extensively washed in the same buffer before elution of the fIX protein with a 0.033-0.4 m NaCl gradient over 10 column volumes. The fIX protein peak was identified by clotting activity, pooled, and dialyzed versus 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl before heparin affinity chromatography using either POROS ® HE2 (Applied Biosystems) or HiPrep™ Heparin FF 16/10 (Amersham Biosciences) and eluting with a NaCl gradient. Wild-type fIX and fIXK98A both eluted as single peaks at roughly 0.46 m NaCl.Wild-type and mutant fIX proteins were activated with the purified factor X activator from the venom of Russell's viper, which also cleaves fIX after Arg180 to generate active enzyme (fIXaα). The activated enzyme was purified away from the venom protease by subsequent heparin affinity chromatography essentially as described above using HiTrap™ Heparin HP (Amersham Biosciences). Although the activation peptide remains attached to the light chain of fIXaα, this enzyme retains 100% amidolytic activity compared with fIXaβ (activation peptide proteolytically removed) and is comparable with fIXaβ in kinetics of inhibition by Kunitz-type inhibitors (see “Results”). Unless indicated otherwise, the fIXaα form was used in experiments.Clotting Assays—Coagulant activities of wild-type and mutant fIXa proteins were assayed by a standard single-stage clotting assay using a Coag-a-mate XM (Organon Teknika) coagulometer, fIX-deficient plasma (George King Biomedical), and APTT Reagent (Sigma).Reactive Site Titration of Inhibitors—The active concentration of inhibitor preparations was determined by reactive site titration essentially as described (23Wagner S.L. Siegel R.S. Vedvick T.S. Raschke W.C. Van Nostrand W.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 1138-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) using 10 nm active site-titrated trypsin (30Chase Jr., T. Shaw E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 29: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar) and S-2222 substrate (Chromogenix, Milano, Italy) to measure residual trypsin activity after a 15-min incubation period. This method assumes a 1:1 stoichiometry of inhibitor and trypsin. Amino acid analysis performed on an initial PN2-KPI preparation indicated an equivalent concentration as that determined by reactive site titration (not shown).Active Site Titration of fIXa Enzymes—Active concentrations of wild-type and mutant fIXa preparations were determined by active site titration using biotin-EGR-ck (Hematologic Technologies Inc.) essentially as described (31Mann K.G. Williams E.B. Krishnaswamy S. Church W. Giles A. Tracy R.P. Blood. 1990; 76: 755-766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, wild-type or mutant fIXa (roughly 5 μm) were incubated with 150 μm biotin-EGR-ck in 50 mm Tricine, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 30% ethylene glycol for 24 h at room temperature. Biotin-EGR-fIXa was then quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a goat anti-fIX polyclonal capture antibody and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin. These were compared with a standard line made using native fIXaβ to determine active concentrations for all fIXa enzyme preparations.Equilibrium Enzyme Inhibition Assays—Reversible competitive inhibition of fIXa amidolytic activity at equilibrium was measured at 25 °C using final concentrations of 25 nm fIXa, 5 mm CaCl2 and the indicated concentrations of enoxaparin and inhibitor in the presence of 30% ethylene glycol as previously described (15Neuenschwander P.F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2978-2986Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The addition of ethylene glycol enhances the enzymatic activity of fIXa toward CBS 31.39 roughly 20-fold (32Neuenschwander P.F. McCollough J. McCallum C.D. Johnson A.E. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 428Google Scholar). Previous studies by us as well as control experiments performed with each inhibitor examined showed that the inclusion of ethylene glycol in the assay has no effect on the reactivity of fIXa with these inhibitors (15Neuenschwander P.F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2978-2986Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Values of the final equilibrium inhibition constant (Ki,eq) were estimated as described (15Neuenschwander P.F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2978-2986Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 29Neuenschwander P.F. Morrissey J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8701-8707Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) using Equation 1. This equation describes simple reversible competitive inhibition where vo is the steady state rate obtained in the absence of inhibitor, vs is the steady state rate at each concentration of inhibitor, S is the experimental substrate concentration, and Km is the Michaelis constant for substrate hydrolysis.Vs=VoKi,eq(1+S/Km)I+Ki,eq(1+S/Km)(Eq. 1) Slow-binding Enzyme Inhibition Analysis—Kinetic parameters for slow-binding inhibition were obtained using Equations 2-5 as derived by others (33Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar, 34Copeland R.A. Enzymes: A Practical Introduction to Structure, Mechanism, and Data Analysis. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1996: 225-261Google Scholar) and are described in Schemes Ia and Ib (Fig. 1). In both of these schemes the non-covalent enzyme-inhibitor complex, EI, isomerizes into EI*; either after significant formation of the EI complex (Scheme Ia) or without significant accumulation of the EI complex (Scheme Ib). In both cases, the overall inhibition constant describing generation of EI* is defined as Ki*, which is equivalent to Ki,eq obtained from equilibrium experiments (above). In cases following Scheme Ia, the parameter Ki* can be further broken down to obtain Ki, which describes the establishment of the initial “loose” EI complex, k5 and k6 (see below).Final reaction conditions were the same as described above for equilibrium studies. In these assays, however, the fIXa was preincubated with or without enoxaparin for 15 min at 25 °C in the reaction mixture before the combined addition of inhibitor and substrate at time 0. The absorbance at 405 nm was then monitored for up to 30 min in a Thermo-Max microplate reader (Molecular Devices) set at 25 °C to monitor substrate hydrolysis using KINEMAX software (written and kindly provided by Dr. Jolyon Jesty, SUSB, Stony Brook, NY). Data for each generated curve were fitted with the following integrated rate equation describing slow-binding inhibition,A=Vst+(Vo-Vs)(1-e-kobst)/kobs+Ao(Eq. 2) where A is the absorbance at 405 nm at any time, t. Fits of progress curves with Equation 2 yield values for Ao (the initial absorbance at t = 0), vo (the initial rate of substrate hydrolysis), vs (the steady-state rate of substrate hydrolysis), and kobs (the apparent first-order rate constant for inhibition).For analyses using Scheme Ia, values of k6 (the reverse rate constant for EI* isomerization) were determined from progress curves above using the following relationship.k6ork10=kobsVs/Vo(Eq. 3) Values of k5 and initial Ki (defined as k4/k3) were then obtained from secondary plots of kobs versus I using the following hyperbolic equation.kobs=k6+k5I/(I+Ki(1+S/Km))(Eq. 4) For analyses using Scheme Ib, values of k10 were obtained from progress curves also using Equation 3. However, in these cases vo does not vary with inhibitor concentration and a plot of kobs versus I yields a straight line, indicating conditions where Ki (1+ S/Km) >> I. Thus for Scheme Ib EI formation is insignificant and EI* can be considered formed directly from E + I. For these cases the following linear equation is applicable for obtaining an estimate of k9, the apparent second-order on-rate constant,kobs=k10+k9I/(1+S/Km)(Eq. 5) where the y intercept reflects k10 and the slope of the line is equal to k9/(1 + S/Km). Alternatively, k9 can be obtained from Ki*, which is equivalent to Ki,eq in Equation 1, using the relationship k9 = k10/Ki*.Although fits with Equations 4 or 5 yield estimates of k6 or k10, respectively, the values reported herein were obtained from Equation 3 using the more accurate fits of progress curves to Equation 2 and then verified in fits with Equations 4 or 5. Experimental values of S as well as experimentally determined values of Km (defined in the traditional manner as (k2 + k7)/k1 in Schemes Ia and Ib) were used as necessary in all fitting procedures. All regression procedures were performed using Slide-WritePlus 6.0 (Advanced Graphics Software), which uses the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.RESULTSPrevious studies (15Neuenschwander P.F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2978-2986Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) by us have shown that whereas fIXa is resistant to inhibition by the Kunitz-type inhibitor BPTI, this resistance is somewhat alleviated by enoxaparin, leading to a roughly 10-fold enhancement in the equilibrium inhibition constant. To gain further insight into mechanisms of fIXa selectivity and its modulation by heparin we undertook an examination of the reactivity of fIXa with several isolated Kunitz-type inhibitor domains: BPTI, PN2-KPI, TFPI-K1, and TFPI-K2. Each of these inhibitors was expressed in E. coli using standard recombinant techniques, purified to homogeneity and quantified by reactive site titration as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The isolated PN2-KPI inhibitor domain was found to react with high affinity toward factor XIa, yielding a Ki,eq of roughly 400 pm (see supplemental data). Similarly, preliminary studies indicated that preparations of isolated TFPI-K1 domain inhibited the complex of factor VIIa and soluble tissue factor with high affinity (Ki,eq = 400 nm) and weakly inhibited factor Xa (Ki,eq > 1.5 μm). Conversely, the isolated TFPI-K2 domain inhibited factor Xa with high affinity (Ki,eq = 24 nm) and the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex with reduced affinity (Ki,eq = 7 μm). These results are consistent with the expected reactivity of the isolated inhibitor domains (35Van Nostrand W.E. Wagner S.L. Farrow J.S. Cunningham D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9591-9594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Petersen L.C. Bjorn S.E. Olsen O.H. Nordfang O. Norris F. Norris K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 310-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and demonstrate the correct folding and inhibitor activity of the inhibitors examined.The abilities of these isolated Kunitz inhibitor domains to inhibit fIXaβ are compared in Fig. 2. As expected, fIXa exhibited remarkable specificity toward these inhibitors despite their high homology. Of the inhibitors examined, PN2-KPI showed the highest level of reactivity (Ki,eq = 10 μm), followed by TFPI-K2 (Ki,eq = 336 μm), BPTI (Ki,eq > 500 μm), and TFPI-K1 (Ki,eq > 1mm). Consistent with our previous observations, enoxaparin was able to enhance the reactivity of fIXa with BPTI more than 10-fold (Ki,eq = 46 μm). Surprisingly, however, this same level of enhancement by enoxaparin was not observed with any of the other inhibitors examined; TFPI-K2 and PN2-KPI each showed only a small, but consistent, enhancement in reactivity with enoxaparin (1.7- and 1.4-fold, respectively; Ki,eq values of 203 and 7 μm) and TFPI-K1 showed no measurable enhancement in reactivity with enoxaparin.FIGURE 2Inhibition of fIXaβ by isolated Kunitz-type inhibitor domains. FIXaβ (25 nm) was titrated with the indicated concentrations of BPTI (○), TFPI-K1 (•), TFPI-K2 (□), and PN2-KPI (▪). The remaining fIXa amidolytic activity at equilibrium was then measured and values were normalized to the activity of fIXa in the absence of inhibitor (100%). Data were fitted with Equation 1 (lines) to obtain values of Ki,eq (see text).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The highly basic nature of BPTI compared with the other isolated Kunitz domains along with its ability to bind to heparin (albeit weakly; Kd = 172 μm (15Neuenschwander P.F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2978-2986Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar)) raised the potential that enoxaparin, although short (15 saccharide units; H15), may retain some capacity to facilitate the interaction of BPTI with fIXa via a bridging-type mechanism. Although unlikely based on previous equilibrium kinetic studies and the level of enoxaparin used in these experiments (10 μm; or 0.06 × Kd for BPTI binding versus 78 × Kd for fIXa binding), this issue was examined by using increasing concentrations of enoxaparin as well as progressively smaller heparin oligosaccharides; H18, H14, H10, and H6 (18Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Lorand L. Mann K.G. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, New York1993: 525-559Google Scholar, 19Lindahl U. Thunberg L. Bäckström G. Riesenfeld J. Nordling K. Björk I. J.

As shown in Fig. 3, the typical bell-shaped profile for bridging-type mechanisms was not observed at enoxaparin concentrations ranging from 1 nm to >100 μm. In addition, and of greater significance, is the observation that progressively smaller oligosaccharides do not lose the ability to enhance reactivity of fIXa. These results along with previous kinetic studies support the ability of heparin to modulate fIXa reactivity via a mechanism other than bridging, and are consistent with allosteric modulation of the fIXa protease domain.FIGURE 3Support of BPTI inhibition of fIXa by short chain oligosaccharides. The ability of heparin oligosaccharides with progressively shorter chain lengths to support enhancement of fIXa reactivity with BPTI was examined using 25 nm fIXaβ, 308 μm BPTI, and the indicated concentrations of heparin-derived oligosaccharides (18Olson S.T.

Saccharide chain lengths were H18 (•), H14 (□), H10 (▪), and H6 (▿). Enoxaparin (H15) is shown for comparison (○). The fIXa activities were normalized to the activity of fIXa in the absence of added oligosaccharide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To gain further insight into the potential mechanism of heparin modulation of fIXa, we prepared a rudimentary h"
