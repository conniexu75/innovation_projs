https://openalex.org/W4223491164,"Psilocybin therapy shows antidepressant potential, but its therapeutic actions are not well understood. We assessed the subacute impact of psilocybin on brain function in two clinical trials of depression. The first was an open-label trial of orally administered psilocybin (10 mg and 25 mg, 7 d apart) in patients with treatment-resistant depression. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was recorded at baseline and 1 d after the 25-mg dose. Beck's depression inventory was the primary outcome measure ( MR/J00460X/1 ). The second trial was a double-blind phase II randomized controlled trial comparing psilocybin therapy with escitalopram. Patients with major depressive disorder received either 2 × 25 mg oral psilocybin, 3 weeks apart, plus 6 weeks of daily placebo ('psilocybin arm') or 2 × 1 mg oral psilocybin, 3 weeks apart, plus 6 weeks of daily escitalopram (10-20 mg) ('escitalopram arm'). fMRI was recorded at baseline and 3 weeks after the second psilocybin dose ( NCT03429075 ). In both trials, the antidepressant response to psilocybin was rapid, sustained and correlated with decreases in fMRI brain network modularity, implying that psilocybin's antidepressant action may depend on a global increase in brain network integration. Network cartography analyses indicated that 5-HT2A receptor-rich higher-order functional networks became more functionally interconnected and flexible after psilocybin treatment. The antidepressant response to escitalopram was milder and no changes in brain network organization were observed. Consistent efficacy-related brain changes, correlating with robust antidepressant effects across two studies, suggest an antidepressant mechanism for psilocybin therapy: global increases in brain network integration."
https://openalex.org/W4223416923,"Typical genotyping workflows map reads to a reference genome before identifying genetic variants. Generating such alignments introduces reference biases and comes with substantial computational burden. Furthermore, short-read lengths limit the ability to characterize repetitive genomic regions, which are particularly challenging for fast k-mer-based genotypers. In the present study, we propose a new algorithm, PanGenie, that leverages a haplotype-resolved pangenome reference together with k-mer counts from short-read sequencing data to genotype a wide spectrum of genetic variation-a process we refer to as genome inference. Compared with mapping-based approaches, PanGenie is more than 4 times faster at 30-fold coverage and achieves better genotype concordances for almost all variant types and coverages tested. Improvements are especially pronounced for large insertions (≥50 bp) and variants in repetitive regions, enabling the inclusion of these classes of variants in genome-wide association studies. PanGenie efficiently leverages the increasing amount of haplotype-resolved assemblies to unravel the functional impact of previously inaccessible variants while being faster compared with alignment-based workflows."
https://openalex.org/W4223469611,"Biomolecular condensates organize biochemistry, yet little is known about how cells control the position and scale of these structures. In cells, condensates often appear as relatively small assemblies that do not coarsen into a single droplet despite their propensity to fuse. Here, we report that ribonucleoprotein condensates of the glutamine-rich protein Whi3 interact with the endoplasmic reticulum, which prompted us to examine how membrane association controls condensate size. Reconstitution revealed that membrane recruitment promotes Whi3 condensation under physiological conditions. These assemblies rapidly arrest, resembling size distributions seen in cells. The temporal ordering of molecular interactions and the slow diffusion of membrane-bound complexes can limit condensate size. Our experiments reveal a trade-off between locally enhanced protein concentration at membranes, which favours condensation, and an accompanying reduction in diffusion, which restricts coarsening. Given that many condensates bind endomembranes, we predict that the biophysical properties of lipid bilayers are key for controlling condensate sizes throughout the cell. Snead et al. report that membrane tethering facilitates assembly of ribonucleoprotein condensates while also restricting condensate size by reducing the diffusion of protein and RNA."
https://openalex.org/W4223608326,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) programs operate within carcinoma cells, where they generate phenotypes associated with malignant progression. In their various manifestations, EMT programs enable epithelial cells to enter into a series of intermediate states arrayed along the E-M phenotypic spectrum. At present, we lack a coherent understanding of how carcinoma cells control their entrance into and continued residence in these various states, and which of these states favour the process of metastasis. Here we characterize a layer of EMT-regulating machinery that governs E-M plasticity (EMP). This machinery consists of two chromatin-modifying complexes, PRC2 and KMT2D-COMPASS, which operate as critical regulators to maintain a stable epithelial state. Interestingly, loss of these two complexes unlocks two distinct EMT trajectories. Dysfunction of PRC2, but not KMT2D-COMPASS, yields a quasi-mesenchymal state that is associated with highly metastatic capabilities and poor survival of patients with breast cancer, suggesting that great caution should be applied when PRC2 inhibitors are evaluated clinically in certain patient cohorts. These observations identify epigenetic factors that regulate EMP, determine specific intermediate EMT states and, as a direct consequence, govern the metastatic ability of carcinoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W4223424509,"Factor VIII gene transfer with a single intravenous infusion of valoctocogene roxaparvovec (AAV5-hFVIII-SQ) has demonstrated clinical benefits lasting 5 years to date in people with severe hemophilia A. Molecular mechanisms underlying sustained AAV5-hFVIII-SQ-derived FVIII expression have not been studied in humans. In a substudy of the phase 1/2 clinical trial ( NCT02576795 ), liver biopsy samples were collected 2.6-4.1 years after gene transfer from five participants. Primary objectives were to examine effects on liver histopathology, determine the transduction pattern and percentage of hepatocytes transduced with AAV5-hFVIII-SQ genomes, characterize and quantify episomal forms of vector DNA and quantify transgene expression (hFVIII-SQ RNA and hFVIII-SQ protein). Histopathology revealed no dysplasia, architectural distortion, fibrosis or chronic inflammation, and no endoplasmic reticulum stress was detected in hepatocytes expressing hFVIII-SQ protein. Hepatocytes stained positive for vector genomes, showing a trend for more cells transduced with higher doses. Molecular analysis demonstrated the presence of full-length, inverted terminal repeat-fused, circular episomal genomes, which are associated with long-term expression. Interindividual differences in transgene expression were noted despite similar successful transduction, possibly influenced by host-mediated post-transduction mechanisms of vector transcription, hFVIII-SQ protein translation and secretion. Overall, these results demonstrate persistent episomal vector structures following AAV5-hFVIII-SQ administration and begin to elucidate potential mechanisms mediating interindividual variability."
https://openalex.org/W4223463067,"Although lung cancer risk among smokers is dependent on smoking dose, it remains unknown if this increased risk reflects an increased rate of somatic mutation accumulation in normal lung cells. Here, we applied single-cell whole-genome sequencing of proximal bronchial basal cells from 33 participants aged between 11 and 86 years with smoking histories varying from never-smoking to 116 pack-years. We found an increase in the frequency of single-nucleotide variants and small insertions and deletions with chronological age in never-smokers, with mutation frequencies significantly elevated among smokers. When plotted against smoking pack-years, mutations followed the linear increase in cancer risk until about 23 pack-years, after which no further increase in mutation frequency was observed, pointing toward individual selection for mutation avoidance. Known lung cancer-defined mutation signatures tracked with both age and smoking. No significant enrichment for somatic mutations in lung cancer driver genes was observed. Single-cell whole-genome sequencing of proximal bronchial basal cells shows that somatic mutations accumulate with age and at a higher level in smokers compared to never-smokers. Mutation frequencies increased with smoking dose but then plateaued, suggesting intrinsic mechanisms to limit mutation burden."
https://openalex.org/W4223516255,"Adeno-associated viral vector-mediated transfer of DNA coding for broadly neutralizing anti-HIV antibodies (bnAbs) offers an alternative to attempting to induce protection by vaccination or by repeated infusions of bnAbs. In this study, we administered a recombinant bicistronic adeno-associated virus (AAV8) vector coding for both the light and heavy chains of the potent broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibody VRC07 (AAV8-VRC07) to eight adults living with HIV. All participants remained on effective anti-retroviral therapy (viral load (VL) <50 copies per milliliter) throughout this phase 1, dose-escalation clinical trial ( NCT03374202 ). AAV8-VRC07 was given at doses of 5 × 1010, 5 × 1011 and 2.5 × 1012 vector genomes per kilogram by intramuscular (IM) injection. Primary endpoints of this study were to assess the safety and tolerability of AAV8-VRC07; to determine the pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of in vivo VRC07 production; and to describe the immune response directed against AAV8-VRC07 vector and its products. Secondary endpoints were to assess the clinical effects of AAV8-VRC07 on CD4 T cell count and VL and to assess the persistence of VRC07 produced in participants. In this cohort, IM injection of AAV8-VRC07 was safe and well tolerated. No clinically significant change in CD4 T cell count or VL occurred during the 1-3 years of follow-up reported here. In participants who received AAV8-VRC07, concentrations of VRC07 were increased 6 weeks (P = 0.008) and 52 weeks (P = 0.016) after IM injection of the product. All eight individuals produced measurable amounts of serum VRC07, with maximal VRC07 concentrations >1 µg ml-1 in three individuals. In four individuals, VRC07 serum concentrations remained stable near maximal concentration for up to 3 years of follow-up. In exploratory analyses, neutralizing activity of in vivo produced VRC07 was similar to that of in vitro produced VRC07. Three of eight participants showed a non-idiotypic anti-drug antibody (ADA) response directed against the Fab portion of VRC07. This ADA response appeared to decrease the production of serum VRC07 in two of these three participants. These data represent a proof of concept that adeno-associated viral vectors can durably produce biologically active, difficult-to-induce bnAbs in vivo, which could add valuable new tools to the fight against infectious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4223525416,"The persistence of cancer cells resistant to therapy remains a major clinical challenge. In triple-negative breast cancer, resistance to chemotherapy results in the highest recurrence risk among breast cancer subtypes. The drug-tolerant state seems largely defined by nongenetic features, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, by monitoring epigenomes, transcriptomes and lineages with single-cell resolution, we show that the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 (trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27) regulates cell fate at the onset of chemotherapy. We report that a persister expression program is primed with both H3K4me3 (trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4) and H3K27me3 in unchallenged cells, with H3K27me3 being the lock to its transcriptional activation. We further demonstrate that depleting H3K27me3 enhances the potential of cancer cells to tolerate chemotherapy. Conversely, preventing H3K27me3 demethylation simultaneously to chemotherapy inhibits the transition to a drug-tolerant state, and delays tumor recurrence in vivo. Our results highlight how chromatin landscapes shape the potential of cancer cells to respond to initial therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4226036116,"DNA methylation plays a critical role in spermatogenesis, as evidenced by the male sterility of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) mutant mice. Here, we report a division of labor in the establishment of the methylation landscape of male germ cells and its functions in spermatogenesis. Although DNMT3C is essential for preventing retrotransposons from interfering with meiosis, DNMT3A broadly methylates the genome (with the exception of DNMT3C-dependent retrotransposons) and controls spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) plasticity. By reconstructing developmental trajectories through single-cell RNA sequencing and profiling chromatin states, we found that Dnmt3A mutant SSCs can only self-renew and no longer differentiate in association with spurious enhancer activation that enforces an irreversible stem cell gene program. Our findings therefore highlight a key function of DNA methylation in male fertility: the epigenetic programming of SSC commitment to differentiation and lifelong spermatogenesis supply."
https://openalex.org/W4223591371,"Comprehensive phenotypic characterization of the many mutations found in cancer tissues is one of the biggest challenges in cancer genomics. In this study, we evaluated the functional effects of 29,060 cancer-related transition mutations that result in protein variants on the survival and proliferation of non-tumorigenic lung cells using cytosine and adenine base editors and single guide RNA (sgRNA) libraries. By monitoring base editing efficiencies and outcomes using surrogate target sequences paired with sgRNA-encoding sequences on the lentiviral delivery construct, we identified sgRNAs that induced a single primary protein variant per sgRNA, enabling linking those mutations to the cellular phenotypes caused by base editing. The functions of the vast majority of the protein variants (28,458 variants, 98%) were classified as neutral or likely neutral; only 18 (0.06%) and 157 (0.5%) variants caused outgrowing and likely outgrowing phenotypes, respectively. We expect that our approach can be extended to more variants of unknown significance and other tumor types. Cancer-associated variants of unknown significance are identified using base editing."
https://openalex.org/W4223436519,"Mammalian chromosomes are organized into megabase-sized compartments that are further subdivided into topologically associating domains (TADs). While the formation of TADs is dependent on cohesin, the mechanism behind compartmentalization remains enigmatic. Here, we show that the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family scaffold protein BRD2 promotes spatial mixing and compartmentalization of active chromatin after cohesin loss. This activity is independent of transcription but requires BRD2 to recognize acetylated targets through its double bromodomain and interact with binding partners with its low-complexity domain. Notably, genome compartmentalization mediated by BRD2 is antagonized on the one hand by cohesin and on the other hand by the BET homolog protein BRD4, both of which inhibit BRD2 binding to chromatin. Polymer simulation of our data supports a BRD2-cohesin interplay model of nuclear topology, in which genome compartmentalization results from a competition between loop extrusion and chromatin-state-specific affinity interactions."
https://openalex.org/W4223498821,"Germline–soma segregation is a fundamental event during mammalian embryonic development. Here we establish the epigenetic principles of human primordial germ cell (hPGC) development using in vivo hPGCs and stem cell models recapitulating gastrulation. We show that morphogen-induced remodelling of mesendoderm enhancers transiently confers the competence for hPGC fate, but further activation favours mesoderm and endoderm fates. Consistently, reducing the expression of the mesendodermal transcription factor OTX2 promotes the PGC fate. In hPGCs, SOX17 and TFAP2C initiate activation of enhancers to establish a core germline programme, including the transcriptional repressor PRDM1 and pluripotency factors POU5F1 and NANOG. We demonstrate that SOX17 enhancers are the critical components in the regulatory circuitry of germline competence. Furthermore, activation of upstream cis-regulatory elements by an optimized CRISPR activation system is sufficient for hPGC specification. We reveal an enhancer-linked germline transcription factor network that provides the basis for the evolutionary divergence of mammalian germlines. Tang et al. report that sequential epigenetic remodelling of mesendoderm enhancers is required for the segregation of human primordial germ cell and mesendodermal cell fates."
https://openalex.org/W4223452958,"Whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) is the treatment backbone for many patients with brain metastasis; however, its efficacy in preventing disease progression and the associated toxicity have questioned the clinical impact of this approach and emphasized the need for alternative treatments. Given the limited therapeutic options available for these patients and the poor understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the resistance of metastatic lesions to WBRT, we sought to uncover actionable targets and biomarkers that could help to refine patient selection. Through an unbiased analysis of experimental in vivo models of brain metastasis resistant to WBRT, we identified activation of the S100A9-RAGE-NF-κB-JunB pathway in brain metastases as a potential mediator of resistance in this organ. Targeting this pathway genetically or pharmacologically was sufficient to revert the WBRT resistance and increase therapeutic benefits in vivo at lower doses of radiation. In patients with primary melanoma, lung or breast adenocarcinoma developing brain metastasis, endogenous S100A9 levels in brain lesions correlated with clinical response to WBRT and underscored the potential of S100A9 levels in the blood as a noninvasive biomarker. Collectively, we provide a molecular framework to personalize WBRT and improve its efficacy through combination with a radiosensitizer that balances therapeutic benefit and toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W4223420068,"Protein degradation is critical to maintaining cellular homeostasis, and perturbation of the ubiquitin proteasome system leads to the accumulation of protein aggregates. These aggregates are either directed towards autophagy for destruction or sequestered into an inclusion, termed the aggresome, at the centrosome. Utilizing high-resolution quantitative analysis, here, we define aggresome assembly at the centrosome in human cells. Centriolar satellites are proteinaceous granules implicated in the trafficking of proteins to the centrosome. During aggresome assembly, satellites were required for the growth of the aggresomal structure from an initial ring of phosphorylated HSP27 deposited around the centrioles. The seeding of this phosphorylated HSP27 ring depended on the centrosomal proteins CP110, CEP97 and CEP290. Owing to limiting amounts of CP110, senescent cells, which are characterized by the accumulation of protein aggregates, were defective in aggresome formation. Furthermore, satellites and CP110-CEP97-CEP290 were required for the aggregation of mutant huntingtin. Together, these data reveal roles for CP110-CEP97-CEP290 and satellites in the control of cellular proteostasis and the aggregation of disease-relevant proteins."
https://openalex.org/W4223429237,"Metastatic progression is a major burden for breast cancer patients and is associated with the ability of cancer cells to overcome stressful conditions, such as nutrients deprivation and hypoxia, and to gain invasive properties. Autophagy and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition are critical contributors to these processes. Here, we show that the P2X4 purinergic receptor is upregulated in breast cancer biopsies from patients and it is primarily localised in endolysosomes. We demonstrate that P2X4 enhanced invasion in vitro, as well as mammary tumour growth and metastasis in vivo. The pro-malignant role of P2X4 was mediated by the regulation of lysosome acidity, the promotion of autophagy and cell survival. Furthermore, the autophagic activity was associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and this role of P2X4 was even more pronounced under metabolic challenges. Pharmacological and gene silencing of P2X4 inhibited both autophagy and EMT, whereas its rescue in knocked-down cells led to the restoration of the aggressive phenotype. Together, our results demonstrate a previously unappreciated role for P2X4 in regulating lysosomal functions and fate, promoting breast cancer progression and aggressiveness."
https://openalex.org/W4223459555,"Akkermansia muciniphila, a mucin-degrading microbe found in the human gut, is often associated with positive health outcomes. The abundance of A. muciniphila is modulated by the presence and accessibility of nutrients, which can be derived from diet or host glycoproteins. In particular, the ability to degrade host mucins, a class of proteins carrying densely O-glycosylated domains, provides a competitive advantage in the sustained colonization of niche mucosal environments. Although A. muciniphila is known to rely on mucins as a carbon and nitrogen source, the enzymatic machinery used by this microbe to process mucins in the gut is not yet fully characterized. Here, we focus on the mucin-selective metalloprotease, Amuc_0627 (AM0627), which is known to cleave between adjacent residues carrying truncated core 1 O-glycans. We showed that this enzyme is capable of degrading purified mucin 2 (MUC2), the major protein component of mucus in the gut. An X-ray crystal structure of AM0627 (1.9 Å resolution) revealed O-glycan-binding residues that are conserved between structurally characterized enzymes from the same family. We further rationalized the substrate cleavage motif using molecular modeling to identify nonconserved glycan-interacting residues. We conclude that mutagenesis of these residues resulted in altered substrate preferences down to the glycan level, providing insight into the structural determinants of O-glycan recognition."

The sample comprised 10808 participants aged 45 years and older. The Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CESD-10) Scale were used to assess self-care disability and depressive symptoms, respectively.The prevalence of depressive symptoms and self-care disability among the surveyed residents was 45.1% and 23.4%, respectively. Overall, there was a significant positive association between self-care disability and depressive symptoms. Participants who reported having a self-care disability in relation dressing, bathing, transferring in and out of bed, using the toilet, and controlling urination and defecation were found to have a significantly higher risk of depressive symptoms. In addition, participants with a greater cumulative quantity of self-care disabilities had a higher risk of depressive symptoms, and higher CESD-10 scores.Self-care disability is a risk factor for depressive symptoms among middle-aged and elderly Chinese people. A positive correlation between the number of self-care disabilities and the risk of depressive symptoms was found."
https://openalex.org/W4223449383,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic substantially undermined medical education and healthcare systems. Owing to the pandemic in South Korea, most medical schools needed to be flexible when conducting online and offline classes, but the guidelines did not reflect the specificity of medical schools. This study described the impact of modified anatomy education schedules at the Seoul National University College of Medicine (SNUCM) on students' academic performance and satisfaction.Anatomy education in SNUCM is divided into three regional units (the upper and lower limbs, trunk, and head and neck). Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the schedule was mixed with simultaneous and rotating schedules. The authors conducted exceptions for online lectures, cadaver dissections, and written and practical examinations in three classes of approximately 50 students each. Furthermore, the authors assessed students' performance using three sets of written and practical examinations, and students completed a questionnaire regarding modified anatomy laboratory schedules.Despite the pandemic events in Seoul and South Korea during the laboratory sessions, all sessions were completed without any confirmed COVID-19 cases among the students, faculty, and staff. Most of the scores on the written and practical examinations significantly decreased in 2020 compared to those in 2019. However, in the trunk session that used the virtual anatomy application, the score on the practical examination in 2020 was significantly higher than that in 2019. Over 70% (79 and 77 out of 105 respondents on the upper and lower limbs and trunk, respectively) and 53% (55/105) students reported that there were no significant difficulties in studying anatomy in a face-to-face laboratory.In conclusion, an adequate education program for cadaver dissection should be developed and provided to overcome the pandemic restrictions. The study findings could serve as a reference for anatomy education during the COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4223639513,"The event related P300 potentials, positive waveforms in electroencephalography (EEG) signals, are often utilized in brain computer interfaces (BCI). Many studies have been carried out to improve the performance of P300 speller systems either by developing signal processing algorithms and classifiers with different architectures or by designing new paradigms. In this study, a new paradigm is proposed for this purpose. The proposed paradigm combines two remarkable properties of being a 3D animation and utilizing column-only flashings as opposed to classical paradigms which are based on row-column flashings in 2D manner. The new paradigm is utilized in a traditional two-layer artificial neural networks model with a single output neuron, and numerous experiments are conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of the proposed paradigm with that of the classical approach. The experimental results, including statistical significance tests, are presented for single and multiple EEG electrode usage combinations in 1, 3 and 15 flashing repetitions to detect P300 waves as well as to recognize target characters. Using the proposed paradigm, the best average classification accuracy rates on the test data are improved from 89.97% to 93.90% (an improvement of 4.36%) for 1 flashing, from 97.11% to 98.10% (an improvement of 1.01%) for 3 flashings and from 99.70% to 99.81% (an improvement of 0.11%) for 15 flashings when all electrodes, included in the study, are utilized. On the other hand, the accuracy rates are improved by 9.69% for 1 flashing, 4.72% for 3 flashings and 1.73% for 15 flashings when the proposed paradigm is utilized with a single EEG electrode (P8). It is observed that the proposed speller paradigm is especially useful in BCI systems designed for few EEG electrodes usage, and hence, it is more suitable for practical implementations. Moreover, all participants, given a subjective test, declared that the proposed paradigm is more user-friendly than classical ones."
https://openalex.org/W4225495030,"Common data models standardize the structures and semantics of health datasets, enabling reproducibility and large-scale studies that leverage the data from multiple locations and settings. The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) is one of the leading common data models. While there is a strong incentive to convert datasets to OMOP, the conversion is time and resource-intensive, leaving the research community in need of tools for mapping data to OMOP. We propose an extract, transform, load (ETL) framework that is metadata-driven and generic across source datasets. The ETL framework uses a new data manipulation language (DML) that organizes SQL snippets in YAML. Our framework includes a compiler that converts YAML files with mapping logic into an ETL script. Access to the ETL framework is available via a web application, allowing users to upload and edit YAML files via web editor and obtain an ETL SQL script for use in development environments. The structure of the DML maximizes readability, refactoring, and maintainability, while minimizing technical debt and standardizing the writing of ETL operations for mapping to OMOP. Our framework also supports transparency of the mapping process and reuse by different institutions."
https://openalex.org/W4225712663,"In Ethiopia, soil degradation is one of the major causes of low and declining agricultural productivity. As a result of this challenge, the country has been battling to adopt conservation practices. The main objective of this study was to assess farmers' adoption decisions of soil and water conservation (SWC) practices. For the survey, 304 farmers were selected from farming communities in Lege-Lafto Watershed, South Wollo,Ethiopia. Information were gathered using a household survey, and through focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and field observation. A binary logistic regression model and descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. The results indicated that about 64% of the farmers adopted soil and water conservation practices in the study area. The findings depicted that soil bund, stone bund, stone-faced soil bund, loose stone and brush-wood check dams, hillside terrace, and bund stabilized with vegetation are practiced in the watershed. The analysis result revealed adoption of soil and water conservation practices is significantly and positively influenced by the perception of farmers on erosion problems and SWC practices, family labour, educational level, and membership in local institutions. However, distance from residence to the nearest market and farmland, off-farm activities, and the ratio of cultivable land to family size influenced the adoption of SWC practices negatively. Therefore, improving farmers' educational status, and strengthening local institutions are vital for sustainable land management practices in the country."

https://openalex.org/W4223522842,"The purpose of this research was to investigate the key factors that influence behavioral intention to adopt MOOCs. The study was conducted in three countries namely, Poland, Thailand, and Pakistan. The study was considered significant considering the advancements in technology that have had an unprecedented impact on education, and the need to conduct learning online due to the COVID-19 to pandemics. The research adopted the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) and extended it by including other variables including culture, social distancing, and absorptive capacity. The study was conducted using the quantitative methodology, where the data was collected using a structured questionnaire. The data was collected from a sample from each of the three countries, and sample sizes were 455, 490, and 513 for Poland, Thailand, and Pakistan respectively. The data were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and multi-group SEM analysis. The results of the study indicated that effort expectancy and culture significantly and positively influenced behavioral intention to use MOOCs in all three countries. As well, absorptive capacity is mediated significantly by performance expectancy and effort expectancy. Facilitating conditions have a significant influence on MOOCs in both Thailand and Pakistan. Social influence has a significant influence on behavioral intention to use MOOCs in Thailand, hedonic motivation and price value have a significant influence on behavioral intention to use MOOCs in Poland, and the habit has a significant factor in Pakistan. The keys aspects influencing behavioral intention to Use MOOCs were different in Poland, Thailand, and Pakistan, in various factors which are performance expectancy, social distancing, price value, facilitating conditions, and social influence. The research recommended that it is important to evaluate the situation and prevailing conditions of the concerned country, before implementing the MOOCs and the associated online learning practices."
https://openalex.org/W4223486365,"This work introduce a new high dimensional 10-D hyperchaotic system with high complexity and many of coexisting attractors. With the adjustment of its parameters and initial points, the novel system can generate periodic, quasi-periodic, chaotic, and hyperchaotic behaviours. For special values of parameters, we show that the proposed 10-D system has a very high Kaplan-Yorke fractal dimension, which can reach up to 9.067 indicating the very complexity of the 10-D system dynamics. In addition, the proposed system is shown to exhibit at least six varied attractors for the same values of parameters due to its multistability. Regions of multistability are identified by analysing the bifurcation diagrams of the proposed model versus its parameters and for six different values of initial points. Many of numerical plots are given to show the appearance of different dynamical behaviours and the existence of multiple coexisting attractors. The main problem with controlling chaos/hyperchaos systems is that they are not always fully synchronized. therefore, some powerful synchronization techniques should be considered. The synchronization between the high-dimensional 10-D system and a set of three low-dimensional chaotic and hyperchaotic systems is proposed. Ten control functions are designed using the active control method, ensuring synchronisation between the collection of systems and the 10-D hyperchaotic system. Finally, using Multisim 13.0 software to construct the new system's electronic circuit, the feasibility of the new system with its extremely complicated dynamics is verified. Therefore, the novel 10-D hyperchaotic system can be applied to different chaotic-based application due to its large dimension, complex dynamics, and simple circuit architecture."
https://openalex.org/W4223538258,"University psychological counseling (UPC) is receiving growing attention as a means to promote mental health and academic success among young adults and prevent irregular attendance and dropout. However, thus far, little effort has been directed towards the implementation of services attuned to students' expectations and needs. This work intends to contribute to the existing literature on this topic, by exploring the perceptions of UPC among a population of 39,277 students attending one of the largest universities in the South of Italy. Almost half of the total population correctly identified the UPC target population as university students, and about one third correctly expected personal distress to be the main need that UPC should target. However, a large percentage did not have a clear idea about UPC target needs, activities, and population. When two specific student subsamples were analyzed using a person-centered analysis, namely (i) those who expressed their intention to use the counseling service but had not yet done so and (ii) those who had already used it, the first subsample clustered into two groups, characterized by an ""emotional"" and a ""psychopathological"" focus, respectively, while the second subsample clustered into three groups with a ""clinical"", ""socioemotional"", and ""learning"" focus, respectively. This result shows a somewhat more ""superficial"" and ""common"" representation of UPC in the first subsample and a more ""articulated"" and ""flexible"" vision in the second subsample. Taken together, these findings suggest that UPC services could adopt ""student-centered"" strategies to both identify and reach wider audiences and specific student subgroups. Recommended strategies include robust communication campaigns to help students develop a differentiated perception of the available and diverse academic services, and the involvement of active students to remove the barriers of embarrassment and shame often linked to the stigma of using mental health services."

OPERAM is a European cluster-randomized trial aimed at testing the effect of a structured pharmacotherapy optimization intervention on preventable drug-related hospital admissions in multimorbid adults with polypharmacy aged 70 years or older. Clinical results of the trial showed a pattern of reduced drug-related hospital admissions, but without statistical significance. In this study we assessed the cost-effectiveness of the pharmacotherapy optimisation intervention.We performed a pre-planned within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of the OPERAM intervention, from a healthcare system perspective. All data were collected within the trial apart from unit costs. QALYs were computed by applying the crosswalk German valuation algorithm to EQ-5D-5L-based quality of life data. Considering the clustered structure of the data and between-country heterogeneity, we applied Generalized Structural Equation Models (GSEMs) on a multiple imputed sample to estimate costs and QALYs. We also performed analyses by country and subgroup analyses by patient and morbidity characteristics.Trial-wide, the intervention was numerically dominant, with a potential cost-saving of CHF 3'588 (95% confidence interval (CI): -7'716; 540) and gain of 0.025 QALYs (CI: -0.002; 0.052) per patient. Robustness analyses confirmed the validity of the GSEM model. Subgroup analyses suggested stronger effects in people at higher risk.We observed a pattern towards dominance, potentially resulting from an accumulation of multiple small positive intervention effects. Our methodological approaches may inform other CEAs of multi-country, cluster-randomized trials facing presence of missing values and heterogeneity between centres/countries."
https://openalex.org/W4223434464,"APOE encodes a cholesterol transporter, and the ε4 allele is associated with higher circulating cholesterol levels, ß-amyloid burden, and risk of Alzheimer's disease. Prior studies demonstrated no significant differences in objective or subjective cognitive function for patients receiving the PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab vs. placebo added to statin therapy. There is some evidence that cholesterol-lowering medications may confer greater cognitive benefits in APOE ε4 carriers. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine whether APOE genotype moderates the relationships between evolocumab use and cognitive function. APOE-genotyped patients (N = 13,481; 28% ε4 carriers) from FOURIER, a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of evolocumab added to statin therapy in patients with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease followed for a median of 2.2 years, completed the Everyday Cognition Scale (ECog) to self-report cognitive changes from the end of the trial compared to its beginning; a subset (N = 835) underwent objective cognitive testing using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery as part of the EBBINGHAUS trial. There was a dose-dependent relationship between APOE ε4 genotype and patient-reported memory decline on the ECog in the placebo arm (p = .003 for trend across genotypes; ε4/ε4 carriers vs. non-carriers: OR = 1.46, 95% CI [1.03, 2.08]) but not in the evolocumab arm (p = .50, OR = 1.18, 95% CI [.83,1.66]). However, the genotype by treatment interaction was not significant (p = .30). In the subset of participants who underwent objective cognitive testing with the CANTAB, APOE genotype did not significantly modify the relationship between treatment arm and CANTAB performance after adjustment for demographic and medical covariates, (p's>.05). Although analyses were limited by the low population frequency of the ε4/ε4 genotype, this supports the cognitive safety of evolocumab among ε4 carriers, guiding future research on possible benefits of cholesterol-lowering medications in people at genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W4223505887,"Accommodating the needs of Indonesia's rapidly growing urban population is essential to reaching national reproductive health goals and international commitments. As in other rapidly urbanizing low- and middle-income countries, satisfying the needs of Indonesia's urban poor is both a high priority and a significant challenge. In this study, we assessed both how being from urban poor or near-poor households affects the quantity and quality of family planning and maternal health services received and the extent to which differentials had narrowed during the 2012-2017 period. This time interval is significant due to the introduction of a national social health insurance scheme in 2014, establishing the foundation for universal health care in the country. Data from the 2012 and 2017 Indonesian Demographic and Health Surveys were analyzed using logistic and multinomial logit regression. Poverty status was measured in terms of urban household wealth quintiles. For family planning, although urban poor and near-poor women made different method choices than non-poor women, no substantial 2017 differences in contraceptive prevalence, unmet need for family planning or informed choice were observed. However, urban poor women and to a lesser extent near-poor women systematically lagged non-poor urban women in both the quantity and quality of maternal health services received in connection with recent pregnancies. Significant maternal health service gains were observed for all urban women during the study reference period, with gains for poor and near poor urban women exceeding those for non-poor on several indicators. While the deployment of pro-poor interventions such as the national social health insurance scheme is likely to have contributed to these results, evidence suggesting that the scheme may not be influencing consumer health-seeking behaviors as had been anticipated along with continued limitations in public health sector supply-side readiness resulting in service quality issues suggest that more will have to be done."

https://openalex.org/W4223442912,"Sickling is the central pathogenic process of sickle cell disease (SCD), one of the most prevalent inherited hemolytic disorders. Having no easy access to antioxidants in the cytosol, elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) residing at the plasma membrane in sickle red blood cells (sRBCs) easily oxidize membrane proteins and thus contribute to sickling. Although the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is essential to rapidly clear ROS-damaged membrane proteins and maintain cellular homeostasis, the function and regulatory mechanism of the UPS for their clearance in sRBCs remains unidentified. Elevated levels of polyubiquitinated membrane-associated proteins in human sRBCs are reported here. High throughput and untargeted proteomic analyses of membrane proteins immunoprecipitated by ubiquitin antibodies detected elevated levels of ubiquitination of a series of proteins including cytoskeletal proteins, transporters, ROS-related proteins, and UPS machinery components in sRBCs. Polyubiquitination of membrane-associated catalase was increased in sRBCs, associated with decreased catalase activity and elevated ROS. Surprisingly, shuttling of p97 (ATP-dependent valosin-containing chaperone protein), a key component of the UPS to shuttle polyubiquitinated proteins from the membrane to cytosol for proteasomal degradation, was significantly impaired, resulting in significant accumulation of p97 along with polyubiquitinated proteins in the membrane of human sRBCs. Functionally, inhibition of p97 directly promoted accumulation of polyubiquitinated membrane-associated proteins, excessive ROS levels, and sickling in response to hypoxia. Overall, we revealed that p97 dysfunction underlies impaired UPS and contributes to oxidative stress in sRBCs."
https://openalex.org/W4223459511,"Impulse-cyclone drying (ICD) is a new type of pretreatment method to remove the excess moisture of wood fibers (WFs) with high speed and low energy consumption. However, the process parameters are often determined by the experience of the process operators, thus the quality of WF drying lacks an objective basis and cannot be ensured. To address this issue, this study adopted the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network, backpropagation neural network, and Central-Composite response surface method to establish a moisture content (MC) prediction model and a process parameter optimization model based on single-factor experiments. The initial MC, inlet air temperature, feed rate, and inlet air velocity were taken as the experimental factors, and the final MC was taken as the inspection index. The parameters of LSTM were optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, and the predicted value of MC was fitted to the model. The PSO-optimized LSTM had higher prediction accuracy than did the typical prediction models. The optimal process for the targeted MC, which was obtained by PSO, was featured with an initial MC of 10.3%, inlet air temperature of 242°C, feed rate of 90 kg/h, and inlet air velocity of 8 m/s. PSO-LSTM could be a new approach for predicting the MC of WFs, which, in turn, could provide a theoretical basis for the application of ICD technology in the biomass composite industry."

Whereas, subsequent dissociation of these complexes is a hallmark of the normal function of LCDs, proteins with LCDs may become prone to aggregate irreversibly into pathogenic amyloids because of missense mutations, which encourage protein misfolding (3Kim H.J.

Some examples of amyloidogenic LCD-containing proteins are FUS, TDP43, and HNRNPA1, which are all associated with ALS. Because LCDs are often disordered, cross-β structures are present in LCD condensates (12Guenther E.L. Cao Q. Trinh H. Lu J. Sawaya M.R. Cascio D. Boyer D.R. Rodriguez J.A. Hughes M.P. Eisenberg D.S. Atomic structures of TDP-43 LCD segments and insights into reversible or pathogenic aggregation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2018; 25: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and many proteins containing them form amyloids in disease; we speculate that these domains may be more susceptible to mutations that cause the formation of an amyloid to be energetically favorable. Under this assumption, we chose to focus our search for novel amyloidogenic proteins on those proteins that contain an LCD (Fig. 1). This search for unidentified amyloidogenic proteins based on pathogenic mutations expands on previous work (9Murray K.A. Hu C.J. Seidler P. Hughes M.P. Salwinski L. Sawaya M. Pan H. Eisenberg D.S. Identifying amyloid-related diseases by mapping mutations in low-complexity protein domains to pathologies.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2022; (In press)Google Scholar, 13Kato M. Zhou X. McKnight S.L. How do protein domains of low sequence complexity work?.RNA. 2022; 28: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) by considering a larger subset of the human proteome. Our approach is agnostic to details about the queried proteins (besides identifying LCDs based on amino acid sequence) such as their functions or the diseases with which they are associated. Also, while our approach does identify many known amyloidogenic proteins, our focus is solely on those that have never been documented to form amyloid fibers either in vivo or in vitro. Here, we advance computational screening methods to identify mutations that may cause a functional LCD to become amyloidogenic (9Murray K.A. Hu C.J. Seidler P. Hughes M.P. Salwinski L. Sawaya M. Pan H. Eisenberg D.S. Identifying amyloid-related diseases by mapping mutations in low-complexity protein domains to pathologies.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2022; (In press)Google Scholar). We define an amyloid as an irreversible fibrous protein aggregate with a cross-β-sheet scaffold. The common methods of experimental identification of amyloid are the binding of amyloidophilic dyes such as Congo red or thioflavin T (ThT) and X-ray diffraction revealing the ∼4.7 to 4.8 Å separation of β-strands and ∼10 Å separation of β-sheets. Amyloids are found in a wide range of diseases from Alzheimer’s to type II diabetes (14Rambaran R.N. Serpell L.C. Amyloid fibrils: Abnormal protein assembly.Prion. 2008; 2: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). These amyloidoses are characterized by deposition of insoluble amyloid aggregates that, by mechanisms not completely understood, lead to cellular injury, tissue damage, and organ dysfunction (15Merlini G. Seldin D.C. Gertz M.A. Amyloidosis: Pathogenesis and new therapeutic options.J. Clin. Oncol. 2011; 29: 1924-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). If amyloid deposition drives disease, it is crucial to identify the protein responsible to develop reliable treatments for the disease. We propose that many diseases have yet undiscovered amyloid components to their etiology. In this work, our algorithm identifies numerous known amyloidogenic mutations as well as many mutations not previously associated with any amyloidoses. Among the second group of mutations, we demonstrate that two from the protein TRK-fused gene protein (TFG) increase the amyloid propensity of the protein. The identification of this and other potential undiscovered amyloid proteins is important for understanding the pathogenesis and expanding the treatment options of their associated diseases. To identify LCDs, we first applied the SEG algorithm (16Wootton J.C. Federhen S. Statistics of local complexity in amino acid sequences and sequence databases.Comput. Chem. 1993; 17: 149-163Crossref Scopus (525) Google Scholar) to the human proteome to categorize amino acid segments as either high complexity or low complexity. We then conservatively defined an LCD as any low-complexity segment of at least 35 amino acids with leeway for five interrupting high-complexity amino acids in a row. Under these criteria, 3251 human proteins contain at least one LCD. We then scoured UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) (17UniProt ConsortiumUniProt: The universal protein knowledgebase in 2021.Nucleic Acids Res. 2021; 49: D480-D489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar), Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) (18Amberger J.S.

This set of mutations was collected while remaining agnostic to the functional consequences for the affected protein, so among these mutations are not only some that are pathogenic because they increase amyloid propensity but also many that are pathogenic for various other reasons unrelated to amyloidogenicity. Among the residues that make up LCDs, prolines are the most common, followed by glycine, serine, and alanine (Fig. 2A). Glycine is by far the most common residue to be replaced in pathologies, with 501 of the 738 disease-related mutations being changed from glycine (Fig. 2B). The most common mutation is from glycine to arginine, followed in descending order by glycine to aspartate, glycine to valine, and glycine to serine. The next most common residue to be replaced in pathologies is arginine with 57 mutations. This is followed by proline mutations, making up 50 of the documented disease-related mutations. These findings suggest that glycine residues are especially important in maintaining normal function of human LCDs. Next, we sought to identify the mutations from the set of 738 pathogenic mutations that increase the propensity of a functional sequence to form a steric zipper, the common adhesive protein motif driving amyloid (20Sawaya M.R. Hughes M.P. Rodriguez J.A. Riek R. Eisenberg D.S. The expanding amyloid family: Structure, stability, function, and pathogenesis.Cell. 2021; 184: 4857-4873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To achieve this, we used ZipperDB, a database that predicts the fibril-forming propensity of segments within proteins (21Goldschmidt L. Teng P.K. Riek R. Eisenberg D. Identifying the amylome, proteins capable of forming amyloid-like fibrils.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2010; 107: 3487-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). ZipperDB evaluates the energetic fit of 6-residue segments in the conformation of a steric zipper. Therefore, for each mutation, we analyzed two 11-residue sequences centered on the mutated residue: one containing the WT residue and one containing the mutant residue. For each of these sequences, all six possible hexamers containing the residue of interest were assigned energy values by ZipperDB (Figs. 3 and 4A). Proline residues are not energetically favorable in β-sheets, so segments containing this residue tend to have very high positive energy scores. Since proline is a common residue in LCDs (Fig. 2A), this skews a significant portion of the data to high positive values, and Figure 4A does not include this skewed portion of the plot (Fig. S1).Figure 4Mutant residues in the LCDs throughout the human proteome with greater propensity to form amyloid than their corresponding WT residue. A, energy scores of WT and mutant segments in LCDs computed by ZipperDB. Because each mutation generates six possible score pairs, only the score pair that mapped to the “region of interest” (inset) or with the greatest negative change from WT to mutant score is plotted for each mutation. The dashed line shows mutations that do not affect the ZipperDB score. The x and y intercepts are both at −23.0 kcal/mol of the segment, the ZipperDB threshold for a predicted amyloid-forming steric zipper. Inset contains a zoomed view of the lower right quadrant of the plot that is the “region of interest” containing points corresponding to a WT segment with a score above −23.0 kcal/mol of segment and a mutant segment with a score below −23.0 kcal/mol of segment, indicating a mutation that increases the amyloid propensity. B, heatmap displaying counts of the kinds of mutational changes in the “region of interest.” LCD, low-complexity domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In detail, we identified amyloidogenic mutations as follows: we predict a mutation to be amyloidogenic if a hexamer containing the WT residue has an energy value greater than the ZipperDB threshold of −23 kcal/mol (therefore with lower amyloid propensity) and the corresponding hexamer containing the mutant residue has an energy value lower than or equal to −23 kcal/mol (therefore with higher amyloid propensity) (Figs. 3, 4A and Table S1). Mutations that generated these hexamers were predicted to cause a gain-of-function amyloid propensity. This group contains 88 mutations, the most common changes being glycine to serine, glycine to valine, glycine to cysteine, and proline to leucine (Fig. 4B). Conspicuously, changes to charged amino acids are greatly underrepresented in this predicted-amyloidogenic set. For example, glycine to arginine changes are completely absent, whereas they are the most common type of pathogenic mutation in LCDs in general. This is unsurprising, however, since amino acid side chains on the interior of a steric zipper need to be able to pack closely together as well as to stack on top of each other along the fiber axis, and these charged side chains will repel each other making amyloid formation energetically unfavorable. Furthermore, statistical analysis reveals that glycine is the only residue that, when mutated, has statistically significant differences in whether the mutation is predicted to be amyloidogenic or not depending on which residue it mutates into (Table S2). In other words, for glycine only, the amino acid it mutates into is significant in determining whether the mutation is predicted to be amyloidogenic or not. Taken together, there are many documented mutations within LCDs that may drive a functional sequence to become amyloidogenic, but mutations from glycine and proline are more likely than others to be of this kind. To validate that our approach is capable of identifying amyloidogenic mutations, we combed the list for known amyloidogenic mutations and found several. Two of the listed mutations in hnRNPA1 (D314V and D314N) and the mutation in hnRNPA2B1 (D302V) have been experimentally shown to induce fiber formation (3Kim H.J. Kim N.C. Wang Y.-D. Scarborough E.A.

One of the listed mutations in KRT8 (G62C) has been demonstrated to enhance aggregation propensity (9Murray K.A. Hu C.J. Seidler P. Hughes M.P. Salwinski L. Sawaya M. Pan H. Eisenberg D.S.

Trinucleotide expansions leading to an extended poly-L-alanine segment in the poly (A) binding protein PABPN1 cause fibril formation.Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2685-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Known amyloidogenic proteins TDP43 and FUS also have mutations that appear on the list, but so far, these mutations have not been experimentally tested for increased amyloid propensity. These examples confirm that our approach can identify at least some mutations that contribute to the formation of amyloid fibers. To determine if our approach identifies novel amyloid mutations, we analyzed one of the pathogenically altered proteins, TFG. As part of its native function, TFG self-associates into octameric oligomers, and its LCD facilitates these octamers to form larger complexes (25Johnson A. Bhattacharya N. Hanna M. Pennington J.G. Schuh A.L. Wang L. Otegui M.S. Stagg S.M. Audhya A. TFG clusters COPII-coated transport carriers and promotes early secretory pathway organization.EMBO J. 2015; 34: 811-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The two mutations in TFG that were identified by our method, G269V and P285L, have been associated with Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease type 2 and hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy with proximal dominant involvement, respectively (26Tsai P.-C.

We also found that the WT protein and the protein with the P285L mutation are able to phase separate in vitro in the presence of a crowding agent, but with the G269V mutation, the protein forms amorphous aggregates (Fig. S2). We expressed and purified the LCD of TFG (residues 237–327), fused with mCherry to increase solubility, in three forms: the WT sequence, containing the G269V mutation (G269V), and containing the P285L mutation (P285L). Each construct was shaken at 37 °C for 138 h with ThT, a dye that fluoresces in the presence of amyloid fibers (28LeVine H. Quantification of beta-sheet amyloid fibril structures with thioflavin T.Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar, 29Nilsson M.R. Techniques to study amyloid fibril formation in vitro.Methods. 2004; 34: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Both mutant constructs demonstrated strong ThT fluorescence, whereas the WT construct did not (Fig. 5A). The presence of fibers from the mutant constructs and the absence of fibers from the WT construct were confirmed by electron microscopy (Fig. 5B). Both mutant fibers displayed an apparent twist, typical of amyloid fibers. The amyloid nature of the TFG 237 to 327 fibers was also confirmed through X-ray diffraction. Drops of solutions containing the fibers were suspended between glass rods and allowed to dry, which aligns the fibers between the rods. The fibers were placed in an X-ray beam with the length of the fibers perpendicular to the direction of the beam. The resulting diffraction pattern for both mutant fibers displayed distinct rings at resolutions representing the characteristic dimensions of an amyloid fiber: 10 Å representing the intersheet spacing and 4.7 Å representing the interstrand spacing (Fig. 5C). We observed nearly the same behavior in the full-length protein, with the differences being faster fiber formation, likely because of lower solubility, and the WT sequence was able to form fibers, although at a significantly slower rate (Fig. S3). In short, we found TFG exhibits amyloid behavior when pathogenically altered, as predicted by our bioinformatic approach. The most common residues within LCDs to be replaced in pathologies are glycine, arginine, and proline, all of which are known to be important for the normal function of many LCDs, especially with regard to the regulation of phase-separation properties (30Wang J.

Because of their functional importance in LCDs, altering these residues can result in pathology for various reasons unrelated to amyloidogenesis, but in this study, we are most interested in pathogenic mutations in LCDs that result in increased amyloidogenicity specifically, and the trends in predicted amyloidogenic mutations in LCDs are slightly different than overall pathogenic mutations in LCDs, with proline being the second most common residue to have mutations predicted to be amyloidogenic rather than arginine. The observed frequency of predicted amyloid-driving mutations (Fig. 4B) can to some extent be understood in terms of atomic structures. Mutational replacement of a residue can destabilize the native state, favoring a conformational change leading to a pathogenic loss of native function; alternatively, replacement can favor formation of amyloid, leading to pathogenic amyloid. Both effects are possible with replacement of glycine, which we identified as the most commonly replaced residue associated with disease (Fig. 2B) and with the most replacements predicted to be amyloidogenic (Fig. 4B). Glycine residues confer flexibility to the peptide backbone, which is important in maintaining the liquid properties of phase-separated protein droplets (30Wang J. Choi J.-M. Holehouse A.S. Lee H.O. Zhang X. Jahnel M. Maharana S. Lemaitre R. Pozniakovsky A. Drechsel D. Poser I. Pappu R.V. Alberti S. Hyman A.A. A molecular grammar governing the driving forces for phase separation of prion-like RNA binding proteins.Cell. 2018; 174: 688-699.e16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Glycine's lack of a side chain larger than a hydrogen atom disfavors secondary structure, since it grants an extra flexible peptide bond, and hence does not preferentially form α-helices or β-sheets (33Levitt M. Conformational preferences of amino acids in globular proteins.Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4277-4285Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). This means that glycine residues are less likely than other residues to contribute to the stability of an amyloid fiber core that is typically enriched with β-sheets. We previously demonstrated that glycines can introduce kinks into the backbone of β-strands in amyloid structures derived from low-complexity segments (34Hughes M.P. Sawaya M.R. Boyer D.R. Goldschmidt L. Rodriguez J.A. Cascio D. Chong L. Gonen T. Eisenberg D.S. Atomic structures of low-complexity protein segments reveal kinked β sheets that assemble networks.Science. 2018; 359: 698-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), which may partially destabilize kinked backbones in low-complexity amyloid structures. We have also found that glycines lead to extended β-strand motifs in these low-complexity amyloid structures, which may also contribute to their lability (35Murray K.A. Evans D. Hughes M.P. Sawaya M.R. Hu C.J. Houk K.N. Eisenberg D. Extended β-strands contribute to reversible amyloid formation.ACS Nano. 2022; 2: 2154-2163Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Considering only single-nucleotide variant missense mutations, glycine can potentially mutate into serine, alanine, glutamic acid, arginine, valine, aspartic acid, cysteine, and tryptophan (Fig. S4). The most common glycine mutations that we predicted to be amyloidogenic are glycine to valine, glycine to cysteine, and glycine to serine. Glycine to valine is the second most common glycine mutation predicted to be amyloidogenic. Valine has a relatively bulky side chain, which is branched at the β carbon, and side chains like this prefer to form β-sheet secondary structures. Changes from glycine to valine would likely facilitate the formation of a steric zipper for this reason, especially if the surrounding sequence is already somewhat amyloid prone other than being broken by the glycine residue and, as is the case for some glycine-rich LCD proteins (FUS and TDP43), forms metastable complexes with copies of itself as part of its function. One of the TFG mutations that increases amyloid propensity is a glycine to valine mutation (G269V). Glycine to cysteine is the third most common glycine mutation, which is predicted to induce amyloid propensity. The cysteine side chain is a thiol group that, when oxidized, can form disulfide bonds with other oxidized cysteine side chains. These covalent bonds normally greatly increase the stability of globular proteins, but these are normally intramolecular bonds. Intermolecu"

This unexplored territory of genetic diversity presents an abundance of novel proteins with potential applications in the life-science sectors. Here, we present the structural and functional elucidation of CPR-C4, a hypothetical protein from the genome of a thermophilic Candidate Phyla Radiation organism, identified through metagenomic sequencing. Our analyses revealed that CPR-C4 is a member of a family of highly conserved proteins within the Candidate Phyla Radiation. The function of CPR-C4 as a cysteine protease was predicted through remote structural similarity to the Homo sapiens vasohibins and subsequently confirmed experimentally with fluorescence-based activity assays. Furthermore, detailed structural and sequence alignment analysis enabled identification of a noncanonical cysteine-histidine-leucine(carbonyl) catalytic triad. The unexpected structural and functional similarities between CPR-C4 and the human vasohibins suggest an evolutionary relationship undetectable at the sequence level alone."

https://openalex.org/W4223504222,"Physical activity, sedentary behavior (SB), and sleep are habitual human behaviors (HHB) which are modifiable throughout the different life phases. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze how the time distribution throughout the day among HHB may be associated with body mass index (BMI). These results could provide inferences which can guide interventions that trigger changes in adolescent behaviors in favor of their health. The objective of this study was to verify the proportion of adolescents who meet the recommendation of sleep, moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and screen time (ST); to analyze the associations between HHB and BMI, and to determine possible changes in BMI associated with time reallocation between different HHB. Daily HHB recommendations (yes/no) were analyzed by frequency distribution. Compositional data analyses were used to examine the association between HHB and the BMI z-score ( z BMI) with covariates (sex, age, and socioeconomic status). Compositional isotemporal substitution models estimated the change in z BMI associated with HHB reallocations from 15 to 120 minutes. A total of 185 adolescents were included (15 to 18 years, 50.8% boys). Thus, total sleep time, SB, light physical activity (LPA) and MVPA were measured by 24-hour accelerometry for seven consecutive days. ST, demographic characteristics, and socioeconomic status were assessed using a questionnaire. Sleep, MVPA, and ST recommendations were achieved by 32.97%, 8.10%, and 1.08% of the sample, respectively. No adolescent was able to achieve all of the daily recommendations. Age was significantly and positively associated with zBMI ( p &lt;0.001). Simply replacing 75, 90, and 120 minutes of MVPA by LPA led to an estimated significant increase in zBMI ( 95CI% z-value , 0 . 01 to 1 . 49 ). The HHB relocation estimates in 24h did not show positive effects on z BMI, nor did it increase the time engaged in MVPA, which may raise the hypothesis that other parameters related to obesity and their related interactions need to be better understood."
https://openalex.org/W4223506453,"Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a serine/threonine dephosphorylating enzyme complex that plays numerous roles in biological processes, including cell growth and metabolism. However, its specific actions in many of these critical pathways are unclear. To explore mechanisms underlying metabolic enzyme regulation in the liver, we investigated the key pathways involved in regulation of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes in a mouse model with hepatocyte-specific deletion of Ppp2r1a, encoding the Aα subunit of PP2A. We performed transcriptome and phosphoproteome analysis in mouse livers at the age of 3 months and identified 2695 differentially expressed genes and 549 upregulated phosphoproteins in homozygous knockout mouse livers compared with WT littermates. In particular, the expression of metabolic enzymes Cyp2e1, Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2, Mdr1a, and Abcg2 was dramatically altered in homozygous knockout mouse livers. We also demonstrated that activation of PP2A reversed the decline of metabolic enzyme expression in primary mouse hepatocytes. We found that specific PP2A holoenzymes were involved in metabolic enzyme induction through dephosphorylation of transcription factors, nuclear receptors, or the target enzymes themselves, leading to dysregulation of xenobiotic metabolism or drug-induced hepatotoxicity. Notably, we confirmed that a regulatory axis, PP2A B56α-aryl hydrocarbon receptor-Cyp1a1, was involved in benzo(a)pyrene-induced cytotoxicity through dephosphorylation of the metabolic nuclear receptor, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, at serine 36. In addition, we showed that PP2A B56δ complexes directly dephosphorylated the multidrug efflux pump MDR1 (encoded by multi-drug resistance gene 1), contributing to drug resistance against the chemotherapeutic 5-fluorouracil. Taken together, these novel findings demonstrate the involvement of PP2A in the regulation of liver metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W4223530664,"Perforator flaps account for a fraction of reconstructive procedures despite their growing popularity. Specific microsurgical skills are required for successful harvesting of perforator flaps, which are difficult to attain through direct operating room training. Cadaver and small animal dissection cannot simulate human perforator dissection, lacking either bleeding and vessel feedback or providing too small calibers. Thus, we have developed and refined over the last ten years five perforator flaps models in living pig, described their harvesting technique and provided evidence for their effectiveness as perforator flap training models.CT angiography data from ten living pigs was used for detailed examination of the integument's vascular anatomy. Microsurgical techniques were used to standardize and harvest the perforator flaps in acute models. The same operator-assistant team, with no prior perforator flap harvesting experience, raised all flaps in a sequential manner, one animal per day, during a 7 weeks timespan. Porcine flaps were compared to human counterparts in terms of vessel caliber, dissection times. Immediate flap survival was measured as duration of perforator pulsation after completion of flap harvesting, measured every 10 minutes for up to two hours.Five perforator flaps were standardized, based on the deep cranial epigastric, thoracodorsal, lateral intercostal, cranial gluteal and dorsal cervical arteries and the operative technique was described in detail. Mean pig perforator size was 1.24±0.36 mm and mean pedicle diameter was 2.78±0.8 mm, which matched closely the human calibers for each flap. Total harvesting time increased 22.4% between the first two experiments due to a more cautious approach following the lack of perforator pulsation in all flaps in the first experimental animal. A total decrease of 44.4% harvesting time between second and last experiment was observed, as expected with all repetitive surgical procedures. Post-operative perforator pulsation time revealed a steep learning curve, with no or short-term pulsatile perforators in the first five pigs, followed by a 275% increase in total perforator pulsation time between 5th and 6th experimental animal. Based on these findings we provide a description of the most common mistakes, their consequences and gestures which can be trained using the pig perforator flaps, in order to overcome these mistakes.These five pig perforator flap models provide a fast and efficient learning tool to develop perforator flap harvesting skills safely. Surgical training using these five experimental models offers a similar hands-on perforator flap dissection experience as with human tissue, based on the similar sized calibers of both perforators and pedicles with their human counterparts."
https://openalex.org/W4223546820,"To improve consumer decision making, the results of risk assessments on food, feed, consumer products or chemicals need to be communicated not only to experts but also to non-expert audiences. The present study draws on evidence from literature reviews and focus groups with diverse stakeholders to identify content to integrate into an existing risk assessment communication (Risk Profile).A combination of rapid literature reviews and focus groups with experts (risk assessors (n = 15), risk managers (n = 8)), and non-experts (general public (n = 18)) were used to identify content and strategies for including information about risk assessment results in the ""Risk Profile"" from the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment. Feedback from initial focus groups was used to develop communication prototypes that informed subsequent feedback rounds in an iterative process. A final prototype was validated in usability tests with experts.Focus group feedback and suggestions from risk assessors were largely in line with findings from the literature. Risk managers and lay persons offered similar suggestions on how to improve the existing communication of risk assessment results (e.g., including more explanatory detail, reporting probabilities for individual health impairments, and specifying risks for subgroups in additional sections). Risk managers found information about quality of evidence important to communicate, whereas people from the general public found this information less relevant. Participants from lower educational backgrounds had difficulties understanding the purpose of risk assessments. User tests found that the final prototype was appropriate and feasible to implement by risk assessors.An iterative and evidence-based process was used to develop content to improve the communication of risk assessments to the general public while being feasible to use by risk assessors. Remaining challenges include how to communicate dose-response relationships and standardise quality of evidence ratings across disciplines."
https://openalex.org/W4223556254,"HIV prevalence and sexual risk have been estimated very high for transgender people. However, the limited sampling and data collection methods used in current research on transgender people potentially led to overrepresentation and generalisation of people at risk for HIV. Current HIV prevalence estimates in transgender populations are generalised from studies mainly focusing on transgender women engaging in sex work. Moreover, studies focusing on non-binary people, who identify with a broad range of identities beyond the traditional male and female gender identities, are scarce.To estimate the HIV prevalence rate in the Flemish and Brussels (Belgium) transgender population, including transgender women, transgender men and non-binary people, and to identify the associated risk factors.In this community-based cross-sectional study, self-identified transgender and non-binary (TGNB) people will be recruited through a two-stage time-location sampling approach. First, community settings in which TGNB people gather will be mapped to develop an accurate sampling frame. Secondly, a multistage sampling design is applied involving a stratification based on setting type (healthcare facilities vs outreach events), a selection of clusters by systematic sampling and a simple random selection of TGNB people within each cluster. Participants will complete an electronic self-reported survey to measure sociological, sexual and drug-using behaviors (risk factors) and oral fluid aliquots will be collected and tested for HIV antibodies. Logistic regression models will be used to evaluate risk factors independently associated with HIV infection. The presented study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04930614).This study will be the first to investigate the HIV prevalence rates and associated risk behaviors in an accurate representation of the TGNB population in a Western European country. The findings will globally serve as a knowledge base for identifying subgroups at risk for becoming infected with HIV within TGNB people and to set up targeted prevention programs."

https://openalex.org/W4223651261,"The relationship between hypothyroidism and the occurrence and progression of heart failure (HF) has had increased interest over the past years. The low T3 syndrome, a reduced T3 in the presence of normal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and free T4 concentration, is a strong predictor of all-cause mortality in HF patients. Still, the impact of hypothyroidism on the contractile properties of failing human myocardium is unknown. Our study aimed to investigate that impact using ex-vivo assessment of force and kinetics of contraction/relaxation in left ventricular intact human myocardial muscle preparations. Trabeculae were dissected from non-failing (NF; n = 9), failing with no hypothyroidism (FNH; n = 9), and failing with hypothyroidism (FH; n = 9) hearts. Isolated muscle preparations were transferred into a custom-made setup where baseline conditions as well as the three main physiological modulators that regulate the contractile strength, length-dependent and frequency-dependent activation, as well as β-adrenergic stimulation, were assessed under near-physiological conditions. Hypothyroidism did not show any additional significant impact on the contractile properties different from the recognized alterations usually detected in such parameters in any end-stage failing heart without thyroid dysfunction. Clinical information for FH patients in our study revealed they were all receiving levothyroxine. Absence of any difference between failing hearts with or without hypothyroidism, may possibly be due to the profound effects of the advanced stage of heart failure that concealed any changes between the groups. Still, we cannot exclude the possibility of differences that may have been present at earlier stages. The effects of THs supplementation such as levothyroxine on contractile force and kinetic parameters of failing human myocardium require further investigation to explore its full potential in improving cardiovascular performance and cardiovascular outcomes of HF associated with hypothyroidism."
https://openalex.org/W4226115036,"Simplified nonlinear models of biological cells are widely used in computational electrophysiology. The models reproduce qualitatively many of the characteristics of various organs, such as the heart, brain, and intestine. In contrast to complex cellular ion-channel models, the simplified models usually contain a small number of variables and parameters, which facilitates nonlinear analysis and reduces computational load. In this paper, we consider pacemaking variants of the Aliev-Panfilov and Corrado two-variable excitable cell models. We conducted a numerical simulation study of these models and investigated the main nonlinear dynamic features of both isolated cells and 1D coupled pacemaker-excitable systems. Simulations of the 2D sinoatrial node and 3D intestine tissue as application examples of combined pacemaker-excitable systems demonstrated results similar to obtained previously. The uniform formulation for the conventional excitable cell models and proposed pacemaker models allows a convenient and easy implementation for the construction of personalized physiological models, inverse tissue modeling, and development of real-time simulation systems for various organs that contain both pacemaker and excitable cells."
https://openalex.org/W4223420019,"Mutations in the CFTR gene lead to cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease associated with chronic infection and inflammation and ultimately respiratory failure. The most common CF-causing mutation is F508del and CFTR modulators (correctors and potentiators) are being developed to rescue its trafficking and activity defects. However, there are currently no modulators that stabilize the rescued membrane F508del-CFTR which is endocytosed and quickly degraded resulting in a shorter half-life than wild-type (WT). We previously reported that the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) MAPK pathway is involved in CFTR degradation upon cigarette smoke exposure. Interestingly, we found that ERK phosphorylation was increased in CF human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells (CF-HBE41o- and primary CF-HBE) compared to non-CF controls, and this was likely due to signaling by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). EGFR can be activated by several ligands, and we provide evidence that amphiregulin (AREG) is important for activating this signaling axis in CF. The natural osmolyte ectoine stabilizes membrane macromolecules. We show that ectoine decreases ERK phosphorylation, increases the half-life of rescued CFTR, and increases CFTR-mediated chloride transport in combination with the CFTR corrector VX-661. Additionally, ectoine reduces production of AREG and interleukin-8 by CF primary bronchial epithelial cells. In conclusion, EGFR-ERK signaling negatively regulates CFTR and is hyperactive in CF, and targeting this axis with ectoine may prove beneficial for CF patients."

The radiation field is correlated with the surgical field in the adjuvant radiotherapy setting; therefore, tailoring the irradiation field is reasonable.We retrospectively analyzed patients with oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers included in the cancer registry between 2015 and 2019 in the study hospital. Patients who underwent whole-neck irradiation (WNI) were compared with those who underwent lower-neck-sparing (LNS) irradiation.A total of 167 patients with oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers were included in the study. Cancer recurrence was recorded in 33% of the patients. The rate of recurrence of oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer at neck level IV was 8%. The 2-year incidence of level IV recurrence was lower in the WNI group than in the LNS group (2% vs. 10%; p = 0.04). The 2-year disease-free survival rates were 75% and 63% in the WNI and LNS groups, respectively (p = 0.08).The rate of level IV recurrence was higher in the LNS group than in the WNI group. Trends of improvement in disease-free survival with lower-neck irradiation suggested that it is premature to consider LNS irradiation as daily practice in patients with oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer."

We used data from children recruited in the Czech European Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (CELSPAC) at the ages of 11 y (n = 1065), 13 y (n = 811) and 15 y (n = 974). Information on body posture, practicing sport in a club and at a competitive level, and skinfold thicknesses (biceps, triceps, subscapula, suprailiaca and thigh) from pediatrician's medical records were collected. Body posture was inspected by a pediatrician. The sum of 5 skinfolds was used as a proxy of fat mass. The 85th and 95th percentiles defined 'overfat' and 'obese'children. Practicing sport in a club and at a competitive level were included as 'yes/no' answers. General linear mixed models with risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. Overall, 35.6% of children and adolescents had impaired body posture; the prevalence of 'incorrect' body posture increased by age (from 41.0% to 28.0%, p<0.001). Practicing sport in a club and at a competitive level decreased by follow-up (p<0.001), while the level of 'overfat' and 'obese' children increased (p<0.01). In separate models, 'incorrect' body posture was associated with non-practicing sport in clubs (RR = 1.68; 95% CI 1.43-1.97, p<0.001) or at competitive level (RR = 1.61; 95% CI 1.37-1.88, p<0.001) and with being 'overfat' (RR = 2.05; 95% CI 1.52-2.75, p<0.001) and 'obese' (RR = 2.15; 95% CI 1.68-2.75, p<0.001). When all variables were put simultaneously into the model additionally adjusted for sex, self-rated health and baseline body posture, similar associations remained. This study shows, that not participating in sport and being overfat/obese are longitudinally associated with 'incorrect' body posture. Therefore, the detection of these risk factors in childhood, through the development of school- and community-based interventions, should be advocated."

Based on the monthly monitoring data from 450 monitoring sites at the provincial borders of 27 provinces in China in 2019, the overall surface water quality at provincial boundaries in China was evaluated. The Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment-water quality index (CCME-WQI) showed that the provincial boundary water quality exceeded the fair level, and F1 was the most influential factor. Then, 27 factors that directly or indirectly affect the surface water quality were identified, and the indirect influencing factors were integrated into the ecological environmental quality index and human activities quantitative index. Finally, the 27 factors were integrated into six factors, and the relationship between these indicators and CCME-WQI as well as the concentration of influencing elements with respect to regulatory standard limits were analyzed. The proportion of building land was the most significant factor affecting the quality of the aquatic environment in provincial boundaries. In addition, the economic development level, proportion of farmland, and degree of social development were identified as significant influencing factors. The six factors have different degrees of impact on the concentrations of major elements with respect to standard limits. This study basically explores water resource management and offers significant reference and guidelines for the improvement of the quality of surface water at provincial boundaries in China."

Sheep affected with a CLN6 form display progressive regionally defined glial activation and subsequent neurodegeneration, indicating that neuroinflammation may be causative of pathogenesis. In this study, aggregation chimeras were generated from homozygous unaffected normal and CLN6 affected sheep embryos, resulting in seven chimeric animals with varied proportions of normal to affected cells. These sheep were classified as affected-like, recovering-like or normal-like, based on their cell-genotype ratios and their clinical and neuropathological profiles. Neuropathological examination of the affected-like animals revealed intense glial activation, prominent storage body accumulation and severe neurodegeneration within all cortical brain regions, along with vision loss and decreasing intracranial volumes and cortical thicknesses consistent with ovine CLN6 disease. In contrast, intercellular communication affecting pathology was evident at both the gross and histological level in the normal-like and recovering-like chimeras, resulting in a lack of glial activation and rare storage body accumulation in only a few cells. Initial intracranial volumes of the recovering-like chimeras were below normal but progressively recovered to about normal by two years of age. All had normal cortical thicknesses, and none went blind. Extended neurogenesis was evident in the brains of all the chimeras. This study indicates that although CLN6 is a membrane bound protein, the consequent defect is not cell intrinsic. The lack of glial activation and inflammatory responses in the normal-like and recovering-like chimeras indicate that newly generated cells are borne into a microenvironment conducive to maturation and survival."
