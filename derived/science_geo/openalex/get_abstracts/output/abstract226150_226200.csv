https://openalex.org/W2009317412,"THE Schlack and Kumpf procedure1 for identifying the amino-acids which provide terminal carboxyl groups in peptides has been made the basis of a micro method which works well with simple peptides and may be of use in studying the free α-carboxyl groups in proteins. In the case of glycylleucine and glycylvaline, the method has been used successfully, although preliminary experiments with insulin and wool keratin have indicated that some modification of the procedure may be necessary before it can be used with proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2050643423,"A VARIETY of freely segregating genes which specifically control the abilities of yeast to ferment α-glucosides has been discovered1,2. The three non-allelic genes determining the abilities of the haploid yeasts of the Carbondale breeding stock to grow with attendant visible gas evolution on maltose, α-methyl glucoside and sucrose, respectively, have been designated MA/ma, MG/mg and SU/su. It has been shown that these genes are concerned in the synthesis by the cell of maltase, an α-heteroglucosidase3 and β-fructofuranosidase, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W1967581268,"IN an interesting paper which appeared recently in Nature, Goldacre and Lorch1 put forward the hypothesis that folding and unfolding of protein chains plays a decisive part in amœboid movement and cytoplasmic streaming. The same hypothesis was put forward more than twenty years ago by us in connexion with a new theory of muscular contraction2. This theory said that the contraction is due to a folding of unfolded protein chains under the influence of chemical reactions, and as one of the possibilities a variation of pH was considered; this was illustrated in 1929 by the accompanying diagram."

https://openalex.org/W2043583063,"THE importance of molybdenum deficiency in the incidence of ‘whiptail’ in cauliflower and broccoli in acid soils is now established1–4. The disorder was known only under field conditions until recently, when cauliflower plants grown in molybdenum-deficient sand cultures5 showed symptoms closely resembling certain aspects of the disease. In later work6,7, analogous effects (death of the growing point and malformation of young leaves) developed in several Brassica species; but their occurrence was sporadic and unpredictable, except that they appeared after temporary recovery from an initially severe deficiency. Two features characteristic of many cases of ‘whiptail’, namely, plants with dark blue-green, narrow, elongated middle foliage and large well-developed outer leaves free from chlorosis, were generally lacking in the work cited."

https://openalex.org/W2054999069,"Diadema antillarum possesses an abundant black pigment which shows the chemical and histochemical properties of melanin, and is concentrated in epidermal chromatophores1. In view of much evidence from other forms of a relationship between the occurrence of melanin and phenolases, evidence of such enzymes in Diadema was sought."

https://openalex.org/W2071665044,"FACTOR Rb is a protein-like, heat-labile requirement of the nematode Rhabditis briggsae Dougherty and Nigon, 1949, for growth and reproduction under axenic conditions1,2; chick embryo and mammalian liver have been shown to be good sources of it, and some activity has previously been noted in human whole blood and plasma2."
https://openalex.org/W1992047656,"IN the course of experiments with injections of viruses into insect vectors, it became desirable to measure the amount of introduced inoculum. The conditions of the experiments demanded an instrument that would fulfil the following requirements: (a) to measure accurately the small amounts (approximately 1/8,000 c.c.) of liquid introduced into a single insect; and (b) to provide a means of introducing the inoculum into the small insects (leafhoppers) without excessive injury. The first condition could be fulfilled with many of the micro-injecting devices now on the market, or with the modified instrument described by Woodrow1. The use of any of these was complicated by the relatively large diameter of the injection needles. The problem was solved by drawing ‘Pyrex’ micropipettes similar to those ordinarily used for micromanipulation. These pipettes were sealed to hypodermic needles of 25 or 26 gauge. The glass and metal were cemented together with a paste made of glycerine and litharge. This simple device may also prove useful for introducing small amounts of fluids into cells."

https://openalex.org/W2042628301,"IN March 1950, a faecal specimen was collected from a patient in the Brisbane General Hospital, who was infected with Ascaris lumbricoides. This was preserved by the addition of hot 10 per cent formalin. The material was used afterwards in May and August to teach the Willis salt flotation method for demonstrating helminth infection. Nothing unusual was noted."
https://openalex.org/W2050170523,"IT was considered of interest to discover the effect of electric shock on epithelial regeneration, since there are indications that mitotic activity is profoundly affected in shock conditions1. In order to obtain quantitative information, artificially produced lesions of the corneal epithelium of rabbits were regarded as a suitable object. With the aid of Nižetić's corneal trepan and a small lancet, practically identical lesions were made in each cornea. Each of them had a diameter of 4.5 mm. and for convenience was dyed with uranin (1 per cent); thus it was easy to measure two diameters at right angles to each other. There were two groups, each consisting of four animals, and both eyes of each animal were operated on. One group of animals was stressed by electrical injury three times a day during observation, by applying alternating current of 50 c./s. and 45 V. for one second. Convulsions lasted for nearly 60 sec., unconsciousness up to 180 sec. Except during the convulsions, the sensitiveness of the cornea was normal. The other group served as a control. To obtain information as to the speed of regeneration, the extent of the two diameters of each lesion was measured with a circle every three hours during the day-time."

https://openalex.org/W1980825449,"IT is well known that a sensation of continuous tone may be produced by presenting to the ear regularly repeated trains of sinusoidal waves, although each train may consist of only a few oscillations followed by a relatively long ‘blank’ period1. I have observed that a sensation of tone may arise by the presentation of trains of very short pulses, each pulse of duration of 0.20 m.sec., and each train consisting of two such pulses only. The pulse duration quoted is that measured on a cathode ray oscilloscope across the output of the amplifier, no suitable instrument being available to monitor the air pressure wave-form as produced by the loudspeaker. The pulses were derived from an electronic stimulator, and were locked to the time-base at predetermined times, each being independently adjustable. Hence, for each time-base two pulses were obtained, the separation of which in time could be varied from zero (coincidence) to 10 m.sec. The time-base repetition-rate could be varied from 10 to 100 per sec. Within this range, at any given rate of repetition, progressive separation of the pulses gave rise to a sensation of falling pitch, and approximation caused a rising pitch. At a separation of 1 m.sec., the sensation was that of a 1,000-cycle per sec. tone, as matched against a known frequency source; at a separation of 2 m.sec. the tone was 500 cycles per sec., at 4 m.sec. 250 cycles per sec., and so on. Since the tone sensation dependent on the pulse separation was heard against a background due to the frequency of repetition of each pulse (the time-base repetition-rate), only those derived tones of frequency considerably higher than the frequency of repetition could readily be detected and matched against the standard frequency source."

https://openalex.org/W2029007819,"Hilton and Taylor1 obtained highly motile cultures of Bact. coli D 433 and of four other Bact. coli O group 111 strains by repeated subculture in nutrient broth and semi-solid agar and incubation at 22° C.; the period of passage required for this change was three to four weeks in semi-solid agar and slightly longer in broth. In this Laboratory, Bact. coli D 433 and other Bact. coli O group 111 strains have been found to develop a high degree of motility in 18–24 hr. under the following conditions. The strains are inoculated by a straight wire into 3 ml. of semi-solid agar (5 parts digest ox-heart broth + 1 part nutrient digest ox-heart agar, final pH. 7.4–7.6) in small screw-capped bottles (bijou type). A microscopic examination for motility is made of the surface growth which develops in 18–24 hr. at 20–22° C. The method has been used satisfactorily for routine motility testing of these organisms when subcultured direct from stock strains (stored at room temperature for 6–22 months in nutrient digest ox-heart agar stabs or on slopes of Loeffler's serum medium) or from fresh subcultures on MacConkey's medium."

https://openalex.org/W2065282734,"HITHERTO, benzene hexachloride has not been recommended for use on lime-washed surfaces, because it decomposes in lime slurry; it does not do so in slurries of chalk or ground limestone. Thus there was reason for believing that exposure to air would eventually make a freshly lime-washed surface suitable for spraying and, as the problem was of practical importance, the following experiment was made to settle the matter."
