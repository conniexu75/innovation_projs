https://openalex.org/W2091242855,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are hematopoietic stem cell disorders that often progress to chemotherapy-resistant secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML). We used whole-genome sequencing to perform an unbiased comprehensive screen to discover the somatic mutations in a sample from an individual with sAML and genotyped the loci containing these mutations in the matched MDS sample. Here we show that a missense mutation affecting the serine at codon 34 (Ser34) in U2AF1 was recurrently present in 13 out of 150 (8.7%) subjects with de novo MDS, and we found suggestive evidence of an increased risk of progression to sAML associated with this mutation. U2AF1 is a U2 auxiliary factor protein that recognizes the AG splice acceptor dinucleotide at the 3' end of introns, and the alterations in U2AF1 are located in highly conserved zinc fingers of this protein. Mutant U2AF1 promotes enhanced splicing and exon skipping in reporter assays in vitro. This previously unidentified, recurrent mutation in U2AF1 implicates altered pre-mRNA splicing as a potential mechanism for MDS pathogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2113679292,"Astrocytes contribute to the formation and function of synapses and are found throughout the brain, where they show intracellular store-mediated Ca(2+) signals. Here, using a membrane-tethered, genetically encoded calcium indicator (Lck-GCaMP3), we report the serendipitous discovery of a new type of Ca(2+) signal in rat hippocampal astrocyte-neuron cocultures. We found that Ca(2+) fluxes mediated by transient receptor potential A1 (TRPA1) channels gave rise to frequent and highly localized 'spotty' Ca(2+) microdomains near the membrane that contributed appreciably to resting Ca(2+) in astrocytes. Mechanistic evaluations in brain slices showed that decreases in astrocyte resting Ca(2+) concentrations mediated by TRPA1 channels decreased interneuron inhibitory synapse efficacy by reducing GABA transport by GAT-3, thus elevating extracellular GABA. Our data show how a transmembrane Ca(2+) source (TRPA1) targets a transporter (GAT-3) in astrocytes to regulate inhibitory synapses."
https://openalex.org/W1969360388,"Protein sulfenylation is a post-translational modification of emerging importance in higher eukaryotes. However, investigation of its diverse roles remains challenging, particularly within a native cellular environment. Herein we report the development and application of DYn-2, a new chemoselective probe for detecting sulfenylated proteins in human cells. These studies show that epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated signaling results in H(2)O(2) production and oxidation of downstream proteins. In addition, we demonstrate that DYn-2 has the ability to detect differences in sulfenylation rates within the cell, which are associated with differences in target protein localization. We also show that the direct modification of epidermal growth factor receptor by H(2)O(2) at a critical active site cysteine (Cys797) enhances its tyrosine kinase activity. Collectively, our findings reveal sulfenylation as a global signaling mechanism that is akin to phosphorylation and has regulatory implications for other receptor tyrosine kinases and irreversible inhibitors that target oxidant-sensitive cysteines in proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2096240481,"Neostriatal cholinergic interneurons are believed to be important for reinforcement-mediated learning and response selection by signaling the occurrence and motivational value of behaviorally relevant stimuli through precisely timed multiphasic population responses. An important problem is to understand how these signals regulate the functioning of the neostriatum. Here we describe the synaptic organization of a previously unknown circuit that involves direct nicotinic excitation of several classes of GABAergic interneurons, including neuroptide Y-expressing neurogilaform neurons, and enables cholinergic interneurons to exert rapid inhibitory control of the activity of projection neurons. We also found that, in vivo, the dominant effect of an optogenetically reproduced pause-excitation population response of cholinergic interneurons was powerful and rapid inhibition of the firing of projection neurons that is coincident with synchronous cholinergic activation. These results reveal a previously unknown circuit mechanism that transmits reinforcement-related information of ChAT interneurons in the mouse neostriatal network."
https://openalex.org/W2030294791,"Andrew Hattersley and colleagues report an exome sequencing study that identifies de novo heterozygous inactivating mutations in GATA6 as a common cause of pancreatic agenesis. This suggests an essential function for GATA6 in human pancreas development. Understanding the regulation of pancreatic development is key for efforts to develop new regenerative therapeutic approaches for diabetes. Rare mutations in PDX1 and PTF1A can cause pancreatic agenesis, however, most instances of this disorder are of unknown origin. We report de novo heterozygous inactivating mutations in GATA6 in 15/27 (56%) individuals with pancreatic agenesis. These findings define the most common cause of human pancreatic agenesis and establish a key role for the transcription factor GATA6 in human pancreatic development."

https://openalex.org/W2014055987,"Apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4), the major genetic risk factor for late onset Alzheimer disease, assumes a pathological conformation, intramolecular domain interaction. ApoE4 domain interaction mediates the detrimental effects of apoE4, including decreased mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 levels, reduced mitochondrial motility, and reduced neurite outgrowth in vitro. Mutant apoE4 (apoE4-R61T) lacks domain interaction, behaves like apoE3, and does not cause detrimental effects. To identify small molecules that inhibit domain interaction (i.e. structure correctors) and reverse the apoE4 detrimental effects, we established a high throughput cell-based FRET primary assay that determines apoE4 domain interaction and secondary cell- and function-based assays. Screening a ChemBridge library with the FRET assay identified CB9032258 (a phthalazinone derivative), which inhibits domain interaction in neuronal cells. In secondary functional assays, CB9032258 restored mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 levels and rescued impairments of mitochondrial motility and neurite outgrowth in apoE4-expressing neuronal cells. These benefits were apoE4-specific and dose-dependent. Modifying CB9032258 yielded well defined structure-activity relationships and more active compounds with enhanced potencies in the FRET assay (IC50 of 23 and 116 nm, respectively). These compounds efficiently restored functional activities of apoE4-expressing cells in secondary assays. An EPR binding assay showed that the apoE4 structure correction resulted from direct interaction of a phthalazinone. With these data, a six-feature pharmacophore model was constructed for future drug design. Our results serve as a proof of concept that pharmacological intervention with apoE4 structure correctors negates apoE4 detrimental effects in neuronal cells and could be further developed as an Alzheimer disease therapeutic.

ApoE functions as a major carrier of lipids and cholesterol in both the peripheral and central nervous systems (5.Mahley R.W. Apolipoprotein E.

Human apoE has 299 amino acids with three common isoforms (apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4) that differ at residue 112 or 158. ApoE3 contains a cysteine at residue 112 and an arginine at residue 158, whereas apoE4 has arginine at both positions, and apoE2 has cysteine (5.Mahley R.W. Apolipoprotein E.

ApoE4 displays an intramolecular domain interaction between its amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains, leading to a compact structure (12.Dong L.M. Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Simmons T. Mahley R.W.

Domain interaction in apoE4 is induced by Arg-112, which facilitates the formation of a salt bridge between Arg-61 in the amino-terminal domain and Glu-255 in the carboxyl-terminal domain (12.Dong L.M.

ApoE4 domain interaction was demonstrated by FRET in living neuronal cells (14.Xu Q. Brecht W.J. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Huang Y.

Chem. 2004; 279: 25511-25516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). FRET is a well established technique to detect changes in protein conformation or protein-protein interactions that relies on a distance-dependent transfer of photon energy between a donor and an acceptor fluorophore (15.Zhang J. Campbell R.E. Ting A.Y. Tsien R.Y. Creating new fluorescent probes for cell biology.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 906-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). The apoE4-FRET reporter showed a much stronger signal than the apoE3-FRET reporter, indicating that apoE4 has stronger domain interaction (14.Xu Q. Brecht W.J. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Huang Y.

The apoE-FRET specifically measures the interaction between the amino- and the carboxyl-terminal domains of apoE. Importantly, when threonine is substituted for arginine at residue 61 (R61T), this disrupts domain interaction in apoE4 and converts apoE4 to an “apoE3-like” molecule and decreases the FRET signal of apoE4 to the level of apoE3 in neuronal cells (14.Xu Q. Brecht W.J. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Huang Y. Apolipoprotein E4 domain interaction occurs in living neuronal cells as determined by fluorescence resonance energy transfer.J. Biol.

In neurons, apoE4 reduces expression of the protein subunits of mitochondrial respiratory complexes, such as subunit 1 of complex IV (mtCOX1) and subunit α of complex V, resulting in a reduction in mitochondrial respiratory function (16.Chen H.K.

Disrupting apoE4 domain interaction with small molecules, so-called apoE4 structure correctors, converts apoE4 into an apoE3-like conformation and reverses the apoE4-specific detrimental effects.

In the present study, we identified additional potent small molecules that inhibit domain interaction and thus reverse the detrimental effects of apoE4, using a high throughput, cell-based FRET primary screening assay that quantifies the change in apoE4 domain interaction and a panel of secondary cell- and function-based assays in neuronal cells. Screening a small molecule library led to the identification of phthalazinone analogs as a new class of apoE4 structure correctors that abolish apoE4 domain interaction-related detrimental effects in neuronal cells in culture. Minimum essential medium (MEM) with Glutamax, Opti-MEM I, Dulbecco's PBS (DPBS) with or without calcium and magnesium, nonessential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, and G-418 were purchased from Invitrogen.

Neuro-2a cells stably expressing the GFP/eDHFR FRET reporters were seeded at a density of 300,000 cells/well in 96-well plates and grown in riboflavin-free MEM with 10% FBS. Riboflavin was omitted to reduce background fluorescence. Two h after seeding, cells were loaded with a trimethoprim-hexachlorofluorescein conjugate (TMP-HEX, (LigandLinkTM Label, Active Motif) at 2 μm in culture medium and incubated for an additional 4 h. TMP is a cell-permeable and high affinity eDHFR ligand. After washing with PBS+ (PBS supplemented with 10 mm glucose, 0.9 mm CaCl2, and 0.49 mm MgCl2) three times, cells were incubated with various concentrations of compounds in riboflavin-free MEM without serum for 16 h. After washing once with PBS+, 200 μl of PBS+ was added to each well. Signals for both GFP (excitation, 485 nm; emission, 525 nm; cut-off, 515 nm) and FRET (excitation, 485 nm; emission, 565 nm; cut-off, 550 nm) were recorded on a Flexstation III (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The Z′ is >0.5, S/B is 1.6 with a CV <10% and is tolerant of 1% DMSO or less. Clones of Neuro-2a cells stably expressing GFP-apoE4-eDHFR at different levels were used to demonstrate that the expression level did not affect the FRET ratio. Five Neuro-2a clones (supplemental Fig. S1A) with increasing levels of GFP-apoE4-eDHFR were labeled with HEX, the GFP fluorescence and the FRET signal were measured, and the FRET ratio was calculated (supplemental Fig. S1B). Neuro-2a cells stably expressing apoE were seeded in 96-well black wall/clear bottom plates (Costar) at a density of 40,000 cells/well and incubated overnight in complete culture medium. At 70% confluence the following day, cells were carefully washed with PBS and changed to fresh Opti-MEM supplemented with MEM-NEAA and sodium pyruvate. For EC50 determination, each compound was tested in triplicate at seven concentrations (a 3-fold dilution series of 10,000 to 13.7 nm) plus mock control wells. The concentration of DMSO was kept at 0.5% in all of the wells. After a 24-h incubation, cells were fixed immediately with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature and then washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. An in-cell Western assay was performed using an in-cell Western kit (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE), according to the manufacturer's protocol with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were incubated in blocking buffer for 1.5 h, followed by overnight incubation with 100 μl of blocking buffer without (for background control) or with mouse anti-mtCOX1 antibody (1:1000, MitoSciences, Eugene, OR; lots D0804 and E0594 displayed high specificity to purified COX1 and for COX1 in lysate from Neuro-2a cells expressing apoE3 and apoE4). Then the wells were washed three times in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Tween washing solution). Cells were then incubated in 50 μl of blocking buffer containing 0.2% Tween 20, IRDye 800CW-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:800), Sapphire700 (1:1000, a nonspecific cell stain), and DRAQ5 (1:2000, a DNA dye). Fifty μl of the same staining solution were added to four empty wells (without cells) to determine background signals for Sapphire700/DRAQ5.

We hypothesized that hydrogen sulfide modulates high glucose (30 mm) stimulation of matrix protein synthesis in glomerular epithelial cells. High glucose stimulation of global protein synthesis, cellular hypertrophy, and matrix laminin and type IV collagen content was inhibited by sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), an H(2)S donor. High glucose activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1), shown by phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase and 4E-BP1, was inhibited by NaHS. High glucose stimulated mTORC1 to promote key events in the initiation and elongation phases of mRNA translation: binding of eIF4A to eIF4G, reduction in PDCD4 expression and inhibition of its binding to eIF4A, eEF2 kinase phosphorylation, and dephosphorylation of eEF2; these events were inhibited by NaHS. The role of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an inhibitor of protein synthesis, was examined. NaHS dose-dependently stimulated AMPK phosphorylation and restored AMPK phosphorylation reduced by high glucose. Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, abolished NaHS modulation of high glucose effect on events in mRNA translation as well as global and matrix protein synthesis. NaHS induction of AMPK phosphorylation was inhibited by siRNA for calmodulin kinase kinase β, but not LKB1, upstream kinases for AMPK; STO-609, a calmodulin kinase kinase β inhibitor, had the same effect. Renal cortical content of cystathionine β-synthase and cystathionine γ-lyase, hydrogen sulfide-generating enzymes, was significantly reduced in mice with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes, coinciding with renal hypertrophy and matrix accumulation. Hydrogen sulfide is a newly identified modulator of protein synthesis in the kidney, and reduction in its generation may contribute to kidney injury in diabetes."

PAMPs are essential for the survival of the microorganism and are therefore difficult for the microorganism to alter (1Akira S. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Toll-like receptors: critical proteins linking innate and acquired immunity.Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (3926) Google Scholar).

Recent reports have shown that TLR4 localization has a key role in determining, which of these signal transduction pathways are activated. TLR4 engagement on the plasma membrane leads to MyD88-dependent NF-κB activation, which is followed by translocation of TLR4 into endosomes where TRIF-dependent IRF3 activation takes place (8Kagan J.C.

Calcium (Ca2+) signals are required to initiate several types of transcriptional events and growth responses such as proliferation and apoptosis (11Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Calcium signaling: dynamics, homeostasis and remodeling.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4191) Google Scholar). In most eukaryotic cells, Ca2+ signals are triggered by the secondary messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), the cleavage product of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) by the enzymatic activity of phospholipase C (PLC). Binding of IP3 to IP3 receptors (IP3Rs) in the endoplasmic reticulum results in the release of Ca2+ from internal stores (12Kurosaki T. Tsukada S. BLNK: connecting Syk and Btk to calcium signals.Immunity. 2000; 12: 1-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that LPS-induced IRF3 activation and subsequent expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) requires the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the NADPH-dependent oxidase NOX4 (13Chiang E.

CD14 regulates the dendritic cell life cycle after LPS exposure through NFAT activation.Nature. 2009; 460: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), we decided to elucidate the role of intracellular Ca2+ in LPS-induced activation of inflammatory response. Here we report that release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores is required for efficient IRF3 activation in LPS-stimulated macrophages. In contrast, LPS-induced activation of NF-κB pathway did not require Ca2+. Mechanistically, PLCγ2 activity and subsequent release of intracellular Ca2+ was required for translocation of TLR4 from plasma membrane to endosomes, where TRIF-dependent IRF3 activation takes place. Our results describe novel regulatory role for Ca2+ in the activation of immune signaling. To address the role of Ca2+ in LPS-induced signaling, RAW 264.7 cells were pretreated with cell permeable intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA/AM and then stimulated with LPS. Expression level of IRF3-regulated ISG54 and NF-κB-dependent IκBα genes was determined by RT-QPCR. BAPTA/AM treatment reduced LPS-induced ISG54 expression dose-dependently and ∼70% reduction in ISG54 levels was observed with the highest inhibitor dose (Fig. 1A). A similar response profile was observed when additional IRF3-induced genes such as IFIT1 and IFIT3 were analyzed (supplemental Fig. S1). In contrast to these ISGs, LPS-induced expression of IκBα was not affected by BAPTA/AM treatment suggesting that intracellular Ca2+ flux is required for IRF3 but not NF-κB activation. To exclude the possibility that BAPTA/AM was regulating ISG54 expression in a more general way, RAW 264.7 cells were pretreated BAPTA/AM and then stimulated with IFN-β, which activates ISGs independently of IRF3 via Jak/Stat pathway. IFN-β-induced ISG expression was not significantly altered in BAPTA/AM-treated cells compared with those treated with DMSO vehicle (Fig. 1A, and supplemental Fig. S1A) demonstrating that inhibition of intracellular Ca2+ flux only affects LPS-induced IRF3 activation and ISG54 expression. Elevation of intracellular Ca2+ levels can also originate from extracellular sources. However, chelating extracellular Ca2+ with EGTA prior to LPS stimulation did not have an effect on LPS-induced expression of ISG54 (data not shown). Because depletion of intracellular Ca2+ reduced LPS-induced ISG54 expression, we hypothesized that increasing intracellular Ca2+ levels might potentiate LPS-induced responses. To test this, RAW 264.7 cells were pretreated with thapsigargin (Tg), which has been shown to trigger Ca2+ release from internal stores in macrophages (17Jin S.W. Zhang L. Lian Q.Q. Yao S.L. Wu P. Zhou X.Y. Xiong W. Ye D.Y. Close functional coupling between Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ channels and reactive oxygen species production in murine macrophages.Mediators Inflamm. 2006; 2006: 36192Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thapsigargin-treated cells showed ∼4-fold higher ISG54 expression after LPS stimulation compared with DMSO-treated cells (Fig. 1B). Thapsigargin alone did not, however, induce ISG54 expression in RAW 264.7 cells (data not shown). In line with the BAPTA/AM data, thapsigargin treatment did not have an effect on LPS-induced IκBα expression or on IFN-β-induced ISG54 or IFIT1/3 expression (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1B). Similar results were also observed when RAW 264.7 cells were pretreated with another Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (data not shown). The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and its muscle equivalent, sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), are the major sites for intracellular Ca2+ storage. Release of Ca2+ into cytoplasm from intracellular stores is mediated via IP3 receptors and ryanodine receptors (RyRs) on the ER and SR, respectively. Because IP3Rs are virtually universal, while RyRs are most evident in excitable cells such as skeletal and cardiac muscles, we hypothesized that IP3R might be the most likely pathway modulating LPS-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+. To address this, RAW 264.7 cells were pretreated with IP3R antagonist 2-ABP followed by LPS stimulation. LPS-induced ISG54 expression was reduced by ∼70% in RAW cells treated with highest dose of 2-ABP when compared with cells pretreated with DMSO vehicle (Fig. 1C). Moreover, the effect of 2-ABP was IRF3-specific, since LPS-induced IκBα expression or IFN-β induced ISG54 expression was not markedly altered in 2-ABP-treated cells (Fig. 1C). RyR antagonist Dantrolene did not have an effect on LPS-induced ISG54 expression (data not shown), which suggests that in macrophages IP3Rs mediate the release of intracellular Ca2+ following LPS stimulation. Collectively these data demonstrate that LPS-induced ISG54 expression requires the release of intracellular Ca2+ from ER, and that the release of Ca2+ is mediated via IP3 receptors. Moreover, the data suggests that intracellular Ca2+ is specifically required for efficient LPS-induced expression of IRF3- but not NF-κB-regulated genes, and that this effect is specific, since modulating intracellular Ca2+ levels did not have an effect on IFN-β-induced ISG54 expression. In addition, intracellular Ca2+ most likely works upstream of IRF3, because 2-ABP did not have an effect on ISG54 expression induced by constitutively active IRF3–5D expression construct (data not shown). Phospholipase C activity is the major cellular biochemical pathway generating IP3. These enzymes cleave PIP2 into IP3 and diacyl glycerol. Of the thirteen mammalian PLC isoforms described, PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 are structurally unique in a way that they can be activated via both receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases. Moreover, both PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 have been shown to be phosphorylated following LPS stimulation in myeloid cells (18Aki D. Minoda Y. Yoshida H. Watanabe S. Yoshida R. Takaesu G. Chinen T. Inaba T. Hikida M. Kurosaki T. Saeki K. Yoshimura A.

Although a previous report showed that PLCγ2 is required for LPS-induced Ca2+ flux in macrophages (18Aki D. Minoda Y. Yoshida H. Watanabe S. Yoshida R. Takaesu G. Chinen T. Inaba T. Hikida M. Kurosaki T. Saeki K. Yoshimura A.

With this in mind, we evaluated the possible role of PLCγ in LPS-induced ISG activation. When RAW 264.7 cells were pretreated with PLCγ inhibitor U73122 we observed a clear reduction in LPS-induced ISG54 expression, while the IκBα expression remained intact (Fig. 2A). Moreover, U73122 treatment did not have any effect on IFN-β-induced ISG54 expression. To further characterize which PLCγ isoform mediates LPS-induced ISG54 expression RAW 264.7 cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting PLCγ1 or PLCγ2. Quantitation of Western blots revealed that the protein expression of PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 after siRNA transfection was reduced by 90 and 60%, respectively (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, we observed that knockdown of only PLCγ2, but not PLCγ1, reduced LPS-induced ISG54 expression (Fig. 2B). In line with the previous data, knockdown of PLCγ1 or PLCγ2 did not have an effect on IFN-β induced ISG54 expression (Fig. 2B). To confirm that our observations were not limited to ISG54 but reflect a general requirement for PLCγ2 in LPS-induced expression of IRF3-dependent genes, we analyzed the effect of PLCγ2 knockdown on expression of RANTES/CCL5 and TRAIL. Similar to ISG54, knockdown of PLCγ2 reduced LPS-induced expression of these IRF3-dependent genes, while expression of NF-κB-dependent IκBα and TNF-α was unaffected by PLCγ2 knockdown (Fig. 2C). We also generated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) from wild-type and PLCγ2 knock-out mice. When these cells were stimulated with LPS, we observed that the expression of ISG54, TRAIL and IFN-β was markedly delayed and reduced in PLCγ2 knock-out macrophages compared with wild type macrophages (Fig. 2D). Importantly, the expression of NF-κB-regulated IκBα, TNF-α and IL-12 p35 genes was similar or even slightly higher in PLCγ2 knock-out macrophages compared with wild type cells (Fig. 2D). PLCγ2 knock-out macrophages also produced more TNF-α and less IRF3-regulated RANTES/CCL5 chemokine in response to LPS stimulation as determined by ELISA analysis (data not shown). Thus, by using chemical PLCγ inhibition, siRNA knockdown and bone marrow-derived macrophages from PLCγ2-deficient mice we have shown that PLCγ2 is required for efficient LPS-induced expression of IRF3-dependent genes while the NF-κB response remains intact. LPS stimulation triggers phosphorylation of IRF3. This leads to translocation of IRF3 into nucleus where it binds to promoter elements of IRF3-regulated genes. Western blot analysis of RAW 264.7 whole cell lysates revealed that LPS-induced IRF3 phosphorylation was significantly reduced in cells pretreated with IP3R antagonist 2-ABP or PLCγ inhibitor U73122 (Fig. 3A). Inhibition of intracellular Ca2+ release did not however affect LPS-induced degradation of IκBα, a hallmark of NF-κB activation (Fig. 3A). The requirement for intracellular Ca2+ for IRF3 activation was also confirmed in bone marrow-derived macrophages, where enforced increase of intracellular Ca2+ concentration by thapsigargin augmented LPS-induced IRF3 phosphorylation and inhibition of PLCγ activity by U73122 reduced IRF3 phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). Again, the activation of NF-κB pathway remained intact as determined by the level of IκBα degradation after LPS stimulation. To evaluate the effect of intracellular Ca2+ on nuclear translocation of IRF3 RAW 264.7 cells were treated with 2-ABP or thapsigargin. After LPS stimulation, cells were fractionated into cytosolic and nuclear fractions, and IRF3 levels were analyzed by Western blotting. Similar to experiments done with whole cell extracts, we noted that 2-ABP inhibited nuclear import of phosphorylated IRF3, whereas thapsigargin pretreatment enhanced LPS-induced translocation of IRF3 into nucleus (Fig. 3C). To obtain definitive proof for involvement of PLCγ2 in LPS-induced IRF3 activation, bone marrow-derived macrophages from wild type or PLCγ2 knock-out mice were stimulated with LPS for various times. Analysis of whole cell lysates revealed that IRF3 phosphorylation was markedly impaired in macrophages derived from PLCγ2 knock-out mice (Fig. 3D). In contrast, the activation kinetics of IκBα degradation was similar in both wild type and PLCγ2 knock-out macrophages but the NF-κB signaling was sustained longer in knock-out cells. In addition, we noticed that the IκBα expression levels were somewhat lower in unstimulated PLCγ2 knock-out macrophages suggesting that also the steady-state activation level of NF-κB pathway might be higher in PLCγ2 knock-out macrophages compared with wild type cells. Recent reports have shown that LPS-induced signal transduction is a multistep process. Binding of LPS to TLR4 on plasma membrane activates NF-κB signaling and after this initial phase TLR4 is translocated into endosomes (9Husebye H. Halaas Ø. Stenmark H. Tunheim G. Sandanger Ø.

Endocytic pathways regulate Toll-like receptor 4 signaling and link innate and adaptive immunity.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Endosomal localization results in, and is required for efficient IRF3 activation (8Kagan J.C. Su T. Horng T. Chow A. Akira S. Medzhitov R.

Because our data showed that inhibiting the PLCγ2-IP3-Ca2+ cascade only affected LPS-induced IRF3 activation, we hypothesized that Ca2+ might have a role in mediating TLR4 internalization. Moreover, PLCγ2 activity has been previously linked into activation and mobilization of actin network in myeloid cells (22Dearden-Badet M.T. Mouchiroud G. Re-distribution of phospholipase C γ2 in macrophage precursors is mediated by the actin cytoskeleton under the control of the Src kinases.Cell Signal. 2005; 17: 1560-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 23Cremasco V. Benasciutti E. Cella M. Kisseleva M. Croke M. Faccio R. Phospholipase C γ2 is critical for development of a murine model of inflammatory arthritis by affecting actin dynamics in dendritic cells.PLoS. One. 2010; 5: e8909Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To test this, RAW 264.7 cells were pretreated with 2-ABP or thapsigargin followed by LPS stimulation. Endosomes were enriched by ultracentrifugation (supplemental Fig. S2) and TLR4 levels in endosomal fraction were analyzed by Western blotting. LPS stimulation resulted in translocation of TLR4 into endosomal compartment and this process was inhibited when cells where incubated at +4 °C instead of +37 °C (Fig. 4A). More importantly, the recruitment of TLR4 into endosomes was completely abrogated when IP3R activation and subsequent Ca2+ release was blocked by 2-ABP treatment prior to LPS stimulation. When intracellular Ca2+ levels were elevated by thapsigargin pretreatment LPS-induced TLR4 endocytosis was significantly higher compared with cells treated with DMSO vehicle (Fig. 4A). In another set of experiments RAW 264.7 cells were pretreated with 2-ABP and stimulated with biotinylated LPS to evaluate if both TLR4 and LPS are recruited to endosomes in Ca2+-dependent manner. Again, 2-ABP treatment resulted in nearly complete inhibition TLR4 endocytosis after LPS stimulation (Fig. 4B). 2-ABP treatment also inhibited the recruitment of biotinylated LPS into endosomal compartment revealed by staining the Western blot membranes with streptavidin-HRP (Fig. 4B). Unfortunately the limiting number of PLCγ2 mice available did not enable us to perform endosomal fractionation experiments with bone marrow-derived macrophages. Our results show that PLCγ2-IP3-Ca2+ cascade is essential for LPS-induced expression of IRF3-regulated genes in macrophages. Mechanistically, the release of intracellular Ca2+ was required for recruitment of TLR4 into endosomes, where TRIF-dependent IRF3 signaling platform is assembled (8Kagan J.C. Su T. Horng T. Chow A. Akira S. Medzhitov R. TRAM couples endocytosis of Toll-like receptor 4 to the induction of interferon β.Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar, 10Husebye H.

What remains to be addressed is the pathway(s) leading from TLR4 into activation of PLCγ2. In B cells PLCγ2 is activated by Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) and spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) (12Kurosaki T. Tsukada S. BLNK: connecting Syk and Btk to calcium signals.Immunity. 2000; 12: 1-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When RAW 264.7 cells were treated with Btk inhibitor prior to LPS stimulation we did not observe any inhibition of IRF3-regulated genes (data not shown). Thus, Btk is not the PLCγ2 activating kinase in macrophages. There is some controversy on the role of Syk in PLCγ2 activation. We have previously observed that piceatannol, which inhibits Syk, specifically inhibits IRF3-dependent gene activation after LPS challenge (24Dang O. Navarro L. David M. Inhibition of lipopolysaccharide-induced interferon regulatory factor 3 activation and protection from septic shock by hydroxystilbenes.Shock. 2004; 21: 470-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Syk has also been shown to be associated with TLR4 in LPS-stimulated macrophages (25Chaudhary A. Fresquez T.M. Naranjo M.J. Tyrosine kinase Syk associates with Toll-like receptor 4 and regulates signaling in human monocytic cells.Immunol. Cell Biol. 2007; 85: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A report published during the revision of this report demonstrated the regulation of TLR4 internalization by CD14, and implicated both Syk and PLCγ2 in this process (26Zanoni I. Ostuni R. Marek L.R. Barresi S. Barbalat R. Barton G.M. Granucci F. Kagan J.C. CD14 Controls the LPS-Induced Endocytosis of Toll-like Receptor 4.Cell. 2011; 147: 868-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). In conclusion we have described here a novel regulatory component controlling LPS-induced IRF3 activation in macrophages. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized role for intracellular Ca2+ as an important regulator of TLR4 signaling and trafficking. All mice used in these experiments were housed in a pathogen-free environment and were bred and cared for in accordance with University of California, San Diego Animal Care Facility regulations. This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the UCSD Animal Subjects Committee. RAW 264.7 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. PLCγ2-deficient mice have been described elsewhere (27Wang D. Feng J. Wen R. Marine J.C. Sangster M.Y. Parganas E. Hoffmeyer A. Jackson C.W. Cleveland J.L. Murray P.J. Ihle J.N.

Bone marrow-derived macrophages were differentiated for 7 days in complete RPMI supplemented with 50 ng/ml M-CSF (Peprotech Inc.). All inhibitors and Ca2+ ionophores were obtained from Calbiochem. Ultrapure and biotin-conjugated Escherichia coli LPS were purchased from Invivogen and murine IFN-β was a generous gift from Biogen. siRNAs against PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 were purchased from Dharmacon with the catalogue numbers 040978 and 040979, respectively. RAW 264.7 cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For Western blotting, cells were lysed into Cell Lysis Buffer (Cell Signaling Technology) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Calbiochem). Antibodies for IκBα, IRF3, P-IRF3, PLCγ1, PLCγ2, and GAPDH were from Cell Signaling Technology. TLR4 antibody was from Invivogen and Histon H1 and LAMP1 antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Total cellular RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). For cDNA synthesis, High Capacity cDNA synthesis kit from Applied Biosystems was used. RT-QPCR was performed with Fast SYBR Green master mix from Applied Biosystems (primer sequences are available upon request). Endosomes were enriched by sucrose gradient centrifugation (21Hagen E. Myhre A.M. Tjelle T.E. Berg T. Norum K.R. Retinyl esters are hydrolyzed in early endosomes of J774 macrophages.J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 309-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after LPS stimulation, RAW 264.7 cells were lysed into homogenization buffer (0.25% sucrose, 3 mm imidazole, 0.5 mm EDTA) and homogenized with Dounce homogenizer (20 strokes). Nuclei were removed by centrifugation, and lysate was loaded on top of 64% sucrose and 17% Percoll gradient followed by centrifugation at 56,000 × g for 1 h. Endosome-enriched fraction was collected and washed with PBS by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Remaining pellet was suspended into homogenization buffer and expression of TLR4 or biotinylated-LPS was analyzed by Western blotting. Download .zip (.86 MB) Help with zip files"

https://openalex.org/W2038464067,"The bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) signaling pathway plays a critical role in the promotion and maintenance of the contractile phenotype in vascular smooth muscle cell (vSMC). Misexpression or inactivating mutations of the BMP receptor gene can lead to dedifferentiation of vSMC characterized by increased migration and proliferation that is linked to vascular proliferative disorders. Previously we demonstrated that vSMCs increase microRNA-21 (miR-21) biogenesis upon BMP4 treatment, which induces contractile gene expression by targeting programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4). To identify novel targets of miR-21 that are critical for induction of the contractile phenotype by BMP4, biotinylated miR-21 was expressed in vSMCs followed by an affinity purification of mRNAs associated with miR-21. Nearly all members of the dedicator of cytokinesis (DOCK) 180-related protein superfamily were identified as targets of miR-21. Down-regulation of DOCK4, -5, and -7 by miR-21 inhibited cell migration and promoted cytoskeletal organization by modulating an activity of small GTPase. Thus, this study uncovers a regulatory mechanism of the vSMC phenotype by the BMP4-miR-21 axis through DOCK family proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2060550559,"Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) plays critical roles in the regulation of DNA repair. Accordingly, small molecule inhibitors of PARP are being developed as agents that could modulate the activity of genotoxic chemotherapy, such as topoisomerase I poisons. In this study we evaluated the ability of the PARP inhibitor veliparib to enhance the cytotoxicity of the topoisomerase I poisons topotecan and camptothecin (CPT). Veliparib increased the cell cycle and cytotoxic effects of topotecan in multiple cell line models. Importantly, this sensitization occurred at veliparib concentrations far below those required to substantially inhibit poly(ADP-ribose) polymer synthesis and at least an order of magnitude lower than those involved in selective killing of homologous recombination-deficient cells. Further studies demonstrated that veliparib enhanced the effects of CPT in wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) but not Parp1(-/-) MEFs, confirming that PARP1 is the critical target for this sensitization. Importantly, parental and Parp1(-/-) MEFs had indistinguishable CPT sensitivities, ruling out models in which PARP1 catalytic activity plays a role in protecting cells from topoisomerase I poisons. To the contrary, cells were sensitized to CPT in a veliparib-independent manner upon transfection with PARP1 E988K, which lacks catalytic activity, or the isolated PARP1 DNA binding domain. These results are consistent with a model in which small molecule inhibitors convert PARP1 into a protein that potentiates the effects of topoisomerase I poisons by binding to damaged DNA and preventing its normal repair."
https://openalex.org/W2030150987,"Runt-related transcription factors (RUNX1, RUNX2, and RUNX3) are key lineage-specific regulators of progenitor cell growth and differentiation but also function pathologically as cancer genes that contribute to tumorigenesis. RUNX2 attenuates growth and stimulates maturation of osteoblasts during bone formation but is also robustly expressed in a subset of osteosarcomas, as well as in metastatic breast and prostate tumors. To assess the biological function of RUNX2 in osteosarcoma cells, we examined human genomic promoter interactions for RUNX2 using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-microarray analysis in SAOS-2 cells. Promoter binding of both RUNX2 and RNA polymerase II was compared with gene expression profiles of cells in which RUNX2 was depleted by RNA interference. Many RUNX2-bound loci (1550 of 2339 total) exhibit promoter occupancy by RNA polymerase II and contain the RUNX consensus motif 5′-((T/A/C)G(T/A/C)GG(T/G). Gene ontology analysis indicates that RUNX2 controls components of multiple signaling pathways (e.g. WNT, TGFβ, TNFα, and interleukins), as well as genes linked to cell motility and adhesion (e.g. the focal adhesion-related genes FAK/PTK2 and TLN1). Our results reveal that siRNA depletion of RUNX2, PTK2, or TLN1 diminishes motility of U2OS osteosarcoma cells.

These genes generally alter pathways linked to cell proliferation and survival, as well as other cellular activities required for tumorigenesis or cancer metastasis. However, a comprehensive assessment of gene regulatory networks controlled by RUNX proteins in specific tumors is necessary. In this study, we have analyzed the genomic function of RUNX2 in osteosarcoma cells to gain insight into molecular pathways that are perturbed in bone cancer. We examined loci that are directly bound and controlled by RUNX2 using whole genome chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIPs) for RUNX2 combined with genome-wide promoter microarrays (ChIP-on-chip), as well as gene expression profiling of cells depleted of RUNX2 using siRNAs. Our results reveal that RUNX2 controls genes and networks that are related to cell migration and adhesion, as well as other programs in osteosarcoma cells. ChIP assays were performed with SAOS-2 cells that were grown in McCoy's medium (Thermo Scientific, Logan, UT) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin/streptomycin, and l-glutamine (all from Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). SAOS-2 cells were grown to ∼80% confluence and were cross-linked for 10 min in culture medium at room temperature with 1% formaldehyde solution. Fresh formaldehyde stock solution contained 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 11% formaldehyde. Cross-linking was terminated by incubation of cells with 0.125 m glycine solution for 5 min. Cells were washed twice with 1× PBS, placed on ice, and harvested using a cell scraper in PBS with protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Cells were collected by centrifugation at 4 °C, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Cell pellets were thawed on ice before each use. ChIP was performed using previously published protocols (53Lee T.I. Johnstone S.E. Young R.A. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and microarray-based analysis of protein location.Nat.

In brief, cells were resuspended in Lysis Buffer 1 (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% Triton X-100, 1× protease inhibitors) for 10 min, collected by low speed centrifugation, and resuspended in Lysis Buffer 2 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1× protease inhibitors) for 10 min at room temperature. After the second centrifugation step, pellets were resuspended in 3 ml of Lysis Buffer 3 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine, 1× protease inhibitors), and chromatin was sonicated to an average length of ∼500 bp. For SAOS-2 cells, sonication was optimized to 16 pulses of 30 s with intervals of 30 s using a Sonic Dismembrator (model 550, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), while samples were maintained on ice at 4 °C. Triton X-100 was added (300 μl) to the sonicated lysate, and cellular debris was removed by microcentrifugation at 16,000 × g. Supernatants were adjusted with Sonication Buffer to the equivalent of ∼1.5 × 107 cells per ChIP sample. Input genomic DNA was saved separately and stored at −20 °C until further use. Dynal beads (protein G, 100 μl/ChIP, Invitrogen) were washed with blocking solution (PBS, 0.5% BSA, filtered) and precoated overnight with anti-RUNX2 antibodies (M70, 12 μg, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), polymerase II antibody (8WG16, 10 μl, Covance, Princeton, NJ), or IgG (rabbit polyclonal, 12 μg, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as a negative control. After three washes with blocking solution, 1 ml of chromatin was added, and suspensions were rotated for a minimum of 8 h at 4 °C. Beads were collected by magnetic attraction using a Magnarack (Invitrogen) and resuspended in 1 ml of RIPA buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 500 mm LiCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.7% sodium deoxycholate). This rinse cycle was repeated five times. Samples were then subjected to a single wash with 1 ml of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) and recovered by low speed centrifugation at 900 × g for 3 min. Beads were resuspended in 210 μl of elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1.0% SDS) and incubated at 65 °C for 25 min with intermittent agitation (vortex) at ∼2-min intervals to elute chromatin. Beads were recovered by centrifugation for 1 min at 16,000 × g at room temperature, and 200 μl was transferred to a new 1.5-ml tube. At this step, 20 μl (2%) of the input sample was diluted with 180 μl of elution buffer and processed in parallel with the ChIP samples. Cross-linking was reversed by incubating the suspensions for 12 h at 65 °C in an oven. The next day, samples were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence of RNase A (0.2 mg/ml in 200 μl of TE buffer) and subsequently for an additional 2 h at 55 °C in the"

The proximal MMP13 promoter contains evolutionarily conserved E26 transformation-specific sequence binding sites that are closely flanked by AP-1 and Runx2 binding motifs, and interplay among these and other factors has been implicated in regulation by stress and inflammatory signals. Here we report that ELF3 directly controls MMP13 promoter activity by targeting an E26 transformation-specific sequence binding site at position −78 bp and by cooperating with AP-1. In addition, ELF3 binding to the proximal MMP13 promoter is enhanced by IL-1β stimulation in chondrocytes, and the IL-1β-induced MMP13 expression is inhibited in primary human chondrocytes by siRNA-ELF3 knockdown and in chondrocytes from Elf3−/− mice. Further, we found that MEK/ERK signaling enhances ELF3-driven MMP13 transactivation and is required for IL-1β-induced ELF3 binding to the MMP13 promoter, as assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Finally, we show that enhanced levels of ELF3 co-localize with MMP13 protein and activity in human osteoarthritic cartilage. These studies define a novel role for ELF3 as a procatabolic factor that may contribute to cartilage remodeling and degradation by regulating MMP13 gene transcription.

Moreover, MMP13 levels and activity are enhanced in OA cartilage, associated with degenerative changes and co-localizing with MMP13-specific type II collagen cleavage products, inflammatory cytokines, and their receptors (4Billinghurst R.C.

Further, in vivo evidence has shown OA changes in transgenic mice overexpressing constitutively active MMP13 (9Neuhold L.A. Killar L. Zhao W. Sung M.L. Warner L. Kulik J. Turner J. Wu W.

Therefore, a thorough understanding of how MMP13 is transcriptionally regulated by intracellular regulatory factors and how their activities are modulated by extracellular cues leading to aberrant MMP13 expression in OA cartilage is essential. The E74-like factor 3 (ELF3), also known as ESE1, ESX, ERT, and JEN, is an epithelium-specific member of the E26 transformation-specific sequence (ETS) family of transcription factors (11Oettgen P. Alani R.M. Barcinski M.A. Brown L. Akbarali Y. Boltax J. Kunsch C. Munger K. Libermann T.A.

ETS transcription factors are trans-acting phosphoproteins that share a highly conserved DNA-binding winged helix-turn-helix domain (ETS domain), which specifically binds to ETS sequence motifs in the transcriptional control elements of target genes (12Sharrocks A.D. The ETS-domain transcription factor family.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). ETS factors induce or repress transcription depending on their activation by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and by their association with other cofactors in a promoter context-specific manner (12Sharrocks A.D.

Post-translational modifications influence transcription factor activity. A view from the ETS superfamily.BioEssays. 2005; 27: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). ETS proteins mediate a variety of biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, transformation, and tumor invasion, with the latter involving ECM remodeling by concerted modulation of MMPs and their inhibitors (14Trojanowska M.

In addition, ELF3 is strongly induced in a variety of cell types by stress or inflammatory conditions dependent, at least in part, on canonical NF-κB (p65/p50) binding to a high affinity NF-κB site in the proximal ELF3 promoter (22Grall F.

In chondrocytes, ELF3 expression is induced in vitro by IL-1β, and we have previously reported that it accounts for the NF-κB-dependent and partially for the IL-1β-mediated repression of the COL2A1 promoter (27Peng H. Tan L. Osaki M. Zhan Y. Ijiri K. Tsuchimochi K. Otero M. Wang H. Choy B.K. Grall F.T. Gu X. Libermann T.A. Oettgen P. Goldring M.B. ESE-1 is a potent repressor of type II collagen gene (COL2A1) transcription in human chondrocytes.J. Cell. Physiol. 2008; 215: 562-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), thus making ELF3 a potential proinflammatory mediator in OA disease. Herein, we provide evidence for a novel role of ELF3 as a regulatory component that drives the abnormal expression of MMP13 under proinflammatory conditions in chondrocytes. We show that ELF3 activates MMP13 transcription by binding to a conserved ETS site in its proximal promoter region and that ELF3 up-regulates MMP13 expression by acting in conjunction with MEK/ERK signaling and enhancing AP-1-driven MMP13 promoter activity in response to IL-1β stimulation. Importantly, dysregulated MMP13 expression and activity in OA articular cartilage is associated with enhanced levels of ELF3. Human primary chondrocytes were isolated, as described (28Ijiri K.

Immediately after surgery, the cells were isolated by sequential digestion with Pronase (Promega) and collagenase P (Promega), cultured to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and used for experimental purposes at passage one. Human immortalized T/C-28a2 chondrocytes were cultured in DMEM/Ham's F-12 containing 10% FBS, as described previously (27Peng H. Tan L. Osaki M. Zhan Y. Ijiri K. Tsuchimochi K. Otero M. Wang H.

Passage 0 chondrocytes were seeded in DMEM/F-12 containing 10% FBS, allowed to reach confluence, trypsinized, and seeded in 6-well plates in DMEM/F-12 containing 10% FBS for experimental purposes. All experiments involving IL-1β and TNFα (R&D Systems) stimulation were performed in serum-free conditions after overnight starvation. Human primary or immortalized chondrocytes were transfected, as described previously (28Ijiri K. Zerbini L.F. Peng H. Otu H.H. Tsuchimochi K. Otero M. Dragomir C. Walsh N. Bierbaum B.E.

Briefly, 2.5 × 105 cells were seeded 24 h before transfection in 6-well plates in DMEM/F-12 containing 10% FBS. The non-targeting control siRNA (Dharmacon) or siRNAs against ELF3 (Dharmacon) were transfected at a final concentration of 50 nm using Lipofectamine PLUS reagents in serum-free medium. Transfection efficiency was assessed using non-targeting siRNA conjugated with rhodamine (Dharmacon), and knockdown efficacy was assessed by real-time PCR and Western blotting. At 72 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with IL-1β or vehicle for the indicated times. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plus minikit (Qiagen), and 150 ng were reverse transcribed, as described (28Ijiri K. Zerbini L.F. Peng H. Otu H.H. Tsuchimochi K. Otero M. Dragomir C. Walsh N.

The data were calculated as the ratio of each gene to GAPDH, and HPRT1 was utilized as an additional housekeeping control. Human and mouse primary chondrocytes and human immortalized chondrocytes were maintained in DMEM/F-12 medium containing 10% FBS. Before treatments with IL-1β, cells were incubated in serum-free medium overnight and challenged with the cytokine for the indicated times. To collect total cell lysates, cells were rinsed with cold PBS and lysed with 1× radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) containing PMSF, proteinase inhibitors, and sodium orthovanadate, as indicated by the supplier. Protein content was determined using Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent (Pierce), and equal amounts of protein lysates were resolved in 10% Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions. Proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidine fluoride (PVDF) membranes using a semidry transfer system (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with primary antibodies against ELF3 (Abcam), phospho-p38, phospho-SAPK/JNK, phospho-ERK1/2, total p38, total SAPK/JNK, or total ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling); β-tubulin (Abcam) was used as loading control. After washing, the membrane was incubated with the corresponding secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Signals were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). The −1602/+20-MMP13-Luc promoter construct was described previously (30Tsuchimochi K. Otero M. Dragomir C.L. Plumb D.A.

The sense primer for each construct included an artificial SacI site and the antisense primer included an artificial XhoI site. The constructs were cloned into the pGL2-Basic luciferase reporter gene vector (Promega). The deletion mutant lacking the proximal −231/−39 bp sequence was generated by digestion of the −1602/+20 bp promoter construct with BbvCI and StuI (New England Biolabs) followed by blunt-ended ligation (Takara). Point mutants of the proximal ETS binding sites (EBS) (designated EBS-A, -B1, and -B2mut) within the MMP13 promoter were generated by two-step PCR mutagenesis using the wild type −273/+20-MMP13 construct as template. For the first PCR, common forward or reverse primers, containing XmaI and XhoI sites, respectively, were used in combination with the primers indicated in Table 1. The resulting PCR products were purified and utilized in the second PCR, performed with the common forward and reverse primers containing XmaI and XhoI restriction sites utilized for the first PCR.

https://openalex.org/W2014900666,"Cells use transporters of different affinities to regulate nutrient influx. When nutrients are depleted, low-affinity transporters are replaced by high-affinity ones. High-affinity transporters are helpful when concentrations of nutrients are low, but the advantage of reducing their abundance when nutrients are abundant is less clear. When we eliminated such reduced production of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae high-affinity transporters for phosphate and zinc, the elapsed time from the initiation of the starvation program until the lack of nutrients limited growth was shortened, and recovery from starvation was delayed. The latter phenotype was rescued by constitutive activation of the starvation program. Dual-transporter systems appear to prolong preparation for starvation and to facilitate subsequent recovery, which may optimize sensing of nutrient depletion by integrating internal and external information about nutrient availability."

Brefeldin A (BFA), a known inhibitor of the Arf1-guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) interaction, is highly cytotoxic. Therefore, interaction of Arf1 with ArfGEF is an attractive target for cancer treatment. However, BFA and its derivatives have not progressed beyond the pre-clinical stage of drug development because of their poor bioavailability. Here, we aimed to identify novel inhibitors of the Arf1-ArfGEF interaction that display potent antitumor activity in vivo but with a chemical structure distinct from that of BFA. We exploited a panel of 39 cell lines (termed JFCR39) coupled with a drug sensitivity data base and COMPARE algorithm, resulting in the identification of a possible novel Arf1-ArfGEF inhibitor AMF-26, which differed structurally from BFA. By using a pulldown assay with GGA3-conjugated beads, we demonstrated that AMF-26 inhibited Arf1 activation. Subsequently, AMF-26 induced Golgi disruption, apoptosis, and cell growth inhibition. Computer modeling/molecular dynamics (MD) simulation suggested that AMF-26 bound to the contact surface of the Arf1-Sec7 domain where BFA bound. AMF-26 affected membrane traffic, including the cis-Golgi and trans-Golgi networks, and the endosomal systems. Furthermore, using AMF-26 and its derivatives, we demonstrated that there was a significant correlation between cell growth inhibition and Golgi disruption. In addition, orally administrated AMF-26 (83 mg/kg of body weight; 5 days) induced complete regression of human breast cancer BSY-1 xenografts in vivo, suggesting that AMF-26 is a novel anticancer drug candidate that inhibits the Golgi system, targeting Arf1 activation. ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1) plays a major role in mediating vesicular transport. Brefeldin A (BFA), a known inhibitor of the Arf1-guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) interaction, is highly cytotoxic. Therefore, interaction of Arf1 with ArfGEF is an attractive target for cancer treatment. However, BFA and its derivatives have not progressed beyond the pre-clinical stage of drug development because of their poor bioavailability.

Reaching for high-hanging fruit in drug discovery at protein-protein interfaces.Nature. 2007; 450: 1001-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). Therefore, inhibitors of specific PPIs can act as novel therapeutic agents including anticancer drugs. Indeed, several small molecule-PPI inhibitors have been developed, such as Nutlin-3 for HDM2-p53 interaction (3Lauria A. Tutone M. Ippolito M. Pantano L. Almerico A.M.

In this study, we focused on the activation of ADP-ribosylation factors (Arfs) by its guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Arfs are members of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases that play a major role in mediating vesicular transport in the secretory and endocytic pathways (5D'Souza-Schorey C. Chavrier P. ARF proteins. Roles in membrane traffic and beyond.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). The cellular activity of Arfs is stimulated by the Sec7 domain of GEFs that promote the exchange of inactive GDP-bound forms to active GTP-bound forms (6Mossessova E. Gulbis J.M. Goldberg J. Structure of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sec7 domain of human arno and analysis of the interaction with ARF GTPase.Cell. 1998; 92: 415-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Arf1, the best characterized Arf, localizes primarily to the Golgi apparatus and regulates both anterograde and retrograde vesicular traffic (7Casanova J.E. Regulation of Arf activation. The Sec7 family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors.Traffic. 2007; 8: 1476-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The first identified small molecule PPI that targets the interaction between Arf-ArfGEF was brefeldin A (BFA, Fig. 1A), a lactone isolated from fungi, which inhibits the activation of Arf1 by a subset of its GEFs (8Renault L.

Treatment of BFA causes rapid but reversible disruption of the Golgi apparatus leading to the vesiculation of the cis-Golgi and trans-Golgi network (TGN) (10Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L. Tipper C.

Egger L. Monney L. Conus S. Rossé T. Fellay I. Borner C. Apoptotic cross-talk between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria controlled by Bcl-2.Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2286-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and in vivo at an early stage (13Sausville E.A.

Am. 1996; 2: 52-58PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, inhibitors of Arf1-ArfGEF interaction are valuable tools for studying membrane traffic as well as anticancer drug candidates. However, BFA and its derivatives have not progressed beyond the pre-clinical stage of drug development (13Sausville E.A. Duncan K.L. Senderowicz A. Plowman J. Randazzo P.A. Kahn R. Malspeis L.

We previously established a panel of 39 cell lines (termed JFCR39) coupled with our own drug sensitivity data base, which is comparable with that of the NCI60 panel from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) (15Monks A.

Potent antitumor activity of MS-247, a novel DNA minor groove binder, evaluated by an in vitro and in vivo human cancer cell line panel.Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4042-4049PubMed Google Scholar). Using the COMPARE computer algorithm (details described under “Results”), it is possible to correlate the growth inhibitory patterns of JFCR39 (termed “fingerprints”) of a test compound with those of known anticancer drugs and inhibitors (20Dan S. Tsunoda T. Kitahara O. Yanagawa R. Zembutsu H. Katagiri T. Yamazaki K. Nakamura Y. Yamori T.

Haber D.A. Settleman J. Cell line-based platforms to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of candidate anticancer agents.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Here, we have attempted to identify new Arf1-ArfGEF inhibitors with equivalent functions to BFA but with a different chemical structure, by using COMPARE-guided in silico screening instead of structure-based screening. This approach enabled us to discover a novel small molecule AMF-26 (Fig. 1B), an octahydronaphthalene derivative, which disrupts the Golgi system probably by inhibiting the Arf1 activation. AMF-26 shows strong growth inhibition against JFCR39 cell lines in vitro. Furthermore, it showed potent antitumor activity against xenografts of the human breast cancer cell line BSY-1 via oral administration. AMF-26 ((2E,4E)-5-((1S,2S,4aR,6R,7S,8S,8aS)-7-hydroxy-2,6,8-trimethyl-1,2,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydronaphthalen-1-yl)-2-methyl-N-(pyridin-3-yl-methyl)penta-2,4-dienamide) and its derivatives were synthesized from AMF-14, a natural product from the genus Trichoderma, and kindly provided by the Research Laboratories Kyoto, Nippon Shinyaku Co., Ltd. (Kyoto, Japan). Details of the synthesis methods and the chemical properties of the final product are described under supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” BFA and nocodazole were purchased from Sigma, and bafilomycin A1 was purchased from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK). For in vitro studies, these compounds were reconstituted to 10 mm in DMSO (Sigma) and stored at −20 °C. For animal experiments, AMF-26 was suspended in 0.05% Cremophor EL (Sigma-Aldrich) in water as a solid dispersion. The antibodies for immunostaining were as follows: monoclonal to anti-GBF1 (clone 25), anti-adaptin γ (clone 88), and anti-adaptin δ (clone 18) were purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA), anti-ERGIC53 (clone G1/93) was from ALEXIS Biochemicals (Farmingdale, NY), anti-Arf (clone 1D9) and anti-Arf1 (clone EP442Y) were from Abcam (Cambridge, United Kingdom), and anti-α tubulin (clone B-5-1-2) was from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal to anti-βCOP was from Abcam, and anti-cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was from Cell Signaling Technology (Boston, MA). Fluorescent probe LysoTracker was purchased from Invitrogen. For Western blotting, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or sheep anti-mouse IgG (GE Healthcare) was used as a secondary antibody. For immunofluorescence microscopy, Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used as a secondary antibody. A panel of 39 human cancer cell lines (termed JFCR39, described previously (22Yaguchi S. Fukui Y. Koshimizu I. Yoshimi H. Matsuno T. Gouda H. Hirono S. Yamazaki K. Yamori T. Antitumor activity of ZSTK474, a new phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor.J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2006; 98: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar)) was used for the in vitro experiments. BSY-1 (human breast cancer) cells were also used for in vivo studies. MDA-MB-435 (human breast cancer) cells stably expressing GFP-tagged human clathrin light chain a (MDA-MB-435/GFP-CLCa) were prepared as described previously (23Sakaushi S. Senda-Murata K. Fukada T. Oka S. Sugimoto K. Rhythmic cycle of clathrin-coated pit formation at the trans-Golgi network in human MDA-MB-435 cells.Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2007; 71: 571-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). HEK293T (human embryonic kidney) cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). JFCR39 and MDA-MB-435/GFP-CLCa cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a humidified atmosphere including 5% CO2 at 37 °C. HEK293T was cultured in DMEM (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and kanamycin, at 37 °C under 5% CO2. For in vivo studies, BSY-1 cells were grown as subcutaneous tumors in nude mice. The inhibition of cell proliferation was assessed by measuring changes in total cellular protein in a culture of each of the JFCR39 cell lines after 48 h of drug treatment by use of a sulforhodamine B assay (24Skehan P. Storeng R. Scudiero D. Monks A. McMahon J. Vistica D. Warren J.T. Bokesch H. Kenney S. Boyd M.R. New colorimetric cytotoxicity assay for anticancer drug screening.J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8824) Google Scholar). The 50% growth inhibition (GI50) value was calculated as described previously (18Yamori T. Panel of human cancer cell lines provides valuable database for drug discovery and bioinformatics.Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 2003; 52: S74-S79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Yamori T.

Potent antitumor activity of MS-247, a novel DNA minor groove binder, evaluated by an in vitro and in vivo human cancer cell line panel.Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4042-4049PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these sets of GI50 values, fingerprints are presented in the graphic profiles of relative sensitivity within JFCR39. To analyze the correlation between the fingerprints of drug A and drug B, we exploited the COMPARE computer algorithm as described previously (18Yamori T. Panel of human cancer cell lines provides valuable database for drug discovery and bioinformatics.Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 2003; 52: S74-S79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Dan S. Tsunoda T.

Cancer Inst. 2006; 98: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The Pearson correlation coefficient between the fingerprints of drug A and drug B was calculated (n = 39). MDA-MB-435/GFP-CLCa cells were grown in a 35-mm glass-bottomed dish (Matsunami Glass Ind., Osaka, Japan) for 48 h. Subsequently, the cells were treated with chemicals and imaged on the temperature-controlled stage top incubator (Tokai Hit Co., Shizuoka, Japan) of fluorescent microscopy IX81 (Olympus Corp.) with a ×60 oil, NA 1.35 objective at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Temperature and CO2 concentration were maintained with an INUG2A control unit (Tokai Hit Co.). MetaMorph Software (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA) was used to control image acquisition and manipulation. For time-lapse observation, images were recorded as described previously by Sakaushi et al. (23Sakaushi S. Senda-Murata K. Fukada T. Oka S. Sugimoto K. Rhythmic cycle of clathrin-coated pit formation at the trans-Golgi network in human MDA-MB-435 cells.Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2007; 71: 571-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The pulldown assay to estimate the signals of GTP-bound Arfs was performed as described previously (25Takatsu H. Yoshino K. Toda K. Nakayama K.

The GGAs promote ARF-dependent recruitment of clathrin to the TGN.Cell. 2001; 105: 93-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Every pulldown assay was performed with the VHS and GAT domains of human GGA3, cloned, and purified according to a published protocol (25Takatsu H. Yoshino K. Toda K. Nakayama K.

The GGAs promote ARF-dependent recruitment of clathrin to the TGN.Cell. 2001; 105: 93-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) with modifications as described under supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” We examined the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of endogenous Arfs as follows. BSY-1 cells treated with chemicals for 1 h were scraped into 0.5 ml of cold pulldown buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors mixture (Nacalai Tesque Inc., Kyoto, Japan). The cell lysate was cleared using GSH-Sepharose 4B beads. Then the lysate was gently rotated with the beads containing 50 μg of rGST-GGA3 protein for 30 min at 4 °C. Bound proteins were washed three times with cold wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol and protease inhibitors mixture), followed by boiling for 5 min with SDS sample buffer. Proteins in the samples were separated in 10–20% Multi-Gel II mini (Cosmo Bio Co., Tokyo, Japan), followed by electroblotting onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (GE Healthcare). After immunoblotting analysis using anti-pan-Arf and Arf1-specific antibody, immunoreactive bands were identified with the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (GE Healthcare). Band intensity was determined using the program ImageJ (National Institute of Health). To confirm the inhibitory efficacy of Arf1 activation, HEK293T/Arf1-HA cells were used to measure exogenous Arf1-GTP. Using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, HEK293T cells were transfected with the Arf1-HA expression vector, prepared as described under supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” For transfection, HEK293T cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 106 cells/10 ml in a 10-cm plate. The transfectants were then incubated for 24 h, and subsequently treated with chemicals for 1 h. The cell lysates were assayed as described above. Because of a difference in molecular weight, the exogenous band of Arf1-HA can be differentiated from the endogenous band of intact Arf1. In HEK293T/Arf1-HA cells, the expression of intact Arf1 was very low. Therefore, the intensity of the band corresponding to Arf1 was apparently weaker than that of the exogenous Arf1-HA. Conformational analysis of AMF-26 was performed on an Apple Power Mac G5 (PowerPC G5, 2.5 GHz; two central processing units), using the Conformational Analyzer with Molecular Dynamics and Sampling (CAMDAS) 2.1 program (27Tsujishita H. Hirono S. CAMDAS, an automated conformational analysis system using molecular dynamics. Conformational analyzer with molecular dynamics and sampling.J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1997; 11: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Ten molecular dynamic (MD) calculations were simultaneously performed using different initial structures. Each of the MD calculations was carried out for 1 ns with an integral time step of 1 fs. The lengths of the covalent bonds were fixed. The temperature of the system was maintained at 1,200 K to enhance the sampling efficiency. Conformers were sampled every 100 steps, and then each conformer was minimized until the root mean square of the gradients of the potential energy was below 0.001 kcal mol−1 Å−1. All conformations were clustered with torsion angles of heavy atoms using a threshold of ±30°. The Merck Molecular Force Field 94s was used to evaluate the potential energy surface of the molecule (28Halgren T.A. MMFF VI. MMFF94s option for energy minimization studies.J. Comput. Chem. 1999; 20: 720-729Crossref Scopus (956) Google Scholar, 29Halgren T.A. MMFF VII. Characterization of MMFF94, MMFF94s, and other widely available force fields for conformational energies and for intermolecular-interaction energies and geometries.J. Comput. Chem. 1999; 20: 730-748Crossref Scopus (650) Google Scholar). The dielectric constant was 80, but no cut-off distance for non-bonded interactions was used. Because of the low probability of the existence of conformers with higher energies, the conformers within 15 kcal mol−1 of the minimum energy of the molecule were adopted for superposition. To obtain the initial structure of the Arf1-AMF-26-Sec7 domain complex, the sampled conformers of AMF-26 were superposed onto BFA in the X-ray structure of the Arf-BFA-Sec7 domain complex (PDB code 1r8q) (8Renault L. Guibert B. Cherfils J. Structural snapshots of the mechanism and inhibition of a guanine nucleotide exchange factor.Nature. 2003; 426: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) using the parallel version of the SUPERPOSE program (30Iwase K. Hirono S. Estimation of active conformations of drugs by a new molecular superposing procedure.J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1999; 13: 499-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This superposes two molecules based on the physicochemical properties of the atomic groups, which is useful for estimating the binding conformation of a molecule by distinguishing it from the many conformations that are generated by CAMDAS. The program considers five types of physicochemical property: hydrophobic (HP), aromatic (AR), hydrogen-bond donors (HD), hydrogen-bond acceptors (HA), and hydrogen-bond donors/acceptors (DA). Each type is represented as a sphere with a predefined radius (1.0 or 0.5 Å) and is assigned to a functional group in a molecule (Fig. 4, A and B). After molecular superposition, the matching spheres were scored using the scoring matrix (supplemental Table S1). One AMF-26 conformation was chosen as the binding conformation based on the scores and the overlapped molecular volumes (Fig. 4C). The superposition calculations were performed using 28 nodes of a Dell PowerEdge 1950III (Intel Quad Core Xeon X5460; 3.16 GHz; 56 central processing units in total). The overlapped molecular volumes were calculated by SYBYL 7.3 (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO) on an Hewlett Packard work station xw8200 (Intel Xeon; 3.60 GHz; 2 central processing units). To relieve the steric hindrances, the coordinates of AMF-26 and of the residues within 4 Å from AMF-26 were optimized to reduce the root mean square of the gradients of potential energy below 0.05 kcal mol−1 Å−1 using SYBYL. The simplex minimization method before the conjugate-gradient minimization procedure was used. The Tripos force field was employed for the molecular energy calculation. The AMBER 4.1 charges (31Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz Jr., K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A.

https://openalex.org/W2011628505,"Microtubule-dependent transport is most often driven by collections of kinesins and dyneins that function in either a concerted fashion or antagonistically. Several lines of evidence suggest that cargo transport may not be influenced appreciably by the combined action of multiple kinesins. Yet, as in previous optical trapping experiments, the forces imposed on cargos will vary spatially and temporally in cells depending on a number of local environmental factors, and the influence of these conditions has been largely overlooked. Here, we characterize the dynamics of structurally defined complexes containing multiple kinesins under the controlled loads of an optical force clamp. While demonstrating that there are generic kinetic barriers that restrict the ability of multiple kinesins to cooperate productively, the spatial and temporal properties of applied loads is found to play an important role in the collective dynamics of multiple motor systems. We propose this dependence has implications for intracellular transport processes, especially for bidirectional transport.

We propose this dependence has implications for intracellular transport processes, especially for bidirectional transport. Many subcellular commodities are transported within the cytoplasm by groups of interacting microtubule motors, and there is evidence that such behavior is central to mechanisms that regulate and maintain the internal organization of eukaryotic cells (1Holzbaur E.L. Goldman Y.E. Coordination of molecular motors: from in vitro assays to intracellular dynamics.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2010; 1: 4-13Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 2Caviston J.P. Holzbaur E.L. Microtubule motors at the intersection of trafficking and transport.Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 530-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The combined function of motors may allow some cargos to be transported over longer distances and against higher opposing forces than single motor molecules can produce on their own (3Klumpp S. Lipowsky R. Cooperative cargo transport by several molecular motors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2005; 102: 17284-17289Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Additionally, many cargos are transported by multiple oppositely directed kinesin and dynein motors and move bidirectionally along microtubule filaments (4Ally S. Larson A.G. Barlan K. Rice S.E.

Biol. 2004; 14: R525-R537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). While this competition between antagonistic motors likely contributes to a number of intracellular trafficking processes, bidirectional transport has also been proposed to help disperse cargos throughout the cytoplasm (6Gross S.P. Hither and yon: a review of bi-directional microtubule-based transport.Phys Biol. 2004; 1: R1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), and, similarly, to allow cargos to avoid specific obstructions that would otherwise restrict their motion (4Ally S. Larson A.G. Barlan K. Rice S.E. Gelfand V.I. Opposite-polarity motors activate one another to trigger cargo transport in live cells.J.

Klumpp S. Lipowsky R. Tug-of-war as a cooperative mechanism for bidirectional cargo transport by molecular motors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Motor coordination via a tug-of-war mechanism drives bidirectional vesicle transport.Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 697-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In particular, many efforts have focused on determining whether different motor teams coordinate their activities, or whether motors simply compete in a potentially slower game of tug-of-war where the strongest motor team wins and therefore determines the net direction of cargo motion. Observations of how fast cargos reverse their transport direction are often used to choose between these mechanisms (11Kural C. Kim H. Syed S. Goshima G. Gelfand V.I. Selvin P.R. Kinesin and dynein move a peroxisome in vivo: a tug-of-war or coordinated movement?.Science. 2005; 308: 1469-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). However, a new theoretical model also suggests that, provided motor teams possess certain mechanochemical properties, cargos can still switch rapidly between plus- and minus-directed motions even if they are engaged in a tug-of-war (8Müller M.J. Klumpp S. Lipowsky R. Tug-of-war as a cooperative mechanism for bidirectional cargo transport by molecular motors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 4609-4614Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). This behavior is believed to occur since the unbinding of a motor within one of the teams can cause the remaining motors in that team to experience higher forces, which, in turn, can promote an unbinding reaction cascade where all of the motors in the losing team release from the filament. Given the differences between the candidate mechanisms described above, understanding the principles underlying bidirectional transport requires more detailed characterization of how loads are distributed between different motors on a cargo, and particularly, whether they can cooperate productively via sharing their total applied load, an issue that has proved to be fairly complicated in its own right. Recent experimental and theoretical studies have shown that multiple kinesins can produce larger run lengths and forces than single kinesin molecules (12Beeg J. Klumpp S. Dimova R. Gracià R.S. Unger E. Lipowsky R. Transport of beads by several kinesin motors.Biophys. J. 2008; 94: 532-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 13Rogers A.R. Driver J.W. Constantinou P.E. Jamison D.K. Diehl M.R. Negative interference dominates collective transport of kinesin motors in the absence of load.Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2009; 11: 4882-4889Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, when cargos are transported by small groups of kinesins, average cargo-filament detachment forces and velocities have been reported to be remarkably similar to those produced by single kinesin molecules, indicating multiple kinesin deviate from load-sharing behaviors (14Jamison D.K. Driver J.W. Rogers A.R. Constantinou P.E. Diehl M.R. Two kinesins transport cargo primarily via the action of one motor: implications for intracellular transport.Biophys. J. 2010; 99: 2967-2977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We have proposed that these results stem from the fact that a group of kinesins can bind to a filament in many different configurations that are not only distinguished by the number of bound motors, but also the distance between the lattice sites positions of each motor along the microtubule (14Jamison D.K. Driver J.W. Rogers A.R. Constantinou P.E. Diehl M.R. Two kinesins transport cargo primarily via the action of one motor: implications for intracellular transport.Biophys.

Productive cooperation among processive motors depends inversely on their mechanochemical efficiency.Biophys. J. 2011; 101: 386-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The geometry of a multiple motor system's bound configuration dictates how loads on a cargo are distributed between its filament-bound motors (14Jamison D.K. Driver J.W. Rogers A.R. Constantinou P.E. Diehl M.R. Two kinesins transport cargo primarily via the action of one motor: implications for intracellular transport.Biophys. J. 2010; 99: 2967-2977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). For spherical cargos, the front (leading) motor of a complex will bear the majority of a cargo's total applied load if its motors are spaced more than a few lattice sites apart from one another. Cooperative motor behaviors are therefore dependent on the amount of time motor complexes spend bound in these configurations compared with those where motors are spaced closely on the microtubule and can share their load more equitably. Yet, recent theoretical studies indicate there are several kinetic barriers that reduce the abilities of multiple-kinesin complexes to transition from single load-bearing motor configurations to those where each motor can assume a significant portion of the applied load (15Driver J.W. Jamison D.K. Uppulury K. Rogers A.R. Kolomeisky A.B. Diehl M.R. Productive cooperation among processive motors depends inversely on their mechanochemical efficiency.Biophys. J. 2011; 101: 386-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Overall, such behavior indicates that variation in the number of kinesins on a cargo beyond the simple presence or absence of motors will not have a large influence over their competition with other motor types, such as dynein. Many of the above analyses were made possible by new methods to create multiple motor complexes that have defined compositions, structural organization, and elastic properties. However, to date, the transport properties of these types of complexes have only been investigated in either the absence of applied loads (13Rogers A.R. Driver J.W. Constantinou P.E. Jamison D.K. Diehl M.R. Negative interference dominates collective transport of kinesin motors in the absence of load.Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2009; 11: 4882-4889Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 16Ali M.Y. Lu H. Bookwalter C.S. Warshaw D.M. Trybus K.M. Myosin V and kinesin act as tethers to enhance each others' processivity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U.S.A. 2008; 105: 4691-4696Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), or using a static optical trap where applied loads vary both spatially and temporally (14Jamison D.K. Driver J.W. Rogers A.R. Constantinou P.E. Diehl M.R. Two kinesins transport cargo primarily via the action of one motor: implications for intracellular transport.Biophys. J. 2010; 99: 2967-2977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). There is new theoretical evidence suggesting that multiple motor velocities can be influenced by temporal changes in the applied load and that cargo velocities can even be hysteretic if applied loads change rapidly in time (17Müller M.J. Klumpp S. Lipowsky R. Bidirectional transport by molecular motors: enhanced processivity and response to external forces.Biophys. J. 2010; 98: 2610-2618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Such behavior could occur if the rate that applied loads change is faster than the rate that a complex can remodel its bound configurations in response to a changing load. Thus, cargo transport by multiple kinesins may be influenced by the loading conditions produced in a static optical trap in ways that diminish their ability to produce large forces and move cargo with higher velocities. Nevertheless, even if these extrinsic factors dominate the dynamics of multiple motors in these types of assays, understanding the impact of these effects is still important since applied loads stem from various sources in cells, and accordingly, motors will experience a wide range of loads with different spatial and temporal dependences (e.g. loads will vary spatially and in time when antagonistic motors stretch their cargos during a tug-of-war). Here, we assess the role of such effects by examining the transport behaviors of organized multiple motor complexes containing two coupled kinesin-1 motor molecules under the controlled loads provided by an automated optical force clamp. Force clamp assays were performed using multiple motor complexes composed of two recombinant human kinesin-1 motors that are coupled by a single DNA duplex (50 nm in length) that functions as a molecular scaffold (Fig. 1A) (13Rogers A.R. Driver J.W. Constantinou P.E. Jamison D.K. Diehl M.R. Negative interference dominates collective transport of kinesin motors in the absence of load.Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2009; 11: 4882-4889Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 14Jamison D.K. Driver J.W. Rogers A.R. Constantinou P.E. Diehl M.R. Two kinesins transport cargo primarily via the action of one motor: implications for intracellular transport.Biophys. J. 2010; 99: 2967-2977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The kinesins are linked to each end of the scaffold via engineered, DNA-conjugated protein polymers (18Schweller R.M. Constantinou P.E. Frankel N.W. Narayan P. Diehl M.R. Design of DNA-conjugated polypeptide-based capture probes for the anchoring of proteins to DNA matrices.Bioconjug. Chem. 2008; 19: 2304-2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Biotin molecules are also incorporated into each end of the scaffold to allow the motor assemblies to be anchored to the surface of streptavidin-coated beads (500 nm diameter). Motor preparations and other assay conditions were identical to those used in our previous optical trapping experiments (14Jamison D.K. Driver J.W. Rogers A.R. Constantinou P.E. Diehl M.R. Two kinesins transport cargo primarily via the action of one motor: implications for intracellular transport.Biophys. J. 2010; 99: 2967-2977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In this procedure, two-kinesin complexes are first preformed in solution and then bound to bead surfaces using scaffold/bead concentration ratios where <30% of the beads interrogated, move along microtubules. Under these conditions, ∼93% of beads should possess no more than one surface-bound kinesin assembly. The probability that two assemblies on a bead are positioned close enough such that both can bind a microtubule simultaneously is <2%. To further ensure beads possessed two functional kinesins in the force clamp, beads were interrogated to verify their ability to advance forward continuously under an applied load of 10 pN. Afterward, the same bead was examined at lower applied loads. Force clamp assays were performed using similar procedures to those reported for single kinesin molecules (19Visscher K. Schnitzer M.J. Block S.M. Single kinesin molecules studied with a molecular force clamp.Nature. 1999; 400: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). A description of these methods is provided in the supporting information. Force clamp data were anti-alias filtered at 10 kHz and then digitized at 30 kHz. Average bead velocities were determined using a linear regression procedure that is similar to those presented in prior reports (14Jamison D.K. Driver J.W. Rogers A.R. Constantinou P.E. Diehl M.R. Two kinesins transport cargo primarily via the action of one motor: implications for intracellular transport.Biophys. J. 2010; 99: 2967-2977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 24Shtridelman Y. Cahyuti T. Townsend B. DeWitt D. Macosko J.C. Force-velocity curves of motor proteins cooperating in vivo.Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2008; 52: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this procedure, velocity segments are determined via a linear regression/chi-squared optimization procedure that both partitions traces into segments where beads moved with approximately constant velocities and determines bead velocities during these segments. Average bead velocities were weighted by the time they spent moving with a persistent velocity within a trace segment. While analogous to previous single kinesin analyses where motor velocities are weighted by bead run lengths, this treatment is necessary for analyses of multiple motor behaviors since bead velocities will change depending on the number of load bearing motors in the complex, and the time a complex will spend in these conformations factors into a cargo net average velocity. Relaxation time constants (τ) describing how rapidly two-kinesin velocities relax to a steady-state value were analyzed by fitting the time-dependent bead velocities to an exponential function: v(t) = v(0)exp(t/τ). Run lengths are taken as the total distance beads were transported forward in the optical trap. Pairwise distributions of bead displacements or step sizes were generated using established methods. Cargo displacement amplitudes were also analyzed using an objective step-finding algorithm (20Kerssemakers J.W.J. Munteanu E.L. Laan L. Noetzel T.L. Janson M.E. Dogterom M. Assembly dynamics of microtubules at molecular resolution.Nature. 2006; 442: 709-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Noise levels in traces were near-identical to those of our static trapping report (14Jamison D.K. Driver J.W. Rogers A.R. Constantinou P.E. Diehl M.R. Two kinesins transport cargo primarily via the action of one motor: implications for intracellular transport.Biophys. J. 2010; 99: 2967-2977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Predicted dependences of bead displacement sizes on the spacing between the kinesins on the microtubule are also provided in that report. The illustrations of multiple motor complexes in Figs. 1, 4, and 7 were generated with a mechanical model that uses measurements of single motor elasticity along with an energy minimization procedure to determine the distribution of loads within a complex and the position of the bead when both kinesins are bound to the microtubule at specified locations (14Jamison D.K. Driver J.W. Rogers A.R. Constantinou P.E. Diehl M.R. Two kinesins transport cargo primarily via the action of one motor: implications for intracellular transport.Biophys. J. 2010; 99: 2967-2977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The use of this procedure to calculate the rates motors will bind to, detach from, and step along the microtubule is described in Ref. 15Driver J.W. Jamison D.K. Uppulury K. Rogers A.R. Kolomeisky A.B. Diehl M.R. Productive cooperation among processive motors depends inversely on their mechanochemical efficiency.Biophys. J. 2011; 101: 386-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar. During these calculations, we assume the vectorial forces experienced by the motors will reach their equilibrium values rapidly compared with the rates motors step, bind, and detach. With this assumption, configuration-dependent transition rates are determined by the change in a complex's strain energy due to the stretching/relaxation of motor-bead linkages (see supplemental data). For the present analyses, these calculations were used to estimate the lattice positions along a microtubule that the trailing kinesin would bind most often and how rapidly a complex transitions from single-load bearing motor to load sharing configurations via motor stepping. The full form of our transition rate model described in Ref. 15Driver J.W. Jamison D.K. Uppulury K. Rogers A.R. Kolomeisky A.B. Diehl M.R. Productive cooperation among processive motors depends inversely on their mechanochemical efficiency.Biophys. J. 2011; 101: 386-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar was also used to predict how the distributions of complex's bound geometry evolve in time when applied loads are changed upon activation of the force clamp. A summary of these procedures is provided in the supplemental data.FIGURE 7The impact of multistate detachment when applied loads vary spatially. When multiple motors experience spatially dependent applied loads, the partial detachment of a complex leads to rearward cargo displacements that can reduce the load on the bead. Because these displacements are accompanied by changes in the number of bound motors, this process affects the force-dependent probability that a complex will be bound via a single or both motor molecules of a complex. Measurements of reward displacement sizes in a static optical trap (κtrap = 0.072 pN/nm) indicate that the applied load changes by 4–5 pN on average upon partial bead detachment if it exceeds kinesin's 7 pN stalling force. Such large changes in load can result in a significant reduction in the probability that a two-kinesin complex will be bound via a single motor within this force regime, and therefore result in higher cargo velocities, on average, relative to cases where the applied load remains constant or varies weakly as a function of cargo position.

J. 2010; 99: 2967-2977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar and “Experimental Procedures,” bead trajectories produced by two-kinesin complexes in the force clamp contained several signatures of multiple-motor dynamics found in our previous optical trapping study (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). Among these signatures is the ability to transport beads forward against loads that exceed the stalling force of a single kinesin motor (7.6 pN for our kinesin construct). An example of this behavior is provided in Fig. 1B, where a two-kinesin complex is shown transporting its bead against an applied load of 12 pN and over a distance of ∼50 nm. This trace also displays an event where the bead retracts backwards by a distance of 40 nm and then dwells at a fixed position prior to complete detachment. Such events were commonly found in our previous static trapping experiments and were attributed to the partial detachment of the complex (14Jamison D.K. Driver J.W. Rogers A.R. Constantinou P.E. Diehl M.R. Two kinesins transport cargo primarily via the action of one motor: implications for intracellular transport.Biophys. J. 2010; 99: 2967-2977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In both experiments, large rearward displacements will be produced if a complex's leading motor releases from the microtubule and the bead is left tethered to the filament via a single trailing motor linkage. In addition to multistate detachment events, individual bead trajectories were also found to contain mixtures of transport behaviors (Fig. 2). When transporting a bead against a constant 10 pN load, the complexes appear to switch between moments of continuous forward motion and stalling behaviors (Fig. 2A). Similarly, below kinesin's single-motor stalling force, two-kinesin complexes are found to switch between different transport modes where they either moved with high velocities (presumably due to load-sharing between the two motors) or significantly lower velocities (Fig. 2B). In agreement with these observations, histograms of bead velocities for loads of 2.5 and 5.5 pN contain two peaks, one corresponding to the velocities expected if bead transport were driven by only one kinesin within the complex, and a second peak at higher velocities (Fig. 3A). The larger amplitudes of the low velocity peaks shows that, as in our prior optical trapping study (14Jamison D.K. Driver J.W. Rogers A.R. Constantinou P.E. Diehl M.R. Two kinesins transport cargo primarily via the action of one motor: implications for intracellular transport.Biophys. J. 2010; 99: 2967-2977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), bead transport by two kinesins is dominated by the action of a single load-bearing motor and that load sharing makes a relatively small contribution to cargo transport when the applied load is beneath kinesin's stalling force.FIGURE 3Two-kinesin velocity and step-size distributions against constant loads. A, velocity distribution histograms for two-kinesin complexes at applied loads ranging between 2.5 and 12 pN. The load maintained by the force clamp is indicated in each panel. Bead velocities were determined via a chi-squared minimization procedure reported in Ref. 24Shtridelman Y. Cahyuti T. Townsend B. DeWitt D. Macosko J.C. Force-velocity curves of motor proteins cooperating in vivo.Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2008; 52: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar. Each plot is constructed from 7–27 trajectories (3–19 complexes). Bin counts were taken as the number of distinct trace components where beads moved with a velocity within the range of each bin for a period of 16 ms. B, distributions of bead displacement sizes found using a step-finding algorithm and their corresponding pairwise displacement distribution histograms. Bead displacement analyses are presented separately for cases where the force clamp was used to impose either low (2–5 pN; 58 traces included) or high (10–12 pN; 27 traces included) resisting loads.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Analyses of bead displacement amplitudes also reflect the prevalence of single load-bearing motor behaviors at low applied loads. When constructed from traces where the force clamp's load was less than 7 pN (Fig. 3B, upper panels), histograms of two-kinesin bead displacement sizes display a dominant peak centered at 8.1 ± 1.9 nm, single-motor step size of kinesin. The prevalence of such displacements is also found in histograms of pairwise bead displacements, which contain a clear dominant periodicity of 8.4 nm. This stepping behavior is similar to that observed in a static trap and is expected given that our velocity data indicates beads are primarily driven by a single motor molecule. Bead displacements equivalent to the kinesin intrinsic step size should be produced when only one motor within the complex assumes the applied load (14Jamison D.K. Driver J.W. Rogers A.R. Constantinou P.E. Diehl M.R. Two kinesins transport cargo primarily via the action of one motor: implications for intracellular transport.Biophys. J. 2010; 99: 2967-2977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Measurements of bead displacement amplitudes at high applied loads (≥10 pN) are indicative of both load-sharing between the two kinesins and the predominance of asynchronous motor stepping (Fig. 3B, lower panels). A histogram of bead displacement sizes at these loads contains an asymmetric peak at 5.5 ± 1.9 nm, while the corresponding pairwise distribution histogram shows somewhat less defined periodicity at 5.6 nm. Bead displacements of this size are signatures of asynchronous motor stepping, where one motor in the complex advances forward while the other remains fixed (14Jamison D.K. Driver J.W. Rogers A.R.

This stepping mode causes the separation distance between motors on the microtubule and the distribution of forces within the complex to change in time.

https://openalex.org/W2024327603,"Neutrophils provide an innate immune response to tissues infected with fungal pathogens such as Candida albicans. This response is tightly regulated in part through the interaction of integrins with extracellular matrix ligands that are distributed within infected tissues. The β(2) integrin, CR3 (CD11b/CD18), is unique among integrins in containing a lectin-like domain that binds the fungal pathogen-associated molecular pattern β-glucan and serves as the dominant receptor for recognition of fungal pathogens by human granulocytes. β-Glucan, when isolated in soluble form, has been shown to be a safe and effective immune potentiator when administered therapeutically. Currently a pharmaceutical grade preparation of β-glucan is in several clinical trials with an anti-cancer indication. CR3 binding of extracellular matrix, carbohydrate, or both ligands simultaneously differentially regulates neutrophil function through a mechanism not clearly understood. Using FRET reporters, we interrogated the effects of soluble β-glucan on intracellular and extracellular CR3 structure. Although the canonical CR3 ligand fibrinogen induced full activation, β-glucan alone or in conjunction with fibrinogen stabilized an intermediate conformation with moderate headpiece extension and full cytoplasmic tail separation. A set of phosphopeptides differentially regulated by β-glucan in a CR3-dependent manner were identified using functional proteomics and found to be enriched for signaling molecules and proteins involved in transcriptional regulation, mRNA processing, and alternative splicing. These data confirm that CR3 is a signaling pattern recognition receptor for β-glucan and represent the first direct evidence of soluble β-glucan binding and affecting a signaling-competent intermediate CR3 conformation on living cells."

https://openalex.org/W2037448556,"The authors show that paired stimulation of thalamic and cortical auditory inputs to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala, with the interstimulus interval mimicking their activation in behaving animals during auditory fear conditioning, results in persistent potentiation of synaptic transmission in the cortico-amygdala pathway in rat brain slices. Long-term synaptic enhancements in cortical and thalamic auditory inputs to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LAn) mediate encoding of conditioned fear memory. It is not known, however, whether the convergent auditory conditioned stimulus (CSa) pathways interact with each other to produce changes in their synaptic function. We found that continuous paired stimulation of thalamic and cortical auditory inputs to the LAn with the interstimulus delay approximately mimicking a temporal pattern of their activation in behaving animals during auditory fear conditioning resulted in persistent potentiation of synaptic transmission in the cortico-amygdala pathway in rat brain slices. This form of input timing–dependent plasticity (ITDP) in cortical input depends on inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-sensitive Ca2+ release from internal stores and postsynaptic Ca2+ influx through calcium-permeable kainate receptors during its induction. ITDP in the auditory projections to the LAn, determined by characteristics of presynaptic activity patterns, may contribute to the encoding of the complex CSa."

Protein kinase C (PKC) activation has been reported to inhibit insulin signaling selectively in endothelial cells via the insulin receptor substrate/PI3K/Akt pathway to reduce the activation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS). In this study, it was observed that PKC activation differentially inhibited insulin receptor substrate 1/2 (IRS1/2) signaling of insulin's activation of PI3K/eNOS by decreasing only tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS2. In addition, PKC activation, by general activator and specifically by angiotensin II, increased the phosphorylation of p85/PI3K, which decreases its association with IRS1 and activation. Thr-86 of p85/PI3K was identified to be phosphorylated by PKC activation and confirmed to affect IRS1-mediated activation of Akt/eNOS by insulin and VEGF using a deletion mutant of the Thr-86 region of p85/PI3K. Thus, PKC and angiotensin-induced phosphorylation of Thr-86 of p85/PI3K may partially inhibit the activation of PI3K/eNOS by multiple cytokines and contribute to endothelial dysfunction in metabolic disorders.

https://openalex.org/W1998453083,"Gram-negative bacteria assemble complex surface structures that interface with the surrounding environment and are involved in pathogenesis. Recent work in Campylobacter jejuni identified a gene encoding a novel phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) transferase Cj0256, renamed EptC, that serves a dual role in modifying the flagellar rod protein, FlgG, and the lipid A domain of C. jejuni lipooligosaccharide with a pEtN residue. In this work, we characterize the unique post-translational pEtN modification of FlgG using collision-induced and electron transfer dissociation mass spectrometry, as well as a genetic approach using site-directed mutagenesis to determine the site of modification. Specifically, we show that FlgG is modified with pEtN at a single site (Thr(75)) by EptC and demonstrate enzyme specificity by showing that EptC is unable to modify other amino acids (e.g. serine and tyrosine). Using Campylobacter strains expressing site-directed FlgG mutants, we also show that defects in motility arise directly from the loss of pEtN modification of FlgG. Interestingly, alignments of FlgG from most epsilon proteobacteria reveal a conserved site of modification. Characterization of EptC and its enzymatic targets expands on the increasingly important field of prokaryotic post-translational modification of bacterial surface structures and the unidentified role they may play in pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1971981920,"Human umbilical cord blood (HUCB) cells protect the brain against ischemic injury, yet the mechanism of protection remains unclear. Using both in vitro and in vivo paradigms, this study examined the role of Akt signaling and peroxiredoxin 4 expression in human umbilical cord blood cell-mediated protection of oligodendrocytes from ischemic conditions. As previously reported, the addition of HUCB cells to oligodendrocyte cultures prior to oxygen glucose deprivation significantly enhanced oligodendrocyte survival. The presence of human umbilical cord blood cells also increased Akt phosphorylation and elevated peroxiredoxin 4 expression in oligodendrocytes. Blocking either Akt or peroxiredoxin 4 activity with Akt Inhibitor IV or a peroxiredoxin 4-neutralizing antibody, respectively, negated the protective effects of human umbilical cord blood cells. In vivo, systemic administration of human umbilical cord blood cells 48 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion increased Akt phosphorylation and peroxiredoxin 4 protein expression while reducing proteolytic cleavage of caspase 3 in oligodendrocytes residing in the ipsilateral external capsule. Moreover, human umbilical cord blood cells protected striatal white matter bundles from degeneration following middle cerebral artery occlusion. These results suggest that the soluble factors released from human umbilical cord blood cells converge on Akt to elevate peroxiredoxin 4 levels, and these effects contribute to oligodendrocyte survival."

Thus, as the precise localization and function of Reg-1α and its capacity to be secreted in the central nervous system have not yet been determined, we examined the expression, localization, and function of Reg-1α in the neuronal cell lines PC12 and Neuro-2a (N2a) as well as in primary hippocampal cells. Here, we show that Reg-1α is preferentially localized at the membrane and around the nucleus of neuronal cells. In addition, Reg-1α is secreted, and it positively regulates neurite outgrowth through its membrane receptor EXTL3. We thus propose that Reg-1α is a new neuronal secreted factor that acts at least in part through its receptor EXTL3. The rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). PC12 cells were routinely grown in DMEM with 2 mm glutamine, 10% horse serum, and 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) in tissue culture dishes and passaged once a week. For differentiation in nerve growth factor (NGF)-containing medium, cells were seeded in 35-mm dishes or in 6-well plates coated with a thin film of collagen type I from rat tail tendons (Sigma) dissolved in 0.5 m acetic acid, precipitated in an equal volume of ethanol, and dried by evaporation. Before adding the differentiation culture medium (DMEM with 4 mm glutamine and 0.5% FBS), dishes were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). PC12 cells were seeded in this low serum medium at a density of ∼100,000 cells/cm2, and 50 ng/ml NGF (Promega) was added before incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in humidified air. To evaluate the effect of Reg-1α on neurite outgrowth, purified human recombinant Reg-1α (Biovendor, Germany) was added simultaneously at a concentration of 10−7 m. Murine N2a cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained in culture medium (Opti-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS) in a humidified incubator under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. To study neurite outgrowth, cells were seeded at a density of 100,000 cells/cm2 in 35-mm dishes or in 6-well plates coated with a thin film of poly-d-lysine (Sigma), and 10−7 m Reg-1α was added for 48 h. Primary cell cultures of neurons were obtained by dissecting the hippocampus of Sprague-Dawley rat embryos at E17.5 (C. E. Depré, Saint Doulchard, France). Cells were dissociated by enzymatic incubation in trypsin and 0.05% EDTA and by repeated pipetting. Cells were resuspended in Neurobasal medium with 2% B27, 0.25% 200 mm glutamine, 1% Glutamax, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were seeded at a density of 50,000 cells/cm2 on glass coverslips in 24-well plates previously coated with 10 μg/ml poly-d-lysine, and purified human recombinant Reg-1α at a dose of 10−7 m was simultaneously added (in some experiments). Cells were then cultured at 37 °C for 48 h (2 days in vitro) in humidified air with 5% of CO2. Full-length human Reg-1α cDNA in pCMV6-XL5 (GenBankTM accession number NM_002909.3; OriGene Technologies) was subcloned into the peGFP-C3 vector (Clontech) to produce a fusion protein in which the C-terminal end of Reg-1α is fused with the green fluorescence protein (GFP). Full-length mouse Reg-1α cDNA (GenBank accession number BC028761; Open Biosystems) was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Clontech). The full-length human Reg-1α cDNA in pCMV6-XL5 was used as a template to produce by PCR amplification the mutant Reg-1α form without the 22 amino acids of the peptide signal (PS) (human Reg-1α ΔPS). Primers were 5′-GGGTCGACACCATGCAAGAGGCCCAGACA-3′ and 5′-GGGGATCCTAGTTTTTGAACTTGCAGAC-3′ (start and stop codons are shown in italics) with the SalI and BamHI sites (underlined) inserted to facilitate cloning. The construct was subcloned in the pIRES2-eGFP vector (Clontech). Empty peGFP-C3, pcDNA3.1, and pIRES2-eGFP vectors were used as negative controls. 2 × 106 PC12 cells were transfected using NucleofectorTM (Amaxa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany). Cells were spun down at 900 rpm for 5 min and resuspended in 100 μl of Nucleofector solution V (Amaxa Biosystems) at room temperature followed by addition of 2 μg of each construct or empty vector. Mixtures were transferred to a 2-mm electroporation cuvette (Amaxa Biosystems) and inserted in the Nucleofector, and program U-29 was used for transfection. Immediately after transfection, 500 μl of culture medium was added to each cuvette, and transfected cells were plated in collagen-coated 35-mm dishes or 6-well plates with 1 ml of culture medium/well. Cells were grown for 48 h and then used for Western blot or immunocytochemical analysis. N2a cells were transfected with the same constructs/vectors using 6 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Freshly dissociated primary hippocampal cells were transfected using Nucleofector following the same protocol used for PC12 cells but with program G13. Transfected cells were then seeded on glass coverslips in 24-well plates coated with poly-d-lysine to study neurite differentiation or in 6-well plates to validate the transfection by Western blot analysis. To inhibit Reg-1α expression, we used two different siRNAs that target the following rodents Reg-1α sequences: 5′-GGA GCA GUG GGU CUC UGU UTT-3′ (siRNA1) and 5′-GGU CUC UGU UUC UCU ACA ATT-3′ (siRNA2). Both sense and antisense strands were synthesized by Invitrogen in desalted form. Transfection of siRNAs was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, for each transfection, 500 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen), 6 μl of Lipofectamine 2000, and 500 pmol of siRNAs per well were used. Full-length human EXTL3 cDNA was subcloned into the pIRES2-eGFP vector (a gift from Dr. Win van Hul). The shRNA against human EXTL3 and scrambled, non-effective shRNA (negative control) were cloned in pGFP-V-RS (TG313126, OriGene Technologies). PC12 cells were transfected with these constructs using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were grown for 48 h and then used for Western blot or immunocytochemical analysis. For Reg-1α antibody blocking experiments, PC12 and primary neurons were plated as above, and rabbit anti-Reg-1α antibody was added to the culture medium when the medium was changed, respectively, to differentiation culture medium for PC12 and to Neurobasal with B27 supplement for primary neurons. Neurite outgrowth was then analyzed. Neurite outgrowth was quantified by imaging neurons using a Zeiss Axiovert microscope and an MRm2 camera system. Images of five fields per well were taken. Neurite growth was determined by manually tracing the length of 1) all the neurites that could be associated with a particular cell body and 2) the longest neurite per cell for all cells in a field that had an identifiable neurite and for which the entire neurite arbor could be visualized. We measured the number, length, and total output (sum length) of only primary neurites. In the hippocampal primary cultures, the longest neurites analyzed are Tau-positive and Map2-negative axons. Neuronal processes were analyzed using Axiovision LE 4.4 software and NeuronJ software (distributed as a plug-in for ImageJ). For each graph, data on neurite length were generated from at least three independent experiments, and more than 100 cells were counted for each experiment except in the case of the siRNA experiments where 50 cells were counted per experiment. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and post hoc Student's t test. For cell fractionation into cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts, PC12 cells were washed twice with PBS, resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) with Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and E64, a cysteine protease inhibitor (1:1000; Sigma). Cells were allowed to swell on ice for 15 min and then homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer. The integrity of nuclei was verified under a light microscope, and the homogenate was layered on 40% sucrose. Nuclei were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 15 min to collect the nuclei (pellet). Supernatants were then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min to separate the cytosol (supernatant) and membrane (pellet) fractions. The protein concentration was determined with the BCA assay (Pierce). 20 mg of the cytosolic and of the membrane fractions were loaded for 12.5% SDS-PAGE. For total cellular protein extracts, cells were scraped in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton, 1 mm EGTA) with Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The protein concentration was determined with the BCA assay (Pierce), and 20 mg of proteins were loaded for 12.5% SDS-PAGE. To determine whether Reg-1α is secreted by neural cells, we freeze-dried the culture medium before analysis to concentrate proteins. For Western blot analysis, SDS-PAGE gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (0.22 μm; Bio-Rad) by standard electroblotting. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight and with secondary antibodies at room temperature for 2 h, and immunolabeling was revealed by chemiluminescence reaction using the ECL Western blot detection reagents. Primary antibodies were rabbit anti-Reg-1α (1:500) (18Laurine E. Grégoire C. Fändrich M. Engemann S. Marchal S. Thion L. Mohr M. Monsarrat B. Michel B. Dobson C.M. Wanker E. Erard M. Verdier J.M.

Secondary antibodies were peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgGs (1:2000; Interchim). PC12 cells were grown and induced to differentiate on glass coverslips coated with rat tail collagen. N2a cells and hippocampal neurons were grown on glass coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine. Cells were fixed in formaldehyde/PBS for 20 min followed by three washes in PBS. Cells were blocked and permeabilized in PBS supplemented with 2% BSA and 0.1% Triton and then incubated at 4 °C with primary antibodies rabbit anti-Reg-1α, goat anti-EXTL3 (R&D Systems), mouse anti-β3-tubulin (Sigma), and sheep anti-TGN38 (AbD Serotec) in the same buffer overnight. Secondary antibodies directed against rabbit or goat IgGs were conjugated, respectively, to Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen) and Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). For epifluorescence imaging, cells were viewed with Leica and Zeiss microscopes, and images were captured with a camera using the Metamorph and Axiovision software programs. For confocal imaging, cells were observed with a Leica TCS4D confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany). Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc., Mountain View, CA). To investigate the function of Reg-1α in neural cells, we first assessed Reg-1α expression in rat PC12 cells, which acquire a neuron-like phenotype upon NGF stimulation, and in mouse N2a cells, a neural crest-derived cell line that has been extensively used to study neuronal differentiation and axonal growth. In these cells, Reg-1α had an apparent molecular mass of 18–20 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 1), similar to that of purified human recombinant Reg-1α (Fig. 1A, lane 2). Although the theoretical molecular mass of Reg-1α is estimated to be 16 kDa, it is known that in SDS-PAGE gels its apparent molecular mass ranges from 16 to 22 kDa due to the presence of O-linked glycans (21De Reggi M. Capon C. Gharib B. Wieruszeski J.M. Michel R. Fournet B. The glycan moiety of human pancreatic lithostathine. Structure characterization and possible pathophysiological implications.Eur. J.

Verdier J.M. Three-dimensional structure of the lithostathine protofibril, a protein involved in Alzheimer's disease.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3313-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), Reg-1α formed dimers (apparent molecular mass, ∼35 kDa) and tetramers (apparent molecular mass, ∼70 kDa) that remained visible also under denaturing electrophoresis conditions (12.5% SDS-PAGE) (Fig. 1B). Immunofluorescence studies in PC12 (Fig. 1C, panels a and e), in N2a cells (Fig. 1C, panel b), and in hippocampal neurons at 2 days in vitro (Fig. 1C, panels c, d, and f) revealed that Reg-1α was mainly localized along the plasma membrane and slightly in the cytosol. Expression was stronger in the perinuclear region (Fig. 1C, panels a, b, and d, arrows) and in neurite membranes, particularly in growth cones (Fig. 1C, panels a, b, and d, arrowheads; panels e and f are higher magnifications of the insets in a and d). Subcellular fractionation confirmed that Reg-1α was mainly localized in the membrane fraction (Fig. 1D, lane 1) with a smaller portion in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 1D, lane 2). The specificity of the polyclonal anti-Reg-1α antibody was assessed previously (17Marchal S. Givalois L. Verdier J.M. Mestre-Frances N.

To investigate the potential effects of Reg-1α on neuronal growth, we transiently transfected PC12 and N2a cells with human full-length Reg-1α and then investigated the effects of Reg-1α overexpression. These cells are considered to be differentiated when neurite length is twice that of the cell body. Reg-1α expression was increased by 40% in PC12 (Fig. 2A) and by 35% in N2a (Fig. 2B) cells without modification of β-actin expression when compared with controls (cells transfected with empty pCMV6-XL5 vector). Reg-1α overexpression significantly increased the number of cells with neurites longer than two cell diameters (about 4-fold) (Fig. 2, C and D, black rectangles) as well as the total neurite length and longest neurite length per cell without modification of the number of neurites per cell (Table 1). Transfection of empty vector or of transfection reagent alone (Amaxa and Lipofectamine) did not have any effect. As Reg-1α is described as a secreted protein in the digestive tract, we then verified whether Reg-1α was secreted by neuronal cells. Our data show (Fig. 2E) that this is the case and that Reg-1α secretion is increased upon transfection, suggesting that Reg-1α could act as an extracellular factor.TABLE 1Effects of Reg-1α overexpression on neurite outgrowth in PC12 and N2a cellsTransfection reagentpCMV6-XL5pCMV6-XL5-Reg-1αPC12 cellsTotal neurite length per cell (μm)33.5 ± 330.5 ± 338.5 ± 1.8aIndicates significant differences from controls (Student's t test, p < 0.05).Longest neurite length per cell (μm)47.8 ± 5.645.9 ± 562.1 ± 4aIndicates significant differences from controls (Student's t test, p < 0.05).Neurites per cell1.8 ± 0.181.7 ± 0.192 ± 0.12N2a cellsTotal neurite length per cell (μm)22.7 ± 1.622.9 ± 2.539.5 ± 3.2aIndicates significant differences from controls (Student's t test, p < 0.05).Longest neurite length per cell (μm)21.1 ± 1.321.6 ± 1.630.7 ± 1.8aIndicates significant differences from controls (Student's t test, p < 0.05).Neurites per cell1.04 ± 0.041.2 ± 0.11.3 ± 0.08a Indicates significant differences from controls (Student's t test, p < 0.05). Open table in a new tab To test this hypothesis, we incubated PC12, N2a, and primary hippocampal cells with 10−7 m human recombinant Reg-1α for 48 h and assessed its effect on neurite elongation. The concentration used was chosen based on studies in pancreatic cell lines by Kobayashi et al. (10Kobayashi S. Akiyama T. Nata K. Abe M. Tajima M. Shervani N.J. Unno M. Matsuno S. Sasaki H.

The duration of treatment corresponded to the time needed to observe neurite outgrowth in NGF-treated PC12 cells and in N2a cells grown on poly-d-lysine. As with overexpression of Reg-1α, addition of Reg-1α clearly increased the number of cells with longer neurites (Fig. 3A for N2a cells). Quantitative analysis of the effects of recombinant Reg-1α (Fig. 3B) showed a 2- and 6-fold increase in the percentage of PC12 (left panel) and N2a (right panel) cells with longer neurites in comparison with untreated controls. To describe in detail the positive effect of Reg-1α on neurite outgrowth, the total neurite length, length of the longest neurite, and number of neurites per cell were quantified in PC12 (Fig. 4, A–C) and N2a (Fig. 4, D–F) cells. In primary hippocampal neurons, we measured specifically the length of the longest neurite, which represents the axon in this experimental condition, and the number of neurites per cell (Fig. 4, G and H). Both the total neurite length per cell and the length of the longest neurite were increased in Reg-1α-treated cells in comparison with untreated cells (Fig. 4, A, B,"

Here we report that stimulation of DR4 and/or DR5 by the agonistic protein KD548-Fc, an Fc-fused DR4/DR5 dual-specific Kringle domain variant, activates plasma membrane-associated Nox1 NADPH oxidase to generate superoxide anion and subsequently accumulates intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to sustained c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation and eventual apoptotic cell death in human HeLa and Jurkat tumor cells. KD548-Fc treatment induces the formation of a DR4/DR5 signaling complex containing riboflavin kinase (RFK), Nox1, the Nox1 subunits (Rac1, Noxo1, and Noxa1), TNF receptor-associated death domain (TRADD), and TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2). Depletion of RFK, but not the Nox1 subunits, TRADD and TRAF2, failed to recruit Nox1 and Rac1 to DR4 and DR5, demonstrating that RFK plays an essential role in linking DR4/DR5 with Nox1.

Apo2L) receptors, death receptors 4 (DR4, TRAIL-R1) and 5 (DR5, TRAIL-R2), are members of the DR family and are attractive anti-cancer targets because their stimulation with the cognate ligand TRAIL induces apoptosis in various tumor cells without significant cytotoxicity on normal cells (1Pennarun B. Meijer A. de Vries E.G. Kleibeuker J.H. Kruyt F. de Jong S. Playing the DISC. Turning on TRAIL death receptor-mediated apoptosis in cancer.Biochim. Biophys.

Immunol. 2009; 10: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The additional TRAIL membrane receptors, death decoy receptor 1 (DcR1, TRAIL-R3) and DcR2 (TRAIL-R4), also bind to TRAIL but cannot induce apoptosis due to a lack of fully functional intracellular death domain (DD) (1Pennarun B. Meijer A. de Vries E.G. Kleibeuker J.H. Kruyt F. de Jong S. Playing the DISC. Turning on TRAIL death receptor-mediated apoptosis in cancer.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1805: 123-140PubMed Google Scholar). Currently, many agonists against DR4 and/or DR5, including recombinant TRAIL and receptor-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), are in various stages of clinical trials for cancer therapy (1Pennarun B. Meijer A. de Vries E.G. Kleibeuker J.H. Kruyt F. de Jong S. Playing the DISC. Turning on TRAIL death receptor-mediated apoptosis in cancer.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1805: 123-140PubMed Google Scholar).Like other DRs, such as TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) and CD95 (Fas), the cytoplasmic DD of DR4 and DR5 (DR4/DR5) acts as a docking site for intracellular adaptor proteins for downstream signaling (2Wilson N.S. Dixit V. Ashkenazi A. Death receptor signal transducers. Nodes of coordination in immune signaling networks.Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 3Park H.H. Structural analyses of death domains and their interactions.Apoptosis. 2011; 16: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Activation of DR4/DR5 by homotrimeric TRAIL results in the oligomerization of the intracellular DD to recruit the primary adaptor protein Fas-associated DD (FADD) via homotypic interactions between the DDs and then caspase-8/-10, forming the so-called death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) (4Kischkel F.C. Lawrence D.A. Chuntharapai A. Schow P. Kim K.J. Ashkenazi A.

Activated caspase-8/10 in DISC directly or indirectly activate effector caspases, such as caspase-3/6/7, triggering caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death (1Pennarun B. Meijer A. de Vries E.G. Kleibeuker J.H. Kruyt F. de Jong S. Playing the DISC. Turning on TRAIL death receptor-mediated apoptosis in cancer.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1805: 123-140PubMed Google Scholar). Activated CD95 also forms the DISC at the intracellular DD to trigger mainly caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death (2Wilson N.S. Dixit V. Ashkenazi A. Death receptor signal transducers. Nodes of coordination in immune signaling networks.Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). However, TNFα-bound TNFR1 primarily recruits TNFR-associated death domain (TRADD), rather than FADD, via homotypic DD interactions and then other second adaptor molecules, mediating mainly proinflammatory and necrotic cell death signaling (2Wilson N.S. Dixit V. Ashkenazi A. Death receptor signal transducers. Nodes of coordination in immune signaling networks.Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Thus, depending on which adaptor protein binds to the DDs of activated DRs, the outcome of the downstream signaling varies. However, the structural and molecular mechanism(s) by which the DDs of DRs distinguish the respective primary adaptor protein is not clear yet.Reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide anion (O2̇̄) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), are known to induce a wide range of responses, depending on the cell types and ROS levels within the cell, including apoptotic and necrotic cell death (6Shen H.M. Pervaiz S. TNF receptor superfamily-induced cell death. Redox-dependent execution.FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Stimulation of TNFR1, CD95, and DR4/DR5 generate intracellular ROS, the major source of which is mitochondria (6Shen H.M. Pervaiz S. TNF receptor superfamily-induced cell death.

The external cell death stimuli mediated by the DRs cause uncoupling of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and/or collapse of the mitochondrial outer membrane potential, producing intracellular ROS (6Shen H.M.

For an additional source of ROS, however, recent studies have shown that TNFR1 and CD95 can activate plasma membrane-associated NADPH oxidases (Nox enzymes) to generate superoxide anion and eventually accumulate intracellular ROS (9Kim Y.S.

Receptor activation of NADPH oxidases.Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2010; 13: 467-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). NADPH oxidase activity is controlled by regulatory subunits, including the cytosolic subunits of Rac1, Noxo1, and Noxa1 and membrane-bound p22phox for Nox1 to -3 (12Petry A. Weitnauer M. Görlach A.

Roles in cellular stress response, stress tolerance, and tissue repair.Pharmacol. Rev. 2011; 63: 218-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). TNFα-induced activation of Nox1 is mediated by recruiting riboflavin kinase (RFK) to TNFR1 (14Yazdanpanah B. Wiegmann K. Tchikov V. Krut O. Pongratz C. Schramm M. Kleinridders A. Wunderlich T.

RFK is a cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of riboflavin to form flavin mononucleotide (FMN), a precursor to FAD (15Karthikeyan S. Zhou Q. Mseeh F. Grishin N.V. Osterman A.L.

There have been no reports yet for DR4/DR5-mediated RFK recruiting or Nox activation.Recently, we have developed the Kringle domain (KD) scaffold based on the KD2 of human plasminogen as an antibody surrogate (16Lee C.H.

From a KD synthetic library on the yeast cell surface, we isolated a variant, KD548, with DR4/DR5 dual-specific binding activity (16Lee C.H. Park K.J. Sung E.S. Kim A. Choi J.D. Kim J.S. Kim S.H.

The Fc-fused form in its C terminus, KD548-Fc (Fig. 1A), induced cell death in several cancer cell lines in vitro and suppressed tumor growth in xenograft mouse models even for TRAIL-resistant cells (16Lee C.H. Park K.J. Sung E.S. Kim A. Choi J.D. Kim J.S. Kim S.H. Kwon M.H. Kim Y.S. Engineering of a human kringle domain into agonistic and antagonistic binding proteins functioning in vitro and in vivo.Proc.

However, the detailed cell death mechanism of KD548-Fc has not been reported yet.In the present work, we demonstrate that DR4/DR5-specific KD548-Fc induces apoptotic cell death via the ROS-dependent sustained c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation pathway without caspase activation in HeLa and Jurkat cells. We found that KD548-Fc-induced ROS accumulation resulted from superoxide anion generation from Nox1 NADPH oxidase, which was mediated by the formation of a KD548-Fc-induced DR4/DR5-signaling complex containing RFK, Nox1, Rac1, TRADD, and TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2). RFK is an essential component in linking DR4/DR5 with Nox1. We have identified RFK-binding regions within the DDs of DR4/DR5 by mapping the intracellular domains. Our results provide a new signaling pathway of DR4/DR5, directly activating Nox1 via RFK, which is distinct from conventional DISC-mediated apoptosis.DISCUSSIONConventionally activated DR4 and DR5, in response to the cognate ligand TRAIL or agonistic mAbs, form the canonical DISC, which activates initiator caspase-8/10 and then effector caspase-3/6/7, triggering apoptosis in various tumor cells (1Pennarun B. Meijer A. de Vries E.G. Kleibeuker J.H. Kruyt F. de Jong S. Playing the DISC. Turning on TRAIL death receptor-mediated apoptosis in cancer.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1805: 123-140PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that KD548-Fc-stimulated DR4/DR5 activate plasma membrane-associated Nox1 NADPH oxidase to generate superoxide anion by forming a unique signaling complex, including RFK, Nox1, the Nox1 cytosolic subunits (Rac1, Noxo1, and Noxa1), TRADD, and TRAF2. The signaling complex was formed within 30 min after cells were treated with KD548-Fc, coincident with the O2̇̄ generation. Although other Nox enzymes, such as Nox2, Nox3, and Nox4, are expressed in HeLa and HCT116 cells, our data suggest that only Nox1 is activated by KD548-Fc-mediated DR4/DR5 stimulation in the cells. Nox1 knockdown substantially abolished intracellular ROS accumulation, suggesting that O2̇̄ generated outside the cells is the main source of ROS by conversion into plasma membrane-permeable ROS species, such as H2O2 (9Kim Y.S.

Cell. 2007; 26: 675-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Our data also suggest that the Nox1-mediated ROS accumulation is responsible for sustained JNK activation-dependent apoptotic cell death in response to KD548-Fc.Nox1 recruitment to the intracellular DDs of DR4/DR5 seems to be directly mediated by the adaptor protein RFK rather than the Nox1 cytosolic subunits, like in the case of RFK-mediated linking of TNFR1 with Nox1 (14Yazdanpanah B.

In the RFK-deficient HeLashRFK cells, KD548-Fc-induced ROS accumulation, sustained JNK activation, and apoptotic cell death were dramatically inhibited, supporting the essential role of RFK in the DR4/DR5-mediated Nox1 activation. TRADD knockdown did not prevent the recruitment of RFK, Nox1, and Rac1 to KD548-Fc-stimulated DR4/DR5, but it substantially attenuated ROS accumulation, sustained JNK activation, and apoptotic cell death in HeLa cells. These results are similar to the role of TRADD in TNFα-induced Nox1 activation in mouse and human cells, where TRADD was dispensable in the formation of the TNFα-induced signaling complex of TNFR1-RFK-Nox1 (14Yazdanpanah B. Wiegmann K. Tchikov V. Krut O. Pongratz C. Schramm M. Kleinridders A. Wunderlich T. Kashkar H. Utermöhlen O. Brüning J.C. Schütze S. Krönke M.

Cell. 2007; 26: 675-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). In the study with recombinantly purified proteins, TRADD improved ∼5-fold the interactions of RFK with the DDs of DR4/DR5, suggesting that the ternary complex of DR4/DR5-DD·TRADD·RFK is more stable than binary complexes consisting of two of the three molecules. These data suggest that RFK can physically and functionally couple KD548-Fc-stimulated DR4/DR5 to Nox1, the complex of which is stabilized by TRADD, enhancing the activity of RFK and/or Nox1. TRAF2 played a negligible role in the formation of the KD548-Fc-induced signaling complex and subsequent downstream signaling. TRADD contains an N-terminal TRAF2-binding domain and a C-terminal DD interacting with other DDs (24Kieser A. Pursuing different “TRADDes”. TRADD signaling induced by TNF receptor 1 and the Epstein-Barr virus oncoprotein LMP1.Biol. Chem. 2008; 389: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S6C). Thus, it seems that TRAF2 is recruited to the activated complex indirectly via the adaptor protein TRADD, but its effect on the downstream signaling is not clear at this point.Our results suggest that KD548-Fc-stimulated DR4/DR5 simultaneously interacts with RFK and TRADD via the DDs. The DD is a homotypic protein interaction module composed of a bundle of six α-helices, the tertiary structures of which are closely superimposed despite the low sequence homology below 30% (3Park H.H. Structural analyses of death domains and their interactions.Apoptosis. 2011; 16: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The DDs of DR5 and DR4 share ∼63% identity with each other (supplemental Fig. S6B), indicative of their redundant functions. Our data have shown that the DR4RFK and DR5RFK regions, structurally equivalent to the RFK-binding regions of the DD of TNFR1 (TNFR1RFK) (14Yazdanpanah B. Wiegmann K. Tchikov V. Krut O. Pongratz C.

The RFK has 6-stranded antiparallel β-barrel structures (15Karthikeyan S. Zhou Q. Mseeh F. Grishin N.V. Osterman A.L. Zhang H.

Accordingly, the DDs of DR4/DR5 have a capability to interact heterotypically with RFK, like the interactions of TNFR1-DD with RFK (14Yazdanpanah B. Wiegmann K. Tchikov V. Krut O. Pongratz C. Schramm M. Kleinridders A. Wunderlich T. Kashkar H. Utermöhlen O. Brüning J.C. Schütze S. Krönke M.

Ashkenazi A. Death receptor signal transducers. Nodes of coordination in immune signaling networks.Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), KD548-Fc-stimulated DR4/DR5 interact with TRADD through the homotypic DD interactions. Previous reports have also shown that DR4 and/or DR5 interact directly with TRADD rather than FADD (18Park K.J. Lee S.H. Kim T.I. Lee H.W. Lee C.H. Kim E.H. Jang J.Y. Choi K.S. Kwon M.H. Kim Y.S.

The role of TRADD in TRAIL-induced apoptosis and signaling.FASEB J. 2011; 25: 1353-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).The question is how TRAIL and KD548-Fc recruit different signaling adaptors to the same DDs of DR4/DR5. We hypothesize two possible reasons: different binding regions and valency between TRAIL and KD548-Fc. KD548-Fc recognizes partially overlapping but different extracellular regions of DR5 and DR4 from those of TRAIL. Recently, we reported that the KD548 single domain without Fc fusion has bivalent binding ability, with each binding site possessing independent DR4/DR5 dual-specific binding ability (17Lee C.H. Park K.J. Kim S.J. Kwon O. Jeong K.J. Kim A. Kim Y.S. Generation of bivalent and bispecific kringle single domains by loop grafting as potent agonists against death receptors 4 and 5.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 411: 201-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Thus, homodimeric KD548-Fc has tetravalent binding sites, each site of which has DR4/DR5 dual binding specificity. Tetravalent KD548-Fc might induce higher oligomeric states of DR4/DR5 than those induced by homotrimeric TRAIL. The higher valency and distinct binding sites of KD548-Fc from those of TRAIL raise the possibility that KD548-Fc induces a distinct conformation and/or oligomeric states in the intracellular DDs of DR4/DR5, which may provide preferential binding surfaces to RFK and TRADD over the primary adaptor FADD of TRAIL. Thus, it seems that, depending on the external stimuli, the DD of activated DR4 and/or DR5 may adopt distinct conformations, which provide preferential interaction sites for the adaptor proteins, such as FADD, TRADD, and/or RFK.ROS play a critical role in apoptotic and necrotic cell death by oxidatively damaging many molecular targets and thus affecting various signaling cascades (6Shen H.M. Pervaiz S. TNF receptor superfamily-induced cell death. Redox-dependent execution.FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 7Morgan M.J. Liu Z.G. Reactive oxygen species in TNFα-induced signaling and cell death.Mol. Cells. 2010; 30: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). One of the prominent effects of ROS is the direct activation of JNK and then sustaining the activation by inhibiting mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases (28Kamata H. Honda S. Maeda S.

Interestingly, in the sustained JNK activation-dependent cell death induced by Nox1-mediated ROS, TNFα induces necrotic cell death (9Kim Y.S. Morgan M.J. Choksi S. Liu Z.G.

Cell. 2007; 26: 675-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), whereas DR4/DR5-specific KD548-Fc induces apoptotic cell death, like CD95-mediated apoptosis (10Reinehr R.

The apoptotic morphological features of dying cells caused by exposure to KD548-Fc and little effects of the necrosis inhibitor necrostatin-1 and autophagy inhibitors (3-methyladenine and chloroquine) on KD54-Fc-induced cell death exclude necrosis and autophagy as the primary cell death mechanisms of KD548-Fc. In good agreement with our results, ROS-mediated sustained JNK activation was responsible for the caspase-independent apoptotic cell death of Jurkat cells mediated by an agonistic mAb against DR5 (20Chen C.

Another pentameric form of CRP, which exists at acidic pH, displays binding activity for oxidized LDL (ox-LDL). The ox-LDL-binding site in CRP, which is hidden at physiological pH, is exposed by acidic pH-induced structural changes in pentameric CRP. The aim of this study was to expose the hidden ox-LDL-binding site of CRP by site-directed mutagenesis and to generate a CRP mutant that can bind to ox-LDL without the requirement of acidic pH. Mutation of Glu(42), an amino acid that participates in intersubunit interactions in the CRP pentamer and is buried, to Gln resulted in a CRP mutant (E42Q) that showed significant binding activity for ox-LDL at physiological pH. For maximal binding to ox-LDL, E42Q CRP required a pH much less acidic than that required by wild-type CRP. At any given pH, E42Q CRP was more efficient than wild-type CRP in binding to ox-LDL. Like wild-type CRP, E42Q CRP remained pentameric at acidic pH. Also, E42Q CRP was more efficient than wild-type CRP in binding to several other deposited, conformationally altered proteins. The E42Q CRP mutant provides a tool to investigate the functions of CRP in defined animal models of inflammatory diseases including atherosclerosis because wild-type CRP requires acidic pH to bind to deposited, conformationally altered proteins, including ox-LDL, and available animal models may not have sufficient acidosis or other possible modifiers of the pentameric structure of CRP at the sites of inflammation."

Although AMPK has been implicated in contraction-induced GLUT4 and CD36 translocation in cardiomyocytes, the precise role of PKD1 in these processes is not known. To study this, we triggered contractions in cardiomyocytes by electric field stimulation (EFS). First, the role of PKD1 in GLUT4 and CD36 translocation was defined. In PKD1 siRNA-treated cardiomyocytes as well as cardiomyocytes from PKD1 knock-out mice, EFS-induced translocation of GLUT4, but not CD36, was abolished. In AMPK siRNA-treated cardiomyocytes and cardiomyocytes from AMPKα2 knock-out mice, both GLUT4 and CD36 translocation were abrogated. Hence, unlike AMPK, PKD1 is selectively involved in glucose uptake. Second, we analyzed upstream factors in PKD1 activation. Cardiomyocyte contractions enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Using ROS scavengers, we found that PKD1 signaling and glucose uptake are more sensitive to changes in intracellular ROS than AMPK signaling or LCFA uptake. Furthermore, silencing of death-activated protein kinase (DAPK) abrogated EFS-induced GLUT4 but not CD36 translocation. Finally, possible links between PKD1 and AMPK signaling were investigated. PKD1 silencing did not affect AMPK activation. Reciprocally, AMPK silencing did not alter PKD1 activation.

https://openalex.org/W2019518199,"Most ATP binding cassette (ABC) proteins are pumps that transport substrates across biological membranes using the energy of ATP hydrolysis. Functional ABC proteins have two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) that bind and hydrolyze ATP, but the molecular mechanism of nucleotide hydrolysis is unresolved. This is due in part to the limited kinetic information on NBD association and dissociation. Here, we show dimerization of a catalytically active NBD and follow in real time the association and dissociation of NBDs from the changes in fluorescence emission of a tryptophan strategically located at the center of the dimer interface. Spectroscopic and structural studies demonstrated that the tryptophan can be used as dimerization probe, and we showed that under hydrolysis conditions (millimolar MgATP), not only the dimer dissociation rate increases, but also the dimerization rate. Neither dimer formation or dissociation are clearly favored, and the end result is a dynamic equilibrium where the concentrations of monomer and dimer are very similar. We proposed that based on their variable rates of hydrolysis, the rate-limiting step of the hydrolysis cycle may differ among full-length ABC proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2091460376,"Botulinum neurotoxin, the causative agent of the paralytic disease botulism, is an endopeptidase composed of a catalytic domain (or light chain (LC)) and a heavy chain (HC) encompassing the translocation domain (TD) and receptor-binding domain. Upon receptor-mediated endocytosis, the LC and TD are proposed to undergo conformational changes in the acidic endocytic environment resulting in the formation of an LC protein-conducting TD channel. The mechanism of channel formation and the conformational changes in the toxin upon acidification are important but less well understood aspects of botulinum neurotoxin intoxication. Here, we have identified a minimum channel-forming truncation of the TD, the ""beltless"" TD, that forms transmembrane channels with ion conduction properties similar to those of the full-length TD. At variance with the holotoxin and the HC, channel formation for both the TD and the beltless TD occurs independent of a transmembrane pH gradient. Furthermore, acidification in solution induces moderate secondary structure changes. The subtle nature of the conformational changes evoked by acidification on the TD suggests that, in the context of the holotoxin, larger structural rearrangements and LC unfolding occur preceding or concurrent to channel formation. This notion is consistent with the hypothesis that although each domain of the holotoxin functions individually, each domain serves as a chaperone for the others."
https://openalex.org/W1966531870,"To elucidate the actions of Draper, a receptor responsible for the phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells in Drosophila, we isolated proteins that bind to the extracellular region of Draper using affinity chromatography. One of those proteins has been identified to be an uncharacterized protein called Drosophila melanogaster calcium-binding protein 1 (DmCaBP1). This protein containing the thioredoxin-like domain resided in the endoplasmic reticulum and seemed to be expressed ubiquitously throughout the development of Drosophila. DmCaBP1 was externalized without truncation after the induction of apoptosis somewhat prior to chromatin condensation and DNA cleavage in a manner dependent on the activity of caspases. A recombinant DmCaBP1 protein bound to both apoptotic cells and a hemocyte-derived cell line expressing Draper. Forced expression of DmCaBP1 at the cell surface made non-apoptotic cells susceptible to phagocytosis. Flies deficient in DmCaBP1 expression developed normally and showed Draper-mediated pruning of larval axons, but a defect in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells in embryos was observed. Loss of Pretaporter, a previously identified ligand for Draper, did not cause a further decrease in the level of phagocytosis in DmCaBP1-lacking embryos. These results collectively suggest that the endoplasmic reticulum protein DmCaBP1 is externalized upon the induction of apoptosis and serves as a tethering molecule to connect apoptotic cells and phagocytes for effective phagocytosis to occur."

The more indolent PTCs are associated with radiation-induced RET/PTC oncogenes that encode fusions of the RET receptor kinase domain with one of several different dimerizing proteins, resulting in a constitutively active kinase (9Caudill C.M.

Conversely, the more aggressive and poorly differentiated FDTCs, expressing oncogenic RAS or BRAF point mutations, are characterized by tumor-promoting immune responses such as the infiltration of immunosuppressive macrophages (22Ryder M. Ghossein R.A. Ricarte-Filho J.C. Knauf J.A. Fagin J.A. Increased density of tumor-associated macrophages is associated with decreased survival in advanced thyroid cancer.Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2008; 15: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Although the mechanistic basis for RET/PTC-induced immunostimulation is currently unclear, it is thought to involve members of both the classical and alternative pathways of NF-κB through the stabilization of NIK kinase (23Neely R.J. Brose M.S. Gray C.M. McCorkell K.A. Leibowitz J.M. Ma C. Rothstein J.L. May M.J.

Engiles J.B. Rothstein J.L. Proinflammatory mediators and genetic background in oncogene-mediated tumor progression.J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 4059-4067Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Because RET/PTC oncoproteins activate RAS/BRAF/MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT, and NF-κB signal transduction pathways, this tumor type might be expected to be highly proliferative and readily progress to a less differentiated cancer such as anaplastic carcinoma. However, RET/PTC-expressing PTCs tend to be rather indolent, and expression in poorly differentiated and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas is rare (26Ricarte-Filho J.C. Ryder M. Chitale D.A. Rivera M. Heguy A. Ladanyi M. Janakiraman M. Solit D. Knauf J.A. Tuttle R.M. Ghossein R.A. Fagin J.A.

Thus, in the case of PTC, one interpretation of this process is that the additional immunostimulatory program is detrimental to the progressing tumor. To resolve this conundrum, our primary goal was to determine whether proinflammatory cytokine release and cellular transformation proceed along the same signaling pathways or whether the two processes are functionally distinct and separable. The latter would permit investigation of whether the RET/PTC-induced proinflammatory program is necessary for transforming events as well as exploration of the mechanistic link between RET/PTC expression and NF-κB activation. The results of our investigations provide insight into the early stages of thyroid oncogenesis that could influence future approaches to the treatment of all types of FDTC. All cell culture and chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma unless stated otherwise. mRP3.51 (RP3) was previously constructed and cloned into a bacterial expression vector (27Powell Jr., D.J. Eisenlohr L.C. Rothstein J.L. A thyroid tumor-specific antigen formed by the fusion of two self-proteins.J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 861-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To perform the following studies, RP3 was excised from the pET29a vector and cloned into the mammalian expression vectors Rc/CMV and MSCV.IRES.GFP. A Kozak consensus and a TAA stop sequence were placed 5′ and 3′ of the RP3 cDNA. All RP3 mutants were created by site-directed mutagenesis using QuikChange II (Stratagene) according to manufacturer's instructions. MSCV.IRES.mRFP was created by excising the GFP sequence and replacing it with the sequence for monomeric RFP. The sequences encoding TRAF2- and TRAF6-blocking peptides (T2pep and T6pep) and control peptides (T2cntl and T6cntl) were synthesized by IDT, amplified by PCR, and cloned into MSCV.IRES.mRFP. TPC-1 and PCCL3 cells were kindly provided previously by Dr. Massimo Santoro. NIH-3T3 (kindly provided by Dr. Tschiclis, Tufts University), 293T (ATCC), and TPC-1 cell lines were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS (D10). The rat PCCL3 thyroid cell line was maintained in F-12 media containing 5 × 10−3 IU/ml bovine TSH, 5 μg/ml bovine insulin, 10 ng/ml Gly-His-Lys, 10 ng/ml somatostatin, 5 μg/ml apotransferrin, 10 nm hydrocortisone, and 10% FBS (F-12+). PCCL3 cells require TSH for cell growth under basal conditions and exhibit TSH-independent growth upon expression of RET/PTC. However, because removing TSH can alter the ability of thyrocytes to produce inflammatory cytokines (28Kasai K. Banba N. Motohashi S. Hattori Y. Manaka K. Shimoda S.I.

For all experiments, PCCL3 cells were treated in a 1:1 ratio of F-12 media and D10. All cells were maintained in a 37 °C incubator at 9% CO2. Retrovirus was prepared by co-transfecting 293T cells with pCL-Eco and indicated MSCV.IRES.GFP or MSCV.IRES.mRFP constructs with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). At 24 h post-transfection, fresh medium was replaced, and viral supernatant was collected at 24, 48, and 72 h. For viral transduction, cells were plated at 5 × 104 cells/well in 6-well plates and treated with pre-filtered viral supernatant diluted 1:2 in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 8 μg/ml Polybrene. At 24 h post-transduction, viral supernatant was replaced with fresh 10% media and sorted for GFP or monomeric RFP expression on day 3. NIH-3T3 transductants were maintained in D10, and all PCCL3 transductants were maintained in 1:5 ratio of F12+/D10. TSH, insulin, Gly-His-Lys, somatostatin, apotransferrin, and hydrocortisone were all from Sigma. U0126 (Cell Signaling Technology) was chosen based on its high selectivity to both MEK1 and MEK2 (versus PD098059 which inhibits MEK1) and used at 10 μm at all indicated times based on previously published results (31Favata M.F.

For cytokine analysis of PCCL3 cells, 105 cells/well were plated in 6-well tissue culture plates. The next day cells were transfected with GeneJuice (EMD Chemicals) at a 3:3 ratio of reagent (μl)/DNA (μg). After 48 h, total RNA (Machery & Nagel) or cytosolic protein was harvested for RT-PCR or Western analysis. For TRAF knockdown of TPC cells, TRAF2 siRNA and TRAF6 siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were transfected at 25 nm with siRNAMAX (Invitrogen) and on day 2 harvested for ELISA, RT-PCR, or Western analysis or subsequently treated and harvested on day 4 as indicated. Total RNA was extracted using the Nucleospin RNA II kit (Macherey & Nagel). Reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed on 0.5–2 μg of total RNA using Superscript II (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed for 30 cycles at 60 °C. All cells were lysed with 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.2, containing 1× HALT protease inhibitors with EDTA (Pierce) and 1× HALT phosphatase inhibitors (Pierce). Lysates were quantified using BCA kit (Pierce). Pre-cleared 500 μg of total protein was incubated overnight with anti-RET antibody and protein G-Sepharose beads (Pierce). Subsequently, beads were washed with cell lysis buffer three times and eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.7. Eluted material was neutralized with 1 m Tris, pH 8.8, combined with 6× loading buffer, and run on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. 10 μg of total protein was loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were blotted for 1 h at 100 V onto nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare) and blocked for 30 min with 5% milk/TBS + 0.1% Tween. All blots were incubated overnight with the indicated antibody, washed, and stained with anti-rabbit HRP (Cell Signaling), donkey anti-mouse HRP, or donkey anti-goat HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch). All indicated antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology, except for anti-phospho-RET (1062), anti-RET (C-20), and anti-TRAF6 (H274) that were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. A 96-well Maxisorp plate (Millipore) was coated at 2 μg/ml with anti-CCL2 antibody (eBioscience) overnight 4 °C. The plate was blocked with 1% BSA/PBS, and cell culture supernatants were incubated in duplicate wells overnight at 4 °C. The next day, plates were washed with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with biotinylated anti-CCL2 antibody (eBioscience) for 2 h at 27 °C and washed, stained with 1:1000 streptavidin-HRP (BD Bioscience) for 1 h at 27 °C, developed with 2 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma) according to manufacturer's instructions, and visualized at 405 nm in a spectrophotometer (Victor2 by Wallac 1420 multilabel counter). PCCL3 and TPC-1 transductants were cultured in triplicate at 1000 cells per well in 96-well flat bottom plates in D10 media in the absence of hormones. Viable cells were counted daily by trypan blue exclusion. 5 × 103 stable GFP-expressing NIH-3T3 lines were suspended in 0.25% agarose in 1× MEM + 10% FBS with 1× penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) and 1× gentamicin (Invitrogen) and plated in triplicate over a layer of pre-set 0.5% agarose in 1× MEM + 10% FBS with 1× penicillin/streptomycin and 1× gentamicin in 6-well plates. 20 days after plating, the cells were photographed and analyzed for colony number and size or stained for 1 h at 27 °C with crystal violet in PBS and photographed over a light box. For quantification of colony size, five photographs were taken per well using a Nikon Eclipse TE 2000-U camera attached to a confocal microscope. One photograph/1-cm2 block was taken using a grid that was partitioned in 1-cm2 sections. The longest length of the colonies was measured in micrometers using the NIS Elements Version 2.3 program. The sum of the number and length of the colonies was calculated per well, and the mean ± S.D. of triplicate wells was calculated per condition (total of 15 photographs taken per condition). Both RP1 and RP3 activate similar oncogenic and inflammatory programs (14Borrello M.G. Alberti L. Fischer A. Degl'innocenti D. Ferrario C. Gariboldi M. Marchesi F. Allavena P. Greco A. Collini P.

Therefore, we utilized an immortalized rat thyroid cell line, PCCL3, transiently transfected with RP3 to examine early activation of proinflammatory cytokine transcription. Early phase induction occurs within the first 48 h of expression and drives ectopic production of MCP1 in abundant quantities and IL6 to a lesser extent (34Puxeddu E. Knauf J.A. Sartor M.A. Mitsutake N. Smith E.P. Medvedovic M. Tomlinson C.R. Moretti S. Fagin J.A. RET/PTC-induced gene expression in thyroid PCCL3 cells reveals early activation of genes involved in regulation of the immune response.Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2005; 12: 319-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To determine whether this early cytokine induction is dependent upon PI3K/AKT or MEK/ERK signaling, PCCL3 cells were transfected with the highly related mouse homologue of RP3 (RP3WT) and treated with selective pathway inhibitors. As demonstrated in Fig. 1A, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (LY) or the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 (U0) did not disrupt early transcriptional induction of MCP1 or IL6 by RP3. As a control for protein expression, RP3K284M, which is devoid of all kinase activity (37Iavarone C. Acunzo M. Carlomagno F. Catania A. Melillo R.M. Carlomagno S.M. Santoro M. Chiariello M.

Furthermore, RP3-transfected cells treated with LY or U0 and cells transfected with RP3K284M exhibited less cell scattering, indicative of increased cell mobilization and less transformation when phenotypically compared with cells transfected with RP3WT (supplemental Fig. S1A). The inhibition of DUSP6 induction by U0 and activation of the sodium iodide symporter expression by U0 and LY, demonstrate that the inhibitors were effective at disrupting their respective pathways (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, Western blot analysis revealed that treatments with LY and U0 led to a dramatic decrease in phosphorylation of AKT and ERK, respectively (Fig. 1B). Similar experiments were then performed to determine the influence of the AKT and ERK pathways on late phase cytokine expression. After long term expression in thyrocytes, RET/PTC induces a milieu of proinflammatory cytokines that include MCP1, IL6, IL8, TNFα, IL1α, IL1β, CXCL10, M-CSF, and GM-CSF (14Borrello M.G. Alberti L.

The TPC-1 cells line is derived from human papillary thyroid carcinoma, constitutively expresses RP1, and produces these same proinflammatory cytokines. TPC-1 cells treated with LY or U0 exhibited no loss of MCP1, IL6, and TNFα transcript production after 48 h (Fig. 1C). In fact, it appears that inhibition of ERK activity actually increases cytokine transcription. This phenomenon was also observed at the protein level (supplemental Fig. S1C), suggesting that a potential negative feedback"

Axon extension is guided and regulated by highly coordinated cytoskeletal dynamics. Here we demonstrate that in hippocampal neurons, the actin-binding protein caldesmon accumulates in distal axons, and its N-terminal interaction with myosin II enhances axon extension. In cortical neural progenitor cells, caldesmon knockdown suppresses axon extension and neuronal polarity. These results indicate that caldesmon is an important regulator of axon development."
