https://openalex.org/W2602180809,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that uniquely functions as an ion channel. Here, we present a 3.9 Å structure of dephosphorylated human CFTR without nucleotides, determined by electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM). Close resemblance of this human CFTR structure to zebrafish CFTR under identical conditions reinforces its relevance for understanding CFTR function. The human CFTR structure reveals a previously unresolved helix belonging to the R domain docked inside the intracellular vestibule, precluding channel opening. By analyzing the sigmoid time course of CFTR current activation, we propose that PKA phosphorylation of the R domain is enabled by its infrequent spontaneous disengagement, which also explains residual ATPase and gating activity of dephosphorylated CFTR. From comparison with MRP1, a feature distinguishing CFTR from all other ABC transporters is the helix-loop transition in transmembrane helix 8, which likely forms the structural basis for CFTR’s channel function."

Here, we have combined whole-mount immunostaining, 3DISCO clearing, and light-sheet imaging to start building a 3D cellular map of the human development during the first trimester of gestation. We provide high-resolution 3D images of the developing peripheral nervous, muscular, vascular, cardiopulmonary, and urogenital systems. We found that the adult-like pattern of skin innervation is established before the end of the first trimester, showing important intra- and inter-individual variations in nerve branches. We also present evidence for a differential vascularization of the male and female genital tracts concomitant with sex determination. This work paves the way for a cellular and molecular reference atlas of human cells, which will be of paramount importance to understanding human development in health and disease.PaperClip/cms/asset/8dcf982a-7440-4a6d-87b8-b33fa9295e04/mmc9.mp3Loading ...(mp3, 4.81 MB) Download audio"
https://openalex.org/W2601226883,"Genetic conflict between viruses and their hosts drives evolution and genetic innovation. Prokaryotes evolved CRISPR-mediated adaptive immune systems for protection from viral infection, and viruses have evolved diverse anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins that subvert these immune systems. The adaptive immune system in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (type I-F) relies on a 350 kDa CRISPR RNA (crRNA)-guided surveillance complex (Csy complex) to bind foreign DNA and recruit a trans-acting nuclease for target degradation. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the Csy complex bound to two different Acr proteins, AcrF1 and AcrF2, at an average resolution of 3.4 Å. The structure explains the molecular mechanism for immune system suppression, and structure-guided mutations show that the Acr proteins bind to residues essential for crRNA-mediated detection of DNA. Collectively, these data provide a snapshot of an ongoing molecular arms race between viral suppressors and the immune system they target."
https://openalex.org/W2602990311,"A T cell mounts an immune response by measuring the binding strength of its T cell receptor (TCR) for peptide-loaded MHCs (pMHC) on an antigen-presenting cell. How T cells convert the lifetime of the extracellular TCR-pMHC interaction into an intracellular signal remains unknown. Here, we developed a synthetic signaling system in which the extracellular domains of the TCR and pMHC were replaced with short hybridizing strands of DNA. Remarkably, T cells can discriminate between DNA ligands differing by a single base pair. Single-molecule imaging reveals that signaling is initiated when single ligand-bound receptors are converted into clusters, a time-dependent process requiring ligands with longer bound times. A computation model reveals that receptor clustering serves a kinetic proofreading function, enabling ligands with longer bound times to have disproportionally greater signaling outputs. These results suggest that spatial reorganization of receptors plays an important role in ligand discrimination in T cell signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2604028246,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a worldwide epidemic with a medical need for additional targeted therapies. Suppression of hepatic glucose production (HGP) effectively ameliorates diabetes and can be exploited for its treatment. We hypothesized that targeting PGC-1α acetylation in the liver, a chemical modification known to inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis, could be potentially used for treatment of T2D. Thus, we designed a high-throughput chemical screen platform to quantify PGC-1α acetylation in cells and identified small molecules that increase PGC-1α acetylation, suppress gluconeogenic gene expression, and reduce glucose production in hepatocytes. On the basis of potency and bioavailability, we selected a small molecule, SR-18292, that reduces blood glucose, strongly increases hepatic insulin sensitivity, and improves glucose homeostasis in dietary and genetic mouse models of T2D. These studies have important implications for understanding the regulatory mechanisms of glucose metabolism and treatment of T2D."
https://openalex.org/W2598379669,"Many accuracy measures have been proposed in the past for time series forecasting comparisons. However, many of these measures suffer from one or more issues such as poor resistance to outliers and scale dependence. In this paper, while summarising commonly used accuracy measures, a special review is made on the symmetric mean absolute percentage error. Moreover, a new accuracy measure called the Unscaled Mean Bounded Relative Absolute Error (UMBRAE), which combines the best features of various alternative measures, is proposed to address the common issues of existing measures. A comparative evaluation on the proposed and related measures has been made with both synthetic and real-world data. The results indicate that the proposed measure, with user selectable benchmark, performs as well as or better than other measures on selected criteria. Though it has been commonly accepted that there is no single best accuracy measure, we suggest that UMBRAE could be a good choice to evaluate forecasting methods, especially for cases where measures based on geometric mean of relative errors, such as the geometric mean relative absolute error, are preferred."

Close collaborations between basic scientists and clinical genomicists are now needed to link genetic variants with disease causation. To facilitate such collaborations, we recommend prioritizing clinically relevant genes for functional studies, developing reference variant-phenotype databases, adopting phenotype description standards, and promoting data sharing."

Here, we combine X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to obtain a molecular model for basal Pol I initiation. The three-subunit CF binds upstream promoter DNA, docks to the Pol I-Rrn3 complex, and loads DNA into the expanded active center cleft of the polymerase. DNA unwinding between the Pol I protrusion and clamp domains enables cleft contraction, resulting in an active Pol I conformation and RNA synthesis. Comparison with the Pol II system suggests that promoter specificity relies on a distinct “bendability” and “meltability” of the promoter sequence that enables contacts between initiation factors, DNA, and polymerase.

Comparison with the Pol II system suggests that promoter specificity relies on a distinct “bendability” and “meltability” of the promoter sequence that enables contacts between initiation factors, DNA, and polymerase. Transcription in eukaryotic cells is carried out by RNA polymerases Pol I, Pol II, and Pol III (Roeder and Rutter, 1969Roeder R.G. Rutter W.J. Multiple forms of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase in eukaryotic organisms.Nature. 1969; 224: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). The polymerases share a conserved active center (Cramer et al., 2001Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D.

Whereas Pol I synthesizes the rRNA precursor (Moss et al., 2007Moss T. Langlois F. Gagnon-Kugler T. Stefanovsky V. A housekeeper with power of attorney: the rRNA genes in ribosome biogenesis.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 29-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), Pol II and Pol III mainly produce mRNAs and tRNAs, respectively. For gene class-specific transcription, the polymerases assemble with different sets of initiation factors at their specific promoters. The mechanisms underlying promoter-specific initiation and gene class-specific transcription remain poorly understood. Whereas the structure of initiation complexes of Pol I and Pol III are unknown, recent studies have elucidated the structural basis for Pol II initiation (He et al., 2016He Y. Yan C. Fang J.

Initiation begins with the assembly of Pol II and the general initiation factors TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH on promoter DNA, to form a closed complex (CC) (Buratowski et al., 1989Buratowski S.

Structural basis of transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16: 129-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In the CC, promoter DNA is positioned above the active center cleft of Pol II, running along the tip of the clamp domain. Upon ATP hydrolysis by a translocase in TFIIH, DNA is unwound and the template strand is inserted into the active center, resulting in an open complex (OC) (Grünberg et al., 2012Grünberg S. Warfield L. Hahn S. Architecture of the RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex and mechanism of ATP-dependent promoter opening.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 788-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the transcription start site (TSS) is recognized and RNA synthesis commences, giving rise to an initially transcribing complex (ITC). When the RNA product grows beyond a critical length, initiation factors dissociate and the elongation complex (EC) forms. Pol II initiation critically depends on TFIIB. TFIIB bridges between Pol II and promoter DNA and its location on Pol II determines the topology of the initiation complex (Kostrewa et al., 2009Kostrewa D. Zeller M.E. Armache K.J. Seizl M. Leike K. Thomm M. Cramer P. RNA polymerase II-TFIIB structure and mechanism of transcription initiation.Nature. 2009; 462: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). TFIIB comprises an N-terminal zinc ribbon domain that binds the dock domain of Pol II (Bushnell et al., 2004Bushnell D.A. Westover K.D. Davis R.E. Kornberg R.D.

The TFIIB linker and reader elements connect the TFIIB ribbon and cyclin domains and participate in DNA opening and TSS recognition, respectively (Kostrewa et al., 2009Kostrewa D. Zeller M.E.

The initiation system of Pol I differs substantially from that of Pol II. A basal level of initiation by yeast Pol I requires only Rrn3 and the heterotrimeric core factor (CF) in vitro (Bedwell et al., 2012Bedwell G.J. Appling F.D. Anderson S.J. Schneider D.A.

Here, we elucidate the molecular basis of basal Pol I transcription initiation with the use of a structural biology hybrid approach. We report the crystal structure of yeast CF and show that it strongly differs from TFIIB. We also report the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the Pol I-Rrn3-CF complex and a Pol I ITC containing Rrn3, CF, and the ribosomal DNA promoter. Biochemical probing of these structures using a promoter-specific initiation assay elucidates the mechanism of Pol I initiation. Comparison of our results with the Pol II system reveals major differences and provides insights into the molecular basis and evolution of promoter specificity in the different transcription systems. We obtained Saccharomyces cerevisiae core factor (CF) after heterologous co-expression of its three subunits in Escherichia coli. For CF purification, we modified previously published protocols (Bedwell et al., 2012Bedwell G.J. Appling F.D. Anderson S.J. Schneider D.A. Efficient transcription by RNA polymerase I using recombinant core factor.Gene. 2012; 492: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, Knutson et al., 2014Knutson B.A. Luo J. Ranish J. Hahn S. Architecture of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA polymerase I Core Factor complex.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and could remove co-purifying chaperones (STAR Methods). Purified CF contained the three subunits in apparently stoichiometric amounts (Figure S1A) and could be crystallized by vapor diffusion. The crystal structure was determined by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) using selenomethionine-derivatized crystals in space group P65 (Table S1). Native crystals comprised six CF complexes per asymmetric unit in space group P1 and diffracted to 3.2 Å resolution. Building of an atomic model was supported by sequence markers, in particular 21 selenium sites that revealed the location of methionine residues. We additionally located 17 cysteine residues and 5 sulfate ions with the use of anomalous diffraction from sulfur atoms (Table S2) and introduced six additional methionine markers in regions that were difficult to build (Figure S1; STAR Methods). The structure was refined to R/Rfree factors of 26.1%/28.8% with good stereochemistry (Table S1). The crystal structure reveals that CF comprises two modules that are flexibly linked and separated by a central hinge region (Figure 1). Module I is formed by an N-terminal seven-bladed β-propeller domain in Rrn6 and by subunit Rrn11, which forms a superhelical TPR domain and a distinct helical domain that we name “propeller/promoter-associated domain” (PAD). Module II is formed by a helical C-terminal domain in Rrn6 (“headlock domain”) that wraps around Rrn7, which forms two cyclin folds as predicted (Knutson and Hahn, 2011Knutson B.A. Hahn S. Yeast Rrn7 and human TAF1B are TFIIB-related RNA polymerase I general transcription factors.Science. 2011; 333: 1637-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, Naidu et al., 2011Naidu S.

TAF1B is a TFIIB-like component of the basal transcription machinery for RNA polymerase I.Science. 2011; 333: 1640-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The C-terminal Rrn7 cyclin domain contains an insertion that forms six helices (α8a–α8f) and reaches over to module I (Figures 1B and S1). The structure lacks only the mobile N- and C-terminal regions of Rrn6, an insertion in the β-propeller, the 93 N-terminal residues of Rrn7, which includes the flexibly linked ribbon domain, and a mobile insertion in the Rrn11 PAD. The structure enabled us to manually curate alignments of CF subunit sequences from different species (Data S1). The CF structure rationalizes effects of known mutations. For example, the Rrn11 N terminus is buried in the Rrn6 β-propeller, explaining why its deletion is lethal (Knutson et al., 2014Knutson B.A. Luo J. Ranish J. Hahn S. Architecture of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA polymerase I Core Factor complex.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A search for structural similarity to Rrn7 using PDBeFold (Krissinel and Henrick, 2004Krissinel E. Henrick K.

Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3148) Google Scholar) identified TFIIB and its archaeal homolog TFB and led to a structure-based alignment of Rrn7 with TFIIB (Figures 2A, 2B , and Data S1). This is consistent with the predicted sequence homology of Rrn7 and TFIIB (Blattner et al., 2011Blattner C. Jennebach S. Herzog F. Mayer A. Cheung A.C. Witte G. Lorenzen K. Hopfner K.P. Heck A.J.

However, the Rrn7 cyclin domains are imbedded in the CF structure and differ strongly from their TFIIB counterparts. In particular, the surface of cyclin domain II is altered by an insertion that bridges between the CF modules. Modeling of CF onto DNA based on a superposition of Rrn7 with TFIIB in the Pol II initiation complex structure (Plaschka et al., 2016Plaschka C. Hantsche M. Dienemann C. Burzinski C. Plitzko J. Cramer P. Transcription initiation complex structures elucidate DNA opening.Nature. 2016; 533: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) shows that Rrn7 cannot bind to DNA in the way TFIIB does (Figure 2C). Major clashes are observed between modeled DNA and Rrn7 cyclin domains (α1, α4a, α10, and loops α2–α3 and α7–α8), the Rrn6 β-propeller, and the headlock domain helix α2. Furthermore, modeling CF onto Pol I under the assumption that the N-terminal cyclin domain of Rrn7 binds to the polymerase wall like TFIIB does (Kostrewa et al., 2009Kostrewa D. Zeller M.E.

https://openalex.org/W2588900481,"The discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) and their critical role in genetic control opened new avenues in understanding of various biological processes including immune cell lineage commitment, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. However, a given miRNA may have hundreds of different mRNA targets and a target might be regulated by multiple miRNAs, thus the characterisation of dysregulated miRNA expression profiles could give a better insight into the development of immunological disturbances in autoimmune diseases. The aim of our study was to examine the changes in miRNA expression profiles in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). Eight SLE patients, 8 pSS patients and 7 healthy subjects were enrolled in the investigation. MiRNAs were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and expression patterns were determined with Illumina next-generation sequencing technology. Since the immunopathogenesis of pSS and SLE encompasses pronounced B cell hyperactivity along with specific autoantibody production, we paid a special attention on the association between miRNA expression levels and altered peripheral B cell distribution. In SLE patients 135, while in pSS patients 26 miRNAs showed altered expression. Interestingly, the 25 miRNAs including miR-146a, miR-16 and miR-21, which were over-expressed in pSS patients, were found to be elevated in SLE group, as well. On the contrary, we observed the down-regulation of miR-150-5p, which is a novel and unique finding in pSS. Levels of several miRNAs over-expressed in SLE, were not changed in pSS, such as miR-148a-3p, miR-152, miR-155, miR-223, miR-224, miR-326 and miR-342. Expression levels of miR-223-5p, miR-150-5p, miR-155-5p and miR-342-3p, which miRNAs are potentially linked to B cell functions, showed associations with the B cell proportions within peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The observed differences in miRNA expression profiles and the better understanding of immune regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs may help to elucidate the pathogenesis of SLE and pSS."

This mechanism leads to tight allosteric coupling between gates, preventing them from opening simultaneously. Interestingly, the substrate appears to take a “free ride” across the membrane without causing major structural rearrangements in the transporter. Membrane transporters, which control the flow of a wide variety of molecules into and out of the cell, are generally thought to operate by a common “alternating access” model, proposed over 50 years ago (Jardetzky, 1966Jardetzky O. Simple allosteric model for membrane pumps.Nature. 1966; 211: 969-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, Mitchell, 1957Mitchell P. A general theory of membrane transport from studies of bacteria.Nature. 1957; 180: 134-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). According to this model, a transporter undergoes structural transitions that alternately expose a substrate-binding site to either side of the membrane. Crystallography has lent support to this model by capturing snapshots of transporters in multiple distinct conformations, including outward-open and inward-open conformations in which the substrate-binding site is accessible to the extracellular and intracellular regions, respectively (Drew and Boudker, 2016Drew D.

What drives the large-scale conformational changes of the transporter? What are the intermediate conformations between the outward-open and inward-open state, and what functional role do they play, if any? How exactly are structural rearrangements of transporters linked to substrate movement across the membrane? Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal protein motions at an atomic level and thus appear particularly well-suited to answer these questions in conjunction with crystallography and other experimental techniques (Adelman et al., 2016Adelman J.L.

Capturing critical events such as the translocation of a substrate through a transporter or the transition of a transporter between its outward-open and inward-open conformation, however, has proven challenging in simulation (Li et al., 2015Li J.

This reflects not only the relative scarcity of experimental structures of transporters, but also the large size of many transporters and the intensive computational requirements of MD simulations on the relatively long timescales at which transport occurs. Several elegant studies have provided important insights into these events through atomic-level simulations by relying on biased or guided simulation techniques (Cheng and Bahar, 2014Cheng M.H.

To overcome this barrier, we focused on a “minimal” alternating access transporter, the sugar transporter SemiSWEET. SemiSWEET is among the smallest characterized transporters (< 20 kDa), has a simple geometry (a symmetric dimer of three-helix bundles), and is thought to transport a single substrate rather than engaging in coupled transport (Xu et al., 2014Xu Y. Tao Y. Cheung L.S. Fan C. Chen L.Q. Xu S. Perry K. Frommer W.B. Feng L.

USA. 2013; 110: E3685-E3694Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The structure of SemiSWEET, a SWEET family transporter found in bacteria, mimics the core of the eukaryotic SWEET transporter (Tao et al., 2015Tao Y. Cheung L.S. Li S. Eom J.S. Chen L.Q. Xu Y. Perry K. Frommer W.B. Feng L. Structure of a eukaryotic SWEET transporter in a homotrimeric complex.Nature. 2015; 527: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, Xuan et al., 2013Xuan Y.H.

Members of the widespread SWEET family of sugar transporters play critical roles in many important biological processes in plants, including phloem loading, nectar secretion, pollen development, seed filling, and host-pathogen interactions, and are important regulators of metabolic homeostasis in animals (Chen et al., 2015Chen L.Q.

Recent crystal structures have captured several distinct conformations of SemiSWEET (Lee et al., 2015Lee Y. Nishizawa T. Yamashita K. Ishitani R. Nureki O. Structural basis for the facilitative diffusion mechanism by SemiSWEET transporter.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 6112Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2014Wang J. Yan C. Li Y.

Structures of bacterial homologues of SWEET transporters in two distinct conformations.Nature. 2014; 515: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These conformations were captured in orthologous proteins from different species, however, and structural deviations caused by sequence divergence thus complicate their interpretation (Figure S1). A full set of conformations in a single SemiSWEET isoform is needed to ascertain the precise conformational changes that constitute the transport cycle. Furthermore, none of the existing structures for any SWEET family transporter has had a known substrate bound, and thus, the basis for substrate recognition in this family has been unclear. And, of course, the fundamental mechanistic questions that remain unanswered for other transporters apply to SemiSWEET, as well. We report crystal structures of both outward-open and inward-open conformations of L. biflexa SemiSWEET (LbSemiSWEET), with the substrate glucose bound in the former. Together with the previously reported structure of an occluded conformation, in which the substrate-binding pocket is open to neither the inside nor the outside of the cell (Xu et al., 2014Xu Y. Tao Y. Cheung L.S. Fan C. Chen L.Q. Xu S. Perry K. Frommer W.B. Feng L. Structures of bacterial homologues of SWEET transporters in two distinct conformations.Nature. 2014; 515: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), experimental structures of all three conformations are now available for a single SemiSWEET ortholog. To the best of our knowledge, such a complete set of structures was not previously available for any uniporter or SWEET family transporter. Using the glucose-bound SemiSWEET structure as a starting point, we performed unguided atomic-level MD simulations of the glucose translocation process, capturing the spontaneous transition of the transporter from its outward-open to its inward-open conformation. We also performed simulations of glucose-free SemiSWEET and captured a similar spontaneous conformational transition in the absence of substrate. Both sets of simulations spontaneously reached the experimentally observed occluded and inward-open conformations even though these experimental structures were not used to inform the simulations. These results, further validated through mutagenesis experiments, allow us to describe an alternating access transport mechanism in atomic detail. In particular, they enable us to describe the sequence of conformational changes that gives rise to substrate translocation, the forces that drive these conformational changes, and the nature of the allosteric coupling that ensures that the substrate-binding pocket is not simultaneously accessible from both sides of the membrane. To determine the structure of LbSemiSWEET in an outward-open state, we designed a mutation predicted to favor this conformational state. In the previously reported occluded-state crystal structure (Xu et al., 2014Xu Y. Tao Y. Cheung L.S. Fan C. Chen L.Q. Xu S. Perry K. Frommer W.B. Feng L. Structures of bacterial homologues of SWEET transporters in two distinct conformations.Nature. 2014; 515: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), a network of interactions between the two protomers near the extracellular and intracellular surfaces seal the substrate-binding cavity from solvent (Figure S2A). We reasoned that mutations that disrupt interactions on the extracellular surface might favor an outward-open conformation. Indeed, a mutant in which the extracellular residue Asp57 was replaced by alanine (D57A) crystallized in an outward-open conformation, yielding a crystal structure with a resolution of 2.8 Å (Figure 1A and Table S1).Figure 1Crystal Structure of LbSemiSWEET Captured in an Outward-Open ConformationShow full caption(A) LbSemiSWEETD57A captured in an outward-open conformation.

(B) Cell-based radioactive glucose uptake by WT LbSemiSWEET (blue trace) compared to the D57A mutant (red trace). See also Figure S1 and S2 and Table S1. Notably, the D57A mutant exhibited more than double the glucose affinity of the wild-type (WT) (apparent Km of ∼70 μM for D57A and ∼160 μM for the WT; Figure 1B), and the growth of these crystals depended on the presence of glucose. After all protein atoms were modeled for the outward-open D57A LbSemiSWEET, we observed a strong electron density in the substrate-binding pocket that fits the transporter substrate, glucose (Figure 1A). We were thus able to place glucose into the density, and the resulting pose proved compatible with the local protein environment. This substrate-bound structure of a SWEET-family transporter provides insight into the structural basis for substrate recognition in these transporters (discussed below). It also provides a starting point for simulations of substrate translocation. We initiated all-atom MD simulations of LbSemiSWEET from the glucose-bound, outward-open crystal structure (20 simulations totaling 66.8 μs). We performed additional simulations beginning from the same crystal structure but with glucose removed (20 simulations totaling 57.8 μs). In all simulations, we placed the transporter in a hydrated lipid bilayer and reverted residue 57 to its WT identity (Asp). The complete set of simulation conditions and durations is listed in Table S2. In several simulations (four with glucose and four without), the transporter transitioned spontaneously from its outward-open conformation to an inward-open conformation, in which the binding cavity was accessible to solvent from the intracellular side (Figure 2A). The magnitude of this conformational change was substantial, with individual helices displacing up to 5 Å from their starting position. Interestingly, the simulations that transitioned to the inward-open conformation first visited a metastable, occluded conformation, in which the binding pocket was inaccessible to solvent from either side of the membrane. The simulations that did not transition to an inward-open conformation remained in the outward-open conformation, apart from three that ended in the occluded conformation. Interestingly, our simulations indicate that the conformational states visited in simulation with glucose bound are essentially identical to those without any substrate present (Figure 6). In addition, the sequence of events involved in the transition from the outward-open to inward-open conformation appears to be the same in the presence and absence of glucose (Figure S4). Our simulations also captured the substrate translocation process (Figure 2B). In six of the simulations initiated from the glucose-bound, outward-open structure, glucose dissociated from the transporter into the extracellular solvent, while the transporter remained in the outward-open conformation. In one of these simulations, glucose later re-associated with the transporter, which was still in an outward-open conformation. In one of the glucose-bound simulations in which the transporter transitioned to an inward-open conformation, glucose subsequently unbound from the substrate-binding site and translocated to the intracellular surface of the transporter. To validate our simulations, we sought to solve the structure of LbSemiSWEET in an inward-open conformation. We reasoned that mutations that disrupt interactions on the intracellular side might favor an inward-open conformation. We designed a mutant in which the intracellular residue Gln20 was replaced by alanine (Q20A). This construct crystallized in an inward-open conformation (albeit in a domain-swapped configuration; see STAR Methods; Figure S2), yielding a crystal structure with a resolution of 2.8 Å (Figure 3A), which closely matches a previously published inward-open structure of E. coli SemiSWEET (Lee et al., 2015Lee Y. Nishizawa T. Yamashita K. Ishitani R. Nureki O. Structural basis for the facilitative diffusion mechanism by SemiSWEET transporter.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 6112Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Strikingly, simulations initiated from the outward-open crystal structure transitioned to a conformation that matched our inward-open structure very closely (Figure 3B). Indeed, the deviations of the simulations from the inward-open crystal structure after this transition were comparable to the deviations of a simulation initiated from an inward-open crystal structure (Figure S3A). The observed deviations most likely represent thermal fluctuations. Additionally, the occluded intermediate conformation visited during simulations of the outward-open to inward-open conformational transition very closely matched the previously published occluded-state crystal structure of LbSemiSWEET (Figure 3B). This suggests that the occluded conformation is in fact an on-pathway intermediate visited as part of the transport process. Additional simulations initiated from the occluded-state crystal structure, both with and without glucose added to the substrate-binding pocket, also transitioned spontaneously to the same inward-open conformational state seen in simulations initiated from the outward-open conformation. None of the simulations initiated from the outward-open or occluded states incorporated any prior knowledge of the crystallographically observed inward-open conformation, so the fact that they reached it spontaneously provides an indication of their predictive power. The same is true for simulations initiated from the outward-open state that reached the crystallographically observed occluded state without incorporating any prior knowledge of the occluded state structure. We further validated our simulations through a number of mutagenesis experiments, discussed below. The most notable conformational changes in the transition from an outward-open to an inward-open conformation are the closing of an extracellular gate and the opening of an intracellular gate. These two gates appear to control the accessibility of the substrate-binding pocket to the extracellular and intracellular solvent, respectively. Both gates are formed by residues at the interface between the two symmetric protomers that make up SemiSWEET. The extracellular gate consists of residues Tyr51 of the second transmembrane helix (TM2) and Ile60 of TM3 (immediately above the substrate-binding pocket) and Arg55 and Asp57 (near the extracellular surface) (Figure 4A). The intracellular gate consists of residues Phe17 on TM1 and Phe41 on TM2 (immediately beneath the substrate-binding pocket) and Met37 and Tyr38 on TM2 (near the intracellular surface) (Figure 4A). We found that each outward-open to inward-open transition began with closure of the extracellular gate (Figure 4B). In particular, TM3 tilted such that its extracellular end moved inward toward the central axis of the transporter, accompanied by a smaller inward motion of the extracellular end of TM2. This movement, which usually took place either simultaneously or within a few hundred nanoseconds in both protomers, resulted in tight packing between the extracellular gate residues Ile60 on TM3 and Tyr51 on TM2 of the opposite protomer (Figure 4A). As a result, the substrate-binding pocket became sealed from the extracellular or intracellular solution. Upon inward displacement of TM3, cross-protomer ionic contacts also formed between Asp57 and Arg55, although these contacts appeared less stable, breaking and reforming intermittently. Notably, the transporter persisted in this state with both extracellular and intracellular gates closed for up to several hundred nanoseconds (Figure S4). The outward-open to inward-open transition concluded with the intracellular gate opening. In particular, the intracellular end of TM1 kinked at Pro19, with Phe17 flipping to point away from the central translocation path, packing instead against TM3 (Figures 4A and 4B). Again, this movement usually took place in the two protomers simultaneously or almost simultaneously (within a few tens of nanoseconds). These motions were accompanied by outward displacement of TM2, which caused Met37, Tyr38, and Phe41 to shift away from the central substrate translocation pore, exposing the binding pocket to solvent. Closure of the extracellular and intracellular gates, which is tightly linked to larger motions of the helices, appears to be driven by formation of favorable contacts between the gate residues. Hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions stabilize the closed state of the extracellular gate, and hydrophobic and aromatic interactions stabilize the closed state of the intracellular gate (Figure 4A). These contacts also appear to be responsible for the cooperativity of conformational changes across the two protomers: formation of the most favorable set of contacts requires that both sides of a gate be in the closed conformation, so once one side closes, the other is more likely to adopt a closed conformation, and once one side opens, the other is more likely to open. But what drives the gates to open? And why does the intracellular gate generally open only after the extracellular gate closes? Such negative cooperativity between the two gates is critical because it prevents the “forbidden state” in which both gates are open, resulting in a continuously conducting pore (King and Wilson, 1990King S.C. Wilson T.H. Towards an understanding of the structural basis of ‘forbidden’ transport pathways in the Escherichia coli lactose carrier: mutations probing the energy barriers to uncoupled transport.Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1433-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The intracellular gate is apparently driven to open because TM1 energetically favors a conformation in which it is kinked at Pro19, allowing the formation of backbone hydrogen bonds between Thr13 and Phe17 and between Thr14 and Leu18. In simulations of an isolated TM1, the helix quickly adopts a kinked conformation matching that observed in the inward-open state, with the inner gate residue Phe17 favoring the rotamer it adopts in the inward-open state (Figure S5). The kinking of TM1 is apparently prevented in the outward-open state, however, by favorable packing interactions between TM1 and TM3 (Figure 5). Upon extracellular gate closure, TM3 tilts such that its extracellular end moves inward, causing TM1 to move slightly outward. These helical motions substantially reduce the number of contacts between TM1 and TM3 (Figure S5), freeing TM1 to kink and thus allowing the intracellular gate to open.Figure 5Model for State Transitions in an Alternating Access Transporter, SemiSWEETShow full captionTM2 of one protomer (yellow) and TM1 and TM3 of the opposing protomer (purple) are shown. The other, identical set of three helices is omitted for clarity. Gray bars represent closed extracellular and intracellular gates, and black circles represent helical packing interactions. In the outward-open state (left), TM1—which, if isolated, tends to kink about a centrally located proline residue—instead assumes a straightened conformation stabilized by packing interactions with TM3. Closure of the extracellular gate, which involves a substantial motion of TM3, leads to a loss of packing interactions between TM1 and TM3. In this more “isolated” environment, TM1 kinks, opening the intracellular gate.

A driver of increased MS risk is the soluble form of the interleukin-7 receptor alpha chain gene (sIL7R) produced by alternative splicing of IL7R exon 6. Here, we identified the RNA helicase DDX39B as a potent activator of this exon and consequently a repressor of sIL7R, and we found strong genetic association of DDX39B with MS risk. Indeed, we showed that a genetic variant in the 5' UTR of DDX39B reduces translation of DDX39B mRNAs and increases MS risk. Importantly, this DDX39B variant showed strong genetic and functional epistasis with allelic variants in IL7R exon 6. This study establishes the occurrence of biological epistasis in humans and provides mechanistic insight into the regulation of IL7R exon 6 splicing and its impact on MS risk."

Despite identification of numerous NKR-ligand interactions, physiological ligands for the prototypical NK1.1 orphan receptor remain elusive. Here, we identify a viral ligand for the inhibitory and activating NKR-P1 (NK1.1) receptors. This murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV)-encoded protein, m12, restrains NK cell effector function by directly engaging the inhibitory NKR-P1B receptor. However, m12 also interacts with the activating NKR-P1A/C receptors to counterbalance m12 decoy function. Structural analyses reveal that m12 sequesters a large NKR-P1 surface area via a polar claw mechanism. Polymorphisms in, and ablation of, the viral m12 protein and host NKR-P1B/C alleles impact NK cell responses in vivo. Thus, we identify the long-sought foreign ligand for this key immunoregulatory NKR family and reveal how it controls the evolutionary balance of immune recognition during host-pathogen interplay."

The aim of this study was to elucidate the effects of zinc sulphate (ZnSO4) on the osteogenic differentiation of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) in the presence of EMF as a strategy in osteoporosis therapy. Alkaline phophatase (ALP) activity measurement, calcium assay and expression of several osteoblastic marker genes were examined to assess the effect of ZnSO4 on the osteogenic differentiation of ADSCs under EMF. The expression of cAMP and PKA was evaluated by ELISA. The expression of β-catenin, Wnt1, Wnt3a, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) and reduced dickkopf1 (DKK1) genes were used to detect the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. It was found that ZnSO4, in the presence of EMF, resulted in an increase in the expression of osteogenic genes, ALP activity and calcium levels. EMF, in the presence of ZnSO4, increased the cAMP level and protein kinase A (PKA) activity. Treatment of ADSCs with (MAPK)/ERK kinase 1/2 inhibitor, or PKA inhibitor, significantly inhibited the promotion of osteogenic markers, indicating that the induction of osteogenesis was dependent on the ERK and PKA signaling pathways. Real-time PCR analysis showed that ZnSO4, in the presence of EMF, increased the mRNA expressions of β-catenin, Wnt1, Wnt3a, LRP5 and DKK1. In this study, it was shown that 0.432 μg/ml ZnSO4, in the presence of 50 Hz, 20 mT EMF, induced the osteogenic differentiation of ADSCs via PKA, ERK1/2 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2598027697,"Background Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy is an inherited heart muscle disorder leading to ventricular arrhythmias and heart failure, mainly as a result of mutations in cardiac desmosomal genes. Desmosomes are cell-cell junctions mediating adhesion of cardiomyocytes; however, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the disease remain widely unknown. Desmocollin-2 is a desmosomal cadherin serving as an anchor molecule required to reconstitute homeostatic intercellular adhesion with desmoglein-2. Cardiac specific lack of desmoglein-2 leads to severe cardiomyopathy, whereas overexpression does not. In contrast, the corresponding data for desmocollin-2 are incomplete, in particular from the view of protein overexpression. Therefore, we developed a mouse model overexpressing desmocollin-2 to determine its potential contribution to cardiomyopathy and intercellular adhesion pathology. Methods and results We generated transgenic mice overexpressing DSC2 in cardiac myocytes. Transgenic mice developed a severe cardiac dysfunction over 5 to 13 weeks as indicated by 2D-echocardiography measurements. Corresponding histology and immunohistochemistry demonstrated fibrosis, necrosis and calcification which were mainly localized in patches near the epi- and endocardium of both ventricles. Expressions of endogenous desmosomal proteins were markedly reduced in fibrotic areas but appear to be unchanged in non-fibrotic areas. Furthermore, gene expression data indicate an early up-regulation of inflammatory and fibrotic remodeling pathways between 2 to 3.5 weeks of age. Conclusion Cardiac specific overexpression of desmocollin-2 induces necrosis, acute inflammation and patchy cardiac fibrotic remodeling leading to fulminant biventricular cardiomyopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2600261701,"Nitric oxide (NO) is an intercellular messenger involved in multiple bodily functions. Prolonged NO exposure irreversibly inhibits respiration by covalent modification of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase, a phenomenon of pathological relevance. However, the speed and potency of NO's metabolic effects at physiological concentrations are incompletely characterized. To this end, we set out to investigate the metabolic effects of NO in cultured astrocytes from mice by taking advantage of the high spatiotemporal resolution afforded by genetically encoded Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) nanosensors. NO exposure resulted in immediate and reversible intracellular glucose depletion and lactate accumulation. Consistent with cytochrome oxidase involvement, the glycolytic effect was enhanced at a low oxygen level and became irreversible at a high NO concentration or after prolonged exposure. Measurements of both glycolytic rate and mitochondrial pyruvate consumption revealed significant effects even at nanomolar NO concentrations. We conclude that NO can modulate astrocytic energy metabolism in the short term, reversibly, and at concentrations known to be released by endothelial cells under physiological conditions. These findings suggest that NO modulates the size of the astrocytic lactate reservoir involved in neuronal fueling and signaling."

The deep sea can be considered an extreme habitat due to low temperatures (<5°C) and high pressure, however marine sponges survive in these habitats. While bacteria derived from deep-sea marine sponges have been studied, much less information is available on fungal biodiversity associated with these sponges. Following screening of fourteen fungi isolated from the deep-sea sponge Stelletta normani sampled at a depth of 751 metres, three halotolerant strains (TS2, TS11 and TS12) were identified which displayed high CMCase and xylanase activities. Molecular based taxonomic approaches identified these strains as Cadophora sp. TS2, Emericellopsis sp. TS11 and Pseudogymnoascus sp. TS 12. These three fungi displayed psychrotolerance and halotolerant growth on CMC and xylan as sole carbon sources, with optimal growth rates at 20°C. They produced CMCase and xylanase activities, which displayed optimal temperature and pH values of between 50–70°C and pH 5–8 respectively, together with good thermostability and halotolerance. In solid-state fermentations TS2, TS11 and TS12 produced CMCases, xylanases and peroxidase/phenol oxidases when grown on corn stover and wheat straw. This is the first time that CMCase, xylanase and peroxidase/phenol oxidase activities have been reported in these three fungal genera isolated from a marine sponge. Given the biochemical characteristics of these ligninolytic enzymes it is likely that they may prove useful in future biomass conversion strategies involving lignocellulosic materials."
https://openalex.org/W2602293693,"Neuropathic pain resulting from peripheral neuronal damage is largely resistant to treatment with currently available analgesic drugs. Recently, ATP, lysophosphatidic acid, and platelet-activating factor (PAF) have been reported to play important inductive roles in neuropathic pain. In the present study, we found that pain-like behaviors resulting from partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSL) were largely attenuated by deficiency of lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT)2, which is one of the PAF biosynthetic enzymes. By contrast, deficiency of the other PAF biosynthetic enzyme, LPCAT1, did not ameliorate neuropathic pain. With regard to the mechanism of the observed effects, LPCAT2 was detected in wild-type spinal cord microglia, and the absence of LPCAT2 expression precluded spinal PAF expression in LPCAT2-knockout mice. Furthermore, ATP-stimulated PAF biosynthesis in macrophages was decreased by pretreatment with the PAF receptor antagonist ABT-491, indicating the existence of a positive feedback loop of PAF biosynthesis, which we designated the PAF-pain loop. In conclusion, LPCAT2 is a novel therapeutic target for newly categorized analgesic drugs; in addition, our data call for the re-evaluation of the clinical utility of PAF receptor antagonists.-Shindou, H., Shiraishi, S., Tokuoka, S.

https://openalex.org/W2602917953,"When activated through toll-like receptors (TLRs), macrophages generate IL-33, an IL-1 family member that induces innate immune responses through ST2 signaling. LPS, a TLR4 ligand, induces macrophages to generate prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) through inducible COX-2 and microsomal PGE2 synthase 1 (mPGES-1) (1Duan Y. Chen F. Zhang A. Zhu B. Sun J. Xie Q. Chen Z. Aspirin inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced COX-2 expression and PGE2 production in porcine alveolar macrophages by modulating protein kinase C and protein tyrosine phosphatase activity.BMB Rep. 2014; 47: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that IL-33 production by bone marrow-derived murine macrophages (bmMFs) requires the generation of endogenous PGE2 and the intrinsic expression of EP2 receptors to amplify NF-κB-dependent, LPS-induced IL-33 expression via exchange protein activated by cAMP (EPAC). Compared with WT cells, bmMFs lacking either mPGES-1 or EP2 receptors displayed reduced LPS-induced IL-33 levels. A selective EP2 agonist and, to a lesser extent, EP4 receptor agonist potentiated LPS-induced IL-33 generation from both mPGES-1-null and WT bmMFs, whereas EP1 and EP3 receptor agonists were inactive. The effects of PGE2 depended on cAMP, were mimicked by an EPAC-selective agonist, and were attenuated by EPAC-selective antagonism and knockdown. LPS-induced p38 MAPK and NF-κB activations were necessary for both IL-33 production and PGE2 generation, and exogenous PGE2 partly reversed the suppression of IL-33 production caused by p38 MAPK and NF-κB inhibition. Mice lacking mPGES-1 showed lower IL-33 levels and attenuated lung inflammation in response to repetitive Alternaria inhalation challenges. Cumulatively, our data demonstrate that endogenous PGE2, EP2 receptors, and EPAC are prerequisites for maximal LPS-induced IL-33 expression and that exogenous PGE2 can amplify IL-33 production via EP2 and EP4 receptors.

https://openalex.org/W2598685584,"Viral hijacking and manipulation of host-cell biosynthetic pathways by human enveloped viruses are shared molecular events essential for the viral lifecycle. For Flaviviridae members such as hepatitis C virus and dengue virus (DENV), one of the key subsets of cellular pathways that undergo manipulation is the lipid metabolic pathways, underlining the importance of cellular lipids and, in particular, lipid droplets (LDs) in viral infection. Here, we hypothesize that targeting cellular enzymes that act as key regulators of lipid homeostasis and LD formation could represent a powerful approach to developing a novel class of broad-spectrum antivirals against infection associated with all DENV serotypes (1-4) circulating around the world. Using PF-429242, an active-site-directed inhibitor of SKI-1/S1P, we demonstrate that inhibition of SKI-1/S1P enzymatic activity in human hepatoma Huh-7.5.1 cells results in a robust reduction of the LD numbers and LD-positive areas and provides a means of effectively inhibiting infection by DENV (1-4). Pre-treatment of Huh-7.5.1 cells with PF-429242 results in a dose-dependent inhibition of DENV infection [median inhibitory dose (EC50) = 1.2 microM; median cytotoxic dose (CC50) = 81 microM; selectivity index (SI) = 68)] and a ~3-log decrease in DENV-2 titer with 20 microM of PF-429242. Post-treatment of DENV-2 infected Huh-7.5.1 cells with PF-429242 does not affect viral RNA abundance, but it does compromise the assembly and/or release of infectious virus particles. PF-429242 antiviral activity is reversed by exogenous oleic acid, which acts as an inducer of LD formation in PF-429242-treated and non-treated control cells. Collectively, our results demonstrate that human SKI-1/S1P is a potential target for indirect-acting pan-serotypic anti-DENV agents and reveal new therapeutic opportunities associated with the use of lipid-modulating drugs for controlling DENV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2600915861,"High altitude flight in rarefied, extremely cold and hypoxic air is a very challenging activity. Only a few species of birds can achieve it. Hitherto, the structure of the lungs of such birds has not been studied. This is because of the rarity of such species and the challenges of preparing well-fixed lung tissue. Here, it was posited that in addition to the now proven physiological adaptations, high altitude flying birds will also have acquired pulmonary structural adaptations that enable them to obtain the large amounts of oxygen (O2) needed for flight at high elevation, an environment where O2 levels are very low. The Andean goose (Chloephaga melanoptera) normally resides at altitudes above 3000 meters and flies to elevations as high as 6000 meters where O2 becomes limiting. In this study, its lung was morphologically- and morphometrically investigated. It was found that structurally the lungs are exceptionally specialized for gas exchange. Atypically, the infundibulae are well-vascularized. The mass-specific volume of the lung (42.8 cm3.kg-1), the mass-specific respiratory surface area of the blood-gas (tissue) barrier (96.5 cm2.g-1) and the mass-specific volume of the pulmonary capillary blood (7.44 cm3.kg-1) were some of the highest values so far reported in birds. The pulmonary structural specializations have generated a mass-specific total (overall) pulmonary morphometric diffusing capacity of the lung for oxygen (DLo2) of 0.119 mlO2.sec-1.mbar-1.kg-1, a value that is among some of the highest ones in birds that have been studied. The adaptations of the lung of the Andean goose possibly produce the high O2 conductance needed to live and fly at high altitude."

Because a fourth of these BINs derive from Lepidoptera, BOLD has a strong capability to both identify specimens in this order and to support studies of faunal overlap. DNA barcode sequences were obtained from 4503 moths from 329 sites across Pakistan, specimens that represented 981 BINs from 52 families. Among 379 species with a Linnaean name assignment, all were represented by a single BIN excepting five species that showed a BIN split. Less than half (44%) of the 981 BINs had counterparts in other countries; the remaining BINs were unique to Pakistan. Another 218 BINs of Lepidoptera from Pakistan were coupled with the 981 from this study before being compared with all 116,768 BINs for this order. As expected, faunal overlap was highest with India (21%), Sri Lanka (21%), United Arab Emirates (20%) and with other Asian nations (2.1%), but it was very low with other continents including Africa (0.6%), Europe (1.3%), Australia (0.6%), Oceania (1.0%), North America (0.1%), and South America (0.1%).

Patients and methods 28 patients with dcSSc, and 15 age gender matched normal controls were recruited. Skin echogenicity, thickness, and ARFI quantification were measured by ultrasound at 17 sites corresponding to the modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS) in each participant. Compared with controls, skin echogenicity of dcSSc patients was classified into isoechoic, hypoechoic, and hyperechoic. The skin thickness, ARFI quantification and mRSS were compared between isoechoic, hypoechoic, hyperechoic and controls. Results In patients with dcSSc, the skin thickness increased as the echogenicity changed on the order of isoechoic, hypoechoic and hyperechoic. ARFI quantification was significantly higher in hyperechoic than isoechoic (p<0.001). The mRSS were significantly higher in hyperechoic and/or hypoechoic than isoechoic. For isoechoic patients and healthy controls, the skin echogenicity or thickness was no significant different, however, the ARFI quantification was significantly higher in isoechoic than controls. Conclusion Skin ultrasound is feasible for assessing the skin involvement in dcSSc. Skin echogenicity correlates with skin thickness, stiffness, and mRSS. ARFI quantification may be more sensitive to detect skin changes, compared with skin echogenicity and thickness."

In the present study, we investigated the activities of antioxidant enzymes of cassava injured storage roots in PPD-susceptible (SC9) and PPD-tolerant (QZ1) genotypes at the time-points from 0h to 120h, and further analyzed their proteomic changes using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) in combination with MALDI-TOF-MS/MS. Ninety-nine differentially expressed proteins were identified from SC9 and QZ1 genotypes in the pairwise comparison of 24h/0h, 48h/0h, 72h/0h and 96h/0h. Of those proteins were associated with 13 biological functions, in which carbohydrate and energy metabolism related proteins were the biggest amount differential proteins in both genotypes, followed by chaperones, DNA and RNA metabolism, and defense system. We speculated that SOD in combination with CAT activities would be the first line of defense against PPD to support PPD-tolerant cassava varieties. The four hub proteins including CPN60B, LOS2, HSC70-1 and CPN20B, produced from the network of protein-protein interaction, will be the candidate key proteins linked with PPD. This study provides a new clue to improve cassava PPD-tolerant varieties and would be helpful to much better understand the molecular mechanism of PPD of cassava injured storage roots."

In this study, we characterized the features of the nasal mucosa of Bama minipigs (Sus scrofa domestica) via histological analysis.Five cross sections (I, II, III, IV, and V) were obtained from the distal end of the nasal cavity toward the pharynx (along the cavity axis) and examined. Specifically, CD3+ T cells, immunoglobulin A (IgA)+ cells, and M cells were detected by immunohistochemistry, while dendritic cells (DCs) were detected by immunofluorescence. The distribution of goblet cells was determined by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining.The nasal cavity of Bama minipigs can be divided into three parts: the regio vestibularis (I, II), regio respiratoria (III, IV), and regio olfactoria (V). Lymphoid tissue was present at random locations in the nasal cavity. Abundant lymphoid tissue was located in the roof of the nasopharyngeal meatus and was continuous with the lymphoid tissue of the pharynx. The distribution of CD3+ T cells, IgA+ cells, M cells, and DCs increased distally in the nasal cavity.The present work comprises a histological study of the nasal cavity of Bama minipigs, and will be beneficial for understanding the mechanisms of immunity in these animals after nasal vaccination."

RNA interference assays showed that suppression of AP2M1 (AP-2 adaptor protein), RAB5A, VPS35 (vacuolar protein sorting 35 homolog), and M6PR (mannose 6-phosphate receptor) blocked PrPC internalization, whereas down-regulation of GIT2 and VPS28 increased PrPC internalization.

The primary translation product of PrPC is cotranslationally translocated to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (2Prusiner S.B. Prion Biology and Diseases.2nd Ed.

Distal sorting delivers PrPC to the plasma membrane where it resides in lipid rafts (4Taylor D.R. Hooper N.M.

The highways and byways of prion protein trafficking.Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 102-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). PrPC located in lipid rafts may be internalized by caveolin/dynamin-dependent endocytosis. PrPC is transported via caveosomes to early endosomes or to lysosomes for degradation. Alternatively, internalization of PrPC may be mediated by a clathrin-dependent process (9Shyng S.L. Lehmann S. Moulder K.L. Harris D.A.

Dynamin-independent endocytosis pathways may also be involved. This process may be crucial for the conversion of normal PrPC into PrPSc, as the conformational change seems to take place at the cell surface and/or in the endocytic pathway. Real-time measurements of PrPC internalization are, therefore, of high interest and might eventually help identify therapeutic targets against prion diseases. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based methods are widely used for the detection of proteins (12Morrison L.E. Time-resolved detection of energy transfer: theory and application to immunoassays.Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and to validate the proximity of proteins in cells and tissues (13Jares-Erijman E.A. Jovin T.M. FRET imaging.Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). FRET is a quantum-mechanical process that transmits energy from an excited donor molecule to an acceptor molecule, resulting in red-shifted fluorescence emission by the latter (14Selvin P.R. The renaissance of fluorescence resonance energy transfer.Nat Struct Biol. 2000; 7: 730-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Time-resolved FRET methods based on the use of europium and allophycocyanin (APC) as donor and acceptor, respectively, allows for homogeneous-phase assays in the absence of background fluorescence (15Bazin H. Trinquet E. Mathis G. Time resolved amplification of cryptate emission: a versatile technology to trace biomolecular interactions.J. Biotechnol. 2002; 82: 233-250PubMed Google Scholar). The long fluorescence lifetime of europium leads to a high signal-to-noise ratio and is thus suited to high-throughput applications. In the present study we applied the FRET technology to the development of a robust and sensitive quantification assay for PrPC internalization. The assay was designed to detect either cell-surface expression of human PrPC or the internalization rate of PrPC in living cells. For the detection of PrPC on the cell surface, anti-PrP antibodies were added simultaneously, whereas the addition of the two FRET components at different time points enabled the measurement of the endocytosis rate of surface-resident PrPC by signal subtraction. Furthermore, we show that this assay can be used to identify drugs and genes that modulate PrPC surface expression and PrPC endocytosis. We first developed a homogeneous TR-FRET immunoassay for the detection of recombinant mouse PrP (residues 23–231; recPrP) and PrPC in cell lysates. The principle of the assay is shown in Fig. 1. We tested several candidate antibodies from an in-house PrP-targeted antibody collection designated as POM antibodies (16Polymenidou M. Moos R. Scott M. Sigurdson C. Shi Y.Z. Yajima B.

The POM monoclonals: a comprehensive set of antibodies to non-overlapping prion protein epitopes.PLoS ONE. 2008; 3e3872Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and the previously characterized 3F4 antibody (17Bolton D.C.

Virol. 1991; 65: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for their efficiency in this type of assay. Some of these antibodies target linear epitopes in the N-terminal, unstructured “flexible tail” of PrP, whereas others recognize discontinuous, conformational epitopes within the C-terminal globular domain of PrP (18Hornemann S.

Three-dimensional structures of prion proteins.Adv. Protein Chem. 2001; 57: 55-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Antibodies were coupled to the europium chelate (Eu) donor or the APC acceptor fluorophores. Various permutations of antibodies in both donor and acceptor functions were tested for their capability to detect recombinant and normal PrPC in solution. We predicted, and confirmed experimentally, that repetitive binding of the POM2 antibody to the multiple octapeptide repeats of PrP would allow for simultaneously utilization as both the donor and acceptor antibody (Fig. 1). Among the different antibody FRET pairs, the antibody combination POM1-Eu/POM2-APC exhibited a satisfactory dynamic range over 3 logs (125 pg/ml–100 ng/ml) for the detection of recPrP diluted in crude Hpl Prnp−/− cell lysate, an immortalized hippocampal cell derived from Prnp−/− mice (21Sakudo A. Onodera T. Ikuta K. Prion protein gene-deficient cell lines: powerful tools for prion biology.Microbiol. Immunol. 2007; 51: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A), with signal linearity between 0.125 and 8 ng/ml (Fig. 2B). A lower detection limit (LDL) of ≤0.125 ng/ml was determined for the detection of recPrP. We next assessed the specificity of the assay for PrPC. We prepared serial dilutions of murine N2a PK1 cell lysates in Hpl Prnp−/− cell lysates followed by FRET measurement using POM1-Eu/POM2-APC for the detection of PrPC. PrPC was detected in lysates across a wide dynamic range (16–500 μg/ml) (Fig. 2C) with excellent linearity (Fig. 2D). An LDL of ≤ 20 μg/ml of crude cell extract was determined for the detection of PrPC in cells. The performance of the TR-FRET-based immunoassay was further characterized by various validation parameters and their defined acceptance criteria: the coefficient of variance (%CV), the signal-to-noise ratio, and the Z′ factor (22Zhang J.H. Chung T.D. Oldenburg K.R. A Simple statistical parameter for use in evaluation and validation of high throughput screening assays.J. Biomol. Screen. 1999; 4: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (5325) Google Scholar), a widely used indicator for high-throughput suitability. A Z′ factor >0.5 is generally considered sufficient for cell-based high-throughput campaigns. These data are listed in Table 1. Hence, the above data demonstrate a robust and accurate performance of the assay with high specificity, which makes it suitable for the detection of both recPrP and PrPC in high-throughput assays.Table 1Performance of the homogeneous FRET assay for recPrP (upper table) and PrPC from murine N2aPK1 cell lysates (lower table). The assay was evaluated according to three parameters: coefficient of variation (%CV), signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and the Z′ factor. Acceptable values were: %CV values < 10% S/N > 8 and Z′ > 0.5. Open table in a new tab PrPC is present at the surface of neurons and on various non-neuronal tissues and leukocytes (23Aguzzi A. Polymenidou M. Mammalian prion biology: one century of evolving concepts.Cell. 2004; 116: 313-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). To adapt our assay to human cells, we first assessed PrPC expression in several cell lines using a PrPC-specific ELISA (supplemental Fig. S1). The human lung epithelial cell line A549 and HeLa cells were identified as human cell lines with the highest total PrPC expression. To identify the most efficacious antibody pair enabling detection of PrPC by FRET, several POM antibodies were again screened in various combinations of FRET donors and acceptors for A549 cells (supplemental Fig. S2). The FRET pair POM2-Eu/POM2-APC, which binds to the octapeptide repeats (Fig. 1), yielded the highest FRET signals within the POM antibody library. As this antibody pair also yielded a good signal for HeLa cells (supplemental Fig. S2B), we selected it for further use in the assay. We then determined the optimal cell number to be used in the assay by plating different numbers of HeLa and A549 cells, respectively, into 384-well plates. On the following day cells were washed with ice-cold Tris-Krebs buffer and labeled with POM2-Eu/POM2-APC for 30 min at 4 °C. A cell number-dependent FRET signal was detected in a large dynamic range for both human cell lines without (homogeneous time-resolved FRET (HTRF) mode), which is more suited for automated high-throughput screening applications and after washing out unbound antibodies (TR-FRET mode) (Fig. 3A), whereas no signal was obtained for PrP-deficient cells (Hpl Prnp−/−) used as negative control. These results confirmed the specificity of the assay. For A549 cells, a linear dynamic range was found between 500 and 4000 cells/well (R2 = 0.69) (Fig. 3, B and C) in HTRF mode. The linear correlation was improved (R2 = 0.94) in TR-FRET mode (Fig. 3, D and E). Similar results were obtained when titrating numbers of HeLa cells using the same antibody pair (Fig. 3, F and H). Again, essentially linear dynamic ranges were found from 500 to 8000 cells/well in the HTRF mode (R2 = 0.90) and in the TR-FRET mode (R2 = 0.98) (Fig. 3, G and I). For both cell lines and in both measurement modes, 500 cells were sufficient to generate a statistically reliable FRET signal. Conventional assay performance acceptance criteria (Z′ factors of >0.5, coefficient of variance values of <10%, signal-to-noise ratio values of >8) were achieved for HeLa cells in the range of 8,000 to 32,000 cells in TR-FRET and HTRF mode and for A549 in the range of 2,000 to 32,000 cells in TR-FRET and 32K cells in HTRF mode (Table 2). These data validated the assay as a robust and accurate assay for the detection of cell surface PrPC on intact cells under these conditions.Table 2Assay performance of the cell-surface FRET assay in the HTRF mode (without washing steps) and TR-FRET mode (after washing) in A549 (upper tables) and HeLa cells (lower tables) was assessed by three parameters: coefficient of variation (%CV), signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and the Z′ factor. Acceptable values were: %CV values < 10%, S/N > 8 and Z′ > 0.5. K: cell number in thousands. Open table in a new tab We then assessed the applicability of the assay to the detection of cell-surface PrPC. 500 intact, viable cells were preincubated with varying concentrations of unlabeled POM2 antibody. After removing unbound POM2 by washing, cells were incubated with labeled POM2-Eu/POM2-APC. Results in the HTRF (Fig. 4A) and TR-FRET mode (Fig. 4B) showed an increase in the FRET signal intensity with decreasing concentrations of unlabeled POM2 antibody, as expected from binding site saturation by competing antibodies. To control the level of PrPC cell-surface expression on intact cells, the GPI anchor of PrPC was enzymatically cleaved with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). A549 cells were initially labeled with POM2-Eu/POM2-APC and exposed to different concentrations of PI-PLC. FRET signals of cell-surface retained and released PrPCs were measured after transferring the supernatant into a new plate (Fig. 4, C and D). With increasing PI-PLC concentrations, we found decreasing levels of surface PrPC and elevated levels of PrPC in the supernatant. To monitor cytotoxicity of PI-PLC exposure on A549 cells, we established an alamarBlue® cell viability assay (supplemental Fig. S3). No effect of PI-PLC treatment on A549 cell viability was detectable (supplemental Fig. S3). We next tested the performance of the assay in detecting the pharmacological manipulation of PrPC surface expression in living HeLa and A549 cells. Cells were treated with 0–10 μg/ml brefeldin A (BFA) diluted in 0.75% DMSO (24Nebenführ A. Ritzenthaler C. Robinson D.G. Brefeldin A: deciphering an enigmatic inhibitor of secretion.Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1102-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). BFA inhibits the transport of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus and thus reduces their display at the cell surface. We found that a BFA concentration of 1 μg/ml in 0.75% DMSO decreased the PrPC expression level at the cell surface of ∼66% in the HTRF (Fig. 4E) and ∼75% in the TR-FRET mode (Fig. 4F) without affecting the cell viability. Next, we investigated the applicability of our assay to the genetic manipulation of the cell-surface PrPC expression of intact A549 cells. We first used a small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting the human PRNP gene. The PRNP siRNA was also fully functional as shown by qPCR (supplemental Fig. S5) and had no toxic effects on the cells as monitored by the alamarBlue assay (supplemental Fig. S4). We found that the siRNA efficiently down-regulated the expression of PrPC on the surface of living A549 cells in a concentration-dependent manner (p < 0.0001), whereas scrambled siRNAs used as negative controls had no significant effect on PrPC expression (Fig. 4G). Complete suppression was reached at a concentration of 50–100 nm siRNA, as shown by a comparison of the Net-FRET signal to those of Hpl Prnp−/−-deficient cells. These data demonstrate that the assay can be applied to high-throughput pharmacological and genetic PrPC cell-surface manipulation screens. In a next step we modified the assay format toward a PrPC endocytosis assay to assess its suitability for the identification of modifiers controlling the cell-surface expression and endocytosis of PrPC. The principle of the modified assay is shown in Fig. 5A. In a first set of experiments, various antibody combinations and cell culture conditions were tested. Satisfactory results were obtained with A549 cells cultured in DMEM medium (without phenol red, antibiotics and FBS) during endocytosis using the antibody combination POM2-Eu/POM2-APC. After labeling A549 cells with POM2-Eu, free antibodies were removed by washing and endocytosis was induced at 37 °C after 5 min of preincubation. At specified time points (t = 0–70 min) POM2-APC was added to different wells (15 time points in 6 wells). After the last addition of POM2-APC at 70 min, FRET signals were measured for all wells (Fig. 5B). A gradual decrease of Eu-POM2-labeled cell-surface PrPC was observed over time; the decrease was almost linear between 0 and 30 min (R2 = 0.79; Fig. 5C). Similar data were also obtained for HeLa cells (supplemental Fig. S6A). We found that PrPC undergoes endocytosis also when antibodies are added in a reversed order (supplemental Fig. S6B). The endocytosis rate of PrPC was calculated for A549 cells according to the endocytosis index formula (see “Experimental procedures”). After 30 min of incubation, 80% of cell-surface-resident PrPC was endocytosed (Fig. 5D), which is in agreement with previously reported PrPC internalization rates (5Shyng S.L. Huber M.T. Harris D.A. A prion protein cycles between cell surface and an endocytic compartment in cultured neuroblastoma cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15922-15928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We then used the endocytosis assay to gauge the effects of compounds inhibiting clathrin-mediated endocytosis (chlorpromazine/CPZ) and clathrin-independent uptake (methyl-β-cyclodextrin/MβCD) on internalization of PrPC in A549 cells (25Vercauteren D. Vandenbroucke R.E. Jones A.T. Rejman J. Demeester J. De Smedt S.C. Sanders N.N. Braeckmans K. The use of inhibitors to study endocytic pathways of gene carriers: optimization and pitfalls.Mol. Ther. 2010; 18: 561-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). CPZ causes clathrin lattices to assemble on endosomal membranes and prevents the assembly of coated pits at the plasma membrane (26Wang L.H. Rothberg K.G. Anderson R.G. Mis-assembly of clathrin lattices on endosomes reveals a regulatory switch for coated pit formation.J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar), whereas MβCD selectively extracts cholesterol from the plasma membrane (27Klein U. Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. Alteration of the myometrial plasma membrane cholesterol content with β-cyclodextrin modulates the binding affinity of the oxytocin receptor.Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13784-13793Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Cells were pretreated for 30 min with CPZ or MβCD in a dose-dependent manner and subsequently labeled with POM2-Eu (Fig. 6). After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, POM2-APC was added, and inhibition of PrPC uptake was assayed by TR-FRET. Fig. 6A represents the internalization of PrPC in A549 cells in the presence of CPZ. CPZ decreased the entry of PrPC in A549 cells in a dose-dependent manner. A concentration of 0.28 μm CPZ was sufficient to block clathrin-mediated endocytosis of PrPC without affecting the cell viability of A549 cells as determined in an alamarBlue assay (Fig. 6B). On the other hand, a concentration of 5 mm MβCD inhibited the uptake of PrPC without any toxic effect on cell viability as monitored by an alamarBlue assay (Fig. 6, C and D). The combination of CPZ and any inhibitor blocking clathrin-mediated internalization did not cause any further decrease in the uptake of PrPC. These data support recent findings on MβCD in initiating PrPC endocytosis (28Luo K. Li S. Xie M. Wu D. Wang W. Chen R. Huang L. Huang T. Pang D. Xiao G. Real-time visualization of prion transport in single live cells using quantum dots.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 394: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and the importance of cholesterol for the endocytosis of PrPC (29Rodal S.K. Skretting G. Garred O. Vilhardt F. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Extraction of cholesterol with methyl-β-cyclodextrin perturbs formation of clathrin-coated endocytic vesicles.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 961-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar) as well as the inhibitory effect of CPZ on the internalization of PrPC (30Sarnataro D. Caputo A. Casanova P. Puri C. Paladino S.

Lipid rafts and clathrin cooperate in the internalization of PrP in epithelial FRT cells.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4e5829Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Next, the potential of the endocytosis assay toward genetic manipulations was tested by using seven hand-picked siRNAs targeting major proteins of the membrane-trafficking machinery and their downstream organelles (Fig. 7 and Table 3). We expected that some of these siRNAs would modify the endocytosis rate and cell-surface expression of PrPC, resulting in a reduced FRET signal. The efficacy of PRNP knock-down was again controlled using a siRNA targeting the PRNP gene, whereas untreated cells acted as a negative control. The functionality of the siRNAs was verified by quantitative PCR (supplemental Fig. S5), and potential toxic effects of the siRNAs to the cells were controlled by performing cell viability assays (supplemental Fig. S4).Table 3Overview of the tested siRNAs on PrPC endocytosis rate and cell-surface levelAbbreviationDescriptionAP2M1Encodes the adaptor protein 2 (AP-2), which is involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosisEHD1Encodes the EH domain-containing protein 1, plays a role in endocytosisGIT2Encodes the ARF GTPase-activating protein GIT2M6PREncodes the mannose 6-phosphate receptor, interacts with AP1 clathrin adaptor complexRAB5AG-protein, required for the fusion of plasma membrane an early endosomesVPS28Encodes the vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 28 homolog, involved in endosomal sorting of cell-surface receptorsVPS35Encodes the vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 35 homolog, involved in retrograde transport of proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network Open table in a new tab We found that knockdown of the small GTPase protein RAB5a, which controls clathrin-dependent endocytosis (31Lanzetti L.

https://openalex.org/W2601793983,"Mammalian cell culture is indispensable for most aspects of current biomedical research. Immortalized cell lines are very convenient, but transforming principles (e.g. oncogenic viruses or their oncogenes) can heavily influence the experimental outcome. Primary cells do not share this apparent disadvantage but are more laborious to generate. Certain viruses (e.g. mouse cytomegalovirus) do not replicate efficiently in most transformed cell lines. In the past, such viruses have been routinely propagated on primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) established around day 17 (d17) of gestation. According to new regulations of the European Union, experiments using gravid mammals and/or their embryos in the last trimester (>d14 in the case of mice) of gestation do require explicit permission of the local authorities responsible for animal care and use. Applying for such permission is time-consuming and often inflexible. Embryonic fibroblasts could also be produced at earlier time points of pregnancy from younger and smaller embryos. Obviously, this approach consumes more pregnant mice and embryos. Newborn mice are larger thus yielding more cells per sacrificed animal and the new Directive (2010/63/EU) excludes the killing of animals solely for the use of their organs or tissues. We established a convenient protocol to generate adherent mouse newborn cells (MNC). A direct comparison of MNC with MEF revealed that MNC fully recapitulate all tested aspects of a broad panel of virological parameters (plaque size, final titers, viral replication kinetics, viral gene expression, drug and interferon susceptibility as well as species specificity). The herein described approach allows researchers the legal use of primary cells and contributes to the 3R (replace, reduce, refine) guiding principles—especially the ‘reduce’ aspect—for the use of animals in scientific research. Additionally, it offers the option to directly compare in vitro and in vivo experiments when MNC are generated from littermates of animals included in the in vivo experiments."

We optimized a high-throughput qPCR system that allows simultaneous quantitative detection of Lc. lactis 936 (now SK1virus), P335, c2 (now C2virus) and Leuconostoc phage groups. Component assays are designed to have high efficiencies and nearly the same dynamic detection ranges, i.e., from ~1.1 x 105 to ~1.1 x 101 phage genomes per reaction, which corresponds to ~9 x 107 to ~9 x 103 phage particles mL-1 without any additional up-concentrating steps. The amplification efficiencies of the corresponding assays were 100.1±2.6, 98.7±2.3, 101.0±2.3 and 96.2±6.2. The qPCR system was tested on samples obtained from a dairy plant that employed traditional mother-bulk-cheese vat system. High levels of 936 and P335 phages were detected in the mother culture and the bulk starter, but also in the whey samples. Low levels of phages were detected in the cheese milk samples."
https://openalex.org/W2599989316,"This study is a comparative analysis of samples of archived (stored for over 70–90 years) and modern soils of two different genetic types–chernozem and sod-podzolic soils. We revealed a reduction in biodiversity of archived soils relative to their modern state. Particularly, long-term storage in the museum exerted a greater impact on the microbiomes of sod-podzolic soils, while chernozem samples better preserved the native community. Thus, the persistence of microbial DNA in soil is largely determined by the physico-chemical characteristics that differ across soil types. Chernozems create better conditions for the long-term DNA preservation than sod-podzolic soils. This results in supposedly higher levels of biodiversity conservation in the microbiomes of chernozem with preservation of major microbial taxa dominant in the modern (control) soil samples, which makes archived chernozems a promising object for paleosoil studies."
https://openalex.org/W2601786626,"Cystic Fibrosis is the most common lethal autosomal recessive disorder in the white population, affecting among other organs, the lung, the pancreas and the liver. Whereas Cystic Fibrosis is a monogenic disease, many studies reveal a very complex relationship between genotype and clinical phenotype. Indeed, the broad phenotypic spectrum observed in Cystic Fibrosis is far from being explained by obvious genotype-phenotype correlations and it is admitted that Cystic Fibrosis disease is the result of multiple factors, including effects of the environment as well as modifier genes. Our objective was to highlight new modifier genes with potential implications in the lung, pancreatic and liver outcomes of the disease. For this purpose we performed a system biology approach which combined, database mining, literature mining, gene expression study and network analysis as well as pathway enrichment analysis and protein-protein interactions. We found that IFI16, CCNE2 and IGFBP2 are potential modifiers in the altered lung function in Cystic Fibrosis. We also found that EPHX1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, DSP and SLC33A1, GPNMB, NCF2, RASGRP1, LGALS3 and PTPN13, are potential modifiers in pancreas and liver, respectively. Associated pathways indicate that immune system is likely involved and that Ubiquitin C is probably a central node, linking Cystic Fibrosis to liver and pancreatic disease. We highlight here new modifier genes with potential implications in Cystic Fibrosis. Nevertheless, our in silico analysis requires functional analysis to give our results a physiological relevance."

https://openalex.org/W2599418466,"Knee joint pain is a common symptom in obese individuals and walking is often prescribed as part of management programs. Past studies in obese individuals have focused on standing alignment and kinematics in the sagittal and coronal planes. Investigation of 6 degree-of-freedom (6DOF) knee joint kinematics during standing and gait is important to thoroughly understand knee function in obese individuals with knee pain. This study aimed to investigate the 6DOF knee joint kinematics in standing and during gait in obese patients using a validated fluoroscopic imaging system. Ten individuals with obesity and knee pain were recruited. While standing, the knee was in 7.4±6.3°of hyperextension, 2.8±3.3° of abduction and 5.6±7.3° of external rotation. The femoral center was located 0.7±3.1mm anterior and 5.1±1.5mm medial to the tibial center. During treadmill gait, the sagittal plane motion, i.e., flexion/extension and anterior-posterior translation, showed a clear pattern. Specifically, obese individuals with knee pain maintained the knee in more flexion and more anterior tibial translation during most of the stance phase of the gait cycle and had a reduced total range of knee flexion when compared to a healthy non-obese group. In conclusion, obese individuals with knee pain used hyperextension knee posture while standing, but maintained the knee in more flexion during gait with reduced overall range of motion in the 6DOF analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2598243534,"Newcastle disease virus (NDV) causes a devastating poultry disease worldwide. Frequent outbreaks of NDV in chickens vaccinated with conventional live vaccines suggest a need to develop new vaccines that are genetically matched against circulating NDV strains, such as the genotype V virulent strains currently circulating in Mexico and Central America. In this study, a reverse genetics system was developed for the virulent NDV strain Mexico/01/10 strain and used to generate highly attenuated vaccine candidates by individually modifying the cleavage site sequence of fusion (F) protein. The cleavage site sequence of parental virus was individually changed to those of the avirulent NDV strain LaSota and other serotypes of avian paramyxoviruses (APMV serotype-2, -3, -4, -6, -7, -8, and -9). In general, these mutations affected cell-to-cell fusion activity in vitro and the efficiency of the F protein cleavage and made recombinant Mexico/01/10 (rMex) virus highly attenuated in chickens. When chickens were immunized with the rMex mutant viruses and challenged with the virulent parent virus, there was reduced challenge virus shedding compared to birds immunized with the heterologous vaccine strain LaSota. Among the vaccine candidates, rMex containing the cleavage site sequence of APMV-2 induced the highest neutralizing antibody titer and completely protected chickens from challenge virus shedding. These results show the role of the F protein cleavage site sequence of each APMV type in generating genotype V-matched vaccines and the efficacy of matched vaccine strains to provide better protection against NDV strains currently circulating in Mexico."
https://openalex.org/W2598954840,"Dystrophin-deficient dogs are by far the best available large animal models for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the most common lethal childhood muscle degenerative disease. The use of the canine DMD model in basic disease mechanism research and translational studies will be greatly enhanced with the development of reliable outcome measures. Electrical impedance myography (EIM) is a non-invasive painless procedure that provides quantitative data relating to muscle composition and histology. EIM has been extensively used in neuromuscular disease research in both human patients and rodent models. Recent studies suggest that EIM may represent a highly reliable and convenient outcome measure in DMD patients and the mdx mouse model of DMD. To determine whether EIM can be used as a biomarker of disease severity in the canine model, we performed the assay in fourteen young (~6.6-m-old; 6 normal and 8 affected) and ten mature (~16.9-m-old; 4 normal and 6 affected) dogs of mixed background breeds. EIM was well tolerated with good inter-rater reliability. Affected dogs showed higher resistance, lower reactance and phase. The difference became more straightforward in mature dogs. Importantly, we observed a statistically significant correlation between the EIM data and muscle fibrosis. Our results suggest that EIM is a valuable objective measurement in the canine DMD model."

https://openalex.org/W2603499113,"Background Poor and middle-income Thai people rely heavily on primary care health services. These are staffed by a range of professionals. However, it is unknown whether the performance of primary care varies according to the staffing and organization of local service delivery units. Tambon (sub-district) health promotion hospitals (THPHs) were introduced in 2009 to upgrade the services offered by the previous health centres, but were faced with continuing shortages of doctors and nurses. The Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) designated three categories of THPH, defined according to whether they were regularly staffed by a medical practitioner, a qualified nurse or non-clinical public health officers. This study aimed to compare the performance of primary care offered by the three different types of primary care facilities in one public health region of Northern Thailand (Public Health Region 2). Methods A cross-sectional survey was undertaken in 2013. Data were collected on accessibility, continuity, comprehensiveness, co-ordination and community orientation of care from 825 patients attending 23 primary care facilities. These were selected to include the three officially-designated types of Tambon (sub-district) health promotion hospitals (THPHs) led by medical, nursing or public health personnel. Survey scores were compared in unadjusted and adjusted analyses. Results THPHs staffed only by public health officers achieved the highest performance score (Mean = 85.14, SD. = 7.30), followed by THPHs staffed by qualified nurses (Mean = 82.86, SD. = 7.06). THPHs staffed by a doctor on rotation returned the lowest scores (Mean = 81.63, SD. = 7.22). Conclusions Differences in overall scores resulted mainly from differences in reported accessibility, continuity, and comprehensiveness of care, rather than staff skill-mix per se. Policy on quality improvement should therefore focus on improving performance in these areas."
https://openalex.org/W2599649446,"Preharvest sprouting reduces the maize quality and causes a significant yield loss in maize production. vp-wl2 is a Mutator (Mu)-induced viviparous mutant in maize, causing white or pale yellow kernels, dramatically reduced carotenoid and ABA content, and a high level of zeta-carotene accumulation. Here, we reported the cloning of the vp-wl2 gene using a modified digestion-ligation-amplification method (DLA). The results showed that an insertion of Mu9 in the first intron of the zeta-carotene desaturase (ZDS) gene results in the vp-wl2 mutation. Previous studies have suggested that ZDS is likely the structural gene of the viviparous9 (vp9) locus. Therefore, we performed an allelic test using vp-wl2 and three vp9 mutants. The results showed that vp-wl2 is a novel allele of the vp9 locus. In addition, the sequences of ZDS gene were identified in these three vp9 alleles. The vp-wl2 mutant gene was subsequently introgressed into four maize inbred lines, and a viviparous phenotype was observed with yield losses from 7.69% to 13.33%."
https://openalex.org/W2600972452,"Vasomotion is spontaneous or induced rhythmic changes in vascular tone or vessel diameter that lead to rhythmic changes in flow. While the vascular research community debates the physiological and pathophysiological consequence of vasomotion, there is a great need for experimental techniques that can address the role and dynamical properties of vasomotion in vivo. We apply laser speckle imaging to study spontaneous and drug induced vasomotion in retinal network of anesthetized rats. The results reveal a wide variety of dynamical patterns. Wavelet-based analysis shows that (i) spontaneous vasomotion occurs in anesthetized animals and (ii) vasomotion can be initiated by systemic administration of the thromboxane analogue U-46619 and the nitric-oxide donor S-nitroso-acetylDL-penicillamine (SNAP). Although these drugs activate different cellular pathways responsible for vasomotion, our approach can track the dynamical changes they cause."
https://openalex.org/W2603294923,"Paired-box family member PAX8 encodes a transcription factor that has a role in cell differentiation and cell growth and may participate in the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). By bioinformatics analysis, we identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within a newly identified long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) AC016683.6 as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for PAX8. Hence, we hypothesized that PAX8eQTLs in lncRNA AC016683.6 may influence the HCC prognosis. We then performed a case-only study to assess the association between the two SNPs as well as the prognosis of HCC in 331 HBV-positive HCC patients without surgical treatment. Cox proportional hazard models were used for survival analysis with adjustments for the age, gender, smoking status, drinking status, Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage, and chemotherapy or TACE (transcatheter hepatic arterial chemoembolization) status. We found that the G allele of rs1110839 and the T allele of rs4848320 in PAX8was significantly associated with a better prognosis compared with the T allele of rs1110839 and the C allele of rs4848320 (adjusted HR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.61–0.91, P = 0.004 for rs1110839 and adjusted HR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.54–0.94, P = 0.015 for rs4848320 in the additive model). Furthermore, the combined effect of the variant genotypes for these two SNPs was more prominent in patients with the BCLC-C stage orpatients with chemotherapy or TACE. Although the exact biological function remains to be explored, our findings suggest a possible association of PAX8eQTLs in lncRNA AC016683.6 with the HCC prognosis inthe Chinese population. Further large and functional studies are needed to confirm our findings."
https://openalex.org/W2599054208,"The roll-out of medical male circumcision (MC) is progressing in Southern and Eastern Africa. Little is known about the effect of this roll-out on women. The objective of this study was to assess the knowledge and perceptions of women regarding MC in a setting before and after the roll-out. This study was conducted in the South African township of Orange Farm where MC prevalence among men increased from 17% to 53% in the period 2008-2010. Data from three community-based cross sectional surveys conducted in 2007, 2010 and 2012 among 1258, 1197 and 2583 adult women, respectively were studied. In 2012, among 2583 women, 73.7% reported a preference for circumcised partners, and 87.9% knew that circumcised men could become infected with HIV. A total of 95.8% preferred to have their male children circumcised. These three proportions increased significantly during the roll-out. In 2007, the corresponding values were 64.4%, 82.9% and 80.4%, respectively. Among 2581 women having had sexual intercourse with circumcised and uncircumcised men, a majority (55.8%, 1440/2581) agreed that it was easier for a circumcised man to use a condom, 20.5% (530/2581) disagreed; and 23.07 (611/2581) did not know. However, some women incorrectly stated that they were fully (32/2579; 1.2%; 95%CI: 0.9% to 1.7%) or partially (233/2579; 9.0%; 95%CI: 8.0% to 10.2%) protected when having unprotected sex with a circumcised HIV-positive partner. This study shows that the favorable perception of women and relatively correct knowledge regarding VMMC had increased during the roll-out of VMMC. When possible, women should participate in the promotion of VMMC although further effort should be made to improve their knowledge."
https://openalex.org/W2600449517,"Vascular remodeling during chronic hypertension may impair the supply of tissues with oxygen, glucose and other compounds, potentially unleashing deleterious effects. In this study, we used Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats with or without pharmacological inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 by an experimental compound L-2286, to evaluate carotid artery remodeling and consequent damage of neuronal tissue during hypertension. We observed elevated oxidative stress and profound thickening of the vascular wall with fibrotic tissue accumulation induced by elevated blood pressure. 32 weeks of L-2286 treatment attenuated these processes by modulating mitogen activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 cellular levels in carotid arteries. In hypertensive animals, vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction was observed by NF-κB nuclear accumulation and impaired vasodilation to acetylcholine, respectively. Pharmacological poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 inhibition interfered in these processes and mitigated Apoptosis Inducing Factor dependent cell death events, thus improved structural and functional alterations of carotid arteries, without affecting blood pressure. Chronic poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 inhibition protected neuronal tissue against oxidative damage, assessed by nitrotyrosine, 4-hydroxinonenal and 8-oxoguanosine immunohistochemistry in the area of Cornu ammonis 1 of the dorsal hippocampus in hypertensive rats. In this area, extensive pyramidal cell loss was also attenuated by treatment with lowered poly(ADP-ribose)polymer formation. It also preserved the structure of fissural arteries and attenuated perivascular white matter lesions and reactive astrogliosis in hypertensive rats. These data support the premise in which chronic poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 inhibition has beneficial effects on hypertension related tissue damage both in vascular tissue and in the hippocampus by altering signaling events, reducing oxidative/nitrosative stress and inflammatory status, without lowering blood pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2600326572,"The RNA editing occurring in plant organellar genomes mainly involves the change of cytidine to uridine. This process involves a deamination reaction, with cytidine deaminase as the catalyst. Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins with a C-terminal DYW domain are reportedly associated with cytidine deamination, similar to members of the deaminase superfamily. PPR genes are involved in many cellular functions and biological processes including fertility restoration to cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) in plants. In this study, we identified 227 and 211 DYW deaminase-coding PPR genes for the cultivated tetraploid cotton species G. hirsutum and G. barbadense (2n = 4x = 52), respectively, as well as 126 and 97 DYW deaminase-coding PPR genes in the ancestral diploid species G. raimondii and G. arboreum (2n = 26), respectively. The 227 G. hirsutum PPR genes were predicted to encode 52–2016 amino acids, 203 of which were mapped onto 26 chromosomes. Most DYW deaminase genes lacked introns, and their proteins were predicted to target the mitochondria or chloroplasts. Additionally, the DYW domain differed from the complete DYW deaminase domain, which contained part of the E domain and the entire E+ domain. The types and number of DYW tripeptides may have been influenced by evolutionary processes, with some tripeptides being lost. Furthermore, a gene ontology analysis revealed that DYW deaminase functions were mainly related to binding as well as hydrolase and transferase activities. The G. hirsutum DYW deaminase expression profiles varied among different cotton tissues and developmental stages, and no differentially expressed DYW deaminase-coding PPRs were directly associated with the male sterility and restoration in the CMS-D2 system. Our current study provides an important piece of information regarding the structural and evolutionary characteristics of Gossypium DYW-containing PPR genes coding for deaminases and will be useful for characterizing the DYW deaminase gene family in cotton biology and breeding."
https://openalex.org/W2600788100,"Background While community distribution of topical repellents has been proposed as an additional malaria control intervention, the safety of this intervention at the population level remains poorly evaluated. We describe the safety of mass distribution of the picaridin repellent during a cluster-randomised trial in rural Cambodia in 2012–2013. Methods The repellent was distributed among 57 intervention villages with around 25,000 inhabitants by a team of village distributors. Information on individual adverse events, reported by phone by the village distributors, was obtained through home visits. Information on perceived side effects, reported at the family level, was obtained during two-weekly bottle exchange. Adverse events were classified as adverse reactions (events likely linked to the repellent), cases of repellent abuse and events not related to the repellent use, and classified as per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Findings Of the 41 adverse events notified by phone by the village distributors, there were 22 adverse reactions, 11 cases of repellent abuse (6 accidental, 5 suicide attempts) and 8 non-related events. All adverse reactions were mild, occurred in the first few months of use, and mainly manifested as skin conditions. Of the 11 cases of abuse, 2 were moderate and 2 life-threatening. All cases with adverse reactions and repellent abuse recovered completely. 20% of families reported perceived side effects, mainly itching, headache, dizziness and bad smell, but few discontinued repellent use. Conclusions Adverse reactions and abuse during mass use of picaridin were uncommon and generally mild, supporting the safety of the picaridin repellent for malaria control."
https://openalex.org/W2598969210,"Intra-arterial (IA) vasodilator therapy is one of the recommended treatments to minimize the impact of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage-induced cerebral vasospasm refractory to standard management. However, its usefulness and efficacy is not well established. We evaluated the effect IA vasodilator therapy on middle cerebral artery blood flow and on discharge outcome. We reviewed records for 115 adults admitted to Neurointensive Care Unit to test whether there was a difference in clinical outcome (discharge mRS) in those who received IA infusions. In a subset of 19 patients (33 vessels) treated using IA therapy, we tested whether therapy was effective in reversing the trends in blood flow. All measures of MCA blood flow increased from day -2 to -1 before infusion (maximum Peak Systolic Velocity (PSV) 232.2±9.4 to 262.4±12.5 cm/s [p = 0.02]; average PSV 202.1±8.5 to 229.9±10.9 [p = 0.02]; highest Mean Flow Velocity (MFV) 154.3±8.3 to 172.9±10.5 [p = 0.10]; average MFV 125.5±6.3 to 147.8±9.5 cm/s, [p = 0.02]) but not post-infusion (maximum PSV 261.2±14.6 cm/s [p = .89]; average PSV 223.4±11.4 [p = 0.56]; highest MFV 182.9±12.4 cm/s [p = 0.38]; average MFV 153.0±10.2 cm/s [p = 0.54]). After IA therapy, flow velocities were consistently reduced (day X infusion interaction p<0.01 for all measures). However, discharge mRS was higher in IA infusion group, even after adjusting for sex, age, and admission grades. Thus, while IA vasodilator therapy was effective in reversing the vasospasm-mediated deterioration in blood flow, clinical outcomes in the treated group were worse than the untreated group. There is need for a prospective randomized controlled trial to avoid potential confounding effect of selection bias."

https://openalex.org/W2602138598,"Cell cycle arrest can be imposed by inactivating the anaphase promoting complex (APC). In S. cerevisiae this arrest has been reported to stabilize a metaphase-like intermediate in which the nuclear envelope spans the bud neck, while chromatin repeatedly translocates between the mother and bud domains. The present investigation was undertaken to learn how other features of nuclear organization are affected upon depletion of the APC activator, Cdc20. We observe that the spindle pole bodies and the spindle repeatedly translocate across the narrow orifice at the level of the neck. Nevertheless, we find that the nucleolus (organized around rDNA repeats on the long right arm of chromosome XII) remains in the mother domain, marking the polarity of the nucleus. Accordingly, chromosome XII is polarized: TelXIIR remains in the mother domain and its centromere is predominantly located in the bud domain. In order to learn why the nucleolus remains in the mother domain, we studied the impact of inhibiting rRNA synthesis in arrested cells. We observed that this fragments the nucleolus and that these fragments entered the bud domain. Taken together with earlier observations, the restriction of the nucleolus to the mother domain therefore can be attributed to its massive structure. We also observed that inactivation of septins allowed arrested cells to complete the cell cycle, that the alternative APC activator, Cdh1, was required for completion of the cell cycle and that induction of Cdh1 itself caused arrested cells to progress to the end of the cell cycle."

While most antiretrovirals are considered safe in pregnancy, monitoring for rare pregnancy and infant adverse outcomes is warranted. Methods We conducted a retrospective secondary analysis nested within a clinical trial of infant cotrimoxazole vs. placebo prophylaxis in Botswana (the Mpepu Study). Infants were examined at birth, and at least every 3 months through 18 months of age. Abnormal physical findings and diagnostic testing revealing malformations were documented. Post hoc, a geneticist classified all reported malformations based on available documentation. Structural malformations with surgical, medical or cosmetic importance were classified as major malformations. We present a descriptive analysis of identified malformations. Results Between 2011 and 2014, 2,933 HIV-infected women who enrolled in the Mpepu study delivered 2,971 live-born infants. Study staff conducted 2,944 (99%) newborn exams. One thousand eighty-eight (38%) women were taking ART at conception; 1,147 (40%) started ART during pregnancy; 442 (15%) received zidovudine monotherapy; and 223 (7%) received no antiretroviral during pregnancy. Of 33 reported anomalies, 25 (76%) met congenital malformations criteria, 10 (30%) were classified as major malformations, 4 (40%) of which were identified after the birth exam. Discussion Our results highlight the importance of staff training on identification of congenital malformations, programmatic monitoring beyond the birth examination and the value of geneticist involvement in the malformations classification process in resource-limited settings. These elements will be important to fully define antiretroviral drug safety in pregnancy. Significance Surveillance systems for monitoring the safety of antiretroviral use during pregnancy among HIV-infected women in resource-limited setting are lacking. The World Health Organization’s published programmatic recommendations for such surveillance systems represents the gold standard. We employed data from a clinical trial in Botswana, a country with a generalized HIV epidemic and high antiretroviral uptake by HIV-infected women, to highlight practical opportunities to strengthen congenital malformation surveillance systems in these settings where over 1 million HIV infected pregnant women reside.

https://openalex.org/W2601507417,"Given their powerful feature representation for recognition, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have been driving rapid advances in high-level computer vision tasks. However, their performance in semantic image segmentation is still not satisfactory. Based on the analysis of visual mechanism, we conclude that DCNNs in a bottom-up manner are not enough, because semantic image segmentation task requires not only recognition but also visual attention capability. In the study, superpixels containing visual attention information are introduced in a top-down manner, and an extensible architecture is proposed to improve the segmentation results of current DCNN-based methods. We employ the current state-of-the-art fully convolutional network (FCN) and FCN with conditional random field (DeepLab-CRF) as baselines to validate our architecture. Experimental results of the PASCAL VOC segmentation task qualitatively show that coarse edges and error segmentation results are well improved. We also quantitatively obtain about 2%-3% intersection over union (IOU) accuracy improvement on the PASCAL VOC 2011 and 2012 test sets."
https://openalex.org/W2603499370,"A well-managed chemical nitrogen (N) fertilization practice combined with treated swine slurry (TSS) is necessary to improve sustainability and N use efficiency in rice farming. However, little is known about the fate of N derived from chemical N fertilizer with and without TSS in paddy soil-plant systems. The objectives of this study were (1) to estimate the contribution of applied N fertilizer to N turnover in rice paddy soil with different N fertilization practices that were manipulated by the quantity of treated swine slurry and chemical N fertilizer (i.e., HTSS+LAS, a high amount of TSS with a low amount of ammonium sulfate; LTSS+HAS, a low amount of TSS with a high amount of ammonium sulfate; AS, ammonium sulfate with phosphorus and potassium; C, the control) and (2) to compare the rice response to applied N derived from each N fertilization practice. Rice biomass yield, 15N recovery in both rice grain and stems, soil total N (TN), soil inorganic N, and soil 15N recovery were analyzed. Similar amounts of 15N uptake by rice in the TSS+AS plots were obtained, indicating that the effects of the different quantities of TSS on chemical fertilizer N recovery in rice during the experimental period were not significant. The soil 15N recoveries of HTSS+LAS, LTSS+HAS, and AS in each soil layer were not significantly different. For the HTSS+LAS, LTSS+HAS and AS applications, total 15N recoveries were 42%, 43% and 54%, respectively. Because the effects of reducing the use of chemical N fertilizer were attributed to enhancing soil quality and cost-effectiveness, HTSS+LAS could be an appropriate N fertilization practice for improving the long-term sustainability of paddy soil-plant systems. However, N losses, especially through the coupled nitrification-denitrification process, can diminish the benefits that HTSS+LAS offers."
https://openalex.org/W2600080955,"People ascribe purposeful behaviour to the movements of artificial objects and social qualities to human body motion. We investigated how people associate simple motion cues with social categories. For a first rating-experiment we converted the body movements of speakers into stick-figure animations; for a second rating-experiment we used animations of one single dot. Rating-experiments were ""reversed"" because we asked participants to alter the movements (i.e., vertical amplitude, horizontal amplitude, and velocity) of the stimuli according to different instructions (e.g., create a stimulus of high dominance). Participants equipped stick figures and dot animations with expansive movements to represent high dominance. Expansive and fast movements (i.e., high velocity) were mainly associated with high aggressiveness. Fast movements were also associated with low friendliness, low trustworthiness, and low competence. Overall, patterns found for stick figure and dot animations were similar indicating that certain motion cues convey social information even when only a dot and no body form is visible. The ""reverse approach"" we propose here makes the impact of different components directly observable. The data generated by this method offers better insights into the interplay of these components and the ways in which they form meaningful patterns. The proposed method can be extended to other types of nonverbal cues and a variety of social categories."
