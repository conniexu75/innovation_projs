https://openalex.org/W2084491525,"When human lymphocytes were cultured with [3H]thymidine, which acts as a source of low-level chronic radiation, and then exposed to 150 rad of x-rays at 5, 7, 9, or 11 hours before fixation, the yield of chromatid aberrations was less than the sum of the yields of aberrations induced by [3H]thymidine and x-rays separately. Often fewer aberrations were found after exposure to radiation from both sources than were found after exposure to x-rays alone. At the same fixation times, nonradioactive thymidine did not affect the yield of x-ray-induced aberrations. The same phenomenon occurred at earlier fixation times, after exposure to 30 or 40 rad of x-rays and [3H]thymidine. This response is analogous to the adaptive response to alkylating agents whereby prior treatment with small doses for a long period reduces the damage occurring from large doses of similar agents given for a short time."

https://openalex.org/W1992409084,"A single genetic alteration, a guanine-to-cytosine transversion, is responsible for the acquisition of malignant properties by K-ras genes of two human tumor cell lines established from carcinomas of the bladder (A1698) and lung (A2182). As a consequence, arginine instead of the normal glycine is incorporated into the K-ras-coded p21 proteins at amino acid position 12. This mutation creates a restriction enzyme polymorphism that can be used to screen human cells for transforming K-ras genes. This approach was used to identify the mutational event responsible for the malignant activation of a K-ras oncogene in a squamous cell lung carcinoma of a 66-year-old man; this point mutation was not present in either the normal bronchial or parenchymal tissue or in the blood lymphocytes. Hence, malignant activation of a ras oncogene appears to be specifically associated with the development of a human neoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2053501663,"Human fibroblasts have exhibited enhanced DNA synthesis when exposed to sinusoidally varying magnetic fields for a wide range of frequencies (15 hertz to 4 kilohertz) and amplitudes (2.3 X 10(-6) to 5.6 X 10(-4) tesla). This effect, which is at maximum during the middle of the S phase of the cell cycle, appears to be independent of the time derivative of the magnetic field, suggesting an underlying mechanism other than Faraday's law. The threshold is estimated to be between 0.5 X 10(-5) and 2.5 X 10(-5) tesla per second. These results bring into question the allegedly specific magnetic wave shapes now used in therapeutic devices for bone nonunion. The range of magnetic field amplitudes tested encompass the geomagnetic field, suggesting the possibility of mutagenic interactions directly arising from short-term changes in the earth's field."

https://openalex.org/W2069214847,"The major site of in vivo transcriptional initiation for both heavy and light strands of human mitochondrial DNA is the displacement-loop region. Transcripts synthesized in vitro by human mitochondrial RNA polymerase were mapped to the nucleotide level and have identical 5' end map positions to those reported for in vivo primary transcripts. An ordered series of deletion clones, whose template sequences were truncated at either the 5' or 3' end, was used to identify the precise mitochondrial DNA sequence required for initiation of transcription. The data provide a definitive assignment of the promoter for heavy-strand transcription occurring within -16 to +7 of the transcriptional start site 16 nucleotides upstream of the 5' end of the gene for tRNAPhe and of the promoter for light-strand transcription occurring within -28 to +16 of the transcriptional start site at the 5' end of ""7S RNA."" Within each control sequence is a candidate promoter whose consensus sequence is 5'-CANACC(G)CC(A)AAAGAPyA-3' and in both cases transcriptional initiation occurs within six to eight nucleotides of the 3' end of this sequence. The transcriptional start site is an integral part of each promoter and each promoter can function in the absence of the other."

A maximum velocity of 2 meters per second is generated, corresponding to an acceleration of 40,000g. Thus nematocyst discharge is one of the fastest cellular processes in nature."

In the study described here a new type D retrovirus was isolated from two Macaca cyclopis with this syndrome. This virus is related to, but distinct from, Mason-Pfizer monkey virus, a type D retrovirus previously isolated from a mammary tumor of a rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta)."

https://openalex.org/W2035581733,"Pattern formation and temporal control of gene expression in Xenopus development were investigated using fibronectin as a biochemical marker. We determined the spatial localization of fibronectin in the embryo by immunofluorescence and the temporal program of its expression by biosynthesis studies and Western blotting techniques. At the start of gastrulation, fibronectin is localized on the roof of the blastoccel which serves as the surface upon which mesodermal cells will migrate. However, since we find fibronectin secreted by all parts of the embryo, localization is probably achieved through spatially localized receptors that bind secreted fibronectin. Fibronectin levels and fibronectin synthesis rates increase following the midblastula stage. This increase is independent of transcription and therefore involves activation of maternal RNA for fibronectin. Since this message mobilization also occurs in activated but unfertilized eggs, this event must be regulated separately from the midblastula transition."

https://openalex.org/W2095517820,"The preprotoxin gene of the 1.9 kb M1 dsRNA genome from type I killer yeast has been sequenced employing a partial-length cDNA derived from an in vivo transcript. A single open reading frame, commencing with AUG at M1 dsRNA bases 14-16, terminates with UAG at 963-965 and codes for a 316 amino acid protein, believed to be identical to the 34 kd preprotoxin species, M1-P1, synthesized by in vitro translation of denatured M1 dsRNA. N-terminal sequencing of M1-P1 confirms this prediction. Secreted toxin is shown to consist of two dissimilar, disulfide-bonded subunits, alpha and beta, of apparent size 9.5 and 9.0 kd, respectively, whose N-terminal sequences are also found in the predicted preprotoxin sequence. Its proposed domains consist of delta, a 44 amino acid N-terminal segment, followed by alpha and beta, which are separated by gamma, a large central glycosylated segment. Processing sites, domain functions, and the potential role of gamma in immunity are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2051785495,"Fragments of the proximal half of mouse chromosome 17 including the t-complex region were microdissected from metaphase spreads. DNA was isolated from a pool of such fragments, and was cloned on microscale. Individual clones were used to probe genomic digests of DNA from a pair of Chinese hamster cell lines with or without mouse chromosome 17, and livers of congenic inbred lines of mice carrying wild-type and/or t-haplotype forms of chromosome 17. The data obtained indicate that 95% of the low copy number microclone inserts recognize DNA sequences present on mouse chromosome 17. It has been possible to use one-third of these clones to identify restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms between wild-type and t-haplotype DNA on a congenic background. These results demonstrate that these clones have been derived from the t-complex or regions closely linked to it. Clones of this type should provide starting points for a molecular analysis of this region of the mouse genome."

https://openalex.org/W2055541752,"Infection of susceptible cells by retroviruses results in the synthesis of linear DNA with two long terminal repeats (LTRs), circular DNA with a single LTR, and circular DNA with two tandem LTRs. To determine which of these unintegrated molecules serves as the precursor to the provirus, we inserted into a retrovirus vector a 49 bp fragment containing the junction formed by in vivo blunt-end ligation of two LTRs. Infection of chicken embryo fibroblasts with virus recovered from this vector and subsequent characterization of the proviral DNA revealed that efficient integration can occur from this introduced junction sequence. Therefore, circular DNA with two tandem LTRs is a precursor to the provirus."

Spontaneous rhythmic synaptic events, which were capable of triggering action potential discharge, were observed in many neurons, particularly in mesial tissue slices. Such activity may reflect the epileptogenic capacity of this human cortex."

https://openalex.org/W2027126337,"The transport of sugar residues into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) during glycoprotein synthesis was studied by examining the transmembrane orientations of the oligosaccharide-lipid precursors of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides. Using the lectin concanavalin A, the lipid-linked oligosaccharides Man3–5GIcNAc2 were found on the cytoplasmic side of ER-derived vesicles in vitro while lipid-linked Man6–9GIcNAc2 and GIc1–3Man9GIcNAc2 were found facing the lumen. These results suggest that Man5GlcNAc2-lipid is synthesized on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane and then translocated to the luminal side. Glc3Man9GIcNAc2-lipid is then completed on the luminal side where it serves as the donor in peptide glycosylation. Translocation of Man5GlcNAc2-lipid offers a mechanism for the export of sugar residues from the cytoplasm during glycoprotein synthesis. This translocation may be the reason for the participation of lipid-linked mono- and oligosaccharides in glycoprotein synthesis."

In contrast, DNA from normal cells of the same patient lacked transforming activity, indicating that activation of this transforming gene was the consequence of somatic mutation in the neoplastic cells. The transforming gene product displayed an electrophoretic mobility in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels that differed from the mobilities of rasK transforming proteins in other tumors, indicating that a previously undescribed mutation was responsible for activation of rasK in this ovarian carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2019870812,"Rats underwent Pavlovian defensive conditioning (noise paired with shock) while under general anesthesia. Peripheral administration of epinephrine (0.01 to 1.0 milligram per kilogram of body weight) during training resulted in the acquisition of conditioned fear, as shown 10 days later by conditioned suppression of water drinking. Analysis of heart rate and measurement of reflexes during training indicated that epinephrine did not lighten the state of anesthesia. These results indicate that epinephrine enables the learning of conditioned fear in the anesthetized brain."

https://openalex.org/W1573172298,"Under highly selective conditions, pretreatment of rat liver mitochondria with N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) results in 95% inhibition of K+/H+ antiport. This inhibition is irreversible. The K+/H+ antiporter is reversibly inhibited by physiological (Mg2+ and H+) and pharmacological (quinine and propranolol) inhibitors. Each of these inhibitors protects the K+/H+ antiporter against inhibition by DCCD. DCCD is without effect on Na+/H+ antiport under all conditions tested, confirming our contention that rat liver mitochondria possess two different alkali cation/proton antiporters (Nakashima, R. A., and Garlid, K. D. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 9252-9254). The selective nature of irreversible inhibition by DCCD has enabled us to label and identify the protein responsible for K+/H+ antiport. This protein, the first cation antiporter so identified, migrates on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels with a molecular weight of 82,000."
https://openalex.org/W2058727734,"The properties of several cDNA clones representing a family of mRNAs found in the embryonic ectoderm of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus are described. We have previously shown that these mRNAs (termed Spec for Strongylocentrotus purpuratus ectoderm) accumulate in the presumptive dorsal ectoderm of post-cleavage stage embryos and code for a group of 10 to 12 low molecular weight acidic proteins. We demonstrate here, using antibodies raised against the major Spec proteins, that the proteins are localized in the cytoplasm of dorsal ectoderm cells. Hybridization analysis and DNA sequencing show that the mRNAs coding for these proteins, although all related, can be divided into two subfamilies. Comparison of the translational reading frames of the Spec mRNAs with known protein sequences shows a significant homology with troponin C-related proteins, especially in the calcium-binding domains. We suggest that the Spec proteins are previously uncharacterized members of the troponin C superfamily."

https://openalex.org/W2006109107,"Chloroplast DNAs from the green algae Euglena gracilis and from broad beans (Vicia faba) were hybridized with homologous chloroplast RNA. The hybrids were analyzed by electron microscopy. Almost all transcribed regions of the Euglena genome, except for the rRNA genes, contain intervening sequences. A minimum of 50 introns was observed amounting to about 32 kb of the 145 kb genome. Only four spliced transcripts with a total number of six introns (about 0.8 kb each) were detected in the bean chloroplast RNA. A complete transcription map of the Euglena chloroplast genome was established. Transcribed regions occur on the strand that codes for the rRNAs (plus strand) as well as on the complementary strand (minus strand). The polarity of transcription reverses at least six times."

The results indicate that the pigment consists of ferriprotophorphyrin self-aggregates and a noncovalent complex of ferriprotoporphyrin and protein. Spectra of chloroquine-treated parasites reveal in situ interaction between the drug and ferriprotoporphyrin. Chloroquine-resistant parasites, readily distinguishable by this method, appear to degrade hemoglobin only partially."
https://openalex.org/W2124932324,"Lesions (“ARBs”) generated in metaphase and anaphase central spindles of Hantzschia by an ultraviolet microbeam are devoid of microtubules previously present. In vivo, the poleward transverse edge of the lesion invariably loses birefringence poleward, until this segment has vanished; the loss is slow during metaphase and faster at anaphase. The other transverse edge, proximal to the overlap, remains stable until disassembly of the whole spindle. We conclude that the central spindle microtubules are not in flux during metaphase to telophase, and that depolymerization of these microtubules takes place only from the end distal to the pole, as during normal spindle disassembly. Microtubule polarity and the creation of free ends may determine which microtubules are disassembled during later mitosis and how disassembly proceeds."

https://openalex.org/W1598970788,"A novel Ca2+-binding protein (CBP-18) has been identified and purified from bovine brain. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the purified protein consists of a single band of apparent Mr 18,000 in the presence of Ca2+ or 20,000 in the presence of EGTA. CBP-18 contains one high affinity Ca2+-binding site, measured at 10(-5) M Ca2+ in the presence of 1 mM Mg2+ and 0.1 M K+. The amino acid composition and UV absorption spectrum distinguish CBP-18 from other Ca2+-binding proteins identified in brain. The protein has an extinction coefficient epsilon 1% 279 nm = 4.9 and contains 1 tryptophan/mol, 5 tyrosines/mol, and no trimethyllysine. CBP-18 does not interact with or activate calmodulin-stimulated phosphodiesterase.

https://openalex.org/W1590650864,"The analysis of uteroferrin's iron content by an acid-release method used in previous studies shows a critical dependence on phosphate, i.e. the native phosphate-free enzyme yields two irons/molecule, while enzyme with one tightly bound phosphate gives closer to one iron. In contrast, two irons/molecule of protein are found in samples assayed by a wet ash method. When iron assays are carried out on samples of purple two-iron protein reductively stripped of their phosphate, both methods again yield two iron atoms/molecule. However, the discrepancy between the two methods recurs when phosphate is added to samples of pink protein which were formerly free of phosphate. These results suggest that phosphate bound to native uteroferrin may have interfered with iron determinations in some earlier studies. Furthermore, enzyme samples with one tightly bound phosphate have the optical purity index (i.e.A280/A545 approximately less than 14.0) and extinction coefficient at 280 nm, characteristic of putative one-iron preparations. There is little doubt, therefore, that previous EPR, magnetic susceptibility, and iron titration experiments thought to have been carried out on genuine one-iron preparations were in fact done on samples of two-iron protein bearing a single tightly bound phosphate. Reassessment of earlier studies indicates that the properties of putative one-iron preparations may be reconciled with those of the two-iron phosphate-laden protein studied here."
https://openalex.org/W2078070130,Newborn cats and mice became infected with Alaria marcianae if they nursed from females that had been experimentally infected with the parasite. All lactating females showed mesocercarial stages in their mammary glands. This may be the first trematode found to undergo transmission through the mammary glands under experimental conditions. Similarities in the behavior of mesocercariae in humans and in the mouse suggest that an infected human female might infect her infant if she elected to nurse it.
