https://openalex.org/W3135141008,"Sarcopenia a recognised geriatric syndrome. This study aims to evaluate the prevalence of possible sarcopenia, sarcopenia and severe sarcopenia among older Chinese adults and to identify any associated factors for possible sarcopenia according to the updated diagnostic criteria of the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019 (AWGS 2019). We used data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). The main outcome of this study was possible sarcopenia. Handgrip strength was measured via a dynamometer. The muscle mass was estimated by anthropometric measures. Physical performance was measured by 5-time chair stand test and gait speed test. A multivariate logistic regression model with stepwise method was employed to identify factors associated with possible sarcopenia. A total of 6172 participants aged 60–94 years were included. The prevalence of possible sarcopenia, sarcopenia and severe sarcopenia was 38.5%, 18.6%, and 8.0%, respectively. Age, rural area, falls, higher C-reactive protein (CRP), and chronic diseases (including hypertension, chronic lung diseases, heart disease, psychiatric disease and arthritis) were associated with a higher risk of possible sarcopenia. Conversely, alcohol consumption, higher gait speed and high levels of hemoglobin were associated with decreased risk of possible sarcopenia. However, the associations between possible sarcopenia with alcohol consumption, heart disease, psychiatric disease and hemoglobin were not significant after Bonferroni correction. Our study reported a relatively high prevalence of sarcopenia among older Chinese population, and identified a range of factors associated with sarcopenia. We also found rural elders are more vulnerable to sarcopenia than urban elders. Additionally, we discovered systemic inflammation might be one of the contributing factors between sarcopenia and related comorbidities. We believe the findings of this study would help to identify individuals at high risk of sarcopenia early and therefore implement the prevention and treatment strategies to reduce the disease burden in China."
https://openalex.org/W3133805672,"Background Neutralizing-antibody (nAb) is the major focus of most ongoing COVID-19 vaccine trials. However, nAb response against SARS-CoV-2, when present, decays rapidly. Given the myriad roles of antibodies in immune responses, it is possible that antibodies could also mediate protection against SARS-CoV-2 via effector mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), which we sought to explore here. Methods Plasma of 3 uninfected controls and 20 subjects exposed to, or recovering from, SARS-CoV-2 infection were collected from U.S. and sub-Saharan Africa. Immunofluorescence assay was used to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies in the plasma samples. SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralizing capability of these plasmas was assessed with SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus. ADCC activity was assessed with a calcein release assay. Results SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies were detected in all COVID-19 subjects studied. All but three COVID-19 subjects contained nAb at high potency (&gt;80% neutralization). Plasma from 19/20 of COVID-19 subjects also demonstrated strong ADCC activity against SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, including two individuals without nAb against SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion Both neutralizing and non-neutralizing COVID-19 plasmas can mediate ADCC. Our findings argue that evaluation of potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 should include investigation of the magnitude and durability of ADCC, in addition to nAb."
https://openalex.org/W3135474701,"The impacts of wavelengths in 500–600 nm on plant response and their underlying mechanisms remain elusive and required further investigation. Here, we investigated the effect of light quality on leaf area growth, biomass, pigments content, and net photosynthetic rate (Pn) across three Arabidopsis thaliana accessions, along with changes in transcription, photosynthates content, and antioxidative enzyme activity. Eleven-leaves plants were treated with BL; 450 nm, AL; 595 nm, RL; 650 nm, and FL; 400–700 nm as control. RL significantly increased leaf area growth, biomass, and promoted Pn. BL increased leaf area growth, carotenoid and anthocyanin content. AL significantly reduced leaf area growth and biomass, while Pn remained unaffected. Petiole elongation was further observed across accessions under AL. To explore the underlying mechanisms under AL, expression of key marker genes involved in light-responsive photosynthetic reaction, enzymatic activity of antioxidants, and content of photosynthates were monitored in Col-0 under AL, RL (as contrast), and FL (as control). AL induced transcription of GSH2 and PSBA , while downregulated NPQ1 and FNR2 . Photosynthates, including proteins and starches, showed lower content under AL. SOD and APX showed enhanced enzymatic activity under AL. These results provide insight into physiological and photosynthetic responses to light quality, in addition to identifying putative protective-mechanisms that may be induced to cope with lighting-stress in order to enhance plant stress tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W3135077705,"Contact tracing is a crucial part of the public health surveillance toolkit. However, it is labor-intensive and costly to carry it out. Some countries have faced challenges implementing contact tracing, and no impact evaluations using empirical data have assessed its impact on COVID-19 mortality. This study assesses the impact of contact tracing in a middle-income country, providing data to support the expansion and optimization of contact tracing strategies to improve infection control.We obtained publicly available data on all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Colombia between March 2 and June 16, 2020. (N = 54,931 cases over 135 days of observation). As suggested by WHO guidelines, we proxied contact tracing performance as the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing out of all cases identified. We calculated the daily proportion of cases identified through contact tracing across 37 geographical units (32 departments and five districts). Further, we used a sequential log-log fixed-effects model to estimate the 21-days, 28-days, 42-days, and 56-days lagged impact of the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing on daily COVID-19 mortality. Both the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing and the daily number of COVID-19 deaths are smoothed using 7-day moving averages. Models control for the prevalence of active cases, second-degree polynomials, and mobility indices. Robustness checks to include supply-side variables were performed.We found that a 10 percent increase in the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing is related to COVID-19 mortality reductions between 0.8% and 3.4%. Our models explain between 47%-70% of the variance in mortality. Results are robust to changes of specification and inclusion of supply-side variables.Contact tracing is instrumental in containing infectious diseases. Its prioritization as a surveillance strategy will substantially impact reducing deaths while minimizing the impact on the fragile economic systems of lower and middle-income countries. This study provides lessons for other LMIC."
https://openalex.org/W3133603689,"Medicinal uses and applications of metals and their complexes are of increasing clinical and commercial importance. The ligation behavior of quercetin (Q), which is a flavonoid, and its Zn (II) (Q/Zn) complex were studied and characterized based on elemental analysis, molar conductance, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, electronic spectra, proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H-NMR), thermogravimetric analysis, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). FTIR spectral data revealed that Q acts as a bidentate ligand (chelating ligand) through carbonyl C(4) = O oxygen and phenolic C(3)–OH oxygen in conjugation with Zn. Electronic, FTIR, and 1 H-NMR spectral data revealed that the Q/Zn complex has a distorted octahedral geometry, with the following chemical formula: [Zn(Q)(NO 3 )(H 2 O) 2 ].5H 2 O. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (STZ) injection. A total of 70 male albino rats were divided into seven groups: control, diabetic untreated group and diabetic groups treated with either MSCs and/or Q and/or Q/Zn or their combination. Serum insulin, glucose, C-peptide, glycosylated hemoglobin, lipid profile, and enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant levels were determined. Pancreatic and lung histology and TEM for pancreatic tissues in addition to gene expression of both SOD and CAT in pulmonary tissues were evaluated. MSCs in combination with Q/Zn therapy exhibited potent protective effects against STZ induced hyperglycemia and suppressed oxidative stress, genotoxicity, glycometabolic disturbances, and structural alterations. Engrafted MSCs were found inside pancreatic tissue at the end of the experiment. In conclusion, Q/Zn with MSC therapy produced a synergistic effect against oxidative stress and genotoxicity and can be considered potential ameliorative therapy against diabetes with pulmonary dysfunction, which may benefit against COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3135696232,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been followed intensely by the global news media, with deaths and bereavement a major focus. The media reflect and reinforce cultural conventions and sense-making, offering a lens which shapes personal experiences and attitudes. How COVID-19 bereavement is reported therefore has important societal implications. We aimed to explore the reportage and portrayal of COVID-19 related bereavement in the top seven most-read British online newspapers during two week-long periods in March and April 2020. We conducted a qualitative document analysis of all articles that described grief or bereavement after a death from COVID-19. Analysis of 55 articles was informed by critical discourse analysis and Terror Management Theory, which describes a psychological conflict arising between the realisation that death is inevitable and largely unpredictable and the human need for self-preservation. We identified three main narratives: (1) fear of an uncontrollable, unknown new virus and its uncertain consequences—associated with sensationalist language and a sense of helplessness and confusion; (2) managing uncertainty and fear via prediction of the future and calls for behaviour change, associated with use of war metaphors; and (3) mourning and loss narratives that paid respect to the deceased and gave voice to grief, associated with euphemistic or glorifying language (‘passed away’, ‘heroes’). Accounts of death and grief were largely homogenous, with bereavement due to COVID-19 presented as a series of tragedies, and there was limited practical advice about what to do if a loved one became seriously ill or died. Reporting reflected the tension between focusing on existential threat and the need to retreat from or attempt to control that threat. While the impact of this reporting on the public is unknown, a more nuanced approach is recommended to better support those bereaved by COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3135646559,"Background Cancer survivors have a higher risk of developing and dying from cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to the general population. We sought to determine whether 10-year risk of atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) is elevated among those with vs. without a cancer history in a nationally representative U.S. sample. Methods Participants aged 40–79 years with no CVD history were included from the 2007–2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Cancer history was self-reported and 10-year risk of ASCVD was estimated using Pooled Cohort Equations. We used logistic regression to estimate associations between cancer history and odds of elevated (≥7.5%) vs. low (&lt;7.5%) 10-year ASCVD risk. An interaction between age and cancer history was examined. Results A total of 15,095 participants were included (mean age = 55.2 years) with 12.3% (n = 1,604) reporting a cancer history. Individuals with vs. without a cancer history had increased odds of elevated 10-year ASCVD risk (OR = 3.42, 95% CI: 2.51–4.66). Specifically, those with bladder/kidney, prostate, colorectal, lung, melanoma, or testicular cancer had a 2.72–10.47 higher odds of elevated 10-year ASCVD risk. Additionally, age was an effect modifier: a cancer history was associated with 1.24 (95% CI: 1.19–4.21) times higher odds of elevated 10-year ASCVD risk among those aged 60–69, but not with other age groups. Conclusions Adults with a history of self-reported cancer had higher 10-year ASCVD risk. ASCVD risk assessment and clinical surveillance of cardiovascular health following a cancer diagnosis could potentially reduce disease burden and prolong survival, especially for patients with specific cancers and high ASCVD risk."
https://openalex.org/W3134272626,"Since the initial identification of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in December of 2019, researchers have raced to understand its pathogenesis and begun devising vaccine and treatment strategies. An accurate understanding of the body's temporal immune response against SARS-CoV-2 is paramount to successful vaccine development and disease progression monitoring. To provide insight into the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2, plasma samples from 181 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients collected at various timepoints post-symptom onset (PSO) were tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies via lateral flow. Additionally, 21 donors were tracked over time to elucidate patient-specific immune responses. We found sustained levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies past 130 days PSO, with 99% positivity observed at 31-60 days PSO. By 61-90 days PSO, the percentage of IgM-/IgG+ results were nearly equal to that of IgM+/IgG+ results, demonstrating a shift in the immune response with a decrease in IgM antibody levels. Results from this study not only provide evidence that the antibody response to COVID-19 can persist for over 4 months, but also demonstrates the ability of Easy Check™ to monitor seroconversion and antibody response of patients. Easy Check was sufficiently sensitive to detect antibodies in patient samples as early as 1-4 days PSO with 86% positivity observed at 5-7 days PSO. Further studies are required to determine the longevity and efficacy of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and whether they are protective against re-infection."
https://openalex.org/W3134657379,"Climate change, population growth, the development of industrialization and urbanization are increasing the demand for water resources, but the water pollution is reducing the limited water supply. In recent years, the gap between water supply and demand which shows water scarcity situation is becoming more serious. Clear knowing this gap and its main driving factors could help us to put forward water protection measures correctly. We take the data of Huaihe River Basin from 2001 to 2016 as an example and use ecological water footprint to describe the demand, with the water carrying capacity representing the supply. We analyze the water supply-demand situation of Huaihe River Basin and its five provinces from footprint view in time and space. Then we apply the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index model to analyze the driving factors of the ecological water footprint. The results show that: (1) the supply and demand balance of Huaihe River Basin was only achieved in year 2003 and 2005. There is also a large difference between Jiangsu province and other provinces in Huaihe River basin, most years in Jiangsu province per capital ecological footprint of water is more than 1 hm 2 /person except the years of 2003, 2015, and 2016. But other provinces are all less than 1 hm 2 /person. (2) Through the decomposition of water demand drivers, we concluded that economic development is the most important factor, with an annual contribution of more than 60%. Our study provides countermeasures and suggestions for the management and optimal allocation of water resources in Huaihe River Basin, and also provides reference for the formulation of water-saving policies in the world."
https://openalex.org/W3135823436,"Expanding access to contraception and ensuring that need for family planning is satisfied are essential for achieving universal access to reproductive healthcare services, as called for in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. To quantify the gaps that remain in meeting needs among adolescents, this study provides a harmonised data set and global estimates and projections of family planning indicators for adolescents aged 15–19 years. We compiled a comprehensive dataset of family-planning indicators among women aged 15–19 from 754 nationally representative surveys. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model with country-specific annual trends to estimate contraceptive prevalence and unmet need for family planning, with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs), for 185 countries, taking into account changes in proportions married or in a union and differences in sexual activity among unmarried women across countries. Among 300 million women aged 15–19 years in 2019, 29.8 million (95% UI 24.6–41.7) use any contraception, and 15.0 million (95% UI 12.1–29.2) have unmet need for family planning. Population growth and the postponement of marriage influence trends in the absolute number of adolescents using contraception or experiencing unmet need. Large gaps remain in meeting family-planning needs among adolescents. The proportion of the need satisfied by modern methods, Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) indicator 3.7.1, was 59.2% (95% UI 44.8–67.2) globally among adolescents, lower compared to 75.7% (95% UI 73.2%–78.0%) among all women age 15–49 years. It was less than one half of adolescents in need in Western Asia and Northern Africa (38.7%, 95%UI = 20.9–56.5), Central and Southern Asia (43.5%, 95%UI = 36.6–52.3), and sub-Saharan Africa (45.6%, 95%UI = 42.2–49.0). The main limitations of the study are: (i) the uncertainty surrounding estimates for countries with limited or biased data is large; and (ii) underreporting of contraceptive use and needs is likely, especially among unmarried adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W3134704014,"The main objectives of this study were to evaluate the prediction performance of genomic and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) data and whether the integration of genomic and NIR predictor variables can increase the prediction accuracy of two feedstock quality traits (fiber and sucrose content) in a sugarcane population (Saccharum spp.). The following three modeling strategies were compared: M1 (genome-based prediction), M2 (NIR-based prediction), and M3 (integration of genomics and NIR wavenumbers). Data were collected from a commercial population comprised of three hundred and eighty-five individuals, genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphisms and screened using NIR spectroscopy. We compared partial least squares (PLS) and BayesB regression methods to estimate marker and wavenumber effects. In order to assess model performance, we employed random sub-sampling cross-validation to calculate the mean Pearson correlation coefficient between observed and predicted values. Our results showed that models fitted using BayesB were more predictive than PLS models. We found that NIR (M2) provided the highest prediction accuracy, whereas genomics (M1) presented the lowest predictive ability, regardless of the measured traits and regression methods used. The integration of predictors derived from NIR spectroscopy and genomics into a single model (M3) did not significantly improve the prediction accuracy for the two traits evaluated. These findings suggest that NIR-based prediction can be an effective strategy for predicting the genetic merit of sugarcane clones."
https://openalex.org/W3134718638,"Multiple-trait model tends to be the best alternative for the analysis of repeated measures, since they consider the genetic and residual correlations between measures and improve the selective accuracy. Thus, the objective of this study was to propose a multiple-trait Bayesian model for repeated measures analysis in Jatropha curcas breeding for bioenergy. To this end, the grain yield trait of 730 individuals of 73 half-sib families was evaluated over six harvests. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm was used to estimate genetic parameters and genetic values. Genetic correlation between pairs of measures were estimated and four selective intensities (27.4%, 20.5%, 13.7%, and 6.9%) were used to compute the selection gains. The full model was selected based on deviance information criterion. Genetic correlations of low (ρg ≤ 0.33), moderate (0.34 ≤ ρg ≤ 0.66), and high magnitude (ρg ≥ 0.67) were observed between pairs of harvests. Bayesian analyses provide robust inference of genetic parameters and genetic values, with high selective accuracies. In summary, the multiple-trait Bayesian model allowed the reliable selection of superior Jatropha curcas progenies. Therefore, we recommend this model to genetic evaluation of Jatropha curcas genotypes, and its generalization, in other perennials."
https://openalex.org/W3135577654,"In this paper, we take the elliptical pore structure which is similar to the microstructure of cancellous bone as the research object, four groups of bone scaffolds were designed from the perspective of pore size, porosity and pore distribution. The size of the all scaffolds were uniformly designed as 10 × 10 × 12 mm. Four groups of model samples were prepared by selective laser melting (SLM) and Ti6Al4V materials. The statics performance of the scaffolds was comprehensively evaluated by mechanical compression simulation and mechanical compression test, the manufacturing error of the scaffold samples were evaluated by scanning electron microscope (SEM), and the permeability of the scaffolds were predicted and evaluated by simulation analysis of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The results show that the different distribution of porosity, pore size and pores of the elliptical scaffold have a certain influence on the mechanical properties and permeability of the scaffold, and the reasonable size and angle distribution of the elliptical pore can match the mechanical properties and permeability of the elliptical pore scaffold with human cancellous bone, which has great potential for research and application in the field of artificial bone scaffold."
https://openalex.org/W3133810005,"Identification of success factors in wrestling as well as establishing their hierarchy are crucial from a cognitive and practical standpoint. It may provide a lot of practical recommendations related to wrestling-specific training. The aim of this study was to identify and establish the hierarchy of success factors in wrestling regardless of a fighting style and weight class. This study included 168 elite male freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestlers. They were divided into two groups: athletes who won medals (successful wrestlers) in high-rank competitions (Polish Championships or higher) and those who did not win any medals (less successful wrestlers) in those competitions. The following elements were assessed: anthropological measurements, body composition, dynamic strength, strength endurance, agility, special endurance, wrestling-specific fitness, response time, technical wrestling skills and anaerobic capacity. For initial data analysis, one-way ANOVA (α = 0.005) was used. Random Forests classifier was employed to identify success factors and to determine the importance of each of these factors in terms of sports performance. Seven key success factors were identified: anaerobic power, strength endurance, response time, special endurance, wrestling-specific fitness and technical wrestling skills performed in a horizontal position. Random Forests turned out to be an effective method of modelling success in wrestling (compared to SVM and KNN, which were also used in the study). These findings suggest that wrestling-specific training can be effectively monitored by controlling several vital indicators of athletes’ preparedness: anaerobic power, strength endurance, response time, special endurance, wrestling-specific fitness and technical wrestling skills (the performance of reverse waistlock from a standing position and trunk grip gut wrench assessed by experts)."

How to analyse more complex regulation mechanisms of multiple independent variables to multiple dependent variables? Similarly, according to multiple-to-multiple linear regression analysis, multiple-to-multiple path analysis model was proposed in this paper and it demonstrated more complex regulation mechanisms among multiple independent variables and multiple dependent variables by dividing the generalized determination coefficient. Differently, three other types of paths were generated in multiple-to-multiple path analysis model in that the correlation among multiple dependent variables was considered. Then, the decision coefficient of each independent variable was constructed for dependent variables system, and its hypothesis testing statistics were given. Finally, the research example of the wheat breeding rules in arid area demonstrated that the multiple-to-multiple path analysis considering more correlation information can get better results."
https://openalex.org/W3134711418,"The phosphodiesterase inhibitor sildenafil is a promising treatment for neurodegenerative disease, but it can cause oxidative stress in photoreceptors ex vivo and degrade visual performance in humans. Here, we test the hypotheses that in wildtype mice sildenafil causes i) wide-spread photoreceptor oxidative stress in vivo that is linked with ii) impaired vision.In dark or light-adapted C57BL/6 mice ± sildenafil treatment, the presence of oxidative stress was evaluated in retina laminae in vivo by QUEnch-assiSTed (QUEST) magnetic resonance imaging, in the subretinal space in vivo by QUEST optical coherence tomography, and in freshly excised retina by a dichlorofluorescein assay. Visual performance indices were also evaluated by QUEST optokinetic tracking.In light-adapted mice, 1 hr post-sildenafil administration, oxidative stress was most evident in the superior peripheral outer retina on both in vivo and ex vivo examinations; little evidence was noted for central retina oxidative stress in vivo and ex vivo. In dark-adapted mice 1 hr after sildenafil, no evidence for outer retina oxidative stress was found in vivo. Evidence for sildenafil-induced central retina rod cGMP accumulation was suggested as a panretinally thinner, dark-like subretinal space thickness in light-adapted mice at 1 hr but not 5 hr post-sildenafil. Cone-based visual performance was impaired by 5 hr post-sildenafil and not corrected with anti-oxidants; vision was normal at 1 hr and 24 hr post-sildenafil.The sildenafil-induced spatiotemporal pattern of oxidative stress in photoreceptors dominated by rods was unrelated to impairment of cone-based visual performance in wildtype mice."

Association of previously published risk factors (age, gender, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking habit, obesity, renal failure, cardiovascular/ pulmonary diseases, serum ferritin, lymphocyte count, APTT, PT, fibrinogen, D-dimer, and platelet count) with death was tested by a multivariate logistic regression, and a predictive model was created, with further validation in an independent sample. A total of 2070 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were finally included in the multivariable analysis. Age 61–70 years ( p &lt;0.001; OR: 7.69; 95%CI: 2.93 to 20.14), age 71–80 years ( p &lt;0.001; OR: 14.99; 95%CI: 5.88 to 38.22), age &gt;80 years ( p &lt;0.001; OR: 36.78; 95%CI: 14.42 to 93.85), male gender ( p &lt;0.001; OR: 1.84; 95%CI: 1.31 to 2.58), D-dimer levels &gt;2 ULN ( p = 0.003; OR: 1.79; 95%CI: 1.22 to 2.62), and prolonged PT ( p &lt;0.001; OR: 2.18; 95%CI: 1.49 to 3.18) were independently associated with increased in-hospital mortality.

https://openalex.org/W3134613220,"Background/aims Isoalantolactone (IATL) is one of multiple isomeric sesquiterpene lactones and is isolated from inula helenium. IATL has multiple functions such as antibacterial, antihelminthic and antiproliferative activities. IATL also inhibits pancreatic cancer proliferation and induces apoptosis by increasing ROS production. However, the detailed mechanism of IATL-mediated pancreatic cancer apoptosis remains largely unknown. Methods In current study, pancreatic carcinoma cell lines (PANC-1, AsPC-1, BxPC-3) and a mouse xenograft model were used to determine the mechanism of IATL-mediated toxic effects. Results IATL (20μM) inhibited pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines proliferation in a time-dependent way; while scratch assay showed that IATL significantly inhibited PANC-1 scratch closure (P&lt;0.05); Invasion assays indicated that IATL significantly attenuated pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines invasion on matrigel. Signal analysis showed that IATL inhibited pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell proliferation by blocking EGF-PI3K-Skp2-Akt signal axis. Moreover, IATL induced pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell apoptosis by increasing cytosolic Caspase3 and Box expression. This apoptosis was mediated by inhibition of canonical wnt signal pathway. Finally, xenograft studies showed that IATL also significantly inhibited pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell proliferation and induced pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell apoptosis in vivo . Conclusions IATL inhibits pancreatic cancer proliferation and induces apoptosis on cellular and in vivo models. Signal pathway studies reveal that EGF-PI3K-Skp2-Akt signal axis and canonical wnt pathway are involved in IATL-mediated cellular proliferation inhibition and apoptosis. These studies indicate that IATL may provide a future potential therapy for pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3133901989,"Despite the increasing demand of cellular therapies for dogs, little is known on the differences between adult and fetal adnexa canine mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and data on their metabolic features are lacking. The present study aimed at comparing the characteristics of canine adipose tissue (AT) and umbilical cord matrix (UC) MSCs. Moreover, for the first time in the dog, the cellular bioenergetics were investigated by evaluating the two main metabolic pathways (oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis) of ATP production. Frozen-thawed samples were used for this study. No differences in mean cell proliferation were found (P&gt;0.05). However, while AT-MSCs showed a progressive increase in doubling time over passages, UC-MSCs showed an initial post freezing-thawing latency. No differences in migration, spheroid formation ability, and differentiation potential were found (P&gt;0.05). RT-PCR analysis confirmed the expression of CD90 and CD44, the lack of CD14 and weak expression of CD34, mostly by AT-MSCs. DLA-DRA1 and DLA-DQA1 were weakly expressed only at passage 0 by UC-MSCs, while they were expressed at different passages for AT-MSCs. There was no difference (P&gt;0.05) in total ATP production between cell cultures, but the ratio between the “mitochondrial ATP Production Rate” and the “glycolytic ATP Production Rate” was higher (P&lt;0.05) in AT- than in UC-MSCs. However, in both MSCs types the mitochondrial respiration was the main pathway of ATP production. Mitochondrial respiration and ATP turnover in UC-MSCs were higher (P&lt;0.05) than in AT-MSCs, but both had a 100% coupling efficiency. These features and the possibility of increasing the oxygen consumption by a spare respiratory capacity of four (AT-MSCSs) and two (UC-MSCs) order of magnitude greater than basal respiration, can be taken as indicative of the cell propensity to differentiate. The findings may efficiently contribute to select the most appropriate MSCs, culture and experimental conditions for transplantation experiments in mesenchymal stem cell therapy for companion animals."
https://openalex.org/W3133738172,"Background Patients with Crohn’s disease suffer from a higher rate of anastomotic leakages after ileocecal resection than patients without Crohn’s disease. Our hypothesis was that microscopic inflammation at the resection margins of ileocecal resections in Crohn’s disease increases the rate of anastomotic leakages. Patients and methods In a retrospective cohort study, 130 patients with Crohn’s disease that underwent ileocecal resection between 2015 and 2019, were analyzed. Anastomotic leakage was the primary outcome parameter. Inflammation at the resection margin was characterized as “inflammation at proximal resection margin”, “inflammation at distal resection margin” or “inflammation at both ends”. Results 46 patients (35.4%) showed microscopic inflammation at the resection margins. 17 patients (13.1%) developed anastomotic leakage. No difference in the rate of anastomotic leakages was found for proximally affected resection margins (no anastomotic leakage vs. anastomotic leakage: 20.3 vs. 35.3%, p = 0.17), distally affected resection margins (2.7 vs. 5.9%, p = 0.47) or inflammation at both ends (9.7 vs. 11.8%, p = 0.80). No effect on the anastomotic leakage rate was found for preoperative hemoglobin concentration (no anastomotic leakage vs. anastomotic leakage: 12.3 vs. 13.5 g/dl, p = 0.26), perioperative immunosuppressive medication (62.8 vs. 52.9%, p = 0.30), BMI (21.8 vs. 22.4 m 2 /kg, p = 0.82), emergency operation (21.2 vs. 11.8%, p = 0.29), laparoscopic vs. open procedure (p = 0.58), diverting ileostomy (31.9 vs. 57.1%, p = 0.35) or the level of surgical training (staff surgeon: 80.5 vs. 76.5%, p = 0.45). Conclusion Microscopic inflammation at the resection margins after ileocecal resection in Crohn’s disease is common. Histologically inflamed resection margins do not appear to affect the rate of anastomotic leakages. Our data suggest that there is no need for extensive resections or frozen section to achieve microscopically inflammation-free resection margins."
https://openalex.org/W3134306856,"Introduction The global prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) has increased alarmingly over the last two decades. On top of this, the issues of non-adherence to the prescribed medicines further fuel the DM- related complications to become one of the top causes of mortality and morbidity. Despite the considerable efforts in addressing the poor adherence issues, there are still plenty of problems ahead of us yet to be addressed. The objective of this study was to determine the extent of non-adherence and its contributing factors among diabetic patients attending the medical Referral clinic of Dilla University Referral Hospital. Methods The institutional-based descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out among patients with diabetes mellitus attending the medical referral clinic of Dilla University Referral Hospital. A systematic random sampling method was used to recruit study participants, and tool was adopted to assess for adherence. A pretested semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect information on factors influencing non-adherence to the diabetic medications, and in-depth interview questionnaire was used for key informant interviews for the qualitative part. Data analysis was carried out using SPSS-20. Results The overall prevalence of non-adherence to diabetic treatment regimen among the study participants was 34.0%. The study revealed that cost of transport to the hospital and taking alcohol were significantly associated with non-adherence to the diabetic treatment regimen with the (AOR = 6.252(13.56, 28.822); p &lt; 0.000) and (AOR = 13.12(8.06, 44.73); p &lt;0.002) respectively. Conclusions The study revealed that significant numbers of participants were non-adherent to the Diabetes Mellitus treatment regimens. Intensive counseling, and health education on the importance of good adherence and negative consequences of poor adherence need to be discussed with the patients before starting the medications, and amidst follow up."
https://openalex.org/W3134757439,"Reasoning about graphs evolving over time is a challenging concept in many domains, such as bioinformatics, physics, and social networks. We consider a common case in which edges can be short term interactions (e.g., messaging) or long term structural connections (e.g., friendship). In practice, long term edges are often specified by humans. Human-specified edges can be both expensive to produce and suboptimal for the downstream task. To alleviate these issues, we propose a model based on temporal point processes and variational autoencoders that learns to infer temporal attention between nodes by observing node communication. As temporal attention drives between-node feature propagation, using the dynamics of node interactions to learn this key component provides more flexibility while simultaneously avoiding issues associated with human-specified edges. We also propose a bilinear transformation layer for pairs of node features instead of concatenation, typically used in prior work, and demonstrate its superior performance in all cases. In experiments on two datasets in the dynamic link prediction task, our model often outperforms the baseline model that requires a human-specified graph. Moreover, our learned attention is semantically interpretable and infers connections similar to actual graphs."
https://openalex.org/W3134825026,"Central nervous system and visual dysfunction is an unfortunate consequence of systemic hypoxia in the setting of cardiopulmonary disease, including infection with SARS-CoV-2, high-altitude cerebral edema and retinopathy and other conditions. Hypoxia-induced inflammatory signaling may lead to retinal inflammation, gliosis and visual disturbances. We investigated the consequences of systemic hypoxia using serial retinal optical coherence tomography and by assessing the earliest changes within 24h after hypoxia by measuring a proteomics panel of 39 cytokines, chemokines and growth factors in the plasma and retina, as well as using retinal histology. We induced severe systemic hypoxia in adult C57BL/6 mice using a hypoxia chamber (10% O 2 ) for 1 week and rapidly assessed measurements within 1h compared with 18h after hypoxia. Optical coherence tomography revealed retinal tissue edema at 18h after hypoxia. Hierarchical clustering of plasma and retinal immune molecules revealed obvious segregation of the 1h posthypoxia group away from that of controls. One hour after hypoxia, there were 10 significantly increased molecules in plasma and 4 in retina. Interleukin-1β and vascular endothelial growth factor were increased in both tissues. Concomitantly, there was significantly increased aquaporin-4, decreased Kir4.1, and increased gliosis in retinal histology. In summary, the immediate posthypoxic period is characterized by molecular changes consistent with systemic and retinal inflammation and retinal glial changes important in water transport, leading to tissue edema. This posthypoxic inflammation rapidly improves within 24h, consistent with the typically mild and transient visual disturbance in hypoxia, such as in high-altitude retinopathy. Given hypoxia increases risk of vision loss, more studies in at-risk patients, such as plasma immune profiling and in vivo retinal imaging, are needed in order to identify novel diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers of visual impairment in systemic hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W3135306066,"Blood pressure regulation following spinal cord injury (SCI) is often compromised due to impaired vascular sympathetic control, leading to increased reliance on cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity to maintain pressure. Whole-body exercise improves cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity in uninjured individuals, though has not been explored in those with SCI. Our objective was to determine changes in cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity following 6 months of high-intensity, whole-body exercise in individuals with SCI compared to lower-intensity, arms only exercise, or waitlist. This randomized controlled trial recruited individuals with SCI aged 18–40 years old. Sixty-one individuals were randomized, with 38 completing at least one cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity assessment. Whole-body exercise was performed with hybrid functional electrical stimulation rowing prescribed as two to three times per week, for 30–60 minutes with a target heart rate of &gt;75% of maximum. The arms only exercise group performed upper body rowing exercise with the same prescription as whole-body exercise. Waitlist controls were not enrolled in any explicit training regimen. After 6 months, those in arms only exercise or waitlist crossed over to whole-body exercise. Cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity was assessed via the neck suction technique at baseline and at three-month intervals thereafter. Intention to treat analysis with a structured equation model demonstrated no significant effect of waitlist control or arms only exercise on cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity. Whole-body exercise significantly improved cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity at 6 months for those initially randomized (p = 0.03), as well as those who crossed over from arms only exercise or waitlist control (p = 0.03 for each). However, amount of exercise performed and aerobic gains (VO 2max ) each poorly correlated with increases in cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity (R 2 &lt;0.15). In post-hoc analyses, individuals with paraplegia made significantly greater gains in baroreflex sensitivity compared to those with tetraplegia (p = 0.02), though gains within this group were again poorly correlated to gains in aerobic capacity.

https://openalex.org/W3133555905,"Three-dimensional spheroid cultures have been shown to better physiologically mimic the cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions that occur in solid tumors more than traditional 2D cell cultures. One challenge in spheroid production is forming and maintaining spheroids of uniform size. Here, we developed uniform, high-throughput, multicellular spheroids that self-assemble using microwell plates. DU145 and PC3 cells were cultured as 2D monolayers and 3D spheroids to compare sensitization of TRAIL-resistance cancer cells to TRAIL mediated apoptosis via chemotherapy based on dimensionality. Monocultured monolayers and spheroids were treated with soluble TRAIL alone (24 hr), DTX or CBZ alone (24 hr), or a combination of taxane and TRAIL (24 + 24 hr) to determine the effectiveness of taxanes as TRAIL sensitizers. Upon treatment with soluble TRAIL or taxanes solely, monolayer cells and spheroids exhibited no significant reduction in cell viability compared to the control, indicating that both cell lines are resistant to TRAIL and taxane alone in 2D and 3D. Pretreatment with CBZ or DTX followed by TRAIL synergistically amplified apoptosis in 2D and 3D DU145 cell cultures. PC3 spheroids were more resistant to the combination therapy, displaying a more additive effect in the DTX + TRAIL group compared to 2D. There was a downregulation of DR4/5 expression in spheroid form compared to monolayers in each cell line. Additionally, normal fibroblasts (NFs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were cocultured with both PCa cell lines as spheroids to determine if CAFs confer additional resistance to chemotherapy. We determined that co-cultured spheroids show similar drug resistance to monocultured spheroids when treated with taxane plus TRAIL treatment. Collectively, these findings suggest how the third dimension and cocultures of different cell types effect the sensitization of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells to TRAIL, suggesting therapeutic targets that could overcome TRAIL-resistance in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)."
https://openalex.org/W3134240024,"This paper presents a method to predict the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 in a population with a known age-structure, and then, to quantify the effects of various containment policies, including those policies that affect each age-group differently. The model itself is a compartmental model in which each compartment is divided into a number of age-groups. The parameters of the model are estimated using an optimisation scheme and some known results from the theory of monotone systems such that the model output agrees with some collected data on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. To highlight the strengths of this framework, a few case studies are presented in which different populations are subjected to different containment strategies. They include cases in which the containment policies switch between scenarios with different levels of severity. Then a case study on herd immunity due to vaccination is presented. And then it is shown how we can use this framework to optimally distribute a limited number of vaccine units in a given population to maximise their impact and reduce the total number of infectious individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3134973036,"The inflammatory hypothesis posits that sustained neuroinflammation is sufficient to induce neurodegeneration and the development of Alzheimer’s disease ( AD ) and Alzheimer’s dementia. One potential source of inflammation is the intestine which harbors pro-inflammatory microorganisms capable of promoting neuroinflammation. Systemic inflammation is robustly associated with neuroinflammation as well as low levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) in the systemic circulation and brain. Thus, in this pilot study, we tested the hypothesis that intestinal barrier dysfunction precedes risk of death, incident AD dementia and MCI, cognitive impairment and neuropathology. Serum BDNF was associated with changes in global cognition, working memory, and perceptual speed but not risk of death, incident AD dementia, incident MCI, or neuropathology. Neither of the markers of intestinal barrier integrity examined, including lipopolysaccharide binding protein ( LBP ) nor intestinal fatty acid binding protein ( IFABP ), were associated with risk of death, incident AD dementia, incident mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ), change in cognition (global or domains), or neuropathology. Taken together, the data in this pilot study suggest that intestinal barrier dysfunction does not precede diagnosis of AD or MCI, changes in cognition, or brain pathology. However, since MCI and AD are related to global cognition, the findings with BDNF and the contiguous cognitive measures suggest low power with the trichotomous cognitive status measures. Future studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to further investigate the results from this pilot study."
https://openalex.org/W3135428106,"With the increasing demand for energy, fracturing technology is widely used in oilfield operations over the last decades. Typically, fracturing fluids contain various additives such as cross linkers, thickeners and proppants, and so forth, which makes it possess the properties of considerably complicated components and difficult processing procedure. There are still some difficult points needing to be explored and resolved in the hydroxypropyl guar gum (HPG) removal process, e.g., high viscosity and removal of macromolecular organic compounds. Our works provided a facile and economical HPG removal technology for fracturing fluids by designing a series of processes including gel-breaking, coagulation and precipitation according to the diffusion double layer theory. After this treatment process, the fracturing fluid can meet the requirements of reinjection, and the whole process was environment friendly without secondary pollution characteristics. In this work, the fracturing fluid were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy technologies, etc. Further, the micro-stabilization and destabilization mechanisms of HPG in fracturing fluid were carefully investigated. This study maybe opens up new perspective for HPG removal technologies, exhibiting a low cost and strong applicability in both fundamental research and practical applications."
https://openalex.org/W3135589811,"In language, stored semantic representations of lexical items combine into an infinitude of complex expressions. While the neuroscience of composition has begun to mature, we do not yet understand how the stored representations evolve and morph during composition. New decoding techniques allow us to crack open this very hard question: we can train a model to recognize a representation in one context or time-point and assess its accuracy in another. We combined the decoding approach with magnetoencephalography recorded during a picture naming task to investigate the temporal evolution of noun and adjective representations during speech planning. We tracked semantic representations as they combined into simple two-word phrases, using single words and two-word lists as non-combinatory controls. We found that nouns were generally more decodable than adjectives, suggesting that noun representations were stronger and/or more consistent across trials than those of adjectives. When training and testing across contexts and times, the representations of isolated nouns were recoverable when those nouns were embedded in phrases, but not so if they were embedded in lists. Adjective representations did not show a similar consistency across isolated and phrasal contexts. Noun representations in phrases also sustained over time in a way that was not observed for any other pairing of word class and context. These findings offer a new window into the temporal evolution and context sensitivity of word representations during composition, revealing a clear asymmetry between adjectives and nouns. The impact of phrasal contexts on the decodability of nouns may be due to the nouns’ status as head of phrase—an intriguing hypothesis for future research."
https://openalex.org/W3135592408,"Background Common variable immunodeficiency disorders (CVID), the most common form of primary antibody deficiency, are rare conditions associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. The clinical benefit of immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IgGRT) is substantial: timely treatment with appropriate doses significantly reduces mortality and the incidence of CVID-complications such as major infections and bronchiectasis. Unfortunately, CVID-patients still face a median diagnostic delay of 4 years. Their disease burden, expressed in annual loss of disability-adjusted life years, is 3-fold higher than in the general population. Hurdles to treatment access and reimbursement by healthcare payers may exist because the value of IgGRT is poorly documented. This paper aims to demonstrate cost-effectiveness and cost-utility (on life expectancy and quality) of IgGRT in CVID. Methods and findings With input from a literature search, we built a health-economic model for cost-effectiveness and cost-utility assessment of IgGRT in CVID. We compared a mean literature-based dose (≥450mg/kg/4wks) to a zero-or-low dose (0 to ≤100 mg/kg/4wks) in a simulated cohort of adult patients from time of diagnosis until death; we also estimated the economic impact of diagnostic delay in this simulated cohort. Compared to no or minimal treatment, IgGRT showed an incremental benefit of 17 life-years (LYs) and 11 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €29,296/LY and €46,717/QALY. These results were robust in a sensitivity analysis. Reducing diagnostic delay by 4 years provided an incremental benefit of six LYs and four QALYs compared to simulated patients with delayed IgGRT initiation, resulting in an ICER of €30,374/LY and €47,495/QALY. Conclusions The health-economic model suggests that early initiation of IgGRT compared to no or delayed IgGRT is highly cost-effective. CVID-patients’ access to IgGRT should be facilitated, not only because of proven clinical efficacy, but also due to the now demonstrated cost-effectiveness."
https://openalex.org/W3133549188,"This study developed a dynamic perceptive compensation system for the rotating snakes illusion (RSI) with eye tracking. Large eye movements, such as saccades and blinks, were detected with an eye tracker, and perceptive compensation was dynamically performed based on the characteristics of RSI perception. The proposed compensation system considered three properties: spatial dependence, temporal dependence, and individual dependence. Several psychophysical experiments were performed to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed system. After the preliminary verification and determination of the temporal-dependent function for RSI perception, the effects of gaze information on RSI control were investigated. Five algorithms were compared using paired comparison. This confirmed that the compensation system that took gaze information into account reduced the RSI effect better than compensation without gaze information at a significance threshold of p &lt; 0.01, calculated with Bonferroni correction. Some algorithms that are dependent on gaze information reduced the RSI effects more stably than still RSI images, whereas spatially and temporally dependent compensation had a lower score than other compensation algorithms based on gaze information. The developed system and algorithm successfully controlled RSI perception in relation to gaze information. This study systematically handled gaze measurement, image manipulation, and compensation of illusory image, and can be utilized as a standard framework for the study of optical illusions in engineering fields."
https://openalex.org/W3133759328,"We examine, for the first time, biogeographic patterns in a series of tropical montane coastal systems in northern South America. We use amphibians and reptiles, which constitute the most critical communities based upon the prevalence of endemic taxa, to assess the region’s biodiversity. The montane coastal system spans an east-west distance of 925 km. It includes peaks ranging from 549 m to 2765 m above sea level and encompasses the montane complexes of northern Venezuela (including Isla de Margarita), an outlier at Santa Marta (Colombia), and ranges on the islands Trinidad and Tobago. The area supports 14 family level amphibian clades and 23 family level reptile clades. Fieldwork, museum specimen surveys, and a literature review suggest that biodiversity decreases at higher elevations. Here we examine the biogeographic patterns in the region to assess the role of the montane systems as possible refugia. We also look at the possible island and sky island effects using data from altitudes &gt;200 m. At lower elevations, we tabulated 294 species, comprising 112 amphibians and 182 reptiles. About 45% of these taxa are endemic or exclusive to different sub-regions. At mid-elevation montane cloud forests, we find a much-reduced biodiversity with a total of 125 species (66 amphibians and 59 reptiles) exclusive or restricted to the region, and few species shared between systems. We find that biogeographical patterns follow a natural topographic disposition above 200 m in elevations. At the lower elevation cut off, there are 118 species (26 amphibians and 92 reptiles) shared among two or more of the studied mountain systems, suggesting a common origin and dispersal events, despite what seem to be topographic barriers. Biogeographical relationships support a topographic disposition of the region with close associations between the islands of Trinidad and Tobago, the Paria Range and the Turimiquire Massif, and close associations between the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and the Sierra de San Luis. Overall, the biogeographic relationships between amphibians and reptiles are similar. Species diversity in the eastern Caribbean region is less rich than in the west. This study includes the first herpetological surveys at the two easternmost mountains (Cerro La Cerbatana and Campeare) belonging to the Paria Range biogeographic unit, and aims to contribute to a better understanding of the rich biodiversity of the region."
https://openalex.org/W3134444158,"Background The force of infection, or the rate at which susceptible individuals become infected, is an important public health measure for assessing the extent of outbreaks and the impact of control programs. Methods and findings We present Bayesian methods for estimating force of infection using serological surveys of infections which produce a lasting immune response, accounting for imperfections of the test, and uncertainty in such imperfections. In this estimation, the sensitivity and specificity can either be fixed, or belief distributions of their values can be elicited to allow for uncertainty. We analyse data from two published serological studies of dengue, one in Colombo, Sri Lanka, with a single survey and one in Medellin, Colombia, with repeated surveys in the same individuals. For the Colombo study, we illustrate how the inferred force of infection increases as the sensitivity decreases, and the reverse for specificity. When 100% sensitivity and specificity are assumed, the results are very similar to those from a standard analysis with binomial regression. For the Medellin study, the elicited distribution for sensitivity had a lower mean and higher variance than the one for specificity. Consequently, taking uncertainty in sensitivity into account resulted in a wide credible interval for the force of infection. Conclusions These methods can make more realistic estimates of force of infection, and help inform the choice of serological tests for future serosurveys."
https://openalex.org/W3134803307,"Recent studies indicate that a preference for people from one’s own race emerges early in development. Arguably, one potential process contributing to such a bias has to do with the increased discriminability of own- vs. other-race faces–a process commonly attributed to perceptual narrowing of unfamiliar groups’ faces, and analogous to the conceptual homogenization of out-groups. The present studies addressed two implications of perceptual narrowing of other-race faces for infants’ social categorization capacity. In Experiment 1, White 11-month-olds’ ( N = 81) looking time at a Black vs. White face was measured under three between-subjects conditions: a baseline “preference” (i.e., without familiarization), after familiarization to Black faces, or after familiarization to White faces. Compared to infants’ a priori looking preferences as revealed in the baseline condition, only when familiarized to Black faces did infants look longer at the ""not-familiarized-category"" face at test. According to the standard categorization paradigm used, such longer looking time at the novel (i.e., ""not-familiarized-category"") exemplar at test, indicated that categorization of the familiarized faces had ensued. This is consistent with the idea that prior to their first birthday, infants already tend to represent own-race faces as individuals and other-race faces as a category. If this is the case, then infants might also be less likely to form subordinate categories within other-race than own-race categories. In Experiment 2, infants ( N = 34) distinguished between an arbitrary (shirt-color) based sub-categories only when shirt-wearers were White, but not when they were Black. These findings confirm that perceptual narrowing of other-race faces blurs distinctions among members of unfamiliar categories. Consequently, infants: a) readily categorize other-race faces as being of the same kind, and b) find it hard to distinguish between their sub-categories."

Unfortunately, the decrease in trypanocidal activity in the blood, high toxicity to mammalian cells and low water solubility of β-Lap limit its systemic administration and, consequently, clinical applications. For this reason, carriers as drug delivery systems can strategically maximize the therapeutic effects of this drug, overcoming the above mentioned restrictions.

https://openalex.org/W3135611294,"Developing and validating methods to determine trends in populations of threatened species is essential for evaluating the effectiveness of conservation interventions. For cryptic species inhabiting remote environments, this can be particularly challenging. Rock wrens, Xenicus gilviventris , are small passerines endemic to the alpine zone of southern New Zealand. They are highly vulnerable to predation by introduced mammalian predators. Establishing a robust, cost-effective monitoring tool to evaluate population trends in rock wrens is a priority for conservation of both the species and, more broadly, as part of a suite of indicators for evaluating effectiveness of management in New Zealand’s alpine ecosystems. We assessed the relative accuracy and precision of three population estimation techniques (mark-resight, distance sampling and simple counts on line transects) for two populations of rock wrens in the Southern Alps over six breeding seasons (2012–2018). The performance of these population estimators was compared to known rock wren population size derived from simultaneous territory mapping. Indices of abundance derived from counts on transects were correlated with territory mapping at both study areas, and performed better than either mark-resight methods or distance sampling. Simple counts on standardised line transects are a highly cost-effective method of monitoring birds because they do not require banding a population. As such, we recommend that line transect counts using the design outlined in this paper be adopted as a standard method for long-term monitoring of rock wren populations. Although species-specific testing is required to validate use of low-cost population indices, our results may have utility for the monitoring of other cryptic passerines in relatively open habitats."

Our aim was to answer the question, is topical diclofenac more effective than placebo for the treatment of Achilles tendinopathy?. Methods 67 participants with persistent midportion or insertional Achilles tendinopathy were randomly assigned to receive a 4 week course of 10% topical diclofenac (n = 32) or placebo (n = 35). The a priori primary outcome measure was change in severity of Achilles tendinopathy (VISA-A score) at 4 and 12 weeks. Secondary outcome measures included numeric pain rating, and patient-reported change in symptoms using a 7 point scale, from substantially worse to substantially better. Pressure pain threshold (N) and transverse tendon stiffness (N/m) were measured over the site of maximum Achilles tendon pathology at baseline and 4 weeks. Results There were no statistically or clinically significant differences between the diclofenac and placebo groups in any of the primary or secondary outcome measures at any timepoint. Average VISA-A score improved in both groups (p&lt;0.0001), but the improvements were marginal: at 4 weeks, the improvements in VISA-A were 9 (SD 11) in the diclofenac group and 8 (SD 12) in the placebo group, and at 12 weeks the improvements were 9 (SD 16) and 11 (SD13) respectively–these average changes are smaller than the minimum clinically important difference of the VISA-A. Conclusion The regular application of topical diclofenac for Achilles tendinopathy over a 4 week period was not associated with superior clinical outcomes to that achieved with placebo."
https://openalex.org/W3133686577,"Understanding how marine taxa will respond to near-future climate changes is one of the main challenges for management of coastal ecosystem services. Ecological studies that investigate relationships between the environment and shell properties of commercially important marine species are commonly restricted to latitudinal gradients or small-scale laboratory experiments. This paper aimed to explore the variations in shell features and growth of the edible bivalve Chamelea gallina from the Holocene sedimentary succession to present-day thanatocoenosis of the Po Plain-Adriatic Sea system (Italy). Comparing the Holocene sub-fossil record to modern thanatocoenoses allowed obtaining an insight of shell variations dynamics on a millennial temporal scale. Five shoreface-related assemblages rich in C . gallina were considered: two from the Middle Holocene, when regional sea surface temperatures were higher than today, representing a possible analogue for the near-future global warming, one from the Late Holocene and two from the present-day. We investigated shell biometry and skeletal properties in relation to the valve length of C . gallina . Juveniles were found to be more porous than adults in all horizons. This suggested that C . gallina promoted an accelerated shell accretion with a higher porosity and lower density at the expense of mechanically fragile shells. A positive correlation between sea surface temperature and both micro-density and bulk density were found, with modern specimens being less dense, likely due to lower aragonite saturation state at lower temperature, which could ultimately increase the energetic costs of shell formation. Since no variation was observed in shell CaCO 3 polymorphism (100% aragonite) or in compositional parameters among the analyzed horizons, the observed dynamics in skeletal parameters are likely not driven by a diagenetic recrystallization of the shell mineral phase. This study contributes to understand the response of C . gallina to climate-driven environmental shifts and offers insights for assessing anthropogenic impacts on this economic relevant species."

https://openalex.org/W3135072763,"Background Elevated plantar pressures represent a significant risk factor for neuropathic diabetic foot (NDF) ulceration. Foot offloading, through custom-made insoles, is essential for prevention and healing of NDF ulcerations. Objective quantitative evaluation to design custom-made insoles is not a standard method. Aims: 1) to develop a novel quantitative-statistical framework (QSF) for the evaluation and design of the insoles’ offloading performance through in-shoe pressure measurement; 2) to compare the pressure-relieving efficiency of traditional shape-based total contact customised insoles (TCCI) with a novel CAD-CAM approach by the QSF. Methods We recruited 30 neuropathic diabetic patients in cross-sectional study design. The risk-regions of interest (R-ROIs) and their areas with in-shoe peak pressure statistically ≥200kPa were identified for each patients’ foot as determined on the average of peak pressure maps ascertained per each stance phase. Repeated measures Friedman test compared R-ROIs’ areas in three different walking condition: flat insole (FI); TCCI and CAD-CAM insoles. Results As compared with FI (20.6±12.9 cm 2 ), both the TCCI (7±8.7 cm 2 ) and the CAD-CAM (5.5±7.3 cm 2 ) approaches provided a reduction of R-ROIs mean areas (p&lt;0.0001). The CAD-CAM approach performed better than the TCCI with a mean pressure reduction of 37.3 kPa (15.6%) vs FI. Conclusions The CAD-CAM strategy achieves better offloading performance than the traditional shape-only based approach. The introduced QSF provides a more rigorous method to the direct 200kPa cut-off approach outlined in the literature. It provides a statistically sound methodology to evaluate the offloading insoles design and subsequent monitoring steps. QSF allows the analysis of the whole foot’s plantar surface, independently from a predetermined anatomical identification/masking. QSF can provide a detailed description about how and where custom-made insole redistributes the underfoot pressure respect to the FI. Thus, its usefulness extends to the design step, helping to guide the modifications necessary to achieve optimal offloading insole performances."
https://openalex.org/W3135142584,"Rationale Immunoglobulin (Ig) G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a novel clinical disease entity characterized by an elevated serum IgG4 concentration and tumefaction or tissue infiltration by IgG4-positive plasma cells. Pathological changes are most frequently seen in the pancreas, lacrimal glands, and salivary glands, but pathological changes in the lung also exist. Linker for activation of T cell ( LAT ) Y136F knock-in mice show Th2-dominant immunoreactions with elevated serum IgG1 levels, corresponding to human IgG4. We have reported that LAT Y136F knock-in mice display several characteristic features of IgG4-RD and concluded that they constitute an appropriate model of human IgG4-RD in salivary glands, pancreas, and kidney lesions. Objectives The aim of this study is to evaluate whether lung lesions in LAT Y136F knock-in mice can be a model of IgG4-related lung disease. Methods Lung tissue samples from LAT Y136F knock-in mice (LAT) and wild-type mice (WT) were immunostained for IgG1 and obtained for pathological evaluation, and cell fractions and cytokine levels in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were analyzed. Results In the LAT group, IgG1-positive inflammatory cells increased starting at 4 weeks of age and peaked at 10 weeks of age. The total cell count and percentage of lymphocytes increased significantly in BALF in the LAT group compared to the WT group. In BALF, Th2-dominant cytokines and transforming growth factor-β were also increased. In the LAT group, marked inflammation around broncho-vascular bundles peaked at 10 weeks of age. After 10 weeks, fibrosis around broncho-vascular bundles and bronchiectasis were observed in LAT Y136F knock-in mice but not WT mice. Conclusions LAT Y136F knock-in mice constitute an appropriate model of lung lesions in IgG4-RD."
https://openalex.org/W3135611038,"The homogeneity of the genetically modified single-cells is a necessity for many applications such as cell line development, gene therapy, and tissue engineering and in particular for regenerative medical applications. The lack of tools to effectively isolate and characterize CRISPR/Cas9 engineered cells is considered as a significant bottleneck in these applications. Especially the incompatibility of protein detection technologies to confirm protein expression changes without a preconditional large-scale clonal expansion creates a gridlock in many applications. To ameliorate the characterization of engineered cells, we propose an improved workflow, including single-cell printing/isolation technology based on fluorescent properties with high yield, a genomic edit screen (Surveyor assay), mRNA RT-PCR assessing altered gene expression, and a versatile protein detection tool called emulsion-coupling to deliver a high-content, unified single-cell workflow. The workflow was exemplified by engineering and functionally validating RANKL knockout immortalized mesenchymal stem cells showing bone formation capacity of these cells. The resulting workflow is economical, without the requirement of large-scale clonal expansions of the cells with overall cloning efficiency above 30% of CRISPR/Cas9 edited cells. Nevertheless, as the single-cell clones are comprehensively characterized at an early, highly parallel phase of the development of cells including DNA, RNA, and protein levels, the workflow delivers a higher number of successfully edited cells for further characterization, lowering the chance of late failures in the development process."
https://openalex.org/W3135743884,"Background Cause-specific mortality data are required to set interventions to reduce neonatal mortality. However, in many developing countries, these data are either lacking or of low quality. We assessed the completeness and accuracy of cause of death (COD) data for neonates in Ghana to assess their usability for monitoring the effectiveness of health system interventions aimed at improving neonatal survival. Methods A lot quality assurance sampling survey was conducted in 20 hospitals in the public sector across four regions of Ghana. Institutional neonatal deaths (IND) occurring from 2014 through 2017 were divided into lots, defined as neonatal deaths occurring in a selected facility in a calendar year. A total of 52 eligible lots were selected: 10 from Ashanti region, and 14 each from Brong Ahafo, Eastern and Volta region. Nine lots were from 2014, 11 from 2015 and 16 each were from 2016 and 2017. The cause of death (COD) of 20 IND per lot were abstracted from admission and discharge (A&amp;D) registers and validated against the COD recorded in death certificates, clinician’s notes or neonatal death audit reports for consistency. With the error threshold set at 5%, ≥ 17 correctly matched diagnoses in a sample of 20 deaths would make the lot accurate for COD diagnosis. Completeness of COD data was measured by calculating the proportion of IND that had death certificates completed. Results Nineteen out of 52 eligible (36.5%) lots had accurate COD diagnoses recorded in their A&amp;D registers. The regional distribution of lots with accurate COD data is as follows: Ashanti (4, 21.2%), Brong Ahafo (7, 36.8%), Eastern (4, 21.1%) and Volta (4, 21.1%). Majority (9, 47.4%) of lots with accurate data were from 2016, followed by 2015 and 2017 with four (21.1%) lots. Two (10.5%) lots had accurate COD data in 2014. Only 22% (239/1040) of sampled IND had completed death certificates. Conclusion Death certificates were not reliably completed for IND in a sample of health facilities in Ghana from 2014 through 2017. The accuracy of cause-specific mortality data recorded in A&amp;D registers was also below the desired target. Thus, recorded IND data in public sector health facilities in Ghana are not valid enough for decision-making or planning. Periodic data quality assessments can determine the magnitude of the data quality concerns and guide site-specific improvements in mortality data management."
https://openalex.org/W3133963482,"Gene editing has become an essential tool for interrogation of gene function in biomedical research and is also a promising approach for gene therapy. Despite recent progresses, the gene-editing procedure is still a tedious process involving manually isolating large number of single cell colonies to screen for desired mutations. For diploid eukaryotic cells, there is the additional challenge to inactivate both alleles for genes-of-interest, i.e., generating double knockouts (DKOs), for the desired phenotypes or therapeutic effects. In this report, we present a novel method based on Fluorescence Assisted Cell Sorting (FACS) to enrich for DKO cells, using a cell surface marker β2-microglobulin (B2M) as a basis for negative selection. This method significantly increased percentage of DKOs in isolated cells after gene editing, and in the meantime, significantly improve the efficiency of workflow by automating colony isolation. It would greatly facilitate future biomedical research including potential gene/cell therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3134102271,"This study aimed to evaluate the association of periodontitis with the organoleptic score (OLS)-defined oral malodor after validating OLS with odoriferous sulfur compounds in mouth air among Korean adults. A total of 330 adults aged 47–86 years were recruited from the Yangpyeong health cohort, South Korea, in 2015. Oral malodor was assessed using a 6-point OLS by a trained dentist and validated with the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (HS) and methyl mercaptan (MM) using a gas chromatographer. Periodontitis was measured by assessing the radiographic alveolar bone loss on digital orthopantomography. Statistical analyses including descriptive statistics, partial correlation, ANOVA, and multivariable logistic regression with putative confounders were applied. OLS was significantly correlated with the concentrations of HS and MM (partial r = 0.401 and 0.392, respectively; both p &lt;0.001) after controlling for confounders. Individuals with periodontitis had 1.8 times the risk of OLS-defined oral malodor in multivariable models (adjusted odds ratio = 1.77 in the model with the number of teeth and 1.82 in the model with denture wearing; p = 0.047 and 0.035, respectively). Periodontitis was associated with OLS-defined oral malodor among Korean adults independent of known confounders. Periodontal conditions should be considered for clinical practice and research of oral malodor."

Here, we report a convenient approach to synthesis 3-m-tolyl-5-arylidene-2,4-thiazolidinediones (TZDs) derivatives 7a-e in two steps with moderate to good yield using morpholine as a catalyst. All the structures were confirmed by their spectral IR, 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR data. The anti-diabatic activity of all synthesized molecules is evaluated by docking with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ). Preliminary flexible docking studies reveals that our compounds 7a , 7d and 7e showed better binding affinity with the protein and could be a potential candidate for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in near future."
https://openalex.org/W3135418901,"Two kinds of common tunnel shapes, i.e. elliptical opening and square opening were selected for biaxial compression tests, and the influences of two kinds of opening shapes on the mechanical properties, failure characteristics and failure modes of sandstone were compared and analyzed. The complex variable theory and mapping functions were used to obtain the analytical stress solution around elliptical and square openings. The results show that the stability of the specimen containing an elliptical opening was better than that of the specimen containing a square opening under the same lateral stress. Compared with the elliptical opening, the local damage was formed earlier in the square opening which might be caused by a higher stress concentration around the square opening. The stress distributions around openings were influenced by the opening shape and lateral stress coefficient. The top and bottom of square opening were more prone to tensile fracture, and the distribution range of tensile was larger than that of elliptical opening. When the opening failed, the intensity of square opening failure was weaker than that of elliptical opening. On the basis of the average frequency value and the rise angle value, the failure mode of specimen containing elliptical or square opening was distinguished. It was found that the mixed tension and shear failure dominated the failure of specimens with different opening shapes, and the number of shear cracks in the specimen containing a square opening was greater than that in the specimen containing an elliptical opening. The above method of judging failure mode by acoustic emission signals was well verified by the CT images of damaged specimens."
https://openalex.org/W3135428201,"The use of ‘explicitly metacognitive’ learning strategies has been proposed as an explanation for uniquely human capacities for cumulative culture. Such strategies are proposed to rely on explicit, system-2 cognitive processes, to enable advantageous selective copying. To investigate the plausibility of this theory, we investigated participants’ ability to make flexible learning decisions, and their metacognitive monitoring efficiency, under executive function (EF) load. Adult participants completed a simple win-stay lose-shift (WSLS) paradigm task, intended to model a situation where presented information can be used to inform response choice, by copying rewarded responses and avoiding those that are unrewarded. This was completed alongside a concurrent switching task. Participants were split into three conditions: those that needed to use a selective copying, WSLS strategy, those that should always copy observed information, and those that should always do the opposite (Expt 1). Participants also completed a metacognitive monitoring task alongside the concurrent switching task (Expt 2). Conditions demanding selective strategies were more challenging than those requiring the use of one rule consistently. In addition, consistently copying was less challenging than consistently avoiding observed stimuli. Differences between selectively copying and always copying were hypothesised to stem from working memory requirements rather than the concurrent EF load. No impact of EF load was found on participants’ metacognitive monitoring ability. These results suggest that copying decisions are underpinned by the use of executive functions even at a very basic level, and that selective copying strategies are more challenging than a combination of their component parts. We found minimal evidence that selective copying strategies relied on executive functions any more than consistent copying or deviation. However, task experience effects suggested that ceiling effects could have been masking differences between conditions which might be apparent in other contexts, such as when observed information must be retained in memory."
https://openalex.org/W3135735676,"Introduction A simple and rapid diagnosis of Ureaplasma spp. is required for the choice of the appropriate antibiotic. However, an ideal detection method has not been available. This study examines the efficacy of the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay, which provides rapid and sensitive results, to detect Ureaplasma spp. in respiratory tract samples of preterm infants. Methods The study included preterm infants born before 32 weeks of gestation admitted Kagoshima City Hospital from June 2018 to March 2020. Nasopharyngeal swabs and/or tracheal aspirates were obtained in the first seven postnatal days. One hundred sixty-seven nasopharyngeal swabs and 101 tracheal aspirates were analyzed by LAMP, culture, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results All 167 infants had a median (range) gestational age of 28.7 weeks (22.3–30.9) and birthweight 1030g (322–1828). One hundred sixty-seven nasopharyngeal swabs and 101 tracheal aspirates were obtained. In the results of nasopharyngeal swabs, the sensitivity and specificity of LAMP were 73.9% (17/23) and 97.2% (140/144), whereas those of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were 73.9% (17/23) and 95.8% (138/144), compared to culture. In the results of tracheal aspirates, the sensitivity and specificity of LAMP were 89.5% (17/19) and 92.7% (76/82), whereas those of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were 89.5% (17/19) and 93.9% (77/82), compared to culture. Conclusions The LAMP assay showed similar sensitivity and specificity with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in the respiratory tracts of preterm infants including extremely preterm infants during the immediate postnatal period. Therefore, the LAMP is a practical alternative for the early detection so that appropriate antibiotics can be administered for preventing BPD."
https://openalex.org/W3133839997,"SREBP1 and 2, are cholesterol sensors able to modulate cholesterol-related gene expression responses. SREBPs binding sites are characterized by the presence of multiple target sequences as SRE, NFY and SP1, that can be arranged differently in different genes, so that it is not easy to identify the binding site on the basis of direct DNA sequence analysis. This paper presents a complete workflow based on a one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model able to detect putative SREBPs binding sites irrespective of target elements arrangements. The strategy is based on the recognition of SRE linked (less than 250 bp) to NFY sequences according to chromosomal localization derived from TF Immunoprecipitation (TF ChIP) experiments. The CNN is trained with several 100 bp sequences containing both SRE and NF-Y. Once trained, the model is used to predict the presence of SRE-NFY in the first 500 bp of all the known gene promoters. Finally, genes are grouped according to biological process and the processes enriched in genes containing SRE-NFY in their promoters are analyzed in details. This workflow allowed to identify biological processes enriched in SRE containing genes not directly linked to cholesterol metabolism and possible novel DNA patterns able to fill in for missing classical SRE sequences."
