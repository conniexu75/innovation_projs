https://openalex.org/W2016790214,"IT is generally assumed that the b-wave of the human retinal action potential is due to the stimulation of the rods. With an intensity of 2,000 lux, the b-waves fuse at a frequency of about 20 flashes per second. At lower intensities the fusion frequency in our experiments decreased. A linear relation was found between fusion frequency and the logarithm of stimulus intensity. However, the subjective fusion frequency, determined by cone activity, is known to reach values around 50–60 flashes per second. These high values are never obtained with the b-waves of the electroretinogram as index. This is but one of several reasons for assuming the b-waves to express rod activity."

https://openalex.org/W2033829192,"A SURVEY of streptococci has already shown that the lactic group are the most powerful antibiotic producers1. It was of interest to see whether antibiotics are also produced by lactobacilli, especially since Grossowics, Kaplan and Schneerson2 have already reported the existence of such substances. Young Gruyère cheese samples from different areas of France were used as one of the sources of these lactobacilli. 40 antibiotic-producing strains, about 3 per cent of the total number of strains tested, have been isolated in pure culture. These gave zones of inhibition 20–30 mm. in diameter when assayed by the cylinder plate method with Staph. aureus as the test organism."

https://openalex.org/W1992942887,"IT has been shown previously that the rate of formation of deoxyribonucleio acid is depressed by a sublethal dose of X-rays. Both the incorporation of phosphorus-321–5 and that of carbon-14 6,7 was found to be reduced about 50 per cent. The rate of incorporation of carbon-14 into the purines of ribonucleic acid is reduced as well7, though to a smaller extent than its incorporation into the purines of deoxyribonucleic acid. These blocking effects are presumably due to in-activation of enzymes involved in the synthesis of the deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid compounds. One or a few days after irradiation, the incorporation of carbon-14 into purines of deoxyribonucleic acid has nearly returned to the rate for the non-irradiated controls. This suggests that a partial reactivation has occurred. The early metabolic changes produced by irradiation are not confined to interference with nucleic acid synthesis. We find that irradiation interferes with glucose metabolism as well."

https://openalex.org/W2026633054,"THE steady-state turnover-rate of potassium ions in guinea pig cortex slices in vitro was measured by the isotope procedure developed by Krebs, Eggleston and Terner1. There is a rapid initial loss of potassium when kidney slices are placed in physiological saline solutions, but if 0.01 M α-ketoglutarate is present, the slices reabsorb the lost potassium1 and maintain the initial concentration during at least the interval from 25 to 35 min. after the start of the incubation. When this steady state had been reached, potassium-42 chloride was added to the medium and the tissue removed either two or four minutes later. Measurements were then made of the radioactivity and the potassium content of tissue and medium with a liquid counter2 and a flame photometer3. Typical results are shown in the accompanying table."

https://openalex.org/W2014403238,"VIRUS hepatitis of dogs was described by Rubarth1 in 1947 in Sweden, and since then a natural epidemic of the disease has been observed in Britain2. From the organs of two dogs dying during this epidemic, the infective agent has been cultivated by the inoculation into the yolk sac of embryonated hen's eggs for twelve successive passages, after which it was passaged back to dogs with reproduction of the disease."

https://openalex.org/W2085567644,"SOME years ago it was suggested that the first step in melanogenesis, the oxidation of tyrosine to o-dihydroxyphenylalanine, can be represented by the following general reactions: (1) o-dihydroxyphenol → o-quinone → intermediate products → melanin; (2) o-quinone + monohydroxyphenol + H2O = 2 o-dihydroxyphenol; and that of these reactions only the first is really enzymic1."
https://openalex.org/W1977679731,"SINCE roots and tubers contain different substances which are easily assimilable by many micro-organisms, the question arises whether the mechanical protection by the few outer cell layers of the cortex is sufficient to prevent infections from the surrounding soil, or whether the plant produces antibacterial and antifungal substances to increase its resistance against microbial invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2004102030,CHANGES in chemical and physical chemical characteristics of deoxyribosenucleoprotein and deoxyribosenucleic acid in solution following exposure to ionizing radiations have been described by several investigators1–3. Decreased viscosity and chemical decomposition have been reported.

https://openalex.org/W1969255522,"Trichomonas fœtus, a polyflagellated protozoon, is parasitic in the vagina of the cow and causes impaired reproduction. J. Andrews and T. von Brand1 carried out some quantitative studies on glucose consumption by T. fœtus during cultivation, and then also found that a gas, which burned explosively when mixed with air, was produced by the organism when growing in serum broth with 0.1 per cent glucose. This fact suggested that it might be hydrogen."

https://openalex.org/W2086478022,"THE spermatheca is stated to be absent, by Patton and Cragg1, in the Anoplura, Pediculus humanus, and also by Florence2 in Hæmatopinus suis. But Keilin and Nuttall3 indicate the existence of a spermatheca in their figure of the reproductive system of P. humanus. Qadri4 disputes this finding and points out that a spermatheca is also absent in Hæmatopinus tuberculatus."

https://openalex.org/W2047171041,"AT the present time, considerable confusion exists as to what should properly be called the sarcolemma, or true muscle fibre membrane. Long1 denned the sarcolemma as a bipartite structure consisting of an inner layer, the true plasma membrane, and an outer layer composed of reticular fibrils. Meyer and Bernfeld2 concluded that the sarcolemma is a collagenous-type protein. Jones and Barer3 failed to find evidence of a collagenous or fibrillar structure."
https://openalex.org/W2059296254,"TERRAMYCIN HYDROCHLORIDE (Pfizer) was tested in mice inoculated with Vibrio cholera. The animals were inoculated intraperitoneally with a suspension of 1 ml. of an 18-hr, old culture; the suspension contained 50 × 106 organisms per ml. and 5 per cent mucin (Armour)1. These inoculations were fatal in 48 hr. Four strains (Ogawa 41, Inaba 35 and 29, and a Mediterranean Inaba strain) were employed."

https://openalex.org/W2008753437,"CELLS of Bacillus megatherium strain 1.0 can carry on metabolic activity, including multiplication, simultaneously with virus formation, for an infinite time; this balance between the cells and their virus is called lysogenesis. Evidence that lysogenic Bac. megatherium strain 1.0 can return to the normal uninfected state on a glucose nutrient medium was presented by Ehrlich and Watson1. Further study of this phenomenon showed that other sources of carbon, such as fructose, maltose, sucrose, glycerol, pyruvate and succinate in the basal medium all cause recovery from the lysogenic state. In postulating an explanation for this behaviour, it was thought that the virus and the source of carbon might compete for organic phosphate and that the virus was the weaker competitor. The work of Kozloff and Putnam suggested such a hypothesis2. However, initial studies showed that this hypothesis could not explain the effect of glucose on lysogenic Bac. megatherium strain 1.0."

https://openalex.org/W4255953079,"As any reader of Pijper's many works on bacterial flagella will soon discover, his opinions on this subject have changed considerably during the years. In the work from 1947, cited by me, bacterial flagella are described as “lifeless mucous twirls” or “poly-saccharide twirls”."
https://openalex.org/W1992239969,"IN the course of an investigation into the distribution of chloride between blood plasma and skin in the cat, difficulty was encountered in determining the chloride content of the skin. Digestion of the tissue in concentrated nitric acid is impracticable owing to loss of chloride; the tissue proved to be too tough to be ground in trichloracetic acid, which is the standard procedure with other tissues. Freezing before grinding had no helpful effect and cutting the tissue into very small fragments before grinding was, though successful, both laborious and time-consuming; mincing was impracticable owing to the relatively small samples which could be used."
