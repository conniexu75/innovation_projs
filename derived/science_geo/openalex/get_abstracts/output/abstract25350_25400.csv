https://openalex.org/W2031576542,"Highly purified maturation-promoting factor (MPF) from Xenopus eggs contains both cyclin B1 and cyclin B2 as shown by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation using Xenopus anti-B-type cyclin antibodies. Immunoprecipitates with these antibodies display the histone H1 kinase activity characteristic of MPF, for which exogenously added B1 and B2 cyclins are both substrates. Protein kinase activity against cyclin oscillates in maturing oocytes and activated eggs with the same kinetics as p34cdc2 kinase activity. These data indicate that B-type cyclin is the other component of MPF besides p34cdc2."
https://openalex.org/W1598654033,"A 170,000-Da glycoprotein (P170 multidrug transporter) becomes specifically labeled in multidrug-resistant human KB carcinoma cells by the photolabile lipophilic membrane probe 5-[125I]iodonaphthalene-1-azide ([125I]INA) when photoactivation of the probe is triggered by energy transfer from intracellular doxorubicin or rhodamine 123. In contrast, in drug-sensitive cells, drug-induced specific labeling of membrane proteins with [125I]INA was not observed. Instead, multiple membrane proteins became labeled in a nonspecific manner. This phenomenon of drug-induced specific labeling of P170 by [125I]INA is observed only in living cells, but not in purified membrane vesicles or lysed cells. It is generated by doxorubicin and rhodamine 123, drugs that are chromophores and to which the cells exhibit resistance; but it is not observed with other drugs or dyes. Verapamil, a calcium channel blocker which reverses resistance to doxorubicin, also abolishes doxorubicin-induced specific [125I]INA labeling of P170. These results reveal that a specific interaction between P170 and doxorubicin takes place in living cells and demonstrate that P170 is directly involved in the mechanism of drug resistance in vivo. They also provide a possible means to label functional domains in the multidrug transporter. The results demonstrate that photosensitized [125I]INA labeling is a technique which provides sufficient spatial and time resolution to detect specific intracellular interactions between chromophores and proteins in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1606277396,"The 70-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein (PMP70) is one of the major integral membrane proteins of rat liver peroxisomes. cDNA clones for PMP70 were isolated and sequenced. The predicted amino acid sequence (659 amino acid residues) revealed that the carboxyl-terminal region of PMP70 has strong sequence similarities to a group of ATP-binding proteins such as MalK and Mdr. These proteins form a superfamily and are involved in various biological processes including membrane transport. Limited protease treatment of peroxisomes showed that the ATP-binding domain of PMP70 is exposed to the cytosol. The hydropathy profile, in comparison with those of several other members of the ATP-binding protein superfamily, suggests that PMP70 is a transmembrane protein possibly forming a channel. Based on these results, we propose that PMP70 is involved in active transport across the peroxisomal membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2133198589,"The scrapie agent protein (Sp33-37 or PrPSc) is the disease-associated isoform of a normal cellular membrane protein (Cp33-37 or PrPC) of unknown function. We report that normal human lymphocytes and lymphoid cell lines, but not erythrocytes or granulocytes, express PrPC mRNA and protein. PrPC is detectable on the surface of lymphocytes; the surface immunoreactivity is sensitive to phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, indicating glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol membrane anchorage. Lymphocyte PrPC surface abundance is increased by cell activation, and polyclonal antibodies to PrPC suppress mitogen-induced activation. We conclude that PrPC is a lymphocyte surface molecule that may participate in cell activation."

https://openalex.org/W1521304851,"The amyloid forming beta-peptide of Alzheimer's disease is synthesized as part of a larger integral membrane precursor protein (beta APP) of which three alternatively spliced versions of 695, 751, and 770 amino acids have been described. A fourth beta APP form of 563 amino acids does not contain the beta-peptide region. Recent experiments using transient expression in HeLa cells (Weidemann, A., Konig, G., Bunke, D., Fischer, P., Salbaum, J.M., Masters, C.L., and Beyreuther, K. (1989) Cell 57, 115-126) indicate that the beta APP undergoes several posttranslational modifications including the cleavage and secretion of a large portion of its extracellular domain. The nature and fate of the fragment that remains cell-associated following this cleavage has not heretofore been described. The metabolism of this fragment may have particular significance in Alzheimer's disease since it must contain at least part of the beta-peptide. To study the metabolic fate of this fragment, we have established cell lines overexpressing the 695- and 751-amino acid versions of beta APP. Pulse-chase studies show that this system is similar to the HeLa cell system in that both proteins are synthesized first as membrane-bound proteins of approximately 98 and 108 kDa carrying asparagine-linked sugar side chains and are subsequently processed into higher molecular mass forms by the attachment of sulfate, phosphate, and further sugar groups including sialic acid, adding approximately 20 kDa in apparent molecular mass. The mature form of beta APP is cleaved and rapidly secreted, leaving an 11.5-kDa fragment with the transmembrane region and the cytoplasmic domain behind in the cell. This fragment is stable with a half-life of at least 4 h."

https://openalex.org/W1528082070,"To elucidate the molecular basis of human N-acetylation polymorphism, cDNA clones encoding human liver N-acetyltransferases (EC 2.3.1.5) were isolated from lambda gt10 cDNA libraries using the 32P-labeled cDNA of rabbit liver N-acetyltransferase recently cloned in this laboratory. Three types of cDNAs (D-14, O-7, and D-24) were isolated and their nucleotide sequences were determined, from which the amino acid sequences of human N-acetyltransferases were deduced. All the cDNAs coded for 290 amino acids. Between D-14 and O-7 cDNAs, there was only a single-base substitution in the coding region, which replaced glutamic acid in D-14 cDNA for glycine in O-7 cDNA. There were considerable differences between O-7/D-14 and D-24 cDNAs, with 80% homology in amino acid sequences. When the cDNAs were inserted into pEF321 expression vector and introduced into Chinese hamster ovary cells, N-acetyltransferase activity was expressed in three groups of the transfected cells. The activity in cells transfected with D-14 cDNA was only 9-17% of the activity in O-7 cells. Immunoblot analysis of the transfected cells indicated that the difference in the enzyme activity between O-7 and D-14 cells was possibly due to a difference in the amount of enzyme proteins. The substrate specificity of the expressed enzymes indicated that O-7 and D-14 cDNAs code for polymorphic N-acetyltransferase whereas D-24 cDNA codes for monomorphic enzyme. Southern blot analysis indicated that the polymorphic and monomorphic N-acetyltransferases were encoded in separate genes and that there was restriction fragment length polymorphism with KpnI digestion in the polymorphic N-acetyltransferase gene."
https://openalex.org/W1990405032,"T cells that express the T cell receptor Vβ5.2 domain react with the class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule I-E, and Vβ5.2+T cells are deleted in mouse strains that express I-E glycoproteins. By examination of genetically defined recombinant inbred (RI) mouse strains, it was found that the deletion was dependent on the expression of I-E and one of a limited number of non-MHC gene products (cotolerogens). The gene encoding one of these cotolerogens maps to chromosome 12 and is linked to the endogenous provirus Mtv-9. These observations suggest that the I-E-mediated and minor lymphocyte-stimulating antigen (Mls)-mediated deletions of αβ T cells from the repertoire are similar; both require the expression of a class II MHC glycoprotein and a second non-MHC gene product."
https://openalex.org/W2087782093,"The nitrogen regulatory protein NtrC of enteric bacteria activates transcription of the glnA gene by catalyzing isomerization of closed complexes between RNA polymerase and the glnA promoter to open complexes. NtrC binds to sites upstream of glnA that have properties of eukaryotic transcriptional enhancers. NtrC-binding sites were found to facilitate open complex formation when these sites and the glnA promoter were located on different rings of a singly linked catenane, but not when the two rings were decatenated. The results provide evidence that NtrC contacts RNA polymerase-promoter complexes in a process mediated by formation of a DNA loop. NtrC-binding sites serve to tether NtrC near the glnA promoter, thereby increasing the frequency of collisions between NtrC and polymerase-promoter complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1670076014,"Recent studies from this laboratory have demonstrated the presence of thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) in the 5'-flanking region of the rat alpha and TSH beta subunit genes. Using an avidin-biotin complex DNA binding assay, we have shown that these TREs bind the thyroid hormone (T3) receptor present in nuclear extracts of GH3 cells, as well as the in vitro synthesized Hc-erbA beta, which has been identified as a member of the family of T3 receptors. The binding of Hc-erbA beta to the alpha subunit TRE can be enhanced 3-4-fold by including GH3 nuclear extract in the binding assay. Binding to the TRE present in the TSH beta gene or the rat growth hormone gene was similarly enhanced, although to a lesser degree. The enhanced binding activity is trypsin-sensitive and heat labile, and is not reproduced by the addition of histones, bovine serum albumin, or cytosol instead of nuclear extract. Gel exclusion chromatography suggests a molecular size of approximately 65,000 Da. This protein, which is present in several different cell types, is also able to complement binding of the rat erbA alpha-1 and the pituitary-specific erbA beta-2 forms of the receptor. These data suggest that the binding of the T3 receptor to a TRE is augmented by another nuclear protein, which may be involved in the mechanism of action of thyroid hormone."

https://openalex.org/W2137567442,"Cytochalasin D was found to reduce the endocytosis of ricin and the fluid phase markers [14C]sucrose and Lucifer Yellow in Vero cells without reducing the uptake of transferrin. The number of coated pits at the plasma membrane was not affected by the treatment. Cytochalasin D also reduced the endocytosis of ricin in cells where uptake of transferrin from coated pits was blocked by low cytosolic pH. Colchicine had a similar effect as cytochalasin D. Both drugs inhibited the exocytosis of ricin from the cells, and they reduced the rate by which ricin intoxicated the cells. Cytochalasin D had essentially no effect on the ability of the cells to bind transferrin, whereas colchicine reduced the binding to some extent. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) increased the endocytic uptake of ricin in A431 cells both under normal culture conditions and when the coated pit/coated vesicle pathway was blocked by acidification of the cytosol. In contrast, EGF and TPA had no stimulatory effect on the uptake of transferrin at normal cytoplasmic pH, and they did not abolish the ability of low cytoplasmic pH to inhibit endocytic uptake of transferrin. The results indicate that cytochalasin D and colchicine selectively inhibit endocytic uptake from non-clathrin-coated areas of the cell membrane whereas EGF and TPA stimulate it. The data support the view that there are different endocytic mechanisms, and they indicate that at least in some cell types the non-clathrin-coated endocytosis can be modulated."

https://openalex.org/W1999463253,"Biosynthetic studies of the prion protein (PrP) have shown that two forms of different topology can be generated from the same pool of nascent chains in cell-free translation systems supplemented with microsomal membranes. A transmembrane form is the predominant product generated in wheat germ (WG) extracts, whereas a completely translocated (secretory) form is the major product synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (RRL). An unusual topogenic sequence within PrP is now shown to direct this system-dependent difference. The actions of this topogenic sequence were independent of on-going translation and could be conferred to heterologous proteins by the engineering of a discrete set of codons. System-dependent topology conferred by addition of RRL to WG translation products suggests that this sequence interacts with one or more cytosolic factors."

Using biochemical and immunological methods, we identify at least three distinct factors in heart cell conditioned medium: one induces acetylcholine, substance P, somatostatin, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-related peptides while suppressing catecholamine expression, a second factor induces only vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-related peptides, and a third factor induces only somatostatin expression. These observations demonstrate the existence of a group of biochemically and immunologically distinct factors involved in phenotypic specification with unique, but partially overlapping activities. The analogy with the family of differentiation factors in the hematopoietic system is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1539678880,"The uncoating ATPase has been shown to dissociate clathrin from both clathrin-coated vesicles and synthetic clathrin baskets (Rothman, J. E., and Schmid, S. L. (1986) Cell 46, 5-9). In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of action of the uncoating ATPase using intact coated vesicles isolated from bovine brain. We observed an initial burst of uncoating followed by much slower steady-state uncoating. The initial burst of uncoating was essentially stoichiometric with each molecule of uncoating ATPase apparently binding to one leg of the clathrin triskelion. When the enzyme was preincubated with equimolar ADP, Pi, and ATP, rather than just ATP alone, both the initial burst and the slow steady-state uncoating were markedly inhibited, suggesting that the combination of ADP and Pi is a strong competitive inhibitor of ATP binding. However, kinetic studies suggested that ADP and Pi dissociates from the enzyme relatively rapidly unless clathrin is also bound to the enzyme. These results suggest that, after the uncoating ATPase rapidly removes a stoichiometric amount of clathrin while ATP is hydrolyzed at the active site, slow release of ADP and Pi from the resulting enzyme.clathrin.ADP.Pi complex limits the rate at which further uncoating occurs."
https://openalex.org/W1582794275,"We report the isolation and nucleotide sequence of the human farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase cDNA, an enzyme in the cholesterogenic pathway. Partial cDNAs for the human farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase were isolated by screening human hepatoma (HepG2) and placental cDNA libraries with the rat liver cDNA for farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase as a probe. Anchored polymerase chain reaction was used to isolate the 5'-end of the cDNA. The nucleotide sequence of the human farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase cDNA has high identity (86%) to the rat liver cDNA. Treatment of the human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 with phorbol esters led to 2--7-fold increases in mRNA concentrations for the three cholesterogenic enzymes, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, and HMG-CoA synthase within 5 h. Immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled cells demonstrated that there was a corresponding increase in the rate of synthesis of all three proteins. The addition of cycloheximide to cells also led to increases in the mRNA concentrations of the three enzymes. Treatment of cells with phorbol esters and cycloheximide resulted in superinduction of all three mRNAs; HMG-CoA synthase mRNA levels increased 35-fold, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase 17-fold, and HMG-CoA reductase 16-fold 5 h after treatment. The mRNA levels returned to pretreatment levels by 20 h. Cells were also preincubated in the presence of a lipoprotein-deficient fraction of serum plus mevinolin to induce the levels of the three mRNAs. Addition of phorbol esters and cycloheximide to these derepressed cells led to further increases in the mRNA levels for all three enzymes. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that THP-1 cells contain a short-lived negative transcription factor which regulates transcription of the FPP synthetase, HMG-CoA reductase, and HMG-CoA synthase genes. Phorbol esters also regulate these same genes, presumably by modifying a common negative transcription factor and/or by inducing a positive transcription factor(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1607323180,"The mechanism of the activation of plasminogen by single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (single-chain u-PA, scu-PA) was studied using rscu-PA-Glu158, a recombinant plasmin-resistant mutant of human scu-PA obtained by site-specific mutagenesis of Lys158 to Glu, and rPlg-Ala740, a recombinant human plasminogen in which the catalytic site is destroyed by mutagenesis of the active-site Ser740 to Ala. Conversion of 125I-labeled single-chain plasminogen to two-chain plasmin was quantitated on reduced sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis combined with autoradiography and radioisotope counting of gels bands. The efficiencies of both rscu-PA-Glu158 and rscu-PA for the activation of rPlg-Ala740 and of natural plasminogen were comparable and were 250-500-fold lower than that of recombinant two-chain u-PA (rtcu-PA) for rscu-PA-Glu158 and 100-200-fold lower for rscu-PA. Pretreatment of rscu-PA-Glu158 or rscu-PA with excess alpha 2-antiplasmin, which efficiently neutralizes all contaminating rtcu-PA, did not significantly reduce the catalytic efficiency of these single-chain moieties, indicating that they have a low but significant intrinsic plasminogen activating potential. The low intrinsic catalytic efficiency of rscu-PA for the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin may be sufficient to generate trace amounts of plasmin, which may regulate plasminogen activation by converting poorly active rscu-PA to very active rtcu-PA."
https://openalex.org/W1663324286,"In the last few years, it has been demonstrated by this group and others that rat liver peroxisomes participate in cholesterol synthesis. It has been shown that the key regulatory enzyme of isoprenoid biosynthesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, is present in liver cells not only in the endoplasmic reticulum but also within peroxisomes. It has been also demonstrated that rat liver peroxisomes in the presence of cytosolic proteins in vitro are able to convert [14C]mevalonic acid to [14C]cholesterol. In addition, a recent study demonstrated that the largest cellular concentration of sterol carrier protein-2 is inside peroxisomes. It is of interest, therefore, to inquire whether other proteins known to be involved in cholesterol biogenesis are also present in peroxisomes. In this study we investigated the first step in cholesterol synthesis, the condensation of two acetyl-CoA units to acetoacetyl-CoA. It was demonstrated that peroxisomal thiolase, purified by DEAE-phosphocellulose chromatography from gemfibrozil-treated rats, is active not only toward acetoacetyl-CoA and 3-ketoacyl-CoA, consistent with literature reports, but is also capable of converting acetyl-CoA units to acetoacetyl-CoA. This is the first demonstration of condensation activity in rat liver peroxisomes."

https://openalex.org/W2123955594,"Acetyl-CoA carboxylase, purified from rapidly freeze-clamped livers of rats maintained on a normal laboratory diet and given 0-5 units of insulin shortly before death, gives a major protein band (Mr 265,000) on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The carboxylase from untreated rats has relatively low activity (0.8 unit/mg protein when assayed in the absence of citrate) and high phosphate content (8.5 mol of Pi/mol of subunit), while the enzyme from livers of rats that received 5 units of insulin has higher activity (2.0 units/mg protein) and lower phosphate content (7.0 mol of Pi/mol of subunit). Addition of citrate activates both preparations with half-maximal activation (K0.5) at 1.0 and 0.6 mM citrate, respectively. The enzyme from rats that did not receive insulin is mainly in the octameric state (Mr approximately 2 x 10(6)), while that from rats that received insulin is mainly in the polymeric state (Mr approximately 10 x 10(6)). Thus, short-term administration of insulin results in activation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, lowering of its citrate requirement, and dephosphorylation and polymerization of the protein. The insulin-induced changes in the carboxylase are probably due to dephosphorylation of the protein since similar changes are observed when the enzyme from rats that did not receive insulin is dephosphorylated by the Mn2(+)-dependent [acetyl-CoA carboxylase]-phosphatase 2. The effect of glucagon or epinephrine administration on acetyl-CoA carboxylase was also investigated. The carboxylase from fasted/refed rats has a relatively high specific activity (3.4 units/mg protein in the absence of citrate), lower phosphate content (4.9 mol of Pi/mol of subunit), and is present mainly in the polymeric state (Mr approximately 10 x 10(6)). Addition of citrate activates the enzyme with K0.5 = 0.2 mM citrate. Glucagon or epinephrine injection of fasted/refed rats yielded carboxylase with lower specific activity (1.4 or 1.9 units/mg, respectively, in the absence of citrate), higher phosphate content (6.4 or 6.7 mol of Pi/mol of subunit, respectively), and mainly in the octameric state (Mr approximately 2 x 10(6)). Treatment of these preparations with [acetyl-CoA carboxylase]-phosphatase 2 reactivated the enzyme (specific activity approximately 8 units/mg protein in the absence of citrate) and polymerized the protein (Mr approximately 10 x 10(6]. These observations indicate that insulin and glucagon, by altering the phosphorylation state of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase, play antagonistic roles in the acetyl-control of its activity and therefore in the regulation of fatty acid synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1492984283,"The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of angiotensin on the enzyme activities and gene expression of two catecholamine synthesizing enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT), in bovine adrenal medullary (AM) cells. Short term (15 min) incubation of cultured AM cells with 2 nM [Sar1]angiotensin II (s1-AII) did not increase basal secretion of catecholamines; however, longer incubations (3, 24, or 72 h) produced 4-10-fold increases. To determine whether angiotensin affects synthesis of catecholamines, the activities of TH and PNMT were examined. Incubation with s1-AII (15-30 min) decreased the Km of TH for its biopterine cofactor [6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1-biopterin dihydrochloride (BH4] without affecting the Vmax, suggesting activation of TH. After long term incubation (72 h) the Km value was identical to that of control, while increases in the apparent Vmax were observed. PNMT activity was unaffected during a 30-min treatment with s1-AII; however, 2-fold increases occurred after a 48-72-h incubation. s1-AII (24 h) increased the relative abundance of TH and PNMT mRNAs, suggesting that the long term increase in enzyme activities reflected increased expression of TH and PNMT genes. Maximal increases were observed at 2 nM s1-AII and the changes were antagonized by saralasin. Induction of TH mRNA by s1-AII was additive to the effects of veratridine or forskolin indicating that effects of angiotensin were not due to membrane depolarization or increased cyclic AMP levels. Incubation with Ca2+ ionophore A23187 increased TH and PNMT mRNA levels in AM cells raising the possibility that the increase in cellular [Ca2+] could mediate effects of angiotensin. Angiotensin-induced increases in TH and PNMT mRNA were inhibited by nifedipine indicating involvement of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. In addition, the increases in TH, but not PNMT mRNA, were antagonized by dantrolene, which inhibits mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Calmodulin involvement was suggested by the inhibition of s1-AII induced changes in mRNA with 1 microM calmidazolium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

https://openalex.org/W1601703062,"Cells containing increased levels of the membrane phosphoprotein P-glycoprotein exhibit a multidrug-resistant phenotype. In the present study we have analyzed protein kinases capable of phosphorylating P-glycoprotein in membranes of HL60 cells isolated for resistance to vincristine. Analysis of this system demonstrates that in isolated membranes the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine greatly reduces P-glycoprotein phosphorylation. In contrast, the kinase inhibitor H-7 does not affect this reaction. Fractionation of solubilized membrane proteins from sensitive and resistant cells on DEAE-cellulose reveals a major protein kinase (PK-1) which exhibits optimal activity in the presence of Mn2+ and histone H1. This enzyme fraction does not contain detectable levels of protein kinase C or cAMP-dependent protein kinase. PK-1 phosphorylation of two endogenous proteins is, however, greatly enhanced in the presence of phosphatidylserine or phosphatidyl-inositol. In reaction mixtures containing Mg2+ or Mn2+ in the absence of phospholipid, PK-1 from resistant cells phosphorylates an endogenous protein of 180 kilodaltons (P180), which exhibits an electrophoretic mobility identical to P-glycoprotein. In parallel experiments with PK-1 from sensitive cells there is no detectable phosphorylation of a P180 protein. P180 phosphorylated by PK-1 from resistant cells is immunoprecipitated by antibody against P-glycoprotein. Additional studies demonstrate that PK-1 is capable of phosphorylating specific synthetic peptides which correspond to the sequence of P-glycoprotein. Peptide phosphorylation occurs at both serine and threonine residues. These studies thus identify a novel membrane-associated protein kinase in HL60 cells which is capable of phosphorylating P-glycoprotein. This enzyme may have an important role in regulating levels of multidrug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1527391598,"Lysosomes of intestinal epithelial cells in vivo and in culture display strong immunoreactivity with monoclonal antibodies against various brush border enzymes as visualized by immunoelectron microscopy. Novel subcellular fractionation procedures were developed to study, by the pulse-chase technique and by internalization assays, the pathway along which two microvillar hydrolases, sucrase-isomaltase and dipeptidylpeptidase IV, are transported to lysosomes in the differentiated colon adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2. 7-9% of metabolically labeled sucrase-isomaltase of dipeptidylpeptidase IV were present in lysosomes after 7-8 h of chase as intact complex-glycosylated molecules. Appearance of these enzymes in lysosomes was biphasic. Endocytosis studies with radioiodinated antienzyme monoclonal antibodies (monovalent antigen-binding fragments) and by means of cell surface iodination revealed only slow transport of the enzymes to lysosomes at a low level. However, both enzymes were internalized with different efficiencies and recycled to the cell surface via endosomes. These results suggest that in Caco-2 cells a significant amount of newly synthesized sucrase-isomaltase and dipeptidylpeptidase IV is directly imported into lysosomes bypassing the brush border membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1505418107,"Incubation of human platelet-rich plasma with physiological amounts of insulin resulted in the increase of the binding of prostaglandin E1 by more than 2-fold when compared to the control platelets. Scatchard analysis of the binding of the prostaglandin to the hormone-treated platelets showed that the increased binding was due to the increase of receptor numbers rather than the increase of affinity of the binding sites. The membranes prepared from the insulin-treated platelets also showed similar enhanced binding of the prostaglandin. However, addition of insulin directly to the membranes isolated from the platelets which had not been previously incubated with the hormone failed to show any effect. This increased binding of the prostanoid to the membranes prepared from the insulin-treated platelets resulted in the stimulation of adenylate cyclase by more than 2-fold when compared with the control of membrane preparation by the prostaglandin alone. In contrast, treatment of platelets with the hormone which increased the prostanoid binding to these cells did not influence the cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activity of either the membrane or cytosolic fraction. The increase in the cellular level of cyclic AMP by prostaglandin E1 was 2-fold greater in the hormone-treated cells than in the case of untreated platelets stimulated by the agonist alone. The incubation of platelet-rich plasma with insulin, as expected, decreased the amount of prostaglandin E1 needed to inhibit platelet aggregation by more than 50% when compared to the control platelets."

To study expression of this gene, a 1548-base pair fragment (-1571 to -24 bp relative to the ATG initiator codon) of the human c-erb B2/neu 5'-noncoding region was isolated, sequenced, and analyzed with respect to basal and inducible activity using the luciferase expression vector pSVOAL delta 5'. This fragment contained an Alu repetitive element which was confirmed in two independent clones. Basal activity of the 1548-base pair fragment was equivalent to the epidermal growth factor receptor promoter region and 32 and 16% as active as the Herpes simplex thymidine kinase and Rous sarcoma virus promoters, respectively. Induction of luciferase activity was observed in response to epidermal growth factor, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, dibutyryl cAMP, and retinoic acid. Additive and synergistic responses with more than 30-fold increases were observed after treatment with combinations of inducing agents, indicating complex regulation of this gene. These results show that the promoter region of the c-erb B2/neu gene contains sequences that dictate regulatory responses to several environmental signals."
https://openalex.org/W1741469944,"Previous studies have demonstrated that antral somatostatin exerts inhibitory effects on gastrin cells via paracrine pathways, accomplished by its release from somatostatin-containing cells into the immediate interstitial environment of the gastrin cell. The present studies were directed to examine the effect of somatostatin on gastrin gene transcription in the dog antrum and to determine whether somatostatin modulates gastrin mRNA turnover. In response to the immunoneutralization of endogenous antral somatostatin, basal gastrin gene transcriptional activity increased by 34 +/- 3.3% (p less than 0.01). Moreover, somatostatin significantly inhibited gene transcription that had been stimulated by dibutyryl-cAMP and carbachol. To determine the effect of somatostatin on gastrin mRNA turnover, antral mucosal fragments were incubated with antibodies to somatostatin, total RNA was extracted, and gastrin mRNA was measured at several time points. Following the immunoneutralization of antral somatostatin, maximum induction was achieved at 60 min, at which time gastrin mRNA levels had increased by 184 +/- 6.0% (p less than 0.01). At that time, a somatostatin analogue which is biologically active, but nonimmunoreactive with the antiserum, was added to the incubation medium. The analogue produced a prompt and steady de-induction of gastrin mRNA concentration, which returned to basal levels by 120 min. Regression analysis of RNA induction and de-induction profiles demonstrated a 292 +/- 40.6% increase (p less than 0.01) in gastrin mRNA turnover induced by somatostatin. In separate experiments antral mucosa was incubated with cycloheximide, both in the presence and absence of somatostatin antibodies. Incubation in the presence of cycloheximide resulted in a 52.3 +/- 8.4% (p less than 0.01) increase in gastrin mRNA levels under basal conditions, but had no effect following antral somatostatin immunoneutralization. Our results indicate that, although somatostatin inhibits gastrin gene transcription, its predominant effect on gastrin gene expression appears to occur at the posttranscriptional level by increasing the turnover of gastrin mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W1547059905,"The mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P)/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) II receptor has separate binding sites for Man-6-P and IGF II. It targets newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes from the Golgi to acidic pre-lysosomal organelles and mediates endocytosis of Man-6-P-containing ligands and IGF II. The two classes of ligands, Man-6-P and IGF II, as well as IGF I and the epidermal growth factor, induce in fibroblasts a transient redistribution of the receptor from internal membranes to the cell surface (Braulke, T., Tippmer, S., Neher, E., and von Figura, K. (1989) EMBO J. 8, 681-686). Here we show that the redistribution induced by IGF I and IGF II is accomplished without affecting the internalization rate of cell surface receptors. The redistribution results in an increased binding of ligands to the Man-6-P- and IGF II-binding sites of the receptor. Furthermore, the uptake of the lysosomal enzyme arylsulfatase A and of a Man-6-P neoglycoprotein is stimulated 2-3-fold by IGF I and IGF II, and this effect persists for at least 6 h. The IGF I- and IGF II-induced receptor redistribution does not affect the targeting of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes. These results show that important functions of the Man-6-P/IGF II receptor such as binding and internalization of ligands can be up-regulated by the ligands of this receptor and other growth factors such as IGF I through redistribution of the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1517582103,"A fusion between a selectable multidrug resistance (MDR1) cDNA and an adenosine deaminase (ADA) cDNA concomitantly confers multidrug resistance and ADA activity on transfected cells. We have produced a Harvey murine sarcoma virus-derived, replication-defective, recombinant retrovirus to transduce this chimeric MDR-ADA gene efficiently into a great variety of cells. Infection with the MDR-ADA retrovirus conferred the multidrug resistance phenotype on drug-sensitive cells, therefore allowing selection in the presence of colchicine. Colchicine-resistant cells synthesized large amounts of a membrane-associated 210-kDa MDR-ADA fusion protein that preserved both MDR and ADA functional activities. To monitor expression of the chimeric gene in vivo, Kirsten virus-transformed NIH cells were infected with the MDR-ADA retrovirus, and after drug-selection, injected into athymic nude mice. Tumors developed that contained the bifunctionally active MDR-ADA fusion protein. When these mouse tumor cells were placed in tissue culture without the selecting drug, they did not lose the bifunctionally active MDR-ADA fusion protein. The replication-defective, recombinant MDR-ADA retrovirus should be useful to stably introduce the chimeric MDR-ADA gene into a variety of cell types for biological experiments in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1487810267,"Protein kinases which co-purify with clathrin-coated vesicles are known to phosphorylate in vitro the 50-kDa subunit of the HA-II adaptor complex and upon inclusion of polylysine the beta-light chain of clathrin and polypeptides above 100 kDa. Here we relate the high molecular mass phosphoproteins to the known subunits of the adaptor protein complexes and to other clathrin-associated proteins by means of immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibodies, two-dimensional electrophoresis, or electrophoresis in urea-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Our results show that some of the labeling of the 100-120-kDa region is accounted for by the beta'- and gamma-subunits of the HA-I adaptor complex, the alpha a-, and, to a lesser extent, by the beta-subunits of the HA-II adaptor complex. In addition, we found the assembly protein AP 180 and a hitherto undescribed 110-kDa coat polypeptide to be heavily phosphorylated upon release of these proteins from the coated vesicle membrane. In all cases, labeling was confined to serine residues."
https://openalex.org/W1482386130,"Intact secretory granules isolated from bovine adrenal medulla express tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity. Granule-associated TH sediments on continuous sucrose gradients with dopamine beta-hydroxylase, a marker for granule membranes, indicating that TH is associated with chromaffin granules. Membranes prepared from lysed granules retain TH, whereas granule contents are free of the enzyme. TH immunoreactivity was detected in granule membranes by immunoblot analysis using a polyclonal antiserum against TH. TH immunoreactivity cannot be removed from membranes by washes in high ionic strength buffers and is only partially removed from membranes by treatment with either urea or Na2CO3. TH can be removed from granule membranes by the detergents Nonidet P-40, Triton X-100, and 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate. Treatment of membranes with a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C did not remove TH, ruling out the possibility of a glycosyl phosphatidyl anchor. Fractionation of granule membranes by temperature-induced phase separation in Triton X-114 revealed that TH is recovered in phases in which integral (detergent phase) and hydrophobic (phospholipid phase) membrane proteins are typically found. By contrast, TH from adrenal cytosol fractionated exclusively into the aqueous phase along with other soluble proteins. Digestion of granules with various protease enzymes revealed that TH is resistant to degradation, suggesting that the enzyme is embedded within membranes. TH becomes phosphorylated when intact granules are exposed to the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, indicating that at least the N-terminal region of TH is exposed on the cytoplasmic surface of granules. These results establish that a fraction of TH is an integral component of bovine granule membranes. The association of TH with granule membranes may play a role in coordinating TH activity and catecholamine release."
https://openalex.org/W1559733556,"In nontransformed DHFR/G-8 cells (NIH 3T3 cells transfected with normal rat neu gene), the normal neu gene product was initially synthesized as a 170-kDa protein bearing endoglycosidase H-sensitive oligosaccharide chains and was then processed to a 175-kDa mature form with endoglycosidase H-resistant, endoglycosidase F-sensitive oligosaccharide chains. Most of this 175-kDa mature form appeared on the cell surface 2 h following synthesis and showed a half-life of approximately 3 h. In the presence of a growth factor(s) partially purified from bovine kidney, the half-life of this 175-kDa normal neu gene product was shortened to less than 30 min. In B104-1-1 cells (NIH 3T3 cells transfected with neu gene activated oncogenically by a point mutation that changes a valine residue to a glutamic acid residue in the putative transmembrane region), the oncogenically activated neu gene product was also synthesized as a 170-kDa precursor with endoglycosidase H-sensitive oligosaccharide chains. However, this 170-kDa precursor diminished very fast and was only partially processed to a 185-kDa mature form which exhibited a half-life of less than 30 min. The 185-kDa activated neu gene product possessed an unidentified post-translational modification in addition to N-linked oligosaccharide chains. Both the precursor and mature forms of the mutationally activated neu gene product showed increased tyrosine-specific phosphorylation as compared with those of their normal counterparts in DHFR/G-8 cells. The mutationally activated neu gene product in B104-1-1 cells shared several features which have been reported previously for the ligand-activated platelet-derived growth factor receptor in v-sis- or c-sis-transformed cells. These properties include: 1) accelerated turnover of the precursor and mature forms compared with the rates of turnover of its normal counterparts, 2) insensitivity of this rapid turnover to lysosomotropic amines, and 3) increased in vivo tyrosine-specific phosphorylation of both the precursor and mature forms. These findings suggest that the mutationally activated neu gene product may transform the cells by mimicking ligand-induced activation."
https://openalex.org/W2076051066,"Coculture of sympathetic neurons with ganglion nonneuronal cells elevated levels of preprosomatostatin mRNA but did not alter neuronal synthesis, content, or release of somatostatin. Treatment of sympathetic neurons with culture medium conditioned by exposure to ganglion nonneuronal cells similarly elevated preprosomatostatin mRNA. Treatment with conditioned medium elevated somatostatin levels in pure neuronal cultures, but not in neurons cocultured with nonneuronal cells. Conditioned medium also failed to increase peptide levels in neurons cultured on a substratum of killed nonneuronal cells, despite a large increase in preprosomatostatin mRNA. These observations suggest that contact of sympathetic neurons with nonneuronal cell membranes inhibits the increase in peptide synthesis, but not the increase in preprosomatostatin mRNA after treatment with conditioned medium. Thus neuronal interactions with nonneuronal cells regulate somatostatin metabolism at both the mRNA and peptide levels. Regulatory effects on the mRNA and the peptide are separable and do not necessarily occur in parallel, and translational controls may be the rate-limiting factors."
https://openalex.org/W1568937091,"The active site of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase is constituted from domains of adjacent subunits and includes an intersubunit electrostatic interaction between Lys 168 and Glu48, which has been recently identified by x-ray crystallography (Andersson, I., Knight, S., Schneider, G., Lindqvist, Y., Lundqvist, T., Branden, C.-I., and Lorimer, G.H. (1989) Nature 337, 229-234; Lundqvist, T., and Schneider, G. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 7078-7083). To examine the structural and functional requirements for this interaction, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to replace Lys168 of the homodimeric enzyme from Rhodospirillum rubrum with arginine, glutamine, or glutamic acid. All three substitutions result in mutant enzymes with less than or equal to 0.1% of wild-type activity. The nonconservative substitution of Lys168 with a glutamyl residue precludes the formation of a stable dimer, explaining the consequential abolition of enzymic activity. Both the Arg168 and Gln168 mutant proteins are isolated as stable dimers, even though the latter obviously lacks an electrostatic interaction present in the wild-type enzyme. Despite the absence of overall carboxylase activity, these two mutant proteins serve as catalysts for the enolization of ribulose bisphosphate, as measured by exchange of the C3 proton with solvent. These observations, as well as ligand-binding properties of the mutant proteins, are consistent with Lys168 facilitating a catalytic step subsequent to enolization."

https://openalex.org/W1487487512,"Tetrahymena calmodulin (CaM) differs from mammalian CaM in its ability to activate Tetrahymena guanylate cyclase. Of 12 differences in amino acid sequence, two occur near the carboxyl terminus (Gln-143----Arg and Thr-146----deletion). To investigate the functional significance of the carboxyl-terminal region in activation of the guanylate cyclase, three mutated CaMs were engineered by using cassette mutagenesis of rat CaM cDNA: Gln-143----Arg (CaM.A), Thr-146----deletion (CaM.D), and Gln-143----Arg/Thr-146 deletion (CaM.AD). Recombinant wild type CaM (wCaM), CaM.A, CaM.D, and CaM.AD were indistinguishable in their ability to activate cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase. The two mutated CaMs (CaM.A and CaM.AD) with the Gln-143 replacement activated guanylate cyclase of Tetrahymena plasma membrane in the presence of Ca2+, with the maximal activation being half of that produced by Tetrahymena CaM. In contrast, neither CaM.D nor wCaM could stimulate the cyclase activity. A CaM antagonist, W-7 (N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide), prevented the cyclase activation by either Tetrahymena CaM, CaM.A, or CaM.AD. Thus, we conclude that Arg-143 is in a region of the molecule involved in activation of Tetrahymena guanylate cyclase. The data also suggest that the cyclase activation by Tetrahymena CaM requires complex macromolecular interactions between the entire CaM molecule and the enzyme."
