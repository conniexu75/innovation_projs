https://openalex.org/W2085206941,"Human CTF/NF-I consists of a family of CCAAT box binding proteins that activate both transcription and DNA replication. Analysis of cDNA mutants expressed in E. coli and Drosophila cells reveals that the N-terminal portion of CTF-1 is sufficient for site-specific DNA recognition, protein dimerization, and adenovirus replication. In contrast, transcriptional activation requires an additional C-terminal domain. Furthermore, this transcription domain efficiently activates a heterologous promoter, such as SV40, when fused to the DNA binding domain of Sp1. The CTF C-terminal region consists of an unusual type of transcriptional activation domain containing approximately 25% proline residues. We propose that this proline-rich domain represents a novel class of activators which are distinct from those containing either acidic or glutamine-rich activation motifs. This indicates that transcriptional activation is likely to be mediated by several different mechanisms. In addition, these results suggest that the interactions, and consequently the mechanisms, governing transcriptional activation by CTF are distinct from those mediating DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W2030333654,"The three-dimensional solution structure of a zinc finger nucleic acid binding motif has been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Spectra of a synthetic peptide corresponding to a single zinc finger from the Xenopus protein Xfin yielded distance and dihedral angle constraints that were used to generate structures from distance geometry and restrained molecular dynamics calculations. The zinc finger is an independently folded domain with a compact globular structure in which the zinc atom is bound by two cysteine and two histidine ligands. The polypeptide backbone fold consists of a well-defined helix, starting as alpha and ending as 3(10) helix, packed against two beta strands that are arranged in a hairpin structure. A high density of basic and polar amino acid side chains on the exposed face of the helix are probably involved in DNA binding."
https://openalex.org/W2164464592,"The products of the nuclear oncogenes fos and jun are known to form heterodimers that bind to DNA and modulate transcription. Both proteins contain a leucine zipper that is important for heterodimer formation. Peptides corresponding to these leucine zippers were synthesized. When mixed, these peptides preferentially form heterodimers over homodimers by at least 1000-fold. Both homodimers and the heterodimer are parallel alpha helices. The leucine zipper regions from Fos and Jun therefore correspond to autonomous helical dimerization sites that are likely to be short coiled coils, and these regions are sufficient to determine the specificity of interaction between Fos and Jun. The Fos leucine zipper forms a relatively unstable homodimer. Instability of homodimers provides a thermodynamic driving force for preferential heterodimer formation."
https://openalex.org/W1964459498,"We have developed a sensitive polymerase chain reaction assay for measuring the fraction of rearranged immunoglobulin kappa genes in a cell population. Using this assay with Abelson virus-transformed murine pre-B cells, we have found that bacterial lipopolysaccharide treatment, which activates transcription of the unrearranged kappa constant region gene, also activates kappa gene rearrangement. In addition, we have been able to detect kappa gene rearrangement in cell lines that do not produce a functional heavy chain gene product (mu protein). These results implicate transcription or transcription factor binding as a regulator of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement."
https://openalex.org/W2007760520,"The predicted amino acid sequence of a newly identified gene of the insect baculovirus Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus was similar to several uridine 5′-diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyl transferases and at least one UDP-glucosyl transferase. Genetic and biochemical studies confirmed that this gene encodes an ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyl transferase (egt). This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose to ecdysteroids, which are insect molting hormones. Expression of the egt gene allowed the virus to interfere with normal insect development so that molting was blocked in infected larvae of fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda)."

T lymphocytes that express the V beta 6 variable region are positively selected in the thymus by cells expressing major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II E molecules. To identify these cells, we have quantitated V beta 6+ T lymphocytes in a set of transgenic mice showing variant patterns of E expression in the thymus. We demonstrate that class II molecules must be expressed on epithelial cells of the cortex for positive selection to occur. Using a direct assay of unmanipulated thymocytes, we show that positive selection is manifest only as a rather late event in thymocyte differentiation, after the maturation of cortical double-positives into single-positives."
https://openalex.org/W1534757774,"Recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), produced by expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells, is a fibrin-specific plasminogen activator which has been approved for clinical use in the treatment of myocardial infarction. In this study, the structures of the Asn-linked oligosaccharides of Chinese hamster ovary-expressed rt-PA have been elucidated. High mannose and hybrid oligosaccharides were released from the protein by endoglycosidase H digestion, whereas N-acetyllactosamine-type (complex) oligosaccharides were released by peptide:N-glycosidase F digestion. The oligosaccharides were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography and anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and their structures were analyzed by composition and methylation analysis, high pH anion exchange chromatography, fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (FAB-MS), and 500-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy. High mannose oligosaccharides were found to account for 38% of the total carbohydrate content of rt-PA and consisted of Man5GlcNAc2, Man6GlcNAc2, and Man7GlcNAc2 in the ratio 1.8:1.7:1. Two hybrid oligosaccharides were identified and accounted for 3% of the carbohydrate of rt-PA. The N-acetyllactosamine-type oligosaccharides were found to comprise diantennary (34% of total carbohydrate), 2,4-branched triantennary (11%), 2,6-branched triantennary (9%), and tetraantennary (5%) structures. Sialylation of these oligosaccharides was by alpha (2----3) linkages to galactose. Most (greater than 90%) of the N-acetyllactosamine-type structures contained fucose alpha (1----6) linked to the Asn-linked N-acetylglucosamine residue. The distribution of oligosaccharide structures at individual glycosylation sites (Asn residues 117, 184, and 448) was also determined. rt-PA exists as two variants that differ by the presence (type I) or absence (type II) of carbohydrate at Asn-184. Tryptic glycopeptides were isolated by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography and treated with peptide:N-glycosidase F. The oligosaccharides released from each glycosylation site were analyzed by high pH anion exchange chromatography. By this analysis, Asn-117 was demonstrated to carry exclusively high mannose oligosaccharides. When glycosylated, Asn-184 carried diantennary, 2,4-branched triantennary, 2,6-branched triantennary, and tetraantennary N- acetyllactosamine oligosaccharides in the ratio 9.0:4.5:1.4:1. Asn- 448 carried the same types of oligosaccharides, but in the ratio 7.5:1.6:2.1:1. The distributions of Asn-linked oligosaccharides at positions 117 and 448 were found not to be affected by the presence or absence of carbohydrate at position 184. The relevance of the"
https://openalex.org/W1548193792,"Pseudomonas exotoxin is composed of three structural domains that are responsible for cell recognition, membrane translocation, and ADP-ribosylation. The substitution of the cell recognition domain (domain Ia) with a growth factor such as transforming growth factor α (TGFα), creates a cell-specific cytotoxic agent, TGFα-PE40, which kills cells bearing epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors. We have used TGFα-PE40 to define the role of sequences in domains II, Ib, and III. Various mutations were made in these domains and mutant forms of TGFα-PE40 expressed in Escherichia coli. Mutant proteins were then tested for their ADP-ribosylation, EGF receptor-binding, and cell-killing activities. Additionally, the amino boundary of domain III, which contains the ADP-ribosylation activity, was determined by deletion analysis. Data indicate that (i) the functional amino terminus of domain III is near amino acid 400; (ii) deletion of various regions in domain II or conversion of cysteines 265 and 268 to serines results in a loss of cytotoxicity which ranged from 10-fold to more than 150-fold, indicating that domain II is essential for full expression of cytotoxicity; (iii) deletion of the amino terminus of domain Ib results in a molecule with somewhat increased cytotoxic activity, indicating that domain Ib is not essential for the cytotoxic effect of TGFα-PE40; and (iv) TGFα-PE40, produced by denaturing and refolding of insoluble material from inclusion bodies, binds better to EGF receptors and is about 10-fold more cytotoxic to cells bearing EGF receptors than is the secreted form of soluble TGFα-PE40."
https://openalex.org/W1608445874,"Abstract The defect in a kindred with marked plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) deficiency and premature atherosclerosis was examined. The homozygous proband died of coronary artery atherosclerosis at age 45 and had undetectable levels of plasma apolipoproteins A-I and C-III, proteins of HDL. In family studies 10 heterozygotes were identified whose mean apoA-I, apoC-III, apoA-IV, and HDL cholesterol levels were 67, 57, 65, and 62% of normal. These subjects were noted to have restriction fragment length polymorphisms following DNA digestion with a number of enzymes including BamHI, EcoRI, HindIII, XmnI, PstI, and PvuII, following hybridization with a probe spanning 1.1 kilobases approximately 2.5 kilobases 5' to the apoA-I gene. Cloning and sequence analysis of the abnormal allele indicated that the defect is due to the complete deletion of the apoA-I, -C-III, and -A-IV gene complex on chromosome 11, with both ends of the deletion being located in areas of highly repetitive DNA. The data support the concept of an independent role for HDL in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W1480906932,"Swiss-3T3 cells were scrape-loaded with oncogenically activated p21ras protein. 10-20 min after introducing Val12p21ras into the cell, diacylglycerol levels were increased, but levels of inositol phosphates were unaltered. However, cellular choline and phosphocholine levels were increased with a similar time course to that observed for diacylglycerol production, suggesting that ras increases phosphatidylcholine turnover but not phosphatidylinositol turnover. Down-regulation of protein kinase C (by prolonged exposure to phorbol esters prior to scrape loading) blocked the ability of ras protein to elevate the levels of diacylglycerol, choline, and phosphocholine. Oncogenic ras can, therefore, cause a substantial increase in diacylglycerol (which correlates with increased phosphatidylcholine breakdown) in a protein kinase C-dependent fashion. Val12p21ras also increased arachidonic acid release, which was also dependent on protein kinase C activation. Induction of DNA synthesis by oncogenic ras was unaffected by inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis, indicating that conversion of the released arachidonic acid to various prostaglandins is not required for stimulation of DNA synthesis by ras. We suggest that ras rapidly activates protein kinase C, which in turn activates a number of cellular signalling systems, leading to a sustained increase in diacylglycerol levels. This elevation of diacylglycerol could sustain protein kinase C activation over the 12-15 h required for initiation of DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1572028032,"Adenylate cyclase (AC) toxins produced by Bacillus anthracis and Bordetella pertussis were compared for their ability to interact with and intoxicate Chinese hamster ovary cells. At 30 degrees C, anthrax AC toxin exhibited a lag of 10 min for measurable cAMP accumulation that was not seen with pertussis AC toxin. This finding is consistent with previous data showing inhibition of anthrax AC toxin but not pertussis AC toxin entry by inhibitors of receptor-mediated endocytosis (Gordon, V. M., Leppla, S. H., and Hewlett, E. L. (1988) Infect. Immun. 56, 1066-1069). Treatment of target Chinese hamster ovary cells with trypsin or cycloheximide reduced anthrax AC toxin-induced cAMP accumulation by greater than 90%, but was without effect on pertussis AC toxin. In contrast, incubation of the AC toxins with gangliosides prior to addition to target cells inhibited cAMP accumulation by pertussis AC toxin, but not anthrax AC toxin. To evaluate the role of lipids in the interaction of pertussis AC toxin with membranes, multicompartmental liposomes were loaded with a fluorescent marker and exposed to toxin. Pertussis AC toxin elicited marker release in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and required a minimal calcium concentration of 0.2 mM. These data demonstrate that the requirements for intoxication by the AC toxins from B. anthracis and B. pertussis are fundamentally different and provide a perspective for new approaches to study the entry processes."
https://openalex.org/W1607692727,"We have separated multiple small Mr GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) from bovine brain membranes by several column chromatographies and purified to near homogeneity four of them, including a novel Mr 24,000 G protein (smg p25A), a novel Mr 22,000 G protein (smg p21), the rho protein (rho p20), and the c-Ki-ras protein (c-Ki-ras p21). Among these small Mr G proteins, only smg p21 is phosphorylated stoichiometrically by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A), and c-Ki-ras p21 is phosphorylated to a small extent by protein kinase A in a cell-free system. None of smg p25A, rho p20, and other partially purified small Mr G proteins is phosphorylated by protein kinase A. Neither smg p21 nor other small Mr G proteins are phosphorylated by protein kinase C. About 1 mol of phosphate is maximally incorporated into 1 mol of smg p21 by protein kinase A. Only serine residue(s) are phosphorylated. The guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio) triphosphate (GTP gamma S)-bound and GDP-bound forms of smg p21 are phosphorylated with the same reaction velocity. The phosphorylation of smg p21 affects neither its GTP gamma S-binding nor GTPase activity. smg p21 is found in human platelets, and this human platelet smg p21 is also phosphorylated by protein kinase A at the same site(s) as bovine brain smg p21 in a cell-free system. When intact human platelets are stimulated by prostaglandin E1 known to elevate the cAMP level, four proteins with apparent Mr values of 240,000, 50,000, 24,000, and 22,000 are phosphorylated. These four proteins are also phosphorylated by the action of dibutyryl cAMP but not by the action of thrombin, Ca2+ ionophore A23187, or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Among the four proteins, the Mr 22,000 protein is identified as smg p21. The site(s) of phosphorylation of smg p21 by protein kinase A in a cell-free system are identical to that phosphorylated in response to prostaglandin E1 in intact platelets. These results indicate that among many small Mr G proteins, smg p21 is selectively phosphorylated by protein kinase A and that this G protein is also phosphorylated by this protein kinase in response to prostaglandin E1 in intact human platelets."
https://openalex.org/W1586300215,"In search of the target protease for the tumor-associated trypsin inhibitor TATI we recently identified a trypsin-like protease in cyst fluid of mucinous ovarian tumors (Stenman, U.-H., Koivunen, E., and Vuento, M. (1988) Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler 369, 9–14). We have now purified this protease and demonstrate that it represents isoenzyme forms of trypsinogen, here called tumor-associated trypsin(ogen)s (TAT). The purification procedure comprised batchwise anion exchange chromatography, immunoaffinity chromatography with antibodies to trypsin, and separation of the two isoenzymes by reverse phase chromatography. In sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-gel electrophoresis, the TAT-1 and TAT-2 isoenzymes have relative molecular weights (Mr) of 25,000 and 28,000, respectively, TAT-2 being the major component. The amino-terminal amino acid sequences correspond to those of pancreatic trypsinogen-1 and −2, respectively, and activation of the zymogens results in cleavage of a NH2-terminal activation peptide of 8 residues characteristic of trypsinogen. Isoelectric focusing in the presence of urea gives pI values of about 5 and 4 for TAT-1 and −2, respectively. The substrate specificities of the two TAT isoenzymes are very similar to, but not identical with, those of trypsin-1 and trypsin-2, respectively, suggesting slight differences in substrate binding site. TAT was found to be an efficient activator of pro-urokinase. Hence, TAT could take part in the protease cascade associated with tumor invasion."

The nucleotide sequence of the entire coding region has been determined. The deduced amino acid sequence indicates that the human enzyme is 84% identical to the bovine lens aldose reductase and 85% identical to the rat lens aldose reductase. It is also very similar to the human aldehyde reductase, the bovine prostaglandin F synthase, and to the European common frog rho-crystallin. The deduced amino acid sequence also indicates that maturation of aldose reductase involves removal of the N-terminal methionine."

https://openalex.org/W1553962583,"Abstract Platelet responses are inhibited by agents such as prostaglandin E1 that increase the cytoplasmic concentration of cyclic AMP. Inhibition is thought to result from phosphorylation of specific proteins. One protein that becomes phosphorylated is glycoprotein (GP) Ib beta, a component of the GP Ib.IX complex. We have suggested that phosphorylation of GP Ib beta inhibits the collagen-induced polymerization of actin. The aim of the present study was to identify the amino acid(s) in GP Ib beta that is phosphorylated. Purified GP Ib.IX complex was phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of purified bovine cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase in the presence of [gamma-32P]ATP. Phosphoamino acid analysis showed that in GP Ib beta, [32P]phosphate was incorporated only into serine and was in a single tryptic peptide. Amino acid sequencing showed that this peptide was from the cytoplasmic domain of GP Ib beta and encompassed residues 161-175. A single serine residue, serine 166, contained the radiolabel. To determine whether the same residue was phosphorylated in intact platelets, GP Ib beta was isolated from 32P-labeled platelets before or after their exposure to prostaglandin E1. In both cases, radiolabel was present in phosphoserine and was in a single tryptic peptide. This peptide was the same as that which was phosphorylated in the purified GP Ib.IX complex, as shown by its identical mobility on two-dimensional tryptic maps, the presence of a positively charged residue in the fourth position, and the presence of the radiolabel in the sixth position of the peptide. This study shows that when cyclic AMP concentrations rise in platelets, the cytoplasmic domain of GP Ib beta is phosphorylated on serine 166, probably by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. We suggest that phosphorylation of this residue may contribute to the inhibitory actions of cyclic AMP by inhibiting collagen-induced polymerization of actin."
https://openalex.org/W1562083902,"Abstract The region containing two copies of the sequence GGGACTTTCC in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat, that is an NF-kappa B binding site, functions as an enhancer element for HIV transcriptional regulation. By a Southwestern method we have isolated a cDNA encoding the HIV-1 enhancer binding protein (HIV-EP1) from a human B-cell lambda gt11 library. DNase I footprinting analysis using the HIV-EP1 protein expressed in Escherichia coli showed that HIV-EP1 specifically bound to the HIV-1 enhancer. HIV-EP1 protein contains a domain with two tandem zinc finger sequences initially described in the Xenopus transcription factor IIIA. This represents the first demonstration of the structural feature of the protein that binds to the HIV-1 enhancer."
https://openalex.org/W1491997067,"Abstract Tumor-promoting phorbol esters stimulate tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) release from human endothelial cells, and simultaneous elevation of cyclic AMP potentiates this response 5-fold (Santell, L., and Levin, E. G. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 16802-16808). A similar effect on tPA mRNA was observed, with phorbol myristate acetate inducing a 3.5-fold increase in steady state tPA mRNA levels and forskolin enhancing that increase to 25-fold. Peak levels occurred at 8 h after agonist addition and returned to baseline levels by 16 h. As was found with tPA antigen secretion, delayed addition of forskolin reduced the level of potentiation, and, at 6 h after phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), forskolin was no longer effective. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide did not inhibit the rise in tPA mRNA levels in response to PMA/forskolin nor the decline in mRNA levels between 8 and 12 h. However, peak levels (8 h) were approximately 1.5-fold higher than in cultures not treated with cycloheximide. The effect of two inhibitors of protein kinases, H-7 and staurosporine, on PMA-induced tPA antigen secretion and tPA mRNA levels were examined. H-7 and staurosporine inhibited PMA, and PMA/forskolin induced tPA secretion in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was time-dependent; the inhibitory effect was reduced with delayed H-7 addition, and, by 6 h after PMA treatment, no inhibition was observed. H-7 and staurosporine also inhibited the PMA/forskolin-induced increase in tPA mRNA levels and were less effective the later they were added. The same time-dependent effect on the potentiation of PMA-induced tPA mRNA levels by forskolin was observed. Again, delayed addition reduced the effect, and, by 6 h, potentiation was absent. The results of this study indicate that changes in mRNA levels in response to PMA and PMA/forskolin precede and determine those that occur to tPA antigen secretion. In addition, the maximal response is dependent upon the prolonged activation of an H-7- and cAMP-sensitive pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1680806982,"The binding of porcine heart mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase and beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase to bovine heart NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I), but not that of bovine heart alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, is virtually abolished by 0.1 mM NADH. The malate dehydrogenase and beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA enzymes compete in part for the same binding site(s) on complex I as do the malate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex enzymes. Associations between mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase and bovine serum albumin were observed. Subtle convection artifacts in short-time centrifugation tests of enzyme association with the Beckman Airfuge are described. Substrate channeling of NADH from both the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase isozymes to complex I and reduction of ubiquinone-1 were shown to occur in vitro by transient enzyme-enzyme complex formation. Excess apoenzyme causes little inhibition of the substrate channeling reaction with both malate dehydrogenase isozymes in spite of tighter equilibrium binding than the holoenzyme to complex I. This substrate channeling could, in principle, provide a dynamic microcompartmentation of mitochondrial NADH."
https://openalex.org/W348240306,"The steroid binding domain of the rat glucocorticoid receptor is considered as extending from amino acids 550 to 795. However, such a synthetic protein (i.e. amino acids 547-795; Mr approximately 31,000) has been reported to show very little affinity for the potent synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone. We now disclose that digestion of steroid-free rat glucocorticoid receptors with low concentrations of trypsin yields a single species, of Mr = 16,000, that is specifically labeled by dexamethasone 21-mesylate. This 16-kDa fragment retains high affinity binding for [3H]dexamethasone that is only approximately 23-fold lower than that seen with the intact 98-kDa receptor. Analysis of the protease digestion patterns obtained both with trypsin and with lysylendopeptidase C allowed us to deduce the proteolytic cleavage maps of the receptor with these enzymes. From these protease maps, the sequence of the 16-kDa fragment was identified as being threonine 537 to arginine 673. These results show that glucocorticoid receptor fragments smaller than 34 kDa do bind steroids and that the amino acids Thr537-Arg673 constitute a core sequence for ligand binding within the larger steroid binding domain. The much slower kinetics in generating the 16-kDa fragment from affinity-labeled receptors suggests that steroid binding causes a conformation change in the receptor near the cleavage sites."

Here we describe a cell-free system in which the formation of these carrier vesicles is reconstituted. Vesicle formation and release occurred specifically from the TGN and were dependent on ATP and cytosol. The released vesicles were isolated by density gradient sedimentation and specific immunoadsorption. Electron microscopy demonstrated that the vesicles had a diameter of 84 ± 6 nm. The immunoisolated vesicles had a highly simplified protein pattern on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.
https://openalex.org/W1517232320,"Treatment of cytochrome P-450scc with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) resulted in covalent labeling with 1.0 ± 0.1 eq of FITC. Reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography of tryptic and chymotryptic digests of the labeled protein revealed that a single FITC-labeled peptide accounted for 75% of the label. This peptide was found to be specifically labeled at lysine 338 by amino acid sequencing. The modification of lysine 338 with FITC resulted in 85 ± 15% inhibition of adrenodoxin binding to cytochrome P-450scc. In a complementary experiment it was found that if a complex between adrenodoxin and native cytochrome P-450scc was formed in the presence of cholesterol and then treated with FITC, there was almost no labeling of lysine 338. The modification of lysine 338 by FITC was not inhibited by 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, the first intermediate in the side chain cleavage reaction which binds to the active site 300 times more tightly than cholesterol itself. These experiments suggest that lysine 338 is located at the binding site for adrenodoxin and electrostatically interacts with one of the carboxylate groups on adrenodoxin that has been implicated in binding. The fluorescence emission of the FITC label on cytochrome P-450scc was only 14% as large as that of an equivalent concentration of FITC-labeled bovine serum albumin, suggesting that it was quenched by Forster energy transfer to the heme group."
https://openalex.org/W1597849822,"Abstract Thyroid hormones exert effects on the hormone-sensitive adenylate cyclase. Regulation of the expression of Gi (Gi alpha 2) and Gs by thyroid hormones in vivo was investigated at the level of mRNA. Steady-state levels of the mRNA for Gi alpha 2 and Gs alpha, as well as the G beta-subunits, were quantified using DNA excess solution hybridization analysis. Regulation of protein and mRNA expression in adipose tissue was investigated in hypothyroid, euthyroid, and hyperthyroid rats. In euthyroid animals, steady-state levels of mRNA (amol/microgram RNA) were 13.8, 5.9, and 5.7 for Gs alpha, Gi alpha 2, and G beta 1,2, respectively. Activation of adenylate cyclase by Gs is unaffected by thyroid status. Both Gs alpha and Gs alpha mRNA levels in hypothyroid rats were the same as those of controls (euthyroid). The inhibitory control of adenylate cyclase, in contrast, is markedly potentiated in hypothyroid rats. The expression of G1 alpha s and G beta-subunits was increased in hypothyroidism. Whereas Gi alpha 2 mRNA levels remained essentially unchanged, G beta 1,2 mRNA levels were observed to increase 45% in the hypothyroid state. In the hyperthyroid state G beta 1,2 mRNA levels were observed to decline by 35%. Regulation of G-protein subunit expression, at the level of mRNA, appears to be one component of permissive hormone action on transmembrane signalling."
https://openalex.org/W1555602949,"Abstract Prostaglandin H synthase catalyzes two reactions: the bis-dioxygenation of arachidonic acid to form prostaglandin G2 (cyclooxygenase activity), and the reduction of hydroperoxides to the corresponding alcohols (peroxidase activity). The cyclooxygenase activity can be selectively inhibited by many nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents including indomethacin. In the native synthase, there is a single prominent protease-sensitive region, located near Arg253; binding of the heme prosthetic group makes the synthase resistant to proteases. To investigate the spatial relationship between the area of the synthase which interacts with indomethacin and the protease-sensitive region, the effects of indomethacin and similar agents on the protease sensitivity of the two enzymatic activities and of the synthase polypeptide were examined. Incubation of the synthase apoenzyme with trypsin (3.6% w/w) resulted in the time-dependent coordinate loss (75% at 1 h) of both enzymatic activities and the cleavage (85% at 1 h) of the 70-kDa subunit into 38- and 33-kDa fragments, indicating that proteolytic cleavage of the polypeptide at Arg253, destroyed both activities of the synthase simultaneously. Indomethacin, (S)-flurbiprofen, or meclofenamate (each at 20 microM) rendered both activities and the synthase polypeptide (at 5 microM subunit) resistant to attack by trypsin or proteinase K; these agents also inhibited the cyclooxygenase activity of the intact synthase. Two reversible cyclooxygenase inhibitors, ibuprofen and flufenamate, also made both of the activities and the synthase polypeptide more resistant to trypsin. Titration of the apoenzyme with indomethacin (0-3 mol/mol of synthase dimer) resulted in proportional increases in the inhibition of the cyclooxygenase and in the resistance to attack by trypsin. (R)-Flurbiprofen did not increase the resistance to protease or appreciably inhibit the cyclooxygenase. These results suggest that the same stereospecific interaction of these agents with the synthase that produced inhibition of the cyclooxygenase led to a decreased accessibility of the Arg253 region to proteases. Aspirin treatment made the synthase less resistant to trypsin; aspirin-treated synthase became more resistant to trypsin when it was incubated with indomethacin before addition of the protease. The presence of 50 microM arachidonate during digestion of apoenzyme or aspirin-treated apoenzyme with trypsin did not decrease the cleavage of the synthase subunit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

A portion of solubilized receptors which displays high affinity GTP-sensitive agonist binding (40-50%) adheres tightly to agonist affinity columns composed of N6-aminobenzyladenosine-agarose. A1 adenosine receptors and G proteins are rapidly and selectively coeluted from agonist columns by the addition of 8-p-sulfophenyltheophylline, but only in combination with Mg2+-GTP or N-ethylmaleimide, agents which lower the affinity of receptors for agonists. Purified receptors and G protein alpha-subunits can be detected with the potent A1-selective antagonist radioligand, [125I]3-(4-amino-3-iodo)phenethyl-1-propyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (125I-BW-A844U) and [35S]guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate [( 35S]GTP gamma S), respectively. Pretreatment of solubilized receptors with 0.1 mM N-ethylmaleimide or 0.1 mM R-phenylisopropyladenosine abolishes adsorption of receptors and G proteins to affinity columns. Following removal of 8-p-sulfophenyltheophylline and GTP, purified receptors bind agonists (2 sites) and antagonists (1 site) with affinities similar to crude soluble receptors and typical of A1 receptors. Some receptors may be denatured as a result of purification since only 23% of the radioligand binding sites which adhere to the affinity column can be detected in the eluate. The Bmax of purified receptors, 820 +/- 100 pmol/mg protein (n = 3) is 1800-fold higher than crude soluble receptors. The specific activity of [35S]GTP gamma S binding sites in affinity column eluates is 4640 pmol/mg protein. Assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry, this specific activity indicates that receptor-G protein complexes are greater than 50% pure following affinity chromatography. The photoaffinity labeled purified receptor was identified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a single band with a molecular mass of 35 kDa which when deglycosylated undergoes a characteristic shift in molecular mass to a sharp band at 32 kDa. In addition to the receptor, silver staining revealed polypeptides with molecular masses of 39 and 41 kDa, which are ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin, and 36 kDa corresponding to G protein beta-subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1607260051,"Abstract Microspectrophotometry of single crystals of the tryptophan synthase alpha 2 beta 2 complex from Salmonella typhimurium is used to compare the catalytic and regulatory properties of the enzyme in the soluble and crystalline states. Polarized absorption spectra demonstrate that chromophoric intermediates are formed between pyridoxal phosphate at the active site of the beta subunit and added substrates, substrate analogs, and reaction intermediate analogs. Although the crystalline and soluble forms of the enzyme produce some of the same enzyme-substrate intermediates, including Schiff base and quinonoid intermediates, in some cases the equilibrium distribution of these intermediates differs in the two states of the enzyme. Ligands which bind to the active site of the alpha subunit alter the distribution of intermediates formed at the active site of the beta subunit in both the crystalline and soluble states. The three-dimensional structures of the tryptophan synthase alpha 2 beta 2 complex and of a derivative with indole-3-propanol phosphate bound at the active site of the alpha subunit have recently been reported (Hyde, C. C., Ahmed, S. A., Padlan, E. A., Miles, E. W., and Davies, D. R. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 17857-17871). Our present findings help to establish experimental conditions for selecting defined intermediates for future x-ray crystallographic analysis of the alpha 2 beta 2 complex with ligands bound at the active sites of both alpha and beta subunits. These crystallographic studies should explain how catalysis occurs at the active site of the beta subunit and how the binding of a ligand to one active site affects the binding of a ligand to the other active site which is 25 A away."
https://openalex.org/W1505396363,"The nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (EC 2.4.2.30) participates in DNA excision repair by post-translational selfmodification (automodification) and the modification of other chromatin proteins (heteromodification) with ADP-ribose polymers. We have studied the molecular mechanism of these reactions in a reconstituted in vitro system. After activation by DNA, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase produces polymers with a distinct size pattern. These polymers are attached to a small subfraction of enzyme molecules. As the reaction progresses, more enzyme molecules are recruited for modification with an identical polymer size pattern. Likewise, the auto- and heteromodification reaction in nucleosomal core particles involves the consecutive addition of a highly conserved polymer size pattern to the acceptor proteins. Thus, a highly conserved polymer size pattern may constitute the molecular signal priming chromatin proteins for a role in DNA excision repair in vivo. The priming reaction is processive."
https://openalex.org/W1577488314,"Human factor VIII circulates as a series of active heterodimers composed of a light chain (83 kDa) linked by divalent metal ion(s) to a variable sized heavy chain (93-210 kDa). Purified factor VIII subunits were modified with sulfhydryl-specific fluorophores. Probe selection was based upon the limited number of free cysteine residues in each subunit. Levels of probe incorporation suggested the presence of a single reactive cysteine residue per subunit. Amino-terminal sequence analysis of fluorescent tryptic peptides derived from the modified subunits indicated fluorophore attachment sites at Cys528 of the heavy chain (A2 domain) and Cys1858 of the light chain (A3 domain). Subunit reassociation was measured by fluorescence energy transfer using light chain modified with N-[1-pyrenyl] maleimide (fluorescence donor) and heavy chain modified with 7-diethylamino-3-[4'-maleimidophenyl]-4-methylcoumarin (fluorescence acceptor). Donor fluorescence quenching paralleled the formation of factor VIII clotting activity, and both effects were saturable with respect to added heavy chain. Based upon the degree of donor quenching, a distance of 20 A was calculated separating the two fluorophores. These results indicate a close spatial relationship between the A2 domain of heavy chain and the A3 domain of light chain in the factor VIII heterodimer."
https://openalex.org/W1487132270,"Heparin has been shown recently to stimulate the activity of human tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA). To investigate this effect further, mutant proteins lacking various domains of t-PA were screened for the ability to be stimulated by heparin. Those mutants harboring either the finger domain or the 2nd kringle were found to have enhanced enzymatic activity in the presence of heparin. Only mutants containing these structures would bind to heparin-agarose beads; monoclonal antibodies directed against these domains blocked binding. The stimulatory effect of heparin was more pronounced in finger-containing mutants than kringle-2 proteins. Earlier results had localized the fibrin-binding domains to the same two structures. Unlike heparin, the 2nd kringle was shown to be more important than the finger for fibrin stimulation. Our results have implications for producing recombinant t-PA variants for use in thrombolytic therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1528840755,"Ca2+ is a strong regulator of the expression of a limited number of eukaryotic genes, including prolactin and c-fos. However, little is known about the cellular signal transduction pathways involved in the action of this ion on specific gene expression. The Ca2++-dependent enzyme protein kinase C has been implicated in other transcriptional pathways regulating the prolactin and c-fos genes. We therefore employed down-regulation of protein kinase C in rat pituitary cells to investigate whether this enzyme is involved in Ca2++ regulation of expression of either of these genes. Exposure of Ca2++-deprived GH3 cells to this ion in the presence of the Ca2++ channel modulator Bay K8644 yielded large increases in the mRNAs for both prolactin and c-fos. Incubation of cells with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) yielded a 7- to 15-fold decrease in the enzymatic activity of C kinase assayed in vitro, but little or no effect on Ca2++ stimulation of cellular levels of either mRNA. The latter observation was apparently not due simply to an inability of TPA to down-regulate the gene-regulatory activity of kinase C in intact GH3 cells, since this phorbol ester blocked the stimulation by platelet-derived growth factor of cellular levels of c-fos mRNA. TPA treatment also yielded no significant effect on the kinetics of the Ca2++-stimulated accumulation of either mRNA, implying that kinase C is not required at any stage of the Ca2++ induction of these two genes."
https://openalex.org/W1660651845,"A lysate of purified insulin secretory granules, which contains two types of proinsulin processing activity (type 1, Arg-Arg-directed and type II, Lys-Arg-directed (Davidson, H.W., Rhodes, C.J., and Hutton, J. C. (1988) Nature 333, 93-96), was found to process proalbumin by specific proteolytic cleavage of the COOH-terminal side of the Arg-2-Arg-1 sequence. The subcellular distribution of proalbumin processing activity in insulinoma tissue paralleled that for proinsulin conversion and occurred principally in a secretory granule fraction. Cleavage appeared to result from the Arg-Arg-directed type 1 proinsulin processing endo-peptidase. It was Ca2+-dependent (K0.5 activation = 1.0-1.5 mM Ca2+), unaffected by group-specific inhibitors of serine, cysteinyl, or aspartyl proteinases, and had an acidic pH optimum (5.5). Active-site inhibitor studies showed this activity had a preference for dibasic over monobasic amino acid sequences and indicated that the sequence of the dibasic site was an important determinant of the susceptibility of the substrate to cleavage. The activity did not process the proalbumin Christchurch mutant (Arg-2-Arg-1 to Arg-2-Gln-1). It was inhibited by the variant alpha 1-antitrypsin Pittsburgh (Met358 to Arg358; K0.5 = 100 nM) but not by other related proteins normally co-secreted with albumin from hepatocytes, namely alpha 1-antitrypsin M, alpha 2-macroglobulin, or antithrombin III. The insulin secretory granule proalbumin processing activity was indistinguishable from a proalbumin endopeptidase reported in rat liver membranes and similar to the yeast KEX-2 protease. These findings suggest that a highly conserved set of proprotein endopeptidases exists, which are specific for a dibasic sequence but broadly specific for proprotein substrates. Such enzymic activities appear to be active within both the constitutive and regulated pathways of secretion. Intraorganellar Ca2+ and pH appear to play a key role in regulating their activities."
https://openalex.org/W1570161479,"Abstract The peroxidase activity of prostaglandin (PGH) synthase catalyzes the reduction of PGG2 and other natural and synthetic hydroperoxides by reducing substrates. Sulfides serve as reductants by incorporating the oxo ligand from the ferryl-oxo complex which represents the higher oxidation state of the peroxidase (Compound I). A series of alkylaryl sulfides and substituted dihydrobenzo[b]thiophenes were synthesized to determine the electronic and steric requirements of PGH synthase for sulfide reducing substrates. Kinetic parameters were determined for most of the molecules by determining their ability to support reduction of 5-phenyl-4-pentenyl-1-hydroperoxide in the presence of PGH synthase purified from ram seminal vesicle microsomes. Electron-donating groups on the aryl moiety para to the sulfide enhanced reducing substrate activity (p = -0.8). As expected from previous results, the major oxidation product of p-methylthioanisole was the corresponding sulfoxide. The presence of a para-amino group increased binding to the enzyme and changed the reduction mechanism from oxygen transfer to electron transfer. The major oxidation product of p-(dimethylamino)thioanisole was identified as p-(methylamino)thioanisole; an equivalent amount of formaldehyde was produced. Increasing the size of the alkyl group attached to sulfur decreased the ability of the sulfide to act as a peroxidase reductant. The maximal turnover for reduction by p-methoxyphenylalkyl sulfides decreased 10-fold on substitution of isopropyl for ethyl. Chiral derivatives of benzo[b]thiophenes demonstrated differences in the ability of the two enantiomers to support reduction. Introduction of a carboxylic acid moiety anywhere in the molecule decreased the maximal turnover for reduction. Esterification of the carboxylate doubled the extent of reduction relative to the free acid. The results are used to develop models for the interaction of sulfides with Compound I of PGH synthase."
https://openalex.org/W2011969559,"The difference between the 14CO2 outputs from [1-14C]glucose and [6-14C]glucose has frequently been used as a measure of activity in the hexose monophosphate shunt without considering the exact significance of this diffeence. Assuming only 1) that all C-1 of glucose is released to CO2 on entry to the shunt and 2) that the shunt provides the only mechanism for increasing C-1 of glucose over C-6 of glucose in CO2, it is very simply shown that the flux from glucose to the shunt is not less than the difference between the 14CO2 outputs at any time after adding labeled glucose nor more than the steady-state output of 14CO2 from [1-14C]glucose. Moreover, absence of a 14CO2 difference does not prove that the shunt is absent or inactive. The value for the minimum flux rate can be maximized by following the time course of the C-1 – C-6 difference in 14CO2 during the transient phase before isotopic equilibration is complete, but useful values can be obtained when the time course is not available. The above relationships are applicable to gluconeogenic as well as non-gluconeogenic tissues. Applications of these relationships to peripheral ganglia from chicken embryos, in which the 14CO2 difference passes through a maximum during incubation, show that 27–37% of the glucose taken up enters the pentose cycle in sympathetic ganglia from 10-day-old embryos, while 17–36% enters the cycle in 15-day-old dorsal root ganglia."
https://openalex.org/W1526097803,"Abstract For the purpose of assessing in vivo the importance of 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase (EC 1.3.1.34) in the beta-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids, reductase mutants of Escherichia coli were isolated by selecting cells that were able to grow on oleate but not on petroselinic acid (6-cis-octadecenoic acid). One mutant (fadH) exhibited 12% of the 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase activity present in the parental strain with other beta-oxidation enzymes being essentially unaffected. Antireductase antibodies were used to show that the mutant contains a fadH gene product at a level similar to that observed in the parental strain. Thus, the mutation seems to have resulted in the synthesis of a fadH gene product with lower specific activity. The mutation was mapped in the 71-75-min region of the E. coli chromosome where no other gene for beta-oxidation enzymes has so far been located. Complementation of the mutation by F'141, which carries the 67-75.5-min region of the E. coli genome, resulted in an increase in the 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase activity to 80% of the level found in the parental strain. Measurements of respiration with petroselinic acid as the substrate showed rates to be linearly dependent on the 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase activity up to levels found in wild-type E. coli. 2,4-Dienoyl-CoA reductase, like other enzymes of beta-oxidation, was induced when E. coli was grown on a long chain fatty acid as the sole carbon source. It is concluded that 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase is required in vivo for the beta-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids with double bonds extending from even-numbered carbon atoms."
https://openalex.org/W1507215013,"Abstract N-Myristoyl and non-myristoyl peptides corresponding to the N terminus of p60src were used to examine whether N-myristoylation facilitates the binding of p60src to specific protein sites at the plasma membrane. We discovered high affinity protein acceptor sites (Kd = 2.7 nM) to a 15-amino acid N-myristoylated N-terminal p60src peptide in red cell membrane vesicles. Binding was not competed by the non-myristoylated analog of the peptide nor by shorter N-myristoyl src peptides and peptides homologous to the N terminus of other N-myristoylated proteins. Binding was not evident after treatment of vesicles with proteolytic enzymes. Raising the salt concentration of the buffer to 50 mM NaCl caused an apparent inhibition of binding. However, no significant effect of salt was observed on the off-rate of bound ligand under these conditions. The results indicate the existence of N-myristoyl-dependent p60src protein acceptor sites at or near the plasma membrane/skeleton interface of red cells which could be responsible for the localization of p60src to this region and may represent new regulatory components for p60src-mediated tyrosine kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1607657592,"Abstract Studies in bovine and rat brain membranes have suggested that calmodulin can potentiate neurotransmitter- and GTP-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities. To examine whether calmodulin and the stimulatory G-protein, Gs, are potentiative at a calmodulin-sensitive adenylate cyclase, Gs was purified from rabbit liver and reconstituted with a partially purified calmodulin-sensitive adenylate cyclase from bovine brain. Activated Gs (G*s) stimulated basal adenylate cyclase activity and enhanced the stimulation by calmodulin. The potentiation of the calmodulin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was dose-dependent with respect to G*s concentration. At the highest concentration of G*s tested (3 nM), a 2-fold enhancement of the calmodulin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was observed at all concentrations of calmodulin. The synergistic activation of adenylate cyclase by calmodulin and Gs was dependent on the presence of Ca2+ and occurred at physiologically relevant Ca2+ concentrations. The potentiation was not observed when either a nonactivated Gs or a mixture of activated Gi/Go was used. G*s was not able to stimulate or potentiate a calmodulin-stimulated adenylate cyclase purified from membranes pretreated with the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, guanyl-5'-yl beta,gamma-imidodiphosphate. Photochemical cross-linking of 125I-calmodulin-diazopyruvamide to proteins having an Mr corresponding to the known Mr of adenylate cyclase was not enhanced by G*s. The results demonstrate that the guanyl nucleotide-dependent enhancement of calmodulin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity is mediated by G*s and suggest that G*s modulates the enzymatic turnover of the calmodulin-stimulated activity."
https://openalex.org/W1621742514,"A murine fibroblast cell line transfected with human insulin receptor cDNA, NIH 3T3 HIR3.5, was observed to display insulin-induced down-regulation of insulin-binding activity in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Maximal inhibition of insulin-binding activity (54%) occurred within 16 h of exposure to 100 nM insulin in vivo, where in vivo refers to intact cells in tissue culture. The decrease in cellular insulin-binding activity was the consequence of a decrease in the number of cell-associated insulin receptors as determined by Scatchard analysis of insulin binding, 125I-insulin affinity cross-linking, and Western blotting of the insulin receptor beta subunit. Acute insulin treatment in vivo (1-60 min) resulted in the activation of the insulin receptor protein tyrosine kinase as determined by in vitro phosphorylation of glutamic acid:tyrosine (4:1), where in vitro refers to broken cell preparations. This acute in vivo insulin activation of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase resulted in a greater stimulation (1.4-1.9-fold) of tyrosine kinase activity in the glutamic acid:tyrosine (4:1) assay than the maximal stimulation produced by insulin treatment in vitro. In contrast, long term (24 h) insulin treatment in vivo resulted in a 50-70% decrease in intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptors compared with that of acutely activated (1 min) insulin receptors. Under these conditions, the insulin receptor protein kinase activity remained insulin independent in the in vitro substrate kinase assay. Surprisingly, the insulin-independent activated (1 min in vivo insulin-treated) and uncoupled (24 h in vivo insulin-treated) insulin receptors displayed similar stoichiometries of 32P incorporation into the beta subunit by in vitro autophosphorylation when compared with the control insulin receptors, ranging from 1.5 to 1.8 mol of phosphate incorporated/mol of insulin receptor. Phosphoamino acid analysis demonstrated that the phosphoserine/phosphothreonine content of in vivo 32P-labeled insulin receptors increased markedly within a 1-h exposure to insulin in vivo, whereas insulin-induced receptor desensitization was not apparent until 10-24 h after exposure to insulin. These data suggest that insulin treatment in vivo results initially in the activation of the insulin receptor kinase followed by a subsequent uncoupling of protein kinase activity. This insulin-induced desensitization of the insulin receptor kinase does not correlate with the extent of beta subunit serine/threonine phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2132038479,"Previous work has described small molecular weight neutral polysaccharides from isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa that appear to be associated with the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and distributed across serologic barriers defined by antibody to the O side chain. We have isolated and characterized another of these structures obtained from culture supernatants of an immunotype 3 strain of P. aeruginosa. The isolated neutral polysaccharide has a tetrasaccharide repeat unit: (formula; see text) where Rha is rhamnose. The structure was determined by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy including nuclear Overhauser enhancement experiments, acid hydrolysis, methylation analysis, Smith degradation, and optical rotation determinations. Polyclonal antibodies raised to intact and alkali-treated (0.1 N NaOH, 56 degrees C, 2 h) LPS from the seven Fisher immunotype strains of P. aeruginosa bound well to the neutral polysaccharide. Antibodies affinity purified from these sera using immobilized neutral polysaccharide as well as a neutral polysaccharide-specific monoclonal antibody, E87, reacted with an antigenically similar structure found among many isolates of different LPS serotypes in a colony blot and with LPS from the seven Fisher immunotypes in an immunoblot. In an immunoblot assay, the neutral polysaccharide inhibited binding of the monoclonal antibody, E87, to material present in LPS preparations from a variety of serotypes. This structure may represent another P. aeruginosa neutral polysaccharide variant found associated with the LPS."
https://openalex.org/W1577034263,"The ability of aspirin to acetylate PGH synthase was determined by reacting [3H-acetyl]-aspirin with purified enzyme followed by high pressure liquid chromatography analysis of the protein components of the reaction mixture. Heme-reconstituted enzyme incorporated approximately one acetyl group per 70-kDa subunit, whereas apoprotein incorporated 0.1 acetyl group per subunit. The ability of the heme prosthetic group to enhance acetylation of the protein was correlated with its ability to protect the Arg253-Gly254 peptide bond from cleavage by trypsin. Thus, heme-induced alteration of protein conformation may contribute to the enhanced labeling of Ser506 by aspirin. The present results indicate that irreversible inactivation of prostaglandin H synthase by aspirin occurs only when the heme prosthetic group is bound to the protein. Considering its short in vivo half-life, it is likely that aspirin inactivates only the steady-state fraction of PGH synthase in a cell that is active but not newly synthesized apoprotein. This may contribute to the differential kinetics of inactivation and recovery of PGH synthase activity in platelets and vascular endothelial cells after administration of low dose aspirin as a prophylactic agent against cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W1597349566,"The ADP-ribosyl moiety of NAD was transferred to proteins with Mr values of 22,000 and 25,000 when bovine brain cytosol was incubated with a botulinum ADP-ribosyltransferase C3 (BT-C3) which was purified from the culture medium of a type C strain of Clostridium botulinum. Any protein fraction eluted from a chromatographic column to which the cytosol had been applied, however, was not significantly ADP-ribosylated by BT-C3, unless the reaction mixture was further supplemented with a small amount of the cytosol. Thus, substrate protein(s) could be partially purified based on their ability to be ADP-ribosylated by BT-C3 in the presence of the cytoplasmic activator(s). The rate of ADP-ribosylation of the substrates was extremely low by itself but was increased enormously and progressively when increasing amounts of cytosol were added, affording a reliable means for assay of the activator contained therein. The activator was separated from the substrate proteins and partially purified from the cytosol by sequential chromatography steps with an anion exchanger and a gel filtration column. The activity of the partially purified activator was heat-labile and protease-sensitive, suggesting that the activator was a protein or had a protein component necessary for activity. The action of the activator protein(s) was specific for BT-C3-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation; cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of GTP-binding protein (Gs) was not supported by this activator. Thus, this is the first report to show that botulinum ADP-ribosyltransferase-catalyzed reaction can proceed significantly only in the presence of other protein factor(s), just as has been observed with an ADP-ribosylation factor required for cholera toxin-induced similar reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1636206934,"This report demonstrates the effect of primary alcohols on the kinetic properties of guinea pig liver cytosolic beta-glucosidase. Lineweaver-Burk analyses of the kinetic data revealed a biphasic response; at low concentrations the alcohols increased the Vmax 5--7-fold while at higher concentrations they caused a purely competitive type of inhibition. For example, with n-butyl alcohol, increasing the alcohol's concentration in the assay medium from 0 to 0.14 M (0-1% (v/v)) resulted in a progressive increase in Vmax to a value 7-fold above the basal level without affecting the Km. However, between 0.14 and 0.54 M (1 and 4% (v/v)) n-butyl alcohol, the Km for 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside increased significantly from 0.14 to 0.93 mM. In contrast to n-butyl alcohol or isobutyl alcohol, which are potent activators, structurally related compounds like sec-butyl alcohol, tert-butyl alcohol, butylurea, and butanesulfonic acid did not stimulate the activity of the cytosolic beta-glucosidase. In the concentration range where activation was observed, conventional secondary replots of 1/delta slope versus 1/[alcohol] yielded perfect straight lines, demonstrating that binding of a single molecule of alcohol to the beta-glucosidase was responsible for the initial phase of activation. Furthermore, the glycohydrolase displayed a propensity to bind the longer chain alcohols, as reflected by the KA (binding constant) values of 555, 146, 34.1, and 7.47 mM for ethanol, n-propyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, 1-pentanol, respectively. This phenomenon of nonessential activation by alcohols has led us to speculate on the presence of a physiologic activator for the beta-glucosidase in mammalian tissues which contain this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1553811448,"LY177507 is representative of a series of phenacyl imidazolium compounds that cause marked lowering of blood glucose levels in animal models of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. In studies conducted with isolated rat hepatocytes, LY177507 inhibited net glucose production from a variety of substrates, inhibited glycolysis from exogenous glucose and endogenous glycogen, inhibited glycogenolysis, and stimulated glycogenesis. These effects of LY177507 appear to be the consequence of activation of glycogen synthase and inactivation of glycogen phosphorylase. In vivo studies with normal fed rats demonstrated a decrease in blood glucose, an increase in hepatic glycogen stores, and an inactivation of glycogen phosphorylase. Phenacyl imidazolium compounds appear to lower blood glucose levels and affect hepatic carbohydrate metabolism by a mechanism unlike other known hypoglycemic compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1597172007,"Abstract A cDNA encoding a previously unknown G protein alpha-subunit lacking the site for pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation was recently cloned and its putative protein product named Gz (Fong, H.

Sci. U. S. A. 85, 5384-5388). A synthetic peptide corresponding to the deduced carboxyl-terminal decapeptide of this putative protein (alpha z) has been synthesized and used to prepare a polyclonal rabbit antiserum directed against the protein. The specificity and cross-reactivity of this antiserum was assessed using bacterially expressed recombinant G protein alpha-subunit fusion proteins (r alpha). The crude antiserum strongly recognizes r alpha z in immunoblots. Pretreatment of antiserum with antigen peptide greatly reduces the interaction of the antiserum with r alpha z. Affinity purified antiserum strongly recognizes expressed r alpha z, does not recognize r alpha s1, r alpha s1, r alpha o, or r alpha i3, and very weakly interacts with r alpha i1 and r alpha i2. In contrast, the alpha-subunits of purified bovine brain Gi1 and human erythrocyte Gi2 and Gi3 did not react with the alpha z-antiserum. Partially purified mixtures of human erythrocyte G proteins contain a 41-kDa protein that reacts specifically in immunoblots with both crude and affinity purified alpha z-specific antiserum. Quantitative immunoblotting using r alpha z as a standard indicates that there is 60-100 ng of alpha z/micrograms of 40/41-kDa alpha-subunit protein in partially purified human erythrocyte G protein preparations. We conclude that we have identified the alpha z gene product as a 41-kDa trace protein in human erythrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1522311837,"The activity of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) is stimulated by heparin. Heparin binds tightly to t-PA, u-PA, and plasminogen and decreases the usual stimulatory effect of fibrin on t-PA activity. In the present study we have found that low molecular weight heparin (LMW-heparin) preparations obtained by nitrous acid depolymerization or heparinase treatment of standard heparin have different properties with respect to their interaction with the fibrinolytic system. LMW-heparin prepared by either method does not stimulate plasmin formation by t-PA. However, these preparations of heparin still efficiently accelerate the inhibition of thrombin by antithrombin III. Binding data show that LMW-heparin does not bind t-PA and Glu-plasminogen and only binds very weakly to Lys-plasminogen. These results illustrate that it is possible to selectively destroy the fibrinolytic stimulating properties of heparin while leaving the classical anticoagulant characteristics intact."

https://openalex.org/W1529794526,"ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are 19-21-kDa proteins purified from bovine brain that bind guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP). They exhibit GTP-dependent activity as activators of cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of the alpha-subunit of the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding protein of the adenylyl cyclase system (Gs alpha). ARF, which interacts directly with the catalytic subunit of cholera toxin, has no known physiologic role. Intracellular microinjection of ARF was employed to investigate the effect of ARF on progesterone- and insulin-stimulated maturation of Xenopus oocytes. Maturation was inhibited by injection of ARF 3-8 h before exposure of oocytes to progesterone or insulin. ARF inhibition was dependent on progesterone concentration but not on insulin concentration. Inhibition was enhanced by concomitant injection of GTP and to a greater extent by guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) which, in the absence of ARF, inhibited somewhat at early time points. The demonstration of this effect of ARF on both progesterone- and insulin-stimulated oocyte maturation may provide a clue to the physiologic role of this guanine nucleotide-binding protein."

A direct biochemical comparison has been made between ETA and a nonenzymatically active mutant toxin (CRM 66) using highly purified preparations of each protein. The loss of ADP-ribosyltransferase activity and subsequent cytotoxicity have been correlated with the presence of a tyrosine residue in place of a histidine at position 426 in CRM 66. In the native conformation, CRM 66 demonstrated a limited ability (by a factor or at least 100,000) to modify EF-2 covalently and lacked in vitro and in vivo cytotoxicity, yet CRM 66 appeared to be normal with respect to NAD+ binding. Upon activation with urea and dithiothreitol, CRM 66 lost ADP-ribosyltransferase activity entirely yet CRM 66 retained the ability to bind NAD+. Replacement of Tyr-426 with histidine in CRM 66 completely restored cytotoxicity and ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. These results support previous findings from this laboratory (Wozniak, D. J., Hsu, L.-Y., and Galloway, D. R. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.
