In order that an assessment may be made of the radiation dosage arising from the use of this isotope, the γ-ray output and mean β-ray energy have been measured. Rubidium-86 decays with the omission of a 1.80 MeV. β-ray or by a 0.72 MeV. β-ray followed by a 1.08 MeV. γ-ray2. The results reported here indicate that the γ-ray occurs in about 8.4 per cent of disintegrations."

In order to know the final result of this digestion, it is necessary to know the composition of the material leaving the fore-stomachs and the rate of flow at the omaso-abomasal orifice. To study this problem a special cannula has been devised (Fig. 1). It consists of a main tube, B, of ebonite (2 cm. internal diameter), into which runs a smaller one, C (1 cm. internal diameter). The main tube is 10 cm. long and is connected at one end with a funnel, A, of which the diameter of the top is 6 cm. and its height 4 cm. The side tube, C, is screwed perpendicularly on to the middle of the main tube. It is threaded on the outside over its whole length, so that an ebonite ring (D) of 3 cm. diameter can be screwed on to it, making it mobile over the whole length of the tube."

The hæmatological findings, and the comparison of survival-times with those obtained in animals which received higher doses1, are noteworthy."
