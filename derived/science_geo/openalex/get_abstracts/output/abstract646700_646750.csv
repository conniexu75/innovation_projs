https://openalex.org/W3004111719,"Increasing evidence supports the importance of the breast milk microbiome in seeding the infant gut. However, the origin of bacteria in milk and the process of milk microbe-mediated seeding of infant intestine need further elucidation. Presumed sources of bacteria in milk include locations of mother-infant and mother-environment interactions. We investigate the role of mother-infant interaction on breast milk microbes. Shotgun metagenomics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing identified milk microbes of mother-infant pairs in breastfed infants and in infants that have never latched. Although breast milk has low overall biomass, milk microbes play an important role in seeding the infant gut. Breast milk bacteria were largely comprised of Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Acinetobacter, and Enterobacter primarily derived from maternal areolar skin and infant oral sites in breastfeeding pairs. This suggests that the process of breastfeeding is a potentially important mechanism for propagation of breast milk microbes through retrograde flux via infant oral and areolar skin contact. In one infant delivered via Caesarian section, a distinct strain of Bifidobacteria breve was identified in maternal rectum, breast milk and the infant’s stool potentially suggesting direct transmission. This may support the existence of microbial translocation of this anaerobic bacteria via the enteromammary pathway in humans, where maternal bacteria translocate across the maternal gut and are transferred to the mammary glands. Modulating sources of human milk microbiome seeding potentially imply opportunities to ultimately influence the development of the infant microbiome and health."
https://openalex.org/W3004131096,"Escherichia coli (E. coli) from the B2 phylogenetic group is implicated in colorectal cancer (CRC) as it possesses a genomic island, termed polyketide synthetase (pks), which codes for the synthesis of colibactin, a genotoxin that induces DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, mutations and chromosomal instability in eukaryotic cells. The aim of this study was to detect and compare the prevalence of E. coli expressing pks (pks+ E. coli) in CRC patients and healthy controls followed by investigating the virulence triggered by pks+ E. coli using an in-vitro model. Mucosal colon tissues were collected and processed to determine the presence of pks+ E. coli. Thereafter, primary colon epithelial (PCE) and colorectal carcinoma (HCT116) cell lines were used to detect cytopathic response to the isolated pks+ E. coli strains. Our results showed 16.7% and 4.3% of CRC and healthy controls, respectively were pks+ E. coli. Further, PCE displayed syncytia and cell swelling and HCT116 cells, megalocytosis, in response to treatment with the isolated pks+ E. coli strains. In conclusion, pks+ E. coli was more often isolated from tissue of CRC patients compared to healthy individuals, and our in-vitro assays suggest these isolated strains may be involved in the initiation and development of CRC."
https://openalex.org/W3003590592,"To examine whether the relationship between Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and health outcomes is similar across states and persists net of ACEs associations with smoking, heavy drinking, and obesity.We use data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System for 14 states. Logistic regressions yield estimates of the direct associations of ACEs exposure with health outcomes net of health risk factors, and indirect ACEs-health associations via health risk factors. Models were estimated for California (N = 22,475) and pooled data from 13 states (N = 110,076), and also separately by state.Exposure to ACEs is associated with significantly higher odds of smoking, heavy drinking, and obesity. Net of these health risk factors, there was a significant and graded relationship in California and the pooled 13-state data between greater ACEs exposure and odds of depression, asthma, COPD, arthritis, and cardiovascular disease. Four or more ACEs were less consistently associated across states with cancer and diabetes and a dose-response relationship was also not present. There was a wide range across individual states in the percentage change in health outcomes predicted for exposure to 4+ ACEs. ACEs-related smoking, heavy drinking, and obesity explain a large and significant proportion of 4+ ACEs associations with COPD and cardiovascular disease, however some effect, absent of risk behavior, remained.ACE's associations with most of the health conditions persist independent of behavioral pathways but only asthma, arthritis, COPD, cardiovascular disease, and depression consistently exhibit a dose-response relationship. Our results suggest that attention to child maltreatment and household dysfunction, mental health treatment, substance abuse prevention and promotion of physical activity and healthy weight outcomes might mitigate some adverse health consequences of ACEs. Differences across states in the pattern of ACEs-health associations may also indicate fruitful areas for prevention."
https://openalex.org/W3004315278,"The ever-increasing vehicle counts have resulted in a significant increase in air pollution impacting human and natural ecosystems including trees, and physical properties. Roadside plantations often act as a first defense line against the vehicular emissions to mitigate the impacts of pollutants. However, they are themselves vulnerable to these pollutants with varying levels of tolerance capacity. This demands a scientific investigation to assess the role of roadside plantation for better management and planning for urban sprawl where selected trees could be grown to mitigate the impacts of harmful pollutants. The present study assesses the impacts of vehicular emissions on the adaptation and mitigation potential of two important roadside tree species i.e. Grevillea robusta and Mangifera indica planted along roadsides in the capital city of Uttarakhand. Uttarakhand is one of the Indian Western Himalayan State and its capital city is situated on the foothills of Himalaya. The adaptation and mitigation potential were evaluated by studying the response of pollutants on the functional traits which drive the physiology of the trees. The CO2 assimilation rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency (WUE), air pollution tolerance index (APTI), copper and proline accumulation, dust removal efficiency (DRE), leaf thickness and cooling created by plantation were studied to evaluate the response of trees exposed to roadside traffics. To compare the influence of pollutants, traits of trees grown in a control site with few or absence of vehicular movement were compared with the roadside trees. The control site represented part of a reserve forest where human interference is controlled and human-induced activities are prohibited. The vehicular frequency was found to modulate tree characteristics. The tree characteristics representing WUE, APTI, proline and copper accumulation, leaf thickness, cooling impact, and DRE were enhanced significantly, while the decreased CO2 assimilation rate was observed near roadside trees compared to the control site. We found both of the species to perform well to be used as one of the potential species for roadside and urban greening. However, there is a need to assess the potential of other species in reference to the present study."
https://openalex.org/W3003781155,"Patients with multimorbidity and complex health care needs are usually vulnerable elders with several concomitant advanced chronic diseases. Our research aim was to evaluate differences in patterns of multimorbidity by gender in this population and their possible prognostic implications, measured as in-hospital mortality, 1-month readmissions, and 1-year mortality. We focused on a cohort of elderly patients with well-established multimorbidity criteria admitted to a specific unit for chronic complex-care patients. Multimorbidity criteria, the Charlson, PROFUND and Barthel indexes, and the Pfeiffer test were collected prospectively during their stays. A total of 843 patients (49.2% men) were included, with a median age of 84 [interquartile range (IQR) 79-89] years. The women were older, with greater functional dependence [Barthel index: 40 (IQR:10-65) vs. 60 (IQR: 25-90)], showed more cognitive deterioration [Pfeiffer test: 5 (IQR:1-9) vs. 1 (0-6)], and had worse scores on the PROFUND index [15 (IQR:9-18) vs. 11.5 (IQR: 6-15)], all p <0.0001, while men had greater comorbidity measured with the Charlson index [5 (IQR: 3-7) vs. 4 (IQR: 3-6); p = 0.002]. In the multimorbidity criteria scale, heart failure, autoimmune diseases, dementia, and osteoarticular diseases were more frequent in women, while ischemic heart disease, chronic respiratory diseases, and neoplasms predominated in men. In the analysis of grouped patterns, neurological and osteoarticular diseases were more frequent in females, while respiratory and cancer predominated in males. We did not find gender differences for in-hospital mortality, 1-month readmissions, or 1-year mortality. In the multivariate analysis age, the Charlson, Barthel and PROFUND indexes, along with previous admissions, were independent predictors of 1-year mortality, while gender was non-significant. The Charlson and PROFUND indexes predicted mortality during follow-up more accurately in men than in women (AUC 0.70 vs. 0.57 and 0.74 vs. 0.62, respectively), with both p<0.001. In conclusion, our study shows differing patterns of multimorbidity by gender, with greater functional impairment in women and more comorbidity in men, although without differences in the prognosis. Moreover, some of these prognostic indicators had differing accuracy for the genders in predicting mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3003489635,"Endogenous FLOWERING LOCUS T homolog MeFT1 was transgenically overexpressed under control of a strong constitutive promoter in cassava cultivar 60444 to determine its role in regulation of flowering and as a potential tool to accelerate cassava breeding. Early profuse flowering was recorded in-vitro in all ten transgenic plant lines recovered, causing eight lines to die within 21 days of culture. The two surviving transgenic plant lines flowered early and profusely commencing as soon as 14 days after establishment in soil in the greenhouse. Both transgenic lines sustained early flowering across the vegetative propagation cycle, with first flowering recorded 30–50 days after planting stakes compared to 90 days for non-transgenic controls. Transgenic plant lines completed five flowering cycles within 200 days in the greenhouse as opposed to twice flowering event in the controls. Constitutive overexpression of MeFT1 generated fully mature male and female flowers and produced a bushy phenotype due to significantly increased flowering-induced branching. Flower induction by MeFT1 overexpression was not graft-transmissible and negatively affected storage root development. Accelerated flowering in transgenic plants was associated with significantly increased mRNA levels of MeFT1 and the three floral meristem identity genes MeAP1, MeLFY and MeSOC1 in shoot apical tissues. These findings imply that MeFT1 encodes flower induction and triggers flowering by recruiting downstream floral meristem identity genes."
https://openalex.org/W3004222830,"The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a nanomachine capable of killing adjacent microbial cells in a contact-dependent manner. Due to limited studies, relatively little is known about the range of marine bacteria that are susceptible to T6SS attack. Here, 15 diverse marine bacterial isolates from the phyla Bacteroidetes and Ɣ-Proteobacteria were challenged against the marine bacterium and human pathogen, Vibrio cholerae, which has a well described T6SS. V. cholerae killed several of the tested Ɣ-Proteobacteria, including members of the orders Vibrionales, Alteromonadales, Oceanospirillales, and Pseudomonadales. In contrast, V. cholerae co-existed with multiple Bacteroidetes and Ɣ-Proteobacteria isolates, but was killed by Vibrio coralliilyticus. Follow-up experiments revealed that five V. coralliilyticus strains, including known coral and shellfish pathogens survived the T6SS challenge and killed V. cholerae. By using predicted protein comparisons and mutagenesis, we conclude that V. coralliilyticus protected itself in the challenge by using its own T6SS to kill V. cholerae. This study provides valuable insight into the resilience and susceptibility of marine bacteria to the V. cholerae T6SS, and provides the first evidence for a functional T6SS in V. coralliilyticus, both of which have implications for human and ocean health."
https://openalex.org/W3003258746,"This study reports complete plastome sequences for six species of Neotropical Cranichideae and focuses on identification of the most variable regions (hotspots) in this group of orchids. These structure of these six plastomes is relatively conserved, exhibiting lengths ranging between 142,599 to 154,562 bp with 36.7% GC on average and exhibiting typical quadripartite arrangement (LSC, SSC and two IRs). Variation detected in the LSC/IR and SSC/IR junctions is explained by the loss of ndhF and ycf1 length variation. For the two genera of epiphytic clade in Spiranthinae, almost whole sets of the ndh-gene family were missing. Eight mutation hotspots were identified based on nucleotide diversity, sequence variability and parsimony-informative sites. Three of them (rps16-trnQ, trnT-trnL, rpl32-trnL) seem to be universal hotspots in the family, and the other five (trnG-trnR, trnR-atpA, trnP-psaJ, rpl32-infA, and rps15-ycf1) are described for the first time as orchid molecular hotspots. These regions have much more variation than all those used previously in phylogenetics of the group and offer useful plastid markers for phylogenetic, barcoding and population genetic studies. The use of whole plastomes or exclusive no-gap matrices also positioned with high support the holomycotrophic Rhizanthella among Orchidoideae plastomes in model-based analyses, showing the utility of plastomes for phylogenetic placement of this unusual genus."
https://openalex.org/W3003919093,"Knowledge of population dynamics of threatened species in the wild is key to effective conservation actions. However, at present, there are many examples of endangered animals for which their current situation is unknown, and not just in remote areas and less developed countries. We have explored this topic by studying the paradigmatic case of the European wildcat (Felis silvestris silvestris), an endangered small carnivore whose status has been subjectively established on the basis of non-systematic approaches and opportunistic records. Little is known about its demographic situation, prompting the need for information to improve conservation measures. However, the secretive behaviour of felines along with its low density in natural conditions have prevented the gathering of sufficient data. We developed a field sampling strategy for one of the largest populations (Andalusia, South Spain, 87,268 km2), based on a logistically viable systematic non-intrusive survey by camera-trapping. This study offers the first large-scale estimation for any European wildcat population, based on analytical approaches applied on Species Distribution Models. A hierarchical approach based on a Maxent model for distribution estimation was used, along with Generalised Linear Models for density estimation from explicit spatial capture-recapture data. Our results show that the distribution range is smaller and more highly fragmented than previously assumed. The overall estimated density was very low (0.069 ±0.0019 wildcats/km2) and the protected areas network seems to be insufficient to cover a significant part of the population or a viable nucleus in demographic terms. Indeed, the most important areas remain unprotected. Our main recommendations are to improve the protected area network and/or vigilance programs in hunting estates, in addition to studying and improving connectivity between the main population patches."
https://openalex.org/W3003960478,"This ex vivo proof-of-concept study aimed to investigate the effect of nanosilver particles (AgNP) added to a conventional infiltrant resin (Icon) on external penetration into natural proximal enamel caries exceeding into dentin after internal tunnel preparation and internal infiltration. Carious lesions (ICDAS codes 2/3) of extracted human (pre-)molars revealing proximal caries radiographically exceeding into dentin (E2/D1 lesions) were preselected. Then, 48 of those specimens showing demineralized areas transcending the enamel-dentin border as assessed by means of near-infrared light transillumination (DIAGNOcam) were deproteinized (NaOCl, 5%). Using an internal tunnel approach, occlusal cavities central to the marginal ridge were prepared. Excavation of carious dentin, total etch procedure (H3PO4, 40%), and internal resin infiltration (FITC-labeled) followed, along with final restorations (flowable composite resin). Outer lesion surfaces were etched (HCl, 15%) prior to external infiltration (RITC-labeled). Group 1 (control; n = 24) used non-modified infiltrant, while an infiltrant/AgNP mixture (20 nm; 5.5 wt%) was used with experimental Group 2 (n = 24). Non-infiltrated pores of cut lesions were stained (Berberine), and specimens were analyzed using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Compared to the non-filled infiltrant, incorporation of AgNP had no effect on the resin's external penetration. Between the groups, no significant differences regarding internal or external infiltration could be detected, and non-infiltrated lesion areas did not differ significantly (p>0.109; t-test). The internal tunnel preparation in combination with both an internal resin infiltration and an additional external infiltration approach using a nanosilver-modified infiltrant resin leads to increased infiltrated lesion areas, thus occluding and adhesively stabilizing the porous volume of the demineralized enamel. While exerting antimicrobial effects by the nanosilver particles, this approach should have the potential as a viable treatment alternative for proximal lesions extending into dentin, thus avoiding the sacrifice of sound enamel, postponing the frequently inevitable restoration/re-restoration cycle of conventional proximal caries treatment, and improving dental health."
https://openalex.org/W3003656699,"Introduction Zimbabwe is scaling up HIV differentiated service delivery (DSD) to improve treatment outcomes and health system efficiencies. Shifting stable patients into less-intensive DSD models is a high priority in order to accommodate the large numbers of newly-diagnosed people living with HIV (PLHIV) needing treatment and to provide healthcare workers with the time and space needed to treat people with advanced HIV disease. DSD is also seen as a way to improve service quality and enhance retention in care. National guidelines support five differentiated antiretroviral treatment models (DART) for stable HIV-positive adults, but little is known about patient preferences, a critical element needed to guide DART scale-up and ensure person-centered care. We designed a mixed-methods study to explore treatment preferences of PLHIV in urban Zimbabwe. Methods The study was conducted in Harare, and included 35 health care worker (HCW) key informant interviews (KII); 8 focus group discussions (FGD) with 54 PLHIV; a discrete choice experiment (DCE) in which 500 adult DART-eligible PLHIV selected their preferences for health facility (HF) vs. community location, individual vs. group meetings, provider cadre and attitude, clinic operation times, visit frequency, visit duration and cost to patient; and a survey with the 500 DCE participants exploring DART knowledge and preferences. Results Patient preferences were consistent in the FGDs, DCE and survey. Participants strongly preferred respectful HCWs, HF-based services, individual DART models, and less costly services. Patients also preferred less frequent visits and shorter wait times. They were indifferent to variations in HCW cadre and distances from home to HF. These preferences were mostly homogenous, with only minor differences between male vs. female and older vs. younger patients. HCWs in the KII correctly characterized facility-based individual models as the one most favored by patients; HCWs also preferred this model, which they felt decongested HFs and reduced their workload. Conclusions DART-eligible PLHIV in Harare found it relatively easy to access HFs, and preferred attributes associated with facility-based individual models. Prioritizing these for scale-up in urban areas may be the most efficient way to sustain positive patient outcomes and increase health system performance."
https://openalex.org/W3003454058,"Background Limited data is available to describe clinical characteristics, long-term outcomes, healthcare resource use and the attributable costs of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) in Germany. We aimed to examine demographic and clinical characteristics as well as healthcare resource use and related costs. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study based on the InGef database in patients with IMD between 2009 and 2015. Cases were identified based on hospital main discharge diagnoses of IMD. Demographics, clinical characteristics, 30-day and 1-year mortality as well as IMD-related complications and sequelae in IMD cases were examined. In addition, short and long-term costs and healthcare resource use in IMD cases were analyzed and compared to an age- and sex-matched control group without IMD. Results The study population comprised 164 IMD cases between 2009 and 2015. The mean length of the IMD-related hospitalization was 13 days and 38% of all cases presented with meningitis only, 35% with sepsis only, 16% with both and 11% with other IMD. The 30-day and one-year mortality were 4.3% and 5.5%, respectively. Approximately 13% of IMD cases had documented IMD-related complications at hospital discharge and 24% suffered from sequelae during follow-up. The IMD-related hospitalization was associated with mean costs of € 9,620 (standard deviation: € 22,197). The difference of mean costs between IMD cases and matched non-IMD controls were € 267 in the first month and € 1,161 from one month to one year after discharged from IMD-related hospitalization. During the later follow-up period, the mean overall costs and costs associated with individual healthcare sectors were also higher for IMD cases without reaching statistical significance. Conclusions IMD resulted in severe complications and sequelae and was associated with extensive costs and increased healthcare resource use in Germany, especially in the first year after IMD diagnosis and due the IMD-related hospitalization."
https://openalex.org/W3003157701,"Introduction Pertussis is an important public health problem worldwide, especially in infants. An increase in the incidence in many countries occurred after 2010, including Brazil. In 2013, dTpa vaccine was introduced in the Brazil national immunization schedule of pregnant women. The objective of this study was to evaluate the national trends in the incidence of pertussis in Brazil in children under 1 year old, and the impact of the introduction of dTpa vaccine during pregnancy. Methods The incidence of hospitalizations and non-hospitalized confirmed cases of pertussis in neonates (< 1 month age) and young infants (1 month—< 1 year age) were analyzed, comparing the incidence in pre maternal vaccination (2011–2013) with the post-vaccination (2015–2017). We used non-respiratory hospitalizations as comparison, during the same period. A database of the Brazilian Ministry of Health (DATASUS) was used to analyze cases from 2007 to 2017 and the subsets of 2011–2013 and 2015–2017, after Pertussis resurgence. The vaccination data was accessed through the link of the Information System of the National Immunization Program (pni.datasus.gov.br). Results Between 2007 and 2017, 17,818 children under one year of age were hospitalized due to pertussis in Brazil. In the pre maternal vaccination period 2011–2013, the mean annual incidence of non-hospitalized confirmed cases of pertussis in children under 1 month was 722.2 / 100,000 and in the period of 2015–2017 the average was 377.3 / 100,000, representing a decrease of 47.7% [IRR 0.52 (0.46–0.59)]. At those periods of time, the average incidence per year for children of one month—< 1 year aged was 64.9 / 100,000 (2011–2013) and 29.3 / 100,000 (2015–2017) [IRR 0.45 (CI 0.29–0.69)]. Conclusion Vaccination of pregnant woman coincides with the reduction in the number of cases of pertussis in children under 1 month of age from 2015. Immunization of pregnant woman seems to have an important impact on the prevention of the disease in young infants who have not yet received their own pertussis vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W3004044516,"Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in de novo lipogenesis, which is increased in the livers of patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. GS-0976 (firsocostat), an inhibitor of isoforms ACC1 and ACC2, reduced hepatic steatosis and serum fibrosis biomarkers such as tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in a randomized controlled trial, although the impact of this improvement on fibrosis has not fully been evaluated in preclinical models. Here, we used Western diet-fed melanocortin 4 receptor-deficient mice that have similar phenotypes to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis patients including progressively developed hepatic steatosis as well as fibrosis. We evaluated the effects of ACC1/2 inhibition on hepatic fibrosis. After the confirmation of significant hepatic fibrosis with a 13-week pre-feeding, GS-0976 (4 and 16 mg/kg/day) treatment for 9 weeks lowered malonyl-CoA and triglyceride content in the liver and improved steatosis, histologically. Furthermore, GS-0976 reduced the histological area of hepatic fibrosis, hydroxyproline content, mRNA expression level of type I collagen in the liver, and plasma tissue metalloproteinase inhibitor 1, suggesting an improvement of hepatic fibrosis. The treatment with GS-0976 was also accompanied by reductions of plasma ALT and AST levels. These data demonstrate that improvement of hepatic lipid metabolism by ACC1/2 inhibition could be a new option to suppress fibrosis progression as well as to improve hepatic steatosis in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis."
https://openalex.org/W3003405505,"A common single nucleotide polymorphism in the ACTN3 gene might result in the complete deficiency of α-actinin-3 (i.e., XX genotype). It has been found that ACTN3 XX individuals have several traits related to lessened muscle performance. This study aimed to determine the influence, if any, of ACTN3 genotypes on injury incidence of marathoners during the year preceding to participating in a competitive marathon race. Using a cross-sectional experimental design, the type and conditions of sports injuries were documented for one year in a group of 139 marathoners. Injuries were recorded following a consensus statement on injuries in Athletics. Afterward, ACTN3 genotyping was performed, and injury epidemiology was compared among RR, RX, and XX genotypes. The distribution of the RR/RX/XX genotypes was 28.8/42.8/23.5%, respectively. A total of 67 injuries were recorded. The frequency of marathoners that reported any injury during the previous year was not different across the genotypes (55.0/38.8/40.6%, P = 0.241). Although the overall injury incidence was not different among genotypes (2.78/1.65/1.94 injuries/1000 h of running, P = 0.084), the likelihood of suffering an injury was higher in RR than in RX (OR = 1.93: 95%CI = 0.87–4.30), and higher than in XX (OR = 1.79: 0.70–4.58). There was no difference in the conditions, severity, body location, time of year, or leading cause of injury among genotypes. However, XX presented a higher frequency of sudden-onset injuries (P = 0.024), and the OR for muscle-type injuries was 2.0 (0.51–7.79) times higher compared to RR runners. Although XX marathoners did not have a higher overall incidence of injury, the OR in these runners for muscle-type injuries was superior to RR and RX runners. The likelihood of suffering a muscle injury, especially with a sudden-onset, was twice in XX than in RR endurance runners."
https://openalex.org/W3003647562,"Bacteria can acquire new genes by incorporating environmental DNA into their genomes, yet genome sizes stay relatively constant. In nature, gene acquisition is a rare event so it is difficult to observe. However, the Caulobacter crescentus CB2A genome contains 114 insertions of genetic material from the closely-related NA1000 strain, providing a unique opportunity to analyze the horizontal transfer of genetic material. Analyses of these insertions led to a new model that involves preferential recombination at non-homologous regions that are flanked by regions of homology and does not involve any mutational processes. The net result is the replacement of segments of the recipient genome instead of the simple addition of genetic material during horizontal gene transfer. Analyses of the genomes of closely related strains of other bacterial and archaea genera, suggested that horizontal gene transfer occurs preferentially in non-homologous regions in these organisms as well. Thus, it appears to be a general phenomenon that prokaryotic horizontal gene transfer occurs preferentially at sites where the incoming DNA contains a non-homologous region that is flanked by regions of homology. Therefore, gene replacement is a common phenomenon during horizontal gene transfer."
https://openalex.org/W3002516905,"Objectives The regulatory mechanisms affecting the modulation of the immune system accompanying the progressive effort to exhaustion, particularly associated with T cells, are not fully understood. We analysed the impact of two progressive effort protocols on T helper (Th) cell distribution and selected cytokines. Methods Sixty-two male soccer players with a median age of 17 (16–29) years performed different protocols for progressive exercise until exhaustion: YO-YO (YYRL1) and Beep. Blood samples for all analyses were taken three times: at baseline, post-effort, and in recovery. Results The percentage of Th1 cells increased post-effort and in recovery. The post-effort percentage of Th1 cells was higher in the Beep group compared to the YYRL1 group. Significant post-effort increase in Th17 cells was observed in both groups. The post-effort percentage of regulatory T cells (Treg) increased in the Beep group. An increased post-effort concentration of IL-2, IL-6, IL-8 and IFN-γ in both groups was observed. Post-effort TNF-α and IL-10 levels were higher than baseline in the YYRL1 group, while the post-effort IL-17A concentration was lower than baseline only in the Beep group. The recovery IL-2, IL-4, TNF-α and IFN-γ levels were higher than baseline in the YYRL1 group. The recovery IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α and IFN-γ values were higher than baseline in the Beep group. Conclusion The molecular patterns related to cytokine secretion are not the same between different protocols for progressive effort. It seems that Treg cells are probably the key cells responsible for silencing the inflammation and enhancing anti-inflammatory pathways."
https://openalex.org/W3003473063,"Mosquito-borne diseases have become a significant health issue in many regions around the world. For tropical countries, diseases such as Dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya, became epidemic in the last decades. Health surveillance reports during this period were crucial in providing scientific-based information to guide decision making and resources allocation to control outbreaks. In this work, we perform data analysis of the last Chikungunya epidemics in the city of Rio de Janeiro by applying a compartmental mathematical model. Sensitivity analyses were performed in order to describe the contribution of each parameter to the outbreak incidence. We estimate the “basic reproduction number” for those outbreaks and predict the potential epidemic outbreak of the Mayaro virus. We also simulated several scenarios with different public interventions to decrease the number of infected people. Such scenarios should provide insights about possible strategies to control future outbreaks."

https://openalex.org/W3003758394,"The growing occurrence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella enterica in poultry has been reported with public health concern worldwide. We reported, recently, the occurrence of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovars carrying clinically relevant resistance genes in dairy cattle farms in the Wakiso District, Uganda, highlighting an urgent need to monitor food-producing animal environments. Here, we present the prevalence, antimicrobial resistance, and sequence type of 51 Salmonella isolates recovered from 379 environmental samples from chicken farms in Uganda. Among the Salmonella isolates, 32/51 (62.7%) were resistant to at least one antimicrobial, and 10/51 (19.6%) displayed multiple drug resistance. Through PCR, five replicon plasmids were identified among chicken Salmonella isolates including IncFIIS 17/51 (33.3%), IncI1α 12/51 (23.5%), IncP 8/51 (15.7%), IncX1 8/51 (15.7%), and IncX2 1/51 (2.0%). In addition, we identified two additional replicons through WGS (Whole Genome Sequencing; ColpVC and IncFIB). A significant seasonal difference between chicken sampling periods was observed (p = 0.0017). We conclude that MDR Salmonella highlights the risks posed to animals and humans. Implementing a robust, integrated surveillance system will aid in monitoring MDR zoonotic threats."
https://openalex.org/W3001054578,"In the study of the human connectome, the vertices and the edges of the network of the human brain are analyzed: the vertices of the graphs are the anatomically identified gray matter areas of the subjects; this set is exactly the same for all the subjects. The edges of the graphs correspond to the axonal fibers, connecting these areas. In the biological applications of graph theory, it happens very rarely that scientists examine numerous large graphs on the very same, labeled vertex set. Exactly this is the case in the study of the connectomes. Because of the particularity of these sets of graphs, novel, robust methods need to be developed for their analysis. Here we introduce the new method of the Frequent Network Neighborhood Mapping for the connectome, which serves as a robust identification of the neighborhoods of given vertices of special interest in the graph. We apply the novel method for mapping the neighborhoods of the human hippocampus and discover strong statistical asymmetries between the connectomes of the sexes, computed from the Human Connectome Project. We analyze 413 braingraphs, each with 463 nodes. We show that the hippocampi of men have much more significantly frequent neighbor sets than women; therefore, in a sense, the connections of the hippocampi are more regularly distributed in men and more varied in women. Our results are in contrast to the volumetric studies of the human hippocampus, where it was shown that the relative volume of the hippocampus is the same in men and women."

Parameters, including the proportion of observable abnormal tissue membrane and Schlemm's canal, the largest cross-sectional area (CSA) of Schlemm's canal (SC), SC meridional diameter, trabecular-iris angle (TIA), trabecular meshwork (TM) thickness, iris thickness, ciliary process length, and corneal limbus thickness were compared between the two groups and their relationship with age was explored in PCG eyes.Abnormal tissue membrane was detected in 27.5% of PCG eyes and none in unaffected eyes. SC was observed in 73.1% of PGC eyes compared to 100% in unaffected eyes (P<0.001). The largest CSA of SC, SC meridional diameter, iris thickness, and corneal limbus thickness were all significantly smaller in PCG eyes compared to unaffected eyes (all P<0.05). TIA and ciliary process length in unaffected eyes were smaller than PCG eyes (both P<0.05). The largest CSA of SC, TM thickness, iris thickness, and ciliary process length were all significantly correlated to age in PCG eyes (P<0.05).The anatomical information evaluated by high-frequency UBM may provide glaucoma specialists a useful tool to aid in understanding the dysgenesis and changes with age of anterior chamber angle in PCG."
https://openalex.org/W3001551327,"Objectives To estimate the adult health burden and costs in California during 2013 associated with adults’ prior Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs). Methods We analyzed five ACEs-linked conditions (asthma, arthritis, COPD, depression, and cardiovascular disease) and three health risk factors (lifetime smoking, heavy drinking, and obesity). We estimated ACEs-associated fractions of disease risk for people aged 18+ for these conditions by ACEs exposure using inputs from a companion study of California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data for 2008–2009, 2011, and 2013. We combined these estimates with published estimates of personal healthcare spending and Disability-Adjusted-Life-Years (DALYs) in the United States by condition during 2013. DALYs captured both the years of healthy life lost to disability and the years of life lost to deaths during 2013. We applied a published estimate of cost per DALY. Results Among adults in California, 61% reported ACEs. Those ACEs were associated with $10.5 billion in excess personal healthcare spending during 2013, and 434,000 DALYs valued at approximately $102 billion dollars. During 2013, the estimated health burden per exposed adult included $589 in personal healthcare expenses and 0.0224 DALYs valued at $5,769. Conclusions Estimates of the costs of childhood adversity are far greater than previously understood and provide a fiscal rationale for prevention efforts."
https://openalex.org/W3003537306,"The ability to modify behavior based on prior experience is essential to an animal’s survival. For example, animals may become attracted to a previously neutral odor or reject a previously appetitive food source based on previous encounters. In Drosophila, the mushroom bodies (MBs) are critical for olfactory associative learning and conditioned taste aversion, but how the output of the MBs affects specific behavioral responses is unresolved. In conditioned taste aversion, Drosophila shows a specific behavioral change upon learning: proboscis extension to sugar is reduced after a sugar stimulus is paired with an aversive stimulus. While studies have identified MB output neurons (MBONs) that drive approach or avoidance behavior, whether the same MBONs impact innate proboscis extension behavior is unknown. Here, we tested the role of MB pathways in altering proboscis extension and identified MBONs that synapse onto multiple MB compartments that upon activation significantly decreased proboscis extension to sugar. Activating several of these lines also decreased sugar consumption, revealing that these MBONs have a general role in modifying feeding behavior beyond proboscis extension. The MBONs that decreased proboscis extension and ingestion are different from those that drive avoidance behavior in another context. These studies provide insight into how activation of MB output neurons decreases proboscis extension to taste compounds."

In this study, we investigated the effects of genotype, sex, and body weight on the fetal muscle transcriptome of purebred Iberian and crossbred Iberian x Large White pigs sharing the same uterine environment. RNA sequencing was performed on 16 purebred and crossbred fetuses with high body weight (340±14g and 415±14g, respectively) and 16 with low body weight (246±14g and 311±14g, respectively), on gestational day 77. Genotype had the greatest effect on gene expression, with 645 genes identified as differentially expressed (DE) between purebred and crossbred animals. Functional analysis showed differential regulation of pathways involved in energy and lipid metabolism, muscle development, and tissue disorders. In purebred animals, fetal body weight was associated with 35 DE genes involved in development, lipid metabolism and adipogenesis. In crossbred animals, fetal body weight was associated with 60 DE genes involved in muscle development, viability, and immunity. Interestingly, the results suggested an interaction genotype*weight for some DE genes. Fetal sex had only a modest effect on gene expression. This study allowed the identification of genes, metabolic pathways, biological functions and regulators related to fetal genotype, weight and sex, in animals sharing the same uterine environment. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the molecular events that influence prenatal muscle development and highlight the complex interactions affecting transcriptional regulation during development."
https://openalex.org/W3004330425,"Background Glomerular hyperfiltration may be a clinical phenotype of endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial dysfunction may cause vascular dementia through the deterioration of cerebral blood flow. We aimed to identify the risk of dementia in people with glomerular hyperfiltration. Methods Using the Korean National Health Information Database, we included subjects aged ≥45 years who underwent national health screening examinations between 2012 and 2015 and who had no previous history of end-stage renal disease or dementia (n = 2,244,582). The primary exposure was glomerular hyperfiltration. We divided the subjects into groups by sex and five-year age intervals and categorized each group into 8 intervals according to estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR). The subjects with an eGFR ≥95th percentile in each group were defined as the hyperfiltration group. The outcomes were development of all types of dementia, Alzheimer's dementia and vascular dementia. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to analyze the hazard ratios (HRs) for outcomes. Results The Hyperfiltration group showed a higher risk for the development of all types of dementia [adjusted HR 1.09 (95% CI, 1.03–1.15)] and vascular dementia [adjusted HR 1.33 (95% CI, 1.14–1.55)] than the reference group. However, the association between hyperfiltration and Alzheimer's dementia was not statistically significant. Conclusions Glomerular hyperfiltration may be associated with dementia. In this respect, subjects with glomerular hyperfiltration should be monitored more closely for signs and symptoms of dementia."
https://openalex.org/W3004407783,"The horses’ responses to exercise are commonly monitored using physiological variables, nonetheless physical and mental states can also be expressed through body language. The aims of this study were: (i) to identify how facial expressions and other behavioural variables change in ranch horses after a routine workday, and (ii) to investigate if these changes can be used as indicators of physical tiredness by relating them to known variables of physical fitness and workload. Fourteen crossbred ranch horses were assessed pre- and post-workday on two farms, recording the body language, physiological and workload variables. Statistical analysis consisted of four stages: (i) comparisons between the sampling times (pre- vs post-workday) using linear mixed-effects models with repeated measures and a paired Wilcoxon test; (ii) selection of the most powerful variables by applying Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test and principal components analyses (PCA); (iii) evaluations of the relationships within these selected variables utilizing PCA and Spearman rank coefficients; and (iv) identifying a critical level of the most robust behavioural indicators using a non-hierarchical cluster analysis. Results showed that after a workday the horses increased the frequency/duration of body language indicative of resting. They also decreased the frequency/duration of body language indicative of attention and movements to avoid flies. However, some of these behaviours are also shown when horses are in pain, leading us to suggest that some ranch horses were probably experiencing a combination of of tiredness and slight soreness. Of particular interest, because of the ease with which it can be assessed on the farm and generalized to other situations, we suggest that the frequency of shifting weight between the forelegs has potential to be used as an indicator of physical tiredness in horses. The results can also be used in the development of tools to improve the welfare of ranch horses as well as horses used in other activities, although more research is needed to validate this assumption."
https://openalex.org/W3003962695,"A substantial number of patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) have axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), but early recognition of these patients is difficult for general practitioners (GPs). The Case Finding Axial Spondyloarthritis (CaFaSpA) referral strategy has shown to be able to identify patients with CLBP at risk for axSpA, but its impact on clinical daily practice is yet unknown.To assess the effect of the CaFaSpA referral strategy on pain caused by disability in primary care patients with CLBP.Within this clustered randomized controlled trial 93 general practices were randomized to either the CaFaSpA referral model (intervention) or usual primary care (control). In each group primary care patients between 18 and 45 years with CLBP were included. The primary outcome was disability caused by CLBP, measured with the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) at baseline and four months. Secondary outcome was the frequency of new axSpA diagnosis. Descriptive analyses were performed, and a linear mixed-effects model was used.In total 679 CLBP patients were included of which 333 patients were allocated to the intervention group and 346 to the control group. Sixty-four percent were female and mean age was 36.2 years. The mean RMDQ score at baseline was 8.39 in the intervention group and 8.61 in the control group. At four months mean RMDQ score was 7.65 in the intervention group and 8.15 in the control group. This difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.50). Six (8%) out of the 75 finally referred patients, were diagnosed with axSpA by their rheumatologist.The CaFaSpA referral strategy for axSpA did not have an effect on disability after four months caused by CLBP. However, the strategy is able to detect the axSpA patient within the large CLBP population sufficiently. Trial registration number: NCT01944163, Clinicaltrials.gov."
https://openalex.org/W2995149217,"Incomplete hippocampal inversion (IHI), also called hippocampal malrotation, is an atypical presentation of the hippocampus present in about 20% of healthy individuals. Here we conducted the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) in IHI to elucidate the genetic underpinnings that may contribute to the incomplete inversion during brain development. A total of 1381 subjects contributed to the discovery cohort obtained from the IMAGEN database. The incidence rate of IHI was 26.1%. Loci with P<1e-5 were followed up in a validation cohort comprising 161 subjects from the PING study. Summary statistics from the discovery cohort were used to compute IHI heritability as well as genetic correlations with other traits. A locus on 18q11.2 (rs9952569; OR = 1.999; Z = 5.502; P = 3.755e-8) showed a significant association with the presence of IHI. A functional annotation of the locus implicated genes AQP4 and KCTD1. However, neither this locus nor the other 16 suggestive loci reached a significant p-value in the validation cohort. The h2 estimate was 0.54 (sd: 0.30) and was significant (Z = 1.8; P = 0.036). The top three genetic correlations of IHI were with traits representing either intelligence or education attainment and reached nominal P< = 0.013."
https://openalex.org/W3003388761,"Atractylodes lancea, A. chinensis, and A. macrocephala are the three most widely used medicinal species of the Atractylodes genus. Their similar morphological features cause disagreement as whether they are three unique species, leading to their frequent misuses in medical products. Our study aimed to understand their relationships through both the complete plastome sequences and nuclear sequences, to identify molecular markers for their differentiation and explore the evolutionary relationships among three species. We sequenced, annotated, and analyzed the plastomes of these three species. The plastomes are 153,201, 153,258, and 153,265 bps in length for A. lancea, A. chinensis, and A. macrocephaly, respectively. Similar to other Asteraceae species, their plastomes exhibit typical quadripartite structures. Each plastome consists of 119 distinct genes, including 78 protein-coding, 37 tRNA, and 4 rRNA genes. Analyses of indels, single-nucleotide polymorphisms and simple sequence repeats, and comparison of plastomes showed high degree of conservation, leading to difficulty in the discovery of differentiating markers. We identified eleven potential molecular markers using an algorithm based on interspecific and intraspecific nucleotide diversity gaps. Validation experiments with fifty-five individuals from the three species collected from the botanical garden and fields confirmed that the marker cz11 could effectively distinguish samples from the three different species. Analysis of the several nuclear sequences suggests that the species of A. macrocephala may be a hybrid of A. lancea and A. chinensis. In summary, the results from this study highlight the complex relationships among of these three medicinal plants."
https://openalex.org/W3003638059,"Type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia are diseases that collectively increase the risk of patients developing cardiovascular complications. Several incretin-based drugs are reported to improve lipid metabolism, and one of these medications, anagliptin, is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor that has been shown to decrease serum triglyceride and low-density lipoproteins cholesterol. This study aimed to conduct an investigation into the effects of anagliptin on serum lipid profiles. This multicenter, open-label, randomized (1:1), parallel group study was designed to evaluate the effects of anagliptin on serum lipid profiles (triglycerides, lipoproteins, apolipoproteins, and cholesterol fractions). The study involved 24 patients with type 2 diabetes at two participating hospitals for a period of 24 weeks. Patients were randomly assigned to the anagliptin (n = 12) or control (n = 12) groups. Patients in the anagliptin group were treated with 200 mg of the drug twice daily. Patients in the control group did not receive anagliptin, but continued with their previous treatment schedules. Lipid metabolism was examined under fasting conditions at baseline and 24 weeks. Patients treated with anagliptin for 24 weeks exhibited significantly reduced levels of serum apolipoprotein B-48, a marker for lipid transport from the intestine, compared with the control group patients (P < 0.05). After 24 weeks of treatment, serum adiponectin levels were significantly raised, whereas glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were significantly lower compared with the baseline in the anagliptin group (P < 0.05), but not in the control group. This study showed that the DPP-4 inhibitor anagliptin reduces fasting apolipoprotein B-48 levels, suggesting that this drug may have beneficial effects on lipid metabolism possibly mediated by the inhibition of intestinal lipid transport."
https://openalex.org/W3003655547,"Hyperthyroidism in cats can mask changes in renal function, including chronic kidney disease (CKD), because of hyperfiltration and muscle loss. Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) has been shown to increase earlier than creatinine in cats with renal dysfunction, and, unlike creatinine, SDMA is not impacted by lean muscle mass. The aim of this study was to describe the relationship between SDMA, creatinine, body weight and TT4 over time during treatment of hyperthyroidism. Cats were retrospectively identified from the US IDEXX Reference Laboratories database where TT4, SDMA and creatinine were measured on the same cat at multiple time points. A hyperthyroid treated group was identified (TT4 ≤ 4.7 μg/dL and decreased by a minimum of 2.5 μg/dL) that had body weight and laboratory results available from more than one visit, and was used to evaluate body weight, creatinine, SDMA and TT4 pre-treatment and at 1-30, 31-60, 61-90, 91-120 days post-treatment. Creatinine significantly decreased with increasing concentrations of TT4 (Spearman's ρ = -0.37, P < 0.001), whereas SDMA did not. Body weight, SDMA and creatinine concentrations significantly increased during the immediate 1-30 day post-treatment period (P < 0.012, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively). During treatment creatinine continued to increase as cats gained weight. In contrast, SDMA remained stable during treatment and was comparable to age-matched control cats. Therefore, SDMA may be a more reliable biomarker of renal function than creatinine in hyperthyroid cats before and during treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3004083576,"Background Studies on early predictors of intelligence often focus on single or few predictors and often on childhood intelligence. This study compared the contributions of a broad selection of potential early predictors of intelligence at different adult ages. Methods Information on predictors was recorded prospectively in the Copenhagen Perinatal Cohort during pregnancy, at delivery, and at 1- and 3-year examinations for children born between 1959–61. Adult intelligence was assessed at three independent follow-ups using three different tests of intelligence: Børge Priens Prøve, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, and Intelligenz-Struktur-Test 2000R. From a total of 4697 cohort members, three non-overlapping samples were derived. Results The included predictors explained between 22.2–24.3% of the variance in adult IQ, with parental socioeconomic status and sex explaining 16.2–17.0%. Other consistent predictors were head circumference at birth, increase in head circumference head during the first three years, and 3-year milestones. Head circumference was the most important anthropometric measure compared to measures of weight and length. Conclusion Besides social status and sex, the strongest and most consistent early predictors of adult intelligence were physical or behavioural characteristics that to some extent reflect brain–and cognitive development."
https://openalex.org/W3000758589,"Earlier studies have implied a change in dietary habits of the Swedish population towards a low carbohydrate, high fat diet. Questions have been raised about the development in recent years and potential health effects. We have investigated the dietary intake of Swedish female students enrolled in a university nutrition course between 2002 and 2017. The students carried out self-reporting of all food and drink intake over one weekday and one weekend day. Intake of macronutrients (E%) and micronutrients were calculated for the whole period while statistical analysis was performed for changes between 2009 and 2017 (729 women). Results showed significant changes in carbohydrate intake (from 47.0 to 41.4 E%) and fat intake (from 31.7 to 37.5 E%). Carbohydrate intake was significantly lower than the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations (45-60 E%). However, daily fiber intake remains high (3.0 g/MJ) in a national context, and intake of vitamin D and folate appears to increase during the period. The results suggest that the observed national transition from carbohydrate to fat intake persists, and that it might be especially evident among individuals interested in food and nutrition. Considering the fiber and micronutrient intake, the change is not necessarily unfavorable for this particular group."
https://openalex.org/W3003303118,"Corynebacterium diphtheriae is a human pathogen that causes diphtheria. In response to immune system-induced oxidative stress, C. diphtheriae expresses antioxidant enzymes, among which are methionine sulfoxide reductase (Msr) enzymes, which are critical for bacterial survival in the face of oxidative stress. Although some aspects of the catalytic mechanism of the Msr enzymes have been reported, several details still await full elucidation. Here, we solved the solution structure of C. diphtheriae MsrB (Cd-MsrB) and unraveled its catalytic and oxidation-protection mechanisms. Cd-MsrB catalyzes methionine sulfoxide reduction involving three redox-active cysteines. Using NMR heteronuclear single-quantum coherence spectra, kinetics, biochemical assays, and MS analyses, we show that the conserved nucleophilic residue Cys-122 is S-sulfenylated after substrate reduction, which is then resolved by a conserved cysteine, Cys-66, or by the nonconserved residue Cys-127. We noted that the overall structural changes during the disulfide cascade expose the Cys-122–Cys-66 disulfide to recycling through thioredoxin. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide, Cd-MsrB formed reversible intra- and intermolecular disulfides without losing its Cys-coordinated Zn2+, and only the nonconserved Cys-127 reacted with the low-molecular-weight (LMW) thiol mycothiol, protecting it from overoxidation. In summary, our structure-function analyses reveal critical details of the Cd-MsrB catalytic mechanism, including a major structural rearrangement that primes the Cys-122–Cys-66 disulfide for thioredoxin reduction and a reversible protection against excessive oxidation of the catalytic cysteines in Cd-MsrB through intra- and intermolecular disulfide formation and S-mycothiolation.

Methionine sulfoxide reductase B (MsrB) of Mycobacterium smegmatis plays a limited role in resisting oxidative stress.Tuberculosis (Edinb). 2009; 89 (20006300): S26-S3210.1016/S1472-9792(09)70008-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and also the msrB deletion mutants of Enterococcus faecalis and Francisella tularensis showed increased sensitivity toward oxidative stress (17Zhao C.

Also structural studies gave insight into the catalytic mechanisms and the role of MsrB as an antioxidant regulatory enzyme and methionine sulfoxide scavenger (19Lee S.H. Li C.W. Koh K.W. Chuang H.Y.

Once a MetSO substrate is reduced by the MsrB nucleophilic cysteine, it forms a sulfenic acid (−SOH). This more electrophilic sulfenic acid is being attacked by the sulfur of a resolving cysteine to form a disulfide bond, and the disulfide is reduced by one of the reducing pathways, such as the thioredoxin pathway, or by a low-molecular-weight thiol (LMW-thiol) pathway. The most abundant LMW-thiol of Gram-negative bacteria and eukaryotes is GSH, whereas in Actinobacteria, it is mycothiol (21Van Laer K. Hamilton C.J. Messens J. Low-molecular-weight thiols in thiol-disulfide exchange.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2013; 18 (23075082): 1642-165310.1089/ars.2012.4964Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Aside from the catalytic cysteines, some MsrB enzymes also have two CXXC motifs, which are distant in their primary amino acid sequence but in proximity in the three-dimensional structure. These cysteines are not involved in the catalytic mechanism, but they coordinate Zn2+ to maintain its overall structure. We present detailed insights into the catalytic and oxidation protection mechanisms of C. diphtheriae MsrB (Cd-MsrB). We combined structural, biochemical, and kinetic approaches with MS and ICP-MS to show that Cd-MsrB catalyzes via a disulfide cascade mechanism. Furthermore, Cd-MsrB reversibly protects its catalytic cysteines from overoxidation by disulfide bond formation and S-mycothiolation. Cd-MsrB has seven cysteines (Fig. S1): two are conserved catalytic cysteines (Cys-122 and Cys-66, black asterisks) (22Neiers F. Sonkaria S. Olry A. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G.

To determine the overall architecture of Cd-MsrB, and the location of its conserved and nonconserved cysteines, we determined the solution structure of reduced Cd-MsrB (Fig. 1 and Fig. S2). The Cd-MsrB [1H,15N]-HSQC spectrum features a set of well-resolved peaks, typical for a folded globular protein (Fig. S2). Using triple-resonance NMR experiments, we assigned 89% of all backbone amides, but the NH resonances of Thr-2, Asn-3, Ser-18, Asn-39–Thr-41, Asn-63–Gly-67, Gly-77, His-88, and Ser-125 were not observed in the spectra. Observable aliphatic and aromatic protons of the protein side chains were also assigned. The structure calculations show a good convergence with the position of the protein backbone well-defined along most of the polypeptide chain. Several loop regions (residues 37–42 and 62–68) display high structural variability, most likely due to the paucity of the resonance assignments and/or the scarcity of inter-residue NOEs (Fig. 1A). Similar to other MsrB enzymes, Cd-MsrB has two anti-parallel β-sheets, and two α-helices (Fig. 1, A and B) (23Lowther W.T. Weissbach H. Etienne F. Brot N. Matthews B.W.

At its N terminus, it has an additional short α-helix (α1) (Fig. 1). Cd-MsrB active site, which features a hydrophobic pocket (Trp-68) and H-bond donors (His-103, His-106, and Asn-124) (Fig. 1C), is a mirror image of the C. diphtheriae MsrA active site (Fig. 1D) (26Tossounian M.A. Pedre B.

As Cd-MsrB contains two CXXC motifs, we used ICP-MS to confirm that Cd-MsrB contains a Zn2+, which has been shown to be coordinated by the cysteines of the CXXC motifs (24Ranaivoson F.M. Neiers F. Kauffmann B. Boschi-Muller S. Branlant G. Favier F. Methionine sulfoxide reductase B displays a high level of flexibility.J. Mol.

The conserved Cys-122 is located 8 Å away from Cys-66, and 15 Å away from Cys-127. Both Cys-122 and Cys-66 thiol groups are surface exposed, whereas the thiols of Cys-127 and the cysteines of the two CXXC motifs are more buried (Fig. 1B). As the exact role of the conserved and nonconserved cysteines of Cd-MsrB was not known, we decided to identify how they contribute to the catalytic mechanism of Cd-MsrB. To determine which cysteines are involved in methionine sulfoxide reduction, three single Cys to Ser mutants were generated (C66S, C122S, and C127S). With reversed-phase chromatography, we monitored the formation of methionine after enzymatic reduction of methionine sulfoxide (MetSO) at 215 nm (Fig. 2A) (26Tossounian M.A. Pedre B. Wahni K. Erdogan H. Vertommen D. Van Molle I. Messens J. Corynebacterium diphtheriae methionine sulfoxide reductase a exploits a unique mycothiol redox relay mechanism.J. Biol.

This experiment was performed in the presence of DTT to recycle the enzyme. Mutation of the nonconserved Cys-127 did not interfere with the production of methionine, as both Cd-MsrB wildtype (WT) (319 ± 13 μm) and MsrB C127S (382 ± 24 μm) produce almost similar concentrations of methionine. In the absence of the conserved nucleophilic Cys-122, no methionine is produced, which shows its role in MetSO reduction during the first step of the reaction. Mutation of the conserved resolving Cys-66 produced 10-fold more methionine (3038 ± 74 μm) compared with WT Cd-MsrB (Fig. 2B). With CD, we then found that mutation of Cys-66 (Cd-MsrB C66S) changes the overall secondary structure, which turned out to increase the MetSO reduction efficiency of Cd-MsrB (Fig. S3A). Structural changes were also observed for the C127S mutant; however, these overall changes had no effect on the reduction efficiency of Cd-MsrB (Fig. S3B). We first decided to confirm sulfenic acid formation on Cys-122 of Cd-MsrB, as this has already been shown for MsrB from other species (27Olry A. Boschi-Muller S. Marraud M. Sanglier-Cianferani S.

Reduced WT Cd-MsrB, the C66S/C127S (only Cys-122 is present) mutant, and the C66S/C122S (only Cys-127 is present) mutant were incubated with dimedone, which specifically reacts with the sulfur of a cysteine once a sulfenic acid (−SOH) is formed (Fig. S4). On an anti-dimedone immunoblot, we clearly detected dimedone formation only when nucleophilic Cys-122 is present (Fig. S4, lanes 2 and 4). Next, we wanted to know whether a disulfide is formed after MetSO reduction. By using mass spectrometric analysis of Cd-MsrB WT in the presence and absence of MetSO, we detected Cys-122–Cys-127 to be the most predominant disulfide after substrate reduction, next to the Cys-66–Cys-122 disulfide. In addition, a minor population of inter- and intramolecular disulfides between the cysteines involved in zinc coordination was observed. This could be due to a population of Cd-MsrB, which might not contain zinc, making it possible for those cysteines of the CXXC motif to form a disulfide. Or, alternatively, these disulfides could have been generated during sample preparation for mass spectrometric analysis. To confirm the formation of the two disulfide bonds after substrate reduction, we determined the free thiol (−SH) content of Cd-MsrB WT, C66S, C122S, and C127S mutants in the presence and absence of MetSO-substrate using the DTNB assay (29Riener C.K. Kada G. Gruber H.J. Quick measurement of protein sulfhydryls with Ellman's reagent and with 4,4′-dithiodipyridine.Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2002; 373 (12110978): 266-27610.1007/s00216-002-1347-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In the presence of MetSO, both the C66S and C127S mutants showed loss of two free thiols (Table S2). This confirms that both the Cys-122–Cys-127 and the Cys-66–Cys-122 disulfides can be formed after substrate reduction (Table S2). As the distances between the nucleophilic Cys-122 and the two resolving cysteines, Cys-66 and Cys-127, are more than 3 Å (Fig. 1B), we wanted to investigate whether structural changes occur upon disulfide bond formation. Both circular dichroism (CD) (Fig. S5) and NMR-HSQC spectral analysis were used (Figure 3, Figure 4). Comparing the CD spectra of reduced and MetSO-treated MsrB, we observed a decrease in the molar ellipticity at 208 and 222 nm, which indicate an increase in the overall α helical content upon the addition of MetSO (Fig. S5). To further confirm this observation, we obtained NMR-HSQC spectra of MetSO-treated Cd-MsrB (oxidized sample) directly, and after 19 h of incubation at 25 °C. Also here we observed pronounced NMR spectral changes upon treatment of MsrB with MetSO (Fig. 3). The HSQC spectrum of the oxidized MsrB shows two sets of resonances: intense peaks of a major form and much weaker signals of a minor form (Fig. 3B). The presence of the two different forms agrees with the mass spectrometric analysis, where major (Cys-122–Cys-127) and minor (Cys-66–Cys-122) disulfide species are observed. Upon further incubation of the MetSO-treated MsrB at 25 °C for 19 h, the major HSQC peaks progressively diminish and eventually disappear, whereas the minor resonances increase in intensity. The resulting spectrum shows a single set of peaks after 19 h (Fig. 3C), which are very similar, but not identical, to those of the reduced MsrB (Fig. 3A). The observed spectral changes are characteristic for a slow chemical reaction and the associated structural reorganization process, which would be expected for the disulfide exchange. Unfortunately we were unable to obtain the NMR structure of oxidized MsrB, due to progressive protein aggregation, which leads to a dramatic degradation of the spectral quality. Nevertheless, the detailed analysis of the NMR spectra of the oxidized MsrB allowed us to distinguish between the two disulfide forms. The large differences in structural properties of the two disulfides can be studied by following NMR-HSQC resonances of protein backbone amides, which are sensitive reporters of the local chemical environment. To probe the surroundings of Cys-127, we monitored the well-resolved NH resonances of its neighboring Val-126 and Leu-128 (Fig. 4, green panel). Important to note is that the HSQC peak of Cys-127 is excluded from the analysis as it strongly overlaps with another resonance. Compared with the spectrum of the reduced protein (Fig. 3A, black), the Val-126 and Leu-128 peaks shift to a different location in the initial form of the oxidized MsrB (Fig. 3B, red), yet return to the same spectral position in the final oxidized form (Fig. 3C, blue). This suggests that the chemical environment of Cys-127 is the same in the reduced and final oxidized forms, but different in the initial oxidized MsrB species, which indicates an initial Cys-122–Cys-127 and final Cys-66–Cys-122 disulfides. Similarly, we can focus on the Cys-122 region, by monitoring spectral changes of the Tyr-121, Cys-122, and Ile-123 NH resonances (Fig. 4, orange panel). The local environment of Cys-122 disulfide-bound to Cys-127 (red spectrum) is very different from that of Cys-122 coupled to Cys-66 (blue spectrum) or bearing a free thiol (black spectrum). A similar analysis of the Cys-66 surroundings in the two disulfides could not be performed because of the paucity of the resonance assignments in the Asn-63–Gly-67 region. Overall, MsrB oxidation by MetSO leads to the formation of an initial Cys-122–Cys-127 species, followed by a disulfide exchange reaction; yielding the final Cys-66–Cys-122 form. The thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase (Trx/TrxR) pathway is used by most organisms to recycle protein disulfide bonds generated under oxidizing environment (30Arnér E.S. Holmgren A. Physiological functions of thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase.Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267 (11012661): 6102-610910.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01701.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (1994) Google Scholar, 31Holmgren A.

To determine whether the Cd-MsrB disulfide bonds formed after MetSO reduction could be recycled by Trx, a spectrophotometric coupled enzyme assay was performed (Fig. 5A). The consumption of NADPH was monitored at 340 nm in function of time for WT Cd-MsrB and the C66S, C122S, and C127S mutants. The C66S and C122S mutants showed no NADPH consumption, whereas mutation of Cys-127 (C127S) only marginally affected the coupling to the Trx/TrxR pathway (Fig. 5A). Based on these results, we showed that Trx only recognizes the disulfide between Cys-66 and Cys-122. Next, we determined the steady-state kinetic parameters for MetSO reduction by WT Cd-MsrB, which resulted in a kcat/Km of 86 m−1 s−1 (Fig. S6). The rate of disulfide bond reduction by thioredoxin was determined by first incubating Cd-MsrB with 10 mm MetSO for 30 min at room temperature to allow for disulfide bond formation. MetSO was then removed, and increasing concentrations of oxidized Cd-MsrB (MsrBS-S) (0–20 μm) were used as substrate for Trx within the Trx/TrxR pathway. NADPH consumption at 340 nm was monitored in function of time, which indicated MsrBS-S disulfide bond reduction by Trx. The initial velocities obtained were divided by the concentration of Trx, and plotted against the concentration of MsrBS-S. The data were fitted with the Michaelis-Menten equation, and the rate of disulfide bond reduction by Trx was determined to be 1.7 × 104m−1 s−1 (Fig. 5B). Based on these results, we propose the following mechanism (Fig. 6), where (step I), the nucleophilic Cys-122 attacks the sulfoxide of MetSO, which results in the release of Met, and the formation of a sulfenic acid on Cys-122. Then, either Cys-66 or Cys-127 performs a nucleophilic attack on the sulfur of the sulfenic acid on Cys-122, which results in the formation of Cys-122–Cys-127 (step II) or Cys-66–Cys-122 (step III) disulfides. After Cys-122–Cys-127 disulfide bond formation, a disulfide exchange occurs, where the thiolate of Cys-66 attacks the sulfur of Cys-122 and forms a Cys-122–Cys-66 disulfide (step IV), which is then recognized by thioredoxin and reduced (step V) (Fig. 6). Aside from the Trx/TrxR pathway, most organisms use alternative reducing pathways such as the GSH pathway (32Fahey R.C. Brown W.C. Adams W.B. Worsham M.B. Occurrence of glutathione in bacteria.J.

Evaluation of the underlying growth and development mechanisms of these species is essential to predict tree growth under climate change. This study investigated climate sensitivity to temperature, precipitation, dry periods, and the associated genomic regions in Cryptomeria japonica, Japan's most commercially important tree. We used tree rings and common garden experiments with three clonal replicates planted in two contrasting environments in Kyushu (Kumamoto site) and Honshu (Chiba site), Japan. Tree growth showed a significant negative correlation with the dry period (>4 days) in March of the year of tree-ring formation at the Chiba site. In contrast, temperature and precipitation had little influence on tree growth. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was performed to investigate climate sensitivity to dry periods at the Chiba site, revealing 13 significant QTLs. One QTL showed a substantially large contribution to the overall climate sensitivity, accounting for 12.4% of the total phenotypic variation. The phenotypic variance explained (PVE) by other QTLs ranged from 0.9% to 2.9%, and the total PVE by all QTLs was 35.6%. These findings indicate that the tree population at the Chiba site could be vulnerable to drought in early spring and that the QTL showing the greatest impact on climate sensitivity may be closely related to genes associated with tolerance or adaptation to drought stress. The QTLs identified in this study could be useful for molecular breeding, forest management, and predicting the growth of C. japonica under a changing climate."
https://openalex.org/W3003658226,"The lungs of people and companion animals are now recognized to harbor diverse, low biomass bacterial communities. While these communities are difficult to characterize using culture-based approaches, targeted molecular methods such as 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing can do so using DNA extracted from samples such as bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Previous studies identified a surprisingly uniform composition of the microbiota in the lungs of healthy research dogs living in a controlled environment, however there are no reports of the lung microbiota of client-owned dogs. Moreover, compositional changes in the lung microbiota depending on disease status have been reported in people, suggesting that similar events may occur in dogs, a species subject to several respiratory disease mechanisms analogous to those seen in people. To address these knowledge gaps, BALF samples from client-owned dogs presenting to the University of Missouri Veterinary Health Center for respiratory signs between 2014 and 2017 were processed for and subjected to 16S rRNA sequencing. Based on specific diagnostic criteria, dogs were categorized as Chronic Bronchitis (CB, n = 53) or non-CB (n = 11). Community structure was compared between groups, as well as to historical data from healthy research dogs (n = 16) of a uniform breed and environment. The lung microbiota detected in all client-owned dogs was markedly different in composition from that previously detected in research dogs and contained increased relative abundance of multiple canine fecal and environmental bacteria, likely due to aspiration associated with their clinical signs. While inter-sample diversity differed significantly between samples from CB and non-CB dogs, the variability within both groups made it difficult to discern reproducible bacterial classifiers of disease. During subsequent analyses to identify other sources of variability within the data however, population-wide temporal dynamics in community structure were observed, with substantial changes occurring in late 2015 and again in early 2017. A review of regional climate data indicated that the first change occurred during a historically warm and wet period, suggesting that changes in environmental conditions may be associated with changes in the respiratory microbiota in the context of respiratory disease. As the lung microbiota in humans and other animals is believed to result from repetitive micro-aspirations during health and in certain disease states associated with dyspnea and laryngeal dysfunction, these data support the increased colonization of the lower airways during compromised airway function, and the potential for temporal effects due to putative factors such as climate."

Other percentile models (ranging from the 1st to 99th percentile) were generated based on anthropometric scaling of the 50th percentile models and compared. The resultant models are reasonably accurate in terms of both musculoskeletal geometry and neck strength, demonstrating the effectiveness of the developed methodology for interactive neck model generation with anthropometric scaling."

Taken together, these data support a conserved role for CEP164 throughout the development of numerous organs, which, we suggest, accounts for the multi-system disease phenotype of CEP164-mediated NPHP-RC."
https://openalex.org/W3003989747,"Gastric cancer (GC) is a significant cancer-related cause of death worldwide. The most used chemotherapeutic regimen in GC is based on platinum drugs such as cisplatin (CDDP). However, CDDP resistance reduces advanced GC survival. In vitro drug-resistant cell model would help in the understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying this drug-resistance phenomenon. The aim of this study was to characterize new models of CDDP-resistant GC cell lines (AGS R-CDDP and MKN-28 R-CDDP) obtained through a stepwise increasing drug doses method, in order to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying chemoresistance as well as identify new therapeutic targets for the treatment of GC. Cell viability assays, cell death assays and the expression of resistance molecular markers confirmed that AGS R-CDDP and MKN-28 R-CDDP are reliable CDDP-resistant models. RNA-seq and bioinformatics analyses identified a total of 189 DEGs, including 178 up-regulated genes and 11 down-regulated genes, associated mainly to molecular functions involved in CDDP-resistance. DEGs were enriched in 23 metabolic pathways, among which the most enriched was the inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signaling pathway. Finally, the higher mRNA expression of SERPINA1, BTC and CCL5, three up-regulated DEGs associated to CDDP resistance found by RNA-seq analysis was confirmed. In summary, this study showed that AGS R-CDDP and MKN-28 R-CDDP are reliable models of CDDP resistance because resemble many of resistant phenotype in GC, being also useful to assess potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of gastric cancers resistant to CDDP. In addition, we identified several DEGs associated with molecular functions such as binding, catalytic activity, transcription regulator activity and transporter activity, as well as signaling pathways associated with inflammation process, which could be involved in the development of CDDP resistance in GC. Further studies are necessary to clarify the role of inflammatory processes in GC resistant to CDDP and these models could be useful for these purposes."
https://openalex.org/W3004144492,"This paper aims to explore whether entrepreneurial ethics can improve entrepreneurial performance in new ventures. The dynamic impact of entrepreneurial ethics on entrepreneurial performance (survival and sustainable growth) is investigated from an institutional perspective, and the moderating role of firm visibility between them is explored. From different regions of China, 296 valid questionnaires are obtained and analyzed. We find that entrepreneurial ethics is adverse to the survival of new ventures but conducive to their sustainable growth of new ventures. We also find that high firm visibility can help entrepreneurial ethics be more effective in improving entrepreneurial performance. This study provides a new insight to explain the theoretical controversy of entrepreneurial ethics and provides guidance for the establishment of the internal ethical structures of new ventures. Suggestions for government and industry regulators on the management of entrepreneurial ethics are also provided."
https://openalex.org/W3003157061,"Alpine and arctic bird populations have shown an unmistakable decrease over the last three decades, and the need for conservation is highly necessary. We investigated the use of five privately-owned dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) as a non-invasive tool to determine the presence of rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta), through sniffing out faecal pellets, using a yes/no training regime. We carried out 36 double-blind experimental trials per dog and hypothesised that dogs could discriminate the rock ptarmigan from similar species, such as black grouse (Tetrao tetrix), western capercaillie (T. urogallus) and willow grouse (L. lagopus). Our dogs detected differences between the avian species with an average accuracy of 65.9%, sensitivity of 66.7% and specificity of 65.3%. We showed that privately-owned dogs have the potential to be used as biodetectors for conservational work within controlled laboratory conditions for declining species, but overall, only one dog was considered proficient enough. We concluded that dogs could be used as a non-invasive tool to detect the rock ptarmigan, and with further field training and testing, operate in the field for detection surveys."
https://openalex.org/W3003269392,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been widely utilized to noninvasively explore the motor system during the observation of human movement. However, few studies have characterized motor cortex activity during periodic gait observation. Thus, this study examined the effects of an observer's visual experience and/or intention to imitate on corticospinal excitability during the observation of another's gait. Twenty-six healthy volunteers were included in this study and allocated to two different groups. Participants in the visual experience group had formal experience with gait observation (physical therapist training), while those in the control group did not. Motor-evoked potentials induced by TMS in the tibialis anterior and soleus muscles were measured as surrogates of corticospinal excitability. Participants were seated and, while resting, they observed a demonstrator's gait or observed it with the intention to subsequently reproduce it. Compared with the resting state, cyclic gait observation led to significant corticospinal facilitation in the tibialis anterior and soleus muscles. However, this pattern of corticospinal facilitation in the measured muscles was not coupled to the pattern of crural muscle activity during actual gait and was independent of the step cycle. This motor cortex facilitation effect during gait observation was enhanced by the observer's visual experience in a manner that was not step cycle-dependent, while the observer's intent to imitate did not affect corticospinal excitatory input to either muscle. In addition, visual experience did not modulate corticospinal excitability in gait-related crural muscles. Our findings indicate that motor cortex activity during gait observation is not in line with the timing of muscle activity during gait execution and is modulated by an individual's gait observation experience. These results suggest that visual experience acquired from repetitive gait observation may facilitate the motor system's control on bipedal walking, but may not promote the learning of muscle activity patterns."
https://openalex.org/W3003278836,"This paper attempts to verify the ""inverted U"" effect of the income gap on the total factor productivity (TFP) of the country or region by constructing a theoretical model that includes income effects and substitution effects. Based on this, this paper uses the multinational panel data of 53 countries in the world from 1995 to 2014 for empirical research. The research shows that: (1) the income gap has an ""inverted U-shaped"" effect on the national TFP, and the inflection point is located at about 0.269; (2) The income gap is also verified by the ""inverted U"" influence mechanism of the national TFP by affecting the income effect and the substitution effect; (3) The difference in the development stage determines that countries should adopt an income distribution policy that is compatible with their own country. The conclusions of this paper strengthen the confidence and determination to improve the supply system and promote regional innovation, and confirm the necessity of promoting global economic restructuring and achieving global inclusive development to a certain extent."
https://openalex.org/W3003446903,"This study shows the feasibility of the Electrospinning method as a process step for advanced and fast production Li ion cells. Lamination is a key technology for Lithium-ion battery production. It bares different advantages, such as a fast production line speed by fixing the separator to the electrodes. Unfortunately, this technology is inapplicable for separator and electrode formulations not based on thermoplastic binders. Using Electrospinning, this disadvantage can be overcome. In our study, beaded PVDF polymer nanofibres were spun onto a fibre-reinforced, inorganic-filled separator. This modified separator was then laminated onto a NMC111-cathode using a temperature profile of 110/110/120°C within the laminator. After Lamination, the separator was pulled-off again and placed in a SEM to see the adhesive behaviour of the applied polymer. The information gathered with SEM clearly shows a successful lamination of the separator to the electrode."
https://openalex.org/W3003672326,"Chronic lameness affects bovine welfare and has a negative economic impact in dairy industry. Moreover, due to the translational gap between traditional pain models and new drugs development for treating chronic pain states, naturally occurring painful diseases could be a potential translational tool for chronic pain research. We therefore employed liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to stablish the proteomic profile of the spinal cord samples from lumbar segments (L2-L4) of chronic lame dairy cows. Data were validated and quantified through software tool (Scaffold® v 4.0) using output data from two search engines (SEQUEST® and X-Tandem®). Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) analysis was performed to detect proteins interactions. LC-MS/MS identified a total amount of 177 proteins; of which 129 proteins were able to be quantified. Lame cows showed a strong upregulation of interacting proteins with chaperone and stress functions such as Hsp70 (p < 0.006), Hsc70 (p < 0.0079), Hsp90 (p < 0.015), STIP (p > 0.0018) and Grp78 (p <0.0068), and interacting proteins associated to glycolytic pathway such as; γ-enolase (p < 0.0095), α-enolase (p < 0.013) and hexokinase-1 (p < 0.028). It was not possible to establish a clear network of interaction in several upregulated proteins in lame cows. Non-interacting proteins were mainly associated to redox process and cytoskeletal organization. The most relevant down regulated protein in lame cows was myelin basic protein (MBP) (p < 0.02). Chronic inflammatory lameness in cows is associated to increased expression of stress proteins with chaperone, metabolism, redox and structural functions. A state of endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) might explain the changes in protein expression in lame cows; however, further studies need to be performed in order to confirm these findings."
https://openalex.org/W3003155419,"One way to increase physical activity in offices is to install treadmill workstations, where office workers can walk on a treadmill while performing their normal tasks. However, the experiences of people using these treadmill workstations over a long period of time is not known. In this 13-month study, we explored the experiences of office workers with treadmill workstations available in their offices. After completing a larger randomized controlled trial with 80 office workers ages 40 to 67 years with overweight or obesity, we interviewed 20 participants from the intervention group, using a semi-structured interview guide. Data were analyzed using a grounded theory approach with constant comparison of emerging codes, subcategories, and categories, followed by connecting the categories to create a core category. The core category is described as the “Ability to benefit.” Although all participants had a rather high motivational level and pre-existing knowledge about the health benefits of increasing physical activity at work, they had different capacities for benefiting from the intervention. The categories are described as ideal types: the Convinced, the Competitive, the Responsible, and the Vacillating. These ideal types do not represent any single participant but suggest generalized abstractions of experiences and strategies emerging from the coding of the interviews. One participant could easily have more than one ideal type. Because of differences in ideal type strategies and paths used throughout the course of the study, participants had different abilities to benefit from the intervention. Knowledge regarding the ideal types may be applied to facilitate the use of the treadmill workstations. Because different ideal types might require different prompts for behavior change, tailored intervention strategies directed towards specific ideal types could be necessary."
https://openalex.org/W3004286156,"Nutritional intake during gestation is known to impact health outcomes for progeny. Correlational evidence in humans suggests that increased fruit consumption of pregnant mothers enhances infant cognitive development. Moreover, wild-type Drosophila supplemented with a combination of orange and tomato juice showed robust enhancements in performance on an associative olfactory memory task. The current study aimed to experimentally test the effects of prenatal fruit juice exposure in a non-human, mammalian model of learning and memory.Across three separate birth cohorts, pregnant rats were given access to diluted tomato and orange juice (N = 2 per cohort), with control rats (N = 2 per cohort) receiving only water, in addition to standard rodent chow, throughout the duration of gestation, ending at parturition. Following weaning, male offspring were tested for learning and memory in a spatial version of the circular water maze and an auditory-cued fear-conditioning task.All pregnant rats increased fluid and food intake over the gestational period. Fruit juice-fed pregnant rats had increased fluid intake compared to control pregnant rats. When testing progeny, there were no effects of prenatal fruit juice on spatial learning, while it appeared to impair learning in fear conditioning relative to controls. However, we measured significant enhancements in both spatial memory and conditioned fear memory in the prenatal fruit-juice group compared to controls. Measures of vigilance, in response to the conditioned cue, were increased in prenatal fruit rats compared to controls, suggesting less generalized, and more adaptive, anxiety behaviours.Our results corroborate the human and Drosophila findings of prenatal fruit effects on behaviour, specifically that prenatal fruit juice exposure may be beneficial for early-life memory consolidation in rats."
https://openalex.org/W3004359069,"Background The aim of this study was to investigate whether 33% duty cycle increases end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) level, a surrogate measurement for cardiac output during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), compared with 50% duty cycle. Methods Six pigs were randomly assigned to the DC33 or DC50 group. After 3 min of induced ventricular fibrillation (VF), CPR was performed for 5 min with 33% duty cycle (DC33 group) or with 50% duty cycle (DC50 group) (phase I). Defibrillation was delivered until return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) thereafter. After 30 min of stabilization, the animals were re-assigned to the opposite groups. VF was induced again, and CPR was performed (phase II). The primary outcome was ETCO2 during CPR, and the secondary outcomes were coronary perfusion pressure (CPP), systolic arterial pressure (SAP), diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), and right atrial pressure (RAP). Results Mean ETCO2 was higher in the DC33 group compared with the DC50 group (22.5 mmHg vs 21.5 mmHg, P = 0.018). In a linear mixed model, 33% duty cycle increased ETCO2 by 1.0 mmHg compared with 50% duty cycle (P < 0.001). ETCO2 increased over time in the DC33 group [0.6 mmHg/min] while ETCO2 decreased in the DC50 group [-0.6 mmHg/min] (P < 0.001). Duty cycle of 33% increased SAP (6.0 mmHg, P < 0.001), DAP (8.9 mmHg, P < 0.001) RAP (2.6 mmHg, P < 0.001) and CPP (4.7 mmHg, P < 0.001) compared with the duty cycle of 50%. Conclusion Duty cycle of 33% increased ETCO2, a surrogate measurement for cardiac output during CPR, compared with duty cycle of 50%. Moreover, ETCO2 increased over time during CPR with 33% duty cycle while ETCO2 decreased with 50% duty cycle."
