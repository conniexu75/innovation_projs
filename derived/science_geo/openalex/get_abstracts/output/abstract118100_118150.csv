https://openalex.org/W2076000327,"Women are particularly susceptible to malaria during first and second pregnancies, even though they may have developed immunity over years of residence in endemic areas. Plasmodium falciparum-infected red blood cells (IRBCs) were obtained from human placentas. These IRBCs bound to purified chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) but not to other extracellular matrix proteins or to other known IRBC receptors. IRBCs from nonpregnant donors did not bind to CSA. Placental IRBCs adhered to sections of fresh-frozen human placenta with an anatomic distribution similar to that of naturally infected placentas, and this adhesion was competitively inhibited by purified CSA. Thus, adhesion to CSA appears to select for a subpopulation of parasites that causes maternal malaria."

https://openalex.org/W2046338633,"The appearance of phosphatidylserine on the surface of animal cells triggers phagocytosis and blood coagulation. Normally, phosphatidylserine is confined to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane by an aminophospholipid translocase, which has now been cloned and sequenced. The bovine enzyme is a member of a previously unrecognized subfamily of P-type adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases) that may have diverged from the primordial enzyme before the separation of the known families of ion-translocating ATPases. Studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggest that aminophospholipid translocation is a general function of members of this family."

https://openalex.org/W2030840873,"Recently, transplantation of mouse donor spermatogonial stem cells from a fertile testis to an infertile recipient mouse testis was described. The donor cells established spermatogenesis in the seminiferous tubules of the host, and normal spermatozoa were produced. In the most successful transplants, the recipient mice were fertile and sired up to 80 per cent of progeny from donor cells. Here we examine the feasibility of transplanting spermatogonial stem cells from other species to the mouse seminiferous tubule to generate spermatogenesis. Marked testis cells from transgenic rats were transplanted to the testes of immunodeficient mice, and in all of 10 recipient mice (in 19 of 20 testes), rat spermatogenesis occurred. Epididymides of eight mice were examined, and the three from mice with the longest transplants (> or = 110 days) contained rat spermatozoa with normal morphology. The generation of rat spermatogenesis in mouse testes suggests that spermatogonial stem cells of many species could be transplanted, and opens the possibility of xenogeneic spermatogenesis for other species."

Here it is shown that the descending output is organized in such a way that different hippocampal regions map in an orderly way onto hypothalamic systems mediating the expression of different classes of goal-oriented behavior. This mapping is characterized by a unidirectional hippocampo-lateral septal projection and then by bidirectional lateral septo-hypothalamic projections, all topographically organized. The connectional evidence predicts that information processing in different regions of the hippocampus selectively influences the expression of different classes of behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1976561164,"Genetic analysis has implicated SPT6, an essential gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in the control of chromatin structure. Mutations in SPT6 and particular mutations in histone genes are able to overcome transcriptional defects in strains lacking the Snf/Swi protein complex. Here it is shown that an spt6 mutation causes changes in chromatin structure in vivo. In addition, both in vivo and in vitro experiments provide evidence that Spt6p interacts directly with histones and primarily with histone H3. Consistent with these findings, Spt6p is capable of nucleosome assembly in vitro."

https://openalex.org/W1983019887,"The myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and MEF2 transcription factors are expressed in the myotome of developing somites and cooperatively activate skeletal muscle gene expression. The bHLH protein Twist is expressed throughout the epithelial somite and is subsequently excluded from the myotome. Ectopically expressed mouse Twist (Mtwist) was shown to inhibit myogenesis by blocking DNA binding by MyoD, by titrating E proteins, and by inhibiting trans-activation by MEF2. For inhibition of MEF2, Mtwist required heterodimerization with E proteins and an intact basic domain and carboxyl-terminus. Thus, Mtwist inhibits both families of myogenic regulators and may regulate myotome formation temporally or spatially."
https://openalex.org/W1987084599,"Somatic muscle is derived from a subset of embryonic mesoderm. In Drosophila, Twist (Twi), a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, is a candidate regulator of mesodermal differentiation and myogenesis. Altering amounts of Twist after gastrulation revealed that high levels of Twist are required for somatic myogenesis and block the formation of other mesodermal derivatives. Expression of twist in the ectoderm drives these cells into myogenesis. Thus, after an initial role in gastrulation, twist regulates mesodermal differentiation and propels a specific subset of mesodermal cells into somatic myogenesis. Vertebrate homologs of twist may also participate in the subdivision of mesoderm."
https://openalex.org/W1978834861,"The adenovirus E4orf6 protein is shown here to interact with the cellular tumor suppressor protein p53 and to block p53-mediated transcriptional activation. The adenovirus protein inhibited the ability of p53 to bind to human TAFII31, a component of transcription factor IID (TFIID). Earlier work demonstrated that the interaction of p53 with TAFII31 involves a sequence near the NH2-terminus of p53, whereas the E4orf6-p53 interaction occurs within amino acids 318 to 360 of p53. Thus, the E4orf6 protein interacts at a site on p53 distinct from the domain that binds to TAFII31 but nevertheless inhibits the p53-TAFII31 interaction."

https://openalex.org/W2013130041,"Molecular chaperones in the eukaryotic cytosol were shown to interact differently with chemically denatured proteins and their newly translated counterparts. During refolding from denaturant, actin partitioned freely between 70-kilodalton heat shock protein, the bulk cytosol, and the chaperonin TCP1-ring complex. In contrast, during cell-free translation, the chaperones were recruited to the elongating polypeptide and protected it from exposure to the bulk cytosol during folding. Posttranslational cycling between chaperone-bound and free states was observed with subunits of oligomeric proteins and with aberrant polypeptides; this cycling allowed the subunits to assemble and the aberrant polypeptides to be degraded. Thus, folding, oligomerization, and degradation are linked hierarchically to ensure the correct fate of newly synthesized polypeptides."

https://openalex.org/W2035920388,"Tyrosine kinases indirectly raise intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) by activating phospholipases that generate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 activates the IP3 receptor (IP3R), an intracellular calcium release channel on the endoplasmic reticulum. T cell receptor stimulation triggered a physical association between the nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase Fyn and the IP3R, which induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the IP3R. Fyn activated an IP3-gated calcium channel in vitro, and tyrosine phosphorylation of the IP3R during T cell activation was reduced in thymocytes from fyn-/- mice. Thus, activation of the IP3R by tyrosine phosphorylation may play a role in regulating [Ca2+]i."

https://openalex.org/W2004363016,"Unprotected receptive anal intercourse is a well-recognized risk factor for infection with human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1). Isolated human case reports have implicated HIV-1 transmission by oral-genital exposure. Adult macaques exposed nontraumatically to cell-free simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) through the oral route became infected and developed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The minimal virus dose needed to achieve systemic infection after oral exposure was 6000 times lower than the minimal dose required to achieve systemic infection after rectal exposure. Thus, unprotected receptive oral intercourse, even in the absence of mucosal lesions, should be added to the list of risk behaviors for HIV-1 transmission."
https://openalex.org/W1933030459,"Circulating levels of maternal erythropoietin (EPO) rise during gestation due to increased biosynthesis of the hormone. Our objective was to investigate the human placenta as a potential extrarenal site of EPO production. Using two monoclonal antibodies recognizing different antigenic determinants, we identified immunoreactive EPO associated with villous cytotrophoblast, endovascular and intravascular cytotrophoblast, cytotrophoblast cell columns, and syncytiotrophoblast of first and second-trimester placenta as well as syncytiotrophoblast and extravillous cytotrophoblast of normal third-trimester and preeclamptic placenta. In addition, cultured JAR (trophoblast-derived) choriocarcinoma cells, cytotrophoblasts isolated from term placenta, villous core cells, and possibly other nontrophoblast cells within the decidual basal plate expressed immunoreactive EPO. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and EPO-specific primers, a 378 bp DNA product was amplified from placental tissues of various gestational ages, cytotrophoblasts isolated from term placenta, and JAR choriocarcinoma cells. The amplified product yielded restriction enzyme fragments of predicted sizes. On Southern analysis, hybridization was observed for two of these fragments in which the radiolabeled EPO cDNA probe did not overlap with the primer sequences. Finally, the JAR choriocarcinoma cells elaborated EPO into the culture medium as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay and expressed EPO mRNA as determined by Northern analysis, both of which were stimulated by hypoxia (15-20 torr). Taken together, these results suggest a new site of EPO expression: the trophoblast cell of the human placenta."

https://openalex.org/W1993119809,"Far-infrared hydrogen recombination lines H15α (169.4 micrometers), H12α (88.8 micrometers), and H10α (52.5 micrometers) were detected in the peculiar luminous star MWC 349A from the Kuiper Airborne Observatory. Here it is shown that at least H15α is strongly amplified, with the probable amplification factor being greater than or about equal to 103 and a brightness temperature that is greater than or about equal to 107 kelvin. The other two lines also show signs of amplification, although to a lesser degree. Beyond H10α the amplification apparently vanishes. The newly detected amplified lines fall into the laser wavelength domain. These lasers, as well as the previously detected hydrogen masers, may originate in the photoionized circumstellar disk of MWC 349A and constrain the disk's physics and structure."

https://openalex.org/W1893741092,"Two animal models of the human dis-order hypophosphatémie vitamin D-resistant rickets exist, the Hyp and Gy mice. Affected mice and humane both manifest an X-linked phenotype, and show decreased Na+/Pi transport activity in the renal proximal tubules, which is characterized by a decreased maximal velocity (Vmax). The defect in Hypmice is most likely due to a decreased transcription rate of the regal Na+/Pi transporter gene. The cur-rent studies were designed to define the molecular defect in the Gy mice. Sodium-dependent uptake of phosphate (Pi) in renal BBMV showed uptake levels of 170.58 ± 25 and 66.00 ±11 pmoling protein−1 6 s−1 in normal and Gy mice, respectively (n=3, P=0.0102). Glucose uptake levels in the BBMV were 1.94 ±0.87 and 1.91 ±0.35 pmol·mg protein−1·6 s−1 in normal and Gy mice, respectively (n=3). Northern blot analysis of kidney cortex in both mice revealed nearly equivalent message levels (normal/Gy = 1.01 ± 0.12, n=3). In situ hybridization localized the mRNA to the renal cortex in both mice and confirmed equal message levels. Western blot analysis of renal BBM proteins, using a polyclonal antiserum, showed one predominant band at 87 kDa in both mouse samples, with intensities being de-creased in the Gy mice (normal/Gy=4.129 ± 0.70, n=4, P< 0.04). Immunohistochemical analysis localized the protein to the apical membrane of proximal tubules in both mice. These results suggest that the molecular defect in the Gy mice is distinct from that in the Hyp mice, and furthermore, that the manifestation of the diseased phenotype in Gy mice is related to a different defect in the renal Na+/Pi transporter expression pathway. The molecular mechanism of the defect likely relates to protein processing, metabolic turnover rate, or translocation to the brush-border membrane. These results further suggest that two distinct X-linked factors modulate different steps in the expression pathway of the Na+/Pi transporter gene.—Collins, J. F., Ghishan, F. K. The molecular defect in the renal sodium-phosphate transporter expression pathway of Gyro (Gy) mice is distinct from that of hypophosphatémie (Hyp) mice. FASEBJ. 10, 751-759 (1996)"
