To improve understanding of transcriptomic heterogeneity in glia during AD, we used single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to characterize astrocytes and oligodendrocytes from apolipoprotein (APOE) Ɛ2/3 human AD and age- and genotype-matched non-symptomatic (NS) brains. We enriched astrocytes before sequencing and characterized pathology from the same location as the sequenced material. We characterized baseline heterogeneity in both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes and identified global and subtype-specific transcriptomic changes between AD and NS astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. We also took advantage of recent human and mouse spatial transcriptomics resources to localize heterogeneous astrocyte subtypes to specific regions in the healthy and inflamed brain. Finally, we integrated our data with published AD snRNA-seq datasets, highlighting the power of combining datasets to resolve previously unidentifiable astrocyte subpopulations.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder in the world and accounts for about 70% of the 50 million people with dementia worldwide, with an estimated 10 million new cases every year, or close to 20 new cases every minute (Alzheimer's Association, 2021Alzheimer's Association2021 Alzheimer's disease facts and figures.Alzheimers Dement. 2021; 17: 327-406https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.12328Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). With an aging population, greater understanding of AD pathogenesis is imperative for the development of effective therapies. Defined by progressive memory and cognitive loss, AD is a disease of proteopathic stress associated with abnormal beta-amyloid (Aβ) and tau aggregation, and neuron death (De Strooper and Karran, 2016De Strooper B.

More recently, research highlights non-neuronal central nervous system (CNS) cells, namely glia, as active contributors to AD pathophysiology. Increasing evidence supports a pathological role of “reactive” astrocytes in acute and chronic diseases, such as AD (Carter et al., 2012Carter S.F. Schöll M. Almkvist O. Wall A. Engler H.

White matter (WM) abnormalities (e.g., lesions, decreased volume, and microstructural deterioration) and demyelination are well documented in AD (Lee et al., 2016Lee S. Viqar F. Zimmerman M.E.

Beyond these broad physiological changes, many questions remain, such as how subtypes of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes are altered in AD. Single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) has been used to assess cellular heterogeneity at the transcriptomic level in human AD postmortem brains (Del-Aguila et al., 2019Del-Aguila J.L. Li Z. Dube U.

In most studies, however, astrocytes are underrepresented, making up only ∼3%–18% of nuclei. Therefore, we posited that these studies may not provide large enough samples to confidently define biologically important, but lowly abundant, astrocyte subpopulations—a hypothesis supported by the fact that similar subpopulations are not identified across published datasets. In contrast, oligodendrocytes are well represented in snRNA-seq studies, with some agreement in identified subpopulations. In addition, given the important spatially confined responses of astrocytes to AD pathology (e.g., surrounding amyloid plaques or near-degenerated brain regions), no studies have combined pathological characterization with sequencing efforts on the same tissue samples. Several studies have provided pathological analysis of contralateral or adjacent brain regions, but these may be far-removed from local pathology-induced microenvironments (Gerrits et al., 2021Gerrits E.

A lack of concordance may also be reflective of variability with respect to pathological load and/or underlying genetic variance across donors. Here, we present a snRNA-seq dataset characterizing astrocytes and oligodendrocytes isolated from human postmortem prefrontal cortex samples from AD and age-matched non-symptomatic (NS) patients. All individuals were genotyped and controlled for apolipoprotein (APOE) genotype Ɛ2/3. We chose this patient population as it is underrepresented in other sequencing studies and individuals present with AD dementia onset at later ages (onset ∼80 years [Reiman et al., 2020Reiman E.M.

In addition, APOEƐ2/3 individuals have a low odd-risk ratio of contracting AD compared with individuals that carry an APOEƐ4 allele (Goldberg et al., 2020Goldberg T.E. Huey E.D. Devanand D.P. Association of APOE e2 genotype with Alzheimer's and non-Alzheimer's neurodegenerative pathologies.Nat.

In order to improve astrocyte capture for snRNA-seq, we enriched astrocytes by sorting nuclei based on LIM Homeobox 2 (LHX2)-positive/NeuN-negative staining followed by 10X-Genomics-based snRNA-seq. This method enriches astrocytes while maintaining capture rates of oligodendrocytes and depleting neurons. We characterized the pathology of donor tissue from the same location that nuclei were isolated for sequencing. We identified global and subtype-specific transcriptomic changes between AD and NS astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Additionally, we localized heterogeneous astrocyte subtypes to specific cortical regions in the healthy and inflamed brain using published human and mouse spatial transcriptomics datasets. Lastly, we integrated our data with published AD snRNA-seq datasets and resolved unique astrocyte subpopulations present across datasets. Overall, we provide a paired sequencing and pathology assessment resource that can be used to further explore the breadth of astrocyte and oligodendrocyte transcriptomic changes in AD. We first decided to reanalyze and compare three recent studies (Grubman et al., 2019Grubman A. Chew G. Ouyang J.F. Sun G. Choo X.Y. McLean C. Simmons R.K. Buckberry S. Vargas-Landin D.B. Poppe D. et al.A single-cell atlas of entorhinal cortex from individuals with Alzheimer's disease reveals cell-type-specific gene expression regulation.Nat.

Med. 2020; 26: 131-142https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-019-0695-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) and found that astrocytes made up on average 15% ± 8.7% of total nuclei captured (2,300–23,000 per study—on average less than 400 astrocytes per donor; Figures S1A–S1C; Table S1). Given that astrocytes are one of the most abundant CNS cell types (Nedergaard et al., 2003Nedergaard M. Ransom B. Goldman S.A. New roles for astrocytes: redefining the functional architecture of the brain.Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 523-530https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tins.2003.08.008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar; von Bartheld et al., 2016von Bartheld C.S.

Neurol. 2016; 524: 3865-3895https://doi.org/10.1002/cne.24040Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), this low capture rate was surprising. In contrast, other cell populations were well represented. In addition, donors varied in APOE genotype, which may confound resulting profiles of astrocytes, given they highly express APOE (Zhang et al., 2016Zhang Y. Sloan S.A. Clarke L.E. Caneda C. Plaza C.A. Blumenthal P.D. Vogel H. Steinberg G.K. Edwards M.S. Li G. et al.Purification and characterization of progenitor and mature human astrocytes reveals transcriptional and functional differences with mouse.Neuron. 2016; 89: 37-53https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2015.11.013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Therefore, we focused on APOE Ɛ2/3 donors, a population of patients that has been understudied. Our approach enabled us to (1) conduct a highly stringent evaluation of our donor cohort and (2) optimize enrichment methods for astrocytes prior to sequencing for improved astrocyte capture rates. We characterized our patient cohort by verifying APOE genotype (Figure S1D) and evaluating pathological load of donor tissue for Aβ (4G8), phosphorylated tau (AT8), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and Bielschowsky’s silver staining (Figure 1A; Table S2). Each stain was quantified for normalized staining density, total count of features (i.e., number of 4G8+ Aβ plaques or AT8+ cell bodies), and average cross-sectional area of each feature (Table S2). We evaluated diffuse plaques, neuritic plaques, and neurofibrillary tangle loads (Table S2). In line with clinical diagnoses, phosphorylated tau staining density and total number of AT8+ cell bodies were significantly higher in AD donors compared with NS donors (p = 0.0047). In contrast, we did not detect major differences in Aβ plaque staining density or area or GFAP+ staining density or area between disease conditions. Interestingly, individual AT8+ cell bodies were significantly larger in NS donors than in AD donors (p = 0.022)—likely driven by differences in the number of AT8+ cell bodies detected between disease conditions (AT8+ cell bodies counted: 141 NS versus 57,829 AD). Based on Bielschowsky’s silver staining, we classified NS donors as having no or low pathology loads, whereas AD donors had moderate or severe pathology loads. We next sought to improve astrocyte capture for snRNA-seq by enriching astrocytic nuclei prior to sequencing (Figure S2). Initially, we attempted astrocyte enrichment via SOX9 sorting (Figures S1E–S1G and S2A), given SOX9 is a transcription factor highly and uniquely expressed in astrocytes (Zhang et al., 2016Zhang Y. Sloan S.A. Clarke L.E. Caneda C. Plaza C.A. Blumenthal P.D. Vogel H. Steinberg G.K. Edwards M.S. Li G. et al.Purification and characterization of progenitor and mature human astrocytes reveals transcriptional and functional differences with mouse.Neuron. 2016; 89: 37-53https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2015.11.013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). However, this strategy proved ineffective in increasing astrocyte capture yields, likely due to non-specific SOX9 antibodies (Table S3). Instead, we turned to a dual immunolabeling strategy pioneered by Nott and colleagues (Nott et al., 2019Nott A. Holtman I.R. Coufal N.G. Schlachetzki J.C.M. Yu M. Hu R. Han C.Z. Pena M. Xiao J. Wu Y. et al.Brain cell type-specific enhancer-promoter interactome maps and disease-risk association.Science. 2019; 366: 1134-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) by sorting samples based on LHX2+NeuN− (Figures S1H–S1M and S2B; Table S3). Using this strategy, we enriched astrocytes, maintained oligodendrocyte numbers, and depleted neurons (Figures 1C–1G). While optimizing this process, we sorted a single donor using both sorting strategies, highlighting significant improvement in total astrocyte capture (Figures S1H–S1M). Overall, in our final donor cohort, 51.5% of nuclei captured were astrocytes, totaling 41,340 astrocytes and averaging 2,756 ± 1,087 astrocytes per donor (Figures 1E–1G). In addition, 29.7% of nuclei captured were oligodendrocytes, totaling 23,840 oligodendrocytes and averaging 1,589 ± 1,342 oligodendrocytes per donor (Figures 1E–1G). We identified five unique oligodendrocyte transcriptomically defined clusters (Figures 2A and 2B ) and evaluated these gene sets on their own and by gene ontology (GO)/pathway analysis (Table S4). We did not identify any singular sample variable, such as disease state, sex, RNA quality, age of donor, or postmortem interval (PMI), that was exclusively associated with a cluster (Figures 2C and S3). Although few genes were exclusively expressed by a single cluster, several were enriched in some clusters over others. Oligodendrocyte cluster 1, for example, was enriched for transcripts involved in glial cell development (PLP1, CNP, and CD9) and apoptotic signaling (SEPTIN4 and SERINC3). Oligodendrocyte cluster 2 was enriched for transcripts associated with cholesterol metabolism (MSMO1, FDFT1, and LSS). Oligodendrocyte clusters 2, 3, and 4 were enriched for transcripts involved in synapse assembly and organization. Additionally, oligodendrocyte cluster 4 expresses transcripts involved in antigen processing/presentation (PSMB1, B2M, and HLA-A) and innate-immunity-associated pathways, such as interleukin-1 signaling, tumor necrosis factor signaling, and NF-κB signaling. Finally, although we did not identify any statistically significant GO terms associated with oligodendrocyte cluster 0, based on cluster-enriched differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we inferred that this cluster was associated with synapse organization and aspects of metabolism (Table S3). We next evaluated differential gene expression between AD and NS oligodendrocytes using edgeR paired with zinbwave-generated observational weights. We identified 358 unique upregulated and 227 unique downregulated DEGs in AD oligodendrocytes (Table S4). We did not find any transcriptomic changes that were conserved/common across all oligodendrocyte subpopulations but instead found highly cluster-specific transcriptomic changes based on disease state (Figures 2D–2I). We next classified our findings by assigning “GO descriptions”—a manual evaluation of oligodendrocyte-cluster-specific or oligodendrocyte-cluster-shared GO terms. This allowed us to summarize multiple identified GO terms associated with either upregulated or downregulated pathways, for single or multiple oligodendrocyte clusters (Figures S4 and S5; Table S4). Oligodendrocyte “GO descriptions” associated with AD fell into two broad categories: upregulation of synaptic maintenance or downregulation of synaptic maintenance. For example, cluster 1 AD oligodendrocytes upregulate GO terms associated with axonogenesis and synapse organization (examples associated DEGs include LRP4, TIAM1, and CDH2). Decreases in synaptic cell adhesion protein N-cadherin (CDH2) have previously been reported in AD temporal cortex (Ando et al., 2011Ando K. Uemura K. Kuzuya A. Maesako M. Asada-Utsugi M. Kubota M. Aoyagi N. Yoshioka K. Okawa K. Inoue H. et al.N-cadherin regulates p38 MAPK signaling via association with JNK-associated leucine zipper protein: implications for neurodegeneration in Alzheimer disease.J. Biol.

Therefore, upregulation of CDH2 in this subpopulation of AD oligodendrocytes is an interesting discovery and may reflect a neuroprotective response to maintain contacts between axons and oligodendrocyte lineage cells (Schnädelbach et al., 2001Schnädelbach O. Ozen I. Blaschuk O.W. Meyer R.L. Fawcett J.W. N-cadherin is involved in axon-oligodendrocyte contact and myelination.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 1084-1093https://doi.org/10.1006/mcne.2001.0961Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Cluster 2 AD oligodendrocytes upregulate pathways related to cholesterol metabolism. Cholesterol is an essential component of myelin (Saher et al., 2011Saher G. Quintes S. Nave K.A. Cholesterol: a novel regulatory role in myelin formation.Neuroscientist. 2011; 17: 79-93https://doi.org/10.1177/1073858410373835Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), so identification of transcripts associated with cholesterol metabolism here (e.g., FMO5 and FDFT1) is not surprising. However, in the context of AD, upregulation of these transcripts in an oligodendrocyte subpopulation may suggest neurosupportive and/or neurotoxic effects (Guttenplan et al., 2021Guttenplan K.A. Weigel M.K. Prakash P. Wijewardhane P.R. Hasel P. Rufen-Blanchette U. Münch A.E. Blum J.A. Fine J.

For example, conditional knockdown of squalene synthase (FDFT1), a rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, significantly delays myelination in vivo (Saher et al., 2005Saher G. Brügger B.

https://openalex.org/W4226137169,"Cross-coupling between two similar or identical functional groups to form a new C-C bond is a powerful tool to rapidly assemble complex molecules from readily available building units, as seen with olefin cross-metathesis or various types of cross-electrophile coupling1,2. The Kolbe electrolysis involves the oxidative electrochemical decarboxylation of alkyl carboxylic acids to their corresponding radical species followed by recombination to generate a new C-C bond3-12. As one of the oldest known Csp3-Csp3 bond-forming reactions, it holds incredible promise for organic synthesis, yet its use has been almost non-existent. From the perspective of synthesis design, this transformation could allow one to agnostically execute syntheses without regard to polarity or neighbouring functionality just by coupling ubiquitous carboxylates13. In practice, this promise is undermined by the strongly oxidative electrolytic protocol used traditionally since the nineteenth century5, thereby severely limiting its scope. Here, we show how a mildly reductive Ni-electrocatalytic system can couple two different carboxylates by means of in situ generated redox-active esters, termed doubly decarboxylative cross-coupling. This operationally simple method can be used to heterocouple primary, secondary and even certain tertiary redox-active esters, thereby opening up a powerful new approach for synthesis. The reaction, which cannot be mimicked using stoichiometric metal reductants or photochemical conditions, tolerates a range of functional groups, is scalable and is used for the synthesis of 32 known compounds, reducing overall step counts by 73%."
https://openalex.org/W4225254138,"Argonaute proteins use single-stranded RNA or DNA guides to target complementary nucleic acids. This allows eukaryotic Argonaute proteins to mediate RNA interference and long prokaryotic Argonaute proteins to interfere with invading nucleic acids. The function and mechanisms of the phylogenetically distinct short prokaryotic Argonaute proteins remain poorly understood. We demonstrate that short prokaryotic Argonaute and the associated TIR-APAZ (SPARTA) proteins form heterodimeric complexes. Upon guide RNA-mediated target DNA binding, four SPARTA heterodimers form oligomers in which TIR domain-mediated NAD(P)ase activity is unleashed. When expressed in Escherichia coli, SPARTA is activated in the presence of highly transcribed multicopy plasmid DNA, which causes cell death through NAD(P)+ depletion. This results in the removal of plasmid-invaded cells from bacterial cultures. Furthermore, we show that SPARTA can be repurposed for the programmable detection of DNA sequences. In conclusion, our work identifies SPARTA as a prokaryotic immune system that reduces cell viability upon RNA-guided detection of invading DNA."

Here, we conducted a population-scale single-cell genomic analysis of skin and blood samples of 56 healthy controls and 97 SSc patients at different stages of the disease. We found immune compartment dysfunction only in a specific subtype of diffuse SSc patients but global dysregulation of the stromal compartment, particularly in a previously undefined subset of LGR5+-scleroderma-associated fibroblasts (ScAFs). ScAFs are perturbed morphologically and molecularly in SSc patients. Single-cell multiome profiling of stromal cells revealed ScAF-specific markers, pathways, regulatory elements, and transcription factors underlining disease development. Systematic analysis of these molecular features with clinical metadata associates specific ScAF targets with disease pathogenesis and SSc clinical traits. Our high-resolution atlas of the sclerodermatous skin spectrum will enable a paradigm shift in the understanding of SSc disease and facilitate the development of biomarkers and therapeutic strategies."

In the hippocampus, aberrant neurogenesis plays a critical role in the initiation and progression of epilepsy in rodent models, but it is unknown whether this also holds true in humans. To address this question, we used immunofluorescence on control healthy hippocampus and surgical resections from mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), plus neural stem-cell cultures and multi-electrode recordings of ex vivo hippocampal slices. We found that a longer duration of epilepsy is associated with a sharp decline in neuronal production and persistent numbers in astrogenesis. Further, immature neurons in MTLE are mostly inactive, and are not observed in cases with local epileptiform-like activity. However, immature astroglia are present in every MTLE case and their location and activity are dependent on epileptiform-like activity. Immature astroglia, rather than newborn neurons, therefore represent a potential target to continually modulate adult human neuronal hyperactivity."

Thus, the need for an effective, novel approach to diagnosing, preventing, and treating COVID-19 infections became paramount. Methods This article proposes a machine learning-based method for the classification of chest X-ray images. We also examined some of the pre-processing methods such as thresholding, blurring, and histogram equalization. Results We found the F1-score results rose to 97%, 96%, and 99% for the three analyzed classes: healthy, COVID-19, and pneumonia, respectively. Conclusion Our research provides proof that machine learning can be used to support medics in chest X-ray classification and improving pre-processing leads to improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores."
https://openalex.org/W4226140670,"The hippocampus is implicated in memory formation, and neurons in the hippocampus take part in replay sequences that have been proposed to reflect memory of explored space. By recording from large ensembles of hippocampal neurons as rats explored various tracks, we show that sustained replay appears after a single experience. Further, we found that with repeated experience in a novel environment, replay slows down, taking more time to traverse the same trajectory. This effect was dependent on experience, not passage of time, and was environment specific. By investigating the slow-gamma (25–50 Hz) hover-and-jump dynamics within replays, we show that replay slows by adding more hover locations, increasing the resolution of the behavioral trajectory. We provide evidence that inhibition and cortical engagement both increase as replay slows. Thus, replays can reflect single experiences and evolve with re-exposure, in a manner consistent with the encoding of greater detail into replay memories with experience."

The anti-N seropositive rate were 2.1% and 3.9% in August and December 2021, respectively, demonstrating a Delta variant endemic during that time; it was approximately twofold higher than the rate based on the PCR-based diagnosis. The anti-S seropositive rate was 38.7% in August and it reached 90.8% in December, in concordance with the vaccination rate in Japan. In the December cohort, 78.7% of the sera showed neutralizing activity against the Delta variant, whereas that against the Omicron was much lower at 36.6%. These analyses revealed that effective immunity against the Delta variant was established in December 2021, however, prompt three-dose vaccination is needed to overcome Omicron’s outbreak."
https://openalex.org/W4226374033,"Young adults are currently the loneliest demographic in the UK and other Western countries, yet little is known about how they see the causes of their loneliness. Thus, the objective of this study is to explore the subjective causes of loneliness among young adults (18-24 years old), particularly those of lower socio-economic status (SES) who are in employment, renting and living in the most deprived areas, since they are the loneliest in the UK. Utilising a free association technique and thematic analysis, and embedded in a phenomenological framework, the subjective causes of loneliness in a matched sample of 48 young adults in the four most deprived boroughs of London are found to cluster around five themes: The Feeling of Being Disconnected, Contemporary Culture, Pressure, Social Comparison and Transitions Between Life Stages. Disconnection arises from feeling one does not matter, is not understood or is unable to express oneself. Challenges pertaining to social media and materialism in contemporary culture contribute to loneliness as does pressure associated with work, fitting in and social comparison. Social media play a major role in exacerbating these experiences. Finally, transitions between life stages such as breakups, loss of significant others and transitory stages to do with education and employment are felt to cause loneliness. The findings suggest potential avenues for loneliness reduction."

https://openalex.org/W4225832375,"The study aimed to recover diarrheagenic Escherichia coli strains from processed ready-to-eat (RTE) foods in Yenagoa, Nigeria and characterize them using culture-based and molecular methods. Three hundred RTE food samples were collected randomly from different food outlets between February 2021 and August 2021 and assessed for the occurrence of E . coli using standard bacteriological procedures. The virulence factor formation and antibiotic susceptibility profile of the isolates was carried out using standard microbiological procedures. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to confirm the identity of the isolates via specific primers and further used to assay the diarrheagenic determinants of the E . coli isolates. The prevalence of E . coli positive samples based on the proliferation of E . coli on Chromocult coliform agar forming purple to violet colonies was 80(26.7%). The population density of E . coli from the RTE foods ranged from 0–4.3 × 10 4 ± 1.47 CFU/g. The recovered E . coli isolates ( n = 62) were resistant to antibiotics in different proportions such as ampicillin 62(100%), aztreonam 47(75.81%) and chloramphenicol 43(69.35%). All the recovered E . coli isolates were resistant to ≥ 2 antibiotics. The multiple antibiotic-resistant index (MARI) ranged from 0.13–0.94 with 47(75.8%) of isolates having MARI &gt;2. A total of 48(77.4%) of the isolates were multidrug-resistant (MDR). The proportion of extracellular virulence factor formation is as follows: protease 12(19.35%), curli 39(62.9%), cellulose 21(33.89%), ornithine decarboxylase 19(30.65%) and aesculin hydrolysis 14(22.58%). The overall proportion of diarrheagenic E . coli was 33/62(53.2%). The distributions of typical diarrheagenic E . coli includes: tETEC 9(14.5%), tEPEC 13(20.9%), tEAEC 6(9.7%), tEIEC 2(3.2%) and tEHEC 3(4.8%). The proportions of atypical strains include aETEC 10(16.1%), aEAEC 5(8.1%), aEPEC 1(1.6%) and aEIEC 3(4.8%).

https://openalex.org/W4226271935,"Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) causes Johne’s disease in animals with zoonotic potential; it has been linked to many chronic diseases in humans, especially gastrointestinal diseases (GID). MAP has been extensively studied in Europe and America, but little reports were published from Africa. Sudan is a unique country with close contact between humans and livestock. Despite such interaction, the one health concept is neglected in dealing with cases of humans with GID. In this study, patients admitted to the reference GID hospital in the Sudan over a period of 8 months were screened for presence of MAP in their faeces or colonic biopsies. A total of 86 patients were recruited for this study, but only 67 were screened for MAP, as 19 did not provide the necessary samples for analysis. Both real-time PCR and culture were used to detect MAP in the collected samples and the microbial diversity in patients´ faecal samples was investigated using 16S rDNA nanopore sequencing. In total, 27 (40.3%) patients were MAP positive: they were 15 males and 12 females, of ages between 21 and 80 years. Logistic regression analysis revealed no statistical significance for all tested variables in MAP positive patients (occupation, gender, contact with animal, milk consumption, chronic disease, etc.). A unique microbiome profile of MAP-positive patients in comparison to MAP-negative was found. These findings suggest that a considerable proportion of the population could be MAP infected or carriers. Therefore, increase awareness at community level is urgently needed to decrease the risk of MAP at human/animal interface. This study represents the first report of MAP in humans in the Sudan; nevertheless, a better view of the situation of MAP in humans in the country requires a larger study including patients with other conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4226317078,"Review, promotion, and tenure (RPT) processes at universities typically assess candidates along three dimensions: research, teaching, and service. In recent years, some have argued for the inclusion of a controversial fourth criterion: collegiality. While collegiality plays a role in the morale and effectiveness of academic departments, it is amorphic and difficult to assess, and could be misused to stifle dissent or enforce homogeneity. Despite this, some institutions have opted to include this additional element in their RPT documents and processes, but it is unknown the extent of this practice and how it varies across institution type and disciplinary units. This study is based on two sets of data: survey data collected as part of a project that explored the publishing decisions of faculty and how these related to perceived importance in RPT processes, and 864 RPT documents collected from 129 universities from the United States and Canada. We analysed these RPT documents to determine the degree to which collegiality and related terms are mentioned, if they are defined, and if and how they may be assessed during the RPT process. Results show that when collegiality and related terms appear in these documents they are most often just briefly mentioned . It is less common for collegiality and related terms to be defined or assessed in RPT documents. Although the terms are mentioned across all types of institutions, there is a statistically significant difference in how prevalent they are at each. Collegiality is more commonly mentioned in the documents of doctoral research-focused universities (60%), than of master’s universities and colleges (31%) or baccalaureate colleges (15%). Results from the accompanying survey of faculty also support this finding: individuals from R-Types were more likely to perceive collegiality to be a factor in their RPT processes. We conclude that collegiality likely plays an important role in RPT processes, whether it is explicitly acknowledged in policies and guidelines or not, and point to several strategies in how it might be best incorporated in the assessment of academic careers."
https://openalex.org/W4223471616,"As aortic valve stenosis develops, valve tissue becomes stiffer. In response to this change in environmental mechanical stiffness, valvular interstitial cells (VICs) activate into myofibroblasts. We aimed to investigate the role of mechanosensitive calcium channel Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid type 4 (TRPV4) in stiffness induced myofibroblast activation. We verified TRPV4 functionality in VICs using live calcium imaging during application of small molecule modulators of TRPV4 activity. We designed hydrogel biomaterials that mimic mechanical features of healthy or diseased valve tissue microenvironments, respectively, to investigate the role of TRPV4 in myofibroblast activation and proliferation. Our results show that TRPV4 regulates VIC proliferation in a microenvironment stiffness-independent manner. While there was a trend toward inhibiting myofibroblast activation on soft microenvironments during TRPV4 inhibition, we observed near complete deactivation of myofibroblasts on stiff microenvironments. We further identified Yes-activated protein (YAP) as a downstream target for TRPV4 activity on stiff microenvironments. Mechanosensitive TRPV4 channels regulate VIC myofibroblast activation, whereas proliferation regulation is independent of the microenvironmental stiffness. Collectively, the data suggests differential regulation of stiffness-induced proliferation and myofibroblast activation. Our data further suggest a regulatory role for TRPV4 regarding YAP nuclear localization. TRPV4 is an important regulator for VIC myofibroblast activation, which is linked to the initiation of valve fibrosis. Although more validation studies are necessary, we suggest TRPV4 as a promising pharmaceutical target to slow aortic valve stenosis progression."

Current research strategies to determine which drug combinations have a synergistic effect rely mainly on clinical or empirical experience and screening predefined pools of drugs. Given the number of possible drug combinations, the speed, and scope to find new drug combinations are very limited using these methods. Due to the exponential growth in the number of drug combinations, it is difficult to test all possible combinations in the lab. There are several large-scale public genomic and phenotypic resources that provide data from single drug-treated cells as well as data from small molecule treated cells. These databases provide a wealth of information regarding cellular responses to drugs and offer an opportunity to overcome the limitations of the current methods. Developing a new advanced data processing and analysis strategy is imperative and a computational prediction algorithm is highly desirable. In this paper, we developed a computational algorithm for the enrichment of synergistic drug combinations using gene regulatory network knowledge and an operational module unit (OMU) system which we generate from single drug genomic and phenotypic data. As a proof of principle, we applied the pipeline to a group of anticancer drugs and demonstrate how the algorithm could help researchers efficiently find possible synergistic drug combinations using single drug data to evaluate all possible drug pairs."
https://openalex.org/W4226176427,"Effective migration often requires supports for new arrivals, referred to as settlement services. Settlement services literacy (SSL) is key to ensuring new migrants have the capability to access and utilise the information and services designed to support the resettlement process and achieve positive settlement outcomes. To date, however, no research has sought to empirically validate measures of SSL or to assess individual migrants' levels of SSL. The aim of this study was to establish the psychometric properties of constructs from the conceptual SSL framework.Using a snowball sampling approach, trained multilingual research assistants collected data on 653 participants. The total sample was randomly divided into two split-half samples: one for the exploratory factor analysis (EFA; N = 324) and the other for the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA; N = 329) and scale validation. The final SSL scale included 30 questions. The full data set was used to test the nomological validity of the scale regarding whether the components of SSL impact on migrants' level of acculturative stress.The EFA yielded five factors: knowledge (eight items, α = 0.88), empowerment (five items, α = 0.89), competence (four items, α = 0.86), community influence (four items, α = 0.82), and political (two items, α = 0.81). In the CFA, the initial model demonstrated a poor to marginal fit model. Its re-specification by examining modification indices resulted in a good model fit: CMIN/DF = 3.07, comparative fit index = 0.92, root mean square error of approximation = 0.08 and standardised root mean square residual = 0.07, which are consistent with recommendations. All the path coefficients between the second-order construct (SSL) and its five dimensions (knowledge, empowerment, competence, community influence and political) were significant at an α = .05 level, giving evidence for the validity of different SSL dimensions. We found that SSL is significantly related to migrants' acculturative stress (β = - 0.39, p < 0.05) in the nomological model.The study provides evidence of the construct validity and reliability of the SSL tool. It provides the basis for integrating the measures of SSL into evaluation of settlement services. This will allow for more effective decision-making in designing and implementing settlement services as well as funding and service agreements to address any deficiencies."

Although the species is known as carnivorous, data on basic ecology, including habitat selection and primary diet items, are limited owing to its relative rarity and difficulty in capturing the species. Leveraging advances in DNA metabarcoding and using radio-telemetry, we present novel information on the diet and movement of V. spectrum based on locations of a radio-collared individual and fecal samples collected from its communal roost (three individuals) in the Lowland Dry Forest of southern Nicaragua. Using a non-invasive approach, we explored the diet of the species with genetic markers designed to capture a range of arthropods and vertebrate targets from fecal samples. We identified 27 species of vertebrate prey which included birds, rodents, and other bat species. Our evidence suggested that V. spectrum can forage on a variety of species, from those associated with mature forests to forest edge-dwellers. Characteristics of the roost and our telemetry data underscore the importance of large trees for roosting in mature forest patches for the species. These data can inform conservation efforts for preserving both the habitat and the prey items in remnants of mature forest required by Vampyrum spectrum to survive in landscape mosaics."
https://openalex.org/W4225830828,"We describe a trackway (LH-Mg-10-16) occurring in laminated carbonated limestones of the Las Hoyas locality, Serranía de Cuenca, Spain. It is unmistakably a large theropod dinosaur trackway encompassing two unusual aspects, namely, wide-steps, and a set of equally deformed left footprints (with a dislocated digit). The layer also preserves other vertebrate trails (fish Undichna) and different impressions in the sediment. To address these complex settings, we devised a multidisciplinary approach, including the ichnological and taphonomical descriptions, characterisation of the rock lithofacies using thin-sections, 3D structured-light digitalisation with a high precision of 200-400 μm, and a geometric morphometric comparison with a large sample of bipedal dinosaur trackways. Sedimentary analyses showed that the trackway was produced in a humid, benthonic microbial mat, the consistency and plasticity of which enabled the preservation of the details of the movement of the animal. The results of the geometric analysis indicate that the ""wide-steps"" of the trackway is not unusual compared to other trackways, providing evidence that it was made by a single individual with an estimated hip height approximately 2 m. Analogous pathologies in extant archosaurs that yield the combination of wide steps and deformed digits in the same trackway were considered. All results mutually support the hypothesis that a large theropod dinosaur, with a pathological foot, generated the trackway as it crossed an area of shallow water while slowly walking towards the main water source, thus stepping steadily over the benthonic mat over which multiple fish were swimming."

To measure how lockdown impacted nutritional practices in this cohort, three-day photograph food diaries were analysed at three time points: before (January), during (April), and after (September) the first UK lockdown. Thirteen swimmers (aged 15 ± 1 years) from a high-performance swimming club submitted satisfactory food diaries at all time points. During lockdown, lower amounts of energy (45.3 ± 9.8 vs. 31.1 ± 7.7 kcal∙kg BM∙day-1, p<0.001), carbohydrate (5.4 ± 1.2 vs. 3.5 ± 1.1 g∙kg BM∙day-1, p<0.001), protein (2.3 ± 0.4 vs. 1.7 ± 0.4 g∙kg BM∙day-1, p = 0.002), and fat (1.6 ± 0.4 vs. 1.1 ± 0.3 g∙kg BM∙day-1, p = 0.011) were reported. After lockdown, no nutritional differences were found in comparison compared to before lockdown (energy: 44.0 ± 12.1 kcal∙kg BM∙day-1; carbohydrate: 5.4 ± 1.4 g∙kg BM∙day-1; protein: 2.1 ± 0.6 g∙kg BM∙day-1; fat: 1.5 ± 0.6 g ∙kg BM∙day-1, all p>0.05), despite fewer training hours being completed (15.0 ± 1.4 vs. 19.1 ± 2.2 h∙week-1, p<0.001). These findings highlight the ability of adolescent swimmers to alter their nutrition based on their changing training circumstances when receiving sport nutrition support. However, some individuals displayed signs of suboptimal nutrition during lockdown that were not corrected once training resumed. This warrants future research to develop interactive education workshops that maintain focus and motivation towards optimal nutrition practices in isolated periods away from training."

The sacrum is thought to reflect this dimorphism as it makes up a significant portion of the pelvic girdle. However, reported sexual classification accuracies vary considerably depending on the method and reference sample (54%-98%). We aim to explore this inconsistency by quantifying sexual dimorphism and sex classification accuracies in a geographically heterogeneous sample by comparing 3D geometric morphometrics with the more commonly employed linear metric and qualitative assessments. Our sample included 164 modern humans from Africa, Europe, Asia, and America. The geometric morphometric analysis was based on 44 landmarks and 56 semilandmarks. Linear dimensions included sacral width, corpus depth and width, and the corresponding indices. The qualitative inspection relied on traditional macroscopic features such as proportions between the corpus of the first sacral vertebrae and the alae, and sagittal and coronal curvature of the sacrum. Classification accuracy was determined using linear discriminant function analysis for the entire sample and for the largest subsamples (i.e., Europeans and Africans). Male and female sacral shapes extensively overlapped in the geometric morphometric investigation, leading to a classification accuracy of 72%. Anteroposterior corpus depth was the most powerful discriminating linear parameter (83%), followed by the corpus-area index (78%). Qualitative inspection yielded lower accuracies (64–76%). Classification accuracy was higher for the Central European subsample and diminished with increasing geographical heterogeneity of the subgroups. Although the sacrum forms an integral part of the birth canal, our results suggest that its sex-related variation is surprisingly low. Morphological variation thus seems to be driven also by other factors, including body size, and sacrum shape is therefore likely under stronger biomechanical rather than obstetric selection."
https://openalex.org/W4226187817,"This study aimed to analyze the factors of rapid attenuation of graft endothelium in the early stage after penetrating keratoplasty (PKP), with a view to guiding patients with PKP to better long-term outcomes. This study included 226 patients who underwent PKP with follow-up time >1 year at the Qingdao Eye Hospital of Shandong First Medical University from January 2018 to June 2020. Medical records were retrospectively studied, and donor factors, patient factors, and surgical factors were comparatively analyzed to clarify those affecting the rapid decay of graft endothelium after PKP. The median time between excision and death >60 min and patient age >60 years were risk factors for endothelial cell loss (ECL) rate >30% at 1 month postoperatively. However, a higher percentage of patients with donor age ≤60 years and Optisol preservation solution had endothelial cell density (ECD) >2000 cells/mm2 in the graft at postoperative 1 year. A year after the surgery, patients with corneal endothelial decompensation and immune rejection were at risk for ECD < 1000 cells/mm2. The combined operations had a significant effect on the ECL in the early postoperative period. Patients who underwent combined extracapsular cataract extraction or intraocular lens implantation had a significantly higher rate of ECL at postoperative 1 month than other patients, and no significant effect at postoperative 1 year. However, patients without combined operations have a higher probability of maintaining a high level of graft ECD. The graft diameter also affected postoperative ECL. In patients with a larger graft diameter, attenuation of ECD was slower. The ultimate goal of PKP is to maintain graft transparency for extended periods. The use of younger donors, minimizing unnecessary operation in the anterior chamber, and minimizing immune rejection may maintain a greater donor corneal endothelium in the long term."
https://openalex.org/W4226411859,"Objective Our aim is to determine the strong predictors of the onset of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) decline in community-dwelling older people. Design A prospective cohort study with a two-year follow-up. Setting Kashiwa City, Chiba Prefecture, Japan and Toshima Ward, Tokyo Metropolitan, Japan. Participants The data were acquired from two cohorts. The final sample comprised 1,523 community-dwelling older people aged 65–94 years (681 men, 842 women). They were individuals who were independent in IADL at baseline and participated in follow-up IADL assessments two years later. Measurements At baseline, comprehensive assessments were performed including: health interview, gait function, hand-grip strength, skeletal muscle mass, balance function, oral function, dietary lifestyle, cognitive function, quality of life, mental status, and social network. When the two-year follow-up was performed, IADL declines were observed in 53 out of 1,523 people. The association of each Z-transformed parameter with the occurrence of IADL decline was examined by employing a binominal logistic regression model adjusting for age, gender, body weight, body height, and medical history. An odds ratio (OR) and a 95% confidence interval were calculated and compared between different parameters. Results A decrease in walking speed and one-legged stance time, whereas an increased timed up &amp; go test time was associated with significant ORs for the occurrence of IADL decline. Conclusion Gait-related parameters appear to be the strong predictors of the onset of IADL decline in community-dwelling older people."
https://openalex.org/W4225588061,"Background Our objective was to assess differences in TB treatment outcomes between individuals who were HIV negative, HIV positive on anti-retroviral treatment (ART) and HIV positive not on ART, at TB treatment initiation at a rural district hospital in Eastern Cape, South Africa. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of individuals diagnosed with TB between January 2017 and April 2020 at a district hospital. Adults 15 years and over with reported HIV status and treatment outcome were included (N = 711). A categorical outcome with three levels was considered: unfavorable, down referral, and success. We report descriptive statistics for the association between HIV and ART status and treatment outcome using Chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests. A multinomial baseline logit model was used to estimate odds ratios for treatment outcomes. Results Overall, 59% of included patients were HIV positive with 75% on ART. Eighty-eight patients 12% had an unfavorable outcome. Half of all patients were down referred with an additional 37% having a successful outcome. Individuals without HIV were more likely to be down referred (versus unfavorable) compared to individuals with untreated HIV (2.90 OR, 1.36, 6.17 95% CI). There was a greater likelihood for individuals without HIV having a successful TB treatment outcome compared to individuals with untreated HIV (4.98 OR, 2.07, 11.25 95% CI). Conclusion The majority of individuals had positive TB treatment outcomes (down referred or success). However, people without HIV had nearly five times greater odds of having successful outcomes than those with untreated HIV."
https://openalex.org/W4225640095,"Forest ecosystems are crucial to the survival and development of human societies. Urbanization is expected to impact forest landscape patterns and consequently the supply of forest ecosystem services. However, the specific ways by which such impacts manifest are unclear. Therefore, to discuss the relationship between them is of great significance for realizing regional sustainable development. Here, we quantitatively assess the intensity of forest ecosystem service functions and forest landscape patterns in Renqiu City of China’s Hebei Province in 2019 using ArcGIS and FRAGSTATS. We characterize the relationships between forest ecosystem service capacity and landscape patterns, and identify strategies for the spatial optimization of forests. We find that the ecosystem service intensity of forests are significantly correlated with their spatial distribution, forest area ratio, and landscape patterns. Specifically, the percentage of landscape (PLAND) index, landscape shape index (LSI), and contagion (CONTAG) index indices display second-order polynomial relationships with various forest ecosystem service functions, with critical values of 80, 5, and 70, respectively. We propose that forest ecosystem functions can be optimized by optimizing forest landscape patterns. Specifically, to maximize the function of forest ecosystem services, managers should consider the integrity of forest ecosystems, optimize their ability to self-succession, repair service functions of key nodes within forests, enhance forests’ structural stability, optimize forest quality and community structure, and strengthen the efficiency of functional transformation per unit area. Finally, we propose a strategy for the spatial optimization of forests in Renqiu to optimize their associated ecosystem services. This involves protecting important areas for forest ecosystems, rationally organizing different ecological patches such as forests and water bodies to maximize their functions, strengthening the connectivity of scattered forests, and supplementing woodland areas."
https://openalex.org/W4225808828,"In order to facilitate hydrological restoration, initiatives have been conducted to promote tree growth in degraded and rewetted peatlands in Indonesia. For these initiatives to be successful, tree seedlings need to be able to survive flooding episodes, with or without shade. We investigated the survival rates and the formation of adventitious roots in the case of four tree species exposed to combinations of different shading and water levels under controlled conditions in a nursery, with artificial rainwater and with peat soil as the medium. The research focused on the following questions (i) whether trees can grow on flooded peat soils; and (ii) which plant traits allow plants to cope with inundation, with or without shade. The four tree species compared ( Shorea balangeran , Cratoxylum arborescens , Nephelium lappaceum and Durio zibethinus ) include two natural pioneer and two farmer-preferred fruit trees. The experiment used a split-split plot design with 48 treatment combinations and at least 13 tree-level replicates. The study found that S . balangeran and C. arborescens had relatively high survival rates and tolerated saturated condition for 13 weeks, while N . lappaceum and D . zibethinus required non-saturated peat conditions. S . balangeran and C. arborescens developed adventitious roots to adapt to the inundated conditions. D . zibethinus , S . balangeran and N . lappaceum grew best under moderate (30%) shading levels, while C . arborescent grew best in full sunlight."
https://openalex.org/W4225829532,"The respiratory tract has a resident microbiome with low biomass and limited diversity. This results in difficulties with sample preparation for sequencing due to uneven bacteria-to-host DNA ratio, especially for small tissue samples such as mouse lungs. We compared effectiveness of current procedures used for DNA extraction in microbiome studies. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue samples were collected to test different forms of sample pre-treatment and extraction methods to increase bacterial DNA yield and optimize library preparation. DNA extraction using a pre-treatment method of mechanical lysis (lung tissue) and one-step centrifugation (BALF) increased DNA yield and bacterial content of samples. In contrast, a significant increase of environmental contamination was detected after phenol chloroform isoamyl alcohol (PCI) extraction and nested PCR. While PCI has been a standard procedure used in microbiome studies, our data suggests that it is not efficient for DNA extraction of frozen low biomass samples. Finally, a DNA Enrichment kit was tested and found to improve the 16S copy number of lung tissue with a minor shift in microbial composition. Overall, we present a standardized method to provide high yielding DNA and improve sequencing coverage of low microbial biomass frozen samples with minimal contamination."
https://openalex.org/W4225849231,"Purpose Cancer is among the leading causes of death in the developed world, and lung cancer is the most lethal type. Early detection is crucial for better prognosis, but can be resource intensive to achieve. Automating tasks such as lung tumor localization and segmentation in radiological images can free valuable time for radiologists and other clinical personnel. Convolutional neural networks may be suited for such tasks, but require substantial amounts of labeled data to train. Obtaining labeled data is a challenge, especially in the medical domain. Methods This paper investigates the use of a teacher-student design to utilize datasets with different types of supervision to train an automatic model performing pulmonary tumor segmentation on computed tomography images. The framework consists of two models: the student that performs end-to-end automatic tumor segmentation and the teacher that supplies the student additional pseudo-annotated data during training. Results Using only a small proportion of semantically labeled data and a large number of bounding box annotated data, we achieved competitive performance using a teacher-student design. Models trained on larger amounts of semantic annotations did not perform better than those trained on teacher-annotated data. Our model trained on a small number of semantically labeled data achieved a mean dice similarity coefficient of 71.0 on the MSD Lung dataset. Conclusions Our results demonstrate the potential of utilizing teacher-student designs to reduce the annotation load, as less supervised annotation schemes may be performed, without any real degradation in segmentation accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W4225922641,"Background Hydrocodone and oxycodone are prescribed commonly to treat pain. However, differences in risk of opioid-related adverse outcomes after an initial prescription are unknown. This study aims to determine the risk of opioid-related adverse events, defined as either chronic use or opioid overdose, following a first prescription of hydrocodone or oxycodone to opioid naïve patients. Methods A retrospective analysis of multiple linked public health datasets in the state of Oregon. Adult patients ages 18 and older who a) received an initial prescription for oxycodone or hydrocodone between 2015–2017 and b) had no opioid prescriptions or opioid-related hospitalizations or emergency department visits in the year preceding the prescription were followed through the end of 2018. First-year chronic opioid use was defined as ≥6 opioid prescriptions (including index) and average ≤30 days uncovered between prescriptions. Fatal or non-fatal opioid overdose was indicated from insurance claims, hospital discharge data or vital records. Results After index prescription, 2.8% (n = 14,458) of individuals developed chronic use and 0.3% (n = 1,480) experienced overdose. After adjustment for patient and index prescription characteristics, patients receiving oxycodone had lower odds of developing chronic use relative to patients receiving hydrocodone (adjusted odds ratio = 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91–1.00) but a higher risk of overdose (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.65, 95% CI 1.45–1.87). Oxycodone monotherapy appears to greatly increase the hazard of opioid overdose (aHR 2.18, 95% CI 1.86–2.57) compared with hydrocodone with acetaminophen. Oxycodone combined with acetaminophen also shows a significant increase (aHR 1.26, 95% CI 1.06–1.50), but not to the same extent. Conclusions Among previously opioid-naïve patients, the risk of developing chronic use was slightly higher with hydrocodone, whereas the risk of overdose was higher after oxycodone, in combination with acetaminophen or monotherapy. With a goal of reducing overdose-related deaths, hydrocodone may be the favorable agent."
https://openalex.org/W4226042714,"Background Appropriate maxillofacial growth and development evaluation is important for effective orthodontic treatment. Growth evaluation is based on physiological age determined by individual development, but not chronological age. One strategy for determining physiological age is using the cervical vertebral bone age. Objectives This study aimed to clarify the standard size of the upper and lower jawbones in Japanese patients using the cervical vertebral maturation stages (CVMS) as an index and clarify the growth pattern. And to use the cervical spine age as a diagnostic aid in orthodontic treatment. Material and methods Random sampling was performed from the outpatients who visited the Orthodontics department, Tokyo Medical and Dental University Dental Hospital, and 400 patients were enrolled before treatment. Lateral cephalometric radiographs were obtained to measure the height and length of the mandible and the maxilla length with cephalometric analysis. Standard values were calculated for each cervical-spine-age group to analyze changes during mandibular and maxillary growth. Furthermore, we compared the differences between males and females. The Kruskal–Wallis test was used to compare cervical-spine-age groups, and the Steel–Dwass test was used for multiple comparisons. The reliability of CVMS was confirmed by calculating the weighted kappa coefficient (κ). Results κ for the degree of intra-evaluator agreement and the degree of the inter-evaluator agreement were calculated, and both indicated almost perfect agreement. We found that the distance between the anterior nasal spine (ANS) and posterior nasal spine (PNS) (i.e., ANS–PNS) increased significantly between CVMS II and CVMS III in males. The distance between Articulare (Ar) and Gonion (Go) (i.e., Ar–Go) and the distance between Go and Pogonion (Pog) (i.e., Go–Pog) increased significantly between CVMS III and CVMS IV in males. Conclusion The findings suggested that CVMS is a reliable indicator of the growth stage of the maxilla and mandible."
https://openalex.org/W4226151440,"In our previous study, an L1-based human papillomavirus (HPV) test using liquid-based cytology revealed that some invasive cervical cancers (ICC) exhibited multiple HPV types or harbored no HPV DNA. Here, molecular mapping of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cancer tissue specimens from the same patients were conducted to confirm these observations. Among 377 ICC cases, 73 eligible specimens (9 positive for multiple HPV types, 16 negative for HPV, and 48 positive for a single HPV type from the previous study) were reexamined by manual microdissection of cancer lesions, then subjected to HPV genotyping using the uniplex E6/E7 polymerase-chain-reaction method to detect all high-risk and potentially high-risk HPV types. The HPV typing results were confirmed in 52 of 73 cancer cases; among the 21 remaining cases, 15 were discordant and 6 were partially concordant. In total, 8 of 16 (50%) HPV-negative samples became positive; 6 were positive for HPV16 and 2 were positive for HPV67. Moreover, two samples previously positive for HPV6 and HPV53 were negative for HPV. All nine cancers with multiple HPV types were found to harbor only a single HPV type. In total, 63 cancer tissues exhibited a single HPV type. HPV16 and HPV18 were detected in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (ADC). Alpha-5 (HPV82), -6 (HPV56), and -9 (HPV31/52/67) HPV types were detected in SCC, whereas Alpha-7 (HPV59/68) types were detected in ADC and adenosquamous carcinoma (ADSCC). These findings suggested that the different HPV types induced different histological cancers. Furthermore, all SCCs and 10 of 11 usual-type ADCs were positive for high-risk HPV types, supporting the use of HPV screening for the detection of these cancers and associated premalignant lesions. HPV16 is likely to remain undetected in some cervical cancer tissues because of low viral-copy-numbers. Putative high-risk HPV types (e.g., HPV67 and HPV82) might be high risk in Japan."

The purpose of this study was therefore to analyze the external load, eTL, in the tasks designed by physical education teachers from the in-service and pre-service stages, for teaching handball in primary education, and to compare them with the tasks included in the lesson plans designed for handball using the tactical games teaching model. An associative, comparative and cross-sectional methodology was used. Twenty-three teachers, five in the in-service phase and eighteen in the pre-service phase, designed lesson plans for teaching handball, which were compared with lesson plans validated by a panel of experts. The analysis was performed on 1,232 tasks or analysis units. eTL was categorized using the Integrated analysis system of training tasks (SIATE) instrument. A descriptive and associative analysis was made of the variables that make up the eTL and an inferential analysis of the eTL using non-parametric tests. The total eTL of the tasks planned by the in-service and pre-service teachers was low, and significantly lower than the tasks planned using the tactical games model, which showed a high level."

Data are presented for naming latency, image agreement, picture-name agreement, familiarity, visual complexity, and age of acquisition (AoA). Sixty-eight native Kannada speaking adults completed all tasks. The effects of the rated variables on naming latency were examined and compared with data on the same variables in other languages. A regression analysis revealed that image agreement, name agreement, familiarity, and age of acquisition all had a significant impact on naming latency, while visual complexity and frequency did not. Although, the correlations among rated variables in Kannada were equivalent to previous normative studies, the cross-linguistic comparison revealed that only AoA was strongly correlated with other studies. The findings point to the importance of understanding the interplay of psycholinguistic variables on naming latency in different languages."
https://openalex.org/W4225724667,"Domestic dogs exhibit diverse types of both congenital and non-congenital hearing losses. Rhodesian Ridgebacks can suffer from a progressive hearing loss in the early stage of their life, a condition known as early onset adult deafness (EOAD), where they lose their hearing ability within 1-2 years after birth. In order to investigate the genetic basis of this hereditary hearing disorder, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) by using a sample of 23 affected and 162 control Rhodesian Ridgebacks. We identified a genomic region on canine chromosome 18 (CFA18) that is strongly associated with EOAD, and our subsequent targeted Sanger sequencing analysis identified a 12-bp inframe deletion in EPS8L2 (CFA18:25,868,739-25,868,751 in the UMICH_Zoey_3.1/canFam5 reference genome build). Additional genotyping confirmed a strong association between the 12-bp deletion and EOAD, where all affected dogs were homozygous for the deletion, while none of the control dogs was a deletion homozygote. A segregation pattern of this deletion in a 2-generation nuclear family indicated an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Since EPS8L2 plays a critical role in the maintenance and integrity of the inner ear hair cells in humans and other mammals, the inframe deletion found in this study represents a strong candidate causal mutation for EOAD in Rhodesian Ridgebacks. Genetic and clinical similarities between childhood deafness in humans and EOAD in Rhodesian Ridgebacks emphasizes the potential value of this dog breed in translational research in hereditary hearing disorders."
https://openalex.org/W4225990576,"The gastrointestinal microbiota begins to be acquired at birth and continually matures through early adolescence. Despite the relevance for gut health, few studies have evaluated the impact of pathobiont colonization of neonates on the severity of colitis later in life. LF82 is an adherent invasive E . coli strain associated with ileal Crohn’s disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the severity of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in mice following E . coli LF82 colonization. Gnotobiotic mice harboring the altered Schaedler flora (ASF) were used as the model. While E . coli LF82 is neither adherent nor invasive, it was been demonstrated that adult ASF mice colonized with E . coli LF82 develop more severe DSS-induced colitis compared to control ASF mice treated with DSS. Therefore, we hypothesized that E . coli LF82 colonization of neonatal ASF mice would reduce the severity of DSS-induced inflammation compared to adult ASF mice colonized with E . coli LF82. To test this hypothesis, adult ASF mice were colonized with E . coli LF82 and bred to produce offspring (LF82 N ) that were vertically colonized with LF82. LF82 N and adult-colonized (LF82 A ) mice were given 2.0% DSS in drinking water for seven days to trigger colitis. More severe inflammatory lesions were observed in the LF82 N + DSS mice when compared to LF82 A + DSS mice, and were characterized as transmural in most of the LF82 N + DSS mice. Colitis was accompanied by secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (IFNγ, IL-17) and specific mRNA transcripts within the colonic mucosa. Using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, LF82 colonization did not induce significant changes in the ASF community; however, minimal changes in spatial redistribution by fluorescent in situ hybridization were observed. These results suggest that the age at which mice were colonized with E . coli LF82 pathobiont differentially impacted severity of subsequent colitic events."

We examine whether the balcony party during the first outbreak of the pandemic is associated with how individuals cope with SI as well as its causes and consequences during the COVID-19 outbreak. A total of 303 quarantined persons responded to a Web-based survey. We found that the effect of balcony parties on the psychological costs of SI is dependent on the self-reported levels of SI. Those who experienced high levels of causes of SI perceived the balcony parties as more beneficial in inducing positive affect and reducing negative affect in comparison to those who experienced low levels of causes of SI. The opposite pattern was observed when individuals were asked about their participation in these parties: individuals with high levels of consequences of SI experienced balcony parties as less beneficial than similar pre-outbreak gathering events, while individuals with low levels of consequences of SI showed an opposite pattern. Finally, for those with high levels of causes of SI and consequences of SI, balcony parties did not meet the expectation of creating feelings of communal solidarity. However, a discrepancy between high SI expectations and experience was not found for those with low SI. Our findings demonstrate that the balcony parties are beneficial in reducing the emotional cost of social isolation-but only for those who feel low levels of SI. The fact that individuals with high levels of SI expected more out of these parties suggests the need to develop interventions aimed at optimizing their expectations. As society enters a new period in which the costs of social distancing may be higher, our findings are valuable for understanding the psychological battle that individuals face while in social isolation."

https://openalex.org/W4225544435,"Big streaming data environment concerns a complicated scenario where data to be processed continuously flow into a processing unit and certainly cause a memory overflow problem. This obstructs the adaptation of deploying all existing classic sorting algorithms because the data to be sorted must be entirely stored inside the fixed-size storage including the space in internal and external storage devices. Generally, it is always assumed that the size of each data chunk is not larger than the size of storage (M) but in fact the size of the entire stream (n) is usually much larger than M. In this paper, a new fast continuous streaming sorting is proposed to cope with the constraint of storage overflow. The algorithm was tested with various real data sets consisting of 10,000 to 17,000,000 numbers and different storage sizes ranging from 0.01n to 0.50n. It was found that the feasible lower bound of storage size is 0.35n with 100% sorting accuracy. The sorting time outperforms bubble sort, quick sort, insertion sort, and merge sort when data size is greater than 1,000,000 numbers. Remarkably, the sorting time of the proposed algorithm is 1,452 times less than the sorting time of external merge sort and 28.1767 times less than the sorting time of streaming data sort. The time complexity of proposed algorithm is O(n) while the space complexity is O(M)."

Knowledge gaps in understanding of pre-analytical factors are identified in the clinical years amongst undergraduate students due to lack of formal teaching modules on the pre-analytical phase. This study was conducted to seek experts' consensus in Clinical Chemistry on learning objectives and contents using the Delphi technique with an aim to develop an asynchronous virtual classroom for teaching pre-analytical factors of laboratory testing.A mixed method study was conducted at the Aga Khan University. A questionnaire comprising of 16 learning objectives and their associated triggers was developed on Google Docs for developing the case vignettes. A four-point Likert Scale, which included strongly agree, agree, disagree and strongly disagree, was utilized for the learning objectives. An open-ended question was included for experts to suggest new items for inclusion. A cut off of at least 75% agreement was set to establish consensus on each item. A total of 17 Chemical Pathology faculty from 13 institutions across Pakistan were invited to participate in the first round of Delphi. Similar method of response was used in round two to establish consensus on the newly identified items suggested by the faculty in round 1. Later, the agreed-upon objectives and triggers were used to develop interactive scenarios over Moodle to concurrently test and teach medical students in a nonchalant manner.A total of 17 responses were received in Round 1 of the Delphi process (response rate = 100%), while 12 responses were received in Round 2 (response rate = 71%). In round 1, all 16 learning objectives reached the required consensus (≥ 75%) with no additional learning objectives suggested by the experts. Out of 75 triggers in round 1, 61 (81.3%) reached the consensus to be included while 39 were additionally suggested. In 2nd round, 17 out of 39 newly suggested triggers met the desired consensus. 14 triggers did not reach the consensus after two rounds, and were therefore eliminated.

In contrast to gate-based models, Markov Chain models are well suited to promote the integration of the subcellular level of the cardiomyocyte to the whole cell. In this paper, we develop Markov Chain models for the L-type Calcium current that can reproduce the electrophysiology of two established human models for the ventricular and Purkinje cells. In addition, instead of presenting a single set of parameters, we present a collection of set of parameters employing Differential Evolution algorithms that can properly reproduce very different protocol data. We show the importance of using an ensemble of a set of parameter values to obtain proper results when considering a second protocol that suppresses calcium inactivation and mimics a pathological condition. We discuss how model discrepancy, data availability, and parameter identifiability can influence the choice of the size of the collection. In summary, we have modified two cardiac models by proposing new Markov Chain models for the L-type Calcium. We keep the original whole-cell dynamics by reproducing the same characteristic action potential and calcium dynamics, whereas the Markov chain-based description of the L-type Calcium channels allows novel small spatial scale simulations of subcellular processes. Finally, the use of collections of parameters was crucial for addressing model discrepancy, identifiability issues, and avoiding fitting parameters overly precisely, i.e., overfitting."
https://openalex.org/W4225863701,"The formulation of effective control strategies for any pest species generally involves the study of habitat use and preference and niche width in anthropogenically transformed natural landscapes. We evaluated whether the use, habitat preference, and niche range of the Amblyomma mixtum tick changed between stages, habitats, and seasonality (dry-wet seasons 2019) on a farm in Yopal (Casanare, Colombia). The presence and relative abundance of free-living larvae, nymphs, and adults was quantified in four different habitats according to the type of vegetation cover (Riparian Forest, Cocoa Crop, King Grass Crop, and Star Grass Paddock). Habitat availability was estimated, environmental variables were analyzed, and various indices of habitat use and preference, and niche width were calculated. A. mixtum's habitat use and preference, and niche width changed between stages, habitat types, and time of the year. The total abundance of A. mixtum was an order of magnitude greater in the dry season than the wet season. In the dry season, all stages used all habitats, while A. mixtum adults used all the habitats in both seasons. In the dry season, nymphs and larvae preferred three out of the four habitats, while adults preferred the King Grass Crop. In the wet season, nymphs and larvae preferred two habitats, whereas the adults preferred the King Grass Crop. The value of the niche width index was high for larvae, nymphs, and adults in the dry season, while it was high only for adults in the wet season. Thus, A. mixtum's vast environmental tolerance and niche breadth allows the species to use and colonize changing habitats (unstable or temporary) with fluctuating environmental conditions (e.g., King Grass Crop), potentially keeping a stable population over time and making it an extremely resistant species.

This article proposes a set of puffing conditions for cigarette emissions testing, with the goal of developing product-specific emissions characterizations which can subsequently be used to realistically model the yield of particulate matter and constituents to the mouth of a smoker, while accounting for the actual puffing behavior of the smoker. Methods Synthesis of data was conducted on data collected from a prior one-week observation of 26 adult cigarette smokers, using their usual brand cigarette in each smokers’ natural environment including the puff flow rate, duration, volume and time of day of each puff taken were recorded with a cigarette topography monitor. Data was analyzed to determine the empirical joint probability function and cumulative distribution function of mean puff flow rate and puff duration. The joint CDF was used to define an emissions topography protocol using concepts common to computational grid generation. Results Analysis of 8,250 cigarette puffs indicated the middle 95% of mean puff flow rates varied between 15 and 121 [mL/s] while the middle 95% of puff duration varied from 0.55 to 3.42 [s]. Conclusions Thirteen conditions of varying mean puff flow rate and puff duration are proposed for a comprehensive cigarette emissions topography protocol. The proposed protocol addresses inadequacies associated with common machine-puffing profiles used for generating cigarette emissions."

However, multi-level factors related to low animal source food consumption among children were poorly understood in Ethiopia, where such evidences are needed for decision making. Objectives To investigate the magnitude and individual- and community-level predictors of animal source food (ASF) consumption among children aged 6–23 months in Ethiopia. Methods We utilized a cross-sectional pooled data from 2016/19 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Surveys. A stratified two-stage cluster design was employed to select households with survey weights were applied to account for complex sample design. We fitted mixed-effects logit regression models on 4,423 children nested within 645 clusters. The fixed effect models were fitted and expressed as adjusted odds ratio with their 95% confidence intervals and measures of variation were explained by intra-class correlation coefficients, median odds ratio and proportional change in variance. The deviance information criterion and Akaike information Criterion were used as model fitness criteria. Result in Ethiopia, only 22.7% (20.5%-23.9%) of children aged 6–23 months consumed ASF. Younger children aged 6–8 months (AOR = 3.1; 95%CI: 2.4–4.1), home delivered children (AOR = 1.8; 1.4–2.3), from low socioeconomic class (AOR = 2.43; 1.7–3.5); low educational level of mothers (AOR = 1.9; 95%CI: 1.48–2.45) and children from multiple risk pregnancy were significant predictors of low animal source consumption at individual level. While children from high community poverty level (AOR = 1.53; 1.2–1.95); rural residence (AOR = 2.2; 95%CI: 1.7–2.8) and pastoralist areas (AOR = 5.4; 3.4–8.5) significantly predict animal source food consumption at community level. About 38% of the variation of ASF consumption is explained by the combined predictors at the individual and community-level while 17.8% of the variation is attributed to differences between clusters. Conclusions This study illustrates that the current ASF consumption among children is poor and a multiple interacting individual- and community level factors determine ASF consumption. In designing and implementing nutritional interventions addressing diversified diet consumption shall give a due consideration and account for these potential predictors of ASF consumption."

Safe food and dish handling guidelines are not easily evidenced for pet owners. The study was designed to investigate dog owners' feeding habits and evaluate the impact of the Food and Drug Association (FDA) hygiene protocols on dog food dish contamination. Procedures and surveys were approved by North Carolina State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and Institutional Review Board. Pet feeding and food dish hygiene data were collected from 417 dog owner surveys and 68 food dish swabs. Total aerobic plate counts (APC) were performed on 68 dishes and randomly assigned into Group A (FDA pet food handling and dish hygiene guidelines), Group B (FDA pet and human food handling and dish hygiene guidelines), or Group C (no guidelines). Hygiene protocols were instituted in-home for 1 week, followed by a second APC and follow-up survey. Survey from dog owners-households indicated: 4.7% were aware of FDA pet food handling and dish hygiene guidelines; 36% have individuals ≤ 13 years old and/or immunocompromised; 43% stored dog food 0-5 feet from human food; 34% washed their hands after feeding; and 33% prepared their dog food on human food preparation surfaces. The hygiene protocols followed by Groups A and B resulted in significant decreases in food dish APC (p<0.001; 1.4; (0.9, 2.0); p<0.05; 0.604 (0.02, 1.2), respectively), as compared to Group C (p≥0.05). Hot water (>160° F or 71.1°C) washing decreased APC (p<0.01; 1.5 (0.4, 2.6)) over cold/lukewarm water. In the follow-up survey, 8% of Group A and B respondents reported likely to adhere to protocols long-term. This study suggests a need for pet food handling and dish hygiene guideline education to minimize bacterial contamination of dishes, especially for high-risk populations."
