Using the tools and materials of organic electronics, Kim et al. combined a pressure sensor, a ring oscillator, and an ion gel–gated transistor to form an artificial mechanoreceptor (see the Perspective by Bartolozzi). The combination allows for the sensing of multiple pressure inputs, which can be converted into a sensor signal and used to drive the motion of a cockroach leg in an oscillatory pattern.

Copper is an appealing alternative catalyst for such reactions because of its abundance and downstream reactivity profile. However, this preliminary step, termed oxidative addition, is often prohibitively slow for the cheaper metal. Le et al. report a photocatalytic way around this problem. A photoredox catalyst paired with a silane can activate aryl bromides to react with copper, likely via aryl radicals. The copper in this case then catalyzes trifluoromethylation of the arenes.

https://openalex.org/W3104314883,"Research on growing American political polarization and antipathy primarily studies public institutions and political processes, ignoring private effects including strained family ties. Using anonymized smartphone-location data and precinct-level voting, we show that Thanksgiving dinners attended by opposing-party precinct residents were 30-50 minutes shorter than same-party dinners. This decline from a mean of 257 minutes survives extensive spatial and demographic controls. Dinner reductions in 2016 tripled for travelers from media markets with heavy political advertising --- an effect not observed in 2015 --- implying a relationship to election-related behavior. Effects appear asymmetric: while fewer Democratic-precinct residents traveled in 2016 than 2015, political differences shortened Thanksgiving dinners more among Republican-precinct residents. Nationwide, 34 million person-hours of cross-partisan Thanksgiving discourse were lost in 2016 to partisan effects."
https://openalex.org/W2807318413,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common condition that afflicts the general population across a broad spectrum of ages and social backgrounds. The inflammatory hypothesis of depression posits that immune hyperactivation and dysregulated cytokine production are involved in depression. To investigate cytokine profiles in patients with MDD, we examined the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and those of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 in antidepressant drug-naïve patients with MDD. Compared to healthy controls, patients with MDD had significantly higher levels of IL-1β, IL-10, and TNF-α, but significantly lower levels of IL-8. There were no significant differences in the levels of IL-6 or TGF-β1. We found linear correlations between IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-8, and the severity of depression, as well as between IL-8 and anxiety level in patients with comorbid anxiety disorder. In addition, higher IL-1β and TNF-α levels were associated with higher Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) scores, while higher IL-8 levels were associated with lower HAMD and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores. Here we present evidence of changes in cytokine levels in antidepressant drug-naïve patients with MDD. Abnormal expression of inflammatory cytokines in patients with depression suggests that depression activates an inflammatory process. Immunological abnormalities may be involved in the pathophysiology of depression."
https://openalex.org/W4210598846,"Founder effects in modern populations The genomes of ancient humans can reveal patterns of early human migration (see the Perspective by Achilli et al. ). Iceland has a genetically distinct population, despite relatively recent settlement (∼1100 years ago). Ebenesersdóttir et al. examined the genomes of ancient Icelandic people, dating to near the colonization of Iceland, and compared them with modernday Icelandic populations. The ancient DNA revealed that the founders had Gaelic and Norse origins. Genetic drift since the initial settlement has left modern Icelanders with allele frequencies that are distinctive, although still skewed toward those of their Norse founders. Scheib et al. sequenced ancient genomes from the Channel Islands of California, USA, and Ontario, Canada. The ancient Ontario population was similar to other ancient North Americans, as well as to modern Algonquian-speaking Native Americans. In contrast, the California individuals were more like groups that now live in Mexico and South America. It appears that a genetic split and population isolation likely occurred during the Ice Age, but the peoples remixed at a later date. Science , this issue p. 1028 , p. 1024 ; see also p. 964"

Testing this idea has been challenging. Lapiedra et al. took advantage of a chain of small islands in the Caribbean colonized by anole lizards. A series of repeated behavioral selection experiments were set up in which brown anole populations were established with and without predators. On predator-free islands, animals that were more exploratory were favored, whereas when predators were present, less adventurous animals survived better. Selection for behavior occurred simultaneously with morphological selection but was predominant when predators were present. Science , this issue p. 1017"

https://openalex.org/W2805295196,"Immune checkpoints are promising targets in cancer therapy. Recently, poliovirus receptor (PVR) and poliovirus receptor-related 2 (PVRL2) have been identified as novel immune checkpoints. In this investigation we show that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and AML patient samples highly express the T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT) ligands PVR and PVRL2. Using two independent patient cohorts, we could demonstrate that high PVR and PVRL2 expression correlates with poor outcome in AML. We show for the first time that antibody blockade of PVR or PVRL2 on AML cell lines or primary AML cells or TIGIT blockade on immune cells increases the anti-leukemic effects mediated by PBMCs or purified CD3+ cells in vitro. The cytolytic activity of the BiTE® antibody construct AMG 330 against leukemic cells could be further enhanced by blockade of the TIGIT-PVR/PVRL2 axis. This increased immune reactivity is paralleled by augmented secretion of Granzyme B by immune cells. Employing CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of PVR and PVRL2 in MV4-11 cells, the cytotoxic effects of antibody blockade could be recapitulated in vitro. In NSG mice reconstituted with human T cells and transplanted with either MV4-11 PVR/PVRL2 knockout or wildtype cells, prolonged survival was observed for the knockout cells. This survival benefit could be further extended by treating the mice with AMG 330. Therefore, targeting the TIGIT-PVR/PVRL2 axis with blocking antibodies might represent a promising future therapeutic option in AML."
https://openalex.org/W2807624946,"Background Post-exertional malaise (PEM) is considered to be the hallmark characteristic of myalgic encephalomyelitis/ chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Yet, patients have rarely been asked in formal studies to describe their experience of PEM. Objectives To describe symptoms associated with and the time course of PEM Methods One hundred and fifty subjects, diagnosed via the 1994 Fukuda CFS criteria, completed a survey concerning 11 symptoms they could experience after exposure to two different types of triggers. We also inquired about onset and duration of PEM and included space for subjects to write in any additional symptoms. Results were summarized with descriptive statistics; McNemar’s, paired t-, Fisher’s exact and chi-square goodness-of-fit tests were used to assess for statistical significance. Results One hundred and twenty-nine subjects (90%) experienced PEM with both physical and cognitive exertion and emotional distress. Almost all were affected by exertion but 14 (10%) reported no effect with emotion. Fatigue was the most commonly exacerbated symptom but cognitive difficulties, sleep disturbances, headaches, muscle pain, and flu-like feelings were cited by over 30% of subjects. Sixty percent of subjects experienced at least one inflammatory/ immune-related symptom. Subjects also cited gastrointestinal, orthostatic, mood-related, neurologic and other symptoms. Exertion precipitated significantly more symptoms than emotional distress (7±2.8 vs. 5±3.3 symptoms (median, standard deviation), p<0.001). Onset and duration of PEM varied for most subjects. However, 11% reported a consistent post-trigger delay of at least 24 hours before onset and 84% endure PEM for 24 hours or more. Conclusions This study provides exact symptom and time patterns for PEM that is generated in the course of patients’ lives. PEM involves exacerbation of multiple, atypical symptoms, is occasionally delayed, and persists for extended periods. Highlighting these characteristics may improve diagnosis of ME/CFS. Incorporating them into the design of future research will accelerate our understanding of ME/CFS."
https://openalex.org/W2805919280,"Opportunities to directly study the founding of a human population and its subsequent evolutionary history are rare. Using genome sequence data from 27 ancient Icelanders, we demonstrate that they are a combination of Norse, Gaelic, and admixed individuals. We further show that these ancient Icelanders are markedly more similar to their source populations in Scandinavia and the British-Irish Isles than to contemporary Icelanders, who have been shaped by 1100 years of extensive genetic drift. Finally, we report evidence of unequal contributions from the ancient founders to the contemporary Icelandic gene pool. These results provide detailed insights into the making of a human population that has proven extraordinarily useful for the discovery of genotype-phenotype associations."

https://openalex.org/W2807549853,"A key challenge in the development of precision medicine is defining the phenotypic consequences of pharmacological modulation of specific target macromolecules. To address this issue, a variety of genetic, molecular and chemical tools can be used. All of these approaches can produce misleading results if the specificity of the tools is not well understood and the proper controls are not performed. In this paper we illustrate these general themes by providing detailed studies of small molecule inhibitors of the enzymatic activity of two members of the SMYD branch of the protein lysine methyltransferases, SMYD2 and SMYD3. We show that tool compounds as well as CRISPR/Cas9 fail to reproduce many of the cell proliferation findings associated with SMYD2 and SMYD3 inhibition previously obtained with RNAi based approaches and with early stage chemical probes."
https://openalex.org/W2806465654,"Background Patients’ knowledge about their prescribed medicines is one of the most important antecedents of successful therapy. Poor knowledge about medicines can lead to serious consequences such as non-adherence and misunderstanding of the significance of adverse events. The objective of this study is to understand the factors that are responsible for a patients’ lack of knowledge regarding their medicines, by taking the perspective of the patient as well as that of healthcare professionals. Much of the work in this area has been undertaken in the setting of developed or semi-developed countries, and there is a scarcity of information from developing nations such as Pakistan. Methods This was a large qualitative study set in the hospital outpatient environment in a teaching hospital in the Punjab province of Pakistan. Data were collected from dialogue with patients (n = 19) and healthcare providers (n = 16) i.e., doctors and dispensers (where a dispenser is a person who merely dispenses medicines; i.e. is not a pharmacist) through in-depth semi-structured interviews. Patients having limited knowledge about their dispensed medicines were assessed using a checklist. The healthcare providers were recruited through a convenience sampling strategy, based on their availability and willingness to participate in the study. Based on the objectives of the study, a pilot tested interview protocol was developed, and used to conduct the interviews. The sample size was controlled by using saturation point criteria. All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. The data were analyzed to draw conclusions using inductive thematic content analysis. Results The analysis of data yielded 31 categories (patients = 19, healthcare professionals = 12), 10 subthemes and three themes. The major themes were healthcare professional-related factors, patient-related factors and system-related factors. The health professional related subthemes included: behaviour and attitude and professional liabilities and liaison. The patient related subthemes included: eagerness of the patients and lack of understanding and misconception. The system-related factors included: patients with special needs, perceived role of the pharmacist, prescription and medicines, and staff workload. Conclusion Healthcare professional related, patient related and system related factors have a significant influence on patients’ knowledge about dispensed medicines. The non-professional behaviour of doctors, increased staff workload, inadequate time and attention provided by healthcare professionals to patients, illiteracy of patients, lack of specialized labelling on medicines for illiterate patients and absence of pharmacists at the hospital, were the major concerns identified in this study. The study points to a need for appropriate patient education and counselling with regards medicines, improved coordination between hospital staff, and provision of some basic system-related facilities which are pivotal for enhancing patients’ knowledge and adherence to their treatment regimens."
https://openalex.org/W2805316992,"Tea plant (Camellia sinensis) has strong enrichment ability for selenium (Se). Selenite is the main form of Se absorbed and utilized by tea plant. However, the mechanism of selenite absorption and accumulation in tea plant is still unknown. In this study, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to perform transcriptomic analysis on the molecular mechanism of selenite absorption and accumulation in tea plant. 397.98 million high-quality reads were obtained and assembled into 168,212 unigenes, 89,605 of which were extensively annotated. There were 60,582 and 1,362 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in roots and leaves, respectively. RNA-seq results were further validated by quantitative RT-PCR. Based on GO terms, the unigenes were mainly involved in cell, binding and metabolic process. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that predominant pathways included ribosome and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum. Further analysis revealed that sulfur metabolism, glutathione metabolism, selenocompound metabolism and plant hormone signal transduction responded to selenite in tea plant. Additionally, a large number of genes of higher expressions associated with phosphate transporters, sulfur assimilation, antioxidant enzymes, antioxidant substances and responses to ethylene and jasmonic acid were identified. Stress-related plant hormones might play a signaling role in promoting sulfate/selenite uptake and assimilation in tea plant. Moreover, some other Se accumulation mechanisms of tea plant were found. Our study provides a possibility for controlling Se accumulation in tea plant through bio-technologies and will be helpful for breeding new tea cultivars."
https://openalex.org/W2807079061,"Background & aims Breastfeeding is beneficial for mothers and infants. Underlying mechanisms and biochemical mediators thus need to be investigated to develop and support improved infant nutrition practices promoting the child health. We analysed the relation between maternal breast milk composition and infant metabolism. Methods 196 pairs of mothers and infants from a European research project (PreventCD) were studied. Maternal milk samples collected at month 1 and month 4 after birth were analysed for macronutrient classes, hormone, and fatty acid (FA) content. Phospholipids, acylcarnitines, and amino acids were measured in serum samples of 4-month old infants. Associations between milk components and infant metabolites were analysed with spearman correlation and linear mixed effect models (LME). P-values were corrected for multiple testing (PLME). Results Month 1 milk protein content was strongly associated with infant serum lyso-phosphatidylcholine (LPC) 14:0 (PLME = 0.009). Month 1 milk insulin was associated to infant acetylcarnitine (PLME = 0.01). There were no associations between milk protein content and serum amino acids and milk total fat content and serum polar lipids. Middle- and odd-chain FA% in breast milk at both ages were significantly related to serum LPC and sphingomyelins (SM) species in infant serum (all PLME<0.05), while FA% 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 percentages were significantly associated to serum LPC 22:6 (PLME = 1.91×10−4/7.93×10−5) in milk only at month 4. Other polyunsaturated fatty acids and hormones in milk showed only weak associations with infant serum metabolites. Conclusions Infant serum LPC are influenced by breast milk FA composition and, intriguingly, milk protein content in early but not late lactation. LPC 14:0, previously found positively associated with obesity risk, was the serum metabolite which was the most strongly associated to milk protein content. Thus, LPC 14:0 might be a key metabolite not only reflecting milk protein intake in infants, but also relating high protein content in milk or infant formula to childhood obesity risk."
https://openalex.org/W2806719123,"Aquaculture is currently a major source of fish and has the potential to become a major source of protein in the future. These demands require efficient aquaculture. The intestinal microbiota plays an integral role that benefits the host, providing nutrition and modulating the immune system. Although our understanding of microbiota in fish gut has increased, comprehensive studies examining fish microbiota and host metabolism remain limited. Here, we investigated the microbiota and host metabolism in the coral leopard grouper, which is traded in Asian markets as a superior fish and has begun to be produced via aquaculture. We initially examined the structural changes of the gut microbiota using next-generation sequencing and found that the composition of microbiota changed between fasting and feeding conditions. The dominant phyla were Proteobacteria in fasting and Firmicutes in feeding; interchanging the dominant bacteria required 12 hours. Moreover, microbiota diversity was higher under feeding conditions than under fasting conditions. Multivariate analysis revealed that Proteobacteria are the key bacteria in fasting and Firmicutes and Fusobacteria are the key bacteria in feeding. Subsequently, we estimated microbiota functional capacity. Microbiota functional structure was relatively stable throughout the experiment; however, individual function activity changed according to feeding conditions. Taken together, these findings indicate that the gut microbiota could be a key factor to understanding fish feeding conditions and play a role in interactions with host metabolism. In addition, the composition of microbiota in ambient seawater directly affects the fish; therefore, it is important to monitor the microbiota in rearing tanks and seawater circulating systems."
https://openalex.org/W2807644002,"Understanding human-wildlife conflict is an important first step in the conservation of highly endangered species that can have adverse effects on human communities, such as elephants. To gain insights into variables that shape attitudes toward elephant conservation in Asia, we surveyed 410 households and 46 plantation owners in seven villages around the Salakpra Wildlife Sanctuary in western Thailand, an area of high human-elephant conflict. We sought to evaluate how past experiences with elephants (positive or negative), as well as socio-economic variables (age, income level, gender, and employment type) affect attitudes toward elephant conservation and coexistence in this area. In addition, we quantified deterrence methods currently used and identify potential mitigation strategies supported by community members. In general, less supportive attitudes toward elephant conservation and coexistence were held by individuals older than 35 years of age, those who had previously had experienced negative interactions with elephants, those with lower incomes, and those working in the agricultural sector. Conversely, those who had received benefits from living near elephants (e.g., supplemental income or feelings of pride from hosting volunteers or participating in conservation work) had more supportive views of elephant coexistence. Plantation owners reported using a variety of deterrence methods with varying success, with firecrackers being the most commonly utilized method. Community members identified several potentially beneficial mitigation strategies including forest restorations and patrol teams, adding water sources to wild elephant habitat, and education of local school and community groups. Overall, our results highlight the value of community members receiving benefits from living near elephants and suggest that special incentives may be needed for demographic groups disproportionately affected by elephants (e.g. those at lower income levels, those working in agriculture). A combination of these and other approaches will be required if human-elephant coexistence in western Thailand is to be realized."

Current therapy of ILD, especially those associated with connective tissue diseases, is rather limited and new anti-fibrotic strategies are needed. In this study, we investigated the anti-fibrotic activity in vivo of human mesenchymal stromal cells obtained from whole umbilical cord (hUC-MSC). Adult immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice (n. = 8 for each experimental condition) were injected intravenously with hUC-MSC (n. = 2.5 × 105) twice, 24 hours and 7 days after endotracheal injection of bleomycin. Upon sacrifice at days 8, 14, 21, collagen content, inflammatory cytokine profile, and hUC-MSC presence in explanted lung tissue were analyzed. Systemic administration of a double dose of hUC-MSC significantly reduced bleomycin-induced lung injury (inflammation and fibrosis) in mice through a selective inhibition of the IL6-IL10-TGFβ axis involving lung M2 macrophages. Only few hUC-MSC were detected from explanted lungs, suggesting a ""hit and run"" mechanism of action of this cellular therapy. Our data indicate that hUC-MSC possess strong in vivo anti-fibrotic activity in a mouse model resembling an immunocompetent human subject affected by inflammatory ILD, providing proof of concept for ad-hoc clinical trials."

We propose here a methodological approach aimed to identify areas with a high level of agro-biodiversity in which to set or enhance in situ conservation of plant genetic resources. These areas are identified using three criteria: Presence of Landrace diversity, Presence of wild species and Agro-ecosystem ecological diversity. A Restrictive and an Additive prioritization strategy has been applied on the entire Italian territory and has resulted in establishing nationwide 53 and 197 agro-biodiversity hotspots respectively. At present the strategies can easily be applied at a European level and can be helpful to develop conservation strategies everywhere."
https://openalex.org/W2805344969,"Introduction Increased knowledge of breast cancer risk factors may enable a paradigm shift from one-size-fits-all breast cancer screening to screening and subsequent prevention guided by a woman’s individual risk of breast cancer. Professionals will play a key role in informing women about this new personalised screening and prevention programme. Therefore, it is essential to explore professionals’ views of the acceptability of this new programme, since this may affect shared decision-making. Methods Professionals from three European countries (the Netherlands, United Kingdom, and Sweden) participated in digital concept mapping, a systematic mixed methods approach used to explore complex multidimensional constructs. Results Across the three countries, professionals prioritised the following five themes which may impact decision-making from the perspective of eligible women: (1) Anxiety/worry; (2) Proactive approach; (3) Reassurance; (4) Lack of knowledge; and (5) Organisation of risk assessment and feedback. Furthermore, Dutch and British professionals expressed concerns regarding the acceptability of a heterogeneous screening policy, suggesting women will question their risk feedback and assigned pathway of care. Swedish professionals emphasised the potential impact of the programme on family relations. Conclusions The perspectives of Dutch, British, and Swedish professionals of women’s decision-making regarding personalised breast cancer screening and prevention generally appear in line with women’s own views of acceptability as previously reported. This will facilitate shared decision-making. However, concerns regarding potential consequences of this new programme for screening outcomes and organisation need to be addressed, since this may affect how professionals communicate the programme to eligible women."
https://openalex.org/W2807325660,"Scholars, educators, and students are increasingly encouraged to participate in online spaces. While the current literature highlights the potential positive outcomes of such participation, little research exists on the sentiment that these individuals may face online and on the factors that may lead some people to face different types of sentiment than others. To investigate these issues, we examined the strength of positive and negative sentiment expressed in response to TEDx and TED-Ed talks posted on YouTube (n = 655), the effect of several variables on comment and reply sentiment (n = 774,939), and the projected effects that sentiment-based moderation would have had on posted content. We found that most comments and replies were neutral in nature and some topics were more likely than others to elicit positive or negative sentiment. Videos of male presenters showed greater neutrality, while videos of female presenters saw significantly greater positive and negative polarity in replies. Animations neutralized both the negativity and positivity of replies at a very high rate. Gender and video format influenced the sentiment of replies and not just the initial comments that were directed toward the video. Finally, we found that using sentiment as a way to moderate offensive content would have a significant effect on non-offensive content. These findings have far-reaching implications for social media platforms and for those who encourage or prepare students and scholars to participate online."
https://openalex.org/W2805169798,"Training the next generation of orthopaedic surgeons in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is crucial, but might affect operative time and outcome. We hypothesized that the learning curve of residents in TKA has an impact on (1) operative time, (2) complication rates and (3) early postoperative outcome. In a retrospective analysis of 738 primary TKAs from our institutional joint registry, operative time, complication rates, patient-reported outcome measures (EQ-5D, WOMAC) within the first year and responder rates for positive outcome as defined by the OMERACT-OARSI criteria were compared between trainee and senior surgeons differentiating between conventional and navigated TKA. Mean operative time was 69.5±18.5min for trainees compared to 77.3±25.8min for senior surgeons (95%CI of the difference 1.5–13.9min, p = 0.02) in conventional TKA and 80.4±22.1min to 84.1±27.6min (95%CI of the difference -0.9–8.2min, p = 0.12) for navigated TKA, respectively. Intraoperative fracture (p≥0.36), thrombosis (p≥0.90), neurological deficits (p≥0.90) and infection rates (p≥0.28) were comparably low in both groups. Patient-reported outcome measures one year after TKA were similar for trainee and senior surgeons with EQ-5D 0.83±0.17 to 0.80±0.21 (p = 0.25) and WOMAC 74.85±18.60 to 72.77±20.12 (p = 0.44) for conventional TKA and EQ-5D 0.80±0.20 to 0.82±0.18 (p = 0.23) and WOMAC 72.71±18.52 to 75.77±17.78 (p = 0.07) for navigated TKA, respectively. Similarly, responder rates for positive outcome were comparable between trainees and senior surgeons (90.7% versus 87.0% p = 0.39 for conventional TKA, 88.7% versus 89.4% p = 0.80 for navigated TKA). Supervised TKA is a safe procedure during the learning curve of young orthopaedic surgeons."
https://openalex.org/W2806636823,"Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) has not been validated in pre-operative planning of the dural venous sinus stenting (VSS) among idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) patients. We aim to prospectively evaluate dural venous sinus measurement in IIH patient population on two-dimensional time-of-flight (2D-TOF) MRV and Three-dimensional contrast-enhanced (3D-CE) MRV acquisitions and compare them against real-time endoluminal measurements with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), served as the reference.The study has been approved by the Weill Cornell Medicine institutional review board. All patients signed written informed consent approved by IRB. Prospective evaluation of forty-five consecutive IIH patients treated with VSS at our institution were evaluated. Patients with pre-stent magnetic resonance venography (MRV) ≤ 6-months of VSS and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) during VSS constituted the study population. Maximum diameter (in mm), Area (in cm2) and Perimeter (in cm) were measured at posterior 1/3rd of superior sagittal sinus (SSS), proximal transverse sinus (PTS), proximal sigmoid sinus (PSS) and mid sigmoid sinus (MSS) on 2D-TOF-MRV, 3D-CE-MRV and IVUS. Statistical analysis performed using box and whisker plots, Bland-Altman analysis and paired sample t-test.Twenty (n = 20) patients constituted our study population. The mean age was 30±11 years (7-59 years) and 18 out of 20 were female patients. Mean weight and BMI (range) were 86.3±18.3 kilograms (30.8-107.5 kgs) and 32.9±6.8 kg/M2 (16.4-48.3kg/M2) respectively. The CE-MRV significantly oversized the cerebral venous sinuses compared to TOF-MRV (Dmax: +2.0±1.35 mm, p<0.001; Area: +13.31±10.92 mm2, p<0.001 and Perimeter: +4.79±3.4 mm, p<0.001) and IVUS (Dmax: +1.52±2.16 mm, p<0.001; Area: +10.03±21.5 mm2, p<0.001 and Perimeter: +4.15±3.27 mm, p<0.001). The TOF-MRV sinus measurements were in good agreement with the IVUS measurements with no significant variation (Dmax: +.21±2.23 mm, p = 0.49; Area: +2.51±20.41mm2, p = 0.347 and Perimeter: +.001±1.11 mm, p = 0.991).We report baseline cerebral venous sinus measurements (maximum diameter, area and perimeter) in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. In our experience, TOF-MRV is a reliable representation of endoluminal cerebral venous sinus dimensions, and CE-MRV measurements reflected an overestimation of the endoluminal sinus dimensions when compared against the real time IVUS measurements."
https://openalex.org/W2805147383,"We previously reported that synthetic vaccine particles (SVP) encapsulating antigens and TLR agonists resulted in augmentation of immune responses with minimal production of systemic inflammatory cytokines. Here we evaluated two different polymer formulations of SVP-encapsulated antigens and tested their ability to induce cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) in combination with SVP-encapsulated adjuvants. One formulation led to efficient antigen processing and cross-presentation, rapid and sustained CTL activity, and expansion of CD8+ T cell effector memory cells locally and centrally, which persisted for at least 1-2 years after a single immunization. SVP therapeutic dosing resulted in suppression of tumor growth and a substantial delay in mortality in several syngeneic mouse cancer models. Treatment with checkpoint inhibitors and/or cytotoxic drugs, while suboptimal on their own, showed considerable synergy with SVP immunization. SVP encapsulation of endosomal TLR agonists provided superior CTL induction, therapeutic benefit and/or improved safety profile compared to free adjuvants. SVP vaccines encapsulating mutated HPV-16 E7 and E6/E7 recombinant proteins led to induction of broad CTL activity and strong inhibition of TC-1 tumor growth, even when administered therapeutically 13-14 days after tumor inoculation in animals bearing palpable tumors. A pilot study in non-human primates showed that SVP-encapsulated E7/E6 adjuvanted with SVP-encapsulated poly(I:C) led to robust induction of antigen-specific T and B cell responses."
https://openalex.org/W2807199396,"It has been hypothesized that uneven sex ratios in the population could lead to increased violence. The objective of this analysis is to explore the relationship between uneven sex ratios in the population and violence. This analysis uses data collected from men in six Asian countries about their experiences and perpetration of violence. We combine this with region- and age specific sex ratios calculated from Census data to explore the relationship between sex ratios and violence using multilevel models. We find that men from region-age brackets with higher ratios of men to women are significantly more likely to report ever having raped a woman, having perpetrated intimate partner violence, or having used a weapon. We find no evidence for an association between sex ratios and reports of ever having raped a man."
https://openalex.org/W2806131091,"Lack of insight is a core feature of non-affective psychosis and has been associated with poorer outcomes. Brain abnormalities underlying lack of insight have been suggested, mostly in the frontal lobe, although previous research showed mixed results. We used a voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis in 108 first-episode non-affective psychosis patients to investigate the pattern of brain structural abnormalities related to lack of insight. In addition, 77 healthy volunteers were compared with the patients classified as having poor and good insight. The shortened version of the Scale to Assess Unawareness of Mental Disorder was used to evaluate insight. Patients with poor insight (n = 68) compared with patients with good insight (n = 40) showed a single significant cluster (kc = 5834; PcFWE = 0.001) of reduced grey matter volume (GMV) in the right occipital lobe extending to its lateral and medial surfaces, the cuneus, and the middle temporal gyrus. In addition, GMV at this cluster showed a negative correlation with the score of the SUMD (r = -0.305; p = 0.001). When comparing patients with poor insight with healthy subjects overall reductions of GMV were found, mainly in frontal and occipital lobes. Hence, poor insight in non-affective psychosis seems to be associated with specific brain abnormalities in the right occipital and temporal cortical regions. Dysfunction in any combination of these areas may contribute to lack of insight in non-affective psychosis. Specifically, the ‘right’ hemisphere dysfunction underlying impaired insight in our sample is consistent with previously reported similarities between lack of insight in psychosis and anosognosia in neurological disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2806004572,"Background The prevalence of maternal obesity is rising. Pre-pregnancy obesity is associated with later cardiovascular disease in the child and the underlying pathogenesis begins in early life. Therefore, pregnancy and infancy are key periods for potential intervention. The aim of this study was to study the cardiac function in newborns of obese women compared to newborns of normal-weight women, and to determine if exercise intervention during pregnancy could have an effect on cardiac function of newborns to obese women. Material and methods Fifty-five pregnant women, 51 obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) and four overweight (BMI 28–30 kg/m2), were randomized to an exercise training group (n = 27) or a control group (standard maternity care, n = 28). From gestational week 14 until delivery participants in the intervention group were offered supervised training sessions three times weekly. In addition, they were told to exercise at home once weekly. All newborns had an echocardiogram performed 1–3 days and 6–8 weeks after delivery. The results were compared with newborns of normal weight women (n = 20, standard maternity care). Results Newborns of obese women had an impaired systolic and diastolic cardiac function with reduced global strain, strain rate, tissue Doppler velocities and a thicker intraventricular septum at birth and after 6–8 weeks after delivery compared to newborns of normal weight women. Exercise had no statistically significant effect on either of the cardiac function parameters. The mean (± standard deviation) adherence to the exercise protocol was 1.3 ± 0.8 sessions per week for supervised training and 0.8 ± 0.7 sessions per week for home-based exercise training. Conclusions Newborns of obese women had reduced cardiac function and thicker intraventricular septum compared to newborns of normal weight women. Exercise training during pregnancy had no significant effect, potentially due to a low number of subjects and low adherence to the exercise protocol.

https://openalex.org/W2807341913,"Objective The intention to leave surgical training, hereinafter referred as proxy of “attrition,” is associated with poor well-being in the workplace. Attrition is suggested to diminish when residents possess job-crafting skills, that is, the ability to redefine their job in meaningful ways and maximize well-being at work by increasing structural and social resources and challenges and decreasing hindering demands. However, the evidence supporting this relationship is scant. This study sought to: 1) investigate to what extent residents possess job-crafting skills and compare residents’ levels of job-crafting skills across years of residency training; 2) investigate the relationship between job crafting, well-being as measured by burnout and work-engagement rates, and the intention to leave; and 3) compare the levels of job-crafting skills and well-being between residents with and without serious intentions to leave. Methods This cross sectional study was conducted in fifteen residency programs in Colombia. Surgical residents completed different questionnaires including the Dutch Job Crafting Scale (DJCS), MBI-Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS), Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES-17) and an adapted version of the Nurse Turnover Intention Scale (NTIS). The objectives were addressed by independent analyses of variance (ANOVA), structural equation modeling techniques (SEM) and independent t-tests, respectively. Results A total of 202 residents participated. Residents generally scored high on their job-crafting skills to increase structural and social resources as well as challenging demands, but were less positive about their skills to reduce hindering demands. No differences across years of training were found. Job crafting correlated positively with work-engagement, which was inversely related to the intention to leave. Conversely, job crafting correlated negatively with burnout, which bore a positive relationship to the intention to leave. Residents with serious intentions to leave exhibited lower levels of most job-crafting skills and work-engagement, compared to those without such intentions. Conclusions This study adds evidence that attrition is a process mediated by residents’ well being at work, which can be molded by their job-crafting endeavors. Future research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at cultivating resident’s job-crafting abilities in order to reduce attrition."

Ryvarden and Steccherinum bourdotii Saliba & A. David grow as secondary xylotrohps on well decomposed woody materials. The main objective of the current study was to compare oxidative potential, growth, production of oxidative enzymes and laccase properties of J. nitida and S. bourdotii with that of typical primary xylotrohps Trametes hirsuta (Wulfen) Lloyd and Coriolopsis caperata (Berk.) Murrill, belonging to the core polyporoid clade. For the first time we report species J. nitida and S. bourdotii as active laccase producers. New laccases from J. nitida and S. bourdotii were purified and characterized. They had an identical molecular weight of 63 kDa and isoelectric points of 3.4 and 3.1, respectively. However, the redox potential of the T1 copper site for both J. nitida (610 mV) and S. bourdotii (640 mV) laccases was lower than those for T. hirsuta and C. caperata laccases. The new laccases showed higher temperature optima and better thermal stability than T. hirsuta and C. caperata laccases. Their half-lives were more than 40 min at 70 °C. The laccases from J. nitida and S. bourdotii showed higher affinity to syringyl-type phenolic compounds than T. hirsuta and C. caperata laccases. The oxidative potential of studied fungi as well as the properties of their laccases are discussed in terms of the fungal life-style."
https://openalex.org/W2535503600,"Aim To examine tactile sensitivity in the leg and foot sole of below-knee amputees (diabetic n = 3, traumatic n = 1), and healthy control subjects (n = 4), and examine the association between sensation and balance. Method Vibration perception threshold (VPT; 3, 40, 250Hz) and monofilaments (MF) were used to examine vibration and light touch sensitivity on the intact limb, residual limb, and homologous locations on controls. A functional reach test was performed to assess functional balance. Results Tactile sensitivity was lower for diabetic amputee subjects compared to age matched controls for both VPT and MF; which was expected due to presence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. In contrast, the traumatic amputee participant showed increased sensitivity for VPT at 40Hz and 250Hz vibration in both the intact and residual limbs compared to controls. Amputees with lower tactile sensitivity had shorter reach distances compared to those with higher sensitivity. Conclusion Changes in tactile sensitivity in the residual limb of trans-tibial amputees may have implications for the interaction between the amputee and the prosthetic device. The decreased skin sensitivity observed in the residual limb of subjects with diabetes is of concern as changes in skin sensitivity may be important in 1) identification/prevention of excessive pressure and 2) for functional stability. Interestingly, we saw increased residual limb skin sensitivity in the individual with the traumatic amputation. Although not measured directly in the present study, this increase in tactile sensitivity may be related to cortical reorganisation, which is known to occur following amputation, and would support similar findings observed in upper limb amputees."
https://openalex.org/W2805908756,"There are many challenges facing the use of alendronate sodium for the treatment of osteoporosis such as low bioavailability of 0.6% and oesophageal ulceration with bleeding. Due to the aforementioned limitation, the main objective of this research is to utilize a statistical experimental design in the formulation and optimization of alendronate in the form of controlled release biodegradable intramuscular in-situ gel. A Box–Behnken experimental design employing Statgraphics® software was used to develop an optimized in-situ gel formulation and to estimate the effects of Poly-DL-lactide-coglycolide as a primary polymer, the copolymer polycaprolactone, and lipid surfactant capryol 90. Every system was evaluated for gellation character, and in vitro release. As a novel technique for evaluation of the in-situ gel, in-vivo biodegradability rate was estimated in rats. Pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed in rabbits. The results indicated a significant effect of the copolymer and lipid surfactant on initial burst, and a significant effect of the primary and copolymer on drug percentage released. The optimum formulation showed a 5% initial burst, an in-vivo biodegradability rate estimated at 8% every seven days in rats, and the pharmacokinetic evaluation revealed that alendronate sodium mean residence time extended to 102 days in rabbits. In conclusion, the optimum biodegradable intramuscular in-situ gel formulations is a promising approach for providing higher bioavailability, extended release for more than three months, with elimination of esophageal side effects."
https://openalex.org/W2807074730,"Ultrasound-assisted extraction of hemicellulose and phenolic compounds from bamboo bast fibre powder was investigated. The effect of ultrasonic probe depth and power input parameters on the type and amount of products extracted was assessed. The results of input energy and radical formation correlated with the calculated values for the anti-nodal point (λ/4; 16.85 mm, maximum amplitude) of the ultrasonic wave in aqueous medium. Ultrasonic treatment at optimum probe depth of 15 mm improve 2.6-fold the extraction efficiencies of hemicellulose and phenolic lignin compounds from bamboo bast fibre powder. LC-Ms-Tof (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-time of flight) analysis indicated that ultrasound led to the extraction of coniferyl alcohol, sinapyl alcohol, vanillic acid, cellobiose, in contrast to boiling water extraction only. At optimized conditions, ultrasound caused the formation of radicals confirmed by the presence of (+)-pinoresinol which resulted from the radical coupling of coniferyl alcohol. Ultrasounds revealed to be an efficient methodology for the extraction of hemicellulosic and phenolic compounds from woody bamboo without the addition of harmful solvents."
https://openalex.org/W2807179049,"The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism is associated with impaired short-term plasticity in the motor cortex, short-term motor learning, and intermanual transfer of a procedural motor skill. Here, we investigated the impact of the Val66Met polymorphism on the modulation of cortical excitability and interhemispheric inhibition through sensorimotor practice of simple dynamic skills with the right and left first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscles. To that end, we compared motor evoked potentials (MEP) amplitudes and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) in the bilateral representations of the FDI muscle in the primary motor cortex (M1), and interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) from the left to right M1, before and after right and left FDI muscle training in an alternated sequence. Val66Met participants did not differ from their Val66Val counterparts on motor performance at baseline and following motor training, or on measures of MEP amplitude and IHI. However, while the Val66Val group displayed significant SICI reduction in the bilateral M1 in response to motor training, SICI remained unchanged in the Val66Met group. Further, Val66Val group's SICI decrease in the left M1, which was also observed following unimanual training with the right hand in the Control Right group, was correlated with motor improvement with the left hand. The potential interaction between left and right M1 activity during bimanual training and the implications of altered activity-dependent cortical excitability on short-term motor learning in Val66Met carriers are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2807358066,"Exercise ventilation/perfusion matching in continuous-flow left ventricular assist device recipients (LVAD) has not been studied systematically. Twenty-five LVAD and two groups of 15 reduced ejection fraction chronic heart failure (HFrEF) patients with peak VO2 matched to that of LVAD (HFrEF-matched) and ≥14 ml/kg/min (HFrEF≥14), respectively, underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing with arterial blood gas analysis, echocardiogram and venous blood sampling for renal function evaluation. Arterial-end-tidal PCO2 difference (P(a-ET)CO2) and physiological dead space-tidal volume ratio (VD/VT) were used as descriptors of alveolar and total wasted ventilation, respectively. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion/pulmonary artery systolic pressure ratio (TAPSE/PASP) and blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio were calculated in all patients and used as surrogates of right ventriculo-arterial coupling and circulating effective volume, respectively. LVAD and HFrEF-matched showed no rest-to-peak change of P(a-ET)CO2 (4.5±2.4 vs. 4.3±2.2 mm Hg and 4.1±1.4 vs. 3.8±2.5 mm Hg, respectively, both p >0.40), whereas a decrease was observed in HFrEF≥14 (6.5±3.6 vs. 2.8±2.0 mm Hg, p <0.0001). Rest-to-peak changes of P(a-ET)CO2 correlated to those of VD/VT (r = 0.70, p <0.0001). Multiple regression indicated TAPSE/PASP and blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio as independent predictors of peak P(a-ET)CO2. LVAD exercise gas exchange is characterized by alveolar wasted ventilation, i.e. hypoperfusion of ventilated alveoli, similar to that of advanced HFrEF patients and related to surrogates of right ventriculo-arterial coupling and circulating effective volume."
https://openalex.org/W2806936446,"Objective In this secondary analysis of data from an intervention trial, we assessed the performance of Mid Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) as a predictor of mortality in children aged 6–59 months from Delhi, India, one year after their initial MUAC measurements were taken. Additionally, we assessed MUAC as an absolute value and MUAC z-scores as predictors of risk of mortality. Methods In the trial, children were screened using MUAC prior to referral to the study clinic. These children were revisited a year later to ascertain their vital status. Baseline MUAC and MUAC z-scores were used to categorize children as severely (MUAC <115 mm, MUAC z-score <-3SD) or moderately (MUAC 115 to <125 mm, MUAC z-score <-2SD) malnourished. The proportion of malnutrition, risk of mortality, relative risk estimates, positive predictive value and area under the curve (AUC) by MUAC and MUAC z-scores were calculated. Results In the resurvey, the first 36159 children of the 48635 in the initial survey were contacted. Of these, vital status of 34060 (94.2%) was available. The proportion of severe malnutrition by MUAC (<115 mm) was 0.5% with an associated mortality of 4.7% over a one year period and an attributable mortality of 13% while the proportion of the severe malnutrition by MUAC z-score (<-3SDwas 0.9% with an associated mortality of 2.2%. Conclusions MUAC is a significant predictor of subsequent mortality in under-five children. In settings where height measurement is not feasible, MUAC can be used as a screening tool for identifying severely malnourished children for management."
https://openalex.org/W2807301842,"Glioblastoma is an aggressive and invasive brain malignancy with high mortality rates despite current treatment modalities. In this study, we show that a 7-gene signature, previously found to govern the switch of glioblastomas from dormancy to aggressive tumor growth, correlates with improved overall survival of patients with glioblastoma. Using glioblastoma dormancy models, we validated the role of 2 genes from the signature, thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), as regulators of glioblastoma dormancy and explored their therapeutic potential. EGFR up-regulation was reversed using EGFR small interfering RNA polyplex, antibody, or small-molecule inhibitor. The diminished function of TSP-1 was augmented via a peptidomimetic. The combination of EGFR inhibition and TSP-1 restoration led to enhanced therapeutic efficacy in vitro, in 3-dimensional patient-derived spheroids, and in a subcutaneous human glioblastoma model in vivo. Systemic administration of the combination therapy to mice bearing intracranial murine glioblastoma resulted in marginal therapeutic outcomes, probably due to brain delivery challenges, p53 mutation status, and the aggressive nature of the selected cell line. Nevertheless, this study provides a proof of concept for exploiting regulators of tumor dormancy for glioblastoma therapy. This therapeutic strategy can be exploited for future investigations using a variety of therapeutic entities that manipulate the expression of dormancy-associated genes in glioblastoma as well as in other cancer types.—Tiram, G., Ferber, S., Ofek, P., Eldar-Boock, A., Ben-Shushan, D., Yeini, E., Krivitsky, A., Blatt, R., Almog, N., Henkin, J., Amsalem, O., Yavin, E., Cohen, G., Lazarovici, P., Lee, J.

We previously showed that neuregulin-1 (NRG1) was neuroprotective in rat models of ischemic stroke. We used gene expression profiling to understand the early cellular and molecular mechanisms of NRG1’s effects after the induction of ischemia. Ischemic stroke was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Rats were allocated to 3 groups: (1) control, (2) MCAO and (3) MCAO + NRG1. Cortical brain tissues were collected three hours following MCAO and NRG1 treatment and subjected to microarray analysis. Data and statistical analyses were performed using R/Bioconductor platform alongside Genesis, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and Enrichr software packages. There were 2693 genes differentially regulated following ischemia and NRG1 treatment. These genes were organized by expression patterns into clusters using a K-means clustering algorithm. We further analyzed genes in clusters where ischemia altered gene expression, which was reversed by NRG1 (clusters 4 and 10). NRG1, IRS1, OPA3, and POU6F1 were central linking (node) genes in cluster 4. Conserved Transcription Factor Binding Site Finder (CONFAC) identified ETS-1 as a potential transcriptional regulator of NRG1 suppressed genes following ischemia. A transcription factor activity array showed that ETS-1 activity was increased 2-fold, 3 hours following ischemia and this activity was attenuated by NRG1. These findings reveal key early transcriptional mechanisms associated with neuroprotection by NRG1 in the ischemic penumbra."
https://openalex.org/W2805643514,"Objective To assess the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) access and appropriateness of people with disabilities compared to those without, in Guatemala. Methods A case-control study was conducted, nested within a national survey. The study included 707 people with disabilities, and 465 age- and sex-matched controls without disabilities. Participants reported on WASH access at the household and individual level. A sub-set of 121 cases and 104 controls completed a newly designed, in-depth WASH questionnaire. Results Households including people with disabilities were more likely to use an improved sanitation facility compared to control households (age-sex-adjusted OR: 1.7, 95% CI 1.3–2.5), but otherwise there were no differences in WASH access at the household level. At the individual level, people with disabilities reported greater difficulties in relation to sanitation (mean score 26.2, SD 26.5) and hygiene access and quality (mean 30.7, SD 24.2) compared to those without disabilities (15.5, 21.7, p<0.001; 22.4, 19.1, p<0.01). There were no differences in different aspects of water collection between people with and without disabilities in this context where over 85% of participants had water piped into their dwelling. Among people with disabilities, older adults were more likely to experience difficulties in hygiene and sanitation than younger people with disabilities. Conclusions People with disabilities in Guatemala experience greater difficulties in accessing sanitation facilities and practicing hygienic behaviours than their peers without disabilities. More data collection is needed using detailed tools to detect these differences, highlight which interventions are needed, and to allow assessment of their effectiveness."

A well-established animal model has previously demonstrated disruptions in intracranial pressure and developmental abnormalities in rabbits with congenital craniosynostosis compared to wild type rabbits.The current study aimed to measure the cerebral blood flow (CBF) in developing rabbits with craniosynostosis who underwent suturectomy compared to those with no intervention and compared to wild type rabbits.Rabbits with early onset coronal suture synostosis were assigned to have suturectomy at 10 days of age (EOCS-SU, n = 15) or no intervention (EOCS, n = 18). A subset of each group was randomly selected for measurement at 10 days of age, 25 days of age, and 42 days of age. Wild type rabbits (WT, n = 18) were also randomly assigned to measurement at each time point as controls. Cerebral blood flow at the bilateral hemispheres, cortices, thalami, and superficial cortices was measured in each group using arterial spin-labeling MRI.At 25 days of age, CBF at the superficial cortex was significantly higher in EOCS rabbits (192.6 ± 10.1 mL/100 mg/min on the left and 195 ± 9.5 mL/100 mg/min on the right) compared to WT rabbits (99.2 ± 29.1 mL/100 mg/min on the left and 96.2 ± 21.4 mL/100 mg/min on the right), but there was no significant difference in CBF between EOCS-SU (97.6 ± 11.3 mL/100 mg/min on the left and 99 ± 7.4 mL/100 mg/min on the right) and WT rabbits. By 42 days of age the CBF in EOCS rabbits was not significantly different than that of WT rabbits.Suturectomy eliminated the abnormally increased CBF at the superficial cortex seen in EOCS rabbits at 25 days of age. This finding contributes to the evidence that suturectomy limits abnormalities of ICP and CBF associated with craniosynostosis."

The un-operated fellow eye from each pig was used as an external control. The pigs were post-operatively kept alive for 30 days before termination and enucleation of the eyes. Prior to enucleation, all eyes underwent examination of the lens and indirect ophthalmoscopy. Enucleated eyes were fixed in formalin, examined macroscopically and processed for histological assessment. Microscopic analysis included assessment of neuro-retina, retinal vasculature, RPE and ONH, as well as observation for any morphological intraocular changes. Comparison was made between: (1) treated and untreated areas of the same eye (internal control) (2) different areas within the same eye operated on using different vitrector settings (3) eyes operated on with the HV and GV (4) eyes receiving surgery and the fellow un-operated eye (external control, same pig).All lenses had remained clear at 30 days into the postoperative period. On indirect ophthalmoscopy, the retina had remained attached in all eyes with no visible changes to the neuro-retina, retinal vasculature, RPE or ONH. Two eyes showed localized RPE depigmentation secondary to previously documented intraoperative retinal touch. The Morphological changes in the retinal layers above depigmented RPE were no different from retinal change elsewhere. There were mild and similar microscopic changes observed in the neuro-retina, retinal vasculature, RPE or ONH associated with either the HV or GV PPVs. Preliminary histological findings revealed no significant differences between eyes operated on with the HV and those operated on the GV.At 30 days into the postoperative period, there seemed to be similar morphological changes attributable to the use of HV and GV. Therefore, the HV promises to be a new alternative to the currently commercially available GV for PPV."
https://openalex.org/W2805850299,"Ageing is a natural phenomenon that is inherently complex and remains a mystery. Conceptual model of cellular ageing landscape was proposed for computational studies of ageing. However, there is a lack of quantitative model of cellular ageing landscape. This study aims to investigate the mechanism of cellular ageing in a theoretical model using the framework of Waddington's epigenetic landscape. We construct an ageing gene regulatory network (GRN) consisting of the core cell cycle regulatory genes (including p53). A model parameter (activation rate) is used as a measure of the accumulation of DNA damage. Using the bifurcation diagrams to estimate the parameter values that lead to multi-stability, we obtained a conceptual model for capturing three distinct stable steady states (or attractors) corresponding to homeostasis, cell cycle arrest, and senescence or apoptosis. In addition, we applied a Monte Carlo computational method to quantify the potential landscape, which displays: I) one homeostasis attractor for low accumulation of DNA damage; II) two attractors for cell cycle arrest and senescence (or apoptosis) in response to high accumulation of DNA damage. Using the Waddington's epigenetic landscape framework, the process of ageing can be characterized by state transitions from landscape I to II. By in silico perturbations, we identified the potential landscape of a perturbed network (inactivation of p53), and thereby demonstrated the emergence of a cancer attractor. The simulated dynamics of the perturbed network displays a landscape with four basins of attraction: homeostasis, cell cycle arrest, senescence (or apoptosis) and cancer. Our analysis also showed that for the same perturbed network with low DNA damage, the landscape displays only the homeostasis attractor. The mechanistic model offers theoretical insights that can facilitate discovery of potential strategies for network medicine of ageing-related diseases such as cancer."

To our knowledge, however, no previous studies have evaluated these factors at the population level.To evaluate the association between cognitive function in the elderly with pain, physical activity, and the interaction between these variables. Estimates are generated for the United States population.We made use of the NHANES database (1999-2002), making adjustments so that our results represent the United States population. Cognitive function was evaluated through the Digit Symbol Substitution Test. Our main predictors were (1) pain, defined as soreness of either the shoulder, neck, lower back and joint, or a severe headache (2) physical activity, measured as the performance while performing tasks at home, physical activity intensity, walking, bicycle riding, and muscle strengthening.Most individual pain sites were not significantly associated with cognitive function, while all physical activity factors were associated with an increase in cognitive function. When evaluating the sample subset of those with cognitive scores lower than the median, a combination of more pain and less physical activity was consistently associated with lower cognitive scores when compared to those performing more physical activity with or without pain. When evaluating individuals with cognitive scores above the median, a similar association pattern was perceived.Among the population of individuals above the age of 60, higher cognitive levels are associated with more physical activity and less with pain, although both factors might impact cognition. Public policy resources should be commensurate with these findings when targeting cognitive function among the aging population."
https://openalex.org/W2235617646,"We present an iterative flat hard clustering algorithm designed to operate on arbitrary similarity matrices, with the only constraint that these matrices be symmetrical. Although functionally very close to kernel k-means, our proposal performs a maximization of average intra-class similarity, instead of a squared distance minimization, in order to remain closer to the semantics of similarities. We show that this approach permits the relaxing of some conditions on usable affinity matrices like semi-positiveness, as well as opening possibilities for computational optimization required for large datasets. Systematic evaluation on a variety of data sets shows that compared with kernel k-means and the spectral clustering methods, the proposed approach gives equivalent or better performance, while running much faster. Most notably, it significantly reduces memory access, which makes it a good choice for large data collections. Material enabling the reproducibility of the results is made available online."

We found no tumor recurrence in the 70 EGC patients during the mean follow-up periods of 42.1 ± 18 and 43.2 ± 19 months by endoscopy and contrast abdominal CT scan. In 197 AGC patients, 59 patients (29.8%) had confirmed tumor recurrence during mean follow-up periods of 40.5 ± 21 and 45.3 ± 22 months. The most common pattern of tumor recurrence was distant metastasis (n = 35) followed by peritoneal metastasis (n = 11). Among the other 13 cases with loco-regional recurrence, seven cases were regional lymph node metastases, four were anastomosis site recurrences, and two were duodenal stump and jejunal loop site recurrences. Three of the four cases of anastomosis site recurrence were found by both endoscopy and contrast abdominal CT scan; one case was missed by contrast abdominal CT scan. However, the two cases with duodenal stump and jejunal loop recurrences were detected by contrast abdominal CT scan only. An annual follow-up endoscopy for gastric cancer after TG might have a limited role in the detection of tumor recurrence, especially in patients with EGC.

https://openalex.org/W2805194804,"Pheromones, low molecular weight chemical entities that bind to pheromone carrier proteins, are chemical signals that play an important role in the communication system in animals. This has been rather fairly well-studied in the rodents. The preputial gland, a rich source of pheromones in many rodents, contains a low molecular mass protein (18–20 kDa) that acts as one such pheromone carrier. However, the presence of this protein in the notorious rodent pest Millardia meltada has not yet been proven. Therefore, we aimed at identifying this protein, and the pheromones that are bound to it, in this rodent so as to utilize the information in the control of this pest. Twenty volatile compounds were identified in the preputial gland using GC-MS. Total protein of the gland was fractioned by both one and two-dimensional electrophoresis when we identified a low molecular mass protein (19 kDa, pI-4.7). Adopting MALDI-TOF MS and LC-MS analyses, the protein was confirmed as α 2u-globulin. To identify the volatiles bound to this protein, we used column chromatography and GC-MS. We found that farnesol and 6-methyl-1-heptanol are the volatiles that would bind to the protein, which we propose to be putative pheromones. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed localization of α 2u-globulin in the acinar cells of the preputial gland. Thus, we show that α 2u-globulin, a pheromone-carrier protein, is present in the preputial gland acinar cells of M. meltada and suggest farnesol and 6-methyl-1-heptanol to be the volatiles which would bind to it. The α 2u-globulin together with farnesol and 6-methyl-1-heptanol contribute to pheromonal communication of M. meltada."

Thirty-six participants were recruited. Anthropometric measurements and handgrip strength were taken with blood analyses completed utilizing 25-hydroxyvitamin D assay. A dietary screening survey was used to assess calcium and vitamin D intake. All data collection was completed at time of assessment appointment. Statistical analyses completed utilized Pearson's and Kendall's Tau correlation, with level of significance set at p < 0.05. Twenty-two percent of our sample were 25(OH)D deficient and 33% 25(OH)D insufficient, with 16% consuming adequate vitamin D and 5% consuming adequate calcium. Eight of the females and one male had below average DXA assessments for bone health. Vitamin D intake was significantly correlated with serum 25(OH)D levels (τ = 0.29, p<0.01). In females there was an inverse relationship between 25(OH)D and weight (r = -0.45, p<0.05). Thirty-one percent of participants had higher than desirable waist circumference and were 25(OH)D insufficient or deficient. This sample had a high rate of 25(OH)D insufficiency and deficiency, with most not consuming adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin D. Normalizing serum 25(OH)D through food and supplements has the potential to positively impact several parameters of an individual's health including weight status, visceral adiposity and waist circumference, and bone health."
