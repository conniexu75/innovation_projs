https://openalex.org/W1983543277,"We used molecular dynamics simulations with system sizes up to 100 million atoms to simulate plastic deformation of nanocrystalline copper. By varying the grain size between 5 and 50 nanometers, we show that the flow stress and thus the strength exhibit a maximum at a grain size of 10 to 15 nanometers. This maximum is because of a shift in the microscopic deformation mechanism from dislocation-mediated plasticity in the coarse-grained material to grain boundary sliding in the nanocrystalline region. The simulations allow us to observe the mechanisms behind the grain-size dependence of the strength of polycrystalline metals."
https://openalex.org/W2066727453,"Both dauer formation (a stage of developmental arrest) and adult life-span in Caenorhabditis elegans are negatively regulated by insulin-like signaling, but little is known about cellular pathways that mediate these processes. Autophagy, through the sequestration and delivery of cargo to the lysosomes, is the major route for degrading long-lived proteins and cytoplasmic organelles in eukaryotic cells. Using nematodes with a loss-of-function mutation in the insulin-like signaling pathway, we show that bec-1, the C. elegans ortholog of the yeast and mammalian autophagy gene APG6/VPS30/beclin1, is essential for normal dauer morphogenesis and life-span extension. Dauer formation is associated with increased autophagy and also requires C. elegans orthologs of the yeast autophagy genes APG1, APG7, APG8, and AUT10. Thus, autophagy is a cellular pathway essential for dauer development and life-span extension in C. elegans."
https://openalex.org/W2045762639,"Here we present evidence that Centaurea maculosa (spotted knapweed), an invasive species in the western United States, displaces native plant species by exuding the phytotoxin (-)-catechin from its roots. Our results show inhibition of native species' growth and germination in field soils at natural concentrations of (-)-catechin. In susceptible species such as Arabidopsis thaliana, the allelochemical triggers a wave of reactive oxygen species (ROS) initiated at the root meristem, which leads to a Ca2+ signaling cascade triggering genome-wide changes in gene expression and, ultimately, death of the root system. Our results support a ""novel weapons hypothesis"" for invasive success."

Proteins detected by multidimensional protein identification technology in the cofractionating organelles were subtracted from the NE data set. In addition to all 13 known NE integral proteins, 67 uncharacterized open reading frames with predicted membrane-spanning regions were identified. All of the eight proteins tested targeted to the NE, indicating that there are substantially more integral proteins of the NE than previously thought. Furthermore, 23 of these mapped within chromosome regions linked to a variety of dystrophies."
https://openalex.org/W1995732138,"The earliest of a series of copper efflux genes in Escherichia coli are controlled by CueR, a member of the MerR family of transcriptional activators. Thermodynamic calibration of CueR reveals a zeptomolar (10(-21) molar) sensitivity to free Cu+, which is far less than one atom per cell. Atomic details of this extraordinary sensitivity and selectivity for +1transition-metal ions are revealed by comparing the crystal structures of CueR and a Zn2+-sensing homolog, ZntR. An unusual buried metal-receptor site in CueR restricts the metal to a linear, two-coordinate geometry and uses helix-dipole and hydrogen-bonding interactions to enhance metal binding. This binding mode is rare among metalloproteins but well suited for an ultrasensitive genetic switch."
https://openalex.org/W2020136368,"The finding that microbial communities are active under snow has changed the estimated global rates of biogeochemical processes beneath seasonal snow packs. We used microbiological and molecular techniques to elucidate the phylogenetic composition of undersnow microbial communities in Colorado, the United States. Here, we show that tundra soil microbial biomass reaches its annual peak under snow, and that fungi account for most of the biomass. Phylogenetic analysis of tundra soil fungi revealed a high diversity of fungi and three novel clades that constitute major new groups of fungi (divergent at the subphylum or class level). An abundance of previously unknown fungi that are active beneath the snow substantially broadens our understanding of both the diversity and biogeochemical functioning of fungi in cold environments."
https://openalex.org/W2036204058,"A high-resolution western tropical Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) record from the Cariaco Basin on the northern Venezuelan shelf, based on Mg/Ca values in surface-dwelling planktonic foraminifera, reveals that changes in SST over the last glacial termination are synchronous, within +/-30 to +/-90 years, with the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 air temperature proxy record and atmospheric methane record. The most prominent deglacial event in the Cariaco record occurred during the Younger Dryas time interval, when SSTs dropped by 3 degrees to 4 degrees C. A rapid southward shift in the atmospheric intertropical convergence zone could account for the synchroneity of tropical temperature, atmospheric methane, and high-latitude changes during the Younger Dryas."
https://openalex.org/W2038273638,"Single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy was used to determine the electronic properties of individual single-walled carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotube structure was determined simultaneously from Raman spectroscopy. Fluorescence spectra from individual nanotubes with identical structures have different emission energies and linewidths that likely arise from defects or the local environment. Unlike most other molecules studied to date, the fluorescence intensity or spectrum from a single nanotube unexpectedly did not fluctuate."
https://openalex.org/W2092761439,"Artificial nanostructures, each composed of a copper(II) phthalocyanine (CuPc) molecule bonded to two gold atomic chains with a controlled gap, were assembled on a NiAl(110) surface by manipulation of individual gold atoms and CuPc molecules with a scanning tunneling microscope. The electronic densities of states of these hybrid structures were measured by spatially resolved electronic spectroscopy and systematically tuned by varying the number of gold atoms in the chains one by one. The present approach provides structural images and electronic characterization of the metal-molecule-metal junction, thereby elucidating the nature of the contacts between the molecule and metal in this junction."
https://openalex.org/W2122003337,"In vertebrates, genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), with their pronounced polymorphism, potentially represent outstanding examples for the selective advantages of genetic diversity (1). Theoretical models predicted that, within an individual, MHC alleles can be subjected to two opposing selective forces, resulting in an optimal number of genes at intermediate individual MHC diversity (2, 3). Diversifying selection increases heterozygosity and enables wider recognition of pathogens (4). This process is opposed by the need to delete T cells that react with self peptide–MHC combinations (5) from the repertoire, which has been proposed as a possible mechanism constraining expansion of MHC genes. Because too high MHC diversity might delimit T cell diversity, it might also impose limitations on the efficiency of pathogen recognition. However, empirical evidence demonstrating fitness benefits in terms of parasite resistance caused by this type of optimal MHC diversity has been lacking. Therefore, we tested whether three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.) carrying an intermediate level of individual MHC diversity also displayed the strongest level of resistance against parasite infection. Sticklebacks are particularly suited to test MHC optimality, because MHC class II genotypes can differ markedly in the number of MHC class IIB alleles (6). We caught fish from an outbred population and used these to breed six sibships of immunologically naive fish (i.e., they had no previous contact to parasites). Immunogenetic diversity ranged from three to nine MHC class IIB alleles found in reverse-transcribed messenger RNA (mRNA) [see (6) for details on genotyping]. The MHC genotypes within these sibships segregated above and below the hypothesized optimal number of ∼5 MHC class IIB alleles, which had previously been estimated in an epidemiological field survey (7). In individual infection treatments, fish from all sibships were simultaneously exposed to three of the most abundant parasite species identified in the field (Fig. 1A) (8). After two rounds of infection, separated by an interval of 8 weeks, we found a significant minimal mean infection rate at an intermediate number of individual MHC class IIB variants [i.e., 5.82 expressed alleles (Fig. 1B)]. This result was also confirmed when sibships were considered separately [i.e., 4.96 alleles (Fig. 1C)] (9). The strong pattern only appeared when infection with all three parasites was accounted for simultaneously. This may not be surprising, because single alleles are expected to correlate with single diseases and multiple alleles can contribute to resistance against several infectious agents (2)."

The C1q/human IgG1 model suggests a critical role for the hinge region of IgG and for the relative orientation of its Fab domain in C1q binding. Innate immunity involves a combination of cell-surface receptors and soluble proteins with the ability to recognize microbial pathogens and thereby to generate signals that both orientate subsequent adaptive immune responses and trigger effector mechanisms (1Fearon D.T. Locksley R.M. Science. 1996; 272: 50-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar, 2Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway C.A. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Science. 1999; 284: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar). Most of these molecules are oligomeric and recognize molecular patterns on microorganisms (3Janeway C.A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1989; 54: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An archetypal molecule of this type is C1q, the recognition subunit of C1, the complex that triggers activation of the classical pathway of complement, a major element of innate immunity. C1q is a 460-kDa protein with the overall shape of a bouquet of flowers, comprising six heterotrimeric collagen-like triple helices that associate in their N-terminal half to form a “stalk,” then diverge to form individual “stems”, each terminating in a C-terminal heterotrimeric globular domain (4Kishore U. Reid K.B.M. Immunopharmacology. 2000; 49: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). It is well documented that most of the C1 complex ligands are recognized by these peripheral globular domains, or heads, of C1q, thus triggering activation of C1r and C1s, the proteases associated with C1q (5Arlaud G.J. Gaboriaud C. Thielens N.M. Budayova-Spano M. Rossi V. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 39: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It is also established that C1q binds to immune complexes containing IgG or IgM, but not to those having IgA, IgD, or IgE (6Cooper N.R. Adv. Immunol. 1985; 37: 151-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The major C1q binding site on IgG has been mapped to the CH2 domain of the Fc portion of the molecule (7Burton D.R. Boyd J. Brampton A.D. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Emanuel E.J. Novotny J. Rademacher T.W. van Schravendijk M.R. Dwek R.A. Nature. 1980; 288: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 8Duncan A.R.

Immunol. 2000; 164: 4178-4184Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Although C1q shows marked differences in its reactivity toward IgG subclasses, the reason for this selectivity is not known. C1q is traditionally known for its ability to bind antibodies. However, it recognizes an amazing variety of other ligands. These include certain bacteria, viruses, parasites, and mycoplasma (6Cooper N.R. Adv. Immunol. 1985; 37: 151-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 10Thielens N.M. Tacnet-Delorme P.

Immun. 1977; 15: 7-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), underscoring its role as an antibody-independent defense protein. C1q also binds to C-reactive protein (CRP) 1The abbreviations used are: CRPC-reactive proteinMes4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidr.m.s.d.root mean square distanceACRP-30adipocyte complement-related protein-30. when complexed with exposed phosphocholine residues on bacteria, providing a further means of host defense (13Szalai A.J. Agrawal A. Greenhough T.J. Volanakis J.E. Clin. Chem. Lab. Med. 1999; 37: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). C1q is also capable of recognizing aberrant structures from self. Thus, in addition to cellular debris and sub-cellular membranes (14Storrs S.B. Kolb W.P. Pinckard R.N. Olson M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10924-10929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is established that C1q binds to, and induces clearance of, apoptotic cells (15Navratil J.S. Watkins S.C. Wisnieski J.J. Ahearn J.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3231-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), thereby playing a major role in immune tolerance. Recent studies also indicate that abnormal proteins such as β-amyloid fibrils (16Rogers J. Cooper N.R. Webster S. Schultz J. McGeer P.L. Styren S.D. Civin W.H. Brachova L Bradt B. Ward P.

There are no obvious structural features shared by these ligands, but the fact that many polyanions are C1q ligands (6Cooper N.R. Adv. Immunol. 1985; 37: 151-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) suggests that C1q may function as a charge pattern recognition molecule. C-reactive protein 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid root mean square distance adipocyte complement-related protein-30. The globular domain of C1q is a heterotrimeric association of protein modules known as gC1q domains found at the C-terminal end of various proteins, including types VIII and X collagens, the adipocyte complement-related protein (ACRP)-30, precerebellin and, multimerin (4Kishore U. Reid K.B.M. Immunopharmacology. 2000; 49: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The structures of the globular domains of ACRP-30 (20Shapiro L. Scherer P.E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 8: 335-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and collagen X (21Bogin O. Kvansakul M. Rom E. Singer J. Yayon A. Hohenester E. Structure (Lond.). 2002; 10: 165-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) have been solved by x-ray crystallography, revealing the gC1q fold and indicating that both are homotrimers held together by both hydrophobic and polar interfaces. We report here the x-ray structure of the heterotrimeric globular head of C1q, the domain responsible for the versatile recognition properties of this protein. The structure reveals how three different gC1q modules achieve an assembly homologous to, but structurally more diverse than, the one observed in homotrimers and provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of the recognition function of C1q. Preparation and Analysis of the C1q Globular Domain—C1q was purified from human serum as described previously (22Arlaud G.J. Sim R.B. Duplaa A.-M. Colomb M.G. Mol. Immunol. 1979; 16: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and digested with Achromobacter iophagus collagenase (Roche Applied Science) (enzyme/protein ratio = 0.2, w/w) for 24 h at 37 °C in 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, in the presence of 10 μm E64 and 10 μm leupeptin (Roche Applied Science). The resulting globular domain was treated with Clostridium perfringens type X neuraminidase (Sigma) (0.2 units/mg) for 5 h at 25 °C and then further incubated in the presence of 50 μm iodoacetamide for 1 h at 25 °C. The material was dialyzed against 25 mm NaCl, 50 mm Mes, pH 6.5, and loaded onto a 6-ml Resource S column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in the same buffer. Purification was achieved by applying a 600-ml linear gradient from 25 to 80 mm NaCl in the same buffer. N-terminal sequence analysis of the purified C1q globular domain was performed after SDS-PAGE and electrotransfer using an Applied Biosystems model 477 A protein sequencer as described previously (23Rossi V. Gaboriaud C. Lacroix M. Ulrich J. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Gagnon J. Arlaud G.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7311-7321Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry analysis was performed using the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization technique on a Voyager Elite XL instrument (PerSeptive Biosystems, Cambridge, MA) under conditions described previously (24Lacroix M. Rossi V. Gaboriaud C. Chevallier S. Jaquinod M. Thielens N.M. Gagnon J. Arlaud G.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6270-6282Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Crystallization and Data Collection—The protein was concentrated to 3-5 mg/ml in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 2% glycerol, and 100 mm non-detergent Sulfobetaine 195 as a solubilizing agent (25Vuillard L. Rabilloud T. Leberman R. Berthet-Colominas C. Cusack S.A FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 294-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Crystals were obtained at 20 °C in hanging drops containing 0.2-0.4% agarose, 2-3 μl of the protein solution, and 2 μl of the reservoir solution (28-41% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mm CaCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Several native and derivative data sets in various space groups were collected using different European synchrotron radiation facility beamlines. The native data set used to refine the structure (Table I) was collected on the D2AM beamline of the European synchrotron radiation facility (26Ferrer J.-L. Simon J.-P. Bérar J.-F. Caillot B. Fanchon E. Kaïkati O. Arnaud S. Guidotti M. Pirocchi M. Roth M. J.

Diffraction data were collected on this soaked crystal on the BM30 beamline of the European synchrotron radiation facility up to 2.6-Å resolution around the platinum LIII absorption edge (1.064-1.072 Å). Integration of this data set indicated that the crystal had a triclinic P1 space group (a = 48.33 Å, b = 48.42 Å, c = 88.57 Å, α = 91.74°, β = 92.70°, γ = 113.54°), with satisfactory overall statistics (Rsym = 0.04; 92% completeness) but with only 60% completeness of the anomalous signal. Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure was solved by molecular replacement using AMoRe (28Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) in two steps using the multiple sequence alignment of various C1q modules as a guide. First, the ACRP-30 structure (20Shapiro L. Scherer P.E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 8: 335-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar) was used as a model to solve the platinum derivative in the P1 space group, with two trimers per asymmetric unit. This derivative, with two platinum sites per trimer, allowed us to distinguish the three, A, B, C, chains; indeed, it appeared that each of the two platinum sites was close to a methionine residue (MetA104 and MetB122), which in each case was present in only one of the three homologous chains (see Fig. 2B). The model was reduced to its core structure (where the electron density was clear) and then refined carefully using CNS (29Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) starting from rigid body refinement of the individual position of each chain followed by a round of simulated annealing and minimization using strong non-crystallographic restraints on the corresponding A, B, C chains. This model was then used to solve the structure of the highest resolution C2 space group data set by molecular replacement, with only one trimer per asymmetric unit (Table I). The models of the ACRP-30 and collagen X structures were superimposed on this minimal model to help tracing and building the complete C1q globular head structure. The automated refinement procedure (30Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 5: 458-463Crossref Scopus (2565) Google Scholar) was used to improve the quality of the maps and to reduce the model bias. Model building was easily carried out into very clear electron density maps using program O (31Jones T.A. Zhou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Refinement was done using CNS (29Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S.

D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) except for the very last steps, which were performed using REFMAC (32Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) after the introduction of water molecules and of alternative conformations for some amino acids in the model. The following residues have a disordered side chain and have been modeled as Ala: GlnA90, ArgA92, GlnA160, ThrB92, GlnB93, ArgB108, ArgB109, ArgB150, ArgB163, GlnB165, LysC89. Atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data bank with accession code 1PK6. C1q Modeling—The C1q collagen-like stem model is based on published statistical information derived from collagen-like structures (33Rainey J.K. Goh M.C. A Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2748-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The relative positioning of the collagen triplets of the A, B, and C chains in the triple helix is the only one compatible with the N-terminal ends of the present globular domain structure. The conformational parameters for amino-rich regions (33Rainey J.K. Goh M.C. A Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2748-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) were used for the modeling of segments A40-A48, A55-A60, and A78-A87 and of the corresponding segments B42-B50, B57-B62, B80-B89, C39-C47, C54-C59, and C77-C86. The conformational parameters for imino-rich regions were used for the other segments. The globular domains were equally spaced in a circle with a radius of ∼100 Å (34Kilchherr E. Hofmann H. Steigemann W. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 186: 403-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The collagen-like arms were oriented in a symmetrical convergent arrangement toward the center and rotated in such a way as to position the 36-39-insertion segment of the A chain at the exterior of the kink structure (34Kilchherr E. Hofmann H. Steigemann W. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 186: 403-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Modeling the C1q-IgG1 and C1q-CRP Interactions—Models of the C1q globular domain interacting with two of its physiological targets with known x-ray structures, human C-reactive protein (35Thompson D.

In each case the mutagenesis data delimiting the C1q binding site (see “Discussion”) were taken into account to select the most plausible model. In addition, the position of the C1q globular domain structure was restrained to orientations where the collagen arms had no steric clashes with either the targets or the underlying surface. To take into account these various constraints, the two structures were first manually positioned using program O (31Jones T.A. Zhou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Proteins. 2003; 52: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) was used to search for solutions in a more exhaustive and objective way. Hex calculates interaction energies that include a hydrophobic excluded volume model derived from the notion of overlapping surface skins with or without soft electrostatic potential complementarity. Bad contacts at the main-chain level are checked by the program. Because most of the solutions obtained from a free rotation of the C1q globular domain were not compatible with the above selection criteria, the search was restricted to the ligand orbit protocol. The initial C1q-CRP model was built manually by positioning residues LysA200, TyrB175, and LysC170 from the top of the C1q head directed toward CRP residues AspC112, TyrE175, and AspB112, respectively. In this configuration, several additional interactions occur between CRP and the periphery of the C1q head. This solution was slightly improved by the docking program. Alternative solutions found by this program were rejected either because of steric conflict between proline side chains or because the resulting position of the collagen arms was incorrect. Moreover, in these alternative models the C1q globular head was too far from the CRP residues experimentally found to contact C1q (40Agrawal A. Shrive A.K. Greenhough T.J. Volanakis J.E. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3998-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Because CRP is supposed to have a proper 5-fold axis of symmetry, the C1q head could in principle interact in one of five equivalent orientations, i.e. C1q TyrB175 could interact with Tyr175 of the A, B, C, D, or E CRP subunit. These supposedly equivalent configurations were generated using program O and assessed with the docking program Hex. Indeed, as shown in Table II, the corresponding solutions are not equivalent because the CRP structure actually only has pseudo 5-fold symmetry and because these solutions are under severe restricting steric constraints. The solution displayed on Fig. 4 is the top one in Table II, with Tyr175 of CRP subunits A and D at hydrogen-bond distance from C1q residues TyrB175 and LysA200, respectively, and CRP TyrE175 at 4 Å from C1q TrpA147.Table IIScores for suitable C1q-ligand complex models obtained using the docking program HexC1q ligand (PDB code)E totalaTotal energy (b+c)E shapebScored shape complementarityE forcecScored electrostatic interactionsr.m.s.d.

The interaction between C1q and IgG is known to involve a major ionic component (7Burton D.R. Boyd J. Brampton A.D. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Emanuel E.J. Novotny J.

Presta L.G. Gazzano-Santoro H. Totpal K. Wong P.Y. Ultsch M. Meng Y.G. Mulkerrin M.G. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4178-4184Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 42Hezareh M. Hessel A.J.

With respect to C1q, the binding site involves Arg residues but no Lys residue (7Burton D.R. Boyd J. Brampton A.D. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Emanuel E.J. Novotny J. Rademacher T.W. van Schravendijk M.R. Dwek R.A. Nature. 1980; 288: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 43Comis A. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 842: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and ArgA162, ArgB114, ArgB129, ArgB163, and ArgC156 have been identified as possible interaction sites (44Marqués G. Anton L.C. Barrio E. Sanchez A. Ruiz A. Gavilanes F. Vivanco F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10393-10402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the C1q globular head structure reveals that both ArgA162 and ArgC156 are already engaged in internal salt bridges with AspA191 and GluC187, respectively, and are therefore unlikely to be available for protein-protein interaction. Other studies based on expression of the individual A, B, and C modules of C1q indicate that, although both modules A and B show significant binding to IgG, only the latter has marked binding selectivity for IgG relative to IgM (45Kojouharova M. Panchev I.D. Tchorbadjeva M.I. Reid K.B.M. Hoppe H.-J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4325-4331PubMed Google Scholar, 46Kishore U. Leigh L.E. Eggleton P. Strong P. Perdikoulis M.V. Willis A.C. Reid K.B.M.

Immunol. 2003; 171: 812-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Taken together the above information led us to the working hypothesis that most of the C1q residues involved in IgG recognition are contributed by module B. The initial model was built manually by positioning the IgG residues Asp270 and Lys322 facing C1q residues ArgB129 and GluB162, respectively. A cluster of similar models (within 3-Å r.m.s.d. from each other) was obtained with the docking program, and no other alternative solution was found that meets the selection criteria mentioned above. In the proposed model(s), additional ionic interactions possibly form between C1q residues ArgB114 and ArgB161 and IgG residues GluM195 and Glu287, and several hydrophobic residues of C1q (IleB103, ValB105) and IgG (LeuM154, ProM204) show a decreased access to the solvent in the assembly. The IgG residues Glu333 and Lys326 restrict the access of C1q GluB162 and ArgB129, respectively, and improved values are obtained when these two residues are converted to Ala in the computation (Table II). Although these computed differences are exaggerated because the two models are arbitrarily kept rigid to simplify the modeling process, they are coherent with the observed effects of the corresponding mutations (see “Discussion”). Overall Structure—The C-terminal globular domain of C1q was obtained after digestion of the collagenous part of the protein with collagenase, treated with sialidase, and purified by ion-exchange chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” N-terminal sequence analysis of the purified material after separation of the three chains by SDS-PAGE yielded the following sequences: Gly-Asn-Ile-Lys-Asp-Gln (A chain), Gly-Pro-(OH)Lys-Gly-Glu-Ser (B chain), and Gly-Glu-Pro-Gly-Glu-Glu (C chain). Analysis by mass spectrometry yielded three major peaks with mass values of 17,339 ± 20 Da (A chain), 16,812 ± 20 Da (B chain), and 15,600 ± 20 Da (C chain). Both analyses were consistent with each other and indicated that the purified material comprised residues Gly85-Ala223 of the A chain, Gly81-Ala226 of the B chain, and Gly78-Asp217 of the C chain. The crystal structure of the C1q globular domain was solved by molecular replacement and refined to 1.9-Å resolution. The final Rwork and Rfree factors are 0.199 and 0.238, respectively, and the refined model has excellent stereochemistry (Table I). Residues GlnA90 to SerA222, ThrB92 to AspB223, and LysC89 to AspC217 show clear and continuous electron densities, with only a few disordered side chains (see “Experimental Procedures”). The N-terminal collagen-like triplets not digested by collagenase are absent from the electron density map and, consequently, were not included in the model. The structure reveals a tight heterotrimeric assembly with non-crystallographic pseudo-3-fold symmetry, the subunits arranged clockwise in the order A, B, C when viewed from the top (Fig. 1A). The assembly exhibits a globular, almost spherical structure with a diameter of about 50 Å (Fig. 1B). As observed in the case of the ACRP-30 and collagen X homotrimers (20Shapiro L. Scherer P.E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 8: 335-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 21Bogin O. Kvansakul M. Rom E. Singer J. Yayon A. Hohenester E. Structure (Lond.). 2002; 10: 165-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the N and C termini of the three subunits emerge at the base of the trimer. A further feature reminiscent of the collagen X structure (21Bogin O. Kvansakul M. Rom E. Singer J. Yayon A. Hohenester E. Structure (Lond.). 2002; 10: 165-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) is the presence of a Ca2+ ion bound to the apical side of the trimer (Fig. 1B). The subunit structure shows a 10-stranded β sandwich with a jellyroll topology homologous to the one described initially for tumor necrosis factor (48Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. Walker N.P. Nature. 1989; 338: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 49Eck M.J. Sprang S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17595-17605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), consisting of two five-stranded β-sheets (A′, A, H, C, F) and (B′, B, G, D, E), each made of anti-parallel strands (Fig. 2A). Compared with each other the C1q subunits show r.m.s.d. values of 0.73-0.94 Å, based on their overall structures, and of only 0.56-0.71 Å, based on the β-strands. These comparisons indicate strong conservation of the latter and significant variability in the loops, particularly A-A′ and G-H on the apical side (Fig. 2A). Compared with ACRP-30 and collagen X, the β-sheets of the C1q modules show r.m.s.d. values of 0.59-0.70 Å, indicating strong structural homology within the gC1q family. The free cysteines homologous to those found in ACRP-30 and collagen X (Fig. 2B) are essentially buried in the structure, consistent with the fact that they are not alkylated, despite treatment of the protein with iodoacetamide (see “Experimental Procedures”). A specific feature of the C1q modules is that they contain two extra cysteines that form a disulfide bond (Cys150-Cys168 in module A) (Fig. 2B). These cystei"

This effect has previously been attributed to the ability of GAr to inhibit its own proteasomal degradation. Here we show, both in vitro and in vivo, that GAr also inhibits messenger RNA translation of EBNA1 in cis and that this effect can be distinguished from its effect on proteasomal degradation. Hence, inhibition of messenger RNA translation, but not protein degradation, is essential to prevent antigen presentation on MHC class I molecules. Thus, by minimizing translation of the EBNA1 transcript, cells expressing EBNA1 avoid cytotoxic T cell recognition. At the same time, blocking degradation maintains the EBNA1 expression level."

Clathrin-coated vesicles move cell surface receptors to endosomes and return some of them through recycling endosomes back to the plasma membrane (1Brodsky F.M. Chen C.Y. Knuehl C. Towler M.C.

Moreover, clathrin coats are also involved in the sorting of mono-ubiquitinated proteins into internal vesicles of multivesicular endosomes (MVE) (3Stahl, P. D., and Barbieri, M. A. (2002) Science's STKE http:/stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2002/141/pe32Google Scholar). MVE play an essential role in the down-regulation of signaling receptors such as the activated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (4Katzmann D.J. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 2001; 106: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Principal structural components of plasma membrane-derived clathrin-coated vesicles are clathrin that consists of three heavy and three light chains and the heterotetrameric adaptor protein AP-2 composed of α, β2, μ2, and σ2 subunits. The structurally related AP-1 adaptor complex is found mainly in the TGN (5Stoorvogel W. Oorschot V. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The clathrin coat on MVE does not include any of the conventional adaptor complexes (AP-1, AP-2, or AP-3) (6Sachse M. Urbe S. Oorschot V. Strous G.J. Klumperman J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1313-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), but labels positive for the clathrin binding protein Hrs (hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate) (7Raiborg C. Bache K.G. Mehlum A. Stang E. Stenmark H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5008-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In addition to adaptors a number of accessory proteins are involved in clathrin coat assembly on the plasma membrane. These include Eps15 and the ENTH domain proteins epsin, CALM, and its neuronal homolog AP180. Epsin and CALM/AP180 can associate through their ENTH domain with the rare membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), which might define the sites of coat assembly (8Ford M.G.

In general, short protein-protein interaction motifs determine the specificity of the interactions between endocytic proteins with clathrin and adaptors (19Dell'Angelica E.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 315-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The interaction of the more widely expressed AP180 homolog CALM with AP-2 is not as well documented yet (20Tebar F. Bohlander S.K. Sorkin A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2687-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Apart from the ENTH domain, the polypeptide chain of both, epsin and AP180, are largely disordered (21Kalthoff C. Alves J. Urbanke C. Knorr R. Ungewickell E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 8209-8216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This property might allow the efficient recruitment of AP-2 and clathrin to sites of coat assembly. In fact it was recently demonstrated that the proteins AP180, AP-2, and clathrin are sufficient to induce clathrin-coated buds on PIP2-containing monolayers (8Ford M.G. Pearse B.M. Higgins M.K.

Other endocytic accessory proteins such as HIP1/HIP1R and intersectin are linking clathrin-mediated endocytosis to the actin-based cytoskeleton (reviewed in Ref. 43Qualmann B. Kessels M.M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 220: 93-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The function of novel putative endocytic proteins discovered in the past by homology searches, proteomic approaches, yeast two-hybrid screens or other means was mostly confirmed by their inhibitory effects on receptor internalization when overexpressed as dominant negative variants. While this clearly indicates an involvement of the overexpressed protein in endocytosis, it often tells little about the stage in the endocytic process where a particular protein is needed. Clathrin coat formation seems to be governed by a complex web of reversible protein-protein interactions that engage under tight temporal and spatial regulation. Overexpression of almost any component of the endocytic machinery often results in its complete collapse due to the unregulated sequestration of one or more interaction partners. Therefore, alternative approaches have been developed that aim at the elimination of select components or of their genes. Among the most powerful methodologies for reducing the cellular concentration of proteins is RNA interference (RNAi). Recently this technique was adopted to mammalian cells where the transfection of 21-nucleotide RNA duplexes with two nucleotide 3′ overhang resulted in the specific degradation of cognate mRNA and thus in the depletion of the encoded protein (44Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8161) Google Scholar). Here we employed RNAi in HeLa cells to reduce the cellular concentration of the clathrin heavy chain and that of the AP-2 α-adaptin subunit. The transfected cells were examined by immunofluorescence, Western blotting, cell fractionation, electron microscopy, and functional endocytosis assays. Our results indicated that both proteins were efficiently depleted from the transfected cells within 48 h. The knockdown of clathrin heavy chain was paralleled by the disappearance of clathrin light chains. Residual clathrin on the plasma membrane was mainly found in shallow coated pits. The membrane association of the endocytic proteins AP-2, CALM, and epsin was only marginally affected. Transferrin uptake was strongly inhibited in the knockdown cells, but the uptake of EGF appeared to be normal. However, intracellular trafficking of the EGF was impaired. Moreover, the intracellular distribution of the early endosomal marker EEA1, of Hrs, and that of the large mannose 6-phosphate receptor was altered upon clathrin depletion. α-Adaptin depletion had a strong effect on the membrane association of both clathrin and Eps15. It also inhibited transferrin uptake but had no effect on EGF internalization. Antibodies and Reagents—Mouse monoclonal antibodies used for immunofluorescence were as follows: X22, anti-clathrin heavy chain (45Chin D.J. Straubinger R.M. Acton S. Nathke I. Brodsky F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9289-9293Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); AP.6, anti-α-adaptin (46Brodsky F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2055-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); monoclonal antibody 100/3, anti-γ-adaptin, (47Ahle S. Mann A. Eichelsbacher U. Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar); anti-EEA1 (BD Biosciences, catalog number 610456). Mouse monoclonal antibodies used for Western blotting were as follows: monoclonal antibody 100/1 anti-β-adaptin (47Ahle S. Mann A. Eichelsbacher U. Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), anti-clathrin heavy chain (BD Biosciences, catalog number 610500), anti-α-adaptin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number sc-17771, Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-μ2 (AP-50 from BD Biosciences). Rabbit polyconal antibodies for immunofluorescence and Western blotting were as follows: affinity-purified R461 directed against clathrin light chains (47Ahle S. Mann A. Eichelsbacher U. Ungewickell E. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 919-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Antisera directed against CALM were raised against the peptide CRPPNPFGPVPGAAQIQFM, and antisera directed against Eps15 were raised against the peptide CQEDLELAIALSKSEISEA. To generate an antibody against epsin, the peptide CEERIRRGDDLRLQMA was used as antigen. Peptide synthesis and custom immunizations were performed by BioScience (Göttingen, Germany). Actin was detected on Western blots by the affinity-purified serum R442-6 raised against bovine actin in our laboratory. For most applications the polyclonal sera were affinity-purified using the respective peptides attached to Sulfo-link resin (Pierce). The purified antibodies were eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5. The polyclonal rabbit antibody against the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor was obtained from B. Hoflack (Max-Planck-Institut für Zellbiologie und Genetik, Dresden, Germany). A polyclonal rabbit antibody against EEA1 was from M. Zerial (Max-Planck-Institut für Zellbiologie und Genetik, Dresden, Germany) and H. Stenmark (Oslo, Norway) provided the polyclonal rabbit serum against Hrs. A second polyclonal rabbit antibody against epsin that was used for staining epsin in cells was obtained from L. Traub (Pittsburgh, PA) (17Drake M.T. Downs M.A. Traub L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6479-6489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Fluorescein isothiocyanate and rhodamine-labeled anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies were from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies were from ICN (Aurora, OH). Biotin-labeled transferrin (Molecular Probes) was detected by NeutrAvidin coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Molecular Probes). Texas Red-labeled EGF and Texas Red-labeled transferrin were from Molecular Probes. 125I-labeled EGF (6.25 MBq/μg) was obtained from New England Nuclear/PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Zaventem, Belgium). siRNA—The clathrin heavy chain siRNAs (AACCUGCGGUCUGGAGUCAAC, HC oligo I, and AAUGGAUCUCUUUGAAUACGG, HC oligo II) was obtained from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). The α-adaptin siRNA (GAGCAUGUGCACGCUGGCCAGCU, α-oligo I) was purchased from Proligo (Hamburg, Germany), and a second α-adaptin siRNA (AAGAGGUGUGGUACCGAGUCA (α-oligo II)) was from Dharmacon. Firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase siRNA (AACGTTACCGCGGAATACTTCGA) was obtained from Dharmacon. Selected sequences were submitted to BLAST searches against the human genome sequence to ensure that only the desired mRNA was targeted. siRNA duplex formation was performed as described elsewhere (44Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8161) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa SS6 cells were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Seromed, Berlin, Germany), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were regularly passaged to maintain exponential growth. 24 h before transfection with siRNA the cells were trypsin-digested and resuspended at a density of 0.5–0.8 × 105 cells/ml in fresh medium containing 10% fetal calf serum but no pyruvate or antibiotics. For most experiments the cells were seeded in 24-well plates (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany). Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) was used for the delivery of siRNAs into HeLa cells following the procedure of Harborth et al. (48Harborth J. Elbashir S.M. Bechert K. Tuschl T. Weber K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4557-4565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For 3 × 104 cells 60 pmol of RNA duplex were used. Control cells were transfected with firefly luciferase siRNA. For some experiments the luciferase siRNA was omitted, because we noted that the transfection reagent was the sole cause for any transient cellular stress. The final volume of the transfection mixture was 600 μl per well. Cells were assayed 48 h after transfection unless indicated otherwise in the legends to the figures. The extent of gene silencing was assessed by Western blotting of cell lysates. To control for any differences in cell numbers the signal of the silenced protein was related to that of actin. Alternatively, in some experiments the signal originating from the targeted protein was related to total cellular protein as determined by BCA-200 protein assay (Pierce). Data shown represent averages of three independent transfection experiments performed in parallel. Western Blotting—For Western blotting siRNA-treated cells were trypsin-digested in 24-well plates at 37 °C until the cells detached. The protease was stopped with cold medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Subsequently the cells were washed with PBS and then solubilized in hot SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 9–19% gradient gels (49Lindner R. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16567-16573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and then electroblotted onto Protran nitrocellulose transfer membrane (Schleicher & Schüll, Dassel, Germany). Horseradish-conjugated secondary antibodies were visualized using the chemiluminescence reagent detection system from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Zaventem, Belgium). In case of reprobing the membrane with different primary antibodies, the membranes were stripped for 30 min at 50 °C in a buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, pH 6.7. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—For immunofluorescence cells were grown and transfected on glass cover slips which were placed in 24-well plates. For some experiments cells transfected with clathrin or α-adaptin siRNA were trypsin-digested after 24 h and mixed with approximately the same number of control cells and then replated on glass cover slips. This allowed viewing and photographing control and knockdown cells next to each other within the same field. 48 h after transfection they were fixed for 10 min at room temperature in 4% formaldehyde solution prepared by dissolving paraformaldehyde in 2.7 mm KCl, 1.9 mm KH2PO4, 8.2 mm Na2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (PBS). The fixative was either used freshly or stored in aliquots at –20 °C. After fixation the cells were washed three times with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.6 (TBS) and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in TBS for 5 min. After permeabilization the cells were washed in PBS and then incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h at 37 °C. Primary antibodies were diluted with PBS containing 3% BSA. The cover slips were thoroughly washed between the incubations with primary and secondary antibodies. The secondary antibody was also diluted with 3% BSA in PBS and the incubation time was 1 h at 37 °C. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes) (1 μm in 3% BSA/PBS) for 10 min on ice. Finally the cells were embedded in Prolong Antifade (Molecular Probes). Labeled cells were viewed with a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope equipped with Epi-fluorescence attachment (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Images were recorded with a CCD camera (Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ) using IPLab software (Scanalytics, Inc., Fairfax, VA). Final figures were arranged with Adobe Photoshop version 5.0 and Illustrator Version 8.0 (Adobe, San Jose, CA). EGF and Transferrin Uptake Assays—48 h after transfection the cells were serum starved for 30 min with medium containing 0.1% BSA at 37 °C. For immunofluorescence studies 20 μl of Texas Red-labeled EGF (10 ng/ml in culture medium supplemented with 0.1% BSA) or 20 μl of Texas Red-labeled transferrin (5 μg/ml in culture medium supplemented with 0.1% BSA), respectively, were applied to cells grown on glass coverslips and incubated for 1 h on ice. For quantitative uptake assays, 120 μl of 125I-labeled EGF (10 ng/ml) or biotin-labeled transferrin (250 ng/ml), respectively, were used per well of a 24-well plate that contained ∼105 cells. Unbound ligand was removed by quick washes with prewarmed serum free medium, and bound ligand was allowed to be internalized upon incubation in 0.1% BSA-containing medium for varies lengths of time at 37 °C. For immunofluorescence studies the cells were processed as described above. For quantitative uptake experiments unbound ligand (125I-labeled EGF or biotin-labeled transferrin) was removed by a 2.5-min incubation in 0.5 m NaCl, 0.2 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, followed by a wash cycle with the same solution (50Sorkin A. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23453-23460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells incubated with radioactively labeled EGF were then lysed in hot 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, supplemented with 1% SDS and counted in a γ-counter (Berthold BF 2111, Wildbad, Germany). Internalized biotinylated transferrin was quantitated by Western blotting using NeutrAvidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Signals were detected by chemiluminescence. Cell Fractionation—siRNA transfected HeLa cells were grown in 2-ml dishes (Nunc) for 48 h and then washed first with PBS and then with ice-cold lyses buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4) containing Complete Mini-protease inhibitor mixture (Roche, Grenzach, Germany). The cells were freeze-thawed twice in 0.3 ml of lyses buffer and collected by scraping. The suspension was centrifuged for 45 min at 90,000 × g in a Beckman Optima TL bench top ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA) at 4 °C. Both supernatant and pellet fractions were denatured in SDS-sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Electron Microscopy—siRNA transfected and control cells grown in 24-well plates were washed twice with PBS and then fixed for 30 min with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.3. Subsequently the cells were washed for 10 min with 0.5 ml of cacodylate buffer, incubated for 1 h in a solution containing 1% osmium tetroxide, and then dehydrated in an ascending series of 25, 50, 75, and 100% ethanol. The cells were detached from the surface of the well with propylenoxide, transferred to a reaction tube, pelleted, supplemented with a 1:1 mixture of Epon and propylenoxide, and incubated for 30 min at 40 °C. Next they were transferred into a solution of 25% propylenoxide and 75% Epon and incubated for 90 min at 40 °C. This was followed by an incubation for 45 min at 40 °C in pure Epon. The Epon was once more replaced and then allowed to polymerize for 20 h at 40 °C and followed by 40 h at 60 °C. 50–70-nm sections were cut using an Ultrotom III Ultramicrotom (LKB, Bromma, Sweden). Sections were placed on copper grids and contrasted with lead citrate and 10% uranyl acetate. The sections were viewed with a Zeiss EM902 electron microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Effect of Clathrin Heavy Chain Depletion on Associated Proteins—To inhibit the expression of the clathrin heavy chain, we selected an siRNA duplex that targeted the segment 3311–3333 of the heavy chain open reading frame. Control cells were transfected with a control siRNA (luciferase) or with the transfection reagent alone, because the presence of the luciferase siRNA did not affect the cells. To quantitate the reduction in clathrin heavy chain expression the transfected cells were lysed in SDS-sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies directed against the clathrin heavy chain, clathrin light chai"
https://openalex.org/W2092404030,"beta-Arrestins bind to activated seven transmembrane-spanning (7TMS) receptors (G protein-coupled receptors) after the receptors are phosphorylated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), thereby regulating their signaling and internalization. Here, we demonstrate an unexpected and analogous role of beta-arrestin 2 (betaarr2) for the single transmembrane-spanning type III transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor (TbetaRIII, also referred to as betaglycan). Binding of betaarr2 to TbetaRIII was also triggered by phosphorylation of the receptor on its cytoplasmic domain (likely at threonine 841). However, such phosphorylation was mediated by the type II TGF-beta receptor (TbetaRII), which is itself a kinase, rather than by a GRK. Association with betaarr2 led to internalization of both receptors and down-regulation of TGF-beta signaling. Thus, the regulatory actions of beta-arrestins are broader than previously appreciated, extending to the TGF-beta receptor family as well."
https://openalex.org/W2135364719,"Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) plays an important role in the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in inflammation and cell survival. In this study, we demonstrated that NF-κB-dependent gene expression was inhibited by E1A in poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase-1 knock out (PARP-1 (–/–)) cells complemented with wild type PARP-1 after tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. PARP-1 and p300 synergistically coactivated NF-κB-dependent gene expression in response to TNFα and LPS. Furthermore, PARP-1 interacted directly with p300 and enhanced the interaction of NF-κB1/p50 to p300. The C terminus, harboring the catalytic domain of PARP-1 but not its enzymatic activity, was required for complete transcriptional coactivation of NF-κB by p300 in response to TNFα and LPS. Together, these results indicate that PARP-1 acts synergistically with p300 and plays an essential regulatory role in NF-κB-dependent gene expression.

Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar and 2Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4550) Google Scholar). These proteins share a conserved 300-amino acid region within their amino termini, designated the Rel-homology domain. This domain is responsible for dimerization, nuclear translocation, DNA binding and interaction with heterologous transcription factors. The specificity of NF-κB-dependent transcription is thought to be at least partially a result of differential homo- and heterodimerization of its family members, leading to a range of DNA-binding and activation potentials. The prototypical form, NF-κB, is a heterodimer consisting of the two subunits p50 and p65. The NF-κB family plays a key role in the transcriptional regulation of a variety of genes involved in inflammatory responses and cell survival. In addition, NF-κB has been associated with neurodegenerative processes and cancer (reviewed in Refs. 3Karin M. Cao Y. Greten F.R. Li Z.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar and 4Mattson M.P. Camandola S. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). In most differentiated unstimulated cells, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm as an inactive transcription factor complex by its physical association with one of the several inhibitors of NF-κB (IκB). Treatment of cells with extracellular stimuli, such as cytokines, bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), phorbol esters (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate), UV irradiation, γ irradiation, or potent oxidants leads to the rapid phosphorylation of IκB, which results in ubiquitination of IκB and subsequent degradation by the 26 S-proteasome pathway (5Chen Z.J. Parent L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1996; 84: 853-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar, reviewed in Ref. 6Karin M. Cancer J. Sci. Am. 1998; 4: S92-S99PubMed Google Scholar). Dissociation of NF-κB and IκB unmasks the nuclear localization sequences of the p65 and p50 subunits, allowing nuclear translocation, sequence-specific binding of NF-κB to κB sites, and activation of specific subsets of genes. The number of transcriptional coactivator and cofactor families known to be involved in NF-κB-dependent gene expression is growing. The assembly of the NF-κB transcription complex is an important stage in NF-κB-dependent transcription and involves multiple coactivator/cofactor-NF-κB-DNA interactions (7Paal K. Baeuerle P.A.

PARP-1 has been shown to increase the transcriptional activity of TEF1/Max and AP-2 (22Butler A.J. Ordahl C.P. Mol. Cell.

In addition, PARP-1 has been identified as an interaction partner of several transcription factors and cofactors, including TEF-1, Oct-1, AP-2, and PC3/topoisomerase-I (22Butler A.J. Ordahl C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 23Kannan P. Yu Y. Wankhade S.

Meisterernst et al. have identified PARP-1 as an active component of the upstream factor stimulatory activity (USA)-derived positive cofactor PC1 (25Meisterernst M. Stelzer G. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2261-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Earlier studies have shown that the USA complex is essential for transcriptional activity of transcription factors such as NF-κB, SP1, and Oct-1 (26Guermah M. Malik S. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3234-3244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, several reports showed that the expression of NF-κB-dependent inflammatory genes such as TNFα, interleukin-1β, P-Selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule, and inducible nitric-oxide synthase are impaired in PARP-1(–/–) mice after treatment with inflammatory stimuli as well as in mouse models of stroke and ischemia-reperfusion (reviewed in Ref. 17Hassa P.O. Hottiger M.O. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1534-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Tulin and Spradling (27Tulin A. Spradling A. Science. 2003; 299: 560-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) recently found that Drosophila melanogaster mutants lacking normal PARP levels display immune defects similar to mice lacking the NF-κB subunit p50 (28Sha W.C. Liou H.C. Tuomanen E.I. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 321-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). Furthermore, their results imply that the role of PARP-1 in NF-κB-dependent gene expression during immune responses has been conserved during evolution (27Tulin A. Spradling A. Science. 2003; 299: 560-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). We recently provided evidence that PARP-1 can act as a coactivator for NF-κB in vivo (29Hassa P.O. Hottiger M.O. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 953-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 30Hassa P.O. Covic M. Hasan S. Imhof R. Hottiger M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45588-45597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). We showed that PARP-1 was required for specific transcriptional activation of NF-κB in response to inflammatory stimuli. PARP-1 directly interacted through different domains with both subunits of NF-κB (p65 and p50) in vitro and formed a stable immunoprecipitable nuclear complex together with p50 and p65 in vivo. Remarkably, the enzymatic activity of PARP-1 was not required for full transcriptional activation of NF-κB in response to various stimuli. The exact molecular mechanisms of these observations are not yet clear. In this study, we show that NF-κB-dependent gene expression in PARP-1(–/–) cells, transiently complemented with PARP-1, was inhibited by 12 S E1A. p300 alone was not sufficient for full transcriptional coactivation of NF-κB in these cells. The presence of PARP-1 was required for transcriptional coactivation of NF-κB in a stimuli-dependent manner. Furthermore, PARP-1 and p300 synergistically coactivated NF-κB in response to TNFα and LPS. In addition, PARP-1 formed a tight complex with p300 in vivo, and this interaction was direct in vitro. We showed that the previously described interaction of p65 with p300 was PARP-1-independent. However, the binding of PARP-1 to p300 provided an additional interaction site for p50 on p300. Further experiments revealed that the C terminus of PARP-1, but not its enzymatic activity, was required for full transcriptional coactivation. Together, these results support the hypothesis that PARP-1 acts as an essential coactivator of NF-κB in concert with p300 to facilitate the formation and subsequent activation of the pre-initiation complex (PIC) in a stimuli-dependent manner.

GST pull-down assays were performed in the presence of 100 or 75 mm NaCl (low salt) or 150 mm NaCl (high salt) as described previously (30Hassa P.O. Covic M. Hasan S. Imhof R. Hottiger M.O. J. Biol.

In Vitro Poly(ADP)-ribosylation Assays—200 ng of baculo-purified PARP-1 and 2 μg of baculo-purified p300 were incubated with 200 ng of calf thymus DNA previously treated with DNase I in 100 μl containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 nm [32P]NAD+ (100 nCi/nmol). After 10 min of incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped with hot 10× Laemmli buffer and analyzed on 8% SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, destained, dried, and autoradiographed on Kodak Bio-Max MS film. PARP-1 Coactivation of NF-κB Is Repressed by 12 S E1A— Previous studies showed that p300/CBP is an important coactivator of NF-κB. 12 S E1A was shown to bind p300/CBP and thereby inhibit NF-κB-dependent transcription. To investigate the role of p300 in PARP-1(–/–) cells, we decided to examine whether 12 S E1A would inhibit the PARP-1 coactivator activity of NF-κB in vivo. We performed transient NF-κB-dependent reporter studies in primary fibroblast cells isolated from the lung of PARP-1(–/–) mice. Primary cells were co-transfected with the artificial NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter constructs PBII- or pf-luc, containing wild-type or mutated NF-κB binding sites together with expression vectors for PARP-1 and 12 S E1A wild-type or 12 S E1A mutant and subsequently treated with the indicated stimuli (Fig. 1, A and B). Surprisingly, overexpression of wild-type 12 S E1A severely reduced NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activation by PARP-1 in primary PARP-1(–/–) cells in response to LPS and TNFα. However, overexpression of 12 S E1A mutant (12 S E1A-Δ2/36), which is unable to bind p300/CBP, did not inhibit NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activation by PARP-1. Because PARP-1 did not interact physically with 12 S E1A (data not shown), these experiments suggested that p300/CBP is likely to be functionally linked to PARP-1. PARP-1 Is Required for Transcriptional Coactivation of NF-κB by p300 in Response to LPS and TNFα—To further investigate the relevance of p300 on PARP-1 coactivated NF-κB-dependent gene expression, primary fibroblast cells isolated from the lung of PARP-1(+/+) or PARP-1(–/–) mice were transfected with the indicated NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter constructs together with expression vectors for p300 and/or PARP-1 and subsequently treated with the indicated stimuli (Fig. 2). The experiments revealed that overexpression of p300 and PARP-1 had no effect on basal NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activation in both primary PARP-1(+/+) and PARP-1(–/–) cells (Fig. 2A). Although overexpression of p300 alone augmented NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activation in primary PARP-1(+/+) cells ∼3-fold in response to LPS or TNFα (Fig. 2, B and C, left), no NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activation by p300 was observed in primary PARP-1(–/–) cells after LPS or TNFα treatment (Fig. 2, B and C, right). However, additional co-expression of p300 with PARP-1 in primary PARP-1(–/–) cells synergistically enhanced NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activation ∼11-fold in response to LPS or TNFα (Fig. 2, B and C, right). No synergistic activation was observed in PARP-1(+/+) cells, indicating that additional expression of PARP-1 in these cells did not further enhance the already observed transcriptional activation (Fig. 2, B and C, left). Together these results strongly suggested that PARP-1 and p300 are both essential and functionally linked for the transcriptional activation of NF-κB. To further support this hypothesis, transcriptional activation of NF-κB by p300/CBP-associated factor (P/CAF), a p300-associated coactivator, was tested. PARP-1 (–/–) were transfected with PARP-1, p300, and P/CAF and subsequently stimulated by TNFα or LPS (Fig. 2D and data not shown). Indeed, P/CAF additionally enhanced the above-described synergistic transcriptional coactivation of NF-κB by PARP-1 and p300 in a synergistic manner (Fig. 2D). This experiment strengthened the hypothesis that not only p300 itself but also p300-associated coactivators are regulated by PARP-1 in response to LPS or TNFα. PARP-1 Interacts with p300 in Vivo—As these results strongly suggested that p300 and PARP-1 might physically interact in vivo, we immunoprecipitated PARP-1 complexes from nuclear extracts using antibodies directed against PARP-1 and tested the presence of p300 and PARP-1 by immunoblot analysis using an anti-PARP-1 or anti-p300 antibody. p300 indeed formed a tight complex with PARP-1 (Fig. 3A, left). DNA did not mediate the association of p300 and PARP-1, because the presence of ethidium bromide or DNase1 did not affect p300/PARP-1 binding (data not shown). Reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the previous observation (Fig. 3A, right). We proceeded to map the interaction domains of p300 and PARP-1, respectively. GST-fusion protein pull-down experiments were performed using different p300 fragments and nuclear extracts from primary PARP-1(+/+) cells, which were untreated or treated with TNFα. Subsequent immunoblot analysis using an anti-PARP-1 antibody revealed that PARP-1 was binding to p300 fragments 1 and 4 under unstimulated conditions (Fig. 3B, top left) and also after TNFα treatment to p300 fragment 5 (Fig. 3B, bottom left). These p300 fragments correspond to amino acid residues 1–625, 1639–1891, and 1830–2414 of p300, respectively. To map the p300-interaction domain of PARP-1, we in vitro-translated truncated forms of PARP-1 and tested their ability to interact with different GST-p300 fragments (Fig. 3C, Input). The experiments revealed that only GST fragments 1 and 4 of p300 interacted with PARP-1 under stringent conditions (see “Materials and Methods”). Under non-stringent conditions, PARP-1 also bound to p300 fragment 5, although no interaction with p300 fragments 2 and 3 could be observed (Fig. 3C, data not shown). The minimal region of interaction with p300 fragment 1 was limited to the N-terminal 341 amino acids of PARP-1. In contrast, the interaction with p300 fragments 4 and 5 seems to be limited to aa 531–829 of PARP-1. These results suggest that two distinct interactions are required for full interaction of PARP-1 and p300: an N-terminal interaction that involved aa 1–625 of p300 and aa 1–341 of PARP-1 as well as a C-terminal interaction that requires aa 1639–2414 of p300 and aa 531–829 of PARP-1. To determine which domain of PARP-1 was important for NF-κB coactivator function in response to inflammatory stimuli, we performed cotransfection experiments in primary PARP-1(–/–) cells using a NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter construct and different deletion forms of PARP-1 (Fig. 3D). Although transfection of wild-type PARP-1 fully restored TNFα-induced NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activation, cotransfection of different deletion mutants of PARP-1 revealed that expression of a deletion mutant of PARP-1 (expressing aa 1–531) was not able to stimulate NF-κB-dependent gene expression at all (Fig. 3D). Identical experiments with subsequent LPS treatment revealed the same results (data not shown). The inability of this deletion mutant to stimulate NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activation might be explained by its inability to interact with the C terminus of p300, implying the importance of this second interaction site at the C terminus of p300 (Fig. 3, compare C and D). The other deletion mutant of PARP-1 (expressing aa 1–829) was able to stimulate NF-κB-dependent gene expression but not to the same extent as the full-length PARP-1 (Fig. 3D). Given that mutant aa 1–829 was able to bind to the N and C termini of p300, these results indicate that the interaction of PARP-1 with p300 is important for transcriptional activation of NF-κB but that the C-terminal part of the catalytic domain of PARP-1 seems to play an additional important role for the transcriptional coactivation by PARP-1 that is independent of p300. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the observed decrease in coactivation by PARP-1 mutant aa 1–829 might be caused by a difference in conformation or stability of the PARP-1 deletion mutant. PARP-1 Mediates the Interaction between NF-κB1/p50 and the C-terminal Domain of p300 —The association of PARP-1 with p300 and NF-κB through two different domains raised the question of whether the observed synergistic activation of NF-κB by PARP-1 and p300 was caused by PARP-1 influencing the ability of NF-κB (p65/p50) to associate with p300. To determine whether PARP-1 affected NF-κB binding to p300, p300 was immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts of TNFα-treated PARP-1(+/+) and (–/–) cells and tested for the presence of p65 and p50 by Western blot analysis using the indicated antibodies (Fig. 4A). In PARP-1(+/+) extracts, p300 was associated with PARP-1 and both subunits of NF-κB (Fig. 4A, left). Immunoblot analysis of immunoprecipitates from PARP-1(–/–) extracts revealed that despite the absence of PARP-1, p65 and p50 still formed a complex with p300 (Fig. 4A, right). However, p50 bound to p300 to a much lesser extent when immunoprecipitated from PARP-1 (–/–) extract compared with PARP-1(+/+) extracts (Fig. 4A, bottom). Together, these experiments revealed that NF-κB could still form a complex with p300 after induction by TNFα, although the relative amount of the two bound NF-κB subunits (p65 and p50) was reduced in PARP-1(–/–) cells. Importantly, because under the same conditions no transcriptional activation was observed in the previous experiments (Figs. 1 and 2), these experiments suggested that the binding alone of NF-κB to p300 was not sufficient for NF-κB-dependent gene expression in response to TNFα and LPS or that small differences in NF-κB binding to p300 led to large differences in NF-κB-dependent transcription. To further investigate whether PARP-1 would influence NF-κB binding to p300 we performed GST-fusion protein pulldown experiments using different p300 fragments and extracts from PARP-1(+/+) and PARP-1(–/–) cells untreated or treated with TNFα. p65 bound to the p300 fragment 1 in unstimulated cells and to p300 fragments 1, 4, and 5 in TNFα-stimulated cells, although to a much lesser extent to p300 fragment 4 (Fig. 4B). The observed binding of p65 (and also p50) to p300 fragment 1 in unstimulated cells might represent the basal NF-κB activity in these cells. As previously observed, all interactions of the p65 subunit to the p300 fragments were not dependent on PARP-1 (Fig. 4B, compare left and right). p50, (like p65) bound in unstimulated cells to p300 fragment 1 in a PARP-1-independent manner. However, after TNFα stimulation, p50 interacted with p300 fragments 1, 4, and 5 in the presence of PARP-1, but failed to bind to p300 fragment 5 when PARP-1 was absent (Fig. 4B, compare bottom left and bottom right).

A physiologic role of ABC transporters in such progenitor cells has, however, not been defined. A recent study investigated a possible role of ABCB1 P-gp as a determinant of membrane fluidity and membrane potential, but ABCB1 P-gp was found not responsible for the plasma membrane hyperpolarization observed in multidrug resistant cells (35Aleman C. Annereau J.P. Liang X.J. Cardarelli C.O. Taylor B. Yin J.J. Aszalos A. Gottesman M.M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3084-3091PubMed Google Scholar). Here we have cloned and characterized a novel, third member of the human P-gp family encoded on chromosome 7p21-15.3, designated ABCB5 (ATP-binding cassette, subfamily B (MDR/TAP), member 5) P-gp, which functions as a rhodamine-123 efflux transporter and marks CD133-expressing progenitor cells among HEM. ABCB5 P-gp regulates membrane potential in this progenitor cell subset and determines its propensity to undergo cell fusion. Our results define a novel molecular marker and mechanism for cell fusion involving progenitor cells and show that cell fusion and resultant growth and differentiation are not merely spontaneous events but phenomena specifically regulated by ABCB5 P-gp function.

Cell Culture and Isolation—HEM isolated from the foreskins of healthy donors were purchased from Gentaur (Brussels, Belgium) and cultured in Ham's F-10 medium (Clonetics, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 6 mm HEPES, and 25 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract (Invitrogen), 10 μg/ml insulin (Sigma), 2.8 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 2 mmol/liter l-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma), 0.6 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (Sigma), and 10 nmol/liter phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma) as previously described (36Morandini R. Boeynaems J.M. Hedley S.J. MacNeil S. Ghanem G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 175: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The G3361 human melanoma cell line, its cisplatin-resistant variant G3361/CDDP, and the MCF-7 breast cancer and SCC25 squamous cell carcinoma cell lines were provided by Dr. Emil Frei III (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA) and were cultured as described (37Frei III, E. Holden S.A. Gonin R. Waxman D.J. Teicher B.A. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1993; 33: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were donated by healthy volunteers and isolated as described (20Frank M. Denton M. Alexander S. Khoury S. Sayegh M. Briscoe D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2451-2459Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). CD133+ cell populations were isolated from HEM cultures harvested by EDTA-4Na 0.2 g/liter PBS treatment (Versene 1:5000; Invitrogen), by positive selection using anti-CD133 Ab-coated magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) and purification in MiniMACS separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. ABCB5 P-gp+ cells were isolated from HEM cultures by incubation with anti-ABCB5 mAb (20 μg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C, washing for excess antibody removal, incubation with goat anti-mouse Ig-coated magnetic microbeads, and subsequent purification in MiniMACS separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec). RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—The cells were lysed in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) followed by isopropanol precipitation and ethanol washing. Each sample was treated with 10 units of RNase-free DNase I (Roche Applied Science) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Standard cDNA synthesis reactions were performed using 5 μg RNA and the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for reverse transcriptase-PCR (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. For PCR analysis, 5 μl of diluted first strand product (∼100 ng of cDNA) was added to 45 μl of a 1× PCR mix (50 pmol of each primer, 1× PCR PreMix C (MasterAmp PCR optimization kits; Epicenter, Madison, WI), 2.5 units MasterAmp TAQurate DNA polymerase mix (Epicenter) and denatured at 95 °C for 3 min, then cycled 35 times at 94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 3 min, and subsequently extended at 72 °C for 10 min. The reaction products were resolved on a 1% LE agarose gel (Ambion, Austin, TX) and photographed. β-Actin primers were used as controls to ensure RNA integrity. The gene-specific oligonucleotide primer pair 5′-CCTAATTCCTCTAATATCTCTCTGTGAGCC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-TCACTGCACTGACTGTGCATTCAC-3′ (reverse primer) were used for PCR amplification of reverse transcribed total RNA. The 2906-base cDNA PCR product was sequenced using the amplification primer pair and additional gene-specific sequencing primers (5′-AGTGGGAAGAGTACGGTAGTCCAGCTTCTG-3′, 5′-CCTTTAGGGTCACAATCAAATCTGCACTTCG-3′, 5′-GAGCAAAGGTCGGACTACAATCGTG-3′, 5′-CCCCTGCTCTGCCGTAAAATAATCC-3′, 5′-ATTTTGGGTGTTATTTGCTTTGTCAG-3′, 5′-CTGCGGCTGTCTATATTTGGTTTC-3′, 5′-CCAGAGGGCATGTTCATAGTTTTTAC-3′, and 5′-ACGGCTGTTGTCACCATAGGC-3′) and the dideoxy chain termination method analyzed by an ABI PRISM 377 DNA Sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). ABCB5 Gene Cloning and Transfection—For ABCB5 gene transfection experiments, a 2506-base cDNA containing the full-length ABCB5 open reading frame was amplified by PCR from the product of total HEM RNA using a four base (CACC) 5′-modified forward primer (5′-CACC AGT GGG AAG AGT ACG GTA GTC CAG CTT CTG-3′), the reverse primer (5′-TCA CTG CAC TGA CTG TGC ATT CAC-3′), and the Advantage PCR polymerase mix (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The resultant blunt end PCR product was directionally cloned into the pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO plasmid vector (Invitrogen). Recombinant plasmids were transformed into and amplified in competent TOP10 Escherichia coli cells (Invitrogen) and subsequently purified and sequenced. Recombinant ABCB5 open reading frame-containing plasmids or pcDNA3.1D/V5-His/lacZ expression control plasmids containing the E. coli lacZ gene encoding β-galactosidase (Invitrogen) were transfected into cultured ABCB5 nonexpressing MCF7 breast cancer cells using relative quantities of plasmid and LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. ABCB5 gene expression was assessed at 48 h by Western analysis and flow cytometry. As a control, pcDNA3.1D/V5-His/lacZ control plasmid-transfected MCF-7 cancer cells were assayed at 48 h for β-galactosidase expression using a β-galactosidase staining kit (Invitrogen) and bright field microscopic examination. Antibodies—For anti-ABCB5 mAb production, a 16-mer peptide (RFGAYLIQAGRMTPEG) derived from the extracellular loop-associated amino acid residues 493–508 was synthesized and conjugated to the carrier protein bovine serum albumin via a cysteine residue added for coupling purposes. The immunogen (100 μg) was administered subcutaneously to Balb/c mice during primary immunization, and mice received booster immunizations using 100 μg of immunogen at 4 and 8 weeks. Mouse sera were screened for specific-antibody production against the immunogen by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, mice were sacrificed, and the splenocytes were collected for fusion with FO myeloma cells when test bleed serum titers were >1:80000. Specific antibody-secreting fusion products were subcloned to monoclonality by limiting dilution, screened for reactivity with native ABCB5 P-gp by Western analysis and flow cytometry of ABCB5 P-gp-expressing HEM and ABCB5 P-gp gene-transfected, at base-line nonexpressing MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The Ig isotypes of mAbs secreted by selected clones was determined, and spinner flask-produced mAbs were purified by protein A affinity chromatography and tested for lipopolysaccharide content. The IgG1κ anti-ABCB5 P-gp mAb UG3C2–2D12 was used in the studies reported here, and the MOPC-31C mouse isotype control mAb (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) was used as a control. Western Analysis—For Western analysis, whole cell lysates were mixed with 2× sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 4% SDS, and 0.0025% bromphenol blue), heated at 100 °C for 5 min, and run on 4–15% continuous gradient polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) with Tris-glycine-SDS running buffer (Bio-Rad). The separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (NEN Life Science Product, Boston, MA). The membranes were washed and blocked with PBS-Tween 20 containing 5% dry milk and then coated with either anti-ABCB5 mAb or mouse isotype control antibody. After washings, the membranes were incubated with peroxidase-linked secondary goat anti-mouse antibody, and the reactive bands were detected by the addition of chemoluminescent substrate (Pierce). Flow Cytometry—HEM and purified CD133+ HEM, G3361, and G3361/CDDP human melanoma cells, and untreated, ABCB5 P-gp gene-transfected or control lacZ gene-transfected MCF-7 breast cancer cells were analyzed for surface ABCB5 P-gp expression by incubation of 5 × 105 cells for 60 min at 4 °C with anti-ABCB5 mAb or isotype control mAb (10 μg/ml), followed by counterstaining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig Ab (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) as described (20Frank M. Denton M. Alexander S. Khoury S. Sayegh M. Briscoe D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2451-2459Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Analysis of cell surface marker expression was performed by single color flow cytometry as described (20Frank M. Denton M. Alexander S. Khoury S. Sayegh M. Briscoe D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2451-2459Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD133 mAb (clone AC133/2) and anti-CD34 mAb were obtained from Miltenyi. Rhodamine-123 Transport Studies—ABCB5 P-gp gene- or control lacZ gene-transfected MCF-7 cells (2 × 106) were incubated with rhodamine-123 (1 μg/ml) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 60 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Subsequently the cells were washed, and serial fluorescence measurements were acquired by flow cytometry at the FL1 emission spectrum on a Becton Dickinson FACScan. DNA Content Analysis—HEM or purified CD133+ HEM subpopulations were fixed in ice-cold 65% (v/v) ethanol in PBS, washed in cold PBS, and then resuspended in a PI stain mixture containing 50 μg/ml PI, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm EDTA(Na)2, and 100 units/ml RNase (all purchased from Sigma) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the dark and an additional 30 min on ice, followed by cellular DNA content determination by flow cytometry as previously described (20Frank M. Denton M. Alexander S. Khoury S. Sayegh M. Briscoe D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2451-2459Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In those experiments where ABCB5 P-gp surface expression and DNA content were examined concurrently, indirect ABCB5 P-gp surface staining was performed immediately prior to PI staining. Fluorescence Microscopy—To visualize ABCB5 P-gp expression on HEM, CD133+ HEM cells were purified as above and cultured for 24 h in 24-well tissue culture plates (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cells were then fixed in methanol for 3 min, washed twice in PBS, and incubated with anti-ABCB5 mAb or isotype control Ab (10 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 30 min. After washing, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanateconjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody for 30 min at 4 °C, washed, followed by counterstaining of nuclei with 4′6-diamidino-2-phenyindole (DAPI) (Molecular Probes). Fluorescence staining was analyzed by fluorescent microscopy using a Mercury-100 Watts fluorescent light source (Microvideo Instruments, Avon, MA) attached to a Nikon Eclipse TE 300 microscope (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY) with the use of separate filters for each fluorochrome. The images were obtained using a Spot digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments Inc., Sterling Heights, MI), and the Spot 3.3.2. software package was imported into Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA). DiI/DiO Membrane Dye Labeling Studies—To examine cell fusion, HEM cells were harvested and labeled in suspension with either the DiI or DiO fluorescent lipophilic carbocyanine dyes (VybrantCell labeling solution kit; Molecular Probes) by incubation for 20 min at 37 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were subsequently washed three times followed by remixing of DiI- or DiO-labeled HEM populations and co-culture for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere, in the presence or absence of anti-ABCB5 mAb (20 μg/ml), anti-ABCB1 mAb (Hyb-241 clone, 20 μg/ml), or isotype control Ab (20 μg/ml). Dual color flow cytometry was subsequently performed at the Fl2 (DiI) and Fl1 (DiO) detection channels on a Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer. For the detection of cell fusion by fluorescent microscopy, ABCB5 P-gp+ HEM were purified from DiI- or DiO-labeled mixtures by incubation with anti-ABCB5 mAb (20 μg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C, washing for excess antibody removal, incubation with goat anti-mouse Ig-coated magnetic microbeads, and subsequent purification in MiniMACS separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec). ABCB5 P-gp+ cells were cultured in C24 multiwell plates, and nuclear counterstaining with Hoechst 33342 was performed as a time course. Fluorescent microscopy with the use of separate filters for each fluorochrome was performed as described above. Membrane Potential Measurements—Membrane potential was assessed by flow cytometry using the anionic DiBaC4 (3Spees J.L. Olson S.D. Ylostalo J. Lynch P.J. Smith J. Perry A. Peister A. Wang M.Y. Prockop D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2397-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar) oxonol dye (Molecular Probes) as previously described (35Aleman C. Annereau J.P. Liang X.J. Cardarelli C.O. Taylor B. Yin J.J. Aszalos A. Gottesman M.M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3084-3091PubMed Google Scholar, 38Grimley P.M. Aszalos A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Oxonol fluorescence intensity is known to vary as a function of cellular membrane potential, with membrane depolarization resulting in increased fluorescence intensity. Briefly, cell suspensions of 1 × 106 cells/ml PBS were incubated with anti-ABCB5, anti-ABCB1, or isotype control mAbs (50 μg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by the addition of 150 nm oxonol dye. After an equilibration time of 2 min, oxonol fluorescence intensity of 5 × 104 cells/sample was measured by flow cytometry, with acquisition of fluorescence emission at the FL1 spectrum on a Becton Dickinson FACScan. Statistical Analysis—The unpaired two-sided Student's t test was used for the statistical analysis of the results. Differences with p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. ABCB5 Is a Novel Human P-gp Family Member—We used the NCBI tblastn application to compare conserved amino acid sequences derived from the known ABCB1 (MDR1) P-gp structure against the NCBI nonredundant Homo sapiens nucleotide sequence data base dynamically translated in all reading frames to detect genes encoding P-gp-homologous structures and identified a candidate gene on chromosome 7p21-15.3. Using a gene-specific oligonucleotide primer pair and PCR amplification of reverse transcribed total mRNA isolated from primary HEM or the G3361 human malignant melanoma cell line and its CDDP-resistant variant G3361/CDDP (37Frei III, E. Holden S.A. Gonin R. Waxman D.J. Teicher B.A. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1993; 33: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we amplified a 2906-base cDNA (Fig. 1A) encoding a novel human P-gp family member, designated ABCB5 P-gp. ABCB5 P-gp mRNA transcripts were not detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells or additional nonmelanoma human tumors, including the MCF-7 breast cancer and SCC-25 squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (37Frei III, E. Holden S.A. Gonin R. Waxman D.J. Teicher B.A. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1993; 33: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A), indicating a selective tissue expression pattern of ABCB5 P-gp among human physiologic tissues and malignant cancers. Sequencing of the 2906-base cDNA demonstrated that the cDNA contained the complete coding sequence for ABCB5 P-gp, because the 467-base 5′-untranslated region contained five in-frame stop codons upstream of the translation initiation codon. The ABCB5 P-gp cDNA sequence is available from NCBI GenBank™ under accession number AY234788. The ABCB5 gene (Fig. 1B) contains 19 exons and spans 108 kb of genomic DNA at the 7p21-15.3 locus on the contiguous human genomic clones CTA-367017 (AC002486, 79611 bp, exons 1–5) and, sequenced to the right, CTB-86D3 (AC005060, 120169 bp, exons 6–19). Comparison of the encoded 812 amino acid ABCB5 primary sequence revealed that the molecule is highly homologous (73%) to both of the known human P-gp isoforms ABCB1 (MDR1) and ABCB4 (MDR3) (54 and 56% amino acid identity, respectively) (Fig. 1C), its closest human relatives. Primary structure analysis using the PIR International Protein Family Classification system algorithm confirmed the protein to be a novel MDR P-gp member of the ABC transport protein superfamily. ABCB5 P-gp Functions as a Rhodamine-123 Efflux Transporter—Western analysis, using a mouse anti-ABCB5 mAb (clone 3C2–2D12) generated in the laboratory against a synthetic immunogen derived from a predicted extracellular loop-associated ABCB5 epitope contained in amino acid residues 493–508 of the molecule, detected a 89-kDa protein band of the predicted size (ExPASy server Compute pI/Mw Tool) in HEM, G3361 melanoma cells, and ABCB5 gene-transfected MCF-7 breast cancer cells, but not lacZ gene-transfected MCF-7 controls (Fig. 2A), demonstrating binding of this antibody to ABCB5 P-gp. The LipofectAMINE-mediated gene transfection efficiency varied from 5 to 20% in MCF-7 cells in repeated experiments (Fig. 2B). To characterize cellular localization and membrane topology, we performed indirect surface immunostaining and flow cytometry of nonpermeabilized ABCB5 gene-transfected MCF7 cells or lacZ gene-transfected MCF-7 controls. Labeling with anti-ABCB5 P-gp 3C2–2D12 mAb revealed 14% immunopositivity versus ABCB5- controls (Fig. 2C; M1 gate), consistent with the determined transfection efficiency. These findings demonstrate a surface plasma membrane localization of ABCB5 P-gp and support a predicted (TMHMM1.O software algorithm) membrane topology of ABCB5 P-gp characterized by five transmembrane helices flanked by both extracellular and intracellular ATP-binding domains (Fig. 2D), in contrast to six transmembrane helices and one intracellular ATP-binding domain per homologous half found in other known mammalian P-gp isoforms (reviewed in Ref. 39Borst P. Elferink R.O. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 537-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). When assessing the role of ABCB5 P-gp in fluorescent rhodamine transport, a hallmark function of the closely related ABCB1 (MDR1) P-gp, ABCB5 gene transfection induced a de novo rhodamine-123 efflux capacity in 15% of MCF-7 breast carcinoma compared with lacZ gene-transfected MCF-7 controls (Fig. 2E; M1-gated rhodaminelow phenotype), consistent with the transfection efficiency and demonstrating that plasma membrane-expressed ABCB5 P-gp functions as a rhodamine efflux transporter. ABCB5 P-glycoprotein Expression Marks CD133+Progenitor Cells—We next examined ABCB5 P-gp surface expression in native HEM, the G3361 melanoma cell line, and its cisplatin-resistant variant G3361/CDDP, which transcribe ABCB5 mRNA as determined by PCR analysis. Indirect immunostaining using 3C2–2D12 mAb revealed ABCB5 P-gp to be expressed on the plasma membrane of 11% of HEM, 3% of G3361 melanoma cells, and, augmented compared with the parent cell line, on 13% of CDDP-resistant G3361/CDDP melanoma cells (Fig. 3A; M1 gate). Based on our finding that ABCB5 P-gp marked distinct cellular subsets among HEM and human melanoma cells, and on the previous evidence that homologous ABC transporters identify physiologic progenitor cells (26Chaudhary P.M.

https://openalex.org/W1978383473,"Although functions for the steroid hormone ecdysone during Drosophila metamorphosis have been well established, roles for the embryonic ecdysone pulse remain poorly understood. We show that the EcR-USP ecdysone receptor is first activated in the extraembryonic amnioserosa, implicating this tissue as a source of active ecdysteroids in the early embryo. Ecdysone signaling is required for germ band retraction and head involution, morphogenetic movements that shape the first instar larva. This mechanism for coordinating morphogenesis during Drosophila embryonic development parallels the role of ecdysone during metamorphosis. It also provides an intriguing parallel with the role of mammalian extraembryonic tissues as a critical source of steroid hormones during embryonic development."

The cystine knot is now a well established motif seen in a wide variety of proteins from organisms as diverse as fungi, plants, insects, and animals. It comprises an embedded ring formed by two disulfide bonds and their connecting backbone segments that is threaded by a third disulfide bond (1Pallaghy P.K. Nielsen K.J. Craik D.J. Norton R.S.

A. 2001; 98: 10614-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), and many more are currently being characterized. They represent the largest known family of circular proteins. Their natural function in plants seems to be defense molecules as they show potent activity against Helicoverpa insect pests (20Jennings C. West J. Waine C. Craik D.J. Anderson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10614-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). They also have activity against a range of bacteria and fungi (8Tam J.P. Lu Y.A. Yang J.L. Chiu K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8913-8918Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). It is believed that the exceptional stability of the cyclotides (which retain biological activity after boiling) is because of the strongly braced structure built around the CCK motif. Their exceptional stability has led to suggestions that they may make a valuable template in peptide-based drug design applications (21Craik D.J. Simonsen S. Daly N.L. Curr. Opin. Drug Discovery Dev. 2002; 5: 251-260PubMed Google Scholar). Further, their potent activity against insect pests (20Jennings C. West J. Waine C. Craik D.J. Anderson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10614-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) makes them potentially valuable crop protection agents if their genes can be transferred into crops subject to predation by susceptible pest species. For these reasons and because of their unique and fascinating topological properties there is much interest in the structural characterization of the cyclotide molecular framework. Determination of the disulfide connectivity and topology of the cyclotides is intrinsically very difficult, because the close packing of the six Cys residues (I-VI) and the resistance to enzyme digestion have made it impossible to obtain suitable digestion fragments for classical disulfide mapping. In the original structural studies (22Saether O. Craik D.J. Campbell I.D. Sletten K. Juul J. Norman D.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4147-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) we used a geometric and energetic analysis of the calculated NMR models for each of the 15 possible disulfide connectivities to deduce the preferred connectivity for kalata B1. This led to the proposed I-IV, II-V, III-VI connectivity, although two other low energy alternatives could not be completely eliminated. A subsequent analysis by mass spectroscopy of fragments obtained after partial acid hydrolysis of circulins A and B supported the I-IV, II-V, III-VI connectivity (23Derua R. Gustafson K.R. Pannell L.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1996; 228: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Further, a synthetic study of the circulins and cyclopsychotride A in which one disulfide bond was unequivocally formed via directed chemical synthesis supported the previously proposed connectivity (8Tam J.P. Lu Y.A. Yang J.L. Chiu K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8913-8918Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). These cyclotides, however, represent only one of the two major subfamilies of cyclotides identified so far, i.e. the “bracelet” one, whereas kalata B1 belongs to the other, the Möbius subfamily. Fig. 1 (panels A and B) shows sequence homology diagrams for the two subfamilies based on the published sequences of ∼50 cyclotides. Recently Skjeldal et al. (24Skjeldal L. Gran L. Sletten K. Volkman B.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 399: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) recorded new NMR data for kalata B1 at 750 MHz and proposed an alternative disulfide connectivity based in part on the existence of certain NOEs between Cys residues presumed to be connected and in part on an energetic analysis of all 15 possible disulfide isomers as was done in the original structural study (22Saether O. Craik D.J. Campbell I.D. Sletten K. Juul J. Norman D.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4147-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). It was suggested that the differences in sequence between the two subfamilies might be responsible for this alternative connectivity, which, as illustrated in Fig. 1 (panels C and D), would imply a laddered rather than a knotted topology. We have noted recently (25Rosengren K.J. Daly N.L. Plan M.R. Waine C. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8606-8616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) that local Cys-Cys NOEs can be very misleading in a molecule such as kalata B1 as often pairs of protons in non-connected Cys residues can be closer in space than those paired within a disulfide bond. However, an analysis of coupling constants between the αH and βH protons of the Cys residues, combined with NOE analysis, strongly supported our original proposition that there is a knotted topology in kalata B1 and cycloviolacin O1. These molecules were chosen for study as they represent prototypic examples of cyclotides from both of the two major subfamilies, i.e. the bracelet and Möbius forms (4Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Bond T. Waine C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1327-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Although we believe that our recent NMR structural studies of kalata B1 and cycloviolacin O1 (25Rosengren K.J. Daly N.L. Plan M.R. Waine C. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8606-8616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) provided definitive evidence for the disulfide connectivity as originally proposed, it remains the case that so far there have been no direct chemical determination of the disulfide connectivities in the Möbius cyclotides. To address this question, we have developed an MS-based approach for disulfide mapping that overcomes the notorious difficulties associated with disulfide analysis of small cystine-rich peptides in general and for peptides with a low or clustered content of positively charged residues, such as the cyclotides, in particular. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the method involves the introduction of charges, as well as cleavage sites, directly at Cys residues involved in disulfides, which then can be determined easily by mass spectrometric analyses. The results show that partial reduction and selective labeling via alkylation of individual disulfide bonds allows an unambiguous determination of the disulfide connectivity and unequivocally confirms the presence of a cystine knot in the prototypic cyclotide kalata B1. Further, we have undertaken a detailed topological analysis of disulfide bonding networks in tridisulfide proteins and show that the presence of the I-IV, II-V, III-VI connectivity is sufficient to result in a cystine knot topology provided the backbone is cyclic. General—Kalata B1 was isolated and purified as described (4Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Bond T. Waine C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1327-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar) from the fresh aerial parts of Oldenlandia affinis DC (Rubiaceae). An Agilent 1100 HPLC (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) and a Grom-Sil ODS-4 HE (125 × 2 (inner diameter) mm, 3 μm, 200 Å) column were used for RP-HPLC, eluted with linear gradients from A (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in water (v/v)) to B (90% AcN in 0.045% trifluoroacetic acid) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Monoisotopic masses (M) are used throughout the text. Partial Reduction and Stepwise Alkylation—Partial reduction was done as described (26Gray W.R. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1997: 165-186Google Scholar, 27Gray W.R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1732-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In short, peptides (typically ∼0.5 mg in 0.5 ml of 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid and ∼30% AcN as eluted from HPLC) were incubated with an equivalent volume of 20 mm TCEP, 0.2 m citrate buffer, pH 3.0, at 64 °C for 3 min. The peptide solution and the reducing buffer were pre-equilibrated at the same temperature before mixing. The reaction was stopped by immediate injection on a Phenomenex Jupiter C18 column (250 × 4.6 (inner diameter) mm, 5 μm, 300 Å), eluted with a shallow gradient at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (isocratic at 20% B for 10 min; 20-34% B in 3 min; 34-40% B in 24 min; 40-100% B in 1 min; 100% for 2 min; and finally re-equilibration at 20% B for 11 min, giving a total time of 51 min). Partially reduced species were collected manually. For NEM alkylation, the same volume of 60 mm NEM in 0.2 m citrate buffer, pH 3, was added directly to collected fractions containing (partially) reduced peptides. Typically, such a fraction contained ∼1 nmol peptide in 100 μl of solvent; the addition of 100 μl of NEM (6 μmol) then corresponds to 1000 equivalents of the maximum number of alkylation sites, that is the six cysteines (6 nmol). This mixture was incubated for 60 min at room temperature before direct injection and separation on RP-HPLC. Collected peptides were then dried on using a Speedvac (Savant Instruments, Holbrook, NY). For complete reduction and aminoethylation NEM-alkylated peptides were dissolved and fully reduced in 100 μl of 40 mm dithiothreitol in 0.5 ml of 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing 1 mm EDTA and 6 m guanidine HCl. After 1 h of incubation (37 °C) 2 mg of 2-bromoethylamine dissolved in 10 μl of the same Tris buffer was added, after which the reaction was incubated overnight (37 °C). The reaction was then terminated by injection on RP-HPLC. Enzymatic Cleavage—Collected fractions were dried on a Speedvac and cleaved with modified trypsin (0.2 μg in 50 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 7.8, 37 °C, 4 h; Promega, Madison, WI). The cleavage buffer was removed by lyophilization before MS analyses. Mass Spectrometry—To monitor the reactions in the stepwise alkylation scheme MALDI-TOF MS analyses were done on a Perseptive Biosystems Voyager DE operated in the positive reflectron mode using α-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid as matrix. Nanospray MS and MS/MS analyses were done in the positive ion mode on a Qstar Pulsar (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) equipped with a Protana nanospray ion source (Protana, Odense, Denmark). Typically, a <1-nmol sample was dissolved in 10 μl of 60% aqueous methanol containing 0.1% formic acid, of which ∼1 μl was transferred to the nanospray needle. Molecular weight determinations were then done using full scan mode m/z 200-1000 using a potential of 900 V applied to the nanospray needle. MS/MS studies were done on the same sample and potential as above, with a collision energy of between 25 and 45 eV. The strategy to definitively determine the disulfide connectivity of kalata B1 involved first determining conditions under which only one or two of the disulfide bonds could be reduced, labeling the reduced Cys residues using an alkylating reagent and then reducing and labeling the remaining Cys residues for subsequent MS analysis. The choice of reducing agent and alkylators was a key feature in this strategy; rearrangement of disulfide bonds was avoided by performing partial reduction and the first alkylation at acidic pH, whereas the second labeling was used to introduce site-specific enzymatic cleavage labels at the remaining disulfides. This method allowed an unambiguous determination of the I-IV, II-V, III-VI disulfide pattern, thus providing definite chemical proof of the disulfide bond connectivity that characterizes the CCK motif. Initially, the cyanylation strategy described by Wu and coworkers (28Wu J. Gage D.A. Watson J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 235: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 29Wu J. Watson J.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 30Wu J. Watson J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) was attempted, but we found a number of problems associated with the chemistry of the reactions that had undesired effects when applied to cyclotides. In this method the amino acid on the N-terminal side of the cyanylated Cys affects the yield of the chemical cleavage reaction, with bulky or rigid side chains acting as inhibitors, resulting in incomplete cleavage. Moreover, cleavage sites are also lost by β-elimination of the cyanylated cysteines, which further complicates the analysis (29Wu J. Watson J.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). When this method was applied to kalata B1 interpretation of the MS spectra was greatly complicated as the spectra were dominated by fragments containing the only positively charged residue in the sequence (kalata B1 contains one Arg residue). Partial Reduction by TCEP and Isolation of Intermediates—Partial reduction of kalata B1 was done with TCEP in 0.1 m citrate buffer at pH 3.0 and was optimized with respect to incubation time to give the highest ratio of partially reduced disulfide species relative to fully reduced peptide. The optimal time for sampling was determined to be 3 min; the consumption of native material was then kept to a minimum, and a rapid turnover time for the total reaction-separation procedure was achieved. Two main intermediates were collected and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. Their molecular weights were determined to be 2894 and 2892, corresponding to one species containing one remaining disulfide bond (referred to as a 1S species) and one species that contains two disulfide bonds (referred to as a 2S species). As shown in Fig. 3, the reduced peptide(s) eluted before the native one on RP chromatography. This behavior is opposite to what is normally observed for most peptides and proteins but for cyclotides, and for some other disulfide-rich small peptides (31Shon K.J. Hasson A. Spira M.E. Cruz L.J. Gray W.R. Olivera B.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11420-11425Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), is explained by the fact that the interior of the molecule is occupied by the disulfides, thus forcing hydrophobic amino acids to be surface-exposed (32Daly N.L. Clark R.J. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6314-6322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Removal of the disulfide bonds reduces the conformational constraints and favors burial of the exposed hydrophobic residues. Stepwise Alkylation of Partially Reduced Disulfide Species—The first alkylation was carried out immediately after collection of the 1S and 2S species by adding NEM (60 mm in 0.2 m citrate buffer, pH 3.0) in a volume equivalent to the collected fraction. The pH of the fractions was measured and confirmed to be 3.0 at which the alkylation reaction was carried out for 1 h. NEM-alkylated peptides were then re-isolated by RPHPLC, and their molecular weights were determined to 3396 and 3142 by MALDI-TOF MS, corresponding to reduction and NEM alkylation of four cysteines for the 1S species and two cysteines for the 2S species. The alkylated peptides were then lyophilized and redissolved at a pH of 8.5, at which the remaining disulfides were reduced with dithiothreitol and alkylated with 2-bromoethylamine. After isolation on RP-HPLC, the molecular weights of these aminoethylated peptides were determined to be 3482 and 3318 (by MALDI-TOF MS), congruent with aminoethylation (Ae) of the two remaining cysteines of the 1S species and the four remaining cysteines of the 2S species. No reshuffling of alkylators between non-labeled/labeled or differently labeled cysteines was observed under the experimental conditions used. The latter was confirmed by subjecting fully NEM-alkylated peptide to attempted further reduction and aminoethylation and the identical molecular weights and retention times (RP-HPLC) that were observed for this peptide before and after the experiment. It is interesting to note the changes in retention times during the stepwise alkylation as shown in Fig. 3. Although the partially reduced species eluted just after the fully reduced peptide, retention times were increased after NEM alkylation and decreased again after aminoethylation. This is consistent with the expected increase in hydrophobicity by NEM-alkylated cysteine side chains and the introduction of the hydrophilic, positively charged aminoethyl groups. Identification of Fragments and Disulfide Connectivities after Enzymatic Cleavage—Fig. 4 shows the MS spectra for the NEM- and Ae-alkylated 1S and 2S species after tryptic digestion. The ions observed in the spectra, obtained by nanospray-MS, all correspond to peptide fragments congruent with the introduction of two or four introduced cleavage sites by aminoethylation of the 1S or 2S species, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4 and Table I, the molecular weights of the fragments alone identify the sites of the two different alkylators for each of the two disulfide species. Thus the two aminoethylated cysteines in the 1S species revealed the CysIII-CysVI bond. For the 2S species the sites of NEM-alkylated residues directly established its identity as des(CysII-CysV). The identification of all fragments and the sites of the different alkylators were confirmed by MS/MS peptide sequencing, as shown by the example in Fig. 5.Table IFragments after tryptic cleavage for assignment of disulfide connectivesDisulfide speciesIonsaMonoisotopic masses are used, and MwExp. are calculated through deconvolution of the doubly or triply charged ions (Qstar MS) and given as (M),bMasses in parentheses contains one Cys(NEM) adduct (+18 atomic mass units)MwExp.aMonoisotopic masses are used, and MwExp. are calculated through deconvolution of the doubly or triply charged ions (Qstar MS) and given as (M),bMasses in parentheses contains one Cys(NEM) adduct (+18 atomic mass units)MwCalc.aMonoisotopic masses are used, and MwExp. are calculated through deconvolution of the doubly or triply charged ions (Qstar MS) and given as (M)Identified fragmentsm/z1S276.16275.16275.16TR780.802+1559.601559.62NTPGC(NEM)TC(NEM)SWPVC(Ae)(789.802+)(1577.60)851.852+1701.701701.72NGLPVC(NEM)GETC(NEM)VGGTC(Ae)(860.852+)(1719.70)606.603+1816.801816.77NTPGC(NEM)TC(NEM)SWPVC(Ae)TR653.953+1958.851958.86TRNGLPVC(NEM)GETC(NEM)VGGTC(Ae)2S276.17275.17275.16TR534.23533.23533.23NTPGC(Ae)482.212+,962.39962.40TC(NEM)SWPVC(Ae)963.39(980.42)(491.212+)540.923+,1619.721619.71NGLPVC(Ae)GETC(NEM)VGGTC(Ae)810.862+(1637.72)(546.583+, 819.862+)534.754+,2134.952134.93NGLPVC(Ae)GETC(NEM)VGGTC(Ae)NTPGC(Ae)712.653+(2152.98)(539.244+, 718.663+)a Monoisotopic masses are used, and MwExp. are calculated through deconvolution of the doubly or triply charged ions (Qstar MS) and given as (M)b Masses in parentheses contains one Cys(NEM) adduct (+18 atomic mass units) Open table in a new tab Fig. 5MS/MS sequencing.

First NEM alkylation introduces a chiral center on the modified cysteine side chain, resulting in 2n stereoisomers for n alkylated cysteines and, possibly, the same number of peaks on RP-HPLC. No indication of the latter could be seen until after tryptic cleavage when the peaks became apparent, especially for the 1S fragments after extended digestion (i.e. 20-h incubation). These fragments each carried two NEM-modified cysteines and thus showed peaks split in four on RP-HPLC. However, these isomers all have the same mass, which does not affect analysis by MS alone (i.e. by infusion or nanospray as used here). Second, mass adducts of +18 and +36 were observed after digestion for fragments containing one or two NEM-alkylated cysteine/cysteines, respectively. These adducts were also shown by MS/MS fragmentation to originate from the NEM-modified cysteines as shown in Fig. 5. Most probably, they result from the uptake of water by hydrolysis (+18) of the maleimide ring structure. This is a known reaction for this type of compounds; maleimides have been shown to undergo hydrolysis at slightly basic pH (>7.5) (33Ishii Y. Lehrer S.S. Biophys. J. 1986; 50: 75-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Such a reaction would also be favored at the conditions we normally use for tryptic digestion (overnight incubation in 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 7.8). With this in mind it was possible to use the formation of adducts to our advantage in the identification of NEM-containing fragments. As shown in Fig. 6, the combined information on the two disulfide bonds identified from the isolated 1S and 2S species, CysIII-CysVI and CysII-CysV, respectively, gives the third and remaining one by deduction: CysI-CysIV. In the current study we have selectively reduced one or two of the native disulfide bonds in kalata B1 and then alkylated the reduced Cys residues to specifically tag them. Using mass spectrometric methods we have unequivocally determined the connectivity of disulfide bonds and demonstrated that they have a I-IV, II-V, III-VI pattern, as originally proposed by Saether et al. (22Saether O. Craik D.J. Campbell I."

Herein, we show that the V2R is ubiquitinated following agonist stimulation. V2R-ubiquitination is not observed in a β-arrestin1,2 deleted mouse fibroblast cell line and is restored following introduction of β-arrestin2, thus indicating that β-arrestin2 is required for the ubiquitination of V2R. A mutant V2R (K268R) that is not ubiquitinated still activates Gs and internalizes with similar kinetics as the wild type receptor. Unstimulated wild type and K268R mutant receptors degrade at similar rates and have comparable half-lives of 217 ± 17 and 245 ± 29 min as determined by pulse-chase experiments. However, following agonist stimulation, the rate of receptor degradation for the wild type is enhanced (half-life of 69 ± 19 min), whereas that of the mutant is only minimally affected (half-life of 188 ± 11 min). These data suggest that V2R levels are regulated through at least two processes. In the absence of agonist stimulation, a slow degradative pathway operates that is independent of receptor ubiquitination. However, receptor stimulation leads to rapid β-arrestin2-dependent ubiquitination of the receptor and increased degradation.

Interaction with its ligand, arginine vasopressin (AVP), leads to activation of Gs and consequent activation of adenylyl cyclase that increases cAMP levels in cells. A cascade of events following the elevated levels of cAMP in kidney cells leads to an increase in the water permeability of the collecting ducts and facilitates water reabsorption (1Birnbaumer M. Receptors Channels. 2002; 8: 51-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Exposure of V2R to its ligand also triggers receptor phosphorylation, internalization, and desensitization resulting in a reduction of the cellular response to the agonist (2Innamorati G. Sadeghi H. Birnbaumer M. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1999; 19: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 3Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus of the human V2R, similar to other G protein-coupled receptors, contains multiple phosphorylation sites and is a major regulatory domain controlling receptor interaction with β-arrestins and their trafficking in the cell (2Innamorati G. Sadeghi H. Birnbaumer M. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1999; 19: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 4Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19452-19460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that V2R interacts tightly with β-arrestin1 or -2 following phosphorylation (4Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19452-19460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The receptor-β-arrestin complex is then endocytosed via clathrin-coated pits and accumulated in large endocytic vesicles in the proximity of the nucleus. V2R undergoes rapid agonist-promoted endocytosis but appears to be poorly recycled. The intracellularly retained receptor is either slowly recycled to the surface or is degraded. The 26 S proteasome and lysosomes are two major protein degradative pathways in cells. Lysosomes are vesicular organelles with decreased internal pH that can facilitate the breaking of peptide bonds. Proteasomes are multisubunit complexes consisting of a regulatory and a core particle that can recognize and degrade polyubiquitinated proteins (5Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). Proteins are targeted to the proteasome via covalent attachment of polyubiquitin chains consisting of at least four ubiquitin peptides attached at specific lysine residues (6Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). The regulatory particle of proteasome is responsible for the recognition and recycling of polyubiquitin chains back into the cytoplasm in addition to unfolding and threading the unfolded protein through the core particle of the proteasome. The core particle of proteasome cleaves proteins into small peptides ranging in size from 3 to 23 amino acids. Although the initial function assigned to ubiquitination was the targeting of proteins to proteasomes, recent studies indicate that ubiquitination of several membrane proteins serves as a targeting or sorting signal through the endocytic route leading either to the vacuole in yeast or to lysosomes in mammalian cells. Agonist-promoted ubiquitination of several seven-transmembrane-spanning receptors has been shown to play a key role in either their endocytic trafficking or receptor degradation. For example, monoubiquitination of the yeast pheromone receptor promotes ligand-induced endocytosis and is essential for the targeting of the receptor to the vacuole for degradation (7Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). Several mammalian seven-transmembrane-spanning receptors such as CXCR4 and β2-adrenergic receptors are also ubiquitinated following agonist stimulation. Mutant versions of these receptors, which cannot undergo ubiquitin modification, internalize but are not degraded (8Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 9Marchese A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45509-45512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In the case of the β2-adrenergic receptor, ubiquitination of β-arrestin is necessary for receptor internalization but apparently not for receptor degradation. Here we sought to investigate the role of V2 vasopressin receptor ubiquitination in receptor trafficking and degradation. Our findings indicate that V2R is ubiquitinated in an agonist and β-arrestin-dependent manner at a single lysine residue (lysine 268) in the third intracellular loop and that this ubiquitination forces the V2R to a rapid degradative pathway. Materials—LipofectAMINE was from Invitrogen. HA affinity agarose beads were purchased from Covance or Sigma. Arginine-vasopressin and MG132 were from Sigma. Ubiquitin antibody UbP4D1 and anti-HA rabbit polyclonal antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Easy tag™ express protein labeling mix, 35S, and [3H]Arg-vasopressin were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. V2 receptor mutants (K268R and K367R) were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The sequence of oligos used for mutagenesis can be provided upon request. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing (Howard Hughes Medical Institute sequencing facilities, Duke University). Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 and HEK-293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) and minimal essential medium (Sigma), respectively, and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Transient transfection of COS-7 cells was carried out with LipofectAMINE reagent. HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with FuGENE (Roche). Receptor Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with HA-tagged V2R and FLAG-tagged β-arrestin2. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were split into appropriate plates for ubiquitination and binding assays. Forty-eight hours following transfection, cells were serum-starved for 2 h (with or without 10 μm MG132 where appropriate) and then stimulated for the designated amount of time with 1 μm AVP. Cells were lysed using a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin (5 μg/ml), aprotonin (5 μg/ml), pepstatin A (1 μg/ml), and 100 μm benzamidine. Cell lysates were incubated with HA beads overnight at 4 °C. The next day, the cell lysate was removed, and the beads were washed four times with the lysis buffer to eliminate nonspecific binding. Laemmeli's sample buffer was used to elute the immunoprecipitated receptor, and the resulting solution was resolved on polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred to Polyscreen® polyvinylidene difluoride hybridization transfer membrane for Western blotting and were detected by the chemiluminescent reagent SuperSignal® West Pico (Pierce). Binding Assay—Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were split into 12-well plates. Forty-eight hours following transfection, cells were washed twice with a wash buffer consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm HEPES (pH 7.5). Cells were incubated with radiolabel solution [3H]Arg-vasopressin (or a mixture of radioligand and 10 μm AVP) for 1 h at room temperature. All wells were washed thrice with the wash buffer to remove all nonspecific binding. Cells were lysed with a solution containing 0.1% SDS and 0.1 m NaOH. The amount of radioactivity retained in cells was measured and receptor concentration was calculated using GraphPad software. cAMP Assay—A 3H-labeled cAMP assay system (Amersham Biosciences) was used to determine the amount of accumulated cAMP response in transiently transfected cells following stimulation as per previously described protocol (10Zamah A.M. Delahunty M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31249-31256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Internalization Assay—Twenty-four hours after transfection with HA-tagged V2R and FLAG-tagged β-arrestin2, COS-7 cells were split into appropriate plates. Forty-eight hours following transfection, cells were placed on ice and washed thrice with the wash buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm HEPES). Radioligand [3H]vasopressin was added to cells, and cells were placed on a 37 °C hot plate for indicated times to allow for receptor internalization. Cells were washed three times to remove unbound radioligand. Bound cell surface ligand was acid washed, collected, and quantified to determine the amount of receptor that remained on the surface. Following the acid wash, cells were lysed with solution containing 0.1% SDS and 0.1 m NaOH, and the amount of internalized receptor was determined. As a control, binding assays (as described above) were performed simultaneously to determine the total number of receptors on the cell surface prior to internalization assay. Confocal Microscopy—HEK-293 cells were transfected with HA-tagged V2R and GFP-tagged β-arrestin2 using FuGENE. Twenty-four hours following transfection, cells were split and plated on collagen-coated 35-mm glass-bottom plates and serum-starved for several hours. After addition of an agonist (1 μm AVP), images were obtained at different time points ranging from 0 to 60 min poststimulation on a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning microscope. Receptor expression was confirmed by radioligand binding. Pulse-Chase Assay—COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with HA-tagged V2R and FLAG-tagged β-arrestin2. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and starved in serum-free medium lacking Met and Cys. 100 μCi of Easy tag™ express protein labeling mix, 35S, per milliliter of serum-free buffer (2 ml/10-cm plate), was used to metabolically label the cells for 90 min. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times to remove unbound label. The medium was replaced with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and cells were stimulated with 1 μm AVP for the indicated amount of time. Cells were lysed, and the HA-tagged receptors were immunoprecipitated and run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described above. Dried gels were exposed to x-ray film. The bands on the autoradiograph were quantitated using a Bio-Rad Flour-S imager. To investigate whether human V2R is ubiquitinated following agonist stimulation, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with HA-tagged V2R and stimulated for 1 h with the agonist, AVP. As shown in Fig. 1a (upper panels), V2R is ubiquitinated following agonist stimulation. The ubiquitinated receptor is detected as a smear on Western blots because of the variable number of conjugated ubiquitin moieties and could only be detected in the presence of the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 that prevents the rapid degradation of the polyubiquitin-conjugated proteins. A time course study determined that after agonist stimulation, V2R ubiquitination was apparent as early as 60 min (Fig. 1b, upper panel) and was prominent at 120 min. For each agonist-stimulated sample, the amount of V2R in the immunoprecipitates was determined by blotting for the HA tag on the receptor (Fig. 1b, lower panel). No changes in the receptor levels were detected after stimulation with AVP. Detection of V2R ubiquitination requires preincubation of cells with MG132 unlike the β2-adrenergic receptor (8Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). The known role of MG132 is the inhibition of proteasomal activity. This is suggestive of a degradative role for the proteasomes in the case of V2R apart from the previously implied role in endosomal sorting of cell surface receptor (16Ponting C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Alternatively, ubiquitination of the V2R may require stabilization of an unknown protein that is rapidly targeted to the proteasomes for degradation. Previous studies have shown that β-arrestin2 is necessary for β2-adrenergic receptor ubiquitination (8Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). β2-Adrenergic receptor belongs to a class of receptors (class A) that bind GFP-β-arrestin proteins transiently during endocytosis and have higher affinity for the β-arrestin2 isoform (11Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17201-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). However, V2R classifies as a second group of receptors (class B), which bind β-arrestin more stably and show equal affinity to β-arrestin1 and -2. To determine the involvement of a specific β-arrestin isoform in V2R ubiquitination, we performed experiments in β-arrestin1/2 double knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines that were stably transfected with either vector pCDNA3 (MEF-βarr1-/βarr2-), FLAG-tagged β-arrestin1 (MEF-βarr1), or β-arrestin2 (MEF-βarr2) (12Kohout T.A. Lin F.S. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1601-1606PubMed Google Scholar, 13Perry S.J. Baillie G.S. Kohout T.A. McPhee I. Magiera M.M. Ang K.L. Miller W.E. McLean A.J. Conti M. Houslay M.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 834-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). All the above three cell lines were transiently transfected with the HA-tagged V2R and assayed for receptor ubiquitination. Receptor ubiquitination was only observed in the MEF-βarr2 cell lines implicating β-arrestin2 as an essential factor in V2R ubiquitination (Fig. 2). β-Arrestin2 is also necessary for ubiquitination of β2-adrenergic receptor. Perhaps, β-arrestin2 serves as an adaptor protein necessary for the recruitment of E2 or E3 enzymes of the ubiquitination machinery that can ubiquitinate the receptor. Next, we determined the site of ubiquitination in the V2R. Ubiquitin is covalently attached to lysine residues on proteins. Human V2R contains four lysine residues (Fig. 3a). Based on the predicted structure of human V2R, Lys-100 and Lys-116 do not face the cytosol and are thus unlikely to be ubiquitinated. We suspected that the site of ubiquitination of the receptor was either on residue Lys-268, located in the third intracellular loop, or residue Lys-367, located in the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor. Two V2R mutants, K268R and K367R, were created to determine the possible site(s) of receptor ubiquitination. Mutants and the wild type receptor were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells and assayed for agonist-stimulated ubiquitination. Both wild type and K367R receptors were ubiquitinated. However, no ubiquitinated species were detected in the immunoprecipitated K268R receptor mutant (Fig. 3b). Ligand binding data confirmed that K268R was indeed expressed in sufficient amounts for the detection of ubiquitinated species. These findings thus implicate residue Lys-268 as the primary site of receptor ubiquitination. Lys-268 is located in the C-terminal side of the third intracellular loop of the receptor, which is a predicted region for receptor and G protein interaction. Severely impaired receptor signaling or improper internalization might influence K268R receptor ubiquitination. We therefore investigated the signaling and internalization of the receptor mutant. Binding and functional assays show that when receptor mutants and the wild type receptor are expressed at comparable levels, both mutants are capable of activating Gs protein in response to the agonist AVP. As predicted by the location of the mutation K268R, this receptor mutant is partially impaired in activating Gs and elevating cAMP levels in cells (Fig. 4a). Our data also indicate that the K268R mutant resides at the plasma membrane because the agonist AVP, being hydrophilic, is not capable of permeating through the cell membrane. β-Arrestin2 interaction with the V2R is crucial for receptor ubiquitination (Fig. 2). Therefore, impaired interaction of K268R with β-arrestin2 might explain the lack of ubiquitination of the receptor mutant. To investigate this possibility, HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with GFP-tagged β-arrestin2 and either wild type or K268R mutant receptor. Intact cells were stimulated for 40 min with AVP, and the recruitment of GFP-β-arrestin2 to the endocytic vesicles was observed using confocal microscopy. GFP-β-arrestin2 was uniformly distributed throughout the cytoplasm prior to agonist stimulation (Fig. 4b). Following stimulation, GFP-β-arrestin2 was recruited to the plasma membrane and eventually accumulated within the cell in endocytic vesicles (Fig. 4b). This phenomenon has been described for several G protein-coupled receptors (11Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17201-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Both wild type and K268R mutant receptors were capable of this interaction with GFP-β-arrestin2 as shown in Fig. 4b. According to previous reports β-arrestin receptor interaction requires phosphorylation of serine clusters in the V2R tail region (4Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19452-19460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 14Shih S.C. Sloper-Mould K.E. Hicke L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Because the K268R mutant receptor is capable of recruiting β-arrestin2, its phosphorylation state is not likely to be affected. Moreover, the nonubiquitinated V2R is internalized similar to the wild type receptor. As shown in Fig. 4c, ∼80% of the surface receptors (K268R and the wild type) are internalized after 60 min. Therefore, lack of ubiquitination in K268R had no effect on receptor internalization. To determine whether ubiquitination could regulate the life cycle of V2R, the half-lives of the wild type and the mutant K268R receptor were determined by pulse-chase experiments. Transiently transfected COS-7 cells were metabolically labeled with 35S-labeled Met and 35S-labeled Cys. Tagged receptors were then immunoprecipitated, resolved on gels, and analyzed. In unstimulated cells, wild type and the K268R V2 receptors displayed comparable (p = not significant) half-lives of 217 ± 17 and 245 ± 29 min, respectively (Fig. 5, a and c). Agonist stimulation reduced the half-life of the wild type receptor to 69 ± 19 min while having little effect on the K268R mutant receptor half-life of 188 ± 11 min (p < 0.005, Fig. 5, a and c). Three hours following the metabolic labeling, the nonubiquitinated mutant and the wild type vasopressin receptor levels were depleted in agonist-stimulated cells. Our data demonstrate a striking difference in the pattern of degradation for the receptors. The delay in K268R degradation reflects a possible lag in receptor sorting following stimulation. The alternate pathway of degradation for the nonubiquitinated receptor leads to elevated levels of receptor for up to 3 h. The agonist-dependent degradation of the K268R receptor mutant appears to be linear, whereas agonist-dependent degradation of the wild type receptor is non-linear and asymptotic. However, if one looks at the data presented in Fig. 5c, it becomes apparent that there is no significant difference in the half-life of the mutant receptor in the presence or absence of agonist. This suggests that the difference in the shape of the time curves for the mutant receptor degradation in the presence or absence of agonist may be more apparent than real. Our data suggest that two different pathways degrade V2R. A slow degradative pathway in unstimulated cells is responsible for maintaining a balance between the synthesis and destruction of the V2 receptor. This slow pathway continuously degrades the V2 receptor using a ubiquitin-independent mechanism, because the mutant K268R that does not get ubiquitinated is still degraded by this pathway. Following agonist stimulation and subsequent ubiquitination of the receptor, a rapid ubiquitin-dependent mechanism speeds up the receptor degradation. Because of the lack of ubiquitination, the K268R mutant receptor degrades at a slower rate in the presence of agonist stimulation (Fig. 5c). It has been reported that in-frame fusion of a single ubiquitin moiety to an otherwise stable plasma membrane ATPase protein in yeast leads to rapid endocytosis and vacuolar degradation of the chimeric protein (14Shih S.C. Sloper-Mould K.E. Hicke L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies implicate postendocytic sorting to be mediated via ubiquitin-dependent mechanisms via the yeast Vps proteins and their mammalian homologs such as TSG101 and Hrs (15Piper R.C. Luzio J.P. Traffic. 2001; 2: 612-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 16Ponting C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Such recognition signals are single ubiquitin moieties on the endocytic cargo and the sorting proteins that are involved, such as Eps15 (17Polo S. Sigismund S. Faretta M. Guidi M. Capua M.R. Bossi G. Chen H. De Camilli P. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the cell surface protein GapI (general amino acid permease) becomes polyubiquitinated before being degraded in the yeast vacuole (18Helliwell S.B. Losko S. Kaiser C.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 649-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In general, variety in the number of ubiquitin moieties that could be covalently attached to a protein can modulate the trafficking signal generated by this post-translational modification. For many proteins, single ubiquitin attachment signals internalization, whereas polyubiquitination tags them for destruction. In the case of V2R, the presence of an ubiquitinated receptor as a smear on Western blots is indicative of receptor polyubiquitination, and our studies of wild type and K268R receptor half-lives confirm that ubiquitination is the signal for rapid receptor degradation. Our data are consistent with a number of mechanisms for V2 receptor degradation. Previous studies have suggested that V2 receptor can be degraded by processes that involve lysosomes, proteasomes, and cell membrane-bound metalloproteinases (19Lutz W. Sanders M. Salisbury J. Kumar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6507-6511Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 22Kojro E. Postina R. Gilbert S. Bender F. Krause G. Fahrenholz F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 538-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The rapid agonist-stimulated receptor degradation likely involves lysosomes, because like many seven-transmembrane-spanning receptors, it has been demonstrated that V2 receptor traffics to lysosomes upon agonist stimulation (19Lutz W. Sanders M. Salisbury J. Kumar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6507-6511Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Our data, however, indicate that polyubiquitination of the receptor and the proteasomal machinery are also likely to be involved in the agonist-stimulated degradation because the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 is necessary to observe V2 receptor ubiquitination. Proteasomal involvement in endosomal sorting to the lysosomes has been described for several plasma membrane proteins (19Lutz W. Sanders M. Salisbury J. Kumar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6507-6511Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 20Vecchione A. Marchese A. Henry P. Rotin D. Morrione A. Mol. Cell.

On the other hand, it is possible that the slow constitutive ubiquitin-independent degradation of the receptors might be carried out by other mechanisms such as the previously described cell membrane-bound metalloproteinases (22Kojro E.

We obtained data in spontaneously hypertensive rat hearts that indicated a partial inactivation of this enzyme before hypertrophy development. We tested the hypothesis that cardiac mitochondrial NADP+-isocitrate dehydrogenase is a target for modification by the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal, an aldehyde that reacts readily with protein sulfhydryl and amino groups. This hypothesis is supported by the following in vitro and in vivo evidence. In isolated rat heart mitochondria, enzyme inactivation occurred within a few minutes upon incubation with 4-hydroxynonenal and was paralleled by 4-hydroxynonenal/NADP+-isocitrate dehydrogenase adduct formation. Enzyme inactivation was prevented by the addition of its substrate isocitrate or a thiol, cysteine or glutathione, suggesting that 4-hydroxynonenal binds to a cysteine residue near the substrate's binding site. Using an immunoprecipitation approach, we demonstrated the formation of 4-hydroxynonenal/NADP+-isocitrate dehydrogenase adducts in the heart and their increased level (210%) in 7-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats compared with control Wistar Kyoto rats. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that mitochondrial NADP+-isocitrate dehydrogenase is a target for inactivation by 4-hydroxynonenal binding. Furthermore, the pathophysiological significance of our finding is supported by in vivo evidence. Taken altogether, our results have implications that extend beyond mitochondrial NADP+-isocitrate dehydrogenase. Indeed, they emphasize the implication of post-translational modifications of mitochondrial metabolic enzymes by 4-hydroxynonenal in the early oxidative stress-related pathophysiological events linked to cardiac hypertrophy development.

Indeed, they emphasize the implication of post-translational modifications of mitochondrial metabolic enzymes by 4-hydroxynonenal in the early oxidative stress-related pathophysiological events linked to cardiac hypertrophy development. Mitochondrial dysfunction is considered to play a key role in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy and failure. Chronic alterations of fuel metabolism and oxidative stress status are factors that could impair the capacity of the mitochondria to fulfil their crucial role in energy production (1Lesnefsky E.J.

Although the role of mitochondrial energy fuel deficits or of oxidative stress are often investigated separately, accumulating evidence indicates that these two factors are linked. For example, several metabolic enzymes can be inactivated through post-translational modifications by oxidative stress-related molecular components (4Chen J. Henderson G.I. Freeman G.L. J. Mol. Cell.

IUBMB Life. 2000; 50: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) as growing evidence indicates that the formation of HNE-protein adducts is a key event in many free radical-related effects in the heart. These effects include (i) disturbances of myocardial contraction and rhythm (4Chen J. Henderson G.I. Freeman G.L. J. Mol. Cell.

Among these enzymes is NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP+-ICDH), whose susceptibility to inactivation by nitric oxide has been demonstrated only recently (22Yang E.S. Richter C. Chun J.S. Huh T.L. Kang S.S. Park J.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 927-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Mammalian tissues contain two classes of NADP+-ICDH isoenzymes, mitochondrial NADP+-ICDH (mNADP+-ICDH) and cytosolic NADP+-ICDH, which are encoded by two distinct genes (23Yang L. Luo H. Vinay P. Wu J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 60: 400-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 24Huh T.L. Ryu J.H. Huh J.W. Sung H.C. Oh I.U. Song B.J. Veech R.L. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Both isoenzymes catalyze the reversible interconversion between isocitrate and α-ketoglutarate and have no known allosteric effector. It is unlike the bacterial enzyme, which is regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation (25Thorsness P.E. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10422-10425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mNADP+-ICDH isoform predominates (>95%) in the heart, where it is confined to cardiomyocytes (23Yang L. Luo H. Vinay P. Wu J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 60: 400-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 26Jo S.H. Son M.K. Koh H.J. Lee S.M. Song I.H. Kim Y.O. Lee Y.S. Jeong K.S. Kim W.B. Park J.W. Song B.J. Huh T.L.

Cytochem. 2003; 51: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). mNADP+-ICDH exists as a homodimer of 413 amino acids per subunit with a molecular mass of 47 kDa and a pI of 9.0 (cf. Swiss-Prot accession no. P33198). It shows a high degree of homology in protein structure and cDNA sequences between species (>90% between mice, pigs, bovines, and humans (23Yang L. Luo H. Vinay P. Wu J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 60: 400-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 24Huh T.L. Ryu J.H. Huh J.W. Sung H.C. Oh I.U. Song B.J. Veech R.L. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)). However, much remains to be learned about the role and regulation of mNADP+-ICDH in mammalian cells, and especially in the heart where it presents its highest activity and expression (23Yang L. Luo H. Vinay P. Wu J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 60: 400-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 24Huh T.L. Ryu J.H. Huh J.W. Sung H.C. Oh I.U. Song B.J. Veech R.L. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In 1994, Sazanov and Jackson (28Sazanov L.A. Jackson J.B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) proposed that reverse flux through mNADP+-ICDH, which generates isocitrate and NADP+, would be part of a substrate cycle to allow CAC flux to adapt more precisely to changes in energy demand. This cycle also includes the participation of the CAC enzyme NAD+-ICDH and H+-transhydrogenases to regenerate α-ketoglutarate and NADPH, respectively. By using 13C methods, we obtained data in the intact perfused rat heart that supported the Sazanov and Jackson hypothesis (29Comte B. Vincent G. Bouchard B. Benderdour M. Des Rosiers C. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2002; 283: H1505-H1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This interpretation is challenged by the data of Jo et al. (26Jo S.H. Son M.K. Koh H.J. Lee S.M. Song I.H. Kim Y.O. Lee Y.S. Jeong K.S. Kim W.B. Park J.W. Song B.J. Huh T.L. Huhe T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16168-16176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) in NIH3T3 cells, which support an antioxidant role of mNADP+-ICDH through NADPH regeneration. To reconcile all these data, we proposed (29Comte B. Vincent G. Bouchard B. Benderdour M. Des Rosiers C. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2002; 283: H1505-H1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) that in the heart, a tissue where the mitochondrial NADPH/NADP+ ratio is high (>50 compared with <1 in NIH3T3) and which could inhibit CAC flux (crucial for contraction), the metabolic role of mNADP+-ICDH could differ from that of other cell types. While investigating the potential redox regulation of mNADP+-ICDH in the heart, we obtained data indicating its inactivation before hypertrophy development. Our study model was the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR); Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats served as controls. Prompted by the potential pathophysiological significance of mNADP+-ICDH inactivation, we tested the hypothesis that mNADP+-ICDH is a target for binding by the lipid peroxidation product HNE. Animals—Animal experimentation was approved by the local ethics committee in compliance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Male SHR, WKY, and Wistar rats were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (St-Constant, QC, Canada). Prior to the day of the experiments, the rats were housed for ≥7 days in a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle facility with unlimited access to water and standard chow. SHR and control WKY rats were killed at 7 weeks of age. Body weights (n = 6) at the time of death were, respectively, 210 ± 10 g for SHR and 215 ± 15 g for WKY rats. The hearts were isolated under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia (65 mg × kg–1, intraperitoneal; MTC Pharmaceuticals), cannulated rapidly, flushed with a cold saline solution, freeze-clamped, and stored in liquid nitrogen until further analyses. Wistar rats (320–340 g) served for the isolation of heart mitochondria, as described below. Enzyme Activity—Total mNADP+-ICDH activity was assessed with a commercial kit (Sigma Diagnostics) in 100 mg of powdered tissues that were homogenized on ice in 1 ml of buffer containing 180 mm KCl, 5 mm MOPS, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 7 and centrifuged for 10 min at 800 × g at 4 °C. Supernatants were used for enzyme assays after 10-min centrifugation at 6,000 × g at 4 °C. Protein levels were measured with a kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma) serving as the standard. Activities are expressed in units/mg of proteins, where 1 unit is defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the conversion of 1 μmol substrate/min at 37 °C. Western Blotting—Proteins from roughly 100 mg of powdered heart tissues were extracted (as described above) with cold extraction buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, 10 μm each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, and 1 mm orthovanadate. After protein determination, 20 μg of tissue protein extract were subjected to discontinuous 4–12% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad), according to the method of Towbin et al. (30Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44893) Google Scholar). Membranes were immersed overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer (Roche Applied Science), diluted 10-fold in Tris-buffered saline (TBS: 20 mm Tris HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5), and incubated again overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer diluted 10-fold in 0.05% Tween-TBS containing rabbit anti-mouse mNADP+-ICDH (1:1,000; a generous gift of Dr. T. L. Huh, Kyungpook National University, Taegu, South Korea). Then, the membranes were washed with Tween-TBS and incubated for 1 h with goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:25,000; The Jackson Laboratory). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized with BM chemiluminescence blotting substrate (Roche Applied Science) diluted 1:100 in luminescence substrate solution according to the manufacturer's specifications. The membranes were exposed to Kodak X-AR5 film (Eastman Kodak), and the autoradiographs were scanned with the ChemiImager 4000 system (Alpha Innotech). Quantification was achieved by optical densitometry and expressed as a percentage of control values. Semi-quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)—Total RNAs were extracted from frozen powdered heart tissues with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Total RNAs were then treated with RNase-free DNase I following a standard protocol (Invitrogen). The integrity and quantity of the purified RNAs were controlled by formaldehyde denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis and by measurement of the A260/A280 ratio. RT-PCR assays were carried out with a programmable thermal controller (PTC-100, MJ Research Inc.). Two μg of total RNAs were reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) by incubation at 42 °C for 1 h with a 20-μl first-strand cDNA synthesis mixture containing 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg of random hexamers, 0.5 mm deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 10 units/μl reverse transcriptase (Moloney murine leukemia virus), and 2 units/μl of RNase inhibitor. cDNAs encoding mNADP+-ICDH, atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were amplified as follows. 5 μl of first-strand cDNA were added to the PCR mixture containing 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 5 units of TaqDNA polymerase, 10 μCi [α-35S]dCTP, and 100 ng of each of the sense and anti-sense-specific primers: mouse mNADP+-ICDH sense, 5′-GGCTGTGAGCTCGCTCTGCAGAGC-3′, and antisense, 5′-TCTTGGTGCTCAAGTAGAGCGGC-3′; rat ANF sense, 5′-ATCTGATGGATTTCAAGAACC-3′, and antisense, 5′-CTCCAATCCTGTCAATCCTACC-3′; and rat GAPDH sense, 5′-AGTGGACATTGTTGCCATCAACGACC-3′, and antisense, 5′-GTCATGAGCCCTTCCACGATGCCAA-3′. Briefly, cDNA was amplified for 20 or 25 cycles by incubation at 95 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, with a final incubation at 72 °C for 5 min. The number of cycles for amplification was selected on the basis of linearity of the PCR product (data not shown). Negative controls for RT-PCR were also run in parallel (data not shown). PCR products (10 μl/100 μl) were separated on 1.8% agarose gel and transferred electrophoretically onto nylon membranes (Hybond-N+, Amersham Biosciences) in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 7.8, 20 mm Tris, and 0.5 mm EDTA overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were then exposed to ultraviolet light to cross-link labeled cDNA, dried, and exposed again to Kodak films. The autoradiographs were scanned by ChemiImager. cDNA values for mNADP+-ICDH and ANF were normalized to that of GAPDH and expressed as a percentage of control values. Isolation and Incubation of Mitochondria—Intact rat heart mitochondria were used to evaluate the effect of the lipid peroxidation product HNE on mNADP+-ICDH activity. Mitochondria were isolated from Wistar rats as described by Nulton-Persson and Szweda (10Nulton-Persson A.C. Szweda L.I. J. Biol.

Briefly, isolated hearts were minced in ice-cold buffer (20 ml/g of tissue) containing 180 mm KCl, 5.0 mm MOPS, and 2.0 mm EGTA at pH 7.4 and homogenized in a Dounce glass homogenizer. Unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by 10-min centrifugation at 800 × g. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet containing the mitochondria was re-suspended in 20 ml of the same buffer and centrifuged again at 10,000 × g for 20 min before re-suspension in 200 μl of buffer. The mitochondrial suspension was kept at 4 °C and used within 1 h. Protein levels were measured by kit (Bio-Rad). For all studies, total mNADP+-ICDH activity was assessed as described above after incubation of mitochondria under the following conditions. (i) For dose-response studies, a volume of mitochondrial suspension equivalent to 40 μg of proteins was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in the presence of increasing concentrations (0–100 μm) of HNE (Cayman Chemical). (ii) For time-course studies, mitochondria were incubated for increasing periods of time (5–20 min) in the presence of 20 μm HNE. (iii) To test the protective effect of antioxidants against mNADP+-ICDH inhibition by HNE, we chose a thiol compound, either 0.5 mm cysteine or reduced glutathione (GSH), because of the known high reactivity of HNE to protein thiol groups. Cysteine or GSH was added to the mitochondrial incubation mixture 2 min prior to the addition of HNE. (iv) To assess the possibility of cofactor and substrate site modifications by HNE, mitochondria were incubated for 2 min with 1 mm NADP+ and/or 1 mm isocitrate before the addition of 20 μm HNE for 10 min. Under all conditions, the incubation was stopped by the addition of 0.5 mm cysteine. Immunoprecipitation—100 μg of tissue protein extract, incubated in the presence of 10, 20, or 50 μm HNE for 10 min, were pre-incubated with protein G resin (1:10 of a 50% slurry in water; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) at 4 °C with constant gentle shaking and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with rabbit anti-mouse mNADP+-ICDH antibody (1:1,000) in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, 10 μm each of aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, and 1 mm orthovanadate). For the in vivo detection of HNE/mNADP+-ICDH adducts, 500 μg of tissue protein extract from 7-week-old SHR and WKY rat hearts were subjected to immunoprecipitation, as described above, by using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 10% glycerol. After overnight incubation at 4 °C with constant gentle shaking, protein G resin was added, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After centrifugation, the resin was washed three times with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Proteins were removed from the resin by the addition of 100 μl of undiluted SDS-PAGE loading buffer. A 20-μl aliquot of the immunoprecipitated proteins was heated at 95 °C for 3 min prior to Western blot analysis, using rabbit anti-HNE antibody (1:1,000 dilution; Calbiochem) as the primary antibody. Tissue Levels of HNE-protein Adducts—Total tissue levels of HNE-protein adducts were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, as described by Toyokuni et al. (31Toyokuni S. Yamada S. Kashima M. Ihara Y. Yamada Y. Tanaka T. Hiai H. Seino Y. Uchida K. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2000; 2: 681-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) with some modifications. To prepare the HNE-BSA standard, BSA (Sigma) was dissolved in 50 mm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 5 mg BSA/ml), pH 7.2, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in the presence of 0.1 mm HNE. The HNE-BSA solution was then filtered and washed four times with PBS using 10,000 MWCO centrifugal filters (Millipore). Immulon II microtiter plates (VWR International) were precoated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μl of HNE-BSA standard or sample (tissue protein extracts concentrated 5-fold), washed four times with PBS, and then incubated with 200 μl of blocking buffer (5% BSA and 5% fetal bovine serum) for 4 h at room temperature. The blocking buffer was discarded, and the plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 200 μl of primary antibody rabbit anti-HNE (1:1,000 dilution in 0.05% Tween-PBS). After washing four times with Tween-PBS, 200 μl of the goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:50,000; The Jackson Laboratory) were added, and the plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Detection was carried out with a Sigma Fast™ POD kit (Sigma). After a 10- to 20-min incubation at room temperature, the reaction was stopped with 50 μl of 2N H2SO4, and absorbance at 450 nm was measured with a microplate reader. A linear response in the range up to 5 μg/ml of HNE-modified BSA standard was observed (slope = 0.30 ± 0.03; coefficient of correlation = 0.99; p < 0.0001). Statistical Analyses—Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical significance at p < 0.05 of differences between mean values was assessed by unpaired t test or one-way analysis of variance followed by a Bonferroni multiple-comparison post-test. Myocardial mNADP + -ICDH Activity Is Decreased in 7-week-old SHR—Cardiac hypertrophy development in SHR occurs between 9 and 12 weeks of age (32Shimamoto N. Goto N. Tanabe M. Imamoto T. Fujiwara S. Hirata M. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1982; 77: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Accordingly, compared with control age-matched WKY rats, 7-week-old SHR did not show any increase in myocardial mRNA levels of ANF, a marker of hypertrophy (data not presented). As depicted in Fig. 1, myocardial mNADP+-ICDH activity was 25% lower in 7-week-old SHR hearts than in WKY rats, but protein (Fig. 1B) and mRNA (Fig. 1C) levels were comparable in both rat species. Taken together, these results indicated the existence of a post-translational mechanism decreasing cardiac mNADP+-ICDH activity before hypertrophy development. mNADP + -ICDH Is a Target for HNE Binding—We tested the hypothesis of potential mNADP+-ICDH inactivation by HNE, a product of free radical-induced lipid peroxidation. Our choice of HNE was based on the following reasoning. (i) The progression of cardiac disease is associated with increased oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation (for recent reviews, see Refs. 33Sawyer D.B. Siwik D.A. Xiao L. Pimentel D.R. Singh K.

(ii) Because of its high chemical reactivity, HNE reacts readily with the amino acid residues of lysine and histidine, sulfhydryl groups of cysteine, and lipoate of proteins to form stable adducts (13Eaton P.

The stretches of linear peptide sequence recognized by these T cells, referred to as T cell epitopes, generally consist of 8–11 contiguous amino acids (1Wang J.H. Reinherz E.L. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 38: 1039-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 2Wilson I.A. Garcia K.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 839-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses play a central role in protective immunity against viral and intracellular bacterial infections (3Zinkernagel R.M. Science. 1996; 271: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 4Doherty P.C. Allan W. Eichelberger M. Carding S.R. Annu. Rev.

Therefore, identification of MHCI-bound (i.e. “restricted”) T cell epitopes that can induce cellular immunity is critical in the development of CD8+ T cell-based vaccines. Of the many CTL epitopes potentially available in a viral genome, antiviral CD8+ T cell responses usually focus on only one or two immunodominant peptides (6Yewdell J.W. Bennink J.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 51-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Apparently, the great majority of potential CTL epitopes are silent under physiological conditions. The mechanisms for this phenomenon, termed immunodominance, are poorly understood. Current rational design of CD8+ T cell vaccines is mainly focused on the induction of antiviral immunity by immunodominant CTL epitopes, assuming that protective CD8+ T cell immunity is mediated by recognition of immunodominant CTL epitopes. Such a vaccination regimen is indeed efficient in conferring immune protection against a variety of viral infections in murine models (7Schulz M. Zinkernagel R.M. Hengartner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 991-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 8Kast W.M. Roux L. Curren J. Blom H.J. Voordouw A.C. Meloen R.H. Kolakofsky D. Melief C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Vaccine. 1994; 12: 1281-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, many viruses, especially RNA viruses, evade immune clearance of CD8+ T cell-mediated mechanisms by mutating immunodominant CTL epitopes, as observed in a number of persistent, as well as acute, viral infections (10Moskophidis D. Zinkernagel R.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2187-2193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Price G.E. Ou R. Jiang H. Huang L. Moskophidis D. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1853-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To circumvent this escape mechanism, new vaccination strategies that target conserved CTL epitope regions of viral proteins are needed. Preliminary studies suggest that subdominant CTL epitopes may represent attractive potential candidates to induce a broader degree of antiviral CD8+ T cell immunity. It has been shown that both subdominant and even so-called “non-immunogenic” epitopes are capable of eliciting strong CD8+ T cell responses, if appropriately primed in vivo (12Cole G.A. Hogg T.L. Coppola M.A. Woodland D.L. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4301-4309PubMed Google Scholar, 13Oukka M. Riche N. Kosmatopoulos K. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4843-4851PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, several recent studies (14Oukka M. Manuguerra J.C. Livaditis N. Tourdot S. Riche N. Vergnon I. Cordopatis P. Kosmatopoulos K. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3039-3045PubMed Google Scholar, 15Fu T.M. Friedman A. Ulmer J.B. Liu M.A. Donnelly J.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2715-2721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have documented a partial immune protection against lethal viral challenge following immunization with subdominant or nonimmunogenic CTL epitopes. Thus, these epitopes are capable of participating in the effector function of cell-mediated antiviral immune responses. However, selection of appropriate candidate peptides has been difficult, requiring comprehensive biochemical and functional characterization of the natural CTL epitope population of an infectious agent. Traditional strategies for CTL epitope identification, such as overlapping peptide synthesis and antigen screening using T cell hybridoma-based immune recognition strategies, have limited power. In the present study, we explore combined bioinformatic and functional approaches to rapidly identify, from the genome of an infectious agent, CD8+ T cell peptide targets for CTL epitope-based vaccine design using the PR8 strain of influenza A virus as a model system. Initially, SYFPEITHI, a well established computer algorithm for prediction of MHCI binding peptides (16Rammensee H. Bachmann J. Emmerich N.P. Bachor O.A. Stevanovic S. Immunogenetics. 1999; 50: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1950) Google Scholar), was used to pre-select all possible peptides with potential mouse Db and Kb binding capacities from the genome of the influenza A virus. This method identified 148 potential binders. A second new computer algorithm, Probabilistic Model of Proteosomal Cleavage (PMPC), was then used to prospect the likelihood of proteasomal cleavage of the SYFPEITHI-predicted Db and Kb binders. Of these, 101 peptides scored with a high likelihood to be proteolytically processed by eukaryotic proteasomes. Detailed functional analysis of all potential CTL epitopes revealed that 16 peptides, 10 of which have not been identified previously, could be recognized by CD8+ T cells recovered directly ex vivo from lungs of influenza A virus-infected B6 mice. This number of naturally processed and in vivo presented viral CTL epitopes is considerably larger than previously thought. By investigating peptide binding interaction with MHC molecules, T cell repertoire potential, and aspects of viral protein processing, parameters influencing immune epitope display and recognition are revealed. CTL Epitope Prediction—All potential T cell epitopes encoded within the influenza A virus (strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34; PR8) proteome were predicted using the motif matrix-based algorithm SYFPEITHI (16Rammensee H. Bachmann J. Emmerich N.P. Bachor O.A. Stevanovic S. Immunogenetics. 1999; 50: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1950) Google Scholar) (syfpeithi.bmi-heidelberg.com/scripts/MHCServer.dll/home.htm). In the case of the Kb molecule, we chose a Kb-matrix specific for predicted 8-mers, given that most peptides that bind to Kb are of this length (17Rammensee H.G. Friede T. Stevanoviic S. Immunogenetics. 1995; 41: 178-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar). As Db binds both 9- and 10-mers (17Rammensee H.G. Friede T. Stevanoviic S. Immunogenetics. 1995; 41: 178-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar), two Db-specific matrices were used. We selected peptides that had a score of at least 51% of the optimum using the relevant matrices. The number of the predicted Kb and Db binders was 73 and 75, respectively, corresponding to 1.6% of all possible peptides from the PR8 proteome (see Table I and Supplemental Table S1).Table IDb- and Kb-restricted CTL epitopes predicted from influenza PR8 virusRNA segmentProtein productNo. of potential MHCl bindersaSYFPEITHI was used to predict the binding possibility of influenza PR8 virus-derived 8-, 9-, and 10-mer peptides to Db and Kb molecules.No. of potentially cleaved bindersbPotential Db and Kb binders predicted by SYFPEITHI were further screened by PMPC for their possible proteolytic cleavage by eukaryotic proteasomes.NameSizeACNcSWISSPROT database accession number (ACN) of the viral proteins.DbKbDbKbaa1PB2759P0342887662PB1757P0343113137113PA716P03433912864HA566P0345210129115NP498P03466510356NA454P03468107847M1252P034855423M297P0682112118NS1230P034964211NS2121P035083213Hypothetical protein (HP)167QQIVE15422Totals73754853a SYFPEITHI was used to predict the binding possibility of influenza PR8 virus-derived 8-, 9-, and 10-mer peptides to Db and Kb molecules.b Potential Db and Kb binders predicted by SYFPEITHI were further screened by PMPC for their possible proteolytic cleavage by eukaryotic proteasomes.c SWISSPROT database accession number (ACN) of the viral proteins. Open table in a new tab The number of potential CTL epitopes was further restricted by employing a PMPC, to predict whether a peptide C terminus is likely to result from proteasomal cleavage. This new method for the prediction of proteosome cleavage was developed using the SRILM statistical language model toolkit (18Stolcke A. Ohala J.J. Nearey T.M. Derwing B.L. Hodge M.M. Wiebe G.E. Proceedings of the International Conference on Spoken Language Processing. Vol. 2. Center for Spoken Language Research, Boulder, CO2002: 901-904Google Scholar) and will be described in detail. 2P. A. Reche, J.-P. Glutting, and E. L. Reinherz, manuscript in preparation. Accuracy of the model is ∼90% as determined by using a set of 932 natural MHCI-restricted peptides. Synthetic Peptides—A panel of 148 peptides derived from influenza PR8 virus was synthesized at New England Peptide, Inc., Fitchburg, MA, by solid phase strategy using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry on a Gilson AMS 422 synthesizer (Middleton, WI). HPLC analysis showed that the purity of the synthesized crude peptides was 86–92%. All peptides had expected masses as confirmed by mass spectrometry. The subscript numbers of each peptide indicate the amino acid positions starting from the N terminus of the corresponding PR8 protein. Crude peptides were used for initial peptide binding assays. Selected crude peptides were purified to >96% by reverse phase HPLC for further experiments in this study. MHCI-Peptide Binding and Dissociation Assays—Binding of individual synthetic peptides from PR8 virus to mouse H-2 Db and Kb molecules was evaluated by measuring stabilization of expression of MHCI molecules on the surface of the TAP-deficient mutant cell line RMA-S using flow cytometric analysis with anti-Db (clone HB-27) and anti-Kb (clone B24–8-3) mAb (19Preckel T. Grimm R. Martin S. Weltzien H.U. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1803-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). SD50 (peptide concentration that stabilizes 50% of the maximal number of Db or Kb molecules) was calculated (Abelbeck Software) from a non-linear regression of the data to the hyperbolic equation, f = f max (P)/[SD50 + (P)], where f is the mean fluorescence acquired at different concentrations of a peptide, (P) is the corresponding peptide concentrations tested, and f max is the maximal fluorescence induced by a peptide. The dissociation rate between peptides and MHCI molecules was determined using 1 μg/ml of GolgiPlug (containing monensin; BD Biosciences) to block the transportation of newly synthesized MHCI molecules from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the surface of RMA-S cells (20van der Burg S.H. Visseren M.J. Brandt R.M. Kast W.M. Melief C.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3308-3314PubMed Google Scholar). A half-life measure (t ½, the time required for 50% of the molecules to decay) was used to compare the stability of different peptide/MHC (pMHC) complexes. Infection of Mice with Influenza Virus—The working stock of influenza A/PR8/8/34 virus (PR8) used in this study was propagated and produced from a PR8 seed virus kindly provided by Dr. David Woodland, The Trudeau Institute, Saranac Lake, NY. The virus stock was titered either directly by hemagglutinin assay to obtain its hemagglutinin unit (HAU) or in 10-day old embryonated chicken eggs to determine its egg infectious dose (EID50). Female C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Taconic (Albany, NY) and housed under specific pathogen-free conditions at the animal core facility of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute prior to infection with influenza virus at 6–10 weeks of age. Mice were infected by inoculating 3000 EID50 of PR8 viral particles intranasally under anesthesia. Intracellular IFNγ Staining—Intracellular IFNγ staining was performed using the Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences). Briefly, cells from the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were pooled from 12–15 mice on day 10 after intranasal inoculation with PR8 virus. The cells were then cultured for 6 h in the presence of 10 μg/ml PR8-derived synthetic peptides and 1 μg/ml GolgiPlug. After culture, the responder cells were washed and stained with rat anti-CD8 phycoerythrin conjugate, followed by intracellular staining with rat anti-mouse IFNγ fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (BD Biosciences). Stained cells were acquired on a BD Biosciences FACScan flow cytometer, and the data were analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). The results are expressed as the percentage of CD8+IFNγ+ cells among total CD8+ T cells. BAL cells recovered from B6 mice infected with the virus for 10 days were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated NP366–374/Db and PA224–233/Db tetrameric reagents (The Trudeau Institute, Saranac Lake, NY) and Cy-Chrome-conjugated anti-mouse CD8 α mAb (BD Biosciences). Single Cell ELISPOT Assay—Single cell IFNγ-ELISPOT assay was performed as described previously (21Zhong W. Roberts A.D. Woodland D.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1379-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) except enriched CD8+ T cells from the lung of B6 mice infected with influenza PR8 virus for 10 days were used as effectors. The results were expressed as the number of antigen-specific spot-forming cells (SFC) per 1 × 104 CD8+ T cells. Assay resolution was determined by plating serially diluted PB1703–711-specific CD8+ CTL (see below) into the anti-mouse IFNγ mAb-coated ELISPOT plates. Upon activation with the corresponding peptide, a linear relationship between the numbers of CD8+ T cells plated and the numbers of IFNγ-producing spots was observed, with a 1/50,000 cells responsive frequency (data not shown). Generation of Short Term CD8 + T Cell Lines—Mice were injected subcutaneously with 50 μg of selected PR8-derived synthetic peptides emulsified in 100 μl of complete Freund's Adjuvant at the base of the tail. 10 to 15 days following peptide immunization, 1.5 × 107 splenocytes were cultured in T25 flasks in 10 ml of complete RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.5–1 μg/ml of the corresponding peptide. Cell cultures were fed with 10 units/ml of recombinant human IL-2 (rIL-2; BD Biosciences) on day 4. After an initial 7-day culture, viable cells were selected by centrifugation through Lympholyte-M (Cedarlane, Hornby, Ontario, Canada). 1.0 to 1.5 × 106 responder cells were then restimulated weekly with 1.5 × 107 irradiated (3000 rads) splenocytes from naïve B6 mice in T25 flasks in the presence of 1 μg/ml of peptide and 10 units/ml of rIL-2. Lympholyte-enriched viable CD8+ T cells were assayed for cytotoxic activity in a 51Cr release assay on day 5 after three to five rounds of restimulation in vitro. 51Cr Release Assay—To generate PR8-infected target cells, 2 × 106 mouse EL-4 lymphoma cells were washed and resuspended in 400 μl of serum-free RPMI medium. The cells were then incubated with 10 HAU (standard dose) of PR8 viral particles for 1 h at 37 °C. Alternatively, the same number of EL-4 cells was infected with 200 HAU (high dose) of the viral particles as indicated. Virally infected cells were transferred to 6-well plates containing 6 ml of complete RPMI medium per well and incubated overnight. To generate peptide-pulsed target cells, 1–2 × 106 EL-4 cells were incubated with 20 μg/ml of individual influenza peptides in 500 μl of complete RPMI medium for 1 h at 37 °C. Both PR8-infected and peptide-pulsed EL-4 target cells were washed twice and then labeled with 150 μl of 51Cr (Na51CrO4; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 90 min at 37 °C. Unpulsed but 51Cr-labeled EL-4 cells were used as control target cells. After washing three times, 1 × 104 target cells were incubated with titrated concentrations of CD8+ T effectors in a final volume of 200 μl. 100 μl of supernatants were removed after 5 h incubation for γ radiation counting. Immunoprecipitation—RMA-S cells and EL-4 cells were either pulsed with PR8 virus-derived synthetic peptides or infected with a high dose of live PR8 viral particles as described above. Untreated RMA-S cells and EL-4 cells were prepared as controls. The cells were then lysed on ice for 10 min with immunoprecipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl) containing 1.5% CHAPS, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 25 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor (all from Sigma). Peptide-bound Db molecules were immunoprecipitated by anti-Db mAb (clone HB-27)-coated GammaBindPlus-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), washed, covered with 50 μl of Tris buffer, and stored at –80 °C before analysis by mass spectrometry. Nanospray Tandem Mass Spectrometry on a Quadrapole Time of Flight Spectrometer—The nanospray MS/MS used for identification of PR8 virus-derived peptides from the virally infected EL-4 cells in the present study is described in detail in the Supplemental Material. In brief, the MS spectrum of a typical peptide extract is characterized by a set of peaks spaced by m/z corresponding to doubly charged ions with mass deficits characteristic of peptides. An arbitrary m/z window (of unit resolution) contains multiple parent ions, and an MS/MS spectrum of the selected m/z window contains a complex mixture of fragments. Prior to the analysis of the extract, the MS/MS spectrum of the isolated target peptide (a synthetic standard) is taken under defined (and optimized) collision conditions, and this (reference) spectrum identifies the m/z windows that contain the target peptide's fragments and their relative intensity. This statistical measure considers the m/z-dependent arrival of the fragment ions as a Poisson process and formally calculates the probability that the MS/MS spectrum of the mixture would support N parent ions that fragment with the m/z distribution contained in the reference MS/MS spectrum. In brief, the reference MS/MS spectrum defines relative arrival rates for the fragmentation of the target peptide whereas the experimental MS/MS spectrum records the net ion arrivals (counts) for the measurement period (e.g. 20 min). The m/z values that have positive intensity in the reference spectrum are interpreted in the experimental spectrum as a sum of fragments from the target peptide and chemical background. The probability P(N) that the experimental spectrum supports at least N total events, distributed by the arrival rates of the reference spectrum, is calculated by determining the expected number of each fragment event, nm / z , given N total events. If the measured counts in the fragment m/z window are greater than the expected nm / z , the associated probability is set to 1 (the unexpectedly large counts are because of chemical background) whereas if the counts are less than nm / z , the probability that this is a statistical fluctuation of the Poisson process is calculated. The product of these probabilities over all the fragment m/z values generates the decreasing function P(N). The absolute magnitude of P(N) depends on experimental details such as collection period, signal intensity, and chemical background. To offset these variations the reference pattern is translated in m/z space (denoted by x) before calculating P(N). The function P(N, x) is then a surface that is displayed as a contour plot, and the signature of detecting the target peptide becomes a prominent peak at zero translation, P(N, 0). A dominant peak at 0 translation means the MS/MS data of the experiment support the intensity ratios of the reference spectrum primarily at the reference m/z values. The Poisson measure is robust in the presence of background overlaps with some of the target peptide's MS/MS peaks; the failure to measure enough counts in any of the expected fragment windows rapidly decreases the probability of detection. The MS/MS spectra of the synthetic peptides were measured under collision conditions optimized for each peptide, creating a library of reference MS/MS spectra. The pMHC complexes were isolated by immunoprecipitation from EL-4 total cell lysates as described above, and peptides were extracted by mild acid treatment of the antibody-coated beads. The peptide mixture was desalted by reverse phase and loaded into a nanospray tip, and the MS/MS spectra of the m/z windows corresponding to the reference spectra were measured under the pre-established collision conditions. The Poisson measure of the reference spectrum in the mixture MS/MS spectrum is then calculated as outlined above. Computational Prediction of All Potential H-2 Db- and Kb-restricted CTL Epitopes Encoded by the Influenza PR8 Virus Genome—Two important biological processes determine whether a peptide segment within a native protein can be naturally presented by a given MHCI molecule: 1) proteolytic processing within the cell required to liberate the peptide (22Sijts A.J. Villanueva M.S. Pamer E.G. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1497-1503PubMed Google Scholar); and 2) binding of the excised peptide to the MHCI molecule with sufficient affinity to create a stable epitope as a cell surface pMHC for CTL recognition (23Sette A. Vitiello A. Reherman B. Fowler P. Nayersina R. Kast W.M. Melief C.J. Oseroff C. Yuan L. Ruppert J. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5586-5592PubMed Google Scholar). We used a computer-based algorithm, SYFPEITHI (16Rammensee H. Bachmann J. Emmerich N.P. Bachor O.A. Stevanovic S. Immunogenetics. 1999; 50: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1950) Google Scholar), to predict all potential Db and Kb binding epitopes from the PR8 genome of influenza A virus. Influenza A virus is a negatively stranded RNA virus (24Lamb R.A. Krug R.M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Vol. 2. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia, PA1996: 1353-1395Google Scholar) whose genome consists of eight RNA segments that encode 11 protein products (Table I). To identify potential Db and Kb binders encoded by the viral genome, the amino acid sequences of each of the eleven viral proteins were searched by SYFPEITHI for all possible 8- and 9- or 10-mer peptide fragments with binding potential for Kb and Db molecules, respectively. Only peptides with an arbitrary binding score of >50% of the maximal binding score were selected as “hits,” resulting in a total of 148 peptides, including 73 potential Db and 75 potential Kb binders (see Table I and Supplemental Table S1). These peptides comprise 1.6% of the total potential numbers of influenza A virus-encoded peptides. The predictions were further verified by RANKPEP, our recently developed computer algorithm (25Reche P.A. Glutting J.P. Reinherz E.L. Hum. Immunol. 2002; 63: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The proteasome is the most critical protease system for generating the C-terminal end of a MHCI-restricted CTL epitope (for review see Refs. 26Monaco J.J. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 173-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar and 27Shastri N. Schwab S. Serwold T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 463-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). To assess whether the predicted Db and Kb binders would be processed by proteasomes, we developed a computer-based algorithm, named PMPC, to predict cleavage. As shown in Table I, 101 of 148 PR8-derived peptides showed high likelihood to be cleaved by eukaryotic proteasomes. Thus, by introducing a proteasomal cleavage motif-based algorithm, we reduced the potential numbers of CTL epitopes by 32%, from 148 to 101. Assuming these sequence algorithms are good predictors of CTL epitopes, the known immunogenic Db- and Kb-restricted CTL epitopes of the PR8 virus should be identified among the predicted potential CTL epitopes. As shown in Supplemental Table S1, with a single exception (Kb-restricted, subdominant 9-mer peptide PB1703–711), all four other known strong H-2b MHCI binders representing immunogenic CTL epitopes of the PR8 virus in H-2b mice were anticipated. This list includes the two identified immunodominant CTL epitopes (NP366–374 and PA224–233) (28Townsend A.R. Rothbard J. Gotch F.M. Bahadur G. Wraith D. McMichael A.J. Cell. 1986; 44: 959-968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar, 29Belz G.T. Stevenson P.G. Doherty P.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2404-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), among the top 1.6% of the scoring peptides, and correctly predicts that they and NS1133–140 would be proteolytically cleaved. However, M1128–135 is not identified by this proteosome prediction algorithm. MHCI Binding Affinities of the Predicted Db- and Kb-associated Epitopes—The 148 candidate epitopes were synthesized, and their binding affinity to Db and Kb molecules was determined by RMA-S assay. The SD50 (peptide concentration that stabilizes 50% of the maximal number of Db or Kb molecules) was calculated based upon the binding curve of individual peptides. In this way, it was possible to quantitatively assess Db and Kb binding affinity. Overall, 22 (10 Db- and 12 Kb-restricted) peptides bound with high affinity (SD50 <500 nm) whereas 92 peptides (42 Db- and 50 Kb-restricted) bound with intermediate affinity (500 nm < SD50 < 15 μm). The remaining 34 peptides showed minimal (SD50 >15 μm) or no detectable MHCI binding, even at the maximal peptide concentration tested (100 μm). In summary, 114 of 148 (77%) SYFPEITHI-predicted potential CTL epitopes from PR8 virus bound to murine Db and Kb MHCI molecules with high or intermediate affinity. As expected from previous studies (30Belz G.T. Xie W. Altman J.D. Doherty P.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3486-3493Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 31Belz G.T. Xie W. Doherty P.C. J.

Most notably, however, 17 additional strong MHCI binders were identified in the present study, 10 of which have not been reported previously. Together, the data demonstrate that matrix-based algorithms can serve as powerful computational tools to predict with reasonable accuracy potential MHCI binding epitopes from viral proteins.Table IIExperimentally identified strong Db- and Kb binders and the stability of those MHCI-peptide complexesPeptideaPeptides in bold indicate the known immunogenic CD8+ T cell epitopes.Sequence/MHC restrictionProteasomal cleavagebProteasomal cleavage possibility predicted by PMPC algorithm. +, cleavage predicted; -, cleavage not predicted; Not considered, not among the top 1.6% of the potential MHCI binders when e"

All these structures reveal sugar intermediates bound in a distorted 1S5 skew boat conformation.

N-Linked glycosylation is a post-translational modification found in eukaryotes whereby a complex oligosaccharide is attached to a surface asparagine residue within the sequence Asn-X-(Ser/Thr) through an N-glycosidic linkage. The initial part of the pathway, occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum, is highly conserved and has been well characterized in various organisms (1Burda P. Aebi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 2Herscovics A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 96-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 3Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3770) Google Scholar). The latter Golgi part is species-, tissue-, and cell-dependent and is the source of the diverse nature of glycosylation. In various tumor cell lines such as those from breast, colon, and skin cancer, the distribution of the cell surface N-linked sugars is altered (4Couldrey C. Green J.E. Breast Cancer Res. 2000; 2: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Because N-linked glycosylation is associated with cell-cell interactions, this alteration correlates with the progression of tumor metastasis (5Dennis J.W. Granovsky M. Warren C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 21-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 6Granovsky M. Fata J. Pawling J. Muller W.J. Khokha R. Dennis J.W. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Enzymes of this glycosylation pathway are therefore potential targets for the development of inhibitors as cancer treatments.

In early clinical trials, the compound swainsonine, a well known GMII inhibitor, was found to reduce tumor growth and metastasis when taken orally (7Goss P.E. Baker M.A. Carver J.P. Dennis J.W. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 935-944PubMed Google Scholar, 8Goss P.E. Reid C.L. Bailey D. Dennis J.W. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 1077-1086PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-reactivity of swainsonine with lysosomal mannosidase limits its clinical usefulness, and, therefore, a detailed understanding of the mechanism of GMII is necessary to develop drug candidates that specifically target this glycosidase.

From the primary structure, GMII has been classified into the glycosyl hydrolase family 38 (9Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2615) Google Scholar, 10Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar, 11Henrissat B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Members of this family of glycosidases hydrolyze α-mannosides with net retention of configuration at the anomeric center (12Howard S. Braun C. McCarter J. Moremen K.W. Liao Y.F. Withers S.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 896-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). By analogy with other retaining glycosidases, these enzymes are postulated to catalyze reactions by a double displacement mechanism (13Koshland D.E. Biol. Rev. 1953; 28: 416-436Crossref Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 14Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1490) Google Scholar, 15Zechel D.L. Withers S.G. Acc. Chem. Res. 2000; 33: 11-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this mechanism, a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate is first formed via an oxocarbenium ion-like transition state (glycosylation). A carboxylic acid in the active site acts as the catalytic nucleophile in the formation of this intermediate, assisted by a second carboxylic acid that acts as a general acid catalyst. Hydrolysis of the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate (deglycosylation) occurs in a second step, facilitated by general base catalysis provided by the conjugate base of the acid catalyst from the first step. By using a mechanism-based inactivator, 5-fluoro-β-l-gulosyl fluoride (5FGulF), the covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate formed on two representative members of this family has been trapped, and the residue acting as the catalytic nucleophile was identified in each case (16Howard S. He S.M. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2067-2072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 17Numao S. He S.M. Evjen G. Howard S. Tollersrud O.K. Withers S.G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The structure of the catalytic portion of the GMII from Drosophila melanogaster (dGMII) was determined by x-ray crystallography along with structures of complexes with several ligands, namely swainsonine and deoxymannojirimycin (18van den Elsen J.M.H. Kuntz D.A. Rose D.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3008-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The ligand binding site features coordination to a zinc ion and includes a conserved aspartate residue, Asp-204 (dGMII numbering), analogous to the residue identified in the previous trapping studies as the catalytic nucleophile. These results further suggested that the acid/base catalyst is most likely Asp-341. These structures, however, only give a first insight into the structural aspects of the catalytic mechanism. A key element of the catalytic mechanism is the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate formed during catalysis. Determination of the structure of such intermediates has provided more detailed insights, not only into the residues involved in catalysis, but also into the possible role of saccharide distortion along the reaction pathway, as discussed recently (19Davies G. Ducros V.M. Varrot A. Zechel DL. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 523-527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), primarily for β-glycosidases. Recent studies of β-glycosidases have revealed substrate distortion in Michaelis (enzyme-substrate) complexes but not in α-glycosyl-enzyme intermediates (with the exception of the family 11 xylanase (20Sidhu G. Withers S.G. Nguyen N.T. McIntosh L.P. Ziser L. Brayer G.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5346-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and of the family 26 β-mannanase (21Ducros V.M.A. Zechel D.L. Murshudov G.N. Gilbert H.J. Szabo L. Stoll D. Withers S.G. Davies G.J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2002; 41: 2824-2827Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar)). Until now, no structure of trapped intermediates on a true α-glycosidase has yet been published, though the structure of the β-glycosyl-enzyme intermediate on a family 13 transglycosidase, the cyclodextrin glucanotransferase from Bacillus circulans was reported (22Uitdehaag J.C. Mosi R. Kalk K.H. van der Veen B.A. Dijkhuizen L. Withers S.G. Dijkstra B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). In this paper we have used both 5FGulF and 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α-d-mannosyl fluoride (2FManF) to trap the glycosylenzyme intermediates formed on both the wild-type (wt) and D341N mutant of dGMII and examined the crystallographic structures of these intermediates. These are the first structures of covalent intermediates determined for any α-mannosidase. Furthermore, this is the first true α-glycoside hydrolase for which the structure of the covalent intermediate has been determined. As such, these studies add to our understanding of how α-glycosidases catalyze hydrolysis of glycosidic linkages. The 2,4-dinitrophenyl α-d-mannoside (DNP-Man) (23Sharma S.K. Corrales G. Penades S. Tetrahedron Lett. 1995; 36: 5627-5630Crossref Google Scholar), 5FGulF (16Howard S. He S.M. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2067-2072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and 2FManF (24Hall L.D. Johnson R.N. Adamson J. Foster A.B. Can. J. Chem. 1971; 49: 118-123Crossref Google Scholar) were synthesized according to published procedures. All chemicals and buffer salts were obtained from Sigma unless noted otherwise. To facilitate mutagenesis, the expression plasmid for dGMII (18van den Elsen J.M.H. Kuntz D.A. Rose D.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3008-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), which contains a metallothioneine promoter and Bip-secretion sequence, was first reduced in size from 6642 to 4610 bp by SalI digestion followed by re-ligation. The single codon mutation was introduced to this plasmid using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The forward primer had the sequence CTG CTG ATT CCG TTG GGT GAC AAC TTC CGC TTC AAG C. The presence of the mutation was confirmed by sequencing. A 238-bp AdeI/partial SalI fragment, which contained the mutated sequence, was then excised from the plasmid and inserted into an AdeI/partial SalI-digested native expression plasmid. The presence of the mutation and the absence of any frameshifts or secondary mutations were confirmed by sequencing the final construct. This D341N construct and a blasticidin resistance plasmid were then used to co-transfect Drosophila cells. The presence of the secreted, full-length protein in the medium from transfected cells induced with 10 μm cadmium was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Anti-pentaHis antibody (Qiagen) was used as the primary antibody whereas an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody was used as the secondary antibody. Alkaline phosphatase activity was monitored with NBT/BCIP reagent (Sigma). Stable populations of transfectants were selected using blasticidin (16 μg/ml). Single cell clones expressing the highest levels of protein were chosen by Western blot analysis for use in large scale expression. These cells were grown up and adapted to serum-free medium (ExCell 420; JRH Biosciences). Growth of stable S2 cells expressing the D341N mutant dGMII and purification of the mutant protein was similar to the procedure described for the wt enzyme (18van den Elsen J.M.H. Kuntz D.A. Rose D.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3008-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Steady State Kinetics—All studies of the dGMII were carried out at 37 °C in 50 mm MES buffer, pH 5.6, containing 0.1 mm ZnSO4 and 0.1% bovine serum albumin unless specified otherwise. Determination of kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of DNP-Man by wt and D341N mutant dGMII were performed by following the increase in the absorbance at 400 nm upon the addition of enzyme (typically 3 and 30 nm final concentration of enzyme, respectively) at varying substrate concentrations (typically 10–12 points). Measurements were made in 1-cm-path length quartz cuvettes with a UNICAM UV4 UV-visible spectrophotometer attached to a circulating water bath or a Varian CARY 4000 spectrophotometer attached to a temperature control unit. The kinetic parameters were estimated by direct fit of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the program GraFit 4.0.14 (25Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit, Version 4.0.14. Erithacus Software Limited, Surrey, UK2001Google Scholar). Approximate Ki values for both 5FGulF and 2FManF with the mutant enzyme were determined by measuring the rate of hydrolysis of DNP-Man (0.1 mm) at a number of varying inhibitor concentrations. The data were plotted in the form of a Dixon plot (1/rate versus [inhibitor]) and then fit to a line using the program GraFit 4.0.14. The Ki value was determined from the intersection of this line and the line for y = 1/Vmax, assuming competitive inhibition. The kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of 5FGulF and 2FManF by wt dGMII were determined by measuring the increase in fluoride ion concentration upon the addition of enzyme in the appropriate buffer (typically 10 and 20 nm enzyme final enzyme concentrations, respectively) at varying “substrate” concentrations (typically 6–8 points). Measurements were made using an ORION 96–04 combination fluoride electrode interfaced to a personal computer running the program LoggerPro (Vernier Software). In the case of 2FManF, saturation was not seen, and as such, the data collected at low substrate concentrations were fit to a line using linear regression to determine the kcat/Km value. Inactivation Studies—The inactivation of the D341N mutant dGMII by 5FGulF was monitored by incubating the enzyme (1.2 mg ml–1) under the above conditions in the presence of various concentrations of 5FGulF at 16 °C. Residual activities were determined at various time intervals by adding 10-μl aliquots of the inactivation mixture to a solution of DNP-Man (1.5 mm, 110 μl) in the above buffer and measuring DNP release for 30 s at 16 °C. Pseudo-first order inactivation rate constants were determined by fitting the data for the residual activity versus time to a first order rate equation using the program GraFit 4.0.14 (25Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit, Version 4.0.14. Erithacus Software Limited, Surrey, UK2001Google Scholar). The ki/Ki value was extracted from the slope of the plot of kobs against 5FGulF concentration. The inactivation of the wt dGMII by 5FGulF was observed in the same manner except that the enzyme concentration was lower (0.22 mg ml–1), and the temperature of the experiment was reduced to 8 °C. The analyses of protein samples were carried out using a Sciex API-300 mass spectrometer interfaced with an LC-Packings high pressure liquid chromatography system. Briefly, the intact protein (10–20 μg) was pre-incubated for 5 min with either 4 mm 5FGulF (wt or D341N mutant dGMII) or 40 mm 2FManF (D341N mutant dGMII). This sample was introduced into the mass spectrometer through a microbore PRLP column (1 × 50 mm) and eluted with a gradient of 20–100% Solvent B (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid/90% CH3CN in water) in Solvent A (0.06% trifluoroacetic acid/2% CH3CN in water) at a flow rate of 50 μl/min over 10 min. The mass spectrum was scanned over a range of 600 to 2400 Da (4 s/scan) with a step size of 0.5 Da. The ion source voltage was 4.8 kV, and the orifice energy was 50 V. Crystallization of dGMII was carried out using hanging drop vapor diffusion as described previously (18van den Elsen J.M.H. Kuntz D.A. Rose D.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3008-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Because of a relatively rapid loss of diffraction quality with time, crystals were less than 24 h old at the time of crystal evaluation and freezing. For the 2FManF and native protein complexes, the crystals were grown in the absence of inhibitor and then soaked with the compound for ∼30 min. Prior to freezing, the crystals were passed through drops containing 10, 15, 20, and 25% methyl-pentanediol in crystallization buffer and 5 mm of appropriate compound. The crystals were mounted in nylon CryoLoops (Hampton Research) and frozen directly in a liquid nitrogen cryostream. All data were collected at 100 K. Data were collected either at the Ontario Cancer Institute on a MAR Research 2300 image plate detector mounted on a rotating anode generator with copper target, operated at 50 kV and 100 mA with beam focusing using Osmic optics, or at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source, beamline F1, using an ADSC Quantum 4 CCD detector in the rapid readout mode. Typically 300–400 frames of 0.5° oscillation were collected for each data set. Data reduction and scaling were carried out using Denzo and Scalepack, respectively (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

For the calculation of Rfree, a test set comprising ∼2000 reflections was removed from the data set. The structures of the complexes were solved by molecular replacement. Briefly, rigid body refinement was carried out against the published structure of native dGMII (Protein Data Bank code 1HTY) with Tris and water molecules in the region of the active site removed (18van den Elsen J.M.H. Kuntz D.A. Rose D.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3008-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Asp-204 was changed to alanine in the Protein Data Bank file to remove bias around the region of formation of the covalent bond. Rigid body refinement was followed by simulated annealing to 3500 K, group B-factor refinement, and individual B-factor refinement, prior to generation of electron density maps. At this initial stage R-factors were typically in the range of 22%, and the Fo – Fc density maps clearly showed the presence of bound compound and unassigned waters. Refinement of the model involving manually fitting the compounds into the density, fitting waters, and checking side-chains for proper fit to the density was carried out with O (29Jones T.A. Zhou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar), with intermittent rounds of energy minimization using CNS. Automated water-picking and deletion of weak waters were carried out using the automated routines from CNS, and the picked waters were checked manually. Once all waters and side chains were fit another round of simulated annealing and B-factor refinement was performed. Clear alternate conformations of side chains were then inserted, followed by individual B-factor refinement. Model correctness was checked with The MolProbity server (kinemage.biochem.duke.edu/molprobity) and the WhatIf server (www.biotech.ebi.ac.uk:8400/). Protein overlays and r.m.s.d. calculations were carried out using ProFit (www.bioinf.org.uk/software/profit). Graphics were generated using Pymol (30DeLano W.L. Pymol. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). Protein Data Bank (31Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27305) Google Scholar) codes for the deposited coordinates and diffraction data are given in Table I. Kinetic Analysis—The kinetic parameters for the activated substrate, DNP-Man, were determined for both the wt and D341N mutant enzyme. As might be expected from removal of the acid/base catalyst, the kcat value for the D341N mutant dGMII was lower by roughly 200-fold compared with that of the wt enzyme (kcat values are 0.048 and 8.6 s–1, respectively). The Km value for the mutant enzyme was also 2 orders of magnitude lower compared with the Km value of the wt enzyme (Km value are 0.05 and 5.5 mm, respectively). This lowering of the Km value is unlikely to be because of a tightening of the true binding, but is more likely because of an accumulation of the intermediate species as a result of the deglycosylation step becoming rate-limiting. This behavior is also reflected in the fact that the kcat/Km value, which reflects the first irreversible step, most likely glycosylation, is largely unaltered. This is reasonable, because a good leaving group such as DNP requires very little proton assistance for departure, thus removal of the acid catalyst will not significantly affect the glycosylation step. However, removal of general base catalysis clearly slows down the second step, deglycosylation. Thus the intermediate accumulates. Nonetheless, turnover of the intermediate species was unfortunately sufficiently rapid to prevent us from observing the intermediate in crystals of the D341N mutant dGMII soaked with DNP-Man. When 5FGulF was incubated with the D341N mutant dGMII at 37 °C, the compound was found to act as an apparent reversible inhibitor with an approximate Ki value of 0.6 mm. Considering that the wt enzyme has a Km value of 5 mm for DNP-Man, 5FGulF binds considerably more tightly than might be expected for a very simple substrate analogue, especially considering its minimal aglycone (fluoride) and the inverted configuration at C-5. This result is suggestive, however, of 5FGulF acting as a slow substrate with a rate-limiting deglycosylation step, as is seen with some other 5-fluorosugars and their corresponding glycosidases (16Howard S. He S.M. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2067-2072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 17Numao S. He S.M. Evjen G. Howard S. Tollersrud O.K. Withers S.G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 32McCarter J.D. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6889-6894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). When 5FGulF was assayed as an inactivator, no inactivation was observed, presumably because the deglycosylation step is still fast relative to the assay time. However, when the mutant enzyme was incubated with 5FGulF, and the residual activity was assayed at 16 °C, time-dependent inactivation was indeed observed with a second order rate constant, ki/Ki value of 33 s–1m–1 (Fig. 1, a and b). When excess 5FGulF was removed the inactivated enzyme was found to reactivate over time, demonstrating the catalytic competence of the intermediate formed upon hydrolysis of 5FGulF by the D341N mutant dGMII. The above results suggest that 5FGulF is acting as a slow substrate for the D341N mutant dGMII, with deglycosylation as the rate-limiting step. Inactivation is only observed when assayed at low temperatures such that deglycosylation is slow relative to the assay time. To confirm whether this also applied to the wt enzyme, 5FGulF was assayed as a substrate using the fluoride ion electrode. At 37 °C, 5FGulF was found to be a substrate of wt dGMII with a kcat value of 5.1 × 10–3 s–1 and a Km value of 0.2 mm. As in the case of the mutant enzyme, the relatively low Km value is likely because of the accumulation of the intermediate species as a result of the deglycosylation step becoming rate-limiting. Consistent with this hypothesis, when the wt dGMII was incubated with 5FGulF and the residual activity assayed at 8 °C, time-dependent inactivation was observed. The reactivation, however, was too rapid for the determination of any reliable kinetic parameters. Although the 2-deoxy-2-fluorosugars have been successfully used to label β-retaining glycosidases, they have proven quite ineffective with α-retaining glycosidases. Therefore, it was not surprising that all attempts at trying to inactivate either wt or D341N mutant dGMII with 2FManF were unsuccessful. Instead, the 2FManF was found to be a substrate of wt dGMII with a pseudo-second order rate constant, kcat/Km, of 8.5 × 10–5 s–1m–1 (where the Km > 25 mm). This high Km value is most likely a reflection of the 2-hydroxyl group being important to substrate binding, which would not be surprising given the previously observed role of the 2- and 3-hydroxyl groups in binding to the active site zinc (18van den Elsen J.M.H. Kuntz D.A. Rose D.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3008-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, because of the extremely low kcat value, it was not possible to determine any kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of 2FManF by the D341N mutant dGMII. However, when tested as a reversible inhibitor, a Ki value of 7.5 mm was determined for this compound with the D341N mutant dGMII. Once again, this value is considerably lower than the Km value for 2FManF hydrolysis with wt dGMII, suggesting that 2FManF is a very slow substrate of the mutant enzyme with a rate-limiting deglycosylation step. Mass Spectrometric Analysis—The kinetic analysis clearly indicates that there is accumulation of an intermediate species in the case of the hydrolysis of 5FGulF by either the wt or D341N mutant dGMII. The results also suggest that the deglycosylation step is rate-limiting for hydrolysis of 2FManF by D341N mutant dGMII, likely resulting in an accumulation of an intermediate species. To determine the nature of these intermediate species, each was analyzed using electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. Compared with the free D341N mutant enzyme (120,502 ± 20 Da), the mass of the inactivated D341N mutant enzyme (120672 ± 20 Da) was greater by 170 Da (see Fig. 1c for representative data). This value corresponds, within experimental error, to the expected increase of 181 Da for the addition of a covalently bonded 5-fluoro-gulosyl moiety. A similar increase in mass was observed when comparing the mass of the free wt dGMII with that of the inactivated wt enzyme. This demonstrates that a covalent intermediate is also formed during the hydrolysis of 5FGulF by wt dGMII. Incubation of the D341N mutant dGMII with 2FManF yielded a species with a mass (120,634 ± 20 Da) higher by 166 than that of the free enzyme (120,468 ± 20 Da). This corresponds to the covalent addition of a 2-fluoro-mannosyl moiety to the enzyme (theoretical change, 165 Da). Only ∼50% of the enzyme was labeled under these conditions, most likely because of the rapid turnover of the intermediate species at steady state. This is consistent with the failure of 2FManF to inactivate dGMII. However, the observation of a covalent species clearly shows that the hydrolysis of 2FManF by the mutant enzyme goes via a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate and that this intermediate accumulates during steady state hydrolysis. Structure of the Intermediate Formed from wt dGMII Reaction of 5FGulF—We have been able to obtain a very high resolution structure (1.20"
https://openalex.org/W2109283416,"Bacteria have evolved a number of tightly controlled import and export systems to maintain intracellular levels of the essential but potentially toxic metal nickel. Nickel homeostasis systems include the dedicated nickel uptake system nik found in Escherichia coli, a member of the ABC family of transporters, that involves a periplasmic nickel-binding protein, NikA. This is the initial nickel receptor and mediator of the chemotactic response away from nickel. We have solved the crystal structure of NikA protein in the presence and absence of nickel, showing that it behaves as a “classical” periplasmic binding protein. In contrast to other binding proteins, however, the ligand remains accessible to the solvent and is not completely enclosed. No direct bonds are formed between the metal cation and the protein. The nickel binding site is apolar, quite unlike any previously characterized protein nickel binding site. Despite relatively weak binding, NikA is specific for nickel. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, the dissociation constant for nickel was found to be ∼10 μm and that for cobalt was approximately 20 times higher.

Using isothermal titration calorimetry, the dissociation constant for nickel was found to be ∼10 μm and that for cobalt was approximately 20 times higher. Nickel is a transition metal with appreciable affinity for oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. Its biological role in animals remains obscure, although it has been implicated in both metabolism and reproduction of mammals and birds (1.Anke M. Groppel B. Kronemann H. Grun M. IARC Sci. Publ. 1984; 53: 339-365Google Scholar, 2.Uthus E.O. Poellot R.A. Biol. Trace Elem. Res. 1996; 52: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The biology of nickel is much better understood in bacteria. Its properties allow it to bind both DNA and proteins and disrupt many cellular functions when present in excess (3.Babich H. Stotzky G. Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 1983; 29: 195-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Several bacterial nickel efflux systems have been described that confer resistance to high levels of the metal (4.Grass G. Fan B. Rosen B.P. Lemke K. Schlegel H.-G. Rensing C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2803-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 5.Schmidt T. Schlegel H.-G. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7045-7054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the same time, nickel is known to be an essential cofactor in several bacterial enzymes (6.Hausinger R.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 22-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is essential for anaerobic metabolism (7.Maroney M.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 188-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), so the cell must be able both to import and export nickel to maintain an appropriate non-toxic concentration in the cytoplasm. Seven enzymes are known that depend on nickel (8.Watt R.K. Ludden P.W. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 604-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and some at least require metallochaperones for nickel incorporation. For example, the virulence of several pathogens including Helicobacter pylori is dependent on the nickel-containing enzyme urease (EC 3.5.1.5). A number of accessory proteins are required for the production of active urease including the nickel metallochaperone UreE (9.Remaut H. Safarov N. Ciurli S. van Beeumen J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49365-49370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 10.Song H.K. Mulrooney S.B. Huber R. Hausinger R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49359-49364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Nickel incorporation in Escherichia coli hydrogenases also requires a GTP-binding accessory protein, HypB (11.Maier T. Jacobi A. Sauter M. Bock A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 630-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein sequences of a number of microbial nickel uptake systems have been described (12.Eitinger T. Wolfram L. Degen O. Anthon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17139-17144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 13.Wolfram L. Friedrich B. Eitinger T. J.

Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1438-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but to date no structural information has been obtained. Nickel uptake by bacteria is of interest for bioremediation and water purification as well as its biological function and involvement in pathogenesis. The nickel transporter of E. coli encoded by the nik operon was originally discovered by the loss of hydrogenase activity in mutants generated using the MudI transposon (15.Wu L.F. Mandrand-Berthelot M.A. Biochemie. 1986; 68: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 16.Wu L.F. Mandrand-Berthelot M.A. Waugh R. Edmonds C.J. Holt S.E. Boxer D.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 1709-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The addition of 0.5 mm nickel led to the full recovery of hydrogenase activity, suggesting that the mutants were defective in nickel transport. This was later demonstrated directly in nickel transport experiments using 63Ni2+ (17.Navarro C. Wu L.F. Mandrand-Berthelot M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 1181-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Sequencing the nik locus showed five open reading frames, nikA-E-encoding proteins with significant similarity to the ABC-type dipeptide and oligopeptide import systems (18.Wu L.F. Navarro C. Mandrand-Berthelot M.A. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 107: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). ABC transporters in Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli consist of three components: integral membrane proteins that create a pore through the inner membrane, membrane-associated ATP-hydrolyzing proteins, and a periplasmic binding protein (PBP). 1The abbreviations used are: PBPperiplasmic binding proteinDTTdithiothreitolPDBProtein Data Bank. These transporters allow the cell to import selectively the available nutrients and signaling peptides. An analysis of the E. coli genome suggests that it encodes 44 import systems and 13 export systems in the ABC family (19.Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of more than a dozen different periplasmic binding proteins have been determined and show a number of common features (20.Quiocho F.A. Ledvina P.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). These proteins serve as the initial receptor for their respective ligands, which diffuse freely through the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. In Gram-positive bacteria, these proteins are tethered to the cell by lipophilic tails (21.Sutcliffe I.C. Russell R.R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1123-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Periplasmic binding proteins vary in size from 25 to 59 kDa, the largest being the oligopeptide-binding protein OppA, which shows considerable sequence similarity to NikA. NikA is expressed as a pre-protein 524 amino acid residues long. The N-terminal 22 residue leader sequence directs translocation to the periplasm where it is removed to leave a 502 residue mature protein with a molecular mass of 56.3 kDa (17.Navarro C. Wu L.F. Mandrand-Berthelot M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 1181-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). periplasmic binding protein dithiothreitol Protein Data Bank. Overall, solute-binding proteins show little sequence similarity but do show a number of conserved features. The two relatively rigid halves are connected by a hinge, which closes on substrate binding, completely enclosing the substrate in a manner often compared with a Venus fly-trap. The large conformational change has been confirmed for several solute-binding proteins by x-ray scattering in solution (22.Shilton B.H. Flocco M.M. Nilsson M. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 350-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Until 1998, all of the known PBP structures could be classified into two groups depending on the topology of the connection between the two lobes (23.Fukami-Kobayashi K. Tateno Y. Nishikawa K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of two metal binding proteins in the solute-binding protein family, however, show a very different connection between the two domains, forming a new family of metal binding receptors (24.Claverys J.-P. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). TroA is a zinc-binding protein from Treponema pallidum (25.Lee Y.-H. Dorwart M.R. Hazlett K.R.O. Deka R.K. Norgard M.V. Radolf J.D. Hasemann C.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 628-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 26.Lee Y.-H. Dorwart M.R. Hazlett K.R.O. Deka R.K. Norgard M.V. Radolf J.D. Hasemann C.A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2300-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and PsaA is a manganese/zinc-binding protein from Streptococcus pneumoniae (27.Lawrence M.C. Pilling P.A. Epa V.C. Berry A.M. Ogunniyi A.D. Paton J.C. Structure. 1998; 6: 1553-1561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In these proteins, the polypeptide chain passes from one domain to the other only once, this connection being a long helix running most of the length of the protein. Unlike the β strands, which connect the lobes of most solute-binding proteins, the helix is rigid and permits only a very small conformational change on ligand binding. It has been suggested that this is necessary for tight metal binding given the small ligand size (26.Lee Y.-H. Dorwart M.R. Hazlett K.R.O. Deka R.K. Norgard M.V. Radolf J.D. Hasemann C.A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2300-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of a molybdate-binding protein from Azotobacter vinelandii, however, shows a more usual topology with a flexible hinge (28.Lawson D.M. Williams C.E.M. Mitchenall L.A. Pau R.N. Structure. 1998; 6: 1529-1539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). OppA and DppA (the E. coli dipeptide-binding protein) are nearly twice the size of the smallest members of the PBP family, the extra residues forming a highly conserved domain, which is shared with NikA (29.Tame J.R.H. Murshudov G.N. Higgins C.F. Wilkinson A.J. Structure. 1995; 3: 1395-1406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 30.Nickitenko A.V. Trakhanov S. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16585-16595Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). OppA is the most unselective PBP, being able to bind short peptides with relatively little side-chain preference (31.Tame J.R.H. Sleigh S.H. Wilkinson A.J. Ladbury J.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 998-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 32.Davies T.G. Hubbard R.E. Tame J.R.H. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1432-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In contrast, most solute-binding proteins are highly selective and show dissociation constants of around 1–0.1 μm for their ligands. Two previously published reports (33.de Pina K. Navarro C. McWalter W. Boxer D.H. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Mandrand-Berthelot M.A. Wu L.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 857-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 34.Salins L.L. Goldsmith E.S. Ensor C.M. Daunert S. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2002; 372: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) suggest very different values for the Kd for Ni2+ of NikA. We have solved the crystal structure of the protein in both liganded and unliganded forms and determined the binding constants for Ni2+ and Co2+ using titration calorimetry. Cloning, Expression, and Purification—The region of the nikA gene encoding mature NikA protein was cloned by PCR from E. coli (JM109) chromosomal DNA and inserted into the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible expression vector pET28b (Novagen) using NcoI and XhoI restriction sites. The nucleotide sequence of the gene was confirmed by DNA sequencing. In a suitable E. coli host strain, the resulting plasmid expresses mature NikA (with no histidine tag) in a folded soluble form in very high yield, up to 60 mg/liter culture. Without the leader peptide, the protein is not directed to the periplasm but accumulates in the cytoplasm. NikA is reported to bind to nickel-chelating columns with high affinity (33.de Pina K. Navarro C. McWalter W. Boxer D.H. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Mandrand-Berthelot M.A. Wu L.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 857-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), but this method was not chosen for purification because of the difficulties often encountered in removing ligands from periplasmic binding proteins. Given the high yield, high solubility, and stability of the protein, purification of the nickel-free protein was achieved relatively easily. NikA was expressed in BL21(DE3) pLysS cells (Stratagene). Cell lysate in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mm DTT was centrifuged at 34,000 rpm, 4 °C for 30 min, and the supernatant removed. Ammonium sulfate was added to a final concentration of 1 m, and the protein was then applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, and 1 m ammonium sulfate. NikA was eluted with a descending ammonium sulfate gradient and was found to elute at ∼500 mm ammonium sulfate. Fractions containing NikA were dialyzed into 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mm DTT and applied to a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the same buffer. It was eluted with an ascending sodium chloride gradient and was found to elute at ∼100 mm NaCl. If further purification was necessary, NikA was passed down a Hiload 26/60 Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Pharmacia) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. NikA was stored at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5. NikA proved extremely soluble at pH >6.5 up to 190 mg/ml. This has allowed an almost complete assignment of the isotopically labeled 502 residue protein in NMR spectra using 1–2 mm samples. 2S. Rajesu, Y. Ito, J. Heddle, S. Unzai, S.-Y. Park, and J. R. H. Tame, manuscript in preparation. Selenomethionine-substituted protein was prepared using standard protocols (35.Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. LeMaster D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Crystallization—NikA was crystallized using the hanging drop method in both the presence and absence of nickel. Apo-NikA crystals were grown at 20 °C using 7.5 mg/ml NikA in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, and a 10-fold molar excess of nickel. The protein solution was mixed 1:1 with the mother liquor, 12.5% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.3 m ammonium sulfate, and 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0. Crystals grew as triangular prisms to a maximum length of 150 μm over 1–2 weeks. The selenium-substituted crystal was grown using 150 mg/ml protein in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5 (no nickel), and a mother liquor containing 7.5% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.3 m ammonium sulfate, and 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0. These crystals were isomorphous with the apoNikA crystals grown with native protein. Similar conditions were used for the nickel-bound crystals. 15 mg/ml NikA in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, containing a 10-fold molar excess of nickel was mixed with an equal volume of the crystallization solution, 20% polyethylene glycol 2000, 0.3 m ammonium sulfate, and 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, and the same concentration of nickel chloride. Thin plates appeared within 1 week but took several months to thicken sufficiently for data collection. Apo-NikA crystallized in space-group P32 (two molecules per asymmetric unit) as triangular prisms, which diffracted to 1.85 Å. Multiwavelength data were collected to 2.5 Å from a selenomethionine-containing crystal at beamline BL44B2 at SPring8 (Harima, Japan). The anomalous signal from the selenium atoms was used to derive phases using SOLVE and RESOLVE programs (36.Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) was used for general data manipulation. The nickel-bound structure was solved by molecular replacement using AMoRE (42.Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) with two separate halves of the nickel-free model cut at the hinge region. This provided clear solutions at both the rotation and translation steps in space group P21212. A complete molecule built from the two halves was then used as a search model in MOLREP (43.Vagin A.A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) to find both complete molecules in the asymmetric unit. Data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table I. Overall, the quality of the maps is excellent. An analysis of the structures was carried out with XTALVIEW (44.McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). Fitting regions of the refined structures to each other was carried out with the program FIT written by Dr. Guoguang Lu (Purdue University). The center of gravity and principal rotation axes of models were found using AMoRE (42.Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Open table in a new tab Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Experiments were carried out using a Beckman XL-I instrument using a AnTi 60 rotor. All of the experiments were carried out at 20 °C. Sedimentation velocity data were collected at 40,000 rpm and analyzed with SEDFIT (45.Schuck P. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1503-1512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) to yield plots of concentration versus sedimentation coefficient. Buffer density and protein partial molar volume were estimated using SEDNTERP (46.Laue T.M. Shah B. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Horton J.C. Rowe A.J. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, United Kingdom1992: 90-125Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium data were collected at 9, 12, and 16 krpm using six-channel centerpieces and three different concentrations of protein between A280 nm of 0.25 and 1.0. The buffer used was 0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 0.1 m sodium chloride. Nickel chloride (where present) was used at a final concentration of 16 mm. Absorption and interference data were analyzed separately using the manufacturer's software. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Experiments were performed using a CSC 4200 instrument (Calorimetry Sciences Corporation). NikA was purified using a final gel filtration step with EDTA- and DTT-containing buffer to remove all of the traces of heavy metal ions. The protein was then extensively dialyzed against 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and 100 mm sodium chloride. The NikA concentration used was typically 90 μm, and all of the experiments were carried out at 25 °C. 25 injections were made of 10 μl of the same buffer containing 1 mm nickel chloride, cobalt chloride, or calcium chloride. Blank runs with no protein present were used to measure the background dilution heats. Each experiment was repeated three times, and the results were analyzed with the manufacturer's software. Structure Determination—Crystallization of the protein was carried out using the hanging drop method in both the presence and absence of nickel. Nickel-free NikA crystallized in space group P32 as triangular prisms, which diffracted to 1.85 Å. Molecular replacement using the OppA model proved impossible, not surprisingly, given the variable extent to which the hinge may open. Phases were therefore derived by multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion using selenomethionine-substituted protein. A nearly complete model could be built automatically from the experimental phases after density modification. Excellent electron density was derived from the trigonal apoNikA crystals using the anomalous signal from 10 selenium atoms/monomer. Residues 1–3 at the N terminus and 500–502 at the C terminus are not visible in the final 1.85-Å electron density map. All of the residue numbers refer to the mature protein. In the presence of nickel, orthorhombic crystals were grown, which diffracted to 1.95 Å. Clear systematic absences were observed along the h00 and 0k0 axes, but the possibility of space group P212121 could not be ruled out completely from the inspection of the diffraction pattern alone. The open apoform of the protein showed clearly that the protein consists of two lobes, residues 4–245 and 471–499 forming lobe I and residues 246–470 forming a contiguous domain, lobe II. Molecular replacement using these separate lobes allowed the nickel-bound orthogonal crystal form to be solved very rapidly in space group P21212. On structure refinement, it became clear that a mutation had occurred at the surface residue Gln-361, which has been replaced by an arginine. Resequencing all of the clones from the original PCR showed that one of these clones has a single base mutation in this codon. Although the mutation is 30 Å from the nickel binding site, fresh wild-type protein was prepared for nickel binding studies. Isothermal titration calorimetry was carried out with both wild-type and mutant NikA. The crystal structures are of the mutant protein. Overall Shape—The closed nickel-bound form of NikA has a flattened tear shape highly similar to DppA and OppA. A DALI (47.Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar) search of PDB with apoNikA revealed high similarity to DppA (PDB code 1dpe; Z-score 34.3) and OppA (PDB code 1jev; Z-score 29.0) but much poorer scores for other structures. The overall structure of the protein is shown in Fig. 1. Of the 27 PDB structures found by DALI, only two others were PBPs, the lysine-arginine-ornithine-binding protein and molybdate-binding protein, with Z-scores of 3.2 and 2.2, respectively. Because there are two copies per symmetric unit for both crystal forms of NikA, there are four ways of matching a liganded and unliganded monomer. Least-squares fitting the 271 Cα atoms of lobe I in the apoform and bound form gave root mean square deviations between 0.56 and 0.99 Å. The largest shift is found for a small loop around Leu-172, which appears to be flexible. Subsequently, overlapping the 225 lobe II Cα atoms gave root mean square deviations between 0.60 and 0.75 Å. The rotation between lobes was between 12.2 and 17.5°, and the translation in each case was <0.3 Å. The conformational change is therefore very close to a pure rotation of one rigid lobe relative to another. A stereoview of the superimposed apostructure and nickel-bound structure is shown in Fig. 2. This rotation is quite modest compared with other PBPs but much larger than the 4° observed in the case of the zinc-binding protein TroA (25.Lee Y.-H. Dorwart M.R. Hazlett K.R.O. Deka R.K.

Hasemann C.A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2300-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The hinge motion in NikA is similar to those in OppA and DppA but smaller (30.Nickitenko A.V. Trakhanov S. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16585-16595Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 48.Sleigh S.H. Tame J.R.H. Dodson E.J. Wilkinson A.J.

https://openalex.org/W2057238269,"CD46 is a ubiquitous human cell surface receptor for the complement components C3b and C4b and for various pathogens, including the measles virus and human herpes virus 6. Ligand binding to CD46 affects (i) protection of autologous cells from complement attack by breakdown of complement components, (ii) intracellular signals that affect the regulation of immune cell function, (iii) antigen presentation, and (iv) down-regulation of cell surface CD46. Recent evidence indicates that CD46 signaling can link innate and acquired immune function. The molecular mechanisms for these processes and the importance of intracellular trafficking of the receptor have not yet been elucidated. We demonstrate here that, in nonlymphoid cells, CD46 is constitutively internalized via clathrin-coated pits, traffics to multivesicular bodies, and is recycled to the cell surface. However, cross-linking of CD46 at the cell surface, by either multivalent antibody or by measles virus, induces pseudopodia that engulf the ligand in a process similar to macropinocytosis, and leads to the degradation of cell surface CD46. Thus, we have elucidated two pathways for CD46 internalization, which are regulated by the valence of cross-linking of CD46 and which utilize either clathrin-coated pits or pseudopodial extension. This has important implications for CD46 signaling, antigen presentation, CD46 down-regulation, and engulfment of pathogens.

Indeed, some studies have concluded that CD46 is not internalized (30Maisner A. Zimmer G. Liszewski M.K. Lublin D.M. Atkinson J.P. Herrler G. J. Biol.

Wild T.F. Rabourdin-Combe C. Gerlier D. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 1073-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In support of the notion that CD46 internalization is of biological importance is an observation that the YXXL motif at the juxtamembrane region of the cytoplasm (a motif implicated in internalization of many other proteins) is important for CD46 down-regulation in response to measles infection (23Yant S. Hirano A. Wong T.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 766-770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the effects of CD46 on the presentation of measles antigen can be blocked by inhibitors of endocytosis (16Gerlier D. Trescol-Biemont M.C. Varior-Krishnan G. Naniche D. Fugier-Vivier I.

We show here the first characterization of CD46 internalization and define two different routes followed by CD46 after internalization. We discuss the implications of these observations to pathogen infection, antigen presentation, CD46 down-regulation, and signal transduction through CD46.

Human peripheral T cells were isolated by centrifugation with Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences) in LeucoSep tubes (BD Biosciences). Human dendritic cells were enriched from buffy coats by purification over Ficoll-Paque, adhered to plastic (2 h at 37 °C), and cultured in 800 units/ml human recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (Schering Plough Ltd., Australia) and 500 units/ml human recombinant IL-4 (PeproTech) in AIM-V (Invitrogen) for 6 days. CHO-K1 cells were transfected with either Superfect (Qiagen) or LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen), selected in Geneticin, and cloned by limiting dilution. COS7 cells were transfected with Superfect Plus (Qiagen, Germany) and analyzed after 48 h. All cell lines were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Monoclonal antibodies to CD46 were E4.3 (affinity-purified IgG2a (34Purcell D.F. McKenzie I.F. Lublin D.M. Johnson P.M. Atkinson J.P. Oglesby T.J. Deacon N.J.

The 1840 rabbit antibody to CD46 was raised against recombinant extracellular domain of CD46, and both protein A-purified and whole serum were used. Other antibodies were to CD71 (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), CD55 (1H4 (37Coyne K.E. Hall S.E. Thompson S. Arce M.A. Kinoshita T. Fujita T. Anstee D.J. Rosse W. Lublin D.M. J.

Christiansen D. Thorley B.R. McKenzie I.F. Loveland B.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). CD46-EGFP (both Cyt1 and Cyt2 isoforms) was generated by replacing the region encoding the Ser/Thr/Pro-rich region (from amino acid position 286 to 314; GI:180137) of CD46 with that encoding EGFP (Clontech). In all experiments, both Cyt1 and Cyt2 isoforms gave identical results, and representative experiments from one isoform are shown. Flow Cytometric Analysis of CD46 Internalization and Down-regulation—All incubations were performed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 5.6 mm glutamine. To label surface CD46, cells were incubated either with Alexa-488-E4.3 (10 μg/ml) or with E4.3 (3.9 μg/ml) for 30 min on ice, washed, and incubated with either FITC- or PE-conjugated F(ab′)2 antibody to mouse immunoglobulin (1:100 dilution), and washed again. To allow internalization, cells were incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C (or 4 °C as a control). Internalization was stopped by the addition of prechilled medium containing 0.1% sodium azide. To determine the amount of internalized CD46, surface label was removed from the cell surface by incubation with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 2.0 for 10 min on ice (“acid strip”), and cells were washed three times and resuspended in PBS containing 2% (w/v) glucose, 2% (v/v) formaldehyde and 0.02% sodium azide for analysis by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences). In some experiments, the F(ab′) fragment of E4.3 was used without a secondary antibody to ensure monovalent binding. In these instances, intracellular antibody was detected after internalization, acid stripping, fixation, permeabilization, and incubation with a fluoresceinated secondary antibody to mouse immunoglobulin. To detect the down-regulation of CD46, samples were incubated with 10 μg/ml freshly prepared cycloheximide for 1 h and then incubated with L-H cells at a ratio of 1:1 or antibody as shown. Surface antibody was removed by incubation in PBS at pH 2.0 for 10 min on ice, and cells were stained for surface CD46 by incubation with 1840 followed by PE-labeled antibodies to rabbit immunoglobulin as described above. Controls (treated and not treated with acid, lacking the primary or secondary CD46 antibody) indicated that the acid treatment had removed surface antibody and that the first antibody did not affect the binding of 1840. Confocal Microscopy—Cells were grown in four- or eight-chamber tissue culture slides (Nunc), labeled with E4.3 or 1840 in ice-cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and incubated at 4 or 37 °C for up to 4 h. Samples were fixed and permeabilized using the shift-base method (42Bacallao R. Semin. Nephrol. 1995; 15: 285-290PubMed Google Scholar), labeled with either FITC- or Alexa594-conjugated antibody to mouse or rabbit immunoglobulin, and mounted in AntiFade (Molecular Probes). Analysis of CD46 internalization after cross-linking at the cell surface was as described above, except that the fluoresceinated antibody to mouse immunoglobulin was used before internalization at 37 °C. To monitor CD46 internalization after L-H treatment, cells were labeled with the GB24 antibody to CD46 (which does not block hemagglutinin binding to CD46). After incubation with L-H cells, antibody localization was determined by either direct microscopy (if CD46-EGFP was used) or by fixation, permeabilization, and labeling with Alexa594-coupled antibody to mouse immunoglobulin. The Golgi was detected as previously described, by staining the Galα1,3Gal epitope after permeabilization with biotinylated IB4 followed by streptavidin Alexa594 (43Milland J. Russell S.M. Dodson H.C. McKenzie I.F. Sandrin M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10374-10378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence was analyzed using a Bio-Rad confocal scanning microscope (model MRC1000). The 488-nm line from a krypton/argon laser was used to excite the FITC-tagged secondary antibody, and emission was detected through the 522-nm filter. The 568-nm line from a krypton/argon laser was used to excite the Alexa594-tagged secondary antibody, and emission was detected through the 605-nm filter. Optical sections were recorded at 0.5–1.0-μm vertical steps, with each image averaged for four scans. All images were processed using the Comos program (Bio-Rad) and Cas 4.02 (confocal assistant software; Todd Clark Brelje). Images are representative of at least two clones of each construct transfected, and staining with subclass control antibodies indicated that the staining was specific. Transmission Electron Microscopy—The internalization of CD46 was examined with immunoelectron microscopy using three different cell lines: CHO-K1 stably transfected with CD46, COS7 cells transiently transfected with CD46, and HeLa cells expressing endogenous CD46, all of which gave similar results. Cells were labeled with antibodies against CD46 either prior to or after chemical fixation. Antibodies to CD46 used in these experiments were 1840 or E4.3 (2 μg/ml). As controls, cells were also labeled with antibody to CD55 (35 μg/ml), CD71 (IgG2a; 5 μg/ml), and CD7 (IgG2a; 1:1000 dilution) either before or after chemical fixation. For prefixation labeling experiments, cells were exposed to the antibody at 4 °C and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 or 60 min. Cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.05% glutaraldehyde in 0.08 m Sorensen's phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min at room temperature, rinsed in 0.08 m Sorensen's phosphate buffer with 5% sucrose, free aldehydes were quenched, and cells were permeabilized with 0.1% freshly prepared sodium borohydride in 0.08 m Sorensen's phosphate buffer. Cells were incubated in blocking buffer (5% bovine serum albumin, 5% normal goat serum in PBS) for 1 h. Cells not exposed to a primary antibody prior to fixation were incubated with the antibody dilutions mentioned above and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the (Fab′)2 fragments of goat IgG against mouse immunoglobulin conjugated to Ultrasmall Gold (Aurion) diluted 1:50 in incubation buffer (0.8% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% cold water fish skin gelatin in PBS, pH 7.2), and washed thoroughly in incubation buffer. Cells were subsequently washed in PBS followed by distilled H2O and then silver-enhanced (Aurion Silver Enhance Kit R-GENT LM) for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were washed in distilled H2O before secondary fixation in 2% phosphate-buffered osmium tetroxide, rinsed in distilled H2O, dehydrated through a graded series of alcohols, acetone-rinsed, and embedded in Spurr's resin. Ultrathin sections were cut on an Ultracut S (Leica, Austria) with a diamond knife (Diatome, Austria). Sections were double-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in a Hitachi H600 Transmission Electron Microscope. SDS-PAGE—HeLa cells were incubated in 1840 (2 μg/ml) or normal rabbit serum for 30 min or 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed at 5×107 cells/ml in 140 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA with Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel in nonreducing conditions, transferred and probed with E4.3 (3.9 μg/ml), stripped, and reprobed with antibody to tubulin (1:5,000). Measles Virus Binding and Internalization—Cells were harvested from nonconfluent monolayers, washed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, and then incubated with purified MV Hallč (at doses previously found to saturate CD46 binding (44Christiansen D. Loveland B. Kyriakou P. Lanteri M. Escoffier C. Gerlier D. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar)) for 30 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were then centrifuged at 1,300 rpm for 3 min, and the cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of fresh 2.5% gluteraldehyde (in 0.08 m Sorensen's phosphate buffer pH 7.4) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. After centrifuging at 1,300 rpm for 3 min, cells were resuspended in 1 ml of 0.08 m Sorensen's phosphate buffer with 5% sucrose, pH 7.4, prior to analysis by transmission electron microscopy.

Sequences encoded by the GAL4-BD fusion constructs were PYRYLQRRKKKGTYLTDETHREVKFTSL and PYRYLQRRKKKGKADGGAEYATYQTKSTTPAEQRG for Cyt1 and Cyt2, respectively. CD46 Internalizes without Cross-linking—To measure the internalization of CD46, cells were labeled with saturating amounts of FITC-labeled E4.3 antibody to CD46 at 4 °C. Following incubation at either 4 or 37 °C for 30 min, the internalized antibody was quantified by comparing fluorescence levels with or without acid removal of surface-bound antibody (“acid stripping”). Antibodies to CD46 were internalized from the surface of HeLa cells (Fig. 1A, i) but not from the T cell line MLA-144 (Fig. 1A, ii), as indicated by protection from acid stripping after incubation at 37 °C (solid line) compared with 4 °C (dotted line). Similar fluorescence was seen between non-acid-treated cells at 4 and 37 °C, indicating that antibody was not shed from the cell surface (Fig. 1A, iii and iv). CD46 was internalized from all nonlymphocyte cell types tested, but little or no internalization after 30 min was detected from the surface of human peripheral lymphocytes or lymphocyte cell lines (Table I). Internalization was evident by 15 min and peaked within 30–60 min, and both Cyt1 and Cyt2 isoforms of CD46 gave identical patterns of internalization (data not shown). The antibody internalization was specifically dependent upon CD46, since control antibodies, antibodies to CD46 incubated with untransfected CHO-K1 cells, and an antibody to the multidrug resistance protein Pgp bound to A7-CEM cells were not internalized at this time point (data not shown). These data indicate that noncross-linked CD46 internalizes from the surface of nonlymphocyte cells but not from the surface of lymphocytes.Table ICD46 internalizes on nonlymphoid human cell typesCell typeCell lineConstitutive CD46 internalization (pathway 1)Cervical adenocarcinomaHeLa-M+Colon adenocarcinomaLOVO+Colon adenocarcinomaCOLO-205+Prostate adenocarcinomaDU145+Prostate adenocarcinomaPC-340+MelanomaM2+Monocyte leukemiaTHP-1+Myeloid leukemiaU937+Promyeloid leukemiaHL-60+Myeloid leukemiaK562+AstrocytomaU251MG+Primary dendritic cells+Peripheral blood lymphocytes-B cell lymphomaDaudi-T cell leukaemiaJurkat-E61-T cell leukaemiaCCRF-CEM-T cell leukaemiaHPB-TALL- Open table in a new tab CD46 internalization was also observed with F(ab′) fragments of E4.3 and with monoclonal antibodies directed to different epitopes of CD46 (M177, 20.6; data not shown), suggesting that CD46 internalization might be a constitutive process. We reasoned that, if the internalization of CD46 was a steady-state process not affected by the E4.3 antibody, treatment with E4.3 should not cause a down-regulation of CD46 at the cell surface. We therefore investigated whether incubation with the E4.3 antibody altered the surface expression of CD46 on HeLa cells (Fig. 1B). As a positive control for CD46 down-regulation, cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with L929 cells expressing measles virus hemagglutinin (L-H cells). As previously described (26Krantic S. Gimenez C. Rabourdin-Combe C. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 2793-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), incubation with L-H caused an extensive reduction in surface CD46 on the HeLa cells (Fig. 1B, i, solid line) compared with incubation with untransfected L929 cells (Fig. 1B, i, dotted line). In contrast, the surface expression of CD46 on HeLa cells (Fig. 1B, ii, dotted line) was not reduced by E4.3 incubation at 37 °C for 30 min (Fig. 1B, ii, solid line), despite this antibody being internalized (data not shown). Extending the incubation time to 4 h still had no effect on surface CD46 expression (data not shown), and the maintenance of CD46 surface expression was not due to new protein synthesis, since the cells were incubated with cycloheximide. These data indicate that the loss of CD46 from the cell surface through internalization is compensated by a gain in CD46 from an intracellular storage compartment and are compatible with the notion that CD46 is constitutively cycled between the cell surface and an intracellular compartment. Internalized CD46 Colocalizes with the Golgi Apparatus— E4.3 antibody that had been internalized localized to a single region within the CHO cells transfected with CD46 (Fig. 1C, i). This staining was strikingly similar to the steady state localization of CD46 in these cells (Fig. 1C, ii), suggesting that internalized CD46 might traffic to the region of steady state CD46 localization. To test this hypothesis, we generated a CD46-EGFP fusion protein in which the Ser/Thr/Pro-rich extracellular stalk of CD46 was replaced with EGFP. CD46-EGFP had the same intracellular distribution and trafficking characteristics as wild type CD46, as determined by flow cytometric analysis (data not shown), steady state CD46-EGFP fluorescence (Fig. 1C, iii), and localization of internalized E4.3 antibody (Fig. 1C, iv). Importantly, the internalized antibody (Fig. 1C, iv, and red in Fig. 1C, v) colocalized with the CD46-EGFP fluorescence (Fig. 1C, iii, and green in Fig. 1C, v), indicating that internalized CD46 trafficked to the region of constitutive expression of CD46. These data indicate that intracellular CD46 is composed, at least in part, of CD46 that has been internalized from the cell surface. Colocalization studies were performed to further define the location of intracellular CD46. First, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and costained with antibodies to CD46 and propidium iodide, which showed that intracellular CD46 was not in the nucleus (data not shown). Second, to detect the Golgi, we used the IB4 lectin, which binds to the Galα1,3Gal moiety of glycoconjugates. This linkage is produced by the α1–3-galactosyltransferase, which resides in the Golgi (43Milland J. Russell S.M. Dodson H.C. McKenzie I.F. Sandrin M.S. J. Biol.

The biosynthesis of MSH involves a deacetylase that removes the acetyl group from the precursor GlcNAc-Ins to yield GlcN-Ins. The deacetylase (MshB) corresponds to Rv1170 of M. tuberculosis with a molecular mass of 33,400 Da. MshB is a Zn2+ metalloprotein, and the deacetylase activity is completely dependent on the presence of a divalent metal cation. We have determined the x-ray crystallographic structure of MshB, which reveals a protein that folds in a manner resembling lactate dehydrogenase in the N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain consisting of two β-sheets and two α-helices. The zinc binding site is in the N-terminal domain occupying a position equivalent to that of the NAD+ co-factor of lactate dehydrogenase. The Zn2+ is 5 coordinate with 3 residues from MshB (His-13, Asp-16, His-147) and two water molecules. One water would be displaced upon binding of substrate (GlcNAc-Ins); the other is proposed as the nucleophilic water assisted by the general base carboxylate of Asp-15. In addition to the Zn2+ providing electrophilic assistance in the hydrolysis, His-144 imidazole could form a hydrogen bond to the oxyanion of the tetrahedral intermediate. The extensive sequence identity of MshB, the deacetylase, with mycothiol S-conjugate amidase, an amide hydrolase that mediates detoxification of mycothiol S-conjugate xenobiotics, has allowed us to construct a faithful model of the catalytic domain of mycothiol S-conjugate amidase based on the structure of MshB.

To compound the urgency of this situation, 2% of TB clinical isolates display resistance to the common anti-TB medications, isoniazid and rifampicin (3Amaral L. Viveiros M. Kristiansen J.E. Trop.

Clearly, the lack of new anti-TB drugs is a significant problem since the frequency of antibiotic-resistant TB is growing. To develop new anti-TB drugs, we have sought novel metabolic pathways or metabolic intermediates used by the bacteria. One such potential target is mycothiol (1-d-myo-inosityl 2-(N-acetyl-l-cysteinyl)amido-2-deoxy-α-d-glucopyranoside, MSH or AcCys-GlcN-Ins) (Fig. 1), the reducing agent exclusively present in the order actinomycetes, to which TB belongs (4Newton G.L.

We have solved the x-ray crystal structure of mycothiol deacetylase (MshB, TB gene Rv1170), an enzyme involved in the biosynthetic pathway of mycothiol. Recently, it was shown that Mycobacterial knockouts lacking MshB activity were more susceptible to reactive oxygen species but also more resistant to isoniazid (14Buchmeier N.A. Newton G.L. Koledin T. Fahey R.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1723-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The extensive sequence similarity of MshB to mycothiol S-conjugate amidase (Mca, TB gene Rv1082) has allowed us to build a faithful comparative molecular model of the latter. Mca may assist in the removal of antibiotics from the infectious bacteria by cleaving the S-conjugate formed by the reaction of MSH and an anti-biotic, thereby assisting in the export of the latter from the cell (8Newton G.L.

The data were processed using MOSFLM (version 6.11) and scaled with SCALA (16Leslie, A. G. W.

Crystallography of MshB—The enzyme crystallized in the triclinic space group P1 with cell dimensions a = 56.8 Å, b = 74.0 Å, c = 85.6 Å, α = 102.1°, β = 108.2°, γ = 97.2°. There were four protein molecules in the unit cell (asymmetric unit), giving a solvent content of 50% (VM = 2.5 Å3/Da). The four molecules present were almost identical with a maximal pairwise Cα root mean square deviation of 0.30 Å over a minimum of 251 Cα atoms. All four molecules are missing two surface loops (minimally residues 100–103 and 164–167), which had untraceable electron density (see Fig. 2, a and b). Both of these regions are not located near the active site. Additionally, three of the four molecules are missing a surface loop minimally from residues 211–216. This loop is located proximal to the active site but is not expected to play a role in substrate binding or catalysis (see below). The one copy of MshB that contains this loop then represents the most complete model present for the protein. All four molecules are identical in the active site region and contain a catalytic zinc atom. Overall Structure of MshB—MshB consists of one large nine-stranded mixed β-sheet and one small three-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet (Fig. 2, a and b). The first five strands of the large β-sheet with the associated α-helices (α1 to α5) adopt a topology that closely resembles the Rossmann fold of lactate dehydrogenase (25White J.L. Hackert M.L. Buehner M. Adams M.J. Ford G.C. Lentz P.J. Smiley I.E. Steindel S.J. Rossmann M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 102: 759-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence confirm that MshB is a zinc-binding protein (see below). Despite the diverse functions of lactate dehydrogenase (an oxidoreductase) and MshB (a zinc hydrolase), these enzymes adopt a similar fold. The three-dimensional structure of MshB does not have a related fold among the Zn2+-dependent metalloenzymes (see below) (structural relationships were searched by the DALI server, but no significantly similar metalloproteins were found (26Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3542) Google Scholar)). The structure shows that there is a metal binding site comprised of residues from the C terminus of β-strand 1 and the loop linking strand 1 to the helix α1 (His-13 and Asp-16) as well as His-147 from the N terminus of helix α5. In addition, in the holoenzyme, there are two water molecules that coordinate to the Zn2+ ion, one of which is also within hydrogen-bonding distance to the carboxylate of Asp-15, a proposed catalytic residue (see Fig. 3). Electrostatic Surface Potential of the Enzyme—The substrate for MshB is 1-d-myo-inosityl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-d-glucopyranoside, a molecule that is highly hydrophilic (see Fig. 4). Not surprisingly, the active site and substrate binding pocket of MshB is also hydrophilic and electronegative, having three carboxylate groups (Asp-15, Asp-95, and Asp-146), three hydroxyl groups (Ser-20, Tyr-142, and Ser-260), one amide from the side chain of Gln-247, four main chain carbonyls (Gly-140, Tyr-142, Glu-213, and Ile-214), and two positively charged residues (Arg-68 and His-144) (Figs. 2c and 3a). Many carbohydrate-binding molecules have similar constellations of hydrophilic residues that form hydrogen-bonding interactions to the sugar hydroxyl groups (27Quiocho F.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 442-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The Active Site of MshB Is Similar to That of a Metalloprotease—The deacetylation reaction catalyzed by MshB is very similar to that catalyzed by a protease cleaving a peptide bond. It was therefore not completely surprising that the arrangement of residues in the active site of MshB was very similar to that of a metalloprotease. The crystal structures of several metalloproteases, including thermolysin and carboxypeptidase A, have been known for a long time(Protein Data Bank accession codes 4TLN and 5CPA). These enzymes generally employ a metal chelated by three protein ligands (usually two histidines and a glutamate) and a general base carboxylate that activates a water molecule to cleave the peptide bond. A nearly identical constellation of residues in the metalloprotease active site is found in MshB deacetylase (Fig. 3). The ligands on the zinc are two histidines (His-13 and -147) and an aspartate (Asp-16), which differs from the usual glutamate in the metalloproteases. The activating general base is Asp-15, a feature that is unique among Zn2+ hydrolases. 2D. S. Auld, personal communication. We also see two water molecules in the active site, both in the proximity of the zinc and one near Asp-15, which presumably is the nucleophilic water molecule. The other water molecule is most likely displaced by an incoming substrate. Unlike the water molecule arrangement viewed in carboxypeptidase A, the two water molecules here appear to be uniquely bound and are not two positions with partial occupancy (28Rees D.C. Lewis M. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 168: 367-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The fact that both water molecules are present can be further verified by a calculation of the valence bond summation in which both water molecules are required to approximate the expected +2 oxidation state of zinc (29Brown I.D. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1996; 29: 479-480Crossref Google Scholar). Zinc was chosen as the active site metal for three reasons: 1) metal analysis data indicating Zn2+, 3G. Newton and R. C. Fahey, unpublished data. 2) a positive Zn2+ x-ray fluorescence scan, and 3) because zinc commonly adopts a coordination geometry identical to that seen here (30Roe R.R. Pang Y.P. J. Mol. Model. 1999; 5: 134-140Crossref Google Scholar). The active site region of the enzyme is extremely electronegative (Fig. 2c). A lone exception to this is Arg-68, which flanks one side of the active site (Fig. 3a). This residue is conserved among related enzymes (phosphatidylinositol glycan, class L (PIG-L), Rv1082) and may be of importance in the binding of sugar substrates since all of these enzymes have this arginine in common with their substrates (see below). Proposed Catalytic Mechanism of MshB—Given the similar disposition of catalytic residues in the active sites of MshB and the zinc metalloproteinases, it is likely that the deacetylase also has a catalytic mechanism similar to that of the proteinases. The metalloproteinase mechanism involves nucleophilic attack of the hydroxyl ion generated with general base assistance of the carboxylate group of the glutatmate on the carbonyl carbon of the scissile peptide bond. In all known metalloproteinases, the general base is a glutamate. The glutamate also has the role of general acid in transferring the proton to the nitrogen of the leaving group of the original peptide bond. In our proposed catalytic mechanism (Fig. 4) of hydrolysis of GlcNAc-Ins, the substrate binds to MshB so that the carbonyl oxygen of the acetyl group replaces the second water molecule on the Zn2+ ion. This leaves the first water molecule in an ideal position for general base-assisted nucleophilic attack of the carbonyl carbon of the acetyl group. The general base is the carboxylate of Asp-15. The tetrahedral transition state would then have a negatively charged oxygen atom that is stabilized by the positively charged Zn2+ and by the imidazolium side chain of His-144. Proton transfer to the nitrogen of the leaving group (GlcN-Ins) would be via the general acid function of the carboxyl group of Asp-15. This reaction mechanism might be common to other deacetylases as well. In other mycobacteria, there is strong sequence similarity among the MshB homologs, especially in the region of the metal binding ligands and the catalytic residues. Phosphatidylinositol glycan, class L is an enzyme that catalyzes the deacetylation of N-acetyl-d-glucosaminylphosphatidylinositol in glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor biosynthesis. The enzymes from a variety of species have a section of sequence, AHPDDE, that carries the metal binding histidine and aspartate residues, as well as the catalytic general base aspartate (11Newton G.L. Av-Gay Y. Fahey R.C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6958-6963Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 31Chang T. Milne K.G. Guther M.L. Smith T.K. Ferguson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50176-50182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus far, it has not been possible to bind substrate analogs or inhibitors to MshB. The product of the deacetylase reaction, GlcN-Ins, does not strongly inhibit the enzyme, nor does it bind with high affinity. 3G. Newton and R. C. Fahey, unpublished data. Molecular modeling of MSH in the active site of MshB revealed two potential orientations of the GlcNAc-Ins portion of the molecule. Neither was sufficiently compelling for us to be convinced of their validity. However, there were many potential hydrogen-bonding interactions in the vicinity of the two most likely orientations. Removal of the inositol, leaving only GlcNAc as the substrate, reduces the catalytic activity of MshB by 300-fold (11Newton G.L. Av-Gay Y. Fahey R.C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6958-6963Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Clearly, there must be important interactions of the inositol with MshB. MshB exhibits weak amidase activity toward mycothiol S-conjugates, cleaving the bond linking the AcCys residue to GlcN-Ins. The related enzyme, Mca, exhibits high activity with mycothiol S-conjugates and very low deacetylase activity with GlcNAc-Ins. 4Steffek, M., Newton, G. L., Av-Gay, Y., and Fahey, R. C. (2003) Biochemistry42, 12067–12076. Thus, these two enzymes have slightly overlapping functions. Mca plays a key role in the detoxification of electrophiles, which form S-conjugates with mycothiol (11Newton G.L. Av-Gay Y. Fahey R.C. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6958-6963Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and there is reason to believe that certain antibiotics are detoxified by an MSH-dependent pathway involving Mca (9Rawat M. Newton G.L. Ko M. Martinez G.J. Fahey R.C. Av-Gay Y. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 3348-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). 4Steffek, M., Newton, G. L., Av-Gay, Y., and Fahey, R. C. (2003) Biochemistry42, 12067–12076. Thus, Mca may also be an important target for TB drugs, and its three-dimensional structure is therefore important. Modeling of Mca Encoded by Open Reading Frame Rv0182— MshB and Mca share 32% sequence identity overall and 43% over the first 200 residues. Based on this sequence identity, a homology model for the catalytic portion of Mca was constructed (Fig. 5) (33Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4374) Google Scholar). The model was successfully built up to residue 180, where the sequence identity became too sparse for a successful fit. The homology model showed amazing similarity between the two structures with all pertinent active site residues aligning perfectly, including the metal binding site and the catalytic aspartate. Mca has very low activity toward GlcNAc-Ins; therefore, substrate specificity must be vital. The only major difference in the active sites is the incorporation of Lys-19 in Mca, where Ser-20 was in MshB. This residue may therefore be important in disaccharide binding, in which the serine in MshB interacts with hydroxyls on the sugars, and the lysine in Mca may sterically hinder them. Since the same sugar moiety must bind to Mca, it may bind in a different orientation, or the unfavorable interactions with the sugar alone could be compensated for by additional interactions with the AcCys residue of MSH. These interactions would most likely involve residues that occupy the positions of Gln-247 and Ser-260 in MshB since this is where most of the sequence variation between MshB and Mca occurs, and it was not possible to model this region accurately. Recently, the structure of a similar protein (TT1542) from Thermus thermophillus was determined as part of a structural genomics initiative (34Handa N. Terada T. Kamewari Y. Hamana H. Tame J.R. Park S.Y. Kinoshita K. Ota M. Nakamura H. Kuramitsu S. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1621-1632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MshB and TT1542 share 33% identity or strong sequence similarity, although TT1542 is 80 residues shorter in length. The role of TT1542 is unknown, and the assumed active site of the enzyme does not contain a metal atom. The enzymes share a very similar fold and active site residues, and therefore, it is likely that TT1542 has a similar role as a zinc aminohydrolase, although the natural substrate remains unknown (Fig. 6). The control of reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen intermediates is extremely important to all organisms. Mycothiol appears to play a major role in protecting mycobacteria against peroxide toxicity (7Newton G.L. Unson M.D. Anderberg S.J. Aguilera J.A. Oh N.N. delCardayre S.B. Av-Gay Y. Fahey R.C.

J. 2003; 374: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It therefore appeared that drugs directed against MshB might be able to block MSH production, but recent work has shown that in M. tuberculosis Erdman (14Buchmeier N.A. Newton G.L. Koledin T. Fahey R.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1723-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and in Mycobacterium smegmatis (9Rawat M. Newton G.L. Ko M. Martinez G.J. Fahey R.C. Av-Gay Y. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 3348-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), inactivation of the mshB gene does not fully block MSH biosynthesis. Another amidase, possibly Mca, apparently has sufficient GlcNAc-Ins deacetylase activity to support a low level of MSH production during exponential growth. If a drug could be found that blocks both deacetylase activities, then MSH production might be effectively eliminated. Alternatively a drug that blocks Mca activity might serve to enhance the toxicity of known antibiotics toward M. tuberculosis. The novel fold that MshB (and by homology Mca) contains should prove helpful in the design of such drugs, whereas the similarity of the active sites to known metalloproteinases presents a scaffold from which drug targets can be designed.

In this study, we characterized a novel family of five genes whose expression is induced during the diauxic shift. These genes, FET3, FTR1, TIS11, SIT1, and FIT2, are involved in the iron uptake pathway. We showed that their induction at the diauxic shift is positively controlled by the Snf1/Snf4 kinase pathway. The transcriptional factor Aft1p, which is known to control their induction in response to iron limitation, is also required for their induction during the diauxic shift. The increase of the extracellular iron concentration does not affect this induction, indicating that glucose exhaustion by itself would be the signal. The possibility that the Snf1/Snf4 pathway was also involved in the induction of the same set of genes in response to iron starvation was considered. We demonstrate here that this is not the case. Thus, the two signals, glucose exhaustion and iron starvation, use two independent pathways to activate the same set of genes through the Aft1p transcriptional factor.

Eukaryotic cells develop many processes to adapt to environmental changes. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is able to grow upon several carbon sources, among which glucose remains the favorite one. The use of glucose by fermentation leads to the production of ethanol in the medium. Then ethanol can be used after an adaptive process known as the diauxic shift, which is a transition from fermentative growth to respiratory growth. At this stage cells stop to divide, and the enzymatic equipment is modified to allow assimilation of carbon and production of energy from ethanol. This process involves a global change of gene expression. These changes have been monitored at the levels of proteome (1Boucherie H. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 385-392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Bataille N. Thoraval D. Boucherie H. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 774-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 3Bataille N. Regnacq M. Boucherie H. Yeast. 1991; 7: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and transcriptome (4DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar). As glucose is depleted, transcription of genes involved in gluconeogenesis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the glyoxylate cycle, and respiration is enhanced, whereas expression of genes involved in glycolysis and protein synthesis is decreased. The extent of these changes raises the question of which regulatory mechanisms lead to a coordinated expression of the genome in response to glucose depletion. The problem can be addressed by investigating the involvement of a particular transcription factor. Another possible method can be the alteration of transduction systems that transfer the signal of glucose starvation to the transcription factors. In both cases identification of up- and down-regulated genes can be achieved by using global approaches. In this way the role of the transcriptional activator Cat8p during the diauxic shift has been defined by the identification of its target genes (5Haurie V. Perrot M. Mini T. Jeno P. Sagliocco F. Boucherie H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 76-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It appears that although this factor is essential for growth on ethanol as the carbon source, only a limited part of the genes induced during the diauxic transition belongs to the Cat8p regulon. Cat8p is involved in the Snf1p-dependent pathway that is required in the response to glucose starvation. The protein kinase Snf1p is the catalytic subunit of a complex containing a regulator subunit Snf4p and a third element that can be Gal83p, Sip1p, or Sip2p. This heterotrimeric complex is the homologue of the mammalian AMP-activated protein kinase (for review, see Ref. 6Hardie D.G. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 13-27PubMed Google Scholar). Like its mammalian homologue, Snf1p is activated in response to glucose limitation, a process that requires its own phosphorylation by an upstream kinase and its interaction with the regulatory subunit Snf4p (7McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36460-36466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The activated form of Snf1p phosphorylates target proteins including transcriptional activators, such as Cat8p and Sip4p, and the repressor Mig1p (8Carlson M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to characterize new functions of the Snf1p-dependent pathway in the transcriptional changes occurring at the diauxic shift. We compared the transcriptional profiles of wild type and snf4Δ strains at the time of glucose exhaustion by using a genome-wide scan. We showed that genes involved in iron uptake are subject to a positive control by the Snf1 pathway in response to glucose starvation. This induction requires the transcriptional activator Aft1p. The results presented here suggest a link between the regulation of iron uptake and utilization and the adaptation to the respiratory growth during the diauxic transition. Strains and Culture Conditions—The wild type strains S. cerevisiae FY5 (MATα, mal) and FY2 (MATα, mal, ura3–52) derived from S288C were kindly provided by F. Winston (Harvard Medical School). The SNF4, CAT8, SNF1, and AFT1 deletions were constructed in the wild type strains FY5 or FY2 by replacing the gene with the kanMX4 cassette (9Wach A. Yeast. 1996; 12: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). The different yeast strains obtained are named YP3 (MATα, mal, cat8Δ::KanMX4), YP4 (MATα, mal, snf4Δ::KanMX4), YP11 (MATα, mal, snf1Δ::KanMX4), YP14 (MATα, mal, ura3–52, snf4Δ::KanMX4), YP17 (MATα, mal, aft1Δ::KanMX4), and YP31 (MATα, mal, ura3–52, snf1Δ::KanMX4). The single chromosomal integration of KanMX4 at these loci was controlled by PCR or Southern blot analyses. The strains expressing Aft1-HA 1The abbreviation used is: HA, hemagglutinin. were created by the transformation of pRS416-AFT1-HA, generously supplied by Y. Yamaguchi-Iwai (10Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Ueta R. Fukunaka A. Sasaki R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18914-18918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), to FY2, YP14, and YP31. Cultures were performed at 22 °C in a 500-ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 50 ml of supplemented minimal medium YNBS (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without ammonium sulfate and amino acids, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 2% glucose, 25 μg/ml inositol, 85 mm succinate/NaOH, pH 5.8) or complete medium YM1 (0.5% yeast extract, 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without ammonium sulfate and amino acids, 2% glucose, 1% Bacto-peptone, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 85 mm succinate/NaOH, pH 5.8). To test the response to iron limitation, cultures were performed in the same conditions as mentioned above but in rich media YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, 2% glucose) supplemented or not with the iron chelator ferrozine to a final concentration of 1 mm. Cultures were shaken at 360 rpm, and growth was monitored by measuring their absorbance at 600 nm (an A 600 of 1 corresponds to 2.4 × 107 cells/ml). Glucose Measurement—Glucose measurements were performed with a Sigma Diagnostic kit (catalog number 510-A). RNA Isolation—Total RNA was extracted as previously described (11Lindquist S. Nature. 1981; 293: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Mini-array Filter Hybridization—Mini-array analyses were performed using genomic filters (Research Genetics) as described (5Haurie V. Perrot M. Mini T. Jeno P. Sagliocco F. Boucherie H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 76-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Two independent experiments of comparison were performed with a single set of membranes. Between hybridizations, the efficiency of stripping (≥95%) was checked by scanning the filters. To allow comparison between separate filter hybridizations, the intensity of each spot was normalized to the total hybridization signal intensity. A gene was considered as potentially Snf4p-dependent when the spot displayed at least a 2-fold difference between the mutant and the wild type strains in the two experiments. Northern Blot Hybridization—15 μg of each RNA preparation was electrophoresed under denaturing conditions (12Lehrach H. Diamond D. Wozney J.M. Boedtker H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4743-4751Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar) and blotted onto nylon membranes (13Sambrook J. Fritschand E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Hybridization probes used were PCR-amplified with appropriate primers (sequences available upon request). Hybridization signals were detected using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager, and quantification was achieved with the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Preparation of Protein Extracts and Immunoblot Analysis—Proteins extraction was performed as previously described (14Pinson B. Kongsrud T.L. Ording E. Johansen L. Daignan-Fornier B. Gabrielsen O.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4665-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Samples of 2.4 × 108 cells were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed with water, and suspended in 500 μl of 5% trichloroacetic acid before the addition of 500 mg of glass beads. Cells were disrupted by vortexing for 15 min at room temperature, and supernatants were transferred to clean tubes, incubated for 15 min on ice, and centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 × g. Supernatants were discarded. Pellets were rinsed with ethanol 95%, neutralized, and dissolved in 50 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 125 μl of Laemmli buffer (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and then incubated for 3 min at 100 °C. Samples were cooled at room temperature and centrifuged before electrophoresis. Protein extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE using 6% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (ICN), and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-HA monoclonal antibodies (clone 12CA5, Berkeley Antibody Co., Richmond, CA). Primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Eurogentec) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence with ECL Plus™ reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For alkaline phosphatase treatment 2.4 × 108 cells were dissolved in 50 μl of 0.1 m Tris-HCL, pH 7.4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.05% Triton X-100. Cells were disrupted with glass beads and then centrifuged. 10 μl of supernatant were used for each experimental point in a 25-μl final volume. 2.5 μl of 10× calf intestine phosphatase buffer (Promega) were added with or without 200 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 2 (Sigma). Samples were incubated for 120 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 25 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer and then incubated for 3 min at 100 °C before SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Global Pattern of Gene Expression in snf4Δ Strain—A functional Snf1p·Snf4p complex is required for growth on alternative carbon sources. To identify genes under the control of the Snf1/Snf4 pathway during the diauxic shift, we chose to investigate gene expression of a snf4-deleted strain rather than a snf1-deleted strain. Indeed, under the culture conditions used in our laboratory, i.e. minimum medium containing 2% glucose as carbon source, it was observed that the growth rate and the rate of glucose consumption of the snf4Δ strain were similar to those of the wild type strain during the approach to glucose exhaustion (Fig. 1). In contrast, under the same culture conditions, the snf1Δ mutant strain displayed a strong alteration in growth parameters. The growth rate and the glucose consumption of snf1Δ progressively slowed down before glucose exhaustion, indicating that the physiology of this strain is already altered before the diauxic shift. In a rich medium this phenomenon was reduced but not abolished (not shown). Messenger RNAs were obtained from cells harvested 25 min after glucose depletion. Extracts obtained from wild type, and mutant cells were used to synthesize 33P-labeled cDNA hybridized to high density filters. Fifty open reading frames or genes were found under-expressed at least 2-fold in the mutant strain. As expected, Cat8p target genes were found among these genes. Among the other genes under-expressed in the mutant strain, we found five genes belonging to the iron regulon: FTR1, FET3, FIT2, SIT1, and TIS11. These five genes are known to be induced under conditions of iron limitation in an Aft1p-dependent manner (16Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 17Protchenko O. Ferea T. Rashford J. Tiedeman J. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Philpott C.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 7762-7768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Their defect of expression at the diauxic shift in absence of Snf4p suggested that they could be targets of the Snf1p-dependent pathway and that Aft1p could mediate this response. Genes Involved in the Iron Uptake Pathway Are Induced at the Diauxic Shift—Our transcriptome analysis was performed from extracts of cells harvested at a unique time of growth, 25 min after the glucose exhaustion. Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that differences between wild type and mutant were present well before the diauxic transition. To answer this question we compared the temporal profiles of mRNA levels in wild type and snf4Δ strains from 30 min before glucose exhaustion to 40 min after (Fig. 2). First, from this experiment we confirmed that Snf4p is really necessary to the optimal expression of the five genes tested, according to the data of the transcriptome study, and second, we showed that these genes are induced through the diauxic shift. This induction is concomitant with glucose exhaustion. Not all genes known as Aft1p target genes were found under-expressed at least 2-fold in the mutant. This result could be due to the sensitivity of our microarray experiment. We performed Northern experiments to analyze expression of FRE1, FIT1, and FIT3, three additional Aft1p targets (Fig. 3). Indeed, at the diauxic transition the expression of FIT3 appeared to be Snf4p-dependent. However, we were unable to detect mRNA products of the FRE1 and the FIT1 genes by Northern blot at this stage, whereas it is possible to detect them under iron limitation conditions. Even though we did not test the expression of each Aft1p target gene by Northern blot, it seems that not all members of the Aft1 regulon are induced at the diauxic shift. This Induction Is Due to Glucose Exhaustion—The snf4Δ strain is unable to use ethanol after glucose exhaustion even if we add more iron in the culture medium (data not shown). The defect of expression of genes belonging to the Aft1 regulon in this mutant could be a consequence of its inability to adapt to ethanol utilization. To address this question, expression of FTR1 was monitored in a cat8Δ strain. The CAT8 gene encodes a transcriptional activator essential for the growth on ethanol. In this strain expression of FTR1 is induced at the diauxic shift at the same level than in the wild type strain (data not shown). Thus, it is not the growth defect on ethanol that inhibits the induction of the Aft1 regulon in snf4Δ strain. The Aft1 regulon is induced under conditions of iron deprivation. The induction of Aft1p target genes observed at the diauxic shift could be due to an iron starvation concomitant with the glucose starvation. Thus, the expression of FTR1 and FET3 was assayed in an identical medium but supplemented with 350 μm of ferrous sulfate. At this concentration, the defect of growth of a aft1Δ strain on ethanol is suppressed (data not shown). Even when adding iron in the medium, the induction of FTR1 and FET3 was still detected when glucose became exhausted. Moreover, the level of induction was the same with or without iron addition (Fig. 4). In summary the induction of Aft1p target genes at the diauxic shift is independent to elevated extracellular iron concentrations and appears to be a response to the glucose limitation occurring at this stage of the culture. The Induction Requires a Snf1p Functional Protein—The established role of Snf4p is as a positive regulator of the kinase activity of Snf1p. To know if the Snf4p-dependent induction of the Aft1 regulon is also Snf1p-dependent, the mRNA patterns of FTR1 and FET3 in wild type and snf1Δ strains at the diauxic shift were compared (Fig. 5). A rich medium was used because, as we mentioned before, the growth of wild type and snf1Δ strains are almost similar in this medium. In the wild type cells, the induction of FTR1 and FET3 was observed, and the use of rich medium did not influence the kinetic of this induction. In contrast, in the snf1Δ strain the mRNA levels of these two genes were not enhanced at the time of glucose deprivation. We concluded from this experiment that the protein kinase Snf1p is essential in the Snf4p-dependent pathway, which leads to the induction of the Aft1p target genes at the diauxic transition. Thus, the defect observed initially in a SNF4-deleted strain is caused by a defect in kinase activity of Snf1p. The Induction Is Aft1-dependent—The five genes FTR1, FET3, FIT2, SIT1, and TIS11 belong to the Aft1 regulon. Aft1p activates transcription under low iron conditions, as its binding to a conserved promoter sequence and its subcellular localization are regulated in an iron-dependent manner (10Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Ueta R. Fukunaka A. Sasaki R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18914-18918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 16Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). To test the involvement of Aft1p during the diauxic shift, we evaluated the expression of FTR1 and FET3 in a aft1Δ strain when glucose is exhausted (Fig. 6). FET3 mRNA was not detected in the mutant strain, and the level of induction of FTR1 was strongly reduced compared with the level in the wild type strain. Thus the transcriptional activator Aft1p is required for the induction of these two genes at the diauxic shift, and it is involved in the Snf1/Snf4-dependent pathway. Phosphorylation of Aft1p Occurring at the Diauxic Shift Is Snf4p- and Snf1p-independent—Casas et al. showed that Aft1p was phosphorylated during the diauxic transition. We tried to reproduce this result in our strain and culture conditions. A wild type strain FY2 was transformed with a centromeric plasmid expressing an HA-tagged Aft1p protein. Cells lysates were prepared from samples harvested at different times before and during the diauxic shift. The mobility of Aft1p on SDS-PAGE was examined by Western blotting using an anti-HA antibody. Cells harvested before the glucose exhaustion exhibit mainly one form of Aft1p (Fig. 7). When glucose becomes exhausted, this form disappears, and cells exhibit at least one additional slower-migrating form of Aft1p. When extracts from cells harvested 2 h after glucose exhaustion were treated with alkaline phosphatase in absence of specific inhibitor, this additional form of Aft1p was not detected anymore (Fig. 7C). This result confirmed that the post-translational modification of Aft1p is a phosphorylation event. Knowing that Snf1p is responsible for the phosphorylation of several transcriptional factors such as Cat8p or Mig1, we can presume that Aft1p could be a direct target of this kinase. The same experiment performed with extracts from snf4Δ cells gave an identical result; the same post-translational modification pattern of Aft1p was observed in mutant and in wild type strains (Fig. 7, A and C). Thus, Snf4p is not necessary for the phosphorylation of the protein Aft1p, concomitant with glucose depletion. This observation suggests that Aft1p is not a substrate of the Snf1p kinase. To verify this hypothesis, we tested the phosphorylation of Aft1-HA in a snf1Δ strain (Fig. 7B). Because of the growth defect of this strain in a minimal medium, we performed this experiment from cells cultured in a rich medium (see above). Despite a difference in the kinetics of appearance of the phosphorylated form of Aft1-HA according to the glucose concentration between wild type and snf1Δ strains, which could be due to a slowing of glucose consumption in the mutant strain (see above), it appears that Aft1-HA is still phosphorylated when glucose becomes exhausted, even in absence of the kinase Snf1p. We can conclude from these results that, first, the phosphorylation of Aft1p happens at the entrance into the diauxic transition, in the same time as the induction of its target genes. Second, neither Snf4p nor Snf1p is required for the phosphorylation of Aft1p. Thus, Aft1p is not a target, even indirectly, of the kinase activity displayed by the complex Snf1p·Snf4p. The nature of the link between Snf1p kinase activity and activation by Aft1p remains to be clarified. And third, because it is observed in the snf1Δ and snf4Δ strains, the phosphorylation event of Aft1p is not sufficient to induce the Aft1 regulon. The Snf1 Pathway Is Not Involved in the Response to Iron Deprivation—The Aft1p transcriptional factor regulates the iron regulon in response to iron availability. We showed that genes belonging to this iron regulon were induced during the diauxic shift in a Snf1p/Snf4p-dependent manner. This response observed at the time of glucose exhaustion did not change according to the iron status (see above). We tested the reciprocity of this fact, i.e. the involvement of the Snf1 pathway in the regulation of gene expression in response to iron starvation when glucose is available in the medium. To achieve this goal, yeast strains were grown in YPD-rich medium containing glucose. During the exponential growth phase, iron was withdrawn by the addition of the iron chelator ferrozine in the culture medium at a final concentration of 1 mm. The induction of FET3 caused by the iron starvation was monitored by Northern blot in wild type strain, snf4Δ, and snf1Δ (Fig. 8). In the wild type strain as well as in the two mutant strains, the FET3 mRNA level is similar in cells harvested during exponential growth. It is enhanced 2 h after the addition of ferrozine in the medium in all the strains. Moreover, the level of induction measured is identical for the wild type and for the two mutants. The induction observed in the wild type after the addition of ferrozine is reversed by the concomitant supplementation with ferrous sulfate at a final concentration of 0.3 mm. This observation shows that the enhancement of FET3 expression is not caused by the ferrozine itself but by the iron removal. In conclusion, a functional Snf1p·Snf4p complex is not required for the induction of FET3 in response to iron deprivation. Iron is an essential nutrient for every organism. It is a cofactor in a variety of cellular processes such as cell respiration. In the meantime the capacity of reduced iron to catalyze the formation of hydroxyl radicals makes it a potent toxin for the cell (21Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 2nd ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar). Thus, iron homeostasis needs to be highly regulated. One key factor of this regulation is the transcriptional regulator Aft1p. Under conditions of iron deprivation, Aft1p induces the expression of several genes including those involved in the high affinity uptake system, FTR1 and FET3 (16Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 22Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). We showed here that several Aft1p target genes, FET3, FTR1, TIS11, SIT1, and FIT2, are induced during the diauxic shift. This induction happens when glucose in the media is exhausted, i.e. at the entrance into the diauxic transition. This induction is positively controlled by a Snf1/Snf4-dependent pathway, and Aft1p is absolutely required. It appears that Snf1p/Snf4p, activated at the diauxic shift, would positively regulate Aft1p function. These results raise the question of the nature of the functional link between the Snf1p kinase and the Aft1p transcriptional factor. In accordance with the previous report (20Casas C. Aldea M. Espinet C. Gallego C. Gil R. Herrero E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 621-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we showed that Aft1p is phosphorylated during the course of the diauxic shift. We showed that this phosphorylation happens at the time of glucose exhaustion and, therefore, is concomitant with the induction of Aft1p-dependent genes. This result indicated that this post-translational modification may be a mechanism for Aft1p activation. One possibility would be that the Snf1p kinase could be responsible of this phosphorylation. But we showed that neither Snf1p nor Snf4p is necessary for the phosphorylation of Aft1p. Because the induction of Aft1p targets requires a functional Snf1·Snf4 complex, this modification is not sufficient to induce genes activation. Recently, it was shown that Aft1p is localized in the cytoplasm and shows nuclear retention in conditions of iron deprivation. This nuclear localization is sufficient for the transcription of FTR1, a gene belonging to the Aft1p regulon (10Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Ueta R. Fukunaka A. Sasaki R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18914-18918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). It is not known if in response to glucose exhaustion Af1p is controlled in the same way; if that is the case, Snf1p could be involved at this level. Another hypothesis would be that Snf1p affects the expression of Aft1p-dependent genes by an indirect way, for example, by regulating an additional regulator/repressor of these genes. Indeed, the Snf1p-dependent pathway is already involved in the regulation of transcriptional factors at different levels; the localization of Mig1p is controlled in a Snf1p-dependent manner (23De Vit M.J. Waddle J.A. Johnston M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1603-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 24Ostling J. Ronne H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 25Treitel M.A. Kuchin S. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6273-6280Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), and Snf1p plays a dual role in the control of the transcriptional activator Cat8p at the level of transcription and at the level of activity (26Rahner A. Scholer A. Martens E. Gollwitzer B. Schuller H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2331-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This functional link between Snf1p·Snf4p complex and Aft1p can be integrated with a previous report (27Robertson L.S. Causton H.C. Young R.A. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5984-5988Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) that Aft1p target genes are under a negative control exerted by Tpk2p, one of the three protein kinase A enzymes of the yeast (cAMP-activated proteins kinase A). Glucose depletion is associated with a drop in the intracellular cAMP level leading to the inactivation of protein kinase A. This decrease of cAMP is required for the switch from growth on fermentable carbon source to growth on non-fermentable carbon source (the diauxic shift) (28Boy-Marcotte E. Tadi D. Perrot M. Boucherie H. Jacquet M. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Together these results also suggest a link between Tpk2p and the Snf1/Snf4-dependent pathway. Another question is why there is the induction of iron high affinity uptake genes at the entrance into the diauxic shift? The induction of these genes suggests that cells have to reply to an exceptional need of iron. In that case the signal does not seem to be a deprivation of extracellular iron. We showed that increasing the concentration of iron in the media such that a aft1Δ strain does not stop growing after glucose exhaustion has no influence on the induction. One possible explanation is that the signal comes from the intracellular iron. It has been reported that the major storage compartment of iron in the cell is the vacuole and could also be the transit compartment for iron (29Raguzzi F. Lesuisse E. Crichton R.R. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). When cells are shifted from glucose to ethanol media, the vacuolar iron is mobilized for mitochondriogenesis. FTH1 and FET5 encode the vacuolar iron oxidase and the vacuolar iron transporter, respectively, and may be responsible for mobilizing intravacuolar stores of iron (30Urbanowski J.L. Piper R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38061-38070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These two proteins are associated in a complex. The loss of this complex compromises the ability of the cell to switch from fermentative to respiratory metabolism. Also, it has been shown that the use of the membrane permeant Fe(II) chelator, 2,2′-bipyridyl, caused a strong and rapid induction within 5 min of FET3 and FTR1 transcripts under anaerobic conditions, indicating that a relatively small, labile intracellular pool of Fe(II) regulates the expression of these activities (31Hassett R.F. Romeo A.M. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7628-7636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Compiling these results, we can postulate that when cells enter the diauxic shift there will be an increasing need for iron, essentially toward the mitochondria, and the depletion of the cytosolic iron pool or the vacuolar iron mobilization will be a signal for the induction of genes coding for iron high affinity uptake proteins. Alternatively, the iron threshold for induction of the Aft1 regulon could be increased at the diauxic shift. Our results show that not all members of the Aft1 regulon are induced at the diauxic shift since we were unable to detect mRNA products of the FRE1 and the FIT1 genes at this stage by Northern blot. One hypothesis to explain this result was proposed above. The Snf1/Snf4 pathway would not control directly the Aft1p activity but could regulate an additional regulator/repressor, which would control a different set of genes. Last, we showed that the Snf1 pathway is not involved in the response to iron deprivation, resulting in the induction of the Aft1 regulon. Thus, two different signals, iron and glucose starvation, can give a similar result, which is the induction of the iron uptake system by the transcriptional activator Aft1p through distinct signaling pathways.

https://openalex.org/W2137462234,"S100A1 is a Ca2+-binding protein of the EF-hand type that belongs to the S100 protein family. It is specifically expressed in the myocardium at high levels and is considered to be an important regulator of cardiac contractility. Because the S100A1 protein is released into the extracellular space during ischemic myocardial injury, we examined the cardioprotective potential of the extracellular S100A1 protein on ventricular cardiomyocytes in vitro. In this report we show that extracellularly added S100A1 protein is endocytosed into the endosomal compartment of neonatal ventricular cardiomyocytes via a Ca2+-dependent clathrin-mediated process. S100A1 uptake protects neonatal ventricular cardiomyocytes from 2-deoxyglucose and oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in vitro. S100A1-mediated anti-apoptotic effects involve specific activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pro-survival pathway, including activation of phospholipase C, protein kinase C, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1, and ERK1/2. In contrast, neither transsarcolemmal Ca2+ influx via the L-type channel nor protein kinase A activity seems to take part in the S100A1-mediated signaling pathway. In conclusion, this study provides evidence for the S100A1 protein serving as a novel cardioprotective factor in vitro.

These findings warrant speculation that injury-dependent release of the S100A1 protein from cardiomyocytes may serve as an intrinsic mechanism to promote survival of the myocardium in vivo. S100A1, a low molecular weight (Mr 10,000) Ca2+-binding protein belongs to a multigenic family (21 members) of nonubiquitous Ca2+-modulated proteins to form an important sub-class of EF-hand proteins. Importantly, S100 proteins exhibit cell- and tissue-specific expression and have been linked to Ca2+-dependent regulation of a variety of S100 isoform-specific intracellular activities such as protein phosphorylation, enzyme activity, cell proliferation and differentiation, dynamics of cytoskeletal constituents, structural organization of membranes, intracellular Ca2+-homeostasis, and inflammation (for reviews, see Refs. 1Zimmer D.B.

S100A1 is the most abundant S100 protein isoform in striated muscle and has been identified as a novel positive inotropic intracellular regulator of cardiac as well as skeletal muscle Ca2+-homeostasis and contractility (4Most P.

However, growing evidence indicates that members of the S100 protein family also exert extracellular effects on their target cells (3Donato R. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2003; 60: 540-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Although S100 proteins apparently lack the signaling sequences required for secretion, some S100 isoforms seem to follow secretory pathways that involve neither the classical endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi nor the alternative interleukin-1-like route (9Rammes A. Roth J. Goebeler M. Klempt M. Hartmann M. Sorg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9496-9502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). For instance, S100A8 and S100A9, expressed at high concentrations by myelomonocytic cells, are secreted by a novel tubulin-dependent pathway and then exert important roles in the regulation of inflammatory processes (9Rammes A.

Similarly, extracellular functions for S100B, which is secreted by astrocytes, have been described extensively (10Davey G.E. Murmann P. Heizmann C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30819-30826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).

It has been shown that the S100A1 protein is released into the extracellular space in considerable amounts during ischemic myocardial injury via an unknown mechanism (15Kiewitz R. Acklin C. Minder E. Huber P.R. Schafer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 865-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we raised the hypothesis that the extracellular S100A1 protein may exert protective effects on myocardial cells. To address this question, the current study focuses on the characterization of the extracellular effects of S100A1 protein on cardiac myocytes and related molecular mechanisms in vitro. Indeed, our study identifies the S100A1 protein as a novel cardioprotective factor, because we could demonstrate for the first time that the extracellular S100A1 protein can protect cardiomyocytes from apoptosis based on Ca2+-dependent clathrin-mediated endocytotic uptake resulting in a specific activation of the pro-survival ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Reagents—Monodansylcadaverine (M-4008), chlorpromazine (C-8138), and verapamil (V-4629) were purchased from Sigma, whereas myristoylated (Myr) protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor (Myr-PKI; catalog number 476485), calphostin-c (catalog number 208725), U-73122 (catalog number 662035), and PD98095 (catalog number 513000) were obtained from Calbiochem. Myr-FRCRCF was custom-made by Eurogentec (Belgium) as described previously (16Convery M.K. Levi A.J. Khananshvili D. Hancox J.C. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J.

Expression and Purification of Human Recombinant S100A1 Protein—Expression and purification of the human recombinant S100A1 protein in Escherichia coli were performed as described previously (6Most P. Remppis A. Weber C. Bernotat J. Ehlermann P. Pleger S.T. Kirsch W. Weber M. Uttenweiler D. Smith G.L. Katus H.A. Fink R.H. J. Biol.

Coupling of S100A1 with tetramethyl-rhodamine (Rh-S100A1) was carried out by Eurogentec. Cell Culture—Isolation of neonatal ventricular cardiomyocytes (NVCMs) was performed as described previously (18Pinson A. Piper, H.M. Cell Culture Techniques in Heart and Vessel. Springer-Verlag, Berlin-Heidelberg-New York1990: 20-35Google Scholar). NVCMs were cultured for 3 days either on plastic culture dishes, glass coverslips, or Cell-Locate™ slides (Eppendorf) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biochrom) supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml), l-glutamine (2 mm), and 0.5% fetal calf serum (FCS Gold; PAA Laboratories GmbH) (standard medium) at 37 °C in a 95% air/5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. To induce apoptosis, 2-day old cultures were either incubated in glucose-free standard medium or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2-deoxyglucose (3 mm) or H2O2 (100 μm), respectively, for an additional 18 h. NVCMs were treated with 1 μm human recombinant S100A1 where indicated. Indirect Immunofluorescence and Phase Contrast Images—3-day-old NVCMs grown on glass coverslips were incubated with Rh-S100A1 (1 μm) as indicated, washed three times with PBS (pH 7.4), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. Following three PBS washes, coverslips were incubated in 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min to block nonspecific sites. Subsequently, cells were labeled with either anti-α-actinin (Sigma; 1/3000), anti-transferrin (Sigma; 1/500), or anti-caveolin-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1/500) antibodies. Following incubation of the primary antibody for 1 h in the dark, coverslips were washed four times with PBS, and then the corresponding ALEXA Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes; 1/800) was added for 1 h. After several washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted in Mowiol. Confocal images were obtained using a 100× oil objective on a Leica TCS SP laser-scanning confocal microscope. Digitized confocal images were processed by Leica software and Adobe Photoshop. For phase contrast images, an inverse microscope (Olympus IX 70) equipped with a SensiCam CCD camera (PCO Imaging) was used. Images were subsequently processed with TILLvisION4.01 software (Tillphotonics). Trypan Blue Exclusion, Cytochrome c Release, Caspase-3 Activity, and MTT Assay—The fraction of dead cells was determined by counting trypan blue-stained cells on Cell-Locate™ slides. Viable NVCMs were tested for electrical excitability by field stimulation. On each Cell-Locate™ slide, a total number of at least 150 cells were inspected. Cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activity were assessed by Quantikine® M Mouse cytochrome c immunoassay (R&D Systems, catalog number MCTC0) and Caspase-3 Colorimetric Assay (R&D Systems, catalog number BF3100), respectively, as outlined by the manufacturer's protocol. An MTT assay based on the reduction of tetrazolium salt (MTT) was purchased from Trevigen (4890-25-K) and carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol. Western Blot and Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) Activity—Western blots using specific antibodies were performed to assess protein levels of phosphorylated/nonphosphorylated MAP kinases p44/42 (ERK1/2; Cell Signaling catalog number 9101/9102), p38 (Cell Signaling catalog number 9211/9212), p54/46 (SAPK/JNK; Cell Signaling catalog number 9251/9252), cardiac actin (Biogene; Ac1-20.4.2) and S100A1 protein (Eurogentec; SA 5632). Cell cultures were rinsed in PBS and scraped off the dish in lysis buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, SDS 2%, and 2 mm EGTA/EDTA) containing a mixture of 1% (v/v) phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma; phosphatase inhibitor mixture I/II) and protease inhibitor (1 tablet/5 ml) (Roche Applied Science; Mini Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor). To determine Rh-S100A1-uptake, NVCMs were first washed extensively with EGTA/EDTA buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, and 2 mm EGTA/EDTA) and then lysed. Blots were developed with the Avidix chemiluminescence detection system (Tropix, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and quantified by densitometry. Statistical Analyses—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Unpaired Student's t test and a two-way repeated analysis of variance (ANOVA) analysis were performed to test for differences between groups. A value of p < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. Ca2+-dependent Clathrin-mediated Endocytosis of Extracellular S100A1 Protein in NVCMs—Before studying the effect of extracellularly added S100A1 protein on NVCMs, the purity of human recombinant S100A1 protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the specificity of S100A1 was confirmed by Western blots probed with an custom-made antibody that specifically recognizes human S100A1 (SA5632) (data not shown) as described recently (6Most P. Remppis A. Weber C. Bernotat J. Ehlermann P. Pleger S.T. Kirsch W. Weber M. Uttenweiler D. Smith G.L. Katus H.A. Fink R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26356-26364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Incubation of NVCMs with 1 μm rhodamine-conjugated recombinant S100A1 protein (Rh-S100A1) for 5, 30, and 120 min in the presence of 2 mm extracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]e) resulted in a vesicular accumulation of the protein in the cytosol as shown by laser-scanned confocal images (Fig. 1). Consistent with a cytosolic distribution of internalized S100A1 protein, images taken at the level of the nucleus revealed nuclear exclusion of Rh-S100A1. Simultaneous indirect immunofluorescence labeling of Rh-S100A1-treated NVCMs with an anti-α-actinin antibody revealed the regular striated Z-line pattern typical of cardiomyocytes. Despite a reported interaction of S100A1 protein with the Z-line component capZ (19Bianchi R. Garbuglia M. Verzini M. Giambanco I. Ivanenkov V.V. Dimlich R.V. Jamieson Jr., G.A. Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1313: 258-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), internalized Rh-S100A1 protein seemed not to localize to the Z-lines. This suggests that internalized and endogenous S100A1 proteins are present in distinct cellular compartments, probably serving dual functions in the cardiomyocyte. To further examine the specificity of S100A1 uptake, parallel NVCM cultures were incubated with corresponding concentrations of rhodamine alone. However, in these Rh-treated cells we did not detect any dye uptake (data not shown). In contrast to NVCMs cultured in Ca2+-containing standard medium, a vesicular accumulation of Rh-S100A1 protein was not observed in cells that were kept in Ca2+-free medium containing 2 mm EGTA (Fig. 2, B-G). This absence indicates that the uptake of exogenous S100A1 is dependent on Ca2+. Analysis of homogenates from control NVCMs and cells treated with S100A1 in the presence and absence of Ca2+ by anti-S100A1 Western blotting further confirmed the Ca2+-dependence of S100A1 internalization (Fig 2A). Moreover, if NVCM cultures were incubated for 20 min with anti-S100A1 antibody (SA 5632) prior to the addition of recombinant S100A1, uptake of the S100A1 protein was also inhibited (Fig. 2H). As expected for a specific inhibition, the antibody-mediated “clearing” was dose-dependent, and, thus, an unspecific cellular uptake of the protein driven by the rhodamine tag could be excluded. In contrast, despite previous reports that have identified RAGE as a potential S100 protein receptor, intracellular uptake of S100A1 could not be prevented by a 30-min preincubation with an anti-RAGE antibody (10 μg/ml) that recognizes the ligand-binding domain of the receptor (MAB5328; data not shown) (11Huttunen H.J.

The uptake of extracellularly added S100A1 is inhibited by SA 5632 in a dose-dependent manner. The band representing human S100A1 is no longer detected if SA 5632 is present in the culture medium at 2% (v/v).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To gain insight into the pathway of S100A1 internalization, Rh-S100A1-treated NVCMs were labeled with an anti-caveolin-3/Alexa Fluor 488-anti-mouse antibody (Fig. 3), which is a marker for the caveolin-mediated uptake (21Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. Nature. 2003; 422: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (3071) Google Scholar). Merging the corresponding rhodamine and Alexa Fluor 488 confocal images clearly showed that the caveolin-3 staining pattern is distinct from that of Rh-S100A1 vesicles (Fig. 3C). In contrast, immunolabeling of Rh-S100A1-treated NVCMs with an anti-transferrin antibody, which is a marker for the endosomal compartment, revealed that Rh-S100A1 vesicles colocalize with transferrin and are therefore part of the endosomal compartment (Fig. 3, D-F) (22Rizzo M.A. Shome K.

To substantiate that a clathrin-mediated uptake rather than a caveolin-dependent process is involved in S100A1 internalization, we examined the effects of two inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, monodansylcadaverine (MDC) and chlorpromazine (CPZ) (24Howe C.L. Valletta J.S. Rusnak A.S. Mobley W.C. Neuron. 2001; 32: 801-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 25Sorkin A. Von Zastrow M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 600-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), on the uptake of S100A1. As illustrated by Western blots of homogenates of cells incubated with S100A1 in the presence of inhibitors that were probed with an anti-human S100A1 antibody (Fig. 4A), MDC and CPZ resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of S100A1 internalization. Consistently, laser-scanned confocal images of NVCMs incubated with S100A1 in the presence of MDC revealed an absence of Rh-S100A1-uptake (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4Clathrin-mediated endocytosis of S100A1 in NVCMs.A, Western blots of homogenates of S100A1-treated NVCMs incubated in the presence of MDC (upper section) and CPZ (middle section), respectively. Internalized S100A1 is detected with an anti-human S100A1-specific antibody (SA 5632), whereas an anti-cardiac actin antibody was used to normalize amounts of protein loaded in individual lanes (bottom section). Inhibition of S100A1 uptake via the clathrin-mediated pathway by MDC and CPZ is dose-dependent. B, fluorescence image of Rh-S100A1-treated (1 μm) NVCMs incubated with standard medium containing 50 μm MDC.

Bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In conclusion, our data strongly suggest that the extracellular S100A1 protein is internalized and routed for the endosomal compartment of NVCMs via a Ca2+-dependent, clathrin-mediated endocytotic pathway. Because RAGE apparently does not mediate internalization of the extracellular S100A1 protein in NVCMs in our experimental setting, the S100A1 protein may be endocytosed by another, yet to be identified receptor. Activation of the ERK1/2 Signaling Pathway by Endocytosed S100A1—Because signaling proteins of the MAPK pathways in particular have been linked to the endosomal compartment (for review, see Ref. 25Sorkin A. Von Zastrow M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 600-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), we next investigated whether endocytotic uptake of the S100A1 protein might affect MAPK activity in NVCMs. For this purpose, Western blots of homogenates were probed with antibodies that specifically recognize either the unphosphorylated or the phosphorylated form of the respective protein. Fig. 5A shows that the addition of 1 μm S100A1 to NVCM in the presence of 2 mm [Ca2+]e resulted in a specific increase of p44/42 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation (3.8-fold; Fig. 5A, upper section) compared with control cells. Consistently, if S100A1-uptake is prevented by the presence of 2 mm EGTA (see Fig. 2A), S100A1-mediated activation of ERK1/2 was absent. In contrast, the extent of phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK (p54/46; Fig. 5A, middle section) and p38 (Fig. 5A, lower section) following Ca2+-dependent S100A1 uptake was comparable with that of control cells (Fig. 5A). Incubation of NVCMs with S100A1 protein (1 μm) in the range of 1 to 30 min showed a time dependence of ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 5B), whereas a 30-min application of increasing concentrations of extracellular S100A1 protein (0.01-10 μm; Fig. 5C) resulted in a dose-dependent enhancement of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Concomitantly, the concentration of endocytosed S100A1 protein increased (Fig. 5, B and C). Inhibition of S100A1 endocytosis by 50 μm monodansylcadaverine effectively abrogated the S100A1-mediated increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, S100A1-mediated activation of ERK 1/2 could be prevented by preincubation with PD98095 (2-10 μm) (Fig. 6B), a specific inhibitor of MEK1 (26Bueno O.F. De Windt L.J. Tymitz K.M. Witt S.A.

B, addition of increasing amounts of MEK1 inhibitor PD98095 (2, 4, and 10 μm) to S100A1-stimulated NVCMs. Western blots of homogenates show that S100A1-uptake is not affected by PD98095, whereas the levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (P-p44/42) are reduced in a dose-dependent manner. C, effects of PLC, PKC, and PKA inhibition on S100A1-mediated activation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation (P-p44/42). In the presence of PLC inhibitor U-73122, levels of phosphorylated p44/42 are significantly reduced. A similar effect is observed by inhibition of PKC with calphostin-c. In contrast, inhibition of PKA by the Myr-PKA inhibitor has no effect on the levels of phosphorylated p44/42. Probing the Western blot with an anti-S100A1 antibody shows that S100A1 endocytosis (internalized S100A1) is not influenced by the inhibitors of PLC, PKC, and PKA. D, effects of transsarcolemmal Ca2+ influx on ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Simultaneous inhibition of L-type Ca2+-channel (5 μm verapamil) and a sodium-calcium exchanger inhibitor (Myr-FRCRCF; 10 μm) leads to a reduction of phosphorylated p44/42 (P-p44/42) levels in untreated (control) cells and S100A1-treated cells by ∼40%. Both S100A1 uptake (internalized S100A1) and S100A1-mediated activation of ERK1/2 are not significantly perturbed.

As illustrated in Fig. 6C, it appears that the inhibition of PLC completely prevented the S100A1-induced enhancement of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Because receptor-mediated activation of PLC is known to subsequently enhance protein kinase C (PKC) activity, we next tested whether S100A1-mediated enhancement of ERK1/2 activity requires activation of PKC. Interestingly, in the presence of calphostin-c (0.5 μm), a potent inhibitor of PKC (13Novitskaya V. Grigorian M. Kriajevska M. Tarabykina S. Bronstein I. Berezin V. Bock E. Lukanidin E. J. Biol.

Because activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) has also been linked to ERK1/2 signaling, we likewise explored the effect of PKA inhibition on S100A1-dependent ERK1/2 activation by a cell-permeable specific PKA inhibitor (28Gomez E.

Because interferon-γ (IFNγ) is also found at inflammatory sites, we determined its effect on monocyte MMPs in the presence or absence of TNFα and GM-CSF.

Monocytes/macrophages are prominent at sites of inflammation associated with extensive connective tissue destruction. They are thought to contribute to the loss of connective tissue components at these sites through the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). 1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MMP-1, interstitial collagenase; MMP-9, 92-kDa gelatinase; STAT1, signal transducer and activator of transcription; IL, interleukin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; GM-CSF, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor; IFN, interferon; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; FMK, fluoromethyl ketone; RT, reverse transcriptase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; IRF, interferon regulatory factor; TNFR, tumor necrosis factor receptor.1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MMP-1, interstitial collagenase; MMP-9, 92-kDa gelatinase; STAT1, signal transducer and activator of transcription; IL, interleukin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; GM-CSF, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor; IFN, interferon; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; FMK, fluoromethyl ketone; RT, reverse transcriptase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; IRF, interferon regulatory factor; TNFR, tumor necrosis factor receptor. MMPs are comprised of a family of extracellular matrix degrading enzymes that include the interstitial collagenases, gelatinases, stromelysins, matrilysin, metalloelastase, and membrane-type MMPs (1Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3826) Google Scholar, 2Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Yu A.E. Semin.

MMP-1/interstitial collagenase and MMP-9/92-kDa gelatinase are major MMPs produced by monocytes. Fibrillar collagens, such as type I and II collagens, are degraded primarily by interstitial collagenases whereas MMP-9 is involved in degrading fibrillar collagens that have been denatured by the initial cleavage by MMP-1. Additionally, MMP-9 cleaves substrates, such as laminin and type IV collagen, that comprise the basement membrane. As monocytes migrate into an inflammatory site they are exposed to multiple cytokines that influence the MMPs produced by these cells. The Th2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-10, have been shown to suppress monocyte MMP production (4Corcoran M.L. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Brown P.D. Wahl L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 515-519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Lacraz S. Nicod L. Galve-de Rochemonteix B. Baumberger C. Dayer J.M. Welgus H.G. J. Clin.

Inhibition of monocyte MMPs by these Th2 cytokines is related in large part to their suppression of prostaglandin H synthase-2 or cyclooxygenase-2 resulting in the loss of prostaglandin E2 required for the induction of MMPs (4Corcoran M.L. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Brown P.D. Wahl L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 515-519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Mertz P.M. DeWitt D.L. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Wahl L.M. J. Biol.

Cell Immunol. 1996; 173: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A number of cytokines have also been shown to induce or enhance MMP production by monocytes. Depending on the specific cytokine or combination of cytokines, monocyte MMP production can be differentially regulated. For example, TNFα, IL-1β, or GM-CSF, when added individually to monocytes, enhance the expression of 92-kDa gelatinase (MMP-9) but not interstitial collagenase (MMP-1) (9Saren P. Welgus H.G. Kovanen P.T. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4159-4165PubMed Google Scholar, 10Zhang Y. McCluskey K. Fujii K. Wahl L.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3071-3076PubMed Google Scholar). However, the combination of TNFα with GM-CSF induces the production of MMP-1 by monocytes through a prostaglandin-dependent pathway and synergistically enhances MMP-9 through a prostaglandin-independent mechanism (10Zhang Y. McCluskey K. Fujii K. Wahl L.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3071-3076PubMed Google Scholar). Another cytokine produced by activated T cells and NK cells at inflammation sites is IFNγ and has classically been considered an activator of monocytes. However, IFNγ has been shown previously (9Saren P. Welgus H.G. Kovanen P.T. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4159-4165PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wahl L.M. Corcoran M.E. Mergenhagen S.E. Finbloom D.S. J.

Invest. 1990; 86: 1204-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) to inhibit the production of MMPs by monocytes/macrophages stimulated with Con A or LPS. Because it is most likely that IFNγ interacts in vivo with monocytes in the context of other cytokines, we hypothesized that its effect on monocyte MMPs may be different in the presence of other cytokines than with Con A or LPS. We therefore examined the effect of IFNγ on the production of monocyte MMPs in the presence or absence of TNFα and/or GM-CSF, as well as the mechanisms through which IFNγ might mediate its effects. Here we report that IFNγ in the presence of TNFα and/or GM-CSF differentially regulates the production of monocyte MMP-9 and MMP-1. Although IFNγ alone does not stimulate monocyte MMP production, it induces MMP-1 when combined with GM-CSF and enhances the production of MMP-1 induced by GM-CSF and TNFα. This occurs as a result of IFNγ-mediated increase in monocyte TNFα production when combined with GM-CSF and involves both p38 and ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). In contrast, IFNγ inhibits TNFα-induced MMP-9 production through a novel mechanism involving caspase 8 regulation of STAT1 through p38 MAPK that is independent of apoptosis. Purification of Human Monocytes—Human peripheral blood cells were obtained by leukapheresis of normal volunteers at the Department of Transfusion Medicine at the National Institutes of Health. These cells were diluted in endotoxin-free phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ and Mg2+ (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) and layered over 20 ml of endotoxin-free lymphocyte sedimentation medium (Organon Teknika Corp., Durham, NC) in 50-ml tubes (BD Biosciences). After density sedimentation at 400 × g for 30 min, the monocytes in the mononuclear cell layer were purified by counterflow centrifugal elutriation on a Beckman elutriation system as described previously (13Wahl L.M.

Monocytes were enriched to >90% as determined by morphology, nonspecific esterase staining, and flow cytometry. Moreover, the purification procedure did not activate the monocytes as shown by the fact that following overnight incubation at 37 °C in suspension less than 4% of these cells were IL-2 receptor-positive, a sensitive marker of monocyte activation (15Wahl S.M. McCartney-Francis N. Hunt D.A. Smith P.D. Wahl L.M. Katona I.M. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 1342-1347PubMed Google Scholar). Culture Conditions and Reagents—Purified monocytes were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine (Mediatech, Washington, D. C.) and 10 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD). IFNγ (1 × 107 units/mg), TNFα (1 × 107 units/mg), and GM-CSF (1 × 107 units/mg) were obtained from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Apoptotic monocytes were determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis following staining with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Trevigen Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). TNFα, TNFR-I, and TNFR-II blocking antibodies (R & D systems, Minneapolis, MN) and caspase inhibitors including Z-AEVD-FMK (caspases 6, 8, 9, 10), Z-DEVD-FMK (caspases 3, 6, 7, 8, 10), Z-YVAD-FMK (caspases 1, 4), Z-VEID-FMK (caspase 6), Z-IETD-FMK (caspase 8), Z-LEHD-FMK, (caspase 9), and Z-VAD-FMK (a general inhibitor of all caspases) (ENZYME Systems Products, Livermore, CA and Calbiochem) were added to some of the cultures. Unless stated otherwise, following purification the monocytes were adhered for 30 min prior to the addition of reagents. Each experiment was repeated a minimum of three times with different donors. Western Analysis of MMP-1 and MMP-9 —For detection of MMP-1 and MMP-9, the conditioned media from monocyte cultures (5 × 106/ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) were harvested 36 to 48 h after the addition of cytokines and centrifuged. Bovine serum albumin (50 μg/ml) was added to the culture supernatants prior to the precipitation of the proteins with cold ethanol (final concentration 60%) at –70 °C for at least 15 min. Pelleted proteins (12,000 × g for 20 min) were washed with 1 ml of ethanol and subsequently lyophilized by rotary evaporation. The lyophilized proteins were resuspended in SDS-Laemmli loading buffer (500 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8)/10% SDS/0.01% bromphenol blue/20% glycerol), reduced with 1% β-mercaptoethanol, heated for 4 min at 95 °C, loaded, and electrophoresed on a 8–16% Tris/glycine gradient polyacrylamide gel (Novex, San Diego, CA) in SDS running buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3)/192 mm glycine/10% SDS). After electrophoresis, the proteins in the supernatants from conditioned media were transferred onto 0.45 μm nitrocellulose in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3)/192 mm glycine/20% methanol and blocked with TBST (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)/150 mm NaCl/0.3% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk for at least 1 h. The blots were washed three times with TBST and then incubated for 1 h or overnight with primary antibody. For the detection of MMP-1 and MMP-9, the blots were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against MMP-1 (generously provided by Dr. Henning Birkedal-Hansen, NIH, Bethesda, MD) and the N-terminal region of the active form of MMP-9 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Western blots were analyzed either by the addition of protein A-horseradish peroxidase (1:3000 dilution in TBST containing 5% nonfat dry milk; Amersham Biosciences) and developed with the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences) or by the addition of Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) and the infrared fluorescence detected with the Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). The antibody against MMP-1 recognized the active and pro-collagenase forms. Detection of MMP-9 by Zymography—MMP-9 was also analyzed by zymography, a technique that involves the determination of the ability of culture supernatants to digest gelatin in polyacrylamide gels. Culture supernatants (20 μl) were added to loading buffer (5 μl) as described above for Western analysis except that the samples were not heated or reduced. Aliquotes of the samples (16 μl) in loading buffer were loaded on 10% polyacrylamide gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) containing 0.1% gelatin. Following electrophoresis the gels were incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.2 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2 and 2.5% Triton X-100 for 30–60 min and subsequently incubated for 2 to 4 h at room temperature in the same buffer without Triton X-100. The gels were then stained with Coomassie Blue (0.25% Coomassie Blue, 45.4% methanol, and 9.2% glacial acetic acid) and destained (75% ethanol and 25% glacial acetic acid). Western Blotting of Caspase 8, STAT1, Phospho-STAT1, and p38 and ERK1/2 MAPKs—For detection of caspase 8, STAT1, phospho-STAT1, and p38 and ERK1/2 MAPKs, cell lysates were prepared from cytokine and/or inhibitor-treated monocytes. Briefly, cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended with 1× ice-cold cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphoate, 1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, and 1 mm Na3VO4) plus proteinase inhibitor mixture-complete mini (Roche Applied Science). After sonicating seven times for 3 s each at 65 Hz on ice, the samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (cell lysate) was transferred to fresh tubes, the protein concentration was measured, and 100 μg of protein from each sample was analyzed by Western blot with antibodies against caspase 8 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), caspase 8 p18 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), STAT1 and phospho-STAT1 (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Charlottesville, VA), and p38/phospho-p38 and ERK1/2/phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) on 4–20% Tris/glycine gradient polyacrylamide gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) or 12% Tris/glycine polyacrylamide gels. Detection of TNFα and MMP-9 mRNA by Semi-quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was prepared from the culture cells using Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The level of TNFα and MMP-9 mRNA was then determined using a semiquantitative one-step RT-PCR with GAPDH or β-actin as an internal control. RT-PCR was carried out using Promega's Access RT-PCR kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI), and the PCR products were separated on a 1.4% agarose gel. Expression of TNFα and MMP-9 mRNA was normalized to that of GAPDH or β-actin mRNA, which was consistently expressed and not significantly affected by different cell culture conditions. The RT-PCR primers specific for human TNFα, MMP-9, GAPDH, or β-actin were designed based on their reported sequences, using the PRIME program from the GCG sequence analysis software package and commercially synthesized by Bioserve (Laurel, MD). The sequences of these oligonucleotides are as follows: 5′-TNF, 5′-TTATTACCCCCTCCTTCAGACAC-3′ and 3′-TNF, 5′-AAGTCTGGAAACATCTGGAGAGAG-3′ (347 bp); 5′-MMP9, 5′-CGCAGACATCGTCCAGT-3′ and 3′-MMP9, 5′-GGATTAGCCTTGGAAGATGA-3′ (406 bp); 5′-GAPDH, 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ and 3′-GAPDH, 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′ (452 bp); 5′-β-actin, 5′-GACCCAGATCATGTTTGAGACCTT-3′ and 3′-β-actin, 5′-CTAAGTCATAGTCCGCCCTAGAAGCAT-3′ (788 bp). Detection of Soluble TNFα by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Purified human monocytes were treated with or without 50 ng/ml GM-CSF and/or IFNγ for various times. The supernatants were analyzed for the production of TNFα by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Immunotech, Marseille, France). Differential Effect of IFNγ on the Regulation of MMP-1 and MMP-9 Stimulated by TNFα and GM-CSF—The association of IFNγ with other cytokines, such as TNFα and GM-CSF, in chronic inflammatory lesions suggests that it may act in concert with these cytokines to modulate monocyte MMPs. Therefore, we tested the effect of IFNγ on the production of monocyte MMPs in the presence or absence of TNFα and GM-CSF. IFNγ alone failed to influence the production of MMP-1 and MMP-9 by monocytes (Fig. 1). However, synthesis of monocyte MMP-1, as detected by Western analysis, was induced when IFNγ was combined with GM-CSF but not TNFα (Fig. 1). Moreover, the stimulation of monocyte MMP-1 by the combination of GM-CSF and TNFα was significantly enhanced by IFNγ (Fig. 1). In contrast, as shown previously (9Saren P. Welgus H.G. Kovanen P.T. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4159-4165PubMed Google Scholar), IFNγ suppressed the enhancement of MMP-9 by TNFα. Although the lowest concentration of IFNγ utilized in this experiment was 10 ng/ml, inhibition of TNFα-induced MMP-9 was also observed with 0.5 to 10 ng/ml of IFNγ (data not shown). However, the GM-CSF-mediated increase in MMP-9 was further enhanced by IFNγ, whereas the 1.8-fold increase, as determine by densitometry, in MMP-9 stimulated by the combination of TNFα and GM-CSF was slightly decreased by IFNγ. These results demonstrate that whereas IFNγ alone has no effect on monocyte MMP-1, it can significantly effect the induction or enhancement of MMP-1 when combined with other cytokines, whereas IFNγ can have stimulatory or inhibitory effects on MMP-9 depending on the specific cytokines present. Effect of Time of Addition of IFNγ on MMP-1 and MMP-9 Induction—In light of the ability of IFNγ to induce or enhance MMP-1 when added with GM-CSF or GM-CSF plus TNFα, respectively, IFNγ was added at various times with respect to the other cytokines to determine the time course of the IFNγ modulatory effects. As shown in Fig. 2A, when IFNγ was added at the indicated times with GM-CSF the optimal induction occurred if these two cytokines were added at the same time. When IFNγ was added 1 h prior to GM-CSF it was not as effective at inducing MMP-1, and when added 4.5 h after GM-CSF the effect of IFNγ was essentially lost. Similarly, when IFNγ was added 1 h before the combination of GM-CSF and TNFα it further enhanced MMP-1 production, but the optimal response, as with IFNγ and GM-CSF, occurred when all three cytokines were added at the same time. As with GM-CSF, the effect of IFNγ was lost when it was added 4.5 h after the combination of GM-CSF and TNFα. Examination of the time-dependent effects of IFNγ on GM-CSF-induced MMP-9 revealed a kinetic pattern similar to that observed with MMP-1 (Fig. 2B). In contrast, when added with GM-CSF and TNFα, IFNγ, in general, suppressed MMP-9 production. Because the suppressive effects of IFNγ on GM-CSF and TNFα-induced MMP-9 were not lost by 4.5 h, and may be related to its suppression of TNFα-stimulated MMP-9 as shown in Fig. 1, we examined the effect of IFNγ on TNFα-induced MMP-9 at later time points. As shown in Fig. 2C, IFNγ suppressed TNFα-induced MMP-9 when added as late as 4 to 8 h after TNFα. The failure of IFNγ to inhibit MMP-9 after 8 h was related to the induction of MMP-9 mRNA above control (media only) levels by TNFα between 8 to 12 h (data not shown). IFNγ and GM-CSF Stimulate Monocyte MMP-1 and MMP-9 through the Induction of TNFα—A potential mechanism by which IFNγ may stimulate MMP-1 in the presence of GM-CSF and enhance MMP-9 may be because of induction of another cytokine(s). We tested this possibility through the addition of neutralizing antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3A, neutralizing antibodies against TNFα blocked the induction of MMP-1 and the enhancement of MMP-9 by IFNγ and GM-CSF. Moreover, antibodies against TNFR-I and -II also significantly decreased MMP-1 and MMP-9 production indicating that TNFα utilized both receptors in the stimulation of monocyte MMPs. These findings suggested that IFNγ, when added with GM-CSF, stimulated TNFα production that, in turn, resulted in the induction of MMP-1 and enhancement of MMP-9. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, whereas GM-CSF or IFNγ caused a slight increase in TNFα mRNA and protein, when these cytokines were added in combination to monocytes there was an 11-fold increase in TNFα mRNA and protein. Stimulation of TNFα production was detected 7 h after the addition of GM-CSF and IFNγ with a substantial increase in TNFα occurring between 17 and 28 h (Fig. 5A). Addition of IFNγ at varying times relative to GM-CSF revealed that when IFNγ was added 4.5 h after GM-CSF its ability to induce TNFα was reduced by ∼67% (Fig. 5B). These findings demonstrate that the effect of IFNγ on monocyte MMP production when combined with GM-CSF is mediated through the stimulation of TNFα and explain why this effect is lost after 4.5 h.Fig. 4Addition of IFNγ with GM-CSF induces TNFα. In panel A is a semi-quantitative PCR of TNFα in monocytes following GM-CSF (50 ng/ml) and/or IFNγ treatment for 6 h.

Addition of the p38 inhibitor, SB203580, or the ERK1/2 inhibitor, PD98059, suppressed the level of TNFα detected in the media (Fig. 6A). PD98059 caused the greatest inhibition of TNFα. Examination of the activation of p38 and ERK1/2 revealed that GM-CSF increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation whereas IFNγ enhanced the activation of p38 (Fig. 6B). These results demonstrate that both p38 and ERK1/2 are required for TNFα production by IFNγ and GM-CSF. Caspase 8 Inhibitors Reverse IFNγ-mediated Inhibition of TNFα-induced MMP-9 —As shown in Fig. 1, unlike its ability to increase MMP-1 and MMP-9 in the presence of GM-CSF, IFNγ suppressed TNFα-induced MMP-9 production. Because recent studies have shown that IFNγ can activate caspase 8 in other cell types (16Rathbun R.K. Christianson T.A. Faulkner G.R. Jones G. Keeble W. O'Dwyer M. Bagby G.C. Blood. 2000; 96: 4204-4211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ruiz-Ruiz C. Munoz-Pinedo C. Lopez-Rivas A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5673-5680PubMed Google Scholar), we examined whether activation of caspases might be the mechanism through which IFNγ suppresses TNFα-mediated stimulation of monocyte MMP-9. Addition of an inhibitor of caspases 6, 8, 9, and 10 to TNFα- and IFNγ-treated monocytes resulted in a significant restoration of MMP-9 as shown by Western (Fig. 7A) and zymogram analysis (Fig. 7B). An inhibitor of caspases 3, 6, 7, 8, and 10 also restored MMP-9 production, although to a lesser degree, because this is primarily a caspase 3-inhibitor (Fig. 7A). In contrast, an inhibitor of caspases 1 (interleukin 1β-converting enzyme) and 4 failed to restore MMP-9 production (Fig. 7A). We further examined the individual inhibitors against caspase 6, 8, and 9, as well as a general caspase inhibitor. The inhibitor of caspase 8 activity, as well as a general inhibitor (all), but not caspase 9, reversed the inhibition by IFNγ- of TNFα-induced MMP-9 production (Fig. 7B). This was shown to be because of inhibition at the transcriptional level as demonstrated by restoration of MMP-9 mRNA by an inhibitor of caspase 8 (Fig. 7C). Stimulation and Activation of Caspase 8 by IFNγ—The caspase inhibitor studies indicated that IFNγ was mediating its inhibitory effect on TNFα-stimulated MMP-9 through a caspase pathway. To examine this possibility we next determined the effects of IFNγ on the activation of caspase 8, because it is an apical caspase involved in downstream effects on other caspases, and it was shown by our inhibitor studies to be involved in restoration of MMP-9. Western analysis revealed that IFNγ or TNFα increased the 55-kDa proenzyme form of caspase 8, as well as the first cleavage products, which are 45/43-kDa fragments (Fig. 8A). However, only in the presence of IFNγ were significant amounts of the p25-kDa fragment detected, which indicates an increase of the active p18 fragment of caspase 8 that was not detected with this antibody, as both p25- and p18-kDa fragments are derived from cleavage of the p43-kDa fragment. However, the p18 fragment was detected with a specific antibody against this fragment and was only induced in the presence of IFNγ (Fig. 8B). In contrast, stimulation with TNFα alone failed to result in substantial amounts of the p25 or p18 fragment of caspase 8. Caspase 8 Inhibition Suppresses IFNγ-induced STAT1 Phosphorylation—IFNγ mediates many of its effects on cellular function through the phosphorylation of STAT1. Moreover, recently IFNγ-induced phosphorylation of STAT1 has been shown to be involved in the inhibition of TNFα-stimulated MMP-9 in human Ewing's sarcoma EW-7 cells (18Sanceau J. Boyd D.D. Seiki M. Bauvois B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35766-35775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of an inhibitor of caspase 8 on IFNγ-stimulated phosphorylation of STAT1 in monocytes. As shown in Fig. 9, IFNγ treatment of monocytes in the presence or absence of TNFα induced the phosphorylation of STAT1. Addition of a caspase 8 inhibitor suppressed the IFNγ-mediated phosphorylation of STAT1. These findings indicate caspase 8 is involved in the regulation of the phosphorylation of STAT1. IFNγ-activated Caspase 8 Regulates Phosphorylation of STAT1 through p38 MAPK—To determine the mechanism through which IFNγ activation of caspase 8 regulates STAT1 phosphorylation we initially examined the potential role of p38 and ERK1/2 MAPKs in IFNγ-mediated phosphorylation of STAT1. As shown in Fig. 10A, IFNγ stimulated the phosphorylation of p38, as also shown in Fig. 6B; however, IFNγ did not increase the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Involvement of p38 in the phosphorylation of STAT1 was demonstrated through the use of SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, which suppressed the phosphorylation of STAT1 by IFNγ (Fig. 10B). In contrast, PD98059, an inhibitor of ERK1/2, had no affect on the phosphorylation of STAT1. Caspase 8 Regulates the Activation of p38 by IFNγ and TNFα—Because IFNγ induction of p38 activity was involved in the phosphorylation of STAT1 we next examined the effect of caspase 8 inhibition on the phosphorylation of p38 by IFNγ and the combination of TNFα and IFNγ. As shown in Fig. 11A, IFNγ-induced phosphorylation of p38 was suppressed by inhibition of caspase 8. In contrast, inhibitors of caspase 6 and 9 had little affect on the phosphorylation of p38 by IFNγ (Fig. 11A). Additionally, the phosphorylation of p38 by TNFα plus IFNγ was suppressed by an inhibitor of caspase 8 and a general caspase inhibitor (Fig. 11B). Monocyte Apoptosis Is Unaffected by IFNγ—Activation of caspase 8 is generally associated with apoptosis that could account for the suppression of MMP-9 stimulated by TNFα. However, analysis of annexin V, a marker of early apoptosis, demonstrated that IFNγ did not cause apoptosis of monocytes (Fig. 12). Although the level of apoptosis in control cells in this representative experiment was 17%, the levels of apoptotic cells in cultures treated with IFNγ and/or TNFα ranged from 6 to 13%. These results indicate that stimulation of monocytes with either IFNγ or TNFα does not increase apoptosis as compared with control cells. Moreover, the number of dead cells, as detected by propidium iodide, was not increased by either IFNγ or TNFα (data not shown). These findings demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of IFNγ on TNFα-stimulated MMP-9 is not because of apoptosis of the monocytes. The findings presented here demonstrate that although IFNγ alone does not affect the production of MMP-1 or MMP-9 by monocytes; however, in the presence of GM-CSF or TNFα it differentially regulations the production of these MMPs. IFNγ in combination with GM-CSF induces the production of MMP-1. This occurs as a result of the stimulation of TNFα synthesis by the combination of GM-CSF and IFNγ that, in turn, acts with GM-CSF to stimulate MMP-1 production. In contrast to MMP-1, IFNγ inhibits the stimulation of MMP-9 by TNFα through a caspase 8/p38/STAT1 pathway. The differential effects of IFNγ on monocyte MMP production suggested several mechanisms are potentially involved in the regulation of these enzymes. Previous studies (19Hayes M.P. Freeman S.L. Donnelly R.P. Cytokine. 1995; 7: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 20Quiding-Jarbrink M. Smith D.A. Bancroft G.J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 5661-5670Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) have shown that IFNγ can influence TNFα production by monocytes. IFNγ priming of monocytes enhances LPS- and bacillus Calmette-Guerin-induced production of TNFα (19Hayes M.P. Freeman S.L. Donnelly R.P. Cytokine. 1995; 7: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 20Quiding-Jarbrink M. Smith D.A. Bancroft G.J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 5661-5670Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Additionally, treatment of LPS-desensitized monocytes with IFNγ induces TNFα production (21Randow F. Docke W.D. Bundschuh D.S. Hartung T. Wendel A. Volk H.D. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2911-2918PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings demonstrate that combining IFNγ with GM-CSF results in a significant induction of TNFα mRNA and protein. The increase in TNFα in the presence of GM-CSF results in the induction of MMP-1 and also causes the enhancement of MMP-1 when IFNγ is added with TNFα and GM-CSF. This conclusion is supported by the ability of neutralizing antibodies against TNFα, TNFR-I, or TNFR-II to block the induction of MMP-1 by IFNγ and GM-CSF. Moreover, the stimulation of monocyte TNFα by the combination of IFNγ and GM-CSF was shown to involve both the p38 and ERK1/2 MAPKs. Unlike MMP-1 in which TNFα fails to induce this enzyme in monocytes, TNFα alone induces MMP-9. However, as shown here and previously (9Saren P. Welgus H.G. Kovanen P.T. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4159-4165PubMed Google Scholar), IFNγ suppresses the induction of MMP-9 by TNFα. In contrast, when IFNγ was added with GM-CSF it enhanced MMP-9 production through the induction of TNFα. This may result from the failure to totally inhibit the additive effect of GM-CSF with the endogenously produced TNFα that is significantly enhanced beginning at 7 h after the addition of IFNγ. Additionally, as opposed to experiments in which IFNγ inhibited MMP-9 when added at the same time as TNFα, the GM-CSF- and IFNγ-mediated increase of TNFα occurred several hours after the major suppressive effects of IFNγ on the induction of MMP-9. Thus, production of TNFα induced from 7 to 28 h after IFNγ stimulation resulted in further enhancement of GM-CSF-stimulated MMP-9 as measured at 48 h. To determine the mechanism by which IFNγ inhibited the induction of MMP-9 by TNFα our studies focused on caspases. Recent studies (16Rathbun R.K. Christianson T.A. Faulkner G.R. Jones G. Keeble W. O'Dwyer M. Bagby G.C. Blood. 2000; 96: 4204-4211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ruiz-Ruiz C. Munoz-Pinedo C. Lopez-Rivas A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5673-5680PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that IFNγ can increase caspase 8 activity in Fanconi anemia group C hematopoietic progenitor cells and breast tumor cells, which results in apoptosis of these cells. Caspase 8 is an apical caspase that activates caspase 3 and caspase 7 with caspase 3, in turn activating caspase 6 and caspase 2. These activated caspases cleave structural elements of the cytoplasm and nucleus and certain protein kinases that, in general, result in the disruption of survival pathways leading to apoptotic cell death (22Rokhlin O.W. Glover R.A. Cohen M.B. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5870-5875PubMed Google Scholar, 23Hirata H. Takahashi A. Kobayashi S. Yonehara S. Sawai H. Okazaki T. Yamamoto K. Sasada M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Our findings demonstrate that IFNγ also activates caspase 8 in monocytes. However, IFNγ activation of caspase 8 in monocytes does not lead to apoptosis. Of particular interest is the finding that inhibitors of caspase 8 reversed the inhibition of MMP-9 by IFNγ in TNFα-activated monocytes. The proposed mechanism by which IFNγ inhibits MMP-9 through a caspase 8 pathway is outlined in Fig. 13. We show that caspase 8 activated by IFNγ increases the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK that, in turn, leads to the serine phosphorylation of STAT1. Evidence for this part of the pathway is supported by the ability of inhibitors of caspase 8 to block IFNγ-mediated phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and STAT1 and the suppression of STAT1 phosphorylation by the p38 inhibitor SB203580. Regulation of p38 MAPK by caspase 8 has been demonstrated previously (24Juo P. Kuo C.J. Yuan J. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1001-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) in a caspase 8-deficient cell line. Additionally, the activation of MEKK-1, the upstream activator of the Jun N-terminal kinases, by caspases provides further evidence for the involvement of caspases in the regulation of MAPKs (25Cardone M.H. Salvesen G.S. Widmann C. Johnson G. Frisch S.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 26Widmann C. Gerwins P. Johnson N.L. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). IFNγ-mediated phosphorylation of STAT1 has been shown to require p38 MAPK (27Goh K.C. Haque S.J. Williams B.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5601-5608Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) but has also been reported to occur through a different signaling pathway (28Kovarik P. Stoiber D. Eyers P.A. Menghini R. Neininger A. Gaestel M. Cohen P. Decker T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13956-13961Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Our studies agree with the requirement of p38 for IFNγ-mediated phosphorylation of STAT1. The differences between these studies may be because of variations in the signaling pathways in the cell types used. The proposed mechanism by which phosphorylated STAT1 inhibits TNFα induction of MMP-9 is based on data from previous studies. It has been shown in TNFα-treated human Ewing's sarcoma EW-7 cells, transfected with the MMP-9 promoter, that phosphorylation of STAT1 by IFNγ can inhibit MMP-9 production through the induction of interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1); IRF-1 suppresses TNFα-induced MMP-9 expression by binding to IFNγ-stimulated responsive elements that overlap NF-κB binding sites on the MMP-9 promoter (18Sanceau J. Boyd D.D. Seiki M. Bauvois B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35766-35775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus IRF-1 inhibits MMP-9 by completing with TNFα-induced NF-κB binding to the MMP-9 promoter. Further support for the suppressive role of STAT-1 on MMP-9 production comes from experiments in which reconstitution of STAT1 in STAT1-deficient tumor cells decreased expression of MMP-9 (29Huang S. Bucana C.D. Van Arsdall M. Fidler I.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Our findings are in agreement with these studies and provide an additional signaling component, caspase 8, as a regulator of STAT1 phosphorylation leading to the IFNγ-induced suppression of MMP-9. These data demonstrate a new and novel effect of IFNγ on the regulation of MMPs, at least in part, through a caspase 8 pathway that is independent of apoptosis. In summary, the findings presented here demonstrate that the effect of IFNγ on the regulation of monocyte involvement in connective tissue turnover is complex and is dependent on the cytokines present at an inflammatory site. Of significance is (a) the ability of IFNγ, in combination with GM-CSF, to stimulate the production of TNFα causing the induction of MMP-1 and (b) the activation of caspase 8 by IFNγ resulting in the stimulation of a p38-STAT1 pathway that inhibits TNFα-stimulated MMP-9 production. The mechanism by which caspase 8 activates p38 is currently under investigation. We thank Dr. Henning Birkedal-Hansen for antibodies against MMP-1 and Drs. Nancy McCartney-Francis and Wanjun Chen for critical review of the manuscript."

NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity is modulated through the participation of two classes of cell surface receptors: activating receptors, which trigger the cytotoxic lysis of target cells, and inhibitory receptors, which transmit signals to block natural cytotoxicity. Inhibitory receptors, such as members of the KIR and murine Ly49 receptor families, primarily recognize class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on target cells. Cells that have diminished or altered expression of class I MHC molecules, as may occur following viral infection or transformation, are unable to engage inhibitory receptors and become susceptible to lysis by NK cells (the “missing self” hypothesis) (1Karre K. Ljunggren H.G. Piontek G. Kiessling R. Nature. 1986; 319: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar, 2Karre K. Scand. J.

The ligands of activation receptors are less well defined but also encompass class I MHC molecules and their homologs. For example, the stress-inducible MHC class I-related chains A and B and UL16 binding proteins are ligands of the activation receptor NKG2D (4Bauer S. Groh V. Wu J. Steinle A. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. Spies T. Science. 1999; 285: 727-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (2062) Google Scholar, 5Cosman D. Mullberg J. Sutherland C.L. Chin W. Armitage R. Fanslow W. Kubin M. Chalupny N.J. Immunity. 2001; 14: 123-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). NK receptors that regulate natural cytotoxic functions belong to two structural classes, the Ig-like and the C-type lectin-like. Both classes have activating and inhibitory members. Despite this structural diversity, certain features unite receptors with common functions; inhibitory receptors contain cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), through which they recruit specific Src homology 2-containing phosphatases following ligand engagement (6Lanier L.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 359-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar). Activating receptors, in contrast, have short cytoplasmic tails lacking tyrosine-based signaling motifs but contain a charged residue in their transmembrane domains through which they associate with activating motif-containing adapter proteins. The natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCR) are a recently characterized family of Ig-like activation receptors that appear to be major triggering receptors in tumor cell recognition, although their ligands are not yet identified (7Moretta A.

NKp46 has two Ig-like extracellular domains followed by a ∼40-residue stalk region, a type I transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail. Through a positively charged residue in the transmembrane region, the receptor associates with the ITAM-containing FcϵRIγ and CD3ζ (12Vitale M. Bottino C. Sivori S. Sanseverino L. Castriconi R.

The gene encoding NKp46 is localized on the leukocyte Ig-like receptor complex on human chromosome 19, which contains a group of homologous immunoreceptors including the Ig-like transcripts (ILT), KIR, leukocyte-associated Ig-like receptors (LAIR), IgA Fc receptor (FcαRI), and platelet collagen receptor glycoprotein VI (17Martin A.M.

NKp46 genes have also been identified in other mammals, including cow, rat, and mouse (19Storset A.K. Slettedal I.O. Williams J.L. Law A. Dissen E. Eur. J.

In efforts to understand the molecular basis of NCR-mediated NK cell activation, we determined the crystal structure of the extracellular ligand binding domains of human NKp46. Protein Expression, Refolding, and Purification—The ectodomain of NKp46 (residues 1-235, excluding the signal sequence) was expressed in pET-22b with a C-terminal tag containing Leu-Glu followed by a His6 purification tag. The receptor was expressed as inclusion bodies in BL21(DE3) cells and reconstituted by a dilution refolding procedure. In brief, inclusion bodies were redissolved in 8 m urea and rapidly diluted in a solution containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.4 m arginine, 5 mm cysteamine, and 1 mm cystamine. The refolded protein was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) followed by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences). Crystallization and Preparation of Heavy Atom Derivatives—NKp46 (9 mg/ml) was crystallized at 18 °C by hanging drop vapor diffusion over solutions containing 8-11% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 2000, 0.1 m MOPS at pH 7.2. Initial crystallization conditions were identified using microbatch procedures with an Oryx 6 robot crystallization station (Douglas Instruments). Crystals (0.07 × 0.07 × 0.3 mm) belong to space group P61 and contain one molecule per asymmetric unit. Heavy atom reagents were screened for reaction with NKp46 in solution by mass spectrometry (22Sun P.D. Hammer C.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Mercury derivatives were generated using relatively high heavy atom reagent concentrations and shorter soak times (23Sun P.D. Radaev S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Native diffraction data were collected at Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team (SER-CAT) 22-ID beamline at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Supporting institutions may be found at www.ser.anl.gov/new/members.html. Derivative data were measured at beamline X9b at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory. All data were integrated and scaled with HKL2000 (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Structure Solution and Refinement—Heavy atom sites were initially interpreted by SOLVE (26Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

MIRAS phases were initially calculated to 3.0 Å using data from three mercury- and one lead-derivatized crystals. Although the lead-soaked crystal was only weakly derivatized, its inclusion with the mercury derivatives appeared to improve the quality of the phases. Following solvent flattening and phase extension to 2.2 Å, the map was readily interpretable. Refinement of the structure against native data was carried out with CNS version 1.0 (28Brunger A.T.

Overview of the Structure of NKp46 D1D2—The crystal structure of the extracellular ligand binding domain of NKp46 was determined to 2.2 Å by MIRAS phasing. Data collection and phasing statistics are listed in Table I. The refined structure includes residues 4-191, corresponding to the two N-terminal Ig domains. No interpretable electron density was found for the 40-residue stalk region that connects the two Ig domains to the transmembrane region. This suggests that the stalk is highly flexible and does not adopt a defined secondary structure. The two Ig domains of NKp46 are arranged in a V-shaped conformation, with an interdomain hinge angle of 85° (Fig. 1). Each Ig domain resembles that of a C2-set Ig fold, with two antiparallel β-sheets formed by strands ABE and C′CFG. NKp46 deviates from the canonical C2 Ig fold in that the first β-strand in each domain is interrupted by a cis proline and is split into two shorter strands A and A′, which pair with strands B and G, respectively. Additional short strands are formed between strands F and G; in D1 this short strand pairs with strand F, while in D2 it pairs with strand G of D1. NKp46 contains short regions of helical conformation, including a 310 helix in the EF loop of each domain. Residues preceding strand G adopt a polyproline II-type helical conformation, as observed in ILT2 (37Chapman T.L. Heikema A.P. West Jr., A.P. Bjorkman P.J. Immunity. 2000; 13: 727-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These residues overlap with sequence motifs similar to the WSXWS motifs first identified in hematopoietic receptors (37Chapman T.L. Heikema A.P. West Jr., A.P. Bjorkman P.J. Immunity. 2000; 13: 727-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar); in NKp46 these motifs are WSXXS and WSFPS in the N- and C-terminal domains, respectively. The side chains of the two serine residues within this motif are hydrogen bonded to main chain atoms in strand F, thus contributing to the stability of the core Ig fold. The observed hinge angle of NKp46 (85°) is very similar to unliganded ILT2 (86°) and KIR2DL2 (84°) but is slightly larger than HLA-Cw3-bound KIR2DL2 (75°). Acute hinge angles are also common to Fc receptors such as FcγRIII and FcϵRI although their relative domain orientation is different (38Garman S.C. Kinet J.P. Jardetzky T.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 973-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 39Zhang Y. Boesen C.C. Radaev S. Brooks A.G. Fridman W.H. Sautes-Fridman C. Sun P.D. Immunity. 2000; 13: 387-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The hinge angle of NKp46 is stabilized by both interdomain hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. Specifically, hydrogen bond pairings between the additional short strand of D2 and the G strand of D1 and between Arg145 and Asn175 and the presence of a salt bridge between Asp93 and His176 contribute to the hinge conformation. The hydrophobic hinge core is formed between residues from strands A′ and G in D1 and residues from strands C and C′, as well as the WSFPS motif in D2. The interface buries 1,021 Å2 of accessible surface area, and comparison of NKp46 sequences across species reveals that 11 of 18 hinge core residues are conserved, indicating that the acute domain orientation is likely to be preserved. Structural Comparison with Ig-like Immunoreceptors—The crystal structure of human NKp46 reported here can be contrasted with the structure of the NKp44 ectodomain, which is a single V-type Ig domain (40Cantoni C. Ponassi M. Biassoni R. Conte R. Spallarossa A. Moretta A. Moretta L. Bolognesi M. Bordo D. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition, a third disulfide bond observed in the structure of NKp44 is absent in NKp46. Furthermore, NKp30 is also predicted to contain a single V-type Ig domain. The two-domain structure of NKp46 does resemble a number of Ig-like cell surface receptors. The closest structural relatives are other leukocyte receptor complex immunoreceptors, including KIR, ILT, and FcαRI (CD89), which are 31-35% identical to NKp46 at the protein sequence level. NKp46 also has structural similarity to FcγRIIb and other Fc receptors of known structure, although sequence identity to these is less than 20%. Structures of the D1D2 domains of three KIR family proteins have been determined alone and in complex with class I MHC ligands (31Snyder G.A. Brooks A.G. Sun P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Superposition of NKp46 with KIR2DL2 (Fig. 2A) resulted in a root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation of 1.1 Å for 71 α-carbon atoms in D1 and 0.9 Å for 78 α-carbon atoms in D2. The D1D2 moieties of ILT2 (LIR-1) and ILT4 (LIR-2) (37Chapman T.L. Heikema A.P. West Jr., A.P. Bjorkman P.J.

Superposition of ILT2 with NKp46 (Fig. 2B) resulted in r.m.s. deviations of 0.9 Å (66 α-carbon atoms) and 1.4 Å (80 α-carbon atoms) for D1 and D2, respectively. The recently reported structures of the FcαRI ectodomain (46Ding Y. Xu G. Yang M. Yao M. Gao G.F. Wang L. Zhang W. Rao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27966-27970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 47Herr A.B. Ballister E.R. Bjorkman P.J. Nature. 2003; 423: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and its complex with Fcα (47Herr A.B. Ballister E.R. Bjorkman P.J. Nature. 2003; 423: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) also underscore the structural relationship between leukocyte Ig-like receptor complex members. The structure of free FcαRI (47Herr A.B. Ballister E.R. Bjorkman P.J. Nature. 2003; 423: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) was superimposed with NKp46 (Fig. 2C) with r.m.s. deviations of 2.1 Å (D1, 70 α-carbon atoms) and 1.9 Å (D2, 93 α-carbon atoms). NKp46 can be distinguished primarily from KIR, ILT, and FcαRI by the conformation and length of several loops. For example, the CC′ loop in D1 is shorter than in KIR, ILT2, and FcαRI. Like KIR and Fcα-complexed FcαRI, NKp46 contains a longer C′ strand in D1 as compared with ILT2 and free FcαRI, which are followed by a helical stretch and a D strand, respectively. The C′E loop in D1 has divergent conformations in the structures examined; in NKp46 this loop includes three proline residues and three basic residues and adopts an unusual meandering conformation. The nearby FG loop adopts similar conformations in NKp46 and FcαRI, while in ILT2 it is twisted relative to the plane of the FG strands and in KIR it is lengthened by three residues and forms a protruding flap (Fig. 2A). In D2, the C′E and FG loops vary in length among the receptors. The EF loop also varies, although the conformation in NKp46 resembles that in FcαRI, including a single turn of 310 helix. Implications for Ligand Binding—NKp46 has been reported to bind both influenza virus hemagglutinin and Sendai virus hemagglutinin-neuraminidase, and this interaction appears to involve terminal sialic residues on NKp46 (48Mandelboim O. Lieberman N. Lev M. Paul L. Arnon T.I. Bushkin Y. Davis D.M. Strominger J.L. Yewdell J.W. Porgador A. Nature. 2001; 409: 1055-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Human NKp46 is predicted to contain a single N-linked (Asn195) and two O-linked (Thr104 and Thr204) glycosylation sites. Two of these sites (Asn195 and Thr204) are located in the membrane proximal stalk, which was disordered in the structure. Thr104 is located in D1D2 in a solvent-exposed position near the D1-D2 juncture. This location is close to the ligand binding site of KIR receptors (see below). However, none of the three putative glycosylation sites in human NKp46 are conserved in all species. To date, no cellular ligands of NKp46 have been identified, although NKp46 has been shown to mediate NK cell cytolysis of certain human tumor cells. A murine homolog of NKp46 has been identified (20Biassoni R. Pessino A. Bottino C. Pende D. Moretta L. Moretta A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1014-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), which is 58% identical to the human receptor (Fig. 3). Intriguingly, it has been reported that murine tumor cells are susceptible to killing via human NKp46 (9Pessino A. Sivori S. Bottino C. Malaspina A. Morelli L. Moretta L. Biassoni R. Moretta A. J.

Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar, 2Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, the vacuolar ATPase is found in the endomembrane system, where it functions to acidify subcellular compartments such as endosomes, lysosomes, Golgi-derived vesicles, clathrin-coated vesicles, synaptic vesicles, the plant vacuole, and chromaffin granules. Acidification of these organelles plays a vital role in processes like protein trafficking, receptor-mediated endocytosis, neurotransmitter release, intracellular pH maintenance, and waste management. A vacuolar type ATPase is also found in the plasma membrane of certain specialized cells such as renal intercalated cells or osteoclasts, where acidification of an enclosed extracellular space is required. Despite their widespread nature, V-ATPases are remarkably similar with respect to their functionality and overall architecture (5Wilkens S. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 34: 191-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Early studies using electron microscopy have shown that the complex is organized in two major domains, a membrane extrinsic V1 and a membrane-embedded V0 (6Dschida W.J. Bowman B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18783-18789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATP is hydrolyzed on the membrane extrinsic V1, and the energy released during that process is transmitted to the membrane-bound V0 to drive ion translocation. This energy coupling occurs via the so-called “stalk” structure, an assembly of several polypeptides that forms the functional and structural interface between the two active domains of the complex. The eukaryotic V-ATPase is composed of at least 13 different polypeptides with molecular masses ranging from 12 to 100 kDa. The water-soluble V1 contains subunits ABCDEFGH, and the membrane-embedded V0 is made of subunits a(c,c′)c″d. The subunit stoichiometry has been determined in the bovine enzyme to 3:3:1:1:1:1:2:2 for the V1 and 1:4–5:1:1 for the V0 domain (7Arai H. Terres G. Pink S. Forgac M. J. Biol.

Acta. 2000; 1458: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), energy coupling involves rotation of a central stalk domain with respect to the static remainder of the complex. In the V-ATPase, the rotor has been shown to contain subunits D and F (10Imamura H. Nakano M. Noji H. Muneyuki E. Ohkuma S. Yoshida M. Yokoyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A comparison of the electron microscopic images of the yeast V1 with the images of the bovine V1V0 indicates that the structure of the V1 when detached from the V0 is very similar to the structure of the V1 domain in the intact V-ATPase complex. Materials—All chemicals were from Sigma unless noted otherwise. Premixed YEPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) and leucine dropout medium was from Difco and Invitrogen, respectively. M2 anti-FLAG affinity-agarose, anti-FLAG IgG, and FLAG peptide were from Sigma. Anti-subunit A and B monoclonal antibodies were from Molecular Probes, Inc. Protein concentrations were determined with the BCA assay system (Pierce). Construction of a FLAG-tagged Vma10p—A single FLAG epitope was placed immediately after the N-terminal methionine of VMA10 by fusion PCR as follows. Two fragments of VMA10 containing extensions corresponding to overlapping portions of the FLAG epitope were amplified from yeast genomic DNA using oligonucleotide pairs VMA10-P1 and VMA10-P9 FLAG and VMA10-P2 and VMA10-P8 FLAG and a combination of LA-Taq (Panvera) and Native Pfu (Stratagene) polymerases. The sequences of the oligonucleotides (purchased from MWG Biotech) were as follows: P1, 5′-AGCGTTGTAATGCCTATAG-3′; P2, 5′-GATAGTTGTAGTCCCTCGG-3′; P8 FLAG, 5′-CTTGTCATCGTCG-TCCTTGTAGTCCATTCTGCTTTGTATACCTTGCA-3′; P9 FLAG, 5′-GACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGTCCCAAAAAAACGGAATTGC-CA-3′. PCR fragments from the initial amplification were purified and combined. The fusion product was PCR-amplified by adding oligonucleotides P1 and P2 to the fragments, along with the polymerase mixture described above. The fusion PCR product was treated with Taq polymerase to add a non-templated dATP and then recovered in plasmid pGEM-T Easy (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The fusion placed a single FLAG epitope immediately after the ATG and also deleted the intron present in VMA10; the sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing (SUNY Upstate Medical University Sequencing Facility). The tagged VMA10 gene was excised from pGEM-T Easy with BamHI and XhoI and cloned into the low copy (CEN) vector pRS315 (19Sikorsky R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the same enzymes. The plasmid was transformed into yeast strain SF838–5Aa vma10Δ::URA3 (20Charsky C.M. Schumann N.J. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37232-37239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) using an overnight lithium acetate procedure (21Elble R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar), and transformants were selected by growth on supplemented minimal medium lacking leucine. Vacuoles isolated from this strain as described (15Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had levels of concanamycin A-sensitive ATPase activity comparable with wild type vacuoles. 2M. Tarsio and P. M. Kane, manuscript in preparation. Yeast V1-ATPase Purification—Yeast V1-ATPase was purified via a FLAG tag introduced into the N terminus of the VMA10 gene product (Vma10p, subunit G). Briefly, yeast was grown in small scale over night to an A600 of around 3 in leucine dropout medium, and 25 ml of the resulting inocculum was added to 1 liter of unbuffered YEPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) in a 2.8-liter Fernbach flask. The flasks were incubated at 30 °C under vigorous shaking until an A600 of around 3 (early log phase). Yeast was harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1.2 m sorbitol, 2% glucose. Yeast was converted to spheroplasts by incubation with zymolase (100 units per gram of yeast) for 20 min at 30 °C. Spheroplasts were collected by centrifugation, and V1 was dissociated from vacuolar membranes by incubation for 5 min at 30 °C with gentle shaking in YP medium without glucose. Spheroplasts were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in the same volume of TBSE (20 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) and the protease inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (at concentrations of 1 μg/ml, 5 μg/ml, 1 μg/ml, and 1 mm, respectively) were added shortly before cells were lysed by two to three passages through a French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 275,000 × g for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was then applied to a small column packed with 1 ml of anti-FLAG M2 agarose. The anti-FLAG column was washed with 10 column volumes of TBSE, and pure V1-ATPase was eluted with a solution containing 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide in TBSE. V1-ATPase containing fractions were pooled and precipitated by addition of 60% ammonium sulfate, and the redissolved protein was further purified by gel filtration over a 1 × 30-cm Superdex200 column attached to an Äkta fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). Gel filtration was carried out in TBSE (+1 mm DTT). V1-ATPase-containing fractions were pooled and precipitated by addition of saturated ammonium sulfate to 60% saturation, and the redissolved protein was desalted by passage over two consecutive Sephadex G25 spin columns in TBSE (+1 mm DTT). ATPase Activity—ATP hydrolysis activity of V1-ATPase was determined in the presence of 5 mm ATP, 1.6 mm CaCl2, 30 units/ml each of lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase, 0.5 mm NADH, 2 mm phosphoenol pyruvate in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, at 37 °C. The ATP hydrolysis reaction was started by adding between 0.5 and 5 μg of purified V1-ATPase to 1 ml of the assay mix. After a given time (between 0.5 and 40 min), the amount of ADP produced by the V1-ATPase was determined by adding 4 mm MgCl2 and monitoring the absorbance decrease at 340 nm. No significant ATP hydrolysis activity could be measured in this assay system when both Mg2+ and Ca2+ were present in the assay before adding the V1-ATPase. In-gel Trypsin Digestion of V-ATPase Subunits—Protein bands were excised from SDS gels, and samples for mass spectrometry were obtained from the gel slices essentially as described (22Gharahdahgi F. Weinberg C. Meagher D. Imai B. Mische S. Elctrophoresis. 1999; 20: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Briefly, gel slices were dehydrated with acetonitrile and dried. Buffer containing sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) at a concentration of 12 μg/ml was used to rehydrate the gel pieces, which were incubated with the protease overnight at 37 °C. The resulting peptide fragments were extracted twice with acetonitrile plus 5% trifluoroacetic acid. The extractions were pooled and completely dried in a speed vac. The eluted peptides were resuspended in a 1:1 mixture of acetonitrile/water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and mixed with the appropriate matrix in the manner described below. MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry and Protein Identification—All mass spectra were acquired on a PerSeptive Biosystems (Framingham, MA) Voyager DE-STR equipped with an N2 laser (337 nm, 3-ns pulse width, 3-Hz repetition rate). The mass spectra were acquired in the positive reflector mode with delayed extraction. The matrix used was α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnaminic acid, 10 mg/ml in a 1:1 solution of acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Typically, the extracted peptides were diluted in the matrix 1:10 prior to applying 1 μl to the sample plate. Data searches were carried out against the National Center for Biotechnology Information, nonredundant data base using Protein Prospector (prospector.ucsf.edu) to identify the protein bands. Internal mass calibration was obtained by using trypsin fragments at 842.51 and 2211.10 Da allowing a mass error tolerance of less than 30 ppm in most samples. Without mass calibration, the error tolerance was increased to 200 ppm during the data base search. Electron Microscopy—For negative staining, protein at a concentration of between 20 and 50 μg/ml in TBS (+1 mm DTT) was applied to glow discharged carbon-coated copper grids. Grids were washed once with water, stained with 1% uranyl acetate, and air-dried. Grids were examined in Philips CM300 and Tecnai12 transmission electron microscopes operating at 100 kV. Images were recorded in low dose mode with a 1024 × 1024 (CM300) and 2048 × 2048 (Tecnai12) pixel charge-coupled device (Gatan Inc.) in single frame or montage mode or on Eastman Kodak Co. SO163 film, which was developed in D19 developer for 12 min. For cryoelectron microscopy, V1-ATPase at a concentration of 0.1–0.2 mg/ml in TBS (+1 mm DTT) was applied to holey carbon-coated copper grids (Structure Probe Inc. or in-house production) and plunged into liquid ethane cooled by liquid nitrogen. Frozen samples were mounted in a Gatan cryo stage and examined under low dose conditions. Images of stained samples were recorded with an underfocus of between 382 and 576 nm and an electron optical magnification of ×47,000, placing the 1st zero of the contrast transfer function at around 1/20 Å-1. Images of frozen samples were recorded at an underfocus of -960 nm. Analysis of Stained Images—Images were analyzed with the EMAN (23Lüdtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2107) Google Scholar) and IMAGIC 5 (24van Heel M. Harauz G. Orlova E.V. Schmidt R. Schatz M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar) software packages running on SGI workstations (O2 and octane) essentially as described (13Wilkens S. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31804-31810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 25Wilkens S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44064-44068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, two data sets from different preparations (5000 and 7600 images, respectively) were selected from 20 3 × 3 charge-coupled device frames (CM300) and 49 2048 × 2048 charge-coupled device frames (Tecnai12), respectively. The images were normalized and band pass filtered to remove low (<0.015 Å-1) and high (>0.1 Å-1) spatial frequencies. The data sets were then analyzed by the alignment by classification (26Dube P. Tavares P. Lurz R. van Heel M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1303-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) procedure leading to sets of initial references that were used in a first multireference alignment step. The multireference alignment was iterated until no further improvement in the class sums was obtained. A visual inspection of the results revealed that the analysis of the two different data sets produced very similar class sums. At this point, the two data sets were merged for further analysis. To start up the three-dimensional reconstruction, 100 of the best class sums were selected, normalized, and surrounded by a soft mask. A set of initial Euler angles was then assigned to the projections with the startAny program within EMAN, assuming 3-fold symmetry of the complex. The resulting 3-fold symmetric model was then used to produce an anchor set for refinement (all subsequent refinement was done within IMAGIC 5) with the original input projections, this time assuming C1 symmetry (no symmetry at all). After seven rounds of refinement, the resulting model was filtered to remove noise (density not connected to the main volume of the model) and forward-projected along 49 directions uniformly distributed over the Euler sphere. The 49 projections were normalized and used as references in a new multi-reference alignment step. Fifty of the images aligned to each reference were summed and used as input projections for a new three-dimensional model. This process was iterated increasing the number of forward projections, and images were summed for each reference until no further improvement was observed. At this point, classification of the aligned data set produced very similar class sums compared with the ones used to start up the three-dimensional reconstruction. The resolution of the final reconstruction was estimated by calculating the Fourier shell correlation between two 3D models each calculated from half the input projections (27Schatz M. Orlova E.V. Dube P. Jäger J. van Heel M. J. Struct. Biol. 1995; 114: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 28Böttcher B. Wynne S.A. Crowther R.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). The final model was filtered to 0.05 Å-1, corresponding to the first zero in the contrast transfer function. Analysis of Cryoimages—Electron micrographs recorded at ×47,000 were digitized on an Optronics drum scanner with a sampling rate of 18.75 μm corresponding to 4 Å/pixel on the specimen level. A total of 40,000 individual images were selected from 18 micrographs using the automatic particle picking routine within EMAN. The images were treated as above and sorted into 400 classes by the alignment by classification procedure. A visual inspection of the alignment by classification classums revealed that virtually all the averages showed the pseudo-trigonal top (or bottom) view of the molecule with few classes showing a slightly tilted top or bottom view and essentially no classes showing a clearly identifiable side view, thus far preventing the calculation of a reliable 3D model of the V1-ATPase from the cryoimages with the angular reconstitution procedure. Yeast V1-ATPase Purification—Introduction of a FLAG epitope tag into the N terminus of the yeast vacuolar ATPase G subunit (Vma10p) allows efficient and rapid isolation of highly purified V1-ATPase complex. Fig. 1A shows SDS-PAGE of V1-ATPase purified this way. The left gel in Fig. 1A shows elution of the anti-FLAG-agarose with FLAG peptide. On the gel, eight protein bands (excluding the weak band running at the top of the gel) can be clearly identified (close inspection of the 2nd major band from the top showed that this band is composed of two bands running close together). To verify the identity of the bands, peptide mass fingerprinting by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed. Fig. 1B shows the results of the peptide mass fingerprinting from the protein bands excised from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The data show that the eight bands in the order from top to bottom could be unambiguously identified as yeast V1-ATPase subunits A, B, H, C, D, E, F, and G. Mass spectra for the contaminating band running above the A subunit (slice 1) did not allow unambiguous identification of the protein(s) contributing to this band. To remove any potential excess of G subunit that might be present in the cytosol, the V1-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, and treated by size exclusion chromatography. The middle gel shows analysis of the fractions eluted from the gel filtration column. As can be seen, pure V1-ATPase is eluted in a single peak including fractions 19–22, well resolved from the following peaks containing subunits G, E, C, and H (fraction 26) and a peak containing essentially only subunit G (fraction 31). V1-containing fractions from the gel filtration column were pooled, precipitated by addition of 60% ammonium sulfate, dissolved in TBSE (+DTT), and desalted over two consecutive Sephadex G25 centrifuge columns in the same buffer. The preparation eluted from the second spin column is shown in the right gel of Fig. 1A. As can be seen, all the subunits of the V1-ATPase are present in the preparation. The low intensity of the subunit C band suggests that this subunit is present in sub-stoichiometric amounts. To analyze the oligomeric state of the complex, native gel electrophoresis was performed. Fig. 1C shows a 1% agarose gel of FLAG tag-purified V1-ATPase. The complex runs as a single band on the native gel, which, when analyzed by a second-dimension polyacrylamide gel in the presence of SDS, contains all the polypeptides of the V-ATPase identified above. Ca2+-ATPase Activity—The ATPase activity of the affinity purified V1 was determined in presence of 5 mm ATP, 1.6 mm Ca2+. The amount of ADP released after given amounts of time was determined with an ATP regenerating system containing phosphoenol pyruvate, pyruvate kinase, NADH, and lactate dehydrogenase. Because V1-ATPase is inhibited by even low concentrations of magnesium (see below), the ATP hydrolysis reaction and the following ADP determination could be performed in the same assay mix. The ATP hydrolysis reaction was started by adding V1-ATPase to an assay mix containing CaATP and the components necessary for ADP rephosphorylation. After given amounts of time, ATP hydrolysis by the V1-ATPase was stopped by addition of 4 mm Mg2+. At the same time, addition of magnesium activated the magnesium-dependent pyruvate kinase, which could then rephosphorylate the ADP coupled to the oxidation of NADH. Under these conditions, an initial ATP hydrolysis rate of ∼6 μmol/min/mg was observed (±1 μmol/min/mg; two preparations). Over time, the rate of ATP hydrolysis by the yeast V1-ATPase was decreasing from the initial rate of 6 μmol/min/mg to below 0.5 μmol/min/mg after 30 min. Fig. 2 shows a representative measurement of the time dependence of the Ca-ATPase activity of FLAG tag-purified V1-ATPase. A short (<1 min) activity lag after addition of V1-ATPase to the assay mix was seen in some experiments but not others. When V1-ATPase was added to the assay mix in the presence of 1.6 mm Ca2+ and even low concentrations of Mg2+, only a short burst of ATPase activity could be observed with a specific activity of less than 0.5 units/mg when measured over the first 30 s after addition of V1 to the assay mix. This suggests that MgATP competes with CaATP and that MgATP binds more tightly to the catalytic sites than CaATP but is not turned over. No ATPase activity could be measured in the absence of Ca2+. Electron Microscopy of Yeast V1-ATPase—The data summarized above indicate that the FLAG tag-isolated V1-ATPase is highly purified, enzymatically active, stable, and monodisperse, properties that are prerequisites for structural and functional studies by biochemical and biophysical methods. For negative stain electron microscopy, yeast V1-ATPase was applied to glow discharged carbon-coated copper grids and washed on the grid with 1% uranyl acetate. Fig. 3A shows a section of a typical electron micrograph of negatively stained yeast V1-ATPase. As can be seen, the preparation is highly monodisperse, consistent with the native gel electrophoresis results (see above). Only few smaller protein molecules are visible on the electron microscopy images, suggesting that no significant dissociation of the V1-ATPase complex occurs under the conditions used to prepare the specimen (1% uranyl acetate, pH 5). Two data sets of V1 molecules from different preparations were analyzed by alignment and classification procedures. Fig. 3B shows a selection of the most characteristic projections obtained after several rounds of multireference alignment. Most distinct are the top and side view projections in which the molecule is seen perpendicular or parallel to the membrane surface, respectively. The top view projection shows two sets of each three large densities arranged alternatingly around a central cavity (see black and white arrows in Fig. 3B, image 3). The densities can be interpreted as the alternating A and B subunits of the V-ATPase. A clear handedness is present in these projections making it possible to distinguish whether the molecule is seen from the top or the bottom. Other views represent projections of the molecule from the side. Fig. 3C shows the side view projection of the bovine V-ATPase (taken from Ref. 13Wilkens S. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31804-31810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Comparison of the yeast V1-ATPase side view projections with the bovine holo enzyme projections allows orientation of the V1-side views with respect to the membrane surface. The comparison also shows that the projection structure of the isolated yeast V1 is very similar to the projected structure of the V1-domain in the bovine holo enzyme. Several features visible in the bovine V1 domain are also present in the yeast V1-ATPase: the elongated and knob-like densities at the top of the molecule (see arrows in Fig. 3B, images 5 and 10, respectively) and the stalk domain consisting of two to three densities in the yeast V1 (see arrowheads in images 1 and 7). The dimensions of the yeast V1-ATPase are ∼14 × 20 nm, including the stalk and the protruding densities at the top of the molecule. Three-dimensional Reconstruction of the Yeast V1-ATPase—To start up the three-dimensional reconstruction, 100 of the best projections from the merged data set including the ones shown in Fig. 3B were used. A 3-fold symmetry was assumed in this initial step of the three-dimensional reconstruction based on the composition of the catalytic core of the complex, A3B3, which accounts for ∼85% of the total mass of the V1 excluding the stalk region. In the following refinement steps, C1 (no symmetry at all) was assumed. After seven rounds of refinement, the 3D model was projected along 49 directions uniformly distributed on the Euler sphere, and the projections were used as references in a multireference alignment step.

https://openalex.org/W2090751165,"The amyloid precursor protein (APP) undergoes “alternative” proteolysis mediated by caspases. Three major caspase recognition sites have been identified in the APP, i.e. one at the C terminus (Asp720) and two at the N terminus (Asp197 and Asp219). Caspase cleavage at Asp720 has been suggested as leading to increased production of Aβ. Thus, we set out to determine which putative caspase sites in APP, if any, are cleaved in Chinese hamster ovary cell lines concurrently with the increased Aβ production that occurs during apoptosis. We found that cleavage at Asp720 occurred concurrently with caspase 3 activation and the increased production of total secreted Aβ and Aβ1-42 in association with staurosporine- and etoposide-induced apoptosis. To investigate the contribution of caspase cleavage of APP to Aβ generation, we expressed an APP mutant truncated at Asp720 that mimics APP caspase cleavage at the C-terminal site. This did not increase Aβ generation but, in contrast, dramatically decreased Aβ production in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Furthermore, the ablation of caspase-dependent cleavage at Asp720, Asp197, and Asp219 (by site-directed mutagenesis) did not prevent enhanced Aβ production following etoposide-induced apoptosis. These findings indicate that the enhanced Aβ generation associated with apoptosis does not require cleavage of APP at its C-terminal (Asp720) and/or N-terminal caspase sites.

AD is characterized by β-amyloid deposition, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, and extensive loss of neurons. Amyloid plaques are formed by aggregates of amyloid-β-peptide, a 37-43 amino acid fragment (primarily Aβ40 and Aβ42) generated by proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is cleaved sequentially by β-secretase and γ-secretase to release Aβ constitutively from neuronal and non-neuronal cells. APP proteolysis by β- and α-secretases results in the production of β- and α-APP secreted fragments (APPs) as well as the C99 and C83 APP-C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs), respectively. The C99 and C83 APP-CTFs then serve as substrates for γ-secretase, resulting in the production of Aβ or p3, respectively (1De Strooper B. Annaert W. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1857-1870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the normal APP processing, “alternative” processing of APP by caspases has also been reported. Apoptosis is a form of cell death triggered by the activation of an intrinsic cellular program deliberately invoked by the cell in response to environmental and or developmentally associated signals (2Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12927) Google Scholar). The death machinery can be activated by diverse stimuli and has as its central component a group of proteolytic enzymes called caspases. Caspases exhibit primary specificity for aspartic acid residues (3Thornberry N.A. Br. Med. Bull. 1997; 53: 478-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). To date, more then 280 proteins have been shown to be substrates of one or more caspases in mammalian cells. Among them are proteins involved in cell death, cell cycle regulation, cytoskeleton organization, DNA and RNA metabolism, signal transduction, cytokine maturation, and gene transcription (4Fischer U. Janicke R.U. Schulze-Osthoff K. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 76-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that APP is also a substrate for caspase cleavage. Each of the four caspases, 3, 6, 7, and 8, have been shown to cleave APP in in vitro assays, and a major caspase site has been identified at Asp-720 (VEVD), resulting in the release of a fragment containing the last 31 amino-acids of APP (C31) and the production of APPΔC31 (lacking Ala721 to Asn751) (5Gervais F.G.

Two other major caspase sites have been recently identified at the N-terminal domain of APP Asp197 and Asp219, leading to the production of a ∼90 kDa fragment (APPΔN). APP caspase-dependent cleavage at Asp720 has been shown to occur in cultured cells stimulated to undergo apoptosis, in vivo in brains of human AD subjects, and following the induction of brain ischemic injury in animal models (5Gervais F.G.

In light of these findings, we set out to study the effects of apoptosis on Aβ production and the potential role of caspase-dependent cleavage of APP in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Here, we report that staurosporine- and etoposide-induced apoptosis increases levels of both Aβtotal and Aβ1-42 independently of caspase cleavage of APP at Asp720, Asp219, and Asp197.

Cell Culture, Transient Transfection, Western Blot Analysis, and Induction of Apoptosis—CHO cell lines stably transfected with APP751 and wild-type PS1 were cultured as described previously (14Wolfe M.S.

We used CHO cell lines overexpressing APP to measure secreted Aβtotal and Aβ42 during apoptosis. Because Aβ42 normally represents only 10% of the Aβtotal, we expressed APP751 to generate amounts of Aβ42 that could be detected by the ELISA. To induce apoptosis, we used staurosporine (STS) and etoposide (Eto) (Calbiochem), an inhibitor of topoisomerase II. CHO cells were seeded at the density of 0.5 × 106 cells per well in 6-well plates. After 48 h, cells were treated with STS (1 μm) or etoposide (100 μg/ml) for the indicated time (Figs. 1 and 3). To inhibit caspase activation, a sister plate of cells was pre-treated with zVAD (200 μm, Enzyme Systems Products) for 1 h before induction of apoptosis. For transient transfection, CHO naive cells were seeded at the density of 0.5 × 106 cells per well in 6-well plates, and after 24 h the APP cDNA clones were transfected using Superfect reagent (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were treated with etoposide 24 h after transfection. Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (15Tesco G. Kim T.W. Diehlmann A. Beyreuther K.

At least three different experiments were carried out, and each experiment was performed at least in triplicate. Immunofluorescence and Terminal Deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) Staining—For immunofluorescence microscopy, cells were grown on glass coverslips for 48 h and then treated with STS or Eto, with or without zVAD. Cells were fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde (Tousimis Research Corp.) and then washed three times with PBS. Nonspecific immunostaining was blocked by incubation for 1 h at room temperature in PBS with 4% normal goat serum and 0.2% Triton X-100. The primary antibody anti-ΔCcspAPP or anti-caspase 3 active fragment was incubated for 2 h at room temperature 1:2000 in PBS containing 4% normal goat serum. After three washes with PBS, the cells were incubated with a donkey anti-rabbit-CY3-conjugated antibody (Jackson Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature 1:400 in PBS containing 4% normal goat serum. After three washes in PBS, nuclear fragmentation was detected by in situ labeling with a TUNEL assay kit (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates) and examined by laser scanning confocal microscopy. APP Undergoes Caspase-dependent Cleavage—Although extensive in vitro studies have shown that both upstream and downstream recombinant caspases cleave APP at various sites, it is not clear which putative caspase sites in APP, if any, are cleaved in cells concurrently with the increased Aβ production observed during apoptosis. Thus, we set out to study caspase cleavage of APP in the CHO cell lines stably transfected with both wild-type APP751 and wild-type PS1. We first determined the temporal pattern of caspase-dependent cleavage of APP. Western blot (WB) analysis of lysates from various time points following STS treatment was performed using a battery of anti-APP antibodies. Full-length APP was cleaved to produce a ∼90 kDa fragment that was immunoreactive for the 6E10 antibody (amino acids 1-17 Aβ region) at time points 12 and 24 h (indicated as APPNcas in Fig. 1A). Treatment with zVAD prevented the formation of this fragment, indicating that its generation required caspase activation (Fig. 1A). When the same blot was reprobed with a C8 antibody raised against the last 10 amino acids of APP, the ∼90 kDa fragment was only detected at the 12-h time point (Fig. 1A). The lack of detection of the ∼90 kDa fragment at the 24-h time point indicated that caspase cleavage at Asp720 had occurred, removing the last 31 amino acids of APP. To further characterize the origin of the ∼90 kDa caspase-derived fragment, cell lysates from a separate time course experiment were immunoprecipitated with an R1155 antibody, raised against an epitope (amino acids 705-720) immediately N-terminal to the Asp720 caspase cleavage site. As expected, 6E10 detected the ∼90 kDa fragment at the 9- and 24-h time points (Fig. 1B). When the same blot was reprobed with 22C11, raised against amino acids 66-81 at the N-terminal fragment of APP, the caspase-dependent ∼90 kDa fragment was not detected (Fig. 1B). Thus, during STS-induced apoptosis, full-length APP undergoes caspase-dependent cleavage at the N terminus, resulting in the production of a ∼90kDa APPNcas caspase fragment. APP-CTFs (C99 and C83) are normally generated in cells by the cleavage of full-length APP by β- and α-secretases, respectively and they both serve as substrates for γ-secretase. Because APP-CTFs contain the caspase site at Asp720, we also studied caspase-dependent cleavage of APP-CTFs. C83 is the predominant APP-CTF detected in CHO cells. Using C8, we detected a slight decrease in the amount of APP-CTF at the 6-h time point; zVAD treatment prevented this decrease (Fig. 1C). More interestingly, when WB was performed using R1155, a caspase-derived fragment of ∼6.5 kDa was detected in the STS-treated cells at the 12-h time point, consistent with cleavage at Asp720 (APP-CTFΔC31) (Fig. 1C). At the same time point, the ∼90kDa fragment derived by caspase-dependent cleavage of full-length APP could still be detected by C8 (Fig. 1A). A nonspecific band just below APP was also present at several time points, including time point 0, but was not detected in either 6E10 or C8 immunoprecipitates at the 6-h time point (data not shown). Cleavage at Asp720 was detected initially (6 h) as a reduction in APP-CTF and by the generation of the ∼6.5 kDa fragment at the 12-h time point. We could not rule out the possibility that cleavage at Asp720 of full-length APP was occurring at the 6-h time point. A similar decrease in full-length APP, due to cleavage at Asp720, was not detected because the band corresponding to full-length APP was saturated, and APPΔC31 is likely to co-migrate with full-length APP under these SDS-PAGE conditions. Like others (6Pellegrini L. Passer B.J. Tabaton M. Ganjei J.K. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21011-21016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), we were not able to detect the C-terminal product of APP caspase cleavage at Asp720 (C31). In the same experiment, the time course for caspase 3 activation was determined using an antibody that specifically recognizes the 17-kDa caspase 3-active fragment. We found that caspase 3 activation coincided with cleavage of APP-CTF at Asp720 at the 6-h time point (Fig. 1D). These data indicate that cleavage of the APP-CTF at Asp720 occurs prior to cleavage of the full-length APP at Asp197 and Asp219, which generates the N terminus of the ∼90 kDa APP fragment (APPNcas). Caspase 3 Activation and APP Asp720 Cleavage Are Temporally Coordinated—To show that caspase-dependent cleavage of APP occurs in intact cells, we performed immunofluorescence microscopy analysis using specific antibodies raised against APPΔC31 (Gervais et al.; Ref. 5Gervais F.G. Xu D. Robertson G.S. Vaillancourt J.P. Zhu Y. Huang J. LeBlanc A. Smith D. Rigby M. Shearman M.S. Clarke E.E. Zheng H. Van Der Ploeg L.H. Ruffolo S.C. Thornberry N.A. Xanthoudakis S. Zamboni R.J. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 395-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar) or the active fragment of caspase 3. Caspase 3 activation and APPΔC31 cleavage was detected in TUNEL positive (apoptotic) cells (Fig. 2A). Time course experiments revealed that caspase 3 activation and APPΔC31 cleavage (Fig. 2B) are temporally coordinated during staurosporine treatment in TUNEL-positive cells. Furthermore, this method was more sensitive than WB analysis, as we were able to detect caspase 3 activation and APPΔC31 cleavage as early as the 3-h time point. These results confirmed the WB data showing that the cleavage at Asp720 temporally coincides with caspase 3 activation. Apoptosis Enhances Aβtotal and Aβ1-42 Production—We next addressed the question of whether Aβ generation was increased during apoptosis concurrently with APP Asp720 cleavage. Secreted Aβ was measured in the conditioned media of cells treated with STS (1 μm) for 6 h using a sensitive ELISA (14Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). Both Aβtotal and Aβ1-42 were significantly increased in STS-treated cells (p < 0.05; paired t test). When cells were pretreated with zVAD for 1 h before STS, Aβtotal and Aβ1-42 were reduced compared with STS-treated cells; but the decrease was significant (p < 0.05; paired t test) only for Aβtotal (Fig. 3A). It has been suggested that Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 are generated in different cell compartments and that Aβ1-42 is mainly generated in the ER (16Wild-Bode C. Yamazaki T. Capell A. Leimer U. Steiner H.

Furthermore, peptide aldehyde γ-secretase inhibitors differentially block production of secreted Aβ1-40 relative to secreted Aβ1-42 and, at some doses, can stimulate production of Aβ1-42 while inhibiting Aβ1-40 generation (18Skovronsky D.M.

Zheng H. Lee V.M. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) reported that presenilins are nor required for Aβ1-42 production in the endoplasmic reticulum/intermediate compartment, raising the possibility that Aβ1-42 might be generated by the activity of a different γ-secretase. Similarly, one could hypothesize that the increase in Aβ1-42 may involve the activation of different caspases, which may have different affinities for the same inhibitor and/or be localized in distinct organelles. Whereas 6 h of STS treatment clearly induced apoptosis (based on caspase 3 activation and TUNEL-positive cells) (Fig. 2), we next confirmed that the effect on Aβ generation was directly due to apoptosis and was independent of the drug treatment. For this purpose, apoptosis was induced with etoposide, a topoisomerase II inhibitor. Cells were treated for 12 h with 100 μg/ml etoposide. Treatment with either STS for 6 h or etoposide for 12 h reduced cell viability by 10-20% as assayed by MTT reduction (data not shown). Both secreted Aβtotal and Aβ1-42 were significantly increased (p < 0.05; paired t test) (Fig. 3B). Caspase cleavage of APP at Asp720 was detected by immunofluorescence using the anti-ΔCcspAPP antibody (Fig. 3C). These data indicate that the increase in Aβ and APP cleavage at Asp720 occurs at the same time point and concurrently with caspase 3 activation. Deletion of the Last 31 Amino Acids of APP Decreases Aβ Production in CHO Cells—We next asked whether APP cleavage at Asp720 was involved in the increased Aβ generation observed during apoptosis. Gervais et al. (5Gervais F.G. Xu D. Robertson G.S. Vaillancourt J.P. Zhu Y. Huang J. LeBlanc A. Smith D. Rigby M. Shearman M.S. Clarke E.E. Zheng H. Van Der Ploeg L.H. Ruffolo S.C. Thornberry N.A. Xanthoudakis S. Zamboni R.J. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 395-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar) first proposed that caspase-dependent cleavage at APP Asp720 was responsible for the increased Aβ generation associated with apoptosis, reporting that the expression of APP cDNA deleted at Asp720 (APPΔC31) results in a 5-fold increase in total Aβ production in rat B103 cells. Thus, we set out to determine whether the expression of APPΔC31 in CHO cells would increase Aβ generation. Naïve CHO cells were transiently transfected with APPWT, APPΔC31, or vector alone. Secreted Aβ was measured by ELISA in conditioned media after 24 and 48 h of transfection. CHO cells transfected with APPWT underwent a large increase in total Aβ generation. However, cells overexpressing APPΔC31 exhibited a dramatic decrease (Fig. 4A) of ∼90 and ∼75% at 24 and 48 h, respectively, in Aβ total production as compared with APPWT (Fig. 4B). Western blot analysis of cell lysates from transfected cells showed that the different cDNAs overexpressed comparable amounts of APP (Fig. 4C). We found that removal of the last 31 amino acids of APP did not increase but, instead, decreased Aβ production in CHO cells, indicating that cleavage at Asp720 does not underlie enhanced Aβ production following caspase activation. Lack of Caspase Cleavage at APP Asp 720/Asp 219/Asp197 Does Not Prevent Increased Aβ Production during Apoptosis—We and others have shown that caspase inhibitors can reduce the ability of apoptosis to increase Aβ generation. The latter effect could be due simply to the prevention of the cleavage of all caspase substrates, including APP. To determine whether caspase-dependent cleavage of APP is necessary for the increased Aβ generation associated with apoptosis, we expressed APP that was mutagenized at all three major caspase sites (APP Asp720/Asp219/Asp197). CHO cells were transiently transfected with APPWT, APP mutagenized at Asp720, Asp219, and Asp197, or vector alone. 24 h after transfection, apoptosis was induced with etoposide treatment as described above. Secreted total Aβ was measured by ELISA. The amount of total Aβ was comparable in untreated cells indicating, that the APP D720A/D219A/D197A mutations did not affect the production of Aβ under normal conditions (Fig. 5A). As expected, total Aβ was increased in APPWT-treated cells. Cells overexpressing APP D720A/D219A/D197A also showed an increase in total Aβ production following etoposide treatment that was similar to the increase observed with APPWT, i.e. 38 and 34% of untreated cells, respectively (Fig. 5A). The levels of APP expression were comparable for all the different cDNA clones (20 μg of total protein each lane; Fig. 5B). Etoposide treatment induced caspase dependent cleavage of APP at the N-terminal sites in WT but not in the triple mutant as indicated by the detection of APPNcas (WB with 6E10). Caspase cleavage at Asp720 was detected as a decrease in APP-CTF, which was absent in the triple mutant (WB C8). APP-CTFs in the triple mutant migrated faster than WT, most likely because the D720A mutation invokes a change in protein conformation (100 μg total protein each lane; Fig. 5C). The triple caspase site mutations did not affect α- and β-secretase-mediated APP processing (data not shown). Thus, the lack of caspase cleavage at all three major sites did not alter Aβ generation during apoptosis. These findings argue against the premise that caspase-dependent cleavage of APP at Asp720, Asp197, and Asp219 of APP underlies the potentiation of Aβ production observed during apoptosis. We have confirmed previous reports that APP undergoes caspase-dependent cleavage and that total Aβ production is increased during apoptosis. We further showed that apoptosis increases levels of Aβ1-42 in CHO cells. These latter data are particularly interesting in view of the fact that Aβ42 is more prone to aggregate and has been suggested as being the starting point of plaque formation (23Lansbury Jr., P.T. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1151-1154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Aβ42 has been reported as being increased in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid after stroke or head trauma (24Kalaria R.N. Neurobiol. Aging. 2000; 21: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Interestingly, caspase activation has been shown to occur during cerebral ischemia (25Namura S. Zhu J. Fink K. Endres M. Srinivasan A. Tomaselli K.J. Yuan J. Moskowitz M.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3659-3668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and head injury (26Yakovlev A.G. Knoblach S.M. Fan L. Fox G.B. Goodnight R. Faden A.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7415-7424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), both of which increase the risk for AD by possibly representing either precipitating or triggering events. However, it remains unclear how cerebral ischemia predisposes to AD. We hypothesize that caspase activation/apoptosis increases production of Aβ42, consequently triggering and/or exacerbating AD pathology. Thus, identification of the mechanism underlying increased Aβ generation associated with caspase activation/apoptosis could facilitate the treatment and prevention of AD. Gervais et al. (5Gervais F.G. Xu D. Robertson G.S. Vaillancourt J.P. Zhu Y. Huang J. LeBlanc A. Smith D. Rigby M. Shearman M.S. Clarke E.E. Zheng H. Van Der Ploeg L.H. Ruffolo S.C. Thornberry N.A. Xanthoudakis S.

In contrast, we found that the transfection of APPΔC31 in CHO cells led to a dramatic decrease in Aβ. A previous study (27Perez R.G. Soriano S. Hayes J.D. Ostaszewski B. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Chen X. Stokin G.B. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18851-18856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) showed that, in CHO cells, deletion of the cytoplasmic domain of APP or mutagenesis of the internalization motif (NPXY) significantly impaired APP endocytosis and Aβ generation. Because caspase cleavage at Asp720 results in the elimination of the APP internalization motif, this could also explain our findings. Our data are also in agreement with a report by Soriano et al. (28Soriano S. Lu D.C. Chandra S. Pietrzik C.U. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29045-29050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) showing that overexpression of APPΔC31 leads to a decrease in Aβ production in CHO cells. However, these findings contradict results previously reported for rat B103 cells in which Aβ production was increased upon APPΔC31 overexpression (5Gervais F.G. Xu D. Robertson G.S. Vaillancourt J.P. Zhu Y. Huang J. LeBlanc A. Smith D. Rigby M. Shearman M.S. Clarke E.E. Zheng H. Van Der Ploeg L.H. Ruffolo S.C. Thornberry N.A. Xanthoudakis S. Zamboni R.J. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 395-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). These contradictory results could be explained by possible differential APP processing in CHO and B103 cells. In fact, Soriano et al. (28Soriano S. Lu D.C. Chandra S. Pietrzik C.U. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29045-29050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) reported that constitutive APP internalization in B103 cells is less efficient than in CHO cells. In addition, we have shown that the ablation of caspase-dependent cleavage of APP at all three major caspase sites does not alter Aβ generation during apoptosis. These findings argue against the premise that caspase cleavage at Asp720, Asp197, and Asp219 are implicated in the potentiation of Aβ production observed during apoptosis in CHO cells. Other caspase sites in APP have been recently identified and require further investigation. For example, a caspase 6-like site (VKMD) has been identified at Asp653 in the β-secretase region of APP, and it has been shown that the APP Swedish mutation Lys-Met → Asn-Leu improves the likelihood that caspase 6 can cleave at this site. LeBlanc et al. (8LeBlanc A. Liu H. Goodyer C. Bergeron C. Hammond J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23426-23436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) provided evidence that the generation of a 6.5-kDa fragment, generated by cleavage at the β-secretase region and Asp720, precedes the increased production of both secreted and intracellular Aβ in apoptotic neurons and that pharmacological inhibition of caspase 6 activity prevents the increase in Aβ. However, cleavage at Asp653 would generate Aβ starting at position 2, and we did not observe such an Aβ peptide during apoptosis (Koh et al.). 2Y. H. Koh, R. E. Tanzi, and G. Tesco, manuscript in preparation. Nevertheless, it is still possible that caspase-dependent cleavage at other sites may generate caspase-derived fragments that can serve as alternative substrates for the γ-secretase, leading to increased Aβ generation during apoptosis. It is also possible that apoptosis/caspase activation may increase Aβ generation independently of caspase-dependent cleavage of APP. For example, caspase activation can increase Aβ production by potentiating β- and γ-secretase activities. The ultimate elucidation of the biological pathways underlying enhanced Aβ production during apoptosis should aid in the development of novel therapies for the treatment and prevention of AD.

Dennis Selkoe and Weiming Xia for providing us with cell lines and anti-APP antibodies and for carrying out the Aβ ELISA."
https://openalex.org/W2120860069,"Presenilin 1 (PS1) is a critical component of theγ-secretase complex, which is involved in the cleavage of several substrates including the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch1. Based on the fact that APP and Notch are processed by the same γ-secretase, we postulated that APP and Notch compete for the enzyme activity. In this report, we examined the interactions between APP, Notch, and PS1 using the direct γ-secretase substrates, Notch 1 Δextracellular domain (N1ΔEC) and APP carboxyl-terminal fragment of 99 amino acids, and measured the effects on amyloid-β protein production and Notch signaling, respectively. Additionally, we tested the hypothesis that downstream effects on PS1 expression may coexist with the competition phenomenon. We observed significant competition between Notch and APP for γ-secretase activity; transfection with either of two direct substrates of γ-secretase led to a reduction in the γ-cleaved products, Notch intracellular domain or amyloid-β protein. In addition, however, we found that activation of the Notch signaling pathway, by either N1ΔEC or Notch intracellular domain, induced down-regulation of PS1 gene expression. This finding suggests that Notch activation directly engages γ-secretase and subsequently leads to diminished PS1 expression, suggesting a complex set of feedback interactions following Notch activation. Presenilin 1 (PS1) is a critical component of theγ-secretase complex, which is involved in the cleavage of several substrates including the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch1. Based on the fact that APP and Notch are processed by the same γ-secretase, we postulated that APP and Notch compete for the enzyme activity. In this report, we examined the interactions between APP, Notch, and PS1 using the direct γ-secretase substrates, Notch 1 Δextracellular domain (N1ΔEC) and APP carboxyl-terminal fragment of 99 amino acids, and measured the effects on amyloid-β protein production and Notch signaling, respectively. Additionally, we tested the hypothesis that downstream effects on PS1 expression may coexist with the competition phenomenon.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11039-11041Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). It arises from cleavage of a much larger precursor polypeptide, the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), encoded by a gene on human chromosome 21. APP undergoes a proteolytic event by an α-secretase creating a large soluble fragment (α-APPs) and a membrane-retained carboxyl-terminal fragment (CTF) of 83 amino acids (C83). The resultant 10-kDa C83 can be cleaved by a presenilin (PS)-dependent γ-secretase to generate a small fragment called p3 precluding the formation of Aβ. In an analogous fashion, other APP holoproteins can be cleaved by another protease, β-secretase, generating a 12-kDa CTF (or C99) that is cleaved by the same γ-secretase to create Aβ. Although the generation of the different isoforms of Aβ and p3 has been intensively studied, the normal biological function of APP proteolysis remains unclear. Recent data suggest that APP could act as a cell surface receptor that mediates signaling through the release of the APP intracellular domain (AICD) (2Cao X. Sudhof T.C.

Notch receptor is another type I transmembrane receptor that is critically required for a variety of signaling events and cell fate decisions during embryogenesis and in adulthood (4Artavanis-Tsanokas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4909) Google Scholar, 5Fortini M.E. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 673-684Google Scholar). It has been shown that the Notch1 receptor continues to be expressed in the adult brain and inhibits neurite outgrowth in postmitotic neurons (6Berezovska O. Xia M.Q. Hyman B.T. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 57: 738-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 7Berezovska O. McLean P. Knowles R. Frosh M. Lu F.M. Lux S.E. Hyman B.T.

Full-length Notch is cleaved in the presence of its biological ligand Delta, and the generated Notch intracellular domain (NICD) rapidly translocates to the nucleus where it acts as a transcriptional coactivator (9Jack C. Berezovska O. Wolfe M.S. Hyman B.T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 87: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 10Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). Similar to APP proteolysis, Notch undergoes sequential cleavage by α- and PS-dependent γ-secretase-like activities, named S2 and S3 respectively (11De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Schrijvers V. Wolfe M.S. Ray W.J. Goate A. Kopan R. Nature. 1999; 398: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1799) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the same PS-dependent proteolytic complex is involved in the processing of both APP and Notch. Thus, it seems conceivable that the different substrates compete for the same protease. We previously showed that endogenous Notch and APP are competitive substrates for γ-secretase activity; treatment of neurons with the native Notch ligand, Delta, induced a dose-dependent decrease in Aβ production, and overexpression of APP in neurons led to a decrease in Notch signaling (12Berezovska O. Jack C. Deng A. Gastineau N. Rebeck G.W. Hyman B.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30018-30023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, conflicting data were reported by Chen et al. (13Chen F. Yu G. Arawaka S. Nishimura M. Kawarai T. Yu H. Tandon A. Supala A. Song Y.Q. Rogaeva E. Milman P. Sato C. Yu C. Janus C. Lee J.

Bio. 2001; 3: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) using human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells overexpressing either C99 or NotchΔextracellular domain (NΔEC), in which no competition was observed for γ-secretase. In an effort to resolve these apparent conflicts in the present study, we examined the competition between Notch and APP under different circumstances. We postulated that if APP and Notch compete for γ-secretase activity, competition should only be observed with active Notch constructs that require a PS1-dependent cleavage, such as the truncated form NΔEC, but not with constructs that do not require this cleavage, such as NICD, or with forms that require ligand binding for its activation, such as full-length Notch. In this report, we extend the previous findings and show that transfection with either of two direct substrates of γ-secretase, C99 or NΔEC, lead to a reduction in the γ-cleaved products (NICD or Aβ respectively). However, surprisingly, we found that NICD also decreased Aβ production from C99. We found that this decrease in Aβ was associated with a down-regulation in the expression of PS1 gene at both the transcriptional and protein levels. Plasmids—Full-length Notch1 (N1FL) and two truncated forms of Notch1 (NΔEC and NICD) cloned into pBos vectors (generous gift of Gerry Weinmaster, UCLA), were used in the transfection experiments. NΔEC contains the cytoplasmic portion and the membrane-spanning region of the molecule (5374–7836 bp), and NICD contains the active signaling portion of the Notch1 molecule (5476–7836 bp) (9Jack C. Berezovska O. Wolfe M.S. Hyman B.T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 87: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 14Berezovska O. Frosch M. McLean P. Knowles R. Koo E. Kang D. Shen J.

A. 1996; 93: 5663-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with human full-length APP or with a deletion mutant containing only the C99 cloned into a pSecTag2B vector (Invitrogen) (16Kinoshita A. Whelan C.M. Smith C.J. Mikhailenko I. Rebeck G.W. Strickland D.K. Hyman B.T. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8354-8361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and with β-galactosidase as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Transfection with an empty pBos vector served as a negative control for each experiment. Cell Culture Conditions and Transient Transfection—N2a mouse neuroblastoma or HEK293 cells were cultured in OPTI-MEMI with 5% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a tissue culture incubator. Transient transfection was performed using Superfect reagents (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were plated onto 12-well plates 1 day before transfection. The day of transfection, 1.5 μg of plasmid DNA was dissolved in 75 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and 7.5 μl of Superfect reagent was added. The mixture was left for 5–10 min at room temperature, and 400 μl of growth medium was added to the mixture. Then, 475 μl of this mixture was added to each well. After 2 h, cells were washed with PBS, and growth medium was added to cells. Fe65-dependent APP Luciferase Transactivation Assay—HEK cells were cotransfected with the APP-Gal4 construct (a generous gift from Dr. Thomas Südhof, Univ. of Texas Southwestern Medical Center), which was cloned from APP 695 with the Gal4 sequence spliced into the cytoplasmic tail, in conjunction with pG5E1B-luc, a luciferase reporter plasmid with a Gal4 activation-dependent binding domain and Fe65 (2Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). The generation of Fe65 with a C-terminal myc tag has been reported elsewhere (17Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). CBF1 Luciferase Assay—The CBF1-luciferase assay was performed as described previously (18Berezovska O. Jack C. McLean P. Aster J.C. Hicks C. Xia W. Wolfe M.S. Kimberly W.T. Weinmaster G. Selkoe D.J. Hyman B.T. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transfected with a CBF1 luciferase reporter plasmid (19Hsieh J.J. Henkel T. Salmon P. Robey E. Peterson M.G. Hayward S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 952-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) and β-galactosidase as an internal control for transfection efficiency. The assay was performed 24 h after transfection using an LKB 1251 luminometer, and results were normalized to β-galactosidase expression levels. ELISA and Western Blots—For Aβ ELISA, we used 500 μl of conditioned medium collected 24 h after transfection. The capture antibody was BNT77 (directed against Aβ11–28), and the detection antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated BA27 for Aβ40 (directed against Aβ1–40) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated BC05 for Aβ42 (directed against Aβ35–43) (20Asami-Odaka A. Ishibashi Y. Kikuchi T. Kitada C. Suzuki N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10272-10278Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The antibodies were a generous gift of Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Japan. For the Western blot analysis, the cell lysates were adjusted to equal protein concentrations and electrophoresed in 10–20% SDS-polyacrylamide Tris-glycine gels for PS1 expression. The immunoblotting was performed with the PS1 loop antibody (1:300, Chemicon), mouse actin (1:500), and APP C8 antibody (1:500, a gift of D. J. Selkoe), followed by detection with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Bands on films were quantitated using Odyssey software (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE), and the values were normalized to actin expression. RNA Extraction and Real-time Quantitative PCR—RNA was extracted from cells 24 h after transfection using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), chloroform, and precipitated with isopropyl alcohol. RNA was purified using the RNeasy mini-kit (Qiagen), and 5 μg of total RNA was used to synthesize cDNA in a 20-μl reaction using the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for reverse transcriptase-PCR (Invitrogen). Mouse PS1 gene was amplified by using the primers 5′-ATCTAAGGCACAGGCCCGA-3′ and 5′-TTGGTAAGGCCTCAGCAACC-3′. GAPDH was used as an internal control gene to normalize for the amount of RNA. Real-time PCR was performed in an iCycler iQ Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad). 1 μl of cDNA was added to 25 μl of SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Each sample was run in triplicate, and analysis of relative gene expression was done by using the 2—ΔΔCt method (21Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124358) Google Scholar). Briefly, the relative change in gene expression is calculated by subtracting the threshold cycle (ΔCt) of the target gene (PS1) from the internal control gene (GAPDH). Based on the fact that the amount of cDNA doubles in each PCR cycle (assuming a PCR efficiency of 100%), the final fold-change in gene expression is calculated by using the following formula: relative change = 2——ΔΔCt (21Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124358) Google Scholar). APP C99, a Direct Substrate for γ-Secretase, Decreases Notch Signaling—We postulated that if APP and Notch compete for γ-secretase, we should observe a reduction in Notch signaling after transfection with APP C99. HEK cells were cotransfected with NΔEC and APP C99 or an empty vector; CBF1 luciferase activity in the lysates was measured 24 h after transfection as a measure of Notch signaling. The results were normalized to β-galactosidase expression levels. We observed a marked reduction (63%, p = 0.01) in CBF1 luciferase activity in cells transfected with APP C99 compared with empty vector (Fig. 1). A statistically significant reduction (compared with an empty vector) in the endogenous Notch signaling was also seen in cells transfected with C99 without activating the Notch pathway with NΔEC (data not shown). Transfection with Activated Notch Constructs Leads to a Decrease in Aβ Production—To test the hypothesis that Notch1 and APP are competitive substrates, we transfected N2a cells with N1FL and the two truncated forms of Notch1 (NΔEC and NICD) and measured Aβ production using ELISA in the conditioned media 24 h after transfection. We reasoned that, in the absence of ligand, N1FL would have minimal effect, that NΔEC, the truncated membrane-bound form of Notch that requires PS1-dependent cleavage, would lead to a reduction in Aβ levels if it competed with APP for γ-secretase, and that NICD, which does not require γ-secretase, would not alter Aβ levels. N1FL had only a small effect on Aβ production, perhaps because of activation by endogenous ligands (Table I). However, both truncated forms of Notch (NΔEC and NICD) led to a decrease in Aβ production.Table ITransfection with activated Notch constructs leads to a decrease in Aβ productionConditionnaTotal number of wells for each condition.Aβ40 meanp Compared to empty vectorAβ42 meanp Compared to empty vectorEmpty46100-100-N1FL1792.9nsbns, not significant.104.6nsNΔEC5181.4p < 0.00177.5p < 0.001NICD5186.6p < 0.00181.6p < 0.001a Total number of wells for each condition.b ns, not significant. Open table in a new tab We also examined the effects of cotransfecting the direct substrate NΔEC on the ability of APP-Gal4 to be cleaved by γ-secretase, releasing the Gal4-AICD fragment which activates a Gal4-dependent, artificially expressed luciferase plasmid (2Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the presence of the Fe65 adaptor protein is a requisite for the stabilization of the AICD fragment and its subsequent nuclear translocation for luciferase activation (2Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar, 22Kinoshita A. Whelan C.M. Smith C.J. Berezovska O. Hyman B.T. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To readily test any competitive effects of NΔEC on downstream activation by APP-Gal4, we cotransfected HEK cells with APP-Gal4, pG5E1B-luc, Fe65, and NΔEC or an empty vector. We observed an expected increase in the ability of APP-Gal4 to stimulate transcription when Fe65 is cotransfected, as compared with an empty vector control (Fig. 2). In addition, we found that NΔEC attenuated this phenomenon, decreasing the downstream signaling effects of the Fe65-stabilized AICD generated from the artificially expressed Gal4-dependent luciferase reporter plasmid. This finding is consistent with the reduction in Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels observed after transfection with NΔEC. To confirm that Notch1 signaling was indeed activated by the transfection with the truncated forms of Notch, we measured activation of a Notch downstream transcription factor, C-promoter binding factor 1 (CBF1), in the cell lysates. We cotransfected N2a cells with a CBF1 luciferase reporter construct (18Berezovska O. Jack C. McLean P. Aster J.C. Hicks C. Xia W. Wolfe M.S. Kimberly W.T. Weinmaster G. Selkoe D.J. Hyman B.T. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 19Hsieh J.J. Henkel T. Salmon P. Robey E. Peterson M.G. Hayward S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 952-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) and β-galactosidase as an internal control for transfection efficiency, and we measured luminescence 24 h after transfection. As expected, we found that NICD and NΔEC led to a robust increase in CBF1 luciferase activity in comparison to an empty vector (Fig. 3A). Next, we examined whether the decrease in Aβ secretion after transfection with truncated Notch1 constructs was due to any effects of the transfection on APP expression or processing. We performed Western blot analysis of cell lysates transfected with empty vector, NΔEC, or NICD for full-length APP expression and APP CTFs generation. Although after quantification we did not detect any significant change in the expression of any of these fragments, we observed a small non-significant increase in the expression of the APP CTFs after transfection with NΔEC (110.3% compared with an empty vector, Fig. 3B). Truncated Notch1 Constructs Induced Down-regulation of the Presenilin 1 Gene—We tested the hypothesis that the unexpected effects on Aβ secretion produced by NICD, which does not require PS1-dependent cleavage, were associated with changes in PS1 expression. RNA was extracted from N2a cells transfected with NΔEC, NICD, or an empty vector, and the expression of endogenous PS1 gene and GAPDH as a control gene were analyzed by using quantitative real-time PCR. We found that NICD and, to a lesser extent, NΔEC down-regulated the expression of the endogenous PS1 gene (Table II). Transfection with NICD and NΔEC was associated with an ∼40 and ∼20% reduction in PS1 expression, respectively. To investigate whether other γ-secretase substrates also have an effect on gene expression, we analyzed PS1 expression in N2a cells transfected with another direct substrate, C99. However, we did not observe a significant change compared with an empty vector.Table IITransfection with NICD downregulates endogenous PS1 gene expressionConditionChange in expression (mean ± SD)p valueEmpty vector (N = 5)100-NΔEC (n = 5)83 ± 18nsans, not significant.NICD (n = 5)58 ± 13<0.01C99 (n = 3)131 ± 35nsa ns, not significant. Open table in a new tab Finally, we examined the expression of endogenous PS1 at the protein level after transfection with Notch1 constructs. Western blot analysis of the cell lysates for endogenous PS1 expression showed that both NΔEC and NICD were associated with a reduction in PS1 CTF expression compared with transfection with an empty vector (Fig. 4, A and B). In accordance with the quantitative PCR results, we failed to observe a change in PS1 protein expression in cells transfected with C99. We showed previously that activation of endogenous Notch in primary neurons with Delta ligand caused a dose-dependent decrease in total Aβ secretion (12Berezovska O. Jack C. Deng A. Gastineau N. Rebeck G.W. Hyman B.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30018-30023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the opposite experiment confirmed that overexpression of APP in neuronal cultures derived from APP695Sw-overexpressing mice led to a reduction in Notch signaling assessed by a CBF1 luciferase transcription assay and by analysis of Notch C-terminal nuclear translocation in vitro and in vivo (12Berezovska O.

However, there are apparent differences in the cleavage site and sequence specificity between APP and Notch, which suggests the possibility of different cleaving enzymes (23Sastre M. Steiner H.

Diehl T. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), using an in vitro γ-secretase activity assay that cleaves both Notch- and APP-based substrates, showed that these substrates prevented each other's cleavage, which strongly suggests that the same γ-secretase complex is responsible for the processing of both substrates. The existence of multiple substrates that are cleaved by the same γ-secretase raises the possibility of competition among them for the enzymatic activity. However, there are conflicting reports regarding this issue. For instance, Chen et al. (13Chen F. Yu G. Arawaka S. Nishimura M. Kawarai T. Yu H. Tandon A. Supala A. Song Y.Q. Rogaeva E. Milman P. Sato C. Yu C. Janus C. Lee J. Song L. Zhang L. Fraser P.E. St George-Hyslop P.H. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2001; 3: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) did not observe competition between Notch and APP for γ-secretase in HEK cells transfected with NΔEC. To examine this issue in greater depth and to extend our previous studies, we analyzed the effect of the immediate γ-secretase substrates (NΔEC and C99) on Aβ production and Notch signaling. We found that transfection of cells with direct γ-secretase substrates led to a decrease in the formation of the γ-cleaved products from the alternative substrate. Transfection with C99, the direct substrate of γ-secretase, induced a marked reduction in Notch signaling, assessed by a CBF1 luciferase transcription assay. On the other hand, transfection of cells with NΔEC, a truncated form of Notch that requires a γ-secretase cleavage, induced a significant decrease in Aβ production measured with a sensitive and specific sandwich ELISA and in APP-Gal4 transcriptional activation. The effects on Aβ were not due to a change in APP expression, although a small nonsignificant increase in APP CTFs was seen after transfection with NΔEC. These results confirm and extend the idea that, under several different experimental conditions in intact cells, substrates compete with each other for γ-secretase. However, we also unexpectedly observed that transfection with NICD, the active signaling portion of the Notch1 molecule that does not require γ-cleavage, also down-regulated Aβ production. This decrease was consistent and associated with an ∼40% down-regulation in endogenous PS1 gene expression detectable at both the transcriptional and the protein level. However, we cannot readily demonstrate whether the knock-down of the PS1 gene is responsible for the decrease in Aβ seen in our experiments. The effects of knocking-down presenilin 1 have been evaluated by obtaining lines heterozygous for PS1 (±) (26De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G. Annaert W.

However, in an in vitro Aβ generation assay, knock-down of PS1 using RNA interference led to an almost complete abolition of Aβ production (31Takasugi N. Tomita T. Hayashi I. Tsuruoka M. Niimura M.

Although the effects of knocking down PS1 remain uncertain, our results suggest that the Notch pathway exerts some control on PS1 gene regulation that may ultimately affect APP processing. It will be interesting to learn if NICD also regulates other components of the γ-secretase complex. These data suggest that two types of phenomenon coexist in the regulation of γ-secretase, competition between substrates and downstream effects on gene regulation. These results depict a novel and more complex feedback relationship between γ-secretase and its substrates."

We here report on the combined transcriptional and translational regulatory mechanisms controlling the expression of the Léri-Weill and Turner syndrome gene SHOX. We define an alternative promotor within exon 2 of the SHOX gene by transient transfections of mono- and bicistronic reporter constructs and demonstrate substantial differences in the translation efficiency of the mRNAs transcribed from these alternative promotors by in vitro translation assays and direct mRNA transfections into different cell lines. Although transcripts generated from the intragenic promotor (P2) are translated with high efficiencies, mRNA originating from the upstream promotor (P1) exhibit significant translation inhibitory effects due to seven AUG codons upstream of the main open reading frame (uAUGs). Site-directed mutagenesis of these uAUGs confers full translation efficiency to reporter mRNAs in different cell lines and after injection of Xenopus embryos.

The human pseudoautosomal homeobox gene SHOX has recently been shown to encode a cell type-specific transcription factor involved in cell cycle and growth regulation (1Rao E. Blaschke R.J.

SHOX-deficient individuals exhibit a considerable phenotypic heterogeneity ranging from mild, barely detectable skeletal malformations to severe dysplasia adversely affecting the life of these patients (7Blaschke R.J.

This phenotypic heterogeneity is clinically well documented but not understood on a molecular level. Although dominant negative effects of mutated gene products have been discussed (1Rao E. Blaschke R.J. Marchini A. Niesler B. Burnett M. Rappold G.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 3083-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), phenotypes caused by complete gene deletions argue for a quantitative threshold of functional protein to be necessary for normal development. Along these lines, the understanding of mechanisms regulating the level of functional protein will provide important clues to explain the SHOX-related phenotypes and their inherent phenotypic heterogeneity.Although initially transcriptional regulation has been correlated with a variety of human diseases, it has become increasingly clear that post-transcriptional processing and differential translation represent equally important checkpoints in the tissue-specific and disease-related control of gene expression (9Kozak M. Mamm. Genome. 2002; 13: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 10Calkhoven C.F. Muller C. Leutz A. Trends Mol.

Among the various elements of mature mRNAs that are known to regulate translational efficiency, several recent investigations have emphasized the role of the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) 2The abbreviations used are: UTRuntranslated regionIRESinternal ribosomal entry sites.2The abbreviations used are: UTRuntranslated regionIRESinternal ribosomal entry sites. as major determinant controlling the initial steps of protein expression (12Mendell J.T.

J. 2002; 367: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Most eukaryotic mRNAs that exhibit high translational competence present themselves with short, 5′-m7GpppN (7-methylguanosine) cap containing UTRs that lack highly organized secondary structures. In contrast, several tightly regulated proteins including proto-oncogene products, growth factors, and their receptors as well as homeodomain proteins are encoded by mRNAs with long, complex 5′-UTRs with considerable secondary structures and multiple AUG codons upstream of the main open reading frame. Because these features interfere with the rate-limiting initial steps of the canonical cap-dependent translation mechanism and subsequent ribosomal scanning of the 5′-mRNA leader, they represent key indicators of mRNAs regulated on a translational level (14Davuluri R.V. Suzuki Y. Sugano S. Zhang M.Q. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1807-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In addition, these structural hallmarks have evoked and fueled a lively discussion about the capability of several cellular mRNAs to promote cap-independent translation by direct recruitment of ribosomes to internal ribosomal entry sites (IRES) (15Vagner S. Galy B. Pyronnet S. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 16Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1899-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 17Schneider R.

Biol. 2002; 22: 7372-7384Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).We investigated the structural and functional properties of the 5′-UTR of the SHOX mRNA by computational, in vitro, cell culture based and in vivo analyses. In vitro and cell culture studies demonstrated an alternative intragenic promotor within exon 2 of the SHOX gene. Because this dual promotor structure leads to alternative mRNAs with different 5′ leaders, we analyzed and compared the translational efficiency of the two UTRs by direct RNA transfection assays. Here we provide evidence that the different 5′-UTRs exhibit differential translation efficiencies due to cell type-dependent inhibitory elements within the long SHOX mRNA variant. We finally integrate this data to propose a combinatorial model that takes into account transcriptional and translational mechanisms regulating the amount of functional SHOX protein.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Constructs—The complete 5′-UTR of the SHOX mRNA was assembled from two genomic PCR fragments representing exon 1 and the SHOX non-coding portion of exon 2. PCRs were carried out with the HotProof polymerase system (Qiagen) using the following primers: Ex1for(SpeI), 5′-GGACTAGTCGCCTGCTTTTGCCCGGGTCCTGAG AA-3′; Ex1rev, 5′-CAAGCTCTGAGCGCAGGCCCCGAG-3′; Ex2for, 5′-GAAAACTGGAG TTGCTTTTCCTCCGG-3′; and Ex2rev(EcoRI), 5′-CGGAATTCCATGGCTGGGGCCGGGGC-3′. Both PCR fragments were digested with SpeI and EcoRI, respectively, cloned into a SpeI/EcoRIrestricted pBluescript plasmid (Stratagene), and sequence verified. All UTR-containing clones were derived from this plasmid (pBSK/SHOX-UTR). The expression constructs pHPL/UTR and pRF/UTR were generated by subcloning the complete SHOX 5′-UTR fragment from pBSK/SHOX-UTR via SpeI/NcoI into the respective parental vectors (19Stoneley M. Paulin F.E. Le Quesne J.P. Chappell S.A. Willis A.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar).Nested deletions of the SHOX 5′-UTR were obtained from pBSK/SHOX-UTR by PCR using the following forward primers: Ex2for(SpeI), 5′-GGACTAGTGAAAA CTGGAGTTTGCTTTTCCTCC-3′; Ex2Δ1for(SpeI), 5′-GGACTAGTAGGTGTACGGACGC CAAACAGT-3′; Ex2Δ2for-(SpeI), 5′-GGACTAGTCGGAGACCAGTAATTGCACCAGA-3′; and Ex2Δ3for(SpeI), 5′-GGACTACAGCGCTGGTGATCCACCCGCGCG-3′ in combination with the Ex2rev(EcoRI) oligo. Resulting PCR fragments were digested with SpeI/EcoRI, and cloned into pBluescript. The plasmid constructs pUTR-Luc, pEx2-Luc, pEx2Δ1-Luc, pEx2Δ2-Luc, and pEx2Δ3-Luc were generated by introducing an NcoI/SalI fragment containing the firefly luciferase coding cassette from the commercially available pGL3 vector (Promega) into the appropriately digested pBSK/UTR containing vectors.The plasmids pBSK/UTR-Xnoggin, pBSK/Ex2Δ3-Xnoggin, and pBSK/UTR-AUGm1–7-Xnoggin were generated by substituting the firefly coding sequence of the constructs pBSK/UTR-Luc, pBSK/Ex2Δ3-Luc and pBSK/UTR-AUGm1–7 by a noggin PCR fragment generated with the following primers: Xnoggin-for, 5′-GGCCATGGATCATTCCCAGTG CCTTGT-3′ and Xnoggin-rev, 5′-GGGTCTAGATCAATGATGATGATGATGATGGCATG AGCATTGCACTCGGAAATGACA-3′. The PCR fragment was cloned via NcoI/XbaI.Site-directed Mutagenesis—Upstream AUGs within the SHOX 5′-UTR were mutated using the QuikChange® Multi site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the procedure recommended by the supplier (Stratagene). Individual mutations were introduced into pBSK/SHOX-UTR with the following primers: uAUG1-mut, 5′-CTACTGCAAACAGA ATTGGGAGGGTGGACAGGCG-3′; uAUG2-mut, 5′-GACGCCAGGACGCGATTGAACCT CCGGGGCG-3′; uAUG3-mut, 5′-CCCTTCCAAAATTGGGATCTTTCCCC-3′; uAUG4/5-mut, 5′-GGACGCCAAACAGTGTTGAATTGAGAAGAAA GCCAATTGCCGG-3′; uAUG6-mut, 5′-CAGACAGGCAGCGCTTGGGGGGCTGGGC-3′; and uAUG7-mut, 5′-TAGTGAGATTTCC ATTGGAAAGGCGTAAAT-3′ resulting in the plasmids pBSK/UTR-AUGm1, pBSK/UTR-AUGm2, pBSK/UTR-AUGm3, pBSK/UTR-AUGm4/5, pBSK/UTR-AUGm6, and pBSK/UTR-AUGm7. The construct pBSK/UTR-AUGm1–7 combining mutations in all seven uAUGs was generated by mutating uAUG2 and uAUGs4/5, AUG6, and AUG7 of pBSK/UTR-AUGm1 and pBSK/UTR-AUGm3, respectively. The 5′ portion of pBSK/UTR-AUGm3–7 was subsequently exchanged for an SpeI/NarI fragment of pBSK/UTR-AUGm1–2 harboring mutations of uAUG1 and uAUG2. All mutations were verified by bidirectional sequence analysis and subcloned into pBSK/UTR-Luc via SpeI/NcoI.Cell Culture, DNA Transfections, and Luciferase Assays—U2Os, HEK293, and COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/2 mm glutamine (PAA Laboratories) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (PAA Laboratories), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. On the day of transfection, cells were splitted into 24-well plates (for luciferase assays) or 10-cm dishes (for RNA isolation) to a confluency of 50–60%. All cells were transfected with a 1:6 DNA/FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science) ratio using 100 ng of plasmid DNA per 500 μl of cell culture medium. For luciferase assays the cells were lysed 36 h after transfection with 100 μl/well of Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) for 15 min at room temperature and frozen at –80 °C for one hour. 10 μl of each cell lysate were assayed for Renilla and firefly luciferase activity with a dual injector 96-well plate luminometer (anthos) using the Dual-Luciferase® reporter assay system (Promega) as recommended by the manufacturer. All assays were performed at least three times and in triplicate.In Vitro RNA Synthesis and in Vitro Translation—Synthetic mRNAs were generated from various SHOX-UTR-Luciferase fusion constructs using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE™ or MEGAscript™ reaction systems (Ambion) according to the supplier's recommendations. Briefly, 1 μg of plasmid DNA linearized with XhoI were in vitro-transcribed with T3 polymerase in the presence of 6 mm CAP analog (m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G or A(5′)ppp(5′)G). The resulting mRNAs were digested with DNase I for 15 min at 37 °C, purified by column chromatography (Ambion), and analyzed on a formaldehyd containing 1% agarose gel. Purified mRNAs were photometrically analyzed and quantitated according to standard procedures. These synthetic mRNAs were used to prime in vitro translation reactions carried out with the Rabbit Reticulo Lysate System (Promega) according to the protocol provided. All reactions contained 1 μg of mRNA and 35 μl of nuclease-treated reticulo lysate in a final volume of 50 μl. 5 μl were withdrawn from this reaction in 10 min intervals, combined with an equal volume of 2× Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega), and firefly luciferase activity was determined as described above. Alternatively, pHPL- and pRF-derived plasmids were linearized with XhoI, column-purified (Qiagen), and directly used to prime coupled in vitro transcription/translation reactions (TNT) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega).RNA Transfection and Quantitation of Translation Efficiency—Synthetic mRNAs generated with the mMESSAGE mMACHINE™ or MEGAscript™ reaction systems (Ambion) were directly transfected into different cell lines using 2 μg RNA and 8 μl of TransMessenger™ Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) per well of a 6-well plate. Transfection procedure was carried out following the recommendations of the supplier. Transfected cells were trypsinized, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 200 μl phosphate-buffered saline. 40 μl of this cell suspension were mixed with 10 μl of 5× Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) and directly used for Luciferase assays. The remaining 160 μl of the cell suspension were used for isolation of total RNA by standard procedures (Qiagen). 1 μg aliquots of total RNA were reverse transcribed and analyzed by quantitative real time RT-PCR amplification with the FastStart reaction system (Roche Applied Science) in a LightCycler® instrument (Roche Applied Science) using the following primers: Luc1for, 5′-GGAGAGCAACT GCATAAGGC-3′, and Luc1rev, 5′-CATCGACTGAAATCCCTGGT-3′. The reactions contained 60 nmol MgSO4 in a final volume of 20 μl and were carried out under the following conditions: 95 °C/10 min; (95 °C/15 s, 60 °C/5 s, 72 °C/15 s)35X. Luciferase activities were corrected for RNA transfection efficiencies with the results from real time PCRs.Injection of Xenopus Embryos and Phenotype Evaluation—Eggs were obtained from Xenopus females injected with 300–400 units of human chorionic gonadotropin (Serva) and fertilized in vitro. The jelly coat was removed using a 2% cysteine solution (pH 8.0), and the embryos were microinjected in 1× MBS-H (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.33 mm Ca(NO3)2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 μg/ml streptomycinsulfate, and 10 μg/ml penicillin) and cultured in 0.1× MBS-H. The embryos were staged according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (20Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis (Daudin). North Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam1967Google Scholar). Embryos were injected with mRNAs at the 4–8 cell stage into two ventral blastomeres with 5–10 nl of mRNA solutions. Embryos were then transferred to 0.1× MBS-H for cultivation up to tailbud stages (NF 33–35).RESULTSStructural Features of the SHOX 5′-UTR—The SHOXa and SHOXb mRNAs (accession numbers NM_000451 and NM_006883) share a complex 5′-untranslated region encoded by two exons joined via canonical donor-acceptor splice sites. This 5′-UTR comprises 694 nucleotides and exhibits an inconspicuous GC content of 63%. Beyond its over average length, however, it exhibits several unusual features. First, it contains a terminal oligopyrimidine tract of 12 nucleotides (TOP) and 7 AUG codons upstream of the major open reading frame (uAUGs). The environment of these uAUGs ranges between 44 and 67% identity to Kozak's consensus sequence (A/G)CC(A/G)CCAUGG (21Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3565) Google Scholar, 22Peri S. Pandey A. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 685-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) with uAUG1 and uAUG3 complying with the –3(A/G)/+4G rule for favorable translation initiation (23Kozak M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2482-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). All uAUGs are associated with open reading frames (uORFs) putatively encoding peptides with sizes between 2 and 29 amino acids, none of which exhibits any significant homologies to known peptides (Fig. 1). Second, predictions of its secondary structure using the mfold 3.1 algorithm (24Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 911-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (3198) Google Scholar) reveals an exceptionally strong folding of this 5′-UTR with a Gibbs free energy of ΔG = –282 kcal/mol for the most stable configuration. The individual stem loops, potentially interfering with ribosomal scanning (25Kozak M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8301-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), exhibit free energies in the range of ΔG = –11.2 to –24.2 kcal/mol. The capacity to form extraordinary stable secondary structures, the terminal oligopyrimidine tract, and the presence of multiple uAUGs strongly suggest regulatory properties of this 5′-UTR related to the control of SHOX gene expression on a translational level.Exon 2 of the SHOX Gene Harbors Alternative Promotor Activities—The calculated high degree of folding is indicative for IRES (15Vagner S. Galy B. Pyronnet S. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and has prompted us to first analyze the SHOX 5′-UTR translational activity by transfection assays using the reporter constructs pHPL/UTR and pRF/UTR (Fig. 2A). In pHPL a stable hairpin at the 5′-end of the SV40-driven transcription unit represses translation of a firefly luciferase encoding mRNA generated from the parental vector (19Stoneley M. Paulin F.E. Le Quesne J.P. Chappell S.A. Willis A.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, the SHOX 5′-UTR is able to rescue this reporter gene expression if inserted between the 5′ hairpin structure and the firefly luciferase encoding sequence. Within different cell lines, the observed up-regulation varies between 25-fold (HEK293), 72-fold (COS7), and 95-fold in U2Os cells over wild type pHPL activity (data not shown). Also, the SHOX 5′-UTR up-regulates protein expression from the downstream reporter when inserted between the sea pansy (Renilla reniformis) and firefly encoding sequences of the bicistronic reporter vector pRF (Fig. 2, A and B).Fig. 2Exon 2 of theSHOXgene contains alternative promotor elements.A, constructs used for transient cell transfection assays. B, luciferase activities measured after transient transfections of pHPL, pHPL/UTR, pRF, and pRF/UTR into U2Os cells. The SHOX 5′-UTR is able to rescue reporter expression of pHPL and promote expression of the downstream (Firefly) reporter unit of the bicistronic vector pRF. C, Northern-blot analysis of total RNA from U2Os cells transfected with the plasmids constructs indicated on top. The strong signal in pHPL/UTR-transfected cells and the monocistronic transcript detected in RNA from cells transfected with pRF/UTR disclose a transcriptional start event within the SHOX 5′-UTR. GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. D, luciferase activities of plasmid constructs indicated on the left. The strongest promotor activity is observed with a fragment that contains 298 bp preceding the SHOX AUG start codon. Negative regulatory elements reside between –498 and –298. Numbers indicate the length of the genomic fragments relative to the SHOX AUG start codon.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In contrast to this remarkable up-regulation in cell culture-based assays, we did not detect any expression enhancing effects of the SHOX 5′-UTR in vitro, using pRF/UTR primed coupled TNT assays (data not shown). This prima facie discrepancy between cell culture-based and in vitro-derived results can be explained by the absence of cell-specific factors necessary for IRES utilization or the presence of intrinsic promotor elements that remain undetectable in T3 polymerase-driven in vitro TNT reactions. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we analyzed total RNA preparations from cells transfected with pHPL, pRF, and the corresponding 5′-UTR containing constructs. As shown by Northern blot analysis, all transfections yield RNAs complying in size with the expected SV40-driven transcription (Fig. 2C). However, we observed a significantly higher steady state level of firefly luciferase RNA in pHPL/UTR-transfected cells as compared with cells transfected with the parental plasmid (Fig. 2C, pHPL). The size of this transcript furthermore suggests a transcriptional start point about 600 bp downstream of the SV40 promotor within the SHOX 5′-UTR. In agreement with this interpretation, we detected a second firefly luciferase encoding RNA in pRF/UTR, but not in pRF-transfected cells corresponding in size to a monocistronic mRNA that originates from a transcription initiation event within the intercistronic SHOX 5′-UTR fragment (Fig. 2C, pRF). Both results clearly disfavor internal ribosomal entry underlying the observed up-regulation of reporter activity, but rather point to transcriptional initiation within the SHOX 5′-UTR. To corroborate the hypothesis of an alternative promotor, we generated the plasmid constructs pEX2-Luc, pEX2Δ1-Luc, pEX2Δ2-Luc, and pEX2Δ3-Luc by fusing different portions of genomic DNA residing upstream of the SHOX AUG start codon to a firefly luciferase reporter unit (Fig. 2D). Luciferase assays using extracts from cells transiently transfected with these plasmids confirmed transcription-promoting functions with the highest activity observed within a fragment of 298 bp directly preceding the SHOX AUG start codon (Fig. 2D).In conclusion, these results demonstrate that the SHOX gene is transcribed from at least two alternative promotors (P1 and P2) generating distinct mRNAs that encode identical proteins, but vary in their 5′-UTR sequences. These transcripts are hereafter referred to as type 1 and type 2 transcripts, respectively.The SHOX 5′-UTRs Differentially Regulate Translation Efficiency—As the promotor activity within exon 2 of the SHOX gene interferes with DNA transfection experiments, all subsequent analyses were directly based on in vitro generated mRNAs. To address the mechanism by which the two SHOX mRNA variants are translated, we generated in vitro transcripts from pBSK/UTR-Luc (type 1 mRNA) and pBSK/EX2Δ3-Luc (type 2 mRNA) in the presence of either a generic CAP analog (m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G; G-CAP) or an unmethylated variant (A(5′)ppp(5′)G; A-CAP) interfering with CAP-dependent translation initiation. The results from in vitro translation assays primed with these transcripts are shown in Fig. 3B. Although type 1 transcripts are translated at very low levels independently of the CAP structure, the unmethylated A-CAP substantially interferes with the high translation efficiency of type 2 variant. These results suggest that both type 1 and 2 transcripts do not support internal ribosomal entry, but require a CAP-dependent mechanism of translation initiation. Furthermore, they uncover considerable differences in translation competence between the 5′-UTRs of type 1 and type 2 transcripts. We next analyzed nested deletions of the type 1 SHOX 5′-UTR (Fig. 3A) by in vitro translation assays. As shown in Fig. 3C, translation efficiencies are indeed inversely related to the length of the 5′-UTR with an 85-fold difference between type 1 and type 2 variants. To confirm this in vitro-derived data in living cells, we transfected these mRNAs and quantitated their translational efficiency. As expected, we observed the same inverse correlation between length and translation activities in the osteogenic cell line U2Os (Fig. 3D). We next transfected the same in vitro generated mRNAs into different cell lines and determined their translational competence (Fig. 3E). Interestingly, this analysis not only confirms the translation-attenuating properties of the long 5′-UTR variant but also suggests some cell line-dependent responsiveness to the translation inhibitory elements presented by the different forms of the SHOX 5′-UTR (Fig. 3E). Taken together, these results provide compelling evidence that type 1 and type 2 transcripts generated from the alternative promotors P1 and P2 exhibit differential translation efficiencies due to inhibitory elements within the long SHOX 5′-UTR variant.Fig. 3The SHOX 5′-UTRs are differentially translated.A, schematic representation and gelelectrophoretic analysis of mRNAs transcribed in vitro from the plasmid constructs pUTR-Luc, pEX2-Luc, pEX2Δ1-Luc, pEX2Δ2-Luc, and pEX2Δ3-Luc. The structures of these constructs are diagrammatically shown in Fig. 2D. The free energies for the individual 5′-UTRs were predicted with the mfold 3.1 algorithm (bioinfo.math.rpi.edu). B, in vitro translation activity of type 1 and 2 5′-UTRs containing either a m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G (G-CAP) or an A(5′)ppp(5′)G (A-CAP). Although type 1 UTRs are translated with very low efficiencies, the A-CAP dramatically reduces the activity of the type 2 5′-UTR variant. C, in vitro translation activity of the nestedly deleted 5′-UTRs depicted in A. Luciferase activities are given in a logarithmic scale. D, translation efficiency of the same mRNAs in U2Os cells. Luciferase activity was measured in extracts from cells transfected with the in vitro transcribed mRNAs and corrected for RNA transfection efficiency by quantitative RT-PCR. Translational activity is inversely correlated with the length of the SHOX 5′-UTR. E, comparison of the translation efficiency in different cell lines. The activity of the short UTR form (EX2Δ3) was set to 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Upstream AUG Codons within the SHOX 5′-UTR Inhibit Translation in Vitro and in Vivo—Because the use of nested 5′ deletions does not allow to discriminate structural effects from the influence of uAUGs within the SHOX 5′-UTR, we generated constructs harboring mutations of individual uAUGs or different combinations thereof. In vitro transcription of these constructs yield mRNAs identical in size and with similar overall structural features of their 5′-UTRs (Fig. 4, A and B). These in vitro transcripts were directly transfected into U2Os cells and their translation efficiency determined. As shown in Fig. 4B, mutation of all seven uAUGs within type 1 transcripts yields translational activities comparable with the high efficiency of type 2 mRNAs. Therefore, we can exclude length and overall structure, but rather define the uAUGs as critical determinants for the observed translational down-regulation. We next investigated if this effect can be attributed to individual uAUGs by transfection of reporter RNAs harboring individual uAUG mutations. We can show that none of the individual mutations is able to confer substantial activity increase, whereas combined mutations of uAUG3–7 yield high translation efficiencies. These results argue for a concerted function of the SHOX uAUGs with a major contribution of uAUGs3–7. To confirm these results in vivo, we fused the wild type"

Here, it is shown that Prx I gene expression was induced transcriptionally by the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in cultured rat liver tissue macrophages and RAW264.7 monocytic cells. TPA-dependent induction of Prx I gene expression was mediated by two proximal activator protein-1 sites of the rat Prx I promoter region that were nuclear targets of c-Jun as determined by transfection studies with luciferase reporter gene constructs and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The transcription factor Nrf2, however, was not involved in the regulation of Prx I promoter activity. Prx I gene induction by TPA was decreased by protein kinase C inhibitors and overexpressed dominant negative forms of Ras and MEKK1, but not Raf-1. The p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 and overexpression of dominant negative mutants of MAPK kinase 4 (MKK4), MKK6, and p38 inhibited the TPA-dependent induction of Prx I gene transcription. In contrast, inhibitors of the JNK, SP600125, and the NF-κB signaling pathway, caffeic acid phenethyl ester, respectively, as well as overexpressed dominant negative MKK7 and IκB, had no effect on the up-regulation of Prx I reporter gene activity by TPA. Cotransfection of wild-type p38α and p38β, but not that of p38γ and p38δ, increased Prx I promoter activity.

Prxs have been identified in numerous organisms ranging from bacteria and plants up to vertebrates and mammals and are divided into three classes: typical two-cysteine Prxs (Prx I-IV), atypical two-cysteine Prxs (Prx V), and one-cysteine Prxs (Prx VI) (8Hofmann B.

Therefore, Prxs may complement other enzymes with antioxidant potential such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, or glutathione peroxidase that have been ascribed protective roles in inflammation, cancer, or neurodegenerative disease (16Halliwell B.

However, little is known on the mechanisms that regulate gene expression of Prxs in mammalian cells. We and others (22Immenschuh S. Iwahara S.-I. Satoh H. Nell C. Katz N. Muller-Eberhard U.

Because Prx I appears to play an important role in carcinogenesis as a tumor suppressor (14Wen S.-T. Van Etten R.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2456-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 15Mu Z.M. Yin X.Y. Prochownik E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43175-43184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) the goal of the present study was to investigate the regulation of Prx I gene expression by the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). TPA is a tumor promoter that activates protein kinase C (PKC) (26Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4230) Google Scholar, 27Gopalakrishna R. Jaken S. Free. Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1349-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar), and here it is demonstrated that TPA induces Prx I gene expression in cultured monocytic cells. By transient transfection of reporter gene constructs with the newly cloned 5′-flanking promoter region of the Prx I gene it is shown that activator protein-1 (AP-1) sites of the rat Prx I promoter region play a crucial role for the TPA-dependent gene induction via interaction with c-Jun. The induction of Prx I promoter activity is mediated by a signaling pathway involving PKC, Ras, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase kinase (MEKK) 1, and p38 MAPK isoforms. Materials—Media M199 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were obtained from Invitrogen, nitrocellulose filters were from Schleicher & Schuell, and radioisotopes and the ECL chemiluminescent detection system for Western blot were from Amersham Biosciences. The nucleotide removal kit was from Qiagen, and the multiprime labeling kit, restriction endonucleases, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase were from New England Biolabs (Cambridge, MA). Falcon tissue culture dishes were from BD Biosciences. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma and Roche Applied Science unless otherwise indicated. Cell Isolation and Culture—Liver tissue macrophages (Kupffer cells) were isolated from livers of male Wistar rats (2 months old, body weight 170 to 200 g) according to Knook and Sleyster (28Knook D.L. Sleyster E.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1976; 99: 444-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) as described previously (23Immenschuh S. Stritzke J. Iwahara S.-I. Ramadori G. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 118-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In brief, the liver was digested with Pronase/collagenase solutions, and non-parenchymal cells were separated by density gradient centrifugation. Liver tissue macrophages were purified by counterflow elutriation (J2–21, JE-B6 rotor; Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA), and the obtained liver tissue macrophages were resuspended in medium M199 containing 15% fetal calf serum, 100 units penicillin/ml and 100 μg streptomycin/ml. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue staining. Cells were plated on 6-well plates (3 × 106 cells/well) for preparation of RNA or protein. After 2 h cells were washed for elimination of non-adherent cells. RAW264.7 cells were from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units penicillin/ml and 100 μg streptomycin/ml. Cell cultures were kept under air/CO2 (19:1) at 100% humidity. Treatment of cells with TPA was performed with serum-free medium. Western Blot Analysis—After washing of cell cultures twice with 0.9% NaCl, total protein was prepared essentially as described (23Immenschuh S. Stritzke J. Iwahara S.-I. Ramadori G. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 118-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). After addition of 1 ml of lysis buffer (0.1% SDS, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4), cells were boiled for 5 min and homogenized by passing through a 25-gauge needle. The homogenate was centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C, and the protein content was determined in the supernatant using the Bradford method. 50 μg of total protein was loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and was blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting. Membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.1% Tween for 1 h at room temperature. The primary polyclonal antibody for Prx I (3Iwahara S. Satoh H. Song D.-X. Webb J. Burlingame A.L. Nagae Y. Muller-Eberhard U. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13398-13406Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) was added at 1:1000 dilution, and the blot was incubated for 12 h at 4 °C. The secondary anti-rabbit IgG was diluted 1:8000, and the ECL chemiluminescent detection system was used for detection according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primary antibodies for the detection of phosphorylated and total MAPKs were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA) and were applied at the concentrations recommended by the manufacturer. RNA Isolation, Northern Blot Analysis, and Hybridization—Total RNA for Northern blotting was isolated as described previously (23Immenschuh S. Stritzke J. Iwahara S.-I. Ramadori G. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 118-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Equal quantities of RNA were separated on 1.2% agarose/2.2 m formaldehyde gels. After electrophoresis, RNA was blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and baked at 80 °C for 4 h. After prehybridization for 4 h at 42 °C, blots were hybridized overnight with α [32P]dCTP-radio-labeled cDNA probes at 42 °C essentially as described (23Immenschuh S. Stritzke J. Iwahara S.-I. Ramadori G. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 118-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The hybridization solution contained 6× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution (0.2% Ficoll 400, 0.2% polyvinylpyrrolidone, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin), 0.5% SDS, 50% formamide, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Blots were washed subsequently with 2× SSC/0.1% SDS (once) and 0.1× SSC/0.1% SDS (twice) at 65 °C. Filters were autoradiographed with x-ray films (X-OMAT RP; Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY) at –70 °C for up to 48 h or were displayed to a phosphorimager screen for 4–8 h, and radioactivity was measured with Imagequant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). When nitrocellulose filters were sequentially hybridized with different probes the 32P-labeled cDNA was removed after autoradiography by two washing steps with boiling 0.05× SSC/0.1% SDS for 15 min before rehybridization. cDNA Probe—As a probe for hybridization the cDNA of rat Prx I was applied (22Immenschuh S. Iwahara S.-I. Satoh H. Nell C. Katz N. Muller-Eberhard U. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13407-13411Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The cDNA fragment was labeled by the oligomer method with α [32P]dCTP using the multiprime DNA labeling kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. To correct for differences in RNA loading filters were rehybridized with a 28 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) oligonucleotide, which was labeled with [γ-32P]dATP at the 5′-end with T4 polynucleotide kinase. Cloning of the 5′-Flanking Region of the Prx I Gene Promoter—The proximal promoter 5′-flanking region of the rat Prx I gene was isolated using the Genome Walker™ kit from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA), which contains separate pools (libraries) of uncloned, genomic DNA that have been predigested with EcoRV, ScaI, DraI, PvuII, or SspI and ligated to an oligonucleotide anchor (adapter primer 1). A nested PCR approach was employed. The first PCR was performed with the adapter primer 1 (as described in the kit) and a 25-bp primer from position 55 to 31 of the Prx I cDNA (3Iwahara S. Satoh H. Song D.-X. Webb J. Burlingame A.L. Nagae Y. Muller-Eberhard U.

After analysis of an aliquot of the PCR products on a 1% agarose gel, the PCR products were diluted 1:50 in sterile deionized H2O and subjected to a second round of PCR. The second PCR was performed with the adapter primer 2 and the nested 26-bp primer from position 31 to 9 of the Prx I cDNA (5′-CAGGTCTCACAAACAGAACCAACCGT-3′) using a program of 94 °C × 25 s, 72 °C × 3 min for five cycles, 94 °C × 25 s, 67 °C × 3 min for 20 cycles, and 67 °C × 4 min for one cycle. The amplified PCR products were separated by electrophoresis, subcloned into the pCR2.1™ vector (Invitrogen) to generate plasmid pCRPrxProm, and sequenced in both directions. Plasmid Constructs—A MluI/XhoI fragment from plasmid pCRPrx-Prom was cloned into promoterless pGL3-Basic plasmid to generate pPrx1750. Deletion mutants pPrx1209, pPrx897, pPrx558, pPrx283, and pPrx127 were generated by PCR using oligonucleotides Prx1209 (5′-CATAGCAAAAAGCAAACTTTC-3′), Prx897 (5′-GTTCTGTCTCACTTCCTCG-3′), Prx558 (5′-AAGAGACTTTTGGGGGACATC-3′), Prx283 (5′-GCAGGGCCAGGAGAC-3′), and Prx127 (5′-GACCAGTGAAGCTCTTTTC-3′) as forward primers, respectively, and oligonucleotide Prxbasic (5′-TCTGGCACCTGCACTTG-3′) as a reverse primer. PCR products were religated by standard procedures. To construct plasmid pPrx897/668 and pPrx668/897 specific primers with adjacent SacI or BglII restriction sites were generated. For pPrx897/668 the forward primer Prx897SacIF (5′-AATCGGAGCTCGTTCTGTCTCACTTCCCTCGC-3′) with a SacI restriction site and the reverse primer Prx668BglIIR (5′-GACTGAGATCTTGTTTGCTGAACACCATGAC-3′) with a BglII restriction site were used for PCR with pPrx1750 as template. After digestion with SacI and BglII the PCR fragment was cloned into the SacI/BglII sites of pGL3-Prom. Plasmid pPrx668/897 was constructed accordingly with the forward primer Prx897BglIIF (5′-GACTGAGATCTGTTCTGTCTCACTTCCTCGC-3′) and the reverse primer Prx668SacIR (5′-AATCGGAGCTCTGTTTGCTGAACACCATGAC-3′). In a similar fashion pPrx667/283 and pPrx283/667 were generated by using the primer pairs Prx667SacIF (5′-AATCGGAGCTCCCATGGGGTCGGGTCCCAG-3′) and Prx283BglIIR (5′-GACTGAGA TCTCCACTGTCATCAACAACCAAAG-3′) or Prx667BglIIF (5′-GACTGAGATCTCCATG GGGTCGGGTCCCAG-3′) and Prx283SacIR (5′-AATCGGAGCTCCCACTGTCATCAA CAACCAAAG-3′), respectively. pPrx282/108 and pPrx108/282 were generated by using the primer pairs Prx282SacIF (5′-AATCGGAGCTCCAGGGCCAGGAGACCTAATG-3′) and Prx108BglIIR (5′-GACTGAGATCTGGAAAAGAGCTTCACTGGTC-3′) and Prx282BglIIF (5′-GACTGAGATCTCAGGGCCAGGAGACCTAATG-3′) and Prx108SacIR (5′-AATCGGAGCTCGGAAAAGAGCTTCACTGGTC-3′), respectively. Plasmid pPrx558mutA was generated with the template pPrx558 and the oligonucleotide MutAfor (5′-GTCAGACAGGAAGACTGTGTGTATGGGC-3′) as forward primer and the oligonucleotide MutArev (5′-AACCCCTGTCTCTGTCATCTCTGTTCC-3′) as reverse primer. Plasmid pPrx558mutB was generated with the oligonucleotide MutB2for (5′-AGTCAAAAGCTTATTCTAAAGTGCAGGGTC-3′) as forward primer and MutB2rev (5′-ACGGAGTCATAGTCTCTGTGCTACAGC-3′) and pPrx558 as template. To construct plasmid pPrx558mutAB oligonucleotides MutAfor and MutArev were applied for PCR with plasmid pPrx558mutB as template. All PCR fragments were religated by standard procedures, and the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing in both directions. The luciferase reporter gene construct pAP-1luc with six copies of the AP-1 enhancer was a gift from Dr. Brent Carter (University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA) (29Carter A.B.

Expression vectors for c-Jun, dominant negative c-Jun, Nrf2 (nuclear factor E2-related factor 2), dominant negative Nrf2, and the p3xStREluc reporter plasmid with three copies of the heme oxygenase-1 antioxidant response element (ARE) were provided by Dr. Jawed Alam (Alton Ochsner Foundation, New Orleans, LA). Transfection and Luciferase Assay—After growth for 16 h transfection of plasmid DNA into RAW264.7 cells was performed by the liposome method using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Unless otherwise stated cells were transfected with 1 μg of reporter plasmid and 0.1 to 0.5 μg of cotransfected expression vectors. Equal amounts of DNA were adjusted with the respective empty expression vector. Cells were lysed with 1× luciferase lysis buffer, and luciferase activity was determined with a luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were either harvested 24 h after transfection or treated for another 18 h with TPA as indicated. Relative light units were correlated with sample protein. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared essentially as described (30Kietzmann T. Samoylenko A. Immenschuh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17927-17936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The sequences of the oligonucleotides used for the EMSA are as follows: Prx I AP-1-A, 5′-GACAGGGTGACTAAGACAGGA-3′ (spanning the Prx I AP-1-A site; see Fig. 2), Prx I AP-1-B, 5′-TGACTCCTGACTCAAAAGCTT-3′ (spanning the Prx I AP-1-B site; see Fig. 2), and Prx I AP-1-Amut, 5′-GACAGGGGTTCTCAGACAGGA-3′. The AP-1 consensus oligonucleotide with the sequence 5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′ was from Promega. Equal amounts of complementary oligonucleotides were annealed and labeled by 5′-end labeling with [γ-32P]dATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. They were purified with the nucleotide removal kit. Binding reactions were carried out in a total volume of 20 μl containing 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 10 μg of nuclear extract, 250 ng poly(dI-dC), and 5 mm dithioerythritol. For competition analyses an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides was added. After preincubation for 5 min at room temperature, 1 μl of the labeled probe (104 cpm) was added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 10 min. For supershift analysis 1 μl of the c-JunD (epitope corresponding to DNA binding domain), c-JunN (epitope mapping within the N-terminal domain), cAMP regulatory element (RE) binding protein-1 (24H4B), or SP-1 (PEP2-G) antibody (all obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), as well as a rabbit preimmune serum, were added to the EMSA reaction, which was then incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The electrophoresis was then performed with a 4.5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in TBE buffer (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, 5 mm EDTA) at 200 V. After electrophoresis the gels were dried and exposed to x-ray films. TPA-dependent Induction of Prx I Gene Expression in Cultured Rat Liver Tissue Macrophages and RAW264.7 Cells— Regulation of Prx I gene expression by TPA was examined in cultures of rat liver tissue macrophages and the mouse monocytic cell line RAW264.7. As shown by Northern and Western blot analysis TPA caused a pronounced induction of Prx I mRNA and protein expression, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). In RAW264.7 cells Prx I mRNA up-regulation by TPA was time-dependent with a peak after 6 h (Fig. 1C). Moreover, a dose-dependent increase of Prx I mRNA expression was observed with a maximum at a concentration of 0.5 μm TPA (Fig. 1D). To probe into the mechanism of TPA-dependent Prx I gene induction RAW264.7 cells were treated with actinomycin D, which inhibits cellular transcription. Induction of Prx I mRNA expression by TPA was blocked by pretreatment with actinomycin D suggesting that Prx I gene induction was regulated on the transcriptional level (Fig. 1E). The data indicate that Prx I gene expression is induced by TPA in cultured monocytic cells. Cloning of the Rat Prx I Gene Promoter and Identification of Potential cis-Acting Elements—To analyze the molecular mechanisms of TPA-dependent Prx I gene expression in more detail we cloned the promoter and 5′-flanking region of the rat Prx I gene. For this purpose a nested PCR approach was employed as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” The obtained 1750-bp DNA fragment was subcloned into pCR2.1, and the sequence was determined by standard sequencing methods and deposited into GenBank™ (accession number AJ457059). The transcriptional start site was determined by primer extension analysis using total RNA from RAW264.7 cell cultures and rat liver (data not shown) and was localized 48 bp upstream of the translational start site (Fig. 2). Sequence comparison of the cloned rat Prx I promoter with the previously characterized promoter region of the human proliferation-associated gene showed no sequence similarity (3Iwahara S. Satoh H.

Genomics. 1994; 19: 236-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A TATA box was identified at position –62 relative to the transcription start site. Putative cis-acting elements were localized by sequence comparison in the cloned promoter 5′-flanking region of the rat Prx I gene. Various candidate cis-acting sequences were identified including, but not limited to, AP-1 and NF-κB (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the extended sequence of the AP-1-A site exhibited high homology to the consensus sequence of the ARE, GGTGACNNNGCA, which is a target of the transcription factor (TF) Nrf2. Nrf2 has been shown previously (32Ishii T. Itoh K. Takahashi S. Sato H. Yanagawa T. Katoh Y. Bannai S. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16023-16029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar) to play an important regulatory role for the stress-dependent induction of Prx I gene expression (32Ishii T.

At this point the functional significance of the identified DNA elements was unclear. Functional Role of Proximal AP-1 Sites for the TPA-dependent Induction of Prx I Promoter Activity—The importance of cis-acting elements in the regulation of Prx I gene expression was evaluated by ligating the cloned 5′-flanking promoter sequence into the luciferase reporter vector pGL3-Basic to give pPrx1750. To identify REs that mediate TPA-dependent induction of Prx I gene expression RAW264.7 cells were transfected with serially 5′-deleted Prx I promoter luciferase reporter gene constructs. Luciferase activity of pPrx1750 was induced by TPA 9-fold, and the strongest TPA-dependent up-regulation of luciferase activity was observed for construct pPrx558 (Fig. 3A). To assess the regulatory capacity of putative AP-1 sites in the Prx I promoter 5′-flanking region various reporter gene constructs were generated by cloning fragments of the Prx I promoter into plasmid pGL3-Prom in front of the SV40 promoter. DNA sequences with the AP-1-A (–211 to –205; TGACTAA), AP-1-B (–505 to –499; TGACTCA), or AP-1-C (–829 to –823; TGAGTCA) sites were ligated in either 5′-3′ or 3′-5′ orientation into this luciferase reporter plasmid, respectively. Regulation of these constructs by TPA was compared with that of pPrx887, which contains the promoter with the AP-1-A-C sites in the wild-type context (Fig. 3B). The strongest TPA-dependent induction of luciferase activity was observed for construct pPrx282/108, which contained the AP-1-A site (Fig. 3B). TPA-dependent induction of pPrx282/108, however, was markedly lower as compared with that of pPrx887 suggesting that both the AP-1-A and the AP-1-B sites may be functional in a cooperative manner. The functional role of the AP-1-A and AP-1-B sites was also determined by mutation studies. Induction of luciferase activity of pPrx558mutB by TPA was slightly reduced in compari"

It has been shown that the recruitment of TRAFs to the CD40 cytoplasmic tail is essential for CD40-mediated B cell responses. However, it has also been shown that some early B cell responses, such as up-regulation of cell surface molecules and B cell proliferation are only marginally impaired by the disruption of previously defined TRAF binding sites (Ahonen, C., Manning, E., Erickson, L.

Hence, like CD30, the CD40 cytoplasmic tail contains two distinct and functionally important TRAF2 binding sites. CD40, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, was first identified and functionally characterized on B lymphocytes. Engagement of CD40 by its ligand, CD154, on activated helper T lymphocytes initiates signals that trigger up-regulation of a number of B cell surface molecules including regulatory molecules such as CD23 and co-stimulatory molecules such as B7.1 (1Ahonen C.

CD40 transduces signals via these adaptor proteins to mediate the activation of multiple signaling pathways including NFκB, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, which in turn phosphorylate and activate downstream transcription factors (7Berberich I.

To define the role that TRAFs play in CD40-mediated B cell activation, a number of groups have engineered mutations into the cytoplasmic domain of CD40 to selectively disrupt the binding of specific TRAFs. In both B cell lines and transgenic mice in which the canonical TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF6 sites have both been disrupted (ΔT2,3,6), some CD40-mediated signaling and function were still intact. Other reports have documented that even with the mutations in the canonical TRAF binding sites, the binding of TRAFs to the CD40 cytoplasmic tail could still be detected (11Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6307-6311PubMed Google Scholar, 12Haxhinasto S.A. Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 1145-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that TRAF binding to a site mapping outside of the established sites could be responsible for residual signaling in which the canonical TRAF binding sites have been disrupted. In this report, we have identified a new functional domain within the highly conserved C terminus of CD40 cytoplasmic tail. We have shown that this domain contains a functional TRAF2 binding site. Site-directed mutagenesis of the second TRAF2 binding site has shown that ablation of TRAF2 binding results in loss of biological activity in this domain. The importance of this site in B cell activation and its function relative to the dominant TRAF2 site is discussed. Cell Culture and Transfection—The murine B cell line M12.4.1 was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and antibiotics. Stable transfections of B cells were carried out using electroporation as described previously (2Manning E. Pullen S.S. Souza D.J. Kehry M. Noelle R.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). G418-resistant clones were isolated by magnetic cell sorting (Miltenyl Biotech) with biotin-conjugated anti-human CD40 antibody and were further analyzed for surface expression of chimeric CD40 by using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Polyclonal transfectants with chimeric CD40 expression were used for experiments to prevent clonal variation. Construction of Chimeric CD40 with a Different Cytoplasmic Tail— All of the chimeric CD40 constructs were constructed using PCR. Following sequence verification, fragments were subcloned using EcoRI sites into vector pDOI-5 for expression under the major histocompatibility complex class II promoter as described previously (1Ahonen C.

In constructs Del260 and Del260SEAA, a SalI site was used to make the fusion between the membrane-spanning domain and the conserved C terminal domain.

Supernatants from mCD154/mCD8 transfected SF9 cells was a kind gift of K. Marilyn (Roche Applied Science). Up-regulation of CD23—M12 cells (5 × 104) transfected with different chimeric CD40 constructs were stimulated in 250 μl of culture medium for 24 h (37 °C) with medium, shCD154 (200 ng/ml), and smCD154 (1:50 dilution of supernatants from mCD154/mCD8 transfected SF9 cells). Cells were then washed and stained with antibodies for analysis by flow cytometry. Immunoprecipitations and Western Blotting—M12 cells (2.5 × 106) transfected with different chimeric CD40 constructs were biotinylated following the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce) and then stimulated in 1 ml of culture medium for 15 min (37 °C) with shCD154 (200 ng/ml). Cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in 250 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% IGEPAL, 1 mm dithiothreitol) in the presence of protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors. After incubation 30 min (4 °C), cleared supernatants were precleared for 30 min at 4 °C on a rotator with protein G-agarose beads (Pierce) and then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with protein G-agarose beads preconjugated with anti-hCD40 monoclonal antibody. Beads were washed four times with cold phosphate-buffered saline with protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors and then once with cold Tris buffer (pH 7.2). Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. A chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) was used to detect horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies on Western blots. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—A murine splenic B cell library was made by using BD Matchmaker Library Construction and Screening kits (Clontech Laboratories). Library screening by the yeast two-hybrid method was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, positive transformants were identified by growth on SD-His, -Ade, -Leu, and -Trp plates and blue color in the presence of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) (Clontech Laboratories). Positive clones were grouped by restriction mapping of PCR products generated for insert DNAs. Representatives of each group were reconfirmed by retransformation into yeast containing the original bait plasmid or the negative control empty vector and human lamin C as instructed by Clontech. Putative interacting clones that tested positive at this step were sequenced and blasted against GenBank™ sequences. Protein-protein interactions were further analyzed by β-galactosidase assay (PE Biosystems). The Highly Conserved C Terminus of the CD40 Cytoplasmic Tail Can Induce the Up-regulation of CD23- and CD40-induced Growth Arrest—Previous studies have shown that in B cells from Tg mice, or in B cell lines engineered to express mutations in the TRAF2, -3, and -6 sites (ΔT2,3,6), many of the early CD40-mediated B cell responses are still intact (1Ahonen C. Manning E. Erickson L.D. O'Connor B.P. Lind E.F. Pullen S.S. Kehry M.R. Noelle R.J. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 2Manning E. Pullen S.S. Souza D.J. Kehry M. Noelle R.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These data suggested that early B cell activation via CD40 was independent of these TRAF binding sites. The identity of the CD40 functional domain that was responsible for the activity of the ΔT2,3,6 cytoplasmic tail was deduced by site-directed mutagenesis and/or deletional analysis. The murine B cell line (M12.4.1) was engineered to express a chimeric human/mouse CD40 protein with different deletions and site-directed mutations of cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 1A). As described previously, the use of a chimeric molecule with a murine cytoplasmic domain ensures the intact species-specific cytoplasmic protein interactions, whereas the use of a human extracellular domain allows the selective engagement of the transfected protein in the presence of the endogenous murine CD40 protein (2Manning E. Pullen S.S. Souza D.J. Kehry M. Noelle R.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For all analyses, M12 cell lines expressing the human/mouse chimeric constructs were stimulated with human CD154 (for triggering the human/mouse chimeric expressed receptor) or mCD154 (as a control to trigger via the endogenous murine receptor). A series of mutant chimeric CD40 molecules were transfected into M12 cells to determine their capacity to transduce signals. To evaluate the functional capacity of each of these mutant chimeric proteins in signal transduction, CD40-induced up-regulation of CD23 was used as a measurement. CD40-induced up-regulation of CD23 has been used repeatedly to evaluate the integrity of CD40 signaling (1Ahonen C. Manning E. Erickson L.D. O'Connor B.P. Lind E.F. Pullen S.S. Kehry M.R. Noelle R.J.

Immunity. 2002; 17: 265-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Moreover, signaling through CD40 causes proliferation of normal B cells but causes growth arrest of B lymphomas (14Goldstein M.D. Watts T.H. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2837-2843PubMed Google Scholar). As previously reported, M12 cells where the TRAF2, -3, and -6 sites were mutated (ΔT2,3,6) still up-regulated CD23 and induced growth arrest in response to CD40 engagement, indicating that the site(s) outside the canonical TRAF binding sites was/were responsible for these early activities. Therefore, the ability of M12 cell lines to express different CD40 mutants to up-regulate CD23 and to inhibit cell growth was functionally accessed. Extensive deletion of the cytoplasmic domain (STOP222) was used as a negative control. After evaluating the functional activities of a series of CD40 constructs (data not shown), grafting of the highly conserved C terminus of CD40 (residues 261–289; Del260) onto the STOP222 “backbone” appeared to restore activity (Fig. 2). As an internal control, M12 cells expressing different CD40 constructs showed comparable activities signaling through endogenous murine CD40 protein (Fig. 2). Inspection of the C-terminal domain revealed a putative TRAF2 binding site, SVQE (residues 273–276). To determine whether this putative TRAF2 binding site was responsible for the up-regulation of CD23 and growth arrest, site-directed mutagenesis was performed. A CD40 molecule with this site mutated (Del260 SEAA) was transfected into M12 cells and its activity tested. Mutagenesis of this site completely ablated both up-regulation of CD23 and growth arrest induced by shCD154 (Fig. 2, A and B). CD154-induced Binding of TRAF2 to the C Terminus of CD40 —TRAF2 binding to the C terminus of CD40 was directly assessed by immunoprecipitation of the CD40 receptor complex. After treatment with shCD154, lysates of M12 cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody followed by blotting with anti-TRAF2. TRAF2 recruitment to CD154-treated wild type (full-length tail of CD40 cytoplasmic domain) was readily detectable. Furthermore, our data shows that TRAF2 also binds to ΔT2,3,6 and even Del260, although at vastly reduced levels (Fig. 3). Finally, site-directed mutagenesis of the putative TRAF2 binding motif in Del260 results in the loss of TRAF2 recruitment (Fig. 3). Together, the data in Fig. 3 and previous studies indicate the existence of a second TRAF2 binding site in the CD40 highly conserved C terminus. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening Confirms TRAF2 Binding to the Highly Conserved C Terminus of CD40 Cytoplasmic Tail—To confirm that TRAF2 can bind to the CD40 C terminus and, moreover, to identify possible non-TRAF binding proteins, we engineered CD40 cytoplasmic tails that lacked all known TRAF binding sites and expressed these as baits in yeast two-hybrid screening (Fig. 1B). Using a fragment of CD40 consisting of the highly conserved C terminus (Del260) from a total ∼5 × 107, ∼240 positive clones have been screened. Peptides that bound specifically to CD40 C terminus were identified by secondary screens against empty vector or irrelevant bait proteins to eliminate false positives. Each of the positive clones we isolated contained the full-length TRAF2 open reading frame. To further confirm the result, TRAF2 with testing baits, empty vector, and control vector (human lamin C) were then co-transformed into yeast and restreaked into the most stringent plates (SD-Ade, -His, -Leu, and -Trp). After 48 h of incubation, whereas yeast transformed with TRAF2 and an empty vector or human lamin C did not grow, yeast transformed with TRAF2 and the C terminus of CD40 (Del260) grew almost as well as yeast transformed with the TRAF2 and full-length tail of CD40 cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 4A). To quantitatively compare the strength of these interactions, we measured β-galactosidase activity in the same strains. Yeast expressing TRAF2/Del260 displayed β-galactosidase activity that was comparable with TRAF2/ΔT2,3,6 and slightly lower than TRAF2/wild type (Fig. 4B). Taken together, results from yeast two-hybrid studies indicated that the C terminus of CD40 by itself could interact with TRAF2. TRAFs have been shown to be the essential components of CD40-mediated B cell proliferation, molecular cell surface up-regulation, germinal center formation, generation of memory B cells, isotype switching, affinity maturation, and other events necessary for efficient thymus-dependent humoral immunity (1Ahonen C.

In this study, we used site-directed mutagenesis assays and yeast two-hybrid screening to identify a new functional domain that contains a TRAF2 binding motif in the highly conserved C terminus of the CD40 cytoplasmic tail. The sequence of human and murine CD40 C terminus is completely conserved, except for the fact that the murine CD40 has an extended 11-amino acid tail. We determined that this 11-amino acid extension was not important to the up-regulation of CD23 or growth arrest (data not shown). A previous study showed that with the intact TRAF2/3 (PVQET) binding site, deleting the C terminus of CD40 cytoplasmic tail reduced TRAF2 binding to ∼40% of control level (4Leo E. Welsh K.

Other reports have shown that the C terminus CD40 cytoplasmic tail may also affect TRAF2 binding suggesting the role of CD40 C terminus in stabilizing canonical TRAF binding at PVQET motif (11Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6307-6311PubMed Google Scholar, 12Haxhinasto S.A. Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 1145-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Our results have extended these observations by finding a second independent TRAF2 binding site in CD40 C terminus. We have shown that, with deletion of all the canonical TRAF binding sites, signaling through this newly identified TRAF2 binding site was able to up-regulate CD23, which functions as a regulatory receptor for B cells. Finally, this C-terminal domain can transduce growth arrest upon CD40 engagement. Previous studies have shown two independent domains of CD30 cytoplasmic tail that interact with TRAF2 (Fig. 5) (15Lee S.Y. Kandala G. Liou M.L. Liou H.C. Choi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9699-9703Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 16Boucher L.M. Marengere L.E. Lu Y. Thukral S. Mak T.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 592-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Crystallographic analysis of receptor recognition of TRAF2 has further identified that both PXQXT and SXXE motifs are recognized by TRAF2 (17Park Y.C. Burkitt V. Villa A.R. Tong L. Wu H. Nature. 1999; 398: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 18McWhirter S.M. Pullen S.S. Holton J.M. Crute J.J. Kehry M.R. Alber T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8408-8413Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In fact, they all fit into the major TRAF2 binding consensus sequence, (P/S/A/T)X(Q/E)E (19Ye H. Park Y.C. Kreishman M. Kieff E. Wu H. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). CD40, like CD30, contains both of the PXQXT and SXXE motifs in the cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 5). The failure of detection of TRAF2 binding in the CD40 peptide containing the SXXE motif in a previous study may have been because of alterations in the surrounding amino acid environment (16Boucher L.M. Marengere L.E. Lu Y. Thukral S. Mak T.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 592-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Indeed, in our experiments, M12 cells expressing chimeric CD40, which has only 9 amino acids including the SXXE motif in the cytoplasmic tail (270–278), showed no activities similar to the negative control M12/STOP222 (data not shown). The finding of a second TRAF2 binding site in the CD40 cytoplasmic tail raises numerous questions. First, what is the physiological role of the second TRAF2 binding site in naïve B cell activation? B cells from human/mouse CD40 transgenic mice that lack the canonical TRAF binding sites (ΔT2,3,6) are normal with regard to CD40-mediated NFκB activation, B cell proliferation, up-regulation of surface molecules, and early Ig production (1Ahonen C. Manning E. Erickson L.D. O'Connor B.P. Lind E.F. Pullen S.S. Kehry M.R. Noelle R.J. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This suggests that this new TRAF2 site may be critical for many of these early activities. Mice expressing only the C-terminal TRAF2 site are being produced to address these issues. However, another report has shown (using similarly engineered mice) that the ΔT2,3,6 mice were defective in early B cell responses but could isotype-switch to IgG2b (13Jabara H. Laouini D. Tsitsikov E. Mizoguchi E. Bhan A. Castigli E. Dedeoglu F. Pivniouk V. Brodeur S. Geha R. Immunity. 2002; 17: 265-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although the explanation for such divergent results is unclear at this time, one possible explanation is that, in our studies, trimerized recombinant CD40 ligand was used for CD40 stimulation, whereas in the latter studies, anti-CD40 antibodies were used. A previous report has shown that forming a trimeric CD40 ligand and CD40-receptor complex is important for its signaling (20Werneburg B.G. Zoog S.J. Dang T.T. Kehry M.R. Crute J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43334-43342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Weak stimulation from using anti-CD40 antibodies or supernatants of CD40L transfected cells in other reports might result in the failure of detecting those functional activities from the second TRAF2 binding site. Differences in the in vivo responses from these studies can be readily accounted for by the fact that the CD40 transgene was expressed using the class II major histocompatibility complex promoter in one set of studies (1Ahonen C. Manning E. Erickson L.D. O'Connor B.P. Lind E.F. Pullen S.S. Kehry M.R. Noelle R.J. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and the Ig promoter in others (13Jabara H. Laouini D. Tsitsikov E. Mizoguchi E. Bhan A. Castigli E. Dedeoglu F. Pivniouk V. Brodeur S. Geha R. Immunity. 2002; 17: 265-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It is our opinion that expression of the CD40 transgene under the class II major histocompatibility complex promoter is preferred because it replaces CD40 in most of the physiologically relevant cells of the immune system. Furthermore, differences in expression levels of transgene could also contribute to the disparities in the reported experimental results. A second question that emerges is whether cooperativity between the two TRAF2 sites is critical in recruiting TRAF complexes or whether these sites operate independently (15Lee S.Y. Kandala G. Liou M.L. Liou H.C. Choi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9699-9703Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). As we study the immunological capacities of mice engineered to express one or two TRAF2 sites, the physiological role of the two TRAF2 binding sites in CD40 tail should become apparent. Even though TRAF2 interacts with several TNFR superfamily members, it may function in different ways depending on the site within the receptor to which it binds (21Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3318-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Different timing, the amount of TRAFs, or different interaction proteins may all contribute to the ability of TRAFs to transduce specific biologic signals. In summary, we have identified a new functional domain in the C terminus of CD40 cytoplasmic tail that can recruit TRAF2 upon CD40 engagement. The physiological role of the second TRAF2 binding site and how these binding sites interact in concert within the complicated network of CD40 signaling remains to be further investigated. We thank Cory Ahonen and Dr. Arti Gaur for helpful advice."

RRF forms stable complexes with 70 S ribosomes and 50 S ribosomal subunits. Here, we show that EF-G releases RRF from 70 S ribosomal and model post-termination complexes but not from 50 S ribosomal subunit complexes. The release of bound RRF by EF-G is stimulated by GTP analogues. The EF-G-dependent release occurs in the presence of fusidic acid and viomycin. However, thiostrepton inhibits the release. RRF was shown to bind to EF-G-ribosome complexes in the presence of GTP with much weaker affinity, suggesting that EF-G may move RRF to this position during the release of RRF. On the other hand, RRF did not bind to EF-G-ribosome complexes with fusidic acid, suggesting that EF-G stabilized by fusidic acid does not represent the natural post-termination complex. In contrast, the complexes of ribosome, EF-G and thiostrepton could bind RRF, although with lower affinity. These results suggest that thiostrepton traps an intermediate complex having RRF on a position that clashes with the P/E site bound tRNA. Mutants of EF-G that are impaired for translocation fail to disassemble post-termination complexes and exhibit lower activity in releasing RRF. We propose that the release of ribosome-bound RRF by EF-G is required for post-termination complex disassembly. Before release from the ribosome, the position of RRF on the ribosome will change from the original A/P site to a new location that clashes with tRNA on the P/E site.

However, RRF lies at the ribosomal subunit interface, across the 50 S subunit, in a position that is nearly orthogonal to the A- and P-site bound tRNA (17Hirokawa G. Kiel M.C. Muto A. Kawai G.

RRF readily forms complexes with 70 S ribosomes, 50 S ribosomal subunits, and polysomes (also see Refs. 16Hirokawa G. Kiel M.C. Muto A. Selmer M. Raj V.S. Liljas A. Igarashi K. Kaji H. Kaji A.

We demonstrate that, as part of the RRF-dependent post-termination complex disassembly reaction, EF-G releases RRF from ribosomal complexes, and this release activity of EF-G is due to the translocation activity of EF-G. Buffers—The buffers used were as follows: buffer A, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 3 mm DTT; buffer B, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 500 mm NH4Cl, 2 mm DTT; buffer C, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 2 mm DTT; buffer D, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgSO4, 50 mm NH4Cl, 0.5 mm DTT; buffer E, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT; buffer F, 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7), 1 mm DTT; buffer G, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 25 mm KCl, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2; buffer H, 14 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 12 mm Mg(OAc)2, 66 mm NH4Cl, 0.3 mm DTT; buffer I, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, 7 mm Mg(OAc)2, 8 m urea; buffer J, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 7 mm Mg(OAc)2, 300 mm imidazole. Preparation of 70 S Ribosomes—17 g of Escherichia coli MRE 600 cells (purchased from the University of Alabama Fermentation Facility) were thawed, suspended in 35 ml of buffer A, and passed once through a French press at ∼12,000 p.s.i. The cell suspension was centrifuged twice at 30,000 × g for 15 min, discarding the pellets. The supernatant was layered onto four 15-ml sucrose solutions (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 500 mm NH4Cl, 2 mm DTT, 1.1 m sucrose) and centrifuged at 30,000 rpm in a Ti70 rotor for 22 h. The crude ribosome pellets were resuspended in 45 ml of buffer B (no sucrose), cleared by a 15-min centrifugation step at 30,000 × g, and pelleted at 35,000 rpm in a Ti70 rotor for 2 h. The clearing and pelleting step was repeated once more. The washed ribosome pellet was resuspended in storage buffer (buffer A except 50 mm NH4Cl) and stored at –80 °C. Analysis of the 70 S ribosomes on 10–30% sucrose gradients (8 mm Mg2+) showed no significant subunit dissociation of the 70 S ribosomes. Purification of Native RRF—Native RRF was purified from an over-producing strain, DH5α(pRR2) (19Shimizu I. Kaji A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5181-5187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as we have previously described (13Hirashima A. Kaji A. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4037-4044Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The purified RRF was dialyzed against buffer D and stored at –80 °C. Purification of Native EF-G—Native EF-G was purified from an overproducing strain, JM83(pECEG) based on published methods (20Kaziro Y. Inoue N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1968; 64: 423-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 21Hou Y. Yaskowiak E.S. March P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7038-7044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Four grams of cells were lysed in buffer C by passing through a French press at 12,000 p.s.i. The cell suspension was centrifuged once at 30,000 × g for 20 min (pellet discarded) and once at 40,000 rpm in a Ti70 rotor for 2 h. The supernatant was precipitated with 70% saturated (NH4)2SO4 and resuspended in 8 ml of buffer E. The suspension was passed through a Sephadex G100 column equilibrated with buffer E. Fractions containing EF-G were determined by Coomassie-stained SDS gels, pooled, and applied to a 22-ml DEAE-Sepharose column equilibrated in buffer E. EF-G was eluted with a 0–0.6 m KCl gradient in buffer E. Fractions containing EF-G were pooled, dialyzed against buffer F, and applied to a 10-ml hydroxylapatite column equilibrated in buffer F. Purified EF-G was eluted with a 5–500 mm phosphate gradient (pH 7), dialyzed against buffer D, and stored at –80 °C. Purification of Mutant EF-G—BL21(DE3) E. coli cells harboring plasmids expressing His-tagged mutant EF-G, lacking single domains (either domain 1, 4, or 5) or having a single point mutation (H583K) (22Borowski C.

Individual colonies were then grown in LB liquid at 37 °C until an A600 ∼ 0.6 was reached. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added at a final concentration of 1 mm, and the cells were grown an additional 3.5 h. The cells were harvested and lysed in buffer I. The His-tagged EF-G was bound to Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen) and washed in buffer I. His-tagged EF-G was refolded by slowly replacing buffer I with buffer I containing 1 m urea. The refolded EF-G was eluted with buffer J, dialyzed against buffer D, and stored at –80 °C. Preparation of RRF-Ribosome Complexes—70 S ribosomes (0.25–0.5 μm) and RRF (3.75–5 μm) were incubated together for 10 min at room temperature in 40 μl of buffer G. Since the Kd value of RRF to the vacant ribosome was previously measured as ∼0.5 μm (17Hirokawa G. Kiel M.C. Muto A. Kawai G. Igarashi K. Kaji H. Kaji A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35847-35852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), under these conditions ribosomes are saturated with RRF and 1:1 complexes are formed. Complexes were separated from free RRF by Microcon-100 (Millipore) ultrafiltration, and isolated complexes were routinely measured for ribosome concentration (1 A260 unit = 23 pmol) and the amount of RRF bound (quantitative Western blot), as we have previously described (17Hirokawa G.

Freshly made complexes were used right away (within 5 min of preparation). Preparation of 35S-Labeled tRNAPhe—tRNAPhe (7 nmol; Sigma) was incubated with 150 μCi of [35S]ATPγS (1000 Ci/mmol) and 20 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) in 50 μl of reaction buffer (supplied with the kinase by Invitrogen). The reaction mixture was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C, followed by a heat-inactivating step at 65 °C for 10 min. The tRNAPhe was precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol at –20 °C and pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was rinsed twice with 500 μl of 70% ethanol, air-dried, and resuspended in 200 μl of buffer G. Preparation of tRNA-Ribosome Complexes—70 S ribosomes (0.25 μm) and 35S-labeled tRNAPhe (1.25 μm, ∼13,500 cpm/pmol) were incubated together for 10 min at room temperature in 40 μl of buffer G with or without one A260 unit of poly(U). During the process of making the complexes of tRNA and ribosomes, no EF-G or RRF were added. Complexes were separated from free tRNA by Microcon-100 ultrafiltration as previously described (17Hirokawa G. Kiel M.C. Muto A. Kawai G. Igarashi K. Kaji H. Kaji A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35847-35852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Release of RRF or tRNA by EF-G—EF-G was added to 40 μl of freshly prepared RRF-ribosome or tRNA-ribosome complexes in buffer G. Release was allowed to occur for 10 min at 35 °C or room temperature. Released RRF or released tRNA was separated from complexes on Microcon-100 as described for the formation of the complexes (17Hirokawa G. Kiel M.C. Muto A. Kawai G. Igarashi K. Kaji H. Kaji A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35847-35852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The amount of RRF still bound to ribosomes was measured by quantitative Western blot analysis of the complexes using anti-RRF antibody as described (17Hirokawa G. Kiel M.C. Muto A. Kawai G. Igarashi K. Kaji H. Kaji A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35847-35852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The amount of tRNA bound to ribosomes was measured by filtering through nitrocellulose filters and measuring 35S counts on the filter. Binding of RRF to 70 S Ribosomes in the Presence of EF-G—For studying the effects of the presence of EF-G on the binding of RRF to ribosomes, EF-G (15 or 120 pmol) was mixed with various concentrations of RRF, 10 pmol of 70 S ribosomes, and 1 mm GTP in 40 μl of buffer G. After the reaction, free EF-G and free RRF were removed from bound EF-G and RRF by Nano-Sep 300K ultrafiltration (Pall Life Sciences). The EF-G-ribosome complexes are not stable enough to withstand high speed centrifugation (about 80% is dissociated (25Cameron D.M. Thompson J. March P.E. Dahlberg A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar)), but we found that they are stable enough to withstand isolation by Nano-Sep 300K ultrafiltration (details of the interaction between EF-G and ribosomes studied with this technique will be published elsewhere). The amounts of ribosome-bound EF-G and ribosome-bound RRF were determined by quantitative Western blot using anti-EF-G or anti-RRF antibody. In experiments where the binding of RRF to preformed complexes of ribosome, EF-G, and thiostrepton were studied, the preformed complexes were prepared by incubating 140 pmol of 70 S ribosomes, 300 pmol of EF-G, 1 mm GTP, and 40 μm thiostrepton in 40 μl of buffer G for 10 min. In the experiments where the binding of RRF to preformed complexes of ribosome, EF-G, and fusidic acid were studied, preformed complexes were prepared by incubating 100 pmol of ribosomes, 250 pmol of EF-G, 1 mm GTP, and 1 mm fusidic acid in 40 μl of buffer G for 10 min. In both cases, free EF-G was removed, bound EF-G was quantified, and the complexes were reacted with RRF as described above. RRF Assay with Model Post-termination Complexes—Polysome preparation and RRF assays were essentially as previously described (16Hirokawa G. Kiel M.C. Muto A. Selmer M. Raj V.S. Liljas A. Igarashi K.

The RRF assay reaction mixture contained 2.2 A260 units of polysome per ml, 0.18 μm RRF, 0.55 μm EF-G, and 0.36 mm GTP (or other nucleotide) in buffer H. RRF binding to polysome and release was measured as described above for 70 S ribosomes except that a single Microcon-100 centrifugation at 3000 × g was used. No RRF was detected in the absence of polysome. tRNA release from the polysome was measured by amino-acylation of nitrocellulose (0.45 μm) filtrate as described (16Hirokawa G. Kiel M.C. Muto A. Selmer M. Raj V.S. Liljas A. Igarashi K. Kaji H. Kaji A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2272-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). EF-G Releases Ribosome-bound RRF—Complexes of 70 S ribosomes and RRF were formed by incubating RRF with well washed, vacant ribosomes (17Hirokawa G. Kiel M.C. Muto A. Kawai G. Igarashi K. Kaji H. Kaji A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35847-35852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). RRF-ribosome complexes thus formed were isolated, and EF-G and GTP were added at various concentrations. As shown in Fig. 1A, EF-G releases RRF from ribosomes in a dose-dependent manner. Under these conditions, EF-G optimally works at an approximate 1:1 ratio with the complexes. This is consistent with earlier studies that had shown that the optimal rate of ribosome recycling occurs when EF-G and RRF are present at a 1:1 ratio (13Hirashima A. Kaji A. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4037-4044Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and it demonstrates that EF-G works stoichiometrically with RRF. One may wonder if EF-G actually releases RRF from the ribosomes or simply affects its rebinding in a rapid equilibrium situation. It should be noted that the Kd value of RRF to the vacant ribosome is 0.2–0.5 μm, and therefore only a fraction (∼30%) of the released RRF (∼0.2 μm maximum released) should rebind. In this experiment, however, one would expect that no rebinding would take place, because the presence of EF-G would constantly remove the rebound RRF. Since the Kd value of EF-G to the vacant ribosome is ∼0.04 μm, one would expect nearly 100% of ribosomes should have bound EF-G under the experimental conditions. It is possible that very rapid release and binding can take place, but such rapid action cannot be detected with the present technique used. However, in separate experiments with fluorescent RRF and fast kinetic analysis, we did not detect such a rapid action of release and rebinding. As indicated below, about 20–25% of the ribosomes used in this experiment are inactive with respect to EF-G binding. On the other hand, ∼100% of the ribosomes are able to bind RRF (one RRF per ribosome). Hence, about 25% of bound RRF remains on the ribosomes even in the presence of excess EF-G. In our previous studies, we showed that higher concentrations of NH4Cl inhibit the initial binding of RRF (e.g. 150 mm NH4Cl inhibits ∼70% of the initial binding of RRF as compared with 30 mm monovalent ions (17Hirokawa G. Kiel M.C. Muto A. Kawai G. Igarashi K. Kaji H. Kaji A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35847-35852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar)). It was therefore possible that RRF may be released at physiological monovalent concentrations (150 mm) without EF-G. As shown in Fig. 1B, higher NH4Cl concentrations could not substitute for EF-G activity, indicating that EF-G is required for the release of RRF from ribosomes under physiological monovalent ion conditions. EF-G Does Not Release tRNA Bound to Nonprogrammed Ribosomes—RRF is a nearly perfect structural mimic of tRNA (15Selmer M. Al-Karadaghi S. Hirokawa G. Kaji A. Liljas A. Science. 1999; 286: 2349-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The effect of RRF on tRNA bound to nonprogrammed ribosomes, poly(U)-programmed ribosomes and polysomes, and vice versa has already been examined (17Hirokawa G. Kiel M.C. Muto A. Kawai G. Igarashi K. Kaji H. Kaji A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35847-35852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We previously proposed that P/E site tRNA would be released by RRF and EF-G (17Hirokawa G. Kiel M.C. Muto A. Kawai G. Igarashi K. Kaji H. Kaji A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35847-35852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we showed that tRNA bound to ribosomes is released by EF-G only if the A-site is occupied (26Ishitsuka H. Kuriki Y. Kaji A. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3346-3351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the way RRF binds to ribosomes is quite different from that of tRNA, it would be of interest to examine whether tRNA is released from ribosomes by EF-G under similar conditions to the release of RRF. In the experiment described in Fig. 1C, complexes of ribosomes and tRNA were formed under conditions where tRNA binds to the P- and/or E-sites but not the A-site (26Ishitsuka H. Kuriki Y. Kaji A. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3346-3351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Igarashi K. Kaji A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3245-3255Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It is clear from Fig. 1C that EF-G alone does not release the deacylated tRNA from these complexes as it does RRF. It is also noted that the presence or absence of poly(U) did not alter this situation. This is consistent with our earlier observation that the A-site must be occupied for the release of tRNA from the P- and/or E-site of nonprogrammed or homopolymer-programmed ribosomes by EF-G (26Ishitsuka H. Kuriki Y. Kaji A. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3346-3351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the situation is different with natural mRNA (16Hirokawa G. Kiel M.C. Muto A. Selmer M. Raj V.S. Liljas A. Igarashi K. Kaji H. Kaji A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2272-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This experiment was performed to demonstrate that bound tRNA behaves differently from bound RRF upon the addition of EF-G and GTP. The effect of RRF and EF-G together on bound tRNA has already been studied in detail (16Hirokawa G. Kiel M.C. Muto A. Selmer M. Raj V.S. Liljas A. Igarashi K. Kaji H. Kaji A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2272-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Release of RRF Is Not Dependent on GTP Hydrolysis—The activity of RRF is routinely checked by a model post-termination complex disassembly assay (31Hirashima A. Kaji A. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 65: 43-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In this assay, polysomes are treated with puromycin so that each ribosome acts as if it has reached a termination codon. The addition of RRF, EF-G, and GTP then converts the polysomes to monosomes by releasing both tRNA and mRNA. The hydrolysis of GTP is essential for the release of mRNA but not for the release of tRNA from model post-termination complexes (16Hirokawa G. Kiel M.C. Muto A. Selmer M. Raj V.S. Liljas A. Igarashi K. Kaji H. Kaji A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2272-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether or not the hydrolysis of GTP by EF-G was also essential for the release of RRF from ribosomes. As shown in Table I, nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues were effective, indicating that GTP hydrolysis is not required for the release of RRF by EF-G and GTP. As a matter of fact, nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue gave the maximum release of RRF. GMP-PCP freezes EF-G on the ribosome (32Kuriki Y. Inoue N. Kaziro Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 224: 487-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and this is the most likely reason why it gave the best release. The observation that the release of RRF takes place in the presence of GTP analogue has been confirmed by studies using fluorescent-labeled RRF. 2H. S. Seo, M. C. Kiel, V. S. Raj, A. Kaji, and B. S.

Open table in a new tab The fact that the release of RRF takes place with nonhydrolyzable GTP analog is very similar to the findings observed for the RRF-dependent release of tRNA catalyzed by EF-G (16Hirokawa G.

We previously suggested that the RRF-dependent release of tRNA requires translocation of RRF by EF-G. In a similar fashion, we propose that the release of RRF involves translocation of RRF from its A/P binding site to a new site by EF-G (Fig. 6). Evidence supporting this concept is given below. EF-G Does Not Release RRF from 50 S Subunits—RRF binds to 50 S subunits with a 10-fold lower affinity than to 70 S ribosomes (16Hirokawa G. Kiel M.C. Muto A. Selmer M. Raj V.S. Liljas A. Igarashi K. Kaji H. Kaji A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2272-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In contrast to the binding of tRNA to the 30 S subunit (33Kaji H. Suzuka I. Kaji A. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1968408235,"Abstract Isoform-specific nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors may prove clinically useful in reducing the pathophysiological effects associated with increased neuronal NOS (nNOS) or inducible NOS (iNOS) activity in a variety of neurological and inflammatory disorders. Analogs of the NOS substrate l-arginine are pharmacologically attractive inhibitors because of their stability, reliable cell uptake, and good selectivity for NOS over other heme proteins. Some inhibitory arginine analogs show significant isoform selectivity although the structural or mechanistic basis of such selectivity is generally poorly understood. In the present studies, we determined by x-ray crystallography the binding interactions between rat nNOS and N5-(1-imino-3-butenyl)-l-ornithine (l-VNIO), a previously identified mechanism-based, irreversible inactivator with moderate nNOS selectivity. We have also synthesized and mechanistically characterized several l-VNIO analogs and find, surprisingly, that even relatively minor structural changes produce inhibitors that are either iNOS-selective or non-selective. Furthermore, derivatives having a methyl group added to the butenyl moiety of l-VNIO and l-VNIO derivatives that are analogs of homoarginine rather than arginine display slow-on, slow-off kinetics rather than irreversible inactivation. These results elucidate some of the structural requirements for isoform-selective inhibition by l-VNIO and its related alkyl- and alkenyl-imino ornithine and lysine derivatives and may provide information useful in the ongoing rational design of isoform-selective inhibitors."

In the present study, we measured the intracellular free Mg2+ concentration ([Mg2+]i) using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in pig carotid artery smooth muscle. In normal solution, application of amiloride (1 mm) decreased [Mg2+]i by ∼12% after 100 min. Subsequent washout tended to further decrease [Mg2+]i. In contrast, application of amiloride significantly increased [Mg2+]i (by ∼13% after 100 min) under Ca2+-free conditions, where passive Mg2+ influx is facilitated. The treatments had little effect on intracellular ATP and pH (pHi). Essentially the same Ca2+-dependent changes in [Mg2+]i were produced with KB-R7943, a selective blocker of reverse mode Na+-Ca2+ exchange. Application of dimethyl amiloride (0.1 mm) in the presence of Ca2+ did not significantly change [Mg2+]i, although it inhibited Na+-H+ exchange at the same concentration. Removal of extracellular Na+ caused a marginal increase in [Mg2+]i after 100–200 min, as seen in intestinal smooth muscle in which Na+-Mg2+ exchange is known to be the primary mechanism of maintaining a low [Mg2+]i against electrochemical equilibrium. In Na+-free solution (containing Ca2+), neither amiloride nor KB-R7943 decreased [Mg2+]i, but they rather increased it.

Furthermore, it inhibits many Na+-dependent transporters, for example Na+-H+, Na+-Ca2+ exchanges etc. (11Benos D.J. Grinstein S. Na+/H+ Exchange.

It has been pointed out that Na+-Ca2+ exchange shares many characteristic features with Na+-Mg2+ exchange (18Flatman P.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 259-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it is interesting to examine possible effects of amiloride and KB-R7943 on [Mg2+]i regulation, and in the present study, we measured [Mg2+]i in pig carotid artery smooth muscle using 31P NMR. Despite low time resolution, this technique enables stable measurements over a long period, and this is advantageous because Mg2+ is considered to be a chronic regulator, such long time measurements are usually required. Further, fluorescent Mg2+ indicators, another option for measurement of [Mg2+]i, were not suitable for this purpose, since amiloride emits light (19Briggman J.V. Graves J.S. Spicer S.S. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Histochem. J. 1983; 15: 239-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Na+-Mg2+ exchange is thought to be the major mechanism to pump out intracellular Mg2+. Thus, possible inhibitors of Na+-Mg2+ exchange are expected to increase [Mg2+]i. The 31P NMR measurements in the present study, however, revealed that amiloride and KB-R7943 paradoxically decreased [Mg2+]i in a Ca2+-dependent manner. In addition, this effect persisted after washout for several minutes. A selective Na+-H+ exchange inhibitor, 5-(N,N-dimethyl)-amiloride (DMA), did not cause the same changes in [Mg2+]i. The underlying mechanisms are discussed. Preparation—Pig carotid arteries were collected at an abattoir (Nagoya Meat Hygiene Laboratory, Nagoya, Japan) in physiological saline solution, used as the normal solution for 31P NMR experiments. The arteries were stripped of fat and connective tissue, and cut into segments of ∼3 cm in length. The lumen was exposed by cutting the artery segments into two strips along the longitudinal direction. The endothelium was removed by scratching with a cotton-tipped stick. The resultant pig carotid artery strips (∼2 g wet weight) were (isometrically) mounted in a sample tube of 10-mm diameter. 31P NMR—The methods employed for the 31P NMR measurements were essentially the same as those used previously (20Nakayama S. Tomita T. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 435: 559-572Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21Nakayama S. Nomura H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 488: 1-12Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). An NMR spectrometer (GSX270W, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) was operated at 109.4 MHz for measurement of phosphorus compounds. The temperature of the sample tube was kept at 32 °C. Radiofrequency pulses corresponding to a flip angle of 30° were applied every 0.5 s, and 31P NMR spectra were normally obtained by accumulating 2500 signals (free induction decays: FIDs) over 25 min. Before Fourier transformation, a broadening factor of 20 Hz was applied to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. Spectral peak resonances (frequencies) were measured relative to that of phosphocreatine (PCr) in ppm. Experiments were started after equilibrating preparations under superfusion with normal solution for at least 100 min. In normal solution, six major peaks were observed: phosphomonoesters (PME), inorganic phosphate (Pi), PCr, and the γ-, α-, and β-peaks of ATP (Fig.1A). Concentrations of phosphorus compounds were estimated by integrating the spectral peaks (Scion Image, Frederick, MD) and by correcting with their saturation factors (Pi, 1.6; PCr, 1.36; β-ATP, 1.7) Estimation of [Mg2+]i and pHi—Changes in intracellular pH (pHi) were monitored using the chemical shift of the Pi peak (pKa 6.70; chemical shifts of H2PO4- and HPO42-=3.15 and 5.72 ppm, respectively; Ref. 20Nakayama S.

[Mg2+]i was estimated from the observed chemical shift of the β-ATP peak (δoβ) (22Dillon P.F. Bárány M. Biochemistry of Smooth Muscle Contraction.

In the pHi range between 6.5 and 8, this pH function of KD“MgATP” (pH)i at 32 °C provides about 2-fold larger KD“MgATP” values than those obtained using the previously described methods for correcting KD“MgATP” with pHi (21Nakayama S. Nomura H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 488: 1-12Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In some experiments we also applied simultaneous estimation of [Mg2+]i and pHi from the chemical shifts of β- and γ-ATP (24Nakayama S. Nomura H. Tomita T. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 833-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), in order to reinforce the Ca2+-dependent modulation of [Mg2+]i regulation. For the chemical shift of γ-ATP, an equation analogous to Equation 1 can be written as Equation 8.[Mg2+]i=KD``MgATP""(pHi)(δoγ-δfγ(pHi))/(δbγ(pHi)-δoγ)(Eq. 8) δfγ(pHi)=(δfγ,p-δfγ,d)/{1+10[HL(pK-pH)]}+δfγ,d(δfγ,d=-2.78;δfγ,p=-7.61;HL=-1.01;pK=6.48)(Eq. 9) δbγ(pHi)=(δbγ,p-δbγ,d)/{1+10[HL(pK-pH)]}+δbγ,d(δbγ,d=-2.26;δbγ,p=-7.57;HL=-0.92;pK=4.86)(Eq. 10) [Mg2+]i and pHi were estimated by solving Equations 1 and 8 simultaneously. Solutions and Chemicals—The normal solution had the following composition (mm): NaCl,137.9; KHCO3 5.9; CaCl2 2.4; MgCl2 1.2; glucose 11.8; HEPES 5 (pH adjusted to 7.4–7.5 at 32 °C). The ionic composition was modified iso-osmotically. For example, in a Na+-free solution, Na+ was replaced with N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG) on an equimolar basis. The solutions used for 31P NMR measurements were normally aerated with 95% O2/5% CO2. When bicarbonate was replaced with Cl–, the solution was aerated with 100% O2. Amiloride was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). 5-(N,N-Dimethyl)-amiloride (DMA) was from Sigma. KB-R7943 ((2-[2-[4-(4-nitrobenzyloxy)phenyl]ethyl]isothiourea methanesulfonate) was kindly provided by Kanebo Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). The effect of 1 mm amiloride on [Mg2+]i was examined in the present study (in pig carotid artery). Our previous experiments (21Nakayama S. Nomura H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 488: 1-12Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) revealed that this concentration of amiloride sufficiently block Na+-Mg2+ exchange. Preliminarily we examined the effect of KB-R7943 at 1–100 μm on [Mg2+]i. KB-R7943 up to 5 μm caused only a marginal decrease (by ∼0.04 mm after 100 min in the presence of extracellular Ca2+). We thus used 50 μm KB-R7943 in the present study. Statistics—Numerical data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Differences between groups with different experimental protocols were evaluated by use of ANOVA for repeated measures. When a significant difference was indicated between the groups, individual comparisons at the same time point were performed using a Student's unpaired-t test. For all evaluations and comparisons, a p value less than 0.05 was taken as indicating statistical significance. In the smooth muscle of pig carotid artery 31P NMR was applied to measure intracellular phosphorus compounds. As shown in Fig. 1A, six major peaks were observed in 31P NMR spectra obtained in normal solution. The concentrations of PCr ([PCr]) and Pi ([Pi]) were 35.9 ± 4.0 and 27.2 ± 3.7%, respectively, relative to that of ATP ([ATP]) (n = 21). The [PCr] to [ATP] ratio is comparable to that reported for vascular smooth muscles (22Dillon P.F. Bárány M. Biochemistry of Smooth Muscle Contraction. Academic Press, San Diego1996: 393-404Crossref Google Scholar, 26Clark J.F. Dillon P.F. J. Vasc. Res. 1995; 32: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and agrees well with the notion that this ratio in smooth muscle depends on the physiological function (27Paul R.J. Lorenz J. Bolton T.B. Tomita T. Smooth Muscle Excitation. Academic Press, London.1996: 315-323Google Scholar), i.e. [PCr]/[ATP] is smaller in tonic than phasic smooth muscles. The chemical shifts of the Pi and β-ATP peaks were 4.86 ± 0.01 and –16.21 ± 0.01 ppm, respectively (n = 21). From these chemical shifts, pHi and [Mg2+]i were estimated to be 7.01 ± 0.02 pH units and 0.76 ± 0.01 mm, respectively. The chemical shifts of β- and γ-ATP peaks were –2.490 ± 0.003 and –7.556 ± 0.003 ppm, respectively (n = 21). The [Mg2+]i value in pig carotid artery smooth muscle was smaller than those estimated using the same methods in intestinal smooth muscle (taenia caeci: 0.84 mm). This [Mg2+]i value is significantly lower than in phasic smooth muscles (28Tashiro M. Konishi M. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 3358-3370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), suggesting that [Mg2+]i might play a role in characterizing smooth muscle function. In the PME region, the PME-1 peak was always predominant (29Boehm E.A. Clark J.F. Radda G.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C628-C635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but a second peak was occasionally distinguishable: PME-1, 6.79 ± 0.01 ppm (n = 21); PME-2, 6.27 ± 0.01 ppm (n = 15). Taking the pHi (∼7.0) into consideration (30Nakayama S. Hachisuka T. Itoh K. Matsumoto T. Tomita T. Jpn. J. Physiol. 1995; 45: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), the chemical shifts of PME-1 and 2 indicate that they arise from phosphorylethanolamine and phosphorylcholine, respectively. Amiloride Modulates [Mg2+]i in a Ca2+-dependent Manner—Amiloride is known to inhibit numerous Na+ transporters (11Benos D.J. Grinstein S. Na+/H+ Exchange. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1988: 121-136Google Scholar, 12Simchrowitz L. Kleyman T.R. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Kleyman T.R. Simchowitz L. Amiloride and Its Analogues. VCH Publishers Inc., New York1992: 9-24Google Scholar), including Na+-Mg2+ exchange (31Lüdi H. Schatzman H.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1987; 390: 362-382Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 32Féray J.-C. Garay R. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archiv.

We thus examined the effects of amiloride on [Mg2+]i regulation in pig carotid artery smooth muscle. As shown in Fig. 1B, the β-ATP peak was significantly (p < 0.05) shifted toward lower frequency (from –16.21 ± 0.01 to –16.25 ± 0.02 ppm, n = 6) 100 min after application of 1 mm amiloride. (Shifts of the β-ATP peak toward lower frequency correspond to decreases in [Mg2+]i and vice versa.) During the subsequent washout of amiloride for 100 min the β-ATP peak did not return to the initial resonance frequency, but rather further shifted toward lower frequency in some of the carotid artery preparations. Fig. 2 shows changes in [Mg2+]i (filled squares in A) and pHi (filled circles in B) induced by 1 mm amiloride application (n = 6) along with control experiments. Application of 1 mm amiloride decreased [Mg2+]i from 0.75 ± 0.01 mm to 0.66 ± 0.03 mm after 100 min (n = 6), corresponding to the lower frequency shift of the β-ATP peak. The subsequent washout did not restore [Mg2+]i, but rather decreased it for 100 min (0.61 ± 0.03 mm 75–100 min during washout: statistically different from the [Mg2+]i value 75–100 min during application of amiloride, p < 0.05). In two of the six carotid artery preparations, the effect of prolonged washout was examined. [Mg2+]i was restored after 200 min (0.72 mm before application of amiloride; 0.62 mm after 75 min, and 0.68 mm after 200 min of washout). With respect to pHi regulation, pHi was not significantly changed during application and washout of amiloride (filled circles in Fig. 2B). On the other hand, the control experiments show that [Mg2+]i (open squares in Fig. 2A) and pHi (open circles in Fig. 2B) were stable during continuous superfusion with normal solution for 250 min (n = 5). ATP is an important Mg2+ buffer in the intracellular environment. Decrease in [ATP] would release Mg2+ and vice versa. However, no significant change was observed during the application and washout of amiloride (Table I, A).Table IChanges in the concentration of high energy phosphates[ATP][PCr]A.

The time course of change is shown in Fig. 3. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ for 100 min had little effect on [Mg2+]i (0.76 ± 0.01 mm). When 1 mm amiloride was applied to the Ca2+-free solution, the maximal [Mg2+]i increase (0.81 ± 0.03 mm, n = 7) was observed 50–75 min. The data points with statistical significance (p < 0.05) compared with the [Mg2+]i value before amiloride application, are indicated by asterisks. During the subsequent washout of amiloride [Mg2+]i was quickly restored (0.74 ± 0.02 mm during 0–25 min; 0.72 ± 0.02 mm during 75–100 min). Neither pHi nor [ATP] were significantly changed throughout the experiment. Previously, we reported simultaneous estimation of [Mg2+]i and pHi from the chemical shifts of β- and γ-ATP. In order to reinforce the results obtained with amiloride, i.e. Ca2+-dependent modulation of [Mg2+]i, we also employed this estimation (see “Materials and Methods”). In Table II, [Mg2+]i and pHi values estimated using this method are compared with those estimated from the chemical shifts of β-ATP and Pi (the estimation mainly used in the present study). Both estimations showed essentially the same changes in [Mg2+]i and pHi, irrespective of Ca2+.Table IIEstimation of [Mg2+]i and pHi1) From β- and γ-ATP2) From β-ATP and Pi[Mg2+]ipHi[Mg2+]ipHimmmmA.

Open table in a new tab A Na+-H+Exchange Inhibitor DMA Had Little Effect on [Mg2+]i —To determine which Na+-transporter is responsible for the decrease in [Mg2+]i, we examined the effect of an amiloride derivative, DMA which has high inhibitory activity toward Na+-H+ exchange (11Benos D.J. Grinstein S. Na+/H+ Exchange. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1988: 121-136Google Scholar, 12Simchrowitz L. Kleyman T.R. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Kleyman T.R. Simchowitz L. Amiloride and Its Analogues. VCH Publishers Inc., New York1992: 9-24Google Scholar). In normal solution (containing 5.9 mmHCO3-), application of 0.1 mm DMA did not significantly change [Mg2+]i for 100 min (filled squares in Fig. 4). Also, this treatment did not significantly altered either pHi (open circles in Fig. 4) or [ATP] during application and subsequent washout (Table 1, B). When bicarbonate was removed from the extracellular solution (aerated with 100% O2), application of 0.1 mm DMA significantly lowered pHi (from 7.00 ± 0.01 to 6.80 ± 0.01 after 100 min, n = 3), with little influence on [Mg2+]i (0.74 ± 0.05 mm before application; 0.76 ± 0.01 mm 75–100 min during application). These results suggested that pHi was maintained by Na+-HCO3- symporter (34Aickin C.C. Thomas R.C. Proton Passage Across Cell Membrane, Ciba Foundation Symposium 139. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester1988: 3-22Google Scholar, 35Wray S. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: C213-C225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) under superfusion with the normal solution, when Na+-H+ exchange was inhibited by DMA. KB-R7943 Produced Essentially the Same Paradoxical Decrease in [Mg2+]i—KB-R7943 is a newly synthesized inhibitor of Na+-Ca2+ exchange (36Iwamoto T. Watano T. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22391-22397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 37Watano T. Kimura J. Morita T. Nakanishi H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), and Na+-Mg2+ is known to share many characteristic features with Na+-Ca2+ exchange (18Flatman P.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 259-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In normal solution containing 2.4 mm Ca2+, application of 50 μm KB-R7943 decreased [Mg2+]i from 0.76 ± 0.02 to 0.70 ± 0.01 mm (statistically significantly: p < 0.05, n = 5) after 100 min (filled squares in Fig. 5A). The subsequent washout further decreased [Mg2+]i (to 0.65 ± 0.02 mm 25–50 min during washout, statistically different from the [Mg2+]i value 75–100 min during application of KB-R7943, p < 0.05). In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, application of KB-R7943 (50 μm) caused a marginal increase in [Mg2+]i (n = 4, Fig. 5B). (The three [Mg2+]i values 0–75 min during application of KB-R7943, statistically differ from that before application of the drug in the absence of Ca2+. Furthermore, each [Mg2+]i value during application of KB-R7943 is statistically significantly greater (p < 0.05) in the absence than the presence of Ca2+.) Whether the extracellular solution contained Ca2+ or not, no significant change was observed in pHi (open circles in Fig. 5) and [ATP] (Table 1, C) ([ATP] data in the absence of Ca2+ not shown). In the presence or absence of Ca2+, KB-R7943 and amiloride evoked essentially the same responses on the parameters measurable with 31P NMR. Effect of Na+Removal on [Mg2+]i Regulation—Fig. 6A shows effects of blocking Na+-dependent transporters by removal of extracellular Na+. Unlike the guinea pig taenia caeci case (24Nakayama S. Nomura H. Tomita T. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 833-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the Pi peak was resolvable in pig carotid artery throughout the experiment. pHi was thus estimated from the chemical shift of Pi. In the presence of Ca2+, total substitution of extracellular Na+ with NMDG caused a small increase in [Mg2+]i (from 0.76 ± 0.02 to 0.86 ± 0.06 mm, n = 4) after 200 min, while pHi gradually decreased to 6.76 ± 0.04 (from 7.01 ± 0.01). The subsequent readmission of Na+ fully restored both [Mg2+]i and pHi within 50 min. These changes in [Mg2+]i and pHi agree well with the previous results observed in the guinea pig taenia caeci, in which Na+-Mg2+ exchange in the plasma membrane is the primary mechanism to maintain low [Mg2+]i (20Nakayama S. Tomita T. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 435: 559-572Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 26Clark J.F. Dillon P.F. J. Vasc. Res. 1995; 32: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In order to confirm that amiloride decreases [Mg2+]i through modulation of Na+-dependent [Mg2+]i regulatory mechanism(s), the drug (1 mm) was applied simultaneously with removal of extracellular Na+ (in the presence of 2.4 mm Ca2+). Fig. 6B shows changes in [Mg2+]i and pHi during application and subsequent washout. During exposure to the Na+-free solution containing 1 mm amiloride for 100 min, [Mg2+]i did not decrease, but rather increased (from 0.76 ± 0.02 to 0.81 ± 0.02 mm, n = 4, p < 0.05). In the same time pHi gradually decreased, but the fall of pHi during Na+ removal was significantly less in the presence of amiloride (p < 0.05, unpaired Student's t test). The subsequent readmission of extracellular Na+ along with washing out amiloride, restored pHi consistently, while this treatment transiently decreased [Mg2+]i to below the initial concentration (to 0.72 ± 0.02 mm during 50–75 min). In one carotid artery preparation, essentially the same results for [Mg2+]i and pHi were obtained with KB-R7943. These results agree well with the notion that Na+-coupled transporters are involved in the amiloride- and KB-R7943-induced paradoxical decreases in [Mg2+]i. Two pathways have been proposed for Mg2+ transport across the plasma membrane in smooth muscle: 1) Na+ (gradient)-dependent Mg2+ extrusion (Na+-Mg2+ exchange); 2) Na+-independent passive Mg2+ flux, depending on the Mg2+ concentration gradient, and blocked by extracellular Ca2+ (20Nakayama S. Tomita T. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 435: 559-572Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 38Nakayama S. Tomita T. J. Physiol. 1990; 421: 363-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The latter pathway may correspond to the Mg2+- and Ca2+-permeable channel recently identified (39Nadler M.J.S. Hermosura M.C. Inabe K. Perraud A.-L. Zhu Q. Strokes A.J. Kurosaki T. Kinet J.-P. Penner R. Scharenberg A.M. Fleig A. Nature. 2001; 411: 590-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar) or ion channels of similar ionic permeability. In the presence of extracellular Ca2+, i.e. the normal solution in the present study, the former, Na+-Mg2+ exchange is considered to be the major Mg2+ pathway. The Na+-Mg2+ exchange mechanism is considered to maintain low [Mg2+]i against the electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane (18Flatman P.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 259-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 20Nakayama S. Tomita T. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 435: 559-572Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that amiloride, an inhibitor for Na+-Ca2+ exchange, also blocks Na+-Mg2+ exchange, and consequently elevate [Mg2+]i under Ca2+-free conditions in which passive Mg2+ flux pathways are accelerated (24Nakayama S. Nomura H. Tomita T. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 833-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The present 31P NMR measurements in pig carotid artery smooth muscle unexpectedly revealed decrease during applications of Na+-Ca2+ exchange inhibitors, i.e. amiloride or KB-R7943, to the normal extracellular solution (containing 2.4 mm Ca2+). Using 31P NMR, we could also continuously monitor two factors which may affect [Mg2+]i by changing Mg2+ buffering: 1) ATP itself is known as an important intracellular Mg2+ buffer, 2) while pHi has also been proposed to modulate the intracellular Mg2+ buffering capacity (40Freudenrich C.C. Murphy E. Levy L.A. London R.E. Lieberman M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C1024-C1030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, neither of these significantly changed throughout the experiments with amiloride (Fig. 2B, Fig. 5A, and Table I). The fact of no significant pHi change also rules out possible [Mg2+]i modulation via co-operation of Na+-dependent transporters, like [Ca2+]i regulation in cardiac myocytes, i.e. coupling of Na+-H+ and Na+-Ca2+ exchange via [Na+]i (41Vaughan-Jones R.D. Lederer W. Eisner D.A. Nature. 1983; 303: 522-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We should therefore consider other mechanisms to explain the paradoxical decrease in [Mg2+]i. Alteration of Na+-gradient across the plasma membrane would also affect Na+-Mg2+ exchange. In intestinal smooth muscle, using 87Rb NMR we have previously shown amiloride (1 mm) to have little effect on intracellular Rb+ accumulation, an index of Na+-K+ pump activity. Further, intracellular Mg2+ is depleted through a passive Mg2+ flux pathway during exposure to Mg2+-free and Ca2+-free solutions even in the presence of 1 mm amiloride (21Nakayama S. Nomura H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 488: 1-12Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Iwamoto et al. (36Iwamoto T. Watano T. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22391-22397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) have reported that Na+-K+ pump activity is hardly impaired by KB-R7943 (up to 30 μm). This drug also does not significantly influence Na+-H+ exchange or passive 22Na uptake (36Iwamoto T. Watano T. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22391-22397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). It has recently been reported that KB-R7943 suppress the Na+-independent passive Mg2+ pathways at concentrations (∼20 μm) similar to those used in the present study (42Almulla H.A. Ellis D. Flatman P.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 547: C19Google Scholar). This effect may account for the paradoxical decrease in [Mg2+]i upon applications of KB-R7943 in the presence of Ca2+. Amiloride might have a similar effect on the passive Mg2+ pathway. However, both KB-R7943 and amiloride significantly increases [Mg2+]i when extracellular Ca2+ is removed. Furthermore, removal of extracellular Na+ prevented the paradoxical decrease in [Mg2+]i induced by these drugs, even in the presence of Ca2+ (the data for KB-R7943 not shown). Taken together, it is suggested that Na+-dependent Mg2+ pathways, presumably Na+-Mg2+ exchange is involved in the paradoxical decrease in [Mg2+]i. KB-R7943 is an isothiourea derivative, structurally distinct from amiloride derivatives, but has been shown to block Na+-Ca2+ exchange (36Iwamoto T. Watano T. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22391-22397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 37Watano T. Kimura J. Morita T. Nakanishi H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). These drugs showed similar Ca2+-dependent modulation of [Mg2+]i, i.e. paradoxical decrease in [Mg2+]i in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (Figs. 2A and 5A) and rise in [Mg2+]i in the absence of Ca2+ (Figs. 3 and 5B). DMA, a Na+-H+ exchange inhibitor and a derivative of amiloride, did not produce such Ca2+-dependent modulation of [Mg2+]i regulation, suggesting involvement of some interaction of divalent cations. A non-selective divalent cation-binding site has recently been shown to play a role in intracellular Mg2+-dependent regulation of maxi K+ channels (43Shi J. Krishnamoorthy G. Yang Y. Hu L. Chaturvedi N. Harilal D. Qin J. Cui J. Nature. 2002; 418: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 44Xia X.M. Zeng X. Lingle C.J. Nature. 2002; 418: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). It is considered that a similar divalent cation binding site of Na+-Mg2+ exchanger may account for effects of Na+-Ca2+ exchange inhibitors on Na+-Mg2+ and their Ca2+-dependent modulations. Another possibility we should also consider is Mg2+ transport via the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger itself. There is numerous literature for Na+-dependent Ca2+ movements across the plasma membrane in vascular and non-vascular smooth muscles (45Blaustein M.P. Allen T.J.A. Noble D. Reuter H. Sodium-Calcium Exchange. Oxford University Press, Oxford1989: 208-232Google Scholar, 46Aickin C.C. Brading A.F. Allen T.J.A. Noble D. Reuter H. Sodium-Calcium Exchange. Oxford University Press, Oxford1989: 233-245Google Scholar). Expression of NCX1 has recently been shown in intestinal smooth muscle (47Hisamitsu T. Ohata H. Kawanishi T. Iwamoto T. Shigekawa M. Amano H. Yamada S. Momose K. Life Sci. 2001; 69: 2775-2787Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Also, Konishi and co-workers (48Tashiro M. Konishi M. Iwamoto T. Shigekawa M. Kurihara S. Pflügers Arch. 2002; 440: 819-827Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar) have reported that high-(extracellular) Mg2+-induced [Mg2+]i rise in fibroblasts is attenuated by transfection of NCX1 or NCX3 (the degree of attenuation: NCX1 > NCX3), but that this attenuation is not seen in Na+-free solutions. These results indicate that Mg2+ might be extruded via Na+-Ca2+ exchange, although this possibility is less likely in intact smooth muscle for the following reasons. Firstly, the Na+-dependent Mg2+ extrusion rate in fibroblasts seems relatively low compared with the paradoxical decrease in [Mg2+]i with amiloride or KB-R7943, taking the expression level (by ∼15-fold (49Iwamoto T. Pan Y. Wakabayashi S. Imagawa T. Yamanaka H.I. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13609-13615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar)) of NCX1 into consideration. Secondly, experiments on Na+-dependent Mg2+ extrusion have been carried out in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (48Tashiro M. Konishi M. Iwamoto T. Shigekawa M. Kurihara S. Pflügers Arch. 2002; 440: 819-827Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the presence of Ca2+, NCX exchangers presumably transport Ca2+ participating in their original role. Thirdly, the resting [Mg2+]i (estimated in normal solution) is not altered by transfection of NCX (48Tashiro M. Konishi M. Iwamoto T. Shigekawa M. Kurihara S. Pflügers Arch. 2002; 440: 819-827Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It seems likely that its level is determined by another Na+-dependent transporter protein for Mg2+. The present results that amiloride and KB-R7943 affected [Mg2+]i regulation but DMA did not, prompt us to speculate that many drugs known for affecting Na+-Ca2+ exchange might have similar effects on Na+-Mg2+ exchange, and might consequently decrease [Mg2+]i. It is well known that Mg2+ deficiency is an important risk factor for ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (1Shattock M.J. Hearse D.J. Fry C.H. J. Am. Coll. Nutr. 1987; 6: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 4Yang C.-Y. Stroke. 1998; 29: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 5McGuigan J.A.S. Elder H.Y. Günzel D. Schlue W.-R. J. Clin. Bas. Cardiol. 2002; 5: 5-22Google Scholar). Further, it has frequently been pointed out that Mg2+ homeostasis is affected by diabetes mellitus, a critical complication for ischemic diseases (2Paolisso G. Barbagallo M. Am. J. Hypertens. 1997; 10: 368-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 3Kao W.H.L. Folsom A.R. Neito F.J. Mo J.-P. Watson R.L. Brancati F.L. Arch. Intern.

Clinically, amiloride at low concentrations (<1 μm) is used as K+-sparing diuretics to treat patients with hypertension and heart failure (51Feldman G.M. Drewnowska K. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Kleyman T.R. Simchowitz L. Amiloride and Its Analogues. VCH Publishers Inc., New York1992: 265-277Google Scholar). The therapeutic concentration does not seem high enough to modulate the properties of Na+-Mg2+ exchange, however, chemical modification of amiloride reducing the inhibitory effects on Na+-Ca2+ exchange, like 6-iodoamiloride (52Haddy F.J. Pamnani M.B. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Kleyman T.R. Simchowitz L. Amiloride and Its Analogues. VCH Publishers Inc., New York1992: 279-300Google Scholar), would produce a more preferable drug in terms of [Mg2+]i homeostasis, thereby broadening the therapeutic concentration range. In addition, it may be noteworthy that due to inhibition of reverse mode Na+-Ca2+ exchange, both KB-R7943 and amiloride can be also used as cardioprotective against Ca2+ overload. It is speculated that the inhibitory effect of KB-R7943 on the reverse mode Na+-Ca2+ exchange might be a key to solve their Ca2+-dependent action on [Mg2+]i regulation. In conclusion, using 31P NMR we here demonstrate that amiloride and KB-R7943 modulate [Mg2+]i in a Ca2+-dependent manner. [Mg2+]i significantly decreases in the presence of Ca2+ (normal conditions), whereas [Mg2+]i increases only in its absence. These treatments had little effect on ATP and pHi. It is suggested that these drugs directly affect Na+-Mg2+ exchange to produce the Ca2+-dependent modulation of [Mg2+]i. Also, it is likely that many inhibitory agents for Na+-Ca2+ have similar effects on [Mg2+]i regulation. We thank Drs. Peter W. Flatman (Edinburgh University) and Masato Konishi (Tokyo Medical University, Japan) for useful discussions and improving the manuscript, and also to Nagoya Meat Hygiene Laboratory (Nagoya, Japan) for a continuous supply of pig carotid artery.

It has been thought that this 5′-UTR functions by regulating translation possibly using an internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-mediated mechanism. However, in the present study we found no evidence that the 5′-UTR sequence of PDGF-B mRNA contains any IRES activity. Instead, we found that the 5′-UTR sequence of PDGF-B functions as a promoter both constitutively and upon induction in a variety of cell lines. The 5′-UTR sequence contains two promoters (termed P1 and P2) when only the 5′-UTR sequence is analyzed. In the presence of the upstream TATA-box-containing promoter (P0), P1 and P0 promoters are integrated into one promoter, whereas the P2 promoter still functions. The full promoter with combined P0, P1, and P2 produced two transcripts, with the major one having the full-length 5′-UTR and the minor one the short 5′-UTR. The integrated P0/P1 promoter and P2 promoter are likely responsible for producing the endogenous 3.8- and 2.8-kb PDGF-B mRNAs that are detected in cultured human renal microvascular endothelial cells, a few tumor cells, and rat brain tissues. Furthermore, we detected the 2.8-kb PDGF-B mRNA in erythroleukemia K562 cells upon 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced differentiation. Considering that the 5′-UTR in the 3.8-kb mRNA contains no IRES activity and inhibits cap-dependent translation, we believe that the endogenous 2.8-kb mRNA produced from the 5′-UTR promoter is likely the major template responsible for protein production both constitutively and upon induction. We also found that the transcription from the 5′-UTR P2 promoter might be coordinated by the major upstream P0 promoter upon stimulation. Based on these observations, we propose that the TATA-containing P0 promoter and the 5′-UTR promoter work together to tightly control the expression of PDGF-B.

They function as homodimers or heterodimers to selectively signal through cell surface tyrosine kinase receptors (PDGFR-α and PDGFR-β) and regulate diverse cellular functions (1Betsholtz C.

PDGF in general has been implicated to play an important role in embryogenesis, wound healing, as well as in the development of several serious disorders, including certain malignancies, atherosclerosis, and various fibrotic conditions. Understanding the mechanism of regulation of PDGF expression is, thus, important for designing strategies to control the expression of PDGF in such disorders. platelet-derived growth factor Schneider's Drosophila cell line 2 5′-untranslated region internal ribosome entry site human rhinovirus luciferase 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate human renal microvascular endothelial cell transforming growth factor β rapid amplification of cDNA ends cytomegalovirus 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid ribonuclease protection assay coding region instability determinant. The regulation of human PDGF-B expression is complex. The human PDGF-B gene contains seven exons spanning 24 kb of the genomic DNA on human chromosome 22. Transcription is normally driven by a short basal TATA-containing promoter that is responsible for production of the regular 3.8-kb transcript (4Ratner L. Thielan B. Collins T.

However, this mRNA contains a GC-rich 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of 1022 bases with three AUG codons and a highly stable secondary structure. This type of 5′-UTR sequences normally have an inhibitory effect on translation. Indeed, it has been found that the high level of the 3.8-kb PDGF-B mRNA is not accompanied by detectable proteins in many cell lines (8Betsholtz C. Johnsson A. Heldin C.H. Westermark B. Lind P.

In contrast, the PDGF-B protein is detected in some cell lines despite the presence of low levels of the 3.8-kb mRNAs (11Wang J. Coltrera M.D. Gown A.M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 560-564PubMed Google Scholar). An alternative 2.8-kb transcript that lacks the long 5′-UTR sequence was detected in a few tumor cell lines and was shown to be associated with high level of PDGF-B protein (12Sasahara M. Amano S. Sato H. Yang J.G. Hayase Y. Kaneko M. Sato I. Suzaki M. Hazama F. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1571-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The 2.8-kb mRNA was also reported in cultured human renal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs) upon stimulation with transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (13Fen Z. Daniel T.O. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 953-959PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the 2.8-kb mRNA is degraded in a protein synthesis-dependent pathway and can be selectively enriched by cycloheximide treatment. The 2.8-kb mRNAs have also been detected in rat brain at certain stages of brain development, and its detection was associated with the increased level of PDGF-B protein (12Sasahara M. Amano S. Sato H. Yang J.G. Hayase Y. Kaneko M. Sato I. Suzaki M. Hazama F. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1571-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been suggested that the expression of PDGF-B mRNA with short 5′-UTR sequences possibly exists widely in non-transformed tissues in vivo (12Sasahara M. Amano S. Sato H. Yang J.G. Hayase Y. Kaneko M. Sato I. Suzaki M. Hazama F. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1571-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). One of the major sites of PDGF synthesis is within bone marrow megakaryocytes, the platelets progenitor cells. Because human erythroleukemia K562 cells are differentiated into megakaryocytes upon TPA stimulation, regulation of PDGF-B expression in K562 cells has been extensively studied. The 3.8-kb species of PDGF-B mRNA was dramatically increased upon TPA-induced differentiation (14Colamonici O.R. Trepel J.B. Vidal C.A. Neckers L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1847-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Cis-elements and transcription factors, which are responsible for such induction, were also identified for the TATA-containing promoter (15Jin H.M. Brady M.L. Fahl W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7563-7567Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16Kujoth G.C. Robinson D.F. Fahl W.E. Cell Growth & Differ. 1998; 9: 523-534PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the 5′-UTR of the 3.8-kb transcript has been reported to contain an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), which became more active in K562 cells upon differentiation into megakaryotic cells (17Sella O. Gerlitz G. Le S.Y. Elroy-Stein O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5429-5440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Bernstein J. Sella O. Le S.Y. Elroy-Stein O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9356-9362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The IRES-mediated translation initiation works by directly recruiting the translational machinery to the nearby AUG translation start codon and therefore effectively avoids the inhibition of the long structured 5′-UTRs (reviewed in Refs. 19Hellen C.U. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1593-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 20Sachs A.B. Cell. 2000; 101: 243-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 21Vagner S. Galy B. Pyronnet S. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). However, whether this IRES really exists is questionable due to the inevitable technical problem associated with the traditional dicistronic test (22Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1899-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 23Schneider R. Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8238-8246Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Like most of the previous cellular IRES studies, the 5′-UTR of PDGF-B is claimed to contain IRES based on transfection of artificial dicistronic plasmid followed by Northern blot analysis. Due to its low sensitivity, the use of Northern blot cannot differentiate IRES from cryptic promoter or potential splicing activities, all of which generate the same effect in dicistronic DNA test (25Han B. Zhang J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7372-7384Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Herein, we report our surprising finding that the 2.8-kb human PDGF-B mRNA, previously detected in HRMECs (13Fen Z. Daniel T.O. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 953-959PubMed Google Scholar), is also produced in K562 cells upon TPA-induced differentiation. This transcript represents a minor species in Northern blot analysis. However, treatment of cycloheximide stabilizes the 2.8-kb transcript and enables its clear detection by Northern blot, 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends, and RNase protection assay. Using luciferase reporter promoter assay and Northern blot analysis, we demonstrated that the DNA sequence encoding the 5′-UTR of the long PDGF-B mRNA contains promoters that function in various cell lines and produces two mRNA species with a medium and a short 5′-UTR, respectively. However, in the presence of the upstream TATA-containing promoter, only the transcript with a short 5′-UTR was produced in addition to the transcript with the full-length 5′-UTR, which may explain why only the 3.8-kb and the 2.8-kb endogenous mRNAs are produced. On the other hand, the 5′-UTR sequence of the long PDGF-B transcript severely inhibits translation and does not display any IRES activity when tested using more stringent methods such as RNA transfection and promoterless dicistronic assay. Therefore, the 3.8-kb mRNA may contribute little, if any, to the production of PDGF-B protein. Based on the above observations, we conclude that the major TATA-containing promoter and the promoters in the 5′-UTR work together to control the expression of the 2.8-kb PDGF-B transcript in a variety of cells as an effective source of mRNA for protein production. Tight control of the production of the 2.8-kb mRNA and its stability may be used widely to control PDGF-B expression, both constitutively and upon stimulation.

The human IMAGE cDNA (ID 5174750 and GenBank™ accession number BC029822) containing the partial 5′-UTR and the entire coding region of PDGF-B were purchased from Open Biosystems. Construction of Plasmids—The plasmid pBLHHCAT was a gift from Dr. William E. Fahl (McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin Medical School, Madison, WI). The plasmid contains a 5.5-kb PDGF-B DNA fragment (HindIII-HindIII), which includes the full-length 5′-UTR and the proximal promoter (5Jin H.M. Robinson D.F. Liang Y. Fahl W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28648-28654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA sequence for the long 5′-UTR was amplified using the following primers: JB7, 5′-CCCCACTAGTGGCAACTTCTCCTCC and OS35, 5′-CCCCCCATGGCGACTCCGGGCCCGGCCC (18Bernstein J. Sella O. Le S.Y. Elroy-Stein O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9356-9362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The purified PCR product was cloned into pRF, and pRF(-P) vector (25Han B. Zhang J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7372-7384Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), resulting in pR-PDGF-F and pR-PDGF-F(-P), respectively. To construct the plasmid containing the 5′ region, -807 to +1022, of PDGF-B (numbered relative to the known transcription start site in the remaining text unless otherwise specified), pHHCAT was first digested with HpaI and XhoI to isolate a 1.2-kb fragment that includes -807 to +475, which was then used to replace the SpeI/XhoI fragment in pR-PDGF-F(-P). To obtain the pRF(-P)-based construct that contains -807 to +82 of PDGF-B 5′ region, a NheI/AvrII fragment isolated from the -807 to + 1022 construct was cloned into pRF(-P) at the NheI/NcoI sites. Mutagenesis of the TATA box was performed using the Stratagene QuikChange XL mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. The sense primer for mutagenesis was 5′-CGCACTCTCCCTTCTCCCTCTAGATGGCCGGAACAGCTGAAAG-3′ (with mutations shown underlined and in boldface). This primer changed the palindrome TTTATAAA sequence (the overlapping TATA box in both sense and antisense strand) into CTCTAGAT sequence that bears an XbaI site but shows no known binding sites for any transcription factors. The 5′-end deletions of the 5′-UTR were generated using PCR for constructs containing the sequence from +75, +150, +225, +300, +375, +525, +600, or +675, to +1022. The other constructs containing sequence from +475, +769, or +862, to +1022 were obtained by deleting the SpeI/XhoI, SpeI/BamHI, and SpeI/SmaI fragments from the pR-PDGF-F (-P), respectively. The 3′-end deletion constructs containing +1 to +300, +1 to +395, +1 to +475, and +1 to +769 were obtained by deleting the RsrII/NcoI, SmaI/NcoI, XhoI/NcoI, and BamHI/NcoI fragments from pR-PDGF-F(-P), respectively. The construct containing +1 to +675 region of the 5′-UTR was obtained using PCR. Dicistronic constructs containing poly(A) for in vitro transcription (Fig. 4) were engineered using the vector pSP64 Poly(A), which has 30-bp dA:dT. The EcoRV-XbaI fragment of the pRF vector containing Renilla luciferase gene was first cloned into pSP64 Poly(A) vector at the XbaI and blunted HindIII sites to generate the plasmid pSP-RA30. The XbaI fragment of pR-HRV-F (25Han B. Zhang J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7372-7384Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) containing the IRES of HRV and the firefly luciferase gene was then isolated and cloned into pSP-RA30 at the XbaI site to generate pSP-R-HRV-FA30. The pSP-RFA30 plasmid was obtained by removing the IRES sequence of HRV from the pSP-R-HRVFA30 by digestion with SpeI and NcoI. To engineer pSP-R-PDGF-FA30, the SpeI-NcoI fragment from pR-PDGF-F, which contains the +1 to +1022 sequence, was used to replace the HRV IRES fragment in pRHRV-FA30 construct. Monocistronic constructs containing poly(A) were also obtained from pSp64 poly(A). First, the XbaI fragment containing the 5′-UTR sequence of PDGF-B and the firefly luciferase-encoding sequence from pR-PDGF-F was cloned into pSP64 Poly(A), resulting in pSP-PDGFFA30. Deletion of SpeI/BamHI, SpeI/SmaI, and SpeI/MluI regions from pSP-PDGF-FA30 resulted in pSP-R-769-FA30, pSP-R-862-FA30, and pSP-R-983-FA30, which contain the +769 to +1022, +862 to +1022, and +983 to +1022 sequences of the 5′-UTR of PDGF-B, respectively. The pSP-R-375-FA30 construct, which contains the +375 to +1022 region of the 5′-UTR, was constructed by cloning a PCR fragment into the SpeI/NcoI site of pSP-PDGF-FA30. All the above constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. In Vitro Transcription and Translation—In vitro transcription and translation were performed as previously described (25Han B. Zhang J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7372-7384Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The pSP64 poly(A)-based dicistronic and monocistronic plasmids were linearized by using EcoRI. The capped transcripts were synthesized using the Sp6 RNA polymerase transcription system in the presence of 1 mm m7GpppG. DNA templates were digested using DNase, and the in vitro transcripts were purified using a Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit and quantified. For in vitro translation, 25 ng of the capped RNA transcripts was used to program translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in a final volume of 10 μl. Translation products were measured for firefly luciferase activities. Cell Culture, DNA, and RNA Transfection—HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, whereas H1299 and K562 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 media both supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2. DNA transfection in both HeLa and H1299 cells were performed with LipofectAMINE plus reagents according to the manufacture's protocol. In a 24-well plate, ∼1 × 105 cells/well were plated and transfected with 0.4 μg of DNA. Cells were harvested 24 h following transfection for luciferase assay. RNA transfection was performed using the cationic liposome-mediated method as previously described (25Han B. Zhang J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7372-7384Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼2 × 105 cells/well were seeded onto 6-well plates on the day before transfection. Cells were washed once with Opti-MEM I-reduced serum medium (Invitrogen) and left in the incubator with some medium during preparation of the liposome-polynucleotide complexes. One milliliter of Opti-MEM I medium in a 12 × 75-mm polystyrene snap-cap tube was mixed with 12.5 μg of Lipofectin reagent and 5 μg of capped mRNA. The liposome/RNA/medium mixture was immediately added to cells. Eight hours following transfection, cells were harvested and processed for luciferase analysis. Transient Transfection of K562 Cells—Transient transfections of K562 cells were performed using electroporation. K562 cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in the same buffer at 107 cells per 0.4 ml. For each electroporation, 0.4 ml of cell suspension was mixed with 20 μg of constructs and 1.0 μg of pCMV-βgal in a final volume of 0.5 ml. Each electroporation pool received an electric pulse of 240 V and 1025 microfarads. After electroporation, the cells were incubated in 20 ml of prewarmed medium containing 20% serum for 24 h. The cells were then divided into two dishes with one supplemented with TPA (2 ng/ml) and other the same volume of solvent (ethanol) as a control. Forty-eight hours after TPA addition, the cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in passive lysis buffer and dual-luciferase, and β-galactosidase activity were determined. Northern Blot Analysis—Subconfluent H1299 cells in 10-cm plates were transfected with 4 μg/plate constructs using LipofectAMINE Plus. Twenty-four hours following transfection, the total RNAs were extracted using an RNeasy Mini kit and digested with RNase-free DNase to remove residual plasmid DNA. The poly(A) RNAs were then isolated from 250 μg of total RNAs using an Oligotex mRNA Mini kit. One-fifth of the mRNAs were separated in 1% agarose gels in the presence of formaldehyde and MOPS buffer and blotted onto MAGNA nylon membranes. The blots were then hybridized with a 32P-labeled firefly luciferase DNA probe (1656 bp), which was isolated by cleaving pRF with NcoI and XbaI and labeled using the Rediprime II random prime labeling system. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was also detected using specific probes as a control. For Northern blot analysis of PDGF-B expression in K562 cells, the total RNA was prepared from normal and differentiated K562 cells. The differentiation of K562 cells into megakaryocytes was induced by TPA (2 ng/ml) treatment for 2 days. Cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) was added to the medium on the third day following TPA treatment to stabilize the 2.8-kb mRNA. The poly(A) mRNA was isolated, and ∼2 μg of mRNA of each sample was used for Northern blot analysis as described above. The probe used for Northern blot was a 2-kb fragment isolated from pSM1 (24Clarke M.F. Westin E. Schmidt D. Josephs S.F. Ratner L. Wong-Staal F. Gallo R.C. Reitz Jr., M.S. Nature. 1984; 308: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) by BamHI digestion. PCR Analysis—Determination of the 5′-end of the 2.8-kb species was performed with the 5′ RACE system for rapid amplification of cDNA ends using the method provided by the supplier. Briefly, the first cDNA strand was synthesized using 5 μg of total RNA isolated from K562 cells that was cultured with TPA for 2 days and subsequently cultured with both TPA and cycloheximide for another 16 h. The primer used for cDNA synthesis is human PDGF-B-specific antisense primer, 5′-CCACTGTCTCACACTTG-3′, located at 548 bases downstream of the translation start codon. The primers used for first-round PCR were 5′ RACE Abridged Anchor Primer from the supplier (36 bases) and human PDGF-B-specific antisense primer with a sequence of 5′-GCTTCTTCCGCACAAT-3′, located 488 bases downstream of the translation start codon. The primers used for the final round PCR were Abridged Universal Amplification Primer from the supplier and PDGF-B-specific primer, 5′-CTGACCAGACGCAGGTA-3′, located at 56 bases downstream of the translation start codon. Takara Taq polymerase and GC buffer II were used for PCR amplification. The reaction conditions were 94 °C for 2 min followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. The PCR products were then purified, blunted with Klenow, and then cloned using the PCR Zero Blunt Cloning kit. Individual clones were isolated and sequenced to determine the transcription start sites. Determination of the 5′-end of the longer transcript from the pRPDGF-F(-P) transcription was performed by RT-PCR. About 5 μg of total RNA isolated from pR-PDGF-F and pR-PDGF-F(-P)-transfected H1299 cells was used. The first strand of cDNA was synthesized using an antisense primer targeting firefly luciferase mRNA located 78 bases downstream of the translation start codon. PCR amplification was performed using antisense primer located at +675 and three sense primers located at +150, +225, +300, and +375 of the 5′-UTR of PDGF-B, respectively. Ribonuclease Protection Assay—RPA was performed using the RPAIII kit according to the supplier's instructions. Briefly, the RNA probe was produced by first cloning into pGEM-4Z at the EcoRI and HindIII site the region -118 to +241 (numbered relative to the translation start site) of PDGF-B derived from the Image 5174750 (National Institutes of Health) cDNA clone by PCR. The resulting plasmid was linearized with EcoRI and transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of 0.5 mm each of ATP, GTP, UTP, and 0.01 mm CTP supplemented with 3.12 μm [α-32P]CTP. The 32P-labeled probe was digested with DNase and purified using a Sephadex G-25 Quick Spin column. About 0.5 × 106 cpm of the probe was hybridized to 2 μg of mRNA at 45 °C overnight followed by digestion with RNase T1/A at 37 °C. The reaction was then stopped, and the protected RNAs were precipitated before separation by electrophoresis on a 6% acrylamide/8 m urea gel for autoradiography. Production of the 2.8-kb mRNA of PDGF-B in K562 Cells upon TPA-induced Differentiation—Fen and Daniel (13Fen Z. Daniel T.O. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 953-959PubMed Google Scholar) first described that the 2.8-kb PDGF-B mRNA with truncation at the 5′-UTR (it has a 5′-UTR with only 15 bases) was produced in HRMECs upon either TGF-β or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation. It was thought that the 2.8-kb mRNA was degraded through a protein synthesis-dependent pathway, because treatment with cycloheximide selectively stabilized the 2.8-kb mRNA but not the 3.8-kb mRNA. Fen and Daniel also demonstrated that the 2.8-kb mRNA did not arise from post-transcriptional processing of the 3.8-kb mRNA but rather possibly from internal promoter within the 5′-UTR. The cycloheximide treatment did not enhance transcription of PDGF-B but rather increase the half-life of the 2.8-kb mRNA. The 5′-truncated PDGF-B mRNA was also observed in a few tumor cell lines and increased in rat brain at a certain stage of brain development, and the level of the 5′-truncated mRNA was shown to be associated with PDGF-B protein level (12Sasahara M. Amano S. Sato H. Yang J.G. Hayase Y. Kaneko M. Sato I. Suzaki M. Hazama F. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1571-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that the 2.8-kb mRNA of PDGF-B may also be produced in K562 cells upon TPA-induced differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we first performed Northern blot analysis of the endogenous PDGF-B transcript in K562 cells and demonstrated that a major transcript of 3.8 kb was detected when K562 cells were treated with TPA for 2–3 days (Fig. 1A, lane 3). A minor transcript of 2.8 kb was also evident (lane 3) and more pronounced with longer exposure (data not shown). When cells were treated with cycloheximide for 6 or 16 h following TPA treatment, the 2.8-kb mRNA increased significantly (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 5). Treatment of K562 cells with cycloheximide alone, however, did not enhance expression of either mRNA species (Fig. 1A, lane 2), suggesting that cycloheximide alone did not affect PDGF-B transcription. Therefore, the TPA-stimulated K562 cells displayed a similar profile of PDGF-B transcription as HRMECs. To map the 5′-end of the 2.8-kb PDGF-B mRNAs induced in differentiated K562 cells, we performed 5′ RACE using RNAs isolated from K562 cells following TPA and cycloheximide treatment. After two rounds of PCR using nested PDGF-B-specific primers, we obtained a single PCR product (Fig. 1B, lane 2). The PCR product was cloned, and 10 individual clones were selected for sequencing. Three of the clones were identical and start at 15 bases upstream of the translation start codon ATG, whe"

The phas promoter is normally constrained by a rotationally and translationally positioned nucleosome over its TATA region except during embryogenesis when it is potentiated by the presence of Phaseolus vulgaris ABI3-like factor (PvALF), a plant-specific transcription factor, and activated by an abscisic acid (ABA)-induced signal transduction cascade. Ectopic expression of PvALF and the supply of ABA in transgenic tobacco or Arabidopsis leaves can activate expression from phas. We confirmed by [3H]thymidine incorporation that active DNA replication occurred concomitant with the presence of PvALF and ABA. Arrest of DNA synthesis or S phase progression by infiltration of the leaves with replication inhibitors (hydroxyurea, roscovitine, mimosine) strongly inhibited transcriptional activation, especially the ABA-mediated activation step. Similarly, activation of endogenous Arabidopsis MAT and LEA genes in leaf tissue by the presence of ABA and ectopically expressed PvALF was inhibited by DNA replication arrest. No change in transcript levels on the arrest of replication was detected for abi1, abi2, and era1, negative regulators of the ABA signal transduction cascade or for cell cycle components ick1 and aip3. However, a reduction in transcript accumulation for the crucial ABA signaling effector, abi5, occurred upon DNA replication arrest (probably reflected in the decrease in MAT and LEA gene expression). Contrary to the conventional view that ABA inhibits DNA replication, our findings show that ABA acts in concert with S phase progression to activate gene expression.

Contrary to the conventional view that ABA inhibits DNA replication, our findings show that ABA acts in concert with S phase progression to activate gene expression. The promoter for the β-phaseolin gene (phas, which encodes the major storage protein of Phaseolus vulgaris) is subject to stringent spatial regulation with high levels of expression confined to embryogenesis (1Hall T.C. Chandrasekharan M.B. Li G. Shewry P.R. Casey R. Seed Proteins. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1999: 209-240Crossref Google Scholar). The presence of a rotationally and translationally constrained nucleosome over the TATA region contributes to transcriptional repression in vegetative tissues (2Li G. Chandler S.P. Wolffe A.P. Hall T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4772-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). During embryogenesis, strong module-specific promoter activity is achieved by a diverse array of DNA-protein interactions (3Li G. Bishop K.J. Chandrasekharan M.B. Hall T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7104-7109Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 4Chandrasekharan M.B. Bishop K.J. Hall T.C. Plant J. 2003; 33: 853-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). An early demonstration of the involvement of ABA 1The abbreviations used are: ABA, abscisic acid; DEX, dexamethasone; HU, hydroxyurea; LEA, late embryogenesis-abundant genes; MAT, maturation-specific genes; PvALF, Phaseolus vulgaris ABI3-like factor; RT, reverse transcriptase; MS, Murashige and Skoog.1The abbreviations used are: ABA, abscisic acid; DEX, dexamethasone; HU, hydroxyurea; LEA, late embryogenesis-abundant genes; MAT, maturation-specific genes; PvALF, Phaseolus vulgaris ABI3-like factor; RT, reverse transcriptase; MS, Murashige and Skoog. in phas regulation was the finding of an increase in phaseolin accumulation in excised embryos cultured in the presence of ABA (5Sussex I.M. Dale R.M.K. Rubenstein R.L. The Plant Seed: Development, Preservation, and Germination. Academic Press, New York.1979: 129-141Crossref Google Scholar). This was corroborated by the enhancement of transcription from the phas promoter upon incubation of transgenic tobacco seeds in the presence of exogenous ABA (6Bustos M.M. Iyer M. Gagliardi S.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Further, ABA has been shown to be essential for the activation step of transcription from the phas promoter in transgenic tobacco (3Li G. Bishop K.J. Chandrasekharan M.B. Hall T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7104-7109Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and, by data reported here, Arabidopsis. The involvement of ABA in gene activation dictates that components of its signal transduction pathway, including enzymes and transcription factors, play direct or indirect roles in this process. In Arabidopsis, genetic studies have revealed that several loci are involved in responses to ABA (7Koornneef M. Reuling G. Karssen C.M. Physiol. Plant. 1984; 61: 377-383Crossref Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 8Rock C.D. New Phytol. 2000; 148: 357-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 9Finkelstein R.R. Gampala S.S. Rock C.D. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: S15-S45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). ABA-insensitive (abi) mutants were isolated using genetic screens to obtain plants with altered sensitivity to germination on media containing inhibitory concentrations of ABA (7Koornneef M. Reuling G. Karssen C.M. Physiol. Plant. 1984; 61: 377-383Crossref Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Analyses of the abi3, abi4, and abi5 mutants revealed dramatic changes in seed development with marked effects on transcript accumulation for maturation-specific (MAT) and late embryogenesis-abundant (LEA) genes. Ectopic expression of ABI3 and the supply of exogenous ABA in Arabidopsis leaves have been shown to induce expression of both MAT and LEA genes (10Parcy F. Valon C. Raynal M. Gaubier-Comella P. Delsney M. Giraudat J. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1567-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Similarly, ectopic expression of PvALF (11Bobb A.J. Eiben H.G. Bustos M.M. Plant J. 1995; 8: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) in transgenic tobacco leaves, together with exogenous ABA, resulted in phas-driven GUS expression (3Li G. Bishop K.J. Chandrasekharan M.B. Hall T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7104-7109Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Fundamental questions are: how does PvALF gain access to the phas promoter, and how does the ABA-stimulated signal transduction cascade activate transcription? An attractive possibility is that PvALF accesses the chromatin-constrained promoter upon displacement of histones during replication (12Wolffe A.P. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2055-2063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Li G. Chandrasekharan M.B. Wolffe A.P. Hall T.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 46: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This concept is supported by the fact that DNA replication and endoreduplication are characteristic of bean embryogenesis where the phas gene is active (14Bino R.J. Lanteri S. Verhoeven H.A. Kraak H.L. Ann. Bot. (Lond.). 1993; 72: 181-187Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A role for DNA replication was further implicated by the observed decrease in de novo activation of the phas promoter by protein synthesis inhibitors in the presence of the replication inhibitors, aphidicolin and hydroxyurea (15Li G. Bishop K.J. Hall T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2062-2068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Analyses of Arabidopsis embryos during development revealed the presence of active DNA replication (16Raz V. Bergervoet J.H. Koornneef M. Development. 2001; 128: 243-252PubMed Google Scholar) concomitant with the initiation and accumulation of maturation-specific proteins. However, the current view pertaining to the mode of action of ABA is that it blocks cell division by preventing DNA replication and arresting the cell cycle at G1/S (17Dewitte W. Murray J.A.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Sci. 2003; 54: 235-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). To address the role of DNA replication (or S phase progression) in PvALF- and ABA-mediated activation, we employed replication inhibitors and also assessed the effect of S phase arrest on MAT and LEA gene activation. Our results show that S phase progression is required for PvALF- and ABA-mediated promoter activation and is critical for accumulation of the ABA signal effector ABI5. Plasmid Construction—The PvAlf coding region (2.3 kb) was obtained by digesting pJIT-PvAlf (11Bobb A.J. Eiben H.G. Bustos M.M. Plant J. 1995; 8: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) with SalI and SmaI. The released fragment was ligated to pTA7002 (18Aoyama T. Chua N.H. Plant J. 1997; 11: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar) that had been digested with SpeI, end-filled, and then digested with XhoI. The resulting construct, pGVG-PvAlf, yields glucocorticoid-inducible expression of PvALF. The PvAlf coding region was PCR-amplified to incorporate restriction sites for NcoI and SalI and was mobilized into pPCR-Script® (Amp) SK+ (Stratagene). Subsequently, the PvAlf coding region was released by partial digestion with NcoI followed by complete digestion with SalI and ligated to NcoI-SalI-digested vector pET-30(a) (Novagen) to obtain PvAlf/pET. Mobilization of the PvAlf region into pET-30(a) confers a His6 tag and an S-tag to PvALF upon translation (HisSPvALF). The 2.4-kb HisSPvAlf region was PCR-amplified to introduce restriction sites for AscI and PacI, and the PCR product was mobilized into pPCR-Script®. The HisSPvAlf fragment was then released using AscI and PacI and ligated to AscI-PacI-digested vector pER8 (19Zuo J. Niu Q.W. Chua N.H. Plant J. 2000; 24: 265-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting construct, pXVE-HisSPvAlf, yields the estrogen-inducible expression of PvALF in plants. Plant Transformation—Tobacco leaf discs from line 58.1A, homozygous for –1470phas/uidA (20van der Geest A.H.M. Hall G.E.J. Spiker S. Hall T.C. Plant J. 1994; 6: 413-423Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar), were transformed with Agrobacterium strain LBA4404 harboring pGVG-PvAlf (3Li G. Bishop K.J. Chandrasekharan M.B. Hall T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7104-7109Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thirty-four hygromycin-resistant (GR1–34) plants were grown to maturity. Following induction of PvALF expression with 90 μm dexamethasone (DEX; Sigma) and activation by 200 μm ABA (Calbiochem), leaves from lines GR3, GR24, and GR30 strongly expressed GUS. Homozygous line GR30 (GVG-PvALF::–1470phas/uidA) was used for the studies reported here. Arabidopsis plants (ecotype Columbia) were transformed (4Chandrasekharan M.B. Bishop K.J. Hall T.C. Plant J. 2003; 33: 853-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 21Bechtold N. Pelletier G. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 82: 259-266PubMed Google Scholar) with a mixed culture of Agrobacterium strain GV3101 harboring pXVE-HisSPvAlf or p–1470phas-uidA-3′/HM301K. Twenty-four hygromycin- and kanamycin-resistant T1 plants were obtained. Estradiol- and ABA-mediated induction, followed by histochemical staining, was conducted to evaluate the level and uniformity of phas-driven GUS expression. Genomic DNA blot analysis showed that line Alf5′-2, used in these studies, contained two copies of the two T-DNA cassettes (XVE-HisSPvAlf::Pnos-hptII-nos and –1470phas-uidA-3′::Pnos-nptII-nos). Hormone and Pharmacological Reagent Treatments—Tobacco leaves from 10–14-day-old seedlings, selected on MS medium containing 50 μg/ml hygromycin, were incubated in liquid basal MS medium with 90 μm DEX (Sigma) and 200 μm ABA (Calbiochem) for 24 h in the dark with gentle agitation at room temperature. The T3 seeds of Arabidopsis line Alf5′-2 were germinated on MS medium containing kanamycin (50 mg/liter) and hygromycin (25 mg/liter) and grown to the onset of rosette leaves. The seedlings were then transferred to MS medium without selection for 10 days. Leaves were subjected to a brief (∼2–3 min) vacuum infiltration in liquid basal MS medium containing 10 μm 17β-estradiol (Sigma) and 200 μm ABA and incubated for 10–12 h in the dark with agitation at room temperature. Control treatments of Alf5′-2 leaves with estradiol alone contained the ABA synthesis inhibitor fluridone (100 μm; Crescent Chemical Co.) to prevent endogenous ABA accumulation (22Gamble P.E. Mullet J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 23Siddiqui N.U. Chung H.J. Thomas T.L. Drew M.C. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 1181-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For treatments with DNA replication inhibitors, the MS medium containing leaves from lines GR-30 or Alf5′-2 induced with DEX or estradiol, respectively, and ABA as described above, were supplemented with hydroxyurea (HU) (100 or 250 mm; Sigma) or mimosine (1 or 2 mm; Sigma) or roscovitine (100 or 200 μm; Calbiochem). β-Glucuronidase Assays—Leaves were histochemically stained with X-Gluc, or leaf extracts were used for fluorimetric MUG assays (24Jefferson R.A. Kavanaugh T.A. Bevan M.W. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3901-3908Crossref PubMed Scopus (8124) Google Scholar) as described in Ref. 4Chandrasekharan M.B. Bishop K.J. Hall T.C. Plant J. 2003; 33: 853-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar. DNA Replication and Inhibition—Approximately 100 leaves (10–14 days old) from line Alf5′-2 were incubated in MS medium (100 ml) with or without HU in the presence of [methyl-3H]thymidine (37 MBq/ml, specific activity of 185 GBq/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) at a final concentration of 1 μCi/ml. Two independent experiments were conducted using leaves treated with 100 or 250 mm HU or untreated as a control. Leaves were frozen in liquid nitrogen, and genomic DNA was isolated. MUG assays were conducted on extracts from leaves collected at the fourth interval to measure the effect of inhibitors on phas-driven GUS expression. Incorporation of [3H]dTTP into genomic DNA was determined by scintillation spectrometry (25Davies J.W. Hall T.C. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 77-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). RNase Protection Assay—To generate an antisense riboprobe for PvAlf, a 438-bp fragment corresponding to the acidic activation domain (11Bobb A.J. Eiben H.G. Bustos M.M. Plant J. 1995; 8: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) was PCR-amplified and cloned into pPCR-Script®. Riboprobes to the 3′ end of the uidA coding region and the 18 S region were as described in Ref. 3Li G. Bishop K.J. Chandrasekharan M.B. Hall T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7104-7109Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar. Radiolabeled 32P, antisense uidA, PvAlf, and 18 S riboprobes of 310 nucleotides, 529 nucleotides, or 200 nucleotides, respectively, were synthesized using T3 or T7 RNA polymerase on a HindIII- or EcoRI-linearized plasmid by in vitro transcription (MEGA-script™ kit; Ambion). Total RNA was isolated from leaves using RNeasy™ Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNase protection assays were conducted with 10 μg of total RNA using a RPAIII kit™ (Ambion). RNA from line 58.1A was used as a negative control for uidA and PvAlf transcripts, and RNA from line PvAlf-14 was used as a positive control for PvAlf mRNA (3Li G. Bishop K.J. Chandrasekharan M.B. Hall T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7104-7109Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The protected fragments were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 5% polyacrylamide 8 m urea gel. RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA (0.5 μg), isolated from Arabidopsis leaves using an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit and digested with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen), was subjected to RT-PCR analysis employing the Qiagen one-step RT-PCR kit. The RT-PCR reactions included 0.6 μm gene-specific primer and 0.08 μm EF1α-specific primer (as an internal control). Primer sequences used in assessing transcript abundance and reaction conditions are provided as supplemental material. Following RT-PCR, the products were resolved using agarose (1%) gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide (1 μg/μl). Images of the stained gels were captured using a digital camera, and relative densitometric intensity (pixels/mm2), normalized relative to EF-1α (internal control), was obtained using MacBAS v2.5 software (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). Values shown are for RT-PCR analyses of two entirely independent experiments and were within the linear amplification range. Involvement of DNA Replication in PvALF- and ABA-mediated Activation of the phas Promoter—Various inhibitors were used to investigate the involvement of DNA replication in PvALF- and ABA-mediated activation of the phas promoter. Mimosine inhibits nascent chain elongation by affecting deoxynucleotide metabolism (26Gilbert D.M. Neilson A. Miyazawa H. DePamphilis M.L. Burhans W.C. J. Biol.

Schochetman G. Hodas S. Balis M.E. Cancer Res. 1967; 27: 535-540PubMed Google Scholar); roscovitine, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, blocks the cell cycle at the G1 to S phase transition (28Planchais S. Glab N. Trehin C. Perennes C. Bureau J.M. Meijer L. Bergounioux C. Plant J. 1997; 12: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). DEX was used to induce ectopic expression of PvALF in leaves of the doubly transformed tobacco line GR30 (Fig. 1A). Subsequently, ABA was added to activate phas-driven GUS expression (Fig. 1B, compare GUS activities for DEX alone and DEX+ABA). As shown in Fig. 1B, compared with the DEX+ABA treatment without inhibitor control, 24 h of treatment with mimosine caused 64% (at 1 mm) to 76% (at 2 mm) reduction in GUS activity. Similarly, application of the inhibitor HU gave a 32% (at 100 mm) to 67% (at 250 mm) decrease, and roscovitine, a 79% (at 100 μm) to 94% (at 200 μm) reduction in GUS activity, confirming a role for DNA replication in activation of the phas promoter. Additional support for this conclusion was provided by the increase in GUS activity observed after transferring the leaves to fresh medium without inhibitors and incubation for an additional 24 h (Fig. 1C). Removal of roscovitine resulted in a 7–14-fold increase in GUS activity, whereas the removal of mimosine and HU led to only a 2-fold increase (Fig. 1C). Because the 2-fold increase can be attributed to a doubling of incubation time, only the data for roscovitine represent definitive reversal of inhibition of DNA replication in accordance with previous findings for these inhibitors (29Planchais S. Glab N. Inze D. Bergounioux C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The premise that the decrease in GUS activity was a direct outcome of DNA replication arrest rather than a decrease in PvALF production was evaluated by RNase protection assays. In Fig. 1D, data representative of two independent RNase protection assay experiments reveal similar levels of PvAlf transcripts in leaves induced with DEX+ABA in the presence or absence of inhibitors. Furthermore, the decrease in abundance for uidA transcripts as a result of inhibition of replication was assonant to the changes in GUS activities shown in Fig. 1B. DNA Replication Arrest Affects the ABA-mediated Activation Step—To address if replication arrest specifically affects the ABA-mediated activation step, the regimen shown in Fig. 2A was employed. The rationale for this is that if DNA replication is only required for PvALF to gain access to the promoter (to achieve potentiation), then inhibition of replication following the induction of PvALF should not affect the potentiation step and consequently will not reduce phas-driven GUS expression. Alternatively, observation of a reduction in GUS expression would indicate that inhibition of DNA replication interferes with the ABA-mediated activation step. In fact, the latter situation is indicated by the decrease in GUS activity seen in Fig. 2B for leaves of the tobacco line GR30 induced with DEX, then treated with the inhibitors HU or mimosine, and subsequently treated with ABA. Diverse components of the ABA signal transduction pathway, such as enzymes and transcription factors, have been discovered in Arabidopsis, but the occurrence of homologous constituents in tobacco is unknown (9Finkelstein R.R. Gampala S.S. Rock C.D. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: S15-S45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the concerted mechanism involving DNA replication and components of the ABA pathway, we established an estradiol-inducible system (19Zuo J. Niu Q.W. Chua N.H. Plant J. 2000; 24: 265-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to obtain controlled ectopic expression of PvALF in leaves of Arabidopsis transgenic for –1470phas/uidA. As shown in Fig. 2C, the reduction in GUS activity in inhibitor-treated leaves of the Arabidopsis line recapitulated the results obtained from the tobacco system. RT-PCR analyses were conducted to evaluate changes in the abundance of PvAlf and uidA transcripts. The addition of estradiol and ABA led to high levels of uidA transcripts (Fig. 3A). Application of replication inhibitors resulted in a decrease of uidA transcripts commensurate with the decrease in GUS activity detected using fluorimetric MUG assays (Fig. 2C). Compared with estradiol+ABA-treated leaves, quantitative measurement of the RT-PCR products for uidA (Fig. 3B) revealed a reduction of ∼30% for HU-treated (100 mm) and mimosine-treated (1 mm) leaves; a 60% decrease was obtained with 250 mm HU. The level of PvAlf transcripts remained unchanged in both inhibitor-treated and untreated samples (Fig. 3C) showing that the decrease in accumulation of uidA transcripts was not due to a reduction in PvALF production. Evidence for Replication and Its Inhibition in Leaves—Histone H4 synthesis occurs during S phase, and H4 transcripts serve as molecular markers for this stage of the cell cycle (29Planchais S. Glab N. Inze D. Bergounioux C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 30Combettes B. Reichheld J.P. Chaboute M.E. Philipps G. Shen W.H. Chaubet-Gigot N. Methods Cell Sci. 1999; 21: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). High levels of H4 transcripts were detected in leaves treated with estradiol+ABA (Fig. 3, A and D), which are indicative of replication during the induction and synthesis of PvALF. As shown in Fig. 3D, a decrease in accumulation of H4 transcripts upon addition of replication inhibitors was evidenced. The presence of active DNA replication in the tissue used in these experiments was confirmed by a second, direct approach (Fig. 4) in which high levels of [3H]thymidine incorporation into the leaf genomic DNA were obtained under the conditions used for phas promoter potentiation (Fig. 2A); application of HU (100 or 250 mm) virtually eliminated 3H incorporation. Analysis of PvALF+ABA-induced GUS production driven by the phas promoter in the extracts used to determine replication (data not shown) confirmed the production of GUS in the absence of HU and also the reduction of GUS expression in its presence, as found in the experiments depicted in Fig. 2. No decrease in 3H incorporation was observed in the presence of ABA alone or estradiol alone, indicating that these compounds do not inhibit active DNA replication under the experimental conditions employed (data not shown). DNA Replication Arrest Affects Activation of MAT and LEA Genes—To determine whether the requirement for DNA replication in PvALF- and ABA-mediated activation is specific to the phas promoter, transcript levels for several Arabidopsis seed-specific genes were analyzed by RT-PCR analyses of total RNA isolated from inhibitor-treated and untreated leaves. The presence of exogenously supplied ABA, in concert with ectopic expression of ABI3 (the Arabidopsis ortholog of bean PvALF), in Arabidopsis leaves stimulates activation of a wide variety of MAT genes (cruciferin C (CRC) and napin (At2S3)) and LEA genes (AtEM1 and M17) (10Parcy F. Valon C. Raynal M. Gaubier-Comella P. Delsney M. Giraudat J. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1567-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Because PvALF and ABI3 are orthologs, it can be predicted that PvALF will activate Arabidopsis MAT and LEA genes in the presence of exogenous ABA. Indeed, although a basal level of At2S3 transcripts was present in both estradiol-treated (+PvALF) and untreated (–PvALF) leaves, induction of PvALF by estradiol in the absence of ABA did not result in the accumulation of transcripts for CRC or AtEM1 (Fig. 5A). As anticipated, sequential addition of estradiol and ABA led to high levels of transcript accumulation for CRC, At2S3, AtEM1, and M17. The addition of DNA replication inhibitors caused a severe decrease in transcript accumulation for CRC (Fig. 5B), At2S3 (Fig. 5C), and M17 (Fig. 5D). Similar to what was observed for phas-driven GUS expression (Fig. 3), a drastic reduction is seen for MAT transcripts. A small decrease was seen for AtEM1 transcripts in inhibitor-treated samples (Fig. 5E). The results provide the first clear demonstration that DNA replication is involved in PvALF- and ABA-mediated regulation of MAT and LEA genes. However, inhibition of replication effectively blocks cell cycle progression from the G1/S phase. Indeed, studies on the establishment of heterochromatin-induced repression of mating loci in yeast have revealed that silencing is DNA replication-independent but is dependent on cell cycle progression (31Kirchmaier A.L. Rine J. Science. 2001; 291: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Further, studies on the access of yeast heat shock factor to nucleosomal DNA have established that it is not DNA replication per se but the S phase of the cell cycle that is required for activator-nucleosome interaction (32Venturi C.B. Erkine A.M. Gross D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6435-6448Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, the regulation of MAT and LEA genes by PvALF and ABA may be dependent on S phase progression rather than DNA replication. DNA Replication Arrest Does Not Augment Negative Regulators of the ABA Signal Cascade—Genes having products shown to possess negative regulatory roles in the ABA signal transduction pathway include protein phosphatases ABI1 and ABI2 (33Merlot S. Gosti F. Guerrier D. Vavasseur A. Giraudat J. Plant J. 2001; 25: 295-303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ERA1, a protein farnesyltransferase (34Cutler S. Ghassemian M. Bonetta D. Cooney S. McCourt P. Science. 1996; 273: 1239-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). RT-PCR analyses of total RNA isolated from replication inhibitor-treated and untreated leaves revealed unchanged transcript levels for abi1, abi2, and era1 (Fig. 6), making it unlikely that augmentation of these negative regulators is responsible for the decrease in MAT gene expression. Inhibition of DNA Replication Decreases abi5 Transcription—Decreased transcription of MAT and LEA genes could also result from down-regulation of positive regulators of the ABA signal cascade. ick1 encodes an ABA-induced inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase that has been implicated in cell cycle arrest (35Wang H. Qi Q. Schorr P. Cutler A.J. Crosby W.L. Fowke L.C. Plant J. 1998; 15: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), and aip3 encodes an ABI3-interacting protein with similarities to human transcription factor C1 that is presumed to play a role in G1/S phase transition (36Kurup S. Jones H.D. Holdsworth M.J. Plant J. 2000; 21: 143-155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, quantitative analysis of the RT-PCR profiles (Fig. 7A) showed that transcript levels for aip3 (Fig. 7B) and ick1 (Fig. 7C) remained unchanged in inhibitor-treated leaves. ABI5, a b-zip class transcription factor, is a positive regulatory ABA signal effector (37Finkelstein R.R. Lynch T.J. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar) shown in transient assays to trans-activate phas promoter-driven GUS expression (38Gampala S.S. Finkelstein R.R. Sun S.S.
