https://openalex.org/W3018947259,"Background Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe and disabling condition that may lead to functional impairment and reduced productivity. Psychological interventions have been shown to be effective in its management. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of a range of interventions for adults with PTSD. Methods A decision-analytic model was constructed to compare costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of 10 interventions and no treatment for adults with PTSD, from the perspective of the National Health Service and personal social services in England. Effectiveness data were derived from a systematic review and network meta-analysis. Other model input parameters were based on published sources, supplemented by expert opinion. Results Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) appeared to be the most cost-effective intervention for adults with PTSD (with a probability of 0.34 amongst the 11 evaluated options at a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20,000/QALY), followed by combined somatic/cognitive therapies, self-help with support, psychoeducation, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT), self-help without support, non-TF-CBT and combined TF-CBT/SSRIs. Counselling appeared to be less cost-effective than no treatment. TF-CBT had the largest evidence base. Conclusions A number of interventions appear to be cost-effective for the management of PTSD in adults. EMDR appears to be the most cost-effective amongst them. TF-CBT has the largest evidence base. There remains a need for well-conducted studies that examine the long-term clinical and cost-effectiveness of a range of treatments for adults with PTSD."
https://openalex.org/W3022131777,"In face-to-face communication there are multiple paralinguistic and gestural features that facilitate recognition of a speaker's intended meaning, features that are lacking when people communicate digitally (e.g., texting). As a result, substitutes have emerged (expressive punctuation, capitalization, etc.) to facilitate communication in these situations. However, little is known about the comprehension processes involved in digital communication. In this research we examined the role of emoji in the comprehension of face-threatening, indirect replies. Participants in two experiments read question-reply sequences and then judged the accuracy of interpretations of the replies. On critical trials the reply violated the relation maxim and conveyed a negative, face-threatening response. On one-third of the trials the reply contained only text, on one-third of the trials the reply contained text and an emoji, and on one-third of the trials the reply contained only an emoji. When the question requested potentially negative information about one of the interactants (disclosures and opinions), participants were more likely to endorse the indirect meaning of the reply, and did so faster, when the reply contained an emoji than when it did not. This effect did not occur when the question was a request for action, a more conventional type of indirect reply. Overall, then, this research demonstrates that emoji can sometimes facilitate the comprehension of meaning. Future research is needed to examine the boundary conditions for this effect."
https://openalex.org/W3016462224,"Terpenes are the largest class of natural products with extensive structural diversity and are widely used as pharmaceuticals, herbicides, flavourings, fragrances, and biofuels. While they have mostly been isolated from plants and fungi, the availability and analysis of bacterial genome sequence data indicates that bacteria also possess many putative terpene synthase genes. In this study, we further explore this potential for terpene synthase activity in bacteria. Twenty two potential class I terpene synthase genes (TSs) were selected to represent the full sequence diversity of bacterial synthase candidates and recombinantly expressed in E. coli. Terpene synthase activity was detected for 15 of these enzymes, and included mono-, sesqui- and diterpene synthase activities. A number of confirmed sesquiterpene synthases also exhibited promiscuous monoterpene synthase activity, suggesting that bacteria are potentially a richer source of monoterpene synthase activity then previously assumed. Several terpenoid products not previously detected in bacteria were identified, including aromandendrene, acora-3,7(14)-diene and longiborneol. Overall, we have identified promiscuous terpene synthases in bacteria and demonstrated that terpene synthases with substrate promiscuity are widely distributed in nature, forming a rich resource for engineering terpene biosynthetic pathways for biotechnology."
https://openalex.org/W3022378571,"We investigate a popular but underresearched concept, the fear of missing out (FOMO), on desirable experiences of which an individual is aware, but in which they do not partake. Through laboratory and field studies, we establish FOMO’s pervasiveness as a psychological phenomenon, present real-life contexts wherein FOMO may be experienced, and explore its behavioral consequences. Specifically, we show that FOMO poses a threat to loyalty by decreasing one’s intentions to repeat a current experience and may decrease the valuation of the current experience."
https://openalex.org/W3022558385,"Numerous neuronal properties including the synaptic vesicle release process, neurotransmitter receptor complement, and postsynaptic ion channels are involved in transforming synaptic inputs into postsynaptic spiking. Temperature is a significant influencer of neuronal function and synaptic integration. Changing temperature can affect neuronal physiology in a diversity of ways depending on how it affects different members of the cell’s ion channel complement. Temperature’s effects on neuronal function are critical for pathological states such as fever, which can trigger seizure activity, but are also important in interpreting and comparing results of experiments conducted at room vs physiological temperature. The goal of this study was to examine the influence of temperature on synaptic properties and ion channel function in thalamocortical (TC) relay neurons in acute brain slices of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, a key synaptic target of retinal ganglion cells in the thalamus. Warming the superfusate in patch clamp experiments with acutely-prepared brain slices led to an overall inhibition of synaptically-driven spiking behavior in TC neurons in response to a retinal ganglion cell spike train. Further study revealed that this was associated with an increase in presynaptic synaptic vesicle release probability and synaptic depression and altered passive and active membrane properties. Additionally, warming the superfusate triggered activation of an inwardly rectifying potassium current and altered the voltage-dependence of voltage-gated Na+ currents and T-type calcium currents. This study highlights the importance of careful temperature control in ex vivo physiological experiments and illustrates how numerous properties such as synaptic inputs, active conductances, and passive membrane properties converge to determine spike output."
https://openalex.org/W3023253827,"One of the main molecular causes that contributes to varicocele-related male infertility is excess production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). It is believed that hypoxia is an important stimulator of ROS in this condition. Recently, the significant roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in hypoxia response have emerged. Despite the investigation of hypoxia, there is scant information about the role of hypoxia-responding lncRNAs in varicocele-related male infertility. In the present study, we deduced eight hypoxia-responding lncRNAs based on high-throughput RNA sequencing data from two Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. We used qRT-PCR to assess the expression levels of some of these lncRNAs in 42 ejaculated spermatozoa samples from 25 infertile men with varicocele and 17 fertile men as controls. We identified significant increases in expression levels of hypoxia-related lncRNAs, MIR210HG and MLLT4-AS1 in ejaculated spermatozoa of infertile men with varicocele. These lncRNAs also showed significant positive correlations with ROS levels and meaningful negative correlations with sperm parameters (count and motility). Besides, in silico studies identified several hypoxia response elements (HREs) within selected lncRNAs promoters. Delineation of hypoxia-related lncRNAs in varicocele-related infertility provides a valuable insight into male infertility."
https://openalex.org/W3023808370,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by major social, communication and behavioural challenges. The cause of ASD is still unclear and it is assumed that environmental, genetic and epigenetic factors influence the risk of ASD occurrence. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short 21–25 nucleotide long RNA molecules which post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. MiRNAs play an important role in central nervous system development; therefore, dysregulation of miRNAs is connected to changes in behaviour and cognition observed in many disorders including ASD. Based on previously published work, on diagnosing ASD using miRNAs, we hypothesized that miRNAs can be used as biomarkers in children with suspected developmental disorders (DD) including ASD within Bosnian-Herzegovinian (B&H) population. 14 selected miRNAs were tested on saliva of children with suspected developmental disorders including ASD. The method of choice was qRT-PCR as a relatively cheap method available in most diagnostic laboratories in low to mid-income countries (LMIC). Out of 14 analysed miRNAs, 6 were differentially expressed between typically developing children and children with some type of developmental disorder including autism spectrum disorder. Using the most optimal logistic regression, we were able to distinguish between ASD and typically developing (TD) children. We have found 5 miRNAs as potential biomarkers. From those, 3 were differentially expressed within the ASD cohort. All 5 miRNAs had shown good chi-square statistics within the logistic regression performed on all 14 analysed miRNAs. The accuracy of 5-miRNAs model training set was 90.2%, while the validation set had a 90% accuracy. This study has shown that miRNAs may be considered as biomarkers for ASD detection and may be used to identify children with ASD along with standard developmental screening tests. By combining these methods we may be able to reach a reliable and accessible diagnostic model for children with ASD in LMIC such as B&H."
https://openalex.org/W3022800090,"Objective This study attempts to investigate the association between maternal exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) and morbidity and mortality of children. Study design A cross-sectional study was carried out using the most recent nationally representative data of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) in India. Results The prevalence of morbidity and mortality was higher among the children whose mothers faced physical, emotional, or sexual violence perpetrated by the partner than those who did not encounter any violence. Multivariate analysis revealed that maternal exposure to physical and sexual violence significantly increased the risks of childhood diarrhea and fever; and emotional violence was associated with an increased likelihood of diarrhea, fever, and acute respiratory infection (ARI) in the past 2 weeks among under-five children. Moreover, women’s experience of physical and emotional violence were associated with increased odds of infant mortality (<1 year) and under-five mortality (<5 years) in crude analysis. However, these associations were insignificant in the adjusted analysis. Similarly, we did not find any significant association between maternal exposure to IPV and child mortality (1 to < 5 years). Conclusion Maternal experience of domestic violence was associated with an increased risk of childhood morbidity (diarrhea, fever and ARI). However, no significant association was found between violence against women and mortality of children. Prevention of domestic violence may help to reduce childhood illnesses. Additional efforts are needed for maternal and child healthcare programs to improve health status of women and children."
https://openalex.org/W3022782912,"Xylella fastidiosa pauca ST53 is the bacterium responsible for the Olive Quick Decline Syndrome that has killed millions of olive trees in Southern Italy. A recent work demonstrates that a rational integration of vector and transmission control measures, into a strategy based on chemical and physical control means, can manage Xylella fastidiosa invasion and impact below an acceptable economic threshold. In the present study, we propose a biological alternative to the chemical control action, which involves the predetermined use of an available natural enemy of Philaenus spumarius, i.e., Zelus renardii, for adult vector population and infection biocontrol. The paper combines two different approaches: a laboratory experiment to test the predation dynamics of Zelus renardii on Philaenus spumarius and its attitude as candidate for an inundation strategy; a simulated experiment of inundation, to preliminary test the efficacy of such strategy, before eventually proceeding to an in-field experimentation. With this double-fold approach we show that an inundation strategy with Zelus renardii has the potential to furnish an efficient and “green” solution to Xylella fastidiosa invasion, with a reduction of the pathogen incidence below 10%. The biocontrol model presented here could be promising for containing the impact and spread of Xylella fastidiosa, after an in-field validation of the inundation technique. Saving the fruit orchard, the production and the industry in susceptible areas could thus become an attainable goal, within comfortable parameters for sustainability, environmental safety, and effective plant health protection in organic orchard management."
https://openalex.org/W4254261729,"In the Internet of Things (IoT), numerous devices can interact with each other over the Internet. A wide range of IoT applications have already been deployed, such as transportation systems, healthcare systems, smart buildings, smart factories, and smart cities. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) play crucial roles in these IoT applications. Researchers have published effective (but not entirely secure) approaches for merging WSNs into IoT environments. In IoT environments, the security effectiveness of remote user authentication is crucial for information transmission. Computational efficiency and energy consumption are crucial because the energy available to any WSN is limited. This paper proposes a notably efficient and secure authentication scheme based on temporal credential and dynamic ID for WSNs in IoT environments. The Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic method was used to validate our scheme. Cryptanalysis revealed that our scheme can overcome the security weaknesses of previously published schemes. The security functionalities and performance efficiency of our scheme are compared with those of previous related schemes. The result demonstrates that our scheme's security functionalities are quantitatively and qualitatively superior to those of comparable schemes. Our scheme can improve the effectiveness of authentication in IoT environments. Notably, our scheme has superior performance efficiency, low computational cost, frugal energy consumption, and low communication cost."
https://openalex.org/W3023818785,"Spring maize sowing occurs during a period of low temperature (LT) in Northeast China, and the LT suppresses nitrogen (N) metabolism and photosynthesis, further reducing dry matter accumulation. Diethyl aminoethyl hexanoate (DA-6) improves N metabolism; hence, we studied the effects of DA-6 on maize seedlings under LT conditions. The shoot and root fresh weight and dry weight decreased by 17.70%~20.82% in the LT treatment, and decreased by 5.81%~13.57% in the LT + DA-6 treatment on the 7th day, respectively. Exogenous DA-6 suppressed the increases in ammonium (NH4+) content and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) activity, and suppressed the decreases in nitrate (NO3-) and nitrite (NO2-) contents, and activities of nitrate reductase (NR), nitrite reductase (NiR), glutamine synthetase (GS), glutamate synthase (GOGAT) and transaminase activities. NiR activity was most affected by DA-6 under LT conditions. Additionally, exogenous DA-6 suppressed the net photosynthetic rate (Pn) decrease, and the suppressed the increases of superoxide anion radical (O2·-) generation rate and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content. Taken together, our results suggest that exogenous DA-6 mitigated the repressive effects of LT on N metabolism by improving photosynthesis and modulating oxygen metabolism, and subsequently enhanced the LT tolerance of maize seedlings."
https://openalex.org/W3021979328,"Background Energy drinks (ED) are caffeine- and sugar-rich beverages with other ingredients that are marketed for their energy-boosting and performance-enhancing effects. The consumption of these drinks, with and without alcohol, is dramatically increasing worldwide, despite the reported side effects and potential harms to consumers. Few studies, to date, have explored the perceptions and experiences of young adults towards these beverages. Objective The present study aimed to explore the consumption patterns and correlates of ED consumption, as well as the perceptions and experiences of university students in Lebanon towards these beverages. Methods A sequential explanatory mixed-methods approach was adopted. Data collection was conducted in two private universities in Beirut, Lebanon. A self-administered 36-item quantitative survey was first used to explore the prevalence and correlates of ED consumption among a convenience sample of university students (n = 226). The survey included questions related to socio-demographic characteristics, anthropometric measurements, and other lifestyle behaviors, including physical activity of university students. The subsequent qualitative phase consisted of focus group discussions (FGD) conducted to further examine the perceptions and experiences of university students towards ED. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses were conducted using survey data, whereas the transcribed FGD were analyzed thematically. Results A total of 226 university students completed the survey. Results showed that 45% of survey respondents consumed ED at least once in their life (ever consumers), among which 30% reported consumption of ED mixed with alcohol (AmED). Adjusting for socio-demographic and anthropometric characteristics, coffee and sports drinks consumption were significantly associated with ED (OR = 2.45, 95% CI = 1.20, 5.00, and OR = 4.88, 95%CI = 2.41, 9.88, respectively). In addition, physically active participants were 1.89 times (95%CI = 1.01, 3.51) more likely to consume ED compared to their inactive counterparts. During the qualitative phase, a total of six FGD were conducted with 29 university students, who reported consuming ED at least once per month. Three main themes were derived reflecting individual-, interpersonal/social- and environmental-level factors affecting ED consumption among university students. These themes were further supported by eight subthemes, including: perceived benefits of ED, experienced side effects, misinformation about content of ED, peer pressure and social image, as well as affordability and accessibility of ED. Conclusion Findings highlight the need for public health policies and programs to curb the growing public health phenomenon of ED consumption amongst university students. Such programs should consider the multi-level factors affecting ED consumption at the individual, interpersonal/social, and environmental levels, including educational campaigns on ED potential harms, regulating ED content and labeling, as well as restricting sales and marketing of these beverages, especially among young consumers."
https://openalex.org/W3022877085,"Approximately one fourth of the Earth's Northern Hemisphere is underlain by permafrost, earth materials (soil, organic matter, or bedrock), that has been continuously frozen for at least two consecutive years. Numerous studies point to evidence of accelerated climate warming in the Arctic and sub-Arctic where permafrost is located. Changes to permafrost biochemical processes may critically impact ecosystem processes at the landscape scale. Here, we sought to understand how the permafrost metabolome responds to thaw and how this response differs based on location (i.e. chronosequence of permafrost formation constituting diverse permafrost types). We analyzed metabolites from microbial cells originating from Alaskan permafrost. Overall, permafrost thaw induced a shift in microbial metabolic processes. Of note were the dissimilarities in biochemical structure between frozen and thawed samples. The thawed permafrost metabolomes from different locations were highly similar. In the intact permafrost, several metabolites with antagonist properties were identified, illustrating the competitive survival strategy required to survive a frozen state. Interestingly, the intensity of these antagonistic metabolites decreased with warmer temperature, indicating a shift in ecological strategies in thawed permafrost. These findings illustrate the impact of change in temperature and spatial variability as permafrost undergoes thaw, knowledge that will become crucial for predicting permafrost biogeochemical dynamics as the Arctic and Antarctic landscapes continue to warm."
https://openalex.org/W3020937900,"Cytokinin is an important regulator of symbiotic nodule development. Recently, KNOTTED1-LIKE HOMEOBOX 3 transcription factor (TF) was shown to regulate symbiotic nodule development possibly via the activation of cytokinin biosynthesis genes. However, the direct interaction between the KNOX3 TF and its target genes has not been investigated up to date. Here, using EMSA analysis and SPR-based assay, we found that MtKNOX3 homeodomain directly binds to the regulatory sequences of the MtLOG1, MtLOG2, and MtIPT3 genes involved in nodulation in Medicago truncatula. Moreover, we showed that MtLOG2 and MtIPT3 expression patterns partially overlap with MtKNOX3 expression in developing nodules as it was shown by promoter:GUS analysis. Our data suggest that MtKNOX3 TF may directly activate the MtLOG1, MtLOG2, and MtIPT3 genes during nodulation thereby increasing cytokinin biosynthesis in developing nodules."
https://openalex.org/W3020987458,"In Rubiaceae phylogenetics, the number of markers often proved a limitation with authors failing to provide well-supported trees at tribal and generic levels. A robust phylogeny is a prerequisite to study the evolutionary patterns of traits at different taxonomic levels. Advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized biology by providing, at reduced cost, huge amounts of data for an increased number of species. Due to their highly conserved structure, generally recombination-free, and mostly uniparental inheritance, chloroplast DNA sequences have long been used as choice markers for plant phylogeny reconstruction. The main objectives of this study are: 1) to gain insight in chloroplast genome evolution in the Rubiaceae (Ixoroideae) through efficient methodology for de novo assembly of plastid genomes; and, 2) to test the efficiency of mining SNPs in the nuclear genome of Ixoroideae based on the use of a coffee reference genome to produce well-supported nuclear trees. We assembled whole chloroplast genome sequences for 27 species of the Rubiaceae subfamily Ixoroideae using next-generation sequences. Analysis of the plastid genome structure reveals a relatively good conservation of gene content and order. Generally, low variation was observed between taxa in the boundary regions with the exception of the inverted repeat at both the large and short single copy junctions for some taxa. An average of 79% of the SNP determined in the Coffea genus are transferable to Ixoroideae, with variation ranging from 35% to 96%. In general, the plastid and the nuclear genome phylogenies are congruent with each other. They are well-resolved with well-supported branches. Generally, the tribes form well-identified clades but the tribe Sherbournieae is shown to be polyphyletic. The results are discussed relative to the methodology used and the chloroplast genome features in Rubiaceae and compared to previous Rubiaceae phylogenies."

Only 38,156 patients with the first diagnosis were selected. Among them, 21,598 were males accounting for 56.6% the median age was 66 years (Q1-Q3: 53-78), the median length of a hospital stay was 7 days (Q1-Q3: 4-12), and the median length of an ICU stay was 2.1 days (Q1-Q3: 1.2-4.1). Septicemia was the disease with the highest mortality rate among patients and the total mortality rate was 48.9%. The disease with the largest number of patients at the last time was other forms of chronic ischemic heart disease.By analyzing the patients' basic information, the admission spectrum and the disease morbidity and mortality can help more researchers understand the MIMIC-III database and facilitate further research."
https://openalex.org/W3023534406,"Mind wandering (MW) refers to the shift of attention away from a primary task and/or external environment towards thoughts unrelated to the task. Recent evidence has shown that pupillometry can be used as an objective marker of the onset and maintenance of externally-driven MW episodes. In the present study we aimed to further investigate pupillary changes associated with the onset and duration of self-reported MW episodes. We used a modified version of the joint behavioural-pupillometry paradigm we recently introduced. Participants were asked to perform a monotonous vigilance task which was intermixed with task-irrelevant cue-phrases (visually presented verbal cues); they were instructed to interrupt the task whenever a thought came to mind (self-caught method) and to indicate the trigger of their thought, if any. We found systematic pupil dilation after the presentation of verbal cues reported to have triggered MW, compared with other verbal cues presented during a supposedly on-task period (i.e., the period immediately following the resuming of the task after a self-caught interruption and MW report). These results confirm that pupil diameter is sensitive to the changes associated with the onset of MW and its unfolding over time. Moreover, by computing the latency between the trigger presentation and the task interruption (self-catch), we could also estimate the duration of MW episodes triggered by verbal cues. However, a high variability was found, implying very large inter-event variability, which could not be explained by any of the MW properties we acquired (including: temporal focus, specificity, emotional valence). Our behavioural and pupillometry findings stress the need for objective measures about the temporal unfolding of MW (while most studies focus on arbitrary time-window preceding self-reports of MW)."
https://openalex.org/W3023620981,"Introduction We all have stories to tell. The stories that prevail in our conversations frequently concern significant past personal experiences and are accordingly based on autobiographical memory retrieval and sharing. This is in line with the social function of autobiographical memory, which embodies the idea that we share memories with others to develop and maintain social relationships. However, the successful fulfilment of this social function is dependent on phenomenological properties of the memory, which are highly inter-individually different. One important individual difference is memory coherence, operationalized as narrative coherence. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of memory coherence on the social evaluations of listeners. We hypothesized that being incoherent in the sharing of autobiographical memories, would evoke more negative social evaluations from listeners, in comparison to coherently sharing autobiographical memories. Methods In a within-subject experimental study, 96 participants listened to four pre-recorded audio clips in which the speaker narrated about an autobiographical experience, in either a coherent or an incoherent manner. Results Results were in line with our hypotheses. Participants showed more willingness to interact, more instrumental support, more positive feelings, more empathy and more trust towards those narrators who talked in a coherent manner about their autobiographical memories, as compared to those that talked in an incoherent manner. Negative feelings in the listener were evoked when the speaker talked incoherently, but especially when it concerned a positive memory. Discussion Results can be explained in terms of a reduction in the attraction effect when effortful processing is increased, which is in line with the dual processing theory of impression formation. Another explanation involves the idea that coherence is necessary to establish truthfulness in communication. The clinical relevance of these findings is further illustrated in light of the relation between social support and psychological well-being."
https://openalex.org/W3022070328,"Antibiotic-resistant bacteria represent an emerging global health problem and are frequently detected in riverine environments. Analyzing the occurrence of corresponding antibiotic-resistant genes in rivers is of public interest as it contributes towards understanding the origin and dissemination of these emerging microbial contaminants via surface water. This is critical for devising strategies to mitigate the spread of resistances in the environment. Concentrations of blaCTX-M antibiotic resistance genes were quantified weekly over a 12-month period in Lahn River surface water at two sampling sites using quantitative real-time PCR. Gene abundances were statistically assessed with regard to previously determined concentrations of fecal indicator organisms Escherichia coli, intestinal enterococci and somatic coliphages, as well as influential environmental factors. Similar seasonal patterns and strong positive correlations between fecal indicators and blaCTX-M genes indicated identical sources. Accordingly, linear regression analyses showed that blaCTX-M concentrations could largely be explained by fecal pollution. E. coli provided the best estimates (75% explained variance) at the upstream site, where proportions of blaCTX-M genes in relation to fecal indicator organisms were highest. At this site, rainfall proved to be more influential, hinting at surface runoff as an emission source. The level of agricultural impact increased from downstream to upstream, linking increasing blaCTX-M concentrations after rainfall events to the degree of agricultural land use. Exposure assessment revealed that even participants in non-swimming recreational activities were at risk of incidentally ingesting blaCTX-M genes and thus potentially antibiotic resistant bacteria. Considering that blaCTX-M genes are ubiquitous in Lahn River and participants in bathing and non-bathing water sports are at risk of exposure, results highlight the importance of microbial water quality monitoring with an emphasis on antibiotic resistance not only in designated bathing waters. Moreover, E. coli might serve as a suitable estimate for the presence of respective antibiotic resistant strains."
https://openalex.org/W3022290347,"Oily wastewater, especially water-oil emulsion has become serious environmental issue and received global attention. Chemical demulsifiers are widely used to treat oil-water emulsion, but the toxicity, non-recyclable and non-environmental friendly characteristic of chemical demulsifiers had limited their practical application in oil-water separation. Therefore, it is imperative to develop an efficient, simple, eco-friendly and recyclable demulsifiers for breaking up the emulsions from the oily wastewater. In this study, a magnetic demulsifier, magnetite-reduced graphene oxide (M-rGO) nanocomposites were proposed as a recyclable demulsifier to break up the surfactant stabilized crude oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion. M-rGO nanocomposites were prepared via in situ chemical synthesis by using only one type Fe salt and GO solid as precursor at room temperature. The prepared composites were fully characterized by various techniques. The effect of demulsifier dosage and pH of emulsion on demulsification efficiency (ED) has been studied in detailed. The demulsification mechanism was also proposed in this study. Results showed that M-rGO nanocomposites were able to demulsify crude O/W emulsion. The ED reaches 99.48% when 0.050 wt.% of M-rGO nanocomposites were added to crude O/W emulsion (pH = 4). Besides, M-rGO nanocomposites can be recycled up to 7 cycles without showing a significant change in terms of ED. Thus, M-rGO nanocomposite is a promising demulsifier for surfactant stabilized crude O/W emulsion."
https://openalex.org/W3022882609,"Background Congenital cytomegalovirus infection can lead to severe sequelae. When fetal infection is confirmed, we hypothesize that fetal treatment could improve the outcome. Maternal oral administration of an effective drug crossing the placenta could allow fetal treatment. Letermovir (LMV) and Maribavir (MBV) are new CMV antivirals, and potential candidates for fetal treatment. Methods The objective was to investigate the placental transfer of LMV and MBV in the ex vivo method of the human perfused cotyledon. Term placentas were perfused, in an open-circuit model, with LMV or MBV at concentrations in the range of clinical peak plasma concentrations. Concentrations were measured using ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Mean fetal transfer rate (FTR) (fetal (FC) /maternal concentration), clearance index (CLI), accumulation index (AI) (retention of each drug in the cotyledon tissue) were measured. Mean FC were compared with half maximal effective concentrations of the drugs (EC50(LMV) and EC50(MBV)). Results For LMV, the mean FC was (± standard deviation) 1.1 ± 0.2 mg/L, 1,000-fold above the EC50(LMV). Mean FTR, CLI and AI were 9 ± 1%, 35 ± 6% and 4 ± 2% respectively. For MBV, the mean FC was 1.4 ± 0.2 mg/L, 28-fold above the EC50(MBV). Mean FTR, CLI and AI were 10 ± 1%, 50 ± 7% and 2 ± 1% respectively. Conclusions Drugs’ concentrations in the fetal side should be in the range for in utero treatment of fetuses infected with CMV as the mean FC was superior to the EC50 for both molecules."
https://openalex.org/W3023293562,"Introduction Global surgery is a growing field studying the determinants of safe and affordable surgical care and advocating to gain the global health community's attention. In Cameroon, little is known about the level of knowledge and attitudes of students. Our survey aimed to describe the knowledge and attitudes of Cameroonian medical students towards global surgery. Materials and methods We performed an anonymous online survey of final-year Cameroonian medical students. Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman correlation analysis were used for bivariate analysis, and the alpha value was set at 0.05. Odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Results 204 respondents with a mean age of 24.7 years (±2.0) participated in this study. 58.3% were male, 41.6% had previously heard or read about global surgery, 36.3% had taken part in a global surgery study, and 10.8% had attended a global surgery event. Mercy Ships was well known (46.5%), and most students believed that surgical interventions were more costly than medical treatments (75.0%). The mean score of the global surgery evaluation was 47.4% (±29.6%), and being able to recognize more global surgery organizations was correlated with having assumed multiple roles during global surgery studies (p = 0.008) and identifying more global surgery indicators (p = 0.04). Workforce, infrastructure, and funding were highlighted as the top priorities for the development of global surgery in Cameroon. Conclusion Medical students are conscious of the importance of surgical care. They lack the opportunities to nurture their interest and should be taught global surgery concepts and skills."
https://openalex.org/W3021932247,"This article proposes and examines gender and life-stage factors as determinants of public worry and risk avoidance in a nuclear fallout scenario. Drawing on a survey (N 2,291) conducted in Sweden, the article demonstrates statistically significant results that women as well as parents with children at home are more likely to express high levels of worry for radiation exposure and have a preference to move away from a fallout area despite assurance of successful remediation. Moreover, a negative relationship is shown between age and both worry for radiation exposure and preference to move. These novel results from Northern Europe thus support a life-stage framing of public risk attitudes. As radiation physicists develop new methods showing that women and children are at higher risk of cancer than other groups at the same radiation exposure, we may actually see the precaution among women and parents as a regulating mechanism for the higher objective risk they face. The results are moreover in agreement with studies of public risk reactions in Japan, creating a strong knowledge base that human-induced radiation pollution is largely an intolerable risk to the public. Considering the public opinion, managing an intolerable risk through risk mitigation by remediation alone is likely insufficient in many cases. A viable strategy would offer a range of social support options that enable individual decision-making and the protection of risk groups."
https://openalex.org/W3022793359,"Background Studies in sub-Saharan Africa indicated the overall prevalence of optimal breast feeding ranged between a lowest of 17.63% in East Africa and a highest of 46.37% in West Africa. It’s estimated that 823,000 deaths of children could be prevented every year through optimal breastfeeding practices. However optimal breastfeeding practices is low in most setting of Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to assess optimal breastfeeding practices and associated factors in Worabe town. Method A community-based analytical cross-sectional study was conducted from April 15th–25th, 2018. A systematic sampling technique was applied on 347 sampled mothers who had children greater than or equal to 2 years old. The data was entered into EpiData (version 3.1) and subsequently exported to SPSS Statistics (version 22) for analysis. Descriptive statistics were used for presenting summary data using tables and graph. Bivariate and multi variable logistic regression analysis to identify were used to identify associated factors. The statistical significance was declared at P<0.05. Result Optimal breastfeeding was exhibited by 42.1% of mothers. Government employees (AOR = 8.0; 95% CI: 1.7, 36.4), families with a household income of 1,500–3,000 Ethiopian birr (AOR = 4.6; 95% CI: 1.0, 20.1), individuals knowledgeable about optimal breastfeeding practices (AOR: 5.5 95% CI: 1.6, 18.1), individuals counselled about breastfeeding practices during postnatal follow-ups (AOR = 4.940, 95% CI: 1.313, 10.195), and individuals that had a caesarean section delivery (AOR = 4.2, 95% CI: 1.2, 14.1) had a higher chance of practicing optimal breastfeeding. However, mothers who did not attend or have access to antenatal care follow-ups (AOR = 0.1, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.5) were less likely to practice optimal breastfeeding. Conclusions Less than half of mothers breastfed their children optimally. Factors that influenced this included knowledge of optimal breastfeeding practices, total household income, the woman's occupation, access to breastfeeding counselling during postnatal care follow-ups, access to antenatal care follow-ups, and mode of delivery. It is strongly recommended that optimal breastfeeding awareness programs through health education be done in collaboration with health extension workers, and zonal health offices."
https://openalex.org/W3021306374,"The actin cytoskeleton plays a central role in establishing cell polarity and shape during embryonic morphogenesis. Daam1, a member of the Formin family of actin cytoskeleton regulators, is a Dvl2-binding protein that functions in the Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) pathway. To examine the role of the Daam proteins in mammalian development, we generated Daam-deficient mice by gene targeting and found that Daam1, but not Daam2, is necessary for fetal survival. Embryonic development of Daam1 mutants was delayed most likely due to functional defects in the labyrinthine layer of the placenta. Examination of Daam2 and Daam1/2 double mutants revealed that Daam1 and Daam2 are functionally redundant during placental development. Of note, neural tube closure defects (NTD), which are observed in several mammalian PCP mutants, are not observed in Wnt5a or Daam1 single mutants, but arise in Daam1;Wnt5a double mutants. These findings demonstrate a unique function for Daam genes in placental development and are consistent with a role for Daam1 in the Wnt/PCP pathway in mammals."

Methods SD-OCT macular volume scans of a randomly selected subset of 75 SCORE2 study eyes were converted to the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format, and the EZ layer was segmented using nonproprietary software. Segmented layer coordinates were exported and used to generate en face EZ thickness maps. Within the central subfield, the area of EZ defect was measured using manual and semi-automated approaches via a customized workflow in the open-source data analytics platform, Konstanz Information Miner (KNIME). Results A total of 184 volume scans from 74 study eyes were analyzed. The mean±SD area of EZ defect was similar between manual (0.19±0.22 mm2) and semi-automated measurements (0.19±0.21 mm2, p = 0.93; intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.90; average bias = 0.01, 95% confidence interval of limits of agreement -0.18–0.20). Conclusions A customized workflow generated via an open-source data analytics platform that applied machine-learning methods demonstrated reliable measurements of EZ area defect from en face thickness maps. The result of our semi-automated approach were comparable to manual measurements."
https://openalex.org/W3021868961,"Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) has a high and increasing incidence all over the world. Solar radiation is the main aetiology for humans. Although most research into photocarcinogenesis uses UVB as a source of radiation, UVA is also carcinogenic in long term. Pomegranate (PGE) and cocoa (CE) extracts have been used for medicinal purposes for time immemorial. Recently, it has been claimed that some of their properties may be an effective preventative measure against photocarcinogenesis and photoaging, but to date in vivo models have not been tested using RUVA, the objective of the present work. A lower incidence of lesions was observed in SKH-1 mice treated with PGE (p<0.001), and lower incidence of invasive squamous carcinoma in both treatment groups (p<0.001 for PGE and p<0.05 for CE); the PGE group also showed a lower level of cell proliferation than the control group (p<0.001). Significantly greater p53 alteration was observed in the control group than the treatment groups (p<0.001 for PGE and p = 0.05 for CE). No significant differences were found in relation to TIMP-1 and MMP-9. Taken together, the results suggest that oral feeding of PGE and CE to SKH-1 mice affords substantial protection against the adverse effects of RUVA, especially PGE."
https://openalex.org/W3022834620,"Mitochondria are quantitatively the most important sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which are formed as by-products during cellular respiration. ROS generation occurs when single electrons are transferred to molecular oxygen. This leads to a number of different ROS types, among them superoxide. Although most studies focus on ROS generation in the mitochondrial matrix, the intermembrane space (IMS) is also important in this regard. The main scavengers for the detoxification of superoxide in the IMS are Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and cytochrome-c. Similar to ROS, certain reactive carbonyl species are known for their high reactivity. The consequences are deleterious modifications to essential components compromising cellular functions and contributing to the etiology of severe pathological conditions like cancer, diabetes and neurodegeneration. In this study, we investigated the susceptibility of SOD1 and cytochrome-c to in vitro glycation by the dicarbonyl methylglyoxal (MGO) and the resulting effects on their structure. We utilized experimental techniques like immunodetection of the MGO-mediated modification 5-hydro-5-methylimidazolone, differential scanning calorimetry, fluorescence emission and circular dichroism measurements. We found that glycation of cytochrome-c leads to monomer aggregation, an altered secondary structure (increase in alpha helical content) and slightly more compact folding. In addition to structural changes, glycated cytochrome-c displays an altered thermal unfolding behavior. Subjecting SOD1 to MGO does not influence its secondary structure. However, similar to cytochrome-c, subunit aggregation is observed under denaturating conditions. Furthermore, the appearance of a second peak in the calorimetry diagram indirectly suggests de-metallation of SOD1 when high MGO levels are used. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that MGO has the potential to alter several structural parameters in important proteins of energy metabolism (cytochrome-c) and antioxidant defense (cytochrome-c, SOD1)."
https://openalex.org/W3023149820,"Background Zimbabwe is one of the thirty countries globally with a high burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) or rifampicin-resistant TB (MDR/RR-TB). Since 2010, patients diagnosed with MDR/RR-TB are being treated with 20–24 months of standardized second-line drugs (SLDs). The profile, management and factors associated with unfavourable treatment outcomes of MDR/RR TB have not been systematically evaluated in Zimbabwe. Objective To assess treatment outcomes and factors associated with unfavourable outcomes among MDR/RR-TB patients registered and treated under the National Tuberculosis Programme in all the district hospitals and urban healthcare facilities in Zimbabwe between January 2010 and December 2015. Methods A cohort study using routinely collected programme data. The ‘death’, ‘loss to follow-up’ (LTFU), ‘failure’ and ‘not evaluated’ were considered as “unfavourable outcome”. A generalized linear model with a log-link and binomial distribution or a Poisson distribution with robust error variances were used to assess factors associated with “unfavourable outcome”. The unadjusted and adjusted relative risks were calculated as a measure of association. A 𝑝value< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Of the 473 patients in the study, the median age was 34 years [interquartile range, 29–42] and 230 (49%) were males. There were 352 (74%) patients co-infected with HIV, of whom 321 (91%) were on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Severe adverse events (SAEs) were recorded in 118 (25%) patients; mostly hearing impairments (70%) and psychosis (11%). Overall, 184 (39%) patients had ‘unfavourable’ treatment outcomes [125 (26%) were deaths, 39 (8%) were lost to follow-up, 4 (<1%) were failures and 16 (3%) not evaluated]. Being co-infected with HIV but not on ART [adjusted relative risk (aRR) = 2.60; 95% CI: 1.33–5.09] was independently associated with unfavourable treatment outcomes. Conclusion The high unfavourable treatment outcomes among MDR/RR-TB patients on standardized SLDs were coupled with a high occurrence of SAEs in this predominantly HIV co-infected cohort. Switching to individualized all oral shorter treatment regimens should be considered to limit SAEs and improve treatment outcomes. Improving the ART uptake and timeliness of ART initiation can reduce unfavourable outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3023331524,"Background We aimed to determine the optimal approach with endoscopic biliary drainage (EBD) and corticosteroid (CS) for the treatment of IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis (ISC). Methods To evaluate the safety of EBD for treatment of biliary stricture caused by ISC, we assessed the risk of stent dislodgement and sought to determine the most appropriate time for stent removal. We also assessed the safety of treatment with CS alone for patients with obstructive jaundice, and the rate of and risk factors for biliary tract complications. Results Sixty-nine patients with ISC treated with CS were enrolled. Twenty-eight patients (40.6%) were treated with EBD for biliary stricture before CS initiation. Intentional stent removal was performed in thirteen (46.4%) after confirming CS-induced improvement. Eleven of thirteen patients (84.6%) underwent stent removal within 1 month after CS initiation and all their stent removals were safely carried out without early (within two weeks) recurrence of obstructive jaundice. Ten of twenty-eight patients (35.7%) experienced spontaneous stent dislodgement after CS initiation, and seven (70%) of them developed stent dislodgement two weeks to two months after CS initiation. Among forty-one patients treated with CS alone without EBD, 10 patients had obstructive jaundice at the time of CS initiation and all of them achieved clinical improvement without biliary tract infection. During the follow-up, three patients (4.3%), all of whom had undergone EBD, developed bile-duct stones, while none of those treated with CS alone developed bile-duct stones (p = 0.032). Long-term biliary stenting was a risk factor for bile-duct stones. Conclusions Biliary stent removal should be carried out within 2 weeks after CS initiation if biliary stricture improves to prevent stent dislodgement. Obstructive jaundice can be treated safely with CS alone in patients without infection. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of bile-duct stones in patients treated with EBD."
https://openalex.org/W3021413990,"During the recent decades, social inequalities in mental health have increased and are now one of the most persistent features of contemporary society. There is limited knowledge about when this pattern emerged or whether it has been a historically fixed feature. The objective of this study was to assess whether socioeconomic and gender gaps in mental health changed during the period 1900–1959 in Sweden. We used historical micro data which report all necessary information on individuals' demographic characteristics, occupational attainment and mental disorders (N = 2,450) in a Swedish population of 193,893. Changes over time was tested using multilevel Cox proportional hazard models. We tested how gender-specific risks of mental disorder changed and how gender-specific socioeconomic status was related to risks of mental disorder later in life. We found a reversal in gender gaps in mental health during the study period. Women had a lower risk than men in 1900 and higher risks in 1959. For men, we found a negative gradient in SES risks in 1900 and a positive gradient in 1959. For women, we found no clear SES gradient in the risk of mental disorder. These findings suggest that the contemporary patterns in socioeconomic and gender gaps in mental disorder emerged during the 1940s and 1950s and have since then persisted."
https://openalex.org/W3022949587,"Development of motor competencies and learning of movements in children is dependent on varied physical activity (PA). After-school programs (ASP) might provide opportunities for young schoolchildren to participate in PA. The aim of the current study was to investigate the PA of first graders in ASP and to consider its contribution to the development of motor competencies and the learning of movements.The study was performed utilizing a mixed methods design. A total of 42 first graders were sampled from 14 ASPs in Norway. Direct observations of the children's activities were conducted for the duration of one entire ASP day. PA intensity was measured using ActiGraph accelerometers. Qualitative data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis, while the Mann-Whitney U test and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to analyze the quantitative data.The median PA time among the observed children was 61.5 minutes. The median stationary time was 75.9 minutes. There was considerable variation within the sample. Girls were significantly more engaged in stationary behavior than boys. Frequent changes in activity type and intensity were typical features of the children's ASP day. PA duration and intensity were significantly higher outdoors than indoors. Adult-managed time had longer periods of stationary behavior than child-managed time. The PA at all intensity levels contained barrier-breaking movements-especially at light intensity levels.Most of the first graders studied were engaged in a variety of activity types of different duration and intensity levels, favorable for the development of motor competencies and for the learning of movements. Hence, it is reasonable to highlight that light PA, in combination with moderate and vigorous PA, is also of great importance for children during the time they spend in ASP. Ultimately, there is a need for staff members who can also stimulate varied PA among the most stationary children."
https://openalex.org/W3023166375,"Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) is the simple, non-invasive, gold-standard method for assessing arterial stiffness. However, baPWV has been shown to be associated with renal dyfunction, with a few reports demonstrating an association between baPWV and postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) among surgical patients.We retrospectively analyzed preoperative baPWV data that were prospectively collected from 164 patients who underwent off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) between April 2013 and July 2019 (mean age: 66.2 ± 10.3 years, 29.3% females). Primarily, baPWV was investigated as an independent predictor of postoperative AKI development; secondarily, the patients were divided into high and low PWV groups according to the optimal baPWV cut-off value. Postoperative complications, mortality, and mid-term survival were compared between the two groups.AKI developed in 30 patients (18.3%). Univariate analysis showed that AKI was significantly associated with baPWV (20.2±7.3 vs. 16.2±2.8 m/s, p < 0.001), age, preoperative serum creatinine, and EuroSCORE. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed baPWV as independently associated with postoperative AKI even after adjustment for preoperative creatinine, old age (> 75 years), hypertension, diabetes under insulin therapy, and EuroSCORE. Moreover, area under the curve (AUC) analysis indicated that PWV can predict AKI better than preoperative creatinine levels (AUC, 0.781 [95% confidence interval, 0.688-0.874] vs. 0.680 [0.568-0.792]). The group-dividing baPWV cut-off value for AKI was 19 m/s. There were no 30-day mortality. The in-hospital mortality rates in the high and the low PWV groups were 2.2% (n = 1) and 0.8% (n = 1), respectively (p = 0.484). Midterm survival rates were not different between the two groups, but the rate of composite neurologic complication composed of stroke and delirium, was higher, and rate of mechanical ventilatory support was longer, in the high PWV group.Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity was an independent predictor of postoperative AKI following off-pump CABG, and high baPWVs may affect the composite neurologic outcome and the duration of mechanical ventilatory support."
https://openalex.org/W3023877562,"The groundwater biome is a poorly characterized habitat hypothesized to harbor uniquely diverse bacterial communities; the degree to which these communities differ from associated soils is a central question in environmental microbiology. We characterized the Bacterial community composition in 37 aquifer and 32 surface soil samples across the island of O‘ahu, Hawaiʻi. Several bacterial phyla (Acetothermia, Omnitrophica, Parcubacteria, Peregrinibacteria) relatively abundant in the aquifer samples were rare to absent in the soils. Immense bacterial diversity detected in the deep aquifers indicates that these environments are not as homogenous as expected, but provide various niches and energy sources for wide variety of bacteria. A small proportion of OTUs were widespread in all the basal (0.63%) and all the dike aquifer (0.31%) samples. However, these core bacteria comprised an average of 31.8% (ranging 16.2%-62.0%) and 15.4% (0.1%-31.5%) of all sequences isolated from the basal and dike aquifers respectively. Bacterial community composition correlated significantly with the sodium, sulfate, potassium, total dissolved solids, nitrate, conductivity, and pH in the basal aquifers, while phosphate and bicarbonate levels were also highly important when dike water samples were included in the analyses. This was consistent with high relative abundance of putative chemolithoautoroph taxa in the aquifer communities relative to soils. Targeted molecular and culture-based fecal indicator microbial analyses indicated good water quality of aquifers. The dominance of unique, deeply branching lineages in tropical aquifers emphasizes a large adaptive potential in O‘ahu’s aquifers; variability among groundwater samples suggests that aquifer habitats are surprisingly variable potentially harboring a variety of chemolithotrophic energy sources. Although parallel analyses of conventional and alternative indicators indicated good groundwater quality, this study calls for groundwater monitoring programs which would consider public as well as ecosystem health."
https://openalex.org/W3021722489,"Ebb-and-flow subirrigation systems are highly efficient, water-saving and environmentally friendly. However, one concern with these recirculating systems is the possible transmission of plant pathogens. Here, through 16S rRNA-targeted Illumina sequencing, the bacterial dynamics in a recirculating nutrient solution were characterized for cucumber plug seedlings cultivated in an ebb-and-flow system in summer and winter. Both the bacterial number and diversity in the nutrient solution increased immediately after the first irrigation cycle; then, these values were gradually stable with recirculating irrigation. In summer and winter, different bacterial compositions and changing patterns were observed. In summer, the predominant genera in the nutrient solution included Comamonas, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Reyranella, Sphingobium, Bradyrhizobium, Sphingomonas, and Acidovorax. Of those genera, during recirculating irrigation, the relative abundance of Bradyrhizobium gradually decreased, whereas those of Pseudomonas, Reyranella, Sphingobium, Sphingomonas, and Acidovorax gradually increased. In winter, the bacterial communities were mainly composed of Nevskia, Bosea, Sphingobium, Acidovorax, Pseudomonas, and Hydrocarboniphaga. Of those genera, the relative abundance of Bosea, Sphingobium, and Acidovorax showed an increasing trend, whereas those of Nevskia and Hydrocarboniphaga decreased overall. Furthermore, in both summer and winter, no plant pathogenic bacteria on cucumber could be detected; however, some potentially beneficial bacteria, including Comamonas testosteroni, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. koreensis and Sphingobium yanoikuyae, colonized the nutrient solution and exhibited increased relative abundances during irrigation. The colonization of these bacteria might facilitate the plant growth promotion. Inoculation of the microbes from the effluent nutrient solution also promoted the growth of cucumber seedlings, but did not lead to any disease. The present data elucidate the bacterial dynamics in a cucumber cultivation ebb-and-flow system and provide useful information for biological control during cucumber seedling production."
https://openalex.org/W3023613271,"The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing proteins (NOD) 1 and 2 are mammalian cytosolic pattern recognition receptors sensing bacterial peptidoglycan fragments in order to initiate cytokine expression and pathogen host defense. Since endothelial cells are relevant cells for pathogen recognition at the blood/tissue interface, we here analyzed the role of NOD1- and NOD2-dependently expressed microRNAs (miRNAs, miR) for cytokine regulation in murine pulmonary endothelial cells. The induction of inflammatory cytokines in response to NOD1 and NOD2 was confirmed by increased expression of tumour necrosis factor (Tnf)-α and interleukin (Il)-6. MiRNA expression profiling revealed NOD1- and NOD2-dependently regulated miRNA candidates, of which miR-147-3p, miR-200a-3p, and miR-298-5p were subsequently validated in pulmonary endothelial cells isolated from Nod1/2-deficient mice. Analysis of the two down-regulated candidates miR-147-3p and miR-298-5p revealed predicted binding sites in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the murine Tnf-α and Il-6 mRNA. Consequently, transfection of endothelial cells with miRNA mimics decreased Tnf-α and Il-6 mRNA levels. Finally, a novel direct interaction of miR-298-5p with the 3' UTR of the Il-6 mRNA was uncovered by luciferase reporter assays. We here identified a mechanism of miRNA-down-regulation by NOD stimulation thereby enabling the induction of inflammatory gene expression in endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W3023792210,"Background Peer support provided by experienced and/or trained “expert” women living with HIV has been adopted by prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) programs across sub-Saharan Africa. While there is ample data on HIV status disclosure among non-expert women, there is little data on disclosure among such expert women, who support other women living with HIV. Objective This study compared HIV disclosure rates between expert and non-expert mothers living with HIV, and contextualized quantitative findings with qualitative data from expert women. Methods We compared survey data on HIV disclosure to male partners and family/friends from 37 expert and 100 non-expert mothers living with HIV in rural North-Central Nigeria. Four focus group discussions with expert mothers provided further context on disclosure to male partners, extended family and peers. Chi square and Fisher’s exact tests were applied to quantitative data. Qualitative data were manually analyzed using a Grounded Theory approach. Results Two-thirds of the 137 participants were 21–30 years old; 89.8% were married, and 52.3% had secondary-level education. Disclosure to male partners was higher among expert (100.0%) versus non-expert mothers (85.0%), p = 0.035. Disclosure to anyone (93.1% vs 80.8%, p = 0.156), and knowledge of male partners’ HIV status were similar (75.7% versus 66.7%, p = 0.324) between expert and non-expert mothers, respectively. With respect to male partners, HIV serodiscordance rates were also similar (46.4% vs 55.6%, p = 0.433). Group discussions indicated that expert mothers did not consistently disclose to their mentored clients, with community-level stigma and discrimination stated as major reasons for this non-disclosure. Conclusions Expert mothers experience similar disclosure barriers as their non-expert peers, especially regarding disclosure outside of intimate relationships. Thus, attention to expert mothers’ coping skills and disclosure status, particularly to mentored clients is important to maximize the impact of peer support in PMTCT.

The US and Canada are comparable countries with markedly different rates of firearm ownership, providing an opportunity to estimate suicide fatalities that could be averted in the US with a lower rate of firearm ownership.We compared 2016 US suicide fatality rates-standardized within fourteen sex-specific age groups to reflect the ethnic composition of Canada-to 2016 Canadian suicide rates. We then calculated the number and proportion of suicides that could be averted in the US if the US had the same rates of suicide as in Canada.If the US had the same suicide rates as in Canada, we estimate there would be approximately 25.9% fewer US suicide fatalities, equivalent to 11,630 suicide fatalities averted each year. This decline would be driven by a 79.3% lower rate of firearm-specific suicide fatalities. The male suicide fatality rate would be 28.8% lower and equivalent to 9,992 fewer suicide fatalities each year. The female suicide fatality rate would be 16.0% lower and equivalent to 1,638 fewer suicide fatalities each year. While 36% of firearm suicide fatalities could be replaced by non-firearm suicide fatalities, 64% of firearm fatalities could be averted entirely.US policymakers may wish to consider policies that would reduce rates of firearm ownership, given that that about 26% of US suicide fatalities might be averted if the US had the same suicide rates as in Canada, a country with drastically lower firearm ownership rates."

Although the incidence of pertussis was reduced through vaccination, during the last thirty years it has returned to high levels in a number of countries. This resurgence has been linked to the switch from the use of whole-cell to acellular vaccines. Protection afforded by acellular vaccines appears to be short-lived compared to that afforded by whole cell vaccines. In order to inform future vaccine improvement by identifying immune correlates of protection, a human challenge model of B. pertussis colonisation has been developed. Accurate measurement of colonisation status in this model has required development of a qPCR-based assay to enumerate B. pertussis in samples that distinguishes between viable and dead bacteria. Here we report the development of this assay and its performance in the quantification of B. pertussis from human challenge model samples. This assay has future utility in diagnostic labs and in research where a quantitative measure of both B. pertussis number and viability is required."

In this article, we describe the methodology, characteristics and contents of this web-based resource, as well as its web traffic and media impact since it was launched. Nutrimedia uses a systematic process to evaluate common beliefs, claims from newspapers and advertising identified and selected by its research team, as well as questions from the public. After formulating a structured question for each claim, we conduct a pragmatic search, prioritizing guidelines and/or systematic reviews. We evaluate the certainty of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, and classify the veracity of each claim into seven categories (true, probably true, possibly true, possibly false, probably false, false, and uncertain). For each evaluation, we develop a scientific report, a plain language summary, a summary of findings table, and, in some cases, a video. From November 2017 to May 2019, we published 30 evaluations (21 were related to foods, six to diets, and three to supplements), most of which were triggered by questions from the public (40%; 12/30). Overall, nearly half of the claims were classified as uncertain (47%; 14/30). Nutrimedia received 47,265 visitors, with a total of 181,360 pages viewed. The project and its results were reported in 84 written media and 386 websites from Spain and 14 other countries, mostly from Latin America. To our knowledge, Nutrimedia is the first web-based resource for the public that evaluates the certainty of evidence and the veracity of nutrition claims using the GRADE approach. The scientific rigor combined with the use of friendly presentation formats are distinctive features of this resource, developed to help the public to make informed choices about nutrition."
https://openalex.org/W3023492245,"Biased processing of disgust-related stimuli is increasingly discussed in addition to fear-related processing as a maintenance factor for contamination-based obsessive-compulsive disorder (C-OCD). However, the differential impact of fear and disgust on biased processing in C-OCD is not yet completely understood. Because it is difficult to distinguish the two emotions in self-report assessment by directly addressing the specific emotions, a text paragraph-based interpretation bias paradigm was applied to more implicitly assess emotions. For the text-based interpretation bias paradigm, disgust-related, fear-related, disgust-fear-ambiguous and neutral text paragraphs describing everyday life situations were developed and validated in a pre-study (N = 205). Fifty-nine healthy participants watched either disgust- or fear-inducing movies and afterwards rated their experienced emotional response to the text paragraphs. The results show that fear and disgust components of an emotional response to mixed-emotional situations are strongly influenced by the situational context, and across the levels of trait contamination fear people did not differ in their fear experiences to everyday situations (which was overall strong), but in their disgust experiences. These findings highlight the strength of situational context on interpretation bias for mixed-emotional disorders and the important role of disgust for C-OCD."

Such imbalance puts strong downward pressure on overall GC-content. However, along protracted paths to fixation, S→W mutations are much less likely to propagate than W→S mutations. The magnitude of relative propagation disadvantages for S→W mutations is inexplicable by any currently-accepted model. This fact forced us to re-examine the quantitative features of Biased Gene Conversion (BGC) theory. Revised parameters of BGC that, per average individual, convert 7-14 W base pairs into S pairs, would account for the S-content turnover differences between new and old mutations, and make BGC an instrumental force for nucleotide dynamics and evolution. BGC should thus be considered seriously in both theories and biomedical practice. In particular, BGC should be taken into account during allele imputations, where missing SNP alleles are computationally predicted based on the information about several neighboring alleles. Finally, we analyzed the effect of neighboring nucleotide context on the mutation frequencies, dynamics, and GC-composition turnover. For this purpose, we examined genomic regions having extremely biased nucleotide compositions (enriched for S-, W-, purine/pyrimidine strand asymmetry, or AC/GT-strand asymmetry). It was found that point mutations in these regions preferentially degrade the nucleotide inhomogeneities, decreasing the sequence biases. Degradation of sequence bias is highest for novel mutations, and considerably lower for older mutations (those widespread across populations). Besides BGC, there may be additional, still uncharacterized molecular mechanisms that either preserve genomic regions with biased nucleotide compositions from mutational degradation or fail to degrade such inhomogeneities in specific chromosomal regions."
https://openalex.org/W3021836818,"The horizontal transfer of plasmids is a key mechanism behind the spread of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. So far, transfer rate constants were measured for a variety of plasmids, donors and recipients. The employed strains typically had a long history in laboratories. Existing data are, therefore, not necessarily representative for real-world environments. Moreover, information on the inter-strain variability of plasmid transfer rates is scarce. Using a high-throughput approach, we studied the uptake of RP4 by various Escherichia coli recipients using Serratia marcescens as the donor. The recipient strains were isolated from human-borne sewage and river sediments. The rate constants of plasmid transfer generally followed a log-normal distribution with considerable variance. The rate constants for good and poor recipients (95 and 5% quantile) differed by more than three orders of magnitude. Specifically, the inter-strain variability of the rate constant was large in comparison to alterations induced by low-level antibiotic exposure. We did not find evidence for diverging efficiencies of plasmid uptake between E. coli recipients of different origin. On average, strains isolated from river bottom sediments were equally efficient in the acquisition of RP4 as isolates extracted from sewage. We conclude that E. coli strains persisting in the aquatic environment and those of direct human origin share a similar intrinsic potential for the conjugative uptake of certain plasmids. In view of the large inter-strain variability, we propose to work towards probabilistic modeling of the environmental spread of antibiotic resistance."

As bone and arachnoid trabeculae share the same collagen type, we investigated possible connections between the skull Hounsfield unit (HU) values and shunt-dependent hydrocephalus (SDHC) in patients that received cranioplasty after DC for traumatic acute subdural hematoma (SDH).We measured HU values in the frontal bone and internal occipital protuberance from admission brain CT. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to identify the optimal cut-off skull HU values for predicting SDHC in patients receiving cranioplasty after DC due to traumatic acute SDH. We investigated independent predictive factors for SDHC occurrence using multivariable logistic regression analysis.A total of 162 patients (>15 years of age) were enrolled in the study over an 11-year period from two university hospitals. Multivariable logistic analysis revealed that the group with simultaneous frontal skull HU ≤797.4 and internal occipital protuberance HU ≤586.5 (odds ratio, 8.57; 95% CI, 3.05 to 24.10; P<0.001) was the only independent predictive factor for SDHC in patients who received cranioplasty after DC for traumatic acute SDH.Our study reveals a potential relationship between possible low bone mineral density and development of SDHC in traumatic acute SDH patients who had undergone DC. Our findings provide deeper insight into the association between low bone mineral density and hydrocephalus after DC for traumatic acute SDH."
https://openalex.org/W3023451681,"Objective The World Health Organization created the Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) criteria in 2011 to monitor influenza (flu)-related hospitalization. Many studies have since used the SARI case definition as inclusion criteria for surveillance studies. We sought to determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the SARI criteria for detecting ten different respiratory viruses in a Middle Eastern pediatric cohort. Materials and methods The data for this study comes from a prospective acute respiratory surveillance study of hospitalized children <2 years in Amman, Jordan from March 16, 2010 to March 31, 2013. Participants were recruited if they had a fever and/or respiratory symptoms. Nasal and throat swabs were obtained and tested by real-time RT-PCR for eleven viruses. Subjects meeting SARI criteria were determined post-hoc. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the SARI case definition for detecting ten different viruses were calculated and results were stratified by age. Results Of the 3,175 patients enrolled, 3,164 were eligible for this study, with a median age of 3.5 months, 60.4% male, and 82% virus-positive (44% RSV and 3.8% flu). The sensitivity and specificity of the SARI criteria for detecting virus-positive patients were 44% and 77.9%, respectively. Sensitivity of SARI criteria for any virus was lowest in children <3 months at 22.4%. Removing fever as a criterion improved the sensitivity by 65.3% for detecting RSV in children <3 months; whereas when cough was removed, the sensitivity improved by 45.5% for detecting flu in same age group. Conclusions The SARI criteria have poor sensitivity for detecting RSV, flu, and other respiratory viruses—particularly in children <3 months. Researchers and policy makers should use caution if using the criteria to estimate burden of disease in children."
https://openalex.org/W3023623671,"The assay for transposase-accessible chromatin followed by sequencing (ATAC-seq) is an inexpensive protocol for measuring open chromatin regions. ATAC-seq is also relatively simple and requires fewer cells than many other high-throughput sequencing protocols. Therefore, it is tractable in numerous settings where other high throughput assays are challenging to impossible. Hence it is important to understand the limits of what can be inferred from ATAC-seq data. In this work, we leverage ATAC-seq to predict the presence of nascent transcription. Nascent transcription assays are the current gold standard for identifying regions of active transcription, including markers for functional transcription factor (TF) binding. We combine mapped short reads from ATAC-seq with the underlying peak sequence, to determine regions of active transcription genome-wide. We show that a hybrid signal/sequence representation classified using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can identify these regions across different cell types."
https://openalex.org/W3023768512,"Objectives To examine patterns of generic escitalopram initiation and substitution among Medicare beneficiaries. Methods This retrospective new user cohort used a 5% random sample of 2013–2015 Medicare administrative claims data. Fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries continuously enrolled in Parts A, B, and D during a 6-month washout period prior to their initial generic or brand oral escitalopram prescriptions were included (n = 12,351). The primary outcomes were generic escitalopram treatment initiation, and among brand escitalopram initiators, generic substitution within 12 months. Patient demographics, health service utilization, and prescription level factors were measured and assessed. Results Among all escitalopram initiators, about 88.2% Medicare beneficiaries initiated generic escitalopram. Beneficiaries who were younger age, male, residing in non-Northeast regions or urban area, in the Part D plan deductible benefit phase, and filling prescriptions at community/retail pharmacies were more likely to initiate generic treatment. Among brand escitalopram initiators (n = 1,464), about 20.7% switched to generic escitalopram, 31.2% switched to another alternative antidepressant, 25.1% discontinued treatment, and 8.7% were lost to follow up or passed away within 12 months after brand initiation. Factors associated with generic escitalopram substitution included region (Midwest vs. Northeast, adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.04–2.05), pre-index hospitalization (HR = 1.31; 95% CI = 1.16–1.48) and lower escitalopram average daily dosage (HR = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.95–0.99). Conclusions In 2013–2015, almost 90% Medicare beneficiaries initiated generic escitalopram treatment. Among brand escitalopram initiators, about 1 in 5 patients switched to generic escitalopram within 1 year, as compared to 1 in 4 or 1 in 3 who discontinued current or switched to alternative treatment, respectively. Medicare beneficiary’s geographic region was independently associated with generic escitalopram initiation and substitution. Findings from this study not only provide up-to-date evidence in generic escitalopram use patterns among Medicare population, but also can guide educational and practice interventions to further increase generic escitalopram use."
