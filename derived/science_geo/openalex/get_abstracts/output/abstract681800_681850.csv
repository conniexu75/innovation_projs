https://openalex.org/W3203306871,"Plant immunity is activated upon pathogen perception and often affects growth and yield when it is constitutively active. How plants fine-tune immune homeostasis in their natural habitats remains elusive. Here, we discover a conserved immune suppression network in cereals that orchestrates immune homeostasis, centering on a Ca2+-sensor, RESISTANCE OF RICE TO DISEASES1 (ROD1). ROD1 promotes reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging by stimulating catalase activity, and its protein stability is regulated by ubiquitination. ROD1 disruption confers resistance to multiple pathogens, whereas a natural ROD1 allele prevalent in indica rice with agroecology-specific distribution enhances resistance without yield penalty. The fungal effector AvrPiz-t structurally mimics ROD1 and activates the same ROS-scavenging cascade to suppress host immunity and promote virulence. We thus reveal a molecular framework adopted by both host and pathogen that integrates Ca2+ sensing and ROS homeostasis to suppress plant immunity, suggesting a principle for breeding disease-resistant, high-yield crops."
https://openalex.org/W3202521679,"Determining how cells vary with their local signaling environment and organize into distinct cellular communities is critical for understanding processes as diverse as development, aging, and cancer. Here we introduce EcoTyper, a machine learning framework for large-scale identification and validation of cell states and multicellular communities from bulk, single-cell, and spatially resolved gene expression data. When applied to 12 major cell lineages across 16 types of human carcinoma, EcoTyper identified 69 transcriptionally defined cell states. Most states were specific to neoplastic tissue, ubiquitous across tumor types, and significantly prognostic. By analyzing cell-state co-occurrence patterns, we discovered ten clinically distinct multicellular communities with unexpectedly strong conservation, including three with myeloid and stromal elements linked to adverse survival, one enriched in normal tissue, and two associated with early cancer development. This study elucidates fundamental units of cellular organization in human carcinoma and provides a framework for large-scale profiling of cellular ecosystems in any tissue."
https://openalex.org/W3203602359,"The prefrontal cortex (PFC) and its connections with the mediodorsal thalamus are crucial for cognitive flexibility and working memory1 and are thought to be altered in disorders such as autism2,3 and schizophrenia4,5. Although developmental mechanisms that govern the regional patterning of the cerebral cortex have been characterized in rodents6-9, the mechanisms that underlie the development of PFC-mediodorsal thalamus connectivity and the lateral expansion of the PFC with a distinct granular layer 4 in primates10,11 remain unknown. Here we report an anterior (frontal) to posterior (temporal), PFC-enriched gradient of retinoic acid, a signalling molecule that regulates neural development and function12-15, and we identify genes that are regulated by retinoic acid in the neocortex of humans and macaques at the early and middle stages of fetal development. We observed several potential sources of retinoic acid, including the expression and cortical expansion of retinoic-acid-synthesizing enzymes specifically in primates as compared to mice. Furthermore, retinoic acid signalling is largely confined to the prospective PFC by CYP26B1, a retinoic-acid-catabolizing enzyme, which is upregulated in the prospective motor cortex. Genetic deletions in mice revealed that retinoic acid signalling through the retinoic acid receptors RXRG and RARB, as well as CYP26B1-dependent catabolism, are involved in proper molecular patterning of prefrontal and motor areas, development of PFC-mediodorsal thalamus connectivity, intra-PFC dendritic spinogenesis and expression of the layer 4 marker RORB. Together, these findings show that retinoic acid signalling has a critical role in the development of the PFC and, potentially, in its evolutionary expansion."
https://openalex.org/W3204913535,"Functional delivery of mRNA has high clinical potential. Previous studies established that mRNAs can be delivered to cells in vitro and in vivo via RNA-loaded lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Here we describe an alternative approach using exosomes, the only biologically normal nanovesicle. In contrast to LNPs, which elicited pronounced cellular toxicity, exosomes had no adverse effects in vitro or in vivo at any dose tested. Moreover, mRNA-loaded exosomes were characterized by efficient mRNA encapsulation (∼90%), high mRNA content, consistent size, and a polydispersity index under 0.2. Using an mRNA encoding the red light-emitting luciferase Antares2, we observed that mRNA-loaded exosomes were superior to mRNA-loaded LNPs at delivering functional mRNA into human cells in vitro. Injection of Antares2 mRNA-loaded exosomes also led to strong light emission following injection into the vitreous fluid of the eye or into the tissue of skeletal muscle in mice. Furthermore, we show that repeated injection of Antares2 mRNA-loaded exosomes drove sustained luciferase expression across six injections spanning at least 10 weeks, without evidence of signal attenuation or adverse injection site responses. Consistent with these findings, we observed that exosomes loaded with mRNAs encoding immunogenic forms of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike and Nucleocapsid proteins induced long-lasting cellular and humoral responses to both. Taken together, these results demonstrate that exosomes can be used to deliver functional mRNA to and into cells in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3202114531,"The similarities and differences between nervous systems of various species result from developmental constraints and specific adaptations1-4. Comparative analyses of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a cerebral cortex region involved in higher-order cognition and complex social behaviours, have identified true and potential human-specific structural and molecular specializations4-8, such as an exaggerated PFC-enriched anterior-posterior dendritic spine density gradient5. These changes are probably mediated by divergence in spatiotemporal gene regulation9-17, which is particularly prominent in the midfetal human cortex15,18-20. Here we analysed human and macaque transcriptomic data15,20 and identified a transient PFC-enriched and laminar-specific upregulation of cerebellin 2 (CBLN2), a neurexin (NRXN) and glutamate receptor-δ GRID/GluD-associated synaptic organizer21-27, during midfetal development that coincided with the initiation of synaptogenesis. Moreover, we found that species differences in level of expression and laminar distribution of CBLN2 are, at least in part, due to Hominini-specific deletions containing SOX5-binding sites within a retinoic acid-responsive CBLN2 enhancer. In situ genetic humanization of the mouse Cbln2 enhancer drives increased and ectopic laminar Cbln2 expression and promotes PFC dendritic spine formation. These findings suggest a genetic and molecular basis for the anterior-posterior cortical gradient and disproportionate increase in the Hominini PFC of dendritic spines and a developmental mechanism that may link dysfunction of the NRXN-GRID-CBLN2 complex to the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3202133959,"Studying the progress and trend of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) transmission mode will help effectively curb its spread. Some commonly used infectious disease prediction models are introduced. The hybrid model is proposed, which overcomes the disadvantages of the logistic model's inability to predict the number of confirmed diagnoses and the drawbacks of too many tuning parameters of the SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) model. The realization and superiority of the prediction of the proposed model are proven through experiments. At the same time, the influence of different initial values of the parameters that need to be debugged on the hybrid model is further studied, and the mean error is used to quantify the prediction effect. By forecasting epidemic size and peak time and simulating the effects of public health interventions, this paper aims to clarify the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and recommend operation suggestions to slow down the epidemic. It is suggested that the quick detection of cases, sufficient implementation of quarantine and public self-protection behaviours are critical to slow down the epidemic."
https://openalex.org/W3203297701,"Owing to their ability to break glycosidic bonds in recalcitrant crystalline polysaccharides such as cellulose, the catalysis effected by lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) is of major interest. Kinetics of these reductant-dependent, monocopper enzymes is complicated by the insoluble nature of the cellulose substrate and parallel, enzyme-dependent, and enzyme-independent side reactions between the reductant and oxygen-containing cosubstrates. Here, we provide kinetic characterization of cellulose peroxygenase (oxidative cleavage of glycosidic bonds in cellulose) and reductant peroxidase (oxidation of the reductant) activities of the LPMO TrAA9A of the cellulose-degrading model fungus Trichoderma reesei. The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km(H2O2)) of the cellulose peroxygenase reaction (kcat = 8.5 s−1, and Km(H2O2)=30μM) was an order of magnitude higher than that of the reductant (ascorbic acid) peroxidase reaction. The turnover of H2O2 in the ascorbic acid peroxidase reaction followed the ping-pong mechanism and led to irreversible inactivation of the enzyme with a probability of 0.0072. Using theoretical analysis, we suggest a relationship between the half-life of LPMO, the values of kinetic parameters, and the concentrations of the reactants.

LPMOs are widespread in nature, and they are classified within several auxiliary activity families in the database of carbohydrate-active enzymes (6Levasseur A. Drula E. Lombard V. Coutinho P.M.

Besides polysaccharide substrate and oxygen-containing cosubstrate (O2/H2O2), LPMOs need a reductant for their activity (9Kracher D. Scheiblbrandner S. Felice A.K.G. Breslmayr E. Preims M.

Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases in enzymatic processing of lignocellulosic biomass.ACS Catal. 2019; 9: 4970-4991Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In H2O2-driven oxidative cleavage of glycosidic bond (polysaccharide peroxygenase reaction), the reductant is needed only for the initial priming reduction of LPMO-Cu(II) resting state to a catalytically active LPMO-Cu(I) (12Chylenski P. Bissaro B. Sørlie M. Røhr Å.K. Varnai A. Horn S.J. Eijsink V.G.H. Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases in enzymatic processing of lignocellulosic biomass.ACS Catal. 2019; 9: 4970-4991Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). LPMO-Cu(I) activates H2O2 leading to the hydroxylation and cleavage of glycosidic bond (Fig. 1) (12Chylenski P. Bissaro B. Sørlie M. Røhr Å.K. Varnai A. Horn S.J. Eijsink V.G.H. Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases in enzymatic processing of lignocellulosic biomass.ACS Catal. 2019; 9: 4970-4991Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). When the LPMO active site is free from polysaccharide, the LPMO-Cu(I) can be reoxidized by H2O2 to LPMO-Cu(II). The latter results in the stoichiometric oxidation of the reductant and is referred to as the reductant peroxidase reaction (Fig. 1). Kinetic studies of LPMOs are complicated by the insoluble nature of the substrate, various side reactions such as reductant oxidase/peroxidase activity of LPMOs, and inactivation of LPMOs in reductant peroxidase reaction (13Eijsink V.G.H.

Biofuels. 2019; 12: 58Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an enzyme-independent oxidation of the reductant by O2 often leads to the formation of H2O2 (14Brander S. Horvath I.

These multiple parallel side reactions not only complicate the analysis of the kinetic data but may also lead to wrong conclusions regarding the nature of the cosubstrate as exemplified by the LPMO of the bacterium Serratia marcescens (SmAA10A), which was first identified as a monooxygenase (1Vaaje-Kolstad G.

Here, we used a uniformly 14C-labeled cellulose substrate that enabled kinetic characterization of the H2O2-driven cellulose peroxygenase reaction by the LPMO (TrAA9A) of the model fungus Trichoderma reesei (also known as Hypocrea jecorina). The catalytic efficiency of the cellulose peroxygenase reaction (2.9 × 105 M−1 s−1) was an order of magnitude higher than that of the reductant (ascorbate, AscA) peroxidase reaction. The AscA peroxidase reaction also led to the irreversible inactivation of TrAA9A with the probability of 0.0072. The use of a 14C-labeled polysaccharide substrate enables sensitive detection of soluble LPMO products (20Kuusk S. Bissaro B. Kuusk P. Forsberg Z. Eijsink V.G.H. Sørlie M. Väljamäe P.

Here, we provide a kinetic characterization of the cellulolytic peroxygenase reaction of an LPMO using uniformly 14C-labeled bacterial microcrystalline cellulose (BMCC) as a substrate and TrAA9A as a model LPMO. TrAA9A has been shown to release both C1 and C4 oxidized sugar products from cellulose (40Hansson H. Karkehabadi S. Mikkelsen N. Douglas N.R. Kim S. Lam A. Kaper T. Kelemen B. Meier K.K. Jones S.M.

Before we describe the results, we note that, provided with the value of the stoichiometry showing the amount of the released soluble products per molecule of H2O2 consumed, the regioselectivity of oxidation and the distribution of products between the soluble and the insoluble fractions are not important in deriving the values of kinetic parameters (20Kuusk S.

In the presence of the reductant, ascorbic acid (AscA), and H2O2, TrAA9A released 14C-labeled soluble products from BMCC (Fig. S1). No release of radioactivity was observed in the absence of added H2O2 (Fig. S1), suggesting that the possible TrAA9A monooxygenase reaction and the production of H2O2 in TrAA9A-dependent (AscA oxidase) and TrAA9A-independent reactions are insignificant under our study conditions. The rate of the release of soluble products (expressed in glucose equivalents, Glceq) increased with the increasing concentration of AscA (Fig. S2). The apparent half-saturating concentration of AscA was around 0.1 mM, and based on these results, we choose 1 mM AscA in the further experiments of BMCC degradation. Progress curves of the release of soluble Glceq from BMCC by TrAA9A at different [H2O2] are shown in Figure 2A. Single exponential function was used as a first approximation in the analysis of the progress curves (20Kuusk S. Bissaro B. Kuusk P. Forsberg Z. Eijsink V.G.H. Sørlie M. Väljamäe P.

[Glceq]max first increased with increasing [H2O2] but started to decrease at H2O2 concentrations above 50 μM (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, the initial decrease of kobs with [H2O2] was followed by its increase at [H2O2] above 50 μM (Fig. 2C). These kinetic signatures are similar to those observed at the H2O2-driven degradation of chitin by SmAA10A and suggest that the irreversible inactivation of LPMO takes place in parallel with the polysaccharide peroxygenase reaction (20Kuusk S. Bissaro B. Kuusk P. Forsberg Z. Eijsink V.G.H. Sørlie M. Väljamäe P. Kinetics of H2O2-driven degradation of chitin by a bacterial lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 523-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). At low [H2O2], the H2O2 is depleted in the cellulose peroxygenase reaction, and [Glceq]max represents the maximum number of soluble products that can be released by the given amount of H2O2. At high [H2O2], the enzyme is inactivated (with the half-life of ln2/kobs) before H2O2 is depleted in the cellulose peroxygenase reaction (20Kuusk S. Bissaro B. Kuusk P. Forsberg Z. Eijsink V.G.H.

Chem. 2018; 293: 523-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The dependency of the initial rates of Glceq formation on [H2O2] was consistent with the Michaelis–Menten equation (Fig. 2D). The Michaelis–Menten curves measured at BMCC concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 g l−1 overlapped within experiment scatter, indicating that the enzyme was saturated with cellulose (Fig. S4A). Measurements of the concentration of the cellulose-free TrAA9A also suggested strong binding to BMCC (Fig. S5) in the presence of 1 mM AscA. The binding was significantly weaker in the absence of AscA (Fig. S5). High affinity to BMCC does not allow precise measurement of initial rates at the subsaturating BMCC concentrations (i.e., very low), and thus, we cannot assess the dependency of apparent Vmax and Km(H2O2) values on [BMCC] (Fig. S4, B–D). Using an average value of initial rates measured at BMCC concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 g l−1 (Fig. 2D), we estimated the true Vmax and Km(H2O2) values of 1.28 ± 0.05 μM Glceq s−1 and 30 ± 5 μM, respectively. Considering the total concentration of TrAA9A of 0.05 μM, Vmax translates to the kcat value of 25.6 ± 1.0 soluble Glceq s−1. To find the kcat value for the cellulolytic peroxygenase reaction, one must know the value of the stoichiometry coefficient (n), which shows an average number of soluble products (in Glceq) released per molecule of H2O2 consumed in the peroxygenase reaction. The value of n can be found from the [Glceq]max values measured under conditions that favor the cellulose peroxygenase reaction, that is, at low [H2O2] and high [BMCC]. The [Glceq]max values measured using 10 μM H2O2 were independent of [BMCC] (Fig. 2B), and based on these figures, we estimated the value of n = 2.90 ± 0.05 soluble Glceq/H2O2. We also used an alternative approach for the determination of the value of n, where H2O2 was in situ produced by the glucose/glucose oxidase (GO) reaction with the rate of 1.2 ± 0.1 μM min−1 (Fig. S6A). The time curves of Glceq formation were independent of [TrAA9A], indicating that the rate is limited by the GO reaction but deviated from linearity with the effect being larger at lower [BMCC] (Fig. S6B). However, at the shortest incubation time (10 min), the rate of Glceq formation was independent of [BMCC], and based on these data, we estimated the value of n = 3.1 ± 0.2 soluble Glceq/H2O2 (Fig. S6B). Combining the n values measured using two different approaches results in an average n value of 3.0 ± 0.15 soluble Glceq/H2O2 for the TrAA9A/BMCC system. Provided with the value of n, we can now calculate the kcat value of 8.5 ± 0.4 s−1 and kcat/Km(H2O2) value of 290,000 ± 50,000 M−1 s−1 for the cellulolytic peroxygenase reaction of TrAA9A (Table 1).Table 1Kinetic parameters of the cellulose peroxygenase and the ascorbate peroxidase reactions of TrAA9AKinetic parameterReactionaAll reactions were made at pH 5 and 25 °C.Cellulose peroxygenaseAscorbate peroxidasekcat (s−1)8.5 ± 0.42.1bBecause of insufficient saturation with AscA, these figures must be treated with caution.Km(H2O2)(μM)30 ± 578bBecause of insufficient saturation with AscA, these figures must be treated with caution.kcat/Km(H2O2)(M−1s−1)290,000 ± 50,00026,900 ± 3000Probability of inactivation (Pi)0.0072 ± 0.0003kcat/Km(H2O2) of inactivation (M−1 s−1)195 ± 23a All reactions were made at pH 5 and 25 °C.b Because of insufficient saturation with AscA, these figures must be treated with caution.

Chronic inflammation during obesity contributes to disease risk and is significantly more robust in males. Prior work demonstrated that compared with obese males, obese females have reduced proinflammatory adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs). Given the paucity of data on how sex hormones contribute to macrophage responses in obesity, we sought to understand the role of sex hormones in promoting obesity-induced myeloid inflammation. We used gonadectomy, estrogen receptor-deficient alpha chimeras, and androgen-insensitive mice to model sex hormone deficiency. These models were evaluated in diet-induced obesity conditions (high-fat diet [HFD]) and in vitro myeloid assays. We found that ovariectomy increased weight gain and adiposity. Ovariectomized females had increased ATMs and bone marrow myeloid colonies compared with sham-gonadectomized females. In addition, castrated males exposed to HFD had improved glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and adiposity with fewer Ly6chi monocytes and bone marrow myeloid colonies compared with sham-gonadectomized males, although local adipose inflammation was enhanced. Similar findings were observed in androgen-insensitive mice; however, these mice had fewer CD11c+ ATMs, implying a developmental role for androgens in myelopoiesis and adipose inflammation. We concluded that gonadectomy results in convergence of metabolic and inflammatory responses to HFD between the sexes, and that myeloid estrogen receptor alpha contributes minimally to diet-induced inflammatory responses, whereas loss of androgen-receptor signaling improves metabolic and inflammatory outcomes. These studies demonstrate that sex hormones play a critical role in sex differences in obesity, metabolic dysfunction, and myeloid inflammation."

The prion strain-like model of disease heterogeneity suggests the existence of different conformers of Aβ. We explored this paradigm using conformation-dependent immunoassay (CDI) for Aβ and conformation-sensitive luminescent conjugated oligothiophenes (LCOs) in AD cases with variable progression rates. Mapping the Aβ conformations in the frontal, occipital, and temporal regions in 20 AD patients with CDI revealed extensive interindividual and anatomical diversity in the structural organization of Aβ with the most significant differences in the temporal cortex of rapidly progressive AD. The fluorescence emission spectra collected in situ from Aβ plaques in the same regions demonstrated considerable diversity of spectral characteristics of two LCOs-quatroformylthiophene acetic acid and heptaformylthiophene acetic acid. Heptaformylthiophene acetic acid detected a wider range of Aβ deposits, and both LCOs revealed distinct spectral attributes of diffuse and cored plaques in the temporal cortex of rapidly and slowly progressive AD and less frequent and discernible differences in the frontal and occipital cortex. These and CDI findings indicate a major conformational diversity of Aβ accumulating in the neocortex, with the most notable differences in temporal cortex of cases with shorter disease duration, and implicate distinct Aβ conformers (strains) in the rapid progression of AD."

Here, we evaluated the potential preventive effects of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum N-1 (LPN1) on gut microbiota and intestinal barrier function in rats with hyperoxaluria-induced kidney stones. Male rats were supplied with 1% ethylene glycol (EG) dissolved in drinking water for 4 weeks to develop hyperoxaluria, and some of them were administered with LPN1 for 4 weeks before EG treatment as a preventive intervention. We found that EG not only resulted hyperoxaluria and kidney stone formation, but also promoted the intestinal inflammation, elevated intestinal permeability, and gut microbiota disorders. Supplementation of LPN1 inhibited the renal crystalline deposits through reducing urinary oxalic acid and renal osteopontin and CD44 expression and improved EG-induced intestinal inflammation and barrier function by decreasing the serum LPS and TLR4/NF-κB signaling and up-regulating tight junction Claudin-2 in the colon, as well as increasing the production of short-chain fatty acid (SCFAs) and the abundance of beneficial SCFAs-producing bacteria, mainly from the families of Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae.

As a result, Sost-/- mice exhibit dramatic increases in bone formation but marked decreases in visceral and subcutaneous adipose that are secondary to alterations in lipid synthesis and utilization. While interrogating the mechanism by which sclerostin influences adipocyte metabolism, we observed paradoxical increases in the adipogenic potential and numbers of CD45- :Sca1+ :PDGFRα+ adipoprogenitors in the stromal vascular compartment of fat pads isolated from male Sost-/- mice. Lineage tracing studies indicated that sclerostin deficiency blocks the differentiation of PDGFRα+ adipoprogenitors to mature adipocytes in association with increased Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Importantly, osteoblast/osteocyte-specific Sost gene deletion mirrors the accumulation of PDGFRα+ adipoprogenitors, reduction in fat mass, and improved glucose metabolism evident in Sost-/- mice. These data indicate that bone-derived sclerostin regulates multiple facets of adipocyte physiology ranging from progenitor cell commitment to anabolic metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W3201836070,"The accumulation of fibrillar amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides alongside or within the cerebral vasculature is the hallmark of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). This condition commonly co-occurs with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and leads to cerebral microbleeds, intracranial hemorrhages, and stroke. CAA also occurs sporadically in an age-dependent fashion and can be accelerated by the presence of familial Aβ mutant peptides. Recent studies using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of vascular Aβ fibrils derived from rodents containing the double E22Q/D23N mutations indicated the presence of a novel antiparallel β-sheet structure. To address whether this structure is associated solely with the familial mutations or is a common feature of CAA, we propagated Aβ fibrils from human brain vascular tissue of patients diagnosed with nonfamilial CAA. Aβ fibrils were isolated from cerebral blood vessels using laser capture microdissection in which specific amyloid deposits were removed from thin slices of the brain tissue. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that these deposits were organized into a tight meshwork of fibrils, which FTIR measurements showed could serve as seeds to propagate the growth of Aβ40 fibrils for structural studies. Solid-state NMR measurements of the fibrils propagated from vascular amyloid showed they contained a mixture of parallel, in-register, and antiparallel β-sheet structures. The presence of fibrils with antiparallel structure derived from vascular amyloid is distinct from the typical parallel, in-register β-sheet structure that appears in fibrils derived from parenchymal amyloid in AD. These observations reveal that different microenvironments influence the structures of Aβ fibrils in the human brain."
https://openalex.org/W3202138311,"Cyclophilin A (CypA), a member of the cyclophilin family, plays a vital role in microorganismal infections, inflammatory diseases, and cancers. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine, exerting variety of effects on inflammation, immune response, hematopoiesis, and tumor proliferation. Binding of IL-6 to soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) induces pro-inflammatory trans-signaling, which has been described to be stronger than anti-inflammatory classic signaling triggered by the binding of IL-6 to membrane-bound IL-6 receptor. Here we found that upon the treatment of IL-6 and sIL-6R, CypA inhibited the ubiquitination-mediated degradation of IL-6 membrane receptor gp130 and enhanced its dimerization, thereby positively regulated the IL-6 trans-signaling and increased the expression of downstream iNOS, IL-6, and CypA. Furthermore, CypA expression could be negatively regulated by suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1). The SH2 and Box domains of SOCS1 interacted with CypA and promoted its K48-linked ubiquitination-mediated degradation, which inhibited the IL-6 trans-signaling pathway. Collectively, our findings reveal an important role of CypA in the positive and negative feedback regulation of the IL-6 trans-signaling pathway."

However, no efforts have yet been made to model or evaluate the impact of mixed polyclonal Mtb infections (infection with multiple strains) on TB diagnostic procedures other than antibiotic susceptibility testing. Here, we selected three TB clinical isolates (HN878, EAI, and IO) and purified LAM from these strains to present an integrated analytical approach of one-dimensional and two-dimensional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, as well as enzymatic digestion and site-specific mass spectrometry (MS) to probe LAM structure and behavior at multiple levels.

Succinates, lactates, hydroxybutyrate, acetate, and the hallmark of Mtb LAM-methylthioxylose (MTX), adorned the nonreducing terminal arabinan of these LAM species. Newly identified acetoxy/hydroxybutyrate was present only in LAM from EAI and IO Mtb strains. Notably, detailed LC/MS-MS unambiguously showed that all acyl modifications and the lactyl ether in LAM are at the 3-OH position of the 2-linked arabinofuranose adjacent to the terminal β-arabinofuranose. Finally, after sequential enzymatic deglycosylation of LAM, the residual glycan that has ∼50% of α-arabinofuranose -(1→5) linked did not bind to monoclonal antibody CS35.

The present study investigated the regulation of intestinal tight junction (TJ) proteins by ammonia and the underlying mechanisms in human intestinal Caco-2 cells. Ammonia (15, 30, and 60 mM) increased the permeability of the cells in a dose-dependent manner, as indicated by reduced transepithelial electrical resistance and increased dextran flux. Immunoblot and immunofluorescence analyses revealed that the ammonia-induced increase in TJ permeability reduced the membrane localization of TJ proteins such as zonula occludens (ZO)1, ZO2, occludin, claudin-1, and claudin-3. DNA microarray analysis identified a biological pathway ""response to reactive oxygen species"" enriched by ammonia treatment, indicating the induction of oxidative stress in the cells. Ammonia treatment also increased the malondialdehyde content and decreased the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione. Meanwhile, ammonia treatment-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, as indicated by the downregulation of genes associated with the electron transport chain, reduction of the cellular ATP, NADH, and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate content, and suppression of the mitochondrial membrane potential. In contrast, N-acetyl cysteine reversed the ammonia-induced impairment of TJ permeability and structure without affecting the mitochondrial parameters. Collectively, ammonia impaired the TJ barrier by increasing oxidative stress in Caco-2 cells. A mitochondrial dysfunction is possibly an event preceding ammonia-induced oxidative stress.

We studied the spatial distribution patterns of AS, AZn, AFe, ACu, AMn, and AB in cultivated soils of coastal districts of India using geostatistical approaches. Altogether 39,097 soil samples from surface (0 to 15 cm depth) layers were gathered from farm lands of 68 coastal districts. The analysis of soil samples was carried out for soil pH, electrical conductivity (EC), soil organic carbon (SOC) and AS, AZn, AFe, ACu, AMn, and AB. Soil pH, EC and SOC varied from 3.70 to 9.90, 0.01 to 7.45 dS m -1 and 0.02 to 3.74%, respectively. The concentrations of AS, AZn, AFe, ACu, AMn, and AB varied widely in the study area with their corresponding mean values were 37.4±29.4, 1.50±1.53, 27.9±35.1, 2.14±1.74, 16.9±18.4 and 1.34±1.52 mg kg -1 , respectively. The coefficient of variation values of analyzed soil parameters varied from 14.6 to 126%. The concentrations of AS, AZn, AFe, ACu, AMn, and AB were negatively and significantly correlated with soil pH and positively and significantly correlated with SOC. The geostatistical analysis indicated stable, Gaussian and exponential best-fit semivariogram models with moderate to strong spatial dependence for available nutrients. The generated spatial spreading maps revealed different distribution patterns for AS, AZn, AFe, ACu, AMn, and AB. There were variations in spatial spreading patterns of AS, AZn, AFe, ACu, AMn, and AB in east- and west-coastal area. About 62, 35, 12, 0.4, 23 and 45% of the study area had deficiency of AS, AZn, AFe, ACu, AMn, and AB, respectively.

Transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) is a ubiquitously expressed and evolutionarily conserved DNA/RNA-binding protein with varied functions, including gene transcription, mRNA splicing, exon skipping, as well as micro-RNA biogenesis (1Ou S.H.

The very first report on TDP-43 showed that it functions as a sequence-specific transcriptional repressor in human cells (1Ou S.H. Wu F. Harrich D. García-Martínez L.F. Gaynor R.B.

TDP-43 has been shown to interact with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein proteins to mediate alternative splicing (5Buratti E. Brindisi A. Giombi M. Tisminetzky S. Ayala Y.M. Baralle F.E.

The C-terminal part of TDP-43 also consists of a prion-like intrinsically disordered domain involved in forming protein aggregates (7Cushman M. Johnson B.S. King O.D. Gitler A.D. Shorter J.

Germline deletion of TDP-43 in mice proved to be embryonic lethal indicating the essential nature of the protein (9Wu L.S. Cheng W.C. Hou S.C. Yan Y.T. Jiang S.T. Shen C.K.

Although TDP-43 became widely known as a protein involved in the pathology of a number of neurodegenerative diseases following the publication by Neumann et al., in 2006 (11Neumann M. Sampathu D.M. Kwong L.K. Truax A.C. Micsenyi M.C. Chou T.T. Bruce J. Schuck T. Grossman M. Clark C.M. McCluskey L.F. Miller B.L. Masliah E. Mackenzie I.R. Feldman H. et al.Ubiquitinated TDP-43 in frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Science. 2006; 314: 130-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar), prior to that, we reported cloning of TDP-43 from a mouse testis complementary DNA (cDNA) library as a transcription factor binding to the promoter of the testis-specific Acrv1 gene (12Acharya K.K. Govind C.K. Shore A.N. Stoler M.H. Reddi P.P. Cis-requirement for the maintenance of round spermatid-specific transcription.Dev. Biol. 2006; 295: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The mouse Acrv1 gene is expressed exclusively in round spermatids, and its promoter contains two TGTGTG motifs—canonical TDP-43-binding sites to which TDP-43 binds in vitro. Using transgenic mice as a reporter system, we showed that mutation of the two TGTGTG motifs within the Acrv1 promoter caused premature transcription of a reporter gene in spermatocytes, whereas the WT promoter maintained round spermatid-specific expression in vivo (12Acharya K.K. Govind C.K. Shore A.N. Stoler M.H. Reddi P.P. Cis-requirement for the maintenance of round spermatid-specific transcription.Dev. Biol. 2006; 295: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This suggested that TDP-43 might repress the Acrv1 gene expression in spermatocytes in vivo. Using the Gal4 reporter assay, we showed that TDP-43 represses gene transcription (13Lalmansingh A.S. Urekar C.J. Reddi P.P. TDP-43 is a transcriptional repressor: The testis-specific mouse acrv1 gene is a TDP-43 target in vivo.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 10970-10982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, we also demonstrated a role for TDP-43 in the insulator function required to keep the Acrv1 gene silent in the somatic tissues (14Abhyankar M.M. Urekar C. Reddi P.P. A novel CpG-free vertebrate insulator silences the testis-specific SP-10 gene in somatic tissues: Role for TDP-43 in insulator function.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36143-36154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed occupancy of TDP-43 at the promoter of the Acrv1 gene, both in spermatocytes as well as round spermatids. Interestingly, chromatin immunoprecipitation also showed that RNA pol II and the pol II pause machinery were loaded on the Acrv1 promoter in spermatocytes prior to the expression of Acrv1 mRNA in round spermatids (13Lalmansingh A.S. Urekar C.J. Reddi P.P. TDP-43 is a transcriptional repressor: The testis-specific mouse acrv1 gene is a TDP-43 target in vivo.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 10970-10982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Taken together, our previous work showed that TDP-43 functions as a transcriptional repressor and that Acrv1 is a TDP-43 target gene in vivo. Although our studies mainly focused on its role as a transcriptional repressor of the Acrv1 gene thus far, we anticipate that TDP-43 plays a global role in the regulation of gene expression in the testis, both at the transcriptional as well as post-transcriptional level. Immunolocalization studies of the mouse testis showed that TDP-43 expression begins in the intermediate and type B spermatogonia, peaks in preleptotene (PL) spermatocytes, and remains high in pachytene spermatocytes (15Osuru H.P. Pramoonjago P. Abhyankar M.M. Swanson E. Roker L.A. Cathro H. Reddi P.P. Immunolocalization of TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) in mouse seminiferous epithelium.Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2017; 84: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The round spermatids express TDP-43, but the expression gradually tapers off in late-stage spermatids. In addition to germ cells, Sertoli cells also express TDP-43. The location of TDP-43 was nuclear in all the aforementioned cells (15Osuru H.P. Pramoonjago P. Abhyankar M.M. Swanson E. Roker L.A. Cathro H. Reddi P.P. Immunolocalization of TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) in mouse seminiferous epithelium.Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2017; 84: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The pattern of spatiotemporal expression of TDP-43 within the seminiferous epithelium (highest expression seen in PL and pachytene spermatocytes) indicates a functional role for the protein in male germ cell differentiation and sperm formation, particularly during meiosis. In support of this, TDP-43 was found to be aberrantly expressed in testicular germ cells and spermatozoa of some infertile men (16Varghese D.S. Chandran U. Soumya A. Pillai S.M. Jayakrishnan K. Reddi P.P. Kumar P.G. Aberrant expression of TAR DNA binding protein-43 is associated with spermatogenic disorders in men.Reprod. Fertil. Dev. 2016; 28: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). On the basis of the aforementioned data, we hypothesized that TDP-43 would be essential for spermatogenesis and male fertility. To test, we have generated conditional KO (cKO) mice lacking Tardbp in adult male germ cells. Our experimental results show that in the absence of TDP-43, spermatocytes were unable to complete prophase I of meiosis leading to maturation arrest. Male mice bearing germ cell KO of Tardbp produced fewer and morphologically abnormal sperm. Tardbp KO male mice were severely subfertile. Consistent with its role as a multifunctional protein, loss of TDP-43 resulted in global changes in the expression of genes in the testis: 1036 genes were upregulated and 1638 were downregulated. In order to investigate the functional requirement of TDP-43 for spermatogenesis in mice, we crossed floxed TDP-43 mice with stimulated by retinoic acid (RA) gene 8 (Stra8)–improved Cre (iCre) deleter mice to delete the TDP-43 gene in the spermatogonial stage of male germ cell differentiation. In floxed TDP-43 mice, exon 3 of Tardbp (gene symbol for TDP-43), which codes for two critical RNA recognition motifs, is flanked by the loxP (locus of X-over P1) sites. Previous studies using these mice showed that Cre-mediated excision leads to loss of TDP-43 protein in target tissues (10Chiang P.M. Ling J. Jeong Y.H. Price D.L. Aja S.M. Wong P.C. Deletion of TDP-43 down-regulates Tbc1d1, a gene linked to obesity, and alters body fat metabolism.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2010; 107: 16320-16324Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Stra8–iCre–mediated excision of floxed genes is specific for the male germ cells and begins by postnatal day 4 (PND4) within the undifferentiated spermatogonia of the testis (17Wu Q. Song R. Ortogero N. Zheng H. Evanoff R. Small C.L. Griswold M.D. Namekawa S.H. Royo H. Turner J.M. Yan W. The RNase III enzyme DROSHA is essential for microRNA production and spermatogenesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 25173-25190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 18Sadate-Ngatchou P.I. Payne C.J. Dearth A.T. Braun R.E. Cre recombinase activity specific to postnatal, premeiotic male germ cells in transgenic mice.Genesis. 2008; 46: 738-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). TDP-43 protein first appears in intermediate and type B spermatogonia ((15Osuru H.P. Pramoonjago P. Abhyankar M.M. Swanson E. Roker L.A. Cathro H. Reddi P.P. Immunolocalization of TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) in mouse seminiferous epithelium.Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2017; 84: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and Fig. S1). Thus, Stra8–iCre–mediated excision is expected to lead to loss of TDP-43 in intermediate spermatogonia and all subsequent male germ cell types. To assess the phenotypic effect, we analyzed male mice with the genotype TardbpFlox/null, Stra8–Cre+ (referred to as homozygous cKO). The heterozygous Tardbp Flox/wt Stra8–Cre+ mice served as control (het control). We first analyzed the testes of PND35 males, the time point at which the first wave of spermatogenesis will have completed. Testis size was severely reduced in cKO mice compared with control littermates (Fig. 1, inset). In cross section, the diameter of the seminiferous tubules appeared narrower compared with control (Fig. 1, A and B). Histological examination showed extensive germ cell depletion and the presence of vacuoles within the tubules. The control (heterozygous) testes showed germ cells at all stages of differentiation including spermatozoa at the luminal interface indicating proper completion of the first round of spermatogenesis (Fig. 1A). It must be noted here that there was no difference between the heterozygous and WT mice in terms of TDP-43 protein levels (Fig. S1B) or testis phenotype. The cKO testes, however, showed fewer differentiating cell types in the epithelium and the absence of spermatozoa (Fig. 1B). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using anti-TDP43 antibody to verify the status of TDP-43 expression. Control mice expressed TDP-43 in germ cells as well as Sertoli cells (Fig. 1C), whereas the cKO testis showed TDP-43 only in Sertoli cells (Fig. 1D), thus confirming KO of Tardbp within the spermatogonia and all subsequent germ cell types. At higher magnification, spermatogonia and a few meiotic cells could be seen in cKO testis but no round spermatids (Fig. 1D). Thus, absence of round spermatids at PND35 suggested failure to complete meiosis in Tardbp cKO mice. We then extended the analysis to older mice ranging from 2 to 21 months of age (n = 30). Overall, we observed a 2.9-fold decrease in testis weight (p < 0.0001) and 1.6-fold reduction in the diameter of the seminiferous tubule (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2, A and B). Testes of cKO mice at 3, 7, and 21 months of age showed progressively worse depletion of germ cells and vacuole formation within the seminiferous tubules (Fig. 2, C–H). At advanced ages, the seminiferous epithelium only consisted of Sertoli cells, reminiscent of the human infertility condition known as Sertoli cell–only syndrome (Fig. 2, G and H). IHC using antibody to the Sertoli marker Sox 9 confirmed that the cells remaining within the seminiferous epithelium of the cKO mice are in fact Sertoli cells (Fig. S2, A and B). We observed a variation in the penetrance of the phenotype in terms of germ cell loss in cKO mice (n = 30; data not shown). A majority of the cKO mice showed severe germ cell depletion with few spermatozoa, whereas some cKO males showed progression of spermatogenesis in a portion of seminiferous tubule cross sections. Consistent with this, the total number of caudal sperm varied averaging at 2.2 million per cKO mouse compared with 16 million per control mouse (Fig. 2I). We quantified the different types of germ cells in cKO mice testes by flow cytometry using testicular cells isolated from mice aged 3 to 4 months (Fig. 2J). Compared with WT controls, cKO mice testes showed a statistically significant decrease in 1 N cells (round spermatids) and an increase in 2 N (spermatogonia, Sertoli, peritubular, and Leydig cells) and 4 N (primary spermatocytes) cells. Accumulation of 2 N and 4 N cells in Tardbp cKO testes indicated arrest in meiosis, mimicking the meiotic arrest phenotype seen in biopsies obtained from some azoospermic infertile men. Majority of spermatozoa collected from cauda epididymides of Tardbp cKO mice were morphologically abnormal. Sperm with deformed or detached head accounted for roughly half of the population. Approximately 55% of the cKO sperm showed head and midpiece bent over the principal piece of the tail (Fig. S3, A–E). To address the requirement of TDP-43 for fertility in male mice, we conducted fertility trials. Three-month-old TardbpFlox/null Stra8–Cre+ males were cohabited with age-matched WT females. A total of four separate cKO males were used in the fertility trial. Breeding pairs of 3-month-old WT males (n = 5) and females served as controls. At the end of the 6-month fertility trial period, control mice gave birth to an average of 6 litters, whereas the cKO mice produced an average of 0.6 litters during the same period (Fig. 2K). Thus, TDP-43 deletion in male germ cells caused a significant reduction in male fertility in mice (p < 0.0001). Next, we wanted to systematically examine at what point spermatogenesis was halted because of the lack of TDP-43 in spermatogonia. Since TDP-43 expression was not detected in undifferentiated spermatogonia (15Osuru H.P. Pramoonjago P. Abhyankar M.M. Swanson E. Roker L.A. Cathro H. Reddi P.P. Immunolocalization of TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) in mouse seminiferous epithelium.Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2017; 84: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), we did not expect to see defects in early stage spermatogonia. TDP-43 expression, however, begins in the intermediate spermatogonia of WT mice. Therefore, depletion of TDP-43 could potentially affect the progression of type B spermatogonia to PL spermatocytes. To address this, we explored the expression of Stra8 as a marker of PL spermatocytes. IHC showed intact PL spermatocytes expressing Stra8 in cKO mice (Fig. S2, C and D). Stra8 expression in cKO mouse PL spermatocytes also indicated that the RA signaling pathway for entry into meiosis occurred normally up to that point. Prophase I of meiosis consists of five stages, including leptonema, zygonema, pachynema, diplonema, and diakinesis. We performed immunolabeling with TDP-43 and synaptonemal complex (SC) protein 3 (SYCP3) on WT mouse testis meiotic chromosome spreads to determine the dynamics of expression of TDP-43 during meiotic prophase I (Fig. 3, A–G). TDP-43 was not found until the midpachytene stage (Fig. 3C). This was consistent with earlier findings in which IHC showed lack of TDP-43 expression in leptotene and zygotene spermatocytes ((15Osuru H.P. Pramoonjago P. Abhyankar M.M. Swanson E. Roker L.A. Cathro H. Reddi P.P. Immunolocalization of TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) in mouse seminiferous epithelium.Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2017; 84: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and Fig. S1). TDP-43 expression started in midpachytene spermatocytes, peaked in late pachytene, and remained high until the diplotene spermatocyte stage, and nearly eliminated in diakinesis (Fig. 3, C–G). Next, we quantified TDP-43 expression during meiotic prophase I. TDP-43 fluorescent signal was normalized with that of the lateral element protein SYCP3 and plotted. In agreement with the immunofluorescence images, the highest expression of TDP-43 was seen from late pachytene to late diplotene stages (Fig. 3H), indicating that TDP-43 might play an important role in the meiotic processes occurring in pachytene and diplotene spermatocytes. Consistent with this, immunofluorescence of meiotic chromosome spreads from the cKO testis showed cells arrested mostly at midpachytene stage, whereas some progressed to later stages of prophase I (Fig. 3). SYCP3 staining showed various synapsis defects in the spermatocytes of cKO mice. Compared with the WT spermatocytes (Fig. 3I), diplotene-like spermatocytes from Tardbp cKO showed nonhomologous chromosome synapsis (arrowhead) (Fig. 3J). Zygotene-like spermatocytes from Tardbp cKO showed nonhomologous chromosome synapsis, short chromosome length, and abnormal number of chromosomes (n = 17 in K, n = 25 in L of Fig. 3). The abnormal numbers of chromosomes in cKO testes may have resulted from abnormal synapsis between nonhomologous chromosomes. Some pachytene-like spermatocytes showed abnormally long chromosomes (white arrow in Fig. 3M). The data indicated that loss of TDP-43 in male germ cells disrupted critical processes such as homologous chromosome pairing and recombination that occur at pachynema during prophase I of meiosis. Next, we compared the number of cells at various stages of prophase I in the WT versus cKO testis to determine the stage at which meiotic arrest occurred in cKO mice (Fig. 4A). Tardbp cKO mice showed accumulation of cells in zygotene, early pachytene, and mostly at midpachytene stages. Tardbp cKO mice showed a decline in the number of late pachytene and diplotene spermatocytes, indicating failure to advance to these stages in the absence of TDP-43. This suggested that TDP-43 is required for meiotic processes that occur during pachynema. To further characterize the meiotic defects, meiotic chromosome spreads were simultaneously stained with antibodies to γH2AX, SYCP3, and TDP-43 (Fig. 4, B–E). In WT pachytene spermatocytes, γH2AX staining is restricted to the sex-body regions (Fig. 4B, right panel). This is because the X and Y chromosomes pair at the pseudoautosomal region and the remaining unpaired X and Y chromosomal regions, which are transcriptionally silenced, are stained with γH2AX. In contrast, extensive and persistent γH2AX staining, pseudosex bodies, was seen over the autosomes in Tardbp cKO spermatocytes (Fig. 4, C–E, right panels). These pseudosex bodies are indicative of synapsis problems including nonhomologous chromosome pairing consistent with the abnormal numbers of chromosomes in meiotic spreads (Fig. 3, K and L). Furthermore, retention of γH2AX foci/flares on autosomes in cKO testis could also indicate a delay in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). IHC of testis cross sections further confirmed that the nuclei of cKO spermatocytes show extensive γ-H2AX staining (Fig. S4, A and B). Consistent with failure to complete meiosis, several spermatocytes are seen undergoing apoptosis as revealed by TUNEL staining (Fig. S4, C–E). We performed structure illumination microscopy microscopy to obtain higher resolution images of homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis in WT and cKO spermatocytes. SYCP3 is a marker for the meiotic chromosome axes. WT spermatocytes at pachynema showed two parallel SYCP3 lines indicating proper synapsis between homologous chromosomes (Fig. 5A). The inset in Figure 5A shows the end-to-end pairing of homologous chromosomes in WT mice. In contrast, Tardbp cKO spermatocytes showed synapsis partner exchange between nonhomologous chromosomes (Fig. 5B). Examples of defective synapsis patterns are shown in insets of Figure 5B. Partner exchange between five and four different nonhomologous chromosomes is depicted in the schematics accompanying the insets on the left and right sides of Figure 5B, respectively. This showed that loss of TDP-43 causes nonhomologous chromosome synapsis in pachytene spermatocytes. Collectively, these data suggest that TDP-43 is required for normal synapsis of chromosomes in mouse spermatocytes. Since TDP-43 is a transcription factor/RNA binding protein, we asked if the loss of TDP-43 altered the expression of candidate genes known to be involved in the initiation and progression of meiosis. Evaluation of the cKO testis in adult mice showed that over time there was pronounced atrophy of the seminiferous epithelium. Therefore, we reasoned that in order to observe direct effects of loss of TDP-43, it would be more appropriate to probe for differences in gene expression at the time of the initial onset of pathology in cKO testis. To determine the time point at which phenotypic changes have begun in the testis of the KO mice, we examined the histology of the testis at prepubertal ages. Histologically, there was no difference between the control and cKO testis at PND8 (Fig. 6, A and B). By PND12; however, there were noticeable changes in the cellularity of the seminiferous epithelium and the appearance of spermatocytes in the cKO testis (Fig. 6, C and D). The severity of pathology became progressively worse at PND15 (data not shown). The period between PND8 and PND12 coincides with the onset of prophase I of meiosis in the testis under the control of RA signaling. Based on a previous publication of RA pathway genes in the testis (19Gely-Pernot A. Raverdeau M. Teletin M. Vernet N. Féret B. Klopfenstein M. Dennefeld C. Davidson I. Benoit G. Mark M. Ghyselinck N.B. Retinoic acid receptors control spermatogonia cell-fate and induce expression of the SALL4A transcription factor.PLoS Genet. 2015; 11e1005501Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we analyzed the expression of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) beta, RAR gamma, retinoid X receptor (RXR) alpha, RXR beta, RXR gamma, retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4), Rdln11, cellular retinol-binding protein 1, cellular retinol-binding protein 2 (Crbp2), retinoic acid receptor responder 1, cytochrome P450 26A1, spalt-like transcription factor 4a (Sall4a), spalt-like transcription factor 4b (Sall4b), and signaling receptor and transporter of retinol STRA6 at PND12. Quantitative RT (qRT)–PCR showed that RBP4, Crbp2, RAR beta, and Sall4b showed significant differences (p < 0.05). RBP4, Crbp2, and RAR beta showed decreased gene expression in Tardbp cKO testes, whereas Sall4b showed a significantly high level of expression (Fig. 7A). This suggested that TDP-43 may functionally impact the execution of RA signaling for the initiation and maintenance of meiosis in spermatocytes. Next, to investigate the effect of TDP-43 on the expression of genes regulating prophase I of meiosis, we analyzed the expression of genes involved in DSB formation, synapsis, and recombination, including Mei1 (meiotic double-stranded break formation protein 1), Prdm9 (PR/SET domain 9), Spo11 (initiator of meiotic double-stranded breaks), Dmc1 (DNA meiotic recombinase 1), Rad21L (RAD21 cohesin complex component like 1), Rec8 (meiotic recombination protein REC8), Hormad1 (HORMA domain-containing protein 1), Hormad2 (HORMA domain-containing protein 2), Sycp1, (synaptonemal complex protein 1), Sycp2 (synaptonemal complex protein 2) Sycp3 (synaptonemal complex protein 3), and Msh4 (MutS homolog 4). All these (with the exception of Hormad1, Sycp2, and Sycp3) showed a statistically significant decrease in gene expression in PND12 cKO testes (Fig. 7B). Finally, qRT–PCR confirmed conditional deletion of the Tardbp gene and showed 2.3-fold reduction in the expression of Tardbp mRNA (p < 0.05) in the cKO testes compared with controls (Fig. 7B). The data suggest that loss of TDP-43 in testicular germ cells had an impact on the mRNA expression of candidate genes critical for prophase I of meiosis.Figure 7Dysregulation of gene expression in Tardbp cKO testis.

Previously, we demonstrated that the GH11 xylanase XynLC9 from Bacillus subtilis formed xylobiose and xylotriose as the major products with negligible production of xylose when digesting corncob-extracted xylan. Here, we aimed to improve the catalytic performance of XynLC9 via protein engineering. Based on the sequence and structural comparisons of XynLC9 with the xylanases Xyn2 from Trichoderma reesei and Xyn11A from Thermobifida fusca, we identified the N-terminal residues 5-YWQN-8 in XynLC9 as engineering hotspots and subjected this sequence to site saturation and iterative mutagenesis. The mutants W6F/Q7H and N8Y possessed a 2.6- and 1.8-fold higher catalytic activity than XynLC9, respectively, and both mutants were also more thermostable. Kinetic measurements suggested that W6F/Q7H and N8Y had lower substrate affinity, but a higher turnover rate (kcat), which resulted in increased catalytic efficiency than WT XynLC9. Furthermore, the W6F/Q7H mutant displayed a 160% increase in the yield of xylooligosaccharides from corncob-extracted xylan. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the W6F/Q7H and N8Y mutations led to an enlarged volume and surface area of the active site cleft, which provided more space for substrate entry and product release and thus accelerated the catalytic activity of the enzyme. The molecular evolution approach adopted in this study provides the design of a library of sequences that captures functional diversity in a limited number of protein variants.

Furthermore, the W6F/Q7H mutant displayed a 160% increase in the yield of xylooligosaccharides from corncob-extracted xylan. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the W6F/Q7H and N8Y mutations led to an enlarged volume and surface area of the active site cleft, which provided more space for substrate entry and product release and thus accelerated the catalytic activity of the enzyme. The molecular evolution approach adopted in this study provides the design of a library of sequences that captures functional diversity in a limited number of protein variants. Endo-β-1,4-xylanase (EC. 3.2.1.8) randomly cleaves the β-D-xylopyranose bond between two D-xylopyranosyl residues linked by β-(1,4) bond and is a crucial enzyme in xylan degradation (1Nakamichi Y. Fouquet T. Ito S. Watanabe M. Matsushika A. Inoue H. Structural and functional characterization of a bifunctional GH30-7 xylanase B from the filamentous fungus Talaromyces cellulolyticus.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 4065-4078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To date, xylanases have been successfully used in a wide range of industrial applications, including pulp bleaching, animal feed manufacture, food preparation, and biofuel production (2Juturu V. Wu J.C. Microbial xylanases: Engineering, production and industrial applications.Biotechnol. Adv. 2012; 30: 1219-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Accordingly, a crucial application of xylanases, supported by their high specificity and limited impact on the environment, is in the production of emerging prebiotics xylooligosaccharides (XOS) from various agro-industrial wastes (3Karlsson E.N. Schmitz E. Linares-Pasten J.A. Adlercreutz P. Endo-xylanases as tools for production of substituted xylooligosaccharides with probiotic properties.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2018; 102: 9081-9088Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Among the nondigestible oligosaccharides, XOS exhibit higher resistance to acidic pH and heat and a better ability to stimulate the growth of Bifidobacterium. In addition, XOS have also been shown to improve calcium absorption, bowel function, and lipid metabolism and were also reported to offer protection against cardiovascular disease and reduce the risk to develop colon cancer (4Amorim C. Silverio S.C. Prather K.L.J. Rodrigues L.R. From lignocellulosic residues to market: Production and commercial potential of xylooligosaccharides.Biotechnol. Adv. 2019; 37: 107397Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, the major current limitations for the wide applications of XOS are high production costs and low yields (4Amorim C. Silverio S.C. Prather K.L.J. Rodrigues L.R. From lignocellulosic residues to market: Production and commercial potential of xylooligosaccharides.Biotechnol. Adv. 2019; 37: 107397Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 5Li Q. Sun B.G. Xiong K. Teng C. Xu Y.Q. Li L.J. Li X.T. Improving special hydrolysis characterization into Talaromyces thermophilus F1208 xylanase by engineering of N-terminal extension and site-directed mutagenesis in C-terminal.Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 2017; 96: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Numerous xylanases from bacteria, fungi, and yeasts have been isolated, purified, and characterized to date (6Alokika Singh B. Production, characteristics, and biotechnological applications of microbial xylanases.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2019; 103: 8763-8784Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Based on the sequence homologies and hydrophobic cluster analyses, most of the xylanases belong to glycoside hydrolase (GH) families 10 and 11, while a smaller number belongs to families 5, 8, and 30. GH10 xylanases typically have a high molecular mass and feature a (β/α)8-barrel fold, while GH11 xylanases display a conserved β-jelly roll fold (7Paes G. Berrin J.G. Beaugrand J. GH11 xylanases: Structure/function/properties relationships and applications.Biotechnol. Adv. 2012; 30: 564-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In contrast to their counterparts from the GH10 family, GH11 xylanases are regarded as “true xylanases” and are attractive because of their small size, strict substrate specificity, and a range of optimal pH values and temperatures (7Paes G. Berrin J.G. Beaugrand J. GH11 xylanases: Structure/function/properties relationships and applications.Biotechnol. Adv. 2012; 30: 564-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 8Cheng Y.S.

Chem. 2014; 289: 11020-11028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although numerous GH11 xylanases have been mined and characterized with a view to meet various industrial demands, most of these naturally occurring GH11 xylanases are unsuitable for industrial applications because of their poor specific activities and biochemical properties (9Xu X. Liu M.Q. Huo W.K. Dai X.J. Obtaining a mutant of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens xylanase A with improved catalytic activity by directed evolution.Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2016; 86: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 10Teng C. Jiang Y.F. Xu Y.Q. Li Q. Li X.T. Fan G.S. Xiong K. Yang R. Zhang C.N. Ma R. Zhu Y.P. Li J.L. Wang C.T. Improving the thermostability and catalytic efficiency of GH11 xylanase PjxA by adding disulfide bridges.Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 2019; 128: 354-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Therefore, the engineering of GH11 xylanases by directed evolution and rational design is gaining increasing attention. Rational design via site-directed mutagenesis or peptide segment substitution has already been successfully used to enhance the catalytic activity of several GH11 xylanases. For instance, a study using virtual mutations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the GH11 xylanase AnXynB from Aspergillus niger indicated that the amino acid residues at the −3 subsite played a crucial role in substrate binding, and specific mutations in this site (in particular, the S41N/T43E double mutant) increased the catalytic activity by 1.7-fold (11Wu X.Y. Tian Z.N. Jiang X.K. Zhang Q. Wang L.S. Enhancement in catalytic activity of Aspergillus niger XynB by selective site-directed mutagenesis of active site amino acids.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2018; 102: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A similar study showed that the double mutant W125F/F163W of XynCDBFV from Neocallimastix patriciarum had a 20% increase in the catalytic activity compared with the WT enzyme (12Cheng Y.S. Chen C.C. Huang J.W. Ko T.P. Huang Z.Y. Guo R.T. Improving the catalytic performance of a GH11 xylanase by rational protein engineering.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2015; 99: 9503-9510Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although some impressive results have been achieved, learning how to construct a “small but smart” library to develop better xylanases for XOS production by utilizing the natural diversity of xylanase sequences and structures has remained challenging. XOS with a low degree of polymerization, such as xylobiose (X2) and xylotriose (X3), present a higher prebiotic activity, while xylose (X1) itself is an undesirable component that needs to be removed (4Amorim C. Silverio S.C. Prather K.L.J. Rodrigues L.R. From lignocellulosic residues to market: Production and commercial potential of xylooligosaccharides.Biotechnol. Adv. 2019; 37: 107397Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Therefore, xylanases that are able to produce high levels of XOS with a low degree of polymerization, while minimizing the occurrence of xylose, have great application value (13Li Q. Sun B.G. Jia H.Y. Hou J. Yang R. Xiong K. Xu Y.Q. Li X.T. Engineering a xylanase from Streptomyce rochi L10904 by mutation to improve its catalytic characteristics.Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 2017; 101: 366-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Currently, commercially useful xylanases are mainly obtained from Bacillus species. Thus, enhancing the catalytic efficiency of a xylanase from Bacillus species is undoubtedly of great significance to the biotechnology sector as this will decrease enzyme costs and broaden its scope of application. In a previous study, we cloned and expressed the GH11 xylanase XynLC9 from Bacillus subtilis. The recombinant enzyme exhibited effective alkaline pH tolerance and specific hydrolysis characteristics, which mainly liberated X2 and X3 from corncob-extracted xylan, but only negligible amounts of X1 (14Chang S.Y. Guo Y.L. Wu B. He B.F. Extracellular expression of alkali tolerant xylanase from Bacillus subtilis Lucky9 in E. coli and application for xylooligosaccharides production from agro-industrial waste.Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 2017; 96: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Accordingly, XynLC9 is an attractive candidate for commercial utilization and thus appropriate as a starting point for further exploration and development. In the present study, we aimed to improve the catalytic performance of XynLC9. Our strategy was guided by a detailed structural comparison between XynLC9 and two well-known GH11 xylanases, xyn2 from Trichoderma reesei and Xyn11A from Thermobifida fusca, both of which had higher catalytic activity than XynLC9. Residues 5-YWQN-8 in XynLC9 were then selected as focal points for protein engineering using saturation and iterative mutagenesis. Experimental work was accompanied by MD simulations to rationalize the observed improvements of the activity among the engineered mutants of XynLC9. The present findings significantly advance the understanding of structure–function relationships in GH11 xylanases, which may thus also be applicable for the rational design of other GH11 xylanases. Protein structure alignments provide an excellent tool to identify amino acid side chains and/or structural regions and patches that play an instrumental role in the function and mechanism of enzymes (11Wu X.Y. Tian Z.N. Jiang X.K. Zhang Q. Wang L.S. Enhancement in catalytic activity of Aspergillus niger XynB by selective site-directed mutagenesis of active site amino acids.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2018; 102: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We first established the model structure of XynLC9 using B. subtilis 168 xylanase BsXynA (1XXN) as the template. As shown in Fig. S1, XynLC9 displayed an overall β-jelly roll structure typical of GH11 xylanases, resembling the shape of a partially closed right hand and comprised two twisted β-sheets (named A and B) and a single α-helix. The β-sheet A was composed of five antiparallel β-strands (A2–A6), and β-sheet B contained eight β-strands (B2-B9). Both β-strands A and B constituted the “fingers”, and a twisted pair of β-strands B together with α-helix formed the “palm.” The large cleft between the “finger” and the “palm” domains was regarded as the active site, with two catalytic glutamate residues (Glu78 and Glu172) residing on B6 and B4. A loop between β-strands B7 and B8 created the “thumb” domain, which was critical for controlling substrate access to the active site, while another loop between the B6 and B9 strands formed a “cord” that connected the “fingers” with the base of the “thumb” (15Silva S.B. Pinheiro M.P. Fuzo C.A. Silva S.R. Ferreira T.L. Lourenzoni M.R. Nonato M.C. Vieira D.S. Ward R.J. The role of local residue environmental changes in thermostable mutants of the GH11 xylanase from Bacillus subtilis.Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 2017; 97: 574-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The structural model of XynLC9 was used to identify functionally relevant residues and regions by comparing it with the structures of related GH11 xylanases that had superior catalytic activity and whose primary reaction products were X2 and/or X3. Suitable candidates are xyn2 from T. reesei and Xyn11A from T. fusca with specific activity of 1080 U/mg and 960 U/mg (16Ayadi D.Z. Sayari A.H. Hlima H.B. Mabrouk S.B. Mezghani M. Bejar S.

Biochem. Biotechnol. 2015; 175: 1318-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), respectively, which is approximately 1.8- and 1.6-fold higher than that of XynLC9. Furthermore, the main products formed by xyn2 and Xyn11A were X3 and X2, respectively (16Ayadi D.Z. Sayari A.H. Hlima H.B. Mabrouk S.B. Mezghani M. Bejar S. Improvement of Trichoderma reesei xylanase Ⅱ thermal stability by serine to threonine surface mutations.Int. J. Biol.

Structural considerations on the use of endo-xylanases for the production of prebiotic xylooligosaccharides from biomass.Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2018; 19: 48-67PubMed Google Scholar). A multiple sequence alignment illustrated that XynLC9 shared 47% and 62% sequence identity with xyn2 and Xyn11A, respectively (Fig. 1A). Structural superimposition revealed that XynLC9 shared similar structure to xyn2 and Xyn11A with RMSD values of 1.86 Å and 2.09 Å, respectively, demonstrating that structures were better conserved than sequences. Moreover, three xylanase–xylohexaose complexes were aligned to assess the structural conservation of the active site regions. In contrast to xylanases xyn2 and Xyn11A, XynLC9 lacked the N-terminal β-strand B1 region; thus, XynLC9 only possessed five subsites that were categorized as +1, +2, and +3, toward the reducing (aglycone) end, and −1 and −2, toward the nonreducing (glycone) end, where subsite −3 was missing. Moreover, our results indicated that the structures of three enzymes in the active site were more conserved because the superimposition of three specific regions provided RMSD values of 1.34 Å and 0.43 Å, respectively. The significant active site variation between XynLC9 and the other two xylanases was mainly focused on the edge of glycone subsites (Fig. 1B) that harbored four consecutive amino acid residues 5-YWQN-8 in XynLC9 (FYSY in xyn2 and FYSF in Xyn11A). Consequently, we engineered XynLC9 with 5-YWQN-8 residues as the mutation targets. In this study, a semirational approach was used to engineer the entrance region of the active site of XynLC9. One pair of spatially adjacent residues, Tyr5 and Gln7, was mutated by iterative saturation mutagenesis to capture possible synergistic conformational effects, while the other two residues (Trp6 and Asn8) were subjected to single-site saturation mutagenesis (Fig. 2A). Considering both screening effort and library coverage, NDT codon degeneracy was applied for the construction of Tyr5-Gln7 iterative saturation mutagenesis (19Yin X.J. Liu Y.Y. Meng L.J. Zhou H.S. Wu J.P. Yang L.R. Semi-rational hinge engineering: Modulating the conformational transformation of glutamate dehydrogenase for enhanced reductive amination activity towards non-natural substrates.Catal. Sci. Technol. 2020; 10: 3376-3386Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, three focused libraries were constructed: library A (W6X), library B (N8X), and library C (Y5X/Q7X). After the initial screening of the mutant libraries, only the mutant W6F in library exhibited marginal improvement in the specific activity (nearly 10% increase). In library B, the N8Y mutant displayed the highest specific activity (1087 U/mg), which was about 1.8-fold higher than that of WT XynLC9. The most efficient mutant in library C was Y5/Q7H, with about 20% increase in activity when compared with WT XynLC9 (Fig. 2B). Moreover, each of the three libraries contained one positive mutant, indicating that the catalytic activity of XynLC9 was vulnerable to the mutations in the N-terminal region near the active site. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to probe if these mutations might have synergetic effects. We generated three double mutants (W6F/Q7H, W6F/N8Y, and Q7H/N8Y) and one triple mutant (W6F/Q7H/N8Y) (Fig. S2), followed by the assay of enzyme activity. While each of these mutants was more active than WT XynLC9, the double mutant W6F/Q7H displayed the most significant enhancement of the specific activity (260%, Fig. 2B). Thus, the single mutant N8Y and double mutant W6F/Q7H were selected for subsequent analyses. The enzymatic properties of mutants N8Y and W6F/Q7H were investigated using beechwood xylan as the substrate. As shown in Figure 3A, XynLC9 and its N8Y and W6F/Q7H mutants exhibited maximal xylanase activity at pH 7.0. Also, the three enzymes had similar pH stability, retaining more than 60% of their initial activities when incubated over 12 h at pH values ranging from 6 to 9 (Fig. 3B). Mutants N/8Y and W6F/Q7H had an optimum temperature of 60 °C (Fig. 3C), which was identical to WT XynLC9. However, two mutants showed improved thermostability, with the N8Y and W6F/Q7H mutants retaining 51.3% and 62.2% of the original activity after incubation at 50 °C for 4 h, while XynLC9 only maintained about 35.5% activity (Fig. 3D). Hence, as a result of their increased specific activity and thermostability, the two mutants of XynLC9 are promising candidates for industrial applications. Hydrolysis products of XOS and beechwood xylan by XynLC9 and two variants were analyzed using the TLC method. As shown in Figure 4, none of the enzymes were active toward X2 and X3 but showed a similar product range when X4 and X5 were used as substrates. When using X4 as a substrate, XynLC9 and its mutants, N8Y and W6F/Q7H, displayed similar distribution with X3 as the major products. During the hydrolysis of X5, the primary products were X2 and X3, while smaller quantities of X4 and trace amounts of undigested X5 were also present in the reaction mixture. The same analysis was also performed using beechwood xylan as a substrate. Again, for each of the three enzymes, X2 and X3 were the primary products formed (Fig. 4), while the amounts of X4 and X5 in the mixture were minimal. The apparent kinetic parameters of XynLC9 and its mutants were determined by using beechwood xylan as the substrate (Table 1). The apparent Km values for N8Y and W6F/Q7H were higher than that for XynLC9, indicating the reduced substrate affinity (20Wang X.Y. Huang H.Q. Xie X.M. Ma R. Bai Y.G. Zheng F. You S. Zhang B.Y. Xie H.F. Luo H.Y. Improvement of the catalytic performance of a hyperthermostable GH10 xylanase from Talaromyces leycettanus JCM12802.Bioresour. Technol. 2016; 222: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the turnover rate (kcat) of two mutants was significantly higher than that of XynLC9, indicating that the mutants performed better than the WT to convert most of the bound substrate into product (21Yang J.K. Ma T.F. Shang-guan F. Han Z.G. Improving the catalytic activity of thermostable xylanase from Thermotoga maritima via mutagenesis of non-catalytic residues at glycone subsites.Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2020; 139: 109579Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Owing to the considerable improvement in kcat values, N8Y and W6F/Q7H displayed about 22% and 47% higher catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km), respectively, than the WT, which is consistent with the enzyme activity results described above.Table 1Kinetic values of XynLC9 and its mutants toward beechwood xylanEnzymeKm (mg/ml)kcat (/s)kcat/Km (ml/mg/s)XynLC97.2 ± 0.655.9 ± 4.87.8 ± 0.7N8Y11.2 ± 0.9105.7 ± 11.29.5 ± 0.8W6F/Q7H11.6 ± 0.9133.1 ± 11.711.4 ± 0.9The error bar represents the SDs from three replicates. Open table in a new tab The error bar represents the SDs from three replicates. Structural comparisons and MD simulations were performed for WT XynLC9 and the N8Y and W6F/Q7H mutants to explore the possible molecular basis that has led to the improved catalytic efficiency of the mutants. CD spectroscopy demonstrated that the mutations in positions 6 to 8 had no measurable effect on the secondary structural elements of XynLC9 (Fig. S3). Next, MD simulations were performed over a 50-nm time scale for WT XynLC9 and two mutants. The RMSD of the α-carbon atoms of the three enzymes in the presence of the substrate reached equilibrium after 40 ns, and thus, only the MD trajectories of the last 10 ns were selected for further analysis (Fig. 5A). The RMSD values were slightly higher for two mutants than for WT XynLC9, suggesting that the structural ensemble generated by MD simulations differed more from the initial structure in the case of mutants N8Y and W6F/Q7H than WT XynLC9 (22Vieira D.S. Ward R.J. Conformation analysis of a surface loop that controls active site access in the GH11 xylanase A from Bacillus subtilis.J. Mol. Model. 2012; 18: 1473-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) reflects the flexibility of each residue during the simulations. The analysis of RMSF values per residue did not show any significant changes at positions 5 to 8 between XynLC9 and two mutants (Fig. 5B). However, a slight increase in RMSF values was observed for the N8Y mutant over positions 10 to 12, indicating that the neighboring residues were more flexible with Tyr at position 8 than Asn at the same position (15Silva S.B. Pinheiro M.P. Fuzo C.A. Silva S.R. Ferreira T.L. Lourenzoni M.R. Nonato M.C. Vieira D.S. Ward R.J. The role of local residue environmental changes in thermostable mutants of the GH11 xylanase from Bacillus subtilis.Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 2017; 97: 574-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, this situation was reversed for the double mutant W6F/Q7H, with RMSF values smaller than that of XynLC9 in the region of residues 10 to 15. These results indicated that the mutations of N8Y and W6F/Q7H altered the local backbone structure flexibility of the enzyme, thus affecting the interactions between the enzyme and substrate. To further probe the structural changes caused by mutations at positions 6 to 8, a superimposition of the structures of WT XynLC9 and the two mutants was performed using the average structures extracted from the final 10 ns of the equilibrated state of the MD simulations as references for the final functional forms of the proteins. In native XynLC9, residues 6 to 8 were located on the active site cleft and in β-strand B2 of the N-terminal region. The Asn to Tyr substitution at residue 8 involved a neutral charge amino acid exchange to a bulky aromatic amino acid, which facilitated the formation of a new hydrogen bond between Tyr8 and Val16. In addition, there was a hydrophobic stacking interaction between this tyrosine and Trp6 (Fig. 6). On the other hand, Trp6 of WT XynLC9 interacted with Asn8, Ala18, and Asn20 (Fig. 6). Replacement of Trp6 by phenylalanine with a relatively smaller side group eliminated these interactions (Fig. 6). Gln7 was oriented toward the active site cleft near the catalytic site. The major hydrogen bond interactions in β-strand B2 of His7 in the double mutant W6F/Q7H and the equivalent residue (Gln7) in WT XynLC9 were conserved. These included two intramolecular hydrogen bonds between the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of position 7 and the main-chain amide nitrogen of Gly39 and between the side chain of the residue (His or Gln) and the side chain –OH group of Tyr5 (Fig. 6). We also analyzed the interactions between residues 6 to 8 of XynLC9 or its mutants and the substrate xylohexaose using the DS 3.5 software. The XynLC9–xylohexaose complex structure revealed that Trp6 and Asn8 might not interact directly with xylohexaose because they were distal to the substrate, while Gln7 provided two hydrogen bonds with O3 at the −2 subsite (Fig. 7). The introduction of an aromatic side chain in the N8Y mutant did not lead to the formation of CH-π stacking interactions with the substrate, but this mutation altered the conformation of Gln7 significantly, leading to the removal of one of the two hydrogen bonds between this glutamine and the −2 xylose moiety of the substrate (Fig. 7). For the W6F/Q7H double mutant, His7 only provided one hydrogen bond to the O2 of xylose residue in the −2 subsite (Fig. 7). These results indicated that mutations caused impaired binding ability to the ligand when compared with WT XynLC9. Using the entire simulation trajectories, we calculated the surface area/volume of the active site cavity of WT XynLC9, N8Y, and W6F/Q7H to be 607 Å2/879 Å3, 705 Å2/1004 Å3, and 730 Å2/1032 Å3, respectively (Fig. S4 and Table 2). The introduction of the mutations led to both a greater surface area and volume, with the double mutant having the most significant effect. The larger volume and area of the active site might be conducive to the substrate entrance and product dissociation, thereby improving the catalytic activity of two mutants.Table 2Geometrical and topological properties of the active site of XynLC9 and its mutantsEnzymeVolume (Å3)Area (Å2)Minimal distance (Trp9–Pro116) (Å)XynLC9607 ± 15879 ± 4310.3 ± 0.5N8Y705 ± 181004 ± 4111.9 ± 0.8W6F/Q7H730 ± 121032 ± 3712.1 ± 0.5The error bar represents the SDs from three replicates.

To assess the potential of the engineered xylanase for XOS production, the double mutant W6F/Q7H with highest catalytic activity was selected to hydrolyze corncob-extracted xylan. As shown in Figure 8, XOS production increased over time irrespective of whether corncob xylan was incubated with WT XynLC9 or mutant W6F/Q7H. However, at every time point, W6F/Q7H exhibited performance superior to that of WT XynLC9. After 14 h of incubation with the double mutant, the concentration of XOS reached 10.6 mg/ml, which was about 1.6-fold higher yield than that of WT XynLC9. The results above indicated that the substitutions at positions 6 and 7 with Phe and His promoted the production capacity of XOS from corncob, which was consistent with the previously determined catalytic efficiency. Enhanced catalytic activity is one of the most desirable properties related to the xylanase engineering perspective (11Wu X.Y. Tian Z.N. Jiang X.K. Zhang Q. Wang L.S.

Methods The clinical charts of 233 patients with CRPC treated with enzalutamide were reviewed retrospectively. After 1:3 propensity score matching (PSM), 124 patients were divided into a reduced dose group and a standard dose group, and the prostate specific antigen (PSA) response and the incidence of AEs were compared. Results 190 patients with CRPC initiated with standard dose enzalutamide were younger and better performance status compared with 43 patients beginning with reduced dose. After PSM, the baseline characteristics were not different between the standard and the reduced dose group. In the PSM cohort, the PSA response rate was significantly lower in the reduced dose group than in the standard dose group (-66.3% and -87.4%, p = 0.02). The incidence rates of AEs were not statistically different between the groups (22.6% and 34.4%, respectively, p = 0.24). Conclusion Initiating treatment with a reduced dose of enzalutamide did not significantly decrease the incidence rate of AEs, and it showed poorer PSA response rate. There is no clear rationale for treating with a reduced initial dose of enzalutamide to reduce the incidence of AEs."
https://openalex.org/W3203391357,"Understanding and predicting the response of marine communities to climate change at large spatial scales, and distilling this information for policymakers, are prerequisites for ecosystem-based management. Changes in thermal habitat suitability across species’ distributions are especially concerning because of their implications for abundance, affecting species’ conservation, trophic interactions and fisheries. However, most predictive studies of the effects of climate change have tended to be sub-global in scale and focused on shifts in species’ range edges or commercially exploited species. Here, we develop a widely applicable methodology based on climate response curves to predict global-scale changes in thermal habitat suitability. We apply the approach across the distributions of 2,293 shallow-water fish species under Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5 by 2050–2100. We find a clear pattern of predicted declines in thermal habitat suitability in the tropics versus general increases at higher latitudes. The Indo-Pacific, the Caribbean and western Africa emerge as the areas of most concern, where high species richness and the strongest declines in thermal habitat suitability coincide. This reflects a pattern of consistently narrow thermal ranges, with most species in these regions already exposed to temperatures above inferred thermal optima. In contrast, in temperate regions, such as northern Europe, where most species live below thermal optima and thermal ranges are wider, positive changes in thermal habitat suitability suggest that these areas are likely to emerge as the greatest beneficiaries of climate change, despite strong predicted temperature increases."
https://openalex.org/W3203489215,"Objectives The aim of this paper was to provide evidence for the impact of prenatal sex steroid exposure on prenatal and postnatal body size parameters, and muscle strength in children. Methods The following anthropometric data were studied in a group of 1148 children (536 boys and 612 girls) aged 6–13 years: the 2D:4D digit ratio, birth weight and length, and birth head and chest circumference. Postnatal parameters (6–13 years) included body weight and height, BMI, waist and hip circumference, WHR, as well as grip strength in both hands. All parameters that required it were adjusted for sex and gestational or chronological age. A general linear model, Pearson’s correlation, t -statistics and Cohen’s Δ were used in statistical analysis. Results Among birth size parameters, only birth weight was significantly negatively correlated with the 2D:4D digit ratio in children. Higher (feminized) digit ratios were significantly correlated with postnatal parameters such as body weight, BMI, and waist and hip circumference (positively), as well as hand grip strength–a proxy for muscular strength (negatively). Conclusion Problems with maintaining adequate body size parameters and muscle strength may be programmed in fetal life and predicted on the basis of the 2D:4D digit ratio. Body weight at birth and in early ontogenesis are additive correlates of the 2D:4D ratio. The present findings suggest that the 2D:4D digit ratio is related to postnatal phenotypes such as birth weight, overweight, and obesity as well as muscle strength in 6–13-year-old children of both sexes."

This highly conserved pathway mediates essential cellular membrane fission events, which restricts the acquisition of adaptive mutations to counteract viral co-option. Here, we describe duplicated and truncated copies of the ESCRT-III factor CHMP3 that block ESCRT-dependent virus budding and arose independently in New World monkeys and mice. When expressed in human cells, these retroCHMP3 proteins potently inhibit release of retroviruses, paramyxoviruses, and filoviruses. Remarkably, retroCHMP3 proteins have evolved to reduce interactions with other ESCRT-III factors and have little effect on cellular ESCRT processes, revealing routes for decoupling cellular ESCRT functions from viral exploitation. The repurposing of duplicated ESCRT-III proteins thus provides a mechanism to generate broad-spectrum viral budding inhibitors without blocking highly conserved essential cellular ESCRT functions.

https://openalex.org/W3204791020,"MicroRNAs are key regulators of the cardiac response to injury. MiR-100 has recently been suggested to be involved in different forms of heart failure, but functional studies are lacking. In the present study, we examined the impact of transgenic miR-100 overexpression on cardiac structure and function during physiological aging and pathological pressure-overload-induced heart failure in mice after transverse aortic constriction surgery. MiR-100 was moderately upregulated after induction of pressure overload in mice. While in our transgenic model the cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of miR-100 did not result in an obvious cardiac phenotype in unchallenged mice, the transgenic mouse strain exhibited less left ventricular dilatation and a higher ejection fraction than wildtype animals, demonstrating an attenuation of maladaptive cardiac remodeling by miR-100. Cardiac transcriptome analysis identified a repression of several regulatory genes related to cardiac metabolism, lipid peroxidation, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by miR-100 overexpression, possibly mediating the observed functional effects. While the modulation of ROS-production seemed to be indirectly affected by miR-100 via Alox5-and Nox4-downregulation, we demonstrated that miR-100 induced a direct repression of the scavenger protein CD36 in murine hearts resulting in a decreased uptake of long-chain fatty acids and an alteration of mitochondrial respiratory function with an enhanced glycolytic state. In summary, we identified miR-100 as a modulator of cardiac metabolism and ROS production without an apparent cardiac phenotype at baseline but a protective effect under conditions of pressure-overload-induced cardiac stress, providing new insight into the mechanisms of heart failure."

Several biogenic amines, when excreted, stimulate trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs), a group of GPCRs in the main olfactory epithelium, and elicit innate behaviors. How TAARs recognize amines with varying numbers of amino groups is largely unknown. We reasoned that a comparison between lamprey and mammalian olfactory TAARs, which are thought to have evolved independently but show convergent responses to polyamines, may reveal structural determinants of amine recognition. Here, we demonstrate that sea lamprey TAAR365 (sTAAR365) responds strongly to biogenic polyamines cadaverine, putrescine, and spermine, and shares a similar response profile as a mammalian TAAR (mTAAR9). Docking and site-directed mutagenesis analyses show that both sTAAR365 and mTAAR9 recognize the two amino groups of cadaverine with the conserved Asp3.32 and Tyr6.51 residues. sTAAR365, which has remarkable sensitivity for cadaverine (EC50 = 4 nM), uses an extra residue, Thr7.42, to stabilize ligand binding. These cadaverine recognition sites also interact with amines with four and three amino groups (spermine and spermidine, respectively). Glu7.36 of sTAAR365 cooperates with Asp3.32 and Thr7.42 to recognize spermine, whereas mTAAR9 recognizes spermidine through an additional aromatic residue, Tyr7.43. These results suggest a conserved mechanism whereby independently evolved TAAR receptors recognize amines with two, three, or four amino groups using the same recognition sites, at which sTAAR365 and mTAAR9 evolved distinct motifs.

Biogenic amines are a group of signaling molecules that activate G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and regulate a wide variety of neurophysiologic and behavioral functions. Recognition of amine neurotransmitters, which are often monoamines that activate the aminergic family of GPCRs in vertebrate central nervous systems, has been examined extensively (1Kandel E.R.

To date, the structural basis of a TAAR receptor recognizes amines with one or two amino groups having been examined (11Sharma K. Ahuja G. Hussain A. Balfanz S. Baumann A. Korsching S.I.

Cadaverine and putrescine, the foul-smelling diamines produced by microbial metabolism of putrefied animal tissue, repel zebrafish by activating an olfactory TAAR receptor (zTAAR13c) (9Hussain A.

Similarly, cadaverine activates an olfactory TAAR receptor in mouse (mTAAR9) and elicits either neutral or aversive behavioral responses, depending on the particular behavioral paradigm (16Saraiva L.R. Kondoh K. Ye X. Yoon K.H. Hernandez M. Buck L.B. Combinatorial effects of odorants on mouse behavior.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast, putrescine is attractive to mice, although the cognate receptor or receptors have not been identified (16Saraiva L.R. Kondoh K. Ye X. Yoon K.H. Hernandez M. Buck L.B.

Also, both cadaverine and putrescine can elicit feeding behaviors in rat and goldfish (18Heale V.R. Petersen K. Vanderwolf C.H.

In addition, spermine, an abundant polyamine in the semen of male sea lamprey, acts as a male sex pheromone that specifically attracts ovulated females (5Scott A.M. Zhang Z. Jia L. Li K. Zhang Q. Dexheimer T. Ellsworth E. Ren J. Chung-Davidson Y.W. Zu Y. Neubig R.R. Li W. Spermine in semen of male sea lamprey acts as a sex pheromone.PLoS Biol. 2019; 17e3000332Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A sea lamprey TAAR receptor, sTAAR348, is proposed to play a key role in mediating the pheromone function of spermine (5Scott A.M. Zhang Z. Jia L. Li K. Zhang Q. Dexheimer T. Ellsworth E. Ren J. Chung-Davidson Y.W. Zu Y. Neubig R.R. Li W. Spermine in semen of male sea lamprey acts as a sex pheromone.PLoS Biol. 2019; 17e3000332Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Likewise, spermine and spermidine (a biosynthetic precursor of spermine) activate mTAAR9 and elicit neutral or attractive behavioral preferences, respectively (16Saraiva L.R. Kondoh K. Ye X.

However, the mechanisms for TAARs in recognizing polyamines have not been fully determined. We argue that vertebrate TAARs have retained a conserved mechanism for polyamine recognition, even though the behavioral responses to the polyamines are species-specific and context-dependent. Olfactory TAAR gene families are present in all vertebrate species (20Eyun S.I. Moriyama H. Hoffmann F.G. Moriyama E.N.

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that TAARs of sea lamprey (a jawless vertebrate) cluster into an independent clade that is distantly related to the TAAR clade of jawed animals (20Eyun S.I. Moriyama H.

In Methods Mol Biol. Academic Press, Cambridge, MA2018: 21-31Google Scholar). Given that sea lamprey and mouse TAARs both detect the same group of polyamines, this provides an excellent opportunity to study the functional convergence of two independently evolved TAAR subfamilies. Many olfactory TAARs retain amine recognition motifs that are conserved in classical aminergic receptors, including an aspartate residue in transmembrane helix III (Asp3.32; Ballesteros–Weinstein indexing) and a tryptophan residue in transmembrane helix VII (Trp7.40) (22Li Q. Chapter 4-odor sensing by trace amineassociated receptors.in: Zufall F. Munger S.D. Chemosensory Transduction. In Methods Mol Biol. Academic Press, Cambridge, MA2018: 21-31Google Scholar, 23Huang E.S. Construction of a sequence motif characteristic of aminergic G protein-coupled receptors.Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1360-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Molecular docking and mutagenesis studies of mammalian TAAR1, mTAAR7e, and mTAAR7f demonstrate that the negatively charged residue Asp3.32 is critical for amine recognition and forms a salt bridge with the ligand amino group. Other highly variable residues in the transmembrane domains contribute to the selectivity for ligands and serve as scaffolds that stabilize ligand binding (12Ferrero D.M. Wacker D. Roque M.A. Baldwin M.W. Stevens R.C. Liberles S.D. Agonists for 13 trace amine-associated receptors provide insight into the molecular basis of odor selectivity.ACS Chem. Biol. 2012; 7: 1184-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). By contrast, a large number of teleost-TAARs lack Asp3.32, and instead, use Asp5.42 to form a salt bridge with an amino group of the biogenic amine. Several TAARs such as zTAAR13c, contain both Asp3.32 and Asp5.42 and recognize dicationic molecules including cadaverine and putrescine (13Li Q. Tachie-Baffour Y. Liu Z. Baldwin M.W. Kruse A.C. Liberles S.D. Non-classical amine recognition evolved in a large clade of olfactory receptors.Elife. 2015; 4e10441Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Notably, almost all sea lamprey and mouse TAARs have only a single negatively charged residue, Asp3.32 or Glu3.32 in transmembrane helix III that could theoretically recognize only one amino group of the polyamines. The structural basis for these TAARs to stabilize their interaction with the other amino groups in polyamines remains elusive. It is likely that vertebrate olfactory TAARs feature a salt bridge that engages a ligand amino group and have other scaffolds that contribute to the specificity of polyamine recognition. However, the structures of these predicted scaffolds and their function in recognizing amines with two or more amino groups have not been elucidated. We hypothesized that vertebrate TAARs rely on residues that form a cation–pi interaction or a hydrogen bond with the amino groups in addition to the salt bridge formed by Asp3.32 to recognize polyamines. In this study, we identified a sea lamprey olfactory TAAR receptor (sTAAR365) that shows a strikingly similar response profile to cadaverine, putrescine, and spermine as does mTAAR9. Through a systematic comparison of these two distant receptors with convergent functions, we show that sTAAR365 and mTAAR9 both possess conserved Asp3.32 and Tyr6.51 residues that interact with the two amino groups in cadaverine. In addition, sTAAR365 uses an extra Thr7.42 that stabilizes the recognition of cadaverine, serving as part of the amine-binding motif. In sTAAR365, this motif uses an additional negatively charged residue Glu7.36 that cooperates with Asp3.32 and Thr7.42 to recognize the tetraamine spermine. Likewise, mTAAR9 recognizes the triamine spermidine through an aromatic residue, Tyr7.43. Thus, sTAAR365 and mTAAR9 recognize these polyamines through a novel motif located in the transmembrane α-helices VI and VII. Taken together, our results propose a mechanism that sTAAR365 and mTAAR9 converged on their polyamine recognition through distinct motifs in a conserved binding site. We first asked whether mammalian TAAR9 orthologs are broadly tuned to triethylamine, cadaverine, spermidine, and spermine, as has been shown in mTAAR9 (16Saraiva L.R. Kondoh K. Ye X. Yoon K.H. Hernandez M. Buck L.B. Combinatorial effects of odorants on mouse behavior.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2016; 113: E3300-E3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We examined the response of TAAR9s from rat, human, hamster, and rabbit to the stimulation of 1 mM amines using a well-established cAMP response element (CRE)-driven luciferase reporter assay based on Golf-mediated cAMP signal transduction (5Scott A.M.

RTP family members induce functional expression of mammalian odorant receptors.Cell. 2004; 119: 679-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In addition to the four mTAAR9 ligands, we included putrescine, which is also a polyamine and precursor of spermine/spermidine biosynthesis. The tested TAAR9s were not activated by putrescine but exhibited varying degrees of activation to the other four amines (Fig. 1B). Rat TAAR9 showed the maximum responses to triethylamine, cadaverine, spermidine, and spermine compared with the other mammalian species. Cat TAAR9 displayed similar activation properties (potency and efficacy) to those of mTAAR9. These mTAAR9 ligands induced concentration-dependent activities in cells expressing mouse, rat, and cat TAAR9s (Fig. 1C). In contrast, human, hamster, and rabbit TAAR9s showed minimal activities for this set of ligands. We then sought to determine if other mouse olfactory TAARs are activated by the mTAAR9 ligands. Only mTAAR8c showed modest activity to 500 μM spermidine (Fig. 1D). Triethylamine induced robust responses by mTAAR7f and moderate activities for mTAAR5 and mTAAR8c (Fig. 1D). Other TAARs were not activated by cadaverine or spermidine. Based on these findings, we concluded that several mammalian TAAR9 orthologs detect polyamines. As the mouse is a model animal for olfactory studies, we focused the remainder of our studies on mouse TAAR9 to further characterize TAAR interactions with polyamines. Next, we questioned whether the sea lamprey TAAR repertoire contains members that are broadly tuned to biogenic amines and that share similar response profiles with mTAAR9. In a previous study, we reported that sTAAR348 responds to spermine when expressed in HEK293T cells but not to other structurally related biogenic amines (5Scott A.M. Zhang Z. Jia L. Li K. Zhang Q. Dexheimer T. Ellsworth E. Ren J. Chung-Davidson Y.W. Zu Y. Neubig R.R. Li W. Spermine in semen of male sea lamprey acts as a sex pheromone.PLoS Biol. 2019; 17e3000332Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment analyses indicated that sTAAR365 shares 74% sequence identity with sTAAR348 (Fig. S1). sTAAR348 and sTAAR365 showed 34.0% and 34.5% sequence identity, respectively, with mTAAR9 (Fig. S1). We reasoned that sTAAR365 could be a candidate as a polyamine receptor. To test this hypothesis, we used an established cAMP assay to examine the amine response properties of sTAAR365 (5Scott A.M. Zhang Z. Jia L. Li K. Zhang Q. Dexheimer T. Ellsworth E. Ren J. Chung-Davidson Y.W. Zu Y. Neubig R.R. Li W. Spermine in semen of male sea lamprey acts as a sex pheromone.PLoS Biol. 2019; 17e3000332Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). sTAAR365 was activated by cadaverine, putrescine, and spermine, but not by spermidine or triethylamine (Fig. 2A). Putrescine and spermine elicited a half maximal response (EC50) at concentrations of 56 μM and 28 μM, respectively, in cells expressing sTAAR365 (Fig. 2B). These are comparable to the potency of odorant receptor agonists in similar assays, ranging from 100 nM to 100 μM (25Rinaldi A. The scent of life. The exquisite complexity of the sense of smell in animals and humans.EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 26Saito H. Chi Q. Zhuang H. Matsunami H. Mainland J.D.

Structural basis for a broad but selective ligand spectrum of a mouse olfactory receptor: Mapping the odorant-binding site.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1806-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, sTAAR365 was exquisitely sensitive to cadaverine, with EC50 of 4 nM, and a response threshold approaching 100 pM (Fig. 2B). This level of sensitivity rivals the olfactory responses observed through in vivo recording (17Dewan A. Pacifico R. Zhan R. Rinberg D. Bozza T. Non-redundant coding of aversive odours in the main olfactory pathway.Nature. 2013; 497: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Moreover, the maximal efficacy (Emax) of sTAAR365 response to cadaverine was comparable to that for putrescine, whereas spermine elicited a maximal response of only one-third as much, suggesting that spermine likely acts as a partial agonist for sTAAR365. We confirmed expression of sTaar365 and mTaar9 in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) with in situ hybridization. For adult male and female sea lamprey, the antisense sTaar365 labeled cells were sparsely distributed in lamellae along the rostral-caudal axis of the main olfactory epithelium, displaying tall cell bodies situated in the deeper epithelium and long dendrites coursing toward the epithelium surface (Fig. S2). In comparison, no labeling was observed with the sense probe. The expression pattern of sTaar365 is very similar to that of mTaar9 in the mouse olfactory epithelium (Fig. S3). These results demonstrate that sTAAR365 and mTAAR9 are both broadly tuned and sparsely distributed in olfactory epithelia. A previous study of zTAAR13c by Li et al. (13Li Q. Tachie-Baffour Y. Liu Z. Baldwin M.W. Kruse A.C. Liberles S.D. Non-classical amine recognition evolved in a large clade of olfactory receptors.Elife. 2015; 4e10441Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) proposed that Asp3.32 and Asp5.42 each interact with one of the two amino groups in diamines, such as cadaverine and putrescine. However, it is not known how TAARs recognize polyamines with more than two amino groups. We sought to model the polyamine recognition sites, including residues that directly interact with additional amino groups, in sTAAR365 and mTAAR9. We speculated that TAARs use Asp3.32 to confer critical and direct interactions with one amino group, while other nearby polar and/or aromatic residues stabilize polyamine binding by forming hydrogen bond or pi–cation interactions. To test this hypothesis, we generated sTAAR365 and mTAAR9 homology models using GPCR-I-TASSER to predict the putative recognition residues for biogenic polyamines. The models were based on the crystal structures of nine homologous templates. The primary models of sTAAR365 and mTAAR9 shared a maximal identity of 31% and 40%, respectively, to their closest homologous template, the human β2-adrenergic GPCR (Protein Data Bank Entry 2rh1A). The homology model with the highest C-score was chosen as the final structure for molecular docking. Both the sTAAR365 and mTAAR9 models displayed a canonical GPCR structure with seven hydrophobic transmembrane α-helices and an eighth intracellular helix (H8) in the C-terminus. Using the homology models, we performed Induced Fit Docking (IFD) with Schrodinger Maestro 11.5 to predict the residues of sTAAR365 and mTAAR9 involved in polyamine binding. Several poses of ligand–receptor interactions were generated, and the top result was chosen according to docking scores and glide models. For sTAAR365, the highly conserved Asp3.32 contacts both amino groups of cadaverine, one is docked 2.67 Å away from the highly conserved Asp3.32, forming a salt bridge and a hydrogen bond with the carboxyl group of Asp3.32 (Fig. 3A). The second amino group of cadaverine also forms a pi–cation interaction with Tyr6.51 and a hydrogen bond with Thr7.42 (Fig. 3A). Similar to cadaverine, putrescine was predicted to interact with Asp3.32, Tyr6.51, and Thr7.42 (Fig. 3B). Notably, the distance between the carboxyl group of Asp3.32 and its salt-bridged amino group of putrescine is predicted at 3.61 Å. The difference in the salt bridge distance predicted for cadaverine and putrescine likely explains the 1000-fold difference in their potency for sTAAR365. We then docked spermine, a polyamine with four amino groups, into sTAAR365 homology model to infer how TAARs may interact with additional amino groups. As expected, the cadaverine recognition sites Asp3.32 and Thr7.42 are involved in spermine binding (Fig. 3C). Asp3.32 forms a salt bridge and a hydrogen bond with the two middle amino groups of spermine. The distance between the charged aspartate side chain and the further amino group of spermine is 4.22 Å. Meanwhile, an amino group at one end of spermine contacts the backbone of Thr7.42 with a hydrogen bond, while the amino group at the other end is anchored on the negatively charged residue Glu7.36, located in the extracellular vestibule of TM VII, through a salt bridge and a hydrogen bond. The distance between the carboxyl group of Glu7.36 and the terminal amino group of spermine is predicted at 4.33 Å. The salt bridges involved in spermine recognition are longer than the typical cutoff value for a salt bridge at 4 Å. These relatively weak ionic interactions may explain the partial activation of sTAAR365 by spermine. Docking cadaverine into mTAA9 homology model suggested that Asp3.32 and Tyr6.51 are the primary binding sites. The carboxyl group of Asp3.32 forms a salt bridge with one amino group of cadaverine at a distance of 4.41 Å (Fig. 4A) and a hydrogen bond with the second amino group of cadaverine. Likewise, Tyr6.51 is predicted to be part of the cadaverine-binding pocket, forming a hydrogen bond with the amino group of cadaverine (Fig. 4A). However, mTAAR9 differs from sTAAR365 by having Val7.42 instead of Thr7.42. The larger distance of the salt bridge and the lack of scaffold interaction with Thr7.42 may explain the much lower potency of cadaverine for mTAAR9 compared with sTAAR365. mTAAR9 exhibits robust responses to spermidine, a biosynthetic precursor of spermine. Results from docking spermidine (with three amino groups) into the mTAAR9 model suggested that an extra residue, Tyr7.43, cooperates with Asp3.32 and Tyr6.51 to form the binding pocket (Fig. 4B). Asp3.32 recognizes the middle amino group of spermidine by a salt bridge, at a distance of 2.87 Å, and a hydrogen bond. Moreover, a pi–cation interaction is also predicted between the Tyr6.51 residue and the middle amino group. For the amino"

It is thus important to understand the mechanisms controlling adiponectin exocytosis. This understanding is hindered by the high complexity of both the available data and the underlying signaling network. To deal with this complexity, we have previously investigated how different intracellular concentrations of Ca2+, cAMP, and ATP affect adiponectin exocytosis, using both patch-clamp recordings and systems biology mathematical modeling. Recent work has shown that adiponectin exocytosis is physiologically triggered via signaling pathways involving adrenergic β3 receptors (β3ARs). Therefore, we developed a mathematical model that also includes adiponectin exocytosis stimulated by extracellular epinephrine or the β3AR agonist CL 316243. Our new model is consistent with all previous patch-clamp data as well as new data (collected from stimulations with a combination of the intracellular mediators and extracellular adrenergic stimuli) and can predict independent validation data. We used this model to perform new in silico experiments where corresponding wet lab experiments would be difficult to perform. We simulated adiponectin exocytosis in single cells in response to the reduction of β3ARs that is observed in adipocytes from animals with obesity-induced diabetes. Finally, we used our model to investigate intracellular dynamics and to predict both cAMP levels and adiponectin release by scaling the model from single-cell to a population of cells—predictions corroborated by experimental data.

Our work brings us one step closer to understanding the intricate regulation of adiponectin exocytosis. The white adipocyte hormone adiponectin is a major regulator of glucose and lipid homeostasis, with direct effects on the liver, muscle, the vasculature, and the pancreas (1Ruan H. Dong L.Q. Adiponectin signaling and function in insulin target tissues.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2016; 8: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 2Wang Z.V. Scherer P.E. Adiponectin, the past two decades.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2016; 8: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Adiponectin levels are decreased in obese/type 2 diabetic individuals, and preserved adiponectin levels are associated with a reduced risk of developing metabolic disease (3Kadowaki T. Yamauchi T. Kubota N. Hara K. Ueki K. Tobe K. Adiponectin and adiponectin receptors in insulin resistance, diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome.J. Clin.

Although much is known regarding the important pathophysiological roles of adiponectin, the mechanisms regulating its secretion from white adipocytes are less well studied. Our previous experimental work has defined a secretory pathway where adiponectin-containing vesicles are released in response to an elevation of intracellular cAMP and activation of Epac1 (Exchange Protein directly Activated by cAMP, isoform 1). In addition, both Ca2+ and ATP have important roles for augmentation of adiponectin release as well as for maintenance of adiponectin secretion over extended time periods (5Komai A.M. Brännmark C. Musovic S. Olofsson C.S. PKA-independent cAMP stimulation of white adipocyte exocytosis and adipokine secretion: Modulations by Ca2+ and ATP.J. Physiol. 2014; 592: 5169-5186Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 6El Hachmane M.F. Komai A.M. Olofsson C.S. Cooling reduces cAMP-stimulated exocytosis and adiponectin secretion at a Ca2+-dependent step in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.PLoS One. 2015; 10e0119530Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, the same mediators that are important for secretion of conventional hormones are involved in the regulation of adiponectin exocytosis (although peptide/protein hormone secretion is typically stimulated by an elevation of cytosolic Ca2+) (7Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. Secretory granule exocytosis.Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 581-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). In later work, we showed that adiponectin secretion is physiologically stimulated via adrenergic signaling, chiefly involving beta3 adrenergic receptors (β3ARs). The same study demonstrates that adiponectin release is blunted in adipocytes from obese and diabetic mice, due to lower abundance of β3ARs in a state of catecholamine resistance (8Komai A.M. Musovic S. Peris E. Alrifaiy A. El Hachmane M.F. Johansson M. Asterholm I.W. Olofsson C.S. White adipocyte adiponectin exocytosis is stimulated via β3-adrenergic signaling and activation of Epac1: Catecholamine resistance in obesity and type 2 diabetes.Diabetes. 2016; 65: 3301-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Clearly, the pathophysiological control of adiponectin secretion involves a highly complex signaling network of not yet fully understood interactions. To deal with this high complexity, we have employed a systems biology approach combining experiments with mathematical modeling. We have previously developed a mathematical model for single-cell adiponectin exocytosis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (9Brännmark C. Lövfors W. Komai A.M. Axelsson T. El Hachmane M.F. Musovic S. Paul A. Nyman E. Olofsson C.S. Mathematical modeling of white adipocyte exocytosis predicts adiponectin secretion and quantifies the rates of vesicle exo- and endocytosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 20032-20043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In this previous work, changes in plasma membrane capacitance were measured using the patch-clamp technique. As vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane upon exocytosis, the membrane area is enlarged, and this can be measured as an increase in capacitance (the separation of charges over the plasma membrane) (10Lindau M. Neher E. Patch-clamp techniques for time-resolved capacitance measurements in single cells.Pflügers Arch. 1988; 411: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Capacitance recordings can thus provide detailed information about the exocytosis process, at high time resolution and in live single cells, including adipocytes (11Komai A.M. Shrestha M.M. Musovic S. Olofsson C.S. An approach to monitor exocytosis in white adipocytes.in: Exocytosis and Endocytosis: Methods in Molecular Biology. Vol 2233. Springer US, New York, NY2021: 203-222Google Scholar). In our previous work, capacitance measurements were utilized to model how vesicle exo- and endocytosis are affected by different combinations of intracellular Ca2+, cAMP, and ATP concentrations (9Brännmark C. Lövfors W. Komai A.M. Axelsson T. El Hachmane M.F. Musovic S. Paul A. Nyman E. Olofsson C.S.

The concentrations of intracellular mediators were altered by inclusion of different concentrations in the patch pipette attached to the cell. During the electrophysiological recordings, the pipette is in direct contact with the cell interior, allowing exchange between the pipette filling solution and the cell cytosol. We routinely measure adipocyte exocytosis in cultured adipocytes by this approach, and our studies have demonstrated that the cAMP-triggered and Ca2+-augmented capacitance increase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes largely represents secretion of adiponectin (5Komai A.M. Brännmark C. Musovic S. Olofsson C.S. PKA-independent cAMP stimulation of white adipocyte exocytosis and adipokine secretion: Modulations by Ca2+ and ATP.J.

Our model in (9Brännmark C. Lövfors W. Komai A.M. Axelsson T. El Hachmane M.F. Musovic S. Paul A. Nyman E. Olofsson C.S.

Chem. 2017; 292: 20032-20043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) allowed us to extract detailed information contained in patch-clamp experiments and thus estimate the relative differences in adiponectin exo-and endocytosis rates. We could also correctly predict adiponectin secretion stimulated by cAMP in the presence or absence of Ca2+ or ATP. However, effects of extracellular cues, such as adrenergic stimulation, were not included in our previous model. This is an important shortcoming, since catecholamine stimulation constitutes a central stimulus-secretion pathway for adiponectin in normal physiological conditions. In the current study, we have extended the model in Brännmark 2017 (9Brännmark C. Lövfors W. Komai A.M. Axelsson T. El Hachmane M.F. Musovic S. Paul A. Nyman E. Olofsson C.S. Mathematical modeling of white adipocyte exocytosis predicts adiponectin secretion and quantifies the rates of vesicle exo- and endocytosis.J. Biol.

The resulting model can describe all previous capacitance data as well as new data of stimulation with epinephrine or the β3AR agonist CL 316243 (CL). The model can explain data used for training, as well as accurately predict independent validation data. Simulations with the new and improved model allow us to better understand the mechanisms involved in the adrenergic control of adiponectin exocytosis. By enlarging the pool of available data and evolving the mechanistic hypothesis, we expanded the model in (9Brännmark C. Lövfors W. Komai A.M. Axelsson T. El Hachmane M.F. Musovic S. Paul A. Nyman E. Olofsson C.S. Mathematical modeling of white adipocyte exocytosis predicts adiponectin secretion and quantifies the rates of vesicle exo- and endocytosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 20032-20043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) to include external receptor-mediated adrenergic stimulation (Fig. 1A). More specifically, we tested if the model could be improved to produce an acceptable agreement to the new expanded dataset, by doing several iterations of the lower branch in Figure 1B. First, the original model was extended to include a more accurate representation of the pipette, where diffusion and the differences in volume between the pipette and intracellular compartments were taken into account. This was necessary because the external adrenergic stimulus present in the new data represents a more physiological way of elevating cytosolic cAMP, which differs from the previous studied effects of “clamping” cAMP levels by the pipette. With this more precise representation of the pipette introduced, adrenergic signaling was included in the model by adding the β3ARs and their effect on intracellular cAMP (Fig. 2).Figure 2Detailed overview of our extended model. Stimulus in the model occurs either via the pipette solution (ATP, cAMP, and Ca2+) or externally (epinephrine or CL). The pipette stimulus is allowed to diffuse between the pipette and the inside of the cell, while the external stimulus leads to activation of the receptor, which in turn leads to an increase in cytosolic cAMP. The transition of vesicles from the reserve pool to the releasable pool is stimulated by Ca2+, either alone or augmented with ATP. The fusion of adiponectin vesicles residing in the releasable pool is triggered by cAMP and augmented by both Ca2+and ATP. Vesicles in the PM pool can either go back to the releasable pool or be exocytosed, independent of stimuli. Endocytosis is stimulated by Ca2+ but must be preceded by an elevation of cAMP (to trigger exocytosis).

The new data including the response to external stimulation are shown in Figure 3, A and B, and the old data used in the development of the previous model (pipette stimulation only (9Brännmark C.

Adiponectin exocytosis is stimulated either by epinephrine (EPI) or CL with different concentrations of cAMP, ATP, and Ca2+ included in the pipette solution (IC). The experimental data points are denoted by black dots and error bars representing the mean and SEM values. The model simulations are shown as solid red lines for the best agreement with data (with optimal parameter set θest∗, values given in Table 1), and the orange area represents the bounds of the model uncertainty. The model uncertainty was gathered by maximizing and minimizing the simulation in each experimentally measured time point, while still requiring a cost below the χ2-threshold. Clearly, the model agrees well with data, both for the EC and the IC stimulus data. This visual assessment of the good agreement is statistically supported by the fact that the model passes a χ2-test (cost(θest∗) = 28.4 < χ2(0.05, 24) = 36.4; Experimental procedures). As can be seen, the model uncertainties are reasonable and limited. In summary, the new model can describe all previous IC data as well as new data involving both IC and EC stimulation.Table 1Optimal parameter valuesParameterValueKrel3.7356 · 10−4kexo2.3764 · 10−2kCaATP6.5771 · 101kcAMP5.9263 · 10−2kCa22.4300 · 10−4kATP22.2347 · 10−2kEndo5.8257 · 102kCacAMP1.7826 · 101Km7.2790 · 10−3kdegcAMP3.3182 · 10−4kremCa1.2482 · 10−2kdegATP1.9718 · 103kDiffcAMP2.0835 · 10−2kDiffCa4.4218 · 10−2kDiffATP3.4721kB3.9240kCL5.6875 · 10−3k12.2070 · 10−3k22.4024 · 10−2k31.0046 · 10−4Vpip2.1168 · 10−5Vcell1.3990 · 10−13The optimal values found for the model parameters during parameter estimation.

We next tested if the new model is able to correctly predict new independent validation data. The validation experiment consists of a combination of EC and IC inputs: 1 μM CL and 3 mM ATP, respectively (Fig. 4A). The prediction uncertainty was gathered in the same way as the model uncertainty, by maximizing and minimizing the prediction. Since the prediction has a low uncertainty (less than 30% at the peak value), it is meaningful to compare the prediction with experimental data, to test the quality of the model. This experimental data is shown in Figure 4B. As can be seen, both quantitative and qualitative aspects are in agreement. At t = 2, simulations show a peak value between 11 and 20 fF/s, which is in excellent agreement with the experimental range of 13 to 20 fF/s. Note that it is not important that the ranges are identical, but only that they are overlapping. The agreement is also statistically confirmed by the fact that the model passes a χ2-test, with the optimal parameter set from the estimation (cost(θest∗) = 12.1 < χ2(0.05, 6) = 12.6). The validated model can be used to predict the outcome of new experiments in single cells, given the mechanisms included in the model. To illustrate this capability, we simulated a new experiment that would be challenging to carry out experimentally. The simulated in silico experiment was inspired by published data demonstrating that adrenergically triggered adiponectin secretion (adiponectin collected during a 30 min static incubation) was almost completely abrogated in primary adipocytes isolated from obese and diabetic mice. This blunted secretion was associated with a 30% lower abundance of β3ARs (8Komai A.M. Musovic S. Peris E. Alrifaiy A. El Hachmane M.F. Johansson M. Asterholm I.W. Olofsson C.S. White adipocyte adiponectin exocytosis is stimulated via β3-adrenergic signaling and activation of Epac1: Catecholamine resistance in obesity and type 2 diabetes.Diabetes. 2016; 65: 3301-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), a condition we can also include in the model. Figure 5A shows our own adiponectin secretion data from an experiment, where cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes were genetically ablated for β3ARs (small interfering RNA reducing gene expression by ∼60%) and stimulated with epinephrine during a 30 min static incubation. As can be seen, adiponectin release is increased twofold in control (scramble) cells exposed to epinephrine, whereas siRNA-treated adipocytes show a nonsignificant response. To experimentally investigate how reduced expression of β3ARs affects the molecular regulation of adiponectin exocytosis by applying single cell patch-clamp to siRNA-treated cells is demanding. We therefore used our model to examine the corresponding predictions in silico. The amount of β3AR was downregulated by 30% or 60%, thus corresponding to the two experiments described above, and the resulting exocytosis response was simulated. Figure 5B shows the result, where the simulation consists of a combination of 5 μM EPI (EC) and 3 mM ATP (IC; no cAMP or Ca2+ included), for both control (orange area) and perturbed (blue striped areas) cells. As can be seen, the 30% and 60% downregulation of β3ARs is only translated into an approximate 20% and 47% decrease in peak exocytosis respectively; thus single-cell adiponectin exocytosis as understood by our model is significantly less affected than the experimental data on secretion indicates. As demonstrated in Figure 5C, simulation with 1 μM CL EC, under the same IC conditions as in 5B, yielded similar results. As shown in Figure 5D, inclusion of Ca2+ (IC) in the model partly rescues the reduced response.

Open table in a new tab Summary of the predicted inhibition of adiponectin secretion upon a 30% and 60% reduction of β3ARs, using our new model for single cells. The three conditions I to III correspond to Figure 5, B–D, and the quantifications are done for the parameter set resulting in the largest prediction, at the time point of the highest secretion. To test the effect of an intracellular Ca2+ elevation on adiponectin secretion in a population of cells, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated (30 min) in the presence of the adenylyl cyclase activator Forskolin (FSK; 10 μM) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor Isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX; 200 μM), and/or with the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin. FSK/IBMX elevates 3T3-L1 adipocyte intracellular cAMP to high levels (5Komai A.M. Brännmark C. Musovic S. Olofsson C.S. PKA-independent cAMP stimulation of white adipocyte exocytosis and adipokine secretion: Modulations by Ca2+ and ATP.J. Physiol. 2014; 592: 5169-5186Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and ionomycin potently increases adipocyte intracellular Ca2+ (6El Hachmane M.F. Komai A.M. Olofsson C.S. Cooling reduces cAMP-stimulated exocytosis and adiponectin secretion at a Ca2+-dependent step in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.PLoS One. 2015; 10e0119530Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As expected, FSK/IBMX stimulated adiponectin release. In line with data in Figure 5D, adiponectin secretion was induced also by the ionophore ionomycin alone (although of a lower magnitude compared with FSK/IBMX) and the ionophore tended to increase adiponectin release stimulated by FSK/IBIX (Fig. 5E). We used our validated model to investigate the intracellular dynamics. With the validated model we can observe all model variables under all considered experimental conditions, even variables corresponding to entities that are currently experimentally unmeasurable. A selection of the model states and experimental conditions are presented in Figure 6. By analyzing the model variables we could determine that:(1)The exocytosis is delayed with respect to the receptor activation. For experiments with EPI or CL, this delay is observed upon comparing the model states for the exocytosis (Fig. 6, A–C) and the receptor activation (Fig. 6, E–G) at the time of the peak. Clearly, the exocytosis peaks at a later time point compared with the receptor activation. This is true for all conditions, even when taking the uncertainty of the predictions into account.(2)The exocytosis is halted when the releasable vesicle pool is depleted (cf. the model states for the exocytosis in Fig. 6, A–D with the releasable pool in Fig. 6, M–P). When the releasable vesicle pool is depleted (approaches zero), the exocytosis ceases. Note that in the experiment with CL and Ca2+ (Fig. 6O), the releasable pool is not depleted, due to Ca2+-dependent replenishment of vesicles residing in the reserve pool. Thus, in the experiment with CL and Ca2+, exocytosis is sustained.(3)cAMP is rate-determining with regard to the exocytosis (cf. the temporal dynamics for peak exocytosis in Fig. 6, A–D with the peak for cAMP in Fig. 6, I–L in the experiments with EPI or CL). In all three experimental series (Fig. 6, A–C and I–K), the peaks follow the same temporal pattern. In the experiment without extracellular stimuli and with cAMP and ATP (without Ca2+) included in the pipette solution (Fig. 6D), the exocytosis follows the cAMP increase initially (Fig. 6L) but later drops despite a sustained high cAMP level. We ascribe this to the depletion of the releasable vesicle pool (Fig. 6P), related to 2) above. To test the model predictions, we compared cAMP predictions with experimental data from a population of cells, and we collected new experimental data for adiponectin secretion (Experimental procedures). The predicted ranges of cAMP levels at 30 min overlap with the experimentally measured values for EPI stimulation (Fig. 6I, predicted: 13.4–114.8, measured: 22.4 ± 0.7) and are slightly above the measured values for CL stimulation (Fig. 6J, predicted: 13.2–91.6, measured: 2.0 ± 0.5; (8Komai A.M. Musovic S. Peris E. Alrifaiy A. El Hachmane M.F. Johansson M. Asterholm I.W. Olofsson C.S.

For adiponectin secretion, the model simulations needed to be scaled from one single cell to a population of cells. This was done by expressing both experimental data and model simulations as fold over the amount of adiponectin secreted after 15 min of CL stimulation. As shown in Figure 6R, the model prediction at 30 min (1.0–1.15) agrees well with the experimental data for CL-triggered adiponectin release (1.1 ± 0.2). The aim of this work was to develop a comprehensive mathematical model of adiponectin exocytosis that includes adrenergic stimulus, a chief signaling pathway involved in the physiological regulation of adiponectin secretion. To the best of our knowledge, no such model exists. The final model can explain a combination of experimental data, and it can predict independent validation data as well as be used to simulate nontrivial predictions (alterations and measurements that are difficult to perform experimentally). Below we will discuss the usefulness of our model, as well as some of its limitations. Although our mathematical model in (9Brännmark C. Lövfors W. Komai A.M. Axelsson T. El Hachmane M.F. Musovic S.

Our own more recent research has shown that adiponectin exocytosis is triggered by catecholamine signaling via activation of β3ARs (8Komai A.M. Musovic S. Peris E. Alrifaiy A. El Hachmane M.F. Johansson M. Asterholm I.W. Olofsson C.S.

In the current work, we have therefore developed a model that is able to describe the combination of internal and external (adrenergic) stimulus (Fig. 3), which thus brings us closer to a representative physiological model of adiponectin exocytosis. The model can describe both previous and new data (Fig. 3), and it can accurately predict independent validation data not used for estimating the parameter values (Fig. 4). This agreement with the data is supported by statistical tests showing that the data could have been generated by simulations with the model plus random noise. We used the validated model to predict how adiponectin exocytosis would be affected if the abundance of β3ARs was reduced by 30%. This magnitude of decreased β3AR protein expression has been observed in primary subcutaneous adipocytes isolated from mice with obesity-induced diabet"

The ACTA2 variant p.Arg149Cys (R149C) is the most common alteration; however, only 60% of carriers have a dissection or undergo repair of an aneurysm by 70 years of age. A mouse model of ACTA2 p.Arg149Cys was generated using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to determine the etiology of reduced penetrance. Acta2R149C/+ mice had significantly decreased aortic contraction compared with WT mice but did not form aortic aneurysms or dissections when followed to 24 months, even when hypertension was induced. In vitro motility assays found decreased interaction of mutant SM α-actin filaments with SM myosin. Polymerization studies using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy showed enhanced nucleation of mutant SM α-actin by formin, which correlated with disorganized and reduced SM α-actin filaments in Acta2R149C/+ smooth muscle cells (SMCs). However, the most prominent molecular defect was the increased retention of mutant SM α-actin in the chaperonin-containing t-complex polypeptide folding complex, which was associated with reduced levels of mutant compared with WT SM α-actin in Acta2R149C/+ SMCs. These data indicate that Acta2R149C/+ mice do not develop thoracic aortic disease despite decreased contraction of aortic segments and disrupted SM α-actin filament formation and function in Acta2R149C/+ SMCs. Enhanced binding of mutant SM α-actin to chaperonin-containing t-complex polypeptide decreases the mutant actin versus WT monomer levels in Acta2R149C/+ SMCs, thus minimizing the effect of the mutation on SMC function and potentially preventing aortic disease in the Acta2R149C/+ mice."

Here, we find that homologous chromosome pairing protein 2 (Hop2) functions as an inhibitor for the TF CEBPα. We found that Hop2 mRNA is highly and specifically expressed in adipose tissue, and that ectopic Hop2 expression suppresses reporter activity induced by CEBP as revealed by DNA transfection. Recombinant and ectopically expressed Hop2 was shown to interact with CEBPα in pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays, and interaction between endogenous Hop2 and CEBPα was observed in the nuclei of 3T3 preadipocytes and adipocytes by immunofluorescence and coimmunoprecipitation of nuclear extracts. In addition, Hop2 stable overexpression in 3T3 preadipocytes inhibited adipocyte differentiation and adipocyte marker gene expression. These in vitro data suggest that Hop2 inhibits adipogenesis by suppressing CEBP-mediated transactivation. Consistent with a negative role for Hop2 in adipogenesis, ablation of Hop2 (Hop2−/−) in mice led to increased body weight, adipose volume, adipocyte size, and adipogenic marker gene expression. Adipogenic differentiation of isolated adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells showed a greater number of lipid droplet–containing colonies formed in Hop2−/− adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell cultures than in wt controls, which is associated with the increased expression of adipogenic marker genes. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed a higher binding activity of endogenous CEBPα to peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ, a master adipogenic TF, and a known CEBPα target gene.

Adipose tissues play a significant role in the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis. It stores energy in the form of fat, offers insulation and protection to soft vital organs, and produces more than 600 secretory molecules, collectively named adipokines, to regulate food intake, energy expenditure, insulin sensitivity, fat distribution, inflammation, and blood pressure (1Lehr S.

Diabetes. 2008; 116 Suppl 1: S4-S6Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The cellular basis of obesity involves an increased number and size of adipocytes, resulting from proliferation and differentiation of adipocyte progenitor cells or preadipocytes (7Faust I.M.

Understanding the molecular and cellular basis of adipocyte proliferation and differentiation is critical to improving the management of obesity and associated diseases. The molecular regulation of adipocyte differentiation has been extensively investigated. A transcriptional cascade, which was identified 3 decades ago by in vitro studies of the cultured preadipocyte 3T3-L1 cell line (10Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L.

Stimulation of adipogenesis in fibroblasts by PPAR gamma 2, a lipid-activated transcription factor.Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3046) Google Scholar), plays a central role in the regulation of this process. Upon the stimulation of an adipogenic “cocktail” containing insulin and glucocorticoids, two basic (b) leucine zipper (Zip) containing transcription factors (TFs), the CCAAT enhancer binding protein (CEBP) β and CEBPδ, are expressed. The two CEBP proteins form a heterodimer to bind promoters of the peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated TFs, and CEBPα. The PPARγ and CEBPα can activate themselves and each other to form a feed-forward loop that maintains a high level of PPARγ expression in terminally differentiated adipocytes (12Wu Z. Rosen E.D.

The PPARγ and CEBPα have been shown by RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to synergistically activate many key metabolic adipocyte marker genes, including adipocyte protein 2 (aP2), glucose transporter 4 (Glut4), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pepck), leptin (Lep), and adiponectin (An) involved in fatty acid transport, triglyceride synthesis, and insulin sensitivity (13Madsen M.S.

Thus, both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated this cascade of TFs in which the CEBPβ and CEBPδ activate PPARγ and CEBPα to promote adipocytes to acquire and maintain terminally differentiated phenotypes.

Using the bZip motif as a bait, we recently identified that homologous pairing protein 2 (Hop2) also binds to ATF4 (28Zhang Y. Lin T. Lian N. Tao H. Li C. Li L. Yang X.

In mammals, the mRNA of Hop2 is robustly expressed in the testis and genetic ablation of Hop2 in mice, in which the first three exons of the Hop2 gene were replaced with the neomycin-resistant gene (Neo), leads to infertility because of a failure in the formation of haploid gametes (34Petukhova G.V.

Cell. 2003; 5: 927-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Previous cell culture studies found a nonmeiotic role that Hop2 plays by acting as a tissue-specific coactivator of nuclear receptors, which is consistent with the observation that the expression of Hop2 mRNA was broader than originally reported (28Zhang Y.

Our previous work demonstrated that in osteoblasts, the binding of Hop2 to ATF4 stimulates ATF4-mediated transactivation and promotes osteoblast differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Genetic interaction between ATF4 and Hop2 was best demonstrated by osteopenia (low bone mass) in the Atf4+/−:Hop2+/− double heterozygous (het) mice, which is identical to a low bone mass in Hop2−/− mice and milder than osteoporosis in Atf4−/− mice (23Yang X.

Interestingly, Hop2−/− mice display an increased body weight and adipose tissue mass under normal chow, and this abnormal adipose phenotype is absent in the Atf4+/−:Hop2+/− double het mice. This important observation led us to hypothesize that Hop2 in adipocytes interacts with one or more of the three adipocyte bZip TFs to regulate adipogenesis. This hypothesis is further supported by our previous finding that ATF4 is an extremely labile protein that is undetectable in adipose tissue (35Ducy P. Karsenty G.

We provide data demonstrating that the binding of Hop2 to CEBPα suppresses the DNA binding of CEBPα to its target genes. In vivo, ablation of Hop2 in mice leads to increased adiposity compared with wt or het (+/−) littermates, whereas, in cells, forced expression of Hop2 in preadipocytes suppresses adipocyte differentiation. Consistent with an inhibitory role, the Hop2 protein level is high in preadipocytes but low in differentiated adipocytes. Thus, our study for the first time reveals a novel function of Hop2 in adipose tissues. With the C-terminal bZip motif of ATF4 on a yeast hybrid screening of mouse complementary DNA (cDNA) library, we previously identified an atypical Zip-containing protein Hop2 that binds and stimulates ATF4-dependent transcription and osteoblast differentiation (28Zhang Y. Lin T. Lian N. Tao H. Li C. Li L. Yang X. Hop2 interacts with ATF4 to promote osteoblast differentiation.J. Bone Miner. Res. 2019; 34: 2287-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, our data revealed that this well-characterized meiotic-specific protein is also highly and specifically expressed in adipose tissue among 13 somatic tissues examined (28Zhang Y. Lin T. Lian N. Tao H. Li C. Li L. Yang X. Hop2 interacts with ATF4 to promote osteoblast differentiation.J. Bone Miner. Res. 2019; 34: 2287-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Quantitative RT–PCR (qRT–PCR) of total RNA isolated from 2-month-old male mouse tissues revealed that Hop2 mRNA level is about 10 and 12 times higher in brown and white fat adiposes than in skin, bone, lung, and kidney, but approximately ten times lower than in testis (Fig. 1A). The endogenous expression of Hop2 in preadipocytes and adipocytes was then validated by qRT–PCR and Western blot with validated antibody (Fig. S1) analyses of differentiating primary adipocyte-derived mesenchymal stem cells (aMSCs) and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, and interestingly, Hop2 mRNA and protein levels are higher in undifferentiated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes than in fully differentiated adipocytes (Fig. 1, B–G). These results suggest an intrinsic role that Hop2 plays in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation and function. To begin to address the functional relevance of the expression of Hop2 in adipocyte differentiation, we tested whether Hop2 influences the CEBP-dependent transactivation activity in vitro. The three adipocyte CEBP isoforms, CEBPα, CEBPβ, and CEBPδ, share over 90% homology in their DNA-binding domains and recognize and activate the same consensus sequences (38Osada S. Yamamoto H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Two reporter constructs, C3-Luc and Leptin-Luc, were used in our DNA cotransfection assays. The complement 3 (C3) contains a promoter fragment covering −1 to −199 bp of the human C3 with two direct repeats of a CEBP consensus binding sequence at −110 (TTGAGAAAT) and −123 (TTAGGAAAT) (39Wilson D.R.

Chen H. Quon M.J. Reitman M. The mouse obese gene. Genomic organization, promoter activity, and activation by CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28887-28891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Reporter assays showed that cotransfection of CEBPα, CEBPβ, and CEBPδ expression plasmids, individually, with the C3-Luc increases the reporter's activity by 6.1-, 4.5-, and 5.7-fold, respectively. Hop2 cotransfection brought down the CEBP-induced reporter's activity to 1.6-, 3.1-, and 2.2-fold, corresponding to a 74%, 31%, and 61% suppression on CEBPα-, CEBPβ-, and CEBPδ-dependent activation, respectively (Fig. 1, J–L). This inhibitory effect is specific for Hop2 because cotransfection of ATF4, a bZip TF reported dimerizing with CEBPβ (21Cohen D.M. Won K.J. Nguyen N. Lazar M.A. Chen C.S. Steger D.J.

Lin T. Lian N. Tao H. Li C. Li L. Yang X. Hop2 interacts with ATF4 to promote osteoblast differentiation.J. Bone Miner. Res. 2019; 34: 2287-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), had no significant suppression on the CEBPα- and CEBPβ-dependent reporter's activity, except for a 30% inhibition on CEBPδ-induced transactivation. The Hop2-specific suppression on the CEBP-mediated transactivation was also observed on the Leptin-Luc reporter, in which Hop2 reduces CEBP-induced reporter's activity from 35.7- to 12.2-fold, 21.0- to 1.7-fold, and 31.9- to 1.4-fold representing a 66%, 92%, and 97% inhibition for CEBPα, CEBPβ, and CEBPδ, respectively (Fig. 1, M–O). Again, ATF4 cotransfection did not cause a significant change in the CEBP-dependent activation. These data indicated that Hop2 conveys a strong and specific inhibition of the transactivation potential of all three CEBP isoforms. Leucine zipper domain or Zip is a common structural motif mediating protein–protein interactions (42Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. The leucine zipper: A hypothetical structure common to a new class of DNA binding proteins.Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2495) Google Scholar), and our previous studies established that the Zip domain of Hop2 is necessary and sufficient to mediate its interaction with the bZip domains of ATF4 (28Zhang Y. Lin T. Lian N. Tao H. Li C. Li L. Yang X. Hop2 interacts with ATF4 to promote osteoblast differentiation.J. Bone Miner. Res. 2019; 34: 2287-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). These findings led us to hypothesize that Hop2 suppresses the CEBP-dependent transactivation by interacting with these bZip TFs in adipocytes. Given the fact that genetic deletion of CEBPα alone was sufficient to block adipocyte differentiation in vivo (17Wang N.D. Finegold M.J. Bradley A. Ou C.N. Abdelsayed S.V. Wilde M.D. Taylor L.R. Wilson D.R. Darlington G.J. Impaired energy homeostasis in C/EBP alpha knockout mice.Science. 1995; 269: 1108-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar), we focused our next set of experiments on this founding member of the CEBP subfamily (43Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. The DNA binding domain of the rat liver nuclear protein C/EBP is bipartite.Science. 1989; 243: 1681-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). To detect a direct binding between Hop2 and CEBPα, we purified recombinant glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-Hop2 and His-CEBPα fusion proteins expressed in bacteria. Pull-down assays demonstrated that GST-Hop2, but not GST, was able to pull down His-CEBPα protein, and conversely, a Ni-charged affinity chromatography retained GST-Hop2 only in the presence of His-CEBPα (Fig. 2, B and C). These results thus show that Hop2 and CEBPα interact directly in vitro. To determine whether Hop2 interacts with CEBPα in cells, we transfected COS1 cells transiently with expressing plasmids encoding hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Hop2 (HA-Hop2) and Flag-CEBPα singly or together. Nuclear extracts (NEs) of COS1 cells ectopically expressing HA-Hop2 and Flag-CEBPα were subjected to coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP). As expected, an anti-HA antibody (Ab) precipitated HA-Hop2 and an anti-Flag Ab precipitated Flag-CEBPα from NEs of COS1 cells expressing either HA-Hop2 or Flag-CEBPα alone (positive control; Fig. 2D). Moreover, the anti-HA cross precipitated Flag-CEBPα, whereas the anti-Flag Ab brought down HA-Hop2 from the NEs of COS1 cells coexpressing both HA-Hop2 and Flag-CEBPα, but not expressing each of these proteins singly (negative controls). Furthermore, immunocytochemistry of COS1 cells transiently overexpressing both HA-Hop2 and Flag-CEBPα and of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes transiently overexpressing HA-Hop2 detected double-positive signals (orange) with anti-HA (green) and anti-Flag (red) or anti-CEBPα Abs in the nuclei of these cells (Fig. S2, A and B), confirming a colocalization of Hop2 and CEBPα when overexpressed. To further examine whether endogenous Hop2 interacts with adipocyte CEBP bZip TFs under physiological conditions, we isolated NEs from visceral adipose tissues (VATs) and performed co-IP with Abs against Hop2 and CEBP bZips. Anti-Hop2 Abs, but not anti-IgG Abs (negative control), precipitated all three isoforms of the CEBPα, CEBP-β, and CEBP-δ; and reciprocally, anti-CEBPα, anti-CEBPβ, and anti-CEBPδ Abs, but not anti-IgG Abs, precipitated Hop2 (Fig. 2, E–G). In addition, immunofluorescence of mouse VAT verified that endogenous Hop2 (red) and CEBPα (green) are colocalized in the nuclei (blue) of adipocytes (Fig. 2H), supporting that Hop2 plays an intrinsic physiological role in adipocytes. To further explore at which stage(s) of adipocyte differentiation that the interaction between Hop2 and CEBPs takes place, we analyzed the temporal and dynamic expression pattern of the three CEBP bZip TFs. Western blot found that the protein expression levels of CEBPβ and CEBP-δ in 3T3-L1 cells are low in undifferentiated cultures (day 0), increased in 2-day cultures, and then reduced to undetectable in 4-day cultures upon adipocyte induction (Fig. S2C).

For example, PCDC4 has been implicated in the regulation of transcription and mRNA translation. PDCD4 is known to inhibit translation initiation by binding to eukaryotic initiation factor 4A and elongation of oncogenic c- and A-myb mRNAs. Additionally, PDCD4 has been shown to interact with poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), which affects translation termination, although the significance of this interaction is not fully understood. Considering the interaction between PABP and PDCD4, we hypothesized that PDCD4 may also be involved in translation termination. Using in vitro translation systems, we revealed that PDCD4 directly activates translation termination. PDCD4 stimulates peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis induced by a complex of eukaryotic release factors, eRF1-eRF3. Moreover, in combination with the PABP, which also stimulates peptide release, PDCD4 activity in translation termination increases. PDCD4 regulates translation termination by facilitating the binding of release factors to the ribosome, increasing the GTPase activity of eRF3, and dissociating eRF3 from the posttermination complex. Using a toe-printing assay, we determined the first stage at which PDCD4 functions—binding of release factors to the A-site of the ribosome. However, preventing binding of eRF3 with PABP, PDCD4 suppresses subsequent rounds of translation termination. Based on these data, we assumed that human PDCD4 controls protein synthesis during translation termination.

An increase in PDCD4 expression at the mRNA and protein levels can occur in response to a variety of apoptosis inducers, thus affecting multiple signaling pathways (8Chen Z. Yuan Y. Wang Y. Liu Z.

Accordingly, PDCD4 overexpression inhibits cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth (10Gaur A.B. Holbeck S.L. Colburn N.H. Israel M.A. Downregulation of Pdcd4 by mir-21 facilitates glioblastoma proliferation in vivo.Neuro Oncol. 2011; 13: 580-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The PDCD4 protein can migrate between the nucleus and cytoplasm as it contains two nuclear export signals. Under normal growth conditions, PDCD4 is mainly located in the nucleus; however, PDCD4 is predominantly cytoplasmic upon serum withdrawal (21Böhm M. Sawicka K. Siebrasse J.P. Brehmer-Fastnacht A. Peters R. Klempnauer K.H. The transformation suppressor protein Pdcd4 shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm and binds RNA.Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4905-4910Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The localization of PDCD4 is regulated by Akt kinase; phosphorylation of S457 on the PDCD4 protein by Akt kinase tags it for nuclear translocation (22Palamarchuk A. Efanov A. Maximov V. Aqeilan R.I. Croce C.M. Pekarsky Y. Akt phosphorylates and regulates Pdcd4 tumor suppressor protein.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 11282-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The mechanism of PDCD4 functioning in the cytoplasm appears to be closely related to the regulation of protein translation. PDCD4 contains the N-terminal RNA-binding domain and two MA3 domains located in the central and C-terminal regions of the protein (Fig. 1A). The MA3 domain belongs to the families of HEAT (Huntingtin, elongation factor 3, protein phosphatase 2A, and TOR1 kinase) repeat domains. HEAT is a structural motif consisting of repeats of two α-helices connected by a short loop (23Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Eukaryote-specific domains in translation initiation factors: Implications for translation regulation and evolution of the translation system.Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1172-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The MA3 domains are approximately 120 amino acids long and contain seven or eight α-helices, which are also found in other proteins, including eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) and nuclear cap-binding protein 80 (23Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Eukaryote-specific domains in translation initiation factors: Implications for translation regulation and evolution of the translation system.Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1172-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The MA3 domains of PDCD4 interact with eIF4A (Fig. 1A) to suppress its RNA helicase activity, thus suppressing the translation of mRNA with structured 5′UTRs (4Yang H.-S. Jansen A.P. Komar A.A. Zheng X. Merrick W.C. Costes S. Lockett S.J. Sonenberg N. Colburn N.H. The transformation suppressor Pdcd4 is a novel eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A binding protein that inhibits translation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 26-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). As shown by a yeast two-hybrid assay, the C-terminal region of PDCD4 weakly interacts with ribosomal protein L5 (RPL5) and strongly interacts with RPS13, which was confirmed by in vitro binding experiments (20Kang M.J. Ahn H.S. Lee J.Y. Matsuhashi S. Park W.Y. Up-regulation of PDCD4 in senescent human diploid fibroblasts.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The N-terminus of PDCD4 contains an unstructured sequence that undergoes multiple phosphorylation events (22Palamarchuk A. Efanov A. Maximov V. Aqeilan R.I. Croce C.M. Pekarsky Y. Akt phosphorylates and regulates Pdcd4 tumor suppressor protein.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 11282-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). PDCD4 interacts with the N-terminal domain of the coding region of the oncogenic mRNAs c- and A-myb to inhibit their translation at the elongation stage of translation (5Singh P. Wedeken L. Waters L.C. Carr M.D. Klempnauer K.H.

Additionally, the N-terminus of PDCD4 interacts with poly (A)-binding protein (PABP), which is involved in maintaining mRNA stability, and implementing effective translation initiation and termination (25Fehler O. Singh P. Haas A. Ulrich D. Müller J.P. Ohnheiser J. Klempnauer K.H.

Only full-length PABP efficiently binds to the N-terminus of PDCD4 (Fig. 1A), and the major site of this interaction is with the RNA recognition motif 1 to 2 (RRM) domains of PABP. It has also been shown that PABP activates translation termination (26Ivanov A. Mikhailova T. Eliseev B. Yeramala L. Sokolova E. Susorov D. Shuvalov A. Schaffitzel C. Alkalaeva E.

Termination of eukaryotic translation occurs when one of the three stop codons (UAA, UGA, or UAG) of mRNA reaches the ribosomal A site. This process is catalyzed by two factors: eukaryotic release factor 1 (eRF1) and eRF3 (27Merkulova T.I. Frolova L.Y. Lazar M. Camonis J. Kisselev L.L. C-terminal domains of human translation termination factors eRF1 and eRF3 mediate their in vivo interaction.FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). eRF1 contains N, M, and C domains and recognizes stop codons at the A site of the ribosome via its N domain (28Frolova L.Y.

Termination of translation in eukaryotes is governed by two interacting polypeptide chain release factors, eRF1 and eRF3.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4065-4072Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The formation of the eRF1-eRF3 complex allows for eRF1 to adopt a certain conformation that provides effective hydrolysis of peptidyl-tRNA (29Alkalaeva E.Z. Pisarev A.V. Frolova L.Y. Kisselev L.L.

In vitro reconstitution of eukaryotic translation reveals cooperativity between release factors eRF1 and eRF3.Cell. 2006; 125: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). PABP increases the binding efficiency of the human release factors to the ribosome through interactions with the N-terminal domain of eRF3a (26Ivanov A. Mikhailova T. Eliseev B. Yeramala L. Sokolova E. Susorov D. Shuvalov A. Schaffitzel C. Alkalaeva E. PABP enhances release factor recruitment and stop codon recognition during translation termination.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: 7766-7776Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Considering the direct interaction of PABP and PDCD4, we hypothesized that PDCD4 may also be involved in translation termination, which has not previously been demonstrated. To investigate the possible effect of PDCD4 on the termination of eukaryotic translation, we used a reconstituted mammalian translation system (29Alkalaeva E.Z. Pisarev A.V. Frolova L.Y. Kisselev L.L. Pestova T.V. In vitro reconstitution of eukaryotic translation reveals cooperativity between release factors eRF1 and eRF3.Cell. 2006; 125: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) as well as pretermination complexes purified from rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL). We demonstrated that human PDCD4 binds to the pretermination and termination complexes (preTC and TC, respectively) and confirmed its involvement in translation termination. We show that PDCD4 stimulates translation termination and propose a model for its function. Previously, we showed that PABP facilitates translation termination via interaction with eRF3а (26Ivanov A. Mikhailova T. Eliseev B. Yeramala L. Sokolova E. Susorov D. Shuvalov A. Schaffitzel C. Alkalaeva E. PABP enhances release factor recruitment and stop codon recognition during translation termination.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: 7766-7776Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Since PDCD4 also interacts with PABP, it may affect translation termination as well. To study the activity of PDCD4, the cDNA sequence encoding human PDCD4 was cloned into the pGEX-6p-1 vector and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells. The resulting glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged PDCD4 or PDCD4 without the tag (after removal thereof by TEV protease) was used in the experiments. The final step of translation termination is the hydrolysis of peptidyl-tRNA and the release of the nascent peptide from the ribosome. Analysis of peptide release efficiency was performed using the highly sensitive Termi-Luc approach developed recently by Susorov et al. (34Susorov D. Egri S. Korostelev A.A. Termi-Luc: A versatile assay to monitor full-protein release from ribosomes.RNA. 2020; 26: 2044-2050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PreTCs containing Nano luciferase (Fig. S1A) was fixed in the P-site by the mutant eRF1(AGQ), which is unable to hydrolyze peptidyl-tRNA to accomplish the process. These complexes were purified from the rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) by sucrose density centrifugation at the high ionic strength, which resulted in eRF1(AGQ) dissociation from the ribosome. The addition of release factors to purified preTC(NL-polyA) triggered peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis and the release of NLuc from the ribosome. This, in turn, can be detected by luminescence. To address the possible effect of PDCD4 in the complex with PABP on the translation termination process, eRF1, eRF3a, PDCD4, and PABP were added to the purified preTC(NL-polyA) simultaneously or in different combinations, and the luminescence was measured as a function of time. Clearly, PDCD4 activates translation termination in the presence of PABP and, quite unexpectedly, in its absence (Fig. 1B). Yet, the proteins act synergistically, as the joint addition of PDCD4 and PABP increased peptide release more strongly than the separate addition of proteins. To ensure that the effect of PDCD4 is not associated with the stabilization of release factors or the nonspecific prevention of their sorption in test tubes because of very low eRF concentrations, we added GST to the reaction in the presence of release factors as a negative control. This addition revealed no effect on peptide release. Importantly, we used a low concentration of the release factors, to detect the maximum stimulation of PDCD4. The titration curves of the release factors demonstrated that the efficiency of PDCD4 stimulation of peptide release depended on the concentration of release factors (Fig. S2A). Thus, the stimulation of peptide release from the terminating ribosome by PDCD4 indicates its involvement in the process of human translation termination. The expected relative in vivo levels of PDCD4 and release factors were determined by the analysis of published mass spectrometry data (Table 1) (35Kulak N.A. Pichler G. Paron I. Nagaraj N. Mann M.

In most cell lines, the level of PDCD4 was lower than that of eRF1 and eRF3; however, in HEK 293, LnCap, and Jurkat cell lines, the level of PDCD4 was comparable to or even higher than that of eRF1. Therefore, the amount of protein used may reflect physiological conditions in some cell lines or specific conditions, such as cellular stress or apoptosis.Table 1Number of protein molecules per cellCell lineseRF1eRF3aPDCD4PABP HeLaaNumber per cell × 103 (35).995,51930,18372523,1 U2OSbNumber per cell × 103 (36).140,252,91,1547,7 HEK 293ciBAQ × 104 (37).5972,44956,42436,510353,9 HELAciBAQ × 104 (37).2763,72782,3622,35086,1 GAMGciBAQ × 104 (37).3199,41438,7477,16582,5 A549ciBAQ × 104 (37).2794,71009,835,84512,3 HepG2ciBAQ × 104 (37).2377,32212,195,62774,4 JurkatciBAQ × 104 (37).931,9911,41310,81967,7 K562ciBAQ × 104 (37).1858,91211,296,52782,5 LnCapciBAQ × 104 (37).2370,11310,32886,85953,9 MCF7ciBAQ × 104 (37).3860,24067,521,89794 RKOciBAQ × 104 (37).16861068,91213072,9 U2OSciBAQ × 104 (37).4589,92997,5268,910080,5These data have been reorganized from mass spectrometry data reported previously.iBAQ is the sum of all the peptide intensities divided by the number of observable peptides of a protein.a Number per cell × 103 (35Kulak N.A.

In a complementary approach, we assayed a PDCD4 functioning in the reconstituted in vitro mammalian translation system (29Alkalaeva E.Z. Pisarev A.V. Frolova L.Y. Kisselev L.L. Pestova T.V. In vitro reconstitution of eukaryotic translation reveals cooperativity between release factors eRF1 and eRF3.Cell. 2006; 125: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This system was assembled from the purified initiation and elongation translation factors, ribosomal subunits, tRNAs, and model MVHL-mRNA (Fig. S1B). As a result, a preTC(MVHL) containing a stop codon at the A site of the ribosome and peptidyl-tRNA at the P site was formed. After purification of the preTC(MVHL) from the unbound translation factors by sucrose gradient centrifugation, it was possible to study the influence of individual proteins on the subsequent translation termination stages. During translation termination, eRF1, in the complex with eRF3, recognized the stop codon and formed a termination complex 1 (TC1); then, eRF3 hydrolyzed GTP and positioned eRF1 in the peptidyl transferase center of the ribosome, forming TC2 (Fig. 2A). This triggered peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis, and the complex passed into the posttermination stages (postTC1 and postTC2), followed by ribosome recycling. Addition of the non-hydrolysable GTP analogue, GDPCP, to the translation termination inhibited GTP hydrolysis and thus transition to the TC2 stage (Fig. 2A). The G183A mutant of eRF1 (eRF1(AGQ)), which was unable to hydrolyze peptidyl-tRNA, inhibited the transition to the postTC and freezed the termination process at the TC2 stage (Fig. 2A). Therefore, it is possible to investigate events occurring during TC formation in a great detail (38Ivanov A. Shuvalova E. Egorova T. Shuvalov A. Sokolova E. Bizyaev N. Shatsky I. Terenin I.

To study the effect of PDCD4 on the formation of termination complexes, PDCD4 along with eRF1 or eRF1(AGQ) and eRF3a was incubated with preTC(MVHL) in the presence of GTP or GDPCP, and the efficiency of TC1, TC2, and postTC1 formation was analyzed using a fluorescent toe-print assay (Figs. 2B, 3A, S3, A and B, and S4). This allowed for the detection of the position of stable ribosomal complexes on mRNA, using reverse transcription with a fluorescently labeled primer that anneals downstream of the putative ribosome-mRNA complex site. During stop codon recognition by eRF1, the ribosome undergoes a rearrangement, which manifests itself as a 1 to 2 nucleotide shift of the"

However, the signaling events that coordinate this collective migration are unclear. In this report, we address the role of phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) and attendant gene expression during wound healing. Wounding of human keratinocyte monolayers in vitro led to the rapid activation of the eIF2 kinase GCN2. We determined that deletion or pharmacological inhibition of GCN2 significantly delayed collective cell migration and wound closure. Global transcriptomic, biochemical, and cellular analyses indicated that GCN2 is necessary for maintenance of intracellular free amino acids, particularly cysteine, as well as coordination of RAC1-GTP-driven reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, lamellipodia formation, and focal adhesion dynamics following keratinocyte wounding. In vivo experiments using mice deficient for GCN2 validated the role of the eIF2 kinase during wound healing in intact skin.

These results indicate that GCN2 is critical for appropriate induction of collective cell migration and plays a critical role in coordinating the re-epithelialization of cutaneous wounds. Although healthy individuals heal cutaneous wounds without complication, there are many patients whose wounds do not resolve and require long-term care. In fact, chronic cutaneous wounds are an epidemic that are frequently associated with diabetes, aging, and poor nutrition (1Sen C.K. Human wounds and its burden: An updated compendium of estimates.Adv. Wound Care (New Rochelle). 2019; 8: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 2Frykberg R.G. Banks J.

Chronic wound healing: A review of current management and treatments.Adv. Ther. 2017; 34: 599-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Wound healing occurs in four sequential phases: hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and maturation. An important process during the proliferation phase is re-epithelialization that involves keratinocyte collective cell migration (KCCM) where sheets of connected cells migrate in concert to cover the wound bed (4Reinke J.M. Sorg H. Wound repair and regeneration.Eur. Surg. Res. 2012; 49: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). If these phases are dysregulated or do not occur in an orderly fashion, a wound will not properly heal. A chronic wound is defined as one that does not heal within 3 months. Chronic wounds are most often arrested in the inflammation phase, stalling keratinocyte migration and the subsequent sealing of the wound bed (5Rousselle P. Braye F. Dayan G. Re-epithelialization of adult skin wounds: Cellular mechanisms and therapeutic strategies.Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2019; 146: 244-365Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Because re-epithelialization is impaired in many types of chronic wounds, further research is warranted to find novel therapeutic strategies to restore and enhance epithelial barrier formation (6Pastar I. Stojadinovic O. Yin N.C. Ramirez H. Nusbaum A.G. Sawaya A. Patel S.B. Khalid L. Isseroff R.R. Tomic-Canic M. Epithelialization in wound healing: A comprehensive review.Adv. Wound Care (New Rochelle). 2014; 3: 445-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To study keratinocyte epithelial migration during wound healing, wounds are often modeled by “scratching” or removing sections of confluent sheets of differentiated keratinocytes and monitoring KCCM in two-dimensional cell culture (7Poujade M. Grasland-Mongrain E. Hertzog A. Jouanneau J. Chavrier P. Ladoux B. Buguin A. Silberzan P. Collective migration of an epithelial monolayer in response to a model wound.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 3203-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). For KCCM to occur and close a wound, cells must have physical connections that remain intact during migration and direct the restructuring of the cytoskeleton to provide a direction to their unified movement. Furthermore, KCCM requires proper preparation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) to create a substrate upon which the collective sheet can effectively migrate (8Friedl P. Gilmour D. Collective cell migration in morphogenesis, regeneration and cancer.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar). These distinct and complex tasks have been assigned to two types of cells in the KCCM: leader and follower cells (10Theveneau E. Mayor R. Collective cell migration of epithelial and mesenchymal cells.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2013; 70: 3481-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 11Theveneau E. Steventon B. Scarpa E. Garcia S. Trepat X. Streit A. Mayor R. Chase-and-run between adjacent cell populations promotes directional collective migration.Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). It is suggested that generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in keratinocytes at the leading edge of the wound is critical for directional cell migration through remodeling of the cytoskeleton to form lamellipodia and filopodia (12Stanley A. Thompson K. Hynes A. Brakebusch C. Quondamatteo F. NADPH oxidase complex-derived reactive oxygen species, the actin cytoskeleton, and Rho GTPases in cell migration.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2014; 20: 2026-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 13Ridley A.J. Life at the leading edge.Cell. 2011; 145: 1012-1022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Disruption of normal keratinocyte–keratinocyte interactions during wound formation causes a major mechanical stress within the epidermis. An important mechanism for cell remediation of environmental stresses involves phosphorylation of the α subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α-P). Multiple eIF2α kinases respond to distinct stresses, including amino acid depletion and UVB irradiation (GCN2, EIF2AK4) and accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (PERK, EIF2AK3) (14Wek R.C. Jiang H.Y. Anthony T.G. Coping with stress: eIF2 kinases and translational control.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar, 15Wek R.C. Role of eIF2alpha kinases in translational control and adaptation to cellular stress.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2018; 10a032870Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). eIF2α-P reduces delivery of initiator tRNAs to ribosomes, sharply decreasing bulk protein synthesis, which lowers nutrient consumption and facilitates reprogramming of gene expression to alleviate stress damage. Accompanying the global reduction in protein synthesis, eIF2α-P also directs preferential translation of key genes that are critical for stress remediation, such as the transcription factor ATF4, which directs adaptive reprogramming of gene expression. Therefore, eIF2α-P induces both translational and transcriptional modes of gene expression to mitigate stress damage. Because eIF2α-P responds to different stressors to induce translational control, the pathway is referred to as the integrated stress response (ISR) (16Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Novoa I. Lu P.D. Calfon M. Sadri N. Yun C. Popko B. Paules R. Stojdl D.F. Bell J.C. Hettmann T. Leiden J.M. Ron D. An integrated stress response regulates amino acid metabolism and resistance to oxidative stress.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 619-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar). It is important to emphasize that while ATF4 is central for implementation of gene expression in the ISR in response to many stresses, there are certain stresses, such as UVB irradiation in keratinocytes (17Collier A.E. Spandau D.F. Wek R.C. Translational control of a human CDKN1A mRNA splice variant regulates the fate of UVB-irradiated human keratinocytes.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2018; 29: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 18Collier A.E. Wek R.C. Spandau D.F.

Dermatol. 2015; 135: 2502-2511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), where the adaptive functions of the ISR occur independent of ATF4 through other target genes. Therefore, GCN2 in the ISR is suggested to interface with multiple effector target genes to tailor adaptation to different stresses. Along with activation of eIF2α kinases, the magnitude and duration of eIF2α-P and the accompanying translation control are regulated by type 1 protein phosphatase via two targeting subunits, CReP (PPP1R15B) or GADD34 (PPP1R15A) (15Wek R.C. Role of eIF2alpha kinases in translational control and adaptation to cellular stress.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2018; 10a032870Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 19Marciniak S.J. Ron D. Endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling in disease.Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 1133-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). While CReP is suggested to be constitutively expressed, GADD34 is itself induced by the ISR, creating a negative feedback loop that serves to lower eIF2α-P and restore protein synthesis upon resolution of stress damage. Given the important roles for GCN2 in skin homeostasis and the roles of eIF2α-P in managing environmental stress, we addressed the role that GCN2 and the ISR play in KCCM during re-epithelization of cutaneous wounds. Using a combination of biochemical, genetic, and cellular approaches in cell culture and mouse model systems, we show that GCN2 and its attendant gene expression are important for appropriate management of amino acids, ROS generation, lamellipodia formation, and focal adhesion dynamics that are central for KCCM and optimal wound healing. The use of NTERT human keratinocytes is a well-established model to study skin biology and KCCM (17Collier A.E. Spandau D.F. Wek R.C.

Upon uniform scratch wounding of the NTERT cells with a WoundMaker tool, sequential time-lapse images were taken at regular intervals to show that the differentiated keratinocytes move forward into the wounded space as a sheet of cells (Fig. 1, A and B). These results confirm that our model recapitulates KCCM (23Grada A. Otero-Vinas M. Prieto-Castrillo F. Obagi Z. Falanga V.

Dermatol. 2017; 137: e11-e16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Given that complete closure of the wound can occur within 9 h, this result indicates that KCCM was a primary result of migration and not proliferation since NTERT keratinocytes have a doubling time of 24 to 30 h in vitro (24Papini S. Cecchetti D. Campani D. Fitzgerald W. Grivel J.C. Chen S. Margolis L. Revoltella R.P.

We addressed the role of GCN2 in KCCM by using CRISPR/CAS9 and guide RNAs targeting exon 2, which encodes the N-terminal RWD domain of GCN2, or exon 12, a region encoding the critical lysine reside in the kinase domain (Fig. 1C). The guide RNAs edited the GCN2 (EIF2AK4) loci, creating a pool of knockout (KO) keratinocytes effectively lacking GCN2 protein expression (GCN2KO) (Fig. 1D). Early passage GCN2KO cells were used in all experiments. Using wound healing assays, we observed a marked reduction in wound closure of the GCN2KO cells compared with the WT NTERT controls (Fig. 1F). We confirmed these results using two different primary normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHK) that were isolated from foreskin tissue from separate donors (25Kuhn C. Hurwitz S.A. Kumar M.G. Cotton J. Spandau D.F. Activation of the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor promotes the survival of human keratinocytes following ultraviolet B irradiation.Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The sgRNA targeting exon 12 was used to delete GCN2 in NHKs derived from two separate individuals (Fig. 1E), and analysis of wound closure in both donor GCN2KO cells showed delayed closure (Fig. 1G). We conclude that GCN2 facilitates KCCM in during wounding. To determine the molecular consequences of depleting GCN2 in the initiation of KCCM following wounding, we developed a technique called high-density wounding (HDW). This method enhances the numbers of keratinocytes in proximity to the scratch wound using tips attached to a multichannel pipettor to make parallel scratch wounds on tissue culture plates (Fig. S1). Using constant pressure, the tips were drawn across the well once in both horizontal and then vertical directions. The HDW method created a regularly spaced grid of wounds spaced 5 mm apart, enriching the number of leader cells to organize the initiation of KCCM. Given that measurable progression of the leading front can be detected between 2 and 4 h post wounding, we collected cell lysates at intervals from 5 min to 4 h post wounding to capture the initiation, amplitude, and duration of the ISR. Control WT and GCN2KO NTERT cells were differentiated into epithelial sheets for 48 h before being subjected to HDW. Immunoblot analyses of WT NTERT lysates revealed that wounding leads to activation of GCN2, as measured by GCN2 phosphorylation, within 30 min to 1 h post injury (Fig. 2A). Of importance, the WT NTERT cells showed enhanced eIF2α-P in the unwounded cells compared with GCN2KO, and these levels were sustained in the WT cells throughout the wounding time course (Fig. 2B). By comparison, eIF2α-P was reduced in the unwounded GCN2KO cells and was sharply depleted after 1 h of wounding. These results indicate that activated GCN2 during wounding is necessary to sustain eIF2α-P levels and is critical for KCCM. ATF4 has a prominent role in the implementation of the ISR during many environmental insults. ATF4 expression was increased following wounding; however, elevated ATF4 protein levels occurred independent of the functional status of GCN2 (Fig. 2B). While eIF2α-P is typically important for translation induction of ATF4, there are other reported mechanisms involving changes in ATF4 mRNA synthesis and turnover and ATF4 protein stability, which significantly contribute to enhanced ATF4 protein levels, and some these processes involve ancillary pathways (26Park Y. Reyna-Neyra A. Philippe L.

The role of ATF4 in the wound closure will be furthered addressed below. ISR-directed translation is controlled in part by negative feedback through induced expression of GADD34 and CReP. The increase in GADD34 and CReP expression following wounding was similar in both WT and GCN2KO keratinocytes. These results suggest that loss of GCN2 combined with increased GADD34 and CReP levels contributes to reduced eIF2α-P in wounded GCN2KO cells. Bulk protein synthesis in WT and GCN2KO NTERT cells subjected to up to 6 h HDW was measured using puromycin labeling. There was about a twofold increase in protein synthesis in unwounded GCN2KO cells compared with control WT (Fig. 2C and representative blot in Fig. S2). Upon wounding, there was up to a threefold increase in global translation in GCN2KO keratinocytes after 4 to 6 h of HDW compared with WT cells. These results support the model that GCN2 and associated eIF2α-P contribute to lowered global protein synthesis following wounding. Small-molecule inhibitors are frequently used as modulators of the ISR. For example, GCN2iB is a potent inhibitor of GCN2 (33Nakamura A. Nambu T. Ebara S. Hasegawa Y. Toyoshima K. Tsuchiya Y. Tomita D. Fujimoto J. Kurasawa O. Takahara C. Ando A. Nishigaki R. Satomi Y. Hata A. Hara T. Inhibition of GCN2 sensitizes ASNS-low cancer cells to asparaginase by disrupting the amino acid response.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: E7776-E7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and guanabenz interferes with GADD34-directed dephosphorylation of eIF2α-P resulting in ISR activation (34Tsaytler P. Harding H.P. Ron D. Bertolotti A. Selective inhibition of a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 restores proteostasis.Science. 2011; 332: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). WT and GCN2KO NTERT cells were measured in the wound healing assay and treated with vehicle, GCN2iB, or guanabenz prior to and during the wounding assay. GCN2iB impaired wound closure of WT NTERT cells, whereas guanabenz compensated for the loss of GCN2 and restored KCCM in GCN2KO cells (Fig. 2D). Treatment of WT NTERT cells with guanabenz did not alter wound closure kinetics (data not shown). Similarly, treatment of GCN2KO cells with GCN2iB did not change KCCM following wounding (data not shown). These results further support the model that eIF2α-P by GCN2 is critical for wound closure. It is curious that wounding induced ATF4 expression in both WT and GCN2KO NTERT cells as previously we demonstrated that UVB-induced activation of GCN2 in NTERT keratinocytes does not lead to increased ATF4 expression (17Collier A.E. Spandau D.F. Wek R.C. Translational control of a human CDKN1A mRNA splice variant regulates the fate of UVB-irradiated human keratinocytes.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2018; 29: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 18Collier A.E. Wek R.C. Spandau D.F.

Dermatol. 2015; 135: 2502-2511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We used CRISPR/CAS9 to delete an 800 bp region of ATF4 exon 4. As expected, ATF4 protein as measured by immunoblot was induced in WT NTERT cells upon exposure to thapsigargin, a potent ER stress agent, whereas there was minimal ATF4 in the knockout cells (Fig. S3A). Given this validation of the ATF4KO cell line, WT and ATF4KO NTERT cells were then tested in the wound healing assay. There was no difference in wound closure between WT and ATF4KO cells (Fig. S3B). However, treatment of the ATF4KO cells with GCN2iB delayed wound closure (Fig. S3C), showing that the knockout cells still required the GCN2-directed ISR for KCCM. These results are consistent with the results that induced ATF4 expression in NTERT cells is independent of GCN2 and suggests other target(s) for GCN2-directed wound closure in keratinocytes. To delineate GCN2-dependent gene expression pathways in KCCM, we pursued an unbiased transcriptome analysis. WT and GCN2KO NTERT cells were subjected to HDW or left unwounded, and RNA was isolated and analyzed by RNA-seq (Table S1). DESeq2 was used to determine differentially expressed (DE) genes among different groups (35Love M.I. Huber W. Anders S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2.Genome Biol. 2014; 15: 550Crossref PubMed Scopus (23337) Google Scholar). Genes with log2fold change of ≥±1 and p-adjusted value of ≤0.05 were considered significant for further analyses. Expression of 1263 genes was significantly enhanced, and 1222 genes were significantly lowered upon deletion of GCN2 in NTERTs compared with unwounded WT NTERTs cells (Fig. 3A). With HDW, 1070 gene transcripts showed a significant increase, while 1209 were reduced in GCN2KO compared with WT (Fig. 3B). In WT NTERT cells, 400 gene transcripts showed a significant increase upon HDW, while 230 were lowered (Fig. 3C). By comparison, in GCN2KO subjected to HDW cells, only 73 gene transcripts showed a significant increase while 23 were significantly decreased, indicating that loss of GCN2 sharply diminishes the plasticity of mRNA expression upon wounding (Fig. 3D). These results show that wounding triggers significant changes in the transcriptome in WT keratinocytes and that loss of GCN2 significantly altered mRNA expression in both unwounded and wounded cells. To distinguish which biological networks were affected by GCN2, we conducted pathway enrichment analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software from Qiagen. HDW in the WT keratinocytes induced gene expression in wounding, cellular migration, cytoskeletal reorganization, and inflammation (Fig. 3E). By comparison, there were negative activation scores for these biological functions in wounded GCN2KO cells. Of importance, HDW in the GCN2KO cells enhanced genes involved in generation of ROS. Next, we used the IPA Upstream Regulator Analysis tool to predict which transcriptional regulators were disrupted with deletion of GCN2 (Fig. 3F). There were increased activation scores for genes regulated by the ATF transcription factor family (ATF2, ATF3, ATF4) and reduced activation scores for genes regulated by the CEBP transcription factor family (CEBPA, CEBPB, CEBPD). Genes associated with wound-associated cytokine signaling (PDGFBB, TGFB1, IL1B) and inflammatory pathways (RELA, NFKB complex, IL6, STAT3) also had negative activation Z-scores in the GCN2KO cells. It is also noteworthy that genes associated with RAC1 and hydrogen peroxide formation had significant negative activation Z-scores in GCN2KO cells (Fig. 3F). These results suggest that GCN2 is critical for appropriate programming of multiple transcription networks affecting diverse cell functions, including stress responses, inflammation, and ROS generation. We also addressed differences in gene expression in unwounded WT and GCN2KO keratinocytes that could alter the capacity for wound healing prior to any wound-induced stress. In the unwounded GCN2KO cells, there was significant increased expression of genes involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR) compared with unwounded WT cells (Fig. 3G). This result may reflect the demand placed upon the ER in GCN2KO cells to synthesize and correctly fold proteins in a cellular state with reduced eIF2α-P and translational control. Analysis of amino acid transporters in the unwounded state revealed upregulation of cystine cotransporter genes, SLC7A11 (xCT) and SLC3A2, in the GCN2KO cells versus WT (Fig. 3G). CHAC1, an mRNA encoding an enzyme that converts cytosolic glutathione into free cysteine, was also sharply enhanced in the GCN2-deficient keratinocytes. Import of cystine and maintenance of free cellular cysteine is critical for glutathione production and ROS management (36Koppula P. Zhang Y. Zhuang L. Gan B. Amino acid transporter SLC7A11/xCT at the crossroads of regulating redox homeostasis and nutrient dependency of cancer.Cancer Commun. (Lond.). 2018; 38: 12Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We also assessed changes in HDW upon loss of GCN2 for gene transcripts involved in KCCM, including ECM, cytoskeletal dynamics, and ROS (Fig. 3H). In a comparison between HDW GCN2KO versus WT keratinocytes, there were significant reductions in the levels of gene transcripts encoding key basement membrane proteins, COL4A1, COL18A1, laminin alpha chains, as well as many matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Expressions of key integrins ITGA4, ITGB5, ITGB6, and interacting transmembrane genes SEMA4A and PLXND1 were also sharply lowered with deletion of GCN2, as were expressions of genes involved in RAC1 signaling. RAC1 coordinates ROS production, which is required for actin cytoskeletal rearrangements necessary for formation of leading edge lamellipodia. Among genes involved in ROS management in the GCN2KO cells, expressions of NRF2 target genes, HMOX1, ATF3, and NQO1, were significantly increased, suggesting an adaptive response against active oxidative stress occurred. However, other genes known to contribute to ROS generation, such ALOX5 and CEBPD, were downregulated in GCN2KO cells. These results underscore that GCN2 is critical for appropriate management of multiple critical transcriptome networks involved in KCCM. These networks are suggested to be directed by GCN2, ensuring the ability of these cells to implement key phases in wound healing. Given the canonical role for GCN2 as a monitor of amino acid availability via uncharged tRNAs (37Baird T.D. Wek R.C. Eukaryotic initiation factor 2 phosphorylation and translational control in metabolism.Adv. Nutr. 2012; 3: 307-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), we explored whether amino acid deprivation coincided with activation of GCN2 following wounding. Using capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry to profile amino acid levels during HDW, we observed that free cysteine levels in cells decreased with wounding and were further reduced in GCN2KO cells when translation is not appropriately regulated (Figs. 4A and S4). Reduced cysteine upon wounding was also corroborated by the analysis of aminoacylated tRNACys in WT and GCN2KO cells following wounding. There were increased levels of uncharged tRNACys in WT cells subjected to wounding, with elevated levels in both unwounded and wounded GCN2KO cells (Fig. 4, B and C). These results suggest that wounding can enhance levels of uncharged tRNAs that can activate GCN2. We next addressed the roles that GCN2 plays in ensuring appropriate cysteine levels in wounded keratinocytes. First as noted above, there is elevated protein synthesis in GCN2KO that wa"

Although most cells express FASN at low levels, it is upregulated in cancers of the breast, prostate, and liver, among others, and is required during the replication of many viruses, such as dengue virus, hepatitis C, HIV-1, hepatitis B, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, among others. The precise role of FASN in disease pathogenesis is poorly understood, and whether de novo FA synthesis contributes to host or viral protein acylation has been traditionally difficult to study. Here, we describe a cell-permeable and click chemistry–compatible alkynyl acetate analog (alkynyl acetic acid or 5-hexynoic acid [Alk-4]) that functions as a reporter of FASN-dependent protein acylation. In an FASN-dependent manner, Alk-4 selectively labels the cellular protein interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 at its known palmitoylation sites, a process that is essential for the antiviral activity of the protein, and the HIV-1 matrix protein at its known myristoylation site, a process that is required for membrane targeting and particle assembly. Alk-4 metabolic labeling also enabled biotin-based purification and identification of more than 200 FASN-dependent acylated cellular proteins.

Thus, Alk-4 is a useful bioorthogonal tool to selectively probe FASN-mediated protein acylation in normal and diseased states. Long-chain fatty acids (FAs) are essential components of lipid bilayers, are used to store energy liberated by β-oxidation, and are covalently attached to proteins to increase hydrophobicity and regulate subcellular localization (1Resh M.D. Fatty acylation of proteins: The long and the short of it.Prog. Lipid Res. 2016; 63: 120-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, long-chain FAs can be obtained exogenously through dietary sources or endogenously via de novo FA biosynthesis (2Suburu J. Gu Z. Chen H. Chen W. Zhang H. Chen Y.Q. Fatty acid metabolism: Implications for diet, genetic variation, and disease.Food Biosci. 2013; 4: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Mammalian fatty acid synthase (FASN) is a 272 kDa cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes the complete de novo synthesis of palmitate from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA. The final product, palmitic acid (16:0), is then released from the thioesterase domain of FASN and can then be metabolized by β-oxidation into myristic acid in the mitochondria (14:0), elongated to other long-chain FA such as stearic acid, or elongated and desaturated into oleic acid in the endoplasmic reticulum (3Liu H. Liu J.Y. Wu X. Zhang J.T. Biochemistry, molecular biology, and pharmacology of fatty acid synthase, an emerging therapeutic target and diagnosis/prognosis marker.Int. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2010; 1: 69-89PubMed Google Scholar). This process is aided by acyl-CoA synthetases, which activate the free FAs produced by FASN to their coenzyme-A linked thioesters. FAs synthesized de novo or acquired through dietary sources can be covalently attached to proteins by acyltransferases such as palmitoyl transferases and N-myristoyl transferases in a process called fatty acylation (1Resh M.D. Fatty acylation of proteins: The long and the short of it.Prog. Lipid Res. 2016; 63: 120-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). FASN expression is highly regulated in cells, and its expression can change dramatically in response to stresses, such as starvation, lactation, or pathological states (3Liu H. Liu J.Y. Wu X.

The contributions of de novo–synthesized FA to post-translational modifications of viral and host proteins remain understudied. Identification of protein acylation has been challenging because of the lack of antibodies against lipid modifications and inefficiencies of standard mass spectrometry techniques to identify acylated proteins (14Hang H.C. Linder M.E. Exploring protein lipidation with chemical biology.Chem. Rev. 2011; 111: 6341-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). While protein myristoylation site prediction is facilitated by a consensus sequence motif on nearly all myristoylated proteins (Met-Gly-XXX-Ser/Thr) (1Resh M.D. Fatty acylation of proteins: The long and the short of it.Prog. Lipid Res. 2016; 63: 120-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), protein palmitoylation site prediction remains challenging because of the lack of a consensus sequence (15Rodenburg R.N.P.

Although very useful, palmitate and myristate analogs only measure the acylation state of proteins modified by the exogenous chemical reporters. Given the critical role of FASN-dependent de novo–synthesized FAs in cancer, metabolic disorders, and viral replication, we posit that a bioorthogonal reporter of FASN-dependent protein acylation will facilitate a better understanding of the contributions of FASN-dependent protein fatty acylation to protein function, protein localization, and FASN-mediated pathogenesis. Here, we demonstrate the utility of alkynyl acetic acid or 5-hexynoic acid (Alk-4), a cell-permeable and click chemistry compound that labels proteins acylated by products of FASN-mediated de novo FA biosynthesis. Bioorthogonal reporters such as alkynyl palmitate (alkynyl palmitic acid or 15-hexadecynoic acid [Alk-16]) and alkynyl myristic acid or 13-tetradecynoic acid (Alk-12) are substrates of palmitoyltransferase and myristoyltransferase activity that are often used to identify palmitoylated and myristoylated proteins (21Charron G.

Alk-12 and Alk-16 are exogenous FA analogs that mimic the end product of FASN activity (palmitate) or the β-oxidation product of palmitate (myristate) and thus cannot be used to determine if de novo–synthesized FAs can be incorporated onto protein acylation sites. We hypothesized that a cell-permeable and bioorthogonal mimic of a putative FASN substrate, 5-hexynoate (termed Alk-4 here) (24Yang Y.Y. Ascano J.M. Hang H.C. Bioorthogonal chemical reporters for monitoring protein acetylation.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132: 3640-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), could be used to study the contributions of FASN-mediated de novo FA synthesis to protein acylation (Fig. 1, A and B). To determine whether Alk-4 selectively labels palmitoylated proteins, we tested whether a known palmitoylated protein, interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), was labeled upon a 24-h treatment of cells with alkynyl acetate analogs of different carbon chain lengths, 4-pentynoic acid (Alk-3) and Alk-4, in comparison with the well-established palmitoylation reporter Alk-16 (Fig. 1, A and B). Alk-16 robustly labeled IFITM3 as detected by click chemistry tagging of immunoprecipitated IFITM3 with azidorhodamine and fluorescence gel scanning. Alk-4 also successfully labeled IFITM3, whereas Alk-3 showed minimal labeling (Fig. 2A). Next, we tested whether Alk-4 labeling of IFITM3 occurred on its known palmitoylated cysteines (22Yount J.S. Moltedo B. Yang Y.Y. Charron G. Moran T.M. López C.B. Hang H.C. Palmitoylome profiling reveals S-palmitoylation-dependent antiviral activity of IFITM3.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 610-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). A triple cysteine to alanine palmitoylation-deficient mutant of IFITM3 (termed PalmΔ) was not labeled by either Alk-16 or Alk-4 (Fig. 2B). Hydroxylamine treatment is known to cleave the palmitoyl–thioester linkage (25Roth A.F. Wan J. Green W.N. Yates 3rd, J.R. Davis N.G. Proteomic identification of palmitoylated proteins.Methods. 2006; 40: 135Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and hydroxylamine treatment removed labeling of IFITM3 by Alk-4 (Fig. 2C). To further test the ability of Alk-4 to label palmitoylated proteins, we examined whether the tetraspanin CD9, which has six palmitoylated cysteines, was also labeled by Alk-4. Similar to IFITM3, CD9 was labeled by Alk-4, whereas a mutant CD9 in which its palmitoylated cysteines were mutated to alanine (termed CD9-PalmΔ) was not labeled (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that Alk-4 is metabolized into a click chemistry–functionalized FA adduct that is specifically incorporated onto protein palmitoylation sites.Figure 2FASN-dependent incorporation of Alk-4 at known protein palmitoylation sites. A, immunoprecipitated HA-IFITM3 from HA-IFITM3 transfected 293Ts followed by rhodamine azide click reaction revealed detectable labeling by Alk-16 and Alk-4 and minimal labeling by Alk-3. B, a triple cysteine to alanine IFITM3 mutant (PalmΔ) was not labeled by Alk-4, suggesting that Alk-4 labeling of IFITM3 occurred on known palmitoylated cysteines. C, Alk-4 labeling of IFITM3 is removed by hydroxylamine treatment, which removes palmitate groups from S-palmitoylated proteins. D, Alk-4 labeled CD9, whereas a mutant where its six palmitoylated cysteines were mutated to alanine was not labeled, revealing that Alk-4 labels CD9 on known palmitoylated cysteines (∗ indicates 25 kDa fluorescent molecular weight standard bleed through). E, DHHC palmitoyltransferase overexpression increased Alk-4 labeling of IFITM3, whereas a dominant negative mutant partially decreased labeling, suggesting that Alk-4 is metabolized into a long-chain fatty acid utilized by DHHC palmitoyltransferases. F, to test the requirement of FASN for labeling of endogenous IFITM3 in cells treated with IFNβ, HAP1 WT and FASN KO cells were labeled with Alk-4. Western blotting was done to confirm FASN levels in WT and KO cells and expression of endogenous IFITM3 on IFNβ treatment. G, Alk-4 labeling of endogenous IFITM3 was only observed in WT cells and not detected in FASN KO cells, indicating that FASN contributes to palmitoylation of IFITM3. H, IFNβ was significantly less effective at inhibiting influenza virus strain H1N1 infection in FASN KO cells (∗p = 0.0002), indicating that FASN is required for mounting of an effective IFNβ immune response against influenza virus, possibly through provision for fatty acyl groups for activation of IFITM3.

Given the selectivity of the DHHC palmitoyltransferases for long-chain FAs, we sought to determine whether labeling of IFITM3 by Alk-4 was affected by DHHC7 overexpression, which was previously shown to be among the enzymes that can catalyze IFITM3 palmitoylation (33McMichael T.M. Zhang L. Chemudupati M. Hach J.C. Kenney A.D. Hang H.C. Yount J.S.

In cells incubated with Alk-4, DHHC7 overexpression increased IFITM3 labeling, whereas overexpression of a dominant negative DHHC7 mutant decreased IFITM3 labeling (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that Alk-4 is metabolized into a long-chain FA that can be used as a substrate by DHHC palmitoyltransferases for protein palmitoylation. We have previously shown that IFITM3 palmitoylation is required for its antiviral activity against influenza virus infection (22Yount J.S. Moltedo B. Yang Y.Y. Charron G. Moran T.M. López C.B.

To determine if FASN-mediated de novo FA biosynthesis contributes to an interferon beta (IFNβ)–regulated IFITM3-mediated antiviral response, we measured endogenous IFITM3 labeling by Alk-4 in WT and FASN KO HAP1 cells. As expected, IFNβ induced endogenous IFITM3 expression, and IFITM3 upregulation was independent of FASN expression (Fig. 2F). In WT cells, Alk-4 treatment resulted in robust endogenous IFITM3 labeling that was absent in FASN-deficient cells (Fig. 2G). Thus, we show for the first time that FASN contributes to the palmitoylation of endogenous IFITM3. Owing to the observations that IFITM3 is required for an effective IFNβ-mediated anti-influenza response (33McMichael T.M. Zhang L. Chemudupati M. Hach J.C. Kenney A.D. Hang H.C. Yount J.S.

Chem. 2017; 292: 21517-21526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and that FASN is required for Alk-4–mediated IFITM3 palmitoylation (Fig. 2G), we sought to determine the effect of FASN expression on IFNβ-mediated inhibition of influenza virus infection. In the absence of IFNβ, FASN expression had no effect on influenza infection (Fig. 2H). However, IFNβ-mediated inhibition of influenza virus infection was significantly decreased in the absence of FASN expression (Fig. 2H), suggesting that FASN-dependent palmitate synthesis likely contributes to the palmitoylation-dependent antiviral activity of IFITM3. Acetyl-CoA is condensed with malonyl-CoA and elongated by FASN to generate palmitate for protein palmitoylation. To generate myristoyl-CoA for myristoylation, palmitate is activated to palmitoyl-CoA by palmitoyl-CoA synthetase, which is then β-oxidized to myristoyl-CoA before it is covalently attached to glycine residues by N-myristoyl transferases (1Resh M.D. Fatty acylation of proteins: The long and the short of it.Prog. Lipid Res. 2016; 63: 120-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 35Farazi T.A. Waksman G. Gordon J.I. The biology and enzymology of protein N-myristoylation.J. Biol.

To determine if Alk-4 is metabolized into an FA analog that can selectively label myristoylated proteins, we tested whether a known myristoylated protein, HIV-1 matrix (MA) protein, was labeled upon a 24-h incubation with Alk-4. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were transfected with Flag-tagged HIV-1 MA or the myristoylation-deficient MA-G2A mutant (MA-G2A) and treated with Alk-4 or Alk-12 (an established chemical reporter of myristoylation). Immunoprecipitation of Flag-tagged MA and subsequent click reaction with azidorhodamine revealed labeling of HIV-1 MA in cells incubated with Alk-4 or Alk-12 (Fig. 3A). The G2A-MA Gag protein, which cannot be myristoylated, was not labeled by Alk-4, indicating myristoylation site–specific labeling of HIV-1 MA protein by Alk-4. Treatment of cells with Fasnall (9Kulkarni M.M. Ratcliff A.N. Bhat M. Alwarawrah Y. Hughes P. Arcos J. Loiselle D. Torrelles J.B. Funderburg N.T. Haystead T.A. Kwiek J.J.

As a control, Fasnall treatment did not disrupt HIV-1 MA protein labeling by Alk-12. To confirm the selective labeling of HIV-1 MA protein that we observed with fluorescence-based click reactions, cell lysates were instead reacted with biotin azide. Biotin-conjugated proteins were precipitated with streptavidin agarose, and bound proteins were released with sodium dithionite, which cleaves a diazo linker within the azidobiotin molecule, enabling selective elution of Alk-4 labeled proteins. Eluents were probed for the MA-Flag proteins, and, in the presence of Alk-4, HIV-1 MA protein was recovered. HIV-1 MA protein recovery was diminished both when a myristoylation-deficient HIV-1 MA protein variant was transfected (MA-G2A) (Fig. 3B) and when FASN was inhibited by Fasnall. These results indicate that Alk-4 is metabolized into an FA adduct that is specifically incorporated onto protein myristoylation sites in an FASN-dependent manner, and that can be detected by multiple labeling modalities. To test the utility of Alk-4 as a global indicator of FASN-dependent protein acylation, we incubated the human fibroblast-like cell line HAP1 or an FASN-deficient clone of the HAP1 cells with Alk-4 or a vehicle control (dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]). Following metabolic labeling of HAP1 cells with Alk-4, cell lysates were reacted with azidobiotin, and labeled proteins were precipitated as described in Figure 3B. Eluents were then probed for proteins known to be palmitoylated (calnexin) (37Lakkaraju A.K.K. Abrami L. Lemmin T. Blaskovic S. Kunz B. Kihara A. Dal Peraro M. Van Der Goot F.G.

In WT HAP1 cells, Alk-4 labeling recovered both calnexin and Src, whereas in FASN-deficient cells, incubation with Alk-4 did not enable calnexin or Src recovery (Fig. 4A). To determine the breadth of proteins recovered from cells incubated with Alk-4, we next used mass spectrometry to identify biotinylated proteins from HAP1 cells with or without Alk-4 and with or without FASN. FASN was only recovered from WT HAP1 cells incubated with Alk-4, consistent with the acyl intermediates formed between FASN and the elongating FA chain (40Wakil S.J. Fatty acid synthase, a proficient multifunctional enzyme.Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4523-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). In total, Alk-4 labeling enabled recovery of 264 proteins in an Alk-4- and FASN-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). Of these, 77% (203) have previously been identified in at least one palmitoyl proteome, or they have been experimentally validated to be palmitoylated. These included well-characterized palmitoylation substrates, such as guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein), alpha inhibiting 1 (GNA1I) and catenin beta-1 (CTNB1) (Fig. 4C, Tables S1 and S3). Of the remaining proteins that were purified, 17% were predicted to be palmitoylated (e.g., SAM domain and HD domain containing protein 1 [SAMHD1]) and 3% were predicted to be myristoylated (e.g., ribosomal protein S6 kinase alpha [KS6A1]) (41Xie Y.

Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 10 (USP10) is a deubiquitinase that plays a major role in cancer development and progression. However, the function of USP10 in arterial restenosis is unknown. Herein, USP10 expression was detected in mouse arteries and increased after carotid ligation. The inhibition of USP10 exhibited thinner neointima in the model of mouse carotid ligation. In vitro data showed that USP10 deficiency reduced proliferation and migration of rat thoracic aorta smooth muscle cells (A7r5) and human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). Mechanically, USP10 can bind to Skp2 and stabilize its protein level by removing polyubiquitin on Skp2 in the cytoplasm. The overexpression of Skp2 abrogated cell cycle arrest induced by USP10 inhibition. Overall, the current study demonstrated that USP10 is involved in vascular remodeling by directly promoting VSMC proliferation and migration via stabilization of Skp2 protein expression."

https://openalex.org/W3203064129,"Autophagy is a major cellular quality control system responsible for the degradation of proteins and organelles in response to stress and damage to maintain homeostasis. Ubiquitination of autophagy-related proteins or regulatory components is important for the precise control of autophagy pathways. Here, we show that the deubiquitinase ubiquitin-specific protease 11 (USP11) restricts autophagy and that KO of USP11 in mammalian cells results in elevated autophagic flux. We also demonstrate that depletion of the USP11 homolog H34C03.2 in Caenorhabditis elegans triggers hyperactivation of autophagy and protects the animals against human amyloid-β peptide 42 aggregation-induced paralysis. USP11 coprecipitated with autophagy-specific class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex I and limited its interaction with nuclear receptor-binding factor 2, thus decreasing lipid kinase activity of class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex I and subsequent recruitment of effectors such as WD-repeat domain phosphoinositide-interacting proteins to the autophagosomal membrane. Accordingly, more WD-repeat domain phosphoinositide-interacting protein 2 puncta accumulated in USP11 KO cells. In addition, USP11 interacts with and stabilizes the serine/threonine kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin, thereby further contributing to the regulation of autophagy induction. Taken together, our data suggested that USP11 impinges on the autophagy pathway at multiple sites and that inhibiting USP11 alleviates symptoms of proteotoxicity, which is a major hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases."

https://openalex.org/W3204819217,"I merge publicly available data on CO 2 emissions, with patterns of human movement, to analyze the anticipated effects of human migration on the abilities of nations to attain 2030 UNFCCC CO 2 emission targets. I do so at both global (175 countries) and national (Canada and the USA) scales. The analyses reveal that mean per capita CO 2 emissions are nearly three times higher in countries with net immigration than in countries with net emigration. Those differences project a cumulative migration-induced annual increase in global emissions of approximately 1.7 billion tonnes. For Canada and the United States, the projected total emissions attributable to migration from 2021 to 2030 vary between 0.7 and 0.9 billion tonnes. Although staggering, the annual and total emissions represent a small fraction of current global emissions totalling 36 billion tonnes per annum. Even so, the projected decadal immigration of nearly 4 million humans to Canada, and 10 million to the USA, represent significant additional challenges in reducing CO 2 emissions. The challenges pale in comparison with poor nations that are minor contributors to climate change. Such nations face the incomprehensible burden of improving the quality of their citizens’ lives without increasing global CO 2 emissions. National and international strategies aimed at lowering emissions must thus acknowledge, and cooperatively address, consumptive inequities and expected increases in human population size and migration."

This study aimed to identify which pre-existing structural factors facilitated better outcomes despite different starting points, as understanding of the relative impact of structural aspects should facilitate achieving optimal forward progress.Desk study, based on selecting and collecting a range of measures for 48 representative characteristics of 42 countries' demography, society, health system, and policy-making profiles, matched to three pandemic time points. Different analytic approaches were employed including correlation, multiple regression, and cluster analysis in order to seek triangulation.Population structure (except country size), and volume and nature of health resources, had only minor links to Covid impact. Depth of social inequality, poverty, population age structure, and strength of preventive health measures unexpectedly had no moderating effect. Strongest measured influences were population current enrolment in tertiary education, and country leaders' strength of seeking scientific evidence. The representativeness, and by interpretation the empathy, of government leadership also had positive effects.Strength of therapeutic health system, and indeed of preventive health services, surprisingly had little correlation with impact of the pandemic in the first nine months measured in death- or case-rates. However, specific political system features, including proportional representation electoral systems, and absence of a strong single party majority, were consistent features of the most successful national responses, as was being of a small or moderate population size, and with tertiary education facilitated. It can be interpreted that the way a country was lead, and whether leadership sought evidence and shared the reasoning behind resultant policies, had notable effects. This has significant implications within health system development and in promoting the population's health."

In a cross-sectional design, we aimed to estimate the rates and correlates of anxiety and depression, examine how specific worries correlated with general anxiety and depression, and synthesize themes of ""the most difficult experiences"" shared by the respondents. We collected data through an on-line survey in a convenience sample of 1,293 adult residents of Philadelphia, PA between April 17 and July 3, 2020, inquiring about symptoms of anxiety and depression (via the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), specific worries, open-ended narratives of ""the most difficult experiences"" (coded into themes), demographics, perceived sources of support, and general health. Anxiety was evident among 30 to 40% of participants and depression-about 10%. Factor analysis revealed two distinct, yet inter-related clusters of specific worries related to mood disorders: concern about ""hardships"" and ""fear of infection"". Regression analyses revealed that anxiety, depression, and fear of infection, but not concern about hardships, worsened over the course of the epidemic. ""The most difficult experiences"" characterized by loss of income, poor health of self or others, uncertainty, death of a relative or a friend, and struggle accessing food were each associated with some of the measures of worries and mood disorders. Respondents who believed they could rely on support of close personal network fared better psychologically than those who reported relying primarily on government and social services organizations. Thematic analysis revealed complex perceptions of the pandemic by the participants, giving clues to both positive and negative experiences that may have affected how they coped. Despite concerns about external validity, our observations are concordant with emerging evidence of psychological toll of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures employed to mitigate risk of infection."
https://openalex.org/W3203530610,"U.S. military Service members have consistently smoked more than the general population and the prevalence of smoking is even higher among U.S. veterans. Our study examined cigarette smoking patterns among Service members before and after military separation to better understand the disproportionate rate of smoking among veterans. Data from the Millennium Cohort Study were used. All study participants were in the military at baseline and some transitioned from the military to civilian life during the observation period. We investigated any impact of military separation on smoking, as well as other potential risk factors for smoking. Overall, we observed higher smoking prevalence among veterans than Service members. Additionally, we found that Service members smoked more while approaching their separation from the military. Longitudinal analysis revealed military separation was not a risk factor for smoking, as we had hypothesized. Baseline smoking was the most influential predictor of current smoking status. Other significant factors included alcohol consumption, life stressors, and mental health conditions, among others. Military separation was not a risk factor for smoking. However, Service members in the process of transitioning out of the military, as well as high alcohol consumers and Service members with mental health conditions, may be at higher risk of smoking. Including smoking prevention/cessation programs in pre-separation counseling sessions and developing smoking screening and cessation programs targeting specific high-risk subgroups may reduce smoking among Service members and veterans."
https://openalex.org/W3204927497,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare, aggressive, and incurable cancer arising from the mesothelial lining of the pleura, with few available treatment options. We recently reported that loss of function of the nuclear deubiquitinase BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1), a frequent event in MPM, is associated with sensitivity to tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)–mediated apoptosis. As a potential underlying mechanism, here we report that BAP1 negatively regulates the expression of TRAIL receptors: death receptor 4 (DR4) and death receptor 5 (DR5). Using tissue microarrays of tumor samples from MPM patients, we found a strong inverse correlation between BAP1 and TRAIL receptor expression. BAP1 knockdown increased DR4 and DR5 expression, whereas overexpression of BAP1 had the opposite effect. Reporter assays confirmed wt-BAP1, but not catalytically inactive BAP1 mutant, reduced promoter activities of <i>DR4</i> and <i>DR5</i>, suggesting deubiquitinase activity is required for the regulation of gene expression. Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated direct binding of BAP1 to the transcription factor Ying Yang 1 (YY1), and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed BAP1 and YY1 to be enriched in the promoter regions of <i>DR4</i> and <i>DR5</i>. Knockdown of <i>YY1</i> also increased DR4 and DR5 expression and sensitivity to TRAIL. These results suggest that BAP1 and YY1 cooperatively repress transcription of TRAIL receptors. Our finding that BAP1 directly regulates the extrinsic apoptotic pathway will provide new insights into the role of BAP1 in the development of MPM and other cancers with frequent BAP1 mutations."

TNFAIP8-deficient mice developed larger tumors, but TNFAIP8-deficient tumor cells completely lost their ability to migrate toward chemoattractants and were defective in colonizing lung tissues as compared to wild-type counterparts. Mechanistically, TNFAIP8 served as a cellular “pilot” of tumor cell migration by locally amplifying PI3K−AKT and Rac signals on the cell membrane facing chemoattractant; at the same time, TNFAIP8 also acted as a global inhibitor of tumor cell growth and proliferation by regulating Hippo signaling pathway. These findings help explain the migration−proliferation paradox of cancer cells that characterizes many cancers."
https://openalex.org/W3202177917,"Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a severe central nervous system (CNS) autoimmune disease that primarily damages the optic nerves and spinal cord. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) are potent producers of type 2 cytokines that orchestrate immune and inflammatory responses. However, the role of ILC2 in CNS autoimmune diseases remains unknown. In patients with NMOSD, we identified a significant reduction of ILC2 in peripheral blood, which was correlated with disease severity. Using a mouse model of NMOSD induced by intracerebral injection of NMOSD-IgG with complement, we found CNS infiltration of ILC2 mainly expressing interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-13. The depletion of ILC2 led to increased CNS lesion volume, reduced CNS glucose metabolism, and augmented astrocyte injury and demyelination. The exacerbated NMOSD pathology was accompanied by increased accumulation of Iba1+ cells and complement activity in CNS lesions. In addition, the expansion of ILC2 using IL-33 attenuated NMO pathology. Collectively, these findings suggest a beneficial role of ILC2 in NMOSD, which deserves further investigation for future design of immune therapies to treat patients with NMOSD."
https://openalex.org/W3202355900,"The proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are essential events in venous neointimal hyperplasia (VNH), a culprit of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) malfunction. Mitotic arrest-deficient protein 2B (MAD2B) is a critical regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation in many scenarios. To address the role of MAD2B in VSMCs proliferation and migration during VNH, AVFs from patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) mice were used to evaluate MAD2B expression. In cultured VSMCs treated with platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), the effect of MAD2B on VSMCs proliferation and migration was detected by cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay, immunofluorescence, wound-healing scratch and transwell assays. Besides, we exploited different small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to explore the potential mechanisms in the issue. Furthermore, rapamycin was applied to reveal whether MAD2B-associated pathways were involved in its inhibitory effect on VSMCs proliferation and migration. Accordingly, we found that MAD2B expression was enhanced in AVFs from patients with ESRD, CKD mice and VSMCs stimulated by PDGF-BB. Meanwhile, inhibition of MAD2B alleviated VSMCs proliferation and migration while the number of ski-related novel gene (SnoN)-positive VSMCs was also increased in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, gene deletion of MAD2B decreased the level of SnoN protein in PDGF-BB-stimulated VSMCs. Furthermore, rapamycin suppressed the increased expressions of MAD2B and SnoN induced by PDGF-BB. Thus, our study demonstrates that inhibition of MAD2B suppresses the proliferation and migration of VSMCs during VNH via reducing SnoN expression. Moreover, rapamycin exerts an inhibitory effect on intimal hyperplasia, possibly via the MAD2B-SnoN axis."
https://openalex.org/W3203048222,"Dr. Paul S. Frenette, M.D. passed away on July 26th, 2021 at the age of 56. He was an extraordinarily clever, compassionate, and collegial physician scientist. He was a stalwart champion for medical research and for ensuring translation of his discoveries to the clinic for the benefit of patients with intractable medical conditions, including acute myeloid leukemia, prostate cancer, and sickle cell disease. He was revered for his creative, rigorous paradigm-shifting science and loved for his kindness, humbleness, and humor. Paul will be dearly missed by his family and friends. He adored his wife Nadine and their children Clara and Albéric. He was so proud of their accomplishments and was looking forward to watching their journeys into college and life. He glowed when he would talk about his family. We extend the deepest and heartfelt condolences to them as well as his siblings, his current and former trainees, colleagues, and friends as we all mourn this monumental loss. Although a New Yorker for over two decades, Paul was originally from Québec City, Canada and was raised in a loving family with two brothers and two sisters. Here he acquired his love of skiing and hockey. He began his medical journey at Université Laval with subsequent training at McGill University and the New England Medical Center. In Boston, Paul truly found his love and aptitude for science as well as the love of his life, his wife Nadine. In 1998, Paul was recruited by Barry Coller to Mount Sinai School of Medicine to start his own lab and eventually joined the Einstein faculty in 2010 as a professor of medicine and cell biology and the inaugural director and chair of the Ruth L. and David S. Gottesman Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine. His research achievements, leadership, and mentoring commitment over the years have been truly exceptional and are widely recognized both nationally and internationally (Figure 1). His lab’s early work on selectins led to transformative treatments for vaso-occlusion in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) (Turhan et al., 2002Turhan A. Weiss L.A. Mohandas N. Coller B.S. Frenette P.S. Primary role for adherent leukocytes in sickle cell vascular occlusion: a new paradigm.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 3047-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Paul built on this finding not only from a basic science perspective, but with an eye on how to help improve the lives of patients who suffer so much. He worked closely with physicians and drug companies to foster this finding into meaningful action, which culminated in the 2019 approval of an anti-P-selectin antibody for the treatment of SCD vaso-occlusion. Due to his attention to detail, Paul’s group made another unexpected seminal discovery that the nervous system regulated hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) behavior (Katayama et al., 2006Katayama Y. Battista M. Kao W.M. Hidalgo A. Peired A.J. Thomas S.A. Frenette P.S. Signals from the sympathetic nervous system regulate hematopoietic stem cell egress from bone marrow.Cell. 2006; 124: 407-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar; Méndez-Ferrer et al., 2008Méndez-Ferrer S. Lucas D. Battista M. Frenette P.S. Haematopoietic stem cell release is regulated by circadian oscillations.Nature. 2008; 452: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). This work thrust him to the forefront of the HSC niche field where he quickly became a rising star and leader. Paul had a way of elevating those around him. His focus and work ethic are embodied in a phrase he shared often with his longtime administrator Joan Pitcan, “Get it done.” Paul was not about excuses, but solutions. He would challenge his trainees to find solutions to difficult but critical scientific questions. Similarly, science, hard work, and respect were at the forefront as he developed the Stem Cell Institute at Einstein. His out-of-the box approach to science will live on in his trainees, who know that they are better scientists for having worked with him. He challenged his trainees to think deeper. He was often right, but he would “bet them a beer” to prove him wrong. Let us all raise a glass to the eminent Dr. Paul Frenette. Paul was an outstanding hematology fellow in my laboratory in the nineties and after that a long-term collaborator and friend. He had little lab experience when he joined my group, but this was compensated for by great courage and intelligence. He wished to learn the new knockout mouse technology and decided to begin by preparing a double knockout of P-and E-selectin genes located very close to each other. This meant modifying a preexisting embryonic stem cell lacking P-selectin a second time, which had not been done before. My objections that such overmanipulated cells may not get incorporated into the germline, and that a mouse without both endothelial selectins may not live, were promptly dismissed. The three-year project, in collaboration with Tanya Mayadas and Richard Hynes (MIT), produced a very interesting mouse whose hematological phenotype was described by Paul in Cell (Frenette et al., 1996Frenette P.S. Mayadas T.N. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. Wagner D.D. Susceptibility to infection and altered hematopoiesis in mice deficient in both P- and E-selectins.Cell. 1996; 84: 563-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). This work established that selectins mediate leukocyte rolling in vivo. Paul also deduced that platelets and leukocytes have more in common than anyone had anticipated. Paul continued to produce exciting, unexpected observations throughout his career. It breaks my heart that it ended early; mentees are not supposed to leave before their mentors. Paul’s work resulted in a paradigm shift in the understanding of SCD and energized a field that had been searching in vain for novel therapies for over 50 years. He was the first to identify the critical role of neutrophils and heterocellular adhesive interactions in SCD pathophysiology. While there were initially many detractors of this model, the translation of these observations in the clinic has already profoundly changed patients’ lives. I knew Paul as a collaborator, a dear friend, and a role model. Paul was a tremendous scientist, but above all he was an exceptional person with the highest integrity. He cared deeply about the accuracy and quality of his scientific work, and this was his North Star. This, I think, informed his remarkable focus and intensity in moving projects forward and navigating any difficult professional interactions with clarity, ease, and grace. He was generous with his time and guidance, trusted people easily, smiled readily, and was always authentic. He was deeply affected by the suffering of the patients with SCD and once said to me that it was “enough” and he needed to find a way to make SCD better. The field has lost a tremendous champion. I will miss him deeply. Paul has been an invaluable member and frequent speaker on the conference circuit of the cancer, hematology, and stem cell fields. His innovative and pioneering research and critical contributions to discussions at conferences have greatly influenced the development of these fields in numerous directions. A proud French Canadian, Paul’s sharp mind, dry humor, and charm were much appreciated during conference dinners, receptions, and scientific discussions among colleagues. He was also fond of the arts and enjoyed visiting exhibitions surrounding the conferences. Paul was an enthusiastic skier who could always be found on the slopes during breaks at Keystone conferences and was always up for a little fun racing. As a connoisseur of red wine and especially champagne—preferably Dom Pérignon—he was not averse to sometimes making scientific bets on a good bottle. Paul will be sorely missed in the conference world and beyond, not only as a mentor and stimulus for new scientific developments, but also as a colleague and friend with his gracious, jovial, and inspiring personality. I mourn the loss of one of my best friends. When I first met Paul, it was in New York City at a conference. Instead of taking me to a stylish restaurant, he brought a box of sandwiches and took me to Central Park, where we sat on a stone and enjoyed lunch. We talked frankly and casually without any formalities. In science, he was serious and careful. At the same time, he was also a man who knew how to enjoy and appreciate a life. He was good humored and interested in different cultures and traditions. Besides science meetings, I had numerous and precious opportunities to share time with Paul. Once, we went to the Tsukiji Fish Market at 5 a.m. to see the tuna auction. Paul was so impressed, and after the auction we ate sushi with the fishmongers. On another occasion, we went to sumo wrestling. Paul was so excited and asked me so many questions; many of them I could not answer even though I know quite a bit about sumo. I miss his radiant smile, which delighted me. Not only have we lost a great scientist, but I have lost a good friend. Please rest in peace. The day I learned Paul had slipped away from us was the saddest, and probably the toughest, day I have ever spent at Einstein. I vividly remember that after I signed the offer letter from Einstein 10 years ago, Paul took my wife and I to his favorite restaurant, JoJo, where he spoke passionately about the Institute’s future and how together we would expand the scope of stem cell research at Einstein. I have countless beautiful memories of Paul. I clearly remember one particular miracle: for a west coast conference, we scheduled completely different flights at different airports with departures hours apart. We said, “See you later in LA!” as we set off separately from Einstein. But due to my flight experiencing delays, we found ourselves exiting back-to-back taxis at the same moment as we arrived at the conference. We laughed then that this only confirmed “it was destiny for us to become colleagues at Einstein!” I so enjoyed the time we spent organizing symposia, retreats, and other activities. After hours, we shared so many memorable dinners, with Paul always picking the perfect wine. My office was situated directly across from Paul’s, and I chatted with him whenever we crossed paths as if he were my nearest brother, and Paul just as often stopped by my office to enjoy a cup of coffee with me. We pondered, discussed, and argued over a wide range of topics, from key attitudes as a PI to the latest ice hockey news. There is no question that Paul is a pioneering scientist and his contributions to the field have been exceptional. But it was his wonderful personality that won me over as a friend. I want to emphasize how fortunate I was to have Paul as my role model and faculty mentor. He always offered sound advice, kept me on the right track, and helped me initiate and sustain a successful independent career. Paul will deeply be missed. Paul was always there, like a friend, for his trainees, staff and fellow faculty. As a faculty member, I often went to him with questions and problems on grants, lab affairs, paper submissions, and more. I could talk to him so openly, like he was an older brother. He had nurtured this environment in the institute which was not just for performing high-caliber science but also for building those strong bonds and friendships. That is why losing him so suddenly has been so tough. It was a privilege and luxury to have a scientist so brilliant, kind, and caring on my side. He was instrumental in getting my independent academic career started and helping me grow as a scientist. He was sharp and practical, but more importantly a good-hearted and simply good human being. I will deeply miss his sense of humor and our many banters over food. While we lost him too soon, his legacy in the institute and in the field is cemented forever. Because Paul always dressed so formal and proper many people did not realize that he had a mischievous streak. When I joined the lab at Mount Sinai in 2007, I became the third Spanish postdoc in the lab (together with Andres Hidalgo and Simón Méndez-Ferrer). Paul spoke zero Spanish, but he had learned from Andres to pronounce the word “caramba”—which loosely translates as “Oh, this is surprising”—perfectly. For some reason he was inordinately proud of this and anytime that he talked with one of us he would start with an “Ah, caramba...” and continued using “caramba” through the conversation. For example, I might walk into his office and ask “Paul, can I show you some cool results?” He would reply, “Ah, caramba…Of course!” Then I’d go ahead and show him the data and—if the data were interesting and surprising enough—he would start saying “Caramba! Caramba!” excitedly. He’d then glance surreptitiously at me and start asking “Caramba? Caramba?” to see if I was confident with the results and would finish with a “Very good! Caramba!” I’d leave his office excited to know that my research was going in the right direction and proud of how cool my boss was. I am going to really miss running into him at a meeting and hearing “Ah! Caramba.” Paul was my mentor for more than nine years. During that time, he trained me as a scientist and became a cherished friend. His easy manner was disarming and even made interviewing for a coveted postdoc position in his lab a fond memory. I met Paul in Glasgow where he was giving a seminar on circadian regulation of the stem cell niche. Rather than meeting in a conference room, Paul suggested we go to a local pub to discuss science and watch the soccer World Cup. He could seamlessly ask astute questions, make suggestions on my PhD project, and make pointed comments on the game. The day after this meeting, Paul offered me a position in his lab that I quickly accepted, which has made all the difference in my life. Paul helped me and my lab colleagues (the “Frenettocytes”) grow tremendously as scientists (Figure 2). As I develop my own team now, I often ask myself, “What would Paul do?” Beyond science, Paul truly loved life with a massive passion for his family, friends, classical music, great wine, and good food. He had a wonderful boisterous laugh that would fill the room. I will miss him dearly."
https://openalex.org/W3204442039,"Aims There is a well-recognised but unexplained association between lower urinary tract symptoms including urgency and urgency incontinence and falls in older people. It has been hypothesised that urinary urgency acts as a source of divided attention, leading to gait changes which increase falls risk. This study aimed to assess whether urinary urgency acts as a source of divided attention in older adults with overactive bladder (OAB). Methods 27 community-dwelling adults aged 65 years and over with a clinical diagnosis of OAB underwent 3-Dimensional Instrumented Gait Analysis under three conditions; bladder empty, when experiencing urgency, and when being distracted by the n-back test. Temporal-spatial gait and kinematic gait data were compared between each condition using repeated measures ANOVA. Results Gait velocity decreased from 1.1ms -1 in the bladder empty condition to 1.0ms -1 with urgency and 0.9ms -1 with distraction (p = 0.008 and p&lt;0.001 respectively). Stride length also decreased, from 1.2m to 1.1m with urgency and 1.0m with distraction (p&lt;0.001 for both). The presence of detrusor overactivity did not influence these results (p = 0.77). Conclusions In older adults with OAB, urinary urgency induced similar changes in gait to those caused by a distracting task. These gait changes are associated with increased fall risk. This may be part of the explanation for the association between falls and lower urinary tract symptoms in older people. Future research should examine the effect of pharmacological treatment of OAB on gait and on the effect of dual-task training on gait when experiencing urgency."
https://openalex.org/W3202369977,"Road traffic injuries (RTIs) are a major problem worldwide with a high burden of mental health problems and the importance of psychological support following road injury is well documented. However, globally there has been very little research on the accessibility of psychological services following road injury. Namibia is one of the countries most affected by RTIs but no previous studies have been done on this. In this qualitative study we investigated the availability of psychological services to RTI injured in Namibia. Our study findings are in line with those of other global studies in showing inadequate access to psychological support for injury survivors and we discuss the reasons. It is hoped these findings will help policymakers develop ways of enhancing access to psychological support for the many people injured in RTIs in Namibia. The models they develop may also be of use to other LMICs countries with high RTI rates."
https://openalex.org/W3202981236,"Ground radar interferometry technology, as a new tool for active remote sensing, has been widely used in the detection of a variety of targets, including landslides, bridges, mines, and dams. This technique usually employs a continuous observation mode with no space baseline. The detection accuracy is mainly affected by meteorological disturbances and noise in the observation environment. In a complex observation environment, meteorological disturbances can lead to phase errors of 10 mm or more, and the effects are different in the range and azimuth directions; this can seriously affect the accuracy of the measurement. In this paper, we analyze the spatial distribution of the phase of meteorological disturbances based on radar monitoring experiments in a complex environment, and propose a correction method that reduces the atmospheric disturbance phase to less than 0.6 mm and effectively improves radar observation accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W3203520409,"Dysfunction of the ATPase-binding Cassette Transporter protein (ABCA4) can lead to early onset macular degeneration, in particular to Stargardt disease. To enable translational research into this form of blindness, we evaluated the effect of Cas9-induced disruptions of the ABCA4 gene to potentially generate new transgenic rat models of the disease. We show that deletion of the short exon preceding the second nucleotide-binding domain is sufficient to drastically knock down protein levels and results in accumulation of retinoid dimers similar to that associated with Stargardt disease. Overexpression of the retinol dehydrogenase enzymes RDH8 and RDH12 can to a limited extent offset the increase in the bisretinoid levels in the Abca4Ex42-/- KO rats possibly by restricting the time window in which retinal can dimerize before being reduced to retinol. However, in vivo imaging shows that overexpression of RDH8 can induce retinal degeneration. This may be due to the depletion in the outer segment of the cofactor NADPH, needed for RDH function. The translational potential of RDH therapy as well as other Stargardt disease therapies can be tested using the Abca4 knockdown rat model."
https://openalex.org/W3203753929,"Running-in is an important and relatively complicated process. The surface morphology prior to running-in affects the surface morphology following the running-in process, which in turn influences the friction and wear characteristics of the workpiece. Therefore, the establishment of a model for running-in surface morphology prediction is important to investigate the process and optimize the surface design. Black-box models based on machine learning have robust complex object simulation performance. In this paper, five common machine learning methods are applied to establish running-in modeling performance based on surface morphology parameters. The support vector machine has the best model performance. The change law of the surface morphology parameters is obtained based on model testing, and the surface morphology optimization is explored. When better oil storage capacity is required, the recommendation is to increase the Sq, Sdq and Sk surface parameter values while setting medium Sdc and Sdr surface parameter values. When a lower coefficient of friction (COF) is required, Sdc and Sdr should be decreased, and Sq and Sdq should be increased. When better support performance is required, Sdc, Sdq, and Sdr should be increased. This article provides a solution to establish a link between surface design and functional performance in the steady wear stage, further filling the gap in quality monitoring of lifecycles."
