https://openalex.org/W2924847017,"Bemisia tabaci is one of the most threatening pests in agriculture, causing significant losses to many important crops on a global scale. The dramatic increase and availability of sequence data for B. tabaci species complex and its bacterial endosymbionts is critical for developing emerging sustainable pest management strategies which are based on pinpointing the global diversity of this important pest and its bacterial endosymbionts. To unravel the global genetic diversity of B. tabaci species complex focusing on its associated endosymbionts, along with Israeli whitefly populations collected in this study, we combined available sequences in databases, resulting in a total of 4,253 mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (mtCOI) sequences from 82 countries and 1,226 16S/23S rRNA endosymbiont sequences from 32 countries that were analyzed. Using Bayesian phylogenetic analysis, we identified two new B. tabaci groups within the species complex and described the global distribution of endosymbionts within this complex. Our analyses revealed complex divergence of the different endosymbiont sequences within the species complex, with overall one Hamiltonella, two Porteria (P1 and P2), two Arsenophonus (A1 and A2), two Wolbachia (super-groups O and B), four Cardinium (C1-C4) and three Rickettsia (R1-R3) groups were identified. Our comprehensive analysis provides an updated important resource for this globally important pest and its secondary symbionts, which have been a major subject for research in last three decades."
https://openalex.org/W2921232109,"Endogenous biomarkers remain at the forefront of early disease detection efforts, but many lack the sensitivities and specificities necessary to influence disease management. Here, we describe a cell-based in vivo sensor for highly sensitive early cancer detection. We engineer macrophages to produce a synthetic reporter on adopting an M2 tumor-associated metabolic profile by coupling luciferase expression to activation of the arginase-1 promoter. After adoptive transfer in colorectal and breast mouse tumor models, the engineered macrophages migrated to the tumors and activated arginase-1 so that they could be detected by bioluminescence imaging and luciferase measured in the blood. The macrophage sensor detected tumors as small as 25–50 mm3 by blood luciferase measurements, even in the presence of concomitant inflammation, and was more sensitive than clinically used protein and nucleic acid cancer biomarkers. Macrophage sensors also effectively tracked the immunological response in muscle and lung models of inflammation, suggesting the potential utility of this approach in disease states other than cancer. A cell-based sensor detects tumors with higher sensitivity than protein and nucleic acid biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W2922862354,"Objective To compare by 7 Tesla (7T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with focal epilepsy who have non-lesional clinical MRI scans with healthy controls. Methods 37 patients with focal epilepsy, based on clinical and electroencephalogram (EEG) data, with non-lesional MRIs at clinical field strengths and 21 healthy controls were recruited for the 7T imaging study. The MRI protocol consisted of high resolution T1-weighted, T2-weighted and susceptibility weighted imaging sequences of the entire cortex. The images were read by two neuroradiologists, who were initially blind to clinical data, and then reviewed a second time with knowledge of the seizure onset zone. Results A total of 25 patients had findings with epileptogenic potential. In five patients these were definitely related to their epilepsy, confirmed through surgical intervention, in three they co-localized to the suspected seizure onset zone and likely caused the seizures. In seven patients the imaging findings co-localized to the suspected seizure onset zone but were not the definitive cause, and ten had cortical lesions with epileptogenic potential that did not localize to the suspected seizure onset zone. There were multiple other findings of uncertain significance found in both epilepsy patients and healthy controls. The susceptibility weighted imaging sequence was instrumental in guiding more targeted inspection of the other structural images and aiding in the identification of cortical lesions. Significance Information revealed by the improved resolution and enhanced contrast provided by 7T imaging is valuable in noninvasive identification of lesions in epilepsy patients who are non-lesional at clinical field strengths."
https://openalex.org/W2923128204,"Irregular menstruation is an important indicator of current and potential health problems. A woman’s health is greatly influenced by her socioeconomic status. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of irregular menstruation by socioeconomic status among South Korean women. Secondary data analyses were conducted among 4,709 women, aged 19–54 years, using raw data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey V (2010–2012), a nationally representative survey. Compared to women who graduated from university, the adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for those who graduated from elementary school or lower, middle school, and high school were 3.256 (1.969–5.385), 2.857 (1.866–4.376), and 1.607 (1.261–2.048), respectively. Compared to women with a medium-high income level, the adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for women with the highest household income level was 1.409 (1.091–1.819). Irregular menstruation was prevalent among adult women and appeared to be associated with socioeconomic status, especially in terms of education and household income. This study’s findings suggest that attention must be paid to women with low educational levels or high household incomes, to ensure early diagnosis and the provision of medical attention for irregular menstruation."
https://openalex.org/W2924025038,"Background Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective therapeutic approach for the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disease by restoring gut microbiota; however, there is a lack of sufficient understanding regarding which microbial populations successfully colonize the recipient gut. This study characterized microbial composition and diversity in patients diagnosed with chronic constipation at 1 month and 1 year after FMT. Methods We explored the microbial diversity of pre- and posttransplant stool specimens from patients using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, followed by functional analysis. Results The results identified 22 species of microorganisms colonized in the recipients from the donors at 1 month after FMT. One-year follow-up of the patient identified the colonization of 18 species of microorganisms, resulting in identification of species in significant abundance, including Bacteroides fragilis and Hungatella hathewayi in the recipient at 1 month after FMT and Dialister succinatiphilus, Coprococcus catus, and Sutterella stercoricanis at 1 year after FMT. The majority of the colonized species belong to the phylum Firmicutes and carry genes related to polysaccharide metabolism and that enhance the energy-harvesting efficiency of the host. Conclusion These results suggest that FMT is effective for the treatment of chronic constipation through the restoration and colonization of donor microbiota in the recipient gut up to 1 year after FMT."
https://openalex.org/W2925143807,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common type of malignant gliomas, characterized by genetic instability, intratumoral histopathological variability and unpredictable clinical behavior. Disappointing results in the treatment of gliomas with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy have fueled a search for new therapeutic targets and treatment modalities. Here we report new approach towards RNA interference therapy of glioblastoma multiforme based on the magnetic nanoparticles delivery of the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) with homological sequences to mRNA of tenascin-C (TN-C), named ATN-RNA. The obtained nanocomposite consisted of polyethyleneimine (PEI) coated magnetic nanoparticles conjugated to the dsRNA show high efficiency in ATN-RNA delivery, resulting not only in significant TN-C expression level suppressesion, but also impairing the tumor cells migration. Moreover, synthesized nanomaterials show high contrast properties in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and low cytotoxicity combining with lack of induction of interferon response. We believe that the present work is a successful combination of effective, functional, non-immunostimulatory dsRNA delivery system based on magnetic nanoparticles with high potential for further application in GBM therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2923241465,"Pine processionary moth (PPM) feeds on conifer foliage and periodically result in outbreaks leading to large scale defoliation, causing decreased tree growth, vitality and tree reproduction capacity. Multispectral high-resolution imagery acquired from a UAS platform was successfully used to assess pest tree damage at the tree level in a pine-oak mixed forest. We generated point clouds and multispectral orthomosaics from UAS through photogrammetric processes. These were used to automatically delineate individual tree crowns and calculate vegetation indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and excess green index (ExG) to objectively quantify defoliation of trees previously identified. Overall, our research suggests that UAS imagery and its derived products enable robust estimation of tree crowns with acceptable accuracy and the assessment of tree defoliation by classifying trees along a gradient from completely defoliated to non-defoliated automatically with 81.8% overall accuracy. The promising results presented in this work should inspire further research and applications involving a combination of methods allowing the scaling up of the results on multispectral imagery by integrating satellite remote sensing information in the assessments over large spatial scales."
https://openalex.org/W2925091578,"Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a highly abundant protein within the neutrophil that is associated with lipoprotein oxidation, and increased plasma MPO levels are correlated with poor prognosis after myocardial infarct. Thus, MPO inhibitors have been developed for the treatment of heart failure and acute coronary syndrome in humans. 2-(6-(5-Chloro-2-methoxyphenyl)-4-oxo-2-thioxo-3,4-dihydropyrimidin-1(2H)-yl)acetamide PF-06282999 is a recently described selective small molecule mechanism-based inactivator of MPO. Here, utilizing PF-06282999, we investigated the role of MPO to regulate atherosclerotic lesion formation and composition in the Ldlr-/- mouse model of atherosclerosis. Though MPO inhibition did not affect lesion area in Ldlr-/- mice fed a Western diet, reduced necrotic core area was observed in aortic root sections after MPO inhibitor treatment. MPO inhibition did not alter macrophage content in and leukocyte homing to atherosclerotic plaques. To assess non-invasive monitoring of plaque inflammation, [18F]-Fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) was administered to Ldlr-/- mice with established atherosclerosis that had been treated with clinically relevant doses of PF-06282999, and reduced FDG signal was observed in animals treated with a dose of PF-06282999 that corresponded with reduced necrotic core area. These data suggest that MPO inhibition does not alter atherosclerotic plaque area or leukocyte homing, but rather alters the inflammatory tone of atherosclerotic lesions; thus, MPO inhibition could have utility to promote atherosclerotic lesion stabilization and prevent atherosclerotic plaque rupture."
https://openalex.org/W2922942211,"The aim of this study was to characterize the bacterial microbiome of hard ticks with affinity to bite humans in La Rioja (North of Spain).A total of 88 adult ticks (22 Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato, 27 Haemaphysalis punctata, 30 Dermacentor marginatus and 9 Ixodes ricinus) and 120 I. ricinus nymphs (CRETAV collection, La Rioja, Spain), representing the main anthropophilic species in our environment, were subjected to a metagenomic analysis of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene using an Illumina MiSeq platform. Data obtained with Greengenes database were refined with BLAST. Four groups of samples were defined, according to the four tick species.Proteobacteria was the predominant phylum observed in all groups. Gammaproteobacteria was the most abundant class, followed by Alphaproteobacteria for R. sanguineus, H. punctata and D. marginatus but the relative abundance of reads for these classes was reversed for I. ricinus. This tick species showed more than 46% reads corresponding to 'not assigned' OTUs (Greengenes), and >97% of them corresponded to 'Candidatus Midichloriaceae' using BLAST. Within Rickettsiales, 'Candidatus Midichloria', Rickettsia, Ehrlichia, 'Candidatus Neoehrlichia' and Wolbachia were detected. I. ricinus was the most alpha-diverse species. Regarding beta-diversity, I. ricinus and H. punctata samples grouped according to their tick species but microbial communities of some R. sanguineus and D. marginatus specimens clustered together.The metagenomics approach seems useful to discover the spectrum of tick-related bacteria. More studies are needed to identify and differentiate bacterial species, and to improve the knowledge of tick-borne diseases in Spain."
https://openalex.org/W2924130251,"The burden of type 2 diabetes is increasing rapidly, not least in Sub-Saharan Africa, and disadvantaged populations are disproportionally affected. Self-management is a key strategy for people at risk of or with type 2 diabetes, but implementation is a challenge. The objective of this study is to assess the determinants of self-management from an implementation perspective in three settings: two rural districts in Uganda, an urban township in South Africa, and socio-economically disadvantaged suburbs in Sweden. Data collection followed an exploratory multiple-case study design, integrating data from interviews, focus group discussions, and observations. Data collection and analysis were guided by a contextualized version of a transdisciplinary framework for self-management. Findings indicate that people at risk of or with type 2 diabetes are aware of major self-management strategies, but fail to integrate these into their daily lives. Depending on the setting, opportunities to facilitate implementation of self-management include: improving patient-provider interaction, improving health service delivery, and encouraging community initiatives supporting self-management. Modification of the physical environment (e.g. accessibility to healthy food) and the socio-cultural environment (i.e. norms, values, attitudes, and social support) may have an important influence on people’s lifestyle. Regarding the study methodology, we learned that this innovative approach can lead to a comprehensive analysis of self-management determinants across different settings. An important barrier was the difficult contextualization of concepts like perceived autonomy and self-efficacy. Intervention studies are needed to confirm whether the pathways suggested by this study are valid and to test the proposed opportunities for change."
https://openalex.org/W2925113039,"The Grapevine Pinot Gris disease (GPG-d) is a novel disease characterized by symptoms such as leaf mottling and deformation, which has been recently reported in grapevines, and mostly in Pinot gris. Plants show obvious symptoms at the beginning of the growing season, while during summer symptom recovery frequently occurs, manifesting as symptomless leaves. A new Trichovirus, named Grapevine Pinot gris virus (GPGV), which belongs to the family Betaflexiviridae was found in association with infected plants. The detection of the virus in asymptomatic grapevines raised doubts about disease aetiology. Therefore, the primary target of this work was to set up a reliable system for the study of the disease in controlled conditions, avoiding interfering factor(s) that could affect symptom development. To this end, two clones of the virus, pRI::GPGV-vir and pRI::GPGV-lat, were generated from total RNA collected from one symptomatic and one asymptomatic Pinot gris grapevine, respectively. The clones, which encompassed the entire genome of the virus, were used in Agrobacterium-mediated inoculation of Vitis vinifera and Nicotiana benthamiana plants. All inoculated plants developed symptoms regardless of their inoculum source, demonstrating a correlation between the presence of GPGV and symptomatic manifestations. Four months post inoculum, the grapevines inoculated with the pRI::GPGV-lat clone developed asymptomatic leaves that were still positive to GPGV detection. Three to four weeks later (i.e. ca. 5 months post inoculum), the same phenomenon was observed in the grapevines inoculated with pRI::GPGV-vir. This observation perfectly matches symptom progression in infected field-grown grapevines, suggesting a possible role for plant antiviral mechanisms, such as RNA silencing, in the recovery process."
https://openalex.org/W2950494327,"Dysregulation of collagen synthesis is associated with disease progression in cancer and fibrosis. Collagen synthesis is coordinated with the circadian clock, which in cancer cells is, curiously, deregulated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We hypothesized interplay between circadian rhythm, collagen synthesis, and ER stress in normal cells. Here we show that fibroblasts with ER stress lack circadian rhythms in gene expression upon clock-synchronizing time cues. Overexpression of binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) or treatment with chemical chaperones strengthens the oscillation amplitude of circadian rhythms. The significance of these findings was explored in tendon, where we showed that BiP expression is ramped preemptively prior to a surge in collagen synthesis at night, thereby preventing protein misfolding and ER stress. In turn, this forestalls activation of the unfolded protein response in order for circadian rhythms to be maintained. Thus, targeting ER stress could be used to modulate circadian rhythm and restore collagen homeostasis in disease.-Pickard, A., Chang, J., Alachkar, N., Calverley, B., Garva, R., Arvan, P., Meng, Q.-J., Kadler, K.

https://openalex.org/W2924650110,"This paper examines the link between reliance on Facebook for news, political knowledge, and political engagement in the Philippines. We tested five hypotheses using data gathered from an online survey of 978 Filipinos conducted from February 1 to March 31, 2016. Findings support the hypothesis that those who rely less on social media as a news source exhibit higher levels of perceived knowledge about politics than those who rely more on it for news. Controlling for traditional news use, following political officials or institutions on social media is associated with higher levels of political interest and engagement, those with more politically active friends on Facebook have higher levels of exposure to political content online, and there is a positive correlation between Facebook being a source of information about politics and discussing politics more often with others. However, the hypothesis that those with more friends on their network who are politically active, will have greater political knowledge and more political engagement than those who have few politically active friends on their Facebook network is not supported."
https://openalex.org/W2924987098,"Background Stroke is the third major cause of death in the world and the second in Brazil. The purpose of this work was to assess the stroke-related hospitalization, in-hospital mortality, and case fatality rates under the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) from 2009 to 2016. Methods We evaluated the hospital admissions for stroke and their associated outcomes using data from the Hospital Information available at the Informatics Department of SUS. We selected hospitalization registries according to stroke diagnosis codes from the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10). We identified the association of age and sex with patient death through multiple logistic regression and calculated the rates of hospitalization, mortality and case-fatality per 100,000 inhabitants using age-adjustment methodology. Results We analyzed 1,113,599 stroke hospitalizations. From 2009 to 2016, the number of admissions increased from 131,122 to 146,950 and the absolute number of in-hospital deaths increased from 28,731 to 31,937. Younger age and male sex were significantly associated with patient survival. Our results showed that the annual age-adjusted hospitalization and in-hospital mortality rates decreased by 11.8% and 12.6%, respectively, but the case fatality rate increased for patients older than 70 years. Conclusions Although the age-adjusted hospitalization and in-hospital mortality rates declined, the total number of hospitalization and deaths have increased. It is expected a continuous increase over the next years of stroke admissions with the rapid aging of the Brazilian population. Efforts should be renewed targeting risk factors, access to hospital and rehabilitation in particular for the elderly population."
https://openalex.org/W2921965527,"The prebiotic potential of nervine herbal medicines has been scarcely studied. We therefore used anaerobic human fecal cultivation to investigate whether medicinal herbs commonly used as treatment in neurological health and disease in Ayurveda and other traditional systems of medicine modulate gut microbiota. Profiling of fecal cultures supplemented with either Kapikacchu, Gotu Kola, Bacopa/Brahmi, Shankhapushpi, Boswellia/Frankincense, Jatamansi, Bhringaraj, Guduchi, Ashwagandha or Shatavari by 16S rRNA sequencing revealed profound changes in diverse taxa. Principal coordinate analysis highlights that each herb drives the formation of unique microbial communities predicted to display unique metabolic potential. The relative abundance of approximately one-third of the 243 enumerated species was altered by all herbs. Additional species were impacted in an herb-specific manner. In this study, we combine genome reconstruction of sugar utilization and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) pathways encoded in the genomes of 216 profiled taxa with monosaccharide composition analysis of each medicinal herb by quantitative mass spectrometry to enhance the interpretation of resulting microbial communities and discern potential drivers of microbiota restructuring. Collectively, our results indicate that gut microbiota engage in both protein and glycan catabolism, providing amino acid and sugar substrates that are consumed by fermentative species. We identified taxa that are efficient amino acid fermenters and those capable of both amino acid and sugar fermentation. Herb-induced microbial communities are predicted to alter the relative abundance of taxa encoding SCFA (butyrate and propionate) pathways. Co-occurrence network analyses identified a large number of taxa pairs in medicinal herb cultures. Some of these pairs displayed related culture growth relationships in replicate cultures highlighting potential functional interactions among medicinal herb-induced taxa."
https://openalex.org/W2924907938,"The Pseudomonas putida flhA-flhF-fleN-fliA cluster encodes a component of the flagellar export gate and three regulatory elements potentially involved in flagellar biogenesis and other functions. Here we show that these four genes form an operon, whose transcription is driven from the upstream PflhA promoter. A second promoter, PflhF, provides additional transcription of the three distal genes. PflhA and PflhF are σN-dependent, activated by the flagellar regulator FleQ, and negatively regulated by FleN. Motility, surface adhesion and colonization defects of a transposon insertion mutant in flhF revealed transcriptional polarity on fleN and fliA, as the former was required for strong surface adhesion and biofilm formation, and the latter was required for flagellar synthesis. On the other hand, FlhF and FleN were necessary to attain proper flagellar location and number for a fully functional flagellar complement. FleN, along with FleQ and the second messenger c-di-GMP differentially regulated transcription of lapA and the bcs operon, encoding a large adhesion protein and cellulose synthase. FleQ positively regulated the PlapA promoter and activation was antagonized by FleN and c-di-GMP. PbcsD was negatively regulated by FleQ and FleN, and repression was antagonized by c-di-GMP. FleN promoted FleQ binding to both PlapA and PbcsD in vitro, while c-di-GMP antagonized interaction with PbcsD and stimulated interaction with PlapA. A single FleQ binding site in PlapA was critical to activation in vivo. Our results suggest that FleQ, FleN and c-di-GMP cooperate to coordinate the regulation of flagellar motility and biofilm development."
https://openalex.org/W2924351150,"Objective To advance the goal of “Grand Convergence” in global health by 2035, this study tested the convergence hypothesis in the progress of the health status of individuals from 193 countries, using both standard and cutting-edge convergence metrics. Methods The study used multiple data sources. The methods section is categorized into two parts. (1) Health inequality measures were used for estimating inter-country inequalities. Dispersion Measure of Mortality (DMM) is used for measuring absolute inequality and Gini Coefficient for relative inequality. (2) We tested the standard convergence hypothesis for the progress in Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) and Life Expectancy at Birth (LEB) during 1950 to 2015 using methods ranging from simple graphical tools (catching-up plots) to standard parametric (absolute β and σ-convergence) and nonparametric econometric models (kernel density estimates) to detect the presence of convergence (or divergence) and convergence clubs. Findings The findings lend support to the ""rise and fall"" of world health inequalities measured using Life Expectancy at Birth (LEB) and Infant Mortality Rate (IMR). The test of absolute β-convergence for the entire period and in the recent period supports the convergence hypothesis for LEB (β = -0.0210 [95% CI -0.0227 - -0.0194], p<0.000) and rejects it for IMR (β = 0.0063 [95% CI 0.0037–0.0089], p<0.000). However, results also suggest a setback in the speed of convergence in health status across the countries in recent times, 5.4% during 1950–55 to 1980–85 compared to 3% during 1985–90 to 2010–15. Although inequality based convergence metrics showed evidence of divergence replacing convergence during 1985–90 to 2000–05, from the late 2000s, divergence was replaced by re-convergence although with a slower speed of convergence. While the non-parametric test of convergence shows an emerging process of regional convergence rather than global convergence. Conclusion We found that with a current rate of progress (2.2% per annum) the “Grand convergence” in global health can be achieved only by 2060 instead of 2035. We suggest that a roadmap to achieve “Grand Convergence” in global health should include more radical changes and work for increasing efficiency with equity to achieve a “Grand convergence” in health status across the countries by 2035."
https://openalex.org/W2924625634,"Background Bereaved parents may be at higher risk to develop persistent, severe and disabling grief, termed prolonged grief. Grief rumination, repetitive thinking about the causes and consequences of the loss, is a malleable cognitive process that maintains prolonged grief. Grief rumination can be measured with the Utrecht Grief Rumination Scale (UGRS). The present study aimed to examine the psychometric properties of the new Swedish version of the UGRS in a sample of bereaved parents. Methods A Swedish nationwide postal survey including measures of demographic and loss-related variables, grief rumination (UGRS), and symptoms of prolonged grief, posttraumatic stress, anxiety, depression, and insomnia, was completed by 226 parents (133 mothers and 93 fathers) who lost a child to cancer in the past five years. Psychometric properties of the UGRS were examined through confirmatory factor analyses (CFA), reliability analyses, and assessment of UGRS score associations with symptoms of prolonged grief, posttraumatic stress, depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Results The internal consistency of the Swedish UGRS was good. The CFA yielded an acceptable fit for a two-factor hierarchical model with five sub-factors. Grief rumination was positively associated with all psychopathology symptom measures. Higher scores on UGRS were found in parents with possible prolonged grief disorder compared to those without (d = 1.47). Moreover, the Swedish UGRS was associated with prolonged grief symptoms over and above loss-related and demographic variables and other psychopathology symptoms. Conclusions The Swedish UGRS demonstrated good psychometric properties, which supports its use as a measure to assess grief rumination in Swedish bereaved parents in research and practice."
https://openalex.org/W2925016913,"Chronic fetal hypoxia is a common complication observed in human pregnancy, impacting pregnancies across global contexts. Exposure to chronic intrauterine hypoxia has major short- and long-term consequences for offspring health. However, the impact of chronic gestational hypoxia on female reproductive system development is unknown. We aimed to understand the impact of exposure to chronic fetal hypoxia on the developing female reproductive system. Wistar rat dams underwent normoxia (21%) or hypoxia (13%) during pregnancy. Postnatally, all female offspring were maintained in normoxic conditions into early adulthood. Female rats exposed to chronic gestational hypoxia (13%) during their intrauterine development had decreased ovarian primordial follicular reserve compared to controls (P < 0.05). Adult females who had been exposed to chronic fetal hypoxia had significantly reduced somatic ovarian telomere length (P < 0.05) and reduced ovarian protein expression of KU70, a critical component of the DNA-activated protein kinase repair complex (P < 0.01). Gene expression of NADPH oxidase 2-mediated oxidative stress markers was increased (P < 0.05). Exposure to chronic hypoxia during fetal development leads to accelerated aging of the somatic ovary and decreased ovarian reserve in adulthood. Ovarian aging is highly sensitive to gestational hypoxia, with implications for future fertility in next-generation offspring of high-risk pregnancies.-Aiken, C. E., Tarry-Adkins, J.

https://openalex.org/W2924704631,"With the expansion of the aged population, it is predicted that neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) will become a major threat to public health worldwide. However, existing therapies can control the symptoms of the diseases at best, rather than offering a fundamental cure. As for the complex pathogenesis, clinical and preclinical researches have indicated that oxidative stress, a central role in neuronal degeneration, is a possible therapeutic target in the development of novel remedies. In this study, the motor neuron-like cell line NSC-34 was employed as an experimental model in probing the effects induced by the combination of non-invasive low intensity pulsed electric field (LIPEF) and fucoidan on the H2O2-induced neuron damage. It was found that single treatment of the LIPEF could protect the NSC-34 cells from oxidative stress, and the protective effect was enhanced by combining the LIPEF and fucoidan. Notably, it was observed that single treatment of the LIPEF obviously suppressed the H2O2-enhanced expression of ROCK protein and increased the phosphorylation of Akt in the H2O2-treated NSC-34 cells. Moreover, the LIPEF can be easily modified to concentrate on a specific area. Accordingly, this technique can be used as an advanced remedy for ROCK inhibition without the drawback of drug metabolism. Therefore, we suggest the LIPEF would be a promising strategy as a treatment for motor neurodegeneration and warrant further probe into its potential in treating other neuronal degenerations."
https://openalex.org/W2924839530,"Salt stress is one of the major environmental constraints for the production and yield of grape (Vitis vinifera) worldwide. The SOS3 gene family is part of the Salt Overly Sensitive (SOS) signaling pathway, a well-defined signaling pathway known to play a role in plant response to salt stress. In this study, the grapevine SOS3 gene family was annotated and the role of the annotated genes in salinity stress response was characterized. Nine grapevine SOS3 genes was identified in the grapevine genome and was subsequently analyzed. The expression patterns of the nine VviSOS3 genes, as determined by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), varied greatly in leaves, roots, and stems of in-vitro grown Pinot noir grapevine cultivar(PN40024) in response to salt (250mM NaCl) and polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG, osmolality equal to the salt treatment) treatments over a 36h time period. All of the VviSOS3 genes, except VviSOS3.7, were up-regulated in leaves in response to the salt and PEG treatments. The majority of VviSOS3 genes, except VviSOS3.8 were up-regulated in roots in response to the PEG stress, with an opposite expression pattern in the root and stem in response to salt stress. The salinity treatment decreased the soluble protein content. Based on the expression pattern and physiological data, VviSOS3.7 and VviSOS3.8 were identified as candidate genes for further functional characterizations regarding their role in the response of grapevine to salt stress."
https://openalex.org/W2922951991,"Achondroplasia is a condition characterized by a genetic mutation affecting long bone endplate development. Current data suggests that the bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) of achondroplasic populations are below age matched individuals of average stature (controls). Due to the disproportionate limb-to-torso length compared to controls however, the lower BMC and BMD may be nullified when appropriately presented. The aim of this study was to measure whole-body and segmental body composition in adult males with achondroplasia (N = 10, 22 ±3 yrs), present data relative to whole-body and whole-limb values and compare all values to age matched controls (N = 17, 22 ±2 yrs). Dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) was used to measure the in vivo mass of the whole-body and 15 segments, from which BMD, BMC, fat free mass (FFM) and body fat mass were measured. BMC of lumbar vertebrae (L1-4) was also measured and presented as a volumetric BMD (BMDVOL). The achondroplasic group had less BMC, BMD and FFM, and more body fat mass than controls as a whole-body measure. The lower achondroplasic BMC and BMD was somewhat nullified when presented relative to whole-body and whole-limb values respectively. There was no difference in lumbar BMDVOL between groups. Whole-body BMD measures presented the achondroplasic group as ‘osteopenic’. When relative to whole-limb measures however, achondroplasic BMD descriptions were normal. Further work is needed to create a body composition database for achondroplasic population’s, or for clinicians to present achondroplasic body composition values relative to the whole-limb."

Multilayers of hyaluronic acid/poly(ethylenimine) HA/PEI were built up with different numbers of bilayers and PEI-siRNA particles were embedded in bioactive layers for gene silencing. The increase of the bilayers and the release of siRNA particles were demonstrated by fluorescence intensity measurement with a fluorescence reader. Two different LbL techniques were tested for the reduction of ICAM-1 expression in EA.hy926: PEM build-up by dipping or drying steps, respectively. Herein, the drying technique of the bioactive layers with ICAM siRNA mediated a significant reduction of the ICAM-1 expression from 3 to 24 bilayers. The fluorescent siRNA release study and the re-culturing of the HA/PEI films demonstrated a release of the transfection particles within the first hour. The advantage of dried built-up PEMs compared to a dried monolayer of PEI-siRNA particles with the same siRNA concentration was a significant higher amount of viable cells."
https://openalex.org/W2923195151,"Undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells have a distinct morphology (hESC). Changes in cell morphology during culture can be indicative of differentiation. hESC, maintained in diverse medias, demonstrated alterations in morphological parameters and subsequent alterations in underlying transcript expression and lineage differentiation. Analysis of morphological parameters showed distinct and significant differences between the undefined, less defined and Xeno-free medias while still maintaining pluripotency markers. This suggested that the less defined media may be creating dynamic instability in the cytoskeleton, with the cytoskeleton becoming more stabilised in the Xeno-free media as demonstrated by smaller and rounder cells. Examination of early lineage markers during undirected differentiation using d5 embryoid bodies demonstrated increased mesodermal lineage preference as compared to endodermal or ectoderm in cells originally cultured in Xeno-free media. Undefined media showed preference for mesoderm and ectoderm lineages, while less defined media (BSA present) demonstrated no preference. These data reveal that culture media may produce fundamental changes in cell morphology which are reflected in early lineage differentiation choice."
https://openalex.org/W2923512385,"Hyperspectral imaging has proved its potential for evaluating complex plant-pathogen interactions. However, a closer link of the spectral signatures and genotypic characteristics remains elusive. Here, we show relation between gene expression profiles and specific wavebands from reflectance during three barley-powdery mildew interactions. Significant synergistic effects between the hyperspectral signal and the corresponding gene activities has been shown using the linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Combining the data sets of hyperspectral signatures and gene expression profiles allowed a more precise differentiation of the three investigated barley-Bgh interactions independent from the time after inoculation. This shows significant synergistic effects between the hyperspectral signal and the corresponding gene activities. To analyze this coherency between spectral reflectance and seven different gene expression profiles, relevant wavelength bands and reflectance intensities for each gene were computed using the Relief algorithm. Instancing, xylanase activity was indicated by relevant wavelengths around 710 nm, which are characterized by leaf and cell structures. HvRuBisCO activity underlines relevant wavebands in the green and red range, elucidating the coherency of RuBisCO to the photosynthesis apparatus and in the NIR range due to the influence of RuBisCO on barley leaf cell development. These findings provide the first insights to links between gene expression and spectral reflectance that can be used for an efficient non-invasive phenotyping of plant resistance and enables new insights into plant-pathogen interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2924162540,"Missense mutations can have disastrous effects on the function of a protein. And as a result, they have been implicated in numerous diseases. However, the majority of missense variants only have a nominal impact on protein function. Thus, the ability to distinguish these two classes of missense mutations would greatly aid drug discovery efforts in target identification and validation as well as medical diagnosis. Monitoring the co-occurrence of a given missense mutation and a disease phenotype provides a pathway for classifying functionally disrupting missense mutations. But, the occurrence of a specific missense variant is often extremely rare making statistical links challenging to infer. In this study, we benchmark a physics-based approach for predicting changes in stability, MM-GBSA, and apply it to classifying mutations as functionally disrupting. A large and diverse dataset of 990 residue mutations in beta-lactamase TEM1 is used to assess performance as it is rich in both functionally disrupting mutations and functionally neutral/beneficial mutations. On this dataset, we compare the performance of MM-GBSA to alternative strategies for predicting functionally disrupting mutations. We observe that the MM-GBSA method obtains an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.75 on the entire dataset, outperforming all other predictors tested. More importantly, MM-GBSA’s performance is robust to various divisions of the dataset, speaking to the generality of the approach. Though there is one notable exception: Mutations on the surface of the protein are the mutations that are the most difficult to classify as functionally disrupting for all methods tested. This is likely due to the many mechanisms available to surface mutations to disrupt function, and thus provides a direction of focus for future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2924239756,"Background Rising healthcare expenditures places the potential for substitution of hospital care towards primary care high on the political agenda. As low-risk basal cell carcinoma (BCC) care is one of the potential targets for substitution of hospital care towards primary care the objective of this study is to gain insight in the views of healthcare professionals regarding substitution of skin cancer care, and to identify perceived barriers and potential strategies to facilitate substitution. Methods A qualitative study was conducted consisting of 40 interviews with dermatologists and GPs and three focus groups with 18 selected GPs with noted willingness regarding substitution of skin cancer care. The interviews and focus groups focused on general views, perceived barriers and potential strategies to facilitate substitution of skin cancer care, using predefined topic lists. All sessions were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using the program AtlasTi. Results GPs were generally positive regarding substitution of skin care whereas dermatologists expressed more concerns. Lack of trust in GPs to adequately perform skin cancer care and a preference of patients for dermatologists are reported as barriers by dermatologists. The main barriers reported by GPs were a lack of confidence in own skills to perform skin cancer care, a lack of trust from both patients and dermatologists and limited time and financial compensation. Facilitating strategies suggested by both groups mainly focused on improving GPs’ education and improving the collaboration between primary and secondary care. GPs additionally suggested efforts from dermatologists to increase their own and patients’ trust in GPs, and time and financial compensation. The selected group of GPs suggested practical solutions to facilitate substitution focusing on changes in organizational structure including horizontal referring, outreach models and practice size reduction. Conclusions GPs and, to lesser extent, dermatologists are positive regarding substitution of low-risk BCC care, though report substantial barriers that need to be addressed before substitution can be further implemented. Aside from essential strategies such as improving GPs’ skin cancer education and time and financial compensation, rearranging the organizational structure in primary care and between primary and secondary care may facilitate effective and safe substitution of low-risk BCC care."
https://openalex.org/W2924405361,"Because glucose is an essential energy source for living organisms, glucose transporters (GLUTs) are present in all species worldwide. Encoded by the solute carrier family 2 gene family, the GLUT proteins generally have 12 transmembrane helices (TMHs). In total, 14 GLUT proteins have been identified in humans (hGLUTs), and they are divided into 3 classes on the basis of their transport characteristics and sequence similarities. Herein, we report the use of protein sequence similarity networks (SSNs) to visualize the sequence trends of 4101 GLUT proteins across the Metazoa. The SSNs separated the metazoan proteins into 3 new classes that were different from the traditional classification system. In the new system, 9 of the 14 hGLUTs (hGLUT1–5, 7, 9, 11, and 14) were grouped into class I, 3 (hGLUT10, 12, and 13) were grouped into class II, and 2 (hGLUT6 and 8) were grouped into class III, as also supported by the phylogenetic tree. Multiple sequence alignments further showed that the conserved residues in each class were different. Furthermore, the hGLUTs in each class showed unique evolutionary characteristics, with similar nonsynonymous-to-synonymous divergence ratios and similar regions under conservative selection pressure. Of note, GLUTs with 3, 6, 18, 24, and 36 TMHs were identified among the metazoan genomes, and 1 Chinese hamster protein with 6 TMHs showed GLUT activity. In summary, this large-scale sequence analysis provided new insights into the classification and evolution of GLUTs and further showed that gene duplication and fusion could have been important drivers during the evolution of these transporter molecules.—Jia, B., Yuan, D.

https://openalex.org/W2922932750,"Background Cirrhotic cardiomyopathy (CCM) refers to cardiac dysfunction in patients with liver cirrhosis, in the absence of other known cardiac disease. Methods Control group and patients diagnosed of liver cirrhosis without known cardiac disease or hepatocellular carcinoma were enrolled for this clinical observation study. Patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension were excluded. Absolute global longitudinal strain, one-point carotid pulse wave velocity (one-point PWV) and various parameters were measured in resting status. Results There were 29 participants in the control group and 80 patients in the liver cirrhosis group. 27.8% of cirrhotic patients presented with normal systolic but abnormal diastolic functions and QTc prolongation that were compatible with CCM. 34.2% of cirrhotic patients presented with diastolic dysfunction in resting state comparing to 24.1% in control group. Systolic functions did not show conspicuous difference between cirrhosis and control group nor between compensated and decompensated cirrhosis, neither. Furthermore, one-point PWV was significantly higher in liver cirrhosis than in control group and higher in CCM than in non-CCM patients. One-point PWV predicted CCM and diastolic dysfunction in cirrhosis. Most importantly, its value > 1370cm/s predicted overall mortalities in decompensated cirrhosis (multivariable Cox analysis OR = 6.941) in addition to CTP score specifically in HCV related cirrhotic patients (AUC = 0.817). Conclusions In patients with cirrhosis, 27.8% were diagnosed with CCM by resting cardiovascular parameters. One-point PWV increased in CCM, correlated with diastolic dysfunction. It also correlated with overall mortality in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) related decompensated cirrhosis. Further study may be needed to confirm its capability for assessing CV and mortality risks in HCV related decompensated cirrhotic patients."
https://openalex.org/W2924024029,"Leukemia relapse is the main cause for mortality after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Donor-derived allo-immune responses eliminate the residual host hematopoiesis and protect against relapse. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation (CMV-R) after allo-SCT may trigger anti-leukemic effects. The impact of CMV-specific CD8+ T-cells (CMV-CTLs) on the outcome after allo-SCT is currently unknown. Here, we studied the relationship between CMV-CTLs, overall T-cell reconstitution and relapse incidence in 103 patients with acute leukemia (n = 91) or myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 12) following CMV-seropositive recipient/donor (R+/D+) allo-SCT. Patients were subdivided based on the presence or absence of CMV-CTLs at 3 months after allo-SCT. Presence of CMV-CTLs was associated with preceding CMV-R and a fast T-cell reconstitution. Univariate analysis showed a significantly lower 1-, 2- and 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) in patients with CMV-CTLs compared to those without CMV-CTLs. Multivariable regression analysis of the outcome performed with other relevant parameters chosen from univariate analysis revealed that presence of CMV-CTLs and chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) were the only independent factors associated with a low CIR. Onset of relapse was significantly later in patients with CMV-CTLs (median 489 days) than in in those without (median 152 days, p = 0.041) during a five-year follow-up. Presence of CMV-CTLs was associated with a lower incidence of early relapses (1 and 2-years), while cGvHD lead to a lower incidence of late relapses (2 to 5-years). In conclusion, our data show that CMV-CTLs indicate a functional immune-reconstitution protective against early relapse."
https://openalex.org/W2924914792,"In this paper, we introduce a scalable machine learning approach accompanied by open-source software for identifying violent and peaceful forms of political protest participation using social media data. While violent political protests are statistically rare events, they often shape public perceptions of political and social movements. This is, in part, due to the extensive and disproportionate media coverage which violent protest participation receives relative to peaceful protest participation. In the past, when a small number of media conglomerates served as the primary information source for learning about political and social movements, viewership and advertiser demands encouraged news organizations to focus on violent forms of political protest participation. Consequently, much of our knowledge about political protest participation is derived from data collected about violent protests, while less is known about peaceful forms of protest. Since the early 2000s, the digital revolution shifted attention away from traditional news sources toward social media as a primary source of information about current events. This, along with developments in machine learning which allow us to collect and analyze data relevant to political participation, present us with unique opportunities to expand our knowledge of peaceful and violent forms of political protest participation through social media data."
https://openalex.org/W2924924531,"Sense of agency refers to the feeling of control over one's own actions. The strength of this sense varies inter-individually. This means that people differ in their perception concerning the intensity of their intentions and actions. The current study aims to determine the factors influencing this sense of agency on a personality level. Furthermore, it gives insight into the correlative relation between the strength of the sense of agency and substance use. The study involved 210 participants who were tested for the experiment (intentional binding paradigm for sense of agency, hand paradigm for intentionality bias, questionnaires FAD-Plus, NI-20, substance use). Significant determinants in personality were narcissism (vulnerable subtype) and substance use (consumption in general beyond cannabis, and particularly for the substances cannabis, ecstasy, and cocaine). Both personality types were associated with a weaker sense of agency compared to controls. For both results, alterations in the dopaminergic system need to be discussed. The present results confirm prior hypotheses that dopamine seems to play a crucial role in perception of agency. Possibly a higher accessibility of dopamine increases sense of agency (hyper-binding), whereas a lower accessibility of dopamine decreases sense of agency (hypo-binding). A second aim of the study was to see whether there is a connection between sense of agency and intentionality bias. The perception of intention in others differs widely; some people tend to see arbitrary or accidental actions as unintentional, and others quickly label actions as 'intentional' although the information is not distinct for a categorization. This cognitive error is called intentionality bias. Results could not confirm a relationship between the two constructs-one's own intention and judging intention in others. This may be due to a lack of connection between the two constructs or to methodological aspects. Further directions and limitations are discussed."

Obtaining a timely and accurate diagnosis of cardiovascular disease in gorillas is challenging, relying on echocardiography which generally requires anesthetic medications that may confound findings and can cause severe side effects in cardiovascularly compromised animals. The measurement of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) has emerged as a modality of interest in the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of human patients with heart failure. This study evaluated records for 116 zoo-housed gorillas to determine relationships of BNP with cardiovascular disease. Elevations of BNP levels correlated with the presence of visible echocardiographic abnormalities, as well as reported clinical signs in affected gorillas. Levels of BNP greater 150 pb/mL should alert the clinician to the presence of myocardial strain and volume overload, warranting medical evaluation and intervention."

Intraoperative microscopy analysis of sentinel lymph node frozen sections is standard for detection of axillary metastases but requires access to a pathologist for sample analysis. Remote analysis of digitized samples is an alternative solution but is limited by the requirement for high-end slide scanning equipment.To determine whether the image quality achievable with a low-cost, miniature digital microscope scanner is sufficient for detection of metastases in breast cancer lymph node frozen sections.Lymph node frozen sections from 79 breast cancer patients were digitized using a prototype miniature microscope scanner and a high-end slide scanner. Images were independently reviewed by two pathologists and results compared between devices with conventional light microscopy analysis as ground truth.Detection of metastases in the images acquired with the miniature scanner yielded an overall sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 99% and showed strong agreement when compared to light microscopy (k = 0.91). Strong agreement was also observed when results were compared to results from the high-end slide scanner (k = 0.94). A majority of discrepant cases were micrometastases and sections of which no anticytokeratin staining was available.Accuracy of detection of metastatic cells in breast cancer sentinel lymph node frozen sections by visual analysis of samples digitized using low-cost, point-of-care microscopy is comparable to analysis of digital samples scanned using a high-end, whole slide scanner. This technique could potentially provide a workflow for digital diagnostics in resource-limited settings, facilitate sample analysis at the point-of-care and reduce the need for trained experts on-site during surgical procedures."
https://openalex.org/W2949471146,"Background The long-term risk of stroke or myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with minor neurological symptoms who are not clinically diagnosed with transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke is uncertain. Methods We used data from a rapid access clinic for patients with suspected TIA or minor stroke and follow-up from four overlapping data sources for a diagnosis of ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, MI, major haemorrhage and death. We identified patients with and without a clinical diagnosis of TIA or minor stroke. We estimated hazard ratios of stroke, MI, major haemorrhage and death in early and late time periods. Results 5,997 patients were seen from 2005–2013, who were diagnosed with TIA or minor stroke (n = 3604, 60%) or with other diagnoses (n = 2392, 40%). By 5 years the proportion of patients who had a subsequent ischaemic stroke or MI, in patients with a clinical diagnosis of minor stroke or TIA was 19% [95% confidence interval (CI): 17–20%], and in patients with other diagnoses was 10% (95%CI: 8–15%). Patients with clinical diagnosis of TIA or minor stroke had three times the hazard of stroke or MI compared to patients with other diagnoses [hazard ratio (HR)2.83 95%CI:2.13–3.76, adjusted age and sex] by 90 days post-event; however from 90 days to end of follow up, this difference was attenuated (HR 1.52, 95%CI:1.25–1.86). Older patients and those who had a history of vascular disease had a high risk of stroke or MI, whether or not they were diagnosed with minor stroke or TIA. Conclusions Careful attention to vascular risk factors in patients presenting with transient or minor neurological symptoms not thought to be due to stroke or TIA is justified, particularly those who are older or have a history of vascular disease."

However, it is unclear whether pancreatic inflammation can be noninvasively visualized in type 2 diabetes patients. We aimed to assess pancreatic 18F-FDG uptake in type 2 diabetes patients and controls using 18F-fluorodeoxylglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT).In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we enrolled 20 type 2 diabetes patients and 65 controls who had undergone a diagnostic 18F-FDG PET/CT scan and obtained standardized uptake values (SUVs) of pancreas and muscle. Pancreatic SUV was adjusted for background uptake in muscle and for fasting blood glucose concentrations.The maximum pancreatic SUVs adjusted for background muscle uptake (SUVmax.m) and fasting blood glucose concentration (SUVglucose) were significantly higher in diabetes patients compared to controls (median 2.86 [IQR 2.24-4.36] compared to 2.15 [IQR 1.51-2.83], p = 0.006 and median 2.76 [IQR 1.18-4.34] compared to 1.91 [IQR 1.27-2.55], p<0.001, respectively).

It is therefore requisite to overcome the obstacle of hair insolubility and establish a reliable protocol for the proteome analysis of this accessible specimen. The present study employed an alkaline-based method for the efficient isolation of hair proteins and subsequently examined them using gel-based proteomics. The introduction of two proteomic protocols, namely the conventional and modified protocol, have resulted in the detection of more than 400 protein spots on the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE). When compared, the modified protocol is deemed to improve overall reproducibility, whilst offering a quick overview of the total protein distribution of hair. The development of this high-performance protocol is hoped to provide a new approach for hair analysis, which could possibly lead to the discovery of biomarkers for hair in health and diseases in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2950419799,"Familial Dysautonomia (FD) is an autosomal recessive congenital neuropathy that results from a point mutation at the 5' splice site of intron 20 in the IKBKAP gene. This mutation decreases production of the IKAP protein, and treatments that increase the level of the full-length IKBKAP transcript are likely to be of therapeutic value. We previously found that phosphatidylserine (PS), an FDA-approved food supplement, elevates IKAP levels in cells generated from FD patients. Here we demonstrate that combined treatment of cells generated from FD patients with PS and kinetin or PS and the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) resulted in an additive elevation of IKAP compared to each drug alone. This indicates that the compounds influence different pathways. We also found that pridopidine enhances production of IKAP in cells generated from FD patients. Pridopidine has an additive effect on IKAP levels when used in combination with kinetin or TSA, but not with PS; suggesting that PS and pridopidine influence IKBKAP levels through the same mechanism. Indeed, we demonstrate that the effect of PS and pridopidine is through sigma-1 receptor-mediated activation of the BDNF signaling pathway. A combination treatment with any of these drugs with different mechanisms has potential to benefit FD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2922793932,"Metabolic syndrome (MS), overlapping type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and/or hypertension, owing to high-fat diet, poses risk for cardiovascular disease. A critical feature associated with such risk is the functional impairment of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). Dipeptidyl dipeptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4 i) not only inhibit degradation of incretins to control blood glucose levels, but also improve EPC bioactivity and induce anti-inflammatory effects in tissues. In the present study, we investigated the effects of such an inhibitor, MK-06266, in an ischemia model of MS using diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. EPC bioactivity was examined in MK-0626-administered DIO mice and a non-treated control group, using an EPC colony-forming assay and bone marrow cKit+ Sca-1+ lineage-cells, and peripheral blood-mononuclear cells. Our results showed that, in vitro, the effect of MK-0626 treatment on EPC bioactivities and differentiation was superior compared to the control. Furthermore, microvascular density and pericyte-recruited arteriole number increased in MK-0626-administered mice, but not in the control group. Lineage profiling of isolated cells from ischemic tissues revealed that MK-0626 administration has an inhibitory effect on unproductive inflammation. This occurred via a decrease in the influx of total blood cells and pro-inflammatory cells such as neutrophils, total macrophages, M1, total T-cells, cytotoxic T-cells, and B-cells, with a concomitant increase in number of regeneration-associated cells, such as M2/M ratio and Treg/T-helper. Laser Doppler analysis revealed that at day 14 after ischemic injury, blood perfusion in hindlimb was greater in MK-0626-treated DIO mice, but not in control. In conclusion, the DPP-4 i had a positive effect on EPC differentiation in MS model of DIO mice. Following ischemic injury, DPP-4 i sharply reduced recruitment of pro-inflammatory cells into ischemic tissue and triggered regeneration and reparation, making it a promising therapeutic agent for MS treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2925297135,"There have been many in silico studies based on a Boolean network model to investigate network sensitivity against gene or interaction mutations. However, there are no proper tools to examine the network sensitivity against many different types of mutations, including user-defined ones. To address this issue, we developed RMut, which is an R package to analyze the Boolean network-based sensitivity by efficiently employing not only many well-known node-based and edgetic mutations but also novel user-defined mutations. In addition, RMut can specify the mutation area and the duration time for more precise analysis. RMut can be used to analyze large-scale networks because it is implemented in a parallel algorithm using the OpenCL library. In the first case study, we observed that the real biological networks were most sensitive to overexpression/state-flip and edge-addition/-reverse mutations among node-based and edgetic mutations, respectively. In the second case study, we showed that edgetic mutations can predict drug-targets better than node-based mutations. Finally, we examined the network sensitivity to double edge-removal mutations and found an interesting synergistic effect. Taken together, these findings indicate that RMut is a flexible R package to efficiently analyze network sensitivity to various types of mutations. RMut is available at https://github.com/csclab/RMut."

The Dlx5 and Dlx6 bigenic cluster encodes two evolutionary conserved homeodomain transcription factors, which are necessary for proper vertebrate development. It has been shown that Dlx5/6 genes are essential for anterior neural tube closure, however their role in the formation of the posterior structures has never been described. Here, we show that Dlx5/6 expression is required during vertebrate posterior axis formation. Dlx5 presents a similar expression pattern in neural plate border cells during posterior neurulation of zebrafish and mouse. Dlx5/6-inactivation in the mouse results in a phenotype reminiscent of NTDs characterized by open thoracic and lumbar vertebral arches and failure of epaxial muscle formation at the dorsal midline. The dlx5a/6a zebrafish morphants present posterior NTDs associated with abnormal delamination of neural crest cells showing altered expression of cell adhesion molecules and defects of motoneuronal development. Our findings provide new molecular leads to decipher the mechanisms of vertebrate posterior neurulation and might help to gather a better understanding of human congenital NTDs etiology."

Population genetic studies based on allozymes, microsatellites, PCR-RFLP and sequence analysis of genes and DNA fragments have revealed the presence of Eastern and Western phylogroups. However, the lack of genomic resources for this species has complicated the development of genetic markers. In this study, the tench transcriptome and genome were sequenced by high-throughput sequencing. A total of 60,414 putative SNPs were identified in the tench transcriptome using a computational pipeline. A set of 96 SNPs was selected for validation and a total of 92 SNPs was validated, resulting in the highest conversion and validation rate for a non-model species obtained to date (95.83%). The validated SNPs were used to genotype 140 individuals belonging to two tench breeds (Tabor and Hungarian), showing low (FST = 0.0450) but significant (<0.0001) genetic differentiation between the two tench breeds. This implies that set of validated SNPs array can be used to distinguish the tench breeds and that it might be useful for studying a range of associations between DNA sequence and traits of importance. These genomic resources created for the tench will provide insight into population genetics, conservation fish stock management, and aquaculture."

As the average, the highest yield (1582.33 kg da-1), low number of live larva + pupa per plant (2.70), tunnel length (7.73 cm) were observed in I100 x ADA-523 interaction while the lowest yield (896.00 kg da-1) was observed in I30 x Kompozit Arifiye interaction. The largest European corn borer population was observed in full irrigation (I100) and the lowest population was observed in excessive water deficit (I30) treatment. The European corn borer preferred the Kompozit Arifiye genotype. It was concluded that the genotypes should be tested under water-stressed and non-water-stressed conditions for resistance to the European corn borer and live larva and tunnel length could be used as a screening parameter."
https://openalex.org/W2924163571,"DNA-RNA hybrids arise in all cell types, and are removed by multiple enzymes, including the trimeric ribonuclease, RNase H2. Mutations in human RNase H2 result in Aicardi–Goutières syndrome (AGS), an inflammatory brain disorder notable for being a Mendelian mimic of congenital viral infection. Previous studies have shown that several AGS-associated mutations of the RNase H2B subunit do not affect trimer stability or catalytic activity and are clustered on the surface of the complex, leading us to speculate that these mutations might impair important interactions of RNase H2 with so far unidentified proteins. In this study, we show that AGS mutations in this cluster impair the interaction of RNase H2 with several members of the CoREST chromatin-silencing complex that include the histone deacetylase HDAC2 and the demethylase KDM1A, the transcriptional regulators RCOR1 and GTFII-I as well as ZMYM3, an MYM-type zinc finger protein. We also show that the interaction is mediated by the zinc finger protein ZMYM3, suggesting that ZMYM3 acts as a novel type of scaffold protein coordinating interactions between deacetylase, demethylase and RNase H type enzymes, raising the question of whether coordination between histone modifications and the degradation of RNA-DNA hybrids may be required to prevent inflammation in humans."

Methods To find the maximum usable colchicine concentration, an ocular irritation study was performed with the Draize test at concentrations of 0.001%, 0.01% and 0.1%. Additionally, the synergistic effect of topical colchicine instillation and MMC application to surgical site was evaluated in a rabbit model by measuring changes after trabeculectomy in intraocular pressure (IOP) and bleb morphology score at 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, and 49 days. Results Experiments with a rabbit model of trabeculectomy showed that 0.04% MMC plus 0.01% colchicine was more effective than saline and 0.04% MMC alone in maintaining IOP reduction at days 7–49 (P < 0.01 at all time points) and day 49 (P < 0.05), respectively, while 0.04% MMC alone was more effective than saline only at days 7–35 (P < 0.05 at all time points). 0.04% MMC plus 0.01% colchicine and 0.04% MMC alone were more effective than saline at preserving bleb score at days 7–21 and 35–49 (P < 0.05 at all time points) and at days 7–35 (P < 0.05 at all time points), respectively.

However, the association between galactose intake from dietary sources and the ovarian function in women without galactosemia has not yet been described. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the associations between both dietary galactose and lactose intake, and ovarian dysfunction as the odds of early menopause in women without galactosemia.This cross-sectional study was conducted on 821 women without galactosemia, participants of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS), who experienced natural menopause. Habitual dietary intakes of lactose and galactose during the past 12 month were assessed, using a food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ). In this study, early menopause was defined as natural menopause before the age of 45 years.Mean- and menopausal age of women were reported as 59.3±7.94 and 48.6±4.81 years, respectively. No statistically significant linear association was observed between the daily intakes of lactose and galactose and the odds of early menopause. After adjusting for age, energy intake, and age at menarche, women in the middle tertiles of lactose (62%, 95%CI: 1.07, 2.46) and galactose (58%, 95% CI: 1.05, 2.39) intake had significantly higher odds of early menopause, than those in the first tertile. When the daily intake of lactose and galactose were expressed as the percentage of energy intake, the higher odds of early menopause among women in the middle tertile compared to those with the first tertile were reduced and became non-significant.No statistically significant linear associations were reported between the intake of lactose and galactose and age of menopause. However, the odds of early menopause in those women with the middle tertile of lactose and galactose intake were significantly higher than those women in the first tertile."

We use heavy metal as an example of cultural identities due to its high salience. We first assess the social morphology of metal preferences in terms of socio-economic and socio-structural positions, and then asses the short term outcomes of being a heavy metal fan on education and health behaviors. Methods The analysis was based on a representative random stratified sample of 23-year-olds of native Swedish, Iranian, and Yugoslavian background in contemporary Sweden (n = 2,232). Linear probability models with multiple imputation were used to calculate preferences for metal music and the association of metal preferences with subsequent outcomes. Results In contrast to many prior studies, we find that the preference for heavy metal is not structured by social background or neighborhood context in Swedish adolescents. Poor school grades tend to make them more prone to like metal, but net of previous grades, social background, personality, personal network, and neighborhood characteristics, metal fans have substantially lower transition rates into higher education. Discussion The study suggest that metal preferences appears rather unsystematically with few important predictors, and is linked to lower education attainments in the short run. While these findings are specific to heavy metal as a certain type of culture and to Swedish adolescents, we suggest that they are indicative of how cultural consumption may play a role for life-chances."

Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the chest wall kinematics of healthy subjects submitted to the use of three different devices for pulmonary reexpansion.Chest wall compartmental and operational volumes, breathing pattern and thoracoabdominal asynchrony were evaluated in 12 healthy individuals through optoelectronic plethysmography during quiet breathing, pulmonary reexpansion and recovery. Three different devices (volume-oriented incentive spirometer-IS-v; positive expiratory pressure-PEP; and incentive spirometer volume and pressure oriented-IS-vp) were administered in a random order with at least 48h between the devices.A greater volume variation in the chest wall and its compartments was observed when the IS-vp was used in comparison with the other devices (p<0.05). Furthermore, the IS-vp mobilizes a greater amount of volume accompanied by greater synchronism between the compartments when compared to IS-v (p <0.05).The IS-vp may be able to increase total and compartmental chest wall volumes, as well as improve synchrony among compartments when compared to IS-v and PEP devices, thus constituting an important tool for treating patients with restrictive ventilatory pattern."

Even messages written in any language and later encrypted by cryptographic systems do not lose all of their characteristics, there remain aspects that help the cryptanalyst to recover them without knowing the decryption keys. For the characterization of the languages we will consider the frequencies of their graphemic and phonetic units and the Index of Coincidence, tools of fundamental utility in the field of Cryptography. Their diachronic invariance or survival over time in one language and their ability to discriminate against other languages will be analized. In order to do so, we will examine a total of 101 languages of which 261 texts have been taken. All of them are very diverse in style and time, taking us through a wide linguistic and temporal spectrum that will cover the period from the 6th century BC to the present day."
https://openalex.org/W2923364526,"TRIM5α is an interferon inducible restriction factor which contributes to intrinsic defense against HIV infection by targeting the HIV capsid protein CA. Although human TRIM5α (huTRIM5α) does not potently inhibit HIV-1 infection, the ability of huTRIM5α to exhibit some control of HIV-1 infection is evidenced by a single nucleotide polymorphism in huTRIM5α which substitutes aspartic acid to glycine at position 249 (G249D) in the L2 region and is associated with higher susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. To understand the mechanistic basis for the reduced antiviral activity, we employed biophysical and cell biological methods coupled with molecular dynamics simulations to compare WT and the G249D polymorphism of huTRIM5α. We investigated the differences in conformational dynamics of rhesus and huTRIM5α Coiled Coil-Linker 2 (CC-L2) dimers utilizing circular dichroism and single molecule-Fluorescence Energy Transfer (sm-FRET). These methods revealed that the G249D dimer exhibits secondary structure and conformational dynamics similar to WT huTRIM5α. Homology modelling revealed that G249 was present on the hairpin of the antiparallel dimer, in a position which may act to stabilize the adjacent BBox2 domain which mediates the inter-dimeric contacts required for the formation of TRIM5 assemblies. We therefore asked if the G249D mutant forms assemblies in cells with the same efficiency as WT protein by expressing these proteins as YFP fusions and quantifying the number of assemblies in cells. In cells expressing comparable amounts of protein, the G249D mutant formed fewer assemblies than WT protein, in agreement with our homology modeling predictions and molecular dynamics simulations of dimers and higher oligomers of TRIM5α, providing a mechanistic explanation of the reduced antiviral activity of the G249D polymorphism."
