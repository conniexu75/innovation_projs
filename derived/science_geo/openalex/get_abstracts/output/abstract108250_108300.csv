https://openalex.org/W1978763290,"Low pH induces a conformational change in the influenza virus haemagglutinin, which then mediates fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. The three-dimensional structure of a fragment of the haemagglutinin in this conformation reveals a major refolding of the secondary and tertiary structure of the molecule. The apolar fusion peptide moves at least 100 Å to one tip of the molecule. At the other end a helical segment unfolds, a subdomain relocates reversing the chain direction, and part of the structure becomes disordered."
https://openalex.org/W2094808560,"A beta 1-40, a major component of Alzheimer's disease cerebral amyloid, is present in the cerebrospinal fluid and remains relatively soluble at high concentrations (less than or equal to 3.7 mM). Thus, physiological factors which induce A beta amyloid formation could provide clues to the pathogenesis of the disease. It has been shown that human A beta specifically and saturably binds zinc. Here, concentrations of zinc above 300 nM rapidly destabilized human A beta 1-40 solutions, inducing tinctorial amyloid formation. However, rat A beta 1-40 binds zinc less avidly and is immune to these effects, perhaps explaining the scarcity with which these animals form cerebral A beta amyloid. These data suggest a role for cerebral zinc metabolism in the neuropathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease."

https://openalex.org/W2022754746,"Mechanisms of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis by members of the G protein alpha subunit-p21ras superfamily of guanosine triphosphatases have been studied extensively but have not been well understood. High-resolution x-ray structures of the GTP gamma S and GDP.AlF4- complexes formed by the G protein Gi alpha 1 demonstrate specific roles in transition-state stabilization for two highly conserved residues. Glutamine204 (Gln61 in p21ras) stabilizes and orients the hydrolytic water in the trigonal-bipyramidal transition state. Arginine 178 stabilizes the negative charge at the equatorial oxygen atoms of the pentacoordinate phosphate intermediate. Conserved only in the G alpha family, this residue may account for the higher hydrolytic rate of G alpha proteins relative to those of the p21ras family members. The fold of Gi alpha 1 differs from that of the homologous Gt alpha subunit in the conformation of a helix-loop sequence located in the alpha-helical domain that is characteristic of these proteins; this site may participate in effector binding. The amino-terminal 33 residues are disordered in GTP gamma S-Gi alpha 1, suggesting a mechanism that may promote release of the beta gamma subunit complex when the alpha subunit is activated by GTP."
https://openalex.org/W2113221012,"THE pleckstrin homology (PH) domain is a new protein module of around 100 amino acids found in several proteins involved in signal transduction1–5. Although its specific function has yet to be elucidated, the carboxy-terminal regions of many βγ domains bind to the py subunits of G proteins6,7. On the basis of structural similarities between PH domains and lipid-binding proteins, we have proposed that PH domains may be binding to lipophilic molecules8. Indeed, many of the proteins that contain this domain associate with phospholipid membranes6,9,10, and disruption of this domain can interfere with membrane association6,11. Here we report that PH domains bind to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate and show that the lipid-binding site is located at the lip of the β-barrel. This suggests that PH domains may be important for membrane localization of proteins through interactions with phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate."
https://openalex.org/W2011722739,"Thrombopoietin (TPO) is a cytokine that is involved in the regulation of platelet production. The receptor for TPO is c-Mpl. To further investigate the role and specificity of this receptor in regulating megakaryocytopoiesis, c-mpl-deficient mice were generated by gene targeting. The c-mpl-/- mice had an 85 percent decrease in their number of platelets and megakaryocytes but had normal amounts of other hematopoietic cell types. These mice also had increased concentrations of circulating TPO. These results show that c-mpl specifically regulates megakaryocytopoiesis and thrombopoiesis through activation by its ligand TPO."
https://openalex.org/W2034353458,"The radiosensitive mutant xrs-6, derived from Chinese hamster ovary cells, is defective in DNA double-strand break repair and in ability to undergo V(D)J recombination. The human XRCC5 DNA repair gene, which complements this mutant, is shown here through genetic and biochemical evidence to be the 80-kilodalton subunit of the Ku protein. Ku binds to free double-stranded DNA ends and is the DNA-binding component of the DNA-dependent protein kinase. Thus, the Ku protein is involved in DNA repair and in V(D)J recombination, and these results may also indicate a role for the Ku-DNA-dependent protein kinase complex in those same processes."

https://openalex.org/W1991180616,"We describe a strategy for producing human monoclonal antibodies in mice by introducing large segments of the human heavy and κ light chain loci contained on yeast artificial chromosomes into the mouse germline. Such mice produce a diverse repertoire of human heavy and light chains, and upon immunization with tetanus toxin have been used to derive antigen–specific, fully human monoclonal antibodies. Breeding such animals with mice engineered by gene targeting to be deficient in mouse immunoglobulin (Ig) production has led to a mouse strain in which high levels of antibodies are produced, mostly comprised of both human heavy and light chains. These strains should provide insight into the adoptive human antibody response and permit the development of fully human monoclonal antibodies with therapeutic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2058015528,"Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are rapidly activated in response to stimulation of diverse receptor types. MAPKs are positively regulated by phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine by MAP kinase or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinases (MEKs). MEK kinase (MEKK) is part of a family of serine-threonine protein kinases that phosphorylate and activate MEKs independently of Raf. MEKK was rapidly and persistently activated in response to stimulation of resting PC12 cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF). Nerve growth factor (NGF) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) also activated MEKK, although to a lesser degree than did EGF. Activation of MEKK and B-Raf in response to EGF was inhibited by expression of dominant negative N17Ras. Expression of oncogenic Ras resulted in activation of MEKK. Stimulation of synthesis of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate abolished activation of MEKK and B-Raf by EGF, NGF, and TPA. Thus, Ras simultaneously controls the activation of members of the Raf and MEKK families of protein kinases."
https://openalex.org/W2073775209,"A family of uniform periodic polypeptides has been prepared by bacterial expression of the corresponding artificial genes, with the objective of exploring the potential for control of supramolecular organization in genetically engineered protein-based polymeric materials. The repeating units of the polypeptides consist of oligomeric alanyl-glycine sequences interspersed with glutamic acid residues inserted at intervals of 8 to 14 amino acids. Crystallization of such materials from formic acid produces beta-sheet structures in the solid state, as shown by vibrational spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and wide-angle x-ray diffraction. The diffraction results, together with observations from electron microscopy, are consistent with the formation of needle-shaped lamellar crystals whose thickness is controlled by the periodicity of the primary sequence. These results can be used to control solid-state structure in macromolecular materials."

https://openalex.org/W1559121591,"Human apolipoprotein (apo) E4 (arginine at residue 112) preferentially associates with very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), and apoE3 (cysteine at 112) associates with high density lipoproteins. It has been postulated that the amino-terminal domain, which contains residue 112, influences the lipoprotein preference by interacting with the carboxyl-terminal domain, which contains the lipid-binding region. To delineate the region in the carboxyl-terminal domain mediating lipoprotein binding and involved in isoform preference, we produced truncated apoE3 and apoE4 variants (terminating at residues 251, 260, 266, or 272) in Escherichia coli and assessed them for lipoprotein association. This analysis suggested that residues 260-272 contain important determinants for complete lipoprotein association and isoform preferences. To determine whether positive charge at residue 112 was an absolute requirement for the apoE4 VLDL preference, we compared the distributions of rabbit apoE (equivalent to apoE3, with cysteine at a position corresponding to 112), canine apoE (arginine at the corresponding site), and cysteamine-treated rabbit apoE (cysteine converted to a positively charged residue). Surprisingly, all distributed like human apoE3, suggesting that positive charge at a position corresponding to 112 was not directly responsible for the isoform preference and that other residues in the amino-terminal domain were involved. To determine which residues were involved, the structure of the apoE4 22-kDa fragment (the amino-terminal two-thirds of the molecule) was determined to 2.5 A by x-ray crystallography. Compared with the known four-helix bundle structure of apoE3, the only significant differences in the apoE4 structure were that glutamic acid 109 formed a salt bridge with arginine 112 and that the arginine 61 side chain was displaced to a new position. Site-directed mutagenesis of glutamic acid 109 in apoE3 and arginine 61 in apoE4 demonstrated that the position of the arginine 61 side chain in apoE4 was critical in determining apoE4 lipoprotein distribution, suggesting that arginine 61 interacted with the carboxyl-terminal domain to direct binding to VLDL."
https://openalex.org/W1578096869,"We have cloned overlapping cDNAs encoding alpha 1E Ca2+ channel subunits from mouse and human brain. We observed that these alpha 1E transcripts were widely distributed in the central nervous system. We also demonstrated the existence of two variants of the human alpha 1E subunit. Comparison of the sequence of these alpha 1E subunits to those from other species suggests that at least four alternatively spliced variants of alpha 1E exist. Expression of human alpha 1E in HEK293 cells and Xenopus oocytes produced high voltage-activated Ca2+ currents that inactivated rapidly (tau approximately 20 ms at 0 mV). The size of the currents obtained were enhanced approximately 40-fold by co-expression with human neuronal alpha 2 and beta Ca2+ channel subunits. alpha 1E currents were insensitive to the drugs and toxins previously used to define other classes of voltage-activated Ca2+ channels. Thus, alpha 1E-mediated Ca2+ channels appear to be a pharmacologically distinct class of voltage-activated Ca2+ channels."

The necessary vaccine efficacy levels and population coverage levels for eradication are quantified. The likely impact of risk behavior changes on vaccination campaigns is assessed. The results show it is unlikely that vaccines will be able to eradicate HIV in San Francisco unless they are combined with considerable reductions in risk behaviors. Furthermore, if risk behavior increases as the result of a vaccination campaign, then vaccination could result in a perverse outcome by increasing the severity of the epidemic."
https://openalex.org/W1503718503,"Aggregation of the high affinity IgE receptor (Fc epsilon RI) on rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells results in activation of the protein tyrosine kinases Syk and Lyn. Here, we report that fusion proteins containing the Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of Syk and Lyn precipitated tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins from RBL-2H3 cell lysates. There was no detectable precipitation with the N-terminal Syk SH2 domain, minimal with the C-terminal Syk SH2, and strong when the two SH2 domains were expressed in tandem. The Syk SH2 domains showed pronounced selectivity in the binding of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Thus, Syk SH2 precipitated only three phosphoproteins, two of which were the beta and gamma subunits of Fc epsilon RI. In contrast, the fusion protein with Lyn SH2, in addition to precipitating the same Fc epsilon RI components, bound to many other phosphoproteins. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the beta and gamma subunits of Fc epsilon RI was essential for their precipitation with the SH2 fusion proteins. By direct binding studies, there was more binding of Syk SH2 to Fc epsilon RI gamma than to Fc epsilon RI beta, whereas Lyn SH2 bound only to Fc epsilon RI beta. The Syk SH2 fusion protein competitively inhibited the association of gamma and beta with Syk in lysates of activated cells. The SH2-mediated association of these two protein tyrosine kinases with Fc epsilon RI could play an important role in receptor signaling."

Overexpression of targeting components of the N-end rule pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae inhibited the growth of haploid but not diploid cells. This ploidy-dependent toxicity was shown to result from enhanced degradation of Gpa1, the alpha subunit (G alpha) of a heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) that regulates cell differentiation in response to mating pheromones. Sst2, a protein whose absence renders cells hypersensitive to pheromone, was essential for degradation of G alpha but not other N-end rule substrates, suggesting the involvement of an indirect, or trans-, targeting mechanism. G alpha degradation by the N-end rule pathway adds another regulatory dimension to the multitude of signaling functions mediated by G proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2053053887,"As a step toward developing poliovirus as a vaccine vector, poliovirus recombinants were constructed by fusing exogenous peptides (up to 400 amino acids) and an artificial cleavage site for viral protease 3Cpro to the amino terminus of the viral polyprotein. Viral replication proceeded normally. An extended polyprotein was produced in infected cells and proteolytically processed into the complete array of viral proteins plus the foreign peptide, which was excluded from mature virions. The recombinants retained exogenous sequences through successive rounds of replication in culture and in vivo. Infection of animals with recombinants elicited a humoral immune response to the foreign peptides."
https://openalex.org/W2000363488,"Subcellular gradients of cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i, are thought to be critical for the localization of functional responses within a cell. A potential but previously unexplored mechanism for the generation of gradients of [Ca2+]i is the accumulation of Ca2+ stores at the site of Ca2+ action. The distribution of the Ca2+ store markers Ca(2+)-dependent adenosine triphosphatase and calreticulin was investigated in resting and phagocytosing human neutrophils. Both proteins showed an evenly distributed fine granular pattern in nonphagocytosing cells, but became markedly concentrated in the filamentous actin-rich cytoplasmic area around the ingested particle during phagocytosis. This redistribution began at early stages of phagocytosis and did not depend on an increase in [Ca2+]i. Thus, accumulation of Ca2+ stores in a restricted area of the cell may contribute to the generation of localized increases in [Ca2+]i."
https://openalex.org/W1569255564,"Abstract Lipoprotein lipase (LpL) catalyzes the hydrolysis of triglycerides in plasma lipoproteins at the luminal surface of the vascular endothelium. This enzyme is bound via electrostatic interactions to heparan sulfate (HS). The specific endothelial cell surface HS oligosaccharide sequences that are necessary for binding of LpL to HS have not been characterized. To identify this LpL-binding oligosaccharide sequence, oligosaccharides were isolated from bovine aortic endothelial cell-derived HS and assessed for LpL binding properties. Endothelial HS chains that were isolated from endothelial total cell-associated proteoglycans were deacetylated by complete hydrazinolysis, cleaved with nitrous acid (pH 4.5), and reduced with [3H]NaBH4. The resulting fragments composed of N-sulfated glucosamine-rich oligosaccharides terminating with [3H]2,5-anhydromannitol (AManR) were chromatographed on a LpL-Sepharose column. A high affinity decasaccharide was isolated and characterized. Disaccharide analysis of this decasaccharide indicated that it yielded only the disaccharide IdceA(2-SO4)-->AManR(6-SO4) on treatment with nitrous acid at low pH. Therefore, the sequence of the LpL-binding decasaccharide is [IdceA(2-SO4) alpha 1-4GlcNSO4(6-S0(4)) alpha 1-4]4-IdceA(2-SO4) alpha 1-4AManR(6-SO4) and is distinct from those that bind antithrombin and basic fibroblast growth factor. Partial depolymerization of endothelial HS chains with hydrazine/high pH nitrous acid treatment gave rise to lipase-binding oligosaccharides larger than decasaccharide. However, further complete depolymerization of these oligosaccharides resulted in only a high affinity decasaccharide composed of repeating disaccharide units of [IdceA(2-SO4) alpha 1-4GlcNSO4(6-S0(4))]. These results indicate that the decasaccharide is the active fragment that binds to LpL with high affinity. Molecular modeling studies of the decasaccharide indicate that it presents a linear array of negatively charged sulfate groups that may adopt a favorable disposition to bind to peptide region(s) comprised of basic amino acid residues of LpL with high affinity."
https://openalex.org/W1545633418,"Abstract RC3/neurogranin is a forebrain-enriched, postnatal-onset, thyroid hormone-dependent, protein kinase C substrate of dendritic spines that interacts with calmodulin. These characteristics suggest a prominent role within the Ca(2+)-mediated second messenger cascades associated with neonatal synaptogenesis and adult neural plasticity. To understand the molecular interactions between RC3 and calmodulin, we characterized recombinant RC3 and four sequence variants: Ser-36-->Ala, Ser-36-->Asp, Ser-36-->Lys, and Phe-37-->Trp. Interactions between CaM and variant Phe-37-->Trp can be monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy, allowing us to determine, by competitive assays, the relative affinities of the wild-type and variant proteins for calmodulin. The effects of salt and Ca2+ on the rank order of these affinities permit partial dissection of hydrophobic, ionic, and structural components of the RC3-CaM interaction and suggest that it is bimodal. We demonstrate that RC3 binds preferentially to CaM when Ca2+ is absent and that the addition of a negative charge to residue 36 is sufficient to disrupt all detectable RC3-CaM interactions. We propose a model wherein a Ca(2+)-sensitive, bimodal interaction between RC3 and CaM regulates the transduction of postsynaptic Ca2+ fluxes into physiological responses through the modulation of Ca2+/CaM availability."
https://openalex.org/W1653069047,"Reversible phosphorylation of proteins on tyrosine residues is critical in several cellular activities. The removal of the phosphate groups from tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins is accomplished by a class of enzymes which constitute a large family of related proteins, the protein tyrosine phosphatases. We report here the isolation of a complementary DNA encoding a novel protein tyrosine phosphatase, which we termed hPTP1E. Several overlapping cDNA clones were isolated to reconstruct a sequence of 8301 nucleotides. Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNA from different human tissues revealed the presence of a mRNA of 8.2-8.5 kilobases suggesting the near full-length sequence had been cloned. The composite hPTP1E cDNA contains an open reading frame encoding 2490 amino acid residues. The predicted protein (M(r) = 277,567) does not contain a signal peptide or a membrane-spanning region and possesses a single catalytic domain (amino acids 2241-2470). The recombinant phosphatase domain has been expressed in Escherichia coli, purified to near homogeneity and showed to possess specific protein tyrosine phosphatase activity. The primary structure of hPTP1E also displays homology to cytoskeleton- and membrane junction-associated proteins. Thus, the region encompassing amino acids 568-1053 is related to the cytoskeletal proteins of the band 4.1 family. In addition, hPTP1E contains five imperfect repeats possessing significant homology to the GLGF repeats of the junction-associated guanylate kinases such as the Drosophila discs-large tumor suppressor gene (dlg-1). The structural features of hPTP1E suggest that it localizes at the junction between the plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton where it may regulate signal transduction and cytoskeletal integrity."
https://openalex.org/W1581075759,"We previously cloned the human cellular retinoic acid-binding protein-II (CRABPII) gene and demonstrated a rapid and transient increase in retinoic acid (RA)-dependent transcription in cultured human skin fibroblasts. To determine whether retinoid receptors could regulate CRABPII gene transcription, cotransfection experiments were performed. When RAR alpha was cotransfected in Cos-1 cells with a reporter construct containing -8.0 kilobases of the upstream region, an 18-fold RA induction was obtained. By deletion analysis, a region essential for RA induction located approximately -5.6 kilobases upstream from the human CRABPII gene start site was identified. Sequencing and mutational analysis identified a direct repeat (GGGTCAttggaAGGACA) with 5-base pair spacing (DR-5) that is critical for RA-mediated induction of human CRABPII gene transcription. This is different from the mouse CRABPII gene in which two RAREs (DR-1 and DR-2) are required for full activation. To determine whether RAR and RXR can bind to the human CRABPII RARE, gel retardation assays were performed. In these assays, in vitro translated RAR alpha and RXR alpha were found to bind efficiently as heterodimers in gel retardation assays; weak binding of RAR alpha homodimers was observed. These data demonstrate that the human CRABPII gene is regulated by a far upstream RARE that most efficiently binds RAR-RXR heterodimers."
https://openalex.org/W1622227958,"The platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor couples with multiple signaling pathways such as activation of phospholipase C, phospholipase A2, and mitogen-activated protein kinase and the inhibition of adenylate cyclase. The PAF-induced signals are attenuated by repetitive or long standing applications of the agonist (homologous desensitization). To investigate mechanisms underlying the agonist-induced desensitization, we constructed mutant forms of the cloned guinea pig PAF receptor and stably expressed them in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The cells expressing the wild type receptor transiently activated phospholipase C in response to PAF. Intracellular inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate level and intracellular Ca2+ concentration reached the maximal levels within 20 s and returned to the basal levels in several minutes, even in the continuous presence of the ligand. In contrast, a truncated PAF receptor lacking the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail induced sustained elevations of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. Similar findings were noted in another mutant, in which the Ser/Thr residues in the carboxyl-terminal tail were substituted with Ala. Both mutant PAF receptors more potently activated the other signals (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, arachidonate release, and inhibition of adenylate cyclase) than did the wild type receptor. Thus, while the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the PAF receptor is not required for the forward activation of multiple signals, it does have a critical role for signal attenuation induced by the agonist through phosphate accepters. We also noted that the synthetic peptide of the PAF receptor carboxyl-terminal tail was strongly phosphorylated by the recombinant beta-adrenergic receptor kinase 1, suggesting that it or its relatives might be involved in PAF receptor phosphorylation and homologous desensitization."
https://openalex.org/W1680045005,"Abstract We explored the association between two cytosolic components of the phagocyte respiratory burst oxidase, p47phox and p67phox. Both of these proteins bound to immobilized GTP or 2',5'-ADP, but not to GDP or ATP. Similarly, triazine dye-ligand chromatography demonstrated coisolation of p47phox and p67phox. Binding of p67phox to GTP was less avid than that of p47phox. Each of the proteins in whole neutrophil cytosol bound separately to GTP in the absence of the other, whereas studies with recombinant proteins showed binding of p47phox but not p67phox. These data suggest that p47phox and p67phox exist as a complex that very likely involves at least one additional cytosolic protein. Sequential precipitation in graded concentrations of ammonium sulfate demonstrated similar profiles for p47phox and p67phox. Charge-based separations using either an anion or cation exchange resin resulted in coelution of the two cytosolic oxidase components, in spite of their widely differing charges as shown by separate analysis of the recombinant proteins. Moreover, preparative isoelectric focusing showed that a portion of the p47phox and p67phox in cytosol coisolated at a pI (7.3-8.3) midway between those of the separate proteins. Despite this, each protein sedimented independently in sucrose density gradients. The data indicate that the complex of p47phox and p67phox was dissociated by increased temperature, high osmolarity, or prolonged incubation. We suggest that under the physiologic conditions in the cytosol of intact phagocytes p47phox, p67phox and probably other proteins exist as a macromolecular complex, the function of which may be to permit en bloc translocation of oxidase components to the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1924066319,"Pterocarpan phytoalexins are antimicrobial compounds in leguminous plants. The final step of biosynthesis, conversion of vestitone to medicarpin, was thought to be catalyzed by a single enzyme pterocarpan synthase. We have shown that the synthase activity observed in crude extracts of alfalfa suspension cell cultures is the sum of two independent enzymatic activities: vestitone reductase, which catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of vestitone to 7,2'-dihydroxy-4'-methoxyisoflavanol (DMI), and DMI dehydratase, which catalyzes loss of water and closure of an ether ring to form medicarpin. The first enzyme, vestitone reductase, was purified 1,840-fold to homogeneity by a 5-step procedure. Purified vestitone reductase showed a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an estimated molecular mass of 38 kDa. The native molecular mass measured by gel filtration was shown to be 34 kDa, indicating that vestitone reductase is a monomer. Vestitone reductase has strict substrate stereo specificity for (3R)-vestitone with a Km value of 45 microM. The second enzyme, DMI dehydratase, was partially purified 962-fold. DMI dehydratase had a native molecular mass of 38 kDa as estimated by gel filtration and a Km value of 5 microM for DMI. Both enzymes have a temperature optimum of 30 degrees C and a pH optimum of 6.0. The discovery of vestitone reductase and DMI dehydratase will facilitate future genetic manipulation of biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1492811993,"The dermaseptins are a family of broad spectrum antimicrobial peptides, 27-34 amino acids long, involved in the defense of the naked skin of frogs against microbial invasion. They are the first vertebrate peptides to show lethal effects against the filamentous fungi responsible for severe opportunistic infections accompanying immunodeficiency syndrome and the use of immunosuppressive agents. A cDNA library was constructed from skin poly(A+) RNA of the arboreal frog Phyllomedusa bicolor and screened with an oligonucleotide probe complementary to the COOH terminus of dermaseptin b. Several clones contained a full-length DNA copy of a 443-nucleotide mRNA that encoded a 78-residue dermaseptin b precursor protein. The deduced precursor contained a putative signal sequence at the NH2 terminus, a 20-residue spacer sequence extremely rich (60%) in glutamic and aspartic acids, and a single copy of a dermaseptin b progenitor sequence at the COOH terminus. One clone contained a complete copy of adenoregulin, a 33-residue peptide reported to enhance the binding of agonists to the A1 adenosine receptor. The mRNAs encoding adenoregulin and dermaseptin b were very similar: 70 and 75% nucleotide identities between the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions, respectively; 91% amino acid identity between the signal peptides; 82% identity between the acidic spacer sequences; and 38% identity between adenoregulin and dermaseptin b. Because adenoregulin and dermaseptin b have similar precursor designs and antimicrobial spectra, adenoregulin should be considered as a new member of the dermaseptin family and alternatively named dermaseptin b II. Preprodermaseptin b and preproadenoregulin have considerable sequence identities to the precursors encoding the opioid heptapeptides dermorphin, dermenkephalin, and deltorphins. This similarity extended into the 5'-untranslated regions of the mRNAs. These findings suggest that the genes encoding the four preproproteins are all members of the same family despite the fact that they encode end products having very different biological activities. These genes might contain a homologous export exon comprising the 5'-untranslated region, the 22-residue signal peptide, the 20-24-residue acidic spacer, and the basic pair Lys-Arg."

The MBP-Raf fusions were purified by affinity chromatography on amylose resin and tested for binding to Ras.GTP indirectly by measuring their ability to inhibit the stimulation of Ras GTPase activity by GTPase activating protein (GAP120) in vitro. MBP-Raf(55-132) was a potent inhibitor in this assay (50% inhibition at 100 nM concentration), but the other fusion proteins had no measurable effect. The fusion partners were cleaved with Factor Xa protease and separated by gel filtration. The 8960-dalton Raf(55-132) fragment retained full activity as a competitive inhibitor of GAP120. It also blocked Ras-stimulated germinal vesicle breakdown in frog oocytes. Raf(55-132) was further characterized by circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The results indicate that this fragment of c-Raf-1 adopts a highly structured, monomeric conformation in solution."
https://openalex.org/W1524910418,"Abstract Here we describe the molecular cloning of 7.1-kilobase cDNA encoding chick cardiac muscle tensin. It contains an open reading frame of 1,744 amino acid (aa) residues. Sequence analysis reveals that, in addition to the previously noted SH2 domain (Davis, S., Lu, M. L., Lo, S. H., Lin, S., Butler, J. A., Druker, B. J., Roberts, T. M., An, Q., and Chen, L. B. (1991) Science 252, 712-715), tensin contains virtually all of the known sequence (362 aa) of insertin, an actin-capping protein that allows actin monomer to be inserted (Schroer, E., and Wegner, A. (1985) Eur. J. Biochem. 153, 515-520). Moreover, tensin shares partial homology with actin (46.7% identity in 30 aa), beta-spectrin's actin-binding consensus (40% identity in 26 aa), BCR (40% identity in 25 aa), catenin alpha (35% identity in 45 aa), synapsin Ia (25.6% identity in 156 aa), IL-3 receptor (20.2% identity in 384 aa), and IL-2/EPO receptors (14% identity in 20 aa). Recombinant full-length tensin, tagged with an influenza-derived epitope, was over-expressed by a baculovirus system and purified to apparent homogeneity. It migrates as a 200-kDa protein in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, similar to the native tensin. The structure of the tensin molecule has been characterized by light scattering, electron microscopy, and gel filtration. Nine monoclonal antibodies recognizing different regions of tensin have been prepared and characterized. The epitope-tagged recombinant tensin gene was subcloned into a pRcCMV vector and transfected into NIH 3T3 cells. Immunofluorescence stainings with monoclonal antibodies specific for chick tensin (not cross-reactive with mouse tensin) showed that the expressed protein is indeed localized at focal contacts, as that of native tensin."
https://openalex.org/W1489213275,"Several observations led us to investigate the possibility that retinoic acid achieved its marked induction of alkaline phosphatase gene expression through a post-transcriptional effect in the nuclei of clonal rat pre-osteoblastic UMR 201 cells. The steady-state level of alkaline phosphatase mRNA was significantly stimulated by retinoic acid. Although nuclear run-on analysis showed that 10(-6) M retinoic acid caused an increase in alkaline phosphatase gene transcription, this was transient compared with the rise in alkaline phosphatase mRNA which continued to accumulate for many hours after retinoic acid stimulation of gene transcription had ceased. Moreover, the modest increase in transcriptional rate (approximately 2-fold) was not sufficient to account for the magnitude of the rise in mRNA level. In order, therefore, to examine the influence of retinoic acid on nuclear processing events, a cellular subfractionation method was applied. By nuclease protection analysis, and also by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, sequences corresponding to intron 2 and intron 4, respectively, were demonstrated specifically in the nuclear matrix fraction of both control and retinoic acid-treated cells. Mature (spliced) alkaline phosphatase mRNA accumulated in the non-matrix (DNase I/salt eluate, nuclear membrane) and cytoplasmic fractions of retinoic acid-treated cells at more than 100-fold greater levels than in control cells. This implies that nuclear processing of the primary RNA transcript occurred only in cells treated with retinoic acid. The post-transcriptional action of retinoic acid was inhibited by cotreatment with 10 micrograms/ml cycloheximide. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) (1 ng/ml) did not influence whole cell alkaline phosphatase levels in UMR 201 cells. Nevertheless, TGF beta increased the transcriptional rate of the alkaline phosphatase gene. Although precursor mRNA was detected in the nuclear matrix fraction of TGF beta-treated cells, there was no evidence of further mRNA nuclear processing. The data are consistent with stabilization of nascent alkaline phosphatase mRNA chains by retinoic acid treatment and suggests that regulation of mRNA processing can be independent of gene transcription. This study demonstrates a novel post-transcriptional action of retinoic acid which plays an important, if not a dominant role, in determining the steady-state level of alkaline phosphatase mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1542924344,"Although only one small PG has been identified in dentin until now, a preliminary investigation has shown indications of the presence of several new proteoglycans (PGs) in rat incisor dentin. The aim of the present investigation was to isolate and characterize these PGs, which were labeled with 35S to facilitate the analysis. C18 chromatography resolved five dentin PGs. Based on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, their size varied from 100 to 400 kDa. The core proteins of the first four PGs appeared as 25, 40, 70, and 115 kDa bands. They stained turquoise with Stains All but did not stain with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The core protein of the fifth PG appeared at about 45 kDa. This core protein stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue but not with Stains All. In all PGs, the glycosaminoglycans consisted mainly of chondroitin 4-sulfate. To investigate their incorporation into predentin (young dentin that is not yet mineralized) and dentin, rat dentin PGs were pulse-labeled by injecting rats with [35S]sulfate at 5, 28, 55, or 177 h before killing the animals. Radiolabeling of predentin PGs was highest after 5 h and decreased rapidly (76%) over the next 50 h. In dentin PGs, a large percentage (34%) of the final quantity of incorporated 35S (at 177 h) was already present at 5 h. C18 chromatography of dentin PGs for each of the four time intervals showed similar 35S distribution patterns representing all five PGs, whereas the predentin appeared to contain mainly the fifth PG. This study demonstrates the existence of several apparently novel PGs in dentin that can be resolved by the use of a new method. These PGs were found in mineralized dentin and are thought to be rapidly transported toward the mineralization front. Part of the predentin PGs, on the other hand, seems to be lost as mineralization proceeds."

https://openalex.org/W1611264534,"The insulin receptor-related receptor (IRR) gene encodes a protein that is homologous to the receptors for insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). We have cloned a full-length cDNA encoding the human IRR by screening a human kidney cDNA library. The nucleotide sequence of our cDNA is identical to the sequence predicted from the human IRR gene except for the presence of an insertion of 24 base pairs between exons 13 and 14. This insertion was caused by use of an alternative splice acceptor site in the 3' portion of intron 13. Interestingly, this alternative splicing occurs at a position at which alternative splicing of the homologous IGF-I receptor mRNA also occurs. We amplified human kidney IRR by the polymerase chain reaction to quantitate the proportion of transcripts which included the 24-nucleotide sequence between exons 13 and 14. Fewer than 10% of the transcripts contained this additional sequence. We expressed the IRR cDNA lacking the 24-base pair insert in NIH-3T3 cells to study the biosynthesis, tyrosine phosphorylation, and ligand binding properties of the IRR. Like receptors for insulin and IGF-I, the IRR was synthesized as a single polypeptide precursor that underwent proteolytic cleavage and glycosylation to yield an alpha subunit and a beta subunit. However, both subunits of the IRR had smaller apparent molecular mass than the homologous subunits of the insulin receptor (108,000 versus 135,000 for the alpha subunits and 66,000 versus 95,000 for the beta subunits). IRR tyrosine phosphorylation could be stimulated by vanadate plus H2O2, which have been demonstrated previously to increase the phosphotyrosine content of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase. However, proinsulin, insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II did not stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of the IRR. We conclude that these peptides are not the ligands for the IRR."
https://openalex.org/W1515368650,"To analyze the importance of the endoplasmic reticulum oxidizing state for the folding and aggregation of newly made polypeptides, we have incubated intact HepG2 hepatoma cells in the presence of dithiothreitol. When dithiothreitol-treated cells were extracted under nondenaturing conditions immunoprecipitates of newly synthesized albumin showed a complex polypeptide profile. Using direct and sequential immunoprecipitation protocols we identified eight other polypeptide chains, transferrin, plasminogen, ceruloplasmin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, the three fibrinogen chains, and haptoglobin, that were among the proteins co-immunoprecipitated with albumin. The heterotypic aggregates are larger than several hundred kilodaltons and are stabilized by noncovalent interactions. Of the 10 polypeptide chains we examined, only one, alpha 1-antitrypsin, failed to aggregate. This protein is distinguished from the others by the absence of disulfide bonds. We propose a model in which the function of the oxidizing conditions of the endoplasmic reticulum is to promote the rapid formation of disulfide bonds that stabilize adhesive domains in a buried state, thus preventing global heterotypic aggregation of newly synthesized chains."
https://openalex.org/W1508912704,"Glycogenin is a 37-kDa protein upon which new glycogen molecules are considered to be constructed. Therefore, we were interested in determining its role in liver glycogen synthesis following glucose administration. Twenty-four-hour fasted rats were given 4 g/kg glucose orally. Glycogenin and synthase R activities and glycogen were determined over the subsequent 24 h. In fasted rats given just water, glycogenin activity was present and did not change over the subsequent 24 h. Following glucose, glycogenin activity also was not different for 1 h, i.e. the glycogenin was not incorporated into glycogen even though the glycogen concentration had increased. Subsequently, the glycogenin activity became unmeasurable. Presumably, the glycogenin was incorporated into a proteoglycan product since after amylase treatment, glycogenin activity was again present and was quantitatively unchanged. Free glycogenin activity remained unmeasurable until after 12 h. At this time, glycogen began to decrease, and, by 15 h, free glycogenin activity again appeared. The results indicate that in fasted rats, essentially all of the glycogenin was free. Following administration of oral glucose, glycogenin was incorporated into a proteoglycan product but only 60 min after glycogen synthesis had begun. Free glycogenin did not reappear until the 15th h after glucose was given and after the glycogen concentration had decreased by approximately 60%."
https://openalex.org/W1480211483,"The transition state for the hydrolysis of AMP by AMP deaminase has been characterized by heavy atom kinetic isotope effects (Merkler, D.J., Kline, P.C., Weiss, P., and Schramm, V.L. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 12993-13001). The experimentally established transition state includes a bond order of 0.8 to the attacking water nucleophile, a full bond order to the exocyclic 6-amino group, rehybridization of C-6 of the purine ring to sp3 and protonation of N-1 by Glu633. The transition state is one the path to formation of an unstable tetrahedral intermediate in which the exocyclic amine undergoes rapid protonation followed by its departure. In this mechanism, the highest energetic barrier on the reaction coordinate is the attack of the zinc-activated water. In a further test of this transition state structure, the electrostatic potential surface for the purine ring of the transition state has been determined by molecular orbital calculations and compared to that of the base of (R)-coformycin 5'-monophosphate, a slow onset, tight binding inhibitor of AMP deaminase that binds with an overall dissociation constant of 10(-11) M. The electrostatic potential surfaces of the aglycones of the transition state and (R)-coformycin are compared to the adenine ring of the substrate and to an alternative transition state structure in which the transition state is late, with fully bonded hydroxyl and fully protonated exocyclic amine. The results indicate a near-match of the electrostatic potential surfaces for the early transition state and (R)-coformycin. The electrostatic nature of the late transition state with a protonated amine leaving group differs both from the transition state determine by kinetic isotope effects and from that of (R)-coformycin analogues. The results provide evidence that the nature of the enzyme-stabilized transition state for adenine deamination involves an early transition state with a partially bonded hydroxyl group. The observed tight binding inhibition by (R)-coformycin analogues as transition state inhibitors results from the similarity of the partial charges on the inhibitors to that of the enzymatic transition state stabilized by AMP deaminase."
