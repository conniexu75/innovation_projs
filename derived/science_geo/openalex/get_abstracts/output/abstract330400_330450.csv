https://openalex.org/W2059708410,"Results from different models for the natural carbon dioxide cycle are compared. Special emphasis is given to the type of ocean modeling (diffusive deepsea or two-box ocean), behavior of the biosphere, and value of the oceanic buffer factor against carbon dixoide uptake. According to the most probable models, the fraction of the cumulative production remaining airborne will be between 46 and 80 percent 100 years from now for any realistic assumptions concerning future carbon dioxide production. For a prescribed maximum increase of 50 percent above the preindustrial carbon dioxide level, the production could grow by about 50 percent until the beginning of the next century, but should then decrease rapidly."

Females mate once each month, 4 to 5 days before one of the semimonthly spring tides. The relation of the time of reproduction to tide cycles may be an adaptation to increase to a maximum the probability that the final stage of the planktonic larvae will be transported by tidal currents to substrates suitable for adults."

This uplift is consistent with reinflation of a magma reservoir at a depth of about 10 kilometers. Stresses generated by this magmatic resurgence may have caused the sequence of four magnitude 6 earthquakes near Mammoth Lakes in May 1980."
https://openalex.org/W1967960873,"The existence of a cubic fluorite-type SnO2 and a hexagonal TiO2 (which may be related to the fluorite structure) have been demonstrated by an in situ x-ray diffraction study in which a diamond-anvil pressure cell was used after the samples had been heated by a continuous yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser. At room temperature, the lattice parameter for SnO2 (fluorite) is a = 4.925 ± 0.005 angstroms and those for TiO2 (fluorite-related) are a = 9.22 ± 0.01 angstroms and c = 5.685 ± 0.006 angstroms at about 250 kilobars. The volume change associated with the transition from rutile to fluorite (or related structure) is about –8 percent for SnO2 and –10.5 percent for TiO2 at transition. Upon release of pressure, both the fluorite-type SnO2 and the TiO2 reverted to the α-PbO2 structure at room temperature. The hypothesis that the earth's lower mantle is composed of oxide phases might be feasible if it were possible for SiO2 to possess the fluorite structure or its related forms at high pressure, as shown for SnO2 and TiO2 in this study. The oxide hypothesis proposed here differs from that postulated by Birch in that the primary coordination of silicon is 6 for Birch's hypothesis and 8 for the hypothesis presented here."

Although communal, individuals maintain webs and retreats within the colony and capture their own prey. Group size and interindividual distance apparently vary in response to climate and availability of prey."
https://openalex.org/W2044678876,"In addition to searches for purposeful signals, those attempting interstellar communication should also consider the possibility of eavesdropping on radio emissions inadvertently ""leaking"" from other technical civilizations. To understand better the information which might be derivable from radio leakage, the case of planet earth is considered. The most detectable and useful escaping signal arise in a few BMEWS-type radar systems and in normal television broadcasting. A model including over 2000 television transmitters is used to demonstrate the wealth of astronomical and cultural information available from a distant observer's careful monitoring of frequency and intensity variations in individual video carriers (program materials is not taken to be detectable)."
https://openalex.org/W2044820790,"Eicosapentaenoic and arachidonic acids extracted from the fungus Phytophthora infestans elicit the accumulation of fungitoxic sesquiterpenoid stress metabolites and inhibit the accumulation of steroid glycoalkaloids in potato tubers. This dual activity, which did not occur with other saturated and unsaturated fatty acids tested, corresponds to the activity of incompatible races of Phytophthora infestans and crude elicitor preparations from Phytophthora infestans that contain bound forms eicosapentaenoic and arachidonic acids. Arachidonic acid applied to potato slices, which had been aged for various time intervals, elicited the accumulation of sesquiterpenoid stress metabolites and concomitantly inhibited the accumulation of steroid glycoalkaloids."
https://openalex.org/W1982466744,A chemical factor from wheat stem rust uredospores that induces infection structure formation has been identified as acrolein (2-propenal). This compound is the active component of distillates from uredospore extracts previously shown to induce infection structure formation.
https://openalex.org/W2056939324,"Discovery of mercury in an ancient Maya offering at Lamanai, Belize, has stimulated examination of possible sources of the material in the Maya area. Two zones of cinnabar and native mercury deposits can be defined in the Maya highlands, and the presence of the native metal suggests that the ancient Maya collected rather than extracted the mercury from ore."

The formation of fine holes several tens of nanometers in diameter in polyvinylidene fluoride films, bombarded by fission fragments in oxygen and etched in 5-normal sodium hydroxide solution at 85 degrees C, was confirmed by electron microscopy."
https://openalex.org/W1975402609,"Exceptionally well preserved larval bivalve shells have been isolated from Late Cretaceous (Maestrichtian) sediments. Specimens were readily identified to familial level on the basis of gross morphology and hinge structures. Reconstruction of fossil larval ontogeny, linked with the distribution of adult stages, will provide an important interpretative tool in molluskan phylogenetic and paleoecologic studies."
