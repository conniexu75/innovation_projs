Satisfactory evidence for the specificity of the procedure has been obtained from comparisons with biological assay and by paper chromatography. The mean concentrations of noradrenaline and adrenaline in rats with a mean weight of 235 gm., and the means of the percentages of adrenaline in the mixture of amines (referred to below as ‘adrenaline /catechol ratio’) are shown in Table 1. The latter is both higher and more uniform than has been found by other workers and corresponds with the higher ‘adrenaline/catechol ratio’ found by Weil-Malherbe and Bone in blood2,3. The distribution of noradrenaline does not appear to support the current hypothesis that in general its concentration can be correlated with the density of adrenergic nerve fibres4,5."
