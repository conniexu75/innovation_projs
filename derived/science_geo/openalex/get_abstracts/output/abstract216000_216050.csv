https://openalex.org/W2042450995,"Exposure of male hamsters to cycles of 1 hour of light and 23 hours of darkness causes atrophy of the gonads. Pinealectomy prevents this atrophy, but has no effect on animals exposed to light-dark cycles of 16 : 8. Likewise, removal of both eyes induces gonad atrophy which is prevented by pinealectomy. These data emphasize the importance of the pineal gland in the regulation of photoperiodic influences on the gonads."

Later he learns to differentiate the graphic symbols from one another and to decode these to familiar speech sounds. As he learns the code, he must progressively utilize the structural constraints which are built into it in order to attain the skilled performance which is characterized by processing of higher-order units-the spelling and morphological patterns of the language."
https://openalex.org/W2086254928,"After a shift in temperature, the population kinetics of HeLa cells does not immediately reach a steady state characteristic of the new temperature. During the transition period the duration of each period of the life cycle (period before DNA synthesis, of DNA synthesis, after DNA synthesis, and the period of mitosis) increases toward its steady-state value. Of the four periods, the period before DNA synthesis reaches its steady-state value fastest. Exponential growth can be maintained only from 33 degrees C through 40 degrees C. The period of mitosis is the most temperature-sensitive period of the life cycle of the cell. At subnormal temperatures (26 degrees C through 31 degrees C) there is an accumulation of cells in mitosis, and mitotic indices as high as 0.44 can be obtained. The duration of mitosis is a function both of the temperature and of the time which the cell has spent at this temperature."

This concentration is considerably lower than that at which sublethal damage has been detected previously. Histological examination reveals erosion of the taste buds; electrophysiological methods and observations of swimming and feeding behavior reveal impairment of receptor function. Affected fish do not fully recover after 6 weeks in detergent-free water."

https://openalex.org/W2038663057,"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase commonly occurs in at least two forms in most tissues of the deer mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus, as demonstrated by starch-gel electrophoresis. An autosomally determined genetic polymorphism in one of the enzymes was discovered. A hybrid molecule occurs in the heterozygote; this suggests a dimeric structure of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2093900547,"Skin from bullfrog tadpoles does not show the potential difference characteristic of adult frog skin until several days after the emergence of the forelimbs, presumably because the mechanism for active sodium transport is absent or nonfunctional. Exposure to low concentrations of thyroxine accelerates appearance of the transepidermal potential difference at rates which are related to the dosage. This system may provide a new basis for evaluating the importance of specific biochemical mechanisms in active sodium transport."
https://openalex.org/W2083348927,"The wide hysteresis and low surface tension of lung extracts, as studied on a modified Langmuir-Wilhelmy surface balance, are dependent on the presence of subphase electrolytes. A possible mechanism for the hysteresis and its importance to the exchange of surfactants between the alveolar cell and the alveolar surface film are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2018504622,"THIN-LAYER chromatography on cellulose layers has been shown to be an effective method for separation and quantitative determination of nucleic acid bases, nucleosides and nucleotides1–5 which has considerable advantages over paper chromatography. Keck and Hagen5 recently reported a one-dimensional thin-layer chromatographic separation of the four major bases of RNA and DNA. The present communication describes a two-dimensional procedure which in this laboratory has proved useful for separating more complex mixtures of nucleic acid bases."

https://openalex.org/W2055118154,"Distinctly different electrophoretic patterns of red cell glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were resolved from the hemolyzates of horse and donkey erythrocytes. Examination of their reciprocal hybrids, mules and hinnies, showed that the red cells of female mules and female hinnies contain both horse and donkey G-6-PD; the male mule with an X chromosome from its horse mother contained pure horse G-6-PD, whereas the male hinny with the donkey X chromosome contained pure donkey G-6-PD. These findings on the male reciprocal hybrids suggest X-linkage."
https://openalex.org/W2002551291,Measurements were made of the ability of four blind subjects to use echoes to discriminate between objects of different sizes placed in front of them. Threshold estimates indicate that objects with area ratios as low as 1.07/1 could be discriminated.

Three of these, identical electrophoretically to the Mem-1 described by Kraus and Neely, were heterozygous variants involving the a-locus. The fourth, involving the b-locus, appears to be the first example in man of a homozygous variant."

https://openalex.org/W2087130338,"Calf-thymus DNA was degraded into small fragments (oligodeoxyribonucleotides); the fragments were treated with methylated bovine serum albumin, and the complexes so formed were emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant and injected into rabbits. The serums of the immunized rabbits contained antibodies that reacted with homologous and heterologous unfragmented heat-denatured DNA, and also with a synthetic polydeoxyadenylate-thymidylate. Relatively small DNA fragments (of the order of tetra-hexanucleotide) can thus serve as haptens for the production of DNA antibodies; this finding increases the probability of producing antibodies specific for unique sequences of nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W2068524948,"Hydra heterocytes—that is, hydra containing cells from both normal and mutant animals, were used for studying some developmental properties of mixed cell populations. Cells which initially had originated from a nonbudding mutant, and which subsequently became part of a heterocyte of normal appearance, were able to proliferate, to segregate, to come off as buds, and to express their phenotype in those buds. Furthermore, the heterocytes underwent a transformation in which the mutant phenotype eventually became dominant in all instances."
https://openalex.org/W2081705060,"Studies of the chromosomes of four American marsupials demonstrated that Caluromys derbianus and Marmosa mexicana have a diploid number of 14 chromosomes, and that Philander opossum and Didelphis marsupialis have a diploid number of 22. The karyotypes of C. derbianus and M. mexicana are similar, whereas those of P. opossum and D. marsupialis are dissimilar. If the 14-chromosome karyotype represents a reduction from a primitive number of 22, these observations suggest that the change has occurred independently in the American and Australasian forms."
https://openalex.org/W1978451922,"The local electroretinogram of the monkey retina is recorded by intraretinal microelectrodes. Observations of the late receptor potential, isolated by selective clamping of the retinal circulation, show that when the retina is light-adapted by repetitive stimulation, the amplitude of the receptor potential is only slightly reduced over a slow time course. The reduction in amplitude of the b-wave is much greater and occurs much more rapidly. Thus there is a neural stage of adaptation between the late receptor potential and the generation of the b-wave by cells of the inner nuclear layer."
https://openalex.org/W2045713436,"The umbilical cord blood of 47 out of 54 normal human infants contains hemagglutinating activity directed toward cells coated with a type-L Bence-Jones protein. This hemagglutinating material, in some instances, is present in cord blood in the absence of such activity in the maternal blood. Ultracentrifugation of cord serum in a sucrose gradient shows that the activity is associated with the macroglobulin fractions."

https://openalex.org/W1985455335,"SINCE Kalow1 in 1956 demonstrated a genetically controlled atypical (dibucaine resistant) variant of human pseudocholinesterase (acylcholine acylhydrolase [Enzyme Commission: 3.1.1.8]) much information has been gained on the polymorphism of this enzyme, an esterase of the serum of which the function is not known. Besides the most common gene (Ch1U) responsible for the synthesis of the usual pseudocholinesterase at least three other genes have been described on the same autosomal locus, namely, the alleles Ch1D, Ch1F and Ch1S, each producing variant enzymes different from the normal pseudocholinesterase. There is no difference in health between various genotypes of the usual gene Ch1U and those of the alleles Ch1D, Ch1F and Ch1S, unless either homozygotes or heterozygotes of each of the latter three genes are subjected to the application of the muscle relaxant suxamethonium (succinyldicholin) when an abnormally prolonged apnoea is observed. Heterozygotes with both a variant gene and the usual gene do not show this sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2058921742,"β-Hydroxyethylhydrazine forces flowering of pineapple plants, possibly by reducing auxin concentration. A specific and sensitive assay showed that β-hydroxyethylhydrazine (3.3 × 10-7M) inhibits noncompetitively and almost completely the oxidation of tryptamine to indoleacetaldehyde by extracts of pea-seedling (Pisum sativum L. var. Alaska). The relative rate of oxidation of putrescine to Δ1-pyrroline compared to that of tryptamine by these extracts and the inhibition of both reactions by β-hydroxyethylhydrazine suggest that diamine oxidase is inhibited. β-Hydroxyethylhydrazine is a potent inhibitor in vivo of animal diamine oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W2077475456,"Apparently nitrous acid produces genetic alterations, expressed as antibiotic-resistant markers, directly on heat-denatured transforming DNA of Haemophilus influenzae, rather than producing DNA which acts as a non-specific mutagen. The markers which arise as a result of treatment with nitrous acid behave similarly to naturally occurring antibiotic markers. In addition, data comparing the expression and replication of induced markers to natural markers suggest that the nitrous acid-induced markers express and multiply in the same fashion as do ""normal"" markers. Therefore, mutations which require additional time to produce a functional DNA by a base-pair substitution, or by replication of the introduced DNA, are not responsible for the mutants observed."

https://openalex.org/W2008136241,"THE fact that transformation of hamster cells by ‘SV40’ results in the synthesis of new viral-induced antigen(s) was first inferred by in vivo immunity tests1–4. This phenomenon was later detected in vitro by complement-fixation5 and by immunofluorescence6,7. This latter approach has characterized the antigen as being particulate, intranuclear and present in 100 per cent of the transformed cells. Corresponding information regarding the intracellular site of the complement-fixing antigen and the proportion of cells in a culture synthesizing it has not yet been reported, and, indeed, such data are difficult to obtain by a direct approach."
https://openalex.org/W69164566,"The experimental system described above has been in full-scale operation now for about one year. It has been possible in this short period only to begin the exploration of the potentialities of the system for aiding nervous system research. The most intensively developed programs have been those on the insect (3) and on human vision and eye movements (5). In both of these programs the facility has permitted new research techniques which have provided answers to important questions, answers which would have been unobtainable without such a data-processing and control system."

https://openalex.org/W1978505475,"THE investigation of utero-ovarian relationships would be facilitated by the development of a successful technique for the transplantation of the uterus. Transplants of the uterus have been examined in several species: in the guinea-pig by Butcher et al.1, Hechter et al.2, and Loeb3; in the rabbit by Mishell and Motyloff4, Chu et al.56, and Sessums and Murphy6; in the mouse by Parfenoff7 and Hall8; and in the dog by Cheval9. In these investigations intraperitoneal, intramuscular or subcutaneous sites were used for the transplantation of the entire uterus, uterine slices, endometrium, endometrial scrapings or suspensions of uterine tissue, Histological observations of the transplants either were not always presented or, when reported, usually exhibited degenerative changes. The development of a successful technique for the hetero-transplantation of rabbit oviduct to the cheek pouch of the Syrian hamster as reported by McDaniel and Black10 prompted a similar investigation using uterine transplants. The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the survival of uterine transplants in the cheek pouch of the hamster."

https://openalex.org/W2009274072,"A telestimulator has been constructed which is suitable for mounting on the heads of medium-sized Macaca mulatta or larger primates. It differs from previous units in that the battery supply is continuously recharged from ambient light by means of solar cells. The system features remote control of all stimulus parameters, constant current output, and remote selection of any of 11 electrodes. If additional transmitters are employed, simultaneous and independent stimulation of a number of primates in the same group is possible. A shielded room with a terminated antenna system is used to produce a homogeneous radio-frequency field for laboratory use."

Later, Holloway and Jennings2 demonstrated that there were similarities between their mating system and that of Escherichia coli K12. Fertility in the males was associated with an infectious factor which Holloway and Jennings called FP to distinguish it from the fertility factor, F, in E. coli. They were, however, unable to free their cells from the FP factor with acriflavine. Holloway1 reported 125 recombinants per 109 parent cells."
