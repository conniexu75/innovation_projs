https://openalex.org/W2149562261,"Nanoscale mechanical resonators can be used to measure the mass of particles with extraordinarily high resolution down to the zeptogram scale — that's multiples of 10−21 grams. Such astonishing resolution has not been possible in many practical applications such as medical diagnostics or environmental monitoring, where the presence of fluids dampens the mechanical vibrations that make the system work. Now a team from MIT and the Santa Barbara labs of Innovative Micro Technology and Affinity Biosensors has devised an ingenious way around this problem by placing the fluid inside the resonator. Their vacuum-packaged resonator, with the solution with particles of interest held in microfluidic channels, can weigh single nanoparticles and bacteria at subfemtogram (10−15 g) resolution. A vacuum-packaged resonator has been designed that contains the solution with particles of interest inside microfluidic channels. It is demonstrated that this device can weigh single nanoparticles, single bacterial cells and sub-monolayers of proteins adsorbed on the channel walls with sub-femtogram resolution. Nanomechanical resonators enable the measurement of mass with extraordinary sensitivity1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Previously, samples as light as 7 zeptograms (1 zg = 10-21 g) have been weighed in vacuum, and proton-level resolution seems to be within reach8. Resolving small mass changes requires the resonator to be light and to ring at a very pure tone—that is, with a high quality factor9. In solution, viscosity severely degrades both of these characteristics, thus preventing many applications in nanotechnology and the life sciences where fluid is required10. Although the resonant structure can be designed to minimize viscous loss, resolution is still substantially degraded when compared to measurements made in air or vacuum11,12,13,14. An entirely different approach eliminates viscous damping by placing the solution inside a hollow resonator that is surrounded by vacuum15,16. Here we demonstrate that suspended microchannel resonators can weigh single nanoparticles, single bacterial cells and sub-monolayers of adsorbed proteins in water with sub-femtogram resolution (1 Hz bandwidth). Central to these results is our observation that viscous loss due to the fluid is negligible compared to the intrinsic damping of our silicon crystal resonator. The combination of the low resonator mass (100 ng) and high quality factor (15,000) enables an improvement in mass resolution of six orders of magnitude over a high-end commercial quartz crystal microbalance17. This gives access to intriguing applications, such as mass-based flow cytometry, the direct detection of pathogens, or the non-optical sizing and mass density measurement of colloidal particles."
https://openalex.org/W2171874894,"We conducted a genome-wide association study for type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Icelandic cases and controls, and we found that a previously described variant in the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) gene conferred the most significant risk. In addition to confirming two recently identified risk variants1, we identified a variant in the CDKAL1 gene that was associated with T2D in individuals of European ancestry (allele-specific odds ratio (OR) = 1.20 (95% confidence interval, 1.13–1.27), P = 7.7 × 10−9) and individuals from Hong Kong of Han Chinese ancestry (OR = 1.25 (1.11–1.40), P = 0.00018). The genotype OR of this variant suggested that the effect was substantially stronger in homozygous carriers than in heterozygous carriers. The ORs for homozygotes were 1.50 (1.31–1.72) and 1.55 (1.23–1.95) in the European and Hong Kong groups, respectively. The insulin response for homozygotes was approximately 20% lower than for heterozygotes or noncarriers, suggesting that this variant confers risk of T2D through reduced insulin secretion."

https://openalex.org/W2102337248,"The availability of iron limits primary productivity and the associated uptake of carbon over large areas of the ocean. Iron thus plays an important role in the carbon cycle, and changes in its supply to the surface ocean may have had a significant effect on atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations over glacial-interglacial cycles. To date, the role of iron in carbon cycling has largely been assessed using short-term iron-addition experiments. It is difficult, however, to reliably assess the magnitude of carbon export to the ocean interior using such methods, and the short observational periods preclude extrapolation of the results to longer timescales. Here we report observations of a phytoplankton bloom induced by natural iron fertilization--an approach that offers the opportunity to overcome some of the limitations of short-term experiments. We found that a large phytoplankton bloom over the Kerguelen plateau in the Southern Ocean was sustained by the supply of iron and major nutrients to surface waters from iron-rich deep water below. The efficiency of fertilization, defined as the ratio of the carbon export to the amount of iron supplied, was at least ten times higher than previous estimates from short-term blooms induced by iron-addition experiments. This result sheds new light on the effect of long-term fertilization by iron and macronutrients on carbon sequestration, suggesting that changes in iron supply from below--as invoked in some palaeoclimatic and future climate change scenarios--may have a more significant effect on atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations than previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W2102054988,"Using a forward genetics ENU mutagenesis screen for recessive mutations that affect circadian rhythmicity in the mouse, we isolated a long period (∼26 hr) circadian mutant named Overtime (Ovtm). Positional cloning and genetic complementation reveal that Ovtm is encoded by the F-box protein FBXL3, a component of the SKP1-CUL1-F-box-protein (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The Ovtm mutation causes an isoleucine to threonine (I364T) substitution leading to a loss of function in FBXL3, which interacts specifically with the CRYPTOCHROME (CRY) proteins. In Ovtm mice, expression of the PERIOD proteins PER1 and PER2 is reduced; however, the CRY proteins CRY1 and CRY2 are unchanged. The loss of FBXL3 function leads to a stabilization of the CRY proteins, which in turn leads to a global transcriptional repression of the Per and Cry genes. Thus, Fbxl3Ovtm defines a molecular link between CRY turnover and CLOCK/BMAL1-dependent circadian transcription to modulate circadian period."

https://openalex.org/W2099842423,"The first committed step in the biosynthesis of l-ascorbate from d-glucose in plants requires conversion of GDP-l-galactose to l-galactose 1-phosphate by a previously unidentified enzyme. Here we show that the protein encoded by VTC2, a gene mutated in vitamin C-deficient Arabidopsis thaliana strains, is a member of the GalT/Apa1 branch of the histidine triad protein superfamily that catalyzes the conversion of GDP-l-galactose to l-galactose 1-phosphate in a reaction that consumes inorganic phosphate and produces GDP. In characterizing recombinant VTC2 from A. thaliana as a specific GDP-l-galactose/GDP-d-glucose phosphorylase, we conclude that enzymes catalyzing each of the ten steps of the Smirnoff-Wheeler pathway from glucose to ascorbate have been identified.

Vitamin C (l-ascorbic acid) is well known as an important antioxidant and enzyme cofactor in animals (1Padayatty S.J. Katz A. Wang Y. Eck P. Kwon O. Lee J.H. Chen S. Corpe C. Dutta A. Dutta S.K.

Apparently, all plants are able to produce vitamin C and mutants completely deficient in synthesis have not been described, suggesting an essential role of ascorbate biosynthesis in these organisms (4De Tullio M.C. Arrigoni O. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although vertebrate vitamin C synthesis is restricted to one organ (liver in mammals and kidney in fish, amphibians, and reptiles) (5Chatterjee I.B. Science. 1973; 182: 1271-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 6Moreau R. Dabrowski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10279-10282Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), virtually all cells in plants can form ascorbate (4De Tullio M.C. Arrigoni O. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the few vertebrate species, such as humans, which lack ascorbate biosynthesis, loss of the pathway is compensated by dietary intake, particularly from plants.Different pathways of ascorbate synthesis have evolved in animals and plants. In animals, ascorbate is formed from UDP-d-glucuronate in a pathway involving d-glucuronate formation, reduction and lactonization of d-glucuronate to l-gulonolactone and oxidation of the latter to l-ascorbate (reviewed in Ref. 7Linster C.L. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Deficiency of the enzyme catalyzing this last step (l-gulonolactone oxidase) is responsible for the loss of ascorbate synthesis in the vitamin C-requiring vertebrates (8Nishikimi M. Fukuyama R. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Yagi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13685-13688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In plants, the ascorbate synthesis pathway has remained elusive until recently and alternative pathways may exist (9Valpuesta V. Botella M.A. Trends Plant Sci. 2004; 9: 573-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The Smirnoff-Wheeler pathway (10Wheeler G.L. Jones M.A. Smirnoff N.

In this pathway, GDP-d-mannose, formed from d-mannose 1-phosphate, is successively converted to GDP-l-galactose, l-galactose 1-phosphate, l-galactose, l-galactono-1,4-lactone, and finally to l-ascorbate.Screens for ozone-sensitive (17Conklin P.L. Williams E.H. Last R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9970-9974Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) or ascorbate-deficient (18Conklin P.L. Saracco S.A. Norris S.R. Last R.L. Genetics. 2000; 154: 847-856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana led to the identification of four loci (VTC1, VTC2, VTC3, and VTC4) involved in the maintenance of the vitamin C pool. Characterization of the vtc1 (19Conklin P.L. Norris S.R. Wheeler G.L. Williams E.H. Smirnoff N. Last R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

VTC1 and VTC4 encode GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase (19Conklin P.L. Norris S.R. Wheeler G.L. Williams E.H. Smirnoff N. Last R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The only step in the Smirnoff-Wheeler pathway that has not been identified with a gene product is the conversion of GDP-l-Gal to l-Gal-1-P.Here we show that the product of the A. thaliana VTC2 gene, which has previously been cloned (20Jander G. Norris S.R. Rounsley S.D. Bush D.F. Levin I.M. Last R.L. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), is broadly conserved in plants and in animals. On the basis of sequence similarity and enzymatic analysis, we characterize VTC2 as a histidine triad (HIT) enzyme of the GalT/Apa1 branch possessing a high GDP-l-Gal phosphorylase activity, which produces GDP and the ascorbic acid precursor l-Gal-1-P. This finding completes the identification of the ten enzymatic steps from d-glucose to l-ascorbate in the Smirnoff-Wheeler pathway for vitamin C biosynthesis in plants.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—ADP-d-Glc, GDP, GDP-d-Glc, GDP-d-Man, UDP-d-Gal, UDP-d-Glc, d-Gal-1-P, and d-Man-1-P were from Sigma. All of the sugar nucleotides and sugar phosphates were in the α-configuration. l-Gal-1-P, in the β-configuration, was purchased from Glycoteam (Hamburg, Germany). All other reagents were of analytical grade. Recombinant A. thaliana GDP-d-mannose 3′,5′-epimerase (GME) containing an N-terminal His tag was prepared as described (21Major L.L. Wolucka B.A. Naismith J.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 18309-18320Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) from a construct provided by Prof. James H. Naismith (University of St. Andrews, UK). GDP-l-Gal was prepared by incubating 0.94 mm GDP-d-Man with GME (46.5 μg/ml) for 5.5 h at 26 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After heating for 3 min at 98 °C, denatured GME was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant (containing 0.77 mm GDP-d-Man, 0.14 mm GDP-l-Gal, and 0.03 mm GDP-l-Gul) was used for determination of the kinetic constants of VTC2 for GDP-l-Gal.Cloning, Expression, and Purification of A. thaliana VTC2—The A. thaliana VTC2 coding sequence was amplified by PCR from a cDNA clone (U17921) provided by the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center at Ohio State University. This clone contains the coding region of the At4g26850 locus on chromosome 4 (GenBank™ accession number BT006589) and was prepared by the Salk Institute Genomic Analysis Laboratory (22Yamada K.

The forward and reverse primers were 5′-CACCATGTTGAAAATCAAAAGAG and 5′-TCACTGAAGGACAAGGCACTCGG. The PCR product was cloned into the Champion pET100/D-Topo vector (Invitrogen), resulting in a construct adding a 36-amino acid N-terminal extension (MRGSHHHHHHGMASMTGGQQMGRDLYDDDDKDHPFT) to the VTC2 protein. The DNA sequence of the insert was confirmed. The plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21 Star (DE3) cells and grown until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.5–0.6. Protein overexpression was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. After overnight incubation with shaking at 18 °C, cells were harvested, washed, frozen, resuspended in a pH 7.9 buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and lysed by sonication. Clarified lysate was loaded onto an Ni2+-charged column (Novagen, San Diego, CA) and eluted using a gradient of the resuspension buffer containing 5 mm to 1 m imidazole. Peak VTC2 protein fractions were pooled and buffer was exchanged to 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol in a 10 kDa cut-off Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter Unit (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Protein concentration was determined using a Lowry assay after precipitation with trichloroacetic acid. Purified enzyme was stored at -80 °C in 10% glycerol.Enzymatic Assays—Phosphorylase activity of purified recombinant A. thaliana VTC2 was assayed by measuring GDP formation after incubation with various GDP-hexoses in a reaction mixture at pH 7.5 containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm sodium phosphate, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Reactions (26 °C) were initiated with enzyme and stopped after 5 to 60 min by heating at 98 °C for 3 min. After removal of precipitated protein by centrifugation, supernatants were analyzed by anion-exchange HPLC on a Partisil SAX column (10 μm bead size, 4.6 × 250 mm; Alltech Associates, Deerfield, IL) using a Hewlett Packard Series II 1090 liquid chromatograph. A gradient of 0.01–0.5 M NH4H2PO4, pH 3.7, was used at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Nucleotides were detected by absorbance at 254 nm using a reference wavelength of 450 nm. GMP, GDP-hexoses, and GDP eluted at ∼13, 17, and 24 min, respectively. To assay the enzymatic activity in the reverse direction (hexose 1-phosphate + GDP → GDP-hexose + Pi), GDP-hexose concentration was measured by the anion-exchange HPLC method after incubation of VTC2 with various hexose 1-phosphates and 5 mm GDP as described above, except that sodium phosphate and MgCl2 were omitted. GDP and GDP-hexose concentrations were calculated by comparing the integrated peak areas with those of standard GDP or GDP-d-Man solutions.Mass Spectrometry—Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry was performed on a Voyager-DE STR MALDI-TOF instrument. GDP-d-Man, GDP-l-Gal and GDP-l-Gul were purified by reverse-phase HPLC (21Major L.L. Wolucka B.A. Naismith J.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 18309-18320Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) using an Econosphere C-18 column (5 μm bead size, 4.6 × 250 mm; Alltech Associates, Deerfield, IL). Fractions (15 s) were collected, dried, and resuspended in a solution of 0.29 m 3-hydroxypicolinic acid with 9 μm GDP as an internal calibrant in acetonitrile/H2O/trifluoroacetic acid (50/50/0.1, v/v/v). The samples were analyzed in positive ion mode and the mass accuracy was ∼10–30 ppm.RESULTSIn our study of aging in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, we became interested in the C10F3.4 gene that partially overlaps the pcm-1 gene encoding the l-isoaspartyl protein methyltransferase (23Kagan R.M. Clarke S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10794-10806Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We examined the deduced amino acid sequence of C10F3.4, and as shown in Fig. 1, found apparent orthologs in invertebrates, vertebrates, and plants, including the VTC2 gene product of A. thaliana. By performing PSI-BLAST analyses (24Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59167) Google Scholar) of the C10F3.4 and VTC2 gene products, we detected a low level of similarity with members of the HIT protein superfamily. HIT enzymes consist of nucleoside monophosphate hydrolases related to Hint, Fhit, Aprataxin, and DcpS and nucleoside monophosphate transferases related to GalT, the d-galactose 1-phosphate uridylyltransferase and Apa1, a diadenosine tetraphosphate phosphorylase (reviewed in Ref. 25Brenner C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9003-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In A. thaliana, the vtc2-2 and vtc2-3 missense mutations (20Jander G. Norris S.R. Rounsley S.D. Bush D.F. Levin I.M. Last R.L. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) map to either side of the HIT motif (Fig. 1). Since these mutants are vitamin C-deficient (18Conklin P.L. Saracco S.A. Norris S.R. Last R.L. Genetics. 2000; 154: 847-856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that a step in vitamin C biosynthesis is catalyzed by a HIT enzyme.HIT hydrolases and HIT transferases can be distinguished both by sequence and by enzymatic requirements. HIT hydrolases typically contain an active site motif including His-ϕ-His-ϕ-His, where ϕ is a hydrophobic amino acid. In contrast, the third His of the HIT motif is not conserved in HIT transferases and is frequently a Gln residue (25Brenner C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9003-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, plant VTC2 sequences have a His-Leu-His-Phe-Gln sequence, whereas animal VTC2 homologs contain a His-Leu-His-(Leu/Phe)-His sequence. All known HIT enzymes use the second His residue of the HIT motif to attack the nucleoside monophosphate moiety of substrates, forming a covalent nucleotidylylated enzyme. In the case of HIT hydrolases, the nucleotidylylated intermediate is labile to water, such that it rapidly decomposes to enzyme plus nucleoside monophosphate. In contrast, the nucleotidylylated intermediate of HIT transferases such as GalT and Apa1 is stable to water and awaits reaction with phosphate (phosphorolysis) or a specific phosphorylated substrate (transfer). Given the lack of conservation of the third His residue in the HIT motif of the plant VTC2 sequence and the requirement of an intact VTC2 gene for maintenance of the ascorbate pool in A. thaliana, we hypothesized that VTC2 may be a GDP-l-galactose phosphorylase that would produce l-Gal-1-P plus GDP in a reaction requiring inorganic phosphate. Despite evidence for the activity, the enzyme that forms l-Gal-1-P remained unknown (11Smirnoff N. Conklin P.L. Loewus F.A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 437-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), and it has been widely assumed that such an enzyme would simply hydrolyze GDP-l-Gal into GMP plus l-Gal-1-P (10Wheeler G.L. Jones M.A. Smirnoff N. Nature. 1998; 393: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar).To test the hypothesis that VTC2 catalyzes the phosphorolysis of GDP-l-Gal, we purified recombinant A. thaliana VTC2 as an N-terminal His-tagged protein from a bacterial expression system. Because the GDP-l-Gal substrate was not commercially available, we prepared it enzymatically from GDP-d-Man using the recombinant GDP-d-mannose 3′,5′-epimerase (GME) from A. thaliana (21Major L.L. Wolucka B.A. Naismith J.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 18309-18320Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) in a coupled assay. We measured the consumption of GDP-d-Man in the presence of VTC2 without and with prior reaction with GME and without and with Pi. In the absence of GME, less than 2% of the initial GDP-d-Man was consumed after a 10-min incubation with VTC2, even when Pi was present in the reaction mixture (Fig. 2C). GME catalyzes the reversible epimerization of GDP-d-Man to form GDP-l-Gal and, to a lesser extent, GDP-l-gulose (GDP-l-Gul) (21Major L.L. Wolucka B.A. Naismith J.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 18309-18320Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 26Wolucka B.A. Van Montagu M. J. Biol.

Wolucka B.A. Naismith J.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 18309-18320Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We confirmed this chromatographic separation with comparable elution times and an equilibrium product distribution of 82:14:3 for GDP-d-Man, GDP-l-Gal, and GDP-l-Gul (Fig. 2D), similar to that reported previously (80: 15:5; Ref. 21Major L.L.

Furthermore, we confirmed the identification of the GME products by UV absorption spectrum (identical to that of standard GDP-d-Man), as well as by mass spectrometry with the detection of a positive ion of m/z 606, consistent with all three nucleotide sugars.FIGURE 2Dependence of VTC2 activity on GME and Pi. GDP-d-Man (A) is not a hydrolytic (B) nor phosphorolytic (C) substrate of VTC2. The equilibrium reaction products of GME activity on GDP-d-Man (D), namely GDP-d-Man, GDP-l-Gal, and GDP-l-Gul are not hydrolytic substrates of VTC2 (E). However, VTC2 catalyzes a phosphate-dependent reaction that preferentially consumes GDP-l-Gal (F). In these experiments, samples were preincubated in the absence of VTC2 for 20 min at 26 °C in the presence of 0.14 mm GDP-d-Man with or without 23 μg/ml GME in a pH 7.5 buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. When indicated, sodium phosphate was added at a concentration of 5 mm. Incubations were then continued for 10 min at 26 °C with (B, C, E, F) or without (A, D) VTC2 at 6.5 μg/ml. The reactions were stopped by heating, and 60 μl of the deproteinized reaction mixtures were adjusted to 100 mm NaCl and analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC as described by Major et al. (21Major L.L. Wolucka B.A. Naismith J.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 18309-18320Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) with the exception that an Econosphere C-18 column (5 μm bead size, 4.6 × 250 mm; Alltech Associates, Deerfield, IL) was used. The results shown are representative of at least three independent experiments. Elution times for GMP and GDP were 21 and 43 min, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Addition of VTC2 in the absence of Pi had no effect on the concentration of the GDP-hexoses present in the GME reaction mixture (Fig. 2E). However, in the presence of Pi, VTC2 addition led to a decrease of the three GDP-hexose peaks and, significantly, a modification of the ratio of these peaks (Fig. 2F). After a 10-min incubation with VTC2 and 5 mm Pi, GDP-d-Man, GDP-l-Gal, and GDP-l-Gul were found in the ratio 97:1:2, indicating that VTC2 preferentially acts on GDP-l-Gal. The Pi dependence of this enzymatic reaction is consistent with the prediction from sequence analysis above that VTC2 is a phosphorylase rather than a hydrolase.To confirm the activity of VTC2 with GDP-l-Gal, we incubated VTC2 in the presence of Pi with the GDP-hexose mixture formed by reaction of GME with GDP-d-Man but under conditions where GME was inactivated by heating prior to the addition of VTC2. Under these conditions, VTC2 only affected the GDP-l-Gal concentration, which decreased linearly with incubation time (Fig. 3, A–D). Parallel analysis of the reaction mixtures by anion-exchange HPLC clearly showed that the consumption of GDP-l-Gal was correlated with the appearance of a peak eluting at ∼24 min and identified as GDP by UV spectrum and coelution with standard (Fig. 3, E–H). No formation of GMP was detected in these experiments and the production of GDP was precisely matched to the consumption of GDP-l-Gal.FIGURE 3VTC2-catalyzed phosphorolysis of GDP-l-Gal and formation of GDP. GDP-d-Man was preincubated for 30 min with GME and 5 mm sodium phosphate as described in Fig. 2. After removal of heat-inactivated (3 min at 98 °C) GME, GDP-hexose consumption and GDP formation were monitored after incubation for the indicated times with VTC2 (6.5 ng/ml). Deproteinized reaction mixtures were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC (A–C) as described in Fig. 2 and anion-exchange HPLC (100 μl samples, E–G) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A small amount of GDP (less than 1% of the total GDP-hexose pool) was detected at 0 min as a VTC2-independent hydrolysis product. The HPLC traces shown are representative of three separate experiments. In D and H, the concentrations of GDP-d-Man, GDP-l-Gal, GDP-l-Gul, and GDP are given as means ± S.D. values calculated from these experiments. Only error bars exceeding the symbol sizes are represented.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To characterize the substrate specificity of VTC2, we incubated several nucleoside diphosphate hexoses at a concentration of 1 mm for 10 min (26 °C) in the presence of Pi with or without VTC2 (32.5 μg/ml). NDP-sugar consumption (and NDP formation) were measured by anion-exchange HPLC. No phosphorylase activity was detected when UDP-d-Glc, UDP-d-Gal, or ADP-d-Glc were used as substrates and only a very low activity was found in the presence of GDP-d-Man. However, an almost total conversion of the NDP-sugar to NDP was observed with GDP-d-Glc in the incubation conditions used (data not shown).Kinetic analysis of the VTC2 phosphorylase activity confirmed that GDP-d-Glc is a good substrate for VTC2 (Table 1). A mixture obtained by GME incubation with GDP-d-Man (and subsequent elimination of GME) was used to determine the kinetic properties of VTC2 for the phosphorolysis of GDP-l-Gal, under conditions where GDP formation reflects only this reaction. VTC2 also exhibited a low Km value and a high turnover rate with GDP-l-Gal, the values obtained resembling closely those measured with GDP-d-Glc. GDP-d-Man, on the other hand, is a poorer substrate for VTC2 by a factor of ∼30,000 in the kcat/Km term (Table 1).TABLE 1Substrate specificity of the A. thaliana VTC2 phosphorylase Km and Vmax values were obtained by fitting the experimental data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the Km calculator of the BioMechanic program. Enzymatic turnover numbers were derived from the Vmax values by using a molecular weight of 53.1 kDa for recombinant His-tagged VTC2 with the assumption that the enzyme preparation is pure. Incubation times and enzyme concentrations were adjusted to obtain initial velocity data. Values are means ± S.D. calculated from at least three individual experiments for each substrate. Enzymatic activities were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and substrate concentrations ranged from 3.4-54 μm (GDP-l-Gal), 2.5-100 μm (GDP-d-Glc), 0.25-5 mm (GDP-d-Man), and 2.5-40 mm (hexose 1-phosphates).A.

Table 1 shows that the Km values of VTC2 for l-Gal-1-P and d-Glc-1-P are more than 3 orders of magnitude higher than for the corresponding GDP-sugar derivatives. The kcat terms for the reverse reaction with these hexose 1-phosphates are, however, relatively high (2–10-fold lower than those found in the direct reaction) and exceed by 2 and 3 orders of magnitude those measured with d-Gal-1-P and d-Man-1-P, respectively. Thus, VTC2 functions much better in the reverse reaction with l-Gal-1-P or d-Glc-1-P than with d-Man-1-P or d-Gal-1-P, confirming the forward reaction products and the specificity.DISCUSSIONOur demonstration that VTC2 catalyzes the conversion of GDP-l-Gal to l-Gal-1-P completes the identification of genes encoding the enzymes of the Smirnoff-Wheeler pathway of ascorbate synthesis in plants (Fig. 4). We characterize VTC2 as a GDP-l-Gal/GDP-d-Glc phosphorylase. The phosphate requirement of VTC2 and its production of GDP are consistent with the presence of a Gln residue at position 5 of the HIT motif (25Brenner C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9003-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Two well characterized HIT transferases are GalT and Apa1. GalT reacts with UDP-d-Glc to produce a uridylylated enzyme intermediate plus d-Glc-1-P. The uridylylated enzyme is then intercepted by d-Gal-1-P to produce UDP-d-Gal (27Frey P.A. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In the case of Apa1, the substrate is diadenosine tetraphosphate, which reacts to form adenylylated enzyme plus ATP. The adenylylated intermediate, stable to water, is phosphorolyzed by Pi to produce an ADP product (28Plateau P. Fromant M. Schmitter J-M. Blanquet S. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6892-6899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It can thus be predicted that VTC2, in the presence of GDP-l-Gal or GDP-d-Glc, forms a guanylylated enzyme intermediate at His-238, which is phosphorolyzed by Pi to yield free enzyme and GDP.FIGURE 4Smirnoff-Wheeler pathway from d-glucose to l-ascorbic acid. The forward, on-pathway reactions are depicted, with sugars in the d-configuration unless otherwise designated. The pathway begins with six steps used to produce GDP-Man and GDP-l-Gal for protein glycosylation and/or cell wall biosynthesis. In the seventh and committing step for l-ascorbic acid synthesis, the GDP-l-Gal product of GME is recognized by VTC2, the GDP-l-Gal phosphorylase, to produce l-Gal-1-P. In the eighth step, l-Gal is generated by VTC4, the l-Gal-1-P phosphatase. l-Gal is then oxidized to l-galactono-1,4-lactone and l-ascorbic acid by the NAD+-dependent and ferric cytochrome c-dependent enzymes, l-galactose dehydrogenase and l-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As shown in Fig. 4, conversion of d-Glc to l-ascorbic acid through t"
https://openalex.org/W2068007920,"Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are control elements in Wnt signaling, which bind extracellularly to Wnt ligands and regulate their ability to interact with signal transduction receptors on the cell surface. Sulf-1 and Sulf-2 are novel extracellular sulfatases that act on internal glucosamine-6-sulfate (6S) modifications within HSPGs and thereby modulate HSPG interactions with various signaling molecules, including Wnt ligands. Emerging evidence indicates the importance of reactivated Wnt signaling in a number of cancers, including pancreatic adenocarcinoma.Both Sulf proteins were upregulated in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma tumors and were broadly expressed in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines. Expression of human extracellular sulfatases Sulf-1 and Sulf-2 enhanced Wnt signaling in a reconstituted system. Three of four pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines tested exhibited autocrine Wnt signaling, in that extracellular Wnt ligands were required to initiate downstream Wnt signaling. Exposure of these pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells to a catalytically inactive form of Sulf-2 or siRNA-mediated silencing of endogenous Sulf-2 inhibited both Wnt signaling and cell growth. Sulf-2 silencing in two of these lines resulted in markedly reduced tumorigenesis in immunocompromised mice.We have identified the Sulfs as potentiators of autocrine Wnt signaling in pancreatic cancer cells and have demonstrated their contribution to the growth and tumorigenicity of these cells. Since the Sulfs are extracellular enzymes, they would be attractive targets for therapy of pancreatic cancer. Our results run counter to the prevailing view in the literature that the Sulfs are negative regulators of tumorigenesis."

These molecularly well defined TLR-L-peptide conjugates, constitute an attractive vaccination modality, sharing the peptide antigen and a defined adjuvant in one single molecule. We have analyzed the intracellular trafficking and processing of two TLR-L conjugates in dendritic cells (DCs). Long synthetic peptides containing an ovalbumin cytotoxic T-cell epitope were chemically conjugated to two different TLR-Ls the TLR2 ligand, Pam3CysSK4 (Pam) or the TLR9 ligand CpG. Rapid and enhanced uptake of both types of TLR-L-conjugated peptide occurred in DCs. Moreover, TLR-L conjugation greatly enhanced antigen presentation, a process that was dependent on endosomal acidification, proteasomal cleavage, and TAP translocation. The uptake of the CpG∼conjugate was independent of endosomally-expressed TLR9 as reported previously. Unexpectedly, we found that Pam∼conjugated peptides were likewise internalized independently of the expression of cell surface-expressed TLR2. Further characterization of the uptake mechanisms revealed that TLR2-L employed a different uptake route than TLR9-L. Inhibition of clathrin- or caveolin-dependent endocytosis greatly reduced uptake and antigen presentation of the Pam-conjugate. In contrast, internalization and antigen presentation of CpG∼conjugates was independent of clathrin-coated pits but partly dependent on caveolae formation. Importantly, in contrast to the TLR-independent uptake of the conjugates, TLR expression and downstream TLR signaling was required for dendritic cell maturation and for priming of naiöve CD8+ T-cells. Together, our data show that targeting to two distinct TLRs requires distinct uptake mechanism but follows similar trafficking and intracellular processing pathways leading to optimal antigen presentation and T-cell priming.

These receptors are important in sensing infectious agents through recognition of pathogen-associated molecules and act as a communicator between innate and adaptive immune responses. The receptors are expressed either on the cell surface or in the endosomal organelles. This compartmentalization of the TLR correlates with the type of ligands with which they interact. The TLRs expressed on the cell surface bind to extracellular components of the microorganisms (such as bacterial LPS to TLR4, bacterial lipopeptide to TLR2). In contrast, the TLRs found in the endosomes bind to ligands derived from intracellular molecules of the pathogen, such as unmethylated CpG DNA sequences to TLR9 and single-stranded RNA to TLR7 (1Kaisho T. Akira S. Microbes Infect. 2004; 6: 1388-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that ligands interacting with the latter type of TLRs are internalized independently of the TLRs (2Heit A. Maurer T. Hochrein H. Bauer S. Huster K.M. Busch D.H. Wagner H. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 2802-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Upon engagement of the ligand to its receptor, a cascade of intracellular signaling events is initiated that involves docking of different adaptor molecules such as MyD88 and TRAM to the TLR receptors and recruitment of proteins belonging to the IRAK-family, which ultimately culminate in the activation of the NFκβ transcription factor and gene transcription leading to production of proinflammatory cytokines (3Miggin S.M. O'Neill L.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2006; 80: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). DCs are both initiators and regulators of T cell responses (4Riezman H. Woodman P.G. van Meer G. Marsh M. Cell. 1997; 91: 731-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Dendritic cells constantly screen the environment for potential foreign antigens by a variety of mechanisms such as phagocytosis, macropinocytosis, caveolin-mediated, or clathrin-dependent endocytosis. The manner of uptake is dependent on the size and nature of material to be internalized (5Guermonprez P. Valladeau J. Zitvogel L. Thery C. Amigorena S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 621-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar, 6Xiang S.D. Scholzen A. Minigo G. David C. Apostolopoulos V. Mottram P.L. Plebanski M. Methods. 2006; 40: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). As specialized antigen-presenting cells, DCs have the capacity to efficiently process exogenous proteins and present the peptides in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, a process known as cross-presentation. In this scenario exogenously derived antigens are internalized and translocate from the endosomal route into the cytosol, where the proteasome complex processes the antigen. The generated peptides are transported from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum via the peptide transporter TAP (7Yewdell J.W. Reits E. Neefjes J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 952-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), after which the peptides undergo further trimming and are finally loaded onto MHC class I molecules, which translocate to the cell surface, where the peptide is presented to CD8+ T-cells. The ability of DCs to cross-present peptides on MHC class I to CD8+ T-cells together with the capacity of TLR ligands to deliver maturation signals has inspired efforts to explore the use of DCs as a vaccine vehicle in the fight against infectious diseases and cancer (8Schuurhuis D.H.

To explore the mode of action of TLR-L antigen conjugates, we have designed well defined synthetic vaccines composed of peptides containing the model antigen ovalbumin CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitope (SIINFEKL) chemically linked to either the TLR2-ligand, Pam3CysSK4, or the TLR9 ligand, CpG. These conjugates were used to study the uptake, intracellular routing, and processing. We show that not only TLR9-L conjugates but also the TLR2-L conjugates are taken up independently of TLR expression albeit through two distinct internalization mechanisms. Down-stream processing route for MHC class I antigen presentation, however, were similar and requires endosomal acidification, TAP translocation, and proteasomal processing. Importantly, whereas the uptake of both types of TLR-L conjugates was independent of TLR expression, priming of specific CD8+ T-cell response required TLR signaling in dendritic cells.

All peptides (see Table 1) were cleaved from the resin using trifluoroacetic acid/triisopropylsilane/H2O (95/2.5/2.5) for 2 h at room temperature, precipitated from diethyl ether, redissolved in 20% aqueous 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol, and purified by reverse phase HPLC and characterized using liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy and MALDI mass spectroscopy (see “General Methods”). DMT-based solid-phase phosphorothioate oligonucleotide (ODN) synthesis was performed on an Expedite automated instrument (Perseptive Biosystems) starting from Control Pore Glass support with the 3′-thiol modifier. The syntheses were performed on a 10-μmol scale according to established methods (22Grandas A. Marchan V. Debethune L. Pedroso E. Beaucage S.L. Bergstrom D.E. Glick G.D. Jones R.A. Current Protocols in Nucleic Acid Chemistry. 2003: 4.22.1-4Google Scholar). Elongation was performed using 3′-phosphoramidite derivatives of DMT-protected nucleosides 5′-DMT-A(TAC)-OH, 5′-DMT-C(TAC)-OH, 5′-DMT-G(TAC)-OH, and 5′-DMT-T-OH under the agency of dicyanoimidazole. After each coupling, remaining free 5′-hydroxyls were blocked using a capping solution (t-butylphenoxyacetic anhydride (Tac2O)/1-methylimidazole in tetrahydrofuran/pyridine) followed by sulfurization of the phosphite linkage to the phosphorothioate linkage using the Beaucage reagent. Next, the 5′-DMT protecting group was removed by trichloroacetic acid, after which elongation was continued. After final DMT removal the DNA oligomer was cleaved from the resin by 25% ammonium hydroxide solution to give a 3′-disulfide modified ODN (ODN-SS-propyl-OH). ODNs were purified on a Q-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated with 50 mm NaOAc applying a gradient of 2 m NaCl in 50 mm NaOAc. Fractions containing the pure product were combined and dialyzed three times with Millipore water using dialysis tubing with 1-kDa cut-off (Spectrum). Quantification was performed by UV absorbance at 260 nm. Sequences of the ODN prepared in this study were CpG, 5′-TCCATGACGTTCCTGACGTT-3′; GpC, 5′-TCCATGAGCTTCCTGATG-3′. Fmoc-deprotected peptide resin (200 mg, 30 μmol) was suspended in 2 ml of NMP, and 3-maleimidopropionic acid (5 eq, 250 μmol, 42.2 mg), HCTU (5 eq, 250 μmol, 103.2 mg), and N,N′-diisopropylethylamine (5 eq, 250 μmol, 42 μl) were added subsequently. The mixture was shaken for 2 h after which the resin was filtered, washed with NMP, dichloromethane, and dried. A 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid test indicated complete coupling. The products were processed as described under “Peptide Synthesis.” For CpG-OVA247–264, 3′-disulfide modified CpG-SS-propyl-OH (266 nmol) was converted to 3′-SH-modified CpG-SH overnight with dithiothreitol (DTT)-containing buffer (35 mg of DTT, 26 mg of NaOAc·3H2O, 1 ml of water). Dithiothreitol was removed from the mixture using a PD-10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) that was pre-equilibrated with 25 ml of a 50 mm phosphate buffer (25 mm Na2HPO4, 25 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA in water, continuously degassed with helium. Filtrate (3.25 ml) was directly transferred to a tube containing 5 mg of maleimidopropionyl peptide Mal-OVA247–264. The resulting solution was sonicated and placed under blanket of argon. The tube was sealed and shaken for 2 days at room temperature. The mixture was purified over a Superdex 75 gel filtration column using isocratic elution with 0.15 m triethylammonium acetate. Fractions containing the product were collected and lyophilized. Excess triethylammonium acetate was removed by lyophilization from water (3 times). Quantification was performed by UV absorbance (260 nm). CpG-OVA247–264A5K and GpC-OVA247–264 were prepared as described for CpG-OVA247–264 starting from the corresponding ODNs and maleimidopropionyl peptides. For Pam3CysSK4-OVA247–264, Fmoc-deprotected peptide resin (300 mg, 45 μmol) was suspended in 1.4 ml or 1:1 NMP/dichloromethane. Pam3Cys-OH (91 mg, 2 eq, 100 μmol) and PyBOP (benzotriazole-1-yl-oxytrispyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate; 80 mg, 3 eq, 150 μmol) were added. N,N′-Diisopropylethylamine (30 μl, 175 μmol) was added in two portions of 15 μl with an interval of 15 min, and the mixture was shaken for 4 h. 4The use of a large excess of N,N′-diisopropylethylamine (4 eq relative to Pam3Cys-OH) proved to be detrimental for the purity of the product as judged by liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy analysis. The resin was washed with NMP and dichloromethane and dried. A 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid test indicated complete coupling. The product was cleaved from the resin as described under “Peptide Synthesis,” dissolved in t-butyl alcohol/ACN/H2O (1:1:1), and purified on an Alltima CN column (10 × 250 mm, 5-μm particle size) with a gradient of A to B; C was kept isocratic at 10% (A, 1:1 CH3OH/H2O; B, ACN; C, 1% trifluoroacetic acid in 9:1 CH3OH/H2O). Pam3CysSK4-OVA247–264A5K and Pam3CysSK4C-OVA247–264 were prepared and purified as described above for Pam3CysSK4-OVA247–264 starting from the corresponding peptide resins. [Alexa488]OVA247–264—Fmoc-deprotected peptide resin (100 mg, 15 μmol) was treated twice with 2 ml of a capping reagent (0.5 m Ac2O, 0.125 m N,N′-diisopropylethylamine in NMP). A 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid test indicated complete acetylation. The cleaved and purified peptide (1 mg) was dissolved into 50 μl of buffer (300 mm NaHCO3 in 30% acetonitrile/water), and Alexa Fluor 488 carboxylic acid succinimidyl ester (0.3 mg) was added. Another 50 μl of buffer was added, and the mixture was shaken overnight. The product was purified by reverse phase HPLC (see “General Methods”). CpG-[Alexa488]OVA247–264 and GpC-[Alexa488]OVA247–264—Conjugate CpG-OVA247–264 (296 nmol) or GpC-[Alexa488]OVA247–264 (296 nmol) was dissolved in 50 μl of buffer (300 mm NaHCO3, 30% ACN in H2O), and Alexa Fluor 488 carboxylic acid succidinimidyl ester (1.0 mg) was added. The bright green mixture was shaken overnight. The mixture was diluted 5 times with H2O before being subjected to reverse phase HPLC purification. (Alltima C18, gradient of A to B; C was kept isocratic at 10%; A, H2O; B, ACN; C, 100 mm aqueous NH4OAc). Pam3CysSK4-C[BDP-FL]OVA247–264—Lipopeptide Pam3CysSK4C-OVA247–264 (0.46 μmol, 1.69 mg) and BODIPY-FL N-(2-aminoethyl)maleimide were transferred to a vial containing 0.5 ml of 50 mm phosphate buffer (25 mm NaH2PO4, 25 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm EDTA in 2:1:1 H2O/CH3OH /ACN). The mixture was sonicated and shaken for 60 h under argon. The mixture was diluted 5 times with 40:30:30 H2O/ACN/t-butyl alcohol, 1% trifluoroacetic acid before being subjected to reverse phase HPLC purification as described for Pam3CysSK4C-OVA247–264. SK4-C[BDP-FL]-OVA247–264—SK4-C[BDP-FL]-OVA247–264 was synthesized as described for Pam3CysSK4-C[BDP-FL]OVA247–264 using 50 mm phosphate in 3:2 H2O/ACN as a ligation buffer and SK4-C-OVA247–264 as the peptide substrate. Pam3CysSK4-C[Alexa488]OVA247–264 was synthesized as described for Pam3CysSK4-C[BDP-FL]OVA247–264 using Alexa Fluor 488 C5 maleimide as the reactive dye. IL-12p40 Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—DCs (4 × 104) were plated into a 96-well round bottom plate and incubated for 24–48 h with the compounds indicated in the legend to Fig. 1. Supernatants were harvested and tested for IL-12 p40/p70 content using a standard sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as previous described (23Schuurhuis D.H. Ioan-Facsinay A.

DCs were plated out into glass-bottom Petri dishes (MatTek) 2 days before the experiment. Cells were incubated either with the fluorescence-labeled TLR-L peptide conjugate or the fluorescence-labeled peptide at 37 °C for different time periods at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. In some experiments, as indicated, cells were coincubated with 1 μm Lysotracker for 5 min to stain endosomal/lysosomal compartments. In experiments with inhibitors, cells were preincubated for 30 min either with 50 μm MDC or 10 μg/ml filipin followed by extensively washing before incubation with the TLR-L conjugate either alone (pretreatment) or in the presence of inhibitors (coincubation). Cells were then washed and imaged using an inverted Leica SP2 confocal microscope. Dual color images were acquired by sequential scanning, with only one laser line per scan to avoid cross-excitation. The images were processed using the software program ImageJ. For analyzing the effect of the different compounds on dendritic cell phenotypic profile, DCs were incubated with the different compounds at a final concentration of 1 μm for 48 h. Subsequently, cells were harvested, resuspended in fluorescence-activated cell buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin), and incubated for 20 min with the following panel of monoclonal antibodies: fluorescein isothiocyanate-anti-CD86 (clone GL-1), phycoerythrin-anti-I-Ab (clone M5/114 15.2), phycoerythrin-anti-CD40 (clone 3/23), allophycocyanin-anti-Kb (24Stukart M.J. Boes J. Melief C.J. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 24-27PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice and fixed with 0.5% paraformaldehyde before being subjected to flow cytometry measurements. DCs were incubated for 2 h (unless stated otherwise in the legends to Figs. 6 and 8) with 1) the parent peptide (DEVSGLEQLESIINFEKLAAAAAK, OVA247–264A5K, or DEVSGLEQLESIINFEKL, OVA247–264), 2) the peptide conjugate, or 3) the mixture of the parent peptide and the Pam3CySK4 or CpG at the indicated concentrations. Cells were washed five times with medium before the T-cell hybridoma B3Z cells were added and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C.FIGURE 8Antigen presentation depends upon endosomal acidification, proteasomal activity, and TAP translocation. DCs were left untreated or pretreated for 60 min with various concentrations of 3 mm NH4Cl (A) and (B), or epoxomicin (C) before the addition of 0.5 μm CpG∼OVA247–264A5K (squares), 0.5 μm Pam∼OVA247–264A5K (triangles), or 0.01 μm OVA257–264 (circles).

In some experiments cells were preincubated for 30 min with titrated amounts of epoxomicin ranging from 0.01 to 10 μm epoxomicin or with 3 mm NH4Cl or preincubated for 60 min with titrated amounts of monodansylcadaverine (25–50 μm) or with filipin (10–20 μg/ml) before adding the peptide compound still in the presence of the inhibitors. Cell viability was confirmed by tryphan blue exclusion at the indicated concentration range of inhibitors. To determine the endogenous CTL response, five nmol of the different compounds were injected s.c. into naiöve C57BL/6 mice. After 10 days spleen cells were stimulated in vitro by plating 10 × 106 splenocytes with 1 × 106 mytomycin C (Kyowa)-treated (50 μg/ml for 1 h at 37 °C) and -irradiated (4000 rads) EG7 cell line (EL4-OVA) in the absence of additional cytokines. After 7 days viable splenocytes were isolated over a Ficoll gradient and stained for H-2Kb tetramer (TM)-OVA257–264, CD8b2 (clone 53-5.8) and propidium iodide to exclude dead cells as described previous (23Schuurhuis D.H.

An aliquot of spleen cells after re-stimulation and Ficoll purification (see above) were subjected to stimulation in vitro with or without 1 μg/ml OVA257–264 peptide (H2-Kb restricted SIINFEKL) overnight in the presence of GolgiPlug (BD Pharmingen). Cells were then washed twice with fluorescence-activated cell sorter buffer and stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated monoclonal rat anti-mouse CD8b2 antibody. Cells were subjected to intracellular cytokine staining using the Cytofix/Cytoperm kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (BD Pharmingen). Intracellular interferon-γ was stained with allophycocyanin-conjugated rat anti-mouse interferon-γ. All antibodies were purchased from BD Pharmingen. Flow cytometry analysis was performed using FACSCalibur with CELLQuest software (BD Biosciences). Splenocytes without peptide stimulation were used as a negative control. To monitor the uptake of the TLR-L-conjugated peptides and the free peptide in vivo, mice were injected s.c. either with 5 nmol of Alexa488 Fluor-labeled CpG∼conjugated peptide, 5 nmol of BODIPY-FL Pam∼conjugated peptide, CpG mixed with Alexa488 Fluor-labeled peptide, or Pam mixed with BODIPY-FL-labeled peptide.

https://openalex.org/W2080545551,"Chlorine in the Earth is highly depleted relative to carbonaceous chondrites and solar abundances. Knowledge of the Cl concentrations and distribution on Earth is essential for understanding the origin of these depletions. Large differences in the stable chlorine isotope ratios of meteoritic, mantle and crustal materials have been used as evidence for distinct reservoirs in the solar nebula and to calculate the relative proportions of Cl in the mantle and crust. Here we report that large isotopic differences do not exist, and that carbonaceous chondrites, mantle and crust all have the same 37Cl/35Cl ratios. We have further analysed crustal sediments from the early Archaean era to the Recent epoch and find no systematic isotopic variations with age, demonstrating that the mantle and crust have always had the same delta37Cl value. The similarity of mantle, crust and carbonaceous chondrites establishes that there were no nebular reservoirs with distinct isotopic compositions, no isotopic fractionation during differentiation of the Earth and no late (post-core formation) Cl-bearing volatile additions to the crustal veneer with a unique isotopic composition."
https://openalex.org/W2044691783,"Background Stem cell cultures are key tools of basic and applied research in Regenerative Medicine. In the adult mammalian brain, lifelong neurogenesis originating from local precursor cells occurs in the neurogenic regions of the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Despite widespread interest in adult hippocampal neurogenesis and the use of mouse models to study it, no protocol existed for adult murine long-term precursor cell cultures with hippocampus-specific differentiation potential. Methodology/Principal Findings We describe a new strategy to obtain serum-free monolayer cultures of neural precursor cells from microdissected dentate gyrus of adult mice. Neurons generated from these adherent hippocampal precursor cell cultures expressed the characteristic markers like transcription factor Prox1 and showed the TTX-sensitive sodium currents of mature granule cells in vivo. Similar to granule cells in vivo, treatment with kainic acid or brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) elicited the expression of GABAergic markers, further supporting the correspondence between the in vitro and in vivo phenotype. When plated as single cells (in individual wells) or at lowest density for two to three consecutive generations, a subset of the cells showed self-renewal and gave rise to cells with properties of neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. The precursor cell fate was sensitive to culture conditions with their phenotype highly influenced by factors within the media (sonic hedgehog, BMP, LIF) and externally applied growth factors (EGF, FGF2, BDNF, and NT3). Conclusions/Significance We report the conditions required to generate adult murine dentate gyrus precursor cell cultures and to analyze functional properties of precursor cells and their differentiated granule cell-like progeny in vitro."

However, the mechanisms that regulate CFTR recycling in airway epithelial cells remain unknown, at least in part, because the recycling itineraries of CFTR in these cells are incompletely understood. In a previous study, we demonstrated that CFTR undergoes trafficking in Rab11a-specific apical recycling endosomes in human airway epithelial cells. Myosin Vb is a plus-end-directed, actin-based mechanoenzyme that facilitates protein trafficking in Rab11a-specific recycling vesicles in several cell model systems. There are no published studies examining the role of myosin Vb in airway epithelial cells. Thus, the goal of this study was to determine whether myosin Vb facilitates CFTR recycling in polarized human airway epithelial cells. Endogenous CFTR formed a complex with endogenous myosin Vb and Rab11a. Silencing myosin Vb by RNA-mediated interference decreased the expression of wild-type CFTR and ΔF508-CFTR in the apical membrane and decreased CFTR-mediated Cl- secretion across polarized human airway epithelial cells. A recombinant tail domain fragment of myosin Vb attenuated the plasma membrane expression of CFTR by arresting CFTR recycling. The dominant-negative effect was dependent on the ability of the myosin Vb tail fragment to interact with Rab11a.

Furthermore, a recent study demonstrated that myosin Vb facilitates trafficking of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxasole propionate-type glutamate receptor subunit GluR1 in subpopulations of neurons by a Rab11-dependent mechanism (27Lise M.F. Wong T.P. Trinh A. Hines R.M. Liu L. Kang R. Hines D.J. Lu J. Goldenring J.R. Wang Y.T. El-Husseini A. J. Biol.

However, nothing is known about the role of myosin Vb in CFTR trafficking in human airway epithelial cells. Thus, the objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that endogenous myosin Vb facilitates CFTR recycling in Rab11a-specific apical recycling compartments in polarized human airway epithelial cells. We report that myosin Vb is required for the recycling of wild-type (WT) CFTR and ΔF508-CFTR to the apical membrane of polarized human airway epithelial cells in a Rab11a-dependent fashion. Cell Lines and Cell Culture—Calu-3 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were seeded at 2 × 106 on Transwell permeable supports (4.67 cm2, 0.4-μm pore size; Corning Corp., Corning, NY) coated with Vitrogen plating medium (VPM) containing Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen), 10 μg/ml human fibronectin (BD Biosciences), 1% purified collagen (PureCol™, Inamed, Fremont, CA), and 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (Invitrogen) and maintained as polarized monolayers in air-liquid interface culture as described previously (28Loffing J.

To increase export from the endoplasmic reticulum and expression of ΔF508-CFTR at the plasma membrane, cells were cultured at 27 °C for 36 h (21Swiatecka-Urban A. Brown A. Moreau-Marquis S. Renuka J.

Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells stably expressing WT-CFTR were a generous gift of Dr. Neil A. Bradbury (Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science, Chicago, IL) (33Silvis M.R.

COS-7 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in tissue culture dishes (0.75 × 106 cells/55-cm2 dish) in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 10% fetal bovine serum in a5%CO2 and 95% air incubator at 37 °C as described previously (35Fukuda M. Kanno E. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 403: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Calu-3 cells were studied because they express high levels of endogenous CFTR; however, Calu-3 cells are very difficult to transfect. CFBE41o- cells were used because they are isogenic except for CFTR, and they are relatively easy to transfect. However, CFBE41o- cells express WT-CFTR and ΔF508-CFTR transgenes; thus, studies on these cells do not examine endogenous CFTR. Finally, HEK293 and COS-7 cells were also used because they are very easy to transfect and are a well accepted model for conducting biochemical studies, including co-immunoprecipitation studies. However, because these cells are fibroblasts and are not polarized, their use was limited. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—RT-PCRs were conducted to examine the endogenous expression of myosin Vb in human airway epithelial cells (Calu-3 and CFBE41o-) and in HEK293 cells as described previously (29Swiatecka-Urban A. Boyd C. Coutermarsh B. Karlson K.H. Barnaby R. Aschenbrenner L. Langford G.M. Hasson T. Stanton B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38025-38031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from each cell line using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen Inc.) and treated with DNase (DNA-free, Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) to remove contaminating DNA. Total RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer, and the quality was assessed using an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer. Two-step RT-PCR was performed using RETROscript reverse transcriptase (Ambion, Inc.) with random decamers and Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen). Oligonucleotide primers flanking nucleotides 3692-4396 (sense, 5′-ACCAAGCCACGCAGAATAACT-3′; and antisense, 5′-GGACCGTGACCTGCCTGTTGA-3′) were designed using Oligo 6.1 primer analysis software and synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). These primers were used to amplify a single 705-bp myosin Vb PCR product. The product was subcloned into pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen), and the sequence was verified by ABI PRISM dye terminator cycle sequencing (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). RNA-mediated Interference—A sequence corresponding to a non-conserved region of human myosin Vb cDNA, 5′-AACGAGAATCTGGACCTTAAA-3′ (positions 4227-4248; GenBank™ accession number AB032945) (36Hirosawa M. Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Kikuno R. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1999; 6: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), was used as a target for the small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against human myosin Vb. The double-stranded siRNA against human myosin Vb (siMyoVb) was synthesized by Qiagen Inc. The double-stranded non-silencing control siRNA (Non-sil.siRNA) target sequence 5′-AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3′, which showed no significant homology to any other gene known analyzed using BLAST search. Non-sil.siRNA was purchased from Qiagen Inc. (catalog no. 1022076). Transfection of siMyoVb or Non-sil.siRNA into HEK293 and CFBE41o- cells was conducted using HiPerFect (Qiagen Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. HEK293 or CFBE41o- cells (1 × 106) were plated on 9.4-cm2 tissue culture plates and incubated with the optimized transfection mixture (5 nm siMyoVb or Non-sil. siRNA and 10 μl of HiPerFect) at 37 °C. After 24 h, the transfection mixture was replaced with fresh cell culture medium, and cells were cultured for different lengths of time. Because silencing of myosin Vb expression was maximum between 48 and 72 h, experiments were conducted at ∼60 h after transfection with siMyoVb. The efficiency of silencing myosin Vb expression was assessed by quantitative (Q) RT-PCR and Western blotting. The specificity of silencing myosin Vb expression was determined by examining the expression of myosin Vc, another member of the class V myosin family expressed in epithelial cells (37Rodriguez O.C. Cheney R.E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and by examining the expression of myosin VI, a myosin known to facilitate CFTR endocytosis (29Swiatecka-Urban A. Boyd C. Coutermarsh B. Karlson K.H. Barnaby R. Aschenbrenner L. Langford G.M. Hasson T. Stanton B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38025-38031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), by Western blotting. A pre-designed siRNA targeting another non-conserved region of the human myosin Vb gene (GenBank™ accession number AB032945) was purchased from Qiagen Inc. (catalog no. SI00653527). Because siMyoVb (target sequence 4227-4248) silenced myosin Vb protein expression more effectively than did SI00653527, siMyoVb was used in subsequent experiments. (Myosin Vb expression was 44.3 ± 10.4 and 17.2 ± 9.2% of the control after transfection of HEK293 cells with SI00653527 and siMyoVb, respectively, as assessed by Western blotting (n = 3 in each group).) Experiments were performed to silence the expression of myosin Vb in CFBE41o- cells cultured on Transwell and Snapwell permeable supports. CFBE41o- cells (1 × 106) stably expressing either WT-CFTR or ΔF508-CFTR were plated on 9.4-cm2 tissue culture plates and incubated with the optimized transfection mixture (10 nm siMyoVb or Non-sil.siRNA and 20 μl of HiPerFect) at 37 °C. After 24 h, cells were trypsinized and plated on VPM-coated Transwell or Snapwell permeable supports and cultured for an additional 6 days to establish polarized monolayers. CFBE41o- cells stably expressing ΔF508-CFTR were cultured at 27 °C during the last 36 h to increase trafficking and expression of ΔF508-CFTR in the plasma membrane. The efficiency of silencing myosin Vb expression in polarized CFBE41o- cells was assessed by Western blotting. Q-RT-PCR—Q-RT-PCRs were conducted to measure silencing of myosin Vb expression by siMyoVb. The sequence of human myosin Vb (GenBank™ accession number AB032945) was submitted to the Assays-by-Design services (Applied Biosystems) for the primers and probe design. The probe target was set to a predicted exon-exon splice junction. The probe was 6-carboxyfluorescein-labeled with a minor groove binding modification and non-fluorescent quencher on the 3′-end. The primers (18 μm each; 5′-GGAACCTGGTGACAGACTTGAAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCGGATGCACATGTAGAGGAT-3′ (antisense)), the probe (5 μm; 6-carboxyfluorescein-CTGTGCCCGACAGCAT (antisense)) combined with TaqMan Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), and cDNA were placed in triplicates in a 96-well format spectrofluorometric thermal cycler (ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system, Applied Biosystems). Q-RT-PCR products were size-verified on a low melting point agarose gel, subcloned into pCR4-TOPO, and sequence-verified by ABI PRISM dye terminator cycle sequencing. The standard curve prepared from the myosin Vb plasmid DNA isolated from HEK293 cells (not siRNA-transfected; control) demonstrated r2 > 0.99 and was linear over a 9-log range. Equivalent amplification efficiencies of standard and target molecules were observed. Gel analysis, SYBR Green melting curve dissociation analysis, and sequencing revealed a single PCR product. Raw data were analyzed; base-line and threshold values were set; and gene expression was interpolated using the standard curve. The cDNA generated during reverse transcription and used as a template was quantified using the NanoDrop spectrophotometer, and data were calculated as gene expression (fg/ng cDNA). The expression level of human myosin Vb is reported as a percent of the control. Plasmids and Transient Transfection—cDNA encoding the entire tail domain of mouse myosin Vb (referred to as MyoVb-T) and cDNA encoding a truncated globular tail region of the mouse myosin Vb tail domain (referred to as MyoVb-GT) were amplified from the mouse cDNA library by RT-PCR as described previously (38Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-GGATCCAGCTCCCCAGACAGCTACAGC-3′ (MyoVb-T sense primer), 5′-TCAGACTTCATTGAGAAACT-3′ (MyoVb-T/GT antisense primer), and 5′-CGGATCCGAAAAGCTGGAGAAGAATGA-3′ (MyoVb-GT sense primer). Addition of the FLAG tag to the N terminus of the myosin Vb constructs and construction of the expression vector pEF were performed as described previously (38Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 39Fukuda M. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Aimoto S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

The resulting fusion fragments consisted of part of the proximal/medial tail region and the entire globular tail region of the myosin Vb tail domain (amino acids 1231-1818; FLAG-MyoVb-T) and a truncated globular tail region of the myosin Vb tail domain (amino acids 1384-1818; FLAG-MyoVb-GT). A plasmid containing the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged tail domain of human myosin Vc (amino acids 902-1742; GFP-MyoVc-T) was generated using the eukaryotic expression vector pEGFP-C2 as previously described (37Rodriguez O.C. Cheney R.E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Constructs were sequence-verified by ABI PRISM dye terminator cycle sequencing. Transfection of cells with plasmids was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. HEK293 cells were transfected using Effectene® (Qiagen Inc.) or FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics), and transfection of CFBE41o- cells was performed using FuGENE 6 (29Swiatecka-Urban A. Boyd C.

The above cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Transfection of COS-7 cells was performed using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen), and the cells were harvested 72 h after transfection (35Fukuda M. Kanno E. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 403: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Production of Affinity-purified Antibodies to Myosin Vb—Two polyclonal antibodies against myosin Vb were raised in rabbits, antibody 2506 (against sequence QDSKKVQAEPPQTDIDLDPN, amino acids 1174-1193) and antibody 2507 (against sequence AGRNAEPNINARSSWPNSE, amino acids 1278-1296), in the proximal/medial tail region of the tail domain (PickCell Laboratories BV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). These myosin Vb sequences were absent in any other known genes as analyzed by a BLAST search. Rabbits were injected and boosted two times. The antiserum was affinity-purified, and the specificity of the anti-myosin Vb antibodies was determined by the ability of the antibodies to detect endogenous myosin Vb and the FLAG-tagged myosin Vb fragments. The selectivity of the antibodies for myosin Vb was determined by the ability of the anti-myosin Vb antibodies to detect silencing of endogenous myosin Vb. Other Antibodies—The antibodies used were as follows: rabbit anti-myosin Va antibody (41Espreafico E.M. Cheney R.E. Matteoli M. Nascimento A.A. De Camilli P.V. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. J.

https://openalex.org/W1982088748,"Little is known regarding the quaternary structure of cation-Cl– cotransporters (CCCs) except that the Na+-dependent CCCs can exist as homooligomeric units. Given that each of the CCCs exhibits unique functional properties and that several of these carriers coexist in various cell types, it would be of interest to determine whether the four K+-Cl– cotransporter (KCC) isoforms and their splice variants can also assemble into such units and, more importantly, whether they can form heterooligomers by interacting with each other or with the secretory Na+-K+-Cl– cotransporter (NKCC1). In the present work, we have addressed these questions by conducting two groups of analyses: 1) yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays in which CCC-derived protein segments were used as both bait and prey and 2) coimmunoprecipitation and functional studies of intact CCCs coexpressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Through a combination of such analyses, we have found that KCC2 and KCC4 could adopt various oligomeric states (in the form of KCC2-KCC2, KCC4-KCC4, KCC2-KCC4, and even KCC4-NKCC1 complexes), that their carboxyl termini were probably involved in carrier assembly, and that the KCC4-NKCC1 oligomers, more specifically, could deploy unique functional features. Through additional coimmunoprecipitation studies, we have also found that KCC1 and KCC3 had the potential of assembling into various types of CCC-CCC oligomers as well, although the interactions uncovered were not characterized as extensively, and the protein segments involved were not identified in yeast two-hybrid assays. Taken together, these findings could change our views on how CCCs operate or are regulated in animal cells by suggesting, in particular, that cation-Cl– cotransport achieves higher levels of functional diversity than foreseen.

Although very homologous to each other, the KCCs display variant affinities for each of the transported ions and for the drug furosemide. In addition, their transport capacity and response to various stimuli are not the same under controlled conditions. In Xenopus laevis oocytes, for example, heterologously expressed KCC2 displays higher Km values for Cl– but lower Km values for Rb+ compared with KCC1 and KCC3 (16Gamba G. Physiol.

Along the same line, KCC4 is less active than KCC2 at low levels of intracellular Cl– but more sensitive to phorbol ester-triggered events (26Bergeron M.J. Gagnon E. Caron L. Isenring P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15959-15969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, differences between KCCs and NKCCs are even more pronounced (4Gillen C.M. Brill S.

Several lines of evidence suggest that the NKCCs exist as homooligomers in cells. They are as follows. 1) The size of NKCC1 and NKCC2 has been found to increase by a ∼2-fold factor when membranes expressing either protein were treated with cross-linking agents (12Moore-Hoon M.L. Turner R.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3718-3724Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 28Ichinose M. Hall A.E. Cheng S. Xu J.Z. Hebert S.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 34AGoogle Scholar). 2) Through GST pull-down assays and yeast two-hybrid mapping analyses, the cytosolic carboxyl terminus (Ct) of the NKCCs was found to harbor two domains that are endowed with self-interacting properties, implying that these carriers could assemble into pairs of monomers (14Simard C.F.

Physiol. 2005; 126: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). 3) In heterologous expression systems, NKCC2 has been shown to coimmunoprecipitate with NKCC2 and NCC with NCC (29de Jong J.C. Willems P.H. Mooren F.J. van den Heuvel L.P. Knoers N.V. Bindels R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24302-24307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 30Starremans P.G.

The structural unit of the Na+-independent CCCs is currently unknown. Based on the oligomeric configuration of the NKCCs and a recent study by Blaesse et al. (31Blaesse P. Guillemin I. Schindler J. Schweizer M. Delpire E. Khiroug L. Friauf E. Nothwang H.G. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 10407-10419Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), 4While this work was under review, a paper published by Blaesse et al. (31Blaesse P. Guillemin I. Schindler J. Schweizer M. Delpire E. Khiroug L. Friauf E. Nothwang H.G. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 10407-10419Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) showed that the neuron-specific KCC2 behaves as a homooligomeric structure in HEK-293 cells as well as in the brain stem of mature rats. one might predict that each of the KCCs can also exist as homooligomeric units assembled through the distal portion of single monomers. At the same time, it is unclear that heterooligomeric associations between isoforms would be supported by the Ct given that the KCCs, although quite homologous to one another, have still diverged to some degree from a common ancestor. In this work, various studies were conducted to define the high order structure of the KCCs. In particular, we found that several of these carriers can assemble not only into homooligomers but also into functionally relevant heterooligomers enclosing different CCCs. Such findings bear great implications as to how CCCs actually operate in native tissues or as to how their inactivation in various disorders leads to specific phenotypes. They are also crucial from the perspective of drug development for individual CCC members. Supplies—Chemicals, reagents, or kits were from different companies and included monoclonal antibodies (Roche Applied Science and Amersham Biosciences), oligonucleotides (Sigma), enzymes/buffers used for cDNA constructions (New England Biolabs, Fermentas, and Invitrogen), the TNT rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega), the GST SpinTrap Purification Module (Amersham Biosciences), and the Yeast Matchmaker Two-hybrid System (Clontech). All cDNAs were propagated in XL1 blue cells (Stratagene). Constructs—All of the cDNA sequences and oligonucleotides used are listed as supplemental material in Table 1S. Several of these sequences (rabbit KCC1, rat KCC2, human KCC3A and KCC3B, mouse KCC4, and human NKCC1) were already cloned in the appropriate vector from previous work (13Isenring P. Forbush B. J.

Regions minimally required for the NKCC1-NKCC1 interaction to occur are shown in Fig. 1S (provided in this work as supplemental material), where they are aligned as scaled horizontal bars with the various CCC-derived protein segments used. Based on these alignments, corresponding regions in the KCCs were tested in yeast to determine whether they were also endowed with interacting properties. After we realized that they were not (see below), additional protein segments from the cytosolic Ct and amino terminus (Nt) were tested. In particular, the Ct-derived protein segments (some of which are also illustrated in Fig. 1S as scaled horizontal bars) were all longer than the deduced interacting regions except for one, and all belonged to a large domain that extends from transmembrane domain 12 to the end of the Ct. pGilda and pB42AD are the yeast vectors in which inserts were cloned; one has coding sequences for the LexA DNA-binding domain and a His transformation marker (TM), and the other has sequences for the activating domain of a transcription factor, the hemagglutinin (HA) tag, and a Trp™. The CCC inserts were obtained from several constructs by PCR through appropriate primers to which restriction sites were added. Final constructs were generated by cloning inserts in empty or insert-enclosing vectors through one or several ligation step(s). KCC4-(921–1057)/pGEX4T3—To generate a bait protein for GST pull-down assays, the insert of KCC4/Pol1 was cut with restriction enzymes (SacII at bp 1965 and XhoI at bp 3175), and one of the fragments (length 1206 bp) was transferred to the vector pGEX4T3 (between restriction sites SmaI and XhoI after blunting SacII with Klenow and dNTPs). The resulting construct was recut at two BsmI sites (to exclude a 2758-bp fragment encoding most of KCC4), and the vector-containing fragment, which encodes the distal Ct of KCC4 between residues 921 and 1057, was recircularized to generate KCC4-(921–1057)/pGEX4T3 (see bottom bar of Fig. 1S). CCCs in pCDNA3—To generate prey proteins for GST pull-down assays and to express KCC4 in HEK-293 cells for protein studies, two additional constructs were used. One of these constructs, termed NKCC1-(759–1212)/pCDNA3 and available from previous work (14Simard C.F. Brunet G.M. Daigle N.D. Montminy V. Caron L. Isenring P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40769-40777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), encloses a fragment that encodes residue stretch 759–1212 in the carrier's Ct. The other construct, termed KCC4/pCDNA3, was produced by transferring the insert of KCC4/Pol1 (previously tagged NH2-terminally with c-myc; see Ref. 26Bergeron M.J. Gagnon E. Caron L. Isenring P. J.

CCCs in Oocyte Vectors—Several constructs were used for protein analyses and functional studies in X. laevis oocytes. They were available from previous work (25Bergeron M.J. Gagnon E. Wallendorff B.

The inserts correspond to CCC-encoding sequences (cloned in Pol1 or pGEM-HE) and to the human Na+-glucose transporter type 1 (SGLT1)-encoding sequence (transferred for this work from PBS to Pol1 as an EcoRI fragment). The vectors, on the other hand, correspond to modified pGEMs from which stable cDNA-derived cRNAs can be produced in X. laevis oocytes. They contain a T7 bacterial promoter, a cloning site flanked by the X. laevis β-globin untranslated regions, a poly(A) tract, and an NheI linearizing site. A c-Myc epitope tag (MEQKLISEEDL) or HA epitope tag (MYPYDVPDYA) was added in front of several coding sequences through the following sequential steps: 1) by cutting these sequences (in their vector) at a restriction site “x” just before the first ATG and at a nearby downstream restriction site “y”; 2) by ligating the resulting fragments to a pair of complementary oligonucleotides designed to encode the tag in frame and to possess x- and y-compatible single-stranded cDNA ends once hybridized. The 5′–3′ restriction sites used for rabbit KCC1, rat KCC2, human KCC3A, and human SGLT1 were, respectively, XbaI-HincII, XhoI-NarI, XbaI-NsiI, and XmaI-EcoRI. Note that tagged mouse KCC4/Pol1 and tagged human NKCC1/Pol1 were already available from previous studies (26Bergeron M.J. Gagnon E. Caron L. Isenring P. J. Biol.

Yeast Two-hybrid Mapping Studies—Cotransformants were generated and analyzed as previously described (14Simard C.F. Brunet G.M. Daigle N.D. Montminy V. Caron L. Isenring P. J. Biol.

In brief, the following steps were pursued. 1) EGY48 yeast (Ys) were transformed with the p8op-lacZ Ura™-enclosing vector (which can encode Leu™ and lacZ through built in LexA-dependent operators) and were seeded on –Ura (–U) plates to generate YOULs. 2) YOULs were transformed with a CCC/pGilda and were seeded on –Ura–His (–UH) plates to generate YOULHs. 3) YOULHs were transformed with a CCC/pB42AD to generate YOULHTs, after which they were tested for their ability to grow on –Ura–His–Leu–Trp (–UHLT) plates or express β-galactosidase activity on –UHT plus X-galactosidase (–UHT + X) plates. Two procedures were conducted to establish whether the behavior of YOULHTs seeded on relevant plates could be ascribed to the occurrence of CCC-CCC interactions. 1) YOULHs were tested for expression of the hybrid protein and for autonomous reporter gene activation on –UHL + X plates. 2) YOULs were transformed with a CCC/pB42AD and tested for expression of a hybrid protein after selection of colonies on –UT plates as well as for autonomous gene activation on –UTL + X plates.

We showed earlier the presence of superparamagnetic magnetite in iron granules formed in honeybees, and subscribed to the notion that external magnetic fields may cause expansion or contraction of the superparamagnetic particles in an orientation-specific manner, relaying the signal via cytoskeleton (Hsu and Li 1994). In this study, we established a size-density purification procedure, with which quantitative amount of iron granules was obtained from honey bee trophocytes and characterized; the density of iron granules was determined to be 1.25 g/cm(3). While we confirmed the presence of superparamagnetic magnetite in the iron granules, we observed changes in the size of the magnetic granules in the trophycytes upon applying additional magnetic field to the cells. A concomitant release of calcium ion was observed by confocal microscope. This size fluctuation triggered the increase of intracellular Ca(+2) , which was inhibited by colchicines and latrunculin B, known to be blockers for microtubule and microfilament syntheses, respectively. The associated cytoskeleton may thus relay the magnetosignal, initiating a neural response. A model for the mechanism of magnetoreception in honeybees is proposed, which may be applicable to most, if not all, magnetotactic organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2145606026,"The heart forms from a linear tube that is subject to complex remodeling during embryonic development. Hallmarks of this remodeling are the looping of the heart tube and the regionalization into chamber and non-chamber myocardium. Cardiomyocytes in the future chamber myocardium acquire different cellular and physiological characteristics through activation of a chamber-specific genetic program, which is in part mediated by T-box genes.We characterize two new zebrafish T-box transcription factors, tbx3b and tbx2a, and analyze their role during the development of the atrioventricular canal. Loss- and gain-of-function analyses demonstrate that tbx3b and tbx2a are necessary to repress the chamber-genetic program in the non-chamber myocardium. We also show that tbx3b and tbx2a are required to control cell proliferation in the atrioventricular canal and that misregulation of cell proliferation in the heart tube influences looping. Furthermore, we characterize the heart phenotype of a novel Tbx3 mutation in mice and show that both the control of cell proliferation and the repression of chamber-specific genetic program in the non-chamber myocardium are conserved roles of Tbx3 in this species.Taken together, our results uncover an evolutionarily conserved role of Tbx2/3 transcription factors during remodeling of the heart myocardium and highlight the importance of controlling cell proliferation as a driving force of morphogenesis."

Although Cidea mRNA is not detectable in the mouse liver, we now show that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α ligands Wy-14,643 and ciprofibrate increase the Cidea mRNA level in a PPARα-dependent manner, whereas Cidea induction in liver by PPARγ overexpression is PPARα independent. Increase in Cidea mRNA content in liver did not alter the expression of uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) gene, which regulates thermogenesis, lipolysis, and conservation of energy. Although Cidea is considered to be a proapoptotic factor, Cidea induction in liver did not result in increased apoptosis. To elucidate the mechanism by which PPARα and PPARγ regulate Cidea gene expression in the liver, we analyzed the promoter region of the Cidea gene. Three putative peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs) are found in the Cidea gene promoter. Transactivation, gel-shift, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that the proximal PPRE in Cidea gene (Cidea-PPRE1 at -680/-668) is functional for both PPARα and -γ. We conclude that Cidea is a novel target gene for both PPARα and -γ in the liver where these two transcription factors utilize the same PPRE region for dual regulation.

PPARα is the master regulator of fatty acid oxidation systems and energy combustion, predominantly in liver, and also in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and heart (1Issemann I. Green S.

On the other hand, PPARγ, which is expressed at a relatively high level in both BAT and white adipose tissue (WAT), controls adipogenesis vis á vis energy conservation (6Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). PPARβ/δ is ubiquitously expressed and controls energy burning in extrahepatic tissues such as skeletal muscle (7Wang Y.-X. Lee C.-H. Tiep S. Yu R.T. Ham J. Kang H. Evans R.M.

Despite the high levels of homologies at the protein level, PPARs generally display distinct and non-interchangeable functional roles in overseeing the processes controlling mammalian energy balance. PPARs heterodimerize with the 9-cis-retinoic acid receptors (RXRs) and the PPAR-RXR heterodimer binds to peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs), consisting of a direct repeat of the consensus half-site motif (AGGNCA) spaced by a single nucleotide (DR-1) (8Kliewer S.A.

Unliganded PPAR-RXR heterodimers bind to these DNA elements in association with nuclear receptor corepressor molecules such as SMRT and N-CoR and repress transcription (9Guan H. Ishizuka T. Chui P.C. Lehrke M. Lazar M.A. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, PPARs manifest conformational changes that facilitate the dissociation of corepressor molecules to enable a spatiotemporally orchestrated recruitment of coactivators and coactivator-associated proteins to initiate transcriptional activity (10Reddy J.K.

In the mouse, Cidec/FSP27 functions as an adipocytespecific gene and its expression is regulated by C/EBP (CCAT/enhancer-binding protein) and in liver by PPARγ, implying that Cidec and possibly other Cide family members participate in adipogenesis (20Lin S.-C.

Recently, Cidea has received considerable attention because genetic deletion of this gene by homologous recombination resulted in increased lipolysis, heightened metabolic rate, and excess thermogenesis (19Zhou Z.

From these observations it is concluded that Cidea functions as a negative regulator of Ucp1 activity in BAT (19Zhou Z. Toh S.Y. Chen C. Guo K. Ng C.P. Ponniah S. Lin S.-C. Hong W. Li P. Nat.

In this study, we examined the proximal Cidea promoter region to elucidate the mechanism of increased Cidea transcriptional activation by PPARα and PPARγ. Cidea is undetectable in normal mouse liver but it is expressed at very high levels following treatment with PPARα ligands or with PPARγ overexpression. We show that a Cidea gene promoter contains a functional PPRE that is responsive to both these PPAR isotypes. Cidea induction in liver caused by PPARα ligands is not associated with enhanced apoptosis. Mice and Treatments—Wild-type (C57BL/6J) and PPARα-/- mice (3-4-month old) were kept on a 12-h light-dark cycle (23Lee S.S.-T. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L.

These animals had multiple liver tumors and one randomly selected tumor from each animal was used for Cidea expression. To assess whether Cidea induction in liver leads to increased apoptosis, groups of 5-8 wild-type mice were fed control diet or diet containing Wy-14,643 for 4 days and 4 weeks, then hematoxylin- and eosin-stained or TUNEL-stained (Roche Applied Science) liver sections were analyzed. RNA Preparation, RT-PCR, and Northern Blotting—Total RNA was prepared from mouse tissues using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was performed with 2 μg of total RNA with SuperScript™ III One-Step RT-PCR System using Platinum® Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) to amplify Cidea and Ucp1 coding sequences. Specific primers used to amplify the full-length coding sequence were Cidea-F/Cidea-R and mUcp1-F/mUcp1-R (see sequences in Table 1). Amplified cDNA was cloned into pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), sequenced, radiolabeled, and used as a probe.

A 5′/3′ RACE kit, essentially as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science) was used. Briefly, total RNA extracted from BAT was cleared of contaminating DNA by digestion with 5 units of RNase-free DNase (Ambion) for 1 hat 37°C. Purified RNA (3 μg) was reverse transcribed at 55 °C with recombinant transcriptor reverse transcriptase using Cidea-specific primer Cide-A(RACE)-1, which anneals 106 bp downstream of the Cidea translational start site. A homopolymeric tail was appended to the 3′ end of the synthesized first-strand cDNA using terminal transferase and dATP by incubation at 37 °C for 20 min as described in the RACE kit protocol. The dA-tailed cDNA was PCR amplified using an oligo(dT)-anchor primer and another Cidea-specific primer Cide-A (RACE)-2, which anneals 79 bp downstream of the Cidea translational start site. The amplified products were purified using a High Pure PCR product purification kit (Roche Applied Science) and cloned into the pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced to assign transcription start site. Promoter Sequence Retrieval by Computational Analysis—From the NCBI BLAST Mouse Genome Sequence data base, we selected 3004 bp of sequence upstream to the translation initiation codon (ATG) of the Cidea gene, which also includes a 79-bp coding sequence (GenBank™ accession number EF451058). Transcription factor binding site analysis was performed using MatInspector tool from Genomatix BiblioSphere and the presence of PPRE in the Cidea promoter was detected. Construction of Luciferase Deletion Plasmids—BAC clone (RP24-213P14), containing the full-length mouse Cidea genomic sequence was identified from the clone finder tool of Mouse Genome resources (NCBI) and obtained from the BACPAC resources, CHORI. The DNA fragment (∼3 kb), containing the Cidea promoter was amplified using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science) and designated pL-Cid1. Five different deletion fragments (see Fig. 3) were also generated using pL-Cid1 as template and subcloned into pGL3-basic vector (Promega). Restriction sites were incorporated into the primers used (Table 1, restriction sites are underlined). The primer pairs used for the amplification of all fragments were as follows: pL-Cid1, Cidea-1-NheI-F and Cidea-2-XhoI-R (or 1 and 2), likewise pL-Cid2; 3 and 2, pL-Cid3; 4 and 2, pL-Cid4; 8 and 2, pL-Cid5; 5 and 6, and pL-Cid6; 5 and 7. All amplified DNA sequences were cloned into pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced to ensure fidelity of PCR amplification. All DNA fragments with deletions were then retrieved from the pCR4-TOPO and ligated into pGL3-basic vector (Promega) and designated pL-Cid2 to pL-Cid6. For transactivation assays, nuclear receptor proteins overexpressed from plasmids pCMX-PPARα, pCMX-PPARγ, and pCMX-RXRα were used. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assays—HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For HepG2 cells this medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, and 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with 1.5 μg of DNA and 0.04 μg of pCMV-RL (Renilla luciferase) to normalize for transfection efficiencies. For control, equimolar amounts of promoterless, enhancerless pGL3-basic vector was used along with pCMV-pRL construct. After transfection cells were incubated in the presence or absence of ligands, Wy-14,643 (10 μm), or troglitazone (10 μm) for 24 h. Transfections were performed in triplicate and repeated twice. Luciferase activity was performed 48 h after transfection using the Dual Luciferase assay kit, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Luciferase activity of each construct was compared with that of the promoterless pGL3-Basic vector. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—DNA-binding dynamics of PPARα and PPARγ on the Cidea-PPREs were studied by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) with in vitro synthesized proteins and radiolabeled Cidea-PPRE double-stranded oligonucleotides. Mouse nuclear receptor proteins PPARα, PPARγ, and RXRα were synthesized using the TnT (transcription/translation)-coupled in vitro system (Promega). Oligonucleotides corresponding to the Cidea-PPRE1, -2, and -3 and for PPRE of peroxisomal bifunctional protein gene (HD-DR2) (see Table 1) were annealed and Klenow filled with dNTPs containing [α-32P]dCTP. Combinations of PPARα, PPARγ, and RXRα in unprogrammed reticulocyte lysate (as indicated) were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min in binding buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 250 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)·(dI-dC), 5 μg of nonspecific competitor DNA, and 20% glycerol. Radiolabeled Cidea-PPRE or HD-DR2 probe (1 ng) were added to the reactions (total volume, 20 μl), and incubated for an additional 20 min. Reaction mixtures were analyzed by electrophoresis at 4 °C on pre-run 3.5% polyacrylamide gels (30:1 acrylamide/N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide weight ratio) with 22 mm Tris base, 22 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA as running buffer. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay (ChIP)—Liver nuclei obtained from wild-type mice fed a control diet or a diet containing Wy-14,643 (0.125% w/w) for 4 days, and from PPARα-/- mice injected with Ad/mPPARγ1 for 6 days were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde and used for extraction of soluble chromatin as described (27Jia Y. Qi C. Kashireddi P. Surapureddi S. Zhu Y.J. Rao M.S. Roith D.L. Chambon P. Gonzalez F.J. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24427-24434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified liver nuclei were fixed for 30 min in 1% formaldehyde to cross-link the DNA-binding proteins to cognate cis-acting elements. Nuclear homogenates were sonicated to shear the chromosomal DNA to an average length of ∼1,000 bp. The chromatin was precleared by incubating with serum coupled to protein A-agarose beads saturated with bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) and salmon sperm DNA (0.4 mg/ml), immunoprecipitated with antibodies (1-2 μg/ChIP) specific to PPARα and PPARγ at 4 °C overnight. Protein-antibody complexes were pulled down with protein A beads coated with 1% bovine serum albumin, extensively washed sequentially by low salt wash buffer I (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), buffer II (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), and buffer III (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1), eluted and reverse cross-linked. DNA in the immune complexes was extracted and used as the template in PCR amplification using primers Cidea-PPRE1(ChIP)-F and Cidea-PPRE1(ChIP)-R that encompass the putative peroxisome proliferator-response element of the mouse Cidea promoter region. Cidea mRNA Is Induced in Mouse Liver by PPARα and -γ Ligands—By using cDNA microarray, we noted the up-regulation of Cidea gene expression in wild-type mouse liver treated with PPARα ligands (12Cherkaoui-Malki M. Meyer K. Cao W.-Q. Latruffe N. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Bradfield C.A. Reddy J.K. Gene Expr. 2001; 9: 291-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Likewise, adenoviral-mediated overexpression of PPARγ1 in liver also resulted in a manyfold increase in Cidea expression (13Yu S. Matsusue K. Kashireddy P. Cao W.-Q. Yeldandi V. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Gonzalez F.J. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 498-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). To determine whether the Cidea gene contains a PPRE(s), which may be responsive to PPARα- and -γ ligands, we first investigated the Cidea inductive effects in mouse liver following treatment with PPARα ligands Wy-14,643 and ciprofibrate, and PPARγ ligand TZD, using full-length RT-PCR amplified Cidea and Ucp1 cDNAs (Fig. 1A) for Northern blotting. All three ligands induced the expression of Cidea in wild-type mouse liver, but the induction was significantly greater with PPARα ligands as compared with PPARγ ligand TZD (Fig. 1, B, C, and F). Cidea mRNA is not detectable by Northern blotting in untreated wild-type mouse liver, but when induced by PPARα ligands, the mRNA level appeared similar to that found in normal BAT (Fig. 1, B, C, F, and G). The induction of Cidea in liver by PPARα ligands is dependent upon the presence of PPARα in that PPARα-/- mice failed to respond to Wy-14,643 and ciprofibrate (Fig. 1, B, C, and E). Basal Cidea mRNA expression was also found to be negligible or undetectable in the liver of PPARα-/- mice on Northern blotting. These data clearly suggest that transcriptional enhancement of the Cidea gene by PPARα ligands is due to activation of nuclear receptor PPARα and that the Cidea gene promoter would possess PPRE(s). However, the presence of PPARα is not a requirement with regard to the induction of Cidea mRNA by PPARγ overexpression (Fig. 1E). Although Cidea mRNA was not induced by TZD in PPARα-/- mouse liver (Fig. 1G), overexpression of PPARγ in these PPARα-deficient livers induced Cidea (Fig. 1E), implying that PPARγ is a limiting factor (28Hashimoto T. Cook W.S. Qi C. Yeldandi A.V. Reddy J.K. Rao M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28918-28928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). We observed a robust expression of Cidea mRNA in liver of PPARα-/- mice 6 days after injection with 1 × 1011 adenoviral-PPARγ1 particles intravenously, whereas untreated PPARα-/- mice or those given Ad/LacZ showed no Cidea mRNA expression (Fig. 1, E and G). Cidea protein interacts with Ucp1 and negatively regulates Ucp1 activity (19Zhou Z. Toh S.Y. Chen C. Guo K. Ng C.P"
https://openalex.org/W2019893071,"Ligation of CD40 in circulating cells or in the vessel wall may promote mononuclear cell recruitment, participate in the weakening of the plaque, and contribute to thrombosis. This process appears to be redox-sensitive, but the precise signaling mechanism by which the interaction between CD40L and its receptor CD40 mediates inflammatory secretion is unclear. Our previous studies have shown that the CD40-CD40L interaction modulates release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the current findings demonstrate that in endothelial cells CD40L dose dependently induces intracellular CD40L and MCP1 release in a redox sensitive manner. Pharmacological inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and p38 MAPK as well as adenovirus-mediated inactivation of Akt and p38 MAPK inhibited CD40L effects on endothelial cells. Akt, in particular, appeared to mediate CD40L-induced CD40L synthesis and MCP1 release by endothelial cells in a redox sensitive manner via NFκB activation. In addition, using confocal microscopy, exogenous addition of recombinant CD40L or adenoviral mediated CD40L overexpression was found to stimulate nuclear translocation of NFκB, which was further augmented by Akt overexpression and inhibited by Akt inactivation. These data support a mechanism whereby redox-sensitive CD40-CD40L interactions induce activation of Akt and p38 MAPK, leading to stimulation of NFκB and enhanced synthesis of CD40L and MCP1. Increased CD40L and MCP1 may contribute to the adherence of CD40-positive cells, such as platelets and monocytes, to the vessel wall modulating atherothrombosis. Ligation of CD40 in circulating cells or in the vessel wall may promote mononuclear cell recruitment, participate in the weakening of the plaque, and contribute to thrombosis.

Ligation of CD40 on vascular wall cells may promote mononuclear cell recruitment, participate in the weakening of the plaque, and set the stage for thrombotic events of crucial importance in the atherothrombotic process (1Mach F. Schonbeck U. Libby P. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 137 (suppl.): 89-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The activation of the CD40 receptor inhibits endothelial cell migration by increasing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 2The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; CD40L, CD40 ligand; sCD40L, soluble CD40 ligand; rsCD40L, recombinant soluble CD40 ligand; NFκB, nuclear factor κB; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; HEK, human embryonic kidney; Ad-β-Gal, adenovirus overexpressing β-galactosidase; Ad-dn-Akt, adenovirus overexpressing double negative Akt; Ad-myr-Akt, adenovirus overexpressing constitutively active Akt; Ad-dn-p38, adenovirus overexpressing double negative p38 MAPK; AdmCD40L, adenovirus overexpressing murine CD40 ligand; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; DCFHDA, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten. (2Urbich C. Dernbach E. Aicher A. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Circulation. 2002; 106: 981-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Thus, the blockade of endothelial cell migration by CD40L may critically affect endothelial regeneration after plaque erosion. This, in turn, may contribute to the development of acute coronary events in patients with high circulating levels of CD40L (2Urbich C. Dernbach E. Aicher A. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Circulation. 2002; 106: 981-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Platelets are recognized as a major source of soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L) in the circulation. Soluble CD40 ligand may constitute a molecular link between hypercholesterolemia and prothrombotic states (3Cipollone F. Mezzetti A. Porreca E. Di Febbo C. Nutini M. Fazia M. Falco A. Cuccurullo F. Davi G. Circulation. 2002; 106: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). High sCD40L levels are associated with increased expression of adhesion molecules and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1) along with impaired endothelial cell migration and enhanced superoxide generation by monocytes (3Cipollone F. Mezzetti A. Porreca E. Di Febbo C. Nutini M. Fazia M. Falco A. Cuccurullo F. Davi G. Circulation. 2002; 106: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CD40L-induced up-regulation of CD40L expression in human endothelial cells may also influence the progression of proinflammatory reactions, including atherogenesis, through activation of extravasating monocytes (4Wagner A.H. Guldenzoph B. Lienenluke B. Hecker M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Soluble CD40L and platelets may participate in a self-perpetuating pathogenic loop linking thrombosis and inflammation (5Aukrust P. Damas J.K. Solum N.O. J. Am Coll. Cardiol. 2004; 43: 2326-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that sCD40L influences platelet generation of reactive oxygen intermediates (6Chakrabarti S. Varghese S. Vitseva O. Tanriverdi K. Freedman J.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 2428-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, the signaling pathways linking thrombosis to ROS production in the endothelium are unknown (7Djordjevic T. Pogrebniak A. BelAiba R.S. Bonello S. Wotzlaw C. Acker H. Hess J. Gorlach A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 38: 616-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Notably, ROS such as superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide are transiently produced in response to growth factor and cytokine stimulation. Several lines of evidence also suggest that ligand-induced alterations in cellular redox state participate in downstream signal transduction (8Finkel T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 52-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). However, the signal transduction cascades activated by CD40L-induced ROS generation have yet to be defined. In endothelial cells, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway is activated following CD40-40L interaction and confers apoptotic resistance and triggers proangiogenic events, such as proliferation, migration, and vessel-like structure formation (9Deregibus M.C. Buttiglieri S. Russo S. Bussolati B. Camussi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18008-18014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Interestingly, high glucose-induced ROS generation has also been reported to activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and NFκB-related up-regulation of COX-2, which triggers the caspase-3 activity that facilitates human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) apoptosis (10Sheu M.L. Ho F.M. Yang R.S. Chao K.F. Lin W.W. Lin-Shiau S.Y. Liu S.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, the specific role and involvement of ROS-inducible Akt, p38 MAPK, and NFκB signaling following CD40 ligation in endothelial cells has not been reported. In the present study, we demonstrate that CD40-CD40L interactions in endothelial cells stimulate CD40L and MCP1 synthesis in a redox-sensitive manner via Akt and p38 MAPK activation. The activation of these specific signaling pathways leads to downstream NFκB activation. This sequence of events may contribute to atherosclerotic developments by augmenting recruitment of CD40-positive cells, particularly monocytes, through enhanced synthesis of CD40L and MCP1 in the endothelium. These events may subsequently contribute to other inflammatory conditions associated with high circulating sCD40L including in acute coronary syndrome and diabetes.

HUVEC Culture—Confluent HUVECs, which had been passaged 2–5 times, were used for experiments. Cells were grown in complete endothelial growth medium in 5% CO2 at 37 °C and switched to serum-free endothelial basal medium 18–24 h before study. Cultures were exposed to thrombin or rsCD40L dissolved in endothelial basal medium for different time periods in the tissue culture incubator. In a subset of experiments, cultures were treated with N-acetylcysteine for 1 h prior to rsCD40L treatment. For adenoviral infection, HUVECs were infected with the indicated adenovirus (multiplicity of infection = 50) for time periods ranging from 18 to 66 h. Cells were then washed twice with endothelial basal medium and subjected to various treatments. Infection with Ad-β-Gal was employed as a control. After various treatments, HUVECs were processed for immunolabeling or were lysed in BIOSOURCE (Invitrogen) lysis buffer for analysis of proteins using either ELISA or Western blotting. Alternatively, for the determination of phospho-p65 levels, HUVECs were lysed in nondenaturing lysis buffer supplied by Cell Signaling Technology. ROS Measurement—Following various treatments, HUVECs were collected by trypsinization, washed, and incubated with 20 μm 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFHDA) for 20 min. Intracellular ROS generation was assessed by flow cytometric monitoring of DCFHDA oxidation in a fluorescence-activated cell sorter instrument (Dako Cytomation). For specific studies, DCFHDA oxidation was also directly monitored for 1 h in a fluorescent microplate reader using excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 535 nm. HEK-NF-Luc Cell Culture—HEK-293 cells stably transfected with translucent NFκB response element (HEK-NF-Luc cells) were cultured in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 100 μg/ml hygromycin. All of the experiments were carried out with cultures that had reached 80% confluence. Cells were incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's minimum essential medium 18–24 h prior to the addition of the indicated treatments. HEK-NF-Luc cells were treated with 5 μg/ml rsCD40L unless otherwise indicated. At predetermined times after various treatments, cells were washed in PBS, and lysates were obtained for luciferase assays Alternatively, nuclear and cytosolic fractions were isolated using a nuclear extraction kit (Panomics) for Western blot analyses. In a subset of experiments, J558L cells were added to HEK cell cultures in 24-well plates after mild centrifugation at 100 rpm for 5 min. HEK-NFκB-Luc cells were then co-incubated with J558L cells for 6–7 h prior to luciferase activity assay. To assay luciferase activity, cells were lysed in a luciferase assay-compatible lysis buffer (Promega). Lysates (20 μl) were incubated with luciferase assay reagent (Promega) in a white-walled opaque microwell plate, and chemiluminescence was measured. Western Blotting and ELISA—Cell lysate protein concentrations were measured using the micro-BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Standard Western blot procedures were employed. Briefly, equal amounts of protein (20–50 μg) were electrophoresed on 12% precast polyacrylamide gels (Pierce) for 2 h at 60 V at room temperature. Separated proteins were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane at 110 V for 2 h at 4 °C. Membranes were then blocked with 5% milk in TBST buffer for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with primary antibody (anti-CD40L antibody, 1:200; phospho-p38 MAPK antibody (Thr(P)180/Tyr(P)182), 1:2000; phospho-Akt antibody (Ser(P)473), 1:1000; phospho-p65 antibody (Ser(P)536), 1:1000; phospho-IκBα antibody (Ser(P)32), 1:1000; p65 antibody, 1:200; histone H2B, 2 μg/ml; β-actin antibody, 1:5000); phospho-stress-activated protein kinase/JNK antibody (Thr183/Tyr185), 1:1000; JNK antibody, 1:1000 for either 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed with TBST buffer and incubated with secondary goat anti-mouse antibody (1:6000; Upstate Biotechnology) or goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:6000; Cell Signaling Technology). Histone H2B was employed as a loading control for nuclear proteins, and β-actin was employed as a loading control for whole-cell lysates and cytosolic extracts. ELISAs were performed to assess levels of CD40L and phospho-Akt, phospho-p38 MAPK, phospho-p65, phospho-IκBα, and phospho-JNK in the cell lysates. MCP1 levels from medium supernatants obtained from HUVEC cultures were also determined by ELISA. Kinase Activity Assay—For the determination of Akt and p38 MAPK activity, HUVECs were lysed in nondenaturing lysis buffer supplied by Cell Signaling Technology. Equal amounts of protein were then assayed for GSK3- and ATF-phosphorylating activity using commercially available kits (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Two-photon Confocal Microscopy—For two-photon confocal studies, HUVECs (passage number <5) were grown to confluence in two-well chamber slides (Lab-Tek, Nalge-Nunc International, Naperville, IL). Following various treatments, cell supernatants were removed, and cells were immediately fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were blocked in 3% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) in PBS for 60 min at room temperature and incubated with rabbit anti-p65 antibody (4 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in blocking medium for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were subsequently washed in PBS and incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG in PBS (1:200; Vector Laboratories) for 45 min at room temperature. Slides were then washed and incubated with AMCA (7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid)-conjugated streptavidin (5 μg/ml; Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 45 min. After additional washing with PBS, slides were incubated with Oregon green 488 phalloidin (6.6 μm; Invitrogen) for 20 min to visualize actin fibers. Afterward, slides were washed with PBS, and nuclei were counterstained with propidium iodide (3 μm; Invitrogen) in PBS. The labeled preparation was stored in PBS protected from light until further examination. All confocal images were captured within 2 h of labeling using two-photon confocal microscopy as described previously (6Chakrabarti S. Varghese S. Vitseva O. Tanriverdi K. Freedman J.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 2428-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). For J558L cell surface labeling of CD40L antigen, the same procedure was followed except the cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml CD40Fc (Axxora, San Diego, CA), followed by incubation with 10 μg/ml anti-human-IgG1 labeled with R-phycoerythrin (Axxora). In addition, cell nuclei were stained with Hoescht (0.5 μm; Invitrogen), and cells were coverslipped with mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). PTEN Activity Assay—PTEN activity in HUVECs was determined after 18 h of serum starvation followed by exposure to varying concentrations of rsCD40L for 6 h. PTEN activity was determined in a manner similar to that described earlier with some modifications (12Yu C.X. Li S. Whorton A.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 847-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Briefly, following treatment with rsCD40L, cells were washed with HEPES-buffered saline (Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A) (12Yu C.X. Li S. Whorton A.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 847-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations in the lysates were determined by a micro-BCA protein assay kit. For the determination of phosphate release, 4 μl of lysates were incubated in a total 40-μl volume of assay buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl containing 2 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 40 μm phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate diC8 (12Yu C.X. Li S. Whorton A.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 847-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Samples were incubated for 40 min at 37 °C. Reaction was stopped by adding 200 μl of BIOMOL green reagent (BIOMOL International, Plymouth Meeting, PA) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min for color development. The absorbance of the samples was measured at 595 nm in a microplate reader. Lysis buffer was employed as a control and subtracted from the respective sample values. The amount of released phosphate was quantified using a standard curve made with varying phosphate concentrations. Phosphate released from the samples was normalized with protein contents of the respective lysates. HUVEC lysates prepared following rsCD40L exposure were also subjected to Western blot analysis under denaturing conditions as described above. Transferred blots were probed with phospho-PTEN and PTEN antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), both at 1:1000 dilutions, before incubation with secondary anti-rabbit antibodies and developed as described above. Equal gel loading was confirmed by probing with anti-β-actin antibodies (1:5000; Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO). Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Analysis of differences between group means was evaluated with one-way analysis of variance. p < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. rsCD40L Induces ROS Generation as well as Redox-dependent CD40L Synthesis and MCP1 Release—CD40-CD40L interactions are known to elicit proinflammatory responses in endothelial cells and to enhance production of ROS. Treatment of HUVECs with 1 μg/ml rsCD40L elicited a marked increase in ROS, as measured by DCFHDA oxidation (Fig. 1A). This effect was abolished by co-incubation of cultures with anti-CD40 antibody, indicating that rsCD40L-induced increases in ROS are mediated by CD40-CD40L interactions. Exposure of endothelial cells to rsCD40L (Fig. 1B) as well as to thrombin (Fig. 1C) induced synthesis of CD40L in a dose-dependent manner, as measured by ELISA. To test the hypothesis that CD40L induces CD40L synthesis via a redox-sensitive mechanism, we examined rsCD40L-induced CD40L synthesis in the presence of varying concentrations (0–10 mm) of N-acetylcysteine, a thiol-containing antioxidant and scavenger of reactive oxygen species. Western blot (Fig. 1D) and ELISA (Fig. 1E) analysis of CD40L levels revealed that N-acetylcysteine attenuated CD40L synthesis in a dose-dependent manner. Release of proinflammatory cytokines, such as MCP1, is a well characterized effect of CD40 ligation (13Henn V. Slupsky J.R. Grafe M. Anagnostopoulos I. Forster R. Muller-Berghaus G. Kroczek R.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). Dose-dependent MCP1 release was observed in response to increasing concentrations of rsCD40L (Fig. 1F). Co-treatment with rsCD40L and thrombin further enhanced MCP-1 release (Fig. 1G). Similar to CD40L synthesis, CD40L-induced MCP-1 release was blocked by N-acetylcysteine (Fig. 1H). CD40L Induces Redox-dependent NFκB Activation—To understand whether CD40-CD40L interactions activate NFκB signaling, we employed a HEK cell line stably transfected with a translucent NFκB response element (HEK-NFκB-Luc cells). Treatment of HEK-NFκB-Luc cells with 2 μg/ml rsCD40L markedly enhanced luciferase activity (Fig. 2A). The nuclear translocation of NFκB p65 was also observed under these conditions (Fig. 2B). These results obtained with recombinant CD40L were verified with biologically active CD40L by employing a cell line stably expressing murine CD40L (J558L cells). J558L cells were labeled with CD40Fc and examined with two-photon confocal microscopy to verify the presence of cell surface CD40L (Fig. 2C, i). Co-incubation of CD40L-expressing J558L cells with HEK-NFκB-Luc cells led to a significant activation of NFκB, and this effect was dose-dependent (Fig. 2C, ii, p < 0.01). The effect of CD40L on NFκB activation in HUVECs was also examined. As shown in Fig. 2D, levels of phosphorylated NFκB p65 and IκBα in total cell lysates were markedly increased. To determine whether CD40-CD40L interactions trigger NFκB activation via a redox-sensitive mechanism, HEK-NFκB-Luc cells were treated with N-acetylcysteine (Fig. 2E) or with a cell-permeable scavenger of hydrogen peroxide (PEG-catalase) or superoxide (PEG-superoxide dismutase; PEG-SOD) (Fig. 2F) prior to rsCD40L exposure. All treatments blocked rsCD40L-induced NFκB activation (Fig. 2, E and F). Interestingly, pretreatment of rsCD40L with the cysteine cross-linking agent, N-ethylmaleimide, also diminished NFκB activation, indicating that the cysteine residues of CD40L might play a role in CD40L-mediated NFκB activation (Fig. 2G). rsCD40L-induced NFκB Activation Mediates CD40L Synthesis and MCP1 Release—To understand whether NFκB activation lies upstream of rsCD40L-induced CD40L synthesis, HUVECs were treated with rsCD40L in the presence of the NFκB inhibitor Bay11–7085 and the proteosomal degradation inhibitor MG132. As shown in Fig. 3A, pretreatment of HUVECs with both agents attenuated rsCD40L-induced CD40L synthesis. CD40L synthesis was also inhibited by the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitors puromycin and cycloheximide (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, all of these agents also eliminated MCP1 release, suggesting that CD40L synthesis and MCP1 release are coordinated through a shared signaling mechanism. To further confirm the effectiveness of NFκB inhibitors in the CD40L and MCP1 inhibition, corresponding cell lysates were analyzed for the extent of IκBα and p65 phosphorylations by ELISA. The results shown in Fig. 3, C and D, indicate that the protein synthesis and NFκB inhibitors used in the above studies were quite effective in blocking NFκB activation. However, MG-132, a proteosomal degradation inhibitor, did not decrease the IκBα phosphorylation but still effectively blocked NFκB activation, perhaps sequestering NFκB in the cytoplasm. It has been reported earlier that MG-132 inhibits NFκB activation without decreasing IκBα phosphorylation (14Guzman M.L. Neering S.J. Upchurch D. Grimes B. Howard D.S. Rizzieri D.A. Luger S.M. Jordan C.T. Blood. 2001; 98: 2301-2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that CD40L synthesis and MCP1 release as shown in Fig. 3, A and B, are mediated via NFκB activation. rsCD40L Induces Redox-dependent p38 MAPK and Akt Activation, Which Lies Upstream of NFκB Activation and CD40L Synthesis/MCP1 Release—Previous studies suggest that both p38 MAPK and Akt activations are associated with ROS. Thus, we examined whether these kinases were activated by rsCD40L. As can be seen in Fig. 4A, phosphorylation of both Akt and p38 MAPK was observed in HUVECs treated with 5 μg/ml rsCD40L. CD40L-induced phosphorylations of both kinases were diminished in the presence of N-acetylcysteine (Fig. 4, A and B). It can be observed from these figures that N-acetylcysteine had similar effects on rsCD40L-induced NFκB activation in HUVECs, as judged by NFκB and IκBα phosphorylation (Fig. 4, A and B). To test the hypothesis that CD40L-induced NFκB activation is mediated by Akt, HUVECs were infected with Ad-myr-Akt and Ad-dn-Akt prior to treatment with rsCD40L. The results revealed that Ad-dn-Akt blocked NFκB p65 phosphorylation, whereas Ad-myr-Akt enhanced it (Fig. 4C). In the same way, Ad-dn-Akt abolished NFκB p65 mobilization, as seen by immunofluorescent labeling (Fig. 4D). In addition, nuclear translocation of NFκB p65, as seen by immunolabeling, was readily apparent after rsCD40L treatment. The nuclear movement of NFκB p65 was found to be augmented by Ad-myr-Akt (Fig. 4D). The effect of dominant negative and constitutively active Akt on rsCD40L-induced CD40L synthesis was also examined. Adenoviral infection with dn-Akt attenuated CD40L synthesis in the presence of rsCD40L, whereas infection with myr-Akt enhanced it (Fig. 4E). Interestingly, Ad-dn-p38 MAPK infection in HUVECs also prevented rsCD40L-induced MCP1 release (Fig. 4F) and concomitant NFκB activation, as evidenced by attenuated p65 phosphorylation (Fig. 4G). Adenovirus-mediated CD40L Overexpression in HUVECs Activates Akt and p38 MAPK, Generates ROS, and Mobilizes NFκB in an Akt-dependent Manner—To confirm results obtained with recombinant CD40L on p38, Akt, and NFκB signaling, CD40L was overexpressed in HUVECs. As shown in Fig. 5A, infection of HUVECs with murine adenoviral CD40L (AdmCD40L) led to ROS generation. Notably, ROS production was attenuated by Akt and p38 MAPK inhibition with LY29004 and SB203580, respectively (Fig. 5A), as well as with Ad-dn-Akt and Ad-dn-p38 (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, AdmCD40L infection led to significant induction of MCP1 release in a redox-sensitive manner (Fig. 5C). Strikingly, co-infection of double negative Akt and double negative p38 MAPK eliminated the MCP1 release (Fig. 5C). In subsequent experiments, it was observed that CD40L overexpression spontaneously enhanced p38 and Akt activation (Fig. 5D). Additionally, CD40L overexpression enhanced thrombin-induced Akt and p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 5E) and activity (Fig. 5F). Inactivation of Akt via adenoviral means blocked p38 MAPK phosphorylation under these conditions (Fig. 5F). Conversely, inactivation of p38 had a negligible effect on Akt activation, suggesting that Akt lies upstream of p38 (Fig. 5, F and G). Importantly, inactivation of Akt impaired CD40L-induced NFκB nuclear translocation following thrombin stimulation (Fig. 5H). rsCD40L Attenuates PTEN Activity in HUVECs—PTEN is a member of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase family that reverses the action of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase by catalyzing the removal of the phosphate group of the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (15Cho S.H. Lee C.H. Ahn Y. Kim H. Ahn C.Y. Yang K.S. Lee S.R. FEBS Lett. 2004; 560: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). PTEN has been recently reported to undergo ROS-mediated oxidative inactivation, and its activ"
https://openalex.org/W2003023499,"The spontaneous emergence of phenotypic heterogeneity in clonal populations of mammalian cells in vitro is a rule rather than an exception. We consider two simple, mutually non-exclusive models that explain the generation of diverse cell types in a homogeneous population. In the first model, the phenotypic switch is the consequence of extrinsic factors. Initially identical cells may become different because they encounter different local environments that induce adaptive responses. According to the second model, the phenotypic switch is intrinsic to the cells that may occur even in homogeneous environments.We have investigated the ""extrinsic"" and the ""intrinsic"" mechanisms using computer simulations and experimentation. First, we simulated in silico the emergence of two cell types in a clonal cell population using a multiagent model. Both mechanisms produced stable phenotypic heterogeneity, but the distribution of the cell types was different. The ""intrinsic"" model predicted an even distribution of the rare phenotype cells, while in the ""extrinsic"" model these cells formed small clusters. The key predictions of the two models were confronted with the results obtained experimentally using a myogenic cell line.The observations emphasize the importance of the ""ecological"" context and suggest that, consistently with the ""extrinsic"" model, local stochastic interactions between phenotypically identical cells play a key role in the initiation of phenotypic switch. Nevertheless, the ""intrinsic"" model also shows some other aspects of reality: The phenotypic switch is not triggered exclusively by the local environmental variations, but also depends to some extent on the phenotypic intrinsic robustness of the cells."
https://openalex.org/W2016478018,"Background Late endosomes, the last sorting station in the endocytic pathway before lysosomes, are pleiomorphic organelles composed of tubular elements as well as vesicular regions with a characteristic multivesicular appearance, which play a crucial role in intracellular trafficking. Here, we have investigated whether, in addition to these morphologically distinguishable regions, late endosomal membranes are additionally sub-compartmentalized into membrane microdomains. Methodology/Principal Findings Using sub-organellar fractionation techniques, both with and without detergents, combined with electron microscopy, we found that both the limiting membrane of the organel and the intraluminal vesicles contain raft-type membrane domains. Interestingly, these differentially localized domains vary in protein composition and physico-chemical properties. Conclusions/Significance In addition to the multivesicular organization, we find that late endosomes contain cholesterol rich microdomains both on their limiting membrane and their intraluminal vesicles that differ in composition and properties. Implications of these findings for late endosomal functions are discussed."

It is unknown how caspase-8 is activated following T cell stimulation, and what is the caspase-8 substrate(s) that is necessary to initiate T cell cycling. We observe that following TCR ligation, a small portion of total cellular caspase-8 and c-FLIPL rapidly migrate to lipid rafts where they associate in an active caspase complex.

The lack of caspase-8 results in the absence of MALT1 and Bcl-10 in the active caspase complex. Consistent with this observation, inhibition of caspase activity attenuates NF-κB activation.

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 883-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) resulted in an immunodeficiency syndrome characterized by markedly decreased production of IL-2 and proliferative capacity of T cells. It remained uncertain from these studies how caspase activation was linked to T cell antigen receptor (TCR) ligation, what were the regulatory protein(s) and substrate(s) of caspase activity, and whether this required the presence of the death receptor Fas (CD95/APO1). Equally puzzling was how the activation of caspase-8 might be limited to avoid induction of apoptosis. We recently observed that following T cell activation, cleavage occurs of certain known caspase substrates, such as c-FLIP-Long form (c-FLIPL) and RIP1, although another caspase-8 substrate associated with cell death, Bid, was not cleaved (4Misra R.S. Jelley-Gibbs D.M. Russell J.Q. Huston G. Swain S.L. Budd R.C. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 3999-4009Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This suggested that active caspase-8 may become sequestered in a specific site within T cells after activation. We considered the possibility of c-FLIPL as both an activator of caspase-8 and an early caspase-8 substrate after T cell activation. c-FLIPL is homologous to caspase-8 in containing two death effector domains, but bears a mutation in the caspase domain, which renders it enzymatically inactive (8Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.-L. Schroter M. Burns K. Mattmann C. Rimoldl D. French L.E. Tschopp J. Nature. 1997; 388: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar). Following ligation of Fas, c-FLIPL is co-recruited with caspase-8 to the death-inducing signal complex (1Degterev A. Boyce M.

In addition, c-FLIPL is able to directly heterodimerize with and activate caspase-8 in its full-length form, independently of Fas (9Chang D.W. Xing Z. Pan Y. Algeciras-Schimnich A. Barnhart B.C.

Because CARMA1, Bcl-10, and MALT1 localize to lipid rafts upon TCR stimulation, we considered that the active caspase complex we had previously defined in activated T cells (15Dohrman A. Kataoka T.

In the current study, we demonstrate that resting T cells manifest low to negligible levels of active caspase-8, but this increases following activation of T cells in association with lipid rafts. TCR-induced caspase-8 activation occurs rapidly and in the absence of Fas expression. Concomitant with cleavage of c-FLIPL to p43 FLIP is the association of the active caspase complex with several members of the NF-κB activation pathway, including PKCθ, CARMA1, Bcl-10, MALT1, as well as RIP1, TRAF2/6, and the IKKα/β/γ complex.

T Cell Purification—Spleen and lymph node cells were isolated and disrupted through nylon mesh in RPMI 1640 with 25 mm Hepes (MediaTech, Herndon, VA) containing 5% (v/v) bovine calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). Erythrocyte lysis of splenocytes was performed using Geys solution. T cells were purified using negative selection by incubating splenocytes with anti-MHC II (M5/114/15/2), anti-CD11b (M1/70), anti-NK1.1 (PK136), and anti-B220 (RA3-6B2) on ice for 30 min. Cells were washed three times and rocked with goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rat conjugated magnetic beads at a 10:1 ratio of beads to cell (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) at 4 °C for 45 min. Magnetic depletion was used to remove bead-bound cells. Cells were washed and resuspended in culture medium (RPMI 1640, 2.5 mg/ml glucose (Sigma), 10 mg/ml folate (Invitrogen), 110 μg/ml pyruvate (Invitrogen), 5 × 10–5 m 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), 292.3 μg/ml glutamine (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 5% fetal calf serum). T Cell Culture—C57BL/6 and c-FLIPL-Tg T cells were activated in culture medium by plate-bound anti-CD3 (10 μg/ml, clone 145–2C11), anti-CD28 (clone 37.51) ascites (1:500), and recombinant human IL-2 (50 units/ml, Cetus, Emeryville, CA) for 2 days. Cells were then removed from anti-CD3 and supplied with fresh medium plus IL-2. For short-term activation studies, T cells were stimulated with soluble anti-CD3 (20 μg/ml) cross-linked with goat anti-hamster IgG (50 μg/ml, Caltag, Invitrogen) for 30 or 60 min. Purified CD8+ T cells were activated with anti-CD3 (5 μg/ml) and anti-CD28 (1:500 dilution of ascites). To measure NF-κB-luciferase activity, anti-CD3/CD28-activated T cells from NF-κB-luciferase transgenic mice were harvested after 48 h, washed with PBS, and lysed. The lysates were then analyzed using luciferin (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) and measured in a luminometer for 10 s. Four measurements were made for each sample. Results are presented as the mean (± S.E.) with background subtracted. CFSE Dye Labeling of Cells—Cells were washed with PBS plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and then mixed with 5 μm CFSE (Molecular Probes) in PBS plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were labeled at 107/ml for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed three times. A portion of the cells was incubated overnight at 37 °C to serve as a non-cycling control for flow cytometry, and the remaining cells were stimulated. Immunoblot Analysis—T cells were lysed in buffer containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) (American Bioanalytical, Natick, MA), 2 mm sodium orthovanadate (Sigma), 10% glycerol (Fisher), 150 mm NaCl (Sigma), complete protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics), and 20 μm z-VAD-fmk (MP Biomedicals). Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Protein lysates were boiled for 5 min in loading buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol and separated using SDS-PAGE on 8, 10, or 12.5% gels. Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) and blocked using 4% milk in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween 20 (American Bioanalytical) at room temperature for 1 h. Membranes were incubated at 4 °C overnight in milk containing one of the following primary detection antibodies: paxillin (clone 165, BD Biosciences), cholera toxin B subunit (Sigma), Bcl-10 (clone H-197, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), CARMA1 (catalog number 3189, ProSci, Poway, CA), caspase-8 (a kind gift of Dr. Andreas Strasser, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia), IKKα (catalog number 2682, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), IKKβ (catalog number 2684, Cell Signaling Technology), IKKγ (clone FL-419, Santa Cruz), LAT (catalog number 06-807, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), RIP1 (clone 38, BD Biosciences), TRAF2 (catalog number 592, MBL, Woburn, MA), TRAF6 (catalog number 597, MBL), FLIP (clone Dave-2, Axxora, San Diego, CA), and MALT1 (C terminus-specific, a generous gift from Dr. Vishva Dixit, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-labeled conjugates (Santa Cruz; Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL; Biomeda, Foster City, CA; and Jackson ImmunoResearch) and developed using LumiGLO (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD). Immunoblot membranes were treated with azide, washed, and reprobed with another antibody to ensure valid comparisons among the same set of samples. Biotin-VAD-fmk Treatment and Caspase Precipitation Assay—T cells were incubated in culture medium plus recombinant human IL-2 with 10 μm biotin-VAD-fmk (MP Biomedicals) at 37 °C for 15 min. As a negative control, a portion of T cells was incubated with 100 μm non-biotinylated z-VAD-fmk prior to incubation with biotin-VAD-fmk (not shown). Cells for unfractionated lysates were lysed in buffer containing 20 μm biotin-VAD-fmk. 600 μg of unfractionated lysate or 800 μl of cytosolic and lipid raft fractions (see below) were precleared by rocking with 40 μl of Sepharose 6B-agarose beads (Sigma) at 4 °C for 2 h. Supernatants were then rocked with 60 μl of streptavidin-Sepharose beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc. and Invitrogen) at 4 °C overnight. Beads were washed 5 times in lysis buffer without protease inhibitor, then boiled in loading buffer. Beads were removed by centrifugation and immunoblot analysis was then performed on supernatants. Lipid Raft and Cytosolic Fraction Isolation—As described previously, T cells were washed twice in cold PBS, then lysed in TNE buffer (5 mm iodoacetic acid (Pierce), 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm EDTA (Sigma), 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)) supplemented with 0.5% Triton X-100, and 100 mm Na2CO3 (Sigma) for 30 min on ice (26Muppidi J.R. Siegel R.M. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 182-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Lysates were then sonicated three times for 10 s each and rested on ice for 10 min. Lysates were mixed with Opti-Prep™ sucrose substitute (Sigma) to a final concentration of 40%. OptiPrep was diluted to 30 or 5% by mixing with TNE buffer. The 40% OptiPrep/cell lysate mixture was placed in an ultracentrifuge tube and the 30 and 5% solutions were layered over the 40% solution. Gradients were centrifuged overnight at 4 °C at 200,000 × g. Twelve sequential 1-ml fractions were taken, starting with the top layer. A portion of each fraction was used for active caspase precipitation and another portion was used for immunoblot analysis. Caspase Activity Assay—Relative caspase activities were determined using the Apo-ONE Caspase-3/7 Assay (Promega). Fresh or day 4 effector T cells were resuspended in culture medium at 10 × 106/ml. Cells were serially diluted in culture medium and then mixed with 100 μl of caspase reagent (DEVD-rhodamine) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Spectrophotometric readings were taken over a range of times. The data shown represent readings at 5 h for fresh and 90 min for effector populations. Cholesterol Depletion—Fresh and day 4 wild-type effector T cells were washed with serum-free medium, resuspended in serum-free media containing glucose, 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1.5% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma), and warmed for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then treated with methyl-β-cyclodextran (MBCD, Sigma) at a final concentration of 20 mm for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed with fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin media, and lipid rafts isolated. Fresh cells were then activated using soluble anti-CD3 cross-linked with goat anti-hamster IgG for 60 min. Following MBCD treatment fresh, 60-min stimulated and effector T cells were washed with room temperature PBS prior to lysis in biotin-VAD-fmk-containing buffer. Active Caspase-8 and c-FLIP Are Found in Lipid Rafts of Activated T Cells—The levels of total cellular caspase-8 are equivalent between resting and effector T cells, and caspase-8 activation following TCR stimulation does not result in cell death but rather, is necessary to initiate cell cycling (3Kennedy N.J. Kataoka T. Tschopp J. Budd R.C. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1891-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 4Misra R.S. Jelley-Gibbs D.M. Russell J.Q. Huston G. Swain S.L. Budd R.C. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 3999-4009Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To achieve separation of caspase-mediated death from proliferation, we considered whether TCR-initiated caspase-8 activation might occur in a sequestered location. Because many signaling events triggered by TCR activation occur in lipid rafts, and lipid rafts are stable through the effector T cell stage (27Balamuth F. Leitenberg D. Unternaehrer J. Mellman I. Bottomly K. Immunity. 2001; 15: 729-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), we examined the possible migration of caspase-8 and c-FLIPL to this compartment. Cell lysates were mixed with OptiPrep sucrose substitute and overlaid with a discontinuous OptiPrep gradient followed by ultracentrifugation overnight (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Twelve 1-ml fractions were taken and immunoblots performed for paxillin, a non-raft cytosolic component, and the ganglioside, GM1, which localizes in part to lipid rafts in resting T cells (Fig. 1A) (28Blank N. Gabler C. Schiller M. Kriegel M. Kalden J.R. Lorenz H.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 271: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Based on these reference molecules, fractions 3 and 4 were observed to contain lipid rafts, whereas fractions 9–12 contained the cytosolic components (Fig. 1A, top panels). Examination of fresh wild-type T cells revealed that essentially all caspase-8 and c-FLIPL were localized to the non-raft cytosolic fractions. Fresh c-FLIPL-Tg T cells contained a small but reproducibly detectable amount of caspase-8 and c-FLIPL in the lipid raft fractions. This parallels previous observations that resting c-FLIPL-Tg T cells manifest spontaneous caspase activity (15Dohrman A. Kataoka T. Cuenin S. Russell J.Q. Tschopp J. Budd R.C. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 5270-5278Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and that c-FLIPL heterodimerizes with and activates caspase-8 (10Micheau O. Thome M. Schneider P. Holler N. Tschopp J.

Tschopp J. Budd R.C. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast to fresh T cells, day 4 effector T cells from both wild-type and c-FLIPL-Tg T cells manifested within the lipid raft fraction increased an amount of full-length and processed caspase-8 and c-FLIPL. Both caspase-8 and c-FLIPL contain known caspase-8 cleavage sites in their C-terminal domains that yield processed p43 caspase-8 and p43 FLIP (10Micheau O. Thome M. Schneider P. Holler N. Tschopp J. Nicholson D.W. Briand C. Grutter M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45162-45171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Notably, the relative proportion of processed to uncleaved caspase-8 and c-FLIP was substantially higher in the lipid raft fraction compared with the cytosolic component of effector T cells (Fig. 1A). These findings suggested that active caspase-8 might be enriched in the raft fraction. To examine this more definitively, wild-type fresh and day 4 effector T cells were treated with biotin-VAD-fmk prior to lysis and then fractionated into raft and cytosolic components. Protein content in lipid rafts from fresh and effector populations was comparable (data not shown). Fractions were then individually precipitated with streptavidin-Sepharose beads, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted to reveal active caspase-8. As shown in Fig. 1B, no active caspase-8 was detected in fresh T cells in either the raft or cytosolic fractions. However, in day 4 effector T cells, both active full-length caspase-8 and p43 caspase-8 were precipitated exclusively from lipid raft fraction 4 (Fig. 1B), even though the vast majority of caspase-8 still resided in cytosolic fractions 10 and 11 (Fig. 1A, lower left panels). In addition, c-FLIPL co-precipitated with the active caspase complex in lipid rafts, the majority of which was processed to p43 FLIP despite the reverse ratio in the whole cell lysate (Fig. 1B, lower panel). This is consistent with the view that caspase activity was concentrated in the lipid raft fraction. Thus, c-FLIPL and caspase-8 migrate to lipid rafts following TCR ligation, and this accompanies the activation of caspase-8 and cleavage of c-FLIPL. NF-κB Signaling Molecules Migrate to Lipid Rafts and Associate with Active Caspases—We (15Dohrman A. Kataoka T. Cuenin S. Russell J.Q. Tschopp J. Budd R.C. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 5270-5278Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and others (30Kataoka T. Tschopp J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2627-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) have previously observed that processed p43 FLIP can associate with the adaptor proteins, TRAF2 and RIP1, to promote activation of NF-κB. An additional pathway linking TCR triggering to NF-κB activation has been defined more recently to include PKCθ, CARMA1, MALT1, and Bcl-10 (31Thome M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 348-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Given that caspase activity is necessary for optimal NF-κB signaling in T cells (6Su H. Bidere N. Zheng L. Cubre A. Sakai K.

Lipid raft and cytosolic fractions were thus prepared from wild-type fresh and day 4 effector T cells and immunoblotted for molecules linked to the NF-κB pathway.

Ultimately, these cellular behaviors are synchronized to produce a tissue response, but how this is achieved remains enigmatic. Here, we investigated the genetic basis for mechanotransduction using the bone marrow as a model system. We found that physical stimuli produced a pattern of principal strain that precisely corresponded to the site-specific expression of sox9 and runx2, two transcription factors required for the commitment of stem cells to a skeletogenic lineage, and the arrangement and orientation of newly deposited type I collagen fibrils. To gain insights into the genetic basis for skeletal mechanotransduction we conditionally inactivated focal adhesion kinase (FAK), an intracellular component of the integrin signaling pathway. By doing so we abolished the mechanically induced osteogenic response and thus identified a critical genetic component of the molecular machinery required for mechanotransduction. Our data provide a new framework in which to consider how physical forces and molecular signals are synchronized during the program of skeletal regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2081184793,"Social brain function, which allows us to adapt our behavior to social context, is poorly understood at the single-cell level due largely to technical limitations. But the questions involved are vital: How do neurons recognize and modulate their activity in response to social context? To probe the mechanisms involved, we developed a novel recording technique, called multi-dimensional recording, and applied it simultaneously in the left parietal cortices of two monkeys while they shared a common social space. When the monkeys sat near each other but did not interact, each monkey's parietal activity showed robust response preference to action by his own right arm and almost no response to action by the other's arm. But the preference was broken if social conflict emerged between the monkeys-specifically, if both were able to reach for the same food item placed on the table between them. Under these circumstances, parietal neurons started to show complex combinatorial responses to motion of self and other. Parietal cortex adapted its response properties in the social context by discarding and recruiting different neural populations. Our results suggest that parietal neurons can recognize social events in the environment linked with current social context and form part of a larger social brain network."

AJA has potent analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity <i>in vivo</i>, but without the psychotropic action of THC. However, its precise mechanism of action remains unknown. Biochemical studies indicate that AJA binds directly and selectively to the isotype γ of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARγ) suggesting that this may be a pharmacologically relevant receptor for this compound and a potential target for drug development in the treatment of pain and inflammation. Here, we report the crystal structure of the ligand binding domain of the γ isotype of human PPAR in complex with ajulemic acid, determined at 2.8-Å resolution. Our results show a binding mode that is compatible with other known partial agonists of PPAR, explaining their moderate activation of the receptor, as well as the structural basis for isotype selectivity, as observed previously <i>in vitro</i>. The structure also provides clues to the understanding of partial agonism itself, suggesting a rational approach to the design of molecules capable of activating the receptor at levels that avoid undesirable side effects."
https://openalex.org/W1968956055,"Background Following infection with viruses, bacteria or protozoan parasites, naïve antigen-specific CD8+ T cells undergo a process of differentiation and proliferation to generate effector cells. Recent evidences suggest that the timing of generation of specific effector CD8+ T cells varies widely according to different pathogens. We hypothesized that the timing of increase in the pathogen load could be a critical parameter governing this process. Methodology/Principal Findings Using increasing doses of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi to infect C57BL/6 mice, we observed a significant acceleration in the timing of parasitemia without an increase in mouse susceptibility. In contrast, in CD8 deficient mice, we observed an inverse relationship between the parasite inoculum and the timing of death. These results suggest that in normal mice CD8+ T cells became protective earlier, following the accelerated development of parasitemia. The evaluation of specific cytotoxic responses in vivo to three distinct epitopes revealed that increasing the parasite inoculum hastened the expansion of specific CD8+ cytotoxic T cells following infection. The differentiation and expansion of T. cruzi-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T cells is in fact dependent on parasite multiplication, as radiation-attenuated parasites were unable to activate these cells. We also observed that, in contrast to most pathogens, the activation process of T. cruzi-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T cells was dependent on MHC class II restricted CD4+ T cells. Conclusions/Significance Our results are compatible with our initial hypothesis that the timing of increase in the pathogen load can be a critical parameter governing the kinetics of CD4+ T cell-dependent expansion of pathogen-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2001214252,"The etiology of neurodegenerative disorders, such as the accelerated loss of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease, is unclear. Current hypotheses suggest an abnormal function of the neuronal sodium-dependent dopamine transporter DAT to contribute to cell death in the dopaminergic system, but it has not been investigated whether sodium-independent amine transporters are implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.By the use of a novel tandem-mass spectrometry-based substrate search technique, we have shown that the dopaminergic neuromodulators histidyl-proline diketopiperazine (cyclo(his-pro)) and salsolinol were the endogenous key substrates of the sodium-independent organic cation transporter OCT2. Quantitative real-time mRNA expression analysis revealed that OCT2 in contrast to its related transporters was preferentially expressed in the dopaminergic regions of the substantia nigra where it colocalized with DAT and tyrosine hydroxylase. By assessing cell viability with the MTT reduction assay, we found that salsolinol exhibited a selective toxicity toward OCT2-expressing cells that was prevented by cyclo(his-pro). A frequent genetic variant of OCT2 with the amino acid substitution R400C reduced the transport efficiency for the cytoprotective cyclo(his-pro) and thereby increased the susceptibility to salsolinol-induced cell death.Our findings indicate that the OCT2-regulated interplay between cyclo(his-pro) and salsolinol is crucial for nigral cell integrity and that a shift in transport efficiency may impact the risk of Parkinson's disease."

Within the peptide-loading complex ERp57 is normally found disulfide-linked to tapasin, through one of its two thioredoxin-like redox motifs. We describe here a novel trimeric complex that disulfide links together MHC class I heavy chain, ERp57 and tapasin, and that is found in association with the transporter associated with antigen processing peptide transporter.

Taken together, our studies demonstrate for the first time that ERp57 directly interacts with MHC class I molecules within the peptide-loading complex and suggest that ERp57 and protein-disulfide isomerase act in concert to regulate the redox status of MHC class I during antigen presentation. To bind a high affinity, optimized pool of peptides, MHC 6The abbreviations used are: MHC, major histocompatibility complex class I; TAP, transporter associated with antigen processing; MMTS, methyl methanethiosulfonate; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; PLC, peptide-loading complex; PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; AMS, 4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; β2m, β2-microglobulin; TR, thioredoxin; FBS, fetal bovine serum. 6The abbreviations used are: MHC, major histocompatibility complex class I; TAP, transporter associated with antigen processing; MMTS, methyl methanethiosulfonate; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; PLC, peptide-loading complex; PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; AMS, 4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; β2m, β2-microglobulin; TR, thioredoxin; FBS, fetal bovine serum. class I molecules undergo a series of chaperone-mediated interactions within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (1Paulsson K.M.

For most MHC class I molecules, this process occurs in the multicomponent MHC class I peptide-loading complex (PLC), which in addition to β2-microglobulin (β2m)-associated MHC class I molecules includes the chaperone calreticulin, the oxidoreductases ERp57 and protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI), the class I-specific accessory molecule tapasin, and the peptide transporter TAP (3Ortmann B.

A series of experimental reports have indicated that the PLC acts cooperatively, and that the absence of any of the components results in the disruption of MHC class I assembly, and a reduction in the efficiency of antigen presentation to T cells (6Zhang Y.

These oxidoreductases are related to thioredoxin (TR) and share two functional CXXC motifs (denoted TR1 and TR2) (13Oliver J.D. van der Wal F.J. Bulleid N.J. High S.

Possession of this motif permits family members to catalyze reduction, oxidation, and isomerization of disulfide bonds within substrate polypeptides (16Jessop C.E. Chakravarthi S. Watkins R.H. Bulleid N.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 655-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). ERp57 normally appears to be in a GSH-dependent reduced state within the ER (17Antoniou A.N. Powis S.J. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2003; 5: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 18Jessop C.E. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55341-55347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and is thus likely to be involved in reduction or isomerization reactions. However, a striking feature of ERp57 is that, in the presence of tapasin, it preferentially forms an interaction through its TR1 motif with an unpaired cysteine in tapasin at position 95 (19Dick T.P. Bangia N. Peaper D.R. Cresswell P. Immunity. 2002; 16: 87-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The normal escape pathway that exists to release ERp57 from substrate polypeptides is inhibited by this interaction (20Peaper D.R. Wearsch P.A. Cresswell P. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3613-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), leading to the whole cellular pool of tapasin being disulfide-linked to ERp57, and a large pool of cellular ERp57 being likewise occupied within the PLC (17Antoniou A.N. Powis S.J. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2003; 5: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The reason for this sequestration of ERp57 within the PLC is not fully understood, and although in its absence MHC class I molecules appear fully oxidized, crucially there is a lack of peptide optimization (8Garbi N. Tanaka S. Momburg F. Hammerling G.J. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). It therefore remains possible that ERp57 could monitor the disulfide status of MHC class I molecules through its unoccupied TR2 motif, alongside the role recently described for PDI in the oxidation of MHC class I molecules and peptide optimization within the PLC (4Park B. Lee S. Kim E. Cho K. Riddell S.R. Cho S. Ahn K. Cell. 2006; 127: 369-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Cell Lines and Antibodies—C58, T2, Daudi, and the .220 series cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% FBS (both Invitrogen) and with selective antibiotics where required. KG-1 cells (ECACC) were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Sigma) with 20% FBS, and were matured in the presence of 10 ng/ml PMA and 100 ng/ml ionomycin. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS. The .220 series of cells were a gift from P. Lehner (Cambridge, UK) and E. Hewitt (Leeds, UK). .220.rtpn was generated by electroporation of .220 cells with full-length rat tapasin cDNA (21Deverson E.V. Powis S.J. Morrice N.A. Herberg J.A. Trowsdale J. Butcher G.W. Genes Immun. 2001; 2: 48-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and recloned from rat C58 thymoma cells, in vector pCR3 (Invitrogen). KG-1 cells expressing cysteine mutant B*2705 constructs were generated by electroporation. HeLa cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) and selected in 0.5 mg/ml G418. Monoclonal antibody HC10 recognizes unfolded HLA-B and C molecules. Anti-ERp57 was a gift from N. Bulleid (Manchester, UK). Anti-human tapasin was a gift from T. Elliott (Southampton, UK). Anti-mouse/rat tapasin was a gift from T. Hansen (St. Louis, MO). Monoclonal antibody 148.3 recognizes human TAP1. Anti-PDI was obtained from StressGen (SPA-890). Cell Lysates and Immunoprecipitations—For alkylation treatments, cells were resuspended in ice-cold PBS containing 10 mm NEM (Sigma) or MMTS (Pierce) for 5 min, followed by lysis for 10 min in ice-cold 1% Nonidet P-40 containing buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, plus 10 mm NEM or MMTS). Insoluble material was removed by a 5-min centrifugation at 20,000 × g, and supernatants were heated in nonreducing sample buffer. Where indicated cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with 1 mm diamide (Sigma) or 2 mm DTT prior to processing. The acid-trapping method using trichloroacetic acid has been described previously (17Antoniou A.N. Powis S.J. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2003; 5: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For isolation of the TAP complex, 20 million cells were pretreated with MMTS in PBS and lysed in buffer as above containing 0.5% digitonin (Wako). TAP complexes were isolated using antibody 148.3 chemically cross-linked to protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma). After extensive washing, beads were heated in nonreducing sample buffer. For metabolic labelings, cells were preincubated in methionine-free RPMI for 20 min and then labeled with 7.2 MBq of Tran35S-label (MP Biologicals) for 20 min at 37 °C. 1 mm diamide was included for the last 5 min, and the cells were then treated with MMTS in PBS, lysed, and immunoprecipitated as above. Samples were run nonreduced on SDS-PAGE and processed for autoradiography. Immunoblotting—Samples were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose (BA85, Schleicher & Schuell), and blocked with skimmed milk powder in PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma). Primary antibodies were incubated with membranes overnight at 4 °C or for a minimum of 1 h at room temperature. Blots were developed by chemiluminescence, using SuperSignal Femto and the included horseradish peroxidase-anti-rabbit and mouse IgG reagents (Pierce). Mutagenesis of HLA-B*2705—A C-terminally tagged (V5) cDNA encoding the HLA-B*2705 allele, cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCR3.1 (Invitrogen), was mutated using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (Quikchange, Stratagene) to alter conserved cysteine residues to serine or to introduce a stop codon after residue 339. Alkylation with MMTS Reveals a Novel High Molecular Weight Species in KG-1 Cells—The majority of studies of the PLC have involved either the use of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) to alkylate unpaired cysteines (15Antoniou A.N. Ford S. Alphey M. Osborne A. Elliott T. Powis S.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2655-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 19Dick T.P. Bangia N. Peaper D.R. Cresswell P. Immunity. 2002; 16: 87-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), thereby trapping ERp57-tapasin complexes, or rapid acidification to prevent thiol exchange, followed by alkylation (17Antoniou A.N. Powis S.J. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2003; 5: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, Cresswell and co-workers (20Peaper D.R. Wearsch P.A. Cresswell P. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3613-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS) can also preserve the ERp57-tapasin conjugate, a result we confirm here in cell lysates of the rat C58 thymoma cell line (Fig. 1A). We used MMTS to study the formation of the PLC in the dendritic like cell line KG-1. KG-1 cells were matured in PMA and ionomycin for up to 3 days and MMTS-treated detergent lysates prepared. As maturation progressed, we detected a novel species with a size of ∼150 kDa, which immunostained with anti-HLA-B- and -C-specific antibody HC10 and also ERp57 and tapasin specific antisera (Fig. 1B). This would be the expected approximate size of a disulfide-linked species containing MHC class I (43–45 kDa), ERp57 (57 kDa), and tapasin (48 kDa). The 150-kDa species was not revealed by anti-PDI, ERp72, or calreticulin antisera (not shown). Therefore, the results suggested the existence of an MHC class I heavy chain-ERp57-tapasin complex in these cells. Characterization of MHC Class I-ERp57-Tapasin Complex in Transfectants of the .220 Cell Line—In a further analysis we made use of the tapasin-deficient .220 cell line (22Greenwood R. Shimizu Y. Sekhon G.S. DeMars R. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5525-5536PubMed Google Scholar) and stable transfectants .220.B8 (expressing HLA-B8) (23Lehner P.J. Surman M.J. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), .220.rtpn (expressing rat tapasin), and a double transfectant with B8 and human tapasin (.220.B8.tpn). As shown in Fig. 2A, using trichloroacetic acid-based rapid acidification and alkylation with 4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMS), which increases the size of each nondisulfide-linked cysteine residue by ∼0.5 kDa, the ERp57-tapasin complex can only be detected when both ERp57 and tapasin are present, i.e. in .220.B8.tpn cells. Using MMTS-treated cell lysates, we clearly detected the novel MHC-ERp57-tapasin trimeric conjugate in .220.B8.tpn cells (Fig. 2B). The conjugate was not detected in .220.rtpn cells, likely due to the low levels of endogenous MHC class I, as shown in the HC10 panel. Note that the anti-tapasin reagent used in this experiment does not recognize rat tapasin, and thus there is no detection of the ERp57-rat tapasin conjugate in the anti-tapasin panel, whereas the ERp57 antisera recognizes both species (note also that the ERp57-rat tapasin complex migrates slightly slower on SDS-PAGE). Furthermore, the anti-tapasin sera frequently recognizes a nonspecific species in the .220 cell series, which can be seen migrating at ∼80 kDa (see also Figs. 3D and 5A). Thus, formation of the conjugate requires the presence of MHC class I, ERp57, and tapasin. Lysates from the .220.B8.tpn line were subsequently also analyzed under reducing conditions and clearly demonstrated the disappearance of both the ERp57-tapasin and the MHC-ERp57-tapasin complex under such conditions (see Fig. 3D).FIGURE 3Diamide enhances the MHC-ERp57-tapasin interaction. A, .220 cells were treated with DTT or diamide (DIA), then trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, and alkylated with AMS. Diamide is shown to prevent access of AMS by oxidizing the CXXC motifs. B, .220.rtpn and .220.B8.tpn cells were pretreated with or without diamide before preparation of MMTS detergent lysates. Samples were then immunoblotted with HC10 or anti-ERp57 or anti-human tapasin reagents. Diamide is shown to significantly increase the MHC-ERp57-tapasin conjugate. C, .220.B8.tpn cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of diamide for 10 min at 37 °C and then subsequently treated with MMTS, and lysates were prepared and immunoblotted for ERp57. D, diamide- and MMTS-treated cell lysates were prepared from .220.B8.tpn cells, analyzed under nonreducing (nonred) and reducing (red) conditions and immunoblotted for MHC class I, ERp57, and tapasin. The MHC-ERp57-tapasin and ERp57-tapasin bands in each case resolve to a single species under reducing conditions. The tapasin panel also reveals the nonspecific species detected just beneath the ERp57-tapasin band, labeled ** in this figure. This is the same species shown in Fig. 2B and reported in the main text. This species does not significantly alter mobility upon reduction, whereas tapasin reduces to a single species of 48 kDa. E, .220.B8.tpn cells were treated with 1 mm diamide, then soaked in PBS, and lysed in detergent buffer supplemented with NEM or MMTS as indicated. Lysates were probed for MHC class I and ERp57. UT, untreated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 5The MHC-ERp57-tapasin conjugate does not require TAP but does require β2m-associated MHC class I heavy chains. A, T2 (TAP-deficient) and Daudi (β2m-deficient) cells were treated with or without diamide (DIA) and then with MMTS and lysed, and samples were immunoblotted for MHC class I, ERp57, and tapasin. The ERp57-tapasin and MHC-ERp57-tapasin conjugates are indicated. An unidentified larger complex (*) stains for ERp57 and tapasin but not MHC class I. B, detergent lysates of diamide- and MMTS-treated untransfected (UT) HeLa cells and cells expressing a tail-less truncated HLA-B*2705 heavy chain were immunoprobed with HC10 and ERp57 antisera. The truncated B27 heavy chain migrates faster than endogenous HLA class I alleles, resulting in a smaller size to the MHC-ERp57-tapasin conjugate. C, .220.B8 and .220.B8.tpn cells were lysed in digitonin, and TAP immunoprecipitates (ip) were analyzed reduced (top panel) or nonreduced (lower panel) with the indicated antibodies. The complex containing PDI is indicated by a double asterisk.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Enhancement of the MHC-ERp57-Tapasin Complex under Oxidizing Conditions—To test if we could enhance the formation of the MHC-ERp57-tapasin complex, we incubated cells with the oxidizing agent diamide, which causes oxidation of the ERp57 CXXC motifs, rendering them inaccessible to AMS modification (Fig. 3A) (17Antoniou A.N. Powis S.J. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2003; 5: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We therefore treated .220.rtpn and .220.B8.tpn cells with diamide and prepared MMTS-treated lysates. Diamide treatment significantly increased the presence of the MHC-ERp57-tapasin conjugate in .220.B8.tpn cells, with the concomitant loss of signal in the ERp57-tapasin conjugate, suggesting that the enhanced trimeric complex is derived solely from the ERp57-tapasin complex (Fig. 3B). A titration of diamide determined that between 0.5 and 1 mm was optimal to enhance this interaction (Fig. 3C), with higher concentrations (5 mm) leading to a loss of protein recovered from treated cells (not shown). Diamide-treated lysates were also analyzed under reducing conditions, demonstrating reduction of the relevant complexes (Fig. 3D). Thus alteration to the oxidizing environment of the ER and ERp57 increases the interaction of ERp57 with MHC class I molecules. This suggests that ERp57 is acting as an oxidoreductase on MHC class I molecules, because modifications of the intracellular redox environment will influence its interaction with its substrate. The novel MHC-ERp57-tapasin complex described so far was reliably identified in the presence of MMTS. To address whether this complex forms only because of the inclusion of MMTS, we retested .220.B8.tpn cells using NEM and including diamide oxidation. Untreated or NEM- or MMTS-treated lysates were analyzed. As shown in Fig. 3E, the MHC-ERp57-tapasin complex could now be detected using NEM, although at a much lower signal strength. This important control indicates that the MHC-ERp57-tapasin conjugate is not induced solely by the addition of MMTS and may also demonstrate why it has not been observed previously. Using diamide we can also detect the conjugate using the trichloroacetic acid/AMS described earlier (not shown). The MHC-ERp57-Tapasin Complex Associates with TAP—A crucial feature of the PLC is its formation with the TAP peptide transporter (24Ortmann B. Androlewicz M.J. Cresswell P. Nature. 1994; 368: 864-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 25Powis S.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2744-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the main source of peptides translocated from the cytoplasm. We therefore tested whether we could detect the MHC-ERp57-tapasin conjugate bound to TAP. The .220 transfectant series were treated with diamide, alkylated in MMTS, lysed in digitonin to preserve TAP-PLC interactions, and immunoprecipitated with anti-TAP1 antibody. Immunoblotting revealed that the MHC-ERp57-tapasin conjugate was readily detected but only in .220.B8.tpn cells (Fig. 4A). A control blot confirmed isolation of TAP and the previously reported observation that the presence of tapasin stabilizes and increases the cellular pool of TAP (23Lehner P.J. Surman M.J. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Additionally, because these immunoprecipitations isolate only the TAP-associated pool of MHC class I molecules, we determined by densitometry that, in the presence of diamide, ∼30% of the MHC class I molecules are disulfide-linked to ERp57. Similarly, ∼30% of the TAP-associated ERp57 and tapasin pool are in this trimeric complex. We also used this same experimental procedure to determine whether we could compare the amount of MHC class I molecules involved in the MHC-ERp57-tapasin complex in the absence of oxidizing stress. .220.B8.tpn cells were treated with or without diamide, alkylated with MMTS, and TAP-immunoprecipitated from digitonin lysates. Immunoblotting for MHC class I heavy chains was performed (Fig. 4B), and by comparing several different exposures, it was possible to calculate that in non-diamide-treated cells, only 1–3% of the TAP-associated MHC class I molecules resided within the MHC-ERp57-tapasin complex. Antibody HC10 preferentially recognizes partially folded and therefore possibly peptide-empty structures, whereas W6/32 preferentially recognizes fully folded, peptide-loaded molecules. We used these antibodies to immunoprecipitate radiolabeled cell lysates from .220.B8.tpn cells that had been diamide- and MMTS-treated. Both antibodies isolated the Mr 45,000 B8 heavy chain, and in addition HC10 isolated a faint species at 150 kDa, which was identical in size when compared with immunoblots of the MHC-ERp57-tapasin conjugate (Fig. 4C). W6/32 did not isolate this species, suggesting that the HC10-reactive MHC-ERp57-tapasin species has a incompletely folded peptide groove. To determine whether the MHC-ERp57-tapasin complex was part of redox regulation during peptide loading, we determined whether mutation of the conserved cysteines at positions 101 and 164 in the peptide-binding groove of HLA-B27 influenced formation of the trimeric complex. Mutation of these structural cysteines disrupts normal assembly and cell surface expression (not shown); therefore, transfected cells were incubated overnight at 26 °C to induce folding. The MHC-ERp57-tapasin conjugate was readily detected in TAP immunoprecipitates of KG-1 cells expressing both wild type B27 and a B27.C164S mutant, but it was not seen consistently in B27.C101S mutants, suggesting that ERp57 prefers to interact with the Cys-101 residue in the peptide groove. Of potential interest, mutant B27.C101S formed TAP-associated dimer-like structures, which may interfere with its ability to interact with ERp57 within the PLC, which is an area we are investigating further. The MHC-ERp57-Tapasin Conjugate Can Form Independently of TAP but Requires the Presence of β2-Microglobulin—Although the PLC is normally found in association with TAP, its components can also form in the absence of TAP (5Sadasivan B. Lehner P.J. Ortmann B. Spies T. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1996; 5: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 26Paulsson K.M. Wang P. Anderson P.O. Chen S. Pettersson R.F. Li S. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 1063-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We therefore asked if the formation of the MHC-ERp57-tapasin conjugate was critically dependent on TAP, and also whether the absence of β2m would affect its formation. TAP-deficient T2 cells and β2m-deficient Daudi cells were treated with diamide, and MMTS lysates were prepared and immunoblotted. The trimeric complex was detected in T2 cells, as shown in Fig. 5A, demonstrating its formation is not dependent on TAP. We also detected the presence of a faint higher mass species that immunoblotted for ERp57 and tapasin raising the possibility that ERp57 and tapasin may potentially form other complexes. In Daudi cells we did not detect any MHC class I-ERp57-tapasin conjugate, supporting a model where only β2m-associated MHC class I molecules progress into the PLC. Furthermore, we observed that diamide treatment of Daudi cells inhibited formation of the ERp57-tapasin complex, suggesting that in the absence of β2m-associated MHC class I molecules, the ERp57-tapasin complex is less stable and cannot survive oxidative stress. Human tapasin contains an unpaired cysteine residue in its tail region (5Sadasivan B. Lehner P.J. Ortmann B. Spies T. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1996; 5: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Several MHC class I heavy chains also contain unpaired cysteine residues in their cytoplasmic tail regions. Despite the normally reducing conditions of the cytoplasm, to exclude an abnormal disulfide linkage in this region we studied HeLa cells expressing a mutant of HLA-B*2705 lacking the last 23 residues, including the unpaired cysteine. Diamide- and MMTS-treated lysates were probed with ERp57 antisera, which revealed the additional presence of a slightly smaller MHC-ERp57-tapasin complex resulting from the smaller size of the truncated B27 heavy chain (Fig. 5B). The faint detection in Fig. 5A of an even larger species than the MHC-ERp57-tapasin conjugate led us to ask whether PDI may also be part of this complex. PDI was readily detected in DTT-reduced samples after digitonin lysate-based immunoisolation of the TAP complex from .220.B8.tpn cells (Fig. 5C, top panel). Furthermore, in nonreduced samples, we were able to identify, in several experiments, a species of over 200 kDa, which immunostained for MHC class I, ERp57, tapasin, and PDI (Fig. 5C, lower panel, indicated by **). However, this species was not consistent in all experiments and requires further characterization. Because ERp57 was discovered as a component of the MHC class I PLC, it has been implicated in the control of the disulfide status of MHC class I molecules. Although interactions between ERp57 and MHC class I molecules have been reported (15Antoniou A.N. Ford S. Alphey M. Osborne A. Elliott T. Powis S.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2655-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 27Lindquist J.A. Hammerling G.J. Trowsdale J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1448-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), it has not been possible to determine at what stage of the assembly process these interactions occur. Indeed, rather than readily finding MHC class I interactions, it was somewhat against expectations to find that the complete pool of ERp57 within the PLC was disulfide-bonded to tapasin (19Dick T.P. Bangia N. Peaper D.R. Cresswell P. Immunity. 2002; 16: 87-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). More recently, Park et al. (4Park B. Lee S. Kim E. Cho K. Riddell S.R. Cho S. Ahn K.

In contrast to the situation when ERp57 is depleted or absent (6Zhang Y. Baig E. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14622-14631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 8Garbi N. Tanaka S. Momburg F. Hammerling G.J. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), short interfering RNA-based depletion of PDI appears to affect the oxidation status of nascent MHC class I molecules. We have shown here that a disulfide conjugate linking MHC class I, ERp57, and tapasin exists. If, within the PLC, ERp57 is acting as a normal oxidoreductase, by forming only transient interactions with its MHC class I substrate (16Jessop C.E. Chakravarthi S. Watkins R.H. Bulleid N.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 655-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), then it would be predicted that only a small proportion of the total ERp57-tapasin pool would be found in association with MHC class I. This is clearly evident in our data, for example in Fig. 2B, where the MHC-ERp57-tapasin conjugate is only a minority of the total ERp57-tapasin pool and also of the total MHC class I pool. Indeed, as we show in Fig. 4B, only a small percentage, in the range of 1–3%, of MHC class I molecules within the TAP complex interact normally with ERp57. Based on our observations, and the recent work of others (19Dick T.P. Bangia N. Peaper D.R. Cresswell P. Immunity. 2002; 16: 87-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 20Peaper D.R. Wearsch P.A. Cresswell P. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3613-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), we hypothesize a model wherein ERp57 is capable of interacting with the disulfide bond present in the peptide-binding groove of MHC class I, depicted in schematic form in Fig. 6. In our previous studies of the actions of ERp57 upon MHC class I molecules, we developed an in vitro assay and demonstrated how recombinant ERp57 could act as a reductase on the partially folded HC10-reactive pool of MHC class I molecules (15Antoniou A.N. Ford S. Alphey M. Osborne A. Elliott T. Powis S.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2655-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We also noted how ERp57 was more active in this role than its close relative PDI. Although we cannot distinguish with the experiments performed in this study whether ERp57 is acting as a reductase or oxidase on the MHC class I molecules with which it is interacting, based on the observations that ERp57 normally has reduced CXXC motifs in vivo, it is likely that it is acting as a reductase. Whether this function is required to load some MHC class I molecules with optimal peptides or is part of a process to remove unwanted MHC class I molecules from the PLC remains to be determined. As yet we have been unable to determine whether PDI plays a role in the formation of the MHC-ERp57-tapasin complex we describe here, although we have been able to confirm that it does co-precipitate with the TAP complex (Fig. 5C). As reported here, in some experiments we have also weakly detected a larger species, in the region of Mr 200,000, which we can immunoblot for ERp57, tapasin, MHC class I and PDI. Our data suggest a model whereby both PDI and ERp57 have access to the peptide-binding groove of MHC class I molecules during assembly within the PLC, and that they may play complementary roles in ensuring that only optimally loaded molecules egress to the cell surface. Although ERp57 is tethered to the PLC through its disulfide linkage to tapasin, it may be that PDI is a more transient visitor to the PLC, with a relatively low affinity interaction, and that its successful isolation during immunoprecipitation experiments is affected for similar reasons, thus favoring the interaction of ERp57 that we describe here. The cooperative nature of the complex may also explain why PDI has not been readily detected in cells lacking ERp57. It is clear, however, that despite our knowledge of many of the components of this pathway, our understanding of the mechanism by which each component interacts with the MHC class I molecule, and with the other parts of the PLC, remains obscure. Some MHC class I alleles appear to be less reliant on interactions with the PLC (28Park B. Lee S. Kim E. Ahn K. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), including the inflammatory arthritis-associated HLA-B27 allele, although as we have demonstrated in Fig. 4D it can interact when the PLC is available. HLA-B27 is one of a relatively rare set of MHC class I molecules that has an unpaired cysteine at position 67, pointing into the peptide-binding groove. HLA-B27 is prone to misfolding in the ER and forms disulfide-linked heavy chain oligomers, which are due, at least in part, to this additional cysteine (29Allen R.L. O'Callaghan C.A. McMichael A.J. Bowness P. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5045-5048PubMed Google Scholar, 30Antoniou A.N. Ford S. Taurog J.D. Butcher G.W. Powis S.J. J. Biol.

Thus HLA-B27 may have evolved to be less dependent on the PLC, to avoid potentially aberrant interactions between ERp57 and/or PDI, and the cysteine at position 67. We are currently investigating this possible interaction and its potential impact upon the behavior of this important disease-associated HLA allele.

The UBR3-specific LacZ expression was also prominent in cells of the touch, vision, hearing, and taste systems, suggesting a regulatory role of UBR3 in sensory pathways, including olfaction.

An essential determinant of one class of degrons, called N-degrons, is a substrate's destabilizing N-terminal residue.

In eukaryotes, the N-degron consists of three determinants: a destabilizing N-terminal residue of a protein substrate, its internal Lys residue(s) (the site of formation of a poly-Ub chain), and a conformationally flexible region(s) in the vicinity of these determinants (5Bachmair A.

The N-end rule has a hierarchic structure in that some of the destabilizing N-terminal residues (Arg, Lys, His, Phe, Leu, Trp, Tyr, and Ile) are recognized directly by E3 Ub ligases of the N-end rule pathway, called N-recognins, whereas the other destabilizing N-terminal residues (Asn, Gln, Asp, Glu, and Cys) must be modified in vivo, enzymatically or otherwise, for their subsequent (indirect) recognition by these E3s (Fig. 1A) (18Hu R.-G.

The mouse genome encodes at least seven UBR box-containing proteins, termed UBR1-UBR7, which vary both in size (from 50 to 570 kDa) and in containing or lacking other E3-characteristic domains, such as HECT, RING, PHD, or F-box (Fig. 1B) (17Tasaki T.

UBR1 and UBR2 of this set, the highly homologous (47% identical) 200-kDa E3s, are the known N-recognins of the mouse N-end rule pathway (16Kwon Y.T. Xia Z.X. An J.Y. Tasaki T. Davydov I.V. Seo J.W.

In the S. cerevisiae RING-type UBR1 Ub ligase and also (by inference) in its mammalian homologs UBR1 and UBR2, the UBR box and nearby regions mediate the recognition of N-degrons (i.e. the binding of N-recognin to a primary destabilizing N-terminal residue (Arg, Lys, His, Phe, Leu, Trp, Tyr, or Ile) of a polypeptide) (16Kwon Y.T.

S. cerevisiae UBR1 recognizes type-1 (basic) destabilizing N-terminal residues Arg, Lys, and His through a binding site that resides at least in part in the UBR box.

Its activity is allosterically controlled by occupancy states of the other two (type-1 and type-2) binding sites of UBR1. The third substrate-binding site targets the transcriptional repressor CUP9, through an internal degron near the C terminus of CUP9 (26Turner G.C. Du F. Varshavsky A.

Indeed, mouse UBR1 was shown to target c-FOS, a component of the AP-1 transcription factor, for ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation through a conditional (regulated by phosphorylation) degron near the N terminus of c-FOS (37Sasaki T.

Several other UBR box-containing proteins, such as UBR4 (PUSHOVER/BIG) and UBR5 (EDD/hHYD), are also, operationally, N-recognins whose substrate specificities include the ability to recognize primary destabilizing N-terminal residues (Fig. 1A) (17Tasaki T.

In the present study, we cloned and characterized mouse UBR3, a protein of unknown function that contains both the UBR box and the RING domain. Our findings show that UBR1, UBR2, and UBR3 are structurally related members of the RING-UBR subfamily of UBR-box E3s that interact (and function together) with the E2 enzymes HR6A and HR6B. We also constructed and characterized mouse strains lacking UBR3 and describe several lines of evidence suggesting that one function of UBR3 involves the regulation of sensory path-ways, including olfaction. Cloning of the UBR3 cDNA—A 412-bp cDNA fragment that encompassed a 3′-proximal region of the UBR3 ORF (see “Results”) was used as a probe to screen a λEXlox-based embryonic day 10 (E10) mouse embryo cDNA library (Novagen, Madison, WI), yielding a 2.5-kb UBR3 cDNA fragment. This fragment was employed as a probe in a second screen, using a λgt10-based mouse cDNA library from MEL-C19 cells (Clontech) and yielding in a 1-kb fragment. Two subsequent screenings yielded 2-kb and 1.5-kb fragments. To isolate the 5′ region of UBR3 cDNA, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR was performed with poly(A)+ RNA from mouse liver or skeletal muscle. The resulting set of overlapping cDNA fragments were joined to produce full-length UBR3 cDNAs encoding two splicing-derived isoforms. Construction of UBR3-/- Mouse Strains—The mouse UBR3 gene was isolated by screening a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) DNA library (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO) from 129SvJ mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells by using a UBR3-specific cDNA probe (nucleotides 385-1,886). The exon/intron organization of the first ∼30 kb of UBR3 was determined using exon-specific PCR primers to amplify genomic DNA fragments flanked by exons as previously described (34Kwon Y.T. Xia Z. Davydov I.V. Lecker S.H. Varshavsky A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8007-8021Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The targeting vector was constructed using standard techniques, linearized with KpnI, and electroporated into CJ7 ES cells, followed by standard procedures for selection and identification of correctly targeted UBR3+/- ES cell colonies by using PCR and Southern hybridization (16Kwon Y.T.

Four independently produced UBR3+/- ES cell clones were injected into C57/BL6J blastocysts to generate chimeric mice. In two of these mice, the mutant (UBR3-) allele was transmitted to the germ line. Northern and Southern hybridizations and PCR-mediated genotyping were carried out as described (34Kwon Y.T. Xia Z. Davydov I.V. Lecker S.H. Varshavsky A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8007-8021Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). GST Pull-down Assays—Glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays were carried out as described (16Kwon Y.T. Xia Z.X.

N-terminally FLAG-tagged mouse fUBR1, fUBR2, and fUBR3 and S. cerevisiae fUBR1 (sc-fUBR1) were expressed in S. cerevisiae SC295 (MATa, GAL4 GAL80 ura3-52, leu2-3,112 reg1-501 gal1 pep4-3) from the PADH1 promoter in a high copy vector. X-SCC1-GST fusions (where X represents Met, Arg, or Leu) were produced using the IMPACT (intein-mediated purification with an affinity chitin-binding tag) system (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) as previously described (16Kwon Y.T.

N-terminal residues of the test proteins were verified by Edman sequencing of purified X-SCC1-GST fusions. GST fusions to mouse HR6A and HR6B (GST-HR6A and GST-HR6B) were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified as described (16Kwon Y.T. Xia Z.X. An J.Y. Tasaki T. Davydov I.V. Seo J.W. Xie Y. Varshavsky A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8255-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The purified X-SCC1-GST (2 μg) in 250 μl of the loading buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) was incubated with 15 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed once with the loading buffer and twice with the binding buffer (10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 m KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). The diluted yeast extracts (250 μl) containing E3s in binding buffer containing the protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science) were added into the washed beads. The bound proteins were eluted, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibody. The 5% input lanes (see Fig. 2) refer to a directly loaded sample of the yeast extract that corresponded to 5% of the extract amount used in GST pull-down assays. X-Peptide Pull-down Assay—X-Peptides (X-Ile-Phe-Ser-Thr-Asp-Thr-Gly-Pro-Gly-Gly-Cys, where X represents Arg, Phe, Gly, Ser, Thr, Ala, Asp, or Met), where residues 2-9 were derived from residues 2-9 of Sindbis virus polymerase nsP4, were synthesized as described (17Tasaki T. Mulder L.C.F. Iwamatsu A. Lee M.J. Davydov I.V. Varshavsky A. Muesing M. Kwon Y.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7120-7136Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae extract expressing mouse fUBR1, fUBR2, or fUBR3 was diluted by the lysis buffer (10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 m KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) to 1.2 mg/ml of total protein and thereafter incubated with or without an added dipeptide for 15 min on ice to prevent proteolytic degradation of peptide substrates. A sample (0.3 ml) was then transferred to a new tube containing 5 μl (packed volume) of a carrier-linked 12-mer peptide, followed by gentle mixing, through rotation of the tube, for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted by a brief centrifugation and then washed three times, for 2 min each, with the lysis buffer. The beads were then suspended in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and heated at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by a brief spin in a microcentrifuge, SDS-8% PAGE of the supernatant, and detection of fUBR1, fUBR2, or fUBR3 by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG M2 antibody. Antibody to Mouse UBR3—An affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antibody to mouse UBR3 was produced using standard methods (34Kwon Y.T. Xia Z. Davydov I.V. Lecker S.H. Varshavsky A. Mol. Cell.

This antibody was employed to detect endogenous UBR3 through a combination of immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting (see Fig. 3D and “Results”). LacZ Staining, Immunohistochemistry, and Northern Hybridization—LacZ staining (using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-in-dolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside) and Northern hybridization (with a UBR3-specific 32P-labeled cDNA probe) were carried out as described (24Kwon Y.T.

LacZ-stained embryos were postfixed, photographed, and sectioned after embedding in paraffin. Alternatively, the tissues were frozen in OCT medium after fixation, cryosectioned, and stained for LacZ on the slides. For immunohistochemistry, specific tissues were isolated, fixed in 4% formaldehyde, treated with 70% ethanol, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin wax as described (16Kwon Y.T. Xia Z.X. An J.Y. Tasaki T. Davydov I.V. Seo J.W. Xie Y. Varshavsky A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8255-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), followed by sectioning and staining with hematoxylin/eosin or an antibody. For Northern hybridization, a mouse adult tissue blot (Seegene, Seoul, Korea) containing total RNAs isolated from the brain, heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, stomach, small intestine, skeletal muscle, thymus, testis, uterus of nonpregnant female, and E17.5 placenta was hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA fragments of mouse UBR3 or human β-actin. Northern analyses were also done with total RNAs from UBR3-/- brains and hearts versus their wild-type counterparts. Assays for Neurotransmitters, Amino Acids, and Neurotrophins—Individual brains for each UBR3 genotype (+/+, +/-, and -/-) at the stages of E18 and postnatal day 1 (P1) were collected (6-8 brains of each genotype) to measure neurotransmitters and related compounds as described (40Chourbaji S.

The levels of monoamines (noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin) and their metabolites were determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection. Amino acids were measured using HPLC and fluorescence spectroscopy (41Piepponen T.P. Skujins A. J. Chromatogr. B. Biomed. Sci. Appl. 2001; 757: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The levels of nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the brains were determined by enzyme-linked immunoassay (42Hellweg R. Baethge C. Hartung H.D. Bruckner M.K. Arendt T. Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 777-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Odor-based Behavioral Tests—Odorant discrimination tests were performed largely as described (43Trinh K. Storm D.R. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. UBR3-/- mice (7-17 weeks old) with littermate controls (+/+ and UBR3+/-) were individually housed in filter-topped cages 2 days before the test. On the third day, the test mouse was relocated to a designated area away from other mice and was left there for 30 min to allow accommodation to the environment. Pretraining sessions and odorant tests with mice are described under “Results.” Odorant solutions (50 μm) were made freshly in deionized water (for isoamyl acetate and ethyl vanillin) or mineral oil (for geraniol and citral). One experimenter performed the entire set of odorant tests without knowing the genotypes of mice being tested. Cloning of Mouse cDNAs Encoding UBR3—Data base search using UBR1 and UBR2 sequences as probes brought forth a 388-bp cDNA fragment (GenBank™ accession number W83893) encoding a partial open reading frame that exhibits a weak but significant homology to C-terminal regions of UBR1 and UBR2. By employing cDNA library screening and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR, we cloned the ∼8-kb full-length mouse cDNA, yielding nine overlapping cDNA fragments that represented two isoforms of a ∼213-kDa protein named UBR3. The predicted mouse UBR3 cDNA isoforms, encoding the proteins of 1,889 and 1,893 residues, respectively, contained distinct exon/intron boundaries, indicating alternative RNA splicing (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2036854810,"ERM (Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin) proteins mediate formation of membrane-associated cytoskeletons by simultaneously binding actin filaments and the C-terminal cytoplasmic tails of adhesion molecules (type I membrane proteins). ERM proteins also bind neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP), a type II membrane protein, even though the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail of NEP possesses the opposite peptide polarity to that of type I membrane proteins. Here, we determined the crystal structure of the radixin FERM (Four point one and ERM) domain complexed with the N-terminal NEP cytoplasmic peptide. In the FERM-NEP complex, the amphipathic region of the peptide forms a β strand followed by a hairpin that bind to a shallow groove of FERM subdomain C. NEP binding is stabilized by β-β interactions and docking of the NEP hairpin into the hydrophobic pocket of subdomain C. Whereas the binding site of NEP on the FERM domain overlaps with the binding site of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-2, NEP lacks the Motif-1 sequence conserved in ICAM-2 and related adhesion molecules. The NEP hairpin, although lacking the typical inter-chain hydrogen bond but is stabilized by hydrogen bonds with the main chain and side chains of subdomain C, directs the C-terminal basic region of the NEP peptide away from the groove and toward the membrane. The overlap of the binding sites on subdomain C for NEP and Motif-1 adhesion molecules such as CD44 provides the structural basis for the suppression of cell adhesion through interaction between NEP and ERM proteins.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3991-4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). ERM proteins also participate in signal transduction via G protein-coupled receptors and growth factor receptors by binding to the cytoplasmic adaptor protein Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor that binds to and regulates these receptors (3Voltz J.W. Weinman E.J. Shenolikar S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6309-6314Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 4Terawaki S. Maesaki R. Hakoshima T.

Recently, ERM proteins and the closely related homolog merlin, the gene product of neurofibromatosis type 2, have been shown to play a role in cancer development (5McClatchey A.I. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). ERM proteins consist of three domains: an N-terminal FERM (Four Point One-ERM) domain, a central α-helical domain, and a C-terminal F-actin binding tail domain. The FERM domain plays a central role in the association with plasma membranes and recognition of membrane protein cytoplasmic tails such as adhesion molecules. In the cytosol, ERM proteins are present in an inactive form where the FERM domain is masked by an intra-molecular interaction with the C-terminal F-actin binding domain (6Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The inactive form is activated following binding of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to the FERM domain (7Hirao M. Sato N. Kondo T. Yonemura S. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) and subsequent phosphorylation at the C-terminal tail domain (8Matsui T. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Curr.

Cell. 2000; 101: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) and a radixin unmasked form bound to inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (the polar head group of PIP2) have been determined (11Hamada K. Shimizu T. Matsui T. Tsukita S. Hakoshima T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4449-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The FERM domain of ERM proteins consists of three subdomains A, B, and C (11Hamada K. Shimizu T. Matsui T. Tsukita S. Hakoshima T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4449-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and binds to various target molecules (12Bretscher A. Edwards K. Fehon R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 586-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). The major targets are adhesion molecules such as CD44, CD43, and ICAM 1-3, and are classified as type I membrane proteins possessing C-terminal cytoplasmic tails. The FERM domain specifically binds the juxtamembrane region in the C-terminal cytoplasmic tails of these proteins (13Heiska L. Alfthan K. Gronholm M. Vilja P. Vaheri A. Carpen O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21893-22900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 14Yonemura S. Hirao M. Doi Y. Takahashi N. Kondo T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 885-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the radixin FERM domain complexed with the ICAM-2 cytoplasmic peptide together with mutation studies revealed the signature sequence, RXXTYX- VXXA (where X stands for any amino acid residues), for binding to subdomain C, which possesses a PTB (phosphotyrosine binding)-like fold, through anti-parallel β-β association and 310 helix docking into a hydrophobic pocket (15Hamada K. Shimizu T. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Hakoshima T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This and the closely related sequence motif, (R/K/Q)XXT(Y/L)X(V/L/I)XX(A/G) (Motif-1), are found in the C-terminal cytoplasmic tails of adhesion molecules such as CD43 and CD44 that interact with ERM proteins. Recently, neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP) has been shown to directly bind the FERM domain of ERM proteins (16Iwase A. Shen R. Navarro D. Nanus D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11898-11905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). NEP was known to inactivate G protein-coupled receptors through cleavage of a variety of physiologically active peptides such as bombesin and neurotensin (17Shipp M.A. Tarr G.E. Chen C.Y.

The loss or reduction of NEP expression found in prostate cancer cells suggests that decreased peptidase activity facilitates tumor development by allowing neuropeptides to bind their receptors (20Albrecht M.

Interestingly, binding of NEP to ERM proteins results in decreased binding of ERM proteins to the hyaluronan receptor CD44, and can affect cell adhesion and migration (16Iwase A. Shen R. Navarro D. Nanus D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11898-11905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the NEP cytoplasmic tail directly associates with the tumor suppressor PTEN through electrostatic interactions between the basic region of the NEP tail and the phosphorylation site in the PTEN C-terminal tail (23Sumitomo M. Iwase A. Zheng R. Navarro D. Kaminetzky D. Shen R. Georgescu M.M. Nanus D.M. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 67-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, the NEP cytoplasmic tail might play a key role in providing a scaffold for signaling proteins in the regulation of cell proliferation pathways, in addition to organizing the membrane-associated cytoskeleton. NEP is a type II membrane protein that consists of an N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a trans-membrane helix, and a C-terminal extracellular domain. The extracellular domain is a metallopeptidase that belongs to the M13 family of zinc peptidases. The N-terminal short cytoplasmic tail of NEP (Fig. 1A) interacts directly with the FERM domain of ERM proteins, even though NEP possesses no apparent Motif-1 (15Hamada K. Shimizu T. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Hakoshima T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) or recently determined Motif-2 (4Terawaki S. Maesaki R. Hakoshima T. Structure. 2006; 14: 777-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) sequence in the cytoplasmic tail. Moreover, it is uncertain how the FERM domain binds the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail of NEP given that the latter possesses the opposite peptide polarity to the C-terminal tails of adhesion molecules that are representative of type I membrane proteins. Here, we report on the crystal structure of the radixin FERM domain complexed with the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail of NEP. The structure reveals that the amphipathic region of the NEP peptide forms a β strand and a hairpin that bind to subdomain C of the radixin FERM domain. Mutation studies suggests the FERM-binding motif, Motif-1β, which is distinct from Motif-1. The NEP-binding site overlaps that of the Motif-1-binding site on the FERM domain, suggesting versatility of peptide recognition by the FERM domain. In contrast to adhesion molecules of type I membrane proteins that possess a short basic linker region consisting of about 5 residues between the Motif-1 sequence and the trans-membrane helix, the FERM-binding Motif-1β sequence of the NEP cytoplasmic tail is located at the N-terminal end with a distance of more than 10 residues from the putative trans-membrane helix. The distal location of the FERM-binding site relative to the trans-membrane helix suggests that the long basic linker could be folded back toward membranes. Preparation of Crystallization Samples—The FERM domain (residues 1-310) of mouse radixin was expressed in BL21(DE3) RIL cells containing plasmid pGEX4T-3 as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (24Matsui T.

Details of the purification scheme have been previously described (25Hamada K. Matsui T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Hakoshima T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 922-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The synthesized peptide corresponding to the cytoplasmic tail of mouse NEP (1GRSESQMDITDINAPKPKKKQR22) was purchased from Toray Research Center (Tokyo, Japan). The peptide was dissolved to 7.9 mm concentration in a buffer containing 10 mm MES-sodium (pH 6.8), 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Crystallization and Data Collection—The radixin FERM domain and the NEP cytoplasmic peptide were mixed in a 1:5 molar ratio (0.3 mm FERM and 1.5 mm NEP). Crystallization conditions were screened by the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method at 4 °C. The FERM-NEP complex crystals were obtained within 1 week by mixing 0.2 μl of protein solution with 0.2 μl of reservoir solution containing 20% polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG3350) and 0.2 m dl-maleic acid (pH 7.0). The crystals were stepwise transferred into a cryo-protective solution containing 25% PEG200, 20% PEG3350, and 0.2 m dl-maleic acid (pH 7.0) for flash-cooling. X-ray diffraction data were collected using an ADSC Quantum 315 detector installed on the BL41XU beamline at SPring-8 and processed with the program HKL2000 (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar).

Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) was performed with the free-form structure of the radixin FERM domain as a search model (11Hamada K. Shimizu T. Matsui T. Tsukita S. Hakoshima T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4449-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The FERM domain structure was refined using the rigid-body and the simulated annealing refinements performed using the program CNS (28Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). The NEP peptide model was then built into the residual electron density map using the graphics program XtalView (29McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). Finally, the FERM-NEP complex was refined by restraint least-squares refinement using the program REFMAC (30Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). Because the resolution was limited, tests of the peptide chain tracing were performed with several peptide models in the reverse direction and in different registers. These models gave higher free R values than that of the correct peptide chain tracing and resulted in poorer electron density for the peptide models. The peptide chain polarity was also supported by results of mutation analyses described below. The crystal contained three FERM-NEP complexes in the asymmetric unit. In one complex, the bound NEP peptide was well defined for 17 residues (residues 6-22) in the electron density map (blue in supplemental Fig. S1), whereas peptides bound to the other complexes gave poor electron density, probably due to crystal contacts with the neighboring molecules. Alanine models composed of five (residues 7-11, cyan in supplemental Fig. S1) and seven (residues 7-13, green in supplemental Fig. S1) residues were built for further refinement. The refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. The stereochemical quality of the model was checked using the program PROCHECK (31Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). No residue was found in a disallowed region as defined by the aforementioned program. Figures were prepared using the program PyMOL. Superposition of the FERM domains and peptides were carried out using the program LSQKAB (32Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Peptide Binding Experiment—Based on our crystal structure, the binding affinity for several mutated NEP peptides was examined by using surface plasmon resonance measurements (Biacore 3000, GE Healthcare) to identify determinant residues for the specificity (Fig. 5 and Table 2). Each dissociation constant between the NEP cytoplasmic tail and the radixin FERM domain was determined using equilibrium surface plasmon resonance measurements as previously described (4Terawaki S. Maesaki R. Hakoshima T. Structure. 2006; 14: 777-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The purified radixin FERM domain (0.2-10 μm) was injected into a streptavidin-coated sensor chip (sensor chip SA) to which each peptide was immobilized through the C-terminal biotinylated lysine. All binding experiments were performed at 25 °C with a flow rate of 10 μl min-1 in a buffer consisting of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.05% surfactant P20. The kinetic parameters were evaluated using the BIAevaluation software (GE Healthcare). KD values were calculated by averaging more than three independent measurements.TABLE 2Binding affinities of the NEP peptides for the radixin FERM domainTABLE 2Binding affinities of the NEP peptides for the radixin FERM domain Structural Determination—Previous experiments have shown that a glutathione S-transferase-fused 19-residue peptide of the NEP tail binds the radixin and moesin N-terminal fragments containing the FERM domain (16Iwase A. Shen R. Navarro D. Nanus D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11898-11905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The sequence of our NEP peptide was based on the mouse NEP cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 1A). The FERM-NEP complex crystals were obtained using the 22-residue NEP peptide and the structure was determined by molecular replacement using the free radixin FERM domain as a search model (11Hamada K. Shimizu T. Matsui T. Tsukita S. Hakoshima T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4449-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), and subsequently refined to 3.2-Å resolution with an R value of 23.3% (a free R value of 26.7%). The crystallographic statistics are summarized in Table 1. The asymmetric unit of the crystal contained three FERM-peptide complexes. The three FERM domains have essentially the same structure with an averaged overall deviation of 0.82 Å for 5-296 residues, and with an averaged deviation of 0.56 Å for each pair of subdomains (a detailed structural comparison is given in supplemental Fig. S2). The NEP peptide binds subdomain C of the FERM domain, whereas there were no direct contacts with subdomains A or B (Fig. 2). The Structure of the FERM Domain in the Radixin-NEP Complex—As previously reported, the radixin FERM domain consists of three subdomains: subdomain A (N-terminal residues 5-82, green) having a typical ubiquitin fold, subdomain B (residues 95-195, red) folded into an α-helix bundle, and subdomain C (residues 204-297, yellow) folded into a standard seven-stranded β-sandwich with a long capping α-helix (Fig. 2). The overall root mean square deviation between the FERM domain bound to the NEP peptide and the free radixin FERM domain is 0.80 Å for 292 Cα-carbon atoms. Pairwise superposition of each subdomain revealed that subdomain C in the NEP-bound form is similar to that of the ICAM-2-bound form (0.43 Å for 93 Cα-carbon atoms) rather than that on the free form (0.71 Å) (supplemental Fig. S3). Like subdomain C of the ICAM-2-bound form (4Terawaki S. Maesaki R. Hakoshima T. Structure. 2006; 14: 777-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 15Hamada K. Shimizu T. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Hakoshima T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), the groove between helix α1C and strand β5C of NEP-bound subdomain C is widened by induced-fit structural changes following peptide binding. NEP Peptide Conformation—As shown in Fig. 1A, the primary structure of the NEP cytoplasmic tail consists of three regions: an N-terminal polar region, a central amphipathic region containing hydrophobic residues, and a C-terminal juxtamembrane basic region. In our complexed structure, the N-terminal polar region is not observed in the electron density map, probably due to its flexibility. The amphipathic region forms a short β strand structure (residues 7-10; Met-Asp-Ile-Thr) followed by a hairpin structure (residues 11-14; Asp-Ile-Asn-Ala), whereas the C-terminal basic region (residues 16-22) forms an extended structure (Fig. 3). The overall peptide exhibits a kink (68°) at the hairpin (Fig. 3A). The extended structure of the C-terminal residues, however, would be induced by crystal contacts with the other two molecules in the asymmetric unit of the crystal. The hairpin resembles a type I reverse turn (Fig. 3B) but lacks the typical N+3 inter-main chain hydrogen bond. The peptide structure was stabilized by van der Waals contacts between Asp11 and Ala14 side chains in addition to interactions with the FERM domain as will be described. NEP Peptide Binding to the FERM Domain—The amphipathic region in the NEP peptide is essential for the interaction with the FERM domain. Seven residues (Met7-Asn13) of this region dock to a long shallow groove that is formed by nonpolar side chains from strand β5C and helix α1C of subdomain C (Fig. 3C) and bury 1,383 Å2 of the total accessible surface area. The β strand of the NEP peptide forms an anti-parallel β-β association with strand β5C of subdomain C followed by the hairpin docked into the large pocket P1 that is connected to the groove (Fig. 3B). In addition to four regular inter-main chain hydrogen bonds derived from the β-β association, two hydrogen bonds are formed between each main chain amide group of Ile12 and Asn13 of the NEP peptide and the main chain carbonyl group of Arg246 from strand β5C. Furthermore, the hairpin carbonyl groups of NEP interact with side chains Arg246 from β5C and His288 from helix α1C. These additional interactions contribute toward stabilization of the hairpin structure. The FERM-NEP contacts are summarized in Fig. 4A. Using surface plasmon resonance measurements, the wild-type mouse NEP cytoplasmic tail binds the mouse FERM domain with a KD value of 2.2 μm (Fig. 5 and Table 2). Mutations of the hairpin residues, Ile12 and Asn13, resulted in significant reduction in binding affinity, less than 20% binding affinity compared with that of the wild type in terms of KD values (I12A and N13A in Fig. 5), suggesting these residues are major contributors to binding affinity. The groove of subdomain C creates binding sites, S1-S4, for interacting with the side chains of the NEP β-strand (Fig. 3B). Sites S1 and S3 are formed Asn251, Ser249, and Asn247 from strand β5C, and accommodate the bulky side chains of NEP Met7 and Ile9 with for zipper-like interactions (Fig. 3C). Mutations suggested that these interactions are important for the FERM-NEP binding (Fig. 5). Site S4 formed by three nonpolar residues (Ile248, Leu281, and Met285) is deep and NEP Thr10 docked to this site makes intimate contacts with these residues. In fact, mutations of Thr10 resulted in a serious reduction of binding affinity. Contrary to this, site S2 is shallow and the interactions between NEP Asp8 and this site should be weak, which was supported by mutation. Because the side chain of Asp8 is directed toward the basic cleft between subdomains A and C, the negative charge of the side chain may contribute somewhat to electrostatic interactions. The FERM residues participating in the interactions with NEP are conserved in mammalian species (Fig. 4B). These results suggest the NEP binding motif, MXITXIN (Motif-1β). Comparison with the Radixin-ICAM-2 Complex—Previously, we reported the crystal structure of the radixin-ICAM-2 complex in which the ICAM-2 peptide forms a β strand followed by a short 310 helix for binding to the groove between helix α1C and strand β5C of subdomain C (15Hamada K. Shimizu T. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Hakoshima T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This binding site overlaps with the binding site for the NEP peptide of the current structure (Fig. 6A). Superposition of these peptides bound to the FERM domain showed that two β strands are located at the same binding site, where the NEP hairpin-binding site overlaps the ICAM-2 310 helix-binding site. The overlapping binding sites for NEP and ICAM-2 imply direct competition between NEP and adhesion molecules possessing Motif-1 sequences such as CD44 (16Iwase A. Shen R. Navarro D. Nanus D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11898-11905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) for ERM binding at a layer beneath the inner plasma membrane (Fig. 6B). The FERM-binding region of NEP has no apparent similarity with the ICAM-2 signature sequence RXXTYXVXXAorthe Motif-1 sequence (Fig. 1B) (15Hamada K. Shimizu T. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Hakoshima T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Structure alignment, however, revealed that some key residues important for FERM binding are replaced with homologous residues in NEP, whereas others are not conserved (Fig. 7A). Some of these nonconserved residues are involved in interactions with different FERM residues. An example of conserved replacement of residues involves replacement of ICAM-2 Val12 with NEP Ile12. The former is located at the N-terminal position of the 310 helix and the latter at the hairpin, and both play a similar role in binding to pocket P1. Another key residue, ICAM-2 Tyr10, which docks into site S4 and forms a hydrogen bond to the conserved radixin His288 (Fig. 7C), is replaced in NEP with a smaller residue, Thr10, which does not form a hydrogen bond to His288 (Fig. 7B). Instead, the main chain carbonyl group of Ile12 of the hairpin forms a hydrogen bond to His288 as described above. ICAM-2 Trp16 is located at the edge of the groove and forms a hydrogen bond to conserved radixin His288 (Fig. 7C), whereas Asn13 at the corresponding position forms a hydrogen bond with the main chains of loop β4C-β5C (Fig. 7B). The FERM domain of ERM proteins mediates the binding to a number of target proteins that are integrated in the plasma membrane or in the cytosol. Most of the target proteins are adhesion molecules represented by type I membrane proteins that have a single transmembrane helix followed by a C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. Generally, these C-terminal cytoplasmic tails possess a short (about 5 residues) juxtamembrane basic region, the FERM-binding region (11 residues in ICAM-2) containing the Motif-1 sequence and an additional C-terminal basic region. The Motif-1 sequence directly binds the groove formed by helix α1C and strand β5C of subdomain C of the FERM domain. Our present study confirmed that the NEP cytoplasmic tail binds to the same groove despite the absence of a Motif-1 sequence and the opposite polypeptide polarity of the tail. The NEP sequence forms a hairpin instead of the 310-helix of ICAM-2 for binding to pocket P1 of the groove. NEP Pro15 might prohibit formation of a 310-helix. In addition to binding to pocket P1, the NEP hairpin plays an additional important role in directing the C-terminal linker region, which contains a juxtamembrane basic region, toward the plasma membrane. We noticed that the C-terminal linker region is longer than those found in adhesion molecules such as ICAM-2, and is long enough to link the transmembrane helix and the FERM-binding region by being folded back toward the membrane. Several transmembrane-type proteases play important roles in cell-surface proteolysis for the processing of biologically active proteins or peptides that mediate a diverse range of cellular functions. Aberrant expression of these proteases has been implicated in various stages of oncogenesis (33Nanus D.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 6307-6309PubMed Google Scholar), an example of which involves NEP expression. Loss of NEP expression has been frequently observed in prostate cancer cells, which allows accumulated neuropeptides to bind their receptors and stimulate cell proliferation and migration (20Albrecht M.

Med. 1998; 4: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In addition to neuropeptidase activity, NEP is thought to participate in other biological processes that can affect the regulation of cell growth (34Sumitomo M. Shen R. Walburg M. Dai J. Geng Y. Navarro D. Boileau G. Papandreou C.N. Giancotti F.G. Knudsen B. Nanus D.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1399-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The effects of NEP are mediated by inactivation of substrates such as bombesin and endothelin-1 through its peptidase activity, and through direct protein-protein interactions with ERM proteins and the PTEN tumor suppressor protein (35Sumitomo M. Shen R. Nanus D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1751: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Hyaluronan receptor CD44 is co-localized with ERM proteins in epithelial cells including prostate cancer cells, and the hyaluronan-CD44-ERM complex has been shown to be involved in the migration of metastatic breast adenocarcinoma cells (36Harrison G.M. Davies G. Martin T.A. Jiang W.G. Mason M.D. Int. J. Oncol. 2002; 21: 935-940PubMed Google Scholar, 37Zohar R. Suzuki N. Suzuki K. Arora P. Glogauer M. McCulloch C.A. Sodek J. J. Cell Physiol. 2000; 184: 118-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Linking of the CD44 cytoplasmic tail to cytoskeletal components through ERM proteins is important for CD44-mediated adhesion or invasion. Truncation of the CD44 cytoplasmic tail reduces its capacity to assemble pericellular extracellular matrices and to bind hyaluronan (38Jiang H. Peterson R.S. Wang W. Bartnik E. Knudson C.B. Knudson W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10531-10538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Our previous studies showed a CD44 Motif-1-like sequence (QXXKLXIXXG) was involved in ERM binding (15Hamada K. Shimizu T. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Hakoshima T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Our present study revealed that NEP binding occurs at the Motif-1 binding site on the FERM domain and suggested that NEP binding to ERM proteins suppresses CD44-mediated cell adhesion by direct competition for ERM binding. In normal cells, NEP that is expressed and concentrated at a cell surface in excess relative to CD44 is able to sequestrate ERM proteins. Thus, our study provides a structural basis for NEP tumor suppression and the role of NEP loss in tumor progression (16Iwase A. Shen R. Navarro D. Nanus D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11898-11905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The C-terminal juxtamembrane region of the NEP cytoplasmic tail contains five basic residues (Lys16, Lys18, Lys19, Lys20, and Arg22), which are projected from the molecular surface of the FERM domain in our FERM-NEP complex. Similarly, the N-terminal basic residues of the ICAM-2 cytoplasmic tail are exposed toward the solvent region and do not participate in interactions with the FERM domain (15Hamada K. Shimizu T. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Hakoshima T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the juxtamembrane basic region of ICAM-2 interacts with negatively charged PIP2 (15Hamada K. Shimizu T. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Hakoshima T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 39Heiska L. Alfthan K. Gronholm M. Vilja P. Vaheri A. Carpen O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21893-21900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Like ICAM-2, the basic region of the NEP cytoplasmic tail may play a similar role through interactions with negatively charged phospholipids. Furthermore, the NEP cytoplasmic tail directly associates with the tumor suppressor PTEN through electrostatic interactions between the NEP cytoplasmic tail basic region (residues 16-22) and the phosphorylated C-terminal tail of PTEN (residues 380-385) (23Sumitomo M. Iwase A. Zheng R. Navarro D. Kaminetzky D. Shen R. Georgescu M.M. Nanus D.M. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 67-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). NEP constitutively recruits and activates PTEN, which antagonizes the activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase by dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase to PIP2, which inhibits the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase/Akt oncogenic pathway. Thus, the NEP cytoplasmic tail possesses cooperative activity and seems to play a key role in suppressing both cell adhesion, mediated by the CD44-ERM interaction, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase/Akt signaling pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2044034270,"Aqueous channels are at the core of the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) and the translocase of the inner membrane for the transport of preproteins (TIM23), the translocases mediating the transport of proteins across the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. Yet, the existence of a channel associated to the translocase of the inner membrane for the insertion of multitopic protein (TIM22) complex has been arguable, as its function relates to the insertion of multispanning proteins into the inner membrane. For the first time, we report conditions for detecting a channel activity associated to the TIM22 translocase in organelle, i.e. intact mitoplasts. An internal signal peptide in the intermembrane space of mitochondria is a requisite to inducing this channel, which is otherwise silent. The channel showed slightly cationic and high conductance activity of 1000 pS with a predominant half-open substate. Despite their different composition, the channels of the three mitochondrial translocases were thus remarkably similar, in agreement with their common task as pores transiently trapping proteins en route to their final destination. The opening of the TIM22 channel was a step-up process depending on the signal peptide concentration. Interestingly, low membrane potentials kept the channel fully open, providing a threshold level of the peptide is present. Our results portray TIM22 as a dynamic channel solely active in the presence of its cargo proteins. In its fully open conformation, favored by the combined action of internal signal peptide and low membrane potential, the channel could embrace the in-transit protein. As insertion progressed and initial interaction with the signal peptide faded, the channel would close, sustaining its role as a shunt that places trapped proteins into the membrane.

Most cells depend upon mitochondria to accomplish their programmed role. Along with mitochondria's own biogenesis, functioning and death entirely rely on protein translocation. The elevated protein content of mitochondria (∼700 different proteins in yeast (1Reichert A.S. Neupert W. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 555-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar)) and the four different compartments enclosed by their two membranes add to the complexity of protein trafficking pathways in this organelle. In addition, the need to maintain a low permeability of the inner membrane for coupling oxidative phosphorylation must be balanced with the passage of large molecules as proteins through water-filled channels.

The two channel activities of these translocases are remarkably similar and highly conserved among mammals and yeast, in accordance with their analogous function in protein translocation (6Peixoto P.M.

Slightly cation-selective and highly conductive channels of ∼1000 pS with a predominant half-open state of ∼500 pS have been described in proteoliposomes containing purified outer or inner membranes. The versatility of patch clamping combined with biochemical and genetic alterations of these two translocases has been essential to tackling their structure-function relationships and to pin down their subtle differences (6Peixoto P.M.

Chem. 2007; 282: 3584-3593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).Yet, the existence of a channel associated to the TIM22 translocase has been elusive and remains more arguable, as its function relates to the insertion of multispanning proteins into the inner membrane of mitochondria. Importantly, recombinant Tim22p has been reported to form channels when the protein is heterologously overexpressed, detergent-purified, renatured in proteoliposomes, and inserted into bilayers (20Kovermann P. Truscott K.N. Guiard B. Rehling P. Sepuri N.B. Muller H. Jensen R.E. Wagner R. Pfanner N. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 363-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The activity reported somehow diverges from that of the detergent-solubilized translocase when reconstituted in proteoliposomes and fused with planar bilayers (21Rehling P. Model K. Brandner K. Kovermann P. Meyer H.E. Kuhlbrandt W. Wagner R. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Science. 2003; 299: 1747-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar).To approach the basic question related to the existence of a channel activity intrinsic to the TIM22 translocase, in this study, the native membranes of mitochondria just devoid of most of the outer membrane (i.e. mitoplasts) were directly patch-clamped. In addition, vesicles fused with inner membrane fragments were characterized with this method. For the first time, we report the conditions to detect the channel activity inherent to the TIM22 translocase. The presence of an internal signal peptide was a requisite to triggering this channel, otherwise silent regardless of voltage. The effect of this internal signal peptide was side-dependent. Increasing concentrations of the peptide in contact with the intermembrane space side of mitoplasts progressively and cooperatively opened the channel. The properties of the TIM22 channel were remarkably similar to those of TIM23, in agreement with their purportedly analogous function at early stages of protein translocation. Still, conditions to discern both inner membrane channels are detailed. Interestingly, a low membrane potential was required to keep the TIM22 channel in its fully open conformation. These findings have a major implication for our current understanding of protein trafficking into the inner membrane of mitochondria and its modulation by signal peptides, as they portray TIM22 as a dynamic channel solely active in the presence of its cargo proteins. In its fully open conformation, favored by the combined action of internal signal peptide and low membrane potential, the channel could embrace the in-transit protein segments. As the process advanced and initial interaction with the internal signal peptides faded, the channel closed, sustaining its role as a shunt for the insertion of trapped proteins into the inner membrane.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIsolation of Mitochondria and Preparation of Mitoplasts and Proteoliposomes—Two strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Tim23(Gal10), and Tim22(Gal10), in which the expression of tim23 or tim22 genes is controlled by a Gal10 promoter, were used (22Milisav I. Moro F. Neupert W. Brunner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25856-25861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Cells were cultivated at 30 °C on SDLac medium with 2% glucose and 1% galactose. Alternatively, cells were collected and maintained for 24 h in the same medium without galactose, as described by Milisav et al. (22Milisav I. Moro F. Neupert W. Brunner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25856-25861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Mitochondria were isolated from logarithmically growing cells as previously described (18Muro C. Grigoriev S.M. Pietkiewicz D. Kinnally K.W. Campo M.L. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2981-2989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Homogenization buffer was 0.6 m sorbitol, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride containing protease inhibitor mixture (P8215; Sigma). Mitochondria mostly devoid of the outer membrane, i.e. mitoplasts, were prepared by the French press method (23Ohba M. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2117-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For reconstitution experiments, inner membranes were further purified according to Mannella (24Mannella C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Membrane purity was routinely assessed, and cross-contamination with the outer membrane was typically <10%. Inner membranes were reconstituted into giant proteoliposomes by dehydration-rehydration as previously described (18Muro C. Grigoriev S.M. Pietkiewicz D. Kinnally K.W. Campo M.L. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2981-2989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 25Lohret T.A. Jensen R.E. Kinnally K.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) using soybean l-α-phosphatidylcholine (Sigma Type IV-S).Patch Clamping Techniques—Patch clamp experiments were carried out directly on mitoplasts and on proteoliposomes containing purified mitochondrial inner membranes. Briefly, membrane patches were excised after the formation of a gigaseal using microelectrodes with ∼0.4-μm-diameter tips and resistances of 10–30 MΩ. Unless otherwise indicated, the solution in the microelectrode and bath was 150 mm KCl, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The voltage clamp was established with the inside-out excised configuration (26Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15093) Google Scholar) using a List-Medical d-61100 patch clamp amplifier. Voltages across excised patches were reported as bath potentials. The open probability, Po, was calculated as the fraction of the total time the channel spent in the open state from total amplitude histograms generated from current traces (40–60 s duration) with WinEDR Software (courtesy of J. Dempster, University of Strathclyde, UK). V0 is the voltage in which the channel spends half of the time open (Po, is 0.5). Filtration was 2 kHz with 5 kHz sampling for all analysis and current traces shown, unless otherwise stated. Permeability ratios were calculated from the reversal potential in the presence of a 150:30 mm KCl gradient as previously described (18Muro C. Grigoriev S.M. Pietkiewicz D. Kinnally K.W. Campo M.L. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2981-2989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Signal peptides were introduced in the pipette. Alternatively, the 0.5-ml bath was perfused with 3–5 ml of medium containing the desired peptides. Flicker rates were determined from current traces (40–60 s) as the number of transition events per second from the open to lower conductance states, with a 50% threshold (∼250 pS) of the predominant event.Immunoblotting—Mitochondrial proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar) and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Indirect immunodetection employed chemiluminescence (ECL by Amersham Biosciences) using horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies. Membrane proteins (1–5 μg/line) were labeled with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against yeast Tim23p or Tim22p. Anti-yeast voltage-dependent anionic channel, mouse monoclonal antibody was purchased from Molecular Probes-Europe. ImageJ version 1.34s (courtesy of NHI) was used to estimate the amounts of Tim22p and Tim23p and to assess the cross-contamination of the inner membranes. These values were extrapolated from the linear correlations obtained with increasing amounts of membranes.Peptides—Peptides were prepared by the Molecular Resource Facility of New Jersey Medical School (Newark, NJ). The internal signal peptide P2 was composed, in part, of an intermembrane space loop and the beginning of the fifth transmembrane segment of the phosphate carrier (TSTTLLNLLSGLT) (28Brix J. Rudiger S. Bukau B. Schneider-Mergener J. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16522-16530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). P2 was dissolved in 0.2% Me2SO. The presequence signal peptide (yCoxIV1–13) was based on amino acids 1–13 (MLSLRQSIRFFKP) from the amino terminus of the cytochrome oxidase subunit IV of S. cerevisiae and was dissolved in H2O. Peptide composition and purity were assessed by high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry and were typically >90% pure.RESULTSDecreasing Tim22p Does Not Affect the Electrical Behavior of the Mitochondrial Inner Membrane—Electrophysiological techniques play a key role in the study of mitochondrial protein import channels. The approach we undertook included direct patch clamping of mitochondria or mitoplasts and isolated membranes reconstituted into liposomes. With this methodology, the properties of TOM and TIM23 channels were depicted, and structure-function correlations were established between individual components of these translocases and their defined function (6Peixoto P.M.

Biochem. 2007; 362: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, to date, no channel activity can be assigned to the TIM22 translocase existent in mitoplasts. Still, proteoliposomes containing isolated mitochondrial inner membranes have not revealed any clues for its occurrence. In the search for the pore of the TIM22 translocase in native membranes, we attempted two experimental strategies based upon the use of yeast strains in which the essential genes tim22 or tim23 were controlled by a Gal10 promoter. As shown in Fig. 1, the expression of either Tim22p or Tim23p was reduced below 8% by withdrawal of galactose from the growth medium. In addition, our inner membranes were basically free of contaminant voltage-dependent anionic channel, the most abundant pore-forming protein of the outer membrane.First, we pursued whether reduction of Tim22p, the core component of the TIM22 translocase, modifies the electrophysiological behavior of the IM. Lipid vesicles containing isolated inner membranes from these mitochondria showed the typical channel activity we previously reported for TIM23 (18Muro C. Grigoriev S.M. Pietkiewicz D. Kinnally K.W. Campo M.L. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2981-2989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 29Martínez-Caballero S. Peixoto P.M.V. Kinnally K.W. Campo M.L. Anal. Biochem. 2007; 362: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), with a peak conductance of 1000 pS and a substate of 500 pS (Fig. 2A). As expected, the channel responded to perfusion with micromolar amounts of amino-terminal signal peptides with a significant increase in the flickering rate or rapid transitions from open to substate or closed states. Importantly, regardless of the Tim22p levels present in the membranes, the detection frequency of this channel activity remained the same. Fig. 2C shows that ∼50% of the total patches displayed single (occasionally double) channel behavior, whether the protein subsisted (control) or was drastically reduced (↓Tim22p) from the membranes. The behavior, frequency, and electrical properties of this channel activity were thus identical to that we previously described for TIM23 in the IM of several yeast strains (18Muro C. Grigoriev S.M.

Significantly, Fig. 2A also shows that the TIM23 channel was insensitive to perfusion with P2, an internal signal peptide of the phosphate carrier (28Brix J. Rudiger S. Bukau B. Schneider-Mergener J. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16522-16530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Effects of Tim22p and Tim23p on the channel activities of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Single channel current traces at +20mV of patches excised from inner membrane vesicles depleted of either Tim22p (A) or Tim23p (B). The perfusion chamber (∼0.5 ml) and the patch microelectrode contained 150 mm KCl, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Current was recorded before (Control) and after sequential perfusions with 3 ml of this medium containing 20 μm of the amino-terminal signal sequence yCoxIV (1–13) followed by 5 and 50 μm of the internal signal peptide P2. O, S, and C correspond to the open (1000 pS), sub-(500 pS), and closed states, respectively. A, the channel activity of 1000 pS of conductance recorded in the absence of Tim22p increases its flickering or rapid transitions from open to substate and closed state in the presence of yCoxIV (1–13). Perfusion with P2 does not affect the normal gating properties of the channel. B, no channel activity could be recorded in 92% of the patches in the absence of Tim23p. C, the histograms show the detection frequency of patches with channel activity found in inner membrane vesicles (Control) or lacking (↓) either Tim22p or Tim23p.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Decreasing Tim23p Eliminates the Channel Activity of the Mitochondrial Inner Membrane—A different strategy comports removal of Tim23p, the core component of the TIM23 translocase. Patches performed with these membranes were completely silent; i.e. no electrical activity could be detected at voltages up to ±150 mV. Fig. 2B contains representative current traces showing the lack of any channel activity. In addition, perfusion with either presequences or internal signal peptides was incapable of bringing about any electrical response on these membranes. Only in 8% of >120 different patches was some channel activity recorded (Fig. 2C). Analysis of these patches revealed the typical TIM23-like activity, sensitive to perfusion with amino-terminal signal peptides and insensitive to internal signal peptides (not shown). Most likely, this activity was because of the residual levels of Tim23p expression through the leaky galactosidase promoter, as established for analogous yeast strains (29Martínez-Caballero S. Peixoto P.M.V. Kinnally K.W. Campo M.L. Anal. Biochem. 2007; 362: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In addition, the channel of TIM23 was entirely independent of Tim22p. These results confirm our previous work in which the only channel activity related to protein import in the inner membrane of mitochondria was that of TIM23 (6Peixoto P.M. Martinez-Caballero S.

Biochem. 2007; 362: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar).Internal Signal Peptides Induce the Channel Activity of the TIM22 Translocase—The fact that silent patches were obtained in the absence of Tim23p presents the advantage of a system in which it is feasible to seek potential channel inducers. Internal signal peptides of carriers and other precursor proteins that use the TIM22 complex are among the possible channel triggers. P2 is a peptide present in the phosphate carrier that is specifically recognized by receptors of the TOM complex. Patches excised from proteoliposomes lacking Tim23p were perfused with increasing concentrations of P2 from the nanomolar to the micromolar range. This treatment had no effect whatsoever, and the membranes remained electrically silent regardless of the voltage (Figs. 2B and 4B). Startlingly, a novel channel activity became plainly evident when the peptide was instead included inside the patch microelectrode rather than the bath. Fig. 3 illustrates the progressive opening of a novel channel activity induced in the presence of increasing concentrations of P2 in the microelectrode. The detection frequency and the top conductance of this activity followed a hyperbolic correlation with the increase in P2. Maximum levels of both parameters were reached at concentrations ∼1 μm, and the AC50 values estimated were 0.3 μm. At least 100 patches were tested for each P2 concentration. The peak conductance calculated from current-voltage relationships reached 1100 ± 59 pS. Strikingly, this activity was not sensitive to amino-terminal presequences such as yCoxIV1–13, as revealed by the current traces and analysis of the flickering events per second (Fig. 3, A and C). Fig. 3C also compares the lack of effect of amino-terminal presequences on this novel channel activity with the well established increase in rapid flickering recorded on the TIM23 channel whether Tim22p was present (not shown) (18Muro C. Grigoriev S.M. Pietkiewicz D. Kinnally K.W. Campo M.L. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2981-2989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) or decreased (↓Tim22p) in the membranes. In addition, when the same conditions (i.e. P2 included in the patch microelectrode) were reproduced using the Tim22p-deficient strain, no electrical activity such as the one outlined in Fig. 3A could be recorded in >200 different patches. Even more, induction of channel activity by P2 was specific, as in >50 different experiments, only silent patches were observed at all voltages when 20 μm yCoxIV1–13 was included in the patch pipette. Altogether, these data indicate that the activity induced by the internal signal peptide does not correspond to that of TIM23. In addition, they point to TIM22 as the complex directly involved in this ligand-gated channel activity. The frequency of TIM22 channel in inner membrane lipid vesicles was approximately four times lower than that of the TIM23 channel, in agreement with the stoichiometry ratio reported for Tim22p and Tim23p (32Sirrenberg C. Endres M. Becker K. Bauer M.F. Walther E. Neupert W. Brunner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29963-29966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We could observe no correlation between P2 concentration and a possible voltage activation of the channel (data not shown). Interestingly, low membrane potentials were sufficient to achieve high open probabilities.FIGURE 4The TIM22 channel activity of mit"

PGHS peroxidase (POX) activity reduces PGG2 to PGH2. The first step in POX catalysis is formation of an oxyferryl heme radical cation (Compound I), which undergoes intramolecular electron transfer forming Intermediate II having an oxyferryl heme and a Tyr-385 radical required for COX catalysis. PGHS POX catalyzes heterolytic cleavage of primary and secondary hydroperoxides much more readily than H2O2, but the basis for this specificity has been unresolved. Several large amino acids form a hydrophobic “dome” over part of the heme, but when these residues were mutated to alanines there was little effect on Compound I formation from H2O2 or 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid, a surrogate substrate for PGG2. Ab initio calculations of heterolytic bond dissociation energies of the peroxyl groups of small peroxides indicated that they are almost the same. Molecular Dynamics simulations suggest that PGG2 binds the POX site through a peroxyl-iron bond, a hydrogen bond with His-207 and van der Waals interactions involving methylene groups adjoining the carbon bearing the peroxyl group and the protoporphyrin IX. We speculate that these latter interactions, which are not possible with H2O2, are major contributors to PGHS POX specificity. The distal Gln-203 four residues removed from His-207 have been thought to be essential for Compound I formation. However, Q203V PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 mutants catalyzed heterolytic cleavage of peroxides and exhibited native COX activity. PGHSs are homodimers with each monomer having a POX site and COX site. Cross-talk occurs between the COX sites of adjoining monomers. However, no cross-talk between the POX and COX sites of monomers was detected in a PGHS-2 heterodimer comprised of a Q203R monomer having an inactive POX site and a G533A monomer with an inactive COX site.

Molecular Dynamics simulations suggest that PGG2 binds the POX site through a peroxyl-iron bond, a hydrogen bond with His-207 and van der Waals interactions involving methylene groups adjoining the carbon bearing the peroxyl group and the protoporphyrin IX. We speculate that these latter interactions, which are not possible with H2O2, are major contributors to PGHS POX specificity. The distal Gln-203 four residues removed from His-207 have been thought to be essential for Compound I formation. However, Q203V PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 mutants catalyzed heterolytic cleavage of peroxides and exhibited native COX activity. PGHSs are homodimers with each monomer having a POX site and COX site. Cross-talk occurs between the COX sites of adjoining monomers. However, no cross-talk between the POX and COX sites of monomers was detected in a PGHS-2 heterodimer comprised of a Q203R monomer having an inactive POX site and a G533A monomer with an inactive COX site.

There are two PGHS isoforms, PGHS-1 and PGHS-2, which are also known as cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 (COX-1 and -2). PGHSs catalyze two reactions including a COX reaction in which arachidonic acid is converted to prostaglandin G2 (PGG2) and a peroxidase (POX) reaction in which PGG2 is reduced to PGH2 (1Smith W.L.

Both PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 are located on the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope (4Rollins T.E. Smith W.L. J. Biol.

Prostaglandin Thromboxane Leukotriene Res. 1995; 23: 29-34PubMed Google Scholar). In general, PGHS-1 is constitutively expressed, whereas PGHS-2 is inducibly expressed in many cell types (8Tanabe T. Tohnai N. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68–69: 95-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 9Kang Y.-J. Mbonye U.R. DeLong C.J. Wada M. Smith W.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2007; 46: 108-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The COX and POX reactions occur at structurally distinct but functionally interconnected sites of PGHSs (1Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2394) Google Scholar, 2Kulmacz R.J. van der Donk W.A. Tsai A.L. Prog.

In the POX reaction the Fe3+ protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) is first oxidized to an oxyferryl heme radical π -cation, referred to as Compound I, which is similar to Compound I of horseradish peroxidase (10Schulz C.E.

Compound I can either be reduced by exogenous reductants to an oxyferryl heme form (Compound II), or it can undergo intramolecular reduction, involving transfer of an electron from Tyr-385, forming a Compound II-like spectral intermediate and a tyrosyl radical (1Smith W.L.

Biochem. 1988; 171: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). This latter complex is known as Intermediate II and is analogous to the intermediate ES of cytochrome c peroxidase (16Erman J.E. Vitello L.B. Mauro J.M. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7992-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 17Houseman A.L. Doan P.E. Goodin D.B. Hoffman B.M.

Intermediate II is the COX active form of the enzyme. When arachidonic acid is present in the COX site, the Tyr-385 radical removes a hydrogen atom from C-13 of arachidonate, triggering the COX reaction (20Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5336-5343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intermediate II is regenerated within the COX site when PGG2 is produced. PGHS reconstituted with Mn3+-PPIX proceeds through a POX catalytic cycle analogous to that of Fe3+-PPIX PGHS, but formation of the mangano-Compound I-like species is much slower (21Tsai A. Wei C.

Chem. 1992; 267: 13870-13878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of the COX activity of PGHS-2 is triggered at a hydroperoxide concentration that is about 10 times lower than that required for PGHS-1 (24Lu G. Tsai A.L. Van Wart H.E. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16162-16167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This may be important in cells co-expressing PGHS-1 and PGHS-2, where PGHS-2 COX activity can function when PGHS-1 COX activity is latent (25Reddy S.T. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15473-15480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Shitashige M. Morita I. Murota S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1389: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). PGG2 is considered to be a natural substrate for PGHS POX activity, but other peroxides are also substrates. The identity of the peroxide that initiates COX activity in vivo is not known. PGHS-1 is reported to prefer primary and secondary alkyl hydroperoxides to H2O2 or bulky peroxides like t-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH). The molecular basis for this substrate preference is not known. Examination of the crystal structures of the POX active sites in ovine (ov) PGHS-1 (Fig. 1) and murine PGHS-2 indicate that the distal surface of the heme group is open to the solvent and that the site is sufficiently spacious to accommodate large and linear hydroperoxides coming directly from the aqueous environment (27Malkowski M.G. Ginell S.L. Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1933-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 28Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). A dome comprised of mostly hydrophobic amino acids lies above the distal surface of the heme, and Molecular Dynamics modeling has suggested that these residues can interact with alkyl chains of alkyl hydroperoxides related to PGG2 (29Seibold S.A. Smith W.L. Cukier R.I. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2004; 108: 9297-9305Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 30Chubb A.J. Fitzgerald D.J. Nolan K.B. Moman E. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). His-388 covalently binds to a high spin state iron in the heme plane as the fifth ligand, and a water molecule is thought to be the sixth heme ligand (31Seibold S.A. Cerda J.F. Mulichak A.M. Song I. Garavito R.M. Arakawa T. Smith W.L. Babcock G.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6616-6624Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Here we report studies designed to examine the molecular basis for the hydroperoxide substrate specificity of oPGHS-1. We first developed an improved method for obtaining steady state catalytic constants for PGHS POX activity that we used to quantify hydroperoxide substrate specificity. We then investigated a number of PGHS POX mutants to determine whether specific amino acids in the dome of the POX site are responsible for PGHS POX specificity. As part of these studies we reinvestigated the role of the distal glutamine (Gln-203) in catalysis. Finally, because we have found in previous studies that there is cross-talk between the COX sites of the monomers comprising PGHS dimers (32Yuan C. Rieke C.J. Rimon G. Wingerd B.A. Smith W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6142-6147Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we performed experiments to determine whether there is cross-talk between the POX and COX sites of partner monomers. Materials—15-Hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HPETE) was synthesized as described previously (33Graff G. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 86: 386-392Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) or purchased from Cayman Chemical Company. Ethyl hydroperoxide (EtOOH) was from Polyscience. t-BuOOH, H2O2, guaiacol, phenol, and NaCN were from Sigma. Polyoxyethylene-6-decyl ether (C10E6) was from Anatrace. Fe3+-protoporphyrin 1X (PPIX) and Mn3+-PPIX were from Frontier Scientific. Arachidonic acid, 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE), 15-ketoeicosatetraenoic acid (15-KETE), and 5-phenyl-4-pentenyl alcohol (PPA) were from Cayman Chemical Co.. Hexanes, isopropanol, and acetic acid were HPLC grade from Fisher. Other chemicals were analytical grade from Sigma. Mutagenesis, Protein Expression, and Purification—A cDNA for ovPGHS-1 containing a hexahistidine (His6) tag at the N terminus (34Smith T. Leipprandt J. DeWitt D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 375: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 35Song I. Ball T.M. Smith W.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was subcloned into pFastBac plasmid (Invitrogen). The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene) was used to construct the mutants. pFastBac plasmids were used for transposition of DH10Bac Escherichia coli cells following Bac-to-Bac expression system protocols (Invitrogen). Mutants were identified by antibiotic resistance and blue/white screening. DNA was isolated and used to transfect Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf-21) insect cells (Invitrogen) as a Cellfectin (Invitrogen) lipid-bacmid DNA complex. Baculovirus was precipitated from media with polyethylene glycol (Mr 3350), and the DNA fragments containing mutant PGHSs were amplified by PCR for further sequence verification. Media containing baculovirus with correctly mutated sites were harvested and used for cell infection. Sf-21 cells were infected with a multiplicity of infection of 0.01, and cell pellets were harvested 4 days later when cell viability had dropped below 85%. Cell pellets were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and broken by sonication. Cell lysates were solubilized for 1 h with 0.8% C10E6. The supernatant after ultracentrifugation at 158,000 × g x 2 h was incubated with 4 ml of Ni-NTA fast flow-agarose (Qiagen) per liter of cell culture in the presence of 5% glycerol, 500 mm NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole. The slurry was poured into a column and washed with washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 0.1% C10E6). Bound PGHS was eluted with three column volumes of 250 mm imidazole. These latter eluates were pooled, concentrated, and desalted using a Sephadex G-25 (Sigma) spin column, which was pre-swelled in desalting buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, 150 NaCl and 0.02% C10E6). A G533A/Q203R-huPGHS-2 heterodimer was constructed and expressed using procedures described previously (32Yuan C. Rieke C.J. Rimon G. Wingerd B.A. Smith W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6142-6147Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Mutated FLAG-tagged G533A-huPGHS-2 cDNA was cleaved from the pFastBac vector with StuI and KpnI and inserted downstream of Promoter p10 in pFastBac Dual vector that had been treated with SmaI and KpnI. Mutated His6-tagged Q203R-huPGHS-2 was cloned into Promoter PH of pFastBac Dual using the same strategy except that the EcoRI and HindIII were used to digest the DNA. The correct orientation and positions of the inserts were confirmed by sequencing and restriction digestion. The heterodimer was expressed in the baculovirus system as described above and purified by a combination of Ni-NTA and anti-FLAG-agarose chromatography (32Yuan C. Rieke C.J. Rimon G. Wingerd B.A. Smith W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6142-6147Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The purity was determined by SDS-PAGE and by Western blot analysis using anti-His6 and anti-FLAG antibodies (Sigma). POX Activity Assays—POX reactions were conducted in 100 μl of filtered and degassed buffer, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl. Heme-reconstituted PGHS (76 nm) containing 9.0 mm guaiacol was mixed with an equal volume of a peroxide substrate solution using a stopped-flow apparatus (SX-60 HiTech Instruments). Formation of the guaiacol oxidation product 3,3′-dimethoxydipheno-4,4′-quinone was monitored at 436 nm (ϵ436 = 6,390 m–1 cm–1 (36Putter J. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1975: 685-690Google Scholar). The initial velocity v was determined when guaiacol oxidation was linear with time. Plots of the initial velocities as a function of hydroperoxide substrate concentrations were used in the Michaelis-Menten equation v = Vmax[S]/(Km + [S]) to determine Vmax and Km values; kcat is the activity/mol of enzyme. COX Activity Assays—COX reaction mixtures contained 3 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 μm arachidonic acid, 1 mm phenol, and 5 μm hematin equilibrated in a glass chamber at 37 °C. Reactions were initiated by adding enzyme to the assay chamber. A Yellow Springs Instruments Model 53 oxygen monitor was used to monitor O2 consumption by native or mutant PGHSs with kinetic traces recorded using DasyLab (DasyTec) software. The rates reported are maximal rates occurring after a lag phase. One unit of COX activity is defined as 1 μmol of O2 consumed/min/mg of enzyme at 37 °C in the assay mixture. The lag time is defined as the time required for the COX activity to reach a maximum after initiating the reaction. Identification of POX Spectral Intermediates and Kinetic Analysis—Presteady state analysis of the POX reactions was performed with a rapid mixing and scanning technique using a stopped-flow apparatus equipped with double grating monochromators (DX-60 HiTech Instruments). ApoPGHS was reconstituted with Fe3+-PPIX or Mn3+-PPIX at a stoichiometry of 0.8 per enzyme monomer. The final heme concentrations were usually 1–2 μm, and substrate concentrations were 2–4 μm 15-HPETE or 50–100 μm H2O2. In single wavelength experiments at least 10-fold higher substrate concentrations were used to ensure steady state kinetics. Both the enzyme and substrate solutions were prepared in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.02% C10E6. The enzyme and substrate solutions in individual syringes were mixed rapidly by triggering them into a mixing chamber driven through an optical cell and stopped with a third syringe. Different oxidation states of Fe-PPIX or Mn-PPIX were monitored spectroscopically. In the case of Fe3+-PPIX, the signal decay at 411 nm is due to the consumption of resting enzyme and the formation of Compound I. A peak shift to 420 nm represents the formation of Compound II and Intermediate II; these two species have the same UV-visible spectral features. There are two isosbestic points in the spectral scans; 427 nm between resting enzyme and Compound I and 410 nm between Compound I and Compound II-Intermediate II. The kinetic traces were extracted from spectra at isosbestic points and fitted to exponential equations to obtain pseudo-first-order rate constants (kobs). For the second-order reaction of Compound I formation, k1 was the slope from the linear part of a plot of pseudo-first-order rate constants k1(obs) versus hydroperoxide substrate concentrations. For Intermediate II formation, k2 was numerically equal to the maximum k2(obs) at saturating substrate concentrations for the intramolecular two-species reaction system. With ovPGHS-1 reconstituted with Mn3+-PPIX, the resting enzyme (3 μm) when mixed with 50 μm 15-HPETE showed decreases in absorbance at 372, 472, and 561 nm and a new peak at 417 nm. A consecutive three-species model (SpecFit, BioLogic Science Instruments) based on a singular value decomposition algorithm was exploited to resolve intermediates derived from Mn3+-PPIX ovPGHS-1. Kinetic traces were collected at 417 nm and fitted to two exponential equations. A three-exponential equation was applied for higher substrate concentrations when side reactions (e.g. reduction of oxidized heme intermediates or suicide inactivation) may be involved. Cyanide Binding—Purified ovPGHS-1 proteins (1–3 μm) were reconstituted with 0.8 mol of Fe3+-PPIX/protein monomer and incubated at room temperature for 30–60 min. The protein solution was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and 1 ml of the supernatant was transferred to a quartz cuvette. Aliquots of a concentrated NaCN stock solution were added to the protein solution to yield final cyanide concentrations of 0, 0.08, 0.16, 0.24, 0.32, 0.40, 0.65, 1.15, 1.65, 2.90, 4.15, 6.65, 11.65, 16.65, and 26.65 mm. The protein-ligand mixture was incubated for 5 min for each concentration of cyanide. The absorbance changes measured at 430 nm where the maximum change occurs were fitted to ΔAU =ΔAUmax × [CN–]/(Kd + [CN–]) to calculate a dissociation constant (Kd). Analysis of 15-HPETE Reaction Products—POX reactions were conducted in a 500-μl reaction mixture containing 50 nm native ovPGHS-1 or Q203V-ovPGHS-1 dimer, 50 nm hematin, and 4.5 mm phenol in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at room temperature. The reactions were initiated by adding 15-HPETE (final concentration of 5 μm) and terminated at 2 min by adding 1.5 ml of a pre-cooled (4 °C) mixture of diethyl ether, methanol, 0.2 m citric acid (30:4:1). PPA (5 μm) was added as an internal control. The organic phase was shaken with 380 μl of a saturated NaCl solution at 4 °C to remove H2O. The upper organic layer was transferred to a clean tube and evaporated under N2. The products were dissolved in 100 μl of hexane:isopropanol: acetic acid (987:12:1; running solution) and resolved by HPLC on a Nucleosil Silica column (5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm, PJ Cobert Associates) mounted on a Shimadzu HPLC system equipped with diode array detector. The bound products were eluted with running solution at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. 15-HPETE and 15-HETE were monitored at 235 nm, and 15-KETE was at 279 nm. PPA was eluted after the other standards; it has a peak absorbance at 249 nm but was monitored at 235 nm. HPLC tracings were converted to bitmap format, and peak areas were quantified using WinDIG 2.5 digitizing freeware. MP2-level Calculations of the Heterolytic Bond Dissociation of an Bond—The quantum chemical calculations were carried out by using the second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation method (MP2) as implemented in the Gaussian98 software package (37Frisch M.J.

Gaussian, Inc., Pittsburg, PA2001Google Scholar). All the structures were geometry-optimized and their vibrational frequencies calculated using the 6–311++G** basis set in which polarization and diffuse functions are included. Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulation of PGG2 Binding to the POX Site—The protocol for creating a model of PGG2, inserting it in ovPGHS-1, and running molecular dynamics on the complex is described in detail in our previous work on a similar substrate (29Seibold S.A. Smith W.L. Cukier R.I. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2004; 108: 9297-9305Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). A brief summary is as follows. A molecular structure for PGG2 was generated using the MOE software package (38MOE Molecular Operating Environment. Chemical Computing Co., Montreal, Quebec H3B 3X3, Canada2003Google Scholar), and the resulting atom coordinates were optimized with use of Gaussian98 (37Frisch M.J. Trucks G.W. Schlegel H.B.

https://openalex.org/W2083347740,"The neuronal transporter excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (EAAC1) is enriched in perisynaptic regions, where it may regulate synaptic spillover of glutamate. In this study we examined potential interactions between EAAC1 and ionotropic glutamate receptors. N-Methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits NR1, NR2A, and NR2B, but not the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptor subunit GluR2, were co-immunoprecipitated with EAAC1 from neuron-enriched hippocampal cultures. A similar interaction was observed in C6 glioma and human embryonic kidney cells after co-transfection with Myc epitope-tagged EAAC1 and NMDA receptor subunits. Co-transfection of C6 glioma with the combination of NR1 and NR2 subunits dramatically increased (∼3-fold) the amount of Myc-EAAC1 that can be labeled with a membrane-impermeable biotinylating reagent. In hippocampal cultures, brief (5 min), robust (100 μm NMDA, 10 μm glycine) activation of the NMDA receptor decreased biotinylated EAAC1 to ∼50% of control levels. This effect was inhibited by an NMDA receptor antagonist, intracellular or extracellular calcium chelators, or hypertonic sucrose. Glutamate, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid with cyclothiazide, and thapsigargin mimicked the effects of NMDA. These studies suggest that NMDA receptors interact with EAAC1, facilitate cell surface expression of EAAC1 under basal conditions, and control internalization of EAAC1 upon activation. This NMDA receptor-dependent regulation of EAAC1 provides a novel mechanism that may shape excitatory signaling during synaptic plasticity and/or excitotoxicity.

This NMDA receptor-dependent regulation of EAAC1 provides a novel mechanism that may shape excitatory signaling during synaptic plasticity and/or excitotoxicity. Glutamate is an excitatory amino acid that elicits physiological and excitotoxic responses in the nervous system. Extracellular glutamate is normally maintained at low levels, allowing bursts of glutamate to generate postsynaptic responses during synaptic transmission. Tight regulation of extracellular glutamate is required to allow essential activity and prevent excitotoxicity (for reviews, see Refs. 1Danbolt N.C. Prog. Neurobiol. (N. Y.). 2001; 65: 1-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3701) Google Scholar, 2Amara S.G. Sonders M.S. Zahniser N.R. Povlock S.L. Daniels G.M. Adv.

Pin J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 205-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2704) Google Scholar), whereas AMPA, kainate, and NMDA receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that also activate intracellular signaling pathways. NMDA receptors have a high affinity for glutamate, are highly permeable to calcium, and do not readily desensitize, all of which contribute to the central role of NMDA receptors in excitotoxicity (5Sattler R. Tymianski M. Mol. Neurobiol. 2001; 24: 107-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 6Waxman E.A. Lynch D.R. Neuroscientist. 2005; 11: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar).Removal of extracellular glutamate in the forebrain is controlled by three major excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs): EAAT1 (GLAST), EAAT2 (GLT-1), and EAAT3 (EAAC1) (for reviews, see Refs. 1Danbolt N.C. Prog. Neurobiol. (N. Y.). 2001; 65: 1-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3701) Google Scholar and 7Sims K.D. Robinson M.B. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1999; 13: 169-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Glutamate transporters rapidly clear extracellular glutamate, thereby protecting neurons from excitotoxicity (for reviews, see Refs. 1Danbolt N.C. Prog. Neurobiol. (N.

Although GLAST and GLT-1 are mainly glial, EAAC1 is mostly neuronal (8Rothstein J.D. Martin L. Levey A.I. Dykes-Hoberg M. Jin L. Wu D. Nash N. Kuncl R.W. Neuron. 1994; 13: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). In area CA1 of the hippocampus, a neuronal transporter limits synaptic spillover of glutamate and activation of NMDA receptors (9Diamond J.S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8328-8338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because EAAC1 is the only neuronal transporter found in this location, this observation suggests that EAAC1 may control activation of some subtypes of NMDA receptors. A similar functional interaction is also observed in Xenopus oocytes, where co-expression of EAAC1 attenuates glutamate-evoked NMDA receptor currents (10Zuo Z. Fang H. J. Exp. Biol. 2005; 208: 2063-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). EAAC1 has also been linked to pathology in the nervous system. For example, antisense-mediated down-regulation of EAAC1 causes glutamate-induced cell death in the hippocampus (11Brustovetsky T. Purl K. Young A. Shimizu K. Dubinsky J.M. Exp. Neurol. 2004; 189: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 12Rothstein J.D. Dykes-Hoberg M. Pardo C.A. Bristol L.A. Jin L. Kuncl R.W. Kanai Y. Hediger M. Wang Y. Schielke J.P. Welty D.F. Neuron. 1996; 16: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2110) Google Scholar). However, some studies suggest that glutamate transporters contribute to excitotoxicity through transporter reversal during insults such as ischemia (13Rossi D.J. Oshima T. Attwell D. Nature. 2000; 403: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar, 14Roettger V. Lipton P. Neuroscience. 1996; 75: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Based on these studies, EAAC1 may play important roles in NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity.Whereas NMDA receptors are localized to presynaptic, synaptic, and extrasynaptic areas (15Janssen W.G. Vissavajjhala P. Andrews G. Moran T. Hof P.R. Morrison J.H. Exp. Neurol. 2005; 191: S28-S44Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), EAAC1 is enriched perisynaptically (16He Y. Hof P.H. Janssen W.G.M. Rothstein J.D. Morrison J.H. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 311: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 17He Y. Janssen W.G.M. Rothstein J.D. Morrison J.H. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 418: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), placing EAAC1 in close proximity to subpopulations of NMDA receptors. NMDA receptor activation can mediate both long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) (18Hardingham G.E. Fukunaga Y. Bading H. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar, 19Massey P.V. Johnson B.E. Moult P.R. Auberson Y.P. Brown M.W. Molnar E. Collingridge G.L. Bashir Z.I. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7821-7828Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Recent preliminary data presented in an abstract suggest that knockdown of EAAC1 may impair NMDA receptor-induced LTP (20Beckman M.L. Leary G. Awes A.N. Esslinger C.S. Poulsen D. Babcock M. Manzoni O. Kavanaugh M.P. 35th Annual Meeting of the Society for Neuroscience, November 12–16, Washington, D. C., Abstr. 38.15. Society for Neuroscience, Washington, D. C.2005Google Scholar). EAAC1 activity may, therefore, influence NMDA receptor function. Conversely, LTP increases glutamate uptake activity, which has pharmacological properties consistent with EAAC1 (21Levenson J. Weeber E. Selcher J.C. Kategaya L.S. Sweatt J.D. Eskin A. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This effect is associated with an increase in EAAC1 immunoreactivity in a subcellular fraction enriched in plasma membranes and is blocked by NMDA receptor antagonists (21Levenson J. Weeber E. Selcher J.C. Kategaya L.S. Sweatt J.D. Eskin A. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Therefore, EAAC1 and ionotropic glutamate receptors may be regulated by similar mechanisms that are normally controlled by NMDA receptor stimulation.In this study we sought to identify associations between ionotropic glutamate receptors and EAAC1. We found evidence for physical (co-immunoprecipitable) interactions between EAAC1 and the NMDA receptor in a variety of systems. In addition, co-expression of NMDA receptors with an epitope-tagged variant of EAAC1 increased the amount of biotinylated (cell surface) EAAC1 immunoreactivity. Finally, robust activation of the NMDA receptor rapidly (within 5 min) decreased the amount of biotinylated EAAC1 in hippocampal neuron-enriched cultures. This effect was blocked by chelation of intracellular or extracellular calcium or by hypertonic sucrose. These studies identify novel physical and functional interactions between NMDA receptors and the neuronal transporter EAAC1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESHippocampal Primary Culture—Neuronally enriched cultures were prepared from the hippocampus of 18–19-day Sprague-Dawley rat embryos (E18-E19) as described (22Wilcox K.S. Buchhalter J. Dichter M.A. Synapse. 1994; 18: 128-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, the hippocampi from rat embryos were trypsinized (0.027%) for 20 min at 37 °C in 7% CO2 and washed with Hanks' buffered saline solution. The tissue was triturated in warm media (10% defined, heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 10% Ham-s F-12 medium, and 80% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with penicillin/streptomycin), and cells were plated onto 60-mm poly-d-lysine-coated plates at a density of 6 × 105 viable cells per 35-mm culture dish. Neurons were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 with neurobasal media containing B27 (2%). Cultures, which include a heterogeneous mixture of pyramidal and non-pyramidal hippocampal neurons and a small percentage of astrocytes (generally <10%), were maintained for at least 17 days in vitro (DIV17) before experimentation unless otherwise indicated. In some studies cultures were maintained for shorter periods of time (8–9 days, DIV8–9) to model a less “mature” phenotype of synaptic development. At this earlier time, NMDA receptors are primarily composed of the NR1 and NR2B subunits with minimal levels of NR2A and minimal levels of the scaffolding protein PSD-95; this profile is similar to that observed early in development in vivo (23Tovar K.R. Westbrook G.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4180-4188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24O'Donnell L.A. Agrawal A. Jordan-Sciutto K.L. Dichter M.A. Lynch D.R. Kolson D.L. J.

Neuronal cultures maintained for 17 days express combinations of NMDA receptor subunits (NR1, NR2A, and NR2B) and scaffolding proteins (such as PSD-95) similar to those observed in adult animals and, therefore, may model the more mature synaptic milieu.Cell Culture—The rat C6 glioma cell line was grown and maintained as described (26Sheldon A.L. Gonzalez M.I. Robinson M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4876-4886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions this cell line only expresses the EAAC1 subtype of glutamate transporter (27Palos T.P. Ramachandran B. Boado R. Howard B.D. Mol.

We and others have used this cell line to study EAAC1 trafficking (28Davis K.E. Straff D.J. Weinstein E.A. Bannerman P.G. Correale D.M. Rothstein J.D. Robinson M.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2475-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Sims K.D. Straff D.J. Robinson M.B. J. Biol.

This system has an advantage of being relatively easy to transfect. In addition, the effects of protein kinase C activation, platelet-derived growth factor, and the constitutive trafficking of EAAC1 on and off the plasma membrane display similar characteristics to those observed in neuronal cultures (32Gonzaélez M.I. Kazanietz M.G. Robinson M.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 33Fournier K.M. Gonzaélez M.I. Robinson M.B. J. Biol.

Therefore, this system is analogous to differentiated NIH3T3 cells routinely used to study regulated trafficking of the GLUT4 subtype of glucose transporter (35Martin S. Slot J.W. James D.E. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 30: 89-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Incubation in NMDA Receptor Agonists and Selective Antagonists—Agonists and antagonists were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise indicated. To activate NMDA receptors, NMDA (10 or 100 μm) and glycine (10 μm) were diluted to a 5× concentration in conditioned neurobasal media with or without applicable inhibitors and then added directly to culture media for 5 min. Other treatments included glutamate (100 μm) with 10 μm glycine, thapsigargin (200 nm), AMPA (100 μm), cyclothiazide (50 μm), dihydroxyphenylglycine (250 μm), or bisindolmaleimide II (BisII; 10 μm). Cultures were preincubated with inhibitors for 30 min before treatment unless otherwise indicated. Compounds tested as potential blockers of the effects included d-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (d-APV; 1 mm), 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetra (acetoxymethyl) ester (BAPTA-AM; 50 μm), ethylene glycol EGTA (2 mm, 1 min pretreatment), W-7 (5 μm), FK506 (1 μm; a gift from Dr. Ted Dawson, Johns Hopkins University), KN62 (10 μm), 7-nitroindazole (100 μm), MDL28170 (10 μm), MG132 (10 μm; Calbiochem), LY294002 (10 μm), wortmannin (100 nm), SB203580 (1 μm), PD98059 (50 μm), dantrolene (10 μm), SKF-96365 (25 μm), 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (100 μm, 15 min pretreatment; Calbiochem), Ro25-6981 (10 μm), and sucrose (0.45 m). A mixture of voltage-dependent calcium channel inhibitors was also used, including nifedipine (2 μm), ω-agatoxin IVa (30 nm), and ω-conotoxin GVIA (100 nm). BAPTA-AM, W-7, FK506, KN62, 7-nitroindazole, MDL28170, MG132, SB203580, PD98059, and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate were dissolved in Me2SO, and experiments involving these inhibitors were compared with a 0.1% Me2SO vehicle control. Although dantrolene, nifedipine, ω-agatoxin IVa, ω-conotoxin GVIA, LY294002, and wortmannin were also dissolved in Me2SO, the highest concentration of Me2SO for these experiments was 0.02%, which did not affect EAAC1 distribution. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 during preincubation and treatment.Transient Transfection of C6 Glioma—C6 glioma were grown to 40–60% confluency on 35- or 60-mm plates and transfected using GenePorter (Genlantis, San Diego, CA), a lipid-based transfection kit. 35-mm plates were transfected with 3–4 μg of cDNA, and 60-mm plates were transfected with 5–7 μg of cDNA with a 5:1 ratio of GenePorter reagent to cDNA, diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as per the manufacturer's recommendations. Cultures were maintained for 18 h after transfection. All transfections included cDNAs for NR2A, NR2B (∈2), and Myc-EAAC1. This combination of cDNAs was co-transfected with either NR1 or pRC/CMV (control vector). During and after transfection, C6 glioma cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 500 μm ketamine, a concentration that prevents tonic toxic activation of NMDA receptors and consequent excitotoxicity (36Anegawa N.J.

Ketamine was included in all parallel comparison groups to exclude the possibility of nonspecific effects of ketamine with targets unrelated to NMDA receptors. Experiments were standardized for expression levels of Myc-EAAC1. In 2 of 5 experiments Myc-EAAC1 immunoreactivity in the lysate fraction was barely detectable; these Western blots were not quantitated.Transfection of HEK293 Cells—HEK293 cells were grown to 50–70% confluency and transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation (37Grant E.R. Bacskai B.J. Pleasure D.E. Pritchett D.B. Gallagher M.J. Kendrick S.J. Kricka L.J. Lynch D.R. J. Biol.

Experiments contained equal total amounts of cDNA. During and after transfection, HEK293 cells were incubated in minimum essential medium with 500 μm ketamine. MK-801 was not used to prevent toxicity because of the slow off-rate. d-APV was not used because in the presence of serum, high concentrations do not completely block toxicity, and the experiments can become quite expensive (for discussion, see Refs. 35Martin S.

Cultures were maintained for 18 h after transfection before experimentation.Co-immunoprecipitation—Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline solution and incubated in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm Tris-Cl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Calbiochem). Lysates were centrifuged at 16,600 × g to remove nucleic acids and cellular debris. Supernatants from 2 or more plates were pooled and precleared with protein G beads (Invitrogen) for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein lysates were separated into aliquots (150–225 μg of protein) and incubated with 3 μg of one of the following antibodies unless otherwise specified: EAAC1 (Alpha Diagnostics International, San Antonio, TX), EAAC1 (affinity purified, from Dr. J. D. Rothstein), Myc (BD Biosciences), NR1 (BD Pharmingen), NMDAR2C (1 μg; Invitrogen), rabbit IgG (Invitrogen), or mouse IgG (Invitrogen). After an overnight incubation at 4 °C, protein G beads (25 μl) were added and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. Beads were isolated by centrifugation and subsequently washed four times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer before the addition of 2× Laemmli sample buffer.Biotinylation Assays—Biotinylation of cell surface proteins was performed using hippocampal cultures or C6 glioma grown on 35- or 60-mm tissue culture dishes, as previously described (33Fournier K.M.

Briefly, after rinsing cells with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1 mm calcium chloride and 1 mm magnesium chloride (phosphate-buffered saline (Ca2+/Mg2+)), plates were incubated with 1 mg/ml N-hydroxysulfosuccinimidobiotin (NHS-biotin, Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline solution (Ca2+/Mg2+) for 30 min at 4 °C with slight agitation. After incubation, biotin was quenched using phosphate-buffered saline solution (Ca2+/Mg2+) containing 100 mm glycine for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were lysed using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 0.1% SDS and a mixture of protease inhibitors. Lysates were sonicated and centrifuged at 16,600 × g to remove nucleic acids and debris. Half of the lysate fraction was saved for analysis; the remaining lysate was agitated overnight at 4 °C with an equal volume of UltraLink immobilized monomeric avidin beads to isolate biotinylated proteins. The lysate-bead mixture was centrifuged, and the supernatant was retrieved (nonbiotinylated fraction) and saved for Western blot analysis. Beads were subsequently washed four times, and protein was eluted into SDS buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol (biotinylated fraction). The lysate, nonbiotinylated, and biotinylated fractions were all diluted in sample buffer such that the sum of the immunoreactivity in the biotinylated and the nonbiotinylated fractions should equal that observed in the lysate fraction if the yield from extraction is 100%.Western Blot Analyses—Western blot analyses were performed as previously described (38Guttmann R.P. Baker D.L. Seifert K.M. Cohen A.S. Coulter D.A. Lynch D.R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel. Antibodies directed toward these targets were utilized: EAAC1 (1:250; affinity-purified, from Dr. J. D. Rothstein), actin (1:10,000; Sigma), NR1 (1:1000; BD Pharmingen), NR1 (1:500; Chemicon International), NR2A (1:1500; Upstate Biotechnology, Charlottesville, VA), NR2B (1:500; Chemicon International MAB5220), NR2B (1:1000; Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), GLT-1 (1:10,000; affinity purified, from Dr. J. D. Rothstein), GLAST (1:100; affinity purified, from J. D. Rothstein), PSD-95 (1:2000; BD Biosciences), GluR2 (1:1000; Chemicon International), Myc (1:1000; BD Biosciences), and NMDAR2C (1:2000; Invitrogen). Primary antibody incubation was followed by mouse monoclonal or rabbit polyclonal horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (1:2500; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). Immunoreactivity was visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce) and exposure on x-ray film. Bands were quantitated using densitometry normalized to actin (lysate) and then expressed as a percentage of control (no treatment) for each fraction. Glutamate transporters routinely form irreversible aggregates upon solubilization that are not dissociated with standard SDS-containing sample buffer (39Haugeto Ø. Ullensveng K. Levy L.M. Chaudhry F.A. Honore T. Neilsen M. Lehre K.P. Danbolt N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27715-27722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Similar aggregates were observed in the present study. The amounts of monomeric and multimeric EAAC1 were quantitated and analyzed separately. Both species responded similarly, and therefore, data presented represent changes in the sum of the immunoreactivity of EAAC1 observed. Actin immunoreactivity in the biotinylated fraction was used to test for potential cell lysis. In all studies only a small percentage of actin immunoreactivity was detected in the biotinylated fraction (between 0 and 15%). In some cases data were represented as a percentage of transporter or receptor on the cell surface, calculated as (biotinylated/(biotinylated + nonbiotinylated)) × 100. When detecting more than one protein in a single experiment, nitrocellulose membranes were stripped (0.1 m glycine, pH 2.3 for 1 h) and then reprobed with the next antibody. Secondary antibodies were completely stripped before new antibody incubation. In instances where proteins of similar molecular weight were visualized (such as NR2A and NR2B), either primary antibodies requiring two different secondary antibodies were used, more than one gel was run with identical samples, or primary antibody was stripped off (confirmed by reincubating in secondary antibody and redeveloping).Statistical Analyses—Multiple comparisons were completed by analysis of variance followed by t test with Bonferroni corrections. Paired t test was used to directly compare values of two groups. When there were only two groups (vehicle and treatment) data were analyzed by one sample t test. For two-group comparisons with significantly different variances, data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney non-parametric tests. Statistical significance was set at a p < 0.05, computed using InStat (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).RESULTSInteraction of EAAC1 and NMDA Receptor Subunits—Because EAAC1 and ionotropic glutamate receptors may overlap in distribution (15Janssen W.G. Vissavajjhala P. Andrews G. Moran T. Hof P.R. Morrison J.H. Exp. Neurol. 2005; 191: S28-S44Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17He Y. Janssen W.G.M. Rothstein J.D. Morrison J.H. J. Comp.

Chem. 2004; 279: 34505-34513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), we examined potential interactions between EAAC1 and ionotropic glutamate receptors in primary hippocampal cultures. Using hippocampal culture lysates, a commercially available antibody specific to EAAC1 immunoprecipitated NMDA receptor subunits NR1, NR2A, and NR2B but not the AMPA receptor subunit GluR2 (Fig. 1A). Although a small amount of immunoreactivity of each NMDA receptor subunit was non-specifically detected with an IgG control, anti-EAAC1 always immunoprecipitated greater quantities of NMDA receptor subunit immunoreactivity. To verify the interaction between EAAC1 and NMDA receptors, immunoprecipitation was also performed using a different affinity purified EAAC1 antibody (from Dr. J. D. Rothstein). This antibody also immunoprecipitated NR1 (Fig. 1B). Because anti-EAAC1 immunoprecipitated NR1, NR2A, and NR2B, we aimed to identify the subpopulation of NMDA receptors with which EAAC1 may interact by immunoblotting for post-synaptic density 95 (PSD-95), a scaffolding protein of NMDA receptors in the postsynaptic density (40Sans N. Petralia R.S. Wang Y.X. Blahos 2nd, J. Hell J.W. Wenthold R.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1260-1271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these experiments one of the anti-EAAC1 antibodies (from Dr. J. D. Rothstein) immunoprecipitated PSD-95 (n = 2), whereas the other anti-EAAC1 antibody did not (n = 4). The former anti-EAAC1 antibody also immunoprecipitated more NR1 than the latter, although both antibodies immunoprecipitated comparable amounts of EAAC1 (n = 2).To determine whether this interaction can be observed in another system, we utilized a model in which NMDA receptor subunit composition could be manipulated. C6 glioma endogenously express EAAC1 (28Davis K.E. Straff D.J. Weinstein E.A. Bannerman P.G. Correale D.M. Rothstein J.D. Robinson M.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2475-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but not NR1 (Fig. 1C, first lane). Small amounts of endogenous NR2A and NR2B were observed in C6 glioma (data not shown), but"

https://openalex.org/W2091533197,"UDP-glucuronosyltransferases 1A isoforms belong to a superfamily of microsomal enzymes responsible for glucuronidation of numerous endogenous and exogenous compounds. The nine functional UGT1A isoforms are encoded by a single UGT1A gene locus with multiple first exons. The expression of the UGT1A transcripts was measured by quantitative RT-PCR in 23 normal human tissues. The tissue-specific expression patterns were observed in 13 tissues. To understand the regulation mechanism that is responsible for the tissue-specific expression patterns, we scanned the DNA sequence alignments of the putative promoter regions, exon 1 sequences and intron 1 sequences for those expression-pattern-linked nucleotides. Using one of the expression-pattern-linked nucleotides for livers as an example, we showed that a database comprised of these expression-pattern-linked nucleotides could be used to generate focused hypotheses on the problem of tissue-specific expression, which is critical for tissue-specific pharmacodynamics of anticancer drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1992736892,"Hypergammaglobulinemia and polyclonal B-cell activation commonly occur in Plasmodium sp. infections. Some of the antibodies produced recognize self-components and are correlated with disease severity in P. falciparum malaria. However, it is not known whether some self-reactive antibodies produced during P. falciparum infection contribute to the events leading to cerebral malaria (CM). We show here a correlation between self-antibody responses to a human brain protein and high levels of circulating TNF alpha (TNFalpha), with the manifestation of CM in Gabonese children.To study the role of self-reactive antibodies associated to the development of P. falciparum cerebral malaria, we used a combination of quantitative immunoblotting and multivariate analysis to analyse correlation between the reactivity of circulating IgG with a human brain protein extract and TNFalpha concentrations in cohorts of uninfected controls (UI) and P. falciparum-infected Gabonese children developing uncomplicated malaria (UM), severe non-cerebral malaria (SNCM), or CM.The repertoire of brain antigens recognized by plasma IgGs was more diverse in infected than in UI individuals. Anti-brain reactivity was significantly higher in the CM group than in the UM and SNCM groups. IgG self-reactivity to brain antigens was also correlated with plasma IgG levels and age. We found that 90% of CM patients displayed reactivity to a high-molecular mass band containing the spectrin non-erythroid alpha chain. Reactivity with this band was correlated with high TNFalpha concentrations in CM patients. These results strongly suggest that an antibody response to brain antigens induced by P. falciparum infection may be associated with pathogenic mechanisms in patients developing CM."
https://openalex.org/W2001444852,"NCF2, the gene encoding the NADPH oxidase cytosolic component p67phox, is up-regulated by TNF-α, and we recently mapped a region in the NCF2 promoter that was required for this TNF-α-dependent response. Because this TNF-α-responsive region (TRR) lacked recognizable transcription factor binding elements, we performed studies to identify factors involved in regulating NCF2 via the TRR. Using the TRR sequence as bait in a yeast one-hybrid screen, we identified the zinc finger transcription factor Pleomorphic Adenoma Gene-Like 2 (PLAGL2) as a candidate regulator of NCF2 expression. PLAGL2-specific antibodies were generated that detected the native and SUMO1-modified forms of endogenous PLAGL2. EMSA and DNA-binding protein affinity purification analyses demonstrated specific binding of in vitro-translated as well as endogenously expressed PLAGL2 to the TRR, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated enhanced binding of endogenous PLAGL2 to the TRR in vivo with TNF-α treatment. Knockdown of PLAGL2 protein inhibited up-regulation of NCF2 transcript, p67phox protein expression, and subsequent superoxide production in response to TNF-α. Furthermore, relative levels of native and SUMO1-modified endogenous PLAGL2 protein were modulated in a time-dependant manner in response to TNF-α treatment.

VOLUME 282 (2007) PAGES 17941-17952Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 282Issue 29PreviewPAGE 17951: Full-Text PDF Open Access The NADPH oxidase is a multicomponent, enzyme complex consisting of both membrane-bound and cytosolic components and is found in all phagocytic leukocytes, such as monocytes and neutrophils, where it plays an essential role in host defense against pathogens (reviewed in Ref. 1Quinn M.T. Ammons M.C. DeLeo F.R. Clin. Sci. 2006; 111: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Activation of the NADPH oxidase catalyzes electron transfer from NADPH to molecular oxygen, resulting in the production of superoxide anion ( O2.¯) (2Cross A.R. Segal A.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1657: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). While O2.¯ is in itself not highly microbicidal, conversion of O2.¯ into more toxic reactive oxidants, such as hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorous acid, is required for pathogen killing (3Babior B.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). The essential NADPH oxidase components include a membrane-bound flavocytochrome b558, which is a heterodimer of gp91phox and p22phox, and the cytosolic proteins p47phox, p67phox, and p40phox (reviewed in Ref. 4Quinn M.T. Gauss K.A. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2004; 76: 760-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Additionally, activation of the NADPH oxidase requires the small GTPase Rac(1/2) (5Bokoch G.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 163-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Cell-free NADPH oxidase assays suggest flavocytochrome b558 and p67phox are sufficient for a functional oxidase; however, in vivo the system is clearly more complicated (reviewed in Ref. 6Mizrahi A. Berdichevsky Y. Ugolev Y. Molshanski-Mor S. Nakash Y. Dahan I. Alloul N. Gorzalczany Y. Sarfstein R. Hirshberg M. Pick E. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2006; 79: 881-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although the specific role of p67phox in enzyme function is still being determined, it has been proposed that p67phox is an NADPH-binding protein (7Smith R.M. Connor J.A. Chen L.M. Babior B.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and Dang et al. (8Dang P.M.C. Johnson J.L. Babior B.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3069-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) subsequently showed that p67phox was able to directly bind NADPH. In addition, several groups have shown that p67phox binding to flavocytochrome b558 induces conformational changes in flavocytochrome b558, resulting in initiation of electron flow (9Gorzalczany Y.

The physiological importance of p67phox in NADPH oxidase function is demonstrated by certain forms of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), which are caused by autosomal mutations in NCF2 (12Leto T.L. Lomax K.J. Volpp B.D. Nunoi H. Sechler J.M.G. Nauseef W.M. Clark R.A. Gallin J.I. Malech H.L. Science. 1990; 248: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Patients with CGD have an inactive NADPH oxidase, making them susceptible to recurrent bacterial and fungal infections (reviewed in Ref. 13Bylund J. Goldblatt D. Speert D.P. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2005; 568: 67-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Regulation of p67phox expression appears distinct from other phox proteins, as p67phox is the last phox protein to be expressed during cellular differentiation, and its expression correlates the closest with the acquisition of oxidase activity (14Hua J. Hasebe T. Someya A. Nakamura S. Sugimoto K. Nagaoka I. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2000; 68: 216-224PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it has been proposed that p67phox may be the rate-limiting cofactor in NADPH oxidase activation (10Paclet M.H. Coleman A.W. Vergnaud S. Morel F.

A number of studies indicate that cytokines and inflammatory mediators can modulate the level of expression of several oxidase proteins, including p67phox, in mature neutrophils and monocyte/macrophages via transcriptional regulation (17Cassatella M.A. Bazzoni F.

Although the TRR contained no apparent consensus binding sites for currently known transcription factors, DNase footprinting analysis demonstrated binding of nuclear factors to the NCF2 promoter in the region of the TRR (21Gauss K.A.

In the present studies, we used the NCF2 TRR sequence in a yeast one-hybrid screen to identify transcription factors involved in NCF2 regulation. We identified a zinc finger transcription factor, Pleomorphic Adenoma Gene-Like 2 (PLAGL2), as an important regulatory factor that binds the NCF2 TRR and regulates NCF2 gene expression in response to TNF-α. Materials—Human TNF-α was from Research Diagnostics, Inc. (Flanders, NJ). Anti-TFIIB antibody was from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA). 3-Amino-1,2,4,-triazole (3-AT) was purchased from Sigma Co. Yeast S.D. minimal base media and amino acid supplements were from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). Unless otherwise noted, all oligomers and primers were from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Anti-SUMO1 antibodies were from Abcam, Inc. (Cambridge, MA). TrueBlot secondary immunoblot antibodies (anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG) were from eBioscience (San Diego, CA). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were from Bio-Rad. Cell Culture—MonoMac1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, non-essential amino acids, and sodium pyruvate. HL60 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, non-essential amino acids, and sodium pyruvate. Neutrophils and monocytes were purified from human blood collected from healthy donors in accordance with a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board at Montana State University. Neutrophils were purified using dextran sedimentation, followed by Histopaque 1077 gradient separation and hypotonic lysis of red blood cells, as described previously (21Gauss K.A. Bunger P.L.

Purified neutrophils and monocytes were suspended at 105 and 107 cells/ml, respectively, in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Yeast One-hybrid Assay—The Matchmaker one-hybrid system (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol with some modifications. The TRR sequence between -56 and -16 base pairs upstream of the NCF2 ATG start site was self-ligated to obtain a triplicate sequence. The triplicate TRR was inserted into the TOPO4 Blunt end vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), excised with EcoR1, and ligated into the bait vectors pHISi, pHIS-1, and pLacZi. Recombinant plasmids were linearized with XhoI for pHISi(TRR) and pHIS-1(TRR) and NcoI for pLacZi(TRR). Linearized plasmids were integrated into the genome of yeast strain Y187, combining each of the HIS reporter vectors with the LacZi reporter vector. Selection with media lacking both histidine and uracil selected for clones with both vectors integrated. The double reporter clones were plated on media lacking histidine and uracil and titrated with 0-50 mm 3-AT to determine stringency levels of the leaky HIS3 expression for the two clones Y187[pHISipLacZi(TRR)] and Y187[pHIS-1pLacZi(TRR)]. 35 mm 3-AT was used to obtain the high-stringency clone Y187[pHIS-1pLacZi(TRR)] and the low stringency clone Y187[pHISipLacZi(TRR)]. Additionally, transformed clones were assayed for auto-activity. The AH109 yeast strain was transformed with a human leukocyte cDNA library (Clontech) and selected on media lacking leucine. The bait strain (Y187) and the prey strain (AH109) were mated, and double-positive diploid clones were selected on media lacking histidine, uracil, and leucine, but supplemented with 35 mm 3-AT. Positive clones were restreaked on selective media and tested for β-galactosidase activity with an agar overlay assay. Clones positive for β-galactosidase activity for 24 h were then harvested. The prey plasmids from positive clones were extracted, amplified in E. coli, sequenced, and analyzed using the BLAST algorithm. Cloning and Expression of PLAGL2—Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to amplify PLAGL2 cDNA from human neutrophil RNA extracted using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Primer sequences of the PLAGL2 sense and antisense primers were 5′-GAATTCAGCCTTGCCATGACCACATTT-3′ and 5′-GAATTCTTGAACCCAGCTCTGAAACG-3′, respectively. Full-length PLAGL2 cDNA was cloned into the pcDNA3.1 eukaryotic expression vector, and the pcDNA3.1(PLAGL2) plasmid was used to express full-length PLAGL2 in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate TnT system (Promega, Madison, WI). The TnT product was immunoblotted using anti-PLAGL2 antibody to confirm the presence and correct size of in vitro transcribed and translated PLAGL2. Specificity of the band was established using peptide antigen as a blocking agent. cDNA and RT-PCR Panel Screening—PLAGL2 gene expression was analyzed in adult human, fetal human, and human immune system cDNA panels (Clontech) using standard PCR conditions (30 cycles of 94 °C, 15 s, 55 °C, 30 s, 68 °C, 30 s). PLAGL2-specific primer sequences were: sense primer, 5′-CAGAGCCCGTGGACATGTT-3′ and antisense primer, 5′-CATTACGTCCCGAGAGGCC-3′. Expression was normalized to two housekeeping genes, 18S and GAPDH. Total RNA was isolated from cell lines and human neutrophils and monocytes, and cDNA was prepared, as previously described (21Gauss K.A. Bunger P.L. Larson T.C. Young C.J. Nelson-Overton L.K. Siemsen D.W. Quinn M.T. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2005; 77: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). PCR amplification was performed as above. PLAGL2 expression was normalized to previously amplified housekeeping genes 18S and GAPDH (21Gauss K.A. Bunger P.L. Larson T.C. Young C.J. Nelson-Overton L.K. Siemsen D.W. Quinn M.T. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2005; 77: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Anti-PLAGL2 Antibody Preparation and Characterization—A peptide corresponding to human PLAGL2 amino acid residues 50-68 (SNGEKLRPHSLPQPEQRPY) (Macromolecular Resources, Ft. Collins, CO) was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH, Sigma) using a 25% glutaraldehyde solution (Sigma). KLH-peptide was used to immunize rabbits for polyclonal antibodies and mice for monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies were obtained through fusion of the hyperimmune splenocytes with the myeloma line Sp2/0, as previously described (23Jutila M.A. Watts G. Walcheck B. Kansas G.S. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1565-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The fusion was screened against recombinant GST-PLAGL2 protein, and positive clones were subcloned by limiting dilution and rescreened by immunoblotting. Polyclonal anti-PLAGL2 IgG was purified from rabbit antiserum using Protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). Monoclonal and polyclonal anti-PLAGL2 antibodies were characterized using recombinant PLAGL2-GST, rabbit reticulocyte in vitro translated PLAGL2, and human cell line extracts (HL60 and MonoMac1). Specificity of immunoblot analysis was confirmed using 5 μg/ml peptide antigen as a blocking agent. Unless otherwise indicated, rabbit polyclonal anti-PLAGL2 antibodies were used for immunoblot analysis and mouse monoclonal anti-PLAGL2 antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoprecipitation was performed by preclearing 2 μg of MonoMac1 nuclear or cytoplasmic extract with TrueBlot anti-mouse IgG beads for 30 min at 4 °C and then incubating the samples with or without anti-PLAGL2 antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After addition of 50 μl of TrueBlot anti-mouse IgG beads, samples were incubated an additional 4 h at 25 °C, and the beads were washed three times with wash buffer (50 μm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 μm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40). Bound proteins were eluted by heating the beads for 5 min at 95 °C in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 50 μm dithiothreitol and analyzed by immunoblotting with polyclonal anti-SUMO1 and anti-PLAGL2 antibodies. For p67phox immunoblot analysis, cells were seeded at 3 × 105 cells/ml and treated with morpholino 36 h prior to harvest. At 12 h prior to harvest 20 ng/ml TNF-α was added. Protein was extracted using a CelLytic NuCLEAR extraction kit (Sigma), and cytosolic fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-p67phox polyclonal antibodies (24DeLeo F.R. Ulman K.V. Davis A.R. Jutila K.L. Quinn M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17013-17020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Blots were quantified by densitometry. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Complementary oligonucleotides for the TRR and PLAG family consensus (PLAGcon) sequences (see Fig. 4) were annealed by heating to 95 °C for 2 min and cooled to room temperature. Probes were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Ambion, Austin, TX), purified using NucAway Spin columns (Ambion), and specific activity was determined. Binding reactions were performed by preincubating 3 μl of rabbit reticulocyte-generated PLAGL2 protein for 30 min on ice in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 50 μm ZnCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μg poly(dA-dT) or poly(dI-dC). 1 ng of end-labeled probe was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for an additional 30 min. For competition assays, unlabeled double-stranded (ds) DNA was incubated with the reaction mixture prior to addition of labeled probe. For supershift reactions, 10 μg of protein G purified, polyclonal anti-PLAGL2 antibody was added to the reaction mixture prior to addition of the labeled probe. Samples were run on NOVEX 6% DNA Retardation gels (Invitrogen) in TBE running buffer (89 mm Tris-Base, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.3). Band shifts were visualized using autoradiography and quantified by densitometry. Isolation of Nuclear Extracts—HL60 and MonoMac1 cells were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/ml, allowed to recover for 9 h, and treated with 20 ng/ml TNF-α for the indicated times. Primary human monocytes were plated at 105 cells/ml in RPMI on Primaria plates (BD Biosciences) precoated with fetal bovine serum, allowed to recover overnight, and treated with fresh RPMI containing 20 ng/ml TNF-α for the indicated times. Primary human neutrophils were plated at 5.5 × 106 cells/ml RPMI on Primaria plates precoated for 1 h with 20% autologous serum and treated immediately with 20 ng/ml TNF-α. For all cells, nuclear extracts were prepared using a CelLytic NuCLEAR extraction kit (Sigma), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Lysis was performed in the presence of 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) (Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium) for detection of PLAGL2. Nuclear extracts were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. DNA-binding Protein Affinity Purification—The bait sequence was prepared by ligation of the TRR sequence at 16 °C to obtain a TRR multimer of ∼11-23 repeats. 50 pmol of TRR multimer was ligated to the biotinylated oligonucleotide linker sequence bound to streptavidin-coated magnetic particles (Roche Applied Science) at 25 °C for 1 h. The TRR-coated particles were washed repeatedly and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 50 μg of HL60 cell nuclear extract in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm ammonium sulfate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 6.25 μg of poly(dI-dC), 0.63 μg of poly-l-lysine). The beads were washed, TRR-binding proteins were eluted with binding buffer containing 2 m KCl for 30 min at 4 °C, and the eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. TRR-binding proteins were detected via silver staining and immunoblot analysis using anti-PLAGL2 antibodies. Magnetic beads lacking the ligated TRR sequence were analyzed in parallel to determine background protein binding. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assays were performed using a ChIP-IT kit (Active Motif), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/ml and treated with 20 ng/ml TNF-α for 12 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (4 × 107 total cells), resuspended in RPMI containing 1% formaldehyde, and fixed for 10 min at room temperature. Nuclear extracts were prepared from the fixed cells, and enzymatic shearing of the chromatin was performed at 37 °C for 10 min, followed by addition of ice-cold EDTA to stop the reaction. Sheared chromatin was precleared with protein G beads prior to incubation overnight at 4 °C with 4 μg of anti-PLAGL2 antibody, negative IgG control antibody, or positive control antibody against TFIIB (Active Motif), which binds the GAPDH promoter. A sample of precleared chromatin was reserved for the input in PCR analysis. Antibody/DNA complexes were precipitated with protein G beads, washed, and eluted with a 1% SDS solution. RNA was digested with RNase A, and cross-links were reversed by overnight incubation at 65 °C. Protein was digested with Proteinase K for 2 h at 42 °C, and DNA was purified using the on-column purification method (Active Motif). Purified, immunoprecipitated chromatin fragments were subjected to quantitative real-time PCR using SYBR Green dye and an ABI 7500 Real Time PCR System, according to the manufacturer's protocol for absolute quantification (ABI). 25 μl of immunoprecipitated DNA in a 50-μl reaction was subjected to 45 amplification cycles. The reserved input DNA was used to obtain the standard curve. PCR amplification of the NCF2 TRR was performed with primers flanking the TRR (sense primer, 5′-ATCTGGCCCAGAAAGTGA-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-CTTCATTCCAGAGGCTGATGG-3′). Primers were optimized on ChIP input template DNA, and specificity was established with dissociation curves. All real-time amplifications were performed in triplicate, and antibody enrichment for the TRR sequence was calculated as % of DNA input. For comparison of transcription factor promoter binding efficiency between TNF-α-treated and untreated cells, anti-TFIIB immunoprecipitated DNA was amplified 40 cycles with primers to the GAPDH promoter (sense primer 5′-TACTAGCGGTTTTACGGGCG-3′ and antisense primer 5′-TCGAACAGGAGGAGCAGAGAGCGA-3′). Anti-PLAGL2 immunoprecipitated DNA was amplified 40 cycles with primers to the TRR (see above). PCR products were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide. Morpholino Oligomer Inhibition of PLAGL2 Expression—The morpholino antisense oligomer sequences used were MO1 (5′-CATGTTATTGAGAAAGCCTCCCCAT-3′) and MO2 (5′-CGCTGGTGAAAAATGTGGTCATGGC-3′), and the inverted morpholino oligomer sequences used were MO1in (5′-TACCCCTCCGAAAGAGTTATTGTAC-3′) and MO2in (5′-CGGTACTGGTGTAAAAGTGGTCGC-3′). Morpholinos were delivered into MonoMac1 cells using the EndoPorter delivery system (Gene-Tools, LLC, Philomath, OR). Briefly, MonoMac1 cells were resuspended in fresh media with 10 μm morpholino oligomer and 6 μl/ml EndoPorter in complete medium. To verify morpholino delivery, cells were transfected with antisense FITC-labeled morpholino oligomer or mock-transfected and plated for 24 h. Cells were harvested, washed, resuspended in fresh media, and viewed with a fluorescent microscope at 100×. To assay for inhibition of PLAGL2 expression, cells were incubated 24 h with the antisense morpholino oligomer, harvested, and lysed. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-PLAGL2 antibody. To evaluate changes in NCF2 expression, MonoMac1 cells were incubated 24 h with either the antisense or inverted morpholino oligomers, mock-transfected, or not treated with morpholino. Half of each sample was then treated with TNF-α for 12 h. Cells were harvested, and RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Mini Kit. NCF2 mRNA was quantified using the ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR System with gene-specific NCF2 and β-actin probes and primers (ABI). One-step amplification was achieved using the One-Step TaqMan RT-PCR kit (ABI), and amplification was carried out for 40 cycles. Samples were normalized to β-actin. Analysis of O2.¯ Production—MonoMac1 cells were seeded at 3 × 105 cells/ml and treated with morpholino 36 h prior to harvest. 10 hr prior to harvest, the cells were treated with solvent (control) or 20 ng/ml TNF-α. After washing with Hank's balanced-salt solution containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4 (HBSS), 2.5 × 105 cells were combined with 50 μl of Diogenes Complete Enhancer Solution (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA), 50 nm PMA (Sigma), and HBSS containing CaCl2 and MgCl2 to a total volume of 100 μl per well in polystyrene flat bottom 96-well, half-area microtiter plates (Corning, Corning, NY). The reactions were monitored for 3 h using a Fluoroskan Ascent FL microtiter plate reader (ThermoElectron Corp., Milford, MA) with a 1-min reading interval, and integrated chemiluminescence was determined over the full kinetic assay period using Ascent software. All assays were performed in triplicate. Statistical Analysis—Student's paired t-tests and one-way analysis of variance were performed on the indicated sets of data. Post-test analysis used Tukey's pair-wise comparisons (GraphPad Prism Software, San Diego, CA). Pair-wise comparisons with differences at p < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Identification of a TRR-binding Protein by Yeast One-hybrid Screening—Previously, we found by DNase footprint analysis that nuclear proteins bind the NCF2 TRR; however, no identifiable binding elements for known DNA-binding proteins were apparent in the TRR sequence (21Gauss K.A. Bunger P.L. Larson T.C. Young C.J. Nelson-Overton L.K. Siemsen D.W. Quinn M.T. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2005; 77: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To identify TRR-binding proteins, we utilized a yeast one-hybrid assay. The integrated bait sequence used for this assay was a trimer of the TRR sequence located -56 to -16 bp upstream of the start site in the NCF2 promoter (Fig. 1A). The TRR-trimer sequence was cloned into the yeast integration and reporter plasmids pHISi, pHIS-1, and pLacZi (supplemental Fig. S1, panel A), and recombinant plasmids were integrated into the genome of the competent yeast strain Y187, combining pLacZi with either pHISi or pHIS-1 in the same yeast clone creating double-reporter yeast strains. Additionally, the control integration and reporter vectors p53BLUE and p53HIS were linearized and independently integrated into the Y187 yeast genome. The difference in the levels of leaky background of the pHISi and pHIS-1 integration and reporter vectors was used to design yeast one-hybrid assays of relative stringency. Using titrated levels of 3-AT with the two reporter strains, pHISipLacZi(TRR) and pHIS-1pLacZi(TRR), bait strains of two different stringencies were obtained. The Y187 [pHIS-1pLacZi(TRR)] demonstrated high stringency with the leaky HIS3 expression sensitive to only 10 mm 3-AT, while the Y187 [pHISipLacZi(TRR)] strain was of lower stringency and required 45 mm 3-AT to completely inhibit the leaky background (supplemental Fig. S1, panel B). Additionally, all reporter strains were assayed for auto-activity (data not shown). The competent reporter strain AH109 was transformed with a human leukocyte cDNA library fused to the GAL4 activation domain and subsequently mated with the bait strains at a density of 4.5 × 106 cells per cm2. To confirm the mating strategy, the AH109 strain was transformed with the positive and negative control vectors pGAD53m and pGAD424, respectively, and diploids were screened for both nutritional and colorimetric gene activity (supplemental Fig. S1, panel C). The low stringency assay screened 1.7 × 107 library clones, while the high-stringency assay screened 4.6 × 107 library clones. Double-positive, diploid clones were selected on synthetic complete medium lacking histidine, uracil, and l"
https://openalex.org/W2154170041,"d-3-Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.95) from Escherichia coli contains two Gly-Gly sequences that have been shown previously to have the characteristics of hinge regions. One of these, Gly336-Gly337, is found in the loop between the substrate binding domain and the regulatory domain. Changing these glycine residues to valine affected the sensitivity of the enzyme to inhibition by l-serine but not the extent of inhibition. The decrease in sensitivity was caused primarily by a decrease in the affinity of the enzyme for l-serine. These mutations also affected the domain rotation of the subunits in response to l-serine binding. A major conclusion of this study was that it defines a minimal limit on the necessary conformational changes leading to inhibition of enzyme activity. That is, some of the conformational differences seen in the native enzyme upon l-serine binding are not critical for inhibition, whereas others are maintained and may play important roles in inhibition and cooperativity. The structure of G336V demonstrates that the minimal effect of l-serine binding leading to inhibition of enzyme activity requires a domain rotation of approximately only 6° in just two of the four subunits of the enzyme that are oriented diagonally across from each other in the tetramer. Moreover the structures show that both pairs of Asn190 to Asn190 hydrogen bonds across the subunit interfaces are necessary for activity. These observations are consistent with the half-the-sites activity, flip-flop mechanism proposed for this and other similar enzymes and suggest that the Asn190 hydrogen bonds may function in the conformational transition between alternate half-the-site active forms of the enzyme. d-3-Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.95) from Escherichia coli contains two Gly-Gly sequences that have been shown previously to have the characteristics of hinge regions.

EC 1.1.1.95) from Escherichia coli is a tetrameric enzyme that displays cooperative inhibition by l-serine, the end product of its metabolic pathway (1Sugimoto E. Pizer L.I. J. Biol.

The enzyme is a tetramer of identical subunits that contain three distinctive domains, the substrate binding domain, the nucleotide binding domain, and the regulatory or serine binding domain (6Schuller D. Grant G.A. Banaszak L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 7Thompson J.R. Bell J.K. Bratt J. Grant G.A. Banaszak L.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 5763-5773Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The serine binding domain found in E. coli PGDH represents the archetypical structure of the ACT domain, a small molecule binding domain involved in the regulation of a growing number of proteins (8Grant G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33825-33829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The recent production of heterogeneous hybrid tetramers of PGDH has demonstrated that the enzyme exhibits half-of-the-sites activity for both the active site and the effector site (9Grant G.A. Xu X.L. Hu Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13452-13460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Furthermore these studies were able to provide a quantitative analysis of the degree of inhibition that a specific effector site had on a specific active site. Binding of a single serine molecule at one regulatory site was sufficient to completely inhibit the active sites within the subunits to which it was bound as well as impart partial inhibition (∼ 33%) of active sites in subunits to which it was not directly bound. An earlier report (10Grant G.A. Xu X.L. Hu Z. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7316-7319Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a specific Gly-Gly sequence (Gly336-Gly337) located in a loop between the regulatory domain and the substrate binding domain of each subunit played a role in the regulation of catalytic activity by serine. It was suggested that this segment of polypeptide might act as a hinge point for the transmission of action between the effector and active sites. Adding bulk at position 336 by changing the glycine residue to a valine or leucine residue caused an approximate 15-fold increase in the I0.5 for l-serine. A similar effect was not seen for position 337, but when both positions 336 and 337 were modified, the I0.5 for serine increased ∼80-fold. Interestingly when position 336 was a valine residue, the increase in I0.5 could be completely reversed by placing a glycine residue at position 335. Moreover glycine residues at both positions 335 and 336 reduced the I0.5 by 3-fold over the native enzyme. Because the crystal structure of PGDH (6Schuller D. Grant G.A. Banaszak L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 7Thompson J.R. Bell J.K. Bratt J. Grant G.A. Banaszak L.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 5763-5773Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) shows that the loop containing Gly336 and Gly337 does not directly contact other areas of the protein, the introduction of a bulky side chain in this region suggested that hindering the ability of these residues to rotate freely has a significant effect on the ability of the effector to modulate the inhibition of the active site. This conclusion is further supported by the observation that introducing additional potential for free rotation about the polypeptide in the form of an additional Gly residue at position 335 increases the ability of serine to inhibit activity. As this hinge point lies between the regulatory and active sites within a subunit, how it functions in the regulation of activity is of considerable interest. Is its principal effect on the binding of serine to the effector site or is it on the transduction of the effect of l-serine binding to the active site? In this study, ligand binding analyses demonstrated that the characteristics of serine binding are significantly altered in the G336V and G336V,G337V mutant enzymes. Gel permeation chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation demonstrated that this is not due to changes in subunit aggregation. Modeling of the relationship of serine binding to inhibition of activity demonstrated that the inhibition characteristics of the mutant enzyme can be accounted for mainly by the change in ligand binding dynamics. In addition, the crystal structures of these mutant enzymes demonstrate that previously observed domain rotations are not required for inhibition of activity by serine to occur. PGDH was expressed in E. coli and purified using 5′-AMP-Sepharose affinity chromatography (11Al-Rabiee R. Lee E.J. Grant G.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1989; 264: 2645-2648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was determined by the change in absorbance at 340 nm due to the conversion of NADH to NAD+ at pH 7.5 (13Tobey K.L. Grant G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12179-12183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using α-ketoglutarate as the substrate (14Zhao G. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriology. 1996; 178: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). All PGDH constructs were based on PGDH 4CA where the four native cysteinyl residues are converted to alanyl residues (15Grant G.A. Xu X.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22389-22394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). PGDH 4CA was chosen to be consistent with previous studies and so that new cysteines can eventually be introduced for the incorporation of reporter groups. For simplicity, this construct will be assumed as the background in all subsequent descriptions and not be referred to specifically. Serine Binding Analysis—Serine binding was measured by equilibrium dialysis in 200-μl dialysis chambers (Sialomed, Inc., Columbia, MD) for 16 h with l-[3H]serine in appropriate concentrations of unlabeled l-serine. Cells were sampled in triplicate, and the averages of 10-min counts were used to calculate concentrations of free and bound l-serine. The nominal PGDH concentration was 5-10 μm tetramer, and all binding was performed in the presence of 100 μm NADH. Serine binding data were fit to the Adair equation for four sites (Equation 1) (16Bell J.E. Bell E.T. Proteins and Enzymes.

Gel Permeation Chromatography—Gel permeation chromatography was performed in a 2.6 × 90-cm column of Sephacryl S-300 HR operated at a flow rate of ∼0.35 ml/min in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA. The elution buffer for samples run in the presence of serine contained 0.2 mm l-serine. 2-min fractions were collected, and the absorbance was read at 280 nm. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium analyses were performed by Alliance Protein Laboratories (Camarillo, CA). Sedimentation equilibrium analysis was performed by loading samples of protein at concentrations of 2.33, 1.17, 0.777, 0.388, 0.194, 0.117, 0.0388, and 0.0194 mg/ml into three six-channel centerpieces and centrifugation at 8,000 rpm at 25 °C in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. Optical scans were recorded at wavelengths of 300, 280, or 230 nm after 16, 20, and 24 h. The rotor speed was then increased to 20,000 rpm for 12 h to clear the meniscus region, and a last scan was taken to measure the base-line offset for each sample. The resulting data were analyzed by non-linear least square techniques using the program KDALTON (19Philo J.S. Talvenheimo J. Wen J. Rosenfeld R. Welcher A.A. Arakawa T. J. Biol.

A solvent density of 1.00094 g/ml and a partial specific volume of 0.7455 ml/g at 25 °C were calculated using the program SEDNTERP (21Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E.

Sedimentation velocity analyses were performed by loading protein at 1.5 mg/ml into two-channel charcoal-Epon cells with 3-mm path length and at 0.375 mg/ml into a similar cell with 12-mm path length. Buffer was loaded into the reference channel of each cell, and the samples were loaded into a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. The rotor was brought to 3000 rpm, and the samples were scanned to confirm proper sample loading. The rotor speed was increased to 40,000 rpm for the duration of the run. Scans were taken approximately every 4 min for 4 h. The data were analyzed with the programs SEDFIT (22Schuck P. Biophys.

Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystallization conditions were broadly screened using Crystal screen, Crystal screen II, and PEG/Ion screen from Hampton Research and Wizard I and II from Emerald Biosystems. All crystallization trials contained 5 mm NADH. Approximately 1000 crystallization trials were completed for each mutant and complex. Crystals were obtained for the serine-free G336V mutant protein, the G336V mutant with 5 mm serine, and the G336V,G337V mutant with 5 mm serine. The serine-free G336V mutant was crystallized in 1.5 m ammonium sulfate and 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.5 (Wizard I 8, Emerald Biosystems). There were two different crystal forms of the serine-bound G336V mutant. Form A was crystallized in 20% PEG 1000, 0.1 m sodium/potassium phosphate (pH 6.2), 0.2 m NaCl (Wizard II 14), and form B was crystallized in 10% PEG 3000, 0.1 m cacodylate, pH 6.5, 0.2 m MgCl2 (Wizard II 27). The serine-bound double mutant G336V,G337V was crystallized in 30% PEG 400, 0.1 m acetate, pH 4.5, 0.2 m calcium acetate (Wizard I 44). The data sets for the G336V PGDH crystal and form A crystal of G336V + serine were collected at 19ID and 23ID beamlines, respectively (Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, Chicago, IL). Data sets for form B of serine-bound G336V and G336V,G337V were collected in house using a Rigaku Raxis IV ++ detector. All of the crystallizations were performed by the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique at 18 °C. Data Processing and Structure Determination—The data set for the G336V + serine form A crystal was processed and scaled using HKL2000 (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter C. Sweet R. Methods in Enzymology. 276. Academic Press, New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar). The crystal was in space group P6222 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit, having a high solvent content of 80%. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using PHASER (26Storoni L.C. McCoy A.J. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar) with the chain B of serine-bound native enzyme as the ensemble (Protein Data Bank code 1PSD) with an LLG of 3521 (Z-score of 16.42 and 59.12 for the rotation and translation function, respectively). The serine-free mutant structure was also processed and scaled using HKL2000, and the structure was determined using PHASER with the form A mutant structure as the model (LLG = 1452); the space group was P43 with four molecules in the asymmetric unit. The data set for form B of the serine-bound G336V mutant and the serine-bound G336V,G337V mutant were both indexed using LABELIT (27Sauter N.K. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2004; 37: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and further processed and scaled using mosflm (28Leslie A.G.W. Jt. CCP4/ESF-EAMCB Newslett. Protein Crystallogr. 1992; 26Google Scholar) and SCALA (29Evans P.R. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S. Proceedings of CCP4 Study Weekend. Data Collection and Processing. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1993: 114-122Google Scholar), respectively. The space group was P21212 for both the crystals with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The structure of form B was determined using molecular replacement with the form A mutant structure as the model with an LLG of 2645. The inhibited double mutant structure was solved using Protein Data Bank code 1PSD as the model with an LLG of 4786. The geometry of these structures was largely improved using simulated annealing refinement in CNS (Crystallography and NMR System) during the early stages of model building (30Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The quality of the models was assessed using PROCHECK (35Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). No side chains are in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. The overall statistics are provided in Table 1. The domain movements were analyzed manually as well as using the program DynDom (36Hayward S. Berendsen H.J.C.

Open table in a new tab Previous kinetics analyses of E. coli PGDH (10Grant G.A. Xu X.L. Hu Z. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7316-7319Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) showed that of the two amino acid residues Gly336 and Gly337, mutations of Gly336 had a greater effect on the serine sensitivity of the enzyme and that the double mutation had a more than additive effect. Therefore, the l-serine binding characteristics of these two mutant proteins were investigated in more detail, and their crystal structures were determined in the presence and absence of l-serine (crystals were obtained only in the presence of l-serine for the double mutant protein). Serine Binding and Inhibition—The results of l-serine binding analysis of G336V is shown in Fig. 1. The serine binding and inhibition profiles for G336V are compared with those for the native enzyme in Fig. 2. Although serine inhibition could be demonstrated kinetically for the G336V,G337V double mutant, the binding affinity of serine was too low to measure by equilibrium dialysis. Fitting of the data to the Adair equation for four sites yielded the intrinsic dissociation constants presented in Table 2. However, the fitting of four variables simultaneously produced relatively large errors for these values. Therefore, the data were also analyzed with a Hill plot (shown in Fig. 1B). The Hill plot allowed a graphical determination of the first dissociation constant that was used to constrain the fit of the Adair equation. When this was done, the errors for the determination of the other three dissociation constants were significantly reduced. These data indicate that mutation of these two glycyl residues to valyl residues produced a substantial increase in the cooperativity of effector binding in the G336V mutant. This increase in cooperativity manifested itself principally by a large increase in the dissociation constant for binding of the first effector molecule but also had an effect on subsequent dissociation constants.FIGURE 2Comparison of G336V PGDH with native PGDH. Left, comparison of l-serine binding to native PGDH (▪) and G336V PGDH (•). The data are plotted as in Fig. 1.

Open table in a new tab Quaternary Structure—The increase in cooperativity seen with these mutations could be caused by conformational constraints introduced into the PGDH tetramer, or they could be caused by an alteration in the subunit aggregation. The association state of the proteins was assessed with gel permeation chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation. Both the native and mutant proteins eluted with essentially the same volume in the presence and absence of serine (not shown) indicating that the oligomeric state of the mutant proteins was unchanged relative to the native protein even in the presence of l-serine. Sedimentation velocity analysis of G336V yielded a sedimentation coefficient of 7.65 S that was unchanged in the presence of l-serine. This agrees very well with a sedimentation coefficient of 7.68 S determined from hydrodynamic bead modeling from the x-ray crystal structure of the native enzyme and the value of 7.85 determined previously for the native enzyme (37Rosenbloom J. Sugimoto E. Pizer L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2099-2107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A fit of the data to the program SVEDBERG also yielded a diffusion coefficient of 4.56. The S/D ratio implies a molecular mass of ∼161 kDa, confirming the assignment of this species as a tetramer. Sedimentation equilibrium data were also consistent with a tetramer of 150-160 kDa. Binding-Inhibition Linkage—Previous studies (9Grant G.A. Xu X.L. Hu Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13452-13460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) have shown that the relationship between effector binding and inhibition of activity in PGDH can be represented by the relationship i=1.33P1+0.67P2+P3+P4(Eq. 3) where Pi represents the population of enzyme species with i bound ligands. Because inhibition is dependent only on the binding of the first two ligands, the dissociation constants for the formation of P3 and P4 are relevant only in so far as they reflect the population of species with ligand bound at the first two sites. Therefore, for the purpose of modeling the linkage between binding and inhibition, the dissociation constants for the last two ligands are set equal to that of the second ligand. Fig. 3 shows that the inhibition profile can be modeled very accurately by Equation 3 using dissociation constants derived from the ligand binding analysis of G336V PGDH. Mutant Enzyme Structure—The crystal structure of the G336V mutant enzyme was determined to 2.6-Å resolution. It crystallizes in the same space group as the native enzyme (P43); both contain four molecules in the asymmetric unit, which also corresponds to the biological unit. The overall conformation of the enzyme is similar to the native enzyme. The two structures overlay with an r.m.s.d. of 0.33 Å for Cα atoms. This structure has citrate, phosphates/sulfates, and cofactor NADH bound at the active site, but the density for citrate is visible only in the active sites of subunits B and C. In subunits A and D, the active sites are occupied by phosphate ions and water molecules. The citrate molecule seems to form hydrogen bonds with Arg60 and Lys141′ (′ indicates a residue from the adjacent subunit). In subunits B and C, although citrate occupies a position similar to that of the natural substrate at the active site, it is still significantly distant from the catalytic dyad His292-Glu269 as well as the NADH. Arg240, which usually forms hydrogen bonds with the carboxylate group of the substrate, is facing away from the citrate. In all four subunits of the tetramer, Arg60 is also interacting with a phosphate ion present at the active site. There are also additional electron densities found away from the active site that are consistent with citrate molecules that are present in the crystallization buffer. A major difference between G336V and native PGDH is evident at the point of mutation where significant alterations in the φ and ψ angles of residues His335-Gly337 are observed along with the transition of residue 336 in the range of 1.8-2.6 Å in all four chains. No significant change is seen at the serine binding sites themselves between G336V and native PGDH. These observations suggest that the altered structure observed at the site of mutation is principally responsible for the altered serine binding behavior, although they are quite distant from the serine binding site itself. In the native enzyme, Asn190 of the nucleotide binding domain (NBD) appears to make hydrogen bond contact with its counterpart in the diagonally opposite subunit through a water molecule in subunits A and C and directly in subunits B and D.

https://openalex.org/W2023388639,"Model peptides composed of alanine and leucine residues are often used to mimic single helical transmembrane domains. Many studies have been carried out to determine how they interact with membranes. However, few studies have investigated their lipid-destabilizing effect. We designed three peptides designated KALRs containing a hydrophobic stretch of 14, 18, or 22 alanines/leucines surrounded by charged amino acids. Molecular modeling simulations in an implicit membrane model as well as attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared analyses show that KALR is a good model of a transmembrane helix. However, tryptophan fluorescence and attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicate that the extent of binding and insertion into lipids increases with the length of the peptide hydrophobic core. Although binding can be directly correlated to peptide hydrophobicity, we show that insertion of peptides into a membrane is determined by the length of the peptide hydrophobic core. Functional studies were performed by measuring the ability of peptides to induce lipid mixing and leakage of liposomes. The data reveal that whereas KALR14 does not destabilize liposomal membranes, KALR18 and KALR22 induce 40 and 50% of lipid-mixing, and 65 and 80% of leakage, respectively. These results indicate that a transmembrane model peptide can induce liposome fusion in vitro if it is long enough. The reasons for the link between length and fusogenicity are discussed in relation to studies of transmembrane domains of viral fusion proteins. We propose that fusogenicity depends not only on peptide insertion but also on the ability of peptides to destabilize the two leaflets of the liposome membrane.

Biological membranes are a complex mixture of lipids that contain proteins, hydrocarbons, and other constituents (1Hauser H. Poupart G. Yeagle P.L. The Structure of Biological Membranes. 2nd Ed. CRC Press LLC, Boca Raton, FL2005Google Scholar). In addition, expression, folding, and insolubility problems can make the study of protein-membrane interactions very complicated and limit the results of interpretation (2Eiler S. Gangloff M.

Liu L.P. Wang C. Goto N.K. Reithmeier R.A.F. Curr. Top. Membr. 2002; 52: 465-479Crossref Google Scholar).

Killian J.A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2003; 20: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 22Percot A. Zhu X.X. Lafleur M. Biopolymers. 1999; 50: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was shown that natural transmembrane α-helices domains are often flanked by lysine and arginine residues (31Reithmeier R.A.F. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Struct. 1994; 23: 167-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar).When the length of the hydrophobic stretch of a helical peptide fits the thickness of the membrane hydrophobic core, the peptide inserts into the membrane and adopts a TM orientation (26Strandberg E. Ozdirekcan S. Rijkers D.T.S. van der Wel P.C.A. Koeppe R.E. Liskamp R.M.J. Killian J.A. Biophys.

When it does not fit, either polar residues are exposed to the apolar medium, or hydrophobic residues are accessible to the water phase. This unfavorable phenomenon has been called hydrophobic mismatch (6Weiss T.M. van der Wel P.C.A. Killian J.A. Koeppe R.E. Huang H.W. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10213-10220Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Positive and negative hydrophobic mismatches occur when the hydrophobic stretch of a peptide is too long or too short with respect to the membrane thickness, respectively (16de Planque M.R.R. Killian J.A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2003; 20: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The peptide can adapt its structure or its orientation to overcome mismatch (23Harzer U. Bechinger B.

Mol. Membr. Biol. 2003; 20: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). If the mismatch is too great, insertion of the peptide into the membrane is reduced (16de Planque M.R.R. Killian J.A.

It has been shown that membrane adaptation can also result as a response to a hydrophobic mismatch. 2H NMR measurements with lipids containing a perdeuterated acyl chain, x-ray diffraction, and differential scanning calorimetry measurements revealed that a positive mismatch increases the lipid chain order, whereas a negative mismatch increases membrane disorder (38Zhang Y.P.

However, other studies using 15N as well as 31P NMR, differential scanning calorimetry, and ESR showed that peptides long enough or too long to span the membrane perturb the membrane order whereas peptides that are too short have less effect (23Harzer U. Bechinger B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13106-13114Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 24Lewis R.N.A.H. Zhang Y.P. Liu F. McElhaney R.N. Bioelectrochemistry. 2002; 56: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).Few studies have focused on the ability of TM model peptides to induce membrane fusion. Hofmann et al. (42Hofmann M.W. Weise K. Ollesch J. Agrawal P. Stalz H. Stelzer W. Hulsbergen F. de Groot H. Gerwert K. Reed J. Langosch D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14776-14781Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) showed that the fusogenicity of TM model peptides varies with the ratio of helix-promoting leucine and sheet-promoting valine residues and is enhanced if helix-destabilizing residues, such as glycine and proline, are present within their hydrophobic core. They further showed that fusogenicity of these peptides correlates with structural flexibility (42Hofmann M.W. Weise K. Ollesch J. Agrawal P. Stalz H. Stelzer W. Hulsbergen F. de Groot H. Gerwert K. Reed J. Langosch D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14776-14781Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The more flexible the peptide is, the more fusion is induced.In this study, we analyzed the interaction of de novo TM peptides with membranes and in particular their ability to induce fusion. We designed three TM model peptides; all have a hydrophobic core made of alanines and leucines (14, 18, and 22 residues), and both the N and C termini were extended with three positively charged residues. Interactions and fusogenic properties of each KALR with a membrane were studied by modeling and experimental approaches.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-racemic-(1-glycerol) sodium salt (DOPG), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE), cholesterol (CHOL), and bovine brain sphingomyelin (SM) were purchased from Sigma. Trifluoroethanol (TFE), Hepes, Triton X-100, and Me2SO were purchased from Sigma. Octadecylrhodamine chloride B, N,N′-p-xylenebis(pyridinium bromide) (DPX), and 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid (HPTS) came from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). NaCl came from Merck Eurolab (Leuven, Belgium). Peptides KALR14, KALR18, and KALR22 were synthesized by NeoMPS (Strasbourg, France). These peptides have free N and C termini (Table 1). Their purity is higher than 85%.TABLE 1Sequence of KALR peptidesPeptideSequenceKALR14KKKAALAAALWAALAAARRRKALR18KKKAALAAALAAWLAAALAAARRRKALR22KKKAALAAALAAALWAALAAALAAARRR Open table in a new tab Liposome Preparation—DOPC, DOPG, DOPE, SM, and CHOL were dissolved in a chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) solution. DOPC/CHOL/DOPE/DOPG/SM (34:33:16:10:7 mol/mol/mol/mol/mol) film was obtained after evaporation under vacuum with a rotary evaporator (Rotovapor R-3000, Van Der Heyden Büchi, Switzerland). The lipid film, dried for one night, was then dispersed in 2 ml of 5 mm HEPES and 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, buffer and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C.To obtain DOPC/CHOL/DOPE/DOPG/SM (34:33:16:10:7, mol/mol/mol/mol/mol) large unilamellar vesicles (LUV), the hydrated lipid dispersion was exposed to five freeze-thaw cycles and passed 10 times through a polycarbonate membrane (0.1 μm) under 20 bars pressure with an extruder (Lipex Biomembranes, Vancouver, Canada). To obtain DOPC/CHOL/DOPE/DOPG/SM (34/33/16/10/7 mol/mol/mol/mol/mol) small unilamellar vesicles (SUV), the hydrated film was sonicated (high intensity ultrasonic processor; Sigma) for 5 min at 50 W. A 10,000 × g centrifugation for 2 min (Biofuge Pico, Van der Heyden, Heraeus, Germany) discarded titanium deposit and residual multilamellar vesicles. The phospholipid concentration was determined by phosphorus analysis (43Mrsny R.J. Volwerk J.J. Griffith O.H. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1986; 39: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).Lipid-binding Experiments—In a polar environment, the tryptophan present in KALRs has a fluorescence spectrum with a maximum around 350 nm. Upon the addition of SUVs, the fluorescence maximum shifts to the blue, around 335 nm. The affinity of the peptide for the SUV was determined by adding increasing amounts of vesicles to 0.67 mm peptides dissolved in Me2SO, as previously described (44Schwarz G. Stankowski S. Rizzo V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 861: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 45Rizzo V. Stankowski S. Schwarz G.

Fluorescence was recorded at room temperature (λexc, 280 nm; λem, 335 nm) after each addition on an LS-50B PerkinElmer Life Sciences fluorimeter. The fluorescence values were then corrected by taking into account the dilution factor corresponding to the addition of the liposomes and by subtracting the corresponding blank (Me2SO with the same amount of SUVs). The ratio (R) of bound to total peptides and the dissociation constant (Kd) were calculated as described by Lear and DeGrado (46Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6500-6505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments were carried out in a buffer composed of 5 mm HEPES and 100 mm NaCl at pH 7.4.Lipid Mixing Experiments—Mixing of liposome membranes was followed by measuring the fluorescence increase of octadecylrhodamine chloride B, a lipid soluble probe, after the fusion of labeled and unlabeled liposomes. Labeled liposomes were obtained by incorporating octadecylrhodamine chloride B in the dry lipid film at a 5% concentration of the total lipid weight. Labeled and unlabeled liposomes were mixed at a weight ratio of 1:4, respectively, and at a final concentration of 12.5 μm in 5 mm HEPES and 100 mm of NaCl buffer at pH 7.4. 100% of fusion was determined by adding Triton X-100 at 2% to labeled/unlabeled (1:4) LUVs. Fluorescence was recorded at room temperature (λexc, 560 nm; λem, 590 nm) on an LS-50B PerkinElmer Life Sciences fluorimeter. The tests were performed with LUVs and were repeated three times with different batches of peptide.Leakage of Liposome Vesicle Contents—Vesicle leakage was monitored using an assay based on the quenching of HPTS by DPX (47Van Bambeke F. Kerkhofs A. Schanck A. Remacle C. Sonveaux E. Tulkens P.M. Mingeot-Leclerq M.P. Lipids. 2000; 35: 213-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HPTS and DPX are both encapsulated in the aqueous phase of the same liposomes. Leakage of vesicles was followed by measuring the dequenching of HPTS released into the medium. Fluorescence was recorded at room temperature (λexc, 450 nm; λem, 512 nm) on an LS-50B PerkinElmer fluorimeter. Liposomes (LUVs) were prepared as described above in 12.5 mm HPTS (45 mm NaCl), 45 mm DPX (20 mm NaCl), and 10 mm HEPES buffer at pH 7.4. Vesicles containing encapsulated HPTS and DPX were eluted in the void volume of a Sephadex G-75 column, with 5 mm HEPES and 100 mm NaCl buffer (pH 7.4). Assays were repeated three times with different batches of peptide.Electron Microscopy—The effect of the peptides on SUV was examined by negative transmission staining electron microscopy. Prior to staining and fixing, suspensions of SUV at 4.5 mm (with or without lyophilized peptide) were incubated for 5 min at room temperature. A drop containing SUV alone or with a peptide was deposited onto a carbon-coated grid and negatively stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid (pH 6.8). The grids were observed by using a JEOL JEM 100B electron microscope (Japan Electron Optics Laboratory Co., Tokyo, Japan).IR Spectroscopy Measurements—Spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Brüker Equinox 55 equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled mercury-cadmium-telluride detector at a resolution of 2 cm-1 by averaging 512 scans. Reference spectra of the germanium plate were automatically recorded after purging for 15 min with dry air and subtracted from the recently run sample spectrum. The plate was sealed in a universal sample holder and rehydrated by flushing the holder with N2 saturated with D2O for 3 h at room temperature. Free peptide samples (50 μg of peptide in TFE) and the lipid-bound peptides were spread out on a germanium ATR plate (50 × 20 × 2 mm; Aldrich Chimica) with an aperture of 45°, yielding 25 internal reflections. The lipid-membrane sample was prepared by incubation of 1 ml of peptides at 60 μm with 6 ml of CHOL/DOPC/DOPE/DOPG (40/34/16/10, mol/mol/mol/mol/mol) SUV at 500 μm (1:50 peptide/lipid (mol/mol) ratio) in 5 mm HEPES and 100 mm NaCl buffer at pH 7.4 for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation, the lipid/peptide mixture was filtered through an anisotropic hydrophilic YM 30 membrane (cut-off 30 kDa) of a Centrifree micropartition system (Amicon) with a 13,000 × g centrifugation for 45 min to separate lipid-associated from free peptides. Distilled water was used to recuperate the retained sample containing the peptide-lipid complex. To determine the peptide insertion rate in membranes by infrared spectra, the area of the amide I peak was divided by the area of the lipid C=O peak and the number of amide groups in the peptide, as previously shown (35de Planque M.R.R. Goormaghtigh E. Greathouse D.V. Koeppe R.E. Kruijtzer J.A.W. Liskamp R.M.J. de Kruijff B. Killian J.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5000-5010Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar).To evaluate the orientation of peptides in lipids, spectra were recorded at two orthogonal linear polarizations (90 and 0°) of the incident light. The dichroic spectrum was obtained by subtracting the spectrum recorded with polarized light at 0° from that at 90°. The angle between the germanium crystal and the dipole was calculated from the dichroic ratio RATR/RATR = A(90°)/A(0°), where A(90°) is the absorbance of the selected dipole from a spectrum recorded with polarized light at 90°, and A(0°) is the absorbance of the same dipole from a 0° polarized spectrum. The bands chosen to characterize the protein and phospholipid orientation are the amide I and the lipid νs (CH2), respectively (48Goormaghtigh E. Raussens V. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1422: 105-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 49Castano S. Desbat B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1715: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Design of KALRs—Three peptides with a hydrophobic core of 14, 18, and 22 residues were designed (Table 1). The hydrophobic core is an AA(LAAA)n motif with n = 3, 4, and 5 for KALR14, KALR18, and KALR22, respectively. The hydrophobic core lengths were chosen to have variations of approximately one helix turn, corresponding to 6 Å (50Creighton T.E. Proteins: Structures and Molecular Properties. 2nd ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992: 182-186Google Scholar). Each peptide is surrounded by three lysine residues at the N-terminal extremity and three arginine residues at the C-terminal extremity. At the center of the sequence of each peptide, a tryptophan residue replaces an alanine residue in order to have a fluorescent sensor.Analysis by Molecular Modeling—The integral membrane protein and lipid association (IMPALA) method was used to analyze interaction of KALRs with membranes (51Ducarme P. Rahman M. Brasseur R. Proteins. 1998; 30: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The thickness of the implicit bilayer was extrapolated from experimental data on DOPC bilayers (16de Planque M.R.R. Killian J.A. Mol. Membr.

The thickness of the model membrane was 40 Å with a hydrophobic core of 31 Å to mimic membranes used in the experimental assays.The IMPALA method simulates the insertion of peptides into the bilayer by adding energy restraint functions to the usual energy function of peptides. The lipid bilayer is defined by C(z), which represents an empirical function describing membrane properties as follows, C(Z)=1-11+eα(z-z0)(Eq. 1) where z is perpendicular to the membrane and has its origin at the center of the bilayer. The values α and z0 are parameters fixed in such a way that C(|z ≥ 20 Å|) = 1 and C(|z ≤ 15.5 Å|) = 0. The value of the function is constant from - ∞ to -20 Å (hydrophilic phase), from -15.5 to 15.5 Å (hydrophobic core), and from 20 Å to ∞ (hydrophilic phase).Two restraints simulate the interaction between the peptide and the bilayer. The first one accounts for the effect that pushes hydrophobic atoms into the membrane (hydrophobic restraint) and hydrophilic atoms outside of it as follows, Epho=-∑i=1Ns(i)Etr(i)C(zi)(Eq. 2) where N is the total number of atoms, S(i) is the solvent-accessible surface of atom i, Etr(i) is its transfer energy in units of accessible surface area, and C(zi) is the value of C(z) at the position zi of a"

As recently reported, our evolutional design method, namely, “quasi-additive adaptive walking with mutant data base” (QAW), 2The abbreviations used are: QAW method, quasi-additive adaptive walking method with mutant database; PHBH, p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase. provides a systematic and comprehensive combinatorial scheme for obtaining an improved protein with a single desired property (1Iwakura M.

Because the previous work focused on a single property (enzyme activity), whether or not our QAW method could be extended to improve simultaneously multiple properties of any enzyme should be examined for generalization and availability as to industrial uses of our method. In a test study, we used p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (PHBH) as a target enzyme and all Cys and Met residues as mutation sites, similar to the previous study (1Iwakura M. Maki K. Takahashi H.

Among the 20 naturally occurring amino acids, only Cys and Met residues contain a sulfur atom in their side chains. Because of the high reactivity of sulfur in sulfhydryl and thiomethyl groups, proteins are easily oxidized and show molecular heterogeneity because of the formation of inter- and intra-molecular disulfide linkages, and changes in isoelectric points caused by the formation of methionine sulfoxide. Therefore, sulfur-free or reduced proteins should be resistant to oxidative damage and could be used in highly oxidizing environments such as those found in pollution treatment facilities. PHBH, which is a FAD-containing monooxygenase, catalyzes the hydroxylation of p-hydroxybenzoate to protocatechuate (main activity) (Fig. 1A) (2Entsch B. van Berkel W.J.

The crystal structure and function of PHBH have provided information on the biological evolution of PHBH-like structure and flavin-containing aromatic compound oxygenases (36Schreuder H.A. van der Laan J.M.

Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1712-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). PHBH has also been a subject of dissection and reconstruction for the development of general catalysts with oxygen and electronic transfer. From a clinical viewpoint, various assay methods for serum cholinesterase activity for the diagnosis of a liver function have been proposed. One popular method includes determination of p-hydroxybenzoate, the reaction product of cholinesterase, using PHBH (40Ashihara Y. Kasahara Y. Sugiyama M. Harada T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 94: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, the sub-activity of the enzyme reduces the accuracy of the method. Thus, raising of the reaction specificity by simultaneously raising the main activity and reducing the sub-activity are desired as well as protein stability, as usually desired for protein engineering. Here we report an attempt at simultaneous improvement of these properties of PHBH from Pseudomonas fluorescens NBRC 14160 by means of combinatorial searches starting from a Cys and Met single mutant pool. A number of improved mutants were effectively obtained after seven combinatorial searches, four with one selection parameter, two with two selection parameters, and one with four selection parameters. In addition, comparison of various combinatorial conditions was carried out. Materials—The PCR, DNA extraction, DNA purification, DNA sequencing, and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid protein purification kits were purchased from Qiagen; the protein extraction kit was from Novagen; and S-Gal/LB Agar Blend was purchased from Sigma. Sodium p-hydroxybenzoate was from Fluka, and other aromatic carboxylic acid compounds were from Wako Pure Chemical Industries. The following PCR primers were obtained from Jbios. Overexpression—To isolate the gene encoding PHBH (pobA), chromosomal DNA from P. fluorescens NBRC 14160 (DDBJ/DAD accession numberBAB20910) was used as the template (20Suemori A. Ozawa M. Iwakura M. Biotechnol. Lett. 2001; 23: 489-495Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). To generate a 1297-bp fragment containing the respective pobA sequence with an EcoT22I-restriction site at the N terminus and a His6 tag and EcoRI restriction site at the C terminus, primers SD/EcoT22I/pobA-N and pobA/H6/EcoRI-C were used. A 1238-bp fragment was amplified by PCR with 35 cycles of melting at 94 °C for 60 s, annealing at 55 °C for 60 s, and comprising extension at 72 °C for 90 s. The amplified DNA fragment was purified and then used as the template for the following PCR. To obtain a 1278-bp fragment containing the P35 and SD regions upstream of pobA, primers P35/SD/EcoT22I-N and pobA/H6/EcoRI-C were used. PCR and purification of the resulting fragment were performed as described above. To generate a 1307-bp fragment containing a PstI restriction site upstream of the P35 region, PCR was carried out with the 1278-bp fragment as the template and primers PstI/P35-N and pobA/H6/EcoRI-C. The 1307-bp fragment was purified, digested with restriction enzymes (PstI and EcoRI), and then repurified. The digested fragment was ligated into similarly digested pUC19, transformed into Escherichia coli JM109 cells by means of heat shock, and then plated on LB agar plates containing ampicillin and p-hydroxybenzoate. Transformants exhibiting the formation of a violet color because of the production of protocatechuate were isolated as single colonies. DNA was isolated from the resulting transformants and sequenced using a Big Dye sequencing kit. The plasmid containing pobA with the three restriction sites (PstI, EcoT22I, and EcoRI), two regions (P35 and SD), and His6 tag was designated as pPHBH. Mutant Libraries—To create libraries of single mutants as to various Cys and Met positions, the pPHBH plasmid was used as a PCR template. To produce a fragment of C152X-A, two primers (PstI/P35-N and C152X-C) were used, and to produce a fragment of C152X-B, two other primers (C152X-N and pobA/H6/EcoRI-C) were used. Amplified DNA fragments C152X-A and C152X-B were purified and used as templates for a primerless PCR. After 10 cycles of the same condition, two primers (P35/SD/EcoT22I-N and pobA/H6/EcoRI-C) were added for an additional 35 cycles to enhance amplification under the complete 1238-bp fragment. The 1238-bp fragment containing C152X mutations was purified and digested with restriction enzymes (EcoT22I and EcoRI). For functional screening, the digested fragment was ligated into a vector (pPHBH digested at EcoT22I and EcoRI sites). Transformation, overexpression, plasmid extraction, and identification of C152X mutations were carried out as described above. To obtain libraries of double variants, for example, M98V/M110S, the M98V single mutant, as a template, two primers (P35/SD/EcoT22I-N and M110S-C) for M98V/M110S-A, and two primers (M110S-N and pobA/H6/EcoRI-C) for M98V/M110S-B, respectively, were used to generate M98V/M110S. Characterization of Enzymes—E. coli JM109 cells were transformed with the plasmid containing mutations in pobA, and a single colony was used to inoculate 200 ml of LB medium containing ampicillin. After overnight incubation, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellet was lysed with phosphate buffer. The cell-free supernatant was purified using His6 tag and a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid protein purification kit (20Suemori A. Ozawa M. Iwakura M. Biotechnol. Lett. 2001; 23: 489-495Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). PHBH activity was monitored by following the rate of p-hydroxybenzoate-dependent oxidation of NADPH at 340 nm at 25 °C using as the assay mixture the following: 100 mm HEPES/NaOH buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.2 mm sodium p-hydroxybenzoate (or an other aromatic compound), 0.2 mm NADPH, 2 μm FAD, and a suitable amount of enzyme solution in a total volume of 2 ml (20Suemori A. Ozawa M. Iwakura M. Biotechnol. Lett. 2001; 23: 489-495Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Thermal stability was calculated by measuring the remaining activity after the purified enzyme in 100 mm HEPES/NaOH buffer (pH 8.0) was left standing at 50 °C for 30 min and then cooled. A Strategy for a Combinatorial Method—In an attempt at simultaneous improvement of enzymatic properties using the QAW concept, a comprehensive combination with a mutant data base (1Iwakura M. Maki K. Takahashi H. Takenawa T. Yokota A. Katayanagi K. Kamiyama T. Gekko K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13234-13246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we devised a strategy of combinatorial mutations starting from available single mutations. The combinatorial method for generating mutants used in this study does not use the combination of only the single best mutant at various positions. Rather, our method has the following key features: (i) mutants (if possible, three or more) are selected from a single and multiple mutant data base using various selection parameters; (ii) all combinations of the selected mutants are generated to construct a secondary mutant data base; and (iii) iterative selection, combination, and construction of subsequent mutant data bases are carried out until multiple mutants with the desired properties are obtained. Such combinatorial mutations as to various residues using multiple selection parameters can be referred to as multidimensional or matrix combination. It is also notable that the quadruple mutants were not obtained by chance from a random mutant library. It should be possible to reproducibly reconstruct any of the variants with improved properties, because all of the combinations were carried out based on the single and multiple mutant data bases. Construction of a Single Mutant Data Base—The 397-amino acid sequence of PHBH from P. fluorescens NBRC 14160 contains the following four Cys and eight Met residues in addition to a Met residue at the N terminus: Cys-152, Cys-158, Cys-211, and Cys-332 and Met-52, Met-65, Met-98, Met-110, Met-213, Met-276, Met-34, and Met-349 (Fig. 2) (20Suemori A. Ozawa M. Iwakura M. Biotechnol. Lett. 2001; 23: 489-495Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Substitution of each Cys and Met as target positions with one of the other 18 naturally occurring amino acids resulted in 216 active and stable single mutants. These single mutants were examined as to three properties as follows: hydroxylase activity toward p-hydroxybenzoate (main activity; units/mg), protocatechuate-dependent NADPH oxidase activity (sub-activity; units/mg), and thermal stability (%). Subsequently, the ratio of sub-activity to main activity (reaction specificity; %) was calculated based on the main activity and sub-activity. Using these four properties, a data base of single mutants as to Cys and Met sites was constructed (supplemental Table 1). Fig. 3 shows the distribution of the 216 single mutants with each of the four properties. As shown in Fig. 3 (A-D), there was a tendency that the substitution of Cys and Met residues with aliphatic amino acids caused the main activity and sub-activity values of the single variants to increase; however, their replacement with charged ones caused them to decrease. As shown in Fig. 3 (E-H), the mean and standard variation (shown in parentheses) values for the main activity, sub-activity, reaction specificity, and thermal stability for the 216 single mutants were similar to the wild type values: 14.7 (2.3) units/mg, 0.734 (0.126) units/mg, 5.0% (0.7%), and 31% (7%), respectively. In particular, only 28% of the single mutants exhibited reaction specificity values lower than that of the wild type, indicating that the distortion values of distribution for reaction specificity were rather high. A detailed study of the single mutants revealed a loose relationship between the main activity and sub-activity with a correlation coefficient of 0.648 (see supplemental Fig. 7 (A1)). As compared with the wild type, 50% of the 216 single mutants exhibited both lower main activity and lower sub-activity, 22% both higher main activity and higher sub-activity, 23% lower main activity and higher sub-activity, and only 5% higher main activity and lower sub-activity. This tendency suggested the difficulty of simultaneous alterations with increasing main activity and decreasing sub-activity. Combination Using One Selection Parameter—Combination of single mutants was carried out using only one selection parameter, main activity. First, eight single mutants with the highest main activity (M98V, M110S, M346G, M346A, M346I, M346E, M349A, and M349P) were selected from among the single mutants (Fig. 4a). All possible combinations of the selected eight single mutants were performed, resulting in 11 active and stable double variants (Fig. 4b). Next, four double variants with the highest main activity were selected and comprehensively combined. This combination provided three active and stable triple variants (Fig. 4c). Because all of the substituted positions in the triple variants (M98V/M110S/M346G, M98V/M10S/M346E, and M98V/M110S/M346A) were the same, no further combination was possible. The maximal main activity values for the selected single mutants and double and triple variants were 21.3 units/mg (M346G), 21.5 units/mg (M110S/M346G), and 22.6 units/mg (M98V/M110S/M346G), respectively. In addition, all of the triple variants exhibited not only higher main activity but also higher thermal stability than the wild type (Fig. 4c). On the other hand, the reaction specificity values of the multiple mutants were not significantly different from that of the wild type. A combinatorial experiment using only one selection parameter (sub-activity, reaction specificity, or thermal stability) was performed (data not shown). The experimental results indicated the same tendency, i.e. only the property used as the selection parameter was improved. Combination Using Two Selection Parameters—From the results of combination using one selection parameter, it was hypothesized that the combination of mutations causing both higher main activity and higher thermal stability should allow simultaneous and efficient improvement of two properties (main activity and thermal stability). Based on such a hypothesis, first, 27 single mutants were selected that showed both higher main activity and higher thermal stability as compared with the wild type. Next, from among the selected 27 single mutants, 4 single mutants with the highest main activity (M110S, M346G, M346E, and M349A) and 4 single mutants with the highest thermal stability (M52V, M98L, M213G and M276Q) were selected, respectively (Fig. 4d). Comprehensive combination of these selected 8 single mutations generated 15 active and stable double variants (Fig. 4e). From these double variants, the two with the highest main activity and the two with the highest thermal stability were selected, respectively. The selected four double variants were comprehensively combined, resulting in five active and stable triple and two quadruple variants (Fig. 4, f and g). Because all replacement positions in the two quadruple variants (M98L/M110S/M276Q/M346G and M98L/M110S/M276Q/M346E) were the same, no further combinations were possible. The maximal main activity and thermal stability values for the selected single mutants and the double, triple, and quadruple variants were 21.3 units/mg and 43% (M346G), 21.5 units/mg and 47% (M110S/M346G), and 23.5 units/mg and 51% (M98L/M110S/M276Q/M346G), respectively. In contrast, neither sub-activity nor reaction specificity was reduced, implying that only the two properties used as selection parameters were improved. Alternatively, to improve the reaction specificity through simultaneous enhancement of main activity and sub-activity, the combination by using two selection parameters (main activity and sub-activity) was performed. Twelve single mutants with both higher main activity and lower sub-activity than the wild type were selected (C152V, C211I, C332A, M52V, M52Q, M110L, M110I, M110P, M213G, M213L, M276Q, and M349A) (Fig. 4h). The selected 12 single mutants were comprehensively combined, which generated 15 active and stable double variants showing both higher main activity and lower sub-activity than the wild type (Fig. 4i). From among the 15 double variants, the 3 with the highest main activity and the 3 with the lowest sub-activity were selected, respectively. These six double variants were comprehensively combined, which produced one active and stable triple and eight quadruple variants (Fig. 4 (j and k)). Further combination of the quadruple variants did not yield active and stable quintuple variants. The maximal and minimal values of the four properties for the selected single mutants and double and quadruple variants were as follows: maximal main activity, 17.9 units/mg (M110I), 19.5 units/mg (M52Q/C211I and M52V/C211I), and 19.3 units/mg (M52Q/M110I/C152V/C211I); minimal sub-activity, 0.592 units/mg (M52V), 0.420 units/mg (M110I/M276Q), and 0.357 units/mg (M52Q/M110L/C211I/M276Q); and minimal reaction specificity, 3.3% (M52V), 2.4% (M110L/M276Q), and 2.1% (M52Q/C152V/C211I/M213G and M52Q/M110I/C152V/C211I). These results obviously indicated that both the main activity and sub-activity of multiple variants were simultaneously improved, and thus the reaction specificity was efficiently reduced. Combination Using All Four Selection Parameters—The two results of combinatorial experiments using two selection parameters led the combination by using all four selection parameters (main activity, sub-activity, reaction specificity, and therma"
https://openalex.org/W2066284273,"The capsules of two colony morphotypes of Mycobacterium avium strain 2151 were investigated, i.e. the virulent smooth-transparent (SmT1) and the nonvirulent smooth-opaque (SmO) types. From both morphotypes we separated a nonacylated arabinomannan (AM) from an acylated polysaccharide fraction by affinity chromatography, of which the AMs were structurally characterized. The AMs from the virulent morphotype, in contrast to that from the nonvirulent form, possessed a larger mannan chain and a shorter arabinan chain. Incubation of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages and human dendritic cells showed that the acylated polysaccharide fractions were potent inducers of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-12, and interleukin-10 compared with nonacylated AMs, which led to only a marginal cytokine release. Further in vitro experiments showed that both the acylated polysaccharide fractions and the nonacylated AMs were able to induce in vitro anti-tumor cytotoxicity of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Thus, morphotype-specific structural differences in the capsular AMs of M. avium do not correlate with biological activity; however, their acylation is a prerequisite for effective stimulation of murine macrophages and human dendritic cells. The capsules of two colony morphotypes of Mycobacterium avium strain 2151 were investigated, i.e. the virulent smooth-transparent (SmT1) and the nonvirulent smooth-opaque (SmO) types. From both morphotypes we separated a nonacylated arabinomannan (AM) from an acylated polysaccharide fraction by affinity chromatography, of which the AMs were structurally characterized. The AMs from the virulent morphotype, in contrast to that from the nonvirulent form, possessed a larger mannan chain and a shorter arabinan chain. Incubation of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages and human dendritic cells showed that the acylated polysaccharide fractions were potent inducers of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-12, and interleukin-10 compared with nonacylated AMs, which led to only a marginal cytokine release. Further in vitro experiments showed that both the acylated polysaccharide fractions and the nonacylated AMs were able to induce in vitro anti-tumor cytotoxicity of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Thus, morphotype-specific structural differences in the capsular AMs of M. avium do not correlate with biological activity; however, their acylation is a prerequisite for effective stimulation of murine macrophages and human dendritic cells. Numerous bacteria, in particular extraintestinal and invasive pathogens, express capsules that enable them to decorate surface molecules, leading to inhibition of phagocytosis. Other encapsulated intracellular pathogens protect themselves against phagocytic digestion by actively killing macrophages. Some mycobacterial species contain capsular-like outer layers, which consist mainly of polysaccharides, proteins, and small amounts of lipids (1Daffé M. Draper P. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 39: 131-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First evidence of the presence of a mycobacterial capsule was provided in 1959 by Chapman et al. (2Chapman G.B. Hanks J.H. Wallace J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1959; 77: 205-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a “capsular space” between the phagosomal membrane of the infected cell and a mycobacterium. Electronmicroscopy led to the term “electron transparent zone.” In 1986 the existence of the capsule was confirmed by chemical analyses (3Rastogi N. Frehel C. David H.L. Curr. Microbiol. 1986; 13: 237-242Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Unlike other bacterial capsules, the mycobacterial capsule does not seem to offer protection against phagocytosis. In contrast, mycobacteria have developed strategies to penetrate into macrophages, which usually are responsible for initial nonspecific degradation of pathogens but which, during innate immunity, present mycobacteria the optimal environmental conditions for survival and replication (4Frehel C. De Chastellier C. Offredo C. Berche P. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 2207-2214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like other capsules, those of mycobacteria consist mainly of polysaccharides. The function of such capsular polysaccharides has not been completely determined up to now. They may protect the bacteria against enzymatic digestion after phagocytosis. Furthermore, capsular polysaccharides possibly trigger the interaction between bacteria and host cells during the first steps of infection, and it has been assumed that they contribute to intracellular persistence and replication. Taken together, capsular polysaccharides are believed to be potent virule. Three polysaccharides of the capsule of Mycobacterium tuberculosis have been isolated and partly characterized, i.e. a glycogen-like glucan with an estimated molecular mass of 100 kDa, a mannan, and an arabinomannan (AM) 5F0The abbreviations used are: AM, arabinomannan; LAM, lipoarabinomannan; SmT, smooth-transparent; SmO, smooth-opaque; GC/MS, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry; COSY, correlation spectroscopy; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy; ROESY, rotating frame Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy; HMQC, heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence; HMBC, heteronuclear multiple bond correlation; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; DC, dendritic cells; IL, interleukin; MNC, mononuclear cells; Araf, arabinofuranosyl unit; Manp, mannopyranosyl unit; t-Manp, terminal Manp; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; ConA, concanavalin A. (1Daffé M. Draper P. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 39: 131-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The exact localization and arrangement of these polysaccharides remain to be determined. Both glucan and AM were expressed in vivo and in vitro (5Schwebach J.R. Glatman-Freedman A. Gunther-Cummins L. Dai Z. Robbins J.B. Schnerson R. Casadevall A. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 2566-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 6Schwebach J.R. Casadevall A. Schnerson R. Dai Z. Wang X. Robbins J.B. Glatman-Freedman A. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 5671-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It has been shown by immunoelectron microscopy that the AM is localized in the capsule (7Glatman-Freedman B. Mednick A.J. Lendvai N. Casadevall A. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1996; 34: 2795-2802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another modified AM possessing serological activity has been isolated from Mycobacterium smegmatis (8Weber P.L. Gray G.R. Carbohydr. Res. 1979; 74: 259-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The exact structure of the AM (estimated molecular mass, 13 kDa) from M. tuberculosis has not been fully characterized. The proposed structure comprises a mannan backbone substituted by a branched arabinan, which is further modified by Man residues at the nonreducing end. The arabinan is structurally similar to the arabinan of the arabinogalactan located in the cell wall (9Daffé M. Brennan P.J. McNeil M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6734-6743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Daffé M. Brennan P.J. McNeil M. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 249: 383-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Mycobacterial surface molecules including lipoarabinomannan (LAM) and AMs have been shown to stimulate and activate immune cells. These immunomodulatory properties have ultimately led to the use of such compounds in vaccination against mycobacterial infections and as immunotherapeutic agents in cancer therapy (11Hayashi Y. Ebina T. Suzuki F. Ishida N. Microbiol. Immunol. 1981; 25: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 12Navoa J.A. Laal S. Pirofski L.A. McLean G.R. Dai Z. Robbins J.B. Schnerson R.

Lett. 1994; 40: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). AMs preparations show profound anti-tumor activity in murine experimental cancer models, and mechanistic studies reveal that the anti-tumor activity of AMs depends on distinct immune cell populations and TH1 cytokines (16Oka H. Shiraishi Y. Sasaki H. Yoshinaga K. Emori Y. Takei M. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2003; 26: 1336-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 17Oka H. Sasaki H. Shiraishi Y. Emori Y. Yoshinaga K. Takei M. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2004; 27: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, these reported studies were performed on Z-100, an extract from M. tuberculosis strain Aoyama B, which was described as containing AMs as well as LAM. Thus, it remains unclear whether acylation plays a role in the identified biological activities. Thus far, little is known about the structural characteristics and the potential biological role of AMs from other mycobacterial species. Infection with Mycobacterium avium, a facultative intracellular opportunistic pathogen in humans, is a well studied model for mycobacterial infections. A major phenotypic characteristic of M. avium isolates is their ability to appear in different colony morphotypes, smooth (either transparent or opaque) or rough (reviewed in Ref. 20Inderlied C.B. Kemper C.A. Bermudez L.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 6: 266-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Although morphotypes of the same strain are very closely related, previous studies have demonstrated that the smooth-transparent variant is usually better able to survive and grow intracellularly than the opaque morphotype (21Furney S.K. Skinner P.S. Roberts A.D. Appelberg R. Orme I.M. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 4410-4413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Meylan P.R. Richman D.D. Kornbluth R.S. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 2564-2568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With regard to the M. avium morphotypes used in this study (2151 SmT and SmO), this pattern has been confirmed both in murine macrophages and in a mouse model of infection (23Appelberg R. Orme I.M. Immunology. 1993; 80: 352-359PubMed Google Scholar, 24Appelberg R. Sarmento A. Castro A.G. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1995; 101: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the current study we purified AMs of SmT and SmO of M. avium strain 2151. To correlate the structural properties with biological activity we used cytokine production by human and murine dendritic cells and induced cytotoxicity of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNCs) as read-out systems. As a result we found distinct structural differences in the AM polysaccharide composition of SmT compared with that of SmO, which did not correspond to differences in biological activity. Our studies also revealed that AMs from M. avium could induce cytotoxicity of human immune effector cells in vitro. Chemical Reagents—All chemicals were of highest grade. Aqueous solutions for chemical reactions were prepared with Milli-Q® water. Bacteria and Growth Conditions—Mycobacterium avium, serovar 2, strain 2151, was originally isolated from a patient with AIDS (25Belisle J.T. McNeil M.R. Chatterjee D. Inamine J.M. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10510-10516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The colony morphotypes SmT and SmO were grown in stable form on Middlebrook 7H10-agar (19.0 g liter-1, Difco), containing nutrient broth (4.0 g liter-1, Difco), glycerol (8.0 g liter-1, Merck), glucose (5.5 g liter-1, Merck), sodium pyruvate (0.76 g liter-1, Merck), and sodium glutamate (0.5 g liter-1, Merck). The pH was adjusted to 7.7. Cultivations comprised 150 agar plates (150 × 20 mm, Sarstedt, with 100 ml medium each) and proceeded at 37 °C for 7 weeks. Yields were 0.5-1.0 g wet mass/plate. Isolation of Polysaccharides—Aqueous phenol (1%, w/v) was added to the freshly harvested wet cells (18 ml g-1), and the suspensions were gently shaken at 4 °C for 48 h. After centrifugation at 27,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min, the supernatant was filtrated (0.22 μm, Steritop, Millipore), dialyzed against MilliQ-H2O (5 × 10 liters) at 4 °C, using 3,500 MWCO membrane (SpectraPor, Roth) to remove phenol and low-molecular mass components, and finally lyophilized (yield: 1.5% of the bacterial wet mass). This capsular material was extracted with 10% aqueous Triton X-114 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at 37 °C as described (26Chatterjee D. Khoo K-H. Glycobiol. 1998; 8: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) to eliminate lipoglycans (i.e. phosphatidylinositol mannosides) and lipoproteins. After phase separation, the aqueous layer was precipitated with cold acetone, and the obtained sediment was washed once with cold acetone and then dried under a stream of nitrogen (0.26% of the bacterial wet mass). The aqueous phase was resuspended in a small volume of water and added to 46% (w/v) ammonium sulfate saturation, and incubated at 20-22 °C for 4 h, then at 4 °C for 18 h, to precipitate the proteins. The sample was centrifuged (14,000 × g, 4 °C, 60 min), yielding a precipitate composed mostly of proteins and a supernatant containing mostly polysaccharides. To remove the salt the sediment and the supernatant were extensively dialyzed at 4 °C against aqua bidest.(6 × 10 liters) and freeze-dried. To remove rests of the protein the polysaccharide-rich supernatants were incubated with Proteinase K (10 μgml-1; Boehringer, 50 °C, 5 h), dialyzed and finally freeze-dried. Size Exclusion Chromatography—Proteinase K-treated polysaccharide-rich fractions were applied on a Sephadex G-50 column (3 × 80 cm; Amersham Biosciences) at 20-22 °C and eluted with pyridine/acetic acid/water (4/10/1000 by volume) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min-1. The void volume was determined using dextran blue (10 mg ml-1; molecular mass, 2 × 106 Da). Separated fractions were detected by a differential refractometer, combined, concentrated on a rotary evaporator, and freeze-dried. High Performance Liquid Affinity Chromatography—Separations were performed utilizing a preparative high performance liquid chromatography equipment (HPLC, Abimed-Gilson) at 20-22 °C and a lectin-Sepharose column (ConA-Sepharose 4B, 5 × 1 cm, Sigma) at a flow rate of 0.8 ml min-1. The following gradient was applied: 0.1 m sodium acetate, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 6.1, for 40 min and then 0.5 m α-methyl mannopyranoside in the above eluent for 20 min. UV absorbance was detected at 210 and 280 nm. Obtained fractions were dialyzed extensively against aqua bidest. at 4 °C and then freeze-dried. SDS-PAGE and Lectin Blotting—SDS-PAGE was performed using a MiniProtean 3 cell (Bio-Rad) at 200 V for 50 min. Gels (8 × 7 × 1 mm) were prepared with 12% acrylamide for the separating gel and 5% acrylamide for the stacking gel and were stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad) (27Walker J.M. The Protein Protocol Handbook. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2002: 237-242Google Scholar) and periodic acid Schiff reagent (Merck) (28Carlsson S.R. Glycobiology, A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, 1993Google Scholar). Electroblotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore) was performed by using a Mini Trans-blot electrophoresis transfer cell (Bio-Rad) at 100 V for 1 h. Blotted membranes were washed three times in Tris-HCl-buffered saline/TBST (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.7) and then incubated with 20 ml of TBST containing 100 μg of ConA (Sigma) at 20-22 °C for 1 h. After washing five times with H2O, blots were developed by a reaction mixture of 7 ml of 4-chloro-1-naphthol (Sigma, 3 mg ml-1 methanol), 2 ml of 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), and 20 μl of 30% H2O2 (Sigma) in the dark for 15 min. After washing once with H2O, blots were dried. Analyses—For protein quantification a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) microassay was performed according to the supplier's (Pierce) instructions. The endotoxin contents of fractions A and B isolated by affinity chromatography were established by a chromogenic Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Coamatic Chromo-LAL). Sugar composition and methylation analyses (methylation was repeated twice) were performed as described (29Vinogradov E.V. Holst O. Thomas-Oates J.E. Broady K.W. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Separations were performed on a Hewlett-Packard gas chromatograph 438A equipped with a flame ionization detector and a poly-(5% diphenyl-95% dimethyl)-siloxane SPB-5 capillary column (inner diameter, 30 m × 0.32 mm; film thickness, 0.25 μm; Supelco). Hydrogen was used as a carrier gas at 60 kilopascals. Alditol acetates were separated at 150 °C for 3 min and then, increasing linearly, at 3 °C min-1 to 300 °C. Mass Spectrometry—Identification of partially methylated alditol acetates was performed by GC/MS on a Hewlett-Packard mass spectrometer (HP5989A) equipped with a HP-5MS capillary column. Helium was used as carrier gas at a pressure of 10 p.s.i. The initial temperature of 150 °C was increased after 3 min with 5 °C min-1 to a final temperature of 320 °C. Electron impact mass spectra were recorded at 70 eV. For chemical ionization, NH3 was used as the reactant gas. Isolated AMs were analyzed by high resolution electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI FT-ICR-MS). Measurements were performed on a 7-Tesla-APEX II (Bruker Daltonics) equipped with an Apollo ion source. Spectra were recorded in the positive-ion mode. Samples were dissolved in a mixture of 2-propanol, water, and 30 mm ammonia acetate, pH 4.70 (50:50:0.03, v/v/v), in concentrations of 10 μg μl-1 and sprayed with a flow rate of 2 μl min-1. In experiments using capillary skimmer dissociation the capillary exit voltage was set to 250 V. Theoretical masses of polysaccharide fragments were calculated according to the formula: mass = (a·mAra) + (b·mMan) + mH2O + (c·mNa) - (c·H) atomic mass units. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker DRX AVANCE 600 spectrometer operating at 600.31 MHz for 1H and 150.96 MHz for 13C. Samples were repeatedly exchanged with D2O (500 μl, 99.9% purity, Deutero) with intermediate freeze-drying and then dissolved in 500 μl of D2O (99.99% purity, Deutero). All one- and two-dimensional spectra were recorded at 27 °C. Chemical shifts were expressed in ppm and relative to internal acetone (δH 2.225; δC 31.45). COSY, TOCSY, NOESY, and ROESY spectra were measured using data sets (t1 × t2) of 512 × 2048 points. TOCSY and NOESY experiments were carried out in the phase-sensitive mode with mixing times of 100 and 200 ms, respectively. Heteronuclear two-dimensional 1H,13C correlation was measured by HMQC and HMBC experiments with data sets of 256 × 2048 points. For homo- and heteronuclear correlations experiments, 128 scans were acquired. Isolation and Stimulation of Murine Bone Marrow Macrophages—Bone marrow-derived macrophages were isolated from 8-10-week-old C57BL/6 mice (Charles River) as described (30Reiling N. Klug K. Krallmann-Wenzel U. Laves R. Goyert S. Taylor M.E. Lindhorst T.K. Ehlers S. Immunobiology. 2001; 204: 558-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); 5 ×105 macrophages (106 ml-1) were stimulated with the isolated polysaccharide fractions A and B in concentrations of 1 and 10 μgml-1 at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 h. Supernatants from stimulated murine macrophages were examined for the presence of TNF-α. Detection was performed with an anti-mouse TNF-α kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (DuoSet mouse TNF-α/TNFSF1A, R&D Systems). Generation of Human Monocyte-derived DC—Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from citrate blood of healthy donors by discontinuous gradient centrifugation (Biocoll (separating solution), Biochrom). Monocytes were elutriated by counterflow centrifugation and concentrated to 106 cells ml-1 RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum (Linaris), 100 units ml-1 penicillin, and 100 μgml-1 streptomycin. Differentiation into immature DC was achieved by a 7-day culture in the presence of granulocyte/macrophage-stimulating factor (500 units ml-1) and IL-4 (500 units ml-1). 106 DC ml-1 were stimulated with 10 μgml-1 isolated polysaccharide fractions A and B at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 18 h. The supernatants were examined for the presence of TNF-α, IL-10, and IL-12 (Ready-Set-Go, human IL-12 ELISA, eBiosciences) by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stimulation of Human MNC—Human MNC were stimulated with polysaccharide fractions A and B in concentrations of 10 and 40 μgml-1, Mycobacterium bovis BCG (Connaught substrain, Immucyst ®) with an multiplicity of infection of 0.04 cell-1 and phosphate-buffered saline (100 μl) were added. Cells were cultured for 7 days in 6-well microtiter plates at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cell Culture—The human bladder tumor cell line T-24 was cultivated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 (PAA Laboratories) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Linaris), 1% glutamate, 100 units ml-1 penicillin, and 100 μgml-1 streptomycin. Chromium Release Assay—Cytotoxicity of stimulated human MNC against tumor cells was determined in a standard chromium release assay. Target cells were harvested, washed, and labeled with 50 μCi of Na 512CrO4 (Hartmann)/106 cells for 1.5 h at 37 °C. After washing, the cells were resuspended with a final concentration of 5 × 104 cells ml-1. Effector cells were harvested and added to a total of 100 μl of target cells at effector/target ratios of 40:1, 20:1, and 10:1. The radioactive content of the supernatant was measured in a γ-counter (Berthold) after incubation for 5 h at 37 °C,5%CO2. The specific lysis was determined according to the formula: specific lysis (%) = (Reff - Rspo)/(Rmax - Rspo) × 100. By adding 100 μl of medium, the spontaneous release of radioactivity (Rspo) was defined. The maximum release (Rmax) was achieved by adding 100 μl of lysis solution. The experimental release of radioactivity, which was induced by the effector cells (Reff), was measured in triplicates. Extraction and Purification of AM—Applying a mild aqueous phenol extraction method (31Whittaker D.V. Parolis L.A.S. Parolis H. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 253: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), capsular material was extracted from the envelope of M. avium. SDS-PAGE of this phenol extract showed numerous proteins after Coomassie staining. Successive blotting and staining with ConA-conjugated peroxidase revealed the occurrence of LAM, lipomannan, and phosphoinositolmannan (not shown). The lipoglycans not only are membrane-associated (32Nigou L. Gilleron M. Cahuzac B. Bounery J.D. Herold M. Thurner M. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23094-23103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) but also are thought to be present in the outer surface of the bacilli (33Chatterjee D. Roberts A.D. Lowell K. Brennan P.J. Orme I.M. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 1249-1253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and thus extractable under mild conditions. Routine monosaccharide analysis showed the presence of sugars in the phenol extract, namely Ara, Man, Glc, Gal, and two different O-methylhexoses. To separate the lipoglycans, an additional extraction utilizing the detergent Triton X-114 was performed (33Chatterjee D. Roberts A.D. Lowell K. Brennan P.J. Orme I.M. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 1249-1253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting detergent phase included LAM, lipomannan, and phosphoinositolmannan, and the aqueous phase comprised proteins and carbohydrates. Precipitation with ammonium sulfate separated proteins from carbohydrates. The protein-containing sediments are presently being investigated separately. The supernatants (containing carbohydrates) were further fractionated by size exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G-50. Three base-line-separated fractions were obtained, the last of which was identified as salt. Fraction 1 (eluting in the void volume) contained Glc and Gal in an approximate molar ratio of 1:3. Fraction 2 comprised Ara and Man in an approximate molar ratio of 5:4 (preparation of M. avium 2151, SmO) and 10:7 (preparation of SmT), as well as Glc and O-methylhexose in minor amounts. Fractions 2 of both SmO and SmT were separated on ConA-Sepharose, from which ConA-nonreactive acylated polysaccharides (fraction A) and ConA-reactive arabinomannans (fraction B) were isolated (Fig. 1). Compositional Analyses—The same sugars were identified in fractions A from SmO and SmT, however, in different ratios. Arabinose was identified in both samples in similar concentrations (SmO, 502 nmol mg-1; SmT, 477 nmol mg-1). The major component was a 6-O-methyl-hexose (SmO, 1069 nmol mg-1; SmT, 779 nmol mg-1). Another 3-O-methyl-hexose was less abundant in fraction A from SmO (126 nmol mg-1) than in that from SmT (467 nmol mg-1). There was also a clear distinction in Man content between fractions A of SmO (113 nmol mg-1) and SmT (732 nmol mg-1). Glc (SmO, 697 nmol mg-1; SmT, 616 nmol mg-1) and Gal (SmO, 113 nmol mg-1; SmT, 204 nmol mg-1) were also present in both samples. For linkage analysis, fraction A was methylated (34Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3215) Google Scholar), hydrolyzed, reduced, and acetylated. GC/MS analyses of the resulting partially methylated alditol acetates identified two terminal, two 4-substituted, one 3-substituted, one 6-substituted, and one 3,4-disubstituted hexoses. Pentose (arabinose) residues were present as terminal, 5-substituted, 2-substituted, and 3,5-disubstituted furanoses. Another methylation analysis involving MeI-D3 revealed that 6-O-methyl-hexose was 4-substituted, whereas the 3-O-methyl-hexose occurred as both a terminal and a 4-substituted residue. In SmO the presence of 4-substituted Hexp was more than twice as abundant as in SmT (SmO, ∼20%; SmT, ∼9%). Compared with fraction A of SmT, only one-third of the 6-substituted Hexp was present in SmO (SmT, ∼12%; SmO, ∼4%). Fractions B consisted exclusively of Ara and Man and thus were pure AMs. A distinct difference in the Ara/Man ratio was identified between the AMs obtained from SmO and from SmT. In the AMs of SmO, an approximate molar ratio of Ara/Man of about 1:1 was identified (2070 nmol mg-1 Ara; 2201 nmol mg-1 Man), whereas in the AMs of SmT a ratio of ∼3:10 (692 nmol mg-1 Ara; 2319 nmol mg-1 Man) was found. Methylation analyses of both AMs revealed the presence of the same substituted sugars but in different ratios (data can be found in the supplemental information, Table S1). In both AMs four differently substituted Araf and six differently substituted Manp residues were identified. However, there was a clear structural difference between these polysaccharides. In agreement with the results of neutral sugar analyses, a total of 60% hexose residues was identified in the AMs from SmT and only 41% in the AMs from SmO. With regard to the pentose residues, the polysaccharides differed in the content of both the 5- and 2-substituted Araf residues. The AMs from SmT contained ∼18% 5-substituted Araf and the AMs from SmO 28%. The quantity of 2-substituted Araf was less in SmT (∼7%) than in SmO (∼12%). Regarding hexose residues there was a clear difference in the amount of 6-substituted Manp. The content of this residue in the AMs from SmT (19%) exceeded that in the AMs from SmO (6%). Branched 2,6-disubstituted Manp residues were twice as abundant in the AMs from SmT (∼12%) than those from SmO (6-7%). 2-Substituted Manp (∼6% in SmT and SmO) as well as 3-substituted Manp (5% in SmT, ∼4% in SmO) occurred in both AMs in similar content. t-Manp residues were also present in similar concentrations (SmT, 15%; SmO, 17%). Thus, the results of methylation analyses were consistent with structural differences between both AMs as indicated by compositional analyses. The polysaccharide from SmT possessed a larger mannan (∼60%) and shorter arabinan (∼40%), and the AMs from SmO comprised a truncated mannan (41%) and a larger arabinan (∼59%). NMR Spectroscopy—NMR experiments identified a pyranosidic ring form for all hexoses and a furanosidic configuration for all pentose/arabinose residues. Signals at 0.9 and 1.3 ppm demonstrated the presence of fatty acids in fraction A, showing that at least some molecules were acylated. Thus, chemical and NMR spectroscopy analyses revealed that fractions A contained lipoglycans, probably including LAM. These structures were not investigated further. One-dimensional 1H-NMR spectra of the AMs from SmT and SmO (Fig. 2) showed at least 10 partially overlapping anomeric signals (A-J, 5.5-4.9 ppm) with chemical shifts typical for the α-configuration. The presence of fatty acids could be excluded because of missing signals around 0.9 ppm (-CH3) and 1.3 ppm (-CH2-). In both spectra very similar chemical shifts, but with different intensities, were identified. Two-dimensional NMR experiments, namely COSY and HMQC (supporting information in supplemental Figs. S1 and S2, respectively), allowed overlapping signals to be distinguished. In the case of the AMs of SmT, the resonance at 5.13 ppm (Fig. 2a) comprised three anomeric sig"

Until recently it was thought that the eukaryotes (animals, plants, fungi and protists) were descended from archaebacteria — extremophile prokaryotes distinct from 'true' bacteria, or eubacteria. Now it is clear that it is not that simple. Evolution has arrived at a strange cocktail of genes from various prokaryote sources for the eukaryotes, but the availability of a broad range of whole genome sequences could provide the information needed to unravel these complex connections."

In a proteomics screen for post-translational modifications on the APC, we discovered that Mnd2 is phosphorylated during mitosis in a cell cycle-dependent manner. We identified and characterized the sites of mitotic Mnd2 phosphorylation during the cell cycle. Collective mutation of Mnd2 phosphorylation sites to alanine had no effect on vegetative growth but a striking effect (>85% reduction) on the percentage of tetrad-forming cells compared with the wild type strain. Similar to the MND2 deletion strain, cells harboring the alanine mutant that did not form spores arrested after premeiotic S phase with a single undivided nucleus and low levels of the APCAma1 meiotic substrate, Clb5, relative to wild type cells. In contrast, collective mutation of Mnd2 phosphorylation sites to aspartic acid resulted in partial suppression of the sporulation defect. No differences were observed in the binding between each Mnd2 isoform and the APC in vitro. However, in vivo, we observed a gradient in the abundance of APC-associated Mnd2 in each strain that was proportional to the observed differences in sporulation and Clb5 levels.

During mitosis and meiosis, targeted protein degradation is tightly associated with the organization of chromosomes and their equivalent distribution into two separate progeny cells during anaphase and is controlled by a multisubunit ubiquitin ligase called the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) (5Peters J.M.

As an E3 ligase, the APC transfers ubiquitin onto lysine residues of substrate proteins in an iterative manner that forms polyubiquitin chains on the surface of a substrate protein (8King R.W.

Luca F.C. Ruderman J.V. Hershko A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). The polyubiquitinated substrate is then recognized by the 26 S proteosome and degraded, while the ubiquitin is recycled. The APC is itself regulated, ensuring that the timing of substrate degradation is tied to the completion of other cellular processes. Indeed misregulation of the APC can lead to disastrous results including cell cycle arrest or improper chromosome segregation and cell death (10Wasch R. Engelbert D. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 11Yamasaki L. Pagano M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 12Bashir T. Pagano M. Adv. Cancer Res. 2003; 88: 101-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Regulation of the APC during mitosis is accomplished by several mechanisms, including the association of co-activator proteins and through phosphorylation of individual subunits within the complex. Two co-activator proteins, Cdc20 and Cdh1, facilitate the association of substrate proteins with the APC at different stages of the mitotic cell cycle (13Visintin R. Prinz S. Amon A.

Additionally specific subunits of the APC are phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner, which has been shown to enhance binding and activation by Cdc20 (22Lahav-Baratz S. Sudakin V.

Cell. 2000; 11: 1555-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). APC subunit phosphorylation is controlled in large part by mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase activated by the Clb2 cyclin, which is later targeted for destruction by the APC upon exit from mitosis (25Rudner A.D. Hardwick K.G. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1361-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 26Rudner A.D. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1377-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). As a result, the APC exists in a hyperphosphorylated state during mitosis and a hypophosphorylated state during G1 phase. Mutation of the cyclin-dependent kinase consensus sites in the APC subunits Cdc16, Cdc27, and Cdc23 results in reduced APCCdc20 activity toward Clb2 in vivo as well as a delay in the onset of anaphase (25Rudner A.D. Hardwick K.G. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1361-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 26Rudner A.D. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1377-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Currently there is no evidence that mutation of known mitotic APC phosphorylation sites will have detrimental effects on meiotic cell cycle transitions. In budding yeast the APC is regulated during meiosis not only by Cdc20 and Cdh1 co-activators but also by a meiosis-specific co-activator called Ama1 (27Chu S. DeRisi J. Eisen M. Mulholland J. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Herskowitz I. Science. 1998; 282: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar, 28Blanco M.A. Pelloquin L. Moreno S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2135-2143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is necessary for spore wall assembly and expression of late meiotic genes (29Cooper K.F. Mallory M.J. Egeland D.B. Jarnik M. Strich R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14548-14553Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). AMA1 gene transcription and splicing occurs only in meiotic cells (29Cooper K.F.

However, the co-activator is selectively inhibited early in meiosis by the APC subunit Mnd2 (30Oelschlaegel T. Schwickart M. Matos J. Bogdanova A. Camasses A. Havlis J. Shevchenko A. Zachariae W.

Cell. 2005; 120: 789-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Mnd2 is found in complex with the APC during both the mitotic and meiotic cell cycles (32Yoon H.J. Feoktistova A. Wolfe B.A. Jennings J.L. Link A.J. Gould K.L. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 2048-2054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 33Passmore L.A. McCormack E.A. Au S.W.

Chem. 2003; 278: 16698-16705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Yeast lacking Mnd2 proceed normally through the mitotic cell cycle but are unable to complete sporulation, arresting before the first meiotic nuclear division with uncondensed chromatin (35Rabitsch K.P. Toth A. Galova M. Schleiffer A. Schaffner G. Aigner E. Rupp C. Penkner A.M. Moreno-Borchart A.C. Primig M. Esposito R.E. Klein F. Knop M. Nasmyth K. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1001-1009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Recent evidence has shown that Mnd2 specifically inhibits APC activation by Ama1 during prophase I. In cells lacking Mnd2, uninhibited APCAma1 prematurely targets securin (Pds1) for degradation, which results in the premature separation of sister chromatids due to unrestrained separase (Esp1) activity (30Oelschlaegel T. Schwickart M. Matos J. Bogdanova A. Camasses A. Havlis J. Shevchenko A. Zachariae W. Cell. 2005; 120: 773-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), followed by cell cycle arrest. Uninhibited APCAma1 was also found to control the degradation of Clb5 during meiosis. Although inhibited early in meiosis, APCAma1 becomes active during anaphase I despite the presence of Mnd2, suggesting that the inhibitory function of Mnd2 is regulated post-translationally. Furthermore it has been suggested that regulation of Mnd2 might be linked to its phosphorylation status (30Oelschlaegel T. Schwickart M. Matos J. Bogdanova A. Camasses A. Havlis J. Shevchenko A. Zachariae W. Cell. 2005; 120: 773-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In a screen for cell cycle-dependent post-translational modifications that occur on the APC during mitosis, we discovered that Mnd2 is one of five major phosphorylated subunits in the complex. Here we show the identity of Mnd2 phosphorylation sites and their relative changes during the cell cycle using mass spectrometry. To determine the functional significance of Mnd2 phosphorylation, we used site-directed mutagenesis to generate yeast strains harboring Mnd2 phosphorylation site mutants and then tested these mutants for their ability to progress through mitosis or meiosis. Vegetative growth of mnd2 phosphorylation site mutants was unperturbed. However, sporulation of a mnd2-(S/T-A) strain was severely compromised, whereas reciprocal mutation to aspartic acid partially suppressed the sporulation defect. The defects in sporulation of the alanine mutant were consistent with those of the deletion strain, including arrest before the first meiotic nuclear division and reduced ability to accumulate Clb5. The sporulation defect of the alanine mutant strain can be explained by the relatively low levels of mnd2-(S/T-A) found in APC co-precipitations compared with the aspartic acid mutant and wild type Mnd2 isoforms in vivo. However, in vitro binding between the APC and each Mnd2 isoform was found to be almost identical, and treatment of the APC with phosphatase did not eliminate Mnd2 co-precipitation, suggesting that phosphorylation may be necessary to maintain the stability of Mnd2 before entry into meiosis. Taken together, these data support a role for mitotic phosphorylation in the regulation of Mnd2 as an APCAma1 inhibitor in early meiosis. Plasmid and Strain Construction—Standard methods for the growth, maintenance, and transformation of yeast and bacteria and for the manipulation of DNA were used. All constructed plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Strain W1588-4c is a derivative of W303 in which the weak rad5 mutation has been repaired (36Zhao X. Muller E.G. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Strains expressing Cdc27 and Mnd2 with C-terminal 3× FLAG epitopes were constructed by integrating PCR amplicons amplified from p3FLAG-KanMX plasmid (a gift from Dr. Toshio Ysukiyama, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center) into the yeast genome as described previously (37Gelbart M.E. Rechsteiner T. Richmond T.J. Tsukiyama T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2098-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The Apc1-TAP strain was generated by integration of PCR amplicons from pBS1539 as described previously (38Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). Construction of phosphorylation site mutations in MND2 was accomplished using the QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's specifications (oligonucleotide sequences are available upon request). Mutations were made and sequenced in pIVEX-FLAG-MND2 in which the MND2 open reading frame was originally cloned into the NotI/SalI sites (34Hall M.C. Torres M.P. Schroeder G.K. Borchers C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16698-16705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). After mutagenesis, the XhoI fragment from pIVEX-FLAG-MND2 or pIVEX-FLAG-mnd2 phosphorylation site mutant (containing all 14 mutations within the last 702 base pairs of the open reading frame) was subcloned into the XhoI site of pMT004, a pRS404 vector containing the first 405 base pairs of the MND2 open reading frame (up to the naturally existing XhoI site) and 500 base pairs of the upstream promoter region. The resulting wild type, S/T-A mutant, and S/T-D mutant plasmids were linearized with HindIII and integrated into the trp locus of YKA311 in which the open reading frame for MND2 in the high efficiency sporulating yeast strain RSY333 was replaced with KanMX4 by PCR-mediated transformation (29Cooper K.F.

Diploid strains were created by transformation with YCp50::HO (HO mothallic switching endonuclease) and selecting for transformants on synthetic dextrose lacking uracil (SD-URA). Successful conversion to diploid was confirmed by flow cytometry.TABLE 1S. cerevisiae strains used in this studyStrainRelevant genotypeSourceW1588-4caDerived from W1588-4c, which is a derivative of W303 in which the weak rad5 mutation has been repaired (see “Experimental Procedures”).MATa ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 ura3-1R.

For M phase arrests in the temperature-sensitive strain YKA156, cells were grown for two generations at the permissive temperature (27 °C) and arrested by shifting the temperature to 37 °C, which results in late M phase arrest (39Jaspersen S.L.

The degree of cell cycle arrest was monitored by phase-contrast microscopy, and cells were harvested by centrifugation after >90% of the culture reached the desired morphology (unbudded for G1 arrest and equivalently budded for M arrest). Harvested cells were washed once with deionized water, centrifuged once more, and frozen at –80 °C overnight prior to protein purification. Affinity Purifications and Phosphatase Assays—Yeast cells were lysed at 4 °C in prechilled lysis buffer containing 25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5 (Fisher), 400 mm NaCl (Sigma), 10% glycerol (Fisher), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (Sigma), 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma), 50 mm NaF (Sigma), 1.3 mm activated sodium ortho-vanadate (Sigma), 50 mm β-glycerophosphate (Spectrum), 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Roche Applied Science), and Complete protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science). All purification steps were conducted at 4 °C. Approximately 1011 cells were lysed with 0.5-mm glass beads in 200 ml of lysis buffer using a bead beater (Biospec Products Inc.) operated for 6 × 1.25-min pulses with 5-min rest intervals. The resulting extract was cleared by centrifugation at 92,000 × g for 1 h. The cleared extract was incubated on a rotisserie for 3 h with a 200-μl bead volume of EZview Red anti-FLAG M2 affinity matrix (Sigma) equilibrated with lysis buffer. After incubation, the affinity matrix was harvested by centrifugation and washed 4 × 10 min with 25 ml of lysis buffer. For experiments in which the APC was separated by HPLC, the beads were washed another 4 × 10 min with 25 ml of detergent-free buffer containing 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 400 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and all phosphatase and protease inhibitors described earlier. The APC was eluted from the affinity matrix by two 10-min incubations at 30 °C and 950-rpm shaking with a bead-equivalent volume of 0.5 mg/ml 3× FLAG peptide (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in either lysis buffer or detergent-free sodium phosphate buffer. Phosphatase assays on full-length protein were conducted on the APC directly bound to the affinity matrix after washing with detergent-free sodium phosphate buffer. The affinity matrix was first conditioned 4 × 7 min with 1 ml of phosphatase buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MnCl2. Next the matrix was split, and one-half was treated with 1000 units of λ-phosphatase dissolved in 1 bead-equivalent volume of phosphatase buffer at 30 °C for 30 min. Both halves were then washed 2 × 7 min with 1 ml of detergent-free sodium phosphate buffer, and the APC was eluted as described above. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) target phosphatase assays were conducted as described previously (42Torres M.P. Thapar R. Marzluff W.F. Borchers C.H. J. Proteome Res. 2005; 4: 1628-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). GST Fusion Protein—MND2 wild type, S/T-A, or S/T-D genes were subcloned into pGEX-4T1 by PCR from the pRS404 vectors harboring each gene isoform. The resulting N-terminal GST fusion constructs were overexpressed in BL21 pLysS cells according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene). Cells were lysed by sonication in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and cleared by centrifugation. GST fusion proteins were purified from the cell lysate by batch incubation with glutathione-Sepharose™ 4B (Amersham Biosciences). Each GST fusion protein was digested with trypsin to verify length and sequence by MALDI-time of flight (TOF) MS. Chromatography—Full-length APC subunits eluted from the affinity matrix were fractionated by reverse-phase HPLC using an Agilent 1100 series HPLC instrument coupled to a C4 Mass Spec reverse-phase column (Vydac), an 1100 series UV spectrophotometer (Agilent), and a Foxy 200 fraction collector (ISCO Inc.). Conditions for HPLC separation were as follows: buffer A, 5% acetonitrile (ACN), 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; buffer B, 95% ACN, 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid; gradient, 5% B for 5 min, 5–65% B in 65 min, and 65-95% B in 10 min. Fractions were collected every minute, frozen at –80 °C, and lyophilized. In-gel digestion with porcine trypsin was conducted as described previously (43Borchers C. Peter J.F. Hall M.C. Kunkel T.A. Tomer K.B. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 1163-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Separation of tryptic peptides was accomplished by capillary HPLC using an Agilent 1100 series capillary liquid chromatography system with PepMap C18 column (LC Packings) connected in line with a Probot MALDI target microfraction collector (LC Packings) (44Parker C.E. Warren M.R. Loiselle D.R. Dicheva N.N. Scarlett C.O. Borchers C.H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 301: 117-151PubMed Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometry—Lyophilized C4 HPLC fractions containing full-length Mnd2 were reconstituted in 5 μl of 85% ACN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and one-tenth of the sample was prepared for MALDI-TOF MS by the dried droplet method with a saturated solution of sinapic acid (Fluka) in 50% ACN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The reconstituted sample was then analyzed directly on a Reflex III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics Inc.) operating in linear mode. Linear mode MALDI-TOF mass spectra were obtained immediately after calibrating the mass spectrometer using a mixture of bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and cytochrome c (Sigma) that was spotted in close proximity to the sample. Liquid chromatography microfractions were analyzed on an ABI 4700 MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems Inc.) using a saturated solution of recrystallized α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% ACN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as the matrix. In Vivo 32P Labeling—Yeast strains were labeled with monosodium [32P]phosphate in vivo as described previously (26Rudner A.D. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1377-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Briefly saturated overnight 5-ml cultures were diluted to A600 = 0.2 in 50 ml of YPD and allowed to grow to A600 = 0.6 at which time Me2SO was added to 1%. At A600 = 0.8, each culture was arrested in M phase by addition of nocodazole to 15 μg/ml or in G1 phase by addition of α-factor as described above (see “Cell Cycle Arrests”). After arresting for 3 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with sterile water, and resuspended in 35 ml of synthetic complete medium lacking phosphate and containing Me2SO, nocodazole, and 1 mCi of NaH 322PO4 (ICN Inc.). After labeling for 1 h at 30 °C, cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once with water, transferred to a 2-ml screw cap tube, and frozen at –80 °C. Cells were lysed by adding cell pellet-equivalent volumes of lysis buffer and 0.5-mm glass beads to the pellet and vortexing 6 × 2 min at maximum power with 5-min rest intervals on ice. All following steps were conducted at 4 °C. The extract was cleared by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 16,100 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh 2-ml screw cap tube followed by affinity purification as described above. The APC was eluted as described above and then precipitated to remove excess volume and salt by adding 10 volumes of cold acetone and incubating at –20 °C overnight. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 16,100 × g for 20 min, air-dried at room temperature, and then resuspended in 1× lithium dodecyl sulfate loading buffer (Invitrogen Inc.) containing 100 mm dithiothreitol. The sample was separated on a precast 4–12% BisTris acrylamide gel (Invitrogen), dried, and exposed to a storage phosphor screen for analysis by PhosphorImager (Storm, Amersham Biosciences). Growth Curves, Sporulation Assays, and Western Blotting—To measure relative growth rates of strains harboring mnd2 phosphorylation site mutants or complete open reading frame deletions, saturated overnight cultures grown in YPD medium were diluted 20-fold into 5 ml of fresh YPD medium and grown for ∼1 or 3 h at 30 or 37 °C, respectively. Each culture was then diluted to A660 = 0.025 (∼3 × 105 cells/ml) in three separate tubes with 5 ml of fresh YPD medium and grown at 30 or 37 °C for 8–9 h. Growth was monitored every 2 h by measuring the absorbance at 660 nm with a SmartSpec 3000 spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad). To induce sporulation, single colonies picked f"
