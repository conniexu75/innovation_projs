IL-8 activates neutrophils by binding to two distinct seven-transmembrane (7-TMR) G-protein coupled receptors CXCR1 (IL-8RA) and CXCR2 (IL-8RB), while GROα, GROβ, GROγ, and ENA-78 bind to and activate only CXCR2. A chemical lead, which selectively inhibited CXCR2 was discovered by high throughput screening and chemically optimized. SB 225002 (N-(2-hydroxy-4-nitrophenyl)-N′-(2-bromophenyl)urea) is the first reported potent and selective non-peptide inhibitor of a chemokine receptor. It is an antagonist of 125I-IL-8 binding to CXCR2 with an IC50 = 22 nm. SB 225002 showed >150-fold selectivity over CXCR1 and four other 7-TMRs tested. In vitro, SB 225002 potently inhibited human and rabbit neutrophil chemotaxis induced by both IL-8 and GROα. In vivo, SB 225002 selectively blocked IL-8-induced neutrophil margination in rabbits. The present findings suggest that CXCR2 is responsible for neutrophil chemotaxis and margination induced by IL-8. This selective antagonist will be a useful tool compound to define the role of CXCR2 in inflammatory diseases where neutrophils play a major role.

The recruitment of inflammatory cells into sites of tissue damage is a normal physiological response designed to fight infection, remove damaged cells, and stimulate healing. However, the excessive recruitment of such cells often exacerbates tissue damage, slows healing, and in some cases leads to host death. Therefore, inhibition of inflammatory cell recruitment may be an appropriate therapeutic strategy in a number of inflammatory diseases, such as reperfusion injury, arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease. The recruitment of neutrophils from post-capillary venules depends initially upon rolling of neutrophils via the interaction of neutrophil expressed sLex with endothelial expressed E-selectin, followed by attachment through the up-regulation of CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1), and diapedesis via a haptotactic gradient of IL-8 1The abbreviations used are: IL-8, interleukin-8; GRO, growth-related oncogene; ENA-78, epithelial cell-derived neutrophil activating peptide; 7-TMR, seven-transmembrane domain G-protein-coupled receptor; ELR, Glu4-Leu5-Arg6; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HPF, high powered fields; LTB4, leukotriene B4; LTD4, leukotriene D4; fMLP, N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe; C5a, serum complement fragment from C5; SB 225002,N-(2-hydroxy-4-nitrophenyl)-N′-(2-bromophenyl)urea; SK&F 83589,N-(2-hydroxy-4-nitrophenyl)-N′-phenylurea; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; PMN(s), polymorphonuclear cell(s).

The up-regulation of CD11b/CD18 on neutrophils appears to be mediated via IL-8 binding to neutrophil cell surface receptors (2Detmers P.A. Lo S.K. Olsen-Egbert E. Walz A. Baggiolini M. Cohn Z.A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 1155-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). IL-8 is a member of the super family of proinflammatory proteins known as chemokines, which are approximately 8 kDa in size. In human neutrophils, IL-8 binds with similar affinity to two distinct 7-TMRs, CXCR1 (3Holmes W.E. Lee J. Kuang W.J. Rice G.C. Wood W.I. Science. 1991; 253: 1278-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar) and CXCR2 (4Murphy P.M. Tiffany H.L. Science. 1991; 253: 1280-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar), whereas closely related chemokines containing a common amino-terminal Glu4-Leu5-Arg6 (ELR) amino acid sequence, including GROα, GROβ, GROγ, NAP-2, and ENA-78, bind only to CXCR2 (5Hebert C.A. Vitangcol R.V. Baker J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18989-18994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both CXCR1 and CXCR2 are present on the surface of human neutrophils and a subset of T-cells (3Holmes W.E. Lee J. Kuang W.J. Rice G.C. Wood W.I.

In human neutrophils it is unclear whether chemotaxis is mediated by one or both receptors. In vitrostudies using anti-receptor monoclonal antibodies, and cell lines stably expressing CXCR1 and CXCR2, have led to conflicting reports as to the importance of the two receptors in human neutrophil IL-8-induced chemotaxis (9Quan J.M.

Evidence in support of a role for ELR containing CXC chemokines in the pathogenesis of inflammation has resulted from studies manipulating the chemokine system in animal models. Neutralization of IL-8 with a monoclonal antibody in rabbits resulted in the suppression of a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction, which correlated with inhibition of both lymphocyte and neutrophil infiltration in the skin lesions (12Larsen C.G. Thomsen M.K. Gesser B. Thomsen P.D. Deleuran B.W. Nowak J. Skodt V. Thomsen H.K. Deleuran M. Thestrup Pedersen K. Harada A. Matsushima K. Menne T. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2151-2157PubMed Google Scholar). Additional studies with a monoclonal antibody demonstrated potent inhibition of neutrophil recruitment in a rabbit model of endotoxin-induced pleurisy (13Broaddus V.C. Boylan A.M. Hoeffel J.M.

Matsushima K. Nature. 1993; 365: 654-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). In mice, both injection of a monoclonal antibody to MIP-2, the mouse homologue of GRO, or targeted disruption of the IL-8 receptor resulted in decreased neutrophil-mediated inflammatory responses (14Sekido N.

In this paper, the identification of the first potent and selective non-peptide antagonist of a chemokine receptor is described. Using this small molecule antagonist it appears that inhibition of CXCR2 is sufficient to prevent IL-8-induced neutrophil chemotaxis in vitro and sequestration in vivo. SB 225002 should be a useful tool compound to define the pathophysiological role of CXCR2. The two IL-8 receptors were cloned by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Total RNA from human neutrophils was prepared using a GuSCN/CsCl gradient and cDNA synthesis was primed with oligo(dT). Sequence specific primers (CXCR1 (5′-3′), CTAGAATTCCCTGGCCGGTGCTTCAGTTAGACTAAACC, GGTAGCTACTTCCTTATAGAGAGATCTCCTTCG; CXCR2 (5′-3′), GATGAATTCGTCAGGATTTAAGTTTACCTCAAAAATGG, GGAGGACGGATTCACGTCGGGAGATCTTAC) were used to amplify CXCR1 and CXCR2 cDNAs. Receptor sequences were identical to those published (3Holmes W.E. Lee J. Kuang W.J. Rice G.C. Wood W.I. Science. 1991; 253: 1278-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar, 4Murphy P.M. Tiffany H.L. Science. 1991; 253: 1280-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar), except for a conservative Thr to Ser change at residue 276 of CXCR1. These receptors were cloned into a mammalian expression vector containing a cytomegalovirus promoter and dihydrofolate reductase selection. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines expressing either CXCR1 (CHO-CXCR1) or CXCR2 (CHO-CXCR2) were generated by single cell cloning following electroporation of the expression vector and selection by growth in nucleoside-free medium followed by amplification in 80 nmmethotrexate. High expressing clones were identified using125I-IL-8 binding to cells. CHO-CXCR1 and CHO-CXCR2 membranes were prepared according to Kraft and Anderson (18Kraft A.S. Anderson W.B. Nature. 1983; 301: 621-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Assays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates where the reaction mixture contained 1.0 μg/ml membrane protein in 20 mmBis-Tris-propane, pH 8.0, with 1.2 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaCl, and 0.03% CHAPS and SB 225002 (10 mm stock in Me2SO) added at the indicated concentrations, the final Me2SO concentration was <1% under standard binding conditions. Binding was initiated by addition of 0.25 nm125I-IL-8 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 2,200 Ci/mmol). After 1-h incubation at room temperature the plate was harvested using a Tomtec 96-well harvester onto a glass fiber filtermat blocked with 1% polyethyleneimine, 0.5% BSA and washed three times with 25 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris·HCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.03% CHAPS, pH 7.4. The filter was dried, sealed in a sample bag containing 10 ml of Wallac 205 Betaplate liquid scintillation fluid, and counted with a Wallac 1205 Betaplate liquid scintillation counter. Other binding assays were performed according to previously published reports: C5a (19Rollins T.E. Siciliano S. Springer M.S. J. Biol.

A solution of 2-hydroxy-4-nitroaniline (500 mg, 3.24 mmol) in N,N-dimethylformamide (1 ml) was treated with 2-bromophenylisocyanate (3.24 mmol) for 16 h at 80 °C.

Human neutrophils were separated from whole blood of healthy volunteers by the one-step Hypaque-Ficoll method (24Ferrante A. Thong Y.H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1982; 48: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). HL60 cells were differentiated, under incubation conditions, with Me2SO (0.5%) for 3 days. Cells (PMN, HL60, CXCR1-RBL-2H3, or 3ASubE) were loaded with Fura-2AM as described previously (25Berkhout T.A. Sarau H. Moores K. White J.R. Elshourbagy N. Appelbaum E. Reape T.J. Brawner M.

For antagonist studies, SB 225002 (final Me2SO < 0.35%) was added at the indicated concentrations, to 106 cells/ml in Krebs-Ringer-Henseleit buffer, followed 15 s later by agonist at the designated concentration. The maximal calcium concentration attained after agonist stimulation was quantitated as described previously (25Berkhout T.A. Sarau H. Moores K. White J.R. Elshourbagy N. Appelbaum E. Reape T.J. Brawner M. Makwana J. Foley J.J. Schmidt D.B. Imburgia C. McNulty D. Matthews J. O'Donnell K. O'Shannessy D. Scott M. Groot P.H.E. Macphee C. J. Biol.

Neutrophils were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 1 mmCaCl2. Cell motility was determined using a modified Boyden chamber procedure as described (26Bignold L.P. Ferrante A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1987; 96: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For measurement of chemotaxis, lower chambers were filled with 30 μl of IL-8 (1 nm) or GROα (10 nm), the empty upper chambers were lowered into place, and 50 μl of a PMN suspension (5 × 106 cells/ml), without (control) or with SB 225002, was added at the indicated concentrations. SB 225002, dissolved in Me2SO (100%) at 10 mg/ml, was diluted in PBS to the desired concentration; the final Me2SO concentration was <0.1%. Neutrophil migration proceeded for 60 min at 37 °C in the cell incubator, after which the chamber was disassembled. Following fixation (75% methanol) and staining (Diff-Quick) migrated cells were counted in four successive high power fields (HPF). The in vivo neutrophil sequestration model was performed in rabbits as reported previously (27Griswold D.E. Martin L. Ventre J. Meunier L. Perry L. J. Pharmacol. Methods. 1991; 25: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Using sterile techniques, rabbits were surgically fitted with an implanted cannula in the external jugular vein. IL-8 (150 ng/kg/min) or fMLP (5 ng/kg/min) was directly infused into the blood in the absence or presence of SB 225002 (1.39–5.5 μg/kg/min) via the marginal ear vein. Blood samples were withdrawn at 2.5–5-min intervals via the vascular access port in the external jugular. White blood cell counts were determined with a Coulter counter, and differential counts were done using blood smears stained with Diff-Quick. Percent change of PMN count was determined relative to the base-line value. To determine the feasibility of targeting individual IL-8 receptors with non-peptide, low molecular weight antagonists, a high throughput screen was configured using 125I-IL-8 binding to membranes of CHO-CXCR1 or CHO-CXCR2 cells. One compound identified from this screen was SK&F 83589 (Fig. 1 A), which selectively inhibited 125I-IL-8 binding to CHO-CXCR2 with an IC50 of 500 nm. Chemical modification of SK&F 83589 led to SB 225002,N-(2-hydroxy-4-nitrophenyl)-N′-(2-bromophenyl)urea (Fig. 1 B), which inhibited 125I-IL-8 binding to CHO-CXCR2 membranes with an IC50 = 22 nm (Fig. 2). SB 225002, at concentrations up to 3.3 μm (Fig. 2), failed to significantly inhibit the binding of 125I-IL-8 to CHO-CXCR1, or [3H]fMLP, [3H]LTB4, [3H]LTD4, or 125I-C5a to their cognate receptors. SB 225002 was, therefore, at leased >150-fold selective for CXCR2 over the other 7-TMRs tested.Figure 2Competition binding of 125I-IL-8, [3H]FMLP, [3H]LTB4, [3H]LTD4, or 125I-C5a by SB 225002 to appropriate membranes expressing either cloned or primary receptors.

Cross-desensitization studies with Me2SO differentiated HL60 cells indicated that these cells predominantly express CXCR2 (∼80%) with a smaller number of CXCR1 (∼20%) receptors (Fig. 3 A). In these cells, SB 225002 produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of both IL-8- and GROα-mediated calcium mobilization with IC50 values of 8 and 10 nm, respectively (Fig. 3 B). Similarly, in 3ASubE (28Mueller S.G. White J.R. Schraw W.P. Lam V. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8207-8214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) cells stably transfected with CXCR2, SB 225002 dose-dependently inhibited calcium mobilization induced by both GROα and IL-8, with IC50values of 20 and 40 nm, respectively (Fig. 3 B). In contrast to HL60 cells, human neutrophils express equal numbers of CXCR1 and CXCR2 on their cell surface. In these cells, SB 225002 inhibited GROα-, but not IL-8-, stimulated calcium mobilization (IC50 values = 30 nm and >10 μm, respectively, Fig. 3 C). In addition, in RBL-2H3 cells, stably transfected with CXCR1, SB 225002 failed to inhibit calcium mobilization induced by either IL-8 or LTD4(IC50 > 10 μm, Fig. 3 C). The failure of SB 225002 to block IL-8-induced calcium mobilization in human neutrophils, presumably reflects the ability of IL-8 to circumvent the blockade of CXCR2 by activating CXCR1, which was not inhibited by this compound. SB 225002 also demonstrated functional selectivity, since it failed to inhibit calcium mobilization induced by optimal concentrations of LTB4 in PMNs (Fig. 3 C), or RANTES, MIP-1α, or MCP-1 in monocytes (data not shown). Having identified SB 225002 as a potent and selective CXCR2 antagonist, the compound was evaluated for inhibition of human neutrophil chemotaxis in response to maximally effective concentrations of IL-8, GROα, or C5a. Using PMNs from nine individual subjects, SB 225002 inhibited both IL-8 (1 nm)- and GROα (10 nm)-mediated chemotaxis with similar IC50values (20 and 60 nm, respectively) but did not affect chemotaxis induced by 50 nm C5a at concentrations up to 330 nm (Fig. 4). These data provide evidence that in vitro neutrophil chemotaxis is mediated predominantly by CXCR2. Rabbits, like humans, express both IL-8 receptors on their neutrophils (29Suzuki H. Prado G.N. Wilkinson N. Navarro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18263-18266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, this species was utilized to evaluate the in vivo effects of SB 225002. In vitro studies confirmed that SB 225002 is a potent antagonist of rabbit CXCR2, inhibiting rabbit PMN chemotaxis in response to optimal concentrations of human IL-8 or GROα (IC50 values of 30 and 70 nm, respectively). In rabbits, an intravenous infusion of LTB4, or other chemotactic factors, rapidly promotes neutrophil shape change and margination of neutrophils to the microcapillary endothelial cells of the lung (27Griswold D.E. Martin L. Ventre J. Meunier L. Perry L. J. Pharmacol. Methods. 1991; 25: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 30Motosugi H. Graham L. Noblitt T.W. Doyle N.A. Quinlan W.M. Li Y. Doerschuk C.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 963-973PubMed Google Scholar, 31Doerschuk C.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1992; 7: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 32Laterveer L. Lindley I.J. Heemskerk D.P. Camps J.A. Pauwels E.K. Willemze R. Fibbe W.E. Blood. 1996; 87: 781-788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, this is the basis of a useful model to study the initial stages of neutrophil activation and attachment to the endothelium. As seen in Fig. 5,A and B, administration of IL-8 or fMLP resulted in rapid margination of neutrophils (62 and 68%, respectively), which lasted throughout the infusion period (30 min). Co-administration of SB 225002 (Fig. 5, A and B) inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, IL-8-, but not fMLP-, mediated PMN sequestration (Fig. 5 C). The in vitro and in vivo findings presented provide evidence that inhibition of CXCR2 is sufficient to prevent neutrophil margination and chemotaxis mediated by IL-8 and suggests that CXCR1 does not play a major role in neutrophil migration. The functional role of CXCR1 is not clear; however, a recent report, using modified antagonist forms of IL-8 and human neutrophils, demonstrated the importance of CXCR1 in IL-8-mediated superoxide generation and release of granular enzymes (33Jones S.A. Dewald B. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16166-16169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the previous suggestion that CXCR1 on human neutrophils may require higher concentrations of IL-8 for chemotaxis and, therefore, may be involved in neutrophil activities closer to the site of injury and not in the early attachment and extravasation events (10Chuntharapai A. Kim K.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2587-2594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This hypothesis agrees with the finding in rodents, which appear to possess only the CXCR2 homologue, yet retain the ability to localize neutrophils to sites of inflammation (17Cacalano G. Lee J. Kikly K. Ryan A.M. Pitts Meek S. Hultgren B. Wood W.I. Moore M.W. Science. 1994; 265: 682-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). The present study represents the first reported discovery of a potent and selective non-peptide antagonist of a chemokine receptor and the first low molecular weight inhibitor of a large (72 amino acid) agonist 7-TMR interaction. A number of small molecule antagonists have been reported for small peptide receptors, e.g. tachykinin (34Emonds Alt X. Vilain P. Goulaouic P. Proietto V. Van Broeck D. Advenier C. Naline E.

As chemokine receptors are part of the 7-TMR family, which have traditionally been productive targets for drug discovery, it is anticipated that small molecule receptor antagonists may have potential as novel therapeutics. The availability of potent and selective non-peptide antagonists, such as SB 225002, will help define the apparent overlap in activities of the chemokines and their receptors and elucidate their relative importance. In particular, SB 225002 will be an important tool compound to assess the role of IL-8 and CXCR2 in neutrophil recruitment, a process that is thought to be important in several inflammatory diseases, including adult respiratory distress syndrome, chronic bronchitis, and asthma (38Grau G.E.

https://openalex.org/W2022738557,"The growth of the human malaria parasite,Plasmodium falciparum, within its host erythrocyte is reliant on the uptake of a number of essential nutrients from the extracellular medium. One of these is pantothenic acid, a water-soluble vitamin that is a precursor of coenzyme A. In this study we show that normal uninfected erythrocytes are impermeable to pantothenate but that the vitamin is taken up rapidly into malaria-infected cells via a transport pathway that has the characteristics (furosemide sensitivity, nonsaturability) of previously characterized, broad specificity permeation pathways induced by the intracellular parasite in the host cell membrane. The transport of pantothenate therefore constitutes a critical physiological role for these pathways. Inside the parasitized cell pantothenate undergoes phosphorylation, the first step in its conversion to coenzyme A. Parasites within saponin-permeabilized erythrocytes were shown to take up and phosphorylate pantothenate, consistent with the intracellular parasite having both a pantothenate transporter and a pantothenate kinase. Comparisons of the rate of phosphorylation of pantothenate by lysates prepared from uninfected and infected erythrocytes revealed that the pantothenate kinase activity of the P. falciparum trophozoite is some 10-fold higher than that of its host cell and that most, if not all, of the phosphorylation of pantothenate within the malaria-infected cell occurs within the intracellular parasite. These results contrast with those of previous studies in which it was proposed that the avian malaria parasite Plasmodium lophurae lacks pantothenate kinase (as well as the other enzymes for the synthesis of coenzyme A) and is reliant upon the uptake of preformed coenzyme A from the host cell cytosol. The growth of the human malaria parasite,Plasmodium falciparum, within its host erythrocyte is reliant on the uptake of a number of essential nutrients from the extracellular medium. One of these is pantothenic acid, a water-soluble vitamin that is a precursor of coenzyme A.

These results contrast with those of previous studies in which it was proposed that the avian malaria parasite Plasmodium lophurae lacks pantothenate kinase (as well as the other enzymes for the synthesis of coenzyme A) and is reliant upon the uptake of preformed coenzyme A from the host cell cytosol. Malaria is caused by a protozoan parasite (genus Plasmodium) which, during the course of its life cycle, invades the red blood cells of its vertebrate host. This strategy serves to protect the parasite from attack by the immune system of the host; however, it poses significant challenges to the protozoan with regard to obtaining essential nutrients from the plasma. One such compound is pantothenic acid, a water-soluble vitamin (M r 219; Fig. 1) that serves as a precursor of the enzyme cofactor coenzyme A. Early evidence for the importance of exogenous pantothenate in supporting the growth of the intracellular malaria parasite came from the observation that in chickens infected with the avian parasite Plasmodium gallinaceum a dietary deficiency of pantothenate resulted in a marked reduction in the parasitemia (1Brackett S. Waletzky E. Baker M. J. Parasitol. 1946; 32: 453-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Forty years later it was demonstrated in in vitro growth assays that the sustained growth of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparumwithin human erythrocytes is dependent upon there being pantothenate in the extracellular medium (2Divo A.A. Geary T.G. Davis N.L. Jensen J.B. J. Protozool. 1985; 32: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The requirement of the intracellular malaria parasite for an exogenous supply of pantothenate implies that there is a mechanism by which this compound can gain entry into the infected erythrocyte. However, this process has not been characterized. In mammalian tissues, as well as in bacteria, pantothenate is converted to coenzyme A via a series of enzyme-mediated steps, the first of which involves the phosphorylation of pantothenate by pantothenate kinase (3Robishaw J.D. Neely J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: E1-E9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,4Tahiliani A.G. Beinlich C.J. Vitam. Horm. 1991; 46: 165-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In a series of studies with Plasmodium lophurae-infected duck erythrocytes Trager and colleages (5Bennett T.P. Trager W. J. Protozool. 1967; 14: 214-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 6Brohn F.H. Trager W. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2456-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) obtained evidence that all five enzymes involved in the conversion of pantothenic acid to coenzyme A are present in the erythrocyte cytosol of both parasitized and nonparasitized duck red cells but absent from the intracellular parasite. This led to the proposal that in malaria-infected erythrocytes pantothenic acid is converted to coenzyme A within the host cell cytosol, from which it is taken up by the intracellular parasite. Support for this model came from the earlier observation that the survival of erythrocytic stages of P. lophurae removed from their host red cells is favored by the inclusion of coenzyme A (but not by the inclusion of pantothenate) in the extracellular medium (7Trager W. J. Exp. Med. 1952; 96: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 8Trager W. J. Protozool. 1954; 1: 231-237Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). It remains to be established, however, whether the same model is applicable in the case of P. falciparum-infected human erythrocytes. In this study we have investigated the transport and subsequent phosphorylation of pantothenate in human erythrocytes infected in vitro with P. falciparum. Our results indicate that the mature human erythrocyte lacks a functional pantothenate transporter but that the vitamin enters malaria-infected erythrocytes rapidly via the broad specificity, new permeation pathways (NPP) 1The abbreviations used are: NPP, new permeation pathways; PCA, perchloric acid; fl, femtoliters; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O- (thiotriphosphate). induced by the parasite in the infected cell membrane (9Ginsburg H.

Acta. 1995; 1236: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Once inside the parasitized cell, pantothenate undergoes phosphorylation. Data from experiments carried out with saponin-permeabilized parasitized erythrocytes and with cell lysates and extracts indicate that the intraerythrocytic form of P. falciparum has the ability to take up and metabolize pantothenate and that most, if not all, of the phosphorylation of pantothenate within the parasitized erythrocyte occurs within the intracellular parasite. The model proposed previously for P. lophurae-infected avian erythrocytes in which the parasite is wholly reliant upon a supply of preformed coenzyme A from the host red cell cytosol is therefore not applicable in the case of P. falciparum-infected human erythrocytes. Human erythrocytes (type O) infected with either the ITO4 (14Berendt A.R. Simmons D.L. Tansey J. Newbold C.I. Marsh K. Nature. 1989; 341: 57-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) or FAF6 (15Biggs B.-A. Gooze L. Wycherley K.W. Wollish W. Southwell B. Leech J.H. Brown G.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9171-9174Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) lines of P. falciparum were cultured under 1% O2, 3% CO2, 96% N2 in RPMI 1640 culture medium (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK or JRH Biosciences (CSL), Melbourne, Australia) supplemented with HEPES (40 mm), glucose (10 mm), glutamine (2 mm), gentamicin sulfate (25 mg liter−1), and either human serum (8.5% v/v, pooled from different blood donors) or Albumax (0.5% w/v (16Cranmer S.L. Magowan C. Liang J. Coppel R.L. Cooke B.M. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1997; 91: 363-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar)). All experiments with parasitized erythrocytes were carried out using trophozoite-infected cells (approximately 35 h postinvasion), synchronized using a combination of sorbitol hemolysis (17Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2839) Google Scholar) and gelatin flotation (18Pasvol G. Wilson R.J. Smalley M.E. Brown J. Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1978; 72: 87-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). For experiments with intact infected erythrocytes the parasitized cells were concentrated immediately before experimentation by layering 20 ml of infected cell suspension onto 20 ml of Percoll (diluted with 10 × phosphate-buffered saline and water to give a density of 1.090 and an osmolality of 320 mosm (kg H2O)−1) and centrifuged for 10 min at 400 × g. Cells harvested from the top of the Percoll layer (having parasitemias usually in the range of 85–95%) were washed immediately (four times for 5 min each, 600 × g) in saline (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, and 5 mm glucose). In a number of cases cells harvested from beneath the Percoll layer (having parasitemias ≤ 5%) were used as a control to establish that the phenomenon of interest was restricted to the parasitized cells in the malaria-infected cell suspensions. In experiments comparing infected with uninfected erythrocytes, uninfected erythrocytes (from the same donor) were incubated in parallel with P. falciparum-infected erythrocyte cultures, under identical conditions, for at least 24 h before the experiment was carried out. To ensure that the infected and uninfected cell suspensions were strictly comparable the uninfected cells were centrifuged on a Percoll layer (as above) and harvested (from the bottom of the centrifuge tube) before experimentation. Cell counts were made using either an improved Neubauer counting chamber or a Coulter Multisizer. Parasitemia was measured from methanol-fixed Giemsa-stained smears. In a number of experiments parasitized erythrocytes were permeabilized by treatment with saponin, a plant-derived glycoside, using a method modified from that described by Hsiao et al. (19Hsiao L.L. Howard R.J. Aikawa M. Taraschi T.F. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) Saponin interacts with cholesterol in the erythrocyte membrane to form lytic pores, but it leaves the parasite plasma membrane (which lacks cholesterol) intact. Saponin (0.05% w/v) was added to parasitized erythrocytes (hematocrit ∼10%) suspended in RPMI supplemented with glucose (20 mm) and HEPES (25 mm) at 37 °C. The suspension was centrifuged immediately (2,060 × g, 10 min). The supernatant solution (containing hemoglobin and other red cell cytosol components, together with the plasma membranes of uninfected cells) was aspirated, and the resulting pellet was washed (three times for 10 min each, 2,060 × g, 50 ml) and then resuspended in an appropriate volume of RPMI prewarmed to 37 °C. Approximately 92% of the parasites within the permeabilized cells excluded trypan blue, consistent with their plasma membrane remaining intact. Uptake of pantothenate into intact infected and uninfected erythrocytes was monitored using [14C]pantothenate (NEN Life Science Products). All uptake measurements were carried out using cells washed (three times) and resuspended in RPMI 1640 at 37 °C. Cell suspensions were aliquoted into microcentrifuge tubes, and uptake commenced with the addition to the cell suspension of [14C]pantothenate (at 0.1 μCi ml−1), giving a final extracellular pantothenate concentration of 3 μm. The final cell count was, in most experiments, approximately 2 × 108 cells ml−1. At appropriate time intervals aliquots (typically 0.15 ml) of the suspension were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes which, with the exception of those experiments in which the degree of phosphorylation of intracellular solute was determined (see next section), contained ice-cold RPMI (typically 0.45 ml) supplemented with 0.2 mmfurosemide and layered over 0.2 ml of dibutyl phthalate. The tubes were centrifuged immediately (10,000 × g, 50 s) to sediment the cells below the oil, thereby terminating the uptake of radiolabeled solute. After sedimentation of the cells below the oil, the aqueous supernatant solution was aspirated, and the radioactivity remaining on the walls of the tube was removed by rinsing the tubes four times with water. The dibutyl phthalate was aspirated, and then the cell pellet was lysed with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (0.5 ml) and deproteinized by the addition of 5% w/v trichloroacetic acid (0.5 ml) followed by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min). Radioactivity was measured using a scintillation counter. In one series of experiments the transport of [14C]pantothenate into intact parasitized erythrocytes was compared with that of [14C]choline. Uptake of [14C]choline into parasitized erythrocytes at 37 °C was measured using a method similar to that described previously (20Kirk K. Horner H.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cells were suspended in RPMI 1640, and the choline influx rate was estimated from the amount of [14C]choline taken up into infected cells during a 10-min incubation period. In all such experiments [14C]choline was added together with unlabeled choline to give an extracellular choline concentration of 1 mm, sufficient to saturate the endogenous erythrocyte choline transporter and thereby minimize the contribution of this pathway to the influx of radiolabeled choline into the parasitized cells. Choline influx experiments were paired with pantothenate uptake experiments in which the rate of influx of pantothenate was estimated from the amount of [14C]pantothenate taken up during a 20-s incubation by cells suspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1 mm choline. In all experiments the amount of radiolabel trapped in the extracellular space within the cell pellets was estimated using either [14C]inulin or [14C]sucrose (at 0.25 μCi ml−1 and 0.5 μCi ml−1, respectively) as an extracellular space marker. Phosphorylation of pantothenate by intact erythrocytes, saponin-permeabilized cells, and cell lysates was estimated using a combination of ZnSO4 and Ba(OH)2 (Somogyi reagent) which acts to precipitate phosphorylated compounds from solution (21Somogyi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1945; 160: 69-73Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 22Kirk K. Horner H.A. Kirk J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments it was shown that treatment of a solution of [14C]pantothenate with Somogyi reagent had no effect on the concentration of radiolabel in the solution, whereas treatment of a solution of the phosphorylated compound [35S]ATPγS resulted in a 99.5% depletion of radiolabel from the solution (not shown). Perchloric acid extracts of cells or lysates, preincubated with [14C]pantothenate (see below), were neutralized with a 5% w/v KOH solution. The neutralized extract was then divided into two aliquots, each typically 0.4 ml. To one was added 0.25 ml of 150 mm ZnSO4 followed by 0.25 ml of 150 mm Ba(OH)2. This sample (containing a heavy white precipitate) was allowed to stand for 5 min and then was centrifuged (10,000 × g, 15 min). The supernatant was transferred to a scintillation vial for β-counting. The second aliquot was made up to volume with 0.5 ml of H2O and then transferred directly into a scintillation vial for β-counting. The radioactivity in the Somogyi reagent-treated samples provided an estimate of the amount of (nonphosphorylated) [14C]pantothenate present. The difference between this amount and that present in the untreated samples provided an estimate of the amount of phosphorylated radiolabeled solute present. In experiments designed to monitor the phosphorylation of pantothenate taken up into intact cells it was necessary to ensure that all intracellular metabolism ceased at the time of sampling. In experiments of this sort with intact infected erythrocytes, uptake was halted by transferring aliquots of cell suspension to microcentrifuge tubes containing 0.5 ml of dibutyl phthalate layered over 0.5 ml of a 5.6% w/v solution of perchloric acid (PCA) made up in a saturated sucrose solution, then immediately centrifuging the tubes (10,000 × g, 50 s). The cells passed through the oil and into the PCA solution, thereby terminating the uptake, lysing the cells, and precipitating the cell protein. The tubes were washed (four times) as described above, then the dibutyl phthalate was removed. A 0.4-ml aliquot of the extract solution was transferred to a clean microcentrifuge tube where it was neutralized and then divided into two for quantitation of [14C]pantothenate phosphorylation using Somogyi reagent, as described above. Initial attempts to adapt the method described above (in which uptake and metabolism were halted instantaneously by centrifuging the cells through an oil layer into a dense PCA solution) for use with saponin-permeabilized erythrocytes were unsuccessful; the permeabilized cells have a lower density than intact cells and did not enter the PCA solution. In these experiments the metabolism of pantothenate was therefore halted by chilling the samples to 0 °C, at which temperature phosphorylation of pantothenate does not occur (see “Results”). Saponin-permeabilized infected cells suspended in RPMI (at 37 °C) were combined with an equal volume of RPMI containing 0.2 μCi/ml [14C]pantothenate, giving a final activity of 0.1 μCi/ml and a final extracellular pantothenate concentration of 3 μm. At appropriate time intervals 0.3-ml aliquots of the permeabilized cell suspension were transferred into microcentrifuge tubes containing an oil layer (a 5:4 blend of dibutyl phthalate:dioctyl phthalate, having a density of 1.015 g/ml). The tubes were centrifuged immediately (15,800 × g, 2 min) and then chilled to 0 °C in an ice slurry. The supernatant was aspirated and the radioactivity remaining on the walls of the tube removed by rinsing the tubes five times with water. The oil was aspirated and the pellet solubilized in 0.5 ml of 0.5% Triton X-100, then deproteinized by the addition of 5.6% w/v PCA (0.5 ml) followed by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min). A 0.8 ml-aliquot of the supernatant was neutralized with 5% KOH then divided into two for quantitation of [14C]pantothenate phosphorylation using Somogyi reagent, as described above. The presence of pantothenate kinase in the cytosol of normal uninfected erythrocytes and in the host cell and parasite compartments of trophozoite-infected cells was investigated using cell lysates and extracts prepared from: (i) high (>85%) parasitemia-infected cell suspensions; (ii) saponin-permeabilized parasitized erythrocytes; (iii) the erythrocyte cytosol fraction of saponin-permeabilized parasitized erythrocytes; (iv) a suspension of predominantly uninfected cells (3–5% parasitemia) harvested from infected cell suspensions (collected from beneath the Percoll layer used to generate suspensions having high parasitemias); (v) normal, uninfected erythrocytes, cultured in parallel with infected cell suspensions. Phosphorylation of [14C]pantothenate by the various cell extracts was measured under conditions similar to those used by Bennett and Trager (5Bennett T.P. Trager W. J. Protozool. 1967; 14: 214-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) in their original study of pantothenate metabolism by P. lophurae-infected duck erythrocytes. Cell lysates (from intact parasitized erythrocytes, saponin-permeabilized parasitized erythrocytes, uninfected erythrocytes) were prepared by diluting the cell suspension 1/10 in a 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, followed by trituration (10 times) through a 25-gauge needle. The lysates were then centrifuged three times at 2,000 × gfor 30 min, each time transferring the supernatant to another tube. The phosphorylation reaction commenced with the addition of a volume of the lysate supernatant (typically 250 μl) to a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 5 mm ATP, 5 mmMgCl2, and 0.01 μCi/ml [14C]pantothenate (yielding a final pantothenate concentration of 0.2 μm). The solution had a pH of 7.4 and, unless specified otherwise, was prewarmed to 37 °C. At predetermined times, aliquots (200 μl) of the solution were transferred to a microcentrifuge tube containing 0.5 ml of 5.6% w/v PCA to halt the reaction. The tubes were centrifuged at 15,800 × g for 10 min and the resulting supernatant neutralized with 5% w/v KOH and processed as described above for the quantitation of [14C]pantothenate phosphorylation. Rates of phosphorylation were estimated from the slope of the initial, linear portion of the phosphorylation time courses. In all experiments with intact infected and uninfected erythrocytes as well as saponin-permeabilized parasitized erythrocytes, the intracellular water content of the cell pellets was measured, thus enabling an estimate of the cell water volume and the calculation of intracellular solute concentrations. The total water volume of the pellet was estimated using 3H2O content and the extracellular water volume estimated using either [14C]inulin or [14C]sucrose. The3H2O, [14C]inulin, and [14C]sucrose were added to cells (at 0.5 μCi ml−1, 0.25 μCi ml−1, and 0.5 μCi ml−1, respectively) 10 min before sampling. The intracellular water volume was taken to be the difference between the total and extracellular water volumes. The intracellular water volumes of uninfected erythrocytes, trophozoite-infected erythrocytes, and saponin-permeabilized parasitized erythrocytes were estimated as 75 ± 4 fl (n = 16), 75 ± 4 fl (n = 22), and 28 ± 3 fl (n = 12), respectively. In all experiments with suspensions of intact malaria-infected erythrocytes the concentration of [14C]pantothenate within the parasitized cells (as distinct from those in the combined infected and uninfected cells in the cell pellet) was calculated by subtracting the contribution of the uninfected cells to the pellet water volume, based on the parasitemia and on the measured intracellular water volumes of infected and uninfected cells. Radiolabeled pantothenate was taken up rapidly into human erythrocytes infected with the mature (trophozoite) form of the malaria parasite (Fig. 2,open circles). The uptake time course was biphasic. There was an initial rapid influx (rate = 7.6 ± 1.5 μmol/(1012 cells · h); n = 3) lasting 1–2 min, during which time the intracellular concentration of radiolabel rose to 0.5–0.6 that in the external medium. This was followed by a second, slower phase (rate = 1.4 ± 0.3 μmol/(1012 cells · h); n = 3), during which the intracellular concentration of radiolabel increased (linearly with time) to levels well in excess of the extracellular concentration. In contrast with the parasitized cells, there was negligible uptake of the vitamin into normal, uninfected erythrocytes over a 20-min period (Fig. 2, closed circles). The origin of the two components of uptake of pantothenate into parasitized cells was investigated using Somogyi reagent, a combination of ZnSO4 and Ba(OH)2 which, when added to cell extracts, has the effect of precipitating (and thereby removing from solution) any phosphorylated compounds present. The use of this reagent allows an analysis of the relative amounts of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated radiolabeled solute in each sample (22Kirk K. Horner H.A. Kirk J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, the Somogyi reagent had little effect on the amount of radiolabel present in samples prepared from the initial phase of the uptake time course. However, in samples treated with Somogyi reagent the second phase of the uptake time course was abolished. The initial phase therefore corresponds to the transport of pantothenate into the infected cell. The second phase corresponds to the phosphorylation of the vitamin within the cell, presumably by pantothenate kinase, the first step in the conversion of the compound to coenzyme A (3Robishaw J.D. Neely J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: E1-E9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Tahiliani A.G. Beinlich C.J. Vitam. Horm. 1991; 46: 165-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The transport of pantothenate into parasitized erythrocytes was via a pathway that is absent from normal, uninfected erythrocytes (Fig. 2). An obvious candidate for this pathway is the previously characterized NPP, induced by the intracellular parasite in the host cell membrane (9Ginsburg H. Kutner S. Krugliak M. Cabantchik Z.I. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 14: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 10Cabantchik Z.I. Blood Cells. 1990; 16: 421-432PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ginsburg H. Biochem.

The NPP have a very broad substrate specificity, accommodating a diverse variety of low molecular weight solutes. They are blocked by a range of anion transport inhibitors, one of the most effective of which is furosemide (12Kirk K. Horner H.A. Elford B.C. Ellory J.C. Newbold C.I. J. Biol.

A 0.1 mmconcentration of furosemide reduced the rate of transport of pantothenate into the cells by >95% (i.e. from 7.6 ± 1.5 μmol/(1012 cells · h) to 0.3 ± 0.1 μmol/(1012 cells · h); n = 3). Under these conditions the transport rate decreased to below the normal rate of phosphorylation of the compound (i.e. 1.4 ± 0.3 μmol/(1012 cells · h)). Thus, in the presence of a transport inhibitor the flux of pantothenate into the cell became rate-limiting for the utilization of this essential vitamin by the parasitized cell. The inset to Fig. 4 compares the dose-response curve for the inhibition by furosemide of the transport of pantothenate into parasitized cells with that for inhibition of the transport of choline, a monovalent cation that has been demonstrated previously to enter infected erythrocytes via the NPP (12Kirk K. Horner H.A. Elford B.C. Ellory J.C. Newbold C.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3339-3347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kirk K. Horner H.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The two curves were superimposable with IC50 values (i.e. the concentration at which the inhibitory effect is half-maximal) of approximately 3 μm. The data are consistent with pantothenate and choline entering the parasitized cell via a common pathway. When the uptake of [14C]pantothenate into infected cells was measured in the presence of an increased (10 mm) concentration of (unlabeled) pantothenate the initial rate of uptake of radiolabeled substrate was unaffected (Fig. 5), indicating that the influx pathway did not saturate at this substrate concentration. By contrast, the second phase of the radiolabel uptake time course was abolished, consistent with saturation of pantothenate kinase by the unlabeled solute. The data presented thus far provide clear evidence for the entry of pantothenate into malaria-infected erythrocytes via a furosemide-sensitive, nonsaturable pathway and its subsequent phosphorylation (a saturable process) within the parasitized cell. The question remains, however, of where in the cell the phosphorylation occurs. In early work with duck erythrocytes infected with P. lophurae it was found that pantothenate kinase (5Bennett T.P. Trager W. J. Protozool. 1967; 14: 214-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), as well as the other enzymes involved in the conversion of pantothenate to coenzyme A (6Brohn F.H. Trager W. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2456-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), were present in the cytosol of the duck erythrocyte but absent from the parasite, prompting the suggestion that conversion of pantothenate to coenzyme A takes place exclusively in the host cell cytosol. Quite different results were obtained here with P. falciparum. As shown in Fig. 6, parasites within saponin-permeabilized infected erythrocytes, lacking the enzymes of the red cell cytosol, accumulated radiolabeled pantothenate (in a predominantly phosphorylated form) from the medium. The maximal rate of accumulation of pantothenate by the parasites in this preparation, measured over the initial 30 min of the uptake time course, was 1.3 ± 0.3 μmol/(1012 cells · h) (n = 3). This value was not significantly different from the rate of accumulation of pantothenate by intact infected erythrocytes during the second phase of the biphasic uptake time course (i.e. 1.4 ± 0.3 μmol/(1012 cells · h);p = 0.74, unpaired t test). The results obtained with saponin-permeabilized cells indicate that the intraerythrocytic form of P. falciparumhas both a pathway for the transport of pantothenate across its plasma membrane and a pantothenate kinase. However, they do not necessarily identify the intracellular parasite as the site of phosphorylation of pantothenate within the intact parasitized cell. It remains possible that although the parasite possesses enzymes capable of phosphorylating pantothenate at the rate observed in intact parasitized erythrocytes, phosphorylation of pantothenate occurs primarily within the host erythrocyte cytosol, with the parasite taking up either fully formed coenzyme A or one of its phosphorylated precursors. This possibility was addressed by comparing the relative [14C]pantothenate phosphorylation activities associated with the parasite and host cell compartments of parasitized cells, as well as that of uninfected erythrocytes, using a series of cell lysates and extracts (Fig. 7). The rate of phosphorylation by lysates of intact, parasitized cell suspensions (85–96% parasitemia) ranged from 2.5 to 3.8 μmol/(1012 cells · h), some 8–12-fold higher than that in lysates of normal uninfected erythrocytes (0.32 ± 0.07 μmol/(1012 cells · h); n = 5). Lysates prepared from predominantly uninfected cells (3–5% parasitemia) isolated from the infected cell cultures showed a low phosphorylation activity (0.38 ± 0.06 μmol/(1012 cells · h);n = 5), similar to that of lysates from normal uninfected cells. The mean phosphorylation activity of lysates of the infected cells in the parasitized cell suspension was calculated to be 3.5 ± 0.2 μmol/(1012 cells · h); Fig. 7), 11 times higher than that in the uninfected cells (p = 0.0003; paired t test). It should be noted that the rate of phosphorylation of pantothenate by the lysates of the parasitized cells was some 2.5 times higher than the rate of phosphorylation of pantothenate within either intact or saponin-permeabilized parasitized erythrocytes. This is despite the fact that the concentration of pantothenate added to the lysates (0.2 μm) was 15-fold less than that in the medium in which the intact or saponin-permeabilized cells were suspended (3 μm). The concentration of (nonphosphorylated) pantothenate within the parasitized erythrocyte is less than that in the external medium (Fig. 3), and the concentration within the parasite itself may well have been substantially less than that in the extracellular solution. However, it is unlikely to have been below the 0.2 μm used in the lysate experiments, and the explanation for the discrepancy in the phosphorylation rates in the two types of experiment probably relates to the drastically different conditions in the lysate compared with the parasite cytosol. In particular, the cell lysates were supplemented with supraphysiological levels of ATP (5 mm) as well as having subphysiological concentrations of any endogenous regulatory (inhibitory) factors that might be present within the parasite. Lysates prepared from saponin-permeabilized parasitized erythrocytes (lacking the enzymes of the host red cell cytosol) demonstrated approximately 85% of the phosphorylation activity of those from intact parasitized cells (Fig. 7). Extracts of the host cell cytosol compartment of parasitized erythrocytes (obtained by saponin-permeabilization of high parasitemia-infected cell suspensions) phosphorylated [14C]pantothenate at a rate slightly (though not significantly) lower than uninfected erythrocyte extracts prepared by saponin lysis (Fig. 7). From these results it is clear that the majority of the pantothenate phosphorylation activity within the malaria-infected cells resides within the intracellular parasite. The host erythrocyte cytosol does have a pantothenate kinase activity, but it is more than 10-fold lower than that of the parasite. The theoretical possibility that the relatively low rate of phosphorylation of [14C]pantothenate by uninfected erythrocyte lysates was caused not by the red cell having low levels of the relevant kinase but, instead, by the presence of inhibitory factors (e.g. unlabeled pantothenate) in the uninfected erythrocyte cytosol is ruled out by the finding that the rate of phosphorylation of [14C]pantothenate measured in a sample in which extracts of saponin-permeabilized parasitized erythrocytes and normal uninfected erythrocytes were combined was similar to (and not significantly different from) the sum of the activities measured in each of the extracts alone (not shown). The phosphorylation of [14C]pantothenate by extracts of saponin-permeabilized erythrocytes was inhibited completely by the omission of exogenous ATP from the incubation mixture, by placing the extracts in a boiling water bath for 10 min before the incubation, or by carrying out the incubation at 0 °C (not shown). The latter findings are consistent with the phosphorylation activity being enzyme-mediated. Pantothenic acid is one of relatively few low molecular weight solutes for which the intraerythrocytic malaria parasite P. falciparum has an absolute extracellular requirement. Omission of pantothenic acid from the external medium results in cessation of parasite growth (2Divo A.A. Geary T.G. Davis N.L. Jensen J.B. J. Protozool. 1985; 32: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The pathways involved in the transport and metabolism of this essential vitamin in parasitized cells therefore hold significant interest as chemotherapeutic targets. In this study it was shown that pantothenate is impermeant to normal uninfected erythrocytes but enters malaria-infected erythrocytes rapidly via a pathway showing the characteristics (furosemide sensitivity, nonsaturability) of the NPP induced by the intracellular parasite in the host erythrocyte membrane. The NPP have been described previously in some detail (9Ginsburg H. Kutner S. Krugliak M. Cabantchik Z.I. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 14: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 10Cabantchik Z.I. Blood Cells. 1990; 16: 421-432PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ginsburg H. Biochem.

They have been shown to be permeable to a very wide range of low molecular weight solutes, including a number of nutrients required by the intracellular parasite. However, most of the latter compounds (e.g. glucose, nucleosides, and those amino acids either absent from or present at very low levels in the host cell hemoglobin) gain entry into the malaria-infected erythrocyte via endogenous host cell transporters; there are few, if any, essential nutrients for which there is clear evidence that their transport via the NPP plays a physiological role in the parasitized cell. In identifying the NPP as the sole route of entry of the essential vitamin, pantothenate, into the malaria-infected erythrocyte the present study provides evidence for a critical physiological role for the NPP. Furthermore, the finding that in the presence of furosemide the transport of the vitamin into the infected cell becomes rate-limiting for pantothenic acid utilization (Fig. 4) focuses attention on the possibility that the NPP may offer a suitable target for chemotherapeutic attack (20Kirk K. Horner H.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Once inside the infected erythrocyte, pantothenate is phosphorylated, the first step in its conversion to coenzyme A. Early work with P. lophurae-infected duck erythrocytes led to the proposal that pantothenate kinase (5Bennett T.P. Trager W. J. Protozool. 1967; 14: 214-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and the other enzymes involved in the conversion of pantothenate to coenzyme A (6Brohn F.H. Trager W. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2456-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) were located exclusively within the host erythrocyte compartment. However this is not the case in P. falciparum-infected human erythrocytes. Experiments with saponin-permeabilized parasitized erythrocytes demonstrated that the intracellular parasite has the ability to take up pantothenate from the extracellular solution (indicative of the presence of a pantothenate transport pathway at the parasite surface) and to phosphorylate it (indicative of the presence of a pantothenate kinase within the parasite). The rate of accumulation of the phosphorylated form of pantothenate by parasites in saponin-permeabilized parasitized erythrocytes (1.3 ± 0.3 μmol/(1012 cells · h)) was similar to that measured in intact parasitized erythrocytes (1.4 ± 0.3 μmol/(1012 cells · h)). There is therefore sufficient activity within the parasite to account for most, if not all, of the phosphorylation activity observed within the intact infected erythrocyte. Experiments with cell extracts (carried out under conditions similar to those used in the earlier study of parasitized avian erythrocytes) revealed that although the host erythrocyte cytosol did contain a pantothenate kinase activity it was more than 10-fold less than that of the intracellular parasite and therefore insufficient to account for the phosphorylation activity observed in intact parasitized erythrocytes. Together, these results allow the conclusion that in P. falciparum-infected human erythrocytes most, if not all, of the phosphorylation of pantothenate, en route to coenzyme A, occurs within the intracellular parasite. The data do not permit the determination of whether the phosphorylation of pantothenate within the intact parasitized cell is mediated exclusively by the parasite (as might be the case if the NPP provide the pantothenate with a direct route to the parasite, without it passing through the erythrocyte cytosol (23Lauer S.A. Rathod P.K. Ghori N. Haldar K. Science. 1997; 276: 1122-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar)) or whether there is a minor contribution from the enzymes present in the host cell cytosol (as might be the case if, as has traditionally been assumed, solutes entering the cell via the NPP enter the red cell cytosol, from where they are taken up by the parasite (24Gero A.M. Kirk K. Parasitol. Today. 1994; 10: 395-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar)). Nevertheless, they do show conclusively that the model postulated for parasitized avian erythrocytes, in which the parasite is dependent upon the surrounding host cell cytosol for a supply of preformed coenzyme A is not applicable to P. falciparum-infected human erythrocytes. Pantothenate is impermeant to normal human erythrocytes but is taken up rapidly into P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes via NPP induced by the parasite in the host cell membrane. Once inside the parasitized cell the pantothenate is phosphorylated, the first step in its conversion to coenzyme A. Under normal conditions the rate of transport of pantothenate into the infected cell is much faster than its subsequent phosphorylation. However, in the presence of an inhibitor of the NPP the initial transport step becomes rate-limiting for pantothenate utilization. Although the red cell cytosol does show low levels of pantothenate kinase activity, the majority of the phosphorylation occurs within the intracellular parasite. The enzymes involved are yet to be identified at a molecular level but these, together with the pantothenate transport pathways in both the parasite and host cell membranes, hold significant promise as targets for chemotherapeutic attack."
https://openalex.org/W2037865420,"It is generally believed that the vascular endothelium serves as an inflammatory barrier by providing a nonadherent surface to leukocytes. Here, we report that Fas ligand (FasL) is expressed on vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and that it may function to actively inhibit leukocyte extravasation. TNFα downregulates FasL expression with an accompanying decrease in EC cytotoxicity toward co-cultured Fas-bearing cells. Local administration of TNFα to arteries downregulates endothelial FasL expression and induces mononuclear cell infiltration. Constitutive FasL expression markedly attenuates TNFα-induced cell infiltration and adherent mononuclear cells undergo apoptosis under these conditions. These findings suggest that endothelial FasL expression can negatively regulate leukocyte extravasation."

Sugar repression of gene expression is a fundamental and ubiquitous regulatory system for adjusting to changes in nutrient availability in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. In microorganisms, glucose or other rapidly metabolizable carbon sources repress the expression of genes that code for enzymes related to the metabolism of other carbon sources. Our understanding of the mechanisms of sugar repression has been based largely on studies of microorganisms. In the case of Escherichia coli, a model to explain at the molecular level, the mechanism of sugar repression has been determined (1Saier Jr., M.H. New Biol. 1991; 3: 1137-1147PubMed Google Scholar, 2Saier Jr., M.H. Chauvaux S. Deutscher J. Reizer J. Ye J.-J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The mechanism of glucose repression in yeast is more complicated and is less understood than it is in E. coli (3Carlson M. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4873-4877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Entian K-D. Barnett J.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 506-510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 5Gancedo J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 297-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Studies using Saccharomyces cerevisiaemutants have revealed many of the components involved in the response to carbon catabolite repression (5Gancedo J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 297-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), but it is still unclear how all of these components interact to regulate transcription. A universal signaling pathway which leads to the regulation of all glucose-repressible genes has yet to be determined.As in microorganisms, sugar repression of gene expression also allows plant cells to cope effectively with changes in the carbon sources present in their environment. However, in multicellular plants, feedback repression by excess sugars provides an additional mechanism for maintaining an economical balance between supply (source) and demand (sink) for carbohydrate allocation and utilization among tissues and organs (6Sheen J. Photosynth. Res. 1994; 39: 427-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 7Thomas B.R. Rodriguez R.L. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 1235-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 8Yu S.-M.

Despite the fact that sugar repression of gene expression is likely a central control mechanism mediating energy homeostasis and carbohydrate distribution in plants, the molecular mechanism of sugar feedback regulation remains elusive. For example, sugar feedback regulation of genes involved in photosynthesis (9Sheen J. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 1027-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) and carbohydrate metabolism (10Chan M.-T. Chao Y.-C. Yu S.-M. J. Biol.

Lee H.-T. Yu S.-M. Plant J. 1994; 5: 655-664Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar) has been shown to act at the level of gene transcription. A conserved glucose-sensing mechanism, via the action of hexokinase, has been observed between plants and microorganisms (13Graham I.A. Denby K.J. Leaver C.J. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 14Jang J.-C. Sheen J. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1665-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 15Jang J.-C. Leon P. Zhou L. Sheen J. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism which connects the sensing and transmission of sugar signals and the repression of gene transcription in plants is mostly unknown.The sugar-dependent repression of α-amylase gene expression provides an ideal model for studies on the molecular mechanisms that mediate glucose repression in plants. α-Amylases are endo-amylolytic enzymes which catalyze the hydrolysis of α1,4-linked glucose polymers that play an important role in the degradation of starch and glycogen in higher plants, animals, and many microorganisms. α-Amylases in plants are recognized as essential enzymes whose major function is hydrolysis of starch stored in the endosperm during germination of cereal grains. Expression of α-amylase genes in rice is found under different modes of tissue-specific regulation: in the embryo of germinating seeds and in cultured suspension cells, expression is activated by sugar deprivation and repressed by sugar provision (8Yu S.-M.

By using α-amylase gene-specific DNA fragments and nuclear run-on transcription analysis, transcription of eight α-amylase genes was shown to increase in response to sucrose starvation (27Sheu J.-J.

A positive correlation between the transcription rates and the steady-state mRNA levels suggests that transcriptional regulation plays an important role in the differential expression of individual α-amylase genes. To date, studies on the transcriptional regulation of α-amylase gene expression in plants have mostly focused on the hormonal regulation in germinating cereal grains (28Gubler F. Jacobsen J.V.

Since sugars regulate the expression of α-amylase genes in germinating seeds as well as in cultured suspension cells, studies on the mechanism of sugar feedback regulation using rice suspension cells as a model system may lead us to a better understanding of the mechanisms controlling carbohydrate metabolism in higher plants. We chose αAmy3as a model gene for this study because it constitutes approximately 60% of total α-amylase mRNAs in cells starved for sucrose (27Sheu J.-J. Yu T.-S. Tong W.-F. Yu S.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26998-27004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and its expression in germinating embryo is regulated by sugars (8Yu S.-M. Lee Y.-C. Fang S.-C.

The literature has revealed that, in the case of studying regulation by environmental and physiological cues, results obtained from transient assays often rapidly and efficiently provide important information for further studies and reflect the in vivo situation in planta. For example, studies on auxin (34Liu Z.-B. Ulmasov T. Shi X. Hagen G. Guilfoyle T.J. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 645-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 35Ulmasov T. Liu Z.-B. Hagen G.

By conducting loss-of-function, gain-of-function, and linker-scan mutation analyses, we defined the minimal sequence in the αAmy3 promoter that drives high level glucose starvation-induced expression. This minimal sequence served as a transcriptional enhancer and converted a sugar-insensitive promoter into a sugar-sensitive promoter. We also identified three essential motifs, the GC box, the G box, and the TATCCA element, that form the sugar response complex and act cooperatively in controlling αAmy3 expression. Finally, we demonstrated that nuclear proteins from rice suspension cells bind to the TATCCA element in a sequence-specific and sugar-dependent manner. To our knowledge, this is the first identification of the functional sugar response elements and the existence of interacting trans-acting factors for sugar repressible genes in plants. Sugar repression of gene expression is a fundamental and ubiquitous regulatory system for adjusting to changes in nutrient availability in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. In microorganisms, glucose or other rapidly metabolizable carbon sources repress the expression of genes that code for enzymes related to the metabolism of other carbon sources. Our understanding of the mechanisms of sugar repression has been based largely on studies of microorganisms. In the case of Escherichia coli, a model to explain at the molecular level, the mechanism of sugar repression has been determined (1Saier Jr., M.H. New Biol. 1991; 3: 1137-1147PubMed Google Scholar, 2Saier Jr., M.H. Chauvaux S. Deutscher J. Reizer J. Ye J.-J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The mechanism of glucose repression in yeast is more complicated and is less understood than it is in E. coli (3Carlson M. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4873-4877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Entian K-D. Barnett J.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 506-510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 5Gancedo J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 297-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Studies using Saccharomyces cerevisiaemutants have revealed many of the components involved in the response to carbon catabolite repression (5Gancedo J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 297-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), but it is still unclear how all of these components interact to regulate transcription. A universal signaling pathway which leads to the regulation of all glucose-repressible genes has yet to be determined. As in microorganisms, sugar repression of gene expression also allows plant cells to cope effectively with changes in the carbon sources present in their environment. However, in multicellular plants, feedback repression by excess sugars provides an additional mechanism for maintaining an economical balance between supply (source) and demand (sink) for carbohydrate allocation and utilization among tissues and organs (6Sheen J. Photosynth. Res. 1994; 39: 427-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 7Thomas B.R. Rodriguez R.L. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 1235-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 8Yu S.-M.

Despite the fact that sugar repression of gene expression is likely a central control mechanism mediating energy homeostasis and carbohydrate distribution in plants, the molecular mechanism of sugar feedback regulation remains elusive. For example, sugar feedback regulation of genes involved in photosynthesis (9Sheen J. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 1027-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) and carbohydrate metabolism (10Chan M.-T. Chao Y.-C. Yu S.-M. J. Biol.

Lee H.-T. Yu S.-M. Plant J. 1994; 5: 655-664Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar) has been shown to act at the level of gene transcription. A conserved glucose-sensing mechanism, via the action of hexokinase, has been observed between plants and microorganisms (13Graham I.A. Denby K.J. Leaver C.J. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 14Jang J.-C. Sheen J. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1665-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 15Jang J.-C. Leon P. Zhou L. Sheen J. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism which connects the sensing and transmission of sugar signals and the repression of gene transcription in plants is mostly unknown. The sugar-dependent repression of α-amylase gene expression provides an ideal model for studies on the molecular mechanisms that mediate glucose repression in plants. α-Amylases are endo-amylolytic enzymes which catalyze the hydrolysis of α1,4-linked glucose polymers that play an important role in the degradation of starch and glycogen in higher plants, animals, and many microorganisms. α-Amylases in plants are recognized as essential enzymes whose major function is hydrolysis of starch stored in the endosperm during germination of cereal grains. Expression of α-amylase genes in rice is found under different modes of tissue-specific regulation: in the embryo of germinating seeds and in cultured suspension cells, expression is activated by sugar deprivation and repressed by sugar provision (8Yu S.-M.

Gene (Amst.). 1992; 122: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); in the endosperm of germinating seeds, expression is activated by gibberellic acid and repressed by abscisic acid and osmotic stress (8Yu S.-M.

Shimamoto K. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Studies with rice suspension cells have shown that α-amylase expression, carbohydrate metabolism, and vacuolar autophagy are coordinately regulated by sucrose levels in the medium (20Chen M.-H. Liu L.-F. Chen Y.-R. Wu H.-K. Yu S.-M. Plant J. 1994; 6: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Both the transcription rate and mRNA stability of α-amylase genes in cells increase in response to sucrose depletion in the culture medium (12Sheu J.-J. Jan S.-P. Lee H.-T. Yu S.-M. Plant J. 1994; 5: 655-664Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar).

Nakamura K. Kuraya K. Tanaba O. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1961; 25: 1-6Google Scholar) and Drosophila melanogaster (24Benkel B.F. Hickey D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1337-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and the mechanism was shown to involve transcriptional control (25Magoulas C. Bally-Cuif L. Loverre-Chyurlia A. Benkel B. Kickey D.

Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 1235-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). By using α-amylase gene-specific DNA fragments and nuclear run-on transcription analysis, transcription of eight α-amylase genes was shown to increase in response to sucrose starvation (27Sheu J.-J. Yu T.-S. Tong W.-F. Yu S.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26998-27004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A positive correlation between the transcription rates and the steady-state mRNA levels suggests that transcriptional regulation plays an important role in the differential expression of individual α-amylase genes. To date, studies on the transcriptional regulation of α-amylase gene expression in plants have mostly focused on the hormonal regulation in germinating cereal grains (28Gubler F. Jacobsen J.V.

Since sugars regulate the expression of α-amylase genes in germinating seeds as well as in cultured suspension cells, studies on the mechanism of sugar feedback regulation using rice suspension cells as a model system may lead us to a better understanding of the mechanisms controlling carbohydrate metabolism in higher plants. We chose αAmy3as a model gene for this study because it constitutes approximately 60% of total α-amylase mRNAs in cells starved for sucrose (27Sheu J.-J. Yu T.-S. Tong W.-F. Yu S.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26998-27004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and its expression in germinating embryo is regulated by sugars (8Yu S.-M. Lee Y.-C. Fang S.-C.

Ectopic overexpression of the short prodomain caspases-3 and -6 precursors in mammalian cells does not induce apoptosis. This is due to their inability to undergo autocatalytic processing/activation and suggests that they depend on the long prodomain caspases for activation. To investigate directly the apoptotic activity of these two caspases in vivo, we engineered constitutively active recombinant caspases-3 and -6 precursors. This was achieved by making contiguous precursor caspases-3 and -6 molecules, which have their small subunits preceding their large subunits. Unlike their wild type counterparts, these recombinant molecules were capable of autocatalytic processing in an in vitro translation reaction, suggesting that they are catalytically active. They were also capable of autoprocessing and inducing apoptosis in vivo independent of the upstream caspases. Furthermore, their autocatalytic and apoptotic activities were inhibited by the pancaspase inhibitor z-VAD-fluoromethylketone, but not by CrmA or Bcl-2, thus directly demonstrating that the targets of inhibition of apoptosis by CrmA and Bcl-2 are upstream of caspases-3 and -6. Since caspases-3 and -6 are the most downstream executioners of apoptosis, the constitutively active versions of these caspases could be used at very low concentrations in gene therapy model systems to induce apoptosis in target tissues or tumors.

It has been nearly 6 years since the discovery of interleukin 1β-converting enzyme or ICE (1Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M.

So far 10 members of the human caspase family have been reported in the literature. Among these at least seven participate in the initiation and execution of apoptosis or programmed cell death, and the remaining three, in particular caspase-1 and probably caspases-4 and -5, are involved in production of the proinflammatory cytokines (4Nicholson W.D.

Caspases share several common features among them, in that they are synthesized as catalytically inactive zymogens that are generally activated by cleavages after specific internal Asp residues present in interdomain linkers and the ability to cleave their substrates after Asp residues. As a result certain mature active caspases, in particular those that are derived from the long prodomain caspases, can process and activate their own and other inactive caspase zymogens (7Fernandes-Alnemri T. Armstrong R. Krebs J. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Bullrich F. Fritz L. Trapani J.A. Tomaselli K.J. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This sequential activation process is usually specific and is determined by the caspase preference toward the target P4-P1 subsite, which is present in the interdomain linker between the large and small subunits of the caspase zymogen. Interestingly, the short prodomain caspases contain target sites that are preferred by the long prodomain caspases (9Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M.

This led to the suggestion that caspases operate in a hierarchical relationship within an intracellular network of proteolytic signaling pathways or cascades (5Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M.

Thus, implementation of the apoptotic program is now believed to require the participation of at least two classes of caspases, the initiator and the executioner caspases. Three initiator or apical caspases, namely caspases-2, -8, and -10, have been implicated in apoptotic pathways triggered by the death receptors of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family (10Nagata S.

Upon ligand-induced trimerization of the death receptors, the initiator caspases are recruited through their long N-terminal prodomain by specialized adaptor molecules to form the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) 1The abbreviations used are: DISC, death-inducing signaling complex; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; SS, small subunit; LS, large subunit; DEVD-CHO, DEVD-aldehyde; DEVD-AMC, DEVD-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; z-VAD-fmk, z-VAD-fluoromethylketone.

For example, caspase-8 and probably caspase-10 are recruited to the DISC by the adaptor molecule FADD/Mort1, whereas caspase-2 is recruited by CRADD/RAIDD and RIP (10Nagata S.

Because of the trimeric nature of the DISC, three caspase molecules are brought in close proximity to one another, which is believed to facilitate their activation by autocatalytic processing (15Yang X. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 319-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 16Muzio M. Stockwell B.R. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2926-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Caspase-9, another long prodomain initiator caspase, is activated by binding to Apaf-1 (17Li P.

The exact mechanism by which Apaf-1 triggers activation of caspase-9 has not been defined. However, the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, a prerequisite for formation of the Apaf-1-caspase-9-cytochrome c complex, is believed to be triggered by many apoptotic stimuli, including those initiated by other initiator caspases (18Reed J.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 559-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). The downstream or executioner caspases, namely caspases-3, -6, and -7, lack the long prodomain that is required for recruitment to caspase activation complexes such as the DISC or Apaf-1. Thus these caspases remain dormant until the initiator caspases activate them by direct proteolysis (7Fernandes-Alnemri T. Armstrong R. Krebs J. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Bullrich F. Fritz L.

This is because, once these caspases are activated, they rapidly dismantle important structural and regulatory components of the cell, leading to the characteristic apoptotic phenotype observed in cells undergoing apoptosis (4Nicholson W.D.

In order to study the role of the downstream caspases in apoptosis independent of the initiator caspases, it is necessary to generate constitutively active downstream caspases. Here, we describe the engineering of two recombinant constitutively active caspases-3 and -6 precursors by switching the order of their two subunits, such that the engineered molecule mimicked a structure presented by the processed wild type active molecule. These caspases were designated reversed-caspases-3 and -6 (rev-caspases-3 and -6). Unlike their wild type counterparts, the rev-caspases were capable of autocatalytic processing in an in vitro translation reaction and rapid induction of apoptosis in vivo. The potential applications of these rev-caspases are discussed. cDNAs encoding rev-caspases-3 and -6 precursors were generated by PCR. The large and small subunits of caspase-3 were amplified with the following primers using the caspase-3 cDNA as a template: LS-forward, ATGGAGAACACTGAAAACTCAG; LS-reverse, GTCATCATCAACACCTCAGTCT; SS-forward, GGATCCATGATTGAGACAGACAGTGG; SS-reverse, ATCAACTTCATCGTGATAAAAATAGAGTTC. The PCR products were cloned separately into the SmaI site of pBluescript KS+. The small subunit was then excised from KS+-vector with BamHI and inserted into the BamHI site of the second KS+-vector, which contains the large subunit. This places the small subunit in-frame 5′ to the large subunit. Rev-caspase-6 was amplified and cloned in the KS+-vector in a similar way. The following PCR primers were used with caspase-6-His6 cDNA as a template: LS-forward, ATGAGCTCGGCCTCGGGG; LS-reverse, TTAATCTACTACATCCAAAGG; SS-forward, GGATCCATGGTAGAAATAGATGCAGCCTCCGTTTAC; SS-reverse, ATCAATTTCAACGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGC. To express the rev-caspases in bacteria (BL21-DE3), their cDNAs were excised with BamHI/XhoI and subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pET28a in-frame with the His6-T7-tag of this vector. General computational methods used in modeling of rev-caspase-3 were performed as described previously (19Luo Z. Butcher D.J. Huang Z. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1039-1045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To express the rev-caspases in mammalian cells and assay their apoptotic activity, they were amplified with the T7-tag primer and the LS-reverse primers using the pET28a constructs as templates and subcloned into the mammalian double expression vector pRSC-LacZ (11MacFarlane M.

This vector allows the expression of lacZunder the Rous sarcoma virus promoter and the test cDNA under the cytomegalovirus promoter. It also allows in vitrotranscription of the test cDNA from the T7-promoter. To assay for apoptosis, MCF-7 or 293 cells were transfected with the pRSC-LacZ constructs in the presence or absence of different apoptosis inhibitors. The cells were stained with β-galactosidase 30 h after transfection and examined for morphological signs of apoptosis. The percentage of round blue apoptotic cells (mean ± S.D.) were represented as a function of total blue cells under each condition (n ≥ 3). Wild type and Rev-caspases were in vitro translated in the presence of [35S]methionine in rabbit reticulocyte lysate with a T7-RNA polymerase-coupled TNT kit (Promega), using the pRSC-LacZ or pET28a constructs as templates according to the manufacturer's recommendations. To control their death-inducing activity, caspases are synthesized as harmless inactive single chain precursor molecules. It is necessary to cleave the caspase precursor at conserved aspartate processing sites located 12–28 amino acids C-terminal to the active site Cys to produce the active zymogen, which is a heterodimer made of the two cleavage products. In this heterodimer, the SS is derived from the C terminus of the caspase precursor, and the LS is derived from the N-terminal region. Based on the three-dimensional structure of caspase-3 (CPP32) (20Rotonda J. Nicholson D.W. Fazil K.M. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Labelle M. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Ruel R. Vaillancourt J.P.

Grütter M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6539-6547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), the C terminus of the LS and the N terminus of the SS must be made free in order for the two subunits to interdigitate and fold properly into the final active conformation. In this conformation, the N terminus of the SS and the C terminus of the LS are separated far from each other, whereas the N terminus of the LS and the C terminus of the SS are brought closer to each other (Fig. 1 A). That could explain why a contiguous caspase precursor molecule cannot freely fold into an active zymogen without cleavage between the two subunits. Based on these observations we reasoned that a contiguous molecule in which the C terminus of the LS and the N terminus of the SS are free, whereas the N terminus of the LS and the C terminus of the SS are physically linked, would enable spontaneous folding into a fully active conformation that simulates the three-dimensional structure of the processed wild type molecule (Fig. 1 B). To test this hypothesis we chose the downstream caspases-3 and -6 because of their inability to undergo autocatalytic processing or induce apoptosis on their own when overexpressed in mammalian cells. We engineered contiguous caspases-3 and -6 molecules in which the SS was fused in-frame N-terminal to the LS, and a cleavage site (DEVDG in the case of caspase-3; VEIDA in the case of caspase-6) was introduced between the two subunits (Fig. 1, B and C). Unlike their wild type counterparts, these engineered “reversed” molecules (rev-caspases-3 and -6) now have their SS preceding their LS. Presentation of the subunits in this order should result in spontaneous folding into a structure similar to the native active caspase-3 structure (Fig. 1 A). This hypothesis was examined by molecular modeling of the rev-caspase-3 based on the three-dimensional structure of caspase-3 (20Rotonda J. Nicholson D.W. Fazil K.M. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Labelle M. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Ruel R. Vaillancourt J.P. Thornberry N.A. Becker J.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 21Mittl P.R.E. Di Marco S. Krebs J.F.

Both high temperature (900 K) and room temperature (300 K) dynamic simulation of 100 ps suggested that the linker loop between the SS and the LS does not change the original structure of the LS and SS, and the new molecule may keep the same structure as the native protein (Fig. 1 B). As expected, and unlike the wild type caspases-3 and -6, rev-caspases-3 and -6 were able to undergo autocatalytic processing in an in vitro translation reaction (Fig. 2 A). This processing was completely inhibited by mutation of the active site Cys to Ala of rev-caspases-3 and -6 (third and sixth lanes) and by selected caspase inhibitors (see below). To test the effect of selected caspase inhibitors on the autocatalytic activity of rev-caspases-3 and -6, we translated the rev-caspases in the presence of different amounts of the inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 2 B, in the presence of increasing amounts of DEVD-CHO, a decrease in the amount of cleavage products and a corresponding increase in the amount of the rev-caspase-3 precursor was observed. This corresponded to nearly 50–90% inhibition of the autocatalytic activity of rev-caspase-3 at 40–400 nm concentration. However, the same concentrations of this inhibitor had little effect on the autocatalytic activity of rev-caspase-6 (Fig. 2 B). This is consistent with earlier observations that caspase-6 is poorly inhibited by DEVD-CHO (22Srinivasula S.M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Zangrilli J. Robertson N. Armstrong R.C. Wang L. Trapani J.A. Tomaselli K.J. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27099-27106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). On the other hand, z-VAD-fmk had nearly an equal inhibitory effect on rev-caspases-3 and -6 autocatalytic activity at the concentration used in this experiment (Fig. 2 B). Nevertheless, nearly 10-fold more of z-VAD-fmk than DEVD-CHO was required to obtain complete inhibition of caspase-3 activity. Similarly, baculovirus p35 had nearly an equal inhibitory effect on rev-caspases-3 and -6 autocatalytic activity (data not shown). At limited caspase concentration, PARP is specifically cleaved by caspases-3 and -7 but not other caspases. Similarly, lamin A is specifically cleaved by caspase-6 but not other caspases. To compare the activity of the wild type and rev-caspases-3 and -6 toward PARP and lamin A, we expressed these caspases in bacteria and then incubated them with the two substrates. As shown in Fig. 3, the activity of the rev-caspases toward these two substrates was indistinguishable from their wild type counterparts. Both caspase-3 variants (reversed and wild type), but not caspase-6 variants, efficiently cleaved PARP. In contrast, both caspase-6 variants, but not caspase-3 variants, efficiently cleaved lamin A. These results demonstrate that the mature caspases generated from the reversed and the wild type constructs have similar substrate specificity for PARP and lamin A. To determine the apoptotic activity of rev-caspases-3 and -6in vivo, we expressed them in human MCF-7 cells. Unlike the wild type caspases-3 and -6 or the C/A mutant rev-caspases-3 and -6, the rev-caspases potently induced apoptosis in nearly 90% of the transfected cells (Fig. 4). Overexpression of Bcl-2 or CrmA, which protect against different forms of apoptosis, did not significantly reduce their apoptotic activity. Nevertheless, overexpression of the baculovirus p35, which inhibits the activity of most caspases, partially protected against their apoptotic activity. Also, incubation of the transfected cells in the presence of 20 μm z-VAD-fmk dramatically reduced their apoptotic activity to nearly 30%. These data confirm previous observations that the activity of caspases-3 and -6 are downstream of the CrmA and Bcl-2 block in the apoptotic cascade and can only be inhibited by relatively high concentration of the pancaspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. To demonstrate that the rev-caspase molecules are inherently active and do not require separation of the two subunits, we removed the DEVD site and mutated the Asp-9 and Asp-28 that are present between the two subunits of rev-caspase-3 (see Fig. 1 B). However, to follow the activity of this molecule, we introduced a cleavable 35-residue-long His6-T7-tag N terminus to the IETD site (Fig. 5 A). Upon in vitro translation of this molecule there was no evidence of cleavage between the two subunits (Fig. 5 A). Nevertheless, the translated molecule was active as evident from its ability to cleave the His6-T7-tag at its N terminus to form the p32 species (Fig. 5 A). Also, expression of this molecule in bacteria generated an active molecule that can cleave the DEVD-AMC, substrate (Fig. 5 B). However, when the active site Cys was mutated to Ala or in the presence of 400 nm DEVD-CHO, processing of the His6-T7-tag was inhibited and only the full-length p36 species was seen (Fig. 5 A, fifth and sixth lanes). These data demonstrate that when the two subunits of a caspase are rearranged in the reverse order, it is not necessary to first separate them from each other to generate an active caspase. Also, in the rev-caspases the two subunits are not derived from two precursor molecules but from a spontaneous folding of one molecule. Thus by mimicking the three-dimensional structure of the mature caspase-3, it was possible to design contiguous and active caspases-3 and -6 molecules. In conclusion, some of the important aspects of these constitutively active caspases are their utility in in vitro and in vivo drug screening, identifying endogenous substrates and inhibitors and targeted gene therapy model systems. For example, the rev-caspase cDNAs could be introduced into transgenic mice under the control of inducible promoters to induce apoptosis selectively in target tissues. This transgenic model system could be utilized to determine the usefulness of a given caspase inhibitory drug to block the process of apoptosis induced by the rev-caspase. It could also be used to study the pathology of selective apoptosis induction in certain tissues. To identify endogenous substrates or inhibitors, the rev-caspases could be used in the yeast two-hybrid system. Because the active rev-caspase is encoded by one contiguous molecule and does not require cleavage, it could be fused to the DNA binding domain of yeast two-hybrid vectors to screen cDNA libraries for potential inhibitors of caspases. An active site mutant of the rev-caspase could also be used to screen for interacting substrates in this system. In targeted gene therapy models, rev-caspases could potentially be used to destroy unwanted cells such as tumor and autoimmune cells. Because of the importance of caspases in apoptosis and the disease processes associated with it, it is expected that these engineered rev-caspases may find additional unique and valuable applications in the future."

MDR1 belongs to the superfamily of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and contains a tandem repeat of transmembrane domains and conserved nucleotide-binding motifs connected by a central “linker” region (1Gottesman M.M.

Cremo C.R. Grammer J.C. Kerwin B.A. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. 1992; 336: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), MDR1 forms a strong complex with a radioactively labeled nucleotide. Vanadate stops the full catalytic cycle of MDR1, most probably by replacing inorganic phosphate, and stabilizes a protein-trapped form of a nucleotide, which was found to be exclusively ADP (11Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Experimentally, this nucleotide trapping can be followed by using [α-32P]ATP as an energy donor substrate, because the MDR1-trapped labeled nucleotide is not removable by washings even in the presence of high concentrations of MgATP and/or MgADP. A covalent MDR1 labeling occurs if the photoaffinity analog, 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP is used in the trapping reaction, followed by UV light treatment. It has been documented (12Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B.

The ADP-associated form of MDR1 may represent a high energy intermediate of the protein, required for the drug-pump function (13Senior A.E. Al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L.

In contrast, a substrate stimulation of the labeled nucleotide trapping has recently been reported in the case of MRP, another ABC transporter involved in drug resistance (16Taguchi Y. Yoshida A. Takada Y. Komano T. Ueda K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).

In the present paper, we demonstrate that the addition of transported drug substrates significantly increases the rate of vanadate-dependent nucleotide trapping in MDR1, when this process is studied under properly selected experimental conditions. To assay the reactions of the wild-type and mutant MDR1, the transport protein and its variants were expressed using the baculovirus-Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cell system and characterized by analyzing their nucleotide trapping in isolated membrane preparations. The experiments presented clearly show that the vanadate-dependent nucleotide trapping in MDR1 reflects a drug-dependent partial reaction of the transport cycle, which is significantly modulated by site-directed mutations in the pump protein. Our experiments also indicate a close cooperation of the two nucleotide binding sites in the drug-dependent trapping of nucleotides. 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP (666 GBq/mmol) and [α-32P]ATP (111 TBq/mmol) were obtained from ICN Biomedicals.

Isolated Sf9 cell membranes (100 μg protein) were incubated for 30 s to 10 min at 37 °C in a reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-KCl (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm sodium-azide, and 1 mmouabain in a final volume of 50 μl, in the presence of 5–200 μm (final concentration) of Mg-8-azido-ATP or MgATP containing 0.1–0.2 MBq of 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP or [α-32P]ATP. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 500 μl of ice-cold Tris-EGTA-MgATP-vanadate buffer (50 mmTris-KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgATP, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate), the membranes were spun for 20 min at 4 °C at 15,000 × g, the supernatant was removed, 500 μl of Tris-EGTA-ATP-vanadate buffer were added, and the centrifugation was repeated. In the case of [α-32P]ATP labeling, the membranes were dissolved in electrophoresis buffer, and activity was measured in a scintillation counter, whereas in the case of 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP labeling, the washed pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of Tris-EGTA buffer, placed in a drop on a Parafilm-covered glass plate, cooled, and kept on ice. The samples were irradiated for 10 min with a UV lamp (λmax about 250 nm) at a distance of 3 cm. Thereafter the membranes were collected in 40 μl of the electrophoresis buffer, and the samples were run on 6% Laemmli-type gels. The proteins were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described above and the blots were dried and subjected to autoradiography in a phosphorimager (Bio-Rad). The identity of the 32P-azido-nucleotide labeled bands was assured by immunostaining with anti-MDR1 specific antibody (antibody 4077) on the same blot. In this set of experiments, we examined the vanadate-dependent nucleotide trapping in isolated Sf9 cell membranes expressing the wild-type MDR1 by using the photoaffinity ATP analog, 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP. 8-Azido-ATP was reported to be an efficient energy donor substrate for the MDR1-ATPase, although both the K m and the V max values were found to be lower for Mg-8-azido-ATP than for MgATP (23Urbatsch I.L. Al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7069-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Labeling was performed in the presence of sodium orthovanadate as described under “Materials and Methods” for the time intervals and nucleotide concentrations indicated in Figs. 1 and2. Verapamil and 5-fluorouracil (5FU) were used as test drugs because verapamil is a well-known substrate and activator of the MDR1 ATPase, whereas 5FU is not transported by MDR1 and does not stimulate MDR1-ATPase activity (1Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3547) Google Scholar, 6Sarkadi B. Price E.M. Boucher R.C. Germann U.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol.

The addition of 1 mm MgATP to the reaction medium abolished 8-azido-nucleotide trapping in MDR1, indicating a competition of MgATP and Mg-8-azido-ATP at the specific nucleotide binding sites (data not shown).Figure 2Mg-8-azido-ATP concentration and time dependence of nucleotide trapping in MDR1. Labeling was performed by the incubation of 100 μg of Sf9 cell membranes expressing the human MDR1 at 37 °C, in the presence of 200 μmsodium orthovanadate and various concentrations of Mg-8-azido-[α-32P]ATP. The incubation medium contained no added drug (control), or when indicated, verapamil (50 μm), or NEM (500 μm).

The major labeled protein band in the Sf9 cell membranes after 2 min of incubation at 37 °C with 5 μmMg-8-azido-[α-32P]ATP is human MDR1. A weak labeling was also observed in the 70–80-kDa proteolytic fragments of MDR1, which were formed during the labeling, washing, and irradiation procedure and which were also visible as reactive bands on the immunoblots (Fig. 1 B). The addition of verapamil greatly increased the labeling of MDR1, whereas this labeling was unaffected by 5FU. The sulfhydril reagent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), by reacting with cysteine residues at the nucleotide binding sites, was shown to be a powerful covalent inhibitor of the MDR1 ATPase and drug transport function but did not affect primary nucleotide or drug binding (10Senior A.E. Al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig. 1 A, nucleotide trapping was fully inhibited by 500 μm N-ethylmaleimide. There was no measurable 32P incorporation into membranes expressing β-galactosidase. As estimated from measurements of32P incorporation in the washed membranes and in the excised bands of MDR1 from the blots, UV treatment resulted in the cross-linking of 40–50% of the trapped 32P activity in each experiment. Fig. 2 A represents the 8-azido-ATP concentration dependence of nucleotide trapping by MDR1, measured in the presence or absence of 50 μm verapamil after 2 min of incubation at 37 °C. Verapamil stimulation of labeling was 3–5-fold at 2–5 μm 8-azido-ATP, and although the level of nucleotide trapping increased, the percentage of drug stimulation was much less at higher 8-azido-ATP concentrations. A saturation of the 8-azido-nucleotide trapping was observed at about 100 μmMg-8-azido-ATP, both with and without the addition of verapamil. Fig. 2 B shows the time course of 32P-nucleotide trapping when the isolated Sf9 cell membranes were incubated with 5 μm 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP at 37 °C. As shown, the addition of 50 μm verapamil increased the labeling 4–7-fold at 1 min, whereas less stimulation was observed at increasing time periods (after 5 min, the degradation of ATP significantly reduced the rate of further labeling). In each set of experiments, both β-galactosidase-expressing and NEM-pretreated MDR1-expressing membranes served as controls. Altogether, these experiments strongly suggest that the rate of nucleotide trapping in MDR1 from 8-azido-ATP is significantly increased by the addition of a known drug substrate of this transporter, whereas N-ethylmaleimide pretreatment blocks the formation of a trapped nucleotide. The physiological energy donor for drug transport by MDR1 is MgATP; therefore, we performed experiments similar to those described above by using Mg[α-32P]ATP. Because nucleotide cross-linking could not be found in this case (see also Ref. 12Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26956-26961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), nucleotide trapping was measured by counting the membrane-bound radioactivity after repeated washings of the membranes in the presence of 200 μmsodium orthovanadate and 10 mm MgATP at 4 °C (see “Materials and Methods”). Fig. 3 A represents the MgATP concentration dependence of nucleotide trapping, measured in the MDR1-expressing Sf9 cell membranes after 1 min of incubation with Mg[α-32P]ATP at 37 °C. Under these conditions, verapamil increased membrane labeling 4–8-fold at 5–50 μm MgATP, whereas the relative drug stimulation of nucleotide trapping was lower at higher MgATP concentrations. The saturation of the vanadate-dependent nucleotide trapping reaction could not be exactly determined in these experiments, because at higher MgATP concentrations (above 300–500 μm) nonspecific membrane labeling became relatively high. It is to be noted that in contrast to verapamil, 5-fluorouracil had no effect on vanadate-dependent nucleotide trapping at any MgATP concentration examined (not shown), and 32P incorporation was significantly lower in the control, β-galactosidase-expressing membranes. Nucleotide trapping was significantly reduced in the NEM-pretreated, MDR1-expressing membranes, and in the presence of this MDR1 transport and ATPase inhibitor,32P incorporation was not influenced by verapamil or by other MDR1 substrate drugs (see below). Fig. 3 B shows the time course of 32P-nucleotide trapping when the MDR1-expressing isolated Sf9 cell membranes were incubated with 50 μm [α-32P]ATP at 37 °C. We found that 50 μm verapamil increased the labeling 4–6 times at 30 s to 1 min, whereas significantly less verapamil stimulation was observed after longer incubation periods. Again, a low level of 32P-nucleotide trapping was found in the NEM-pretreated membranes and in the control, β-galactosidase-expressing membranes; the level of trapping was not influenced by verapamil. Fig. 4 shows the detailed examination of the effects of various drugs on the nucleotide trapping in MDR1-expressing membranes incubated at 37 °C for 2 min with 5 μm 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP (Fig. 4 A), or for 1 min with 50 μmMg[α-32P]ATP (Fig. 4 B). As shown in Fig. 4 A, covalent labeling after nucleotide trapping from 8-azido-ATP was found to be significantly stimulated by the MDR1 substrate drugs verapamil, cyclosporine A (CsA), or calcein AM (CaAM), whereas free calcein (Ca free) and 5FU, which are not MDR1 substrates (see Refs. 1Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3547) Google Scholar, 2Germann U.A. Chambers T.C. Ambudkar S.V. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. J. Bioenerg.

Fig. 4 B demonstrates the drug concentration dependence of nucleotide trapping in MDR1 from Mg[α-32P]ATP. Again, verapamil, CsA, vincristine, and rhodamine 123 significantly stimulated nucleotide trapping in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas free calcein and 5FU had no effect. The stimulation of nucleotide trapping was evoked by much lower concentrations of CsA, verapamil, or calcein AM than of, for example, rhodamine 123. This pattern closely corresponds to the drug concentration dependence of the MDR1-ATPase activity (see Refs. 6Sarkadi B. Price E.M. Boucher R.C. Germann U.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4854-4858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Sharom F.J. Yu X. Doige C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24197-24202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Senior A.E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3745-3754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the stimulatory effect of cyclosporine A was much more pronounced than in the MDR1-ATPase activity measurements (see “Discussion”). A mutant form of MDR1 with a 20-amino acid deletion in its first extracellular loop (Δaa 78–97 MDR1), has been shown to have a reduced drug transport capacity (27Schinkel A.H Kemp S. Dolle M. Rudenko G. Wagenaar E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7474-7481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a low level of ATPase activity, stimulated only by extremely high concentrations (above 200 μm) of verapamil (20Welker E. Szabó K. Holló Zs. Müller M. Sarkadi B. Váradi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Nucleotide trapping in this mutant MDR1, expressed in Sf9 cell membranes, was followed in the presence of 5 μm Mg-8-azido-ATP and 200 μmvanadate for 2 min at 37 °C, and covalent labeling was achieved by UV light treatment. As shown in Fig. 5, in the Δaa 78–97 MDR1 protein, nucleotide trapping was almost negligible without added drugs, and 50 μm verapamil or 20 μm calcein AM (which produced a maximum stimulation of nucleotide trapping in the wild-type MDR1) had little effect on this labeling. However, the addition of high concentrations of verapamil (300 μm) produced a significant labeling even in the mutant MDR1, approaching the level seen in the wild-type protein (Fig. 5 C). In the following experiments, we examined nucleotide trapping with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP (followed by photo-cross-linking) in MDR1 variants in which essential lysine residues in the Walker A motifs were mutated. These lysines were replaced by methionines either in the N-terminal ABC domain (K433M), in the C-terminal ABC domain (K1076M), or in both ABC domains (K433M/K1076M). These mutant MDR1s, when expressed in Sf9 cells, were shown to demonstrate significant 8-azido-ATP binding but no drug transport or drug-stimulated ATPase activity (21Müller M. Bakos É. Welker E.

Because, in these mutant proteins, nucleotide binding may also be altered at low MgATP concentrations (21Müller M. Bakos É. Welker E. Váradi A. Germann U.A. Gottesman M.M. Morse S.B. Roninson I.B. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1877-1883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), we examined their nucleotide trapping under two different experimental conditions. In the experiments shown in Fig. 6, isolated Sf9 membranes were incubated at 37 °C with 200 μm vanadate in the presence of either 5 μmMg-8-azido-ATP for 2 min (Fig. 6 A), or 50 μmMg-8-azido-ATP for 10 min (Fig. 6 B). The reaction medium contained either no drug or 50 μm verapamil. In these experiments, β-galactosidase-expressing membranes, wild-type MDR1, and its NEM-pretreated form served as comparisons. As shown in Fig. 6, none of the mutant MDR1 variants performed any nucleotide trapping, even if higher 8-azido-ATP concentrations and longer incubation periods were used. Fig. 7 shows the autoradiograms (Fig. 7 A) and the immunoblots (Fig. 7 B) for some of the experimental data presented in Fig. 6. As shown, there was no significant azido-ATP trapping in either the K433M or K1076M mutant MDR1 proteins, whereas the corresponding immunoblots ensured that the isolated Sf9 cell membranes contained about equal amounts of the MDR1 variants in all experiments. The detailed reaction mechanism of ABC transporters, which involves the hydrolysis of MgATP and a concomitant membrane transport of the relevant substrates, is still largely unknown. The discovery of a vanadate-dependent trapping of a nucleotide during the reaction cycle of the multidrug transporter MDR1 (11Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 12Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1997; 341: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), opened new avenues for the detailed examination of its reaction mechanism. In the present experiments, we studied the effects of drug substrates on this nucleotide trapping in MDR1, as well as the modulation of this phenomenon by well characterized mutations in the protein. In the catalytic cycle model originally suggested for MDR1 by Senior et al. (13Senior A.E. Al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), MgATP binding to MDR1 is followed by a conversion of this nucleotide to MgADP and Pi. Addition of vanadate blocks MDR1-ATPase probably by replacing the released inorganic phosphate and results in the formation of a trapped nucleotide, which is predominantly ADP (12Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26956-26961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 13Senior A.E. Al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Our experiments indicate that the vanadate-dependent nucleotide trapping by MDR1 most probably represents a partial reaction of the enzyme activity, the rate of which is greatly increased by the transported drug substrates. We suggest that vanadate trapping stabilizes an occluded, enzyme-bound form of the cleaved nucleotide, the formation of which shows a drug concentration dependence closely resembling the drug stimulation of the full MDR1-ATPase cycle. Judged from MgATP binding studies (see Refs. 28Cornwell M.M. Tsuruo T. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar and 29Al-Shawi M. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4197-4206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and from the MgATP dependence of the MDR1-ATPase (see Refs. 6Sarkadi B. Price E.M. Boucher R.C. Germann U.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4854-4858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Senior A.E. Al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. J. Bioenerg.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3745-3754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), MDR1 binds MgATP with a relatively low affinity, with a K D of about 200–500 μm. The binding of MgATP occurs randomly at the two nucleotide binding sites, and the stoichiometry of MgATP/MDR1 at saturating MgATP concentrations is 2:1 (12Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26956-26961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Data in the literature indicate that this MgATP binding is not affected by the presence of drug substrates (1Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3547) Google Scholar, 10Senior A.E. Al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 28Cornwell M.M. Tsuruo T. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Experimental data also suggest that primary drug binding by MDR1 (as measured at 4 °C) is similarly unaffected by the presence or absence of MgATP (see Refs. 17Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar and 30Bruggemann E.P. Currier S.J. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21020-21026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); thus, initial MgATP and drug binding seem to be independent reactions. In contrast to MgATP binding, ATP hydrolysis requires an interaction of the protein with the transported drug substrate. Human MDR1-ATPase activity, as measured in isolated Sf9 cell membranes, is about 5–6-fold higher in the presence than in the absence of drug substrates, e.g. verapamil (the “basic” MDR1-ATPase activity is probably supported by endogenous lipid-like or other hydrophobic molecules in the membrane preparation). As we demonstrate in this report, the partial reaction of MDR1-ATPase (reflected in the MDR1 nucleotide trapping), is also strongly accelerated by the transported substrates. In previous studies (11Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 12Urbatsch I.L.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), this drug stimulation of nucleotide trapping was not observed, probably because the experiments were carried out at relatively high ATP concentrations and/or for long measurement periods. Drug substrate stimulation of the nucleotide trapping in our experiments is also restricted to early time periods and unsaturating MgATP (or 8-azido-MgATP) concentrations, that is, under conditions where the drug-dependent acceleration still significantly affects the “titration” of the relevant nucleotide trapping site. It is interesting to note that the differences between the concentration dependence and the time course of nucleotide trapping observed here for Mg-8-azido-ATP and for MgATP can be well explained by the lower K m and V max values of Mg-8-azido-ATP than of MgATP (17Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar,29Al-Shawi M. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4197-4206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): although higher MgATP concentrations are required to saturate the nucleotide binding sites, both ATP splitting and nucleotide trapping are faster with MgATP than with Mg-8-azido-ATP. In our present experiments under near-saturating conditions, the molar ratio of nucleotide trapping by MDR1 was estimated to be about 0.4–0.6, supporting the conclusion of Urbatsch et al. (12Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26956-26961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) that only one nucleotide is promoted to an occluded state during this partial reaction. The drug substrate concentration dependence of the MDR1-ATPase activity and that of the nucleotide trapping were found to be similar, that is, a significant stimulation of both reactions was obtained by similar concentrations of verapamil, vincristine, rhodamine 123, or calcein AM. The data obtained for the deletion mutant in the first extracellular loop of MDR1 (Δaa 78–97), namely that stimulation could be obtained only with extremely high concentrations of verapamil, also strongly suggest that substrate interactions modify the process of nucleotide trapping similarly to that of the MDR1-ATPase activity. Still, some substrates (such as CsA) that yield only very small stimulation of the ATPase but strongly inhibit its verapamil stimulation (31Sarkadi B. Müller M. Homolya L. Holló Z. Seprôdi J. Germann U.A. Gottesman M.M. Price E.M. Boucher R.C. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 766-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) produced a much greater stimulation of nucleotide trapping (the inhibition of this reaction at higher CsA concentrations was also apparent). These data indicate that the partial reaction of nucleotide trapping may be efficiently promoted by some substrates that can yield only a low turnover for the MDR1-ATPase activity, which reflects the full catalytic cycle. Interaction of the multidrug transporter with SH group reagents, such as NEM, preferentially occurs at the two cysteine residues in the two nucleotide binding domains (29Al-Shawi M. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4197-4206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Liu R. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11865-11873Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of MDR1 with SH group reagents blocks MDR1-ATPase activity (29Al-Shawi M. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4197-4206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but at low concentrations does not inhibit the primary binding of MgATP or drug substrates, as shown by the MgATP- or drug-dependent quenching of an MDR1-bound fluorescent SH-reactive probe (32Liu R. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11865-11873Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). A recent communication (33Wang Y. Georges E. Anticancer Res. 1997; 17: 357-364PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that NEM may in fact increase drug binding by MDR1 under certain conditions. Because, as reported here, NEM fully blocks drug-stimulated nucleotide trapping, MgATP and primary drug substrate binding most probably occur independently from the following reaction steps, leading to ATP hydrolysis. The mutant MDR1 proteins, in which lysines in the first (K433M), second (K1076M), or both nucleotide binding domains are replaced by methionines, were demonstrated to bind MgATP less efficiently at low MgATP concentrations (2–5 μm) but similarly to the wild-type MDR1 at concentrations above 10 μm MgATP (21Müller M. Bakos É. Welker E. Váradi A. Germann U.A. Gottesman M.M. Morse S.B. Roninson I.B. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1877-1883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). None of these MDR1 variants possess measurable ATPase activity (21Müller M. Bakos É. Welker E. Váradi A. Germann U.A. Gottesman M.M. Morse S.B. Roninson I.B. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1877-1883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar); thus, a mutation in one ATP binding domain is sufficient to eliminate the catalytic reaction in the whole pump protein (see also Refs. 26Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7750-7755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and34Azzaria M. Schurr E. Gros P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5289-5297Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). This finding was interpreted to indicate a strong cooperative interaction between the two nucleotide binding domains of MDR1. As we demonstrate here, independently of the presence or absence of drug substrates, none of these nucleotide binding site mutants perform the nucleotide trapping reaction. Thus, a mutation in one of the nucleotide binding domains eliminates nucleotide trapping entirely, showing a cooperation between the ABC domains already in this partial reaction. Based on the above-described features, we propose that the molecular mechanism of the vectorial drug transport by MDR1 is initiated by the independent primary binding of MgATP and the drug substrate. The following conformational changes in the structure of the MDR1 protein induce a drug-dependent cleavage and a concomitant occlusion of a MgADP molecule, whereas the full catalytic cycle involves the transport of drug substrate to the external membrane surface and the full hydrolysis of ATP and the dissociation of ADP and inorganic phosphate. All of the steps after MgATP and drug binding are based on the functional cooperation of the two ATP binding domains and the appropriate drug binding domains within MDR1. The drug-dependent ATP hydrolysis and occlusion most probably significantly alter the conformation and/or location of the drug binding site(s). As shown by Urbatsch and Senior (17Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping significantly reduced azidopine labeling in MDR1. Recent experiments of Dey et al. (18Dey S. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Ambudkar S.V. Proc. Natl. Acd. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 96: 10594-10599Crossref Scopus (355) Google Scholar) demonstrated the presence of two nonidentical drug-interaction sites in the MDR1 protein. In this study the C-terminal drug-recognition (“on”) site was found to be significantly more sensitive to vanadate trapping of nucleotides than the N-terminal (“off”) site, and ATP hydrolysis was essential for the vanadate-induced reduction of drug binding. Our experiments and these data collectively suggest that ATP hydrolysis is strongly coupled to the movement of the drug substrate from an “on” to an “off” site within the MDR1 protein, and nucleotide occlusion may coincide with the occlusion of the drug binding site(s), leading to a vectorial movement of the drug substrate. It should be noted that the above-described stimulation of nucleotide trapping in MDR1 by the substrate drugs may also be efficiently employed for the screening of specific drug interactions with MDR1, because even those substrates (e.g. CsA) that predominantly inhibit the MDR1-ATPase activity may show a strong stimulation of nucleotide trapping. Moreover, the investigation of substrate stimulation of nucleotide trapping in other related proteins,e.g. CFTR, TAP, or MRP, may help to understand the reaction mechanism and transport characteristics of these ABC transporters.

This cytoskeletal response is rapid, peaking 2 h after thrombin stimulation, and reverses by 50% after 24 h. The thrombin receptor peptide SFLLRNP also induces cell rounding, whereas other G protein-linked receptor agonists such as carbachol, lysophosphatidic acid, or bradykinin fail to do so. Results of studies using pharmacological inhibitors do not support a requirement for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, or Ca2+ mobilization in this response. Inhibition of protein kinase C or tyrosine kinase produces minimal blockade. Pertussis toxin treatment is also without effect. However, thrombin-induced rounding is fully blocked by the C3 toxin from Clostridium botulinum, which specifically ADP-ribosylates and inactivates the small G protein Rho. Thrombin also leads to a rapid, 2.4-fold increase in 32P incorporation into myosin light chain while carbachol does not. Myosin phosphorylation, like cell rounding is inhibited by inactivation of Rho with C3 exoenzyme, suggesting that myosin phosphorylation is necessary for this cytoskeletal response. This is supported by the observation that thrombin-induced rounding is also blocked by the myosin light chain kinase inhibitor KT5926. However, treatment with KT5926 fails to inhibit mitogenesis. Thus, cell rounding is not prerequisite to thrombin-induced DNA synthesis. We conclude that stimulation of the heterotrimeric G protein-coupled thrombin receptor in 1321N1 cells activates Rho-dependent pathways for both DNA synthesis and cell rounding, the cytoskeletal response being mediated in part through increases in myosin phosphorylation.

Thrombin is a protease known to act through a specific seven-transmembrane spanning G protein-coupled receptor. Thrombin activates its receptor through a proteolytic cleavage mechanism which unmasks a new amino terminus that functions as a tethered ligand to activate receptor signaling (1Vu T.H. Hung D.T.

We recently demonstrated that the novel, PTX-insensitive G12 protein is necessary for thrombin-stimulated DNA synthesis in 1321N1 cells and suggested selective coupling of the thrombin receptor to this G protein (18Post G.R.

The effectors of G12 are not known, but there is some evidence that it transduces its effects via low molecular weight G proteins. We and others have shown that Rac and Rho mediate downstream responses to G12, including activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades and stress fiber formation (24Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L.

Several G protein-coupled receptor agonists induce morphological responses which appear to be mediated through Rho. For example, in neuronal cell lines and PC12 cells, LPA has been shown to act through Rho to induce neurite retraction and stress fiber formation (13Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N.

Furthermore, Rho has been found to be involved in thrombin-stimulated neurite retraction in both N1E-115 and NG108-15 neuronal cells (13Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar).These findings imply that receptors known to couple to heterotrimeric G proteins can, at least indirectly, recruit small G proteins of the Rho family and thereby effect cytoskeletal changes. These Rho-dependent changes may be mediated through myosin phosphorylation which regulates the actin-myosin II interaction (31de Lanerolle P. Paul R.J. Am. J.

The ability of GTPγS to increase myosin phosphorylation in smooth muscle cells appears to be mediated through Rho (36Noda M. Yasuda-Fukazawa C. Moriishi K. Kato T. Okuda T. Kurokawa K. Takuwa Y.

Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar) have shown that activated Rho increases myosin phosphorylation through Rho kinase, which phosphorylates the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase, inhibiting its activity and increasing levels of phosphorylated myosin. Rho kinase has also been shown to directly phosphorylate myosin light chain at the same site as myosin light chain kinase (40Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Chihara K. Nakano T. Matsuura Y.

Schwartz M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 507-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) could also mediate Rho-dependent effects on cell morphology.We have utilized the 1321N1 astrocytoma cell line to examine the molecular mechanisms that underlie actin cytoskeletal changes induced by thrombin, specifically the involvement of second messengers, Rho, and myosin phosphorylation in this response; related studies have also determined whether the thrombin-induced morphological change is required for mitogenic responses to this agonist. We demonstrate here that thrombin induces marked changes in cell morphology which, like DNA synthesis, are dependent on Rho function. Cell rounding can be dissociated from DNA synthesis, however, and appears to be mediated via Rho-dependent increases in the phosphorylation state of myosin light chain.DISCUSSIONThe data presented here demonstrate that thrombin treatment leads to a pronounced cytoskeletal response, characterized as cell rounding or reversal of stellation, in 1321N1 astrocytoma cells. Morphological responses to thrombin were once considered to result from proteolytic effects on extracellular matrix proteins (15Suidan H.S. Stone S.R. Hemmings B.A. Monard D. Neuron. 1992; 8: 363-375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 53Monard D. Trends Neurosci. 1988; 11: 541-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), but as we show here, and others have recently demonstrated, the thrombin receptor peptide SFLLRNP mimics this effect of thrombin. The receptor peptide lacks proteolytic activity, acting instead like the tethered ligand shown to be formed when the cloned thrombin receptor is activated by thrombin. Thus this cytoskeletal response appears to be regulated through ligand interaction with the cell surface thrombin receptor.The thrombin receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor which is capable of both inhibiting adenylate cyclase through Gi and stimulating phospholipase C through Gq or other PTX-insensitive G protein(s) (11Hung D.T. Wong Y.H. Vu T.K. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20831-20834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA synthesis in fibroblasts is regulated through the same cloned receptor (54Trejo J.A. Connolly A.J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21536-21541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We have shown that this receptor is also expressed in 1321N1 cells, 2D. Goldstein, and J. H. Brown, unpublished results. where thrombin regulates phospholipase C (16Jones L.G. McDonough P.M. Brown J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 142-149PubMed Google Scholar), AP-1 mediated gene expression (55Trejo J. Chambard J.-C. Karin M. Brown J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4742-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and DNA synthesis (10LaMorte V.J. Kennedy E.D. Collins L.R. Goldstein D. Harootunian A.T. Brown J.H. Feramisco J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19411-19415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) through PTX-insensitive pathways (18Post G.R. Collins L.R. Kennedy E.D. Moskowitz S.A. Aragay A.M. Goldstein D. Brown J.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1679-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thrombin-induced cell rounding, like these other responses, is PTX-insensitive, consistent with results obtained from studies examining thrombin- and LPA-induced cell rounding in neuronal and PC-12 cells (14Jalink K. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 56Tigyi G. Fischer D.J. Sebok A. Marshall F. Dyer D.L. Miledi R. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 549-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Thus, neither α nor βγ subunits from the pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi/Go family G proteins appear to mediate this response.Several lines of evidence also indicate that activation of phospholipase C and generation of its second messengers does not account for the PTX-insensitive cytoskeletal effects mediated by thrombin receptor activation. First, we show here that pretreatment with BAPTA-AM, which blocks the agonist and inositol trisphosphate-induced mobilization of Ca2+ in 1321N1 cells (21Trilivas I. McDonough P.M. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8431-8438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), does not inhibit thrombin-induced cell rounding. Similarly, pharmacological inhibition of PKC causes only a modest degree of blockade of thrombin-induced cell rounding. A dissociation of phospholipase C activation from the cytoskeletal effects of thrombin is further supported by our observations that other agonists that stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis in 1321N1 cells (e.g.carbachol and bradykinin) do not induce cell rounding.The low molecular weight Rho family of G proteins has been widely implicated in regulating the actin cytoskeleton (28Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar, 57Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3050) Google Scholar). Numerous publications from Hall's laboratory have demonstrated unique but cell specific functions for Rac, Rho, and Cdc42 in regulating cell morphology (58Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3700) Google Scholar). Microinjection studies performed in fibroblasts demonstrate that Rho mediates stress fiber formation and that inhibition of Rho function prevents stress fiber formation in response to LPA and bombesin (24Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In neuronal cell lines and PC12 cells, LPA and thrombin induce rounding rather than stress fiber formation. These responses have also been demonstrated to be Rho-dependent as they are blocked by treatment with the C3 exoenzyme from botulinum toxin (13Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 14Jalink K. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 411-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Our data extend these observations to astroglial cells where we demonstrate by application and transient expression of the C3 exoenzyme that Rho function is required for thrombin-induced cell rounding, and further explore the basis for this response.There are several downstream effectors of Rho which could mediate cell rounding or stress fiber formation. One candidate is the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-kinase which was reported to be regulated by Rho in fibroblasts (42Chong L.D. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 507-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). This enzyme regulates the levels of polyphosphoinositides, which can bind to and control myofilament-protein interactions (59Gilmore A.P. Burridge K. Nature. 1996; 381: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 60Fukami K. Endo T. Imamura M. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1518-1522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, Rho has been shown to interact directly with and activate serine/threonine kinases among which is protein kinase N, a PKC-related kinase (41Amano M. Mukai H. Ono Y. Chihara K. Matsui T.

The most likely candidate for the effector responsible for Rho-mediated cell rounding, however, is the Rho-dependent kinase.

The best characterized enzyme involved in myosin phosphorylation is the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent enzyme MLCK. Phosphorylation of myosin light chains by MLCK stimulates the actin-activated ATPase in smooth muscle and non-muscle myosin (31de Lanerolle P. Paul R.J. Am. J.

In addition to MLCK, myosin light chain can be phosphorylated by PKC, PKA, and PAK (p21-activated kinase 1) (68Turbedsky K. Pollard T. Bresnick A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2063-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 69Nishikawa M. de Lanerolle P. Lincoln T.M. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol.

Most recently, myosin phosphorylation has been shown to be increased by Rho-dependent pathways involving phosphorylation of the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase (39Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K.

As we demonstrate here, inhibition of MLCK with KT5926 produces only a partial decrease in thrombin-stimulated myosin phosphorylation. Blocking the thrombin-stimulated rise in intracellular Ca2+ with BAPTA/AM also leads to only a modest decrease in myosin light chain phosphorylation. Furthermore, carbachol, which mobilizes intracellular Ca2+ and should activate MLCK to the same extent as thrombin, does not increase myosin phosphorylation at the time point examined in our experiments. These findings indicate that additional pathways are involved in regulating the state of myosin phosphorylation in thrombin-stimulated 1321N1 cells. The observation that C3 exoenzyme fully inhibits thrombin stimulation of myosin light chain phosphorylation suggests that a Rho-dependent pathway predominates in regulating myosin phosphorylation in this system.Thrombin-induced cell rounding is a Rho-dependent phenomenon which we suggest is mediated via myosin phosphorylation. The Ca2+-dependent pathways that can presumably lead to myosin phosphorylation do not appear necessary to induce this cytoskeletal response, since BAPTA/AM does not prevent cell rounding. On the other hand, inhibition of Rho with C3 exoenzyme fully blocks cell rounding, implicating Rho-dependent myosin phosphorylation. Evidence from other systems suggests that Ca2+-dependent activation of MLCK is important for rapid increases in myosin light chain phosphorylation such as those required for smooth muscle contraction. In contrast, Rho-dependent pathways appear to result in sustained increases in myosin phosphorylation which, in turn, have been suggested to change the calcium sensitivity of smooth muscle contraction (37Gong M.C.

Commun. 1988; 157: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar).We suggest that thrombin-induced rounding likewise involves a more sustained increase in myosin phosphorylation. Cell rounding peaks at 2 h of continuous thrombin stimulation, and removal of thrombin during this 2-h period prevents maximal rounding. 3In more recent studies the peak response occurs by 30 min. , 4M. Majumdar, L. Acevedo, and J. H. Brown, unpublished observations. A sustained increase in myosin phosphorylation would be best achieved through simultaneous inhibition of myosin phosphatase and activation of myosin kinases. Thrombin may utilize both of these mechanisms by eliciting Rho kinase-dependent activation of myosin phosphorylation and inhibition of myosin phosphatase. The effect of thrombin on the actin cytoskeleton may be dissociated from rapid, transient, Ca2+-mediated increases in myosin phosphorylation"

We have identified a distal IL-2 enhancer regulated by the Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway, which can be induced by TPA/ionomycin treatment. It contains a dyad symmetry element (DSE) controlled by the Ets-like transcription factor GA-binding protein (GABP), a target of activated ERK. TPA/ionomycin treatment of T cells stimulates both mitogen-activated ERK, as well as the stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase family members JNK/SAPK and p38. In this study, we investigated the contribution of the stress-activated pathways to the induction of the distal IL-2 enhancer. We show that JNK- but not p38-activating pathways regulate the DSE activity. Furthermore, the JNK/SAPK signaling pathway cooperates with the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade in TPA/ionomycin-induced DSE activity. In T cells, overexpression of SPRK/MLK3, an activator of JNK/SAPK, strongly induces DSE-dependent transcription and dominant negative kinases of SEK and SAPK impair TPA/ionomycin-induced DSE activity. Blocking both ERK and JNK/SAPK pathways abolishes the DSE induction. The inducibility of the DSE is strongly dependent on the Ets-core motifs, which are bound by GABP. Both subunits of GABP are phosphorylated upon JNK activation in vivo and three different isoforms of JNK/SAPK, but not p38, in vitro. Our data suggest that GABP is targeted by signaling events from both ERK and JNK/SAPK pathways. GABP therefore is a candidate for signal integration and regulation of IL-2 transcription in T lymphocytes.

T cell activation requires at least two signals mediated by T cell receptor-CD3 complex and a costimulatory signal such as ligand binding to CD28 (reviewed by Cantrell (1Cantrell D. Annu. Rev.

This costimulation can be mimicked by phorbolester and calcium ionophore and results in rapid increase of free intracellular calcium ions, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; GABP, GA-binding protein; IL-2, interleukin-2; DSE, dyad symmetry element; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; SEK, SAPK/ERK-kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; MKK6, MAPK kinase 6; SPRK, SH3-domain-containing proline-rich kinase; MLK-3, mixed lineage kinase 3; FCS, fetal calf serum; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; MES, morpholinoethanesulfonic acid; tk, thymidine kinase; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus. cascades, and subsequent induction of IL-2 expression (1Cantrell D.

JNK- and p38-activating pathways are strongly triggered by inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1), UV radiation, and chemical stress inducers such as arsenite and anisomycin, indicating a role in cellular stress response (22Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). However, a recent report describes an involvement of p38 in IL-2- and IL-7-induced T cell proliferation (23Crawley J.B. Rawlinson L. Lali F.V. Page T.H. Saklatvala J. Foxwell B.M. J. Biol.

Cell. 1994; 78: 137-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). In addition, the Ets-related transcription factor, GA-binding protein (GABP), is phosphorylated by ERK controlling the Raf-responsive element of the HIV-1 promoter (35Flory E. Hoffmeyer A. Smola U. Rapp U.R. Bruder J.T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2260-2268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GABP, consisting of two subunits, was originally identified as a protein complex that binds to a purine-rich hexanucleotide 5′-CGGAAR-3′ within the ICP4 promoter of Herpes simplex virus 1 (36LaMarco K. Thompson C.C. Byers B.P. Walton E.M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 253: 789-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 37Thompson C.C. Brown T.A. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 253: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Recently, we have identified another GABP response element within a distal IL-2 enhancer and observed increased IL-2 promoter/enhancer activity when GABP was overexpressed (38Avots A. Hoffmeyer A. Flory E. Cimanis A. Rapp U.R. Serfling E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4381-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The IL-2 gene transcription is tightly regulated and occurs only when T cells are activated via the TCR complex and a costimulatory signal (39Serfling E. Avots A. Neumann M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1263: 181-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The IL-2 promoter/enhancer contains several binding sites for transcription factors regulated by multiple signaling events. The combined NFAT-AP1 sites in the 320-base pair minimal promoter/enhancer region play a crucial role in the integration of different signaling cascades (39Serfling E. Avots A. Neumann M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1263: 181-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, upstream DNA sequences from position −321 to approximately −600 of the IL-2 gene that are highly conserved between mouse and man are shown to enhance the promoter activity (40Rothenberg E. Ward S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9358-9365Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We have identified an inducible enhancer element spanning the region from position −502 to −413 relative to the transcriptional start site. Within the distal enhancer, the GABP binding site consists of two palindromic Ets-related elements (EREs) and were designated dyad symmetry element (DSE) (38Avots A. Hoffmeyer A. Flory E. Cimanis A. Rapp U.R. Serfling E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4381-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We observed a potentiated transcriptional activity of the DSE after costimulation with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and ionomycin (TPA/ionomycin) of T cells as well as by overexpression of Ras, c-Raf, and ERK in combination with TPA stimulation (38Avots A. Hoffmeyer A. Flory E. Cimanis A. Rapp U.R. Serfling E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4381-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As TPA/ionomycin is known to also activate stress-activated protein kinase JNK/SAPK in T cells (2Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar), we investigated whether stress-activated MAPKs contribute to DSE activity in T cells. Here, we report that overexpression of SPRK/MLK3, an activator of SEK-JNK/SAPK cascade, strongly induces DSE activity. The SEK-SAPK cascade partially mediates induced DSE-dependent transcription, and it cooperates with the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade in TPA/ionomycin-induced DSE activity. The DSE activity is strongly dependent on the Ets-core motifs, which are bound by GABP. Both subunits of GABP are phosphorylated upon JNK activation in vivo and three different isoforms of JNK/SAPK in vitro. These data suggest that JNK/SAPK and ERK activation converge on GABP to regulate DSE activity. A3.01 human T lymphoma cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) to a density of 8 × 105 cells/ml. The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 and murine fibroblast cell line NIH-3T3 were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FCS. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in humidified air with 7% CO2. Antibodies raised against ERK2 (sc-154), JNK1 (sc-474), p38 (sc-535), and Flag-tag (sc-807) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Antibodies against GABP-α, GABP-β, and GST were obtained from rabbits immunized with corresponding bacterially expressed and purified proteins. The monoclonal antibodies against HA-tag (12CA5) were produced and purified according to standard protocol. The Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase minimal promoter (−105/+5) alone or downstream of four copies of DSE wild type or mutant (described previously in Avots et al. (38Avots A. Hoffmeyer A.

The mutant DSE has both G nucleotides of both Ets-core motifs replaced by two C nucleotides: DSE (wild type), −462 TTCTGAAACAGGAAACCAATACACTTCCTGTTTAATCAA −424; and DSE (mutant), −462 TTCTGAAACACCAAACCAATACACTTGGTGTTTAATCAA −424.

The expression vectors pRSPA-GABP-α and pRSPA-GABP-β were described earlier (35Flory E. Hoffmeyer A. Smola U. Rapp U.R. Bruder J.T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2260-2268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Raf-BXB-CX (containing the C-terminal, membrane-targeting 17 aa of ki-Ras fused to the kinase domain of c-Raf) was created by fusing the C-terminal part of BXB-CAAX to HA-BXB using the endogenous BglII restriction site. Creation of hemagglutinin-tagged BXB and BXB-CAAX was described previously (42Wang H.-G. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C.

MKK6 (EE) is a constitutively active mutant of MKK6 of which two activating phosphorylation sites were replaced by glutamic acid (21Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol.

All mutants were tested in transient transfection assays and immune complex kinase assays for their inhibiting or activating effects. NIH-3T3 cells were seeded at 7 × 104 cells per well of a 6-well plate and grown for 24 h prior to transfection. HEK-293 cells were seeded at 7 × 105 cells per 10-cm-diameter dish and grown for 24 h prior to transfection. Transfections were performed by a calcium phosphate coprecipitation method using up to 15 μg of vector DNA according to a modified Stratagene transfection protocol. Cells were starved in DMEM containing 0.3% FCS 48 h before stimulation or metabolic labeling. For radiolabeling, cells were washed twice with phosphate-free DMEM and starved 2 h for phosphate. The concentration of [32P]phosphate added to the medium was 500 μCi/ml. At the end of the 2-h-labeling period, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then immediately lysed in RIPA buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Pefabloc, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin). Stimulation of HEK-293 cells was done with 10% FCS, 100 ng/ml TPA (Sigma), or 10 μg/ml anisomycin (Sigma) for indicated times. A3.01 cells were split 4 × 105 cells/ml 1 day before transfection. A DMRIE™-C-based transfection protocol was used according to manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were seeded in 6-well plates 7 × 105 cells/well in 1.5 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 3 μl of DMRIE and up to 3 μg of vector DNA. Transfections for luciferase assays were performed with 0.6 μg of reporter construct plus 2 μg of pRSPA containing diverse cDNAs. Unless otherwise indicated, 24 h after transfection, cells of each well were harvested in 100 μl lysis buffer (50 mm Na-MES, pH 7.8, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2% Triton X-100). The crude cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and 50 μl of precleared cell extracts were added to 50 μl of luciferase assay buffer (125 mm Na-MES, pH 7.8, 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 25 mm Mg-acetate, 2 mg/ml ATP). Immediately after injection of 50 μl of 1 mmd-luciferin (AppliChem) into each sample, the luminescence was measured for 5 s in a luminometer (Berthold). The luciferase activities were normalized on the basis of β-galactosidase activity of cotransfected RSV-β-gal vector and protein content. The β-galactosidase assay was performed with 20 μl of precleared cell lysate according to a standard protocol (47Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2 Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989Google Scholar). Mean and standard deviations of at least three independent experiments each done in duplicates or triplicates are shown in the figures. A3.01 cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml TPA or 0.5 μmionomycin (Sigma) for 24 h unless otherwise indicated. The MEK specific inhibitor, PD098059 (Calbiochem), was used in a 30 μm concentration of a 15 mm stock solution in Me2SO. The p38-specific inhibitor, SB203580 (Calbiochem), was used at a concentration of 2 μm of a 20 mm stock solution in Me2SO. Cells were preincubated with either inhibitor 20 min before stimulation. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (described above), and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Supernatants were incubated with different antisera for 2 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were precipitated with protein-A agarose (Boehringer) and washed twice with high-salt RIPA buffer containing 500 mm NaCl. Immune complexes were either resuspended in electrophoresis sample buffer or used for in vitro kinase assays as described previously by Ludwig et al. (44Ludwig S. Engel K. Hoffmeyer A. Sithanandam G. Neufeld B. Palm D. Gaestel M. Rapp U.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6687-6697Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and detected with a BAS 2000 BioImaging Analyzer (Fuji) and by autoradiography. For detection of the proteins in immunoblots, appropriate primary antibodies together with peroxidase-coupled protein A were used followed by a standard enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (Amersham, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom). Bacterially expressed proteins GABP-α, GABP-β, 3pK(K-M), GST-c-Jun(1–135), and GST-SAPKαI were purified as described earlier (35Flory E. Hoffmeyer A. Smola U. Rapp U.R. Bruder J.T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2260-2268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Ludwig S. Engel K. Hoffmeyer A. Sithanandam G. Neufeld B. Palm D. Gaestel M. Rapp U.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6687-6697Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Crude nuclear extracts of A3.01 cells were prepared as described previously (38Avots A. Hoffmeyer A. Flory E. Cimanis A. Rapp U.R. Serfling E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4381-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). 2 μg of nuclear proteins or various amounts of recombinant GABP proteins were preincubated on ice with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Boehringer) and 1 μg of bovine serum albumin in bandshift buffer (60 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm EDTA, 150 mm KCl, 12% Ficoll). After 10 min, 12.5 fmol of a32P-labeled oligonucleotide (equivalent to approximately 50,000 cpm) was added in a total volume of 10 μl, incubated at room temperature for 15 min, and loaded onto 5% native polyacrylamide gels in 0.4 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer. Upon fractionation, gels were dried and exposed for autoradiography. The following oligonucleotides were used as labeled probes and unlabeled competitors, which were optionally added to the DNA-protein-binding reaction: DSE (wild type), 5′-TCTGAAACAGGAAACCAATACACTTCCTGTTTAATC-3′; DSE-Am, 5′-TCTGAAACAGGAAACCAATACACTTGGTGTTTAATC-3′; ERE-A (wild type), 5′-AATACACTTCCTGTTTAATC-3′; ERE-Am, 5′-AATACACTTGGTGTTTAATC-3′; ERE-Bm, 5′-TCTGAAACACCAAACCAATA-3′; ICP4 (GABP site), 5′-AGCTTGCGGAACGGAAGCGGAAACCGCCGGATCG-3′. For supershift EMSAs, 2 μg of purified preimmune serum or antiserum against GABP-α or GABP-β were incubated on ice with 2 μg of nuclear extracts for 20 min before adding the labeled DSE oligonucleotides. The DNA-protein complexes were separated on 4% native polyacrylamide gels. Overexpression of SPRK/MLK3 activates JNK/SAPK and p38 via SEK and MKK6, respectively, in COS1 and HEK-293 cells (17Tibbles L.A. Ing Y.L. Kiefer F. Chan J. Iscove N. Woodgett J.R. Lassam N.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7026-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). We investigated the effects of these stress pathways on the DSE activity in the CD4 positive T cell line A3.01 using a four-copy DSE cloned in front of a minimal thymidine kinase (tk) promoter construct in transient transfection assays. Compared with vector control, the DSE activity increased 28-fold when SPRK/MLK3 was cotransfected (Fig. 1 A). As a positive control, we stimulated A3.01 cells with TPA/ionomycin, which lead to IL-2 secretion (data not shown) and resulted in a 16-fold induction of the DSE activity (Fig. 1 A). Mutations of the GGAA-Ets-core motifs of the DSE abolished both the SPRK/MLK3 as well as TPA/ionomycin-induced DSE activity (Fig. 1). These data demonstrate that overexpression of SPRK/MLK3 can induce DSE transactivation via the Ets-core binding motifs. We next investigated the effects of stress kinase cascades on the DSE activity in more detail. Because TPA/ionomycin triggers JNK/SAPK activity in Jurkat cells and thymocytes (2Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar) and strongly induces DSE activity in A3.01 T cells, we measured the stimulation of the different MAPKs in A3.01 cells. Immune complex kinase assays were performed with endogenous ERK, JNK1, and p38 of unstimulated or stimulated A3.01 cells. TPA led to a strong activation of ERK, which could not be further enhanced by ionomycin (Fig. 2 A, upper panel). JNK1 was only 5-fold activated by TPA; ionomycin alone had no activating effect. Costimulation with TPA/ionomycin led to a strong synergistic activation (Fig. 2 A, middle panel). Interestingly, p38 showed a similar pattern of regulation as JNK, as it was only modestly activated by TPA and synergistically by TPA plus ionomycin (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). Thus, all three MAPKs are strongly activated under TPA/ionomycin costimulation. To dissect the contribution of each MAPK pathway to the regulation of the DSE, we tested constitutively active kinases to activate ERK, JNK/SAPK, and p38 in A3.01 cells. MKK6 (EE), which has the two activating phosphorylation sites replaced by glutamic acid residues rendering it to a constitutively active kinase (21Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar), stimulates p38 activity in A3.01 T cells (Fig. 2 B, lane 5). In contrast to the data of Tibbles et al. (17Tibbles L.A. Ing Y.L. Kiefer F. Chan J. Iscove N. Woodgett J.R. Lassam N.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7026-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) observed in COS1 and HEK-293 cells, overexpression of SPRK/MLK3 in A3.01 cells only activates JNK/SAPK and has no effect on p38 or ERK activity (Fig. 2 B, lane 4). The kinase domain of Raf (Raf-BXB) has been shown to be constitutively active in diverse cell lines such as NIH-3T3, HEK-293, and COS cells. However, it is only slightly active in T cells but can be strongly activated upon TPA stimulation (3Whitehurst C.E. Geppert T.D. J Immunol. 1996; 156: 1020-1029PubMed Google Scholar,43Whitehurst C.E.

The structural and functional implications of nucleotide binding to the CCT complex was addressed by electron microscopy and image processing. Whereas ADP binding to CCT does not reveal major conformational differences when compared with nucleotide-free CCT, ATP binding induces large conformational changes in the apical and equatorial domains, shifting the latter domains up to 40 ° (with respect to the inter-ring plane) compared with 10 ° for nucleotide-free CCT or ADP-CCT. This equatorial ATP-induced shift has no counterpart in GroEL, its prokaryotic homologue, which suggests differences in the folding mechanism for CCT.

This equatorial ATP-induced shift has no counterpart in GroEL, its prokaryotic homologue, which suggests differences in the folding mechanism for CCT. Chaperonins are ubiquitous oligomeric double-ring assemblies that mediate ATP-dependent protein folding, both in vivo and in vitro, through the binding of unfolded or misfolded polypeptides followed by their subsequent release into a folded or “committed to fold” conformation (1Ellis R.J. Van der Vies S.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 321-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Chaperonins are classified into two distinct groups (3Willison K.R. Kubota H. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 299-312Google Scholar): group I (GroEL-like), present in eubacteria and endosymbiotic organelles, and group II (CCT/TF55), present in archeabacteria and the eukaryotic cytosol (4Kim S. Willison K. Horwich A.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 543-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 5Gupta R.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Both groups share limited but significant sequence homology (4Kim S. Willison K. Horwich A.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 543-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 5Gupta R.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 6Kubota H. Hynes G. Willison K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar).Bacterial GroEL is the most studied chaperonin from the biochemical and structural viewpoint. The three-dimensional structure of GroEL at atomic resolution (7Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar) and the changes it undergoes upon binding of ADP and its co-chaperonin, GroES (8Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar) are known. Compared with GroEL, there is a relative paucity of structural information relating to CCT (chaperonin-containing TCP-1). 1The abbreviations used are: AMP-PNP, adenylyl-imidodiphosphate; CCT, chaperonin-containing TCP-1 complex; EM, electron microscopy. 1The abbreviations used are: AMP-PNP, adenylyl-imidodiphosphate; CCT, chaperonin-containing TCP-1 complex; EM, electron microscopy. Unlike GroEL, a homo-oligomeric complex composed of two stacked 7-mer rings, CCT is a hetero-oligomer assembled into two rings each composed of eight different subunits (9Gao Y. Thomas J.O. Chow R.L. Lee G.-H. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1043-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 10Lewis V.A. Hynes G.M. Zheng D. Saibil H. Willison K. Nature. 1992; 358: 252-259Crossref Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 11Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 364-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Substrate-wise, GroEL is relatively nonspecific and mediates the folding of a wide variety of proteins, whereas CCT is more specific, specializing in the folding of the cytoskeletal proteins, actin and tubulin (5Gupta R.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Similar to GroEL, CCT binds non-native forms of these substrates, which in the presence of ATP are discharged in a state committed toward the native fold (12Farr G.W. Scharl E.C. Schumcher R.J. Sondek S. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar).Despite these similarities, there is growing evidence that CCT mediates the folding of substrates through a mechanism different from that of GroEL. For example, CCT folds substrates without the assistance of a co-chaperonin (which is essential in GroEL-mediated folding). It has also been shown that the group II archaeosome undergoes an ATP-dependent disassembly into free subunits during its functional cycle (13Quaite-Randall E. Trent J.D. Josephs R. Joachimiak A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 48: 28818-28823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and that CCT displays a nucleotide-dependent single ring disassembly and reassembly activity (14Liou A. McCormack E. Willison K.R. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379 (in press)Google Scholar). Recently, the discovery of a novel helix-turn-helix motif in the crystal structure of the apical domain of the thermosome (15Klumpp M. Baumeister W. Essen L.O. Cell. 1997; 91: 263-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), which seems to be characteristic of all group II chaperonins, has been suggested to have a role in substrate binding and to act as a co-chaperonin in controlling the access of the substrate to the cavity. Hence, many questions remain to be answered with respect to the CCT reaction cycle.The conformational analysis of nucleotide-bound GroEL by electron microscopy has provided valuable structural information on the molecular mechanism of the GroEL reaction cycle (16Roseman A.M. Chen S. White H. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Cell. 1996; 87: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 17Llorca O. Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 118: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy (EM) of negatively stained specimens is a powerful technique for studying both the structural and conformational changes at medium to low resolution (20–30 Å) of large oligomeric complexes. One of its advantages is that it provides a high contrast background that allows images to be observed at very low underfocus values without significant loss of contrast, thereby extending the resolution of the structural details to the limits set by the contrasting reagent, normally 10–15 Å (18Hoenger A. Aebi U. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 117: 99-116Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The use of negative staining also has disadvantages, the most important being the non-imaging of internal protein structures that are inaccessible to heavy metal salts (i.e. virus). Fortunately, the structures of many of the chaperonins are quite open and porous, with large openings (entrance of the cavity and portals; see Ref. 7Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar) where the heavy metal salts can penetrate and contrast the internal regions. In the case of GroEL, this technique has revealed the structures of GroEL, GroEL-GroES asymmetric (19Langer T. Pfeifer G. Martin J. Baumeister W. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4757-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), and symmetric complexes (20Llorca O. Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M.

Using the same methodology for GroEL (electron microscopy of negatively stained specimens followed by image processing), we have studied the conformational changes induced in CCT upon nucleotide binding and compared them with the well established changes occurring in GroEL.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTwo different orientations of nucleotide-free murine CCT are observed in the EM: a ring-shaped top view and a less frequent barrel-shaped side view (10Lewis V.A. Hynes G.M. Zheng D. Saibil H. Willison K. Nature. 1992; 358: 252-259Crossref Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 11Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 364-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). After processing, the average side view obtained (Fig. 1 A) is very similar, albeit at higher resolution, to that previously published (11Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 364-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and to those of the thermosome from Thermoplasma acidophilum (31Waldmann T. Nimmesgern E. Nitsch M. Peters J. Pfeifer G.

Nature. 1993; 361: 475-477Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar).The side views of CCT are similar to those of GroEL, which suggests that both chaperonins share the same domain architecture within each subunit (see Fig. 3, A and D). The crystal structure of GroEL reveals three domains within each subunit: the equatorial domain, which is involved in the inter- and intra-ring interactions and also contains the ATP binding site; the apical domain, which interacts with incoming substrate and with the co-chaperonin GroES; and the intermediate domain, which acts as a hinge region between the equatorial and intermediate domains (7Braig K.

These three domains can be unambiguously located in the side views of negatively stained GroEL (see Fig. 3 D). The projection shows four striations, two per GroEL ring, with the outer striations representing the mass projected by the apical domains and the inner striations representing those of the equatorial domains. The intermediate domain is located in the small mass connecting the outer part of the inner and outer striations. The CCT side view also shows two outer and two inner striations bound in the outside by a small mass that can be assigned to the apical, intermediate, and equatorial domains, respectively.Figure 3Comparative analysis of the conformational changes in CCT and GroEL.

The projection structure of the intermediate domain of CCT is bigger than that of GroEL, whereas the apical domains of CCT are smaller than their GroEL counterparts. However, the most significant differences between the structures lie in their equatorial domains. The equatorial mass in GroEL is evenly distributed throughout the inner striations (see Fig. 3 D), whereas the mass in CCT is concentrated mainly in the outer parts of the inner striations, with a protrusion pointing to the interior of the oligomer (Figs. 1 A and 3 A).The average image of the front view reveals, as described previously, eight well separated subunits comprising a ring of 150-Å diameter surrounding a cavity of approximately 50-Å diameter (Fig. 1 B). Each of the subunits displays a bilobal structure, a feature that has not been described for any other chaperonins studied to date. When CCT is stained with uranyl acetate (which results in less height contrast than the particles stained with a mixture of uranyl acetate and glucose), the average front image obtained reveals a particle without visible bilobes and with a larger cavity (result not shown). This indicates that the bilobes are located in the the equatorial domain, which is the widest part of each ring. Identical results were obtained with human CCT (results not shown), suggesting that the bilobal feature is a characteristic specific to the CCT subunits. The front view obtained in the absence of glucose also shows a larger cavity (result not shown), suggesting that the inner part of each subunit (stained in the presence of glucose) forms part of the equatorial domain, which correlates well with the barrel-shaped side views of CCT (Fig. 1 A).Apo-CCT was incubated with 5 mm of ADP and the side and front views independently processed (Fig. 1, C and D, respectively) and compared with nucleotide-free CCT. The average side view of ADP-CCT (Fig. 1 C) reveals that ADP binding does not induce any substantial change in the CCT structure at the resolution of this work (20 Å). The average front view of ADP-CCT (Fig. 1 D) shows similar features to its nucleotide-free counterpart, which confirms that no conformational changes are seen in CCT upon ADP binding.Nucleotide-free CCT was incubated with 5 mm ATP or 10 mm AMP-PNP to fill all the available nucleotide binding sites. Both front and side views of CCT were independently processed and classified (Fig. 2). As in the case of nucleotide-free CCT or ADP-CCT, side views were less frequent, but the presence of both types of nucleotides increased the frequency of their occurrence. The side view images in the presence of ATP (Fig. 2 A) or AMP-PNP (Fig. 2 B) are almost identical and show clear conformational changes when compared with nucleotide-free CCT (Fig. 1 A) or CCT-ADP (Fig. 1 C), in which no changes were detected. The side views are clearly asymmetric, with the lower ring differing slightly from those of the nucleotide-free sample (Fig. 1 A). The top ring reveals a large conformational change affecting both the apical and equatorial domains (Fig. 2,A and B). Therefore, under physiological concentrations of ATP or high levels of AMP-PNP CCT displays a large rearrangement in one of its rings (with some changes in the other).Figure 2Average images of front and side views of murine CCT incubated with ATP or AMP-PNP. Average side views of murine CCT incubated with ATP (A) or AMP-PNP (B).Panels C and D correspond to the average images of front views of the two homogeneous populations of CCT incubated with ATP obtained after particle classification. The number of particles and the final resolution for each average image are 846 and 22 Å (A), 811 and 23 Å (B), 2289 and 20 Å (C), and 1756 and 20 Å (D), respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In its folding cycle, GroEL displays a positive and concerted intra- and negative inter-ring co-operativity with respect to nucleotide binding, so that the double ring is in equilibrium between three different allosteric states: TT, TR, and RR (34Yifrach O. Horovitz A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 356-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In the case of CCT, Lin and Sherman (35Lin P. Sherman F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10780-10785Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) have examined genetic interactions between mutations in the ATP binding sites of four CCT subunits in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and have proposed a simple sequential mechanism of co-operative ATP binding and hydrolysis progressing in one direction around the CCT ring. Perhaps a consequence of such a mechanism is a difference in the inter-ring signaling behavior between GroEL and CCT. The fact that an asymmetric CCT particle is obtained, even at high AMP-PNP concentrations, can be explained in either of two ways: (i) only one ring binds nucleotide (equivalent to the TR state in GroEL) due to a highly negative co-operativity between the two rings or (ii) both rings bind nucleotide (equivalent to the RR state in GroEL), and the particle remains asymmetric due to inter-ring signaling.When CCT-ATP and CCT-AMP-PNP side views are compared with GroEL-ATP (Fig. 3), it is clear that the major conformational changes are occurring in the top rings of CCT, with changes in the equatorial domains and in the apical domains (Figs. 2,A and B, and 3 B). Previous work with ATP-bound GroEL, using the same methodology, showed major conformational changes in the apical domains of the projected images, which was later confirmed by x-ray crystallography. In the same way, and due to the similar topologies of GroEL and CCT, the enlargement of the cavity of the top ring upon ATP binding (Fig. 2 A and3 B) can be related to an upward and outward movement of the apical domains (Fig. 3 E). However, the most striking conformational change induced by ATP is localized in the the equatorial domains of the top ring of CCT, which undergo a large movement toward the intermediate domain, striking an angle of approximately 40 ° with the inter-ring plane (Fig. 3, B and C), a major shift compared with the angle of 10 ° found in nucleotide-free CCT (Fig. 3 A). This is a feature that has not been observed for GroEL upon ADP and GroES binding (8Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar).With GroEL, the apical domains experience dramatic outward and upward movements using the intermediate domain as a hinge and the equatorial domain as a platform (Fig. 3, E and F). The result of these changes in the apical domains of GroEL is to decrease the binding affinity toward substrate and to allow GroES binding so that the substrate is liberated into the cavity. The small conformational movements detected in the equatorial domains of GroEL, upon binding of ADP and GroES, are related to the allosteric signaling between the two rings of the oligomer, a mechanism that forms an integral part of the GroEL folding cycle. This suggests that the behavior of the apical and equatorial domains of CCT upon ATP or AMP-PNP binding may represent some differences in mechanism compared with the functional cycle of GroEL.The fact that ATP binding induces large conformational changes in both the apical and equatorial domains, suggests that the CCT protein folding cycle requires not only changes in the apical domains but also major inter-ring movements, which may lead to subunit disassembly. This phenomenon has been observed as part of the folding cycle of the archaeosome from Sulfolobus shibatae (13Quaite-Randall E. Trent J.D. Josephs R. Joachimiak A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 48: 28818-28823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (44) Google Scholar). When the structure of the apical domains of GroEL (7Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar) and the thermosome from T. acidophilum (15Klumpp M. Baumeister W. Essen L.O. Cell. 1997; 91: 263-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) are compared, it is observed that the thermosome lacks two helices (helix 11 and 12) present in GroEL. This region of GroEL contains six important contacts between the apical domain and the equatorial domain of the adjacent subunit, suggesting that these interactions are weaker in group II chaperonins.Front views of CCT-ATP or CCT-AMP-PNP were also aligned, processed, and classified. In both cases, the image processing generated two different homogeneous populations for CCT-ATP (Fig. 2, C and D) and CCT-AMP-PNP (results not shown; similar to CCT-ATP). One of the average images (Fig. 2 C) is very similar to that of nucleotide-free CCT (Fig. 1 B); however, the second average image (Fig. 2 D) appears different from the others (Figs. 1 B and 2 C). The outer parts of the bilobal subunits are well contrasted, whereas the inner parts are not. This could be the result of the asymmetric CCT-ATP particle contacting the grid with either the slightly modified (Fig. 2 C) or with the highly modified ring (Fig. 2 D). The mix of uranyl acetate and glucose contrasts only one of the rings and is therefore capable of detecting the asymmetry of the particle (unlike the projections obtained from frozen-hydrated specimens). Hence, in the first image the mass observed in the bottom ring is the projection of the apical, intermediate, and equatorial domains of the slightly modified ring (Fig. 2, A and B). In the second image, the movement of the apical and equatorial domains toward the outer part of the ring (top rings, Fig. 2, A and B) concentrates the contrast in this region, resulting in a less contrasted inner area that corresponds to the central part of the equatorial domains. The asymmetry of the CCT-ATP (or CCT-AMP-PNP) side views correlates with the appearance of two distinct front views and explains why only one population is seen with nucleotide-free CCT (Fig. 1 B) or with CCT-ADP particles (Fig. 1 D) when subjected to the same classification procedures.Previous experiments have suggested that ATP binding to CCT may cause conformational changes due to the increase of side views detected by EM (9Gao Y. Thomas J.O. Chow R.L. Lee G.-H. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1043-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 11Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 364-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Also, non-denaturing isoelectric focussing analysis of CCT suggests that there are two distinct CCT populations (36Hynes G. Kubota H. Willison K.R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). More recently, biochemical analyses have also pointed to major conformational changes in the presence of ATP (37Melki R. Batelier G. Soulié S. Williams Jr, R.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5817-5826Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The present EM characterization of the CCT complex is the first report of the asymmetry induced in CCT upon ATP binding and gives the first glimpse of the nature of the ATP-induced conformational changes and their functional implications in the mechanism of action of this complex folding machine. Chaperonins are ubiquitous oligomeric double-ring assemblies that mediate ATP-dependent protein folding, both in vivo and in vitro, through the binding of unfolded or misfolded polypeptides followed by their subsequent release into a folded or “committed to fold” conformation (1Ellis R.J. Van der Vies S.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 321-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Chaperonins are classified into two distinct groups (3Willison K.R. Kubota H. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 299-312Google Scholar): group I (GroEL-like), present in eubacteria and endosymbiotic organelles, and group II (CCT/TF55), present in archeabacteria and the eukaryotic cytosol (4Kim S. Willison K. Horwich A.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 543-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 5Gupta R.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Both groups share limited but significant sequence homology (4Kim S. Willison K. Horwich A.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 543-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 5Gupta R.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 6Kubota H. Hynes G. Willison K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Bacterial GroEL is the most studied chaperonin from the biochemical and structural viewpoint. The three-dimensional structure of GroEL at atomic resolution (7Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar) and the changes it undergoes upon binding of ADP and its co-chaperonin, GroES (8Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar) are known. Compared with GroEL, there is a relative paucity of structural information relating to CCT (chaperonin-containing TCP-1). 1The abbreviations used are: AMP-PNP, adenylyl-imidodiphosphate; CCT, chaperonin-containing TCP-1 complex; EM, electron microscopy. 1The abbreviations used are: AMP-PNP, adenylyl-imidodiphosphate; CCT, chaperonin-containing TCP-1 complex; EM, electron microscopy. Unlike GroEL, a homo-oligomeric complex composed of two stacked 7-mer rings, CCT is a hetero-oligomer assembled into two rings each composed of eight different subunits (9Gao Y. Thomas J.O. Chow R.L. Lee G.-H. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1043-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 10Lewis V.A. Hynes G.M. Zheng D. Saibil H. Willison K.

Substrate-wise, GroEL is relatively nonspecific and mediates the folding of a wide variety of proteins, whereas CCT is more specific, specializing in the folding of the cytoskeletal proteins, actin and tubulin (5Gupta R.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Similar to GroEL, CCT binds non-native forms of these substrates, which in the presence of ATP are discharged in a state committed toward the native fold (12Farr G.W. Scharl E.C. Schumcher R.J. Sondek S. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Despite these similarities, there is growing evidence that CCT mediates the folding of substrates through a mechanism different from that of GroEL. For example, CCT folds substrates without the assistance of a co-chaperonin (which is essential in GroEL-mediated folding). It has also been shown that the group II archaeosome undergoes an ATP-dependent disassembly into free subunits during its functional cycle (13Quaite-Randall E. Trent J.D. Josephs R. Joachimiak A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 48: 28818-28823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and that CCT displays a nucleotide-dependent single ring disassembly and reassembly activity (14Liou A. McCormack E. Willison K.R. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379 (in press)Google Scholar).

This report shows that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-RT can also cleave the template strand of dsDNA when Mg2+ is replaced by Fe2+ in the RNase H active site of HIV-RT. The cleavage mechanisms as well as the positions of the cut vary depending on whether RNA or DNA is used. While DNA is cleaved 17 base positions upstream of the primer 3′-end, RNA is cleaved 18 base positions upstream. Competition experiments show that Fe2+ replaces the catalytically active Mg2+ of RT-associated RNase H. The bound Fe2+ is the source of locally generated OH-radicals that cleave the most proximate base in the DNA. Electrophoretic mobility studies of the cleaved fragments suggest that DNA is cleaved by an oxidative mechanism, while RNA is cleaved by an enzymatic mechanism which is indistinguishable from the Mg2+-dependent cleavage. The Fe2+-dependent cuts can be used to trace the active site of RT-associated RNase H on dsDNA as well as on dsRNA and DNA/RNA hybrids. The observed 1 base difference in the cleavage positions on DNA and RNA templates can be attributed to conformational differences of the bound nucleic acids. We suggest that the lower pitch of dsRNA and DNA/RNA hybrids compared with dsDNA permits accommodation of an additional base pair in the region between the primer 3′-end and the Fe2+-dependent cleavage position at the RNase H active site.

Retroviral reverse transcriptases (RTs) 1The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcriptase; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; RNase H, ribonuclease H; dNTP, 3′-deoxynucleoside triphosphate; ddNTP, 2′,3′-dideoxynucleoside triphosphate; OH-radicals, hydroxyl radicals; DTT, dithiothreitol; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. are multifunctional enzymes having an RNA-dependent and a DNA-dependent polymerase activity and a ribonuclease H (RNase H) activity, which degrades the RNA strand of RNA/DNA hybrids (1Skalka A.-M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993Google Scholar). These activities facilitate the conversion of single-stranded genomic RNA to the double-stranded proviral DNA which is integrated into the host genome. Synthesis of the first DNA strand, the minus strand DNA, is initiated from a cellular tRNA which binds with its 3′ terminus to the complementary primer-binding site near the 5′-end of the viral RNA (2Litvak S.

Prerequisite for the plus-strand synthesis is removal of the viral RNA from the minus-strand DNA. Both activities act simultaneously, presupposing a spatial and temporal interdependence of the active sites. The interplay of the two activities has been studied extensively in RT of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) (5Wöhrl B.M. Moelling K.

A. 1992; 89: 10763-10767Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) suggested a temporal coordination of the two activities due to kinetic coupling. Cleavage can occur if the rate of DNA polymerization is lower than the rate of RNA hydrolysis. A similar concept might also explain the resistance of dsRNA toward cleavage. It has been shown that dsRNA formed by the tRNALys-3 and the viral RNA during initiation of minus-strand synthesis remains intact during DNA synthesis, but is cleaved, if the DNA synthesis is artificially stopped through use of chain terminating nucleotides (9Götte M.

This can be explained by the fact that the rate of polymerization is higher than the rate of RNA template hydrolysis of dsRNA in line with the kinetic coupling model (9Götte M. Fackler S. Hermann T.

Ribonuclease activity on dsRNA, which is believed to be mediated by the active site of the RNase H domain (9Götte M. Fackler S. Hermann T. Perola E. Cellai L. Gross H.J. Le Grice S.F.J. Heumann H.

Virol. 1994; 68: 1970-1971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The high resolution crystallographic model of an RT-dsDNA primer/template complex has revealed that the space between the polymerization site and the RNase H site can be filled by a primer/template of 17 or 18 bases (17Jacobo-Molina A.

In the present study a biochemical approach has been applied, namely site-specific hydroxyl radical cleavage to localize the active site of HIV-1 RT-associated RNase H domain on a DNA template. This approach is based on findings by Metzger et al. (18Metzger W. Hermann T. Schatz O. Le Grice S.F.J. Heumann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This cleavage reaction requires an intact RNase H domain, since hyperreactivity was not observed with an RNase H-deficient enzyme (HIV-1 RT(E478Q)), whose ability to bind divalent metal ions is supposed to be suppressed (19Schatz O. Cromme F.V. Grüninger-Leitch F. Le Grice S.F.J. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Hyperreactivity was previously interpreted as an enhanced accessibility of the template due to a putative conformational change of the DNA induced by the RNase H domain (18Metzger W. Hermann T. Schatz O. Le Grice S.F.J. Heumann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5909-5913Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This report shows that hyperreactivity is due to site-specific generated hydroxyl radicals released by Fe2+-ions after replacement of Mg2+ at the RNase H active site. Heterodimeric HIV-1 RT (p66/p51) and the RNase H-deficient mutant enzyme (p66E478Q/p51) were prepared by metal chelate and ion exchange chromatography from Escherichia coli strains M15::pDM1.1::pRT6H-PR (32Le Grice S.F.J. Grüninger-Leitch F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 178: 307-314Crossref Scopus (299) Google Scholar) and M15::pDM1.1::pRT6HGlu → Gln-PR, respectively (6Schatz O. Mous J. Le Grice S.F.J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1171-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), as described previously (32Le Grice S.F.J. Grüninger-Leitch F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 178: 307-314Crossref Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The concentration of RT was determined by A 280 measurements using an extinction coefficient of ε280 nm = 1.4 mg/ml cm−1. RT preparations were stored at −20 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane, and 50% glycerol. Since glycerol scavenges hydroxyl radicals, RT preparations were dialyzed for 1 h against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl before incubating with the primer/template substrate (see below). DNA was chemically synthesized using the phosphoamidite method. To remove impurities, oligonucleotides were electrophoretically purified using 12% polyacrylamide, 7 murea gels containing 50 mm Tris borate, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA. DNA was visualized by UV shadowing at 254 nm and the fragment of correct length was eluted from excised gel slices with 0.5 m ammonium acetate, pH 6.5, 0.1% SDS. After ethanol precipitation, concentration of nucleic acids was determined spectrophotometrically. RNA (designated as primer-binding site 1 by Götte et al. (9Götte M. Fackler S. Hermann T. Perola E. Cellai L. Gross H.J. Le Grice S.F.J. Heumann H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 833-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was synthesized by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase. Purification of the transcript was achieved as described above. tRNALys-3 with the anticodon SUU (S = 5-methoxycarbonyl-2-thiouridine) was isolated from rabbit liver and purified following the procedure from Raba et al. (33Raba M. Limburg K. Burghagen M. Katze J.R. Simsek M. Heckmann J.E. RajBhandary U.L. Gross H.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 97: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). End labeling of dephosphorylated RNA transcript and the DNA template was conducted with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. 3′-End labeling with [32P]pCp and T4 RNA ligase (Pharmacia) was carried out as described (36Bruce A.G. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 3665-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). To ensure homogeneity, labeled nucleic acids were again electrophoretically purified. To achieve quantitative complex formation, primer/template sequences were hybridized before incubating with the enzyme. Annealing was conducted in a reaction volume of 10 ml. A mixture of 100 nm (final concentration) unlabeled DNA template, 50,000 cpm of 5′-end-labeled template, and 150 nmDNA primer in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl was heated to 90 °C for 1 min followed by incubation at 60 °C for 10 min and cooling for 20 min to room temperature. Complete hybridization was confirmed by analyzing aliquots of the annealed duplexes on native polyacrylamide gels containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm NaCl. The tRNALys-3/RNA homoduplex and the DNA/RNA heteroduplex were prepared analogously. In a reaction volume of 20 ml, pre-annealed primer/template substrates (100 nm) were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C with HIV-RT (150 nm) or the RNase H-deficient enzyme, respectively, in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl. Polymerization was then initiated by addition of MgCl2 (6 mm) and the appropriate dNTP (100 mm)/ddNTP (500 mm) mixture permitting primer extension by 1, 3, 9, and 18 nucleotides. Under these reaction conditions 95% of the primer is correctly elongated after 10 min. Fe2+-dependent incorporation of ddATP was initiated by addition of 0.4 mm Fe2+. The standard hydroxyl radical footprinting using the modified Fenton reaction was performed essentially as recently described (22Tullius T. Dombroski B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5469-5473Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 25Götte M. Marquet R. Isel C. Anderson V.E. Keith G. Gross H.J. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Heumann H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 226-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Pre-formed RT-primer-template complexes were incubated in a total reaction volume of 25 ml with a mixture of Fe(NH4)SO4·6H2O (400 μm), EDTA (800 μm), 5 mm DTT, and 0.05% H2O2. To characterize the influence of liganded versus unliganded Fe2+ on the cleavage profile we changed the ratio of free Fe2+ and [Fe(EDTA)]2− by varying the EDTA concentration from 0 to 4 mm while keeping the concentration of all other reaction components constant (Fig. 1). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 5 min at 37 °C and stopped with 40 ml of a solution containing 0.1 m thiourea, 200 ng of tRNA, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.6 m sodium acetate. Samples were subsequently precipitated with ethanol and loaded on a 12% polyacrylamide-urea gel. Products were visualized using a PhosphorImager or by autoradiography overnight. A stable alkaline solution of ONOOK, pH 12.5, was synthesized as described (24King P.A. Jamison E. Strahs D. Anderson V.E. Brenowitz M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2473-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The ONOOK concentration was determined as 60 mm by absorbance measurement at 302 nm using an extinction coefficient of ε302 nm = 1670m−1 cm−1. The peroxonitrite solution was stored at −80 °C and thawed prior to use. Cleavage reactions with ONOOK were conducted by adding 1 ml of the peroxonitrite solution to the sample solution buffered at pH 7 (24King P.A. Jamison E. Strahs D. Anderson V.E. Brenowitz M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2473-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 25Götte M. Marquet R. Isel C. Anderson V.E. Keith G. Gross H.J. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Heumann H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 226-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). RT-primer-template complexes were prepared in a buffer containing 80 mm sodium kakodylate, pH 7, and 20 mm NaCl. Reactions were stopped and analyzed essentially as described above. Pre-formed RT-primer-template complexes in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, and 6 mm MgCl2 were incubated in a total reaction volume of 25 μl with a mixture of Fe(NH4)SO4·6H2O (40 μm) and 5 mm DTT. The reaction proceeds for 10 min at 37 °C and was stopped as described in the previous paragraph. Replacement of Mg2+ at the active site of RT-associated RNase H domain by Fe2+ was studied by applying MgCl2 in a concentration range from 0 to 10 mm and by keeping the Fe(NH4)SO4·6H2O concentration constant. The size of the Fe2+-dependent cleavage products was assigned by a T-ladder generated after modifying the DNA with OsO4/bipyridine followed by cleaving the sugar-phosphate backbone with piperidine. RNase H* activity was monitored on the preformed RT-tRNALys-3·RNA complex in the presence of 6 mm MgCl2 (9Götte M. Fackler S. Hermann T. Perola E. Cellai L. Gross H.J. Le Grice S.F.J. Heumann H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 833-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). RNase H activity was monitored analogously using the heteroduplex shown in Fig. 6 B. To characterize cleavage specificity with Fe2+ the complex was incubated in the absence of MgCl2 using various concentrations of Fe(NH4)SO4·6H2O (40–400 μm). The band intensities of the cleavage products did not depend on the presence of a reducing agent, such as DTT (data not shown). RNA fragment sizes were assigned using a homogeneous RNA ladder generated by partial alkaline hydrolysis with Na2CO3/NaHCO3, pH 9.5, and a G-ladder obtained by partial digestion of the RNA with ribonuclease T1. To analyze the Fe2+-dependent hydroxyl radical cleavage products in the protein HIV-RT, dsRNA and dsDNA primer/template (concentration = 100 nm) was incubated with equal amounts of RT (the wild type and the RNase H-deficient enzyme, respectively). In a reaction volume of 20 μl, RT and primer/template were incubated with ddATP permitting elongation of the primer by one nucleotide. The complex was subjected to Fe2+ treatment (0.4 mmFe(NH4)SO4·6H2O) at 37 °C for 10 min in the presence of 5 mm DTT. The reactions were stopped by adding 1 volume of SDS-PAGE application buffer. The reaction mixture was heated for 5 min at 95 °C and loaded on a 12% SDS-PAGE (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. To compare the hyperreactive cleavages on a DNA template with the RNase H-induced cuts recently obtained on an RNA template (9Götte M. Fackler S. Hermann T. Perola E. Cellai L. Gross H.J. Le Grice S.F.J. Heumann H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 833-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we used a dsDNA fragment having the same sequence (Fig. 1 A). Complexes of primer/template DNA and HIV-RT were formed and subjected to [Fe(EDTA)]2−-dependent OH-radical treatment, as described under “Methods.” Lane 3 in Fig. 1 B shows the OH-radical footprint of HIV-1 RT that was obtained using 5′-end-labeled DNA template. The schematic representation of the footprint in Fig. 1 A indicates the contacts between HIV-RT and template. The region covered by HIV-RT reaches from base position +4 to −18 containing a window of accessibility around base position −10 and a region of hyperreactive cleavage at base positions −15 to −18. This pattern essentially agrees with that previously published by Metzger et al.(18Metzger W. Hermann T. Schatz O. Le Grice S.F.J. Heumann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5909-5913Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, that the observed hyperreactivity reflects an enhanced accessibility of the template DNA due to an RNase H-induced distortion of the template does not seem to be convincing. An accessibility which exceeds that of free DNA is difficult to envision. Therefore, we investigated whether the hypercleavage could be due to another reason. It was previously shown with other Mg2+-binding proteins such as tetracycline repressor (20Ettner N. Metzger J.W. Lederer T. Hulmes J.D. Kisker C. Hinrichs W. Ellestad G.A. Hillen W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and E. coli RNA polymerase (21Zaychikov E. Martin E. Denissova L. Kozlov M. Markotsov V. Kashlev M. Heumann H. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Mustaev A. Science. 1996; 273: 107-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) that Fe2+ can replace Mg2+ and generate site-specific OH-radicals which cleave the DNA. Whether this mechanism is also applicable to the catalytic Mg2+ of the RT-associated RNase H, is discussed below. In a typical OH-radical footprinting experiment, the Fenton reaction is used for generating OH-radicals which cleave the DNA (Fig. 2 A). The OH-radicals most likely attack the nucleotide sugars at the C-1 and C-4 positions, leading to excision of the base. EDTA is used in a 2-fold excess over Fe2+. Thus the negatively charged [Fe(EDTA)]2− complex is obtained which prevents interaction of iron with the sugar phosphate backbone of the DNA (22Tullius T. Dombroski B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5469-5473Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The Fe2+-dependent OH-radical footprint then reflects the accessibility of DNA toward diffusable OH-radicals generated by the metal complex. Hyperreactive cleavage is observed only when Fe2+ is in excess. The role of excess Fe2+ was analyzed by shifting the equilibrium between Fe2+ and [Fe(EDTA)]2− in the Fenton reaction. This was achieved by varying the EDTA concentration (see Fig. 2 A). Fig. 1 A depicts the footprints of HIV-RT obtained at different EDTA concentrations. The intensity of the hypersensitive cuts centered at base position −16 decreases in step with increasing EDTA concentration. At a 10-fold molar excess of EDTA over Fe2+(lane 5 in Fig. 1 B) no hypercleavage is observed. Comparison of the footprints in lane 5 with those in lanes 1-4 shows that hypercleavage occurs within the fully protected region. The strongest cuts are seen in the absence of EDTA (lane 1 in Fig. 1 B). This result shows that hyperreactivity is attributable to Fe2+, and not to the [Fe(EDTA)]2− complex. The role of Fe2+ in the hyperreactive cleavage reaction was analyzed using a different, Fe2+-free OH-radical source for footprinting, namely potassium peroxonitrite (ONOOK) (23King P.A. Anderson V.E.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 226-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The reaction scheme is depicted in Fig. 2 B. The free acid has been disproportionated at neutral pH facilitating generation of OH-radicals. Fig. 3 shows a comparison of footprints obtained with ONOOK and [Fe(EDTA)]2−, respectively. The latter was performed at high EDTA concentration to suppress hyperreactivity. The footprints obtained by both methods yield the same protected regions. The lack of enhanced cleavage at the RNase H position in the ONOOK footprint confirms that free Fe2+ is responsible for the enhanced cleavage activity. The slight cleavage enhancement visible in the ONOOK pattern at position −6 might be due to an interaction of the protein with an active intermediate generated when disproportionating ONOOK (25Götte M. Marquet R. Isel C. Anderson V.E. Keith G. Gross H.J. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Heumann H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 226-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To prove that hypercleavage is due to a replacement of Mg2+, a competition experiment using wild type RT as well as the RNase H-deficient RT(E478Q) mutant enzyme was performed as described under “Methods.” Fe2+ was kept constant and the Mg2+ concentration was varied. To obtain cleavage at a single position the standard conditions were slightly changed. EDTA was omitted and the concentration of Fe2+ was reduced from 400 to 40 μm. Due to these changes only hypercleavage at position −17 and no OH-radical footprint was observed in contrast to the previously shown Fe2+ assays (Figs. 1 and 3). The result of the Fe2+/Mg2+ competition experiment is shown in Fig. 4. The yield of hypercleavage decreases with increasing Mg2+ concentration indicating that Mg2+ displaces Fe2+. The hypercleavage reaction in the [Fe(EDTA)]2− assay was dramatically reduced, but not to zero (Fig. 4), when the RNase H− RT mutant (E478Q) (19Schatz O. Cromme F.V. Grüninger-Leitch F. Le Grice S.F.J. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) was used. The crystal structure model of the RNase H domain (26Davies J.F., II Hostomska Z. Hostomsky Z. Jordan S.R. Matthews D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) indicates that the amino acid replacement in the mutant leads to a reduced affinity of the catalytically active Mg2+. This crystallographic finding along with our result that the same mutation in the RNase H affects the affinity for Fe2+, as well as for Mg2+, suggests that the binding sites for both ions are overlapping, if not identical. To determine the exact position of the hypersensitive cut, HIV-1 RT was arrested at different positions during synthesis by using an incomplete set of dNTPs along with a chain terminating ddNTP (Ref.18Metzger W. Hermann T. Schatz O. Le Grice S.F.J. Heumann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5909-5913Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, “Experimental Procedures”). After the primer was specifically extended by 1, 3, 9, and 18 nucleotides (Fig. 5 A), complexes were subjected to treatment with Fe2+-generated OH-radicals. Determination of the cleavage position was facilitated by lowering the concentration of Fe2+ so that only a single nucleotide was cleaved. The cleavage positions were assigned by means of a T-ladder. Thymidines of the single-stranded template strand were modified by OsO4-bipyridine, followed by strand scission with piperidine, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The pattern in Fig. 5 B and the schematic representation in Fig. 5 A shows that the template DNA strand is cleaved 17 base positions upstream of the primer 3′-end in all registers, indicating that the 17-base distance is sequence-independent. The 15-base pair distance previously described by Metzger et al. (18Metzger W. Hermann T. Schatz O. Le Grice S.F.J. Heumann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5909-5913Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) can be ascribed to an error in their base assignment. In that study higher [Fe(EDTA)]2− concentrations were used, resulting in a larger spread of the cleaved nucleotides (see also Fig. 1 B, lanes 1 to 3). We conclude from the above finding that the Fe2+-dependent hyperreactive cut can be used to trace the position of the Mg2+-binding site of the RT-associated RNase H domain. Mg2+ is replaced by Fe2+, which can generate a high local concentration of OH-radicals, resulting in enhanced cleavage of the nucleotide next to the bound Fe2+. The assumption that hyperreactivity is mediated by an oxidative mechanism is supported by the finding that a reducing agent (DTT) is necessary to maintain cleavage (data not shown). Reduction of Fe2+ is a prerequisite for permanent generation of OH-radicals, as is the case for OH-radical production in solution by the [Fe(EDTA)]2−-dependent Fenton reaction (22Tullius T. Dombroski B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5469-5473Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Analysis of the electrophoretic mobility of the 5′-end-labeled cleavage products further confirms an oxidative cleavage mechanism. As depicted in Fig. 5 B, cleaved fragments migrate at the same position like the DNA fragments of the T-ladder. The latter was obtained by strand scission with piperidine, which gives rise to 3′-PO4groups as proposed for OH-radical cleavage (22Tullius T. Dombroski B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5469-5473Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 27Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (5456) Google Scholar). The observation that the Fe2+-dependent cut in different registers occurs at a constant distance from the primer 3′-end is reminiscent of the RNase H*-induced cuts obtained when analyzing complexes stalled on dsRNA during initiation of minus-strand synthesis (9Götte M. Fackler S. Hermann T. Perola E. Cellai L. Gross H.J. Le Grice S.F.J. Heumann H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 833-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These studies showed that the RNA template of the tRNALys-3/primer-binding site duplex was cleaved in the presence of Mg2+ 18-base positions upstream of the primer 3′ terminus, while DNA used in the present study was cleaved by the Fe"

CRK3 from cell extracts of the three life-cycle stages was found to bind p13suc1 and the leishmanial homologue p12cks1. CRK3 fused with six histidines at the C terminus was expressed in L. mexicana and shown to have SBCRK histone H1 kinase activity. Depletion of histidine-tagged CRK3 from L. mexicana cell extracts, by Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose selection, reduced histone H1 kinase activity binding to p13suc1. These data imply that crk3 encodes the kinase subunit of SBCRK.

In mammals, a large number of CDKs have been described, some of which have been shown to be directly involved in controlling cell cycle transitions, e.g. CDKs 1–4 and CDK6 (1Pines J. Biochem.

In contrast, yeast have only one CDK (Schizosaccharomyces pombe cdc2 or Saccharomyces cerevisiae CDC28), which is responsible for transition through both G1/S and G2/M boundaries (6Nurse P.

The activity of CDKs is controlled post-translationally by a number of different mechanisms: the association of the kinase subunit with its positive regulatory partner, one of the family of cyclins; phosphorylation of conserved sites which can stimulate or inhibit kinase activity; or binding of an inhibitory partner, a CDK inhibitor protein such as members of the p16ink4 or p21cip1 families (1Pines J.

EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3507-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 10Dunphy W.G. Brizuela L. Beach D. Newport J. Cell. 1988; 54: 423-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The function of these proteins in the kinase complex is as yet unknown but the high specificity with which they interact with cdc2 has been exploited in the affinity purification of cdc2 from a variety of organisms on p13suc1 -Sepharose (9Brizuela L. Draetta G. Beach D. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3507-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 11Tang L. Pelech S.L. Berger J.D. J. Eukaryot.

Members of the order Trypanosomatidae, which includes Leishmania and the closely related parasite Trypanosoma brucei, possess a large family of cdc2-related kinase genes, crk1–4 (13Brown L. Hines J.C. Ray D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5451-5456Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14Mottram J.C. Parasitol. Today. 1994; 10: 253-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 15Mottram J.C. Kinnaird J.H. Shiels B.R. Tait A. Barry J.D. J. Biol.

Gene. 1995; 162: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and thus in this respect appear to be more similar to multicellular organisms than to yeast. This is not surprising since, although it is unicellular,Leishmania has a complex life cycle during which the cell cycle is switched on and off as the parasite differentiates between proliferative forms (the promastigote in the sandfly midgut and the amastigote in the mammalian host) and the cell cycle arrested metacyclic stage, which is the human infective form found in the fly proboscis. Thus, there is an integral link between the cell cycle and the developmental life cycle of this parasite. The large evolutionary divergence between protozoa and yeast or higher eukaryotes has made it difficult to determine which of the trypanosomatid crk genes might be the functional cdc2 homologue, as each of the genes have a similar level of homology to yeast or human cdc2, and they do not complement yeast cdc2 temperature-sensitive mutants (15Mottram J.C. Kinnaird J.H. Shiels B.R. Tait A. Barry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21044-21052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Mottram J.C. Smith G. Gene. 1995; 162: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In Leishmania, one cdc2-related kinase gene has been described, crk1 (15Mottram J.C. Kinnaird J.H. Shiels B.R. Tait A. Barry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21044-21052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CRK1 protein was found in all leishmanial life cycle stages, but its histone H1 kinase activity was only detected in the promastigote and metacyclic forms, indicating post-translational control of kinase activity (15Mottram J.C. Kinnaird J.H. Shiels B.R. Tait A. Barry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21044-21052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence from gene-targeted disruption experiments indicated that the Leishmania mexicana crk1 gene is essential to the promastigote form of the parasite (17Mottram J.C. McCready B.P. Brown K.P. Grant K.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A distinct histone H1 kinase activity has been identified biochemically from L. mexicana(15Mottram J.C. Kinnaird J.H. Shiels B.R. Tait A. Barry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21044-21052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Mottram J.C. Grant K.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This activity, known as the suc-binding cdc2-related kinase (SBCRK), is thought to be a candidate for the functional cdc2 homologue from L. mexicana since it shares a number of attributes with cdc2 from other eukaryotic species: it binds the S. pombe protein p13suc1 and its L. mexicana homologue p12cks1; it phosphorylates the cdc2 substrate histone H1, and its activity correlates with the division status of the parasite, being active in the proliferative life cycle stages (promastigote and amastigote) and inactive in the cell cycle-arrested metacyclic stage (15Mottram J.C.

J. 1996; 316: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the closely related protozoan T. brucei, three crk genes have been cloned and analyzed (16Mottram J.C. Smith G. Gene. 1995; 162: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).tbcrk1–3 encode proteins of 34, 39, and 35 kDa, respectively, which share 49–54% sequence identity with human cdc2. Here, we describe a second crk gene from L. mexicana, crk3. This gene is single copy, is expressed in all leishmanial life cycle stages, and is closely related to the T. brucei crk3 gene. CRK3 has stage-regulated histone H1 kinase activity that binds p13suc1, features of the leishmanial SBCRK and mammalian cdc2. Leishmania mexicana mexicana(MNYC/BZ/62/M379) promastigotes were grown in HOMEM medium as described previously (17Mottram J.C. McCready B.P. Brown K.P. Grant K.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Promastigotes were harvested in the mid-log phase of growth (5–10 × 106 cells/ml). Metacyclic and axenic amastigote-like forms (ALFs) were grown in Schneider's Drosophila media at 25 and 32 °C, respectively, as described previously (19Mottram J.C. Frame M.J. Brooks D.R. Tetley L. Hutchison J.E. Souza A.E. Coombs G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14285-14293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Metacyclics were harvested in the stationary phase of growth (3–5 × 107 cells/ml), and ALFs were harvested in the mid-log phase of growth (5–10 × 106 cells/ml). Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were either used immediately or stored at −70 °C until required. A fragment of the crk3 gene was obtained by PCR using degenerate oligonucleotide primers designed to conserved regions of cdc2-related kinases and L. mexicana genomic DNA as described previously for the T. brucei crk3 gene (16Mottram J.C. Smith G. Gene. 1995; 162: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The full-length crk3 gene was isolated by screening an L. mexicana λ DashII genomic library as described previously (19Mottram J.C. Frame M.J. Brooks D.R. Tetley L. Hutchison J.E. Souza A.E. Coombs G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14285-14293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A 2-kb HindIII fragment containing the complete crk3 open reading frame (pGL89) was subcloned into Bluescript for sequencing. Southern and Northern blots were carried out as described previously (15Mottram J.C. Kinnaird J.H. Shiels B.R. Tait A. Barry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21044-21052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type L. mexicana DNA was isolated using a Nucleon kit (Scotlab, Coatbridge, Scotland). Poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated from the three life cycle stages of L. mexicana (mid-log promastigotes, stationary phase metacyclics, and axenic amastigotes) using the Oligotex Direct kit (QIAGEN Inc.). Two micrograms of poly(A)+ mRNA from each life cycle stage was separated by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis and blotted onto a nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (15Mottram J.C. Kinnaird J.H. Shiels B.R. Tait A. Barry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21044-21052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blots were hybridized at 42 °C for 20 h in 5× saline/sodium/phosphate/EDTA, 50% deionized formamide, 5× Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS and washed at 65 °C in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS. 30 ng of a 1.2-kb EcoRI/HindIII fragment from the plasmid clone pGL89 was labeled by random priming (Stratagene) and used to probe the Northern or Southern blots. A 600-base pair α-tubulin probe was used as a control (19Mottram J.C. Frame M.J. Brooks D.R. Tetley L. Hutchison J.E. Souza A.E. Coombs G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14285-14293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 12 amino acids of the predicted CRK3 sequence (CALQHPWFSDLRW) was synthesized (Genosys Biotechnologies Inc.). This peptide was conjugated to bovine serum albumin and used to immunize animals using standard immunization protocols (20Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 53-137Google Scholar). S-100 leishmanial cell lysates were prepared by resuspending cell pellets in lysis buffer (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (2.5 mm 1,10 phenanthroline, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 500 μg/ml Pefabloc SC), incubating on ice for 30 min, and then centrifuging at 100,000 × g, 4 °C for 45 min. The resultant supernatants (S-100 lysates) were used in p12cks1 /p13suc1 binding for immunoblotting and kinase assays. p12cks1 and control beads were prepared as described previously (18Mottram J.C. Grant K.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Recombinant p13suc1, with a six-histidine tag at the C-terminal end, was produced in a similar manner. The S. pombe suc1 gene was inserted into the pQE60 (QIAGEN Inc.) vector by constructing unique NcoI and BglII sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the coding region using PCR. The oligonucleotide primers used in the PCR reactions were as follows: 5′ primer, 5′-GCCCATGGCGAAAAGTGGTGTGC-3′; and 3′ primer, 5′-GCAGATCTACCACCCCGTTGTTGACT-3′ (restriction sites are underlined). The PCR reactions were for 15 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 42 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min using 20 ng of pRK172 plasmid (21Hayles J. Beach D. Durkacz B. Nurse P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 202: 291-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) as template and Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). PCR products of approximately 350 base pair were digested with NcoI and BglII, gel purified, and cloned into pQE60. One of the resultant clones (pGL70) was sequenced to ensure that no PCR-induced mutations had been introduced and then transformed into M15[pREP4] cells. Recombinant p13suc1 was then purified by nickel chelate (Ni-NTA) affinity chromatography and cross-linked to agarose beads (5 mg/ml), as described previously for p12cks1 (18Mottram J.C. Grant K.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). 50 μg of promastigote S-100 lysate (approximately 2 mg/ml) and 1 μg of 6-histidine-tagged CRK3 protein per lane were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto PVDF membrane. The membranes were then incubated with either blocking solution or blocking solution plus 0.2 mg/ml recombinant p12cks1 protein, for 90 min at room temperature. The blocking solution consisted of 10% horse serum, 5% low fat dried milk in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20). The membranes were then washed with TBST to remove unbound p12cks1 protein. The position of bound p12cks1 was detected by incubation with an anti-p12cks1 antibody at 1:50 dilution followed by an anti-rabbit secondary antibody and detection using the chemoluminescence system (18Mottram J.C. Grant K.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). 200 μl of S-100 lysates of wild-type L. mexicana (1.3 mg/ml) was incubated with 20 μl of p12cks1, p13suc1, or control agarose beads (previously preblocked with 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 3 h at 4 °C. Unbound proteins were then removed by extensive washing, as described previously (18Mottram J.C. Grant K.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in the presence of SDS and β-mercaptoethanol. Samples of the eluted proteins were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to PVDF (polyvinylidene difluoride) membrane. Western blots were performed, as described previously (18Mottram J.C. Grant K.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), with crude anti-CRK3 antiserum, used at 1:100 dilution (plus or minus 2 μg/ml blocking peptide). Antigens were detected using a chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce SuperSignal). The S-100 lysates were diluted to 0.4 mg/ml and incubated with 20 μl of p12cks1, p13suc1, or control beads as for immunoblotting above. Removal of nonspecifically bound protein and the histone H1 kinase assay were performed as described previously (15Mottram J.C. Kinnaird J.H. Shiels B.R. Tait A. Barry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21044-21052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Mottram J.C. Grant K.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated histone H1 was quantified by scintillation counting or by phosphorimaging. The crk3 gene was expressed in three Saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc28 temperature-sensitive alleles using the yeast vector pRS416-met (22Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). pRS416-met is a 2-μm based plasmid containing the URA3 gene as a selectable marker and a methionine repressible promoter to regulate expression levels. A 1.3-kb EcoRI/XhoI fragment, containing the full-length crk3 gene, was excised from pGL89, and cloned into the EcoRI/XhoI site of pRS416-met. Yeast were transformed with the resultant vector (pGL120) or a positive control plasmid, pBP120, containing the Caenorhabditis elegans ncc-1gene (23Mori H. Palmer R.E. Sternberg P.W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 781-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) using the lithium acetate method and clones tested for their ability to complement the temperature-sensitive mutant strains. Colonies were resuspended in 50 μl of distilled water, and 5 μl were added to YNB plates supplemented with appropriate amino acids, including methionine at 0, 50, 100, 200, 500, or 1000 μm, but lacking in uracil. One set of plates was incubated at the permissive temperature of 23 °C, the other at 37 °C. The temperature-sensitive mutant strains used were cdc28–13, cdc28–4, and cdc28-IN(24Lorincz A.T. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4099-4103Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To confirm that the crk3 gene was expressed in each of the yeast strains, Western blots were performed on yeast cell extracts with the anti-CRK3 peptide antisera. The crk3 gene was fused to a 6-histidine tag using the pQE60 vector (QIAGEN Inc.) by constructing unique NcoI and BglII sites on the 5′ and 3′ ends of the coding region using PCR with the plasmid clone pGL89 and the following primers (with engineered restriction sites underlined): 5′-GCCCATGGCTTCGTTTGGCCGTG-3′ and 5′-CGCAGATCTCCAACGAAGGTCGCTGAACC-3′. PCR was performed with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). The PCR product was digested with NcoI and BglII and cloned into NcoI/BglII-digested pQE60 to give the plasmid pGL91. This encodes CRK3 protein with a 6-histidine tag at the C-terminal end (WRSHHHHHH-COOH, where the underlined W is the last authentic CRK3 amino acid). The PCR-based cloning into pQE60 introduced a change in the CRK3 sequence at the second amino acid position, changing the authentic serine to an alanine residue (resulting in an inactive kinase). To subclone the crk3hisgene into the pX shuttle vector (25LeBowitz J.H. Coburn C.M. McMahon-Pratt D. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9736-9740Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and repair this amino acid change, the following protocol was used. An EcoRI/SstII fragment, corresponding to the 5′ end of the crk3 gene, was excised from the plasmid clone pGL89, and an SstII/HindIII fragment, corresponding to the 3′ end of the crk3his gene, was excised from the pGL91 plasmid. These two fragments were ligated together and cloned into BlueScript (pGL92). The repaired crk3his gene was then excised with SmaI and XhoI, the XhoI site was filled-in using Klenow, and the fragment was cloned into the shuttle vector, pXneo (25LeBowitz J.H. Coburn C.M. McMahon-Pratt D. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9736-9740Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), restricted with SmaI. A plasmid with the insert in the correct orientation was designated pGL95. Transfections were carried out as described previously (17Mottram J.C. McCready B.P. Brown K.P. Grant K.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 26Mottram J.C. Souza A.E. Hutchison J.E. Carter R. Frame M.J. Coombs G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6008-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The cell line expressing CRK3his from the pX vector in wild-type L. mexicana genetic background was named wt[pXCRK3his]. 1.5 ml of S-100 cell lysates were prepared from 1 × 108 L. mexicana or wt[pXCRK3his]. The extracts were made up to 50 mm imidazole and 500 μl incubated with 200 μl of Ni-NTA agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. Both the original lysate and the eluate from the column (CRK3-depleted) were then incubated with p13suc1 or control beads, as described above, and the bound protein was assayed for histone H1 kinase activity together with the washed Ni-NTA agarose beads. SBCRK was bound to p13suc1 beads, as described above, and eluted with 2 mg/ml free p13suc1. CRK3his was purified on Ni-NTA agarose, as described above, and eluted by incubation with 100 mm EDTA in lysis buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. CRK3his was then bound to p13suc1 beads and assayed in situ. Samples of enzyme were incubated with increasing concentrations of olomoucine (Alexis Corporation UK (Ltd)), and kinase activity was assayed as described. Recombinant human cdc2/cyclin B (New England Biolabs) was used as a positive control. The L. mexicana crk3 gene was isolated using the same PCR strategy and degenerate oligonucleotide primers that proved successful in the cloning of the T. brucei crk3 gene (16Mottram J.C. Smith G. Gene. 1995; 162: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The full-length gene (Fig. 1) was isolated from a λ Dash II genomic library (19Mottram J.C. Frame M.J. Brooks D.R. Tetley L. Hutchison J.E. Souza A.E. Coombs G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14285-14293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and subcloned into Bluescript on a 2-kb HindIII DNA fragment. Mapping of the λ clone revealed that a mitochondrial elongation factor G gene homologue was located about 3.5-kb downstream of crk3. Interestingly, a homologous gene is located immediately downstream of the crk3 gene in T. brucei (16Mottram J.C. Smith G. Gene. 1995; 162: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The predicted protein encoded by the leishmanial crk3 gene shows the greatest degree of homology to the cdc2 family of serine/threonine protein kinases when compared with protein sequence data bases. The predicted amino acid sequence is compared in Fig. 2 with that of human cdc2 and of the homologous proteins from T. brucei (TbCRK3) and from T. cruzi (TcCRK3). The three trypanosomatid CRK3s each have an unusual 19-amino acid N-terminal extension, when compared with human cdc2, that is not highly conserved in sequence and has only one conserved residue, an arginine at position 10. Overall, the leishmanial CRK3 has 78% identity with TbCRK3, 77% identity with TcCRK3, and 54% identity with human cdc2. The leishmanial CRK3 contains all the domains and residues characteristic of the serine/threonine protein kinase family. In addition, CRK3 also contains the conserved residues and domains which are important for the regulation of cdc2 activity. This includes equivalent residues to human cdc2 at Thr-14 and Tyr-15, in the ATP-binding domain, and Thr-161 (Fig. 2). These three residues are highly conserved both within the CDK family and between species. This implies that CRK3 activity may be controlled by similar post-translational mechanisms as exist in other eukaryotes (through a positively regulating kinase, wee1, and a negatively regulating phosphatase, cdc25), although no homologues of these regulatory enzymes have been identified in Leishmania to date.Figure 2Amino acid sequence alignment for trypanosomatid CRK3s in comparison to human cdc2.

The PSTAIRE box involved in cyclin binding in cdc2 is underlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The “PSTAIRE” box, consisting of the 16-amino acid sequence EGVPSTAIREISLLKE, is a highly conserved domain thought to be involved in the recognition and binding of the cyclin partner (27Ducommun B. Brambilla P. Draetta G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6177-6184Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 28Endicott J.A. Nurse P. Johnson L.N.

Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). The corresponding domain in the leishmanial CRK3 (EGIPQTALREVSILQE) has six substitutions in comparison with Hscdc2 (see Fig. 2) and is highly conserved with the trypanosome CRK3 homologues. The presence of this domain in the leishmanial kinase suggests that cyclin binding may play an important regulatory role, although again no cyclin homologues have been identified in Leishmania. Cyclin genes have, however, been isolated from T. brucei(30Affranchino J.L. González S.A. Pays E. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 132: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), 2P. Neuville and J. C. Mottram, unpublished data. implying that regulation of kinase activity through cyclin binding is conserved in trypanosomatids. Southern blot analysis, using as a probe a 1.2-kb EcoRI/HindIII genomic fragment which covers the complete open reading frame of the crk3gene, detected a single hybridizing band in four out of five restriction digests (Fig. 3 A,lanes 2–5). The SalI restriction digest (lane 1) gave one major hybridizing fragment of approximately 3.5-kb and one weakly hybridizing fragment of approximately 6 kb. The presence of two hybridizing bands is due to the internal SalI site within the crk3 gene (Fig. 1). Together with mapping data obtained from the λ clones, these results indicate that crk3 is single copy in the leishmanial genome. When the same probe was hybridized to a Northern blot of poly(A)+ mRNA derived from the three life cycle stages of L. mexicana, a 1.7-kb mRNA was detected (Fig. 3 B). Relative hybridization intensity was quantified by phosphoimaging using α-tubulin as a control. This gave a ratio of 5:1:1 for replicative promastigote:stationary phase metacyclic:replicative amastigote. The S. pombe protein, p13suc1, interacts with cdc2 and cdk2 from many species and has been widely used as a highly specific affinity matrix for the purification of cdc2 when covalently cross-linked to a solid support, such as Sepharose beads (9Brizuela L.

https://openalex.org/W2086798592,"Ras is a master GTPase switch controlling multiple signal transduction cascades in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. Rab5 is a local GTPase switch that is localized on early endosomes and controls early endosome fusion. This study demonstrates that the catalytic domain of p120 GTPase-activating protein (GAP), a well known Ras GAP, is able to interact physically with Rab5 and stimulate its GTPase activity. This GAP activity toward Rab5, however, cannot be extended to other Rab GTPases such as Rab3, Rab4, and Rab6, indicating that it is not a generic GAP for the Rab family of GTPases that regulate intracellular membrane fusion during endocytosis and exocytosis. The findings indicate a level of structural similarity between Ras and Rab5 unexpected from their primary sequences. They also suggest a possible signal transduction regulation of the Rab5-dependent endosome fusion via the Ras GAP."

The ADP/O method, based on the non-phosphorylating property of alternative oxidase, was used to determine contributions of both pathways in overall state 3 respiration in the presence of GMP (an activator of the alternative oxidase in amoeba) and succinate as oxidizable substrate. This method involves pair measurements of ADP/O ratios plus and minus benzohydroxamate (an inhibitor of the alternative oxidase). The requirements of the method are listed and verified. When overall state 3 respiration was decreased by increasing concentrations of n-butyl malonate (a non-penetrating inhibitor of succinate uptake), the quinone reduction level declined. At the same time, the alternative pathway contribution decreased sharply and became negligible when quinone redox state was lower than 50%, whereas the cytochrome pathway contribution first increased and then passed through a maximum at a quinone redox state of 58% and sharply decreased at a lower level of quinone reduction. This study is the first attempt to examine the steady-state kinetics of the two quinol-oxidizing pathways when both are active and to describe electron partitioning between them when the steady-state rate of the quinone-reducing pathway is varied.

The mitochondrial respiratory chain of the amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii possesses, like that of plant mitochondria (1Douce R. Neuburger M. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

Plant Physiol. 1995; 22: 497-509Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar), the alternative pathway of amoeba mitochondria branches from the main respiratory chain at the level of quinone (Q), and electron flux through AOX is not coupled to the generation of protonmotive force and ADP phosphorylation (2Hryniewiecka L. Jenek J. Michejda J. Ducet G. Lance C. Plant Mitochondria. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1978: 307-314Google Scholar). The cyanide-resistant respiration of amoeba mitochondria is strongly stimulated by purine nucleoside 5′-monophosphates: AMP, GMP (with the highest efficiency), and IMP (2Hryniewiecka L. Jenek J.

A similar effect of purine mononucleotides on the activity of the alternative pathway was observed in other microorganisms: Euglena gracilis (10Sharpless T.K. Butow R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 58-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Moniliella tomentosa (11Vanderleyden J. Van den Eynde E. Verachtert H. Biochem.

Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), but not by purine mononucleotides, whereas the α-keto acids do not stimulate the alternative respiration in amoeba mitochondria (17Jarmuszkiewicz W. Hryniewiecka L. Acta Biochim. Pol. 1994; 2: 218-220Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). These properties emphasize an important difference at the level of allosteric regulation between both types of AOX. However, monoclonal antibodies developed against Sauromatum guttatum cross-react with the AOX protein of amoeba mitochondria (18Jarmuszkiewicz W. Wagner A.M. Wagner M.J. Hryniewiecka L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), as they do in a wide range of thermogenic and non-thermogenic plant species, some fungi, and trypanosomes (7Day D.A. Whelan J. Millar A.H. Siedow J.N. Wiskich J.T. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1995; 22: 497-509Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 16Siedow J.N. Umbach A.L.

(Bethesda). 1994; 105: 781-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), indicating that this protein is well conserved throughout the species. Regulation of electron distribution between the energy-conserving cytochrome pathway and the redox potential-dissipating alternative pathway is obviously of the utmost importance for the energy economy of the cell. Several levels of control of AOX activity are known in plant mitochondria (for reviews, see Refs. 7Day D.A. Whelan J. Millar A.H. Siedow J.N. Wiskich J.T. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1995; 22: 497-509Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 16Siedow J.N. Umbach A.L. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 19McIntosh L. Plant Physiol.

Plant. 1995; 95: 318-325Crossref Scopus (183) Google Scholar): (a) the amount of the oxidase protein present in the mitochondria (gene expression); (b) the redox status of the protein (post-translational modification); (c) the presence of allosteric regulators (allostery); and (d) Q concentration in the inner mitochondrial membrane and the redox state of quinone (Qred/Qtot) (substrate-product availability). With the exception of the regulation by change in redox state of the protein, all these levels have been found for amoeba AOX (18Jarmuszkiewicz W. Wagner A.M. Wagner M.J. Hryniewiecka L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 21Jarmuszkiewicz, W., Wagner, A. M., and Hryniewiecka, L.

V., Amsterdam.Google Scholar). Precise understanding of the interplay and quantitative analysis of these various levels of regulation can be reached only by measurements of the actual activities of the two branching oxidases during steady-state respiration. Such a study depends on the ability to measure the respective contributions of both pathways in total respiration. These determinations are hampered by the fact that both oxidative pathways have the same substrate and product and that the use of specific inhibitors must be considered as unsuitable because an inhibition of one of the pathways inevitably affects electron flux via the other pathway (22Millar A.H. Atkin O.K. Lambers H. Wiskich J.T. Day D.A. Physiol. Plant. 1995; 95: 523-532Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 23Day D.A. Krab K. Lambers H. Moore A.L. Siedow J.N. Wagner A.M. Wiskich J.T. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1996; 110: 1-2Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A kinetic approach has been developed (24Van den Bergen C.W.M. Wagner A.M. Krab K. Moore A.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) taking into account the interplay between quinol-oxidizing and quinone-reducing steady-state electron fluxes and the redox poise of the quinone pool. This method is based on the homogeneous quinone pool hypothesis and on a strict specificity of the inhibitors of each oxidative pathway that are used to measure the activity of one pathway when the other is inhibited. It allows the prediction of the real contribution of each pathway at a given total steady-state respiratory rate. Another method, considered to be the only method that exists at present for making quantitative measurements of AOX activity (23Day D.A. Krab K. Lambers H. Moore A.L. Siedow J.N. Wagner A.M. Wiskich J.T. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1996; 110: 1-2Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), has been developed for measuring relative contributions even in vivo. This method is based on the differential oxygen isotope discrimination between the cytochrome and alternative oxidase pathways (25Guy R.G. Berry J.A. Fogel M.L. Turpin D.H. Weger H.G. Lambers H. van der Plas L.H.W. Plant Respiration: Molecular, Biochemical and Physiological Aspects. SPB Academic Publishing, 1992: 443-453Google Scholar, 26Robinson S.A. Ribas-Carbo M. Yakir D. Giles L. Reuveni Y. Berry J.A. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1995; 22: 487-496Google Scholar). Calibration used in this method requires the use of inhibitor for each respiratory pathway and assumes that change in the total respiration rate does not change the discrimination factor. Because the alternative pathway does not contribute to ATP synthesis with succinate (in the presence of rotenone) as oxidizable substrate, comparison of the ADP/O ratio with and without an inhibitor of AOX (e.g. hydroxamic acids) allows the estimation of the contribution of this pathway in total mitochondrial respiration. A method based on ADP/O ratio determination proposed a long time ago (27Lambowitz A.M. Smith E.W. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4859-4865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,28Bahr J.T. Bonner Jr., W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3441-3445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has not been widely used, although it is one of the best as it avoids the use of the rates of electron transport of both pathways in the presence of inhibitors (cyanide and hydroxamic acids), and it does not require a strict specificity of the inhibitors of both pathways. Moreover, the ADP/O ratio method is not linked to the homogeneous quinone pool hypothesis. This method is claimed to have a limited range of application (29Lance C. Chauveau M. Dizengremel P. Douce R. Day D.A. Encyclopedia of Plant Physiology: Higher Plant Cell Respiration. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1985: 202-247Google Scholar). Of course, it cannot be applied under state 4 conditions and could hardly be used with intact tissues. However, this method could be applied in permeabilized cells and in isolated mitochondria in state 3 respiration, even if an AOX inhibitor does not decrease total state 3 respiration. In this study, we have successfully developed the ADP/O method to determine the actual contributions of both the cytochrome and alternative pathways in isolated amoeba mitochondria and to describe how these contributions change when the steady-state rate of the quinone-reducing pathway is varied. The soil amoeba A. castellanii (strain Neff) was cultured as described by Jarmuszkiewicz et al. (18Jarmuszkiewicz W. Wagner A.M. Wagner M.J. Hryniewiecka L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Trophozoites of amoeba were collected 22–24 h following inoculation at the middle exponential phase (at a density of ∼2–4 × 106 cells/ml). Mitochondria were isolated and purified on a self-generating Percoll gradient (31%) as described before (18Jarmuszkiewicz W. Wagner A.M. Wagner M.J. Hryniewiecka L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Oxygen uptake was measured polarographically using a Rank Brothers oxygen electrode in 3 ml of standard incubation medium (25 °C) containing 120 mmKCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 3 mmKH2PO4, 8 mm MgCl2, and 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin with 1.5–1.8 mg of mitochondrial protein. The membrane potential of mitochondria (ΔΨ) was measured simultaneously with oxygen uptake using a tetraphenylphosphonium-specific electrode according to Kamo et al. (30Kamo N. Muratsugu M. Hongoh R. Kobatake Y. J. Membr. Biol. 1979; 49: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). For calculation of ΔΨ, the matrix volume of amoeba mitochondria was assumed as 2.0 μl × mg−1 protein. Measurements of ΔΨ, performed in the presence of 8 μmtetraphenylphosphonium, allowed the fine control of the duration of state 3 respiration. The ADP/O ratio was determined by the ADP pulse method, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The oxidizable substrate was succinate (10 mm) in the presence of rotenone (15 μm) to block electron input from complex I. Increasing concentrations of n-butyl malonate from 2 to 20 mm were added to the incubation medium to decrease steady-state 3 respiration. A rather large amount of added ADP (480–520 nmol) was chosen to ensure an accurate determination of the steady-state O2 consumption in state 3. The total amount of oxygen consumed during state 3 respiration was used to calculate the ADP/O ratio (see Fig. 1). A prepulse of ADP (200 nmol) was always applied before the main pulse to ensure that a true state 4 had been achieved and to activate succinate dehydrogenase by the produced ATP. To fully activate the alternative pathway, GMP, the allosteric effector of AOX in amoeba mitochondria, was added to the incubation medium at a concentration of 0.6 mm (K 0.5 = 20 μm) (9Hryniewiecka, L., and Michejda, J. (1988) Fifth European Bioenergetic Conference Reports, July 20–26, 1988, Aberystwyth, UK, Abstract p. 286.Google Scholar). Measurements of the ADP/O ratio were performed in the absence or presence of 1.5 mm benzohydroxamate (BHAM), a concentration sufficient to totally inhibit the KCN-insensitive respiration in amoeba mitochondria. The redox state of quinone in steady-state respiration was determined by an extraction technique according to Van den Bergen et al. (24Van den Bergen C.W.M. Wagner A.M. Krab K. Moore A.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For calibration of the peaks, commercial Q-9 (Sigma) was used. Protein was estimated by the biuret method (31Gornall A.G. Bardawill C.J. Dawid M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 177: 751-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin (fraction V) as a standard. Tetraphenylphosphonium was obtained from Fluka, and n-butyl malonate was from Aldrich. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The method proposed in this paper is based on the ADP/O ratio determination for complexes III and IV in the presence and absence of BHAM, a specific inhibitor of the alternative oxidase, taking into account that the alternative pathway, when supplied with electrons by succinate as oxidizable substrate (+rotenone), is not energy-conserving. The method consists in measuring the ADP/O ratios and the rate of state 3 respiration during ADP pulses (Fig. 1). To describe how the contribution of each pathway changes with variations in the overall state 3 respiration (without BHAM), n-butyl malonate, a non-penetrating competitive inhibitor of succinate uptake, is used to decrease the rate of the quinone-reducing pathway. If v 3 =v cyt + v alt, where v 3 is the rate of state 3 respiration,v cyt is the contribution of the cytochrome pathway in electron flux, and v alt is the contribution of the alternative pathway in electron flux, and if α−ADP/O(ADP/O)cyt=ADPOcyt+OaltADPOcyt=OcytOcyt+Oalt=vcytvcyt+valtEquation 1 where ADP/O is the ADP/O ratio in the absence of BHAM (when both respiratory pathways are active), (ADP/O)cyt is the ADP/O ratio in the presence of BHAM (when only the cytochrome pathway is active), and Ocyt and Oalt are the amounts of oxygen taken up related to the activities of the cytochrome and alternative pathways, respectively, then Equations 2 and 3 follow. v3×α=vcyt=contribution of the cytochrome pathwayEquation 2 v3−vcyt=valt=contribution of the alternative pathwayEquation 3 The proposed ADP/O method is valid only if (i) the ADP/O ratio in the presence of cyanide is equal to zero; (ii) BHAM does not induce a proton leak (has no uncoupling effect) and thereby does not affect ΔΨ; (iii) the ADP/O ratio in the presence of BHAM is independent of the state 3 respiratory rates (within the applied range); and (iv) isolated mitochondria are well coupled and stable during the experimental procedure. It is well known that the electron transport from ubiquinol to O2 via the alternative pathway does not lead to the synthesis of ATP (for review, see Ref. 32Moore A.L. Siedow J.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1059: 121-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The non-electrogenic character of the alternative pathway, when supplied with electrons from complex II, was confirmed under conditions applied in this study (i.e. in the presence of the allosteric activator of the pathway (GMP) and rotenone). After the addition of KCN that excluded the activity of the cytochrome pathway (entire collapse of ΔΨ), no effect of either ADP or carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone on the respiratory rate is observed (data not shown). Acceleration of the respiration caused by GMP, entirely sensitive to BHAM, is due exclusively to the stimulation of the electron flux through the alternative pathway. Thus, the ADP/O ratio in the presence of cyanide is certainly equal to zero. Among the tested inhibitors of the alternative oxidase, only BHAM meets the second requirement of the method and, at the maximal concentration used (1.5 mm), does not decrease ΔΨ generated by the cytochrome pathway during oxidation of succinate and also decreases the O2 uptake in both state 4 and state 3 respiration (data not shown). In amoeba mitochondria, the other inhibitors (1.5 mm salicylhydroxamate and 100 μm n-propyl gallate) display a slight uncoupling effect on ΔΨ, decreasing it by ∼2–5 mV. 2L. Hryniewiecka, unpublished results. Therefore, for further investigations, BHAM was chosen as the most suitable inhibitor of AOX. Moreover, there is no residual respiration in amoeba mitochondria in the presence of 1.5 mm BHAM and 1 mm KCN. The constancy of the (ADP/O)cyt ratio (third requirement), when the operation of the alternative pathway was excluded by BHAM, was checked for state 3 respiration, ranging from 65 to 230 nmol of oxygen × min−1 × mg−1 protein (Fig. 2 A). This range comprises data from 15 mitochondrial preparations with various rates of state 3 respiration gradually decreased by increasing concentrations of n-butyl malonate. The (ADP/O)cyt ratios obtained (1.41 ± 0.06 (S.D., n = 22) in the absence of GMP and 1.41 ± 0.07 (S.D., n = 76) in the presence of GMP) display the constancy required by the method, as they fluctuate randomly without any correlation with either v 3or the respiratory control ratio (Fig. 2, A and B). This result is of the utmost importance regarding the validity of the calculation of α proposed above (Equation 1) and suggests that native proton leak has a negligible influence on the ADP/O ratios within the investigated range of v 3. Moreover, membrane potential measured during state 3 respiration triggered by ADP pulse in the presence of BHAM reveals a constant level of ΔΨ for the whole range of state 3 respiration (155.5 ± 5.5 mV, S.D., n = 56) (Fig. 2 C). This constancy is also important in the interpretation of proton leak contribution in state 3 respiration (see “Discussion”). The ATPase activity has also been proven not to interfere with state 4 respiration in the presence of BHAM, as the addition of oligomycin does not affect the respiratory rates (as an example, 68 ± 4 and 70 ± 2 nmol of oxygen × min−1 × mg−1 protein without and with oligomycin, respectively). On the other hand, the addition of oligomycin in state 3 decreases the respiratory rate exactly to that observed in state 4 (from 144 ± 6 to 68 ± 3 nmol of oxygen × min−1 × mg−1 protein). Finally, mitochondria isolated from amoeba are characterized by a considerable stability. They exhibit a good coupling of the oxidative phosphorylation, which is not significantly affected within the duration of an experiment (up to 10 h). Thus, all considered conditions required to determine the respective contributions of both respiratory pathways in total respiration were positively verified for amoeba mitochondria. Table I shows an example of the ADP/O ratios obtained from a single mitochondrial preparation in the presence and absence of BHAM, used for calculation of the contributions of both pathways in total respiration. The rates of state 3 respiration with succinate (in the presence of rotenone and GMP and in the absence of BHAM) are decreased with increasing concentrations of n-butyl malonate from the control value of 179–173 to 103 nmol of oxygen × min−1 × mg−1 mitochondrial protein. At the same time, the ADP/O ratios increase gradually from 0.93–0.94 to 1.43, approaching the value observed in the presence of BHAM ((ADP/O)cyt). It must be noted that the (ADP/O)cyt ratio is almost constant whatever v 3 is (mean ± S.D. for this experiment = 1.44 ± 0.04, n = 7). These results indicate that the changes in the ADP/O ratios determined in the absence of BHAM are due to the change in the activity of the alternative pathway, which gradually decreases together with the lowering of electron transfer from complex II to quinone.Table IEvolution of the ADP/O ratio (±BHAM) when state 3 respiration is decreased by n-butyl malonateConc of n-butyl malonatev 3 − BHAMADP/O − BHAM(ADP/O)cyt + BHAMmm01790.931.3901730.941.390.71651.061.481.31631.181.475.41471.291.417.81341.361.4715.61041.431.48 Open table in a new tab From the pair measurements of ADP/O ratios in the presence and absence of BHAM, at various state 3 respiration rates, the contributions of both pathways have been calculated (according to Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3) for series of mitochondrial preparations, which, in the absence of n-butyl malonate, present two different rates of state 3 respiration: 180 and 212 nmol of oxygen × min−1 × mg−1 mitochondrial protein (Fig. 3 A). When the calculated v cyt and v altcontributions are plotted as a function of v 3, two groups of results are observed (groups A and B in Fig. 3 A). Each group exhibits a similar behavior. Inhibition of v 3 by increasing concentrations of n-butyl malonate is accompanied by a sharp decrease in the v alt contribution, whereas v cyt first slightly increases, passes through a maximum, and then clearly decreases when v altbecomes very small. When results of groups A and B are divided by the respective values of v 3 in the absence of n-butyl malonate (contributions and v 3 are then expressed in percent), both groups belong to the same v cyt and v alt curves (Fig. 3 B) that exhibit the same profiles as curves in Fig. 3 A. The three experiments belonging to group B (Fig. 3 A) include also determination of Q reduction level. It was previously found that the endogenous quinone in amoeba mitochondria is Q-9 (21Jarmuszkiewicz, W., Wagner, A. M., and Hryniewiecka, L. (1996)Ninth European Bioenergetic Conference Reports, August 17–22, 1996, Louvain la Neuve, Belgium, Abstract no. C. V-5, p. 36, BBA Library, Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam.Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, reproducible results are obtained in the three experiments when v 3 is decreased by n-butyl malonate from 212 to 100 nmol of oxygen × min−1 × mg−1 protein (see Fig. 3 A). When the two contributions (v cytand v alt) calculated for the decreasing rate of state 3 respiration are presented as a function of Qred/Qtot (Fig. 4), it can be observed that 1) the Q reduction level decreases from 65 to 38%; 2)v alt decreases sharply and vanishes when Qred/Qtot is lower than 53%; and 3)v cyt first slightly increases, reaching a maximum (∼160 nmol of oxygen × min−1 × mg−1 protein) when the Qred/Qtotvalue is ∼58%, and then decreases. The quinone reduction level obtained in the absence of substrate (mean value of 22%) and upon anaerobiosis and complete inhibition of the quinol-oxidizing pathways (mean value 83%) suggests the presence of the inactive Q-H2 and Q pools as observed with some plant mitochondria (24Van den Bergen C.W.M. Wagner A.M. Krab K. Moore A.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In amoeba mitochondria, the inactive pools would constitute 22% (Q-H2) and 17% (Q) of the total quinone pool size, and the active pool could be ∼60% of the total membrane quinone. It is obvious that determination of the cytochrome and alternative pathway contributions using the ADP/O ratios requires an (ADP/O)cytvalue independent of v cyt (i.e.electron flux through the cytochrome pathway) when the electron supply by dehydrogenase is modified. Such independence was not a priori expected because it has been discredited by several examples in the literature. In yeast mitochondria where complex I is missing, the ADP/O ratio increases when the respiratory rate decreases below 100 nmol of oxygen × min−1 × mg−1 protein at a constant protonmotive force, indicating a change in the mechanistic stoichiometry of one of the proton pumps (33Rigoulet M. Fitton V. Ouhabi R. Guerin B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 773-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, when in these mitochondria the respiratory rates measured with various substrates of internal dehydrogenases are higher than 100 nmol of oxygen × min−1 × mg−1 protein, a constant ADP/O ratio of 1.5 is observed. Other results (34Moore A.L. Leach G. Whitehouse D.G. Van den Bergen C.W.M. Wagner A.M. Krab K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 145-151Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) suggest similar flux efficiency dependence in potato tuber mitochondria (where the alternative oxidase activity is missing). Nevertheless, when in these mitochondria the succinate-dependent state 3 respiratory rate (in the absence of rotenone) is decreased by malonate, an inhibition by 75% does not change the ADP/O ratio (∼1.4). Thus, it seems possible that no flux efficiency dependence occurs for succinate-sustained respiration through the cytochrome pathway when electron input is sufficient. The results reported here show that the (ADP/O)cyt value determined for succinate oxidation (plus rotenone) by the ADP pulse method in the presence of BHAM is constant for respiratory rates between 65 and 230 nmol of oxygen × min−1 × mg−1 of mitochondrial protein (Fig. 2 A). Therefore, there is no flux efficiency dependence within this range of respiratory rates. The v cyt values (Fig. 3) were obtained within the respiratory rate range characterized by (ADP/O)cyt constancy as required for the ADP/O method. Of course, to calculate v cyt, one must assume that the (ADP/O)cyt value that characterizes the efficiency of the energy-conserving system of the cytochrome pathway is not modified by the AOX activity and is independent of the presence or absence of BHAM. Such a hypothesis is unavoidable regardless of the method used (including the one based on oxygen isotope discrimination (25Guy R.G. Berry J.A. Fogel M.L. Turpin D.H. Weger H.G.

(Bethesda). 1997; 113: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) in which discrimination values are used instead of ADP/O ratios to estimate the partitioning of electron flow into both quinol-oxidizing pathways). The constancy of (ADP/O)cyt observed with isolated amoeba mitochondria (Fig. 2, A and B) indicates that the proton pumps' stoichiometries remain essentially constant within the range of respiratory rates used and that the influence of the proton leak is either negligible or constant. However, a constant influence of the proton leak on the (ADP/O)cyt value would require that the proton leak remain in a constant ratio with v cyt, and consequently, ΔΨ is expected to vary in the same direction as v cyt. It has been observed that in state 3 respiration in the presence of BHAM, ΔΨ does not correlate significantly with this respiratory rate (Fig. 2 C), but remains almost constant (156 ± 6 mV, S.D.,n = 56). It can be concluded that the proton leak is likely to be negligible in state 3 respiration. In relation with this conclusion, it should be noted that the (ADP/O)cyt value (1.41 ± 0.07, S.D., n = 8) is very close to the theoretical value (1.46 ± 0.04, S.E.) calculated for zero proton leak in rat liver mitochondria by Van Dam et al. (36Van Dam K. Westerhoff H.V. Krab K. Van der Meer R. Arents J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 591: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) (see also Ref. 37Westerhoff H.V. Van Dam K. Westerhoff H.V. Van Dam K. Thermodynamics and Control of Biological Free Energy Transduction. Elsevier Science Publishers B V., Amsterdam1987Google Scholar). It has also been observed that the state 4 respiratory rates in the presence of BHAM, sustained mainly by the proton leak (as they are insensitive to oligomycin), are not small compared with the respiratory rates in state 3 (respiratory control ratio ranges from 2.3 to 1.5; Fig. 2 B) and that ΔΨ in state 4 (174 ± 5 mV, S.D.,n = 42) is only 18 mV higher than in state 3 respiration. If the proton leak is negligible in state 3 respiration, these observations suggest the existence of an acute “non-ohmic” apparent conductance of the inner mitochondrial membrane of amoeba. This study is the first direct approach that has examined the steady-state kinetics of the two quinol-oxidizing pathways when both are active. Indeed, ADP/O ratio determination in the presence and absence of BHAM has made possible the description of the behavior of the steady-state contribution of both quinol-oxidizing pathways under state 3 conditions when the rate of succinate transport is inhibited by different concentrations of n-butyl malonate. Furthermore, it has been verified that the total respiratory rate and the quinone reduction level evolve in the same direction (Fig. 4, inset). When the two contributions are presented as a function of the total respiratory rate (Fig. 3) or as a function of Qred/Qtot (Fig. 4), similar curves are obtained. The mitochondrial preparations behave reproducibly despite quantitative differences when contributions are plotted versus v 3 (Fig. 3 A); these differences disappear when normalized rates are considered (Fig. 3 B). In amoeba mitochondria, the AOX activity stimulated by GMP is significant in the absence of n-butyl malonate (equal to 40% of the total respiratory rate), but decreases sharply and becomes negligible at 40% inhibition of the total respiratory rate (Fig. 3 B). In contrast to the cytochrome pathway, the alternative pathway is not engaged when the reduction level of the active pool of quinone is lower than 50% (Fig. 4). In plant mitochondria, when the cytochrome pathway is blocked by a specific inhibitor, the respiratory rate mediated by AOX exhibits, in most cases, a threshold-like relationship with the Q redox state (for review, see Ref. 32Moore A.L. Siedow J.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1059: 121-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). A typical example is that of soybean cotyledon mitochondria (38Dry I.B. Moore A.L. Day D.A. Wiskich J.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 273: 148-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), for which a mechanism with a two-step reduction of the alternative oxidase by quinol has been proposed (39Siedow J.N. Moore A.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1142: 165-174Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 40Ribas-Carbo M. Berry J.A. Azcon-Bieto J. Siedow J.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 205-212Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In conclusion, it appears that in isolated amoeba mitochondria, the kinetic behavior of AOX (when both pathways are active) is similar to that observed with plant mitochondria when the cytochrome pathway is blocked. The steady-state kinetics of the cytochrome pathway presents an unexpected soft maximum (Figs. 3 and 4). The cytochrome pathway activity has been reported to be proportional to the steady-state reduction level of Q (for a discussion of such kinetics, see Ref. 41Ragan C.I. Cottingham I.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 811: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), first in uncoupled submitochondrial particles from beef heart mitochondria by Kröger and Klingenberg (42Kröger A. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 34: 358-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and then also under state 3 and state 4 conditions in plant mitochondria (for reviews, see Refs. 20Wagner A.M. Krab K. Physiol. Plant. 1995; 95: 318-325Crossref Scopus (183) Google Scholar and 32Moore A.L. Siedow J.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1059: 121-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The peculiar behavior of the cytochrome pathway in the amoeba A. castellanii (i.e. the observed maximum in v cyt) may be due to 1) a special feature of the cytochrome pathway activity when Qred/Qtot is varied together with a possible modification of the cytochrome c redox state imposed by the steady-state conditions within the cytochrome pathway or 2) variation in the concentration of a putative inner effector of the cytochrome pathway antagonizing the substrate effect of Qred/Qtot variations. The first proposal might be met in the following way. The protonmotive Q cycle (43Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11409-11412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is generally accepted as the mechanism by which complex III (cytochrome bc 1 complex) links the redox reaction between Q-H2 and oxidized cytochrome cto the proton translocation from the matrix to the cytosol. In this mechanism, the catalytic cycle involves oxidation of two Q-H2 molecules at an enzymatic site localized on the cytosolic side of the complex (center o) and the reduction of one Q molecule on the matrix side (center i). It can be supposed that for both reactions, Q and Q-H2 belong to the active Q pool of the mitochondrial membrane (44Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Then, the steady-state activity requires the presence of the oxidized form of quinone in the bulk pool. A situation in which the steady-state Qred/Qtot ratio should be exactly equal to 1 (fully reduced quinone) would lead to zero activity, and this implies that the activity of complex III as a function of Qred/Qtot exhibits a maximum. However, if the Q-binding site of center i is saturated even at a low Q level (binding site with a very high affinity for Q), the maximum will be situated at a Qred/Qtot value very close to 1, and it could be not detectable. Indeed, in such a case, the reaction occurring at site i does not need to be explicitly taken into account (e.g. Ref. 45Reed J.S. Ragan C.I. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), so a steady-state kinetic analysis could be performed considering the global reaction Qred + cyt c ox + E → Qox + cyt c red + E (where cyt c is oxidized or reduced cytochrome c and E is complex III), which follows a ping-pong mechanism (46Degli Esposti M. Lenaz G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 289: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar,47Fato R. Cavazzoni M. Castelluccio C. Parenti Castelli G. Palmer G. Degli Esposti M. Lenaz G. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It can be speculated that the kinetic constants of complex III in amoeba mitochondria may be such that the mechanistic scheme does not simplify in this way (i.e. that the quinone reduction at site i is interfering), so that a maximum of activity can be observed in the steady-state kinetics of the cytochrome pathway. If this explanation is correct, the maximum in v cytmust exist in whatever way the electrons are supplied to the Q pool. Disappearance of the maximum with another reducing substrate would favor the second proposal, which assumes the existence of a new factor of regulation of the cytochrome pathway in amoeba mitochondria. Therefore, further studies are needed to for a straightforward interpretation of this peculiar behavior of the cytochrome pathway in amoeba. It can be concluded that the ADP/O method is valid for direct determination of activities of the cytochrome and alternative pathways in isolated mitochondria during steady-state phosphorylating respiration. Moreover, the approach described in this paper has led to the first detailed examination of the steady-state kinetics of the two quinol-oxidizing pathways when both are active and to the description of electron partitioning between them when the steady-state rate of the quinone-reducing pathway is decreased."

The folding of the protein is complete within a time scale of 200 ms.

The protein folding pathway is the kinetic process in which disordered polypeptide chain proceeds to fold into its highly ordered native structure (1Dyson H.J. Merutka G. Waltho J.P. Lerner R.A. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 795-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Folding of a polypeptide chain into its unique three-dimensional structure is believed to be encoded in its amino acid sequence (2Radford S.E. Dobson C.M. Evans P.A. Nature. 1990; 358: 302-307Crossref Scopus (730) Google Scholar). The transformation of the unfolded chain to its native state obviously does not involve a random search of the conformational space, because such a process would require too much of time (3Dill K.A. Bromberg S. Yue K. Fiebig M. Yee D.D. Thomas P.D. Chan H.S. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 561-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). Most proteins are known to fold within a time span of a few minutes if not seconds (4Jackson S.E. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10428-10435Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is obligatory that the initial events in protein folding should limit the conformational space and thus specify the pathway for unfolded polypeptide chain to attain its native state. Hence, it is important to understand the structural interactions that come into play during the early events of folding (5Baldwin R.L. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 105-109Crossref Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 6Lu H. Buck M. Radford S.E. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These interactions, consequently, predetermine the three-dimensional structure of the protein. Folding to the native conformation is a highly cooperative process for small, single domain proteins (7Khorasanizadeh S. Peters I.D. Roder H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 193-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Although, transient intermediates have been observed during the folding process, it is still not clear at what stage the cooperativity in the folding process arises. Characterization of early folding intermediates provides vital clues(s) to understand the cooperativity phenomenon observed in the folding of small proteins. Recently, with the advent of powerful techniques such as the quenched-flow deuterium-hydrogen exchange in conjunction with two-dimensional NMR experiments, it has become feasible to characterize the transient intermediates that occur in the early stages of folding (8Udgaonkar J.B. Baldwin R.L. Nature. 1988; 335: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 9Jacobs M.D. Fox R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 10Kuszewsici J. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1945-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The quenched-flow hydrogen-deuterium exchange technique is particularly powerful, because it permits many specific sites within a protein to be probed on the millisecond time scale (11Roder H. Elove G.A. Englander S.W. Nature. 1988; 335: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). This technique has been successfully used to study the folding pathway of several proteins (8Udgaonkar J.B. Baldwin R.L. Nature. 1988; 335: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Interestingly, most of these proteins are composed of helical conformation or possess both α-helical and β-sheet segments. Roder et al. (11Roder H. Elove G.A. Englander S.W. Nature. 1988; 335: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar), studying the early folding events in cytochrome C, a predominantly helical protein, found that helix formation occurs very quickly within the low millisecond time scale. The fast time scales of helix formation (in cytochrome C) are not surprising, because the hydrogen bonding interactions involved in helix formation are local. Since hydrogen bonding in β-sheet formation involves interactions between distant parts of the polypeptide chain, it is expected that the folding rates of β-sheet segments would be slower than α-helices. In this context, we investigate the early folding events in the folding pathway of a small, all β-sheet protein such as cardiotoxin analogue III (CTX III) 1The abbreviations used are: CTX III, cardiotoxin analogue III; ANS, 1-anilino-8-napthalene sulfonic acid; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; TFE, 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol. from the Taiwan cobra (Naja naja atra). CTX III isolated from the venom of the Taiwan cobra (N. naja atra) is a 60-amino acid, highly basic, all β-sheet protein (12Kumar T.K.S. Lee C.S. Yu C. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 391: 115-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 13Kumar T.K.S. Jayaraman G. Lee C.S. Sivaraman T. Lin W.Y. Yu C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 536-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Sivaraman T. Kumar T.K.S. Huang C.C. Yu C. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1998; 44: 29-39PubMed Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of CTX III shows that the protein is “three-finger” shaped with three loops projecting from a globular head (14Sivaraman T. Kumar T.K.S. Huang C.C. Yu C. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1998; 44: 29-39PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bhaskaran R. Huang C.C. Chang D.K. Yu C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1291-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) as shown in Fig. 1. The protein is cross-linked by four disulfide bonds. The secondary structure of CTX III (14Sivaraman T. Kumar T.K.S. Huang C.C. Yu C. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1998; 44: 29-39PubMed Google Scholar) includes five β-strands arranged to form double and triple-stranded antiparallel β-sheets (Fig. 1). In the native state, CTX III does not show any helical segments, and interestingly, secondary structure prediction analysis on the amino acid sequence of CTX III shows that no portion(s) of the protein has any propensity to adopt a helical conformation. Thus, CTX III is an ideal choice to understand the early folding events in an all β-sheet protein. In the present study, the kinetic folding pathway of CTX III is examined using a variety of techniques such as stopped-flow circular dichroism, stopped-flow fluorescence, and quenched-flow deuterium-hydrogen exchange. The results obtained herein are consistent with the hydrophobic collapse model of protein folding. CTX III was purified as per the method reported earlier (14Sivaraman T. Kumar T.K.S. Huang C.C. Yu C. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1998; 44: 29-39PubMed Google Scholar). 1-Anilino-8-napthalene sulfonic acid (ANS) was purchased from Sigma. Guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl, ultrapure) was purchased from Merck, Germany. All other chemicals used were of high quality. Carboxymethylated CTX III was prepared as per the procedure reported by Goldberg et al. (16Goldberg M.E. Rudolf R. Jacnicke R. Biochemistry. 1990; 30: 2790-2797Crossref Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Equilibrium unfolding was monitored by far-UV and near-UV CD as a function of GdnHCl concentration. CD measurements were made on a Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter. CD spectra were collected with the slit width set to 430 μm, a response time of 1 s, and a scan speed of 20 nm/min. Each spectrum was an average of at least five scans. Secondary structure measurements were made at 213 nm with protein concentrations of 160 μm in a 0.02-cm path length cuvette. Near-UV CD measurements at 270 nm were carried out using a protein concentration of 160 μm with a cuvette with a path length of 0.1 cm. The sample temperature was maintained using a Neslab RTE-110 circulating water bath at 25 ± 0.2 °C. Equilibrium unfolding data obtained using GdnHCl as denaturant were converted to plots of F U, the fraction of protein in the unfolded state, versus denaturant concentration using the equation, FU=(XO−(XF+mF[D]))/((XU+mU[D])−(XF+mF[D]))Equation 1 where X O is the value of the spectroscopic property measured at denaturant concentration [D].X F and X U represent the intercepts, and m F and m Uthe slopes of the folded and unfolded base lines of the data, respectively, and were obtained from linear least squares fits of the base lines. For a two-state F ↔ U unfolding pathway, the free energy of unfolding by denaturant (ΔG u) at concentration [D] is the related to F U by a transformation of the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation in which the equilibrium constant of unfolding in the transition zone, k app =F U/(1 − F U),F U = e−ΔGU/RT /(1 + e−ΔGU/RT). It is assumed that the free energy of unfolding, ΔG U, has a linear dependence on the concentration of the denaturant [D], ΔGU=ΔG(H2O)+mG[D]Equation 2 wherein ΔG(H2O) and m G are the intercept and slope, respectively, of the plot of ΔG U versus the concentration of the denaturant. m G is the measure of the cooperativity of the unfolding reaction and ΔG U(H2O) is the free energy difference between the folded and unfolded states in the absence of any denaturant. All stopped-flow fluorescence measurements were performed at 5 ± 0.2 °C using a SF-61 stopped-flow spectrofluorimeter (Hi-Tech Scientific Co.). The concentration of ANS was varied between 50 and 250 μm by appropriately mixing the stock solution of ANS (300 μm) in the native buffer (10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 3.0). 1.6 mm of equilibrium-unfolded CTX III (in 6 mGdnHCl) was diluted 10-fold into 270 μl of the ANS-containing native buffer. This procedure ensured that the concentrations of the protein (160 μm) and GdnHCl (0.6 m) were unchanged during the refolding reaction in the presence of different concentrations of ANS. The binding of ANS was monitored by setting the excitation and emission wavelengths at 418 and 497 nm, respectively. The bandwidth used in all the measurements was 2 mm. The dead time of stopped-flow mixing device was 4.0 ms. Stopped-flow CD measurements were carried out using a stopped-flow apparatus from Biologie attached to a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter. The refolding reaction was initiated by a 10-fold dilution of the GdnHCl-denatured CTX III sample. The path length of the optical cell used for all CD measurements was 1 mm. All data were acquired at 5 °C, and the change in ellipticity at appropriate wavelengths (213 and 270 nm) was monitored as a function of time. The kinetic data were expressed as a sum of exponential terms. Nonlinear least squares curve fitting was used to obtain the number of exponential phases with their amplitudes and apparent rate constants. All experiments were carried out at 5 ± 0.1 °C using a RQF-63 rapid mixing quenched-flow apparatus (Hi-Tech Scientific Co.). Complete denaturation and exchange of the backbone amide protons with deuterium was achieved by dissolving CTX III (30 mg/ml) in 6 m deuterated guanidine hydrochloride in D2O at pH 6.6 ± 0.2. Deuterated guanidine hydrochloride was obtained through repeated cycles of dissolving ultrapure GdnHCl in D2O followed by repeated lyophilization. Refolding of the denatured protein was initiated by 10-fold dilution with 50 mmglycine-d 5 (pH 3.0) in H2O. At this pH, negligible labeling occurred. After variable refolding times ranging from 9.8 to 190.4 ms, the solution was diluted again to 10 times the initial protein volume with 0.2 m sodium borate (pH 9.6) to initiate labeling of the deuterated amides in CTX III with protons. After a lapse of 10 ms, the labeling pulse was stopped by a further 3.4-fold dilution of the initial protein volume with 1m HCl in water. The final pH was about 3.2, at which the hydrogen/deuterium exchange (for the amides in native CTX III) was minimal. It should be mentioned that there were no signs of intermolecular aggregation of the protein during any of the refolding steps in the quenched-flow experiment. This was ensured from the steady state CD (in the far UV region) and 1H one-dimensional NMR spectra of the refolded protein sample. It should be mentioned that absorbance of the refolded protein sample(s) at 300 nm also did not indicate aggregation of the protein during refolding. After the final step of refolding, the protein samples were concentrated by ultrafiltration at 4 °C. A magnitude COSY spectrum of each sample was recorded on a 600-MHz NMR spectrometer at 5 ± 0.1 °C. 256 increments over 1024 data points were collected. All of the NMR data were processed using UXNMR software on a Silicon Graphics workstation. The intensities of the intraresidue (CαH, NH) cross-peaks were normalized based on the aromatic cross-peak (CδH, CεH) intensities of Phe25 and Tyr22. The proton occupancy of individual amides at the zero time point of refolding were obtained by a 10-fold dilution of the 6 m GdnDCl-denatured CTX III (in D2O) with the pulse labeling borate buffer in H2O at pH 9.6. It is important to mention that the first step of initiation of folding (without the exchange) at pH 3.6 using HCl-glycine buffer used at other refolding time points is eliminated for the zero time point proton occupancy estimation. The pulse labeling step using the borate buffer (pH 9.6) process ensures exchange of all deuterium atoms by protons and also the protein folds back to its native state. The intensities of the cross-peaks of the residues in the fingerprint region of the COSY spectrum at this time point (the zero time point) represent the initial proton occupancy. It is pertinent to mention that the relative percentage proton occupancy of individual residues at the zero time point (and in subsequent refolding times) was estimated by comparing with the amide proton intensities of the corresponding residues in the fingerprint region of the COSY spectrum of the protein dissolved in D2O at pH 3.6. The intensities of the cross-peaks of the individual amide protons of the native protein dissolved in D2O at pH 3.6 are assumed as 100%. The time courses of change in proton occupancies were fitted to a single exponential decay (y = Aexp−kt + C, where A is the amplitude of the phase, k is the apparent rate constant, and Cis the final amplitude) by the Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear least squares method, yielding rate constants and phase amplitudes in the kinetic folding experiment. All data analysis were performed using Kaleidagraph software (Synergy Software). Equilibrium unfolding as a function of GdnHCl concentration was monitored by far and near UV CD spectroscopy. CTX III is an all β-sheet protein lacking in tryptophan residues. Hence, the ellipticity changes at various concentrations of GdnHCl were examined at 213 nm (far UV region) and 270 nm (near UV region). It was ensured that the protein is completely unfolded at 6 mGdnHCl. The ellipticity changes can be fitted to a two-state model (native ↔ unfolded) for unfolding (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 shows the equilibrium denaturation curve obtained for CTX III at pH 6.8, 25 °C, using GdnHCl as the denaturant. In both far UV (213 nm) and near UV (270 nm), CD gave nearly superimposable denaturation curves, and therefore the unfolding process of CTX III has been assumed to fit to a two-state model (data not shown). The free energy of unfolding in the absence of denaturant was obtained by linear extrapolation of ΔG(D) to zero denaturant concentration. The values obtained for ΔG U(H2O) from the GdnHCl denaturation profile monitored at 213 and 270 nm were similar within experimental error. The m G value, which is a measure of the cooperativity of the unfolding reaction, was found to be 0.67 kcal·mol−1·m−1. The concentration of denaturant (C m) at which the protein (CTX III) is half-unfolded (when ΔG U = 0) is estimated to be 4.75 m, by monitoring the changes in ellipticity at 213 nm. The renaturation of CTX III from the 6.0m GdnHCl obtained by monitoring the ellipticity changes at 213 nm is depicted in the inset of Fig. 2. It can be deduced from the refolding curve that the unfolding CTX III by GdnHCl is perfectly reversible (Fig. 2, inset), and this aspect helps us to understand the molecular events in the folding pathway of the protein (CTX III). The refolding kinetics of CTX III was monitored by using stopped-flow fluorescence and stopped-flow CD techniques. The lack of tryptophan in the protein necessitated the use of ANS as an extrinsic probe to monitor the folding kinetics by stopped-flow fluorescence. When ANS is present during refolding, it is found to bind strongly to the protein within 8 ms (Fig. 3), which is close to the dead time of mixing in the stopped-flow instrument. As a consequence, the rise in ANS emission cannot be monitored accurately. As the folding of protein proceeded, the emission intensity of ANS increased in the burst phase and then decreased steadily in the slow phase (Fig. 3,inset). The decrease in the ANS fluorescence signal is triphasic with time constants of τ1 = 50.1 ± 7.0 ms, τ2 = 291.5 ± 4.0 ms, and τ3 = 5.5 ± 1.8 s. The kinetic curve reveals that most of the changes in the ANS fluorescence are complete within 200 ms (Fig. 3). Stopped-flow CD experiments were carried out to complement the fluorescence data by investigating the formation of secondary structure (far UV CD) and tertiary structure (near UV CD) during the folding process of CTX III. The kinetics of refolding measured from ellipticity change(s) at 270 nm arising from the tyrosine residues are shown in Fig. 4 A. This figure shows that most of the changes are over in the first phase of refolding, which occurs within 100 ms. The 270-nm ellipticity changes have been fitted to a three-exponential decay function. An initial phase starting at 12.3 ms rapidly decays within 20 ms. To overcome the technical problems of curve fitting, we have ignored fitting the initial phase. The ellipticity changes occurring at higher refolding times have been fitted by shifting the zero time point to 20 ms. The remainder of the CD signal evolves within about 200 ms. The refolding kinetics of CTX III monitored in the far UV region at 213 nm (Fig. 4 B) presents several interesting features. In the time range (20 ms) just above the dead time of the stopped-flow CD instrument, the ellipticity value at 213 nm decreased significantly (Fig. 4 B). During this phase, the changes in the ellipticity at 270 nm (Fig. 4 A) are minimal, are similar to the ellipticity values during this time period, and are similar to those obtained for completely unfolded CTX III at this wavelength (270 nm). After the burst phase decrease, the ellipticity value at 213 nm increased slowly to attain the value of the native protein. Such an “overshoot” behavior as shown in Fig. 4 B has been reported in several other proteins (17Kuwajima K. Yamaya H. Sugai S. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 806-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and has been attributed to the formation of nascent nonnative helix formation during the burst phase of folding of proteins (17Kuwajima K. Yamaya H. Sugai S. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 806-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 18Hamada D. Segawa S.I. Goto Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 868-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). To examine if the overshoot in CTX III is due to the formation of nascent, nonnative helix formation, we carried out refolding experiments in a helicogenic solvent such as 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE). CTX III is an all β-sheet protein, and its three-dimensional solution structure reveals that no portion of the polypeptide chain of CTX III exists in helical conformation. Recently, it has been demonstrated that TFE nonspecifically induces helix conformation in CTX III (13Kumar T.K.S. Jayaraman G. Lee C.S. Sivaraman T. Lin W.Y. Yu C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 536-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) at higher concentrations (≥90%, v/v). It can be argued that if the CD overshoot phenomenon (as observed in CTX III) were due to the formation of nonnative helix, then refolding CTX III in TFE-water mixtures at concentrations less than 90% (v/v) would be expected to cause the intensity of the CD overshoot to increase due to the stabilization of the nascent, “non-native” helix. From the curves depicting the changes in the 222-nm ellipticity upon refolding CTX III in the buffer alone and in the buffer containing various TFE concentrations (Fig. 5), It is found that the CD overshoot signal in the burst phase of refolding does not show the expected increase in the ellipticity at 222 nm when the refolding of the protein is carried out separately in the refolding buffer containing 10 and 50% (v/v) concentrations of TFE (Fig. 5). Based on these results, we believe that the CD overshoot signal observed in CTX III may not be linked to the formation of transient, nonnative helical conformation. Chaffotte et al. (20Chaffotte A.F. Guillon Y. Goldberg M.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9694-9702Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), investigating the overshoot phenomenon in the early stages of refolding of hen egg white lysozyme reported that the “burst” of ellipticity (in the far UV CD region) that occurs in the dead time of the experiments does not reflect significant changes in the secondary structure of the protein. They believe that the CD overshoot essentially reflects changes in the state of side chains, with an important contribution arising from disulfide bonds (21Hider R.C. Kupryszewski G. Reskowski P. Lammek P. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 31: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Varley et al. (22Varley P. Gronenborn A.M. Christensen H. Wingfield P.T. Pain R.H. Clore G.M. Science. 1993; 260: 1110-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), studying the kinetics of folding of interleukin-1β, which is an all β-sheet protein but lacks disulfide bridges, did not observe the overshoot phenomenon. Similarly, in proteins such as cytochrome C, ubiquitin, and staphylococcal nuclease, which are also characterized by the lack of disulfide bridges, the anomalous far UV CD ellipticity overshoot phenomenon is not observed (20Chaffotte A.F. Guillon Y. Goldberg M.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9694-9702Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). It appears that there exists a strong correlation between the overshoot of CD ellipticity in the burst phase of refolding and the presence of disulfide bonds in the native state of the protein. In conclusion, the results presented thus far clearly indicate that the CD overshoot phenomenon is in some way related to the attainment of asymmetry of the disulfide bonds during the process of protein folding. To understand the contribution of the disulfide bonds to far UV CD overshoot phenomenon observed during the refolding of CTX III, we studied the “refolding” of S-carboxymethylated CTX III. There were no significant change(s) in the ellipticity (at 213 nm) values upon refolding. Importantly, the overshoot in the 213-nm ellipticity is not observed when the S-carboxymethylated CTX III sample dissolved in 6 m GdnHCl is diluted (refolded) 10 times with the refolding buffer. Thus, the results of these experiments unambiguously demonstrate that the far UV CD overshoot phenomenon observed during the refolding of CTX III is significantly linked with the asymmetrization of the disulfide bridge(s) in the protein. It is of interest to note that the CD overshoot phenomenon is not observed when CTX III treated with 2 m GdnHCl (at this concentration of GdnHCl, the structure of CTX III is unperturbed) is refolded with the refolding buffer, indicating that the overshoot in the CD signal is connected with the reorganization of tertiary structural interactions during the refolding of CTX III (data not shown). The 270-nm tyrosine ellipticity evolves completely only after 50 ms (Fig. 4 A), and hence the possibility of the far UV CD overshoot being associated with the attainment of the asymmetric environment of the optically active aromatic residues is remote. However, at the present juncture, we cannot totally exclude this possibility. In addition, our results show that, at least in the refolding of CTX III, no transient, nonnative helix conformation(s) is formed during the early stages of protein folding. Since the amide protons in CTX III have been assigned in the two-dimensional COSY NMR spectrum (14Sivaraman T. Kumar T.K.S. Huang C.C. Yu C. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1998; 44: 29-39PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bhaskaran R. Huang C.C. Chang D.K. Yu C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1291-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), it is possible to unambiguously follow the kinetic protection for 43 separate amide residues involved in secondary and tertiary structural interactions (Fig. 6). These amide protons are distributed throughout the molecule. All the residues were adequately described by a single-exponential decay (Fig. 7). The time constants τ (the inverse of rate constant, k) of refolding of the various residues are listed in Table I. If we arbitrarily subdivide the time constants in Table I into two classes, fast (τ < 20 ms) and slow (τ > 40 ms), then the residues in the fast class appear to be primarily associated with the hydrophobic core of the molecule, whereas those in the slow class are mostly located on the periphery of the folded protein structure. Comparison of the time constants of the various residues listed in Table I suggests that there could be initial rapid hydrophobic collapse occurring during the refolding of the protein. Interestingly, the time constants of Lys23, Ile39, Val49, Tyr51, Val52, Cys53, Asp57, and Arg58 are less than 20 ms (Table I). In the native state of the protein, these residues are distributed in both the structured and unstructured regions of the CTX III molecule. The small refolding time constant of Lys2 (τ = 21.0 ms) is worth mentioning. The solution structure of CTX III (12Kumar T.K.S. Lee C.S. Yu C. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 391: 115-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 15Bhaskaran R. Huang C.C. Chang D.K. Yu C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1291-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) reveals that the amide proton of Lys2 is hydrogen bonded to the carbonyl group contributed by Arg58. This interaction tethers the N- and C-terminal ends of the CTX III molecule together. Comparing the time constants of folding of Lys2 with those of the residues involved in the initial “hydrophobic collapse,” it appears that the clustering of hydrophobic residues in the early stages of folding (<20 ms) helps the N- and C-terminal ends of the molecule come to close proximity. This aspect favors a hydrogen bond formation between Lys2 NH and Arg58 CO, which could promote the formation of the native tertiary structural interactions in the subsequent stages of folding. In the native state of the molecule, the amide proton of Val49 is involved in hydrogen bonding with the carbonyl group of Thr46, forming a type 1 β-turn (12Kumar T.K.S. Lee C.S. Yu C. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 391: 115-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 15Bhaskaran R. Huang C.C. Chang D.K. Yu C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1291-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The significantly small folding time constant for Val49 (τ = 5.5 ms) could be attributed to the very early formation of the type 1 β-turn in the backbone of the polypeptide chain between Thr46 and Val49 (Table I).Figure 7Comparison of the observed time courses of amide proton occupancy of a selected residues as a function of the length of the folding time. All residues were fit to a first order exponential decay (for further details, see “Experimental Procedures”). Panel A depicts the percentage of proton occupancy of residues located in the secondary structure region. Lys2 (K2) belongs to the double-stranded β-sheet segment. Cys21 (C21), Ile39 (I39), and Val52(V52) belong to the triple-stranded β-sheet segment. The percentage of proton occupancy for residues located in the unstructured regions (Leu6 (L6), Lys18(K18), Thr29 (T29), and Val41 (V41)) are represented in panel B. Since the changes in the proton occupancy are not completed within the refolding time of 190.4 ms for the residues given in panel B, a clear time-dependent asymptote (C) could not obtained for t"

Protein C, which is a vitamin K-dependent zymogen of a serine protease synthesized in the liver, plays an important role in the regulation of blood coagulation. Activated protein C functions as an anticoagulant by inactivating two of the regulatory proteins of the coagulation pathway, factors Va and VIIIa (1Walker F.J. Fay P.J.

Furthermore, activated protein C stimulates fibrinolysis through the neutralization of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (3van Hinsberg V.W.M. Bertina R.M. van Wijngaarden A. van Tilburg N.H.

HNF-1 binding to and HNF-1 transactivation of the protein C promoter was abolished in a promoter construct where the naturally occurring −14 T → C mutation (13Berg L.P. Scopes D.A. Alhaq A. Kakkar V.V. Cooper D.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 2147-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) had been introduced. This mutation is associated with type I protein C deficiency (13Berg L.P. Scopes D.A. Alhaq A. Kakkar V.V. Cooper D.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 2147-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It is shown here that this HNF-1 binding site also binds HNF-6, a recently cloned liver-enriched transcription factor (17Lemaigre F.P. Durviaux S.M. Truong O. Lannoy V.J. Hsuan J.J. Rousseau G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9460-9464Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). HNF-6 contains a bipartite DNA binding region consisting of a novel type of homeodomain and of a single cut domain (17Lemaigre F.P. Durviaux S.M. Truong O. Lannoy V.J. Hsuan J.J. Rousseau G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9460-9464Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In the liver, HNF-6 controls the activity of genes that code for plasma carrier proteins and for enzymes regulating glucose metabolism (17Lemaigre F.P. Durviaux S.M. Truong O. Lannoy V.J. Hsuan J.J.

This work shows that HNF-6 stimulates the protein C gene promoter and that a mutation in this promoter, which is associated with protein C deficiency in patients, leads to a loss of HNF-6 binding and activity. Finally, promoter sequences located both upstream and downstream of the HNF-6/HNF-1 binding site are important for transactivation by both HNF-6 and HNF-1.

The nucleotides underlined in the sequences are not present in the protein C promoter region and introduce SmaI or Eco1CRI sites in the PCR fragments. Amplifications were performed in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 10 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mmKCl, 350 ng of primers, 100 ng of genomic DNA, 250 μmdNTPs, 60 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.3 unit of Taqpolymerase. After an initial incubation at 91 °C for 4 min, 32 cycles were carried out at 91 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. The pCAT00 vector (19Crossley M. Brownlee G.G. Nature. 1990; 345: 444-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) was used to make reporter constructs containing protein C promoter sequences driving chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene expression. PCR-amplified DNA fragments were digested with SmaI and cloned into the SmaI site of pCAT00. The reporter constructs were named to indicate the length of the promoter fragment as follows: pCCAT493 (5′pr1/3′pr1), pCCAT291 (5′pr2/3′pr1), pCCAT267 (5′pr3/3′pr1), pCCAT237 (5′pr4/3′pr1), pCCAT190 (5′pr5/3′pr1), pCCAT469* (5′pr1/3′pr2), and pCCAT434* (5′pr1/3′pr3). To create pCCAT162 the naturally occurring StuI (–GGA/CCT–) restriction site at position −55 of pCCAT493 was used. To introduce the −14 mutation in pCCAT493, two fragments of the human protein C promoter region, spanning nucleotides −396 to −33 (fragment 1) and nucleotides −13 to +122 (fragment 2), were amplified with primers 5′pr6/3′pr4 and 5′pr7/3′pr5, respectively. Both PCR fragments 1 and 2 were digested by Eco1CRI and equal amounts were ligated for 16 h at room temperature. The ligation mixture was PCR-amplified with primers 1 and 3 and the 472-base pair fragment, consisting of protein C promoter regions −396 to −42 and −5 to +107 separated by an Eco1CRI site, was digested by SmaI. Subsequently, the 457-base pair fragment was cloned in the SmaI site of the CAT00 vector. This reporter construct was named pCΔ-41/-5CAT493. The double-stranded oligonucleotide 5′-GGCCAAGCAAATATTTGTGGTTATGGACTAACTCGAA-3′ (-41 to -5) was cloned into the Eco1CRI site of pCΔ−41/−5CAT493. The integrity of all constructs was verified by sequencing. The human hepatoma cell line HepG2 (ATCC no. HB8065) and the SV40-transformed African green monkey kidney cell line COS 7 (ATCC no. 1651-CRL) were cultured in minimal essential medium containing Earle's salts and nonessential amino acids supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Cells were seeded at a density of approximately 1 × 105 cells/60-mm tissue culture dish. After 24 h, a DNA mixture containing 6 μg of protein C-CAT reporter construct, 2 μg of β-galactosidase expression vector (pCH110) (20Herbomel P. Bourachot B. Yaniv M. Cell. 1984; 39: 653-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), and 1.5 μg of nonspecific plasmid pUC13, was transfected into the cells by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (21Graham F.L. van der Eb A. J. Virol. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref Scopus (6483) Google Scholar). For cotransfection experiments, 1 μg of HNF-1α expression vector and/or 2 μg of HNF-6 expression vector were added, unless stated otherwise. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested, and β-galactosidase activity was measured (22Edlund T. Walker M.D. Barr P.J. Rutter W.J. Science. 1985; 230: 912-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The CAT activity of each construct was determined as described previously (23Seed B. Sheen J.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar) and normalized to β-galactosidase activity. All transfections were repeated two to six times in duplicate, with at least two different plasmid preparations, and data from representative experiments are shown. HNF-6 was in vitro transcribed and translated using the TnT SP6 coupled wheat germ system (Promega Corporation BNL, The Netherlands) according to the manufacturer's protocol, in a final volume of 50 μl (17Lemaigre F.P. Durviaux S.M. Truong O. Lannoy V.J. Hsuan J.J. Rousseau G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9460-9464Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The crude wheat germ extract containing translated protein was used directly in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). Rat liver nuclear extracts were prepared as described (24Hattori M. Tugores A. Veloz L. Karin M. Brenner D.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 777-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). HNF-1- or HNF-6-containing COS 7 cell extracts were prepared as follows. The cells (6 × 105) were transfected for 6 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal calf serum by lipofection using DOTAP and 10 μg of pRSV-HNF-1 or pECE-HNF-6. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the COS 7 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 1 ml of 40 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.9), 500 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20% (v/v) glycerol. After three freeze-thaw cycles, the lysates were centrifuged and the supernatants were collected. Human hepatoma HepG2 cell extracts were prepared following the same procedure as for COS 7 cell extracts. Human protein C gene: pCwt 5′-TTTGTGGTTATGGATTAACTCGAACT-3′ (−28 to −3); pCmt 5′-TTTGTGGTTATGGACTAACTCGAACT-3′ (−28 to −3); rat pyruvate kinase gene: PK-H1, 5′-CTAGCTGGTTATACTTTAACCAGG-3′ (−96 to −73); rat HNF-3β gene: HNF-3β, 5′-AGCTTAAGGCCCGATATTGATTTTTTTTTCTCC-3′ (−150 to −118); rat α2-urinary globulin gene: UG-HNF-6, 5′-AAATGTATTATTGATAAAATCAAT-3′ (−202 to −179). The −14 T → C mutation is underlined in the pCmt oligonucleotide. EMSAs were performed with 3 μl of liver nuclear extract, 3 μl of in vitro transcribed/translated HNF-6, and 5 μl of COS 7 or HepG2 cell extract, in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 2 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 ng of32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide. After an incubation of 20 min on ice, free DNA and DNA-protein complexes were separated by electrophoresis on a 6 or 8% polyacrylamide gel with 0.5× TBE buffer at 4 °C. Competing oligonucleotides (50-fold molar excess) or preimmune or immune serum were added to the incubation mixture 20 min prior to addition of the 32P-labeled probe. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography at −80 °C for 16 h. As shown in Fig. 1, the sequence of the HNF-1 site identified previously (13Berg L.P. Scopes D.A. Alhaq A. Kakkar V.V. Cooper D.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 2147-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) in the human protein C gene promoter is compatible with the consensus reported for HNF-6 binding (17Lemaigre F.P. Durviaux S.M. Truong O. Lannoy V.J. Hsuan J.J. Rousseau G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9460-9464Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 25Samadani U. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6273-6284Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To determine whether HNF-6 actually binds to this region of the protein C promoter, EMSAs were performed with recombinant HNF-6. As shown in Fig. 2 A (lane 2), HNF-6 transcribed/translated in a wheat germ extract formed a complex with the pCwt oligonucleotide. This complex was absent when unprogrammed wheat germ extracts were used as a source of proteins (Fig. 2 A, lane 1). To confirm that this complex was due to HNF-6 binding, the experiments were repeated with a labeled probe (UG-HNF-6) known to bind HNF-6 (25Samadani U. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6273-6284Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 A (lanes 5–7), the complex formed between HNF-6 and the UG-HNF-6 oligonucleotide was competed not only with the corresponding unlabeled oligonucleotide, but also with the unlabeled pCwt oligonucleotide.Figure 2Determination of HNF-6 and HNF-1 binding to the wild-type and mutant human protein C promoter. A, the labeled pCwt (lanes 1 and 2), pCmt (lanes 3 and 4), or UG-HNF-6 oligonucleotide (lanes 5–8) was incubated with an unprogrammed wheat germ extract serving as a negative control (lanes 1 and 3) or with in vitro translated HNF-6 (lanes 2 and 4–8) in the absence (lanes 1–5) or presence of a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled UG-HNF-6 (lane 6), pCwt (lane 7), or pCmt (lane 8) oligonucleotide.B, the labeled pCwt oligonucleotide was incubated with liver nuclear extract (liver), COS 7, or HepG2 cell extracts as indicated. COS 7 cell extracts were made from untransfected (lane 6) cells or from cells transfected with the HNF-6 expression vector pECE-HNF-6 (lane 7) or with the HNF-1 expression vector pRSV-HNF-1 (lane 8). Addition of preimmune (lane 4) or anti-HNF-6 (lane 5) serum, or of competing unlabeled oligonucleotides known to bind HNF-1 (oligonucleotide PK-H1,lane 2) or HNF-6 (oligonucleotide HNF-3β) is as indicated (lane 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, the pCwt oligonucleotide was tested in EMSAs with liver nuclear extracts as a source of proteins. Several complexes were detected (Fig. 2 B, lane 1). One complex (labeled HNF-1) was prevented by an excess of the unlabeled HNF-1-binding oligonucleotide PK-H1 (26Vaulont S. Puzenat N. Levrat F. Cognet M. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B,lane 2). Also, this complex co-migrated with that formed between the probe and recombinant HNF-1 produced in COS 7 cells transfected with an HNF-1 expression vector (Fig. 2 B,lanes 1, 6, and 8). Consistent with previous results (13Berg L.P. Scopes D.A. Alhaq A. Kakkar V.V. Cooper D.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 2147-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), it was concluded that this complex, seen with liver extracts, results from HNF-1 binding to the probe. Another complex (labeled HNF-6) was prevented by the addition of a competing amount of oligonucleotide HNF-3β, previously shown to bind HNF-6 (25Samadani U. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6273-6284Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). This complex was inhibited by addition of anti-HNF-6 serum in the binding reaction, but not by addition of preimmune serum (Fig. 2 B, lanes 4 and 5). In addition, the complex formed between the probe and recombinant HNF-6 obtained by transfection of COS 7 cells, co-migrated with the complex seen with liver nuclear extracts (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1, 6, and 7). The conclusion from these observations was that the complex seen with liver nuclear extracts results from binding of HNF-6 to the pCwt probe. Two minor complexes (Fig. 2 B, open arrowheads) were also observed. These complexes are specific as an excess of unlabeled probe (data not shown) prevented them. The identity of the proteins involved was not investigated in the present work. Finally, incubation of the pCwt probe with HepG2 cell extracts produced two complexes that co-migrate with those obtained with recombinant HNF-1 and HNF-6, suggesting that the latter proteins are also expressed in this human hepatoma cell line (Fig. 2 B, lane 9). The question as to whether HNF-1 and HNF-6 binding to the probe is mutually exclusive was then investigated. EMSAs were performed with binding reactions containing a fixed amount of HNF-6-containing COS 7 cell extracts and increasing amounts of HNF-1-containing extracts. As shown in Fig. 3 (lanes 1–6), increasing amounts of HNF-1 inhibited formation of the HNF-6-probe complex, without production of a ternary complex. The reverse experiment was also performed. Addition of increasing amounts of HNF-6-containing COS 7 cell extracts to a mixture containing a fixed amount of HNF-1-containing extracts led to inhibition of HNF-1-probe complex formation (Fig. 3, lanes 7–12). These experiments showed that binding of HNF-6 and HNF-1 to the −22 to −10 region of the protein C gene promoter is mutually exclusive. To determine the influence of the −14 T → C promoter mutation on the binding affinity of HNF-6 for the protein C promoter, EMSAs were performed with an oligonucleotide containing an identical mutation (pCmt). This mutation clearly reduced HNF-6 binding (Fig. 2 A, lane 4). Moreover, HNF-6 binding to the UG-HNF-6 oligonucleotide could be totally prevented by the corresponding unlabeled oligonucleotide and by the unlabeled pCwt oligonucleotide, but not by the pCmt oligonucleotide (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5–8). The next question was whether HNF-6 was able to transactivate the protein C promoter. HepG2 and COS 7 cells were transfected with the protein C reporter construct pCCAT493 and an expression vector for HNF-6. As shown in Fig. 4 A, transfection of HepG2 cells with HNF-6 increased transcription from the wild-type protein C promoter approximately 3-fold. When a construct containing the −14 T → C mutation was used, basal activity was severely reduced and transactivation by HNF-6 was abolished. Similarly, in COS 7 cells the wild-type, but not the mutant promoter, was also stimulated by HNF-6 (Fig. 4 B). As expected, HNF-1 also transactivated the reporter construct in COS 7 cells. However, overexpression of HNF-1 in HepG2 cells resulted in a significant decrease in protein C promoter activity. Dose-response experiments (Fig. 5) showed that this inhibitory effect started with as little as 0.5 μg of HNF-1 expression vector. These observations contrasted with those of Berg et al.(13Berg L.P. Scopes D.A. Alhaq A. Kakkar V.V. Cooper D.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 2147-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), who showed that the protein C gene promoter is transactivated 1.5-fold by HNF-1 in HepG2 cells. This discrepancy could have been due to the absence of the nontranslated first exon (nucleotides +1 to +52) or the first part of intron 1 in the protein C reporter construct used by Berg et al. (13Berg L.P. Scopes D.A. Alhaq A. Kakkar V.V. Cooper D.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 2147-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), which ranges from nucleotides −618 to +7. The experiments were therefore repeated in HepG2 cells with constructs partially devoid of exon/intron 1 (pCCAT469* and pCCAT434*). As shown in Fig. 6, both deletion constructs displayed an approximately 2-fold lower protein C promoter activity compared with the wild-type promoter. The effect of HNF-1 on these 3′ deletion constructs was then determined. In contrast to the exon/intron 1-containing pCCAT493 construct, both pCCAT469* and pCCAT434* were transactivated about 3-fold by the addition of HNF-1 (Fig. 6).Figure 5Influence of HNF-1 on the expression of the protein C promoter. A plasmid construct with the CAT gene under the control of the −386 to +107 protein C promoter region (pCCAT493) was tested in transiently transfected HepG2 cells for CAT activity in the absence or presence of different amounts of HNF-1 expression vector.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Structure and activity of protein C promoter reporter constructs. Plasmid constructs with the CAT gene under the control of different protein C promoter fragments were tested for CAT activity in transiently transfected in HepG2 cells with 1 μg of HNF-1 expression vector (white bar), 2 μg of HNF-6 expression vector (hatched bar), or without expression vector (black bar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The observation that HNF-1 activity was controlled by neighboring 3′-cis sequences led to a search for other modulatory sequences. A number of 5′-deletion constructs were tested for both basal activity and transactivation by HNF-1. As shown in Fig. 6, deletion of the −386 to −185 region (pCCAT291) slightly reduced basal transcriptional activity, while deletion of the −184 to −161 region (pCCAT267) had no effect on basal activity. Cotransfection experiments with HNF-1 resulted for both pCCAT291 and pCCAT267 in a clear reduction in promoter activity. Further deletion of nucleotides −160 to −131 (pCCAT237) slightly reduced basal activity. However, cotransfection with the HNF-1 expression vector up-regulated the activity of pCCAT237. Deletion of nucleotides −130 to −84 (pCCAT190) had no effect on basal activity, whereas the deletion of nucleotides −83 to −56 (pCCAT162) resulted in an approximately 4-fold reduction in protein C promoter activity. The influence of the −83 to −56 region was consistent with data from Miao et al. (14Miao C.H. Ho W. Greenberg D.L. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9587-9594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The expression of both pCCAT190 and pCCAT162 was up-regulated by addition of the HNF-1 expression vector. Finally, experiments were conducted to determine whether the sequences involved in the control of HNF-1 activity also influenced the HNF-6 response. HepG2 cells were cotransfected with each protein C reporter construct and an expression vector for HNF-6. This revealed that all constructs were transactivated by HNF-6. However, the full length construct (pCCAT493) and the two longest 5′-deletion constructs (pCCAT291 and pCCAT267) were transactivated to a slightly higher extent than the other deletion constructs (Fig. 6). The −14 T → C mutation in the protein C promoter region is associated with type I protein C deficiency (13Berg L.P. Scopes D.A. Alhaq A. Kakkar V.V. Cooper D.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 2147-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 27Reitsma P.H. Poort S.R. Bernardi F. Gandrille S. Long G.L. Sala N. Cooper D.N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 69: 77-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present study shows that the protein C promoter region contains an HNF-6 responsive element at position −21 to −12. The −14 T → C mutation reduced the binding of HNF-6 and abolished the transcriptional response to overexpressed HNF-6. The HNF-6 responsive element completely overlaps with a previously described HNF-1 responsive element, located at position −22 to −10 (13Berg L.P. Scopes D.A. Alhaq A. Kakkar V.V. Cooper D.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 2147-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It was shown earlier that the −14 T → C mutation abolishes binding and activity of HNF-1 (13Berg L.P. Scopes D.A. Alhaq A. Kakkar V.V. Cooper D.N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 2147-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The EMSAs reported here did not show formation of a ternary complex between HNF-6, HNF-1, and the DNA probe. This strongly suggests that HNF-6 and HNF-1 bind in a mutually exclusive way to the protein C gene promoter. Apparently both transcription factors compete for binding to the protein C promoter. The results also suggest that sequences located upstream and downstream of the HNF-6/HNF-1 site increase the basal activity of the promoter and inhibit the effect of HNF-1. Indeed, deletion of a 24-base pair intronic region from the 3′ part of the reporter construct (pCCAT469*) or deletion of a 30-base pair region (nucleotides −160 to −131) from the 5′ part of the construct (pCCAT237) decreased promoter activity and converted the inhibitory effect of HNF-1 to a stimulatory effect. Examination of the intronic region reveals the presence of a –GGGTGTGG– sequence at position nucleotides +83 to +90, which resembles a TEF-2 consensus sequence (28Faisst S. Meyer S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). The nucletotides −160 to −131 region contains two out of three sequence polymorphisms (C/T at nucleotides −153 and A/G at nucleotides −140) (29Spek C.A. Poort S.R. Bertina R.M. Reitsma P.H. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1994; 5: 309-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), which have been shown to be associated with variations in protein C plasma levels and thrombotic risk (30Spek C.A. Koster T. Rosendaal F.R. Bertina R.M. Reitsma P.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1995; 15: 214-218Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this region contains a 5′-GGCAGAGGT-3′ sequence, located at position −139 to −131, which is conserved between species. 2C. A. Spek, R. M. Bertina, and P. H. Reitsma, manuscript submitted for publication. The role of the putative intronic TEF-2 site and of the upstream polymorphic and conserved sequences in protein C promoter regulation requires further investigation. At present, there is no good explanation for the difference in HNF-1 effects observed with different promoter constructs. One possibility is that in transfected cells HNF-6 displaces HNF-1 from the protein C promoter and acts as a stronger transactivator. In this case, displacement may depend on the length of the promoter in the construct. This would be in line with the observations by Tsay et al.(16Tsay W. Lee Y.M. Lee S.C. Shen M.C. Chen P.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) who showed that binding of transcription factors to the protein C promoter involves synergistic interactions. Alternatively, factors that bind to the longer promoter constructs, which tend to possess stronger basal activity, may specifically be squelched by overexpressed HNF-1. Whatever the explanation, the question remains as to whether HNF-1, HNF-6 or both are important for protein C promoter activity in vivo. Experiments aimed at identifying the occupancy of the protein C promoter in intact tissues, based on in vivofootprinting, might resolve this intriguing issue. When introduced in a promoter context that cannot be activated by HNF-1, the −14 T → C mutation still induced a severe drop in basal activity. This mutation also led to the loss of HNF-6 binding to, and activation of, the protein C promoter. The activity of HNF-6 was clearly less context-dependent than that of HNF-1. This study therefore questions the role of HNF-1 in protein C promoter activity and uncovers a function for HNF-6. In addition, this is the first report describing the putative involvement of HNF-6 and of an HNF-6 binding site in human pathology. We thank L. Nolte for HNF-1-containing COS 7 cell extracts and M.

https://openalex.org/W2334063917,"In order to determine the effects of mismatch repair (MMR) deficiencies in sporadic colorectal carcinomas, 45 such cancers were examined using a sensitive method called crypt isolation technique. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the MSH2 or MLH1 gene was more frequently observed in replication error (RER) (+) carcinomas than in RER (−) carcinomas, which implied that loss of one normal allele could partly affect repair capacity. MSH2 gene defects at both alleles were observed in two carcinomas, which showed severe repair deficiencies. Interestingly, unlike the situation observed in the p53 gene, the MSH2 and MLH1 genes did not show complete LOH. Novel crypt isolation-based subpopulation (CISP) analysis demonstrated that at least two distinct carcinoma subpopulations existed in most carcinomas that showed incomplete LOH; one with and one without LOH. In one carcinoma that had germline mutation and somatic incomplete LOH of the MSH2 gene, the mutator phenotype was only observed in populations affected in both alleles. Thus, the MSH2 gene appears to possess the two hits mechanism of tumor suppressor genes. However, unlike the tumor suppressor genes, MMR gene defects lead to a unique mode of colorectal tumorigenesis characterized by intratumoral heterogeneity."
https://openalex.org/W2331700970,"Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is recognized as a T cell growth factor. We have previously reported that human carcinoma cell lines are inhibited in growth by exogenous IL-2, which binds to the IL-2 receptor β (IL-2Rβ) chain ubiquitously expressed on the surface of tumor cells. A possibility was considered that IL-2Rβ on carcinomas responsible for negative signaling was different from that expressed on hematopoietic cells. To investigate this possibility, mRNA for the IL-2Rβ chain was amplified and compared in carcinoma and lymphoid cells. Using RT–PCR with pairs of sense-antisense oligonucleotide primers specific for the various regions of extracellular, transmembrane and intracellular domains of the IL-2Rβ chain, we amplified mRNA obtained from three human carcinoma cell lines and human lymphoid cells as controls. The identity of the amplicons was confirmed by Southern analysis with the 32P-labeled cDNA probe coding for the entire span of the IL-2Rβ chain. In addition, genomic DNA obtained from the tumor cell lines was sequenced to examine the possibility that a mutation is present in the gene coding for the intracellular IL-2Rβ chain domain. No mutations or deletions were detected. The message for all three domains of the β chain was identical in tumor cells and in normal lymphoid cells used as controls. Also, by Western blot and northern analyses no differences between IL-2Rβ chain in tumors vs that expressed in lymphoid cells were demonstrable. The IL-2Rγ chain, which participates in IL-2/IL-2R signaling pathway, was expressed in tumor cells. Expression of JAK1 transcripts in these cells was comparable to that in lymphocytes. However, RT–PCR analysis identified differences in expression of JAK3 splice variants (B and M) in tumor cells. These differences may be responsible for altered downstream signaling by IL-2. Overall, our data indicate that the same IL-2/IL-2R pathway is operative in human carcinomas and in normal epithelial or lymphoid cells."

https://openalex.org/W1972165581,"Malignant Melanoma of Soft Parts (MMSP) is associated with the EWS/ATF1 fusion protein that arises due to chromosomal fusion of the Ewings Sarcoma oncogene (EWS) and the cellular transcription factor ATF1. EWS/ATF1 can activate several cAMP-inducible promoters, suggesting that cellular transformation in MMSP might involve constitutive activation of cAMP-inducible promoters. To assess this possibility we have examined the status of the cAMP-signaling pathway in the available MMSP-derived cell lines (DTC1 and Su-ccs-1) and find that both cell lines share several features. First, in contrast to previous effects observed in transient assays, three chromosomal promoters containing ATF binding sites are not constitutively activated by endogenous EWS/ATF1 in MMSP cells. Second, all the components that are known to be required for cAMP-inducible transcription are present. Third, phosphorylation of the cAMP-response-element-binding protein (CREB) can be efficiently induced by cAMP. Fourth, cAMP is unable to activate transcription, as assessed by a GAL4/ATF1 reporter assay and analysis of the c-fos and adenovirus early promoters. Thus, cell lines derived from MMSP have a block to cAMP-signaling that lies downstream of CREB phosphorylation. In light of the cAMP-responsiveness of almost all mammalian cell types, our findings suggest that the inability to respond to cAMP might be an important feature of MMSP cells."
https://openalex.org/W1965766212,"Spi-1/PU.1 is a member of the Ets family of transcription factors important in regulation of hematopoiesis. We have isolated a chicken cDNA homologuous to the mammalian Spi-1/PU.1 gene with an open reading frame of 250 amino acids (aa). The chicken Spi-1/PU.1 protein is 14 aa and 16 aa shorter than its human and mouse counterparts but is extremely well conserved with 78.8% and 75.2% identity respectively. The carboxy terminal DNA binding region, or ETS binding domain, is 100% identical to that of human and mouse. Some differences with the mammalian homologues are seen in the N-terminal part of the protein and in the PEST connecting domain. However, the differences are mainly conservative and all the features underlying functional aspects seem preserved. The major discrepancy lies in a 12 aa deletion in an already poorly conserved part of the PEST sequence. Spi-1/PU.1 transcripts were detected at high levels in spleen and Fabricius bursa of chick embryos by Northern blot and in situ hybridization. Our results show that the chicken Spi-1/PU.1 protein behaves like a bonafide Spi-1/PU.1 transcription factor in its DNA binding and transactivating properties."

Protein sequencing and immunological analysis indicated that this protein is elongation factor 2 (EF-2). We propose that calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase III is responsible for the PTA-dependent EF-2 phosphorylation based on the following lines of evidence: (a) Ca2+ is required for the effect; (b) calmodulin enhances the reaction, and calmodulin inhibitors block the phosphorylation; and (c) no phosphorylation is seen in cell extracts depleted of calmodulin-binding proteins. To obtain a strong phosphorylated EF-2 band, we found it necessary to add PTA to cytosolic extracts from synchronized dividing cells in various phases of the cell cycle except in mitosis. Since PTA is a nuclear protein everywhere in the cell cycle except in mitosis, when it is found in the cytoplasm, we hypothesize that, if PTA activates EF-2 phosphorylation in vivo, as present data suggest, its presence in the cytoplasm during mitosis could explain why EF-2 phosphorylation is mainly restricted to that phase of the cell cycle. Moreover, other bands in addition to EF-2 were phosphorylated in a calmodulin- and PTA-dependent manner, and several of them (in a range between 50 and 60 kDa) have similar M r to those that conform to the holoenzyme calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II, suggesting that PTA could have a more general function modulating the activity of various Ca2+/CaM-dependent enzymes along the cell cycle.

Chem. 1992; 267: 8692-8695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PTA has been found phosphorylated, although the physiological relevance of this finding is not known (19Barcia M.G.

On the other hand, the intracellular signaling pathways governing PTA expression are poorly known. PTA expression seems to be under the direct control of MYC (21Eilers M. Schirm S. Bishop J.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 22Gaubatz S Meichle A. Eilers M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3853-3862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Desbarats L. Gaubatz S.

Biol. 1995; 15: 6999-7009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) did not confirm this finding. Recently, Vareli et al. (26Vareli K. Tsolas O. Frangou-Lazaridis M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have reported that the transcription factor E2F activates a reporter gene under the PTA promoter, indicating that E2F could directly control PTA expression. Calcium, an intracellular second messenger, is known to regulate various cellular responses. Many aspects of calcium action are mediated by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaM-kinases). There are different CaM-kinases controlling a wide range of physiological processes including cell proliferation (27Means A.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In the present report, we assessed phosphorylation changes in response to PTA presence in cell extracts and found that the phosphorylation state of several proteins was affected. One of them was identified as the eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (EF-2), suggesting that PTA activates CaM-kinase III, thus providing a new link between calcium and other mitogenic signaling pathways. PTA from bovine thymus was obtained from Peninsula Laboratories Europe. Calmodulin from bovine brain and calmodulin-agarose were from Sigma. Calmodulin inhibitors trifluoperazine and W-7 were purchased from Calbiochem. [γ-32P]ATP was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. A polymerase chain reaction-modified human PTA cDNA (28Goodall G.J. Domı́nguez F. Horecker B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8926-8928Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) was subcloned in the NdeI–EcoRI sites of a T7–7 bacterial expression vector (29Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar), and the recombinant plasmid pEP was introduced into BL21(DE3)/pLysS cells (Novagen). Bacterial cultures were grown to A 600 ∼ 1.0 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 1 h. Cells harvested by centrifugation were resuspended in 5% perchloric acid, sonicated, and cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatant (perchloric soluble fraction) was stored at −80 °C. Perchloric soluble fraction was neutralized with NaOH and precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ethanol at −20 °C overnight. Precipitated proteins were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and subjected to phenol extraction (30Sburlati A.R. Manrow R.E. Berger S.L. Protein Expression Purif. 1990; 1: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) using 1 volume of phenol saturated in 0.3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, 150 mm NaCl at 65 °C. After vigorous mixing and centrifugation, purified PTA was recovered in the aqueous phase, desalted through a Sephadex G-50 minicolumn, and precipitated with ethanol as above. Pellets were now resuspended in water and stored at −80 °C for no longer than 1 month. Protein purity and concentration was determined by SDS-PAGE. NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humid atmosphere, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine. Cells were synchronized as described by Zalvide et al. (4Zalvide J.B. Cancio E. Alvarez C.V. Regueiro B.J. Domı́nguez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8692-8695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human promyelocytic leukemia tumor cell line HL-60 was grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 2 mm glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum. Fisher rat thyroid cells, FRTL-5, were cultured in Coon's modified Ham's F-12 medium in the presence of a 5H hormone mixture as described previously (31Alvarez C.V. Zalvide J.B. Cancio E. Diéguez C. Regueiro B.J. Vega F.V. Domı́nguez F. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 11: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by trypsinization (monolayer cultures) or centrifugation (suspension cultures), washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm sucrose, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and sonicated. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was purified by gel filtration through Sephadex G-50 and eluted in sucrose-free homogenization buffer. Protein concentration in the supernatant was quantified with the Bio-Rad dye-binding assay. To deplete extracts of CaM-binding proteins, 2 mg of the cell extract were made 2 mm Ca2+ by the addition of CaCl2 and diluted 1:1 in washing buffer (40 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The diluted extract was then incubated with 400 μl of CaM-agarose beads during 30 min at 4 °C. After incubation, the mixture was centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected and stored. Standard phosphorylation assays (50 μl) were performed with 5–20 μg of cell extract in 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 3 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaF, and 0.1 mm CaCl2 in the presence or absence of the indicated amounts of PTA, EGTA, and CaM. Phosphorylation was started by the addition of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min and then stopped by the addition of electrophoresis sample buffer. Phosphorylated products were analyzed on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels under reducing conditions. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Samples for sequence analysis were reduced with dithiothreitol and pyridylethylated with 4-vinylpyridine in the sample buffer prior to running the gel electrophoresis. After Coomassie staining, the 105-kDa band was excised from the gel and subjected to “in gel” digestion with trypsin essentially as described by Hellman et al. (32Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Goñez J. Heldin C.H. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Resulting internal tryptic fragments were isolated by narrow bore reversed phase liquid chromatography on a μRPC C2/C18 SC 2.1/10 column, operated in SMART System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Amino acid sequence analysis of selected fragments was performed on an ABI model 470A gas phase sequenator, following the manufacturer's instruction. Cell extracts phosphorylated in the phosphorylation assay were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters. These were incubated overnight with a 1:2000 dilution of anti-EF-2 antiserum (33Nairn A.C. Bhaget B. Palfrey H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7939-7943Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Detection was performed with the Western Light Immunoblotting System (Tropix). When cell extracts obtained from exponentially growing NIH3T3 cells were incubated in the presence of radioactive ATP, several phosphorylated bands were observed. The addition of PTA to the reaction affected this pattern, stimulating the phosphorylation of some of these proteins. Initially, we focused on one of them, with an apparent molecular mass of 105 kDa (p105), that was very weakly or not at all phosphorylated in the absence of PTA (Fig. 1 A), and its phosphorylation was induced by PTA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B). Both bovine PTA and human recombinant PTA were active in the phosphorylation assay (data not shown); thus, we used human PTA to obtain the data reported in the present work. As seen in Fig. 1 C, PTA also induced the phosphorylation of a 105-kDa protein in extracts prepared from FRTL-5 and HL-60 cell lines, a normal rat and a human tumor cell line, respectively, indicating that the PTA-induced phopshorylation of the 105-kDa band might be a common phenomenon in mammalian cell lines. When a large amount (20 μg) of cell extract was used, the phosphorylation of p105 was observed even in absence of exogenous PTA. Decreasing the ratio of cell extract to added PTA produced a concomitant reduction of the phosphorylated p105 band, pointing out that the stimulation of phosphorylation is dependent on the amount of the extract added to the sample. To gain an insight into the conditions needed for the phosphorylation of p105, we explored its Ca2+ requirements. The addition of EGTA abolished the PTA-induced p105 phosphorylation, while the addition of Ca2+, at concentrations as low as 0.1 μm, restored that effect, showing that the presence of Ca2+ is required for the phosphorylation effect (Fig. 2). The p105 band was isolated from HL-60 extracts, and its internal peptide fragments were obtained by the in gel digestion procedure. Two fragments were characterized with the following sequences: FSVSPVV and FDVHDVTLHADAI. These sequences corresponded with the fragments 499–505 and 702–714 of EF-2. Further immunological analysis by Western blot, using a polyclonal antibody against EF-2 (a generous gift from Dr. Angus C. Nairn), showed that indeed p105 and EF-2 comigrate in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). Moreover, we found that PTA modified the phosphorylation of EF-2 without affecting the amount of this protein present in the cell extract. To our knowledge, CaM-kinase III is the only known kinase that phosphorylates EF-2, and EF-2 is the only known substrate for CaM-kinase III, at least in vitro (34Nairn A.C. Picciotto M.R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). So we studied whether the PTA-induced phosphorylation of EF-2 might be mediated by CaM-kinase III. To do this, we exploited the fact that CaM-kinase III binds CaM with high affinity and depleted the cell extracts of CaM-binding proteins by means of CaM affinity chromatography. As Fig. 4 shows, EF-2 phosphorylation was not detectable in the presence of PTA when the extracts were depleted from CaM-binding proteins despite the fact that EF-2 was still present (albeit at half the amount present in total extracts (data not shown)), strongly suggesting that CaM-kinase III, a CaM-binding protein, mediates the effect of PTA. Since calmodulin is the main activator of CaM-kinases, we tested the effect of the simultaneous addition of PTA and CaM to cell extracts. Fig. 5 A shows that the simultaneous addition of PTA and CaM caused a reinforcement of phosphorylated EF-2 band in a synergistic way. Other bands in a range between 50 and 60 kDa were phosphorylated in a CaM- and PTA-dependent manner (Fig. 5 A, open arrow). Next, to determine if PTA-stimulated phosphorylation of EF-2 depended on CaM activity, two widely used CaM inhibitors were employed in the reactions. W-7 inhibited the stimulation due to PTA alone or to the addition of PTA plus CaM (Fig. 5 B), and trifluoperazine inhibited the PTA effect in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5 C). We further investigated the PTA-induced phosphorylation of EF-2 in different stages of the cell cycle. Such phosphorylation was not detectable when reactions were performed with extracts from serum-starved quiescent NIH3T3 cells even in the presence of exogenous PTA, pointing out that some essential factor is not present, at least in sufficient amounts, in quiescent cells; this essential factor is not EF-2 that was present in the quiescent extracts as seen by Western blot (data not shown). Eight hours after serum refeeding, PTA induced the phosphorylation of EF-2 (Fig. 6 A). PTA-dependent phosphorylation of EF-2 was detectable in extracts from cells synchronized at different points between S and M phases of the cell cycle. The basal phosphorylation of EF-2, without exogenous PTA, was also seen albeit at a lower amount than when PTA was added (Fig. 6 B). Interestingly, in nocodazole-arrested cells, the addition of PTA was not necessary to see a strong band of phosphorylated EF-2 (Fig. 6 B). In all samples, the band of phosphorylated EF-2 reached similar intensity in the presence of PTA, independently of the basal phosphorylation observed, suggesting that the stimulated pathway is the same in both cases (with or without exogenous PTA). Since PTA is a nuclear protein everywhere in the cell cycle except in mitosis, when it is found in the cytoplasm (data not shown), nocodazole-arrested cells (mitotic cells) represent a situation when PTA-induced EF-2 phosphorylation might have a physiological significance, since PTA, CaM-kinase III, and EF-2 are found together in the cytoplasm. Here we report that in cell extracts PTA stimulates the phosphorylation of several proteins. Initially, we focused on one of them, with an apparent molecular mass of 105 kDa, that was very weakly or not at all phosphorylated in the absence of PTA, and its phosphorylation was induced by PTA in a dose-dependent manner. Two fragments of this band were characterized with sequences that were identical to the eukaryotic elongation factor 2, an essential factor for the extension of the polypeptide chain in the ribosome. Further immunological analysis by Western blot, using a polyclonal antibody against EF-2, confirmed this identity, showing that indeed p105 and EF-2 comigrated in SDS-PAGE. Moreover, we found that PTA modified the EF-2 phosphorylation without affecting the amount of EF-2 present in the cell extract. To our knowledge, CaM-kinase III is the only known kinase that phosphorylates EF-2 (34Nairn A.C. Picciotto M.R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We think that CaM-kinase III is responsible for the PTA-stimulated EF-2 phosphorylation based on the following evidence: (a) Ca2+ is required; (b) calmodulin enhances the reaction, and calmodulin inhibitors block the phosphorylation; (c) no phosphorylation is seen in extracts depleted of CaM-binding proteins. Moreover, we found PTA-induced phosphorylation of EF-2 in various cell lines in agreement with the finding that CaM-kinase III has a widespread tissue distribution (33Nairn A.C. Bhaget B. Palfrey H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7939-7943Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). On the other hand, quiescent, nonproliferating cells did not show kinase activity despite the addition of PTA to the reaction, indicating that some other factor was lacking in the extracts from nonproliferating cells. This finding could be explained by the fact that CaM-kinase III is present at low levels in nondividing cells (35Brady M.J. Nairn A.C. Wagner J.A. Palfrey H.C. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 1034-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 36Bagaglio D.M. Cheng E.H.C. Gorelick F.S. Mitsui K. Nairn A.C. Hait W.N. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2260-2264PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which PTA stimulates EF-2 phosphorylation is not clear now. Several scenarios can be proposed: (a) PTA may directly act on CaM-kinase III; (a) PTA may displace CaM from binding sites on proteins present in the cell extracts, increasing its availability to bind CaM-kinase III; or (c) PTA may bind to EF-2 and conformationally alter the latter, resulting in exposure of new sites of phosphorylation. These alternate scenarios may be distinguished by future experiments. When eukaryotic cells undergo mitosis, the rate of protein synthesis declines by up to 35–40%. This decline is due to phosphorylation of EF-2 (37Celis J.E. Madsen P. Ryazanov A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4231-4235Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), since this phosphorylation affects the rate of translation (38Nairn A.C. Palfrey H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17299-17303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Ryazanov A.G. Shestakova E.A. Natapov P.G. Nature. 1988; 334: 170-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). To obtain a strong phosphorylated EF-2 band, we found it necessary to add exogenous PTA to cytosolic extracts prepared from synchronized dividing cells in the various phases of the cell cycle except in mitosis. In mitotic cell extracts, the addition of exogenous PTA did not further enhance EF-2 phosphorylation, as if the reaction was already saturated with endogenous PTA. Interestingly, PTA is a nuclear protein throughout the cell cycle except in mitosis, when it is found in the cytoplasm; therefore, if PTA modulates EF-2 phosphorylation, as present data suggest, then it could be explained why EF-2 phosphorylation is mainly restricted to mitosis despite the presence of both CaM-kinase III and EF-2 in the cytoplasm throughout the cell cycle. Moreover, other bands in addition to EF-2 were phosphorylated in a CaM- and PTA-dependent manner (Fig. 5 A); the apparent molecular masses of these bands (in a range between 50 and 60 kDa) are similar to those reported for the different subunits that conform the holoenzyme CaM-kinase II. Initial evidence obtained by Western blot using an anti-CaM-kinase II antibody points to the fact that these bands are in fact CaM-kinase II, 2A. Vidal, G. Barisone, F. V. Vega, V. Hellman, C. Wernstedt, and F. Domínquez, unpublished observations. suggesting that PTA could have a more general function modulating the activity of various Ca2+/CaM-dependent enzymes throughout the cell cycle. MYC has been reported to induce PTA expression (21Eilers M. Schirm S. Bishop J.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 22Gaubatz S Meichle A. Eilers M. Mol. Cell.

Wenzel A. Löhr A. Schwab M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 803-812PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, E2F has also been implicated in promoting PTA expression (26Vareli K. Tsolas O. Frangou-Lazaridis M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Here we present evidence that PTA modulates the activity of CaM-kinases. Therefore, if the present findings are confirmed in vivo, PTA could represent a novel link between various intracellular signaling mitogenic pathways such as Ca2+, MYC, and E2F. Studies to assess this issue are currently under way. We thank Dr. Angus C. Nairn (Rockefeller University, New York) for providing anti-EF-2 antiserum.
