This work was extended later to include both natural and synthetic œstrogens2–4, and these findings indicated that in both male and female animals œstrogens possess a strong stimulating influence on the reticulo-endothelial system, which results in the appearance of large numbers of macrophages in the spleen, liver and lymph nodes, and the mobilization of these macrophages into the circulation. In the above researches, the try pan blue method was used to assess the activity of the reticulo-endothelial phagocytes. These results have since been confirmed by the carbon method, and it has been found that the strongest stimulants of the reticulo-endothelial system possess high œstrogenicity5,6."

https://openalex.org/W2051763228,"AN aqueous dosimeter capable of measuring radiation doses of less than 100 rads would be an extremely useful tool in the field of radiobiology. Although doses of a few rads can be accurately measured using the resorcinol-stabilized tetrachlorethylene-dye systems1, such systems where the radiation-induced reaction proceeds by a chain mechanism exhibit certain undesirable characteristics. An alternative to the radiation-induced chain reaction involves the measurement of extremely small amounts of an irradiation product by means of a sensitive analytical technique. Some idea of the extreme sensitivity required is obtained from the fact that a dose of 100 rads will produce approximately 10−7 moles of product per litre of solution, assuming a reasonable production-rate of unity for G
prod. (that is to say, 1 molecule of product formed per 100 eV. absorbed). An analytical method capable of accurate measurement at such high dilution is spectrophotofluorometry. The production of salicylic acid (which fluoresces in aqueous solution) in irradiated aqueous solutions of benzoic acid seemed to merit investigation, especially because this reaction had been proposed2 as suitable for chemical dosimetry."

https://openalex.org/W2065171535,"REMOVAL of the adrenal glands results in a rise in the level of adrenocorticotrophic hormone in the blood of the rat. Cox and Hodges1 reported that this increase did not occur until two weeks after adrenalectomy and that, after three to five weeks, there existed a remarkably high concentration of circulating hormone. These results were not inconsistent with the findings of Fortier2, who showed that adrenalectomy caused a marked increase in the pituitary content of adrenocorticotrophic hormone after a similar time-lapse. It appears that there is an interval of at least two weeks before the rat pituitary gland adapts itself to secrete and maintain this enormously increased output of adrenocorticotrophic hormone in response to the absence of circulating corticoids. Therefore, it was of interest to compare the response to stress in adrenalectomized rats with low blood levels of corticotrophin with that in adrenalectomized animals with high blood levels of the hormone."

https://openalex.org/W2011055201,"VARIOUS lines of evidence, for example, involvement of sulphydryl groups and adenosine triphosphatase, suggest that the rate-limiting process for muscular contraction may be proton transfer. In this event, one would expect the rate of either isometric or isotonic contraction to be slowed up in the presence of heavy water (D2O). According to a recent analysis1, which of the two most affected will depend on whether activation or production of tension is involved."
https://openalex.org/W1973372454,SYSTEMATIC investigations of the electrophoretic behaviour of hæmoglobins of various vertebrates have so far been carried out mainly on the higher forms. We have started to investigate the electrophoretic behaviour of hæmoglobin of the cyclostome Petromyzon planeri in the adult or in the ammocoetes stage.

https://openalex.org/W2052432220,A RELATION between the thymus and the growth hormone of the anterior pituitary has been assumed by many authors. It is known that injections of this hormone result in an enlargement of the thymus1. A more thorough investigation of the interaction between these two glands seemed of interest.

https://openalex.org/W2050639702,"THEORETICALLY, cancer therapeutic agents should be able to differentiate between malignant and normal human cells and should be more toxic to the malignant cells. However, human leukæmic lymphocytes and cancer cells did not show, in in vitro studies1,2, any greater sensitivity than normal cells to X-rays and chemotherapeutic agents. These disappointing results led to tests on the capacity of heterologous sera to discriminate between cells."
https://openalex.org/W1971229296,"BATE-SMITH1 observed that a methanol extract of white flowers of Camellia japonica turned red after heating with dilute hydrochloric acid. This suggests that leuco-anthocyanin is present in the white flowers. By the same procedure I found that red flowers of several horticultural varieties of C. japonica contained leuco-anthocyanin yielding cyanidin, as well as a glycoside of cyanidin."

The cytochrome was separated to some extent from the cytochromes a and c which were also present, but it remained attached to particles which were thrown down by centrifugation at 20,000g."

https://openalex.org/W1975996424,MOST methods used for the estimation of strychnine in nux vomica lead to gross inaccuracies due to brucine interference. Even oxidation of brucine with nitric acid under optimal condition (5 min. at 60° C.) leads to errors due to partial destruction of strychnine1. Gravimetric estimations also require amounts greater than 0.1 gm. in the sample1.
