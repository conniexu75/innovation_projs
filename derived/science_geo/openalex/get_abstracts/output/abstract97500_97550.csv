https://openalex.org/W1524875319,"Ca2+-activated, phospholipid-dependent protein kinase recently found in mammalian tissues (Takai, Y., Kishimoto, A., Iwasa, Y., Kawahara, Y., Mori, T., and Nishizuka, Y. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 3692-3695) is inhibited by various phospholipid-interacting drugs such as chlorpromazine, imipramine, phentolamine, dibucaine, verapamil, and tetracaine. This effect is attributed to the inhibition of the activation process but not to the interaction with the active site of enzyme. This is supported by the fact that a catalytic fragment of this enzyme, which is obtained by limited proteolysis with Ca2+-dependent neutral protease, is fully active without without Ca2+ and phospholipid and is not susceptible to any of these drugs. Kinetic analysis suggests that these drugs cause such inhibition competitively with phospholipid. None of these drugs appears to compete with Ca2+ or to counteract the unique effect of unsaturated diacylglycerol. Unsaturated diacylglycerol has been shown previously to increase markedly the affinity of enzyme for Ca2+ as well as for phospholipid and thereby serve as an initiator for the activation of this protein kinase. Neither cyclic AMP-dependent nor cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase is susceptible to these phospholipid-interacting drugs."

https://openalex.org/W2143046500,"Ca2+ release from liver mitochondria induced by N-ethylmaleimide, diamide, inorganic phosphate, palmitoyl-coenzyme A, and oxaloacetate occurs by a common mechanism. With all agents, a collapse of membrane potential, uptake of hydrogen ion, progressive acceleration of respiration, and large amplitude swelling accompanies Ca2+ release. These findings indicate that the agents promote an increase in the permeability of the inner membrane and that Ca2+ release can be explained under these conditions without invoking the action of a Ca2+ release carrier. The increase in permeability produced by the Ca2+-releasing agents requires the accumulation of exogenouse Ca2+. Sr2+ and Mn2+ cannot substitute for Ca2+ and the permeability increase is prevented by nupercaine. Free fatty acid accumulation in the mitochondria accompanies the increase in permeability. Polyunsaturated fatty acids accumulate more rapidly than saturated plus monounsaturated fatty acids, which indicates the accumulation of 1-acyllysophospholipid. Any inhibitor or condition which prevents the permeability change also prevents the accumulation of lysophospholipid, suggesting that these compounds cause the permeability increase. As Ca2+ release and swelling proceed, there is an accompanying oxidation of pyridine nucleotides. This oxidation occurs both with releasing agents which can oxidize the nucleotides through the action of mitochondrial enzymes as well as with agents which cannot. Any inhibitor or condition which prevents the increase in permeability also largely prevents the oxidation of pyridine nucleotides. The increase in the NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H ratio produced by the releasing agents can be explained as an effect secondary to the increase in permeability and collapse of the mitochondrial pH gradient rather than a primary cause of Ca2+ release."
https://openalex.org/W1579064499,"In a normal tissue culture medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, purified rat Schwann cells divide very slowly. We have previously reported that the cells are stimulated to divide by an activity present in extracts of the brain and pituitary (Brockes, J.P., Fields, K.L. and Raff, M.C. (1979) Brain Res. 165, 105-118), and this activity appears to be both novel and restricted in its distribution (Raff, M.C., Abney, E.R., Brockes, J.P. and Hornby-Smith, A. (1978) Cell 15, 813-822). The pituitary activity has been purified over 4000-fold from a pool of 10 kg of frozen glands and 4000 lyophilized anterior lobes. The activity was assayed by the incorporation of 125I-UdR into DNA of Schwann cells growing in microwells. The most purified (phosphocellulose) fraction was analyzed on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and displayed a major band of 3 x 10(4) molecular weight which was approximately 25% of the stained material. When analyzed by native gel electrophoresis at pH 4.5 followed by a second dimension of sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, the activity was consistently associated with this component. The effect of the phosphocellulose fraction on proliferation of central glial cells in dissociated cultures of the rat corpus callosum was also investigated by using fluorescent antisera to identify the cells and [3H]thymidine autoradiography to assay proliferation. The oligodendrocytes and macrophage-like microglia were not significantly stimulated, but the astrocytes were stimulated over the same range of concentration as Schwann cells. The activity against astrocytes and that against Schwann cells co-migrated in native gel electrophoresis at pH 4.5, providing strong evidence that the same molecule acts on both cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2031103691,"We have used cloned adult X. laevis α- and β-globin cDNAs to analyze globin genes in X. laevis DNA. We detected α1- and β1-globin genes which contain intervening sequences and code for the major adult globins, plus additional diverged α2- and β2-globin genes of unknown coding potential. Unlike the case in mammals, the X. laevis α1- and β1-globin genes are closely linked and occur in the sequence 5′-α1-9 kb-β1-3′. The α2- and β2-globin genes are also linked, and analysis of globin genes in X. tropicalis suggests that this duplication of an α-β-globin gene pair in X. laevis is the result of chromosome duplication by tetraploidization. The close linkage of α- and β-globin genes in Xenopus provides evidence that vertebrate α- and β-globin genes evolved by tandem duplication of a single primordial globin gene."
https://openalex.org/W1537562549,"Monoclonal antibody to the mouse histocompatibility antigen, H-2k, was derivatized with palmitic acid using an activated ester of N-hydroxysuccinimide. About 70% of the resulting amphipathic antibody could be incorporated into liposomes by a detergent-dialysis method. The antibody-bound liposomes were about 900 A in diameter and were heterogeneous in terms of the number of antibody molecules per liposome. These liposomes showed specific binding affinity to mouse L-929 cells (H-2k), but not to A-31 cells (H-2d), whereas native liposomes showed no detectable binding to either cell type. The specific binding of anti-H-2k-bound liposomes to L-929 cells could be blocked by a preincubation of cells with an excess of free, underivatized anti-H-2k antibody but not by normal mouse IgG. Using a fluorescent phospholipid, liposomes containing anti-H-2k specifically labeled L-929 cells but not A-31 cells in a mixed culture. Liposomes containing normal mouse IgG did not significantly label either cell type. These results clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of the monoclonal antibody for liposome targeting."

https://openalex.org/W2084043863,"We report the nucleotide sequence of a rabbit beta-globin pseudogene, psi beta 2. A comparison the psi beta 2 sequence with that of the rabbit adult beta-globin gene, beta 1, reveals the presence of frameshift mutations and premature termination codons in the protein coding sequence which render pse beta 2 unable to encode a functional beta-globin polypeptide. psi beta 2 contains two intervening sequences at the same locations in the globin protein coding sequence as beta 1 and all other sequenced beta-globin genes. An examination of the DNA sequences at the intron/exon junctions suggests that a putative pse beta 2 precursor mRNA could not be spliced normally. We compare the flanking and noncoding sequences of pse beta 2 and beta 1 and discuss the evolutionary relationship between these two genes."
https://openalex.org/W1514659744,"The monovalent ionophore, monensin, has been found to inhibit the secretion of both procollagen and fibronectin from human fibroblasts in cell culture. The kinetics of inhibition, as well as those for the release of inhibition, suggested that both proteins may be cotransported in the cell. In the present study, we have examined the intracellular translocation and release into the culture medium of procollagen and fibronectin, in the presence or absence of monensin. Pulse-chase studies were combined with subcellular fractionation of the fibroblasts to determine the rates of intracellular movement. We found that monensin did not significantly affect either the subcellular fractionation, or the distribution of organelle marker enzymes along the gradient, and that procollagen moved from a region of high buoyant density (primarily endoplasmic reticulum), through a mid-density region (primarily Golgi elements), to a region of low buoyant density before exiting from the cell. Monensin markedly decreased the rate of transit from one region to the other; kinetic analysis of the data showed a greater than 3-fold decrease in the rate constants for intracellular movement into the low buoyant density components and thence to the culture medium. The density gradient distribution of fibronectin was affected by monensin in similar fashion, indicating that it and procollagen probably follow the same intracellular route. Since monensin causes both proteins to accumulate in highest abundance in regions of the density gradient corresponding to Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum, the site of ionophore blockade appears to be within the Golgi apparatus. Thus, procollagen and fibronectin share a common intracellular route prior to entering the Golgi region of the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1628555587,"Rat liver cytosol contains proteins and smaller molecules that affect activities of the microsomal enzymes of cholesterol biosynthesis. One protein (mr = 12,000) has been purified by chromatography, gel filtration, and preparative isoelectric focusing. Properties of the protein on sodium dodecyl sulfate-, and anodic-, and cathodic-disc gel electrophoresis are reported in addition to gel filtration and electrofocusing that were used for purification. By comparison of these properties, amino acid compositions, ligand binding, and the abundance in various tissues the protein appears to be very similar to Z-protein that has been shown by others to be identical with hepatic fatty-acid binding protein. The same properties also appear to be very similar to sterol carrier protein. A cytosolic metabolite, heme, which stimulates 4-methyl sterol oxidase, is bound to the protein during purification. When endogeneous heme is removed, both protein and heme are required for maximal stimulation of microsomal 4-methyl sterol oxidase activity. Hemoglobin produces an equal extent of stimulation presumably by heme group exchange, but the nonexchangeable heme group of cytochrome c is ineffective. Thus, the cytosolic protein may promote uptake and retention of relatively more water-soluble substances into the hydrophobic environment of the membrane-bound enzymes of cholesterol biosynthesis. Z-protein exhibits affinity for an exceptionally wide variety of ligands (e.g. fatty acids, azodyes, organic anions, bile pigments, etc) that may either stimulate or inhibit the microsomal enzymes. Accordingly, with the suggestion that the cytosolic protein is Z-protein, the wide variety of potential interactions of both endogenous metabolites and exogenous xenobiotics may account, in part, for facile modulations of activities of the rate-limiting microsomal synthetic enzymes in various physiological and nutritional states."

https://openalex.org/W1497333828,"Microtubule disassembly has been studied using a rapid dilution technique (Karr, T.L., and Purich, D.L. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 10885-10888). Disassembly curves, generated by computer from the solution of series first order differential equations (see following paper), were fit to experimental data with excellent agreement when the diluted microtubules contained no microtubule-associated proteins. The rate constant for dimer release from microtubules was found to be 154 s-1. Assuming a critical tubulin concentration of 8 to 9 x 10(-6) M, the apparent bimolecular rate constant (2 x 10(7) M-1 s-1) for assembly is near the diffusion limit. It was also possible to use the rapid dilution technique for quantitatively correlating the disassembly rate to the number concentration of microtubule ends. These findings suggest that the dynamics of tubulin interactions with microtubules may be characterized in terms of an endwise depolymerization model. A re-evaluation of cold induced depolymerization kinetics (see miniprint supplement) is also fully consistent with our analysis of disassembly dynamics."

https://openalex.org/W1546202523,"The activity of the serotonin transporter of platelet plasma membrane may be assessed by its ability to bind [N-methyl-3H]imipramine, even in the presence of detergents which disrupt the membrane and inactivate serotonin transport. Of the 21 detergents which were tested for their ability to solubilize the transporter in an active form, some, such as Triton X-100, inactivate imipramine-binding activity in a manner which is difficult or impossible to reverse, while inactivation by others, such as cholate, is readily reversed by gel filtration. Of the detergents which do not inactivate imipramine binding, most, such as the Tween series, also fail to solubilize significant amounts of the transporter. Of all the detergents tested, only one, digitonin, solubilized specific imipramine-binding activity. Imipramine binds to the digitonin-solubilized transporter with slightly reduced affinity, but in all other respects binding to intact and digitonin-solubilized membranes is identical. Thus, binding is, in both cases, saturable and Na+-dependent, and is reversed by serotonin. Furthermore, inhibitors of serotonin transport but not of serotonin-mediated platelet aggregation block imipramine binding to the soluble preparation. Sodium-dependent binding to the soluble extract is insensitive to K+, suggesting that separate sites on the serotonin transporter mediate the effects of effects of Na+ and K+."

The 500,000-dalton hydrogenase complex has been replaced by an NADPH-coenzyme F420 oxidoreductase. By use of this electron-generating reaction, the methylreductase was found to be localized in component C, an acidic protein fraction. In the presence of the oxidoreductase and the methylreductase, formation of methane under a nitrogen atmosphere was dependent upon the addition of NADPH, coenzyme F420, component B (a new cofactor of unknown structure), ATP, Mg2+, and methyl coenzyme M."
https://openalex.org/W1677992864,"Purified rat tail tendon collagen used in our in vitro assembly studies has been characterized by quasielastic light scattering. At 4 degrees C and neutral pH it behaves as a single monomeric species with a translational diffusion coefficient, D20,w, at infinite dilution of 0.78 X 10(-7) cm2/s. This value is consistent with a somewhat flexible rod (300 X 1.2 nm( having 0.5 to 1.0 g of associated water/g of protein. When the temperature of a neutral solution of this collagen (0.1 mg/ml) is raised to 26 degrees C to initiate assembly, D20,w decreases in 10 min or less to 0.15 X 10(-7) cm2/s (Step 1) and remains constant for about 50 min (Step 2). The material present during Step 2 behaves as if it were a single high molecular weight species. These results together with earlier turbidity studies are consistent with an assembly mechanism whereby during Step 1 monomer is rapidly converted to aggregates > 1500 nm long and"
https://openalex.org/W1514209292,"The alpha subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was partially reduced and S-alkylated with [2-14C]iodoacetic acid. The resulting derivative in which on the average 1.6 residues of cystine were modified was completely reduced and S-alkylated. The S-[14C]-carboxymethylated hCG-alpha was then subjected to hydrolysis with trypsin and the hydrolysate was fractionated by gel filtration. The radioactive fractions were further purified by high voltage paper electrophoresis at pH 4.7 to yield tryptic peptides, alpha T-1, alpha T-8, and alpha T-11a, containing 5, 2, and 3 S-carboxymethyl cysteinyl residues, respectively. These peptides were further fragmented by a variety of cleavage reagents such as cyanogen bromide, chymotrypsin, Staphylococcus aureus protease, subtilisin, and cathepsin C to isolate individual S-[14C]carboxymethylcysteine-containing peptides. After ensuring their purity, the specific radioactivity of each S-[14C]carboxymethylcysteine was determined following its isolation from the acid hydrolysate of the peptide by high voltage paper electrophoresis at pH 4.7. The 2 S-[14C]carboxymethylcysteine residues with identical specific radioactivity yielded the precise location of the disulfide bridge in the polypeptide chain. Thus, all five disulfide bonds in hCG-alpha were assigned and are located at positions 7 and 31, 10 and 32, 28 and 60, 59 and 87, and 82 and 84."
https://openalex.org/W2310592009,"The solution properties of human plasma apolipoprotein C-II (apoC-II) have been studied by analytical ultracentrifugation, circular dichroic spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy. ApoC-II self-associates in solution, even though no rigorous thermodynamic analysis of the mode of self-association could be established. The reversible denaturation of apoC-II by guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) proceeded in a sequential fashion. Initial disruption of protein self-association by 0.3 M GdmCl was followed by cooperative unfolding of monomeric protein at higher GdmCl concentratioans with a midpoint 1.1 M GdmCl. Based on tryptophan fluorescence quenching unfolded apoC-II was more permeable to penetration by small molecules than the self-associated protein. a very low free energy (delta GH2O = 2.8 kcal/mol) of denaturation was calculated from the GdmCl denaturation titration curve. Heating of apoC-II to 55 degrees C did not induce a reversible cooperative unfolding of the protein. Calculations, bsed on Chou-Fasman probability algorithms, reveal three sequential helical regions in apoC-II and one beta sheet structure (residues 61-74P. The locations of these regions are consistent with the known physiological functions of apoC-II."
https://openalex.org/W1670836808,"Squalene epoxidation of microsome-associated squalene is stimulated by a soluble protein termed supernatant protein factor (SPF) (Saat, Y. A., and Bloch, K. E. (1976)J. Biol. Chem. 251, 5155-5160). In the absence of SPF, the initial rate for microsome-bound squalene epoxidation is rapid for 5 to 10 min but falls off sharply thereafter. SPF does not affect the rapid initial epoxidation rate of reaction but maintains it for longer periods. This SPF effect on enzyme kinetics indicates that SPF facilitates the otherwise rate-limiting access of squalene to the epoxidse site. Trypsin treatment of microsomes totally inactivates squalene epoxidase. When such trypsin-treated squalene-containing microsomes are incubated with normal, squalene-free, enzymatically active microsomes, formation of squalene epoxide is not observed. However, if SPF is included in this system, conversion of squalene to 2,3-oxidosqualene occurs rapidly. Lowering the temperature from 37 degrees to 22 degrees C abolishes the SPF effect in assay systems containing either normal or trypsin-treated plus normal microsomes. These findings show that SPF promotes the transfer of squalene from one microsome population to another, i.e. intermembrane transfer of substrate."

Each peptide bond of the opiate peptides was formed by either papain, or alpha-chymotrypsin catalysis. N alpha-t-Butyloxycarbonyl amino acids and peptides or their esters served as carboxyl components, whereas amino acid and peptide phenylhydrazides were used as acceptor nucleophiles. After removal of the protecting groups, the free pentapeptides were purified to homogeneity. They exhibited naloxone-reversible opiate like activity in guinea pig ileum and mouse vas deferens assays. The present study indicates that enzymic synthesis is a useful tool for rapid preparation of homogeneous peptides with highest obtainable optical purity."
https://openalex.org/W1600246156,"The effect of thrombin and its derivative, diisopropylphosphoryl-thrombin on [3H]arachidonic acid metabolism is studied in cultured umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers. Thrombin causes a dose-dependent release of radioactivity from endothelial cells fed [3H]arachidonate. Thin layer radiochromatography of acidified supernatants reveals that most of the radio-activity is [3H]arachidonate and its metabolites, 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha and prostaglandin E2. Diisopropylphosphoryl-thrombin, which is enzymatically inactive, does not cause release of arachidonic acid or metabolites. A 50-fold excess of diisopropylphosphoryl-thrombin, despite causing 98% inhibition of binding of 125I-thrombin to its high affinity binding sites, does not inhibit thrombin-induced release. We conclude that the high affinity, active site-independent thrombin binding sites are not involved in thrombin-induced mobilization of esterified arachidonic acid."

https://openalex.org/W1485614026,"Dolichol is an isoprenoid lipid involved in the assembly of many membrane-bound and secreted glycoproteins. Dolichol biosynthesis can be considered as a branch of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway subsequent to the reaction catalyzed by beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, EC 1.1.1.34), the major regulatory enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis. Changes in reductase activity can also affect the rate of dolichol synthesis. Since the majority of plasma glycoproteins are synthesized by the liver, we have measured the rate of dolichol synthesis in mouse-liver slices after various treatments which alter hepatic beta-hydroxy-beta-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase activity in vivo. The rate of hepatic dolichol synthesis was decreased by dietary cholesterol and fasting, and increased by feeding cholestyramine. There is also a diurnal variation in the rate of dolichol synthesis. A plot of the rate of dolichol synthesis versus the rate of cholesterol synthesis suggests that, after the formation of isoprene units, the branch of dolichol biosynthesis is saturated at a lower concentration of isoprene intermediates than is required to saturate the branch of cholesterol biosynthesis. After 2 weeks of cholesterol feeding and the consequent depression of hepatic dolichol synthesis, the rate of [3H]mannose incorporation into liver and plasma glycoproteins was unchanged, indicating that the rate of dolichol biosynthesis was not rate-limiting for total glycoprotein synthesis under these conditions."

A single rate of NO binding of 1.8 X 10(7) M-1 S-1 is found at both pH 6 and pH 8. The rate of binding of NO to dimethyldeuterohemedisulfonate is much higher still at 5 X 10(8) M-1 S-1. The observed rate of NO binding to the protein is not affected by chain differences or by the R to T transition. It may measure the rate of diffusion of ligand to the vicinity of the heme site. The T state components have different NO dissociation velocity constants of 0.004 and 0.07 S-1. The apparent quantum yields for the T state components are approximately 0.035 and 0.0008; the high affinity component has the lower yield. A two-step scheme is used to explain the results. The presence of chain differences and allosteric states is reflected in the intrinsic binding rates of both NO and CO to the heme group."

The mechanism of this photooxidation, and that of certain mesomethyl-substituted model compounds, has been studied using 18O labeling with molecular oxygen. In all cases, the methine bridge carbon atoms were retained in the ring-opened photoproducts and both oxygen atoms incorporated into the acetylbilitriene photoproducts were derived from a single oxygen molecule. In this respect, ring opening of bacteriochlorophyll c derivatives and mesomethyl-substituted model compounds differs from the nonphotochemical (enzymatic) ring opening of heme which involves elimination of the methine bridge carbon atom as carbon monoxide and insertion of two oxygen atoms, each from a different molecule of molecular oxygen.

Recombination was observed to occur only near the lower bound temperature of the phase transition for each mixture. Similar experiments using binary mixtures of DMPC and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC) demonstrated that recombination occurs in a temperature range which is believed to approximate the lower bound of the phase transition for this mixture as well. The reactivity of both types of mixtures toward recombination with apolipoproteins was found to decrease with decreasing proportions of DMPC, even though the effect of DMPC was to decrease the transition temperature in DMPC/POPC mixtures and to increase the transition temperature in DMPC/DSPC mixtures. A mechanism for insertion of apolipoproteins into lipid bilayers is proposed in which the protein gains entry to the interior of the bilayer through a defect resulting from equilibrium fluctuations of state at the onset temperature of acyl chain melting."

Two of them, present almost exclusively as fully processed collagens, were alpha 1(I) and alpha 2 chains. The presence of a large excess of alpha 1 (I) chains over the normal ratio for type I collagen indicated that both type I collagen [alpha 1(I)]2 alpha 2 and [alpha 1(I)]3 or type I trimer were present both in the culture medium and in the extracellular matrix. The labeled alpha 1(I) chain had a CNBr peptide pattern superimposable on that of a standard alpha 1(I) chain from rat skin, but the intact radiolabeled chain differed from the standard in its migration on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels and elution position on CM-cellulose column and had a much higher hydroxylysine content. The other two collagen chains were present in the culture medium exclusively as partially processed procollagens. They constituted 60 to 70% of the collagenous proteins and had features corresponding to none of the known collagen types. They were separated by CM-cellulose chromatography and further characterized. Both contained interchain disulfide bonds in the pepsin-resistant portion of the molecule and, after pepsin digestion, eluted from CM-cellulose at lower salt concentrations than standard alpha 1(I) chain. One of them was characterized by a low hydroxyproline content and a high hydroxylysine content, with all the hydroxylysine present as glycosylgalactosyl derivative. The CNBr peptide patterns of these two unknown chains differed from each other, and did not correspond to those of any standard collagen chain examined. They may represent new collagen types specifically present in the intestinal basement membrane."

It was shown to catalyze specifically the reversible isomerization of D-galactose 6-phosphate to D-tagatose 6-phosphate, the apparent Km values being 9.6 mM and 1.9 mM, respectively. At equilibrium, the ratio of D-galactose 6-phosphate to D-tagatose 6-phosphate was 9.0. The enzyme was not simulated by mono- or divalent cations and was not inhibited by EDTA, but it was inactivated reversibly by the thiol reagent N-ethylmaleimide. Its molecular weight was estimated to be about 100,000 both by gel filtration and by sedimentation in a sucrose density gradient. Data on stability, pH optimum, and inducibility of the enzyme are also presented. An improved procedure for the chemical synthesis of D-tagatose 6-phosphate is described, and resolution of the anomers of D-tagatose 6-phosphate by gas-liquid chromatography is reported."
https://openalex.org/W1598055114,"The messenger RNA coding for the serum antifreeze protein of the winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus) was extracted from the liver polysomes of fish caught in November and was purified by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The length of the mRNA was 520 nucleotides measured by agarose gel electrophoresis in the pesence of methyl mercury. It sedimented between trout protamine mRNA (6 S) and rabbit globin globin mRNA (9-10 S) on sucrose density gradients. The purified antifreeze protein mRNA assayed in the mRNA-dependent reticulocyte lysate translation system incorporated 10 times as much alanine as arginine into a single translation product. the molecular weight of the primary translation product was 11,700 estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. Antifreeze protein mRNA was the only major mRNA species present in liver polysomes of fish caught in November but was absent in the liver polysomes of fish caught in April. This finding emphasizes the seasonal nature of antifreeze protein production in the winter flounder. A 32P-labeled cDNA prepared from the antifreeze protein mRNA was hybridized against total cellular RNAs from flounder liver. These RNA excess hybridizations showed that antifreeze protein mRNA is several orders of magnitude more abundant in liver in mid-November than in late August. This suggests that transcriptional control is involved in the seasonal expression of the antifreeze protein gene."

Over the course of several hours, specific changes in membrane transport accompanied this inhibition. Indomethacin stimulated the uptake of 2-aminobicyclo(2,2,1)heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH), inhibited the Na+-dependent active transport of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB), and methylaminoisobutyric acid (MeAIB), but had no effect on the uptake of thymidine, uridine, or 2-deoxyglucose. The stimulation of BCH transport was immediate and reversible. The uptake of BCH was Na+-independent and only slightly depressed by metabolic inhibitors (10 to 20%). Inhibition of AIB and MeAIB uptake, which was of gradual onset, and was observed with several anti-inflammatory drugs and was dependent on the concentration of drugs. Upon removal of drug, AIB and MeAIB transport gradually increased and reached a maximum prior to resumption of DNA synthesis and cell division. Thee effects involved changes in Vmax only. Neither the apparent affinity (Km) for amino acids nor rate of exodus (k, 0.7h-1 for BCH, 1.2h-1 for AIB) were altered. The uptake of MeAIB (and AIB) occurred by a low and a high affinity (Km = 0.27 mM) component. Indomethacin inhibited specifically the high affinity component which was shown to be Na+- and energy-dependent. Although this component was inhibited by treatment with agents that lowered ATP levels or blocked protein synthesis, the anti-inflammatory drugs appeared not to act through these mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W1533161125,"Sodium boro[3H]hydride treatment of holoaspartate aminotransferase results in the reduction of the Schiff's base formed between pyridoxal phosphate and Lys 258. Treatment of the reduced enzyme with papain followed by acid hydrolysis liberates epsilon-N-[3H]pyridoxyl lysine which is degraded to [3H]pyridoxamine diHCl and stereochemically analyzed with apoaspartate aminotransferase. Sodium boro[3H]hydride treatment of active site carbamylated aspartate aminotransferase reconstituted with pyridoxyl phosphate and sodium aspartate results in the trapping of an enzyme x substrate complex through the reduction of the Schiff's base formed between pyridoxal phosphate and aspartate. Active site bound N-[3H]pyridoxyl aspartate is liberated by treatment with papain and degraded to [3H]pyridoxamine diHCl for stereochemical analysis. Borohydride reduction of the holoenzyme occurs from the re face of the pyridoxal phosphate Lys 258 Schiff's base. Similarly, reduction of active site carbamylated enzyme x substrate complex occurs from the re face of the pyridoxal phosphate-aspartate Schiff's base. These results indicate that when active site carbamylated enzyme binds substrate to pyridoxal phosphate it does so stereospecifically and without changing the face of the Schiff base that is available for reduction as compared to native enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1533220703,"Half-saturation constants have been determined for the choline carrier with cationic substrates and their uncharged carbon analogs: (a) choline and 3,3-dimethyl-1-butanol and (b) 2-dimethylaminoethanol and isoamyl alcohol. The constants are 6.3 microM and 16 mM for the first pair, and 19 microM and 45mM for the second. In both cases, the charged molecules have the higher affinity by a factor of more than 2000. This is to be compared with a factor of less than 10 for charged and neutral substrates of acetylcholinesterase, and with a similar factor in antigen-antibody reactions. To account for the unusually strong ionic bond, a very close association between the carrier site and the substrate is suggested, probably with exclusion of water of hydration. This is supported by the fact that gradual replacement of N-methyl groups in the substrate by N-ethyl groups sharply reduces affinity for the carrier with a 110-fold reduction overall, but has no significant effect on the enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1775544586,"Mitochondrial proline oxidation was studied as a tool to investigate the regulation of the fate of intramitochondrially generated glutamate. Aspartate formation from proline was less than with glutamate as a substrate and was not appreciably stimulated by malate, indicating that the supply of oxalacetate was not limiting. A lag in aspartate synthesis from proline occurred which was relieved by external glutamate due to the involvement of the glutamate-aspartate antiporter. In the absence of added glutamate, the counterion for aspartate transport had to be supplied from internally generated glutamate by way of the glutamate uniporter. Addition of glutamate increased the activity of the glutamate-aspartate translocator, thereby stimulating aspartate formation but, in the absence of malate, it had little effect on proline oxidation or glutamate uniporter flux. A further stimulation of aspartate formation was obtained with added malate; under these conditions, increasing glutamate concentrations caused inhibition of proline oxidation. Ammonia was generated at a higher rate from proline than from added glutamate. This was not due to a difference in the oxidation-reduction state of NAD(P) with these substrates, although ammonia formation from either substrate was stimulated by agents that caused an oxidation of NAD(P). The higher rate of ammonia formation from proline than from added glutamate also appeared not to be due to a limiting capacity of the glutamate translocator. Addition of glutamate inhibited ammonia formation from proline, while it caused an accumulation of intramitochondrial glutamate so that a gradient of glutamate concentration was maintained equal to or in excess of the pH gradient across the mitochondrial membrane, allowing a continued efflux of intramitochondrial glutamate on the glutamate uniporter. The results illustrate the regulatory significance of the glutamate uniporter which maintains a relationship between the gradients of pH and glutamate concentration across the mitochondrial membrane, thereby integrating the"

https://openalex.org/W1523754952,"Des-arg iron-cobalt hybrid hemoglobins, des-arg alpha(Co)2 beta (Fe)2, and des-arg alpha (Fe)2 beta (Co)2, in which the alpha-141 arginine residues are digested by carboxypeptidase B, were prepared, and their functional and EPR spectral properties were examined. The overall oxygen affinities of the alpha and beta subunits in both iron and cobalt hemoglobin tetramers were increased by the removal of this arginine residue and that of the alpha subunits was markedly influenced as compared with the beta subunits. In des-arg hemoglobins, the difference in the oxygen affinities between the alpha and beta subunits was smaller than that in the unmodified hemoglobins. The rate of carbon monoxide binding to the ferrous subunits in deoxy iron-cobalt hybrid hemoglobins were increased by 6- and 10-fold for the alpha (Fe)2 and beta (Fe)2 subunits, respectively, by this modification. The deoxy EPR spectrum of des-arg alpha (Co)2 beta (Fe)2 showed that the stripped deoxy des-arg hemoglobins are predominantly in the oxy quaternary structure. Comparison of the functional and EPR spectral data of des-arg hemoglobins with those of the unmodified hemoglobins indicated that the ligand affinity of the beta subunits is higher than that of the alpha subunits in the low affinity, quaternary structure of deoxyhemoglobin, but that this difference is small in the oxy, high affinity, quaternary structure."
https://openalex.org/W1516679052,"Photooxidation of estradiol receptor form MTW9 rat mammary tumor cytosol leads to a time-dependent loss of DNA-binding activity; this effect is pH-dependent. Binding of receptor to DNA does not protect the DNA-binding site from photooxidation. The estrogen binding site of the receptor is also susceptible to photooxidation, although the rate of loss of estradiol binding capacity is considerably less than that of DNA-binding capacity; this process is independent of pH. Binding of receptor to estradiol substantially protects the estradiol binding site from photooxidation. Sucrose gradient analysis of photooxidized receptor preparations showed no qualitative difference compared with nonirradiated controls. Similarly, the isoelectric focusing pattern of photooxidized receptor showed two peaks of radioactivity at pH approximately 5.6 and 6.3, as did nonirradiated receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1608631521,"The activation of bovine prothrombin is known to be accompanied in purified systems by proteolytic reactions catalyzed by the product, thrombin. These reactions, which are directed principally towards the prothrombin substrate and the Factor V cofactor, are eliminated if the lysine residues of prothrombin are chemically modified beforehand with methyl acetimidate. Amidinated prothrombin in which the usual lysine content has been reduced by 75% is cleaved completely by Factor Xa to give thrombin which has little or no activity towards fibrinogen, the thrombin-sensitive bond in prothrombin, or Factor V, but with normal activity towards the synthetic chromogenic substrate D-Phe-Pipecolyl-L-Arg-p-nitroanilide. The formation of thrombin could therefore be studied spectrophotometrically by discontinuous assays of thrombin without complication by the proteolytic feedback activity of this enzyme. Such assays showed that the rate of appearance and yield of thrombin is the same whether from native or amidinated prothrombin, in spite of the lack of proteolytic activity in the product from the latter. Native and amidinated prothrombin have identical fluorescence emission spectra (lambda ex = 280 nm) which, upon activation, show a broadening and a red shift of the peak of emission from 330 to 336 nm. This change is different from the quenching known to occur when prothrombin binds Ca2+ and is contingent upon cleavage by Factor Xa. When monitored at the 370 nm band, the shift is seen as an increase in fluroescence intensity which, when the concentrations of Factor Xa and Factor V are adjusted appropriately, has the same general appearance as a progress curve obtained by discontinuous assay of thrombin activity. However, the curves obtained with the native zymogen appear to contain a component due to proteolysis by the accumulating product. in the case of amidinated zymogen, this is not longer so: the curves reflect only proteolysis by Factor Xa. In addition, a comparison of the fluorescence shift with the time course of thrombin appearance shows that the shift results mainly from the cleavage of intact prothrombin by Factor Xa, with little or no contribution from later events in the activation pathway. Modified Stern-Volmer plots for the quenching of fluorescence (lambda ex = 295 nm) of the intact amidinated zymogen and its activation products by sodium iodide allow the conclusion that activation results in the exposure to solvent of tryptophan residues that were previously sheltered. However, there is a variation in the pattern of quenching with the protein concentration, suggesting that these residues may be sheltered in the zymogen by intermolecular rather than intramolecular interactions."
