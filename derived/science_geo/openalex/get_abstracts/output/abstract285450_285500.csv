https://openalex.org/W2120746470,"The current excitement among geologists and geophysicists stemming from the ""new global tectonics"" has led to a widespread, speculative reinterpretation of continental geology. The Gulf of California and its continuation into the Imperial Valley provide an excellent opportunity for studying the border zone between the North American and Pacific plates, and an interface of continental and oceanic tectonics. The Salton trough, the landward extension of the gulf, is a broad structural depression, comparable in size with the deeper marine basins of the southern part of the gulf, but here partially filled with sediments deposited by the Colorado River."

https://openalex.org/W2085046651,"An aerial trail of odorous pheromone molecules extends downwind from a female pink bollworm moth that is receptive for mating. Males apparently sense the boundaries of the trail during their characteristic zigzag flights across it. Contrary to previous beliefs, the mechanism by which the males steer toward the odor source does not require a sensing of wind direction."
https://openalex.org/W2053859592,"Many salts of polynuclear carboxylic acids, phenols, amines, and sulfonic acids adsorbed on paper, silica, alumina, and other substrates exhibit strong triplet phosphorescence at room temperature, with no evidence of quenching by oxygen. No phosphorescence has been observed with nonionic materials. The spectra are similar to those of frozen solutions at -196 degrees C, and the technique provides a simple means of demonstrating phosphorescence phenomena, identifying unknown materials, and investigating the spectra of triplet states."

It is trigonal, with a(0) = 5.33 angstroms and c(0) = 12.24 angstroms. It is produced along with chaoite on the surfaces of graphitic carbons under free-vaporization conditions at low pressures, with temperatures above approximately 2550 degrees K."

https://openalex.org/W2070909486,The assumption that the moon had an internal magnetic field produced in the same way as the geomagnetic field requires that the moon rotated faster than the angular velocity at which it would break up. This suggests that a lunar dynamo is not a tenable explanation for the magnetic remanence observed on the moon.

https://openalex.org/W2009482223,"It is obvious that at the present state of our knowledge it would be hopeless to try to find the correct theory of the elementary particles. On the other hand, one may try to form some kind of picture of how such a future theory of elementary particles will look, because, even if we realize that we know only very few details about the elementary particles, we have already quite a good qualitative picture of them, and we feel that even if the experiments go on for 5 or 10 or even more years, this qualitative picture will scarcely change."
