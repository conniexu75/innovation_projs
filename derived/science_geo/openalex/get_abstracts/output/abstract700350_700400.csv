https://openalex.org/W4295882723,"Several in vitro models have been developed to recapitulate mouse embryogenesis solely from embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Despite mimicking many aspects of early development, they fail to capture the interactions between embryonic and extraembryonic tissues. To overcome this difficulty, we have developed a mouse ESC-based in vitro model that reconstitutes the pluripotent ESC lineage and the two extraembryonic lineages of the post-implantation embryo by transcription-factor-mediated induction. This unified model recapitulates developmental events from embryonic day 5.5 to 8.5, including gastrulation; formation of the anterior-posterior axis, brain, and a beating heart structure; and the development of extraembryonic tissues, including yolk sac and chorion. Comparing single-cell RNA sequencing from individual structures with time-matched natural embryos identified remarkably similar transcriptional programs across lineages but also showed when and where the model diverges from the natural program. Our findings demonstrate an extraordinary plasticity of ESCs to self-organize and generate a whole-embryo-like structure."

To evaluate the impact of mutations on 17 antibodies used in 11 commercially available antigen tests with emergency use authorization, we measured antibody binding for all possible Nucleocapsid point mutations using a mammalian surface-display platform and deep mutational scanning. The results provide a complete map of the antibodies' epitopes and their susceptibility to mutational escape. Our data predict no vulnerabilities for detection of mutations found in variants of concern. We confirm this using the commercial tests and sequence-confirmed COVID-19 patient samples. The antibody escape mutational profiles generated here serve as a valuable resource for predicting the performance of rapid antigen tests against past, current, as well as any possible future variants of SARS-CoV-2, establishing the direct clinical and public health utility of our system."
https://openalex.org/W4297731286,"Exosomes can selectively secrete harmful metabolic substances from cells to maintain cellular homeostasis, and complex crosstalk occurs between exosomes and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the glioma immune microenvironment. However, the precise mechanisms by which these exosome-encapsulated cargos create an immunosuppressive microenvironment remain unclear. Herein, we investigated the effect of glioma-derived exosomes (GDEs) on macrophage polarization and glioma progression. We performed sequencing analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and tumor tissues from glioma patients to identify functional microRNAs (miRNAs). High levels of miR-3591-3p were found in CSF and GDEs but not in normal brain tissue or glial cells. Functionally, GDEs and miR-3591-3p significantly induced M2 macrophage polarization and increased the secretion of IL10 and TGFβ1, which in turn promoted glioma invasion and migration. Moreover, miR-3591-3p overexpression in glioma cell lines resulted in G2/M arrest and markedly increased apoptosis. Mechanistically, miR-3591-3p can directly target CBLB and MAPK1 in macrophages and glioma cells, respectively, and further activate the JAK2/PI3K/AKT/mTOR, JAK2/STAT3, and MAPK signaling pathways. In vivo experiments confirmed that macrophages lentivirally transduced with miR-3591-3p can significantly promote glioma progression. Thus, our study demonstrates that tumor-suppressive miR-3591-3p in glioma cells can be secreted via exosomes and target TAMs to induce the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Collectively, these findings provide new insights into the role of glioma exosomal miRNAs in mediating the establishment of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and show that miR-3591-3p may be a valuable biomarker and that blocking the encapsulation of miR-3591-3p into exosomes may become a novel immunotherapeutic strategy for glioma."
https://openalex.org/W4295049068,"Motivation The tumour microenvironment (TME) contains various cells including stromal fibroblasts, immune and malignant cells, and its composition can be elucidated using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). scRNA-seq datasets from several cancer types are available, yet we lack a comprehensive database to collect and present related TME data in an easily accessible format. Results We therefore built a TME scRNA-seq database, and created the R package TMExplorer to facilitate investigation of the TME. TMExplorer provides an interface to easily access all available datasets and their metadata. The users can search for datasets using a thorough range of characteristics. The TMExplorer allows for examination of the TME using scRNA-seq in a way that is streamlined and allows for easy integration into already existing scRNA-seq analysis pipelines."
https://openalex.org/W4295049421,"Background Early resumption of post-partum sexual intercourse has an adverse outcome on the health of women and indirectly unintended pregnancy might happen and affects both the health of women and the delivered baby. There is limited evidence that shows predictors at the individual and community level from the Ethiopian demographic and health survey. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess predictors of early resumption of post-partum sexual intercourse among post-partum period women in Ethiopia: a multilevel analysis based on Ethiopian demographic and health survey 2016. Methods This study used an in-depth secondary data analysis of the survey using the 2016 main EDHS. A total weighted sample of 6447 post-partum women who have children aged 0 to 36 months (about 3 years) was included for the analysis. Multilevel binary logistic regression analysis was conducted considering the hierarchical nature of the EDHS data. Intra-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC), and deviance [-2 Log-Likelihood Ratio (LRR)] were used for model comparison and for assessing model fitness. In a multivariable analysis adjusted OR with a 95% CI (Confidence Interval) was reported with a p-value &lt;0.05 was used to declare a significant association between the explanatory and the outcome variables. Results The proportion of early resumption of post-partum sexual intercourse was found to be 60.41% [95% CI 59.19–61.63]. Women with age group of 25–28 (AOR = 0.8; 95% CI 0.67–0.96), 29–32 (AOR = 0.79; 95% CI 0.63–0.98), and 33–49 (AOR = 0.67; 95% CI 0.53–0.85), women with sex of child female (AOR = 0.82; 95% CI 0.73–0.92), women whose child is alive (AOR = 0.52; 95% CI 0.38–0.69), women who delivered by cesarean section(AOR = 0.34; 95% CI 0.23–0.49), women with primary educational level (AOR = 1.27; 95% CI 1.09–1.48), women with secondary educational level (AOR = 1.61; 95% CI 1.19–2.17) and women with higher educational level (AOR = 1.6; 95% CI 1.05–2.45), Para 3–4 women (AOR = 1.45; 95% CI 1.21–1.73) and women with grand multi parity (AOR = 1.61; 95% CI 1.29–2), women with fertility desire wanted latter (AOR = 0.81; 95% CI 0.69–0.94), women with fertility desire wanted no more (AOR = 0.81; 95% CI 0.66–1.01), women who are on family planning use (AOR = 1.2; 95% CI 1.05–1.38) and participant with currently on working (AOR = 0.79; 95% CI 0.69–0.91) were significantly associated with early resumption of post-partum sexual intercourse. Conclusions The magnitude of early resumption of post-partum sexual intercourse was found to be high. Giving emphasis to the age groups of 25–28, 29–32, and 33–49 women, women with the sex of child female, women who delivered by cesarean section, currently working, the child is live, fertility desire wanted later and no more were suggested to reduce early resumption of post-partum sexual intercourse. On the other hand, improved educational attainments of women, women with parity 3–4, and &gt;5, and family planning use were variables to increase early resumption of post-partum sexual intercourse. Therefore, the health care providers and program managers should act on early resumption of post-partum sexual intercourse through health education and promotion considering the significant factors."
https://openalex.org/W4295049451,"Although several observational studies on the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination have been published, vaccination coverage by August, 3 2021, remained low in the French overseas territories, despite Martinique and Guadeloupe experiencing an unprecedented number of COVID-19-related hospitalizations. We aimed to determine the association between COVID-19 vaccination and severe COVID-19 in the French overseas territories.The French National Health Data System was used to conduct a 1:1 matched-cohort study. For each individual receiving a first dose of BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or Ad26.COV2-S vaccine between December 27, 2020, and July 31, 2021, one unvaccinated individual was randomly selected and matched for year of birth, sex, and overseas territories on the date of vaccination. We estimated vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19-related hospitalization and in-hospital death after a full vaccination schedule, defined as ≥14 days after the second dose. Analyses were stratified according to the number of comorbidities.276,778 vaccinated individuals had a double-dose vaccination during the follow-up period and were followed with their paired unvaccinated control. The average age was 50 years and 53% were women. During a median 77 days of follow-up from day 14 after the second injection, 96 COVID-19-related hospitalizations occurred among vaccinated individuals and 1,465 among their unvaccinated counterparts. Overall, vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization was 94% (95%CI [93-95]) and exceeded 90% in each overseas territory, except Mayotte. The results were similar looking specifically at hospitalizations between July 15 and September 30, 2021. Vaccine effectiveness against in-hospital death was similar (94% [95%CI 91-96]). The risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization increased with the number of comorbidities, especially among vaccinated individuals.In conclusion, vaccination has a major effect in reducing the risk of severe Covid-19 in the French overseas territories. The risk of COVID-19-hospitalization was very low among vaccinated individuals, especially in the absence of comorbidities. These results aim to increase confidence in vaccine effectiveness in overseas territories in hope of achieving better vaccination coverage."
https://openalex.org/W4295047626,"Pathologies such as cancer metastasis and osteoporosis strongly affect the mechanical properties of the vertebral bone and increase the risk of fragility fractures. The prediction of the fracture risk with a patient-specific model, directly generated from the diagnostic images of the patient, could help the clinician in the choice of the correct therapy to follow. But before such models can be used to support any clinical decision, their credibility must be demonstrated through verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification. In this study we describe a procedure for the generation of such patient-specific finite element models and present a first validation of the kinematics of the spine segment. Quantitative computed tomography images of a cadaveric lumbar spine segment presenting vertebral metastatic lesions were used to generate the model. The applied boundary conditions replicated a specific experimental test where the spine segment was loaded in compression-flexion. Model predictions in terms of vertebral surface displacements were compared against the full-field experimental displacements measured with Digital Image Correlation. A good agreement was obtained from the local comparison between experimental data and simulation results (R2 > 0.9 and RMSE% <8%). In conclusion, this work demonstrates the possibility to apply the developed modelling pipeline to predict the displacement field of human spine segment under physiological loading conditions, which is a first fundamental step in the credibility assessment of these clinical decision-support technology."
https://openalex.org/W4295505560,"Introduction Substance use amongst adolescents remains a global public health challenge. The potential negative health outcomes of substance use suggest the need to understand the pattern of use and the associated factors among adolescents. This study aimed to describe the prevalence of substance use, SUDs, and PD and the associated factors in adolescent learners at public schools in Gaborone, Botswana. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at 13 public secondary schools in Gaborone among 742 students. Assessment tools included the World Health Organization drug questionnaire, DSM-5 interview for SUD, and the General Health Questionnaire-12. Results The mean age (SD) of the participants was 15.26 (1.57) years, and there were more females (55.5%). Over two-fifths (44.6%) of learners reported psychoactive substance use in the past 12 months, and 31.5% meeting DSM 5 criteria for a SUD. Alcohol was the most used psychoactive substance (25.1%). Male gender (AOR = 1.94; 95% CI: 1.26–2.995), having a friend (AOR = 4.27; 95% CI: 2.68–6.78), or father (AOR = 1.87; 95% CI: 1.14–3.04), who uses substance, and higher levels of PD (AOR = 1.09; 95% CI: 1.03–1.17) remained significantly associated with SUD. Regular participation in religious activities negatively correlated with SUD (AOR = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.38–0.96). Conclusion The high prevalence of substance use and SUDs among in-school adolescents is concerning. Substance use programs need to include family-focused and religious-based therapy and youth empowerment in developing positive peer relationships. Also, they should be integrated with mental health screening to assess comorbid PD."

https://openalex.org/W4295517916,"Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by a novel coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected more than 18 million people worldwide. The activation of endothelial cells is a hallmark of signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection that includes altered integrity of vessel barrier and endothelial inflammation. Objectives Pulmonary endothelial activation is suggested to be related to the profound neutrophil elastase (NE) activity, which is necessary for sterilization of phagocytosed bacterial pathogens. However, unopposed activity of NE increases alveolocapillary permeability and extracellular matrix degradation. The uncontrolled protease activity of NE during the inflammatory phase of lung diseases might be due to the resistance of exosome associated NE to inhibition by alpha-1 antitrypsin. Method 31 subjects with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 infection were recruited in the disease group and samples from 30 voluntaries matched for age and sex were also collected for control. Results We measured the plasma levels of exosome-associated NE in SARS-CoV-2 patients which, were positively correlated with sign of endothelial damage in those patients as determined by plasma levels of LDH. Notably, we also found strong correlation with plasma levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin and exosome-associated NE in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Using macrovascular endothelial cells, we also observed that purified NE activity is inhibited by purified alpha-1 antitrypsin while, NE associated with exosomes are resistant to inhibition and show less sensitivity to alpha-1 antitrypsin inhibitory activity, in vitro. Conclusions Our results point out the role of exosome-associated NE in exacerbation of endothelial injury in SARS-CoV-2 infection. We have demonstrated that exosome-associated NE could be served as a new potential therapeutic target of severe systemic manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection."

Here, we studied whether the commissural projections connecting the medial entorhinal cortices contribute to spatial coding, object coding, and memory. We demonstrate that input from the contralateral medial entorhinal cortex targets all major cell types in the superficial medial entorhinal cortex, modulating their firing rate. Notably, a fraction of responsive cells displayed object tuning and exhibited a reduction in their firing rate upon the inhibition of commissural input. In line with this finding are behavioral results that revealed the contribution of commissural input to episodic-like memory retrieval.

https://openalex.org/W4295047679,"Importance Distinguishing benign from malignant pulmonary nodules is challenging. Evidence-based guidelines exist, but their impact on patient-centered outcomes is unknown. Objective To understand if the evaluation of incidental pulmonary nodules that follows an evidence-based management strategy is associated with fewer invasive procedures for benign lesions and/or fewer delays in cancer diagnosis. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Large academic medical center. Participants Adults (≥18 years age) with an incidental pulmonary nodule discovered between January 2012 and December 2014. Patients with calcified nodules, prior nodules, prior diagnosis of cancer, high suspicion for pulmonary metastasis, or limited life expectancy were excluded. Exposure Nodule management strategy (pre-specified based on evidence-based practices). Outcome Composite of any invasive procedure for a benign nodule or delay in diagnosis in patients with cancer (&gt;3 month delay once probability of cancer was &gt;15%). Results Of 314 patients that met inclusion criteria, median age was 61, 46.5% were men, and 66.5% had current or former tobacco use. The mean nodule size was 10.3 mm, mean probability of cancer was 11.8%, and 14.3% of nodules were malignant. Evaluation followed an evidence-based strategy in 245 patients (78.0%), and deviated in 69 patients (22%). The composite outcome occurred in 26 (8.3%) patients. Among patients whose nodule evaluation was concordant with an evidence-based evaluation, 6.1% (15/245) experienced the composite outcome versus 15.9% (11/69) of patients with an evaluation that deviated from evidence-based recommendations ( P &lt;0.01). Conclusions and relevance At a large academic medical center, more than 1 in 5 patients with an incidental pulmonary nodule underwent evaluation that deviated from evidence-based practice recommendations. Nodule evaluation that deviated from an evidence-based strategy was associated with biopsy of benign lesions and delays in cancer diagnosis, suggesting a need to improve guideline uptake."
https://openalex.org/W4295049412,"Two-dimensional (2D) Shear Wave Elastography (SWE) is an easy to perform technique to evaluate the liver stiffness. To simplify the procedure and reduce the acquisition time we enlarged the size of the SWE-box and set ten regions of interest (ROI) in one acquisition. We compare the accuracy of this method to ten separate acquisitions in a small box each with a single ROI measurement. Sixty-nine volunteers with diffuse chronic liver disease were studied with 2D-SWE using a Canon Aplio i800 ultrasound system. The shear-wave-speed was measured in the right lobe in ten separate acquisitions and compared to one acquisition with increased size of the SWE-box and ten different ROI measurements. A Bland-Altmann plot was drawn and the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated to compare both methods. Finally, 2D-SWE was successfully performed thru both methods in sixty-six participants. Between both methods the ICC is 0.82. The results of this study show a good reliability between ten separate measures and one grouped measure with ten ROI if the mean is below 1.6m/s (7.7kPa). For higher degrees of fibrosis (≥F2) further investigations are needed."
https://openalex.org/W4295049419,"Background Differences in the prevalence of general and abdominal obesity by subgroups such as age, sex, and education have been reported worldwide. Most studies in Taiwan regarding obesity prevalence were targeted at school-aged children or without further stratification by subgroups. Our aim was to examine the age-specific secular trend of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and obesity prevalence stratified by sex, education and urbanization levels in Taiwanese adults. Methods We used three waves of nationally representative population from the Nutrition and Health Survey in Taiwan (NAHSIT) 1993–1996 (n = 2 989), 2005–2008 (n = 2 495), and 2013–2016 (n = 2 880). The data included standardized measurement of body weight, height, and WC. We conducted a serial cross-sectional analysis among adults aged 20 years or above to examine the age-specific trends of BMI, WC, and the prevalence of underweight, overweight, general obesity, and abdominal obesity with stratification by sex, education, and urbanization levels. Results The general obesity prevalence was 16%, 21%, and 20% and the abdominal obesity prevalence was 27%, 42%, and 47% in the 1993–1996, 2005–2008, and 2013–2016 surveys, respectively. The age-specific secular trend of BMI differed across subgroups; however, the trend of WC increased rapidly regardless of subgroups, except for women aged ≥60 years. The general obesity prevalence increased noticeably among men, younger- and middle-age adults with high school or higher education, middle- and older-age adults with lower than high school education, people &lt;39 and ≥50 years of age residing in rural areas, and among those between 30 and 59 and ≥70 years of age residing in urban areas. Conclusions Although the increasing trend of general obesity prevalence was levelling off among several subgroups, the abdominal obesity prevalence increased significantly and rapidly in Taiwan. Future research in developing effective weight and WC control interventions tailored to different subgroups is urgently needed."
https://openalex.org/W4295049460,"The aim of this study was to determine the rate, important findings, and risk factors related to discrepancies between on-call residents' and attending radiologists' interpretations of abdominal examinations. We identified 1132 eligible patients with abdominal radiology findings that were preliminary interpreted by on-call residents between February 2016 and September 2019. The preliminary interpretations were compared with the final interpretations by abdominal attending radiologists, including clinical data. The preliminary interpretations were analyzed by three radiologists in consensus, who categorized the reports according to organs, important findings (i.e., active bleeding, bowel obstruction, organ ischemia or infarction, and organ rupture), clinical outcomes, and discrepancies with respect to final interpretations. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the risk factors for important discrepant findings. Of 1132 patients, the bowel (n = 567, 50.1%) was the most common organ interpreted by on-call residents, followed by gallbladder/bile duct/pancreas (n = 139, 12.3%) and liver (n = 116, 10.2%). Of 1132, 359 patients (31.7%) had disease with 379 important findings: active bleeding (n = 222), organ rupture (n = 77), bowel obstruction (n = 52), bowel ischemia (n = 24), and organ infarction (n = 4). Sixty-four patients (5.6%) showed discrepancies, and 30 (2.6%) showed 32 important discrepant findings comprising 14 active bleeding, 10 bowel obstructions, 6 organ ruptures, and 2 cases of bowel ischemia. Of the 64 discrepant patients, 33 underwent delayed surgery (n = 18, 28.1%) or interventional treatment (n = 15, 23.4%). In multivariable analysis, bowel obstruction (adjusted odds ratio, 2.52; p = 0.049) was an independent risk factor for determining discrepancy between preliminary and final interpretations. The rate of overall and important discrepancies between on-call residents' and final interpretations was low. However, given that the bowel was the most frequently interpreted organ, bowel obstruction was identified as a risk factor for discrepant interpretations. The identified risk factor and findings may be useful for residents to minimize discrepancies."
https://openalex.org/W4295049525,"Introduction/Purpose Previous injury has consistently been shown to be one of the greatest risk factors for running-related injuries (RRIs). Runners returning to participation following injury may still demonstrate injury-related mechanics (e.g. repetitive high impact loading), potentially exposing them to further injuries. The aim of this study was to determine if the magnitude (Peak accel ) and rate of loading (Rate accel ) at the tibia and sacrum differ between runners who have never been injured, those who have acquired injury resistance (runners who have not been injured in the past 2 years) and those who have been recently injured (RRI sustained 3–12 months ago). Methods Runners completed an online survey capturing details of their RRI history over the previous 2 years. Never injured runners were matched by sex, quarterly annual mileage and typical training speed to runners who had acquired injury resistance and to runners who had been recently injured. Differences in Peak accel and Rate accel of the tibia and sacrum were assessed between the three groups during a treadmill run at a set speed, with consideration for sex. Results A total of 147 runners made up the three injury status groups (n: 49 per group). There was a significant main effect of injury status for Peak accel and Rate accel at the sacrum, with recently injured runners demonstrating significantly greater Rate accel than never injured and acquired injury resistant runners. There was also a significant main effect for sex, with females demonstrating greater tibial Peak accel , sacrum Peak accel and Rate accel than males. Conclusion Rate accel at the sacrum distinguishes recently injured runners from never injured runners and runners who may have acquired injury resistance, potentially highlighting poor impact acceleration attenuation in recently injured runners."

https://openalex.org/W4295512571,"Aim To develop an accurate lab score based on in-hospital patients’ potent clinical and biological parameters for predicting COVID-19 patient severity during hospital admission. Methods To conduct this retrospective analysis, a derivation cohort was constructed by including all the available biological and clinical parameters of 355 COVID positive patients (recovered = 285, deceased = 70), collected in November 2020-September 2021. For identifying potent biomarkers and clinical parameters to determine hospital admitted patient severity or mortality, the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and Fischer’s test analysis was performed. Relative risk regression was estimated to develop laboratory scores for each clinical and routine biological parameter. Lab score was further validated by ROC curve analysis of the validation cohort which was built with 50 COVID positive hospital patients, admitted during October 2021-January 2022. Results Sensitivity vs. 1-specificity ROC curve (&gt;0.7 Area Under the Curve, 95% CI) and univariate analysis (p&lt;0.0001) of the derivation cohort identified five routine biomarkers (neutrophil, lymphocytes, neutrophil: lymphocytes, WBC count, ferritin) and three clinical parameters (patient age, pre-existing comorbidities, admitted with pneumonia) for the novel lab score development. Depending on the relative risk (p values and 95% CI) these clinical parameters were scored and attributed to both the derivation cohort (n = 355) and the validation cohort (n = 50). ROC curve analysis estimated the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the derivation and validation cohort which was 0.914 (0.883–0.945, 95% CI) and 0.873 (0.778–0.969, 95% CI) respectively. Conclusion The development of proper lab scores, based on patients’ clinical parameters and routine biomarkers, would help physicians to predict patient risk at the time of their hospital admission and may improve hospital-admitted COVID-19 patients’ survivability."
https://openalex.org/W4295047569,"A common issue affecting DNA methylation analysis in tumor tissue is the presence of a substantial amount of non-tumor methylation signal derived from the surrounding microenvironment. Although approaches for quantifying and correcting for the infiltration component have been proposed previously, we believe these have not fully addressed the issue in a comprehensive and universally applicable way. We present a multi-population framework for adjusting DNA methylation beta values on the Illumina 450/850K platform using generic purity estimates to account for non-tumor signal. Our approach also provides an indirect estimate of the aggregate methylation state of the surrounding normal tissue. Using whole exome sequencing derived purity estimates and Illumina 450K methylation array data generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas project (TCGA), we provide a demonstration of this framework in breast cancer illustrating the effect of beta correction on the aggregate methylation beta value distribution, clustering accuracy, and global methylation profiles."
https://openalex.org/W4295047638,"Accurate estimates of natural and/or vaccine-induced antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are difficult to obtain. Although model-based estimates of seroprevalence have been proposed, they require inputting unknown parameters including viral reproduction number, longevity of immune response, and other dynamic factors. In contrast to a model-based approach, the current study presents a data-driven detailed statistical procedure for estimating total seroprevalence (defined as antibodies from natural infection or from full vaccination) in a region using prospectively collected serological data and state-level vaccination data. Specifically, we conducted a longitudinal statewide serological survey with 88,605 participants 5 years or older with 3 prospective blood draws beginning September 30, 2020. Along with state vaccination data, as of October 31, 2021, the estimated percentage of those 5 years or older with naturally occurring antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in Texas is 35.0% (95% CI = (33.1%, 36.9%)). This is 3× higher than, state-confirmed COVID-19 cases (11.83%) for all ages. The percentage with naturally occurring or vaccine-induced antibodies (total seroprevalence) is 77.42%. This methodology is integral to pandemic preparedness as accurate estimates of seroprevalence can inform policy-making decisions relevant to SARS-CoV-2."
https://openalex.org/W4295047678,"Most Australian state and territory governments have healthy food provisioning policies targeting availability of unhealthy food at the retail level, and sustainability policies promoting a life-cycle approach to procurement. However, it remains unclear if health and sustainability are important considerations in awarding contracts, and whether these high-level policies are implemented into supplier contracts. A political economy analysis framework has been developed to prospectively identify and explain barriers and enablers to policy implementation. Using food procurement in Queensland and South Australia as case studies, the political economy analysis seeks to understand the structural and contextual factors, bargaining processes, stakeholders, and incentives and ideas surrounding food procurement. It involves a desktop and content analysis of existing policies and food contracts, and key informant interviews with government and industry stakeholders. Participants will be targeted across different departments (e.g. health, environment, treasury) and in varying roles from policy design, contract management and food service, and industry suppliers in different food and drink categories (e.g. meat, packaged foods, beverages, fruit &amp; vegetables). Participants will be recruited using purposive sampling. Thematic analysis of interview transcripts will be undertaken, informed by the political economy analysis framework. The study will identify current food procurement policy implementation barriers and enablers, including why high-level policies aren’t embedded into contracts, mechanisms for achieving policy coherence and future opportunities for addressing barriers and incorporating socio-economic, public health and environmental considerations into purchasing practices. Ultimately, the study will achieve impact by informing a whole of government approach to health and the environment by elevating the priority of health and sustainability in procurement (short term), increasing the availability of healthy and sustainable foods (medium term), and improving health and environmental outcomes (long term). To our knowledge this is the first political economy analysis of food procurement in Australia."
https://openalex.org/W4295047705,"Dislocation is one of the most common complications after primary total hip arthroplasty (THA). Several patient-related risk factors for dislocation have been reported in the previous literature, but only few prediction models for dislocation have been made. Our aim was to build a prediction model for an early (within the first 2 years) revision for dislocation after primary THA using two different statistical methods. The study data constituted of 37 pre- or perioperative variables and postoperative follow-up data of 16 454 primary THAs performed at our institution in 2008–2021. Model I was a traditional logistic regression model and Model II was based on the elastic net method that utilizes machine learning. The models’ overall performance was measured using the pseudo R 2 values. The discrimination of the models was measured using C-index in Model I and Area Under the Curve (AUC) in Model II. Calibration curves were made for both models. At 2 years postoperatively, 95 hips (0.6% prevalence) had been revised for dislocation. The pseudo R 2 values were 0.04 in Model I and 0.02 in Model II indicating low predictive capability in both models. The C-index in Model I was 0.67 and the AUC in Model II was 0.73 indicating modest discrimination. The prediction of an early revision for dislocation after primary THA is difficult even in a large cohort of patients with detailed data available because of the reasonably low prevalence and multifactorial nature of dislocation. Therefore, the risk of dislocation should be kept in mind in every primary THA, whether the patient has predisposing factors for dislocation or not. Further, when conducting a prediction model, sophisticated methods that utilize machine learning may not necessarily offer significant advantage over traditional statistical methods in clinical setup."
https://openalex.org/W4295048802,"Since 2011, remote Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities have experienced an outbreak of infectious syphilis, with young people aged 15-29 years over-represented in notifications. The Young Deadly Syphilis Free multi-media campaign was implemented in 12 remote regions in four Australian jurisdictions over nine months from 2017-2018. Campaign components included television and radio advertisements, social media posts, and health promotion resources available via a dedicated website. The aim of this research was to evaluate the impacts (proximal, mediator, distal) of the Young Deadly Syphilis Free campaign for young Aboriginal people and health and community workers residing in remote campaign regions.A cross-sectional (post-only) evaluation design was used. Data were collected through online surveys; metrics for social media (Facebook, Instagram) were also collected to determine campaign engagement via social media. A 22-item young people survey assessed campaign awareness, exposure, message recognition and diagnostics (proximal variables); along with intended behaviour and knowledge and attitudes (mediator variables). A 24-item health and community worker survey assessed campaign awareness, exposure, message recognition and diagnostics (proximal variables); and changes in professional practice (distal variable). Descriptive statistics summarised demographic characteristics and univariate analysis examined associations between key variables.Just over half (n = 25, 58%) of young people and three quarters (n = 36; 75%) of health and community workers were aware of the campaign. Recognition of key campaign messages was high for both participant groups (>64%), and television, Facebook, and website were the most common campaign exposure routes. Positive impacts on intended behaviour (young people) and professional practice (health and community workers) were also reported. Facebook was effective in engaging some young people in campaign content and was preferred by young people for accessing information.The findings point to the value of utilising a multi-media campaign in raising awareness about syphilis among young Aboriginal people and health and community workers in remote Australian regions. A longer-term campaign that accommodates the diverse needs of Aboriginal young people from geographically remote communities would optimise campaign impacts and support behavioural change."
https://openalex.org/W4295048935,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is an extremely contagious disease that causes great damage to the U.S. pork industry. PRRS is not subject to official control in the U.S., but most producers adopt control strategies, including vaccination. However, the PRRS virus mutates frequently, facilitating its ability to infect even vaccinated animals. In this paper we analyze how increased vaccination on sow farms reduces PRRS losses and when vaccination is profitable. We develop a SIR model to simulate the spread of an outbreak between and within swine farms located in a region of Minnesota. Then, we estimate economic losses due to PRRS and calculate the benefits of vaccination. We find that increased vaccination of sow farms increases the private profitability of vaccination, and also transmits positive externalities to farms that do not vaccinate. Although vaccination reduces industry losses, a low to moderate vaccine efficacy implies that large PRRS losses remain, even on vaccinated farms. Our approach provides useful insight into the dynamics of an endemic animal disease and the benefits of different vaccination regimens."
https://openalex.org/W4295049021,"Background Play is an important childhood occupation and a medium for development. Parents’ attitudes towards play, knowledge about play and its benefits, and their experiences in facilitating effective play are key factors that determine the experiences of play in children. These factors related to parent’s understanding and experiences of play gain additional significance when the child has a disability. The aim of this systematic review is to synthesize the available evidence on awareness, knowledge, and experience of play among parents and to summarise the findings. Method MEDLINE, CINAHL, APA PsycINFO, Psychology Database, Sociological Abstracts, EMBASE, and Cochrane Collection Plus will be searched for studies of any design that investigate awareness, knowledge, and experience of play among parents and its benefits to child development. Manual searches from reference lists of relevant papers will also be completed. The primary outcomes are parents’ knowledge (what constitutes play), experiences (what parents feel about play) and awareness (benefits of play) about play. Three independent reviewers will screen identified papers with pre-defined eligibility criteria and extract data using a customized extraction form. Discrepancies will be resolved in discussion with a fourth reviewer. A synthesis of eligible studies and summary will be provided. Discussion A systematic review of quantitative and qualitative research evidence of parents’ awareness, knowledge, and experiences in play will be carried out. This will highlight parents’ own views on play among their children, current theories/domains related to parents’ awareness, knowledge, and experience in play, and outcome measures that have been used. In addition, comparison among views of parents of children with disabilities and parents of typically developing children will be made. The results will be presented as a summary of key findings under the themes of awareness, knowledge, and experience of parents in play."
https://openalex.org/W4295049025,"Eutrophic conditions in estuaries are a globally important stressor to coastal ecosystems and have been suggested as a driver of coastal salt marsh loss. Potential mechanisms in marshes include disturbance caused by macroalgae accumulations, enhanced soil sulfide levels linked to high labile carbon inputs, accelerated decomposition, and declines in belowground biomass that contribute to edge instability, erosion, and slumping. However, results of fertilization studies have been mixed, and it is unclear the extent to which local environmental conditions, such as soil composition and nutrient profiles, help shape the response of salt marshes to nutrient exposure. In this study, we characterized belowground productivity and decomposition, organic matter mineralization rates, soil respiration, microbial biomass, soil humification, carbon and nitrogen inventories, nitrogen isotope ratios, and porewater profiles at high and low marsh elevations across eight marshes in four estuaries in California and New York that have strong contrasts in nutrient inputs. The higher nutrient load marshes were characterized by faster carbon turnover, with higher belowground production and decomposition and greater carbon dioxide efflux than lower nutrient load marshes. These patterns were robust across marshes of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts that varied in plant species composition, soil flooding patterns, and soil texture. Although impacts of eutrophic conditions on carbon cycling appeared clear, it was ambiguous whether high nutrient loads are causing negative effects on long-term marsh sustainability in terms of studied metrics. While high nutrient exposure marshes had high rates of decomposition and soil respiration rates, high nutrient exposure was also associated with increased belowground production, and reduced levels of sulfides, which should lead to greater marsh sustainability. While this study does not resolve the extent to which nutrient loads are negatively affecting these salt marshes, we do highlight functional differences between Atlantic and Pacific wetlands which may be useful for understanding coastal marsh health and integrity."
https://openalex.org/W4295049416,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a key determinant of morbidity and mortality in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Identifying factors associated with early glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline in T1D is important in prevention or early intervention for DKD. This study investigated whether phosphate metabolism, including fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is associated with the kidney function of patients with T1D. We randomly recruited 118 patients with T1D with a normal or mildly impaired kidney function [chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages of G1/G2, A1/A2], and measured their serum FGF23 levels. Serum FGF23 was significantly negatively associated with the estimated GFR (eGFR) (r = -0.292, P = 0.0016), but not urinary albumin creatinine ratio (UACR), and positively associated with serum phosphate (Pi; r = 0.273, P = 0.0027). Serum FGF23 increased with decreasing eGFR quartiles (P for linear trend = 0.0371), while FGF23 was modestly higher in the higher quartiles of UACR (not statistically significant). The multiple linear regression analysis also showed a significant inverse association between FGF23 and eGFR (Model 1: β = -0.149, P = 0.0429; Model 2: β = -0.141, P = 0.0370). The association remained significant after adjustment for Pi. We identified that FGF23 was inversely associated with the eGFR in T1D patients with a normal or mildly impaired kidney function."

Preclinical studies indicated biperiden, an anticholinergic drug, as a potential drug to modify the epileptogenic process. The main objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of biperiden as an antiepileptogenic agent in patients that suffered TBI.This prospective multicenter (n = 10) interventional study will include 312 adult patients admitted to emergency care units with a diagnosis of moderate or severe TBI. Following inclusion and exclusion criteria, patients will be randomized, using block randomization, to receive double-blind treatment with placebo or biperiden for 10 days. Follow-up will occur at specific time windows up to 2 years. Main outcomes are incidence of PTE after TBI and occurrence of severe adverse events. Other outcomes include exploratory investigation of factors that might have benefits for the treatment or might influence its results, such as genetic background, clinical progression, electroencephalographic abnormalities, health-related quality of life and neuropsychological status. Analyses will be conducted following the safety, intention-to-treat and efficacy concepts.We hypothesize that biperiden treatment will be effective to prevent or mitigate the development of post-traumatic epilepsy in TBI patients. Other health measures from this population also may benefit from treatment with biperiden.ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04945213. Registered on June 30, 2021."
https://openalex.org/W4295049486,"Non-adherence to antihypertensive medications is a major cause of uncontrolled hypertension, leading to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Ensuring consistent medication possession is crucial in addressing non-adherence. Community-based medication delivery is a strategy that may improve medication possession, adherence, and blood pressure (BP) reduction. Our program in Kenya piloted a community medication delivery program, coupled with blood pressure monitoring and adherence evaluation. Between September 2019 and March 2020, patients who received hypertension care from our chronic disease management program also received community-based delivery of antihypertensive medications. We calculated number of days during which each patient had possession of medications and analyzed the relationship between successful medication delivery and self-reported medication adherence and BP. A total of 128 patient records (80.5% female) were reviewed. At baseline, mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 155.7 mmHg and mean self-reported adherence score was 2.7. Sixty-eight (53.1%) patients received at least 1 successful medication delivery. Our pharmacy dispensing records demonstrated that medication possession was greater among patients receiving medication deliveries. Change in self-reported medication adherence from baseline worsened in patients who did not receive any medication delivery (+0.5), but improved in patients receiving 1 delivery (-0.3) and 2 or more deliveries (-0.8). There was an SBP reduction of 1.9, 6.1, and 15.5 mmHg among patients who did not receive any deliveries, those who received 1 delivery, and those who received 2 or more medication deliveries, respectively. Adjusted mixed-effect model estimates revealed that mean SBP reduction and self-reported medication adherence were improved among individuals who successfully received medication deliveries, compared to those who did not. A community medication delivery program in western Kenya was shown to be implementable and enhanced medication possession, reduced SBP, and significantly improved self-reported adherence. This is a promising strategy to improve health outcomes for patients with uncontrolled hypertension that warrants further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W4295049509,"Graduate students' mental health and well-being is a prominent concern across various disciplines. However, early predictors of mental health and well-being in graduate education, specifically doctoral education, have rarely been studied. The present study evaluated both the underlying latent classification of individuals' mental well-being and predictors of those classifications. Results estimated two latent classes of students' mental health and well-being: one class with generally high levels of mental well-being and one with lower levels of mental well-being. Regression analyses showed that mentoring in the second year of doctoral study, certainty of choice in the third year, and both academic development and sense of belonging in the fourth year were positive predictors of membership in the higher mental well-being class. In contrast to some prior studies, demographic variables were not related to the identified well-being classifications. Regression analyses further showed that mental well-being was negatively related to participants' number of publications and research self-efficacy, indicating a problematic relationship between scholarly productivity and confidence and well-being. These findings may be used to identify and provide targeted support for students who are at-risk for having or developing lower levels of mental well-being in their graduate programs."
https://openalex.org/W4295049516,"The preocular tear film is critically important for maintaining healthy ocular surface. In lagophthalmos, increased evaporation and tear film instability can occur. The level of tear matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) is considered as a possible marker of ocular surface damage and inflammation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible usefulness of measuring tear film levels of MMP-9 in patients with lagophthalmos. Sixteen adult patients with unilateral lagophthalmos due to cerebellopontine angle mass surgery were included. Basic clinical examination including tear film osmolarity, degree of lagophthalmos, ocular surface sensitivity testing, corneal fluorescein staining, and tear break-up time (TBUT) were performed. Furthermore, tear MMP-9 quantification was performed and the values from lagophthalmic and contralateral healthy eye were compared. Possible correlations between tear MMP-9 levels and other parameters were analyzed. The Oxford score was higher in lagophthalmic eyes in comparison to healthy eyes. TBUT and corneal sensitivity were lower in lagophthalmic eyes. There was no difference in osmolarity between the two groups. Tear MMP-9 values were higher in lagophthalmic eyes. A higher MMP-9 value was associated with an increase in ocular surface fluorescein staining and a decrease of TBUT in lagophthalmic eyes. Tear MMP-9 may be used for monitoring ocular surface damage, contribute to early detection of inflammation progression and facilitate treatment adjustments."
https://openalex.org/W4295298594,"Analysis of language geography is increasingly being used for studying spatial patterns of social dynamics. This trend is fueled by social media platforms such as Twitter which provide access to large amounts of natural language data combined with geolocation and user metadata enabling reconstruction of detailed spatial patterns of language use. Most studies are performed on large spatial scales associated with countries and regions, where language dynamics are often dominated by the effects of geographic and administrative borders. Extending to smaller, urban scales, however, allows visualization of spatial patterns of language use determined by social dynamics within the city, providing valuable information for a range of social topics from demographic studies to urban planning. So far, few studies have been made in this domain, due, in part, to the challenges in developing algorithms that accurately classify linguistic features. Here we extend urban-scale geographical analysis of language use beyond lexical meaning to include other sociolinguistic markers that identify language style, dialect and social groups. Some features, which have not been explored with social-media data on the urban scale, can be used to target a range of social phenomena. Our study focuses on Twitter use in Buenos Aires and our approach classifies tweets based on contrasting sets of tokens manually selected to target precise linguistic features. We perform statistical analyses of eleven categories of language use to quantify the presence of spatial patterns and the extent to which they are socially driven. We then perform the first comparative analysis assessing how the patterns and strength of social drivers vary with category. Finally, we derive plausible explanations for the patterns by comparing them with independently generated maps of geosocial context. Identifying these connections is a key aspect of the social-dynamics analysis which has so far received insufficient attention."

We aimed to describe the need and access to care for people with CVDRF and the preparedness of the health system to treat these in Bo, Sierra Leone.Data from a 2018 household survey conducted in Bo, Sierra Leone, was analysed. Demographic, anthropometric and clinical data on CVDRF (hypertension, diabetes mellitus or dyslipidaemia) from randomly sampled individuals 40 years of age and above were collected. Future risk of CVD was calculated using the World Health Organisation-International Society of Hypertension (WHO-ISH) calculator with high risk defined as >20% risk over 10 years. Requirement for treatment was based on WHO package of essential non-communicable (PEN) disease guidelines (which use a risk-based approach) or requiring treatment for individual CVDRF; whether participants were on treatment was used to determine whether care needs were met. Multivariable regression was used to test associations between individual characteristics and outcomes. Data from the most recent WHO Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) were used to create a score reflecting health system preparedness to treat CVDRF, and compared to that for HIV.2071 individual participants were included. Most participants (n = 1715 [94.0%]) had low CVD risk; 423 (20.6%) and 431 (52.3%) required treatment based upon WHO PEN guidelines or individual CVDRF, respectively. Sixty-eight (15.8%) had met-need for treatment determined by WHO guidelines, whilst 84 (19.3%) for individual CVDRF. Living in urban areas, having education, being older, single/widowed/divorced, or wealthy were independently associated with met need. Overall facility readiness scores for CVD/CVDRF care for all facilities in Bo district was 16.8%, compared to 41% for HIV.The number of people who require treatment for CVDRF in Sierra Leone is substantially lower based on WHO guidelines compared to CVDRF. CVDRF care needs are not met equitably, and facility readiness to provide care is low."
https://openalex.org/W4295495538,"The career stage between PhD and lectureship, conventionally called “postdoctoral”, has traditionally been seen as transitional. However, with an estimated one third of university researchers in the United Kingdom having been employed on temporary contracts for more than 10 years, the transitional nature of this career stage is questionable. Despite so many research staff being in long-term employment on short-term contracts, the lack of visibility of this population, which does not have a legitimate place within the current academic career structure, means that we do not know how deliberate or accidental their career choices are. Based on semi-structured interviews with long-term researchers (LTRS) at one university in the United Kingdom, this is the first study to investigate the personal and professional circumstances behind the career path of long-term researchers on temporary contracts. Three categories of LTRS were identified: 1) the candidate, who wants to follow the traditional academic career pathway and to secure a lectureship 2) the accidental long-term researcher, who did not or could not plan their career path 3) the career researcher, who sustains a research-only career despite the precarity of such positions. Most participants had belonged successively to two categories. Some obstacles to career progression transcended the categories: inequal access to opportunities for developing one’s teaching portfolio, poor or lack of managerial support, the perceived prestige or lack thereof of one’s field, and bullying and discrimination. We argue that short-termism and lack of visibility play down considerably the contribution of long-term researchers to the financial and academic success of research institutions. We also argue that traditional–but still in place–structures in academia are ill adapted to the contemporary demographics and practices of the research community; we recommend that future studies involve HE sector stakeholders to review and to reform the academic career structure."
https://openalex.org/W4295048883,"Although gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are rare disease and rectal GISTs is only 5% of total GISTs, they have the worst prognosis. Due to narrow pelvis, tumor rupture or positive resection margin are common in the management of rectal GISTs. The impact of neoadjuvant treatment on the clinical outcomes of rectal gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) remains unclear. Thus, we conducted a retrospective study to investigate the impact of neoadjuvant imatinib on rectal GIST. The cohort comprised 33 patients; of them, 10 and 23 belonged to the neoadjuvant (i.e., those who underwent neoadjuvant imatinib treatment) and the control group (i.e., those who underwent surgery without prior imatinib treatment), respectively. Neoadjuvant group was associated with more common levator ani muscle displacement (P = 0.002), and showed significantly larger radiologic tumor size (P = 0.036) than the control group. The mean tumor size was significantly decreased after imatinib treatment (6.8 cm to 4.7cm, P = 0.006). There was no significant difference in resection margin involvement (P >0.999), and sphincter preservation rates (P = 0.627) between the two groups. No difference was observed with respect to morbidities, hospital stay, local recurrence and disease-free survival. Neoadjuvant imatinib treated group had similar propensity with control group after treatment. We thought reduced tumor sized could enhance resectability and provide more chance to preserve sphincter for rectal GIST patients. Considering large tumor size and higher rate of sphincter invasion in the neoadjuvant group, imatinib treatment could be helpful as a conversion strategy to make huge and low-lying rectal GIST operable and achieve better surgical outcomes."

In Uganda, one in every four TB patients does not adhere to their TB medication. The purpose of this study was to design, develop and assess implementation of a voice-text-based mobile application to support TB patients’ adherence to medication. Methods Design science research methodology (DSRM) was utilized to develop a voice-text-based mobile health application. Agile software methodology was used to achieve steps of DSRM that are; design and development. Focus group discussions (FGDs) and Key informant interviews (KIIs) were conducted and data analysed using thematic content analysis. Results During problem identification, Stigma, transport costs, being asymptomatic, drug side effects, lack of family support were identified as challenges affecting adherence. Technologies identified and used for the development of the voice-text application included; extensible mark-up language (XML) File, Apache server, Ubuntu Server, Hypertext Pre-processor, and jQuery. In the pilot study, 27 voice messages were broadcasted, 85.2% were delivered, 103 text messages were sent and 92.2% were delivered to the intended recipients. Conclusions Voice-text message mobile health application can be used to reach a wider patient population and it has the capability of addressing some of the challenges affecting TB medication adherence."

This study aims to assess the degree of concordance between signals based on irregular incremental lines (ILs) and reported pregnancies. Material and methods 23 recent and 24 archaeological human teeth with known birth history were included in this investigation. 129 histological sections of tooth roots were assessed for irregularities in appearance and width using a standardized protocol. Similarity of observed irregularities at the section level allowed us to define signals at the tooth level. The sensitivity of signals to detect pregnancies was determined and related to the signal prevalence. Results Pregnancy signals were frequently visually observed. However, applying a standardized process we could only reach signal sensitivities to identify pregnancies up to 20 percentage points above chance level. Conclusions Based on a standardized and reproducible method it could be confirmed that some pregnancies leave visible signals in the tooth cementum. The results show the potential of the tooth cementum to support reconstruction of life courses in paleopathology. However, it seems that not all pregnancies affect the cementogenesis in such a way that irregular ILs are identifiable. Further research is needed to better understand which type of pregnancies and other conditions are recorded in the tooth cementum."

Hence, to fulfill the needs of sustainable agriculture, it is necessary to improve biological nitrogen fixation in leguminous crops. Nod inducing gene families plays a crucial role in the interaction between rhizobia and legumes, leading to biological nitrogen fixation. However, nod inducing genes identification and characterization has not yet been performed in Arachis hypogaea . In this study, identification and genome-wide analysis of nod inducing genes are performed so that to explore their potential functions in the Arachis hypogaea for the first time. Nod genes were comprehensively analyzed by phylogenetic clustering analysis, gene structure determination, detection of conserved motifs, subcellular localization, conserved motifs, cis -acting elements and promoter region analysis. This study identified 42 Nod inducing genes in Arachis hypogaea , their sequences were submitted to NCBI and accession numbers were obtained. Potential involvement of these genes in biological nitrogen fixation has been unraveled, such as, phylogenetic analysis revealed that nod inducing genes evolved independently in Arachis hypogaea , the amino acid structures exhibited 20 highly conserved motifs, the proteins are present at different locations in cells and the gene structures revealed that all the genes are full-length genes with upstream intronic regions. Further, the promoter analysis determined a large number of cis -regulatory elements involved in nodulation. Moreover, this study not only provides identification and characterization of genes underlying developmental and functional stages of nodulation and biological nitrogen fixation but also lays the foundation for further revelation of nod inducing gene family. Besides, identification and structural analysis of these genes in Arachis hypogaea may provide a theoretical basis for the study of evolutionary relationships in future analysis."

We estimated the costs to the public purse of health, education, criminal justice and social care service use associated with psychiatric conditions among adolescents in Brazil; and examined whether the trajectory of psychopathology and its impact on daily life, and parental stigma towards mental illness, was associated with service utilisation and costs. Methods Data on reported service use among adolescents from a prospective community cohort (n = 1,400) were combined with Brazilian unit costs. Logistic regression and generalised linear models were used to examine factors associated with service use and associated costs, respectively. Results Twenty-two percent of those who presented with a psychiatric disorder used some type of service for their mental health in the previous twelve months. Higher odds of service use were associated with having a diagnosed mental disorder (either incident, [OR = 2.49, 95%CI = 1.44–4.30, p = 0.001], remittent [OR = 2.16, 95%CI = 1.27–3.69, p = 0.005] or persistent [OR = 3.01, 95%CI = 1.69–5.36, p&lt;0.001]), higher impact of symptoms on adolescent’s life (OR = 1.32, 95%CI = 1.19–1.47, p&lt;0.001) and lower parental stigma toward mental illness (OR = 1.12, 95%CI = 1.05–1.20, p = 0.001). Average annual cost of service use was 527.14 USD (s.d. = 908.10). Higher cost was associated with higher disorder impact (β = 0.25, 95%CI = 0.12–0.39, p&lt;0.001), lower parental stigma (β = 0.12, 95%CI = 0.02–0.23, p = 0.020) and white ethnicity (β = 0.55, 95%CI = 0.04–1.07, p = 0.036). Conclusion The impact of mental health problems on adolescents’ daily lives and parental stigmatising attitudes toward mental illness were the main predictors of both service use and costs."

We examined the relative importance of two administrative levels for geographic variation in the suicide rate between 2014-2016 in Seoul, the capital city of Korea.Two-level linear regression with Dongs (level 1) nested within Gus (level 2) was performed based on suicide death data aggregated at the Dong-level. We performed pooled analyses and then year-stratified analyses. Dong-level socioeconomic status and environmental characteristics were included as control variables.The overall age- and sex- standardized suicide rate across all Dongs decreased over time from 24.9 deaths per 100,000 in 2014 to 23.7 deaths in 2016. When Dong and Gu units were simultaneously considered in a multilevel analysis, most of the variation in suicide rate was attributed to within-Gu, between-Dong differences with a contribution of Gu-level being small and decreasing over time in year (Variance partitioning coefficient of Gu = 5.3% in 2014, <0.1% in 2015 and 2016). The number of divorce cases per 100,000 explained a large fraction of variation in suicide rate at the Dong-level.Findings from this study suggest that ecological micro-area unit is more important in reducing the geographic variation in the suicide rate.

This study aimed to verify the effects of the cultural adaptation promotion resilience program (CAPRP) on resilience, acculturation stress, depression, and quality of life among mothers-in-law in multi-cultural families. Forty-two participants from multicultural family support centres in the metropolitan city A were assigned to either the intervention group or the control group. The CAPRP was performed for 60 minutes, twice a week for four weeks. The intervention group showed a significant decrease in the acculturation stress (p = .002), and depression (p = .006), while resilience (p < .001) and quality of life (p < .001) significantly increased compared to the control group. The intervention group reported significant improvements in resilience, acculturation stress, depression, and quality of life in comparison with the control group. The results indicated that the CAPRP, developed based on positive cognitive appraisal, was an efficient nursing intervention for mothers-in-law in multicultural families."

https://openalex.org/W4295456662,"The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to determine the extent to which Congolese refugees seek health information, to identify and assess the resources used while exercising Health Information-Seeking Behavior (HISB), and to identify individual determinants that affect their HISB.Building Bridges program participants who resided in Texas between 2017-2020, reported country of origin as Democratic Republic of Congo, and responded to HISB questions were included in this study. Four HISB questions asked about frequency seeking health information, preferred source and perceived trustworthiness of source, and frequency worrying about their health. Associations between HISB and sociodemographic factors (age, gender, education years, years in US, proficiency speaking English, marital status) were tested using Pearson chi-square or Fisher's exact tests (α≤0.05).Most participants (59%) reported seeking health information sometimes. Less than half (44%) of participants identified doctors as their preferred source of health information, Twenty-five percent relied on family, friends, and community leaders, and 23% used media sources. Doctors were identified as the most trustworthy source (71%), family and friends were the second highest trusted source (25%), whereas media sources were the least trusted (4%). Sociodemographic factors age (p = .02), gender (p < .01), and education years (p < .01) were the only significant predictors of preferred information sources. Conversely, those residing in US <5 years were more likely to seek health information more frequently (p = .01). The majority of participants did not worry about their health, and it was not significantly associated with source or frequency of seeking health information.The high trust in doctors represents an opportunity for healthcare professionals to educate and address individual barriers contributing to refugees' underutilization of preventive care services such as routine immunizations and preventive health screenings."

Four combinations of US-volumes were calculated using transperineal (TP) and transabdominal (TA) views, with triplanar measurements to calculate volume and US-PSAD. Intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to compare US and MRI volumes. Categorical comparison of MRI-PSAD and US-PSAD was performed at PSAD cut-offs <0.15, 0.15-0.20, and >0.20 ng/mL2 to assess agreement with MRI-PSAD risk-stratification decisions.64 men were investigated, mean age 69 years and PSA 7.0 ng/mL. 36/64 had biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer (18 Gleason 3+3, 18 Gleason ≥3+4). Mean MRI-derived gland volume was 60 mL, compared to 56 mL for TA-US, and 65 mL TP-US. ICC demonstrated good agreement for all US volumes with MRI, with highest agreement for transabdominal US, followed by combined TA/TP volumes. Risk-stratification decisions to biopsy showed concordant agreement between triplanar MRI-PSAD and ultrasound-PSAD in 86-91% and 92-95% at PSAD thresholds of >0.15 ng/mL2 and >0.12 ng/mL2, respectively. Decision to biopsy at threshold >0.12 ng/mL2, demonstrated sensitivity ranges of 81-100%, specificity 85-100%, PPV 86-100% and NPV 83-100%. Transabdominal US provided optimal sensitivity of 100% for this clinical decision, with specificity 85%, and transperineal US provided optimal specificity of 100%, with sensitivity 87%.Transperineal-US and combined TA-TP US-derived PSA density values compare well with standard MRI-derived values and could be used to provide accurate PSAD at presentation and inform the need for further investigations."
https://openalex.org/W4295482261,"The incidence of atelectasis is high in patients undergoing general anesthesia. This may cause oxygenation impairment and further contribute to postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs). As important airway management devices for general anesthesia, few studies have compared the effects of laryngeal mask airway (LMA) and endotracheal tube (ETT) on atelectasis. Additionally, lung ultrasound has been increasingly used for bedside atelectasis diagnosis. For the above considerations, this trial is designed to compare the effects of LMA and ETT on atelectasis assessed by lung ultrasound scores, further providing more powerful clinical evidence for perioperative respiratory management of non-laparoscopic elective lower abdominal surgery under general anesthesia.This is a prospective, single-center, single-blind, randomized controlled trial. From July 2021 to July 2022, 180 patients undergoing elective non-laparoscopic lower abdominal surgery under general anesthesia will be recruited and randomly divided into the ETT and LMA groups at a ratio of 1:1. The primary outcome is the total atelectasis LUS of 12 lung regions 15 min after the establishment of the artificial airway. The total atelectasis LUS at the end of surgery and 30 min after extubation, oxygenation index, postoperative airway complications, PPCs, and length of stay will be analyzed as secondary indicators.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: ChiCTR1900020818.

https://openalex.org/W4295513270,"To develop a machine learning algorithm utilizing heart rate variability (HRV) and salivary cortisol to detect the presence of acute stress among pregnant women that may be applied to future clinical research.ECG signals and salivary cortisol were analyzed from 29 pregnant women as part of a crossover study involving a standardized acute psychological stress exposure and a control non-stress condition. A filter-based features selection method was used to identify the importance of different features [heart rate (HR), time- and frequency-domain HRV parameters and salivary cortisol] for stress assessment and reduce the computational complexity. Five machine learning algorithms were implemented to assess the presence of stress with and without salivary cortisol values.On graphical visualization, an obvious difference in heart rate (HR), HRV parameters and cortisol were evident among 17 participants between the two visits, which helped the stress assessment model to distinguish between stress and non-stress exposures with greater accuracy. Eight participants did not display a clear difference in HR and HRV parameters but displayed a large increase in cortisol following stress compared to the non-stress conditions. The remaining four participants did not demonstrate an obvious difference in any feature. Six out of nine features emerged from the feature selection method: cortisol, three time-domain HRV parameters, and two frequency-domain parameters. Cortisol was the strongest contributing feature, increasing the assessment accuracy by 10.3% on average across all five classifiers. The highest assessment accuracy achieved was 92.3%, and the highest average assessment accuracy was 76.5%.Salivary cortisol contributed a significant increase in accuracy of the assessment model compared to using a range of HRV parameters alone. Our machine learning model demonstrates acceptable accuracy in detection of acute stress among pregnant women when combining salivary cortisol with HR and HRV parameters."
https://openalex.org/W4295513620,"The interaction among proteins is one of the most fundamental methods of information transfer in the living system. Many methods have been developed in order to identify the interaction pairs or groups either in vivo or in vitro. The in vitro pulldown/coprecipitation assay directly observes the protein that binds to the target. This method involves electrophoresis, which is a technique of a low resolution as well as a low throughput. As a better alternative, we wish to propose a new method that is based on the NMR spectroscopy. This method utilizes the aggregation of the target protein and the concomitant signal disappearance of the interacting partner. The aggregation is accomplished by the elastin-like polypeptide, which is fused to the target. If a protein binds to this supramolecular complex, its NMR signal then becomes too broadened in order to be observed, which is the basic phenomenon of the NMR spectroscopy. Thus, the protein that loses its signal is the one that binds to the target. A compound that interferes with these types of bindings among the proteins can be identified by observing the reappearance of the protein signals with the simultaneous disappearance of the signals of the compound. This technique will be applied in order to find an interaction pair in the information transfer pathway as well as a compound that disrupts it. This proposed method should be able to work with a mixture of proteins and provide a higher resolution in order to find the binding partner in a higher throughput fashion."
