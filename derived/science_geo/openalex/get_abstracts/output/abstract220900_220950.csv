https://openalex.org/W2044977893,"The cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 possesses multiple inorganic carbon (Ci) uptake systems that are regulated by Ci availability. The control mechanisms of these systems and their integration with other cell functions remain to be clarified. An analysis of the changes in global gene expression in response to Ci downshift and the inactivation of ndhR (sll1594), a LysR family regulator of Ci uptake is presented in this report. Mild Ci limitation (3% CO2 (v/v) in air to air alone) induced a dramatic up-regulation of genes encoding both inducible CO2 and HCO3- uptake systems. An induction of ndhD5/ndhD6 and other genes in a probable transcriptional unit was observed, suggesting a function in inducible Ci uptake. The expression of slr1513 and sll1735, physically clustered with sbtA and ndhF3/ndhD3/cupA, respectively, were also coordinated with upstream genes encoding the essential components for HCO3- and CO2 uptake. Ci limitation induced the regulatory genes slr1214, sll1292, slr1594, sigD, sigG, and sigH, among which slr1214, a two-component response regulator, showed the earliest induction, implying a role for the early response to Ci limitation. Opposite regulation of genes encoding the assimilation of carbon and nitrogen demonstrated a striking coordination of expression to balance C- and N-fluxes. The analyses revealed that ndhR inactivation up-regulated the expression of sbtA/sbtB, ndhF3/ndhD3/cupA/sll1735, and slr2006-13 including ndhD5 and ndhD6, indicating a vital role of this regulatory gene in both CO2 and HCO3- acquisition of the cyanobacterium. We therefore suggest that ndhR be renamed ccmR to better represent its broader regulatory characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W2028860264,"Stable supercomplexes of bacterial respiratory chain complexes III (ubiquinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase) and IV (cytochrome c oxidase) have been isolated as early as 1985 (Berry, E. A., and Trumpower, B. L. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 2458-2467). However, these assemblies did not comprise complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase). Using the mild detergent digitonin for solubilization of Paracoccus denitrificans membranes we could isolate NADH oxidase, assembled from complexes I, III, and IV in a 1:4:4 stoichiometry. This is the first chromatographic isolation of a complete “respirasome.” Inactivation of the gene for tightly bound cytochrome c552 did not prevent formation of this supercomplex, indicating that this electron carrier protein is not essential for structurally linking complexes III and IV. Complex I activity was also found in the membranes of mutant strains lacking complexes III or IV. However, no assembled complex I but only dissociated subunits were observed following the same protocols used for electrophoretic separation or chromatographic isolation of the supercomplex from the wild-type strain. This indicates that the P. denitrificans complex I is stabilized by assembly into the NADH oxidase supercomplex. In addition to substrate channeling, structural stabilization of a membrane protein complex thus appears as one of the major functions of respiratory chain supercomplexes. Stable supercomplexes of bacterial respiratory chain complexes III (ubiquinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase) and IV (cytochrome c oxidase) have been isolated as early as 1985 (Berry, E.

In addition to substrate channeling, structural stabilization of a membrane protein complex thus appears as one of the major functions of respiratory chain supercomplexes. With mitochondria, eukaryotic cells possess specialized organelles dedicated mainly to oxidative phosphorylation. Inner mitochondrial membranes of higher eukaryotes like mammalia are highly enriched for the four respiratory chain complexes, NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I), succinate: ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex II), ubiquinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase (complex III), and cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV), which generate an electrochemical potential across this membrane. F1FO-ATP synthase (complex V) uses this electrochemical proton gradient to synthesize ATP (1Hatefi Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 1015-1069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterial respiratory complexes are located in the cytoplasmic membrane. Paracoccus denitrificans, a Gram-negative soil bacterium, uses an electron chain for aerobic growth that comprises a full complement of mitochondrial respiratory complexes I-IV plus ATP synthase. In context of the endosymbiotic theory (2Margulis L. Origin of Eukaryote Cells. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1970Google Scholar), proteobacteria like P. denitrificans are therefore regarded as likely ancestors of present day mitochondria (3John P. Whatley F.R.

In addition to its “canonical” respiratory chain, respiration in P. denitrificans is characterized by many branching points. Alternative oxidases (ba3 quinol oxidase and cbb3 cytochrome oxidase) allow growth under strongly varying oxygen concentrations. Additionally, Paracoccus may use a variety of electron donors (e.g. hydrogen) or nitrate as terminal electron acceptor, which leads to high environmental flexibility (5Baker S. Ferguson S.J. Ludwig B. Page M.D. Richter O.-M.H. van Spanning R.J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1046-1078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterial complexes usually comprise a substantially lower number of subunits, e.g. 14, 3, and 4 subunits for P. denitrificans complexes I, III, and IV (6Xu X. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T.

Although stable interactions of bacterial complexes III and IV to form quinol oxidases have been reported, participation of complex I in supercomplex formation escaped detection so far. This may largely be due to a pronounced detergent sensitivity of complex I from various bacteria. So far, complex I could only be isolated from four bacteria: Escherichia coli (22Leif H. Sled V.D.

We found that digitonin can retain a supramolecular assembly of NADH oxidase from P. denitrificans and isolated for the first time chromatographically a complete “respirasome” comprising complexes I, III, and IV in a 1:4:4 stoichiometry that is suitable for detailed structural and functional analyses.

Isolation of Membranes—The cells were suspended in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μm Pefabloc SC, and broken using a Manton-Gaulin Press (400 bar, 2 × 10 min). After centrifugation (12,000 × g, overnight), the reddish brown membrane portion of the sediment was resuspended in 20 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, and centrifuged again (140,000 × g, 1 h). The sediment was resuspended in a small volume of 20 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, to a final protein concentration of approximately 30 mg/ml. Isolation of P. denitrificans NADH Oxidase—The membranes (200 mg of protein) were suspended in 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm imidazole/HCl, pH 7.0 (8 ml), and solubilized by adding 3 g of digitonin/g protein (6 ml from a 10% digitonin solution). Following 30 min of ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g, 150 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, was added to the supernatant before application to a hydroxylapatite column (40 ml; equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2; run at room temperature). Following washing with 2 column volumes of 0.1% digitonin, 150 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, individual respiratory chain complexes and supercomplexes were eluted by 0.05% Triton X-100, 150 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2. The eluate was concentrated approximately 5-fold to obtain a volume of 2.5 ml (Vivaspin 100,000 MWCO PES) and applied to a Sepharose Cl-6B column (80 ml; length, 1 meter; equilibrated with 0.05% digitonin, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Na-MOPS, pH 7.3; run at 4 °C). The digitonin buffer was stored at least 24 h before use at 4 °C to precipitate insoluble material (approximately 30% of the added digitonin).

PAGE, two-dimensional SDS-PAGE, and densitometric quantification were performed as described recently (34Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal.

Fluorometric flavin mononucleotide determination followed the protocols of Koziol (36Koziol J.

Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). For determination of cytochrome contents of native proteins, redox difference spectra (dithionite-reduced minus ferricyanide-oxidized) were recorded using the following absorption coefficients: c-type cytochromes (cytochrome c1 of complex III and cytochrome c552), ϵ550-540nm = 19.1 mm-1 cm-1; cytochrome b of complex III (containing hemes bL and bH), ϵ562-575nm = 57 mm-aa3, ϵ605-630nm = 23.4 mm-1 cm-1; cytochrome1 cm-1. blue native decylbenzoquinone decylbenzoquinol dichloroindophenol N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. Enzymatic Analyses—All of the enzymatic assays were performed at 30 °C. Decylquinazolinamine-sensitive NADH:decylbenzoquinone (DBQ) oxidoreductase activity of complex I was measured in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 200 μm NADH, 60 μm decylbenzoquinone, 2 mm KCN (ϵNADH, 340-400 nm = 6.22 mm-1 cm-1). Deamino-NADH:hexamino-ruthenium oxidoreductase was determined in 250 mm sucrose, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm NaN3, 20 mm Na-HEPES, pH 8.0, 200 μm deamino-NADH, 2 mm hexamino-ruthenium, measuring the oxidation of deamino-NADH. Thenoyltrifluoroacetone-sensitive succinate:dichloroindophenol (DCIP) oxidoreductase activity of complex II was measured in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm NaN3, 20 mm sodium succinate, 0.002% DCIP, pH 7.0 (ϵDCIP, 610-750 nm = 20.5 mm-1 cm-1). Horse heart cytochrome c and a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 75 mm imidazole/HCl, pH 7.0, was used for the following assays. DBH:cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity of complex III was measured in buffer supplemented with 2 mm KCN, 75 μm DBH, 50 μm cytochrome c, by the antimycin-sensitive reduction of cytochrome c (ϵCyt.c, 540-550 nm = 19.1 mm-1 cm-1). Cytochrome c oxidase activity of complex IV was measured in buffer supplemented with 50 μm reduced cytochrome c by the cyanide-sensitive oxidation of cytochrome c. NADH:cytochrome c oxidoreductase, the coupled activities of complexes I and III, was measured in buffer supplemented with 2 mm KCN, 200 μm NADH, 50 μm cytochrome c, by the antimycin- or decylquinazolinamine-sensitive reduction of cytochrome c. DBQ oxidase activity, the coupled activities of complexes III and IV, was determined in buffer supplemented with 50 μm cytochrome c and 70 μm DBH by the cyanide-sensitive oxidation of DBH (ϵDBH, 280-290 nm = 4.2 mm-1 cm-1). NADH oxidase activity (complexes I, III, and IV) was measured by the cyanide-sensitive oxidation of 200 μm NADH. Protein, Phospholipid, and Ubiquinone Determination—Protein determination was performed using a modified Lowry protocol (39Helenius A. Simons K. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3656-3661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), according to Bradford (40Bradford M.M. Anal.

Warner H. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Crossref Scopus (5837) Google Scholar) and Dröse et al. (44Dröse S. Zwicker K. Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Identification and Purification of Respiratory Chain Supercomplexes—P. denitrificans membranes were solubilized by digitonin and separated by BN-PAGE. A major band representing monomeric complex V (Mapp = 530 kDa) and several additional bands with apparent masses in the range 460-1900 kDa were detected (Fig. 1A, bands a-e). Assignment of these bands was possible after SDS-PAGE in a second dimension and immunological detection (Fig. 1B). Band d contained cytochromes c1 and b and the Rieske iron sulfur protein (separate identification not shown), suggesting that complex III was fully assembled. Some cytochrome c552 was bound in addition, indicating that cytochrome c552 can bind not only to complex IV (described below) but also to complex III. Band e was identified as a subcomplex of complex III missing the Rieske iron sulfur protein and cytochrome c552. The apparent masses of bands d and e from BN-PAGE suggest that fully assembled complex III and also the subcomplex are tetrameric in P. denitrificans. Minor amounts of dimeric complex III, which is the minimal structural unit of cytochrome bc1 complexes (45Xia D. Yu C.A. Kim H. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J.

Assignment of bands a-c was facilitated by the analysis of chromatographically isolated NADH oxidase supercomplex that was found to correspond to band a. It contained monomeric complex I, four copies of complex III, four copies of complex IV, and approximately two molecules of cytochrome c552 (described below). The smaller complexes b and c were devoid of complex I (see Fig. 5A). They contained tetrameric complex III and four and two copies of complex IV, respectively, as deduced from the apparent mass in BN-PAGE (Table I) and densitometric analyses of Coomassie-stained two-dimensional gels (not shown). Because other species containing one or three copies of complex IV were not detected, this suggested that dimeric complex IV is bound to the supercomplexes, although both the structural and functional units have been described as monomers (49Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H.

However, a stable NADH oxidase supercomplex could only be purified from digitonin-solubilized membranes. Chromatographic purification, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” involved three major steps: solubilization/centrifugation, hydroxylapatite chromatography, and gel filtration. The elution profile from the hydroxylapatite column and corresponding BN-PAGE is shown in Fig. 2A. More than 70% of the applied protein including ATP synthase (complex V) passed the column unbound. Yet all of the respiratory chain complexes were almost quantitatively bound and eluted together. The enzymatic activity elution profile of a subsequent gel filtration and the corresponding BN-PAGE (Fig. 2B) indicated that the NADH oxidase associate of complexes I, III, and IV eluted first, followed by assemblies of complexes III and IV and individual complexes V, II, and IV. Table II summarizes the purification of this NADH oxidase supercomplex. Complex II clearly was not associated with NADH oxidase. Only fractions 4-6 from gel filtration were used for further spectrometric and enzymatic analyses.Table IIPurification of NADH oxidase supercomplex from P. denitrificansMembranesSupernatantHydroxylapatiteSepharose fractions 4-6Protein mg (%)202 (100)84 (42)23 (11)4 (2)NADH:DBQ oxidoreductaseμmol min−1 (%)83 (100)87 (106)38 (47)8.7 (10)μmol min−1 mg−10.411.041.662.18DBH:cytochrome c oxidoreductaseμmol min−1 (%)101 (100)76 (76)64 (64)16 (16)μmol min−1 mg−10.500.912.803.99nmol cytochrome b (%)25.1 (100)20.5 (82)12.9 (51)2.8 (11)μmol cytochrome b/g0.120.240.560.71Cytochrome c oxidaseμmol min−1 (%)349 (100)272 (78)176 (50)30.5 (9)μmol min−1 mg−11.733.247.637.62nmol cytochrome aa3 (%)34.8 (100)27.8 (80)20.9 (60)3.14 (9)μmol cytochrome aa3/g0.170.330.900.80Succinate: DCIP oxidoreductaseμmol min−1 (%)30.7 (100)31.1 (101)8.7 (28)0 (0)μmol min−1 mg−10.150.370.380 Open table in a new tab NADH oxidase supercomplex might comprise some protein constituents in addition to components of complexes I, III, and IV (molecular mass = 1.55 MDa) that have not been identified so far. In this case this potential extra mass should total approximately 350 kDa, because the apparent mass of the holo-complex in BN-PAGE was approximately 1.9 MDa. The cytochrome b and cytochrome aa3 contents of the novel NADH oxidase supercomplex preparation were 0.71 and 0.80 μmol/g, respectively. This is far below the theoretical values of 2.6 or 2.1 μmol/g based on a stoichiometry of 4 mol/mol supercomplex for both cytochromes and the calculated mass (1.55 MDa) or the apparent mass from BN-PAGE (1.9 MDa), respectively. This substantial deviation can only be partly explained by protein impurities, because the subunit composition of NADH oxidase isolated chromatographically or by BN-PAGE was very similar, except for some additional bands present in the chromatographic preparation (Fig. 3). However, it seems more likely that the protein elution profile of Fig. 2B reflected an unknown non-protein contaminant most prominent in fractions 5-9, which interfered with the Lowry protein determination method. Digitonin and lipids can be excluded as this unknown non-protein contaminant, because digitonin and extracted Paracoccus lipids were tested not to interfere with the Lowry method. However, less than 1% digitonin in the sample does considerably interfere with the Biuret and Bradford methods, and more than 1% digitonin also interferes with the BCA method. Ratio of Complexes in NADH Oxidase Supercomplex—The ratios of complexes were determined by fluorometric quantification of flavin mononucleotide as a marker for complex I and from pyridine hemochrome spectra (Table III). Calculation of the ratio is based on ratios of one flavin mononucleotide/complex I, two hemes a/complex IV, two hemes b, and one c-type heme (cytochrome c1)/complex III (50Gabellini N. Bowyer J.R. Hurt E. Melandri B.A. Hauska G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 126: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c552 concentration was calculated from the total heme c content (cytochromes c1 plus c552) considering that cytochrome c1 concentration should equal the cytochrome b concentration, which is half the heme b concentration. Complexes I, III, and IV were found to be present in a 1:4:4 ratio. Cytochrome c552 was substoichiometric to complex IV (approximately 1.6 ± 0.8/4). Assuming an initial 1:1 ratio, this would indicate that 40-80% of total cytochrome c552 was lost during isolation.Table IIIDetermination of redox factor contents (nmol/mg) and respiratory complex stoichiometries in isolated NADH oxidase supercomplexFMNHeme aHeme bHeme cSample 10.161.181.200.90Sample 20.201.421.620.89Sample 30.131.041.000.90Average0.16 ± 0.031.21 ± 0.161.27 ± 0.260.9 ± 0.01Complex IComplex IVComplex IIICytochrome c1Cytochrome c552Average0.16 ± 0.030.61 ± 0.080.64 ± 0.130.64 ± 0.130.26 ± 0.13Ratio1.003.8 ± 0.54.0 ± 0.84.0 ± 0.81.6 ± 0.8 Open table in a new tab Enzymatic Activities of Isolated NADH Oxidase Supercomplex—Turnover number of cytochrome c oxidase was 160 ± 15 s-1 (n = 3) in isolated NADH oxidase, compared with 168 ± 15 s-1 with digitonin-solubilized membranes assuming that all spectral absorption at 603 nm in the membranes used was due to cytochrome aa3. These matching data seemed to indicate that alternative enzymes like ba3 quinol oxidase and cbb3 oxidase were not present in considerable amounts in the aerobically grown cells used. Turnover number of DBH:cytochrome c oxidoreductase (complex III) was 95 ± 14 s-1 (n = 3) in isolated NADH oxidase complex. Spectral absorption of complex III at approximately 560 nm in membranes may be superimposed by several other b-type cytochromes, e.g. of succinate dehydrogenase (51Pennoyer J.D. Ohnishi T. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 935: 195-207Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore, complex III activity in membranes cannot be quantified reliably. NADH:DBQ oxidoreductase (complex I) turnover number in digitonin-solubilized membranes could not be calculated on the basis of the extractable flavin mononucleotide in membranes (0.096 μmol flavin/g; n = 6), because extractable flavin apparently originated also from proteins other than complex I, and calculated numbers were approximately 70 s-1 compared with 186 ± 26 s-1 for the isolated NADH oxidase complex. However, by comparing deamino-NADH:DBQ oxidoreductase activity and deamino-NADH:hexamino-ruthenium oxidoreductase activity, a stable catalytic activity of the hydrophilic part of complex I that is not altered by a potential dissociation of the hydrophobic part, it was possible to test whether the complex I turnover number was altered or unchanged during isolation of NADH oxidase (52Zickermann V. Barquera B. Wikström M. Finel M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11792-11796Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Deamino-NADH was used instead of NADH to exclude potential alternative dehydrogenases, although alternative dehydrogenases do not seem to exist in P. denitrificans (53Finel M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The deamino-NADH:hexaminoruthenium/deamino-NADH:DBQ ratio was 3.9 ± 0.2 in membranes and 4.6 ± 0.3 in isolated NADH oxidase supercomplex, indicating that no considerable changes occurred during isolation. NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) activity of isolated NADH oxidase supercomplex was 2.24 ± 0.08 μmol min-1 mg-1. This is the maximal activity theoretically obtainable for coupled activities of complexes I, III, and IV, because activities of complexes III and IV were significantly higher because of the 4-fold excess of the corresponding enzymes to complex I (see turnover numbers above and Table III). NADH: cytochrome c oxidoreductase (complexes I and III) activity of the same protein sample (1.51 ± 0.01 μmol min-1 mg-1) indicated almost optimum electron transfer from complex I to complex III, in agreement with high endogenous phospholipid and quinone contents required for electron transfer. Based on the Lowry protein determination, the phospholipid content decreased from 980 ± 80 nmol/mg in membranes to 290 ± 10 nmol/mg in isolated NADH oxidase, whereas the ubiquinone content increased from 2.7 ± 0.3 nmol/mg in membranes to 6.7 ± 0.8 nmol/mg in isolated NADH oxidase. The 8-fold increase of the quinone/phospholipid ratio seems to indicate specific enrichment of ubiquinone in the NADH oxidase supercomplex. A ubiquinone/supercomplex ratio of 10 mol/mol was calculated based on the Lowry protein determination. Considering a potential interference of a non-protein contaminant with the Lowry method as described above, the ratio can approach a value of 30 mol/mol. However, specific NADH oxidase activity (complexes I, III, and IV) was reduced by 74% to 0.53 ± 0.07 μmol min-1 mg-1. Similarly, DBH oxidase (complexes III and IV) was reduced by 70% to 1.19 ± 0.01 μmol min-1 mg-1 compared with 4.07 ± 0.12 μmol min-1 mg-1 for DBH:cytochrome c oxidoreductase (complex III). This seems to indicate that the transfer of electrons between complexes III and IV was impeded, presumably by partial loss of cytochrome c552, as described above. Assembly into NADH Oxidase Supercomplex Stabilizes Complex I—Digitonin is one of the mildest detergents known. However, it was not clear whether retention of the complex I integrity in isolated NADH oxidase was due to the particular detergent properties or to an additional stabilizing role of supercomplex formation. To address this question, we compared respiratory chain activities in digitonin-solubilized membranes and the stability of complex I from wild-type and mutant strains during chromatography and BN-PAGE. Complex III activity was not adversely affected by the loss of cytochrome c552 or complex IV in the corresponding mutant strains (Fig. 4). However, the loss of complex III in the complex III mutant strain led to considerable reduction of complex I and IV activities, indicating that complex III is required for assembly/stability of both complexes. A moderate reduction of complexes I and IV was also observed in the mutant strain lacking cytochrome c552, indicating that also cytochrome c552 favors assembly/stability of the two complexes. Complex I activity was substantially lower in all mutant strains compared with wild type, which might be taken as a hint for impeded assembly or stability of complex I in these membranes. Although all complex I activities were stable for 60 min after solubilization using low digitonin/protein ratios, reduced stability of complex I in the mutant strains lacking complexes III or IV became apparent from the subsequent analyses. Attempts to isolate complex I from mutant strains lacking complexes III or IV led to an almost complete loss of NADH:DBQ oxidoreductase activity when the same isolation protocol as for parental strain was applied (results not shown). Even omission of the hydroxylapatite step that requires use of low Triton X-100 concentrations for protein elution and direct gel filtration using digitonin was not successful. These findings seem to indicate that complex I from these mutant strains is sufficiently stable at the low digitonin/lipid ratios used for solubilization, but stability is reduced under the conditions of chromatography. Because the presence of only one of the two complexes in the corresponding mutant strains could not protect complex I from inactivation during chromatography, we conclude that complex I requires assembly into a complete NADH oxidase complex for optimal stability. Reduced stability of complex I in these mutant strains was also apparent from the complete dissociation of complex I under the conditions of BN-PAGE. Following two-dimensional SDS-PAGE and electroblotting, a mixture of specific antibodies was used to identify the location of assembled complexes and dissociated subunits. Using parental strain Pd1222 (Fig. 5A), the antibodies identified supercomplexes a, b, and c and individual complexes III and IV, but intact individual complex I was not present. Dissociated complex I subunits NQO 3 and 1 were found at the running front of BN-PAGE, i.e. at the right-hand side of the two-dimensional gel. At present we cannot discriminate between two possibilities. The dissociated subunits might either originate from individual complex I if larger fractions of it were in equilibrium with supercomplexes b and c. On the other hand, almost all complex I might initially assemble into NADH oxidase supercomplex, which partially disintegrates during BN-PAGE. Using the complex III deletion strain (Fig. 5C), individual complex IV was detected but no assembled complex I. This seems to indicate that all complex I that was functional after solubilization by digitonin dissociated under the conditions of BN-PAGE. Analysis of the complex IV deletion strain (Fig. 5D) led to a similar result, except that stable tetrameric complex III was identified. The proteins involved in the interaction of complexes III and IV are not known. Tightly bound cytochrome c552 that possesses a transmembrane anchor (31Turba A. Jetzek M. Ludwig B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 259-265PubMed Google Scholar) initially was regarded as a candidate linker protein, because it binds preferentially to complex IV, and minor amounts were also found associated with complex III. Analyzing the strain carrying an inactivated cycM gene coding for cytochrome c552 (Fig. 5B) indicated that this electron carrier was not essential for formation of supercomplexes a, b, and c. However, the amounts of supercomplexes were reduced, and the amounts of dissociated subunits of complex I were increased, indicating that cytochrome c552 favors supercomplex formation and indirectly stabilizes complex I. Summarizing, we conclude that detergent-labile complex I from P. denitrificans is protected by supercomplex formation. Deletion of complexes III and IV causes decreased complex I contents in membranes, suggesting altered assembly/stability of complex I that is not assembled into a complete NADH oxidase supercomplex also in membranes. However, detergent-stable NADH dehydrogenases, like E. coli complex I, do not require supercomplex formation. In fact, E. coli does not possess complex III. Similarly, complexes I from the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica, and the hyperthermophilic eubacterium A. aeolicus are rather stable (25Peng G. Fritzsch G. Zickermann V. Schägger H. Mentele R. Lottspeich F. Bostina M. Radermacher M. Huber R. Stetter K.O. Michel H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3032-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 54Kashani-Poor N. Kerscher S. Zickermann V. Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 186-193Google Scholar), and no respiratory chain supercomplexes could be detected. Structural stabilization of a labile membrane protein complex seems to be a major function of supercomplex formation, in addition to substrate channeling, which is easily envisaged for the interaction of complexes III and IV in P. denitrificans via cytochrome c552 but also seems to play a role for the interaction of complexes I and III via ubiquinone, as recently reported for the bovine respirasome (55Genova A.L. Bianchi C. Lenaz G. Ital. J. Biochem. 2003; 52: 58-61PubMed Google Scholar). We are grateful to Andrea Duchêne, Hans-Werner Müller, and Andrea Hermann for their excellent technical support. We also thank Drs. Volker Zickermann and Ulrich Brandt for many helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2011610612,"Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β has been associated with renal glomerular matrix accumulation. We previously showed that Smad3 promotes COL1A2 gene activation by TGF-β1 in human glomerular mesangial cells. Here, we report that the PI3K/Akt pathway also plays a role in TGF-β1-increased collagen I expression. TGF-β1 stimulates the activity of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase (PDK)-1, a downstream target of PI3K, starting at 1 min. Akt, a kinase downstream of PDK-1, is phosphorylated and concentrates in the membrane fraction within 5 min of TGF-β1 treatment. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 decreases TGF-β1-stimulated α1(I) and α2(I) collagen mRNA expression. Similarly, LY294002 or an Akt dominant negative construct blocks TGF-β1 induction of COL1A2 promoter activity. However, PI3K stimulation alone is not sufficient to increase collagen I expression, since neither a constitutively active p110 PI3K construct nor PDGF, which induces Akt phosphorylation, is able to stimulate COL1A2 promoter activity or mRNA expression, respectively. LY294002 inhibits stimulation of COL1A2 promoter activity by Smad3. In a Gal4-LUC assay system, blockade of the PI3K pathway significantly decreases TGF-β1-induced transcriptional activity of Gal4-Smad3. Activity of SBE-LUC, a Smad3/4-responsive construct, is stimulated by over-expression of Smad3 or Smad3D, in which the three C-terminal serine phospho-acceptor residues are mutated. This induction is blocked by LY294002, suggesting that inhibition of the PI3K pathway decreases Smad3 transcriptional activity independently of C-terminal serine phosphorylation. However, TGF-β1-induced total serine phosphorylation of Smad3 is decreased by LY294002, suggesting that Smad3 is phosphorylated by the PI3K pathway at serine residues other than the direct TGF-β receptor I target site. Thus, although the PI3K-PDK1-Akt pathway alone is insufficient to stimulate COL1A2 gene transcription, its activation by TGF-β1 enhances Smad3 transcriptional activity leading to increased collagen I expression in human mesangial cells. This cross-talk between the Smad and PI3K pathways likely contributes to TGF-β1 induction of glomerular scarring.

A number of studies indicate that TGF-β plays a critical role in renal matrix accumulation. TGF-β has been linked to fibrogenesis in experimental models of glomerulonephritis and diabetic nephropathy (1.Sharma K. Ziyadeh F.N. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1139-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 2.Border W.A. Noble N.A. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 1388-1396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Its expression is elevated in human glomeruli under conditions associated with increased extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition such as diabetic nephropathy and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (2.Border W.A. Noble N.A. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 1388-1396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Members of the TGF-β superfamily signal via heteromeric complexes of transmembrane serine/threonine kinases, the type I and type II receptors. The Smad proteins function down-stream from the TGF-β family receptors to transduce signal to the nucleus (3.Piek E. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2105-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 4.Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 5.Massagué J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, the type II receptor recruits and phosphorylates type I receptor (TβRI). The receptor-regulated or pathway-restricted Smads (R-Smads) contain an SSXS phosphorylation site at their C-terminal end that is a direct target of TβRI. Once phosphorylated, the R-Smads associate with the common-partner Smad, Smad4. The resulting heteromultimer translocates to the nucleus where it regulates expression of TGF-β target genes by direct binding to DNA and/or interaction with other transcription factors (3.Piek E. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2105-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 4.Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin.

Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) phosphorylate inositol-containing lipids at the d-3 position of the inositol ring. They are divided into three classes in mammalian cells. Class III PI3Ks produce phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns)-3-P, which is constitutively present in all cells. In vitro, class I and class II PI3Ks can utilize PtdIns, PtdIns-4-P and PtdIns-4,5-P2. However, in the cells, class I PI3Ks preferentially convert PtdIns-4,5-P2 into PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (PIP3) following stimulation by tyrosine kinase (class Ia) or heteromeric G-protein-coupled (class Ib) receptors (6.Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 7.Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar, 8.Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4657) Google Scholar). Class I PI3Ks are heterodimers of a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110α, p110β, p110δ, and p110γ) and an adaptator/regulator subunit (p85α, p85β, p55, and p101). Following PI3K activation, PIP3 recruits the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase (PDK)-1 and Akt/PKB, bringing these proteins into proximity at the plasma membrane where Akt is phosphorylated on threonine 308 by PDK-1. This is followed by phosphorylation at serine 473 by a yet-to-be identified mechanism. Once activated, Akt leaves the plasma membrane to phosphorylate intracellular substrates. Akt also has been shown to translocate to the nucleus where it can phosphorylate transcription factors (9.Toker A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 652-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). A few studies have suggested that the PI3K signaling pathway could be modulated by members of the TGF-β family (10.Higaki M. Shimokado K. Arteriosler. Thromb. Vasc.

In human airway smooth muscle cells, the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K associates with type I and type II TGF-β receptors and TGF-β1 enhances activation of PI3K by epidermal growth factor (14.Krymskaya V.P.

However, the role of PI3K in fibrosis in response to TGF-β1 has not been investigated. We previously showed that TGF-β1-induced collagen I gene expression is Smad3-dependent in human mesangial cells (15.Poncelet A.-C. de Caestecker M.P. Schnaper H.W. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1354-1365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 16.Poncelet A.-C. Schnaper H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6983-6992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that TGF-β1 activates PDK-1 and Akt, two downstream targets of PI3K, in these cells. Inhibition of the PI3K pathway with LY294002 or an Akt dominant-negative construct abrogates TGF-β1-stimulated COL1A2 gene transcription. Furthermore, blockade of the PI3K pathway decreases Smad3 activity in transcriptional assays. These data suggest that cross-talk between Smads and the PI3K pathway regulates collagen I expression in response to TGF-β1. Materials—Reagents were purchased from the following vendors: active, human recombinant TGF-β1, and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN); rabbit anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473), rabbit anti-Akt antibody, LY294002 from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA); rabbit anti-phospho-Smad2 (Ser 465/467) from Upstate (Lake Placid, NY); mouse anti-cMyc, mouse anti-Smad4 IgG (B-8), mouse anti-Smad1/2/3 IgG (H-2), rabbit anti-phospho-Smad2/3 IgG (Ser433/435), goat anti-Smad2/3 IgG (N19), anti-goat IgG-horse-radish peroxidase (HRP), from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-rabbit IgG-HRP, luciferase and β-galactosidase assay systems from Promega (Madison, WI); rabbit anti-phosphoserine antibody and protein G-Sepharose from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Stock solutions were made as follows: TGF-β1 in 4 mm HCl containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin; PDGF in water; LY294002 in Me2SO. Cell Culture—Human mesangial cells were isolated from glomeruli by differential sieving of minced normal human renal cortex obtained from anonymous surgery or autopsy specimens. The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, sodium pyruvate, Hepes buffer, and 8 μg/ml insulin (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) as previously described (17.Poncelet A.-C. Schnaper H.W. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1998; 275: F458-F466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were used between passages 5 and 8. PDK-1 Activity Assay—Cells in medium containing 1% FBS were treated with 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 for various time periods leading up to simultaneous harvest in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 150 mm NaCl; 1% Nonidet P-40; 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors (Sigma). After clarification by centrifugation, the protein content was determined by Bradford protein assay (BioRad). Cell lysates were incubated with a SGK1 peptide substrate (Upstate, Waltham, MA) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min at 30 °C. The reactions were spotted on phosphocellulose and washed four times with 1% phosphoric acid followed by an acetone rinse. The amount of radioactivity incorporated into the substrate was determined by scintillation counting. Active PDK-1 (Upstate Biotechnologies) was used as a positive control. Preparation of Cell Lysates, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were switched to medium containing 1% FBS and treated with 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 or 5 ng/ml PDGF for various time periods leading to simultaneous harvest. In some experiments, the cells were preincubated with 10 μm LY294002 or Me2SO as vehicle control for 1 h prior to TGF-β1. For the immunoprecipitation experiments, 500 μg of lysates were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of anti-Smad2/3 antibody (N-19) followed by precipitation with 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose as previously described (16.Poncelet A.-C. Schnaper H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6983-6992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The resulting immunoprecipitates or whole cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphoserine antibody (1 μg/ml); anti-Smad2/3, anti-Smad1/2/3 or anti-Smad4 antibody (0.2 μg/ml); anti-phospho-Smad2 antibody (1 μg/ml); anti-phospho-Smad3 antibody (2 μg/ml); anti-phospho-Akt or anti-Akt antibody (1:1,000). The blots were developed with chemiluminescence reagents according to the manufacturer's protocol (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Autoradiograms were scanned with an Arcus II Scanner (AGFA) in transparency mode, and densitometric analysis was performed using the NIH Image 1.61 program for Macintosh. Cell Fractionation—Cells were scraped into a detergent-free buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 0.5 mm EDTA; 0.5 mm EGTA; 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The cells were then disrupted by 15 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. After 45 min centrifugation at 100,000 × g, the supernatant was removed and saved as the S-100 fraction, representing the cytosolic fraction. The pellet, representing the particulate fraction, was resuspended in buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and syringe sheared. After 30 min of incubation on ice, the insoluble material was removed by 10-min centrifugation at 18,000 × g, and the resulting supernatant was saved as the Triton X-100 soluble fraction, representing the membrane-enriched fraction. After determination of the protein content, each fraction was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Akt antibody as described above. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—The day before the transfection, cells were seeded on 6-well plates at 6.5 to 8 × 104 cells per well. Eighteen hours later, cells were switched to 1% FBS medium and transfected with the indicated constructs along with CMV-SPORT-β-galactosidase as a control of transfection efficiency. Transfection was performed with the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) as previously described (15.Poncelet A.-C. de Caestecker M.P. Schnaper H.W. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1354-1365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). After 3 h, 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 or control vehicle was added to the cells. In some experiments, the transfected cells were pretreated for 1 h with LY294002 before adding TGF-β1. 18–24 h later, the cells were harvested in 300 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured as previously described (15.Poncelet A.-C. de Caestecker M.P. Schnaper H.W. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1354-1365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Luciferase assay results were normalized for β-galactosidase activity.

The CMV-SPORT-β-galactosidase was purchased from Invitrogen, the pFR-LUC from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) and the Myc-Akt and Akt dominant-negative constructs from Upstate. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot—Cells were switched to medium containing 1% FBS. They were preincubated with 10 μm LY294002 for 1 h before addition of 1 ng/ml TGF-β1, 5 ng/ml PDGF or control vehicle for 24 h. Total RNA was harvested using TRIzol (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and analyzed by Northern blot as previously described (17.Poncelet A.-C. Schnaper H.W. Am. J. Physiol.

The same blots were successively rehybridized with additional probes after complete stripping. cDNAs for human α1(I) (clone Hf677, Ref. 22.Chu M.-L. Myers J.C. Bernard M.P. Ding J.-F. Ramirez F.

Statistical Analysis—Statistical differences between experimental groups were determined by analysis of variance using StatView 4.02 software program for Macintosh. Values of p < 0.05 by Fisher's PLSD were considered significant. The difference between two comparative groups was further analyzed by unpaired Student's t test. Activation of the PI3K Pathway by TGF-β1—Only a limited number of studies have examined the role of PI3K in TGF-β signaling. None have investigated the potential role of the PI3K pathway in fibrosis induced by TGF-β1. We used human glomerular mesangial cells treated with TGF-β1 as our model to study the mechanism of abnormal matrix accumulation by kidney cells. First, we investigated whether the PI3K pathway is activated in response to TGF-β1 in these cells. We examined whether the activity of PDK-1 (a downstream target of PI3K) is increased by TGF-β1 treatment. Human mesangial cells were treated with 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 for different time periods leading up to simultaneous harvest. Lysates were used for an in vitro kinase assay with a SGK1 peptide substrate. Fig. 1 shows that TGF-β1 stimulates PDK-1 activity beginning at 1 min. The increased activity is sustained for up to 24 h. These data suggest the PI3K pathway is activated by TGF-β1 in human mesangial cells. Because one major target of PDK-1 is Akt, we sought to determine whether PDK-1 activation by TGF-β1 leads to increased Akt activity as measured by membrane translocation and phosphorylation. Cells, treated with TGF-β1 for various durations, were fractionated into cytosol and membrane fractions for analysis by immunoblot with an anti-Akt antibody. Akt translocates to the membrane-enriched fraction in a biphasic manner following TGF-β1 treatment. An initial peak of membrane-associated Akt is observed 5 min after adding TGF-β1 (Fig. 2, A and B). A second peak is detected at 30 min, and membrane association remains elevated at up to 24 h of treatment. Increased membrane association correlates with increased phosphorylation (Fig. 2, C and D). LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, blocks Akt membrane translocation (Fig. 2E) and phosphorylation (Fig. 2F). These results indicate that activation of Akt follows TGF-β1-stimulated PDK-1 activity. TGF-β1-induced PI3K Modulates Collagen I Gene Activity— We previously have shown that TGF-β1 stimulates α2(I) collagen (COL1A2) gene expression in mesangial cells (15.Poncelet A.-C. de Caestecker M.P. Schnaper H.W. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1354-1365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Since the PI3K pathway is activated by TGF-β1, we investigated whether this pathway modulates COL1A2 promoter activity in response to TGF-β1. We performed transient transfection experiments with the 376COL1A2-LUC construct (15.Poncelet A.-C. de Caestecker M.P. Schnaper H.W. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1354-1365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and determined the effect of inhibiting the PI3K pathway on its activity. The transfected cells were pretreated for 1 h with LY294002, a specific inhibitor of PI3K. TGF-β1 was then added for 24 h and luciferase activity was determined. Inhibition of PI3K almost completely blocks TGF-β1-induced COL1A2 promoter activity (Fig. 3). Similarly, co-transfection of a vector expressing a kinase-deficient (K179M) Akt (shown to act as a dominant-negative Ref. 12.Ghosh-Choudhury N. Abboud S.L. Nishimura R. Celeste A. Mahimainathan L. Ghosh Choudhury G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33361-33368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) prevents the response to TGF-β1. Of note, basal promoter activity is also decreased by the dominant-negative construct. These results suggest that the PI3K pathway is necessary for the transcriptional activation of COL1A2 by TGF-β1. Activation of PI3K/Akt Is Not Sufficient for COL1A2 Stimulation—We next sought to determine whether increased PI3K activity is sufficient to stimulate collagen I gene expression. Cells were transfected with the 376COL1A2-LUC construct and a vector expressing a constitutively active p110 (p110*) PI3K subunit (21.Rodriguez-Viviana P. Warne P.H. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2442-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) or the corresponding empty vector. As shown in Fig. 4A, the constitutively active p110 alone does not increase COL1A2 promoter activity. To confirm that the constitutively active p110 construct was active in mesangial cells, lysates from cells co-transfected with Myc-Akt and either p110* or empty vector were immunoprecipitated with an anti-cMyc antibody, and the immunoprecipitated complexes were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-Akt. Akt phosphorylation levels are increased by ∼2 fold in cells transfected with the constitutively active p110 compared with cells transfected with empty vector (data not shown). PDGF has been shown to activate PI3K in various cell types (24.Kazlauskas A. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3279-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 25.Conway A.M. Rakhit S. Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 26.Reif S. Lang A. Lindquist J.N. Yata Y. Gäbele E. Scanga A. Brenner D.A. Rippe R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8083-8090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). We examined whether the PI3K/Akt pathway was activated by PDGF in human mesangial cells. As expected, PDGF stimulates phosphorylation of Akt at serine 473 in a time-dependent manner. (Fig. 4B). Thus, PDGF is able to activate the PI3K pathway in mesangial cells, in agreement with Ghosh Choudhury et al. (27.Ghosh Choudhury G. Karamitsos C. Hernandez J. Gentilini A. Bardgette J. Abboud H.E. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1997; 273: F931-F938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) who have demonstrated that PDGF stimulates PI3K activity, as determined by increased PIP production. Next, we compared the effects of PDGF and TGF-β1 on collagen I transcription. In mesangial cells that were transfected with the 376COL1A2-LUC reporter construct, the collagen I promoter is not stimulated by PDGF but is responsive to TGF-β1 (Fig. 4A). We also measured collagen I mRNA expression after treatment with PDGF or TGF-β1. As expected, PDGF is not able to increase α1(I) and α2(I) collagen mRNA levels (Fig. 4C). In contrast, TGF-β1 stimulates collagen I mRNA expression as previously reported (17.Poncelet A.-C. Schnaper H.W. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1998; 275: F458-F466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the induction is blocked by LY294002 (Fig. 4C). These data further support a role for PI3K in TGF-β1-increased collagen I transcription while PDGF, another activator of the PI3K/Akt pathway, is not able to stimulate COL1A2 gene expression. PI3K Modulation of Collagen I Gene Expression Is through Modulation of Smad3 Activity—We previously have shown that Smad3 stimulates COL1A2 gene transcription (15.Poncelet A.-C. de Caestecker M.P. Schnaper H.W. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1354-1365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 16.Poncelet A.-C. Schnaper H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6983-6992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). We investigated whether the reason why PDGF could not activate collagen I expression was due to an inability to stimulate Smad3 activity. Cells were treated with TGF-β1 or PDGF for different durations and Smad3 phosphorylation levels were examined. TGF-β1 induces increased Smad3 phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner, as previously shown (15.Poncelet A.-C. de Caestecker M.P. Schnaper H.W. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1354-1365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), while PDGF does not activate Smad3 (Fig. 5). Thus, although both PDGF and TGF-β1 are able to stimulate the PI3K pathway, only TGF-β1 leads to phosphorylation of Smad3 that correlates with increased COL1A2 promoter activity. Next, we determined whether inhibition of the PI3K pathway would block Smad3-mediated COL1A2 activation. Mesangial cells were co-transfected with the 376COL1A2-LUC construct and the expression vector for Smad3 or the corresponding empty vector. One hour after adding LY294002 or control vehicle, the cells were treated with TGF-β1 for 24 h. Inhibition of PI3K reduces both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent Smad3-mediated COL1A2 promoter activity (Fig. 6). Together, these data suggest that TGF-β1-stimulated PI3K pathway activity contributes to Smad3 induction of COL1A2 gene transcription. To investigate whether TGF-β1-stimulated PI3K activation modulates Smad3 transactivation activity. Cells were co-transfected with a reporter construct containing five Gal4 binding sites in front of the luciferase gene and a construct expressing the Gal4 DNA binding domain fused to full-length Smad3 (Gal4-Smad3). The cells were pretreated for 1 h with vehicle or LY294002 and then incubated with TGF-β1 for 24 h. The PI3K inhibitor significantly decreases TGF-β1-stimulated Smad3 transcriptional activity (Fig. 7A). Similarly, co-transfection of the dominant-negative Akt construct reduces Smad3 activity (Fig. 7B). These data suggest that the PI3K pathway modulates Smad3 transactivation activity, at least in part, independently of Smad3 DNA binding activity. We also evaluated the effect of PI3K inhibition on the activity of the SBE-LUC reporter construct containing four copies of the GTCTAGAC sequence that has been shown to bind recombinant Smad3 and Smad4 (18.Zawel L. Le Dai J. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Cells were co-transfected with SBE-LUC and a construct expressing wild-type Smad3, or the empty vector (pEXL). Pretreatment for 1 h with LY294002 decreases TGF-β1-induced activity of endogenous Smad3 by ∼60% (Fig. 8, pEXL histograms) as well as transcriptional activity of over-expressed Smad3 (Fig. 8, Smad3 histograms). Smad3D, a construct in which the three C-terminal serine residues of Smad3 are replaced by three aspartic acid residues, can function as a transcriptional activator in the absence of TGF-β1 as previously demonstrated (19.Liu X.

Both are subject to dynamic control by amino acids and insulin. The mechanisms of signaling and cross-talk of their physiological anabolic effects remain elusive. Recent studies established that amino acids and insulin induce p70 S6 kinase (p70S6k) phosphorylation by mTOR, involved in translational control of protein synthesis. Here, the signaling mechanisms of amino acids and insulin in macroautophagy in relation to mTOR were investigated. In isolated rat hepatocytes, both regulatory amino acids (RegAA) and insulin coordinately activated p70S6k phosphorylation, which was completely blocked by rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor. However, rapamycin blocked proteolytic suppression by insulin, but did not block inhibition by RegAA. These contrasting results suggest that insulin controls autophagy through the mTOR pathway, but amino acids do not. Furthermore, micropermeabilization with Saccharomyces aureus α-toxin completely deprived hepatocytes of proteolytic responsiveness to RegAA and insulin, but still maintained p70S6k phosphorylation by RegAA. In contrast, Leu8-MAP, a non-transportable leucine analogue, did not mimic the effect of leucine on p70S6k phosphorylation, but maintained the activity on proteolysis. Finally, BCH, a System L-specific amino acid, did not affect proteolytic suppression or mTOR activation by leucine. All the results indicate that mTOR is not common to the signaling mechanisms of amino acids and insulin in autophagy, and that the amino acid signaling starts extracellularly with their “receptor(s),” probably other than transporters, and is mediated through a novel route distinct from the mTOR pathway employed by insulin.

Macroautophagy, a dominant form in mammalian cells that is subject to nutritional and hormonal controls, consists of multiple steps starting with the formation of an autophagosome, followed by its acidification and fusion with the lysosome to become an autolysosome, and finally complete digestion of the sequestered organelles and macromolecules. Recent advances using molecular genetics have revealed that a variety of protein complexes, e.g. Apg12-Apg5, Apg1-Apg13 conjugation, and LC3 modification systems, participate in the initial autophagosome formation step in quite a complicated manner (4Mizushima N.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). This step has also been considered to be a target for physiological regulation by nutritional and hormonal factors (3Mortimore G.E. Kadowaki M. Jefferson L.S. Sherrington A.D. Handbook of Physiology. II. American Physiological Society, Oxford University Press, New York2001: 553-577Google Scholar, 8Seglen P.O. Bohley P. Experientia (Basel). 1992; 48: 158-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Compared with the molecular machinery, however, the details of their regulatory mechanisms are largely unknown. Recently, amino acids, as well as other nutrients, have attracted growing attention to their regulatory activities on gene expression, mRNA translation, and proteolysis (9Fafournoux P. Bruhat A. Jousse C. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 10Mordier S. Bruchat A. Averous J. Fafournoux P. Storey K.B. Storey J.M. Sensing, Signaling and Cell Adaptation. Elsevier Science B. V., Amsterdam2002: 189-206Google Scholar), and to their signaling mechanisms (11van Sluijters D.A. Dubbelhuis P.F. Blommaart E.F.C. Meijer A.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Concerning proteolysis, among a number of proteolytic systems in the body, autophagic proteolysis is the only mechanism known to be subject to nutritional regulation. Because amino acids, together with hormones such as insulin and glucagon, are the principal physiological regulators of mammalian autophagy, the mechanism of amino acid signaling and its relationship with hormones are major targets to be elucidated. The hypothesis that amino acids have their own signal transduction mechanisms originated from the following evidence. In perfused liver, the extracellular concentrations of phenylalanine and leucine individually controlled autophagic proteolysis (12Kadowaki M. Pösö A.R. Mortimore G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22060-22065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Miotto G. Venerando R. Khurana K.K. Siliprandi N. Mortimore G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22066-22072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Leu8-MAP, a nontransportable leucine analogue, mimicked the effect of leucine (14Miotto G. Venerando R. Marin O. Siliprandi N. Mortimore G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25348-25353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings represented indirect evidence, but strongly suggested the possibility that, for autophagic regulation, amino acids have their own recognition sites at the cell surface and must have a signal transduction mechanism to the site of autophagosome formation inside the cell. A possible candidate for the leucine “receptor/sensor” protein has been reported (15Mortimore G.E. Wert Jr., J.J. Miotto G. Venerando R. Kadowaki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and its purification has progressed. 1G. Miotto, personal communication. 1G. Miotto, personal communication. Concerning the intracellular signaling pathways, possibilities have been raised by several groups. In human colon cancer HT-29 cells, Ogier-Denis et al. (16Ogier-Denis E. Pattingre S. El Benna J. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39090-39095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) proposed the hypothesis that amino acids can control autophagy by inhibiting extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2-dependent GAIP phosphorylation. Another possibility is that the eukaryotic initiation factor 2α kinase signaling pathway is involved in amino acid starvation-induced autophagy in murine embryonic fibroblasts (17Tallóczy Z. Jiang W. Virgin IV, H.W. Leib D.A. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Eskelinen E.-L. Levine B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). In addition, in the last few years, it has been recognized that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 2The abbreviations used are: mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; BCH, 2-amino-2-norbornane carboxylic acid; Ile8-MAP, isoleucyl-multiple antigen peptide; Leu8-MAP, leucyl-multiple antigen peptide; p70S6k, 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase; RegAA, regulatory amino acids; PCA, perchloric acid. 2The abbreviations used are: mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; BCH, 2-amino-2-norbornane carboxylic acid; Ile8-MAP, isoleucyl-multiple antigen peptide; Leu8-MAP, leucyl-multiple antigen peptide; p70S6k, 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase; RegAA, regulatory amino acids; PCA, perchloric acid. kinase is the central component of nutrient- and hormone-sensitive signaling pathways that regulate cell growth, including initiation of mRNA translation, transcription of enzymes for metabolic pathways, amino acid transport, and autophagy (18Dennis P.B.

In protein synthesis, amino acids modulate insulin action by stimulating the activity of mTOR, and their signals converge at this point (22Patti M.-E. Brambilla E. Luzi L. Landaker E.J. Kahn C.R. J.

Meijer A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2320-2326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) pioneered their hypothesis that the inhibition of autophagy by amino acids is mediated by a signal transduction pathway via phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 in isolated hepatocytes. S6 phosphorylation is activated by p70 S6 kinase (p70S6k), which is a direct target of mTOR (26Isotani S. Hara K. Tokunaga C. Inoue H. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34493-34498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). This finding was supported by studies using rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR, in cultured hepatocytes under serum-rich conditions (27Ueno T. Ishidoh K. Mineki R. Tanida I. Murayama K.

It was also reported that, in yeast, starvation-induced autophagy is controlled by TOR (28Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) via an Apg1-Apg13 complex (6Kamada Y. Funakoshi T. Shintani T. Nagano K. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1507-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a study using mouse C2C12 myotubes indicated that the mTOR signaling pathway was not involved in the regulation of macroautophagy by leucine (30Mordier S. Deval C. Béchet D. Tassa A. Ferrara M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29900-29906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, among these inconsistent findings, the kinds of physiological effectors employed to regulate autophagy have not been considered seriously. Therefore, in the present study, we started by confirming the effect of rapamycin on the amino acid regulation of autophagy. Then, by comparing the effectors, amino acids and insulin, to simulate the above conditions, we discovered that these effectors have distinct signaling pathways for controlling autophagic proteolysis in hepatocytes. The results clearly solve apparent discrepancies among the data reported above: insulin, and probably serum, regulate autophagy through an mTOR-dependent pathway, whereas amino acids exert their effect through an mTOR-independent pathway. Thus, in autophagic regulation, unlike protein synthesis, nutritional and hormonal signals do not converge at mTOR, which makes the story more complicated. In addition, we examined the effects of micropermeabilization by α-toxin, Leu8-MAP, and BCH, to further characterize how amino acid signals regulate autophagy in hepatocytes. All the results demonstrated that the signaling of amino acids in autophagic proteolysis starts with their “receptor(s),” probably other than transporters, at the plasma membrane, and has a novel route clearly distinct from the mTOR signaling pathway employed by insulin. Materials—Insulin and glucagon were obtained from Sigma; rapamycin was from Wako Chemicals; l-[U-14C]valine (283 mCi/mmol) and l-[U-14C]leucine (292 mCi/mmol) were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. The rabbit anti-rat p70 S6 kinase antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. The ECL Western blotting detection kit, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG, and cAMP enzyme immunoassay system were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Preparation of Isolated Hepatocytes—Male Wistar/ST rats weighing about 250 g, meal-fed between 14:00 and 18:00 with a 35% casein diet, were used as hepatocyte donors. Liver parenchymal cells were isolated by the collagenase method of Seglen (31Seglen P.O. Prescott D.M. Methods in Cell Biology. 13. Academic Press, New York1976: 29-83Google Scholar), modified slightly to obtain the cells that were sensitive to amino acids (32Venerando R. Miotto G. Kadowaki M. Siliprandi N. Mortimore G.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C455-C461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Freshly isolated hepatocytes were suspended at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 6 mm glucose and 0.5% bovine serum albumin oxygenated with O2:CO2 (95:5, v/v) gas. The cells were incubated in 3-ml suspensions in 10-ml flasks at 37 °C. The amino acids employed were those that have been shown to exert direct effects on autophagic proteolysis, called regulatory amino acids, and were added as multiples of the normal plasma concentrations as shown in the figure legends. The normal concentrations (1×) of the regulatory amino acids including coregulatory Ala (RegAA) were as follows (μm): Leu, 204; Tyr, 98; Pro, 437; Met, 60; His, 92; Trp, 93; Ala, 475 (33Niioka S. Goto M. Ishibashi T. Kadowaki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 1086-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Micropermeabilization with Staphylococcus aureus α-Toxin—Recombinant α-toxin was prepared from Escherichia coli using the method described by Cheley et al. (34Cheley S. Malghani M.S. Song L. Hobaugh M. Gouaux J.E. Yang J. Bayley H. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1433-1443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After fresh hepatocytes were resuspended at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells/ml in HEPES-cytosol buffer (20 mm HEPES, 20 mm NaCl, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgSO4, 0.96 mm NaH2PO4, 0.49 mm CaCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.3) oxygenated with O2 gas, they were treated with the toxin (20.3 rabbit hemolytic unit/ml) for 5 min at 37 °C. Then, the treated cells were centrifuged into a pellet and resuspended in HEPES-cytosol buffer to remove the excess toxin. To supply an energy source in the α-toxin-treated cells, an ATP regenerating system (1.5 mm ATP, 5 mm phosphocreatine, 5 units/ml creatine phosphokinase) was added (35Kadowaki M. Venerando R. Miotto G. Mortimore G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3703-3710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pore formation was checked by a rapid release of cAMP into the medium after glucagon treatment. Measurement of Proteolysis—Because bulk proteolysis regulatable by amino acids occurs in macroautophagy in hepatocytes (3Mortimore G.E. Kadowaki M. Jefferson L.S. Sherrington A.D. Handbook of Physiology. II. American Physiological Society, Oxford University Press, New York2001: 553-577Google Scholar), autophagic proteolysis was measured by Val release from hepatocytes in the presence of cycloheximide (20 μm). After incubation of hepatocytes with various additions for 30 min, cycloheximide was added. Samples for Val analysis were taken at 37 and 47 min. The proteolytic rate was calculated from the difference for this 10-min interval, which was designated “the short exposure method” (see Fig. 1). Samples were deproteinized in ice-cold perchloric acid (PCA, 6% final concentration). The supernatants were stored at -20 °C until analysis. Val was derivatized with dansyl chloride, using l-norvaline as an internal standard, and separated by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography using a Supelcosil LC-18 column (4.6 × 150 mm) as described previously (33Niioka S. Goto M. Ishibashi T. Kadowaki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 1086-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). As another proteolytic measurement without cycloheximide, the rates of protein synthesis and net Val release were measured simultaneously, and the proteolytic rate was calculated from both rates (36Khairallah E.A. Mortimore G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1375-1384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Measurement of Protein Synthesis—The rate of protein synthesis was determined by the amount of [14C]Val incorporation into protein. After starting the hepatocyte incubation, [14C]Val and 5 mm unlabeled Val (specific activity: 0.02 μCi/μmol) were added at 60 min. Samples were taken at 90 min, and precipitated in an equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid. Protein was isolated from the precipitates as described previously, and the radioactivity was counted (36Khairallah E.A. Mortimore G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1375-1384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting of p70 S6 kinase—As an indicator of mTOR kinase activity, the rapamycin-sensitive phosphorylation of p70S6k was measured. Fresh hepatocytes were incubated at 37 °C. Five-ml samples were taken at 30 min, and added to 10 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer (20 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 0.2 mm EDTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate, pH 7.4). The cells were centrifuged into a pellet, resuspended in 4 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer, and then homogenized with a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer (100 strokes, Wheaton Science Products) on ice. The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were boiled for 5 min in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 12.5% glycerol, 1.25% SDS, and 1.25% β-mercaptoethanol. The p70S6k in the supernatants was separated by SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After blocking with 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline/Tween 20, the membrane was incubated with the rabbit anti-rat p70S6k antibody for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG. An ECL Western blot detection kit was used as the substrate for detection of the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the membrane was exposed to Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences). In the case of the effect of individual amino acids, because of their small changes, the electrophoretic forms with different mobilities, designated as α-, β-, γ-, and δ-form, were densitometrically quantified, expressed as the percentage of total p70S6k in hyperphosphorylated forms (β + γ + δ/total), and statistically estimated. Leu Transport Assay—Leu transport activity was measured using the uptake of [14C]Leu into the cells. Hepatocytes were exposed to 4× Leu containing [14C]Leu (specific activity: 94 μCi/mmol). After [14C]Leu addition, cell suspensions were taken at 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 min, layered on top of a separation medium in centrifuge tubes, and then quickly centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 min. The separation medium was prepared by stacking a hydrocarbon oil mixture (1-bromodecane, n-dodecane = 10:1, d = 1.037) on 10% PCA (38Cornell N.W. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Intact cells were harvested in the PCA layer after this centrifugation. Leu uptake into hepatocytes was measured by the radioactivity in the PCA layer and the values were expressed as nanomole of Leu/106 cells. Analytical Procedures—Protein was measured by the Bradford method (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using bovine IgG as the standard. Radioactivity was determined with Aloka liquid scintillation analyzer LSC-1000. All the data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was evaluated by Student's t test. Lack of Effect of Rapamycin on Proteolytic Suppression by Amino Acids—Because Blommaart et al. (25Blommaart E.F.C. Luiken J.J.F.P. Blommaart P.J.E. van Woerkom G.M. Meijer A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2320-2326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) reported that ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation via mTOR was partially involved in the control of autophagy by amino acids in isolated hepatocytes, we started by verifying this possibility. First, the effect of rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR, on amino acid-sensitive proteolysis was tested using our regular short exposure method (Fig. 1). The physiologically maximal level of RegAA (4 times the normal plasma levels, 4×) suppressed proteolysis to about 55%. Rapamycin (100 nm) neither increased proteolysis significantly by itself, nor affected that suppressed by RegAA. No effects were seen even at the much higher dose of 2.5 μm. These unexpected results were inconsistent with those of Blommaart et al. (25Blommaart E.F.C. Luiken J.J.F.P. Blommaart P.J.E. van Woerkom G.M. Meijer A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2320-2326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Because there were several differences in methodology, we repeated their method, i.e. Val release in the presence of cycloheximide throughout a 90-min incubation (a long exposure method) and other additions. As shown in Fig. 2, the Val release suppressed by RegAA was partially restored by rapamycin, which was essentially the same result as theirs. Several possibilities for this discrepancy were considered, e.g. the time course, combination of reagents, etc. Then, because rapamycin was not effective at 30 min, it was tested whether a longer exposure was required for its effectiveness in our study. Hepatocytes were incubated with rapamycin and RegAA for 60 or 90 min and then our short exposure method was employed for proteolytic measurement. However, rapamycin was not effective (data not shown). Next, the possibility of disturbance by cycloheximide was suspected, because it was reported that long exposure to cycloheximide not only inhibits protein synthesis but also perturbs proteolysis (36Khairallah E.A. Mortimore G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1375-1384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to investigate this possibility, an indirect method without cycloheximide was employed. As shown in Table I, protein synthesis and net Val release were determined simultaneously, and then proteolysis was calculated by the sum of synthesis and net release, a method that has been validated previously (36Khairallah E.A. Mortimore G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1375-1384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results were exactly consistent with those in Fig. 1. Therefore, it was proved that the long exposure to cycloheximide was the cause of the discrepancy, and was not appropriate for the measurement of proteolysis.Table IProteolysis calculated by protein synthesis and net balance in hepatocytesConditionSynthesisNet balanceCalculated proteolysisnmol Val/min/106 cellsControl0.437 ± 0.0770.475 ± 0.0460.912 ± 0.120RM0.416 ± 0.0850.430 ± 0.0290.845 ± 0.0644x Reg AA0.432 ± 0.0620.216 ± 0.042ap < 0.01 versus the control.0.649 ± 0.085bp < 0.1 versus the control.4x Reg AA, RM0.414 ± 0.0560.224 ± 0.040ap < 0.01 versus the control.0.627 ± 0.076bp < 0.1 versus the control.a p < 0.01 versus the control.b p < 0.1 versus the control. Open table in a new tab Effect of Rapamycin on the Control of p70S6k Phosphorylation by Amino Acids—The lack of effect of rapamycin raised doubts as to the usefulness of this reagent in our study. Next, we compared the effect of rapamycin on autophagic proteolysis and mTOR activity in relation to amino acid control. The mTOR activity was estimated by the phosphorylation state of p70S6k, a direct target of mTOR kinase (26Isotani S. Hara K. Tokunaga C. Inoue H. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34493-34498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of p70S6k on several sites leads to at least 4 bands with decreased mobility in SDS-PAGE gels, as indicated by an upward shift in the banding pattern (Fig. 3B). RegAA treatment caused an upshift of the p70S6k bands, which indicated stimulation of mTOR kinase activity. Leu, Tyr, and Gln, which are all regulatory amino acids, exhibited significant 22, 32, and 26% suppressions of proteolysis, respectively (Fig. 3A). However, the phosphorylation of p70S6k by Leu, Tyr, or Gln was increased by 18 ± 6(p < 0.05), 9 ± 10, 0 ± 4% compared with the control, respectively, and only Leu had a significant effect on the phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). Rapamycin completely blocked the phosphorylation of p70S6k induced by RegAA, but had no effect on the proteolytic effect of RegAA (Fig. 3A). Nonregulatory amino acids, consisting of 12 amino acids without proteolytic effects, had no effect on proteolysis or p70S6k phosphorylation. These results clearly demonstrate that the mTOR-mediated pathway is not involved in the control of autophagic proteolysis by amino acids, and the effects of amino acids on these two processes seem to be coincidental rather than a causal relationship. p70S6k Phosphorylation and Proteolytic Suppression by Insulin—Because it has been established that the mTOR signaling pathway is activated by growth factors (19Schmelzie T. Hall M.N. Cell. 2000; 103: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar, 20Raught B. Gingras A.-C. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7037-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), the contribution of this pathway to autophagic regulation by insulin was then tested. As shown in Fig. 4B, insulin mildly induced phosphorylation of p70S6k, and this was blocked by rapamycin. At the same time, the suppression of autophagic proteolysis by insulin was completely blocked by rapamycin, and the proteolytic rate was restored to the control level (Fig. 4A). Moreover, when hepatocytes were incubated with insulin and RegAA together, proteolysis was further suppressed and p70S6k phosphorylation was stimulated additively. This combined effect of insulin and RegAA on the phosphorylation was completely blocked by rapamycin, but the effect on proteolysis was only partially blocked by the reagent (Fig. 4B). These results strongly indicate that insulin uses the mTOR-dependent signaling pathway for autophagic regulation, whereas amino acids use another unknown pathway. Effects of RegAA and Insulin on mTOR Activity in α-Toxin-treated Hepatocytes—While investigating the signaling mechanism of amino acids in autophagic regulation, we observed that micropermeabilization of hepatocytes by Staphylococcal α-toxin completely eliminated their sensitivity to amino acids (35Kadowaki M. Venerando R. Miotto G. Mortimore G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3703-3710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the α-toxin treatment was demonstrated to maintain the autophagic activity of hepatocytes, these semi-intact cells make it possible to examine the responses of proteolysis and mTOR signaling to amino acids and insulin.

Significant hypomethylation of methyl-CpGs in the rRNA promoter was observed in the tumor samples compared with matching normal tissues, which was consistent with the relatively high level of rRNA synthesis in rapidly proliferating tumors. To study the effect of CpG methylation on RNA polymerase I (pol I)-transcribed rRNA genes, we constructed pHrD-IRES-Luc (human rRNA promoter-luciferase reporter). In this plasmid, Kozak sequence of the pGL3-basic vector was replaced by the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of encephalomyocarditis viral genome to optimize pol I-driven reporter gene expression. Transfection of this plasmid into HepG2 (human) cells revealed reduced pol I-driven luciferase activity with an increase in methylation density at the promoter. Markedly reduced luciferase activity in Hepa (mouse) cells compared with HepG2 (human) cells showed that pHrD-IRES-Luc is transcribed by pol I. Site-specific methylation of human rRNA promoter demonstrated that methylation of CpG at the complementary strands located in the promoter (-9, -102, -347 with respect to the +1 site) inhibited luciferase activity, whereas symmetrical methylation of a CpG in the transcribed region (+152) did not affect the promoter activity. Immunofluorescence studies showed that the methyl-CpG-binding proteins, MBD1, MBD2, MBD3, and MeCP2, are localized both in the nuclei and nucleoli of HepG2 cells. Transient overexpression of MBD2 suppressed luciferase activity specifically from the methylated rRNA promoter, whereas MBD1 and MBD3 inhibited rRNA promoter activity irrespective of the methylation status. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed predominant association of MBD2 with the endogenous methylated rRNA promoter, which suggests a selective role for MBD2 in the methylation-mediated inhibition of ribosomal RNA gene expression.

The transcriptional regulation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes is a control point in the complex process of ribosome biogenesis. Diploid somatic cells harbor 300-400 copies of the rRNA genes that code for the most abundant cellular RNA. Only a fraction of these genes is transcribed, which depends on the growth stage of the cells and extracellular stimuli (for a review, see Refs. 1McStay B. Paule M. Schultz M.C. Willis I. Pikaard C.S. Gene Expr. 2002; 10: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar and 2Leary D.J. Huang S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In general, multiple copies of rRNA are found as repeated clusters, usually arranged in a head-to-tail fashion. The core promoter region spanning from -50 to +20 bp with respect to the initiation site is necessary and sufficient for the initiation of basal transcription in most species (for a review, see Refs. 3Jacob S.T. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 4Hannan K.M. Hannan R.D. Rothblum L.I. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 376-398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Grummt I. Prog.

Another key element is the upstream control element (UCE) 1The abbreviations used are: UCE, upstream control element; ETS1, external transcribed spacer region 1; pol I, II, and III, RNA polymerase I, II, and III, respectively; MBD, methyl-CpG-binding protein; DNMT, DNA methyltransferase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; IRES, internal ribosome entry site; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma. that extends 150-200 bp upstream of the transcription start site. Apart from core promoter and UCE, upstream enhancers and terminator also play a critical role in rRNA transcription. Whereas the transcription machineries of RNA polymerase II (pol II) and RNA polymerase III (pol III) are often compatible with genes from widely different species, RNA polymerase I (pol I) exhibits stringent (7Heix J. Grummt I. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) but not absolute (8Ghosh A.K. Niu H. Jacob S.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 890-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) species specificity. This could result from very little sequence similarity between rRNA promoters from different species despite the general conservation of functional transactivation domains of the transcription factors from mice to humans (6Paule M.R. White R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1283-1298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Reeder R.H. Cell. 1984; 38: 349-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Although considerable advances have been made in the identification and characterization of factors that up-regulate rRNA gene expression, the factors controlling its down-regulation have not been fully characterized. Methylation of DNA at the 5-position of cytosine of CpG base pairs, particularly in the promoter region is the predominant epigenetic modification of DNA in mammals and is known to suppress many RNA polymerase II (pol II) genes (10Bird A.P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar, 11Baylin S.B. Esteller M. Rountree M.R. Bachman K.E. Schuebel K. Herman J.G. Hum. Mol.

DNA methylation is essential for development (13Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4574) Google Scholar, 14Jaenisch R. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (4739) Google Scholar). It regulates inactivation of X chromosome in females, genomic imprinting and suppresses spurious transcription from promoters of retroviruses and transposable elements integrated with the genome (15Robertson K.D. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2000; 1: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). In addition, aberrations in DNA methylation cause activation of oncogenes, genomic instability, and silencing of a variety of tumor suppressor genes (e.g. P16, P15, P21, E-CAD, VHL, etc.), leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation (for a review, see Refs. 11Baylin S.B.

Genet. 2002; 11: 2479-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This modification is initiated by de novo DNA methyltransferases (DNMT3A and DNMT3B) and is propagated in successive cell divisions by the maintenance methyltransferase (DNMT1). DNMT1 transfers methyl group from S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) to the newly replicated strand using hemimethylated strand as the template (for a review, see Refs. 18Bestor T.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2395-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar and 19Jeltsch A. ChemBioChem. 2002; 3: 274-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aberrations in DNA methylation lead to a variety of diseases. For example, ICF (immunodeficiency, centromeric instability, and facial anomaly) syndrome is caused by mutations in the DNMT3B gene (20Hansen R.S. Wijmenga C. Luo P. Stanek A.M. Canfield T.K.

The drugs inhibiting DNMT, namely 5-deoxyazacytidine, 5-fluorocytidine, and zebularine, alone or in combination with histone deacetylase inhibitors are used clinically in certain types of cancer to activate methylated tumor suppressor or differentiation-inducing genes (23Zhu W.G. Otterson G.A. Curr. Med. Chem. Anti-cancer Agents. 2003; 3: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 24Cheng J.C. Matsen C.B. Gonzales F.A. Ye W. Greer S. Marquez V.E. Jones P.A. Selker E.U. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2003; 95: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). DNA methylation can impede the transcriptional activity of a pol II gene (25Holliday R. Cancer Surv. 1996; 28: 103-115PubMed Google Scholar) directly by blocking the access of a transcription factor (e.g. AP-2, NF-κB, E2F, and c-MYC) to their cognate sites (19Jeltsch A. ChemBioChem. 2002; 3: 274-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the methylated promoters are, however, recognized by a group of proteins called methyl-CpG-binding proteins (MBDs) by virtue of their conserved methyl-CpG binding domain. Five such MBDs with highly conserved DNA binding domains have been identified (26Hendrich B. Bird A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). Among these proteins, MeCP2, MBD1, MBD2, and MBD4 can bind to methylated DNA. MBD4 is a uracil-DNA glycosylase involved in G-T mismatch repair (12Wade P.A.

Nature. 1999; 401: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). MBDs repress transcription by recruiting a variety of proteins such as Sin3a, histone deacetylases, histone methyltransferases, and HP1α (heterochromatin protein 1α) as co-repressors (for reviews, see Refs. 10Bird A.P.

Kaiso, a partner of β-catenin, lacking the signature methyl CpG binding domain can also bind to methyl-CpGs and repress methylated promoters (30Prokhortchouk A. Hendrich B. Jorgensen H. Ruzov A. Wilm M. Georgiev G. Bird A. Prokhortchouk E. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1613-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). A defect in the functions of these proteins also leads to various abnormalities. Rett syndrome, a prevalent X-linked neurological disorder among Caucasian females, is caused by dominant negative mutations in the MECP2 gene (31Nan X. Bird A. Brain Dev. 2001; 23 (suppl.): S32-S37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Adult MBD1 knock-out mice, like MeCP2 null mice, also exhibit neurological abnormalities (32Zhao X. Ueba T. Christie B.R. Barkho B. McConnell M.J. Nakashima K. Lein E.S. Eadie B.D. Willhoite A.R. Muotri A.R. Summers R.G. Chun J. Lee K.F. Gage F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6777-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), whereas MBD4 null mice are susceptible to cancer because of enhanced CpG to TpG mutation in their genome (33Millar C.B. Guy J.

Most of the studies to date have focused on the up-regulation of rRNA promoter activity. Since methylation of DNA, particularly the promoter region, is known to silence many pol II genes (23Zhu W.G. Otterson G.A. Curr. Med. Chem. Anti-cancer Agents. 2003; 3: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 24Cheng J.C. Matsen C.B. Gonzales F.A. Ye W. Greer S. Marquez V.E. Jones P.A.

Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar), it was of interest to investigate whether the methylation status of rRNA promoter modifies pol I-directed rRNA transcription. In the present study, we explored the methylation status of the CpG island that spans the rRNA promoter in human primary hepatocellular carcinomas and corresponding normal liver tissues and elucidated a potential molecular mechanism for the methylation-mediated alteration in rRNA promoter activity in human cells. pIRES-Luc—The internal ribosome entry site (IRES; 16-518 bp) was amplified from pCITE vector (Novagen) using T3 (5′-AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGG-3′) and T7 (5′-GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′) oligonucleotides and digested with NcoI to generate the 503-bp IRES product. The Kozak sequence ((GCC)GCCRCCATGG, where R represents a purine) that directs translation of pol II-transcribed mRNAs was removed from pGL3-basic vector by digestion with NcoI and HindIII and was replaced by the amplified IRES fragment to generate the plasmid pIRES-Luc. The replacement of the Kozak sequence with IRES was essential to minimize pol II-directed spurious expression from human rRNA promoter-luciferase reporter constructs in transfected cells. Human rRNA-luciferase Vector (pHrD-IRES-Luc)—Human rRNA promoter spanning -410 to +314 bp (accession number K01105) with respect to the transcription initiation site was amplified from ∼2-kb fragments of HeLa genomic DNA digested with EcoRI. The following primer pairs with KpnI (forward) and BglII (reverse) restriction sites at the 5′ ends were used for PCR: forward, 5′-gtggtacccCGCGATCCTTTCTGGAGAGTCCC-3′; reverse, 5′-ggagatctGACGAGAACGCCTGACACGCAC-3′. The annealing temperature was 58 °C. The resultant 730-bp PCR product was treated with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) to polish the ends following the manufacturer's protocol, digested with KpnI and BglII, and cloned into the same sites of pIRES-Luc to generate pHrD-IRES-Luc. Expression Vectors for MBD1, MBD2, MBD3, and MeCP2—These plasmids were constructed in mammalian expression vectors pcDNA 3.1(+/-) (Invitrogen) to obtain pcMBD1, pcMBD2, pcMBD3, pcMBD4, and pcMeCP2. Briefly, rat MeCP2 cDNA in pBlueScript-SK(-) (a generous gift from Adrian Bird) was digested with NotI-EcoRV enzymes, and the resultant ∼1.8-kb fragment was cloned into the same sites in pcDNA3.1(-) to generate pcMeCP2. Similarly, human MBD1 cDNA from pET6H (a generous gift from Adrian Bird) was excised with NcoI, and the sticky 5′-end of the ∼2-kb insert fragment was filled in with dNTPs catalyzed by Klenow and cloned in the EcoRV site of pcDNA3.1(-). Amplification with the vector- and insert-specific primers determined the correct orientation of MBD1. The mouse MBD2 cDNA in pBSK vector (a generous gift from Brian Hendrich) was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and ligated to the same sites in pcDNA3.1(-) to generate the mammalian expression vector. MBD3 cDNA was amplified from a mouse cDNA library and ligated to BamHI-HindIII sites of pcDNA3.1(-) to generate the plasmid pcMBD3. HepG2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. For transfection assay, 2.5 × 105 cells were plated onto 60-mm dishes 24 h prior to transfection and then transfected using calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (34Ghosh A.K. Kermekchiev M. Jacob S.T. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 141: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 35Majumder S. Ghoshal K. Gronostajski R.M. Jacob S.T. Gene Expr. 2001; 9: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Unless mentioned otherwise, each transfection mixture contains a maximum of 8.8 μg of total plasmid DNA that includes the reporter plasmid (0.5-1.0 μg), pRLTK (Renilla luciferase reporter driven by HSV-tk promoter (Promega)) (50 ng), as an internal control and the eukaryotic expression vectors (4 μg) harboring the gene of interest in a total volume of 500 μl. Briefly, DNA was dissolved in 220 μl of 0.1× TE (1 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) and mixed with 250 μl of 2× Hepes-buffered saline (280 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm Na2HPO4, 12 mm dextrose, and 50 mm HEPES). Next, 31 μl of 2 m CaCl2 was added slowly to the DNA mixture and incubated for 20 min at room temperature before adding to the cell culture. The cells were allowed to incubate with the transfection reagent in complete medium for 16 h at 37 °C, followed by replacement with fresh medium. After 24-48 h in the fresh medium, the cells were harvested in the lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase activity was measured using the Dual Luciferase Assay kit (Promega) in a Luminometer (Lumat LB 9507; EG&G Berthold, Oak Ridge, TN). Genomic DNA isolated form hepatocellular carcinomas and matching liver tissues from the same individuals were treated with sodium bisulfite according to the protocol optimized in our laboratory (36Majumder S. Ghoshal K. Li Z. Jacob S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28584-28589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 37Ghoshal K. Datta J. Majumder S. Bai S. Dong X. Parthun M. Jacob S.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 8302-8319Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The rRNA promoter spanning -377 to +51 bp was amplified using two sets of nested primers from the bisulfite-treated DNA. The primers used were as follows: hrRNA BF1, 5′-AATTTTTTTGGAGAGTTTTCGTG-3′; hrRNA BR1, 5′-GAGTCGGAGAGCGTTTTTTGAG-3′. The annealing temperature used was 50 °C. The nested primers were hrRNA BF2 (5′-GAGTCGGAGAGCGTTTTTTGAG-3′) and hrRNA BR2 (5′-CATCCGAAAACCCAACCTCTCCAA-3′). The annealing temperature was 55 °C. To confirm complete conversion of unmethylated cytosines to uracils, the PCR products were digested with TaqI, the restriction sites of which were generated only after bisulfite conversion. Completely converted PCR products were then cloned into TA cloning vector (Invitrogen). Ten clones selected at random from each DNA were sequenced in automated DNA sequencer. The KpnI-BglII fragment of pHrD-IRES-Luc was methylated with M.SssI methylase (New England Biolabs) or with M.HhaI methylase (New England Biolabs) in the presence (methylated) or absence (mock-methylated) of 160 μm AdoMet in a manufacturer-supplied buffer at 37 °C for 4 h. An additional 10 units of enzyme and AdoMet were added to the same mixture, and the methylation reaction was continued for an additional 4 h. The completion of the methylation reaction was determined by digestion of the fragment with BstUI, HpaII, or HhaI for M.SssI, M.HpaII, and M.HhaI methylases, respectively. These enzymes cannot cleave DNA if their cognate restriction sites are methylated. The methylated promoter fragment was then ligated to the same sites of pIRES-Luc. The ligated plasmid was separated on an agarose gel and purified using a gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Before transfection, the concentrations of methylated and mock-methylated plasmids were measured in a Beckman spectrophotometer at 260 nm. Site-specific methylation was carried out following the methodology used for site-directed mutagenesis with some modifications. Single-stranded DNA was obtained by infection of XL1-blue-MRF′ bacteria harboring HrDNA plasmid with helper phage (R408; Stratagene). In a typical reaction, positive strand HrD-Luc plasmid (∼0.05 pmol) was annealed to 1.25 pmol of phosphorylated oligonucleotides (with a specific CpG either methylated denoted as “M” oligonucleotide or unmethylated control, depicted as “C” oligonucleotide) spanning different regions of the rRNA promoter or external transcribed spacer (external transcribed spacer region 1; ETS1). The annealing mixture (20 μl) contained 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm NaCl. The reaction was carried out in a thermocycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) programmed for a 5-min incubation at 96 °C followed by a slow descent (with a ramp of 3 min/degree Celsius) to 66 °C (annealing temperature of the oligonucleotide) and a 1-h incubation at 66 °C. Annealed oligonucleotide was then extended and ligated in a reaction mixture comprising 3 μl of 10× synthesis buffer (100 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm dNTPs, 10 mm ATP, and 20 mm dithiothreitol), 5 units of T4 DNA polymerase, and 1 unit of T4 DNA ligase in a total volume of 30 μl and was incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. The circularized plasmids were pooled, precipitated, and ligated overnight at 16 °C with a high concentration (10 units/μl) ligase (Invitrogen) in 10 μl of ligation mixture. These hemimethylated plasmids were methylated at the complementary CpG base pair with AdoMet catalyzed by DNMT1 (New England Biolabs) at 37 °C. Methylated (with AdoMet) or mock-methylated (without AdoMet), ligated plasmids were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified using gel extraction kit (Qiagen), and concentration was measured at 260 nm. Oligonucleotides used for site-specific methylation were C(-347) (5′-CGGCCAGGCCGCGACCTCTC-3′), M(-347) (5′-CGGCCAGGmCGCGACCTCTC-3′), C(-102) (5′-GCGCGACACGGACACCTGT-3′), M(-102) (5′-GCGCGACAmCGGACACCTGT-3′), C(-9) (5′-TCAGCAATAACCCGGCGGCC-3′), M(-9) (5′-TCAGCAATAACCmCGGCGGCC-3′), C(+152) (5′-CGGGAGTCGGGACGCTCGGA-3′), and M(+152) (5′-CGGGAGTCGGGACGCTmCGGA-3′). Methylation at the respective sites were confirmed by sequencing the bisulfite-converted plasmids with the primers 5′-TGTGTGGAGTTGGAGAGTG-3′ and 5′-TTGGGGTTGATTAGAGGG-3′ (for the positive strand) and 5′-CCCTCCTACAACCAAAAC-3′ and 5′-TGTGTGGTTGTGATGGTG-3′ (for the negative strand). Whole cell extract (200 μg) prepared from HepG2 cells overexpressing different MBDs were separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and blocked in 5% milk in Tris-buffered (pH 7.5) saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST). For detection of the overexpressed proteins, the membrane was subjected to immunoblot analysis with the respective antisera (37Ghoshal K. Datta J. Majumder S. Bai S. Dong X. Parthun M. Jacob S.T.

The antigen-antibody complex was detected using the ECL™ kit (Amersham Biosciences), following the manufacturer's protocol. HepG2 cells at a density of 2.5 × 106 were plated on 150-mm tissue culture dish 24 h prior to the cross-linking. These cells were treated with formaldehyde (1%, final concentration) at 37 °C for 15 min to cross-link proteins to DNA. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 125 mm glycine. Soluble chromatin with an average size of 600-1000 bp was prepared following the protocol of Weinmann et al. (39Weinmann A.S. Bartley S.M. Zhang T. Zhang M.Q. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 6820-6832Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). For chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, antisera raised against the methyl binding proteins MBD1, MBD3, and MeCP2 in our laboratory were used (37Ghoshal K. Datta J. Majumder S. Bai S. Dong X. Parthun M. Jacob S.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 8302-8319Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Anti-MBD2 antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The chromatin was first precleared with preimmune sera coupled to protein A and protein G beads, followed by overnight incubation with preimmune or immune sera. The immune complex was then captured by protein G (for anti-MBD2) and protein A (for all other antibodies) beads, washed extensively as described (37Ghoshal K. Datta J. Majumder S. Bai S. Dong X.

Immunoprecipitated DNA-protein complex was eluted, decrosslinked, treated with RNase A and proteinase K, and purified as described (37Ghoshal K. Datta J. Majumder S. Bai S. Dong X. Parthun M. Jacob S.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 8302-8319Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated as well as the input DNA was digested with HpaII or MspI, and the digests along with an equal amount of the undigested immunoprecipitated DNA were amplified using the radiolabeled primers specific for the human rRNA promoter region: HrDChIP-F (5′-CTGCGATGGTGGCGTTTTTG-3′) and HrDCh-IP-R (5′-ACAGCGTGTCAGCAATAACC-3′). The primers used for the GAPDH promoter (accession number AY340484) are GAPDH-F (5′-GTGCCCAGTTGAACCAG-3′) and GAPDH-R (5′-AACAGGAGGAGCAGAGAGCGAAGC-3′). The annealing temperatures for rRNA and GAPDH primers were 58 and 60 °C, respectively. The sizes of the PCR products for rRNA and GAPDH are 152 and 223 bp, respectively. The amplicons were run on polyacrylamide gels (6% acrylamide), and the dried gels were subjected to autoradiography and PhosphorImager analysis. 32P-labeled PCR products were quantified using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences), and results were depicted as the ratio of methylated and unmethylated DNA precipitated with the antibodies to the input methylated and unmethylated DNA, respectively. HepG2 cells were grown overnight on Labtek chamber slides (2 × 104 cells/chamber). Cells were fixed with 1:1 methanol and acetone mixture for 15 min at 4 °C, washed with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Next the cells were incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h to block nonspecific binding. Blocked chambers were subsequently washed and incubated overnight at 4 °C with a mixture of anti-nucleolin monoclonal antibody (anti-C23) and antibodies raised against recombinant MBD1, MBD3, and MeCP2 in our laboratory or MBD2 (Upstate Biotechnology). MBD1, MBD3, and MeCP2 antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:500 in PBS, whereas MBD2 antibody was used at a dilution of 1:20. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit (for MBD1, MBD3, and MeCP2) and anti-sheep (for MBD2) were used for green channel detection, whereas monoclonal anti-C23 antibody was detected by TRITC-conjugated monoclonal anti-mouse antibody (Sigma) for detection in the red channel. Nuclei were stained using 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole in the mounting fluid. Ribosomal RNA Promoter Is Hypomethylated in Human Hepatocellular Carcinomas—The sequence analysis of rRNA transcriptional initiation region of the human rRNA gene showed that it is highly enriched in CpG and that the promoter harbors a CpG island encompassing 19 CpGs in the upstream control element (UCE) and six CpGs in the core promoter regions. On the other hand, the mouse and rat rRNA promoters contain only one and five CpGs, respectively (Fig. 1A). Most of the CpG islands of housekeeping genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II are located in the promoter and exon 1 regions that are methylation-free in normal somatic cells. Although ribosomal RNA genes are housekeeping genes, they are highly reiterated, and only a fraction of these genes is transcribed by pol I. Therefore, we sought to investigate the methylation status of each CpG within different cis elements (spanning from -200 to -9 bp) in the rRNA promoter in human livers and their potential alterations in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). To determine the methylation status of individual CpGs in the human rRNA promoter region, we performed bisulfite genomic sequ"

Simultaneous detection by UV absorbance and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) provides important structural information on the oligosaccharide components of this mixture. Highly sensitive and easily interpretable spectra were obtained through post-column addition of tributylamine in acetonitrile. High resolution mass spectrometry afforded elemental composition of many known and previously unknown heparin-derived oligosaccharides. UV in combination with MS detection led to the identification of oligosaccharides arising from the original non-reducing end (NRE) of the heparin chain. The structural identification of these oligosaccharides provided sequence from a reading frame that begins at the non-reducing terminus of the heparin chain. Interestingly, 16 NRE oligosaccharides are observed, having both an even and an odd number of saccharide residues, most of which are not predicted based on biosynthesis or known pathways of heparin catabolism. Quantification of these NRE oligosaccharides afforded a number-averaged molecular weight consistent with that expected for the pharmaceutical heparin used in this analysis. Molecular ions could be assigned for oligosaccharides as large as a tetradecasaccharide, having a mass of 4625 Da and a net charge of –32.

A successful combination of detection, separation, and spectral techniques might provide a critical advantage in understanding GAG structure.NMR spectroscopy is an invaluable tool for the structural elucidation of GAGs, affording saccharide composition, ring conformation, glycosidic linkage, and sulfation patterns (17.Pervin A. Gallo C. Jandik K.A. Han X.J. Linhardt R.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 18.Yang H.O. Gunay N.S. Toida T. Kuberan B. Yu G.L. Kim Y.S. Linhardt R.J.

Unfortunately, this technique is limited by the requirement of relatively large amounts (10 nmol to 1 μmol) of pure oligosaccharide sample. Mass spectrometry (MS) is another powerful technique for structural elucidation of GAGs. Soft ionization methods, including electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI), have been amazingly successful in the analysis of neutral oligosaccharides and their peptide and lipid conjugates (28.Peter-Katalinic J. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 1994; 13: 77-98Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 29.Fura A. Leary J.A. Anal. Chem. 1993; 65: 2805-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 30.Reinhold V.N.

A. 1996; 720: 429-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The analysis of polyanionic GAG-oligosaccharides, such as those derived from heparin and heparan sulfate, is still in its infancy (28.Peter-Katalinic J. Mass Spectrom.

Res. 1993; 244: 205-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).MS studies have focused on the analysis of oligosaccharides prepared through the controlled enzymatic depolymerization of polysaccharides. MALDI time-of-flight (TOF) MS (19.Juhasz P. Biemann K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4333-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 26.Shriver Z. Raman R. Venkataraman G.

Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 719-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) have been the most favored approaches for the analysis of GAG-derived oligosaccharides. Both ESI-MS and MALDI-TOF-MS enjoy particular advantages in the analysis of large polar macromolecules. In MALDI, the major ion formed is typically the singly charged species, making MALDI-TOF-MS well suited to the analysis of mixtures. However, the ion yield depends on the chemical nature and size of the analyte, and MALDI is sufficiently energetic to damage the analyte. In contrast, ESI-MS utilizes a flowing stream containing the analyte, provides for very gentle ionization, and can be easily combined with on-line liquid-phase separation techniques, such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary electrophoresis.True molecular weight distributions of polysaccharides are difficult to measure by MS because of their polydispersity (P = MW/MN > 1). MALDI-TOF analysis of synthetic polymers, which are in many respects similar to polysaccharides (e.g. polydisperse, long-chain oligomers with distinct repeating units), cannot provide accurate molecular weight distributions of polymers with P > 1.2 (35.Monstaudo G. Montaudo M.S. Puglisi C. Samperi F. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 9: 453-462Crossref Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 36.Jackson C. Larsen B. McEwen C. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1303-1308Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Prior fractionation is required to simplify these polydisperse mixtures prior to MALDI-TOF (37.Deery M.J. Stimson E. Chappell C.G. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 15: 2273-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 38.Yeung B. Mareeak D. J. Chromatogr. A. 1999; 852: 573-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). On-line LC/ESI-MS eliminates time-consuming fraction collection, associated with such off-line MALDI-TOF analysis (24.Zaia J. McClellan J.E. Costello C.E. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 6030-6039Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 25.Zaia J. Costello C.E. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). MALDI-TOF MS has also been used to determine the sequences of purified GAG-derived oligosaccharides through ion-pairing with a basic peptide and determining the mass of the peptide-oligosaccharide complex (26.Shriver Z. Raman R. Venkataraman G. Drummond K. Turnbull J. Toida T. Linhardt R.J. Biemann K. Sasisekharan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10365-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 39.Venkataraman G. Shriver Z. Raman R. Sasisekharan R. Science. 1999; 286: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). By combining controlled enzymatic or chemical depolymerization with MALDI-TOF-MS analysis of such complexes, it is possible to deduce oligosaccharide sequence (26.Shriver Z. Raman R. Venkataraman G. Drummond K. Turnbull J. Toida T. Linhardt R.J. Biemann K. Sasisekharan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10365-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 39.Venkataraman G. Shriver Z. Raman R. Sasisekharan R. Science. 1999; 286: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar).ESI-MS analysis of GAG-derived oligosaccharides is particularly promising due to the relative soft ionization technique that electrospray offers (20.Chai W.G. Luo J.L. Lim C.K. Lawson A.M. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 2060-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 23.Siegel M.M. Tabei K. Kagan M.Z. Vlahov I.R. Hileman R.E. Linhardt R.J. J.

Chisena C. Cysyk R.L. Carbohydr. Res. 1997; 303: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). On-line LC/MS also greatly enhances the analysis of complex mixtures of GAG-derived oligosaccharides. Strong anion exchange-HPLC conventionally used to fractionate GAG-derived oligosaccharide mixtures (16.Rice K.G. Kim Y.S. Grant A.C. Merchant Z.M. Linhardt R.J. Anal. Chem. 1985; 150: 325-331Google Scholar, 41.Mohsin S.B. J. Chromatogr. A. 2000; 884: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) is difficult to interface with MS due to the high ionic strength mobile phases required to elute multiply charged oligosaccharides. Reversed-phase ion-pairing (RPIP)-HPLC, relying on tetraalkyl ammonium salts, provides excellent chromatographic resolution; however, these ion-pairing reagents are non-volatile and are required at high concentrations, making them incompatible with ESI-MS. Volatile ion-pairing reagents (42.Guan F. Isii A. Seno H. Watanabe-Suzuki K. Kumazuwa T. Suzuki O. J. Chromatogr. B. 1999; 731: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 43.Storm T. Reemtsma T. Jekel M. J. Chromatogr. A. 1999; 854: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), post-column removal of ion-pairing reagent with an in-line membrane (44.Conboy J.J. Henion J.D. Martin M.W. Zweigenbaum J.A. Anal. Chem. 1990; 62: 800-807Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar), post-column addition of sheath liquid, and the splitting of the eluent flow (45.Witters E. Van Donger W. Esmans E.L. Van Onckelen H.A. J. Chromatogr. B. 1997; 694: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) have all been used to overcome these problems. Recently, heparosan (an unsulfated, carboxyl-containing heparin analog) oligosaccharides have been successfully analyzed by RPIP-HPLC/ESI-MS (46.Kuberan B. Lech M. Zhang L. Wu Z.L. Beeler D.L. Rosenberg R.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 8707-8718Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This method, however, has not been applied to large and highly sulfated oligosaccharides. The present study applies RPIP-HPLC/ESI-MS to the analysis of highly charged heparin-derived oligosaccharides to obtain both molecular weight and sequence information on the present heparin polymer.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Bovine lung heparin, sodium salt (≥140 USP units/mg, 500,000 units) was from Sigma. Heparinase (heparin lyase I, EC 4.2.2.7) was from IBEX (Montreal, Canada). Acetonitrile, HPLC-grade, and all other chemicals, of the purest grade available, were obtained from Aldrich. Ultrapure water was obtained using a Milli-Q system (Millipore, Billerica, MA).Preparation of Heparin Oligosaccharide Mixtures—The heparin oligosaccharide mixture was prepared from bovine lung heparin by controlled enzymatic depolymerization with heparinase as described previously (17.Pervin A. Gallo C. Jandik K.A. Han X.J. Linhardt R.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 mg of heparin was digested with 0.2 milliunits of heparinase (EC 4.2.2.7) in 200 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) at 30 °C. The reaction mixture was incubated until the digestion was 30% complete, and then the mixture was boiled at 100 °C for 2 min to inactivate the enzyme. The mixture was freeze-dried and redissolved in 100 μl of double distilled water.Chromatographic Conditions—HPLC separations were performed on a5-μm Discovery C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm) from Supelco (Bellefonte, PA). Eluent A was water/acetonitrile (80:20), and eluent B was water/acetonitrile (35:65). Tributylamine (15 mm) and ammonium acetate (50 mm) were added to both eluents. The mobile phase pH was adjusted to 7.0 with acetic acid. The sample (20 μl, 10 mg/ml) was injected, and a linear gradient (from 0 to 100% eluent B in 120 min) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min was used for elution.Off-line UV-LC measurements were performed using a Shimadzu HPLC system consisting of two Shimadzu LC-10Ai pumps and a Shimadzu UV-visible spectrophotometric detector (Model SPD-10A). The elution profiles were monitored by absorbance at 232 nm at 0.02 absorbance units at full scale. On-line HPLC measurements were carried out on an Agilent 1100 series pumping system (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) consisting of a G1312A binary gradient pump, a G1322A vacuum degasser, a G1367A well plater sampler, and a GB65B multiple wave-length UV/VIS detector.Mass Spectrometric Conditions—ESI mass spectra were obtained using an Agilent 1100 series Classic G2445A LC/MSD trap (Agilent Technologies, Inc.). Optimization was performed by direct injection (6 μl/min, 1 mg/ml) of trisulfated heparin disaccharide (Fig. 1, n = 0) with mobile phase A at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The electrospray interface was set in negative ionization mode with the skimmer potential –19.7 V, capillary exit –48.4 V, and a source of temperature of 350 °C to obtain maximum abundance of the standard disaccharide ions in full scan spectra (200–2200 Da, 10 full scans/s). Nitrogen was used as a drying (12 liters/min) and nebulizing gas (60 p.s.i.). Total ion chromatograms and mass spectra were processed using Agilent Chemstation A.07. Software versions were as follows: 4.0 LC/MSD trap control 5.0 and Data Analysis 2.0 (Agilent Technologies, Inc.). Monoisotopic masses are reported throughout the text. For MS simplification experiments, the post-column addition reagents were (optimally 5 mm tributylammonium acetate (TrBA) in CH3CN) directly infused into the ESI source using an Agilent syringe pump at flow rate of 6 μl/min. Both the sample and the post-column addition reagent were sprayed at the same time to ensure in-source mixing.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONHeparin (and heparan sulfate) are structurally diverse, high molecular weight (MWavg > 10,000), polydisperse (P ≈ 1.1–1.4) mixtures (9.Linhardt R.J. Toida T. Witczak Z.B. Nieforth K.A. Carbohydrates as Drugs. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1997: 277-341Google Scholar, 47.Edens R.E. Al-Hakim A. Weiler J.M. Rethwisch D.G. Fareed J. Linhardt R.J. J. Pharm. Sci. 1992; 81: 823-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Heparinase is used in reducing the molecular weight of this mixture to prepare low molecular weight heparins (8.Linhardt R.J. Gunay N.S. Sem. Thromb. Hemost. 1999; 25: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and to facilitate the isolation and purification of specific heparin oligosaccharide components, through tedious and repetitive chromatography (10.Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Weiler J.M. Linhardt R.J. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 156-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Bovine lung heparin was selected as the starting material in this study as it has a reduced structural complexity, when compared with porcine intestinal heparin, because of its relatively high proportion of trisulfated disaccharide sequences of the structure →4) 2-O-sulfo-α-l-idopyranosuronic acid (1→4) 2-deoxy-2-sulfamido-6-O-sulfo-α-d-glucopyranose (1→ [→4) α-l-IdoAp2S (1→4) α-d-GlcNpS6S (1→] (10.Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Weiler J.M. Linhardt R.J. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 156-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Controlled, partial (30%), heparinase-catalyzed depolymerization yielded a mixture comprised primarily of oligosaccharides ranging from disaccharide (degree of polymerization (dp) 2) to oligosaccharides larger than tetradecasaccharide (dp14) as confirmed by size exclusion chromatography and gradient PAGE (17.Pervin A. Gallo C. Jandik K.A. Han X.J. Linhardt R.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 47.Edens R.E. Al-Hakim A. Weiler J.M. Rethwisch D.G. Fareed J. Linhardt R.J. J. Pharm. Sci. 1992; 81: 823-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) (data not shown). This oligosaccharide mixture is known to contain oligosaccharides having primarily an even number of saccharide residues. Furthermore, one oligosaccharide sequence predominates (Fig. 1), and disaccharides (dp2) through tetradecasaccharides (dp14) have been purified from this mixture and characterized by multidimensional NMR spectroscopy (17.Pervin A. Gallo C. Jandik K.A. Han X.J. Linhardt R.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar).Extensive experiments were undertaken to optimize the HPLC separation of both small (dp2–dp6) and large (dp10–dp14) heparin-derived oligosaccharides (48.Thanawiroon C. Linhardt R.J. J. Chromatogr. A. 2003; 1014: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). RPIP-HPLC used an MS-friendly mobile phase including: volatile ion-pairing reagents, tributylamine; volatile inorganic salt, ammonium acetate; and an organic modifier, acetonitrile. The choice of volatile ion-pairing reagent represents a compromise between low alkyl chain length affording high volatility, required for compatibility with on-line MS and longer alkyl chain length affording higher on-column retention of heparin-derived oligosaccharides associated with enhanced resolution (48.Thanawiroon C. Linhardt R.J. J. Chromatogr. A. 2003; 1014: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). TrBA provided optimal retention with MS compatibility. Organic cosolvent, solvent pH, temperature, gradient profiles of volatile inorganic salt, and various ion-pairing reagents were first optimized, in off-line RPIP-HPLC using UV detection, to obtain efficient oligosaccharide separation (48.Thanawiroon C. Linhardt R.J. J. Chromatogr. A. 2003; 1014: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Ammonium formate and ammonium acetate gradients gave low peak intensities and complicated spectra due to ion suppression. RPIP-HPLC utilizing an acetonitrile gradient at a fixed concentration of ammonium acetate (50 mm), pH 7.0, and TrBA (15 mm) afforded both high chromatographic resolution and excellent MS analyses (Fig. 2).Fig. 2RPIP-HPLC separation of heparin oligosaccharides obtained from controlled (30%) heparinase depolymerization of bovine lung heparin. A total ion chromatogram using negative ESI-MS detection (upper trace) with peaks numbered and a UV chromatogram at 232 nm (lower trace) with dp of peaks corresponding to the oligosaccharides in Fig. 1 are shown.

The removal of cations has been successfully applied to the ESI-MS analysis of the DNA polyanion, affording spectra with predominantly singly charged ions closely resembling the simpler spectra obtained using MALDI-MS (49.Cai J.

In DNA analysis, post-column addition of organic solvent, ion-pairing reagent, and organic acids and organic bases, as a sheath liquid directly within the ion source, decreases the surface tension and increases the volatility of the electrosprayed solution, simplifying the mass spectra (49.Cai J. Henion J.D. J. Chromatogr. A. 1995; 703: 667-692Crossref Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 50.Huber C.G. Krajete A. J. Chromatogr.

Mass Spectrom. 1997; 8: 155-160Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar).In the analysis of heparin-derived oligosaccharides, we also expected to observe a reduction in charge states from added acids (formic acid, acetic acid) and bases (ammonium hydroxide, piperidine, and imidazole) by influencing the proton transfer reactions, simplifying spectral complexity, and enhancing peak intensity. The addition of CH3CN as sheath liquid resulted in improvement in ion intensity and the substantial spectral simplification, possibly by weakening of the solventsolute and ion-counter-ion interactions and the subsequent release of free analyte ions to the evaporation process. The most intense ion peaks of each oligosaccharide caused by cation adduction are always associated with the TrBA adduct. The post-column addition of a low concentration (5 mm) of TrBA ion-pairing reagent in acetonitrile provided the most simplified spectra, suppressing the Na+/NH4+ adduct"
https://openalex.org/W2143944135,"Heat shock transcription factor (HSF) is an evolutionarily conserved protein that mediates eukaryotic transcriptional responses to stress. Although the mammalian stress-responsive HSF1 isoform is activated in response to a wide array of seemingly unrelated stresses, including heat shock, pharmacological agents, infection and inflammation, little is known about the precise mechanisms or pathways by which this factor is activated by many stressors. The baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a single HSF protein that responds to heat stress and glucose starvation and provides a simple model system to investigate how a single HSF is activated by multiple stresses. Although induction of the HSF target gene CUP1 by glucose starvation is dependent on the Snf1 kinase, HSF-dependent heat shock induction of CUP1 is Snf1-independent. Approximately 165 in vivo targets for HSF have been identified in S. cerevisiae using chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with DNA microarrays. Interestingly, ∼30% of the HSF direct target genes are also induced by the diauxic shift, in which glucose levels begin to be depleted. We demonstrate that HSF and Snf1 kinase interact in vivo and that HSF is a direct substrate for phosphorylation by Snf1 kinase in vitro. Furthermore, glucose starvation-dependent, but not heat shock-dependent HSF phosphorylation, and enhanced chromosomal HSF DNA binding to low affinity target promoters such as SSA3 and HSP30, occurred in a Snf1-dependent manner. Consistent with a more global role for HSF and Snf1 in activating gene expression in response to changes in glucose availability, expression of a subset of HSF targets by glucose starvation was dependent on Snf1 and the HSF carboxyl-terminal activation domain.

Heat shock transcription factors (HSF) 1The abbreviations used are: HSFheat shock transcription factorHspheat shock proteinHSEheat shock elementSCsynthetic complete mediumGSTglutathione S-transferasePKAprotein kinase ACTAC-terminal activation domainNTAamino-terminal activation domainChIPchromosomal immunoprecipitation.1The abbreviations used are: HSFheat shock transcription factorHspheat shock proteinHSEheat shock elementSCsynthetic complete mediumGSTglutathione S-transferasePKAprotein kinase ACTAC-terminal activation domainNTAamino-terminal activation domainChIPchromosomal immunoprecipitation. play a central role in cellular homeostasis in response to a variety of stress conditions by activating gene expression. To date, most of the known HSF-regulated genes encode heat shock proteins (Hsps), which predominantly comprise molecular chaperones involved in protein folding, stabilization, activation, trafficking, and degradation (1Morimoto R.I. Tissiáeres A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor monograph series; 26, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1994Google Scholar). The overall fundamental structure of HSF and its consensus binding site, the heat shock element (HSE) are conserved from yeast to humans (2Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar, 3Littlefield O. Nelson H.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 464-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Although yeast and Drosophila have a single gene encoding HSF, plants and mammals harbor multiple genes encoding HSF isoforms; for example Arabidopsis thaliana possesses 21 distinct HSF genes and mammals have three genes encoding the HSF isoforms, HSF1, HSF2, and HSF4 (4Nover L. Bharti K. Doring P. Mishra S.K. Ganguli A. Scharf K.D. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2001; 6: 177-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Pirkkala L. Nykanen P. Sistonen L.

HSF1, the stress-responsive mammalian HSF isoform, is activated by a wide variety of stresses that include heat shock, oxidative stress, heavy metals, infection and inflammation, and pharmacological reagents (6Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar). In the absence of severe stress, HSF1 exists largely as an inactive monomer in the cytosol, where repressive interactions with Hsp70, Hsp90, and other co-chaperones occur. Activation of HSF1 involves multiple steps, including homotrimerization, nuclear accumulation, DNA binding, and target gene transactivation (2Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar, 5Pirkkala L. Nykanen P. Sistonen L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1118-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar, 6Morimoto R.I.

Although the mechanisms by which many diverse stresses activate HSF1 are not well understood, it has been shown that the function of redox-sensitive cysteine residues, within and adjacent to the DNA binding domain, are required to induce trimerization of HSF1 by heat shock and oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo (8Ahn S.G. Thiele D.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 516-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Because HSF1 is phosphorylated under normal conditions, and undergoes hyperphosphorylation in response to stress, it has been suggested that phosphorylation plays an important role in regulating HSF1 trans-activation activity. Several distinct protein kinases, and their cognate HSF1 phosphorylation sites, have been identified and suggested to play both positive and negative roles in HSF1 function and regulation (5Pirkkala L. Nykanen P. Sistonen L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1118-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar, 6Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar, 7Morano K.A.

Sci. 2002; 27: 619-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Although initial studies suggested that yeast HSF, which is essential for cell survival, is constitutively trimerized and bound to HSEs (10Sorger P.K. Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R. Nature. 1987; 329: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 11Jakobsen B.K. Pelham H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5040-5042Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), other studies demonstrated both constitutive and heat-inducible binding of HSF to specific HSEs in the HSP82 promoter (12Giardina C. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2737-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 13Erkine A.M. Magrogan S.F. Sekinger E.A. Gross D.S. Mol. Cell.

Moreover, recent identification of genome-wide Saccharomyces cerevisiae HSF targets by chromatin immunoprecipitation, combined with DNA microarray analysis, demonstrated global heat-stimulated binding of HSF to many target genes. 2J.-S. Hahn, Z. Hu, D. J. Thiele, and V. R. Iyer, submitted for publication.2J.-S. Hahn, Z. Hu, D. J. Thiele, and V. R. Iyer, submitted for publication. Furthermore, similar to mammalian HSF1, yeast HSF is activated by multiple stresses, including heat shock, oxidative stress, and glucose starvation (16Liu X.D. Thiele D.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 592-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 17Tamai K.T. Liu X. Silar P. Sosinowski T. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell.

S. cerevisiae HSF has also been shown to be hyperphosphorylated in response to stress, and it has been demonstrated that heat shock and the superoxide-generating agent menadione induce distinct patterns of HSF phosphorylation (16Liu X.D. Thiele D.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 592-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The correlation between the kinetics of HSF phosphorylation and that of expression of one of the HSF target genes, CUP1, suggested that HSF activity might be regulated by differential phosphorylation under different stress conditions (16Liu X.D. Thiele D.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 592-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). On the other hand, phosphorylation of a heptapeptide region (CE2) of the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis HSF has been suggested to be involved in restraining HSF in an inactive state (19Hoj A. Jakobsen B.K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2617-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Currently, no protein kinase has been identified which both phosphorylates yeast HSF and has been shown to be essential for HSF activity. We previously demonstrated that Snf1 kinase, and its associated activation subunit Snf4, are required for the glucose starvation-induced, HSF-dependent activation of the CUP1 metallothionein gene in S. cerevisiae (17Tamai K.T. Liu X. Silar P. Sosinowski T. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8155-8165Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Snf1 kinase, a homologue of mammalian AMP-activated kinase, plays a central role in regulating cellular metabolism under low glucose conditions by controlling gene expression, as well as by the regulation of metabolic enzymes (20Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar, 21Carlson M. Curr. Opin.

Snf1 kinase forms a complex with an activating subunit Snf4, and one of the three Snf1-interacting proteins Sip1, Sip2, or Gal83, which target Snf1 to distinct subcellular locations (23Jiang R. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2099-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 24Vincent O. Townley R. Kuchin S. Carlson M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1104-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Regulation of Snf1 activity involves phosphorylation of Snf1 on the activation loop by three upstream kinases (25Nath N. McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3909-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 26Sutherland C.M. Hawley S.A. McCartney R.R. Leech A. Stark M.J. Schmidt M.C. Hardie D.G.

A. 2003; 100: 8839-8843Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), and binding of Snf4 to the Snf1 regulatory domain to relieve autoinhibition of the Snf1 catalytic domain (28Jiang R. Carlson M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3105-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Several yeast transcription factors, including Mig1, Sip4, Cat8, and Gln3, have been shown to be regulated by Snf1 (21Carlson M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 22Schuller H.J. Curr. Genet. 2003; 43: 139-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the Mig1 repressor by Snf1 triggers bulk relocalization of Mig1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, derepressing glucose-repressed genes, most of which are involved in utilization of alternative carbon sources (29De Vit M.J. Waddle J.A. Johnston M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1603-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Snf1 activates Sip4 and Cat8 to induce expression of genes involved in gluconeogenesis and the glyoxylate cycle (30Young E.T. Dombek K.M. Tachibana C. Ideker T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26146-26158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 31Vincent O. Carlson M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7002-7008Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and activates Gln3 to induce nitrogen catabolite-repressible genes (32Bertram P.G. Choi J.H. Carvalho J. Chan T.F. Ai W. Zheng X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1246-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Given previous genetic data, and the interaction of Snf1 with other yeast transcription factors, the Snf1-dependent, HSF-mediated induction of CUP1 expression under conditions of glucose starvation suggests that HSF could be a direct substrate of the Snf1 kinase. However, this possibility has not yet been addressed. Furthermore, the requirement for Snf1 for CUP1 activation in response to glucose starvation, but not heat stress (16Liu X.D. Thiele D.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 592-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 17Tamai K.T. Liu X. Silar P. Sosinowski T. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8155-8165Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), suggest that Snf1 activation of HSF could provide insight into how HSF proteins in general sense multiple distinct stresses. Here we demonstrate that Snf1 interacts with HSF in vivo and is necessary for glucose-starvation induced HSF phosphorylation. Furthermore, Snf1 is required for more widespread activation of HSF target gene expression and for the maintenance of HSF binding to target gene chromatin in vivo. Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions—Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. JHY39, a snf1Δ derivative of BY4741, was generated by homologous recombination with a 6-kb BamHI/SphI DNA fragment from plasmid psnf1::hisG as described previously (17Tamai K.T. Liu X. Silar P. Sosinowski T. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8155-8165Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). JHY31, harboring an HSE mutation in the RPN4 promoter, was generated from BY4741 by in vivo site-directed mutagenesis using oligonucleotides (33Storici F. Lewis L.K. Resnick M.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The HSE of the RPN4 promoter (–348 TTCTAGAAAGTTC) was mutated to TTTTAAAAAGTTT (mutated nucleotides are underlined) in the chromosome of JHY31. Yeast cultures were grown in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, 2% dextrose) or synthetic complete (SC) medium lacking appropriate amino acids or other nutrients, to maintain plasmids. Glucose concentrations were altered as specified.Table IS. cerevisiae strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceMCY1093MATa his4-539 uras3-52 lys2-801Marian CarlsonDTY125MATa his4-539 uras3-52 lys2-801 snf1Δ(17)DTY179MATa his4-539 uras3-52 lys2-801 HSF-(1-583)(17)W303-1AMATa ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11, 15 leu2-3,-112 trp1-1 ura3-1(58)W303-1A msn2msn4MATa ade2-1 can1-100, leu2-3,-112 trp1-1 ura3-1 msn2-Δ3::HIS3 msn4-1::TRP1(59)BY4741MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0(60)BY4741 reg1ΔMATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 reg1Δ::kanMX4Research GeneticsBY4741 gac1ΔMATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 gac1Δ::kanMX4Research GeneticsJHY39MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 snf1ΔThis studyJHY31MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 RPN4 HSEmThis studyRSY620MATa ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11 leu2-3,-112 his3 trp1-1 ura3 pep4::TRP1(61) Open table in a new tab Plasmids—Plasmids pYEX 4T-SNF1 and pYEX 4T-SNF1 K84R were generated by cloning a 1.9-kb PCR product containing the SNF1 open reading frame into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of modified pYEX 4T-1 (34Martzen M.R. McCraith S.M. Spinelli S.L. Torres F.M. Fields S. Grayhack E.J. Phizicky E.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1153-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). For pYEX 4T-SNF1 K84R, plasmid pRJ180 (35Ludin K. Jiang R. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6245-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) was used as a PCR template. The expression vector for GST-HSF (pGEX-2T-HSF1) (36Erkine A.M. Adams C.C. Diken T. Gross D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7004-7017Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. David Gross and the pGEX-2T-HSF1-(1–583), an expression vector for GST-HSF-(1–583) was generated by replacing a 0.8 kb NheI/SpeI fragment of pGEX-2T-HSF1 with that of pHSF-(1–583) containing two stop codons after codon 583 (17Tamai K.T. Liu X. Silar P. Sosinowski T. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8155-8165Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Plasmid pGEX-3X-HSF1-(1–300) was generated by cloning a PCR product into the SmaI/EcoRI sites of pGEX-3X. For two-hybrid analysis, the SNF1 open reading frame was cloned into pBTM116 (37Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) to express a LexA-Snf1 fusion protein, and HSF1 and SNF4 were cloned into pACTII to generate plasmids expressing Gal4 activation domain fusion proteins (38Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). RNA and Immunoblot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from yeast cells, fractionated on 1.5% agarose-formaldehyde gels, and RNA blots were probed with 32P-labeled DNA fragments derived from PCR-amplified DNA fragments encompassing specified open reading frames. For detection of HSF protein whole yeast cells were precipitated with a final concentration of 5% trichloroacetic acid, the pellets were washed twice with acetone, dried, resuspended in 50 μl of boiling buffer (50 mm Tris (pH. 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS), and broken by vortexing in the presence of glass beads. SDS sample buffer was added to the cells extracts, and samples were boiled before loading onto 6% SDS-PAGE gels. HSF protein was detected by immunoblotting with anti-HSF antibody (39Sorger P.K. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 855-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). In Vitro Protein Kinase Assays—Yeast strain RSY620 was transformed with pYEX 4T-SNF1 or pYEX 4T-SNF1 K84R, expression of GST-Snf1 was induced with 0.1 mm CuSO4 for 3 h, and the GST fusion proteins were purified as previously described (34Martzen M.R. McCraith S.M. Spinelli S.L. Torres F.M. Fields S. Grayhack E.J. Phizicky E.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1153-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Cells were disrupted with glass beads in extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH. 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 1 m NaCl), and GST-Snf1 was purified by incubation with glutathione-agarose (Sigma). GST-Snf1 bound to glutathione-agarose was washed twice with washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.5 m NaCl) and once with kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μm ATP). Kinase reactions were performed in a 20-μl reaction mixture by incubation with 5 μg of GST-HSF purified from Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at room temperature for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Yeast cells were grown in 50 ml of SC medium with 2% glucose to A600 of 0.7 at 30 °C, and proteins were cross-linked to their DNA binding sites by adding formaldehyde to a final concentration of 1% to the cultures before stress, or after heat shock at 39 °C for 10 min, or after shifting to 0.05% glucose medium for 3 h. HSF-cross-linked DNA was isolated, sheared, and immunoprecipitated using anti-HSF antibody (a gift of Dr. David Gross) and purified after reversal of the cross-linking as described previously (40Iyer V.R. Horak C.E. Scafe C.S. Botstein D. Snyder M. Brown P.O. Nature. 2001; 409: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). For PCR analysis of immunoprecipitated DNA, ∼0.1–1% of each immunoprecipitated sample was used to amplify specific promoter regions. PCR was performed for 27 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 50 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C in a 50-μl reaction with 1 μm of each primer, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dNTP, and 0.1 μCi/ml [α-32P]dATP. PCR products were run on a 6% polyacrylamide gel and quantitated by phosphorimaging. Snf1-dependent Induction of Multiple HSF Targets under Glucose Starvation—Recently we and others have identified genome-wide binding sites of the S. cerevisiae HSF using chromatin immunoprecipitated combined with DNA microarray analysis (41Lee T.I. Rinaldi N.J. Robert F. Odom D.T. Bar-Joseph Z. Gerber G.K. Hannett N.M. Harbison C.T. Thompson C.M. Simon I. Zeitlinger J. Jennings E.G. Murray H.L. Gordon D.B. Ren B. Wyrick J.J. Tagne J.B. Volkert T.L. Fraenkel E. Gifford D.K. Young R.A. Science. 2002; 298: 799-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2334) Google Scholar).2 According to the previously published mRNA expression data (42Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3643) Google Scholar), the large majority of the identified HSF targets that are bound by HSF in vivo are induced by heat shock. Interestingly, ∼30% of the chromosomal HSF target genes identified by our ChIP-microarray studies are also induced during diauxic shift by more than 2-fold, in agreement with the previous reports showing activation of HSF targets such as CUP1, HSP26, and HSP104 by glucose starvation (17Tamai K.T. Liu X. Silar P. Sosinowski T. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8155-8165Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 18Amoros M. Estruch F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1523-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously that the Snf1 kinase and the Snf4 activation subunit are necessary for HSF-mediated induction of CUP1 under glucose starvation conditions, but not in response to heat shock (17Tamai K.T. Liu X. Silar P. Sosinowski T. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8155-8165Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether the role of Snf1 can be generalized to other HSF targets, or whether this mode of activation is specific for the CUP1 gene. Several HSF target genes, identified previously (41Lee T.I. Rinaldi N.J. Robert F. Odom D.T. Bar-Joseph Z. Gerber G.K. Hannett N.M. Harbison C.T. Thompson C.M. Simon I. Zeitlinger J. Jennings E.G. Murray H.L. Gordon D.B. Ren B. Wyrick J.J. Tagne J.B. Volkert T.L. Fraenkel E. Gifford D.K. Young R.A. Science. 2002; 298: 799-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2334) Google Scholar) and in our genome-wide analysis, are also regulated by the general stress transcription factors Msn2/Msn4. Because Msn2 and Msn4 are negatively regulated by the cAMP-dependent kinase PKA, they are activated under low glucose conditions as well as other stress conditions including heat shock, oxidative stress, and osmotic stress (43Thevelein J.M. de Winde J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 904-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that both HSF and Msn2/Msn4 contribute to the activation of HSP26 and HSP104 gene expression in response to carbon starvation (18Amoros M. Estruch F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1523-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effects of mutations in the MSN2 and MSN4 genes, as well as in a distinct HSF trans-activation domain, on the expression of HSF targets in response to glucose limitation. To test the involvement of HSF, encoded by an essential gene, we used a strain expressing HSF, which lacks the carboxyl-terminal activation domain (CTA). Unlike HSFs of other organisms, which have only a carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain, yeast HSF possesses an additional aminoterminal activation domain (NTA), which has been shown to be involved in transient responses, whereas the CTA is involved in both transient and sustained responses (44Sorger P.K. Cell. 1990; 62: 793-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The HSF CTA was previously demonstrated to be responsible for activation of CUP1, HSP26, and HSP104 in response to carbon source starvation (17Tamai K.T. Liu X. Silar P. Sosinowski T. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8155-8165Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 18Amoros M. Estruch F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1523-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). When cells grown in the presence of 2% glucose were limited for glucose by shifting to a medium containing 0.05% glucose, induction of several HSF target genes was observed after 1.5 or 3 h (Fig. 1A). For the HSP26, HSP30, and SSA3 genes the induction was dramatically reduced in both the msn2msn4 and HSFΔCTA strains compared with each parental wild type strain, demonstrating a contribution of both Msn2/Msn4 and HSF for their induction in response to glucose limitation. Induction of the HSF target genes RPN4, CUP1, EDC2, and HSP82 was reduced in the HSFΔCTA mutant, but not by the msn2msn4 mutation, suggesting that HSF plays a more pronounced role for induction of these genes under glucose starvation conditions, with little contribution of Msn2/Msn4. However, induction of all of seven HSF targets in response to glucose deprivation was significantly compromised in snf1Δ compared with the isogenic wild type strain. Although induction of HSP82 was not obvious in the wild type strain MCY1093, HSP82 expression levels were diminished in HSFΔCTA and snf1Δ, implying that HSF is necessary to maintain expression levels of HSP82 under low glucose conditions. In contrast, deletion of SNF1 did not affect the induction of any of the HSF targets analyzed in response to heat shock, although the induction of most of these targets was reduced in the HSFΔCTA mutant background (Fig. 1B). The modest effect of the HSFΔCTA allele on HSP26 and SSA3 induction might reflect the contribution of Msn2/Msn4 for heat shock induction of these genes and/or a reliance on the HSF NTA. Taken together these data suggest that activation of many HSF target genes is responsive to glucose starvation and is Snf1-dependent. Furthermore, these data strongly suggest that, for all of these targets, activation by heat shock and glucose starvation is mediated by distinct signal transduction pathways. Differential Regulation of HSF and Msn2/Msn4 by Snf1— Snf1-dependent induction of HSP26 under glucose starvation conditions is distinct from a previous report suggesting that Snf1 negatively regulates Msn2/Msn4 under carbon starvation conditions (45Mayordomo I. Estruch F. Sanz P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35650-35656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Mayordomo et al. (45Mayordomo I. Estruch F. Sanz P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35650-35656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) showed that, when yeast cells grown in rich (YPD) medium were transferred to minimal medium without any carbon source, induction of Msn2-regulated genes, including HSP26 was increased in snf1Δ and decreased in reg1Δ strain compared with the wild type. Reg1 mediates the targeting of Glc7 phosphatase to Snf1, resulting in Snf1 inactivation. Therefore, Snf1 is constitutively active in reg1Δ cells even under high glucose conditions (46Sanz P. Alms G.R. Haystead T.A. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1321-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To understand these apparently discordant results, we compared two different carbon starvation conditions; shift from medium with 2% glucose to medium with 0.05% glucose in which we observed a positive role for Snf1 in expression of HSF targets, or shift to a medium without any glucose (Fig. 2A). In agreement with previous reports showing a negative role for Snf1 in Msn2 activity, induction of HSP26 and HSP30 was increased in snf1Δ and decreased in reg1Δ compared with the wild type, when cells were shifted to a medium without any carbon source for 30–60 min. However, when cells were starved for glucose by shifting to medium with 0.05% glucose for 3 h, the induction levels of HSP26 and HSP30 were reduced in snf1Δ in consistent with the results shown in Fig. 1A.

https://openalex.org/W2160143801,"EtaA is a newly identified FAD-containing monooxygenase that is responsible for activation of several thioamide prodrugs in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It was found that purified EtaA displays a remarkably low activity with the antitubercular prodrug ethionamide. Hinted by the presence of a Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase sequence motif in the EtaA sequence, we have been able to identify a large number of novel EtaA substrates. It was discovered that the enzyme converts a wide range of ketones to the corresponding esters or lactones via a Baeyer-Villiger reaction, indicating that EtaA represents a Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase. With the exception of aromatic ketones (phenylacetone and benzylacetone), long-chain ketones (e.g. 2-hexanone and 2-dodecanone) also are converted. EtaA is also able to catalyze enantioselective sulfoxidation of methyl-p-tolylsulfide. Conversion of all of the identified substrates is relatively slow with typical kcat values of around 0.02 s–1. The best substrate identified so far is phenylacetone (Km = 61 μm, kcat = 0.017 s–1). Redox monitoring of the flavin cofactor during turnover of phenylacetone indicates that a step in the reductive half-reaction is limiting the rate of catalysis. Intriguingly, EtaA activity could be increased by one order of magnitude by adding bovine serum albumin.

Intriguingly, EtaA activity could be increased by one order of magnitude by adding bovine serum albumin. This reactivity and substrate acceptance-profiling study provides valuable information concerning this newly identified prodrug activator from M. tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is the world's leading cause of death from a single infectious organism. Standard tuberculosis chemotherapy consists of a lengthy treatment with at least two so-called first-line drugs, e.g. isoniazid and rifampicin. Unfortunately, an increasing number of tuberculosis cases are encountered that cannot be treated because of resistance to one or more of these drugs (1Dye C. Williams B.G. Espinal M.A. Raviglione M.C. Science. 2002; 295: 2042-2046Google Scholar, 2WHO/IUATLD Global Project on Anti-Tuberculosis Drug Resistance Surveillance Antituberculosis Drug Resistance in the World. Report 2: Prevalence and Trends. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland2002Google Scholar). The last resort for combating such (multi)-drug-resistant mycobacterial infections relies mainly on the action of second-line antitubercular drugs. For this reason, several thioamide drugs have been successfully employed during the last decades (Fig. 1). However, as for other antitubercular agents, more and more infections are encountered that are also resistant to thioamide-based treatment. Despite their widespread use, the mode of action of thioamide antibiotics as well as the mechanism by which mycobacteria acquire resistance against these drugs has remained obscure.A few years ago a gene from Mycobacterium tuberculosis was identified that is responsible for the antitubercular effect of ethionamide, which was named etaA (3DeBarber A.E. Mdluli K. Bosman M. Bekker L.G. Barry C.E. II I Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9677-9682Google Scholar, 4Baulard A.R. Betts J.C. Engohang-Ndong J. Quan S. McAdam R.A. Brennan P.J. Locht C. Besra G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28326-28331Google Scholar). Ethionamide was found to be activated by the corresponding protein EtaA, after which the activated product exerts a lethal effect by interacting with a final target. The activating role of EtaA was confirmed by overexpression of the prodrug activator in Mycobacterium smegmatis, resulting in ethionamide-hypersensitive mycobacteria. Clinically observed resistance toward the prodrug could be associated with etaA gene mutations resulting in functional impairment of EtaA. A thorough analysis of ethionamide-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates has revealed cross-resistance to two other widely used thiocarbamide-containing drugs, thiacetazone and thiocarlide (see Fig. 1) (3DeBarber A.E. Mdluli K. Bosman M. Bekker L.G. Barry C.E. II I Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9677-9682Google Scholar). In addition, it is very likely that the antitubercular effect of prothionamide can also be linked to activation by EtaA because it differs from ethionamide by only one methyl group. This indicates that EtaA displays an exceptional broad prodrug acceptance. Furthermore, because ethionamide is also used to treat leprosy, a similar activating enzyme is expected to be present in this related pathogenic Mycobacterium leprae. This is in line with the observation that, similar to M. tuberculosis, cross-resistance among above-mentioned thioamides has been observed for M. leprae (5Pattyn S.R. Colston M.J. Lepr. Rev. 1978; 49: 324-326Google Scholar). Genome analysis indeed shows that, despite a dramatically reduced genome size, an etaA gene ortholog has been conserved in the M. leprae genome (6Cole S.T. Eiglmeier K. Parkhill J. James K.D. Thomson N.R. Wheeler P.R. Honore N. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Mungall K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies R.M. Devlin K. Duthoy S.

Rev. 2001; 72: 429-440Google Scholar).Recently, the primary final target of EtaA-activated ethionamide has been identified to be InhA, an enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase involved in fatty acid synthesis (8Larsen M.H. Vilcheze C. Kremer L. Besra G.S. Parsons L. Salfinger M. Heifets L. Hazbon M.H. Alland D. Sacchettini J.C. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 453-466Google Scholar). InhA is also the final target for another well known antitubercular prodrug, isoniazid. Although sharing the same final target, the prodrugs ethionamide and isoniazid are specifically activated by two unrelated redox enzymes. While isoniazid is activated by a heme-containing catalase-peroxidase (KatG) (9Zhang Y. Heym B. Allen B. Young D. Cole S. Nature. 1992; 358: 591-593Google Scholar), it has recently been shown that EtaA is a flavin-containing monooxygenase (10Vannelli T.A. Dykman A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12824-12829Google Scholar). EtaA-mediated conversion of ethionamide results in the formation of the corresponding sulfoxide product. This sulfoxide product does not represent the cytotoxic species but rather has to be activated in a subsequent reaction. This second activation step was also found to be catalyzed by EtaA yielding 2-ethyl-4-amidopyridine as final product (10Vannelli T.A. Dykman A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12824-12829Google Scholar). However, this amide has no antitubercular activity, indicating that the key toxic species is formed as an unstable reactive product intermediate (3DeBarber A.E. Mdluli K. Bosman M. Bekker L.G. Barry C.E. II I Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9677-9682Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the initial sulfinate product formed after two consecutive EtaA-mediated sulfoxidations of ethionamide decomposes to form a labile toxic intermediate. This intermediate would resemble activated isoniazid inhibiting the final target InhA by forming a covalently modified NADH derivative in the active site of InhA (11Banerjee A. Dubnau E. Quemard A. Balasubramanian V. Um K.S. Wilson T. Collins D. de Lisle G. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Science. 1994; 263: 227-230Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it has been observed that the effect of activated ethionamide on InhA activity differs from isoniazid-based inhibition as inhibition cannot be prevented by the addition of NADH or NAD+ (12Johnsson K. King D.S. Schultz P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5009-5010Google Scholar). This finding suggests a different mode of action of the activated product. Furthermore, it has been found that the final target for other antitubercular thioamides may differ for each thioamide prodrug. Different from ethionamide and isoniazid, thiocarlide and related thioamide compounds specifically affect the synthesis of short-chain fatty acids (13Phetsuksiri B. Baulard A.R. Cooper A.M. Minnikin D.E. Douglas J.D. Besra G.S. Brennan P.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1042-1051Google Scholar).A sequence homology search using the EtaA sequence revealed significant homology with several flavin-containing monooxygenases. Furthermore, the presence of a newly identified sequence fingerprint (FXGXXXHXXXW(P/D)) suggests that EtaA is a flavin-containing Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase (BVMO) 1The abbreviations used are: BVMOBaeyer-Villiger monooxygenaseEtaAethionamide monooxygenaseBSAbovine serum albuminGC-MSgas chromatography-mass spectrometryFADflavin adenine dinucleotide.1The abbreviations used are: BVMOBaeyer-Villiger monooxygenaseEtaAethionamide monooxygenaseBSAbovine serum albuminGC-MSgas chromatography-mass spectrometryFADflavin adenine dinucleotide. (14Fraaije M.W. Kamerbeek N.M. van Berkel W.J.H. Janssen D.B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 518: 43-47Google Scholar). In fact, a search in the protein sequence data base revealed that the closest homolog (24% sequence identity) with known activity is 4-hydroxyacetophenone monooxygenase. This BVMO has recently been cloned and expressed in our laboratory (15Kamerbeek N.M. Moonen M.J. van der Ven J.G. van Berkel W.J.H. Fraaije M.W. Janssen D.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2547-2557Google Scholar) and prompted us to study the substrate specificity and reactivity of the recently identified prodrug activator EtaA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—Restriction enzymes, NADH, NADPH, glucose oxidase (grade II), and catalase, were obtained from Roche Applied Science. Ketones were purchased from Acros, Aldrich, and Lancaster. NADP+, 3-acetyl-NADP+, and 3-amino-NADP+ were from Fluka. All of the other chemicals were of commercially available analytical grade. DNA samples were purified using the QIAQuick gel and purification kit from Qiagen. Escherichia coli TOP10-competent cells and the pBAD/myc-HisA vector were obtained from Invitrogen. Purified recombinant 4-hydroxyacetophenone monooxygenase was obtained as described previously (15Kamerbeek N.M. Moonen M.J. van der Ven J.G. van Berkel W.J.H. Fraaije M.W. Janssen D.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2547-2557Google Scholar).Expression and Purification of Recombinant EtaA—The etaA gene was amplified using pMH29-containing etaA as template (kindly provided by C. E. Barry, III and A. E. DeBarber, National Institutes of Health) and the following two primers: PETA1 (5′-GGCACGGCATATGACCGAGCACCTCGACGTTGTC-3′, NdeI site is shown underlined) and PETA2 (5′-GGCACGGAAGCTTAACCCCCACCGGGGCAGGCCTTTTGG-3′, HindIII site is shown underlined). For expression, a pBAD/myc-HisA (Invitrogen) derived expression vector, pBADNK, was used in which the original NdeI sites have been removed, whereas the NcoI site has been replaced by a NdeI site (16Kamerbeek N.M. Olsthoorn A.J.J. Fraaije M.W. Janssen D.B. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 419-426Google Scholar). After amplification, the gene was isolated from gel, digested with NdeI and HindIII, and ligated behind the araBAD promoter of the NdeI/HindIII-digested pBADNK-yielding pBETA1. Expression using pBETA1 results in the production of EtaA containing 25 additional C-terminal residues (c-myc epitope and His6). Expression of native EtaA was achieved by introducing a stop codon in pBETA1 using the primers PETA3 (5′-GCCCCGGTGGGGGTTTGAAAGCTTGGGCCCGAAC-3′, HindIII site is shown underlined) and PETA4 (5′-GTTCGGGCCCAAGCTTTCAAACCCCCACCGGGGC-3′, HindIII site is shown underlined) resulting in pBETA2. For expression, E. coli TOP10 cells were transformed with pBETA1 or pBETA2 and grown in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.02% (w/v) arabinose at a temperature of 25 °C.His-tagged EtaA was purified using the following procedure. Cells from a 2-liter culture were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in TMAG (50 mm Tris, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm NaN3, 10% v/v glycerol, pH 7.5, containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100). After sonication and centrifugation, the resulting supernatant was added to nickel-agarose affinity column material with a capacity of 50 mg. By means of end-over-end rotation, the column material was resuspended with the extract and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After incubation, the column material was washed by gravitational flow. Upon washing the column with 10 column volumes of TMAG and 10 column volumes of TMAG containing 20 mm imidazole, the enzyme was washed from the column with TMAG containing 400 mm imidazole. To remove the imidazole, the collected enzyme fraction was applied to a preequilibrated Hi-prep 26/10-desalting column (Amersham Biosciences). Finally, the enzyme was concentrated by using an Amicon ultrafiltration unit equipped with a 100-kDa cut-off filter and stored at –80 °C.Native EtaA was purified using three columns. The harvested cells were resuspended in buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm NaN3, 10% v/v glycerol, pH 7.5), sonicated, and centrifuged. In the first column step, the extract was applied onto a Q-Sepharose column. The enzyme could be eluted using 250 mm KCl. In the second step, the collected enzyme fraction was applied onto a ceramic hydroxyapatite column (2.5 × 12 cm, Type I, particle size 20 μm, Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. The enzyme was eluted using a gradient of 20–300 mm potassium phosphate. Active fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration and applied to a 26/60 Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences). Again, active fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration and subsequently stored at –80 °C.Analytical Methods—Analytical size-exclusion chromatography was performed using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) using TMAG with or without 0.5 mg/ml BSA. Aliquots of 100 μl were loaded on the column and eluted at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Apparent molecular masses were determined using a calibration curve made with standards from the molecular mass marker kit from Bio-Rad: thyroglobulin (670 kDa); bovine γ globulin (158 kDa); chicken ovalbumin (44 kDa); equine myoglobin (17 kDa); and vitamin B12 (1.35 kDa).Enzyme activity with all of the tested ketones was determined spectrophotometrically by monitoring the decrease of NADPH at 340 nm (ϵ340 nm = 6.22 mm–1 cm–1). Conversion of ethionamide was measured by monitoring the formation of the ethionamide-oxide product at 400 nm (ϵ400 nm = 1.0 mm–1 cm–1). Reaction mixtures (1.0 ml) typically contained 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 0.2 mm NADPH, and 1.0 μm enzyme. For determining the Km for NADPH, 1.0 mm phenylacetone was used as substrate. For measuring the effect of additives, 0.5 mm phenylacetone and 0.2 mm NADPH were used. All of the kinetic measurements were performed at 25 °C using air-saturated buffers.The redox potential of EtaA was determined by the method of Massey (17Massey V. Curti B. Ronchi S. Zanetti G. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin, Germany1990: 59-66Google Scholar). Enzyme (5 μm) in the presence of 2 μm methyl viologen, 5 μm phenosafranin (Em = –252 mV), 200 μm xanthine, and 10% (w/v) glycerol in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, was made anaerobic in a cuvette by flushing with nitrogen. Reduction was initiated by adding 0.5 μg/ml xanthine oxidase and subsequently monitored using a PerkinElmer Lambda Bio 40 spectrophotometer (at 25 °C). Spectra (300–700 nm) were recorded every minute until the reduction of both dye and enzyme was complete (∼1.5 h). Reduction of the dye was measured at 520 nm, whereas flavin reduction could be followed at 404 nm.Product Identification—For product identification, samples (1.0 ml) containing 5 mm of substrate, 2.5 mm NADPH, and 2 μm EtaA were incubated for 24 h at 25 °C. The reaction was quenched by adding 1.0 ml of ethyl acetate containing 1.0 mm hexadecane. The ethyl acetate layer was collected and dried over MgSO4 and subsequently analyzed by GC-MS. GC-MS analysis was performed on a Hewlett Packard HP 5890 series II gas chromatograph and a Hewlett Packard HP 5971 mass spectrometer equipped with an HP-5 column. Samples (1 μl) were injected without derivatization and using the following temperature program: a gradient from 50 to 150 °C in 10 min, 4-min isothermal at 150 °C followed by a gradient from 150 to 300 °C in 3 min, and finally 12-min isothermal at 300 °C. The enantioselective sulfoxidation of methyl-p-tolylsulfide was monitored by GC using a Chiraldesc G-TA column (30 m × 0.25 mm) (16Kamerbeek N.M. Olsthoorn A.J.J. Fraaije M.W. Janssen D.B. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 419-426Google Scholar).RESULTSPurification and Spectral Characterization of Recombinant EtaA—EtaA containing a His6 and c-myc epitope tag at the C terminus was purified from cell extracts in the presence of Triton X-100. From 1 liter of culture, ∼15 mg of recombinant protein could be purified. The purified enzyme migrated as a single band in SDS-PAGE corresponding to a mass of ∼56 kDa. This value is close to the theoretical mass of the recombinant protein (58,216 Da). Elimination of the detergent from the purification buffer resulted in very low yields (<10% compared with the addition of 0.1% Triton X-100), suggesting that the enzyme is membrane-associated. Solubilization of EtaA by Triton X-100 has been observed previously (10Vannelli T.A. Dykman A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12824-12829Google Scholar). However, no clear hydrophobic segments could be identified in the EtaA sequence that could serve as a membrane anchor. The EtaA sequence shows homology with a number of other flavin-containing monooxygenases that are all known to be monomeric or dimeric soluble proteins (14Fraaije M.W. Kamerbeek N.M. van Berkel W.J.H. Janssen D.B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 518: 43-47Google Scholar). Nonetheless, it was found that EtaA tends to form oligomers as evidenced by gel filtration experiments. Gel filtration experiments performed in this study showed that the enzyme exists as a mixture of relatively large oligomers ranging from 200 to 600 kDa.Compared with His-tagged EtaA, purified native EtaA displayed similar hydrodynamic properties and showed the same activity toward ethionamide (see below). As purification of His-tagged enzyme is very efficient, this EtaA variant has been used for all of the experiments described below.EtaA was purified as a brightly yellow protein indicating that it contains a tightly bound flavin cofactor, which has previously been identified as FAD (10Vannelli T.A. Dykman A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12824-12829Google Scholar). Spectral analysis of the purified recombinant enzyme showed a typical flavin spectrum displaying absorbance maxima at around 367 and 451 nm (Fig. 2). The ratio in absorbance at 280 and 451 nm for the purified protein was typically 16. This ratio was found to be the same for all of the oligomeric species observed upon gel filtration, indicating that flavin content is not dependent on the oligomeric state. Unfolding of the enzyme by 0.05% SDS resulted in a rapid release of the flavin cofactor allowing quantification of the released cofactor. Combining the determined cofactor and protein subunit concentrations showed that the purified enzyme contains stoichiometric (1:1) amounts of the flavin cofactor. The molar extinction coefficient for EtaA could be calculated using the known value of free FAD (ϵ451 nm EtaA = 11,600 m–1 cm–1).Fig. 2Spectral changes observed upon reduction of EtaA. EtaA (6.3 μm) was anaerobically reduced by 150 μm NADPH in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5. Spectra (from top to bottom) were recorded at t = 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 min. A spectrum of fully reduced EtaA (—) was obtained by adding dithionite. Aerobic incubation of EtaA with 440 μm NADPH and 430 μm phenylacetone shows that the enzyme is mainly in the oxidized form during steady-state turnover (·····, spectra obtained after 2-min incubation).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Catalytic Properties of EtaA—To probe whether all of the EtaA-bound FAD participates in catalysis, the enzyme was mixed anaerobically with an excess of NADPH (Fig. 2). It was found that the enzyme was slowly reduced by the nicotinamide coenzyme. Comparing the spectrum reached after 30-min incubation with NADPH with the spectrum obtained by reduction with dithionite shows that the enzyme is almost fully reduced. The fact that the enzyme is able to bind and react with NADPH indicates that the enzyme is folded and catalytically competent. No significant flavin reduction could be measured when using NADH. This is in line with the observation that all of the characterized sequence-related monooxygenases are highly specific for NADPH (14Fraaije M.W. Kamerbeek N.M. van Berkel W.J.H. Janssen D.B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 518: 43-47Google Scholar). Aerobic incubations with NADPH revealed that the enzyme catalyzes a slow oxidation of NADPH (0.0045 s–1) generating hydrogen peroxide. A low NADPH oxidase activity has also been observed with other BVMOs (15Kamerbeek N.M. Moonen M.J. van der Ven J.G. van Berkel W.J.H. Fraaije M.W. Janssen D.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2547-2557Google Scholar, 19Ryerson C.C. Ballou D.P. Walsh C. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2644-2655Google Scholar).Using ethionamide and NADPH as substrates, a relatively slow sulfoxidation of the thioamide could be observed, confirming the activating role of EtaA. Conversion of ethionamide could be directly monitored by measuring the absorbance of the sulfoxide product at 400 nm (10Vannelli T.A. Dykman A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12824-12829Google Scholar). Oxygen concentration was not limiting the rate of ethionamide conversion because using oxygen-saturated solutions did not increase the conversion rate. The determined steady-state kinetic parameters of EtaA for ethionamide oxidation suggest that ethionamide is a remarkably poor substrate for the prodrug activator displaying a relatively low kcat value of 0.027 s–1 and a Km of 340 μm (Table I). Such a low rate of conversion does not seem to be of physiological importance because conversion rates (kcat) for FAD-containing monooxygenases typically range from 1 to 30 s–1 (18Kamerbeek N.M. Janssen D.B. van Berkel W.J.H. Fraaije M.W. Adv. Synth. Cat. 2003; 345: 667-678Google Scholar, 20Duetz W.A. van Beilen J.B. Witholt B. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2001; 12: 419-425Google Scholar). In fact, it is difficult to envisage that such an inefficient prodrug activation can initiate the bactericidal effect observed in mycobacteria. The enzyme was found to be efficient in NADPH recognition displaying a Km of 10 μm using ethionamide as oxygenating substrate. This value is similar to those found for other sequence related-monooxygenases (18Kamerbeek N.M. Janssen D.B. van Berkel W.J.H. Fraaije M.W. Adv. Synth. Cat. 2003; 345: 667-678Google Scholar).Table IIdentified EtaA substrates and corresponding productsaProduct has been identified by Vannelli et al. (10Vannelli T.A. Dykman A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12824-12829Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab It is known that flavin-containing monooxygenases can with the exception of catalyzing oxygenations also generate hydrogen peroxide. In fact, the addition of certain effector molecules can accelerate such a NADPH oxidase activity. For example, the FAD-containing 2-hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase from Pseudomonas azelaica HBP1 uses, depending on the substrate, only a small part of all consumed NADPH molecules to hydroxylate the substrate, whereas all of the other electron equivalents are used for hydrogen peroxide formation (21Meyer A. Schmid A. Held M. Westphal A.H. Rothlisberger M. Kohler H.P. van Berkel W.J.H. Witholt B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5575-5582Google Scholar). Because hydrogen peroxide is a potent oxidative agent, it was imperative to test whether the observed sulfoxidation reactions catalyzed by EtaA are truly enzyme-mediated. For this reason, we examined the EtaA-mediated conversion of methyl-p-tolylsulfide, a sulfide that is readily accepted by other flavin-dependent monooxygenases as substrate (18Kamerbeek N.M. Janssen D.B. van Berkel W.J.H. Fraaije M.W. Adv. Synth. Cat. 2003; 345: 667-678Google Scholar). It was found that EtaA catalyzes an enantioselective oxygenation of this sulfide, yielding mainly the S-sulfoxide (55% enantiomeric excess). The addition of catalase to the incubation mixture did not influence the observed enantioselectivity. These results indicate that the sulfide is oxidized in the active site of EtaA by reacting with the electrophilic hydroperoxy form of the flavin cofactor (18Kamerbeek N.M. Janssen D.B. van Berkel W.J.H. Fraaije M.W. Adv. Synth. Cat. 2003; 345: 667-678Google Scholar), confirming a direct role of EtaA in sulfide oxidation.EtaA Catalyzes Baeyer-Villiger Reactions—Hinted by the presence of a BVMO identifying sequence motif in the EtaA sequence (14Fraaije M.W. Kamerbeek N.M. van Berkel W.J.H. Janssen D.B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 518: 43-47Google Scholar), we tested a range of ketones that have been shown to be converted by BVMOs. It was found that several typical BVMO substrates (cyclohexanone, acetophenone, and 4-hydroxyacetophenone) were not accepted by EtaA. Incubations with these ketones did not increase consumption of NADPH nor could the expected lactone or ester products be detected by GC-MS analysis. However, although the addition of bicyclohept-2-en-6-one did not increase the rate of NADPH oxidation, a small amount (∼1% conversion) of a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation product, 3-oxabicyclo[3.3.0]oct-6-en-2-one, could be detected. This prompted us to test more aliphatic ketones. By GC-MS analysis, it was found that a surprisingly broad range of ketones was converted by EtaA (Table I). Besides several long-chain alkanones ranging from 2-hexanone to 2-dodecanone, phenyl substituent-bearing ketones also are converted via a Baeyer-Villiger reaction into the corresponding esters. With the exception of the long-chain alkanones 2-octanone, 2-decanone, and 2-dodecanone, conversion of all of the ketones resulted in the formation of the expected ester product. In the case of 3-octanone, 2-decanone, and 2-dodecanone, some formation of the chemically less favored ester products could also be detected. By this, EtaA-mediated oxidation obeys the stereochemical rule of Baeyer-Villiger oxidation reactions where the oxygen is typically inserted by migration of the most substituted alkyl chain. For some of the identified substrates, the steady-state parameters were determined (Table II). Remarkably, all of the measured kcat values are in the same range as determined for ethionamide. Only the Km values varied to a significant extent, revealing that phenylacetone is the best substrate found so far.Table IISteady-state kinetic parameters of EtaASubstrateKmkcatFMTaThe flavin-monitored turnover (FMT) value indicates the percentage of oxidized cofactor during turnover.μms-1%Ethionamide3400.02788Phenylacetone610.01790Benzylacetone5200.021912-Dodecanone2000.02394a The flavin-monitored turnover (FMT) value indicates the percentage of oxidized cofactor during turnover. Open table in a new tab The similar kcat values found for all of the tested substrates suggest that the rate of oxygenation is determined by a shared slow event along the catalytic cycle. By determining the redox state of the enzyme during turnover, it can be established which half-reaction comprises this rate-limiting event. For these flavin-monitored turnover experiments, the absorbance at 440 nm was taken as the indicator for the presence of oxidized enzyme. By incubating the enzyme with saturating amounts of substrate, the redox state of EtaA during conversion of ethionamide, benzylacetone, phenylacetone, and 2-dodecanone was determined. For all of the tested substrates, it was found that the enzyme is mainly present in the oxidized state, indicating that a catalytic step in the reductive half-reaction is limiting the rate of catalysis.During the reductive half-reaction, a hydride is transferred from the NADPH coenzyme to th"

AE is caused by the reduced uptake of dietary zinc by enterocytes, and the ensuing systemic zinc deficiency leads to dermatological lesions and immune and reproductive dysfunction. The gene responsible for AE, SLC39A4, encodes a member of the ZIP family of metal transporters, hZIP4. The mouse ZIP4 protein, mZIP4, stimulates zinc uptake in cultured cells, and studies in mice have demonstrated that zinc treatment decreases mZIP4 mRNA levels in the gut. In this study, we demonstrated using transfected cultured cells that the mZIP4 protein is also regulated at a post-translational level in response to zinc availability. Zinc deficiency increased mZIP4 protein levels at the plasma membrane, and this was associated with increased zinc uptake. Significantly, treating cells with low micromolar zinc concentrations stimulated the rapid endocytosis of the transporter. Zinc-regulated localization of the human ZIP4 protein was also demonstrated in cultured cells. These findings suggest that zinc-regulated trafficking of human and mouse ZIP4 is a key mechanism controlling dietary zinc absorption and cellular zinc homeostasis.

These findings suggest that zinc-regulated trafficking of human and mouse ZIP4 is a key mechanism controlling dietary zinc absorption and cellular zinc homeostasis. Zinc is an essential nutrient for all organisms because it is required by a variety of enzymes that are involved in critical areas of metabolism. However, zinc is also potentially toxic when allowed to accumulate beyond cellular needs. Thus, homeostatic mechanisms have evolved to precisely regulate intracellular levels of this nutrient. Genetic studies in bakers' yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, identified the first eukaryotic zinc import protein, ZRT1 (1Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 2Korshunova Y.O. Eide D. Clark W.G. Guerinot M.L. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). The ZRT1 protein shows significant sequence homology to the IRT1 protein from Arabidopsis thaliana, which is primarily an iron transporter that can also transport zinc (3Eide D. Broderius M. Fett J. Guerinot M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5624-5628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). Both ZRT1 and IRT1 were the founding members of the ZIP (ZRT1-IRT1-like protein) super-family of metal transporters that exist in all eukaryotes (for review, see Ref. 4Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. Biometals. 2001; 14: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The hallmark features of ZIP proteins include eight transmembrane domains, the fourth of which contains fully conserved histidyl and glycyl residues in a putative amphipathic α-helix. In humans, 14 ZIP proteins have been identified by data base sequence comparisons (5Eide D.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. T. Physiol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar), and at least two of these proteins, hZIP1 and hZIP2, function as zinc importers when expressed in K562 cells (6Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol.

Dermatol. 1967; 96: 736-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), such as dermatological lesions, changes in the small bowel mucosa, reduced weight gain, and immune and reproductive dysfunction (11Baudon J.J.

The primary basis of AE is hypothesized to be the reduced uptake of dietary zinc by intestinal cells (15Atherton D.J. Muller D.P. Aggett P.J. Harries J.T. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 1979; 56: 505-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16Lombeck T. Schnippering H.G. Ritzl F. Feinendegen L.E. Bremer H.J. Lancet. 1975; 1: 855Abstract PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) because patients respond positively to dietary zinc supplements (11Baudon J.J. Fontaine J.L. Larregue M. Feldmann G. Laplane R. Arch.

Consistent with this hypothesis was the finding that the affected protein in AE, hZIP4, and the murine homolog, mZIP4, are most abundantly expressed in the small intestine (8Wang K. Zhou B. Kuo Y.M. Zemansky J. Gitschier J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 66-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), and the mZIP4 protein is located at the apical membrane of intestinal enterocytes in zinc-deficient mice (8Wang K. Zhou B. Kuo Y.M. Zemansky J. Gitschier J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 66-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 19Dufner-Beattie J. Wang F. Kuo Y.M. Gitschier J. Eide D. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33474-33481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Moreover, mZIP4 has been shown to stimulate zinc uptake when expressed in the human embryonic kidney cell line, HEK293 (19Dufner-Beattie J. Wang F. Kuo Y.M. Gitschier J. Eide D. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33474-33481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Patients with AE provide in vivo evidence of the importance of hZIP4 in dietary zinc uptake; however, skin fibroblast cell lines derived from AE patients also display zinc deficiency phenotypes and have reduced zinc uptake (20Vazquez F. Grider A. Biol. Trace Elem. Res. 1995; 50: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 21Grider A. Lin Y.F. Muga S.J. Biol. Trace Elem. Res. 1998; 61: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that hZIP4 is likely to function in the uptake of zinc in a variety of cell types.The importance of mammalian ZIP4 in dietary and cellular zinc uptake has prompted recent studies investigating whether the expression of the mZIP4 gene is regulated by zinc availability. Studies using mice have established that mZIP4 mRNA levels in the small intestine and embryonic visceral yolk sac are induced under conditions of dietary zinc deficiency, suggesting that the transcription or stability of mZIP4 mRNA is regulated by zinc availability (19Dufner-Beattie J. Wang F. Kuo Y.M. Gitschier J. Eide D. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33474-33481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated whether the mZIP4 protein is regulated by zinc availability. Using transfected HEK293 cells, a functional hemagglutinin antigen (HA)-tagged form of the mZIP4 protein was localized in cytoplasmic vesicles within the perinuclear region of the cell. There was considerable overlap between mZIP4-HA and the transferrin receptor in recycling endosomes, and mZIP4-HA was shown to cycle via the plasma membrane. Significantly, zinc deficiency conditions resulted in the accumulation of the transporter at the plasma membrane, and this was associated with increased zinc uptake activity. The addition of low micromolar zinc concentrations stimulated the rapid endocytosis of mZIP4-HA. The endocytosis of mZIP4-HA was also stimulated by manganese, cobalt, and cadmium, although this required higher concentrations relative to zinc. Notably, a zinc-responsive localization was also found for the hZIP4 protein. These findings suggest that zinc-regulated trafficking of human and mouse ZIP4 is a key mechanism controlling dietary zinc absorption and cellular zinc homeostasis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents, Cell Lines, and Antibodies—HEK293 cells expressing either the HA-tagged mZIP4 protein or pcDNA3.1-puromycin vector, were isolated after transfection using the LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). The hZIP4 cDNA cloned into the pcDNA3.1-puromycin vector was kindly provided by Jane Gitschier (UCSF) and tagged at the carboxyl terminus with the HA epitope using PCR and standard molecular biology protocols. Puromycin-resistant cells were established by the selection of transfected cells with 2 μg/ml puromycin in the growth medium (Sigma). mZIP4-HA expression was analyzed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy using the polyclonal rabbit anti-HA antibody (Sigma). All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin in a 5% CO2,37 °C incubator. This medium contains ∼2 μm Zn2+. Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Alexa-488 and -588 antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes. Transferrin receptor antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-tubulin antibodies, methyl-β cyclodextrin (MCD), Chelex 100, and N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN) were from Sigma. Zinc depletion of 10% fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was performed using Chelex 100 prepared as described previously with minor modifications (22Messer H.H. Murray E.J. Goebel N.K. J. Nutr. 1982; 112: 652-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, a solution of 2% (w/v) Chelex 100 resin in 10% fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was incubated overnight with constant stirring followed by filtration through a 0.2-μm filter.Immunoblot Analysis of mZIP4-HA Protein—Cells cultured in 25-cm2 flasks were scraped into ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and pelleted by centrifugation. After several washes in ice-cold PBS, the cells were lysed by sonication in lysis buffer containing 62 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mix (Roche Applied Science). Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g, and 20-μg protein lysates were separated using 4–20% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and detected by chemiluminescence using anti-HA antibodies (1:1,000) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5,000).Immunofluorescence Microscopy to Assess Surface and Intracellular Pools of mZIP4-HA Protein—Cells were grown in 24-well trays for 24 h on sterile glass coverslips. In some experiments, TPEN and/or zinc (as ZnCl2) was added to the medium at indicated concentrations and times. To detect the total pool of mZIP4-HA protein, cells were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS and fixed for 10 min at 25 °C using 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, blocked for 1 h with 1% bovine serum albumin and 3% skim milk in PBS, and then probed with the anti-HA antibodies (1:1,000) followed by Alexa-488 anti-mouse antibodies (1:1,000). Samples were viewed with a 60× objective using a Leica DMRE microscope fitted with a Retiga Ex digital camera. To label only the surface pool of mZIP4-HA, the Triton X-100 permeabilization step was omitted, and fixed cells were blocked and probed with the anti-HA and Alexa-488 antibodies as described above. Immunofluorescence analysis of mZIP4-HA endocytosis was assessed by detecting the uptake of anti-HA antibodies from basal medium, medium containing 10 μm TPEN, or medium containing both 10 μm TPEN and 10 μm ZnCl2. Briefly, cells were pregrown in basal medium, chilled on ice to inhibit protein trafficking, and then incubated for the indicated times in the above medium at 37 °C in the presence of 2 μg/ml anti-HA antibodies. Cells were then transferred to ice to prevent further trafficking of mZIP4-HA, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and the surface-bound antibodies were removed by three incubations for 2 min in 2 ml of acidic buffer on ice (100 mm glycine, 20 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm potassium chloride, pH 2.2). After a further two washes with 2 ml of PBS on ice, the cells were fixed, permeabilized, and processed for immunofluorescence as described above.Detection of mZIP4-HA Protein Levels at the Plasma Membrane—The pool of mZIP4-HA at the plasma membrane was assessed by measuring the levels of anti-HA antibodies bound to the surface of HEK/mZIP4-HA cells. HEK/mZIP4-HA cells were cultured for 24 h in 6-well trays, washed twice with PBS on ice, and fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde without subsequent permeabilization steps. Cells were then blocked using 3% skim milk in PBS and incubated with 5 μg/ml anti-HA antibody for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed five times in PBS to remove unbound antibodies and then lysed by sonication in SDS lysis buffer described above. Cell lysates containing the solubilized anti-HA antibodies that were bound to the mZIP4-HA protein at the plasma membrane were separated using 4–20% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the anti-HA antibodies were then detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (1: 5,000) by chemiluminescence (Roche Applied Science). Tubulin protein levels were detected on parallel immunoblots using anti-tubulin antibodies (1:40,000; Sigma).Assay of Zinc-stimulated mZIP4-HA Endocytosis—The endocytosis of mZIP4-HA was determined by measuring the uptake of anti-HA antibodies added to the cultured medium of HEK/mZIP4-HA cells. Cells were pregrown in 6-well trays for 24 h in basal medium and then incubated for the indicated times at 37 °C in basal medium, Chelextreated medium, or TPEN-containing medium containing 5 μg/ml anti-HA antibodies and the indicated amounts of zinc or other metals. Cells were washed twice with 2 ml of PBS on ice, and surface-bound antibodies were removed by three washes in 2 ml of ice-cold acidic buffer (above). Cells were harvested by scraping into 1 ml of ice-cold PBS and pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 × g. The cell pellets were solubilized in SDS buffer (above), and 20 μg of lysates containing internalized anti-HA antibodies were separated using 4–20% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and detected by chemiluminescence using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, as described above.65Zn Uptake Assays—HEK/mZIP4-HA and HEK/vector cells were seeded in 24-well poly-l-lysine-coated plates 48 h prior to zinc uptake assays. Cells were preincubated for 1 h in basal medium or medium supplemented with 10 μm ZnCl2, 10 μm TPEN, or 10 μm ZnCl2 plus 10 μm TPEN. Cells were then washed with ice-cold uptake buffer (15 mm HEPES, 100 mm glucose, and 150 mm KCl, pH 7.0) and then incubated in prewarmed uptake buffer containing 5 μm65ZnCl2 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a shaking 37 °C water bath for 5 min. Assays were stopped by adding an equal volume of ice-cold uptake buffer supplemented with 1 mm EDTA (stop buffer). Cells were collected on nitrocellulose filters (Millipore; 0.45-μm pore size) and washed three times with 10 ml of stop buffer. Parallel experiments were conducted at 0 °C for cell surface 65Zn binding, which was subtracted from the values at 37 °C to obtain net zinc uptake values. Cell-associated radioactivity was measured with a Packard Auto-Gamma 5650 counter. Zinc uptake was calculated using a standard curve and normalized to protein concentrations of cell lysates.RESULTSWe have demonstrated recently that expression of the mouse ZIP4 cDNA stimulates zinc uptake in transiently transfected HEK293 cells (19Dufner-Beattie J. Wang F. Kuo Y.M. Gitschier J. Eide D. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33474-33481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The initial focus of the present study was to identify the subcellular distribution of the mZIP protein. A HA epitope tag was fused to the carboxyl terminus of mZIP4 to allow detection of the mZIP4-HA protein using anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 1A). The HEK293 cell line was transfected with the mZIP4-HA plasmid construct, and several independent populations of cells expressing mZIP4-HA were isolated by selection with puromycin to generate HEK/mZIP4-HA cells. In each population, ∼80% of the cells stably expressed the mZIP4-HA protein as determined by immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-HA antibodies (data not shown). Western blot analysis using anti-HA antibodies revealed a specific protein in HEK/mZIP4-HA cells which was absent in HEK293 cells transfected with the pcDNA3.1 vector alone (Fig. 1B). The apparent molecular mass of 90 kDa was larger than the expected size of 70 kDa for mZIP4-HA. This discrepancy was likely the result of glycosylation of mZIP4-HA because the expected size was observed when HEK/mZIP4-HA cells were treated with the glycosylation inhibitor, tunicamycin (data not shown). We then investigated whether altered zinc availability could affect the abundance or apparent molecular mass of the mZIP4-HA protein. HEK/mZIP4-HA cells were cultured for 4 h under conditions made zinc-deficient by supplementing the medium with the membrane-permeable zinc chelator, TPEN. However, this treatment did not alter the abundance or electrophoretic mobility of the mZIP4-HA protein (Fig. 1B). The effect of excess zinc (100 μm) in the medium was also tested, and again no apparent changes in abundance or apparent molecular mass of the mZIP4-HA protein were observed (Fig. 1B).We then explored the possibility that the intracellular distribution of mZIP4-HA is regulated by zinc. In HEK/mZIP4-HA cells cultured in basal medium, immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-HA antibodies revealed that mZIP4-HA was distributed in cytoplasmic vesicles that were concentrated in the perinuclear region (Fig. 1C). There was no signal detected in HEK293 cells transfected with the empty vector (data not shown). A striking result was obtained when TPEN was added to the medium for 1 h to generate a zinc-deficient condition. The distribution of mZIP4-HA was shifted toward the periphery of cells, and labeling of the protein at the plasma membrane was clearly apparent (Fig. 1D). This TPEN-induced relocalization of mZIP4-HA was suppressed when equal amounts of zinc and TPEN were added together to the medium (Fig. 1E), suggesting that the redistribution of mZIP4-HA using TPEN alone was likely because of zinc limitation. The redistribution of mZIP4-HA was also observed when HEK/mZIP4-HA cells were cultured in medium from which metals had been previously extracted using the metal-chelating resin, Chelex 100, and this effect was suppressed by replacing zinc (data not shown). These effects of TPEN and Chelex treatments were specific for mZIP4-HA because these treatments did not affect the locations of several proteins known to cycle or reside within endocytic compartments, including the transferrin receptor, the copper transporter, hCtr1, the early endosome marker EEA1, and the ATP7A copper exporter (data not shown). These data suggest that the location of mZIP4-HA is zinc-responsive and that zinc limitation increases its abundance at the plasma membrane.The observation that under basal medium conditions, the mZIP4-HA protein was concentrated in perinuclear vesicles, together with the redistribution to the plasma membrane upon zinc limitation, suggested that a significant fraction of the protein exists in the recycling endosomal compartment. Thus, we investigated whether mZIP4-HA colocalized with the transferrin receptor, a marker of recycling endosomes. In HEK/mZIP4-HA cells cultured in basal medium, the transferrin receptor was located in a perinuclear vesicular compartment (Fig. 2B, green), and there was considerable overlap with the location of mZIP4-HA protein (Fig. 2A, red), as indicated in the merged images (Fig. 2C, yellow). These findings suggested that mZIP4-HA is abundant in recycling endosomes and may cycle between this compartment and the plasma membrane. To investigate further whether mZIP4-HA cycles via the plasma membrane, we tested whether treating cells with an endocytic inhibitor would lead to an increase in the levels of mZIP4-HA at the plasma membrane. HEK/mZIP4-HA cells were incubated in medium containing the general endocytosis inhibitor, MCD, which inhibits both clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytic pathways (23Rodal S.K. Skretting G. Garred O. Vilhardt F. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 961-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). MCD treatment resulted in the accumulation of mZIP4-HA at the cell surface (Fig. 2F). This finding supported the hypothesis that mZIP4-HA cycles between endosomal compartments and the plasma membrane.Fig. 2The mZIP4-HA protein partially colocalizes with the transferrin receptor and cycles via the plasma membrane.A–C, the location of mZIP4 overlaps with the transferrin receptor. HEK/mZIP4-HA cells were grown in basal medium and fixed, permeabilized, and stained with antibodies against the HA epitope (A; red) and transferrin receptor (B; green). Colocalization of mZIP4-HA and the transferrin receptor is indicated by yellow staining in the merged panel (C). D–F, accumulation of mZIP4-HA at the plasma membrane of cells treated with the endocytosis inhibitor, MCD. HEK/mZIP4-HA cells or HEK/vector cells were grown for 30 min in basal medium (D and E) or basal medium containing the endocytic inhibitor, MCD (F). Cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and stained with anti-HA antibodies followed by Alexa-488 secondary antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Our studies then focused on whether zinc limitation resulted in increased levels of mZIP4-HA at the plasma membrane. The extracellular location of the HA epitope at the carboxyl terminus of mZIP4 enabled us to label only the surface fraction of mZIP4-HA protein with anti-HA antibodies. This was achieved by using anti-HA antibodies to probe intact HEK/mZIP4-HA cells that were fixed, but not permeabilized. Weak punctate staining on the surface of HEK/mZIP4-HA cells was observed when these cells were cultured in basal medium (Fig. 3A). The punctate nature of this staining suggested that mZIP4-HA may localize within distinct microdomains of the plasma membrane, as found for other surface proteins (24Nabi I.R. Le P.U. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Notably, in TPEN-treated HEK/mZIP4-HA cells there was a marked increase in the levels of surface-bound anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 3A). This surface staining was specific for mZIP4-HA because there was no labeling of HEK293 cells transfected with the vector alone (Fig. 3A). Together with earlier experiments with permeabilized cells, these data suggested that zinc limitation increases the level of mZIP4-HA at plasma membrane.Fig. 3Zinc limitation increases the level of mZIP4 at the plasma membrane.A, immunofluorescence analysis of surface mZIP4-HA levels after zinc limitation. HEK/mZIP4-HA cells or HEK/vector cells were grown for 30 min in either basal medium or medium containing 10 μm TPEN. Cells were fixed with paraformalde-hyde without permeabilization, blocked, and the surface levels of mZIP4-HA were assessed using anti-HA antibodies followed by Alexa-488 secondary antibodies. B, Western blot analysis of TPEN-induced surface accumulation of mZIP4-HA and reversal upon zinc supplementation. Lanes 1–6, HEK/vector cells or HEK/mZIP4-HA cells were exposed to either basal medium or medium containing 10 μm TPEN for the indicated times. Levels of anti-HA antibodies bound to mZIP4-HA at the plasma membrane were determined using Western blots as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lanes 6–9, HEK/mZIP4-HA cells were pretreated for 60 min in TPEN-containing medium (lane 6) and then exposed to basal medium for the indicated times. Surface levels of mZIP4-HA were determined using Western blots as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As a control, the detection of purified anti-HA antibodies is shown in lane 10.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To demonstrate more quantitatively the increased surface expression of mZIP4-HA in zinc-limited cells, we used an immunoblotting method developed previously to measure changes in surface levels of the hCtr1 copper transporter under conditions of varying copper availability (25Petris M.J. Smith K. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9639-9646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The strategy involved using immunoblots to measure the levels of anti-HA antibodies that were recovered from the surface of intact (i.e. nonpermeabilized) HEK/mZIP4-HA after these cells were probed with anti-HA antibodies. HEK/mZIP4-HA cells were pretreated with cycloheximide to inhibit new protein synthesis. Cells were then were exposed to basal or TPEN-containing medium, fixed with paraformaldehyde, and the intact cells were then probed with the anti-HA antibodies to label mZIP4-HA protein at the plasma membrane. After extensive washing of cells to remove unbound antibodies, the cells were lysed, and the solubilized anti-HA antibodies were detected by Western blotting with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. As a control, the anti-HA antibody was run on the same gel and detected as a single 100 kDa band (Fig. 3B, lane 10). There was a low abundance of mZIP4-HA at the plasma membrane of HEK/mZIP4-HA cells grown in basal medium, as evident from the low levels of surface-bound anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 3B, lane 2). However, the treatment of HEK/mZIP4-HA cells with TPEN resulted in a rapid increase in the levels of anti-HA antibodies bound to the cell surface, indicating increased levels of mZIP4-HA at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3B, lanes 3–6). This increased surface binding of anti-HA antibodies was saturated within 30 min of the addition of TPEN (data not shown). There were no detectable anti-HA antibodies bound to the surface of untreated or TPEN-treated HEK293 cells stably transfected with the empty pcDNA3.1 vector (Fig. 3B, lane 1, and data not shown). These findings confirmed independently the immunofluorescence microscopy results and suggested that zinc limitation increased the level of mZIP4-HA protein at the plasma membrane. Moreover, the rapidity of this response, together with its occurrence in the absence of new protein synthesis, indicated that it involved a post-translational mechanism.We then investigated whether this TPEN-induced accumulation of mZIP4-HA at the plasma membrane was reversible upon the addition of zinc. Starting with HEK/mZIP4-HA cells treated with for 1 h with 10 μm TPEN (Fig. 3B, lane 6), the levels of mZIP4-HA protein at the cell surface were assessed over time following an incubation in medium containing 10 μm zinc. A reduction in surface levels of mZIP4-HA was observed within 2 min of zinc supplementation. This finding suggests that zinc stimulates the rapid removal of mZIP4-HA from the plasma membrane of zinc-limited cells.One explanation for the increased levels of m"

We now show that multiple stress inducers cause the translocation of cytoplasmic CLIC4 to the nucleus. Immunogold electron microscopy and confocal analyses indicate that nuclear CLIC4 is detected prior to the apoptotic phenotype. CLIC4 associates with the Ran, NTF2, and Importin-α nuclear import complexes in immunoprecipitates of lysates from cells treated with apoptotic/stress-inducing agents. Deletion or mutation of the nuclear localization signal in the C terminus of CLIC4 eliminates nuclear translocation, whereas N terminus deletion enhances nuclear localization. Targeting CLIC4 to the nucleus via adenoviral transduction accelerates apoptosis when compared with cytoplasmic CLIC4, and only nuclear-targeted CLIC4 causes apoptosis in Apaf null mouse fibroblasts or in Bcl-2-overexpressing keratinocytes. These results indicate that CLIC4 nuclear translocation is an integral part of the cellular response to stress and may contribute to the initiation of nuclear alterations that are associated with apoptosis.

The cellular functions of CLIC family members may involve organellar volume regulation and ionic homeostasis and regulation of electro-neutrality (1Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2002; 415: 276-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Five of the CLIC proteins are similar in size and highly homologous to the C terminus (CLIC module) of p64 and parchorin, which in addition consist of distinct N-terminal domains (2Ashley R.H. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2003; 20: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). All members have one major hydrophobic stretch in the CLIC module that may be used to span the membrane, but some members are also found in a soluble form in the cytoplasm (3Qian Z. Okuhara D.

Soluble CLIC proteins are structural homologues of soluble omega-class glutathione S-transferase family proteins, and they may behave as an “active” anion channel and/or channel regulator when “autoinserted” to form integral membrane proteins (7Harrop S.J.

Mitochondrial CLIC (mtCLIC/CLIC4) was the first homologue of p64 identified, and its mRNA is ubiquitously expressed with the highest expression in lung, brain, liver, kidney, and skin (8Fernandez-Salas E. Sagar M. Cheng C. Yuspa S.H. Weinberg W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36488-36497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). CLIC4 was described as a mitochondrial and cytoplasmic protein in mouse keratinocytes and localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane in human keratinocytes (9Fernandez-Salas E. Suh K.S. Speransky V.V. Bowers W.L. Levy J.M. Adams T. Pathak K.R. Edwards L.E. Hayes D.D. Cheng C. Steven A.C. Weinberg W.C. Yuspa S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3610-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Other reports indicate CLIC4 is also localized in the trans-Golgi network in pancreatic cells, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in rat hippocampal HT-4 cells, and large dense core vesicles in neurosecretory cells (10Chuang J.Z. Milner T.A. Zhu M. Sung C.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2919-2928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Duncan R.R. Westwood P.K. Boyd A. Ashley R.H. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 163: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Similar to other family members (parchorin, p64, CLIC1, CLIC3), CLIC4 has a putative Cl--selective channel activity exhibiting a single channel conductance (2Ashley R.H. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2003; 20: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). CLIC4 homologues are expressed in many species with 85–95% identity at the amino acid level suggesting physiological functions are evolutionarily conserved (13Shorning B.Y. Wilson D.B. Meehan R.R. Ashley R.H. Dev. Genes Evol. 2003; 213: 514-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). CLIC4 has also been associated with the actin cytoskeleton in membrane ruffles and lamellipodia and interacts dynamically with signaling proteins involved in cell membrane remodeling, including dynaminI, actin, tubulin, and 14-3-3ϵ. O. isoforms in neuronal cells (14Suginta W. Karoulias N. Aitken A. Ashley R.H. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Recently, substantial up-regulation of CLIC4 was reported in transforming growth factor-β and serum-activated human breast fibroblasts, where up-regulation of CLIC4 was associated with transdifferentiation to myofibroblasts (15Ronnov-Jessen L. Villadsen R. Edwards J.C. Petersen O.W. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 471-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have shown that CLIC4 is a direct response gene for p53 transactivation and involved in TNF-α- and p53-mediated signaling pathways. CLIC4 overexpression induces apoptosis associated with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, and caspase activation suggesting that apoptosis is mediated by mitochondrial dysfunction (9Fernandez-Salas E. Suh K.S. Speransky V.V. Bowers W.L. Levy J.M. Adams T. Pathak K.R. Edwards L.E. Hayes D.D. Cheng C. Steven A.C. Weinberg W.C. Yuspa S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3610-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). During the course of our studies on CLIC4 and apoptosis, we have noted that cytoplasmic CLIC4 translocates to the nucleus in cells undergoing p53-mediated apoptosis. Further studies have indicated that nuclear translocation of CLIC4 was detected in cells responding to various stress and apoptotic signals. This dynamic trafficking occurs early after stress signals and is mediated by the nuclear localization signal (NLS) and the nuclear import machineries. When CLIC4 is targeted directly to the nucleus, apoptosis is accelerated and proceeds in the absence of mitochondrial-dependent caspase activation. These results suggest that CLIC4 participates in the stress-induced apoptotic response in several cellular compartments. Keratinocytes were isolated from newborn Balb/C mice and cultured as basal cells in medium with 0.05 mm calcium as described previously (16Dlugosz A.A. Glick A.B. Tennenbaum T. Weinberg W.C. Yuspa S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The non-tumorigenic keratinocyte S1 cell line was derived from normal mouse keratinocytes and maintained in the same medium as primary keratinocytes. The human osteosarcoma-derived p53 Tet-On Saos-2 cell line (17Phillips A.C. Bates S. Ryan K.M. Helin K. Vousden K.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1853-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker) containing 8% fetal bovine serum (Gemini), 20 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen), and addition of 800 ng/ml doxycycline induced p53 transgene expression. Cells were treated with apoptotic/stress inducers adriamycin (17 μm, Sigma), mitomycin (30 μm, Sigma), etoposide (100 μm, Sigma), camptothecin (2 μm, MBL International Corp.), actinomycin D (10 μm, MBL), cycloheximide (100 μm, Sigma), and TNF-α (50 ng/ml, Calbiochem) in culture medium, and the treated cells were harvested at various time points for analysis. Bcl-2 adenovirus was purchased from InVivogen. Apaf-null mouse embryo fibroblasts were a generous gift of Dr. Tak Mak and Dr. Scott Lowe and were cultured as previously described (18Soengas M.S. Alarcon R.M. Yoshida H. Giaccia A.J. Hakem R. Mak T.W. Lowe S.W. Science. 1999; 284: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). All experiments shown were repeated at least twice. Anti-C terminus CLIC4 antibodies were generated, and antisera were affinity-purified by chromatography using the immunogenic peptides as described previously (8Fernandez-Salas E. Sagar M. Cheng C. Yuspa S.H. Weinberg W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36488-36497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The affinity-purified anti-C terminus CLIC4 antibodies are mono-specific for CLIC4 and were used in all experiments, including immunoprecipitation and Western analysis. PBS-washed cells were harvested by adding cell lysis buffer (1% SDS, M-Per (Pierce), Protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 200 μm NaVO3), sheared with 25-gauge needle several times, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 1 h. Cleared lysates were resolved by gradient SDS-PAGE (8–16%), blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the protein expression was analyzed by Western blot. In some experiments, subcellular fractions were isolated as described previously (8Fernandez-Salas E. Sagar M. Cheng C. Yuspa S.H. Weinberg W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36488-36497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies against cytochrome c and LaminA/B (BD Biosciences), actin (Calbiochem), p53 (Oncogene), MARCKS (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Ran (BD Biosciences), NTF2 (BD Transduction Laboratories), Importin-α (Amersham Biosciences), and cytochrome c subunit IV (Molecular Probes) were used at dilutions suggested by the manufacturer. Anti-mouse, -rabbit, and -goat secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) and Super-Signal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) were used for the antigen detection. For immunoprecipitation, cells were washed with cold PBS, lysed in IP buffer (M-Per (Pierce), Protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μm NaVO3, and 1mm NaF), sheared with a 25-gauge needle several times, and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 1 h, and the cleared supernatant was collected as the starting material. The cell lysate (1 mg of total protein) was pre-cleared at 4 °C for 2 h with protein A/G Plus-agarose beads and incubated with the protein A/G beads conjugated with CLIC4 antibody overnight at 4 °C. These beads were washed in IP buffer, centrifuged, resuspended, and boiled prior to electrophoresis. Organelle-targeted CLIC4 Plasmids and Adenoviral Vectors—Full-length CLIC4 open reading frame (ORF) was PCR-amplified with 5′-forward and 3′-reverse primer sets containing SalI and NotI restriction sites, respectively. The amplified DNA fragment was gel-purified, ligated to pGEM-Teasy vector (CLIC4-Teasy, Promega), and then resub-cloned into the cytoplasm (Cyt)-, mitochondria (Mit)-, and nucleus (Nuc)-targeted vectors (pShooter vectors, Invitrogen) in-frame with the C terminus “myc-tag” using methods suggested by the manufacturer. Insert in-frame fusion integrity, orientation, and organelle-targeting capability were confirmed by DNA sequencing, restriction analysis, and confocal microscopy, respectively. Organelle-specific CLIC4 constructs were subsequently used as templates to generate organelle-targeted CLIC4 adenovirus. To construct these adenoviral vectors, pCMV Forward and pcDNA3.1/BGH Reverse primers (Invitrogen) were used to amplify the organelle-specific CLIC4 DNA fragment and ligated to pGEM-Teasy (T-Shooter-CLIC4). NotI-digested and gel-purified inserts from T-Shooter-CLIC4 were subcloned into NotI-digested pTRE-Shuttle vector (pTRE-Shooter, BD Biosciences). Insert integrity, orientation, and tetracycline inducibility were confirmed by DNA sequencing, restriction digestion, and Western blot analysis, respectively. Shooter-CLIC4 inserts were isolated from pTRE-Shooter vectors by I-CeuI/PISceI digestion and ligated to the pAdeno-X vector (BD Biosciences) using methods suggested by the manufacturer. Adenoviruses were amplified in the Science Applications International Corp., Inc., Frederick, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Molecular Biology, Gene Expression Laboratory. Deletion Mutant Constructs—Three of the 5′ forward primers and four of the 3′ reverse primers that are specific to various regions of mouse CLIC4 were synthesized to generate deletion mutant constructs. Forward primers included 5′-GGCCATG-3′ in the upstream of the CLIC4 gene-specific sequence to provide sufficient Kozak motif and the starting methionine codon. PCR-amplified fragments were agarose gel-purified and ligated to pcDNA5/FRT/V5-His-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and the positive clones were screened and verified by PCR, DNA sequencing, and restriction digestion analysis. Inducible deletion mutants were constructed by using a T7-promoter forward and BGH reverse primer set (Invitrogen) to PCR-amplify CLIC4-V5-His inserts. Amplified DNA fragments were agarose gel-purified and ligated to pcDNA5/FRT/TO-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and the positive clones were screened and verified with the methods mentioned above, including Western blots and confocal microscopy. Deletion mutant CLIC4 proteins were induced in transfected cells with Tet-On (+Dox) or Tet-Off (-Dox) adenovirus (Clontech) infection, and the mutant proteins were expressed at desired levels by controlling the viral multiplicity of infection. NLS Mutagenesis—Full-length CLIC4 ORF from CLIC4-Teasy plasmid was digested with NotI, agarose-gel purified, and subcloned into NotI site of pAlterMax (CLIC4-AlterMax, Promega) in-frame with the N terminus HA tag (wild-type CLIC4). Insert orientation and integrity was determined by DNA sequencing, restriction analysis, and Western blotting. NLS mutagenesis primer (5′-GCTCCACATTGTCACGGTGGTGGCCATAACATACGGCAACTTTGATATTCC-3′) was designed to substitute four amino acids (lysine and arginine) in the NLS motif (KVVAKKYR to TVVAITYG) to obliterate the motif consensus sequence. The primer was synthesized and PAGE-purified (Invitrogen). The mutagenesis was performed as described by the manufacturer, and the mutated CLIC4 (-NLS CLIC4) was verified by DNA sequencing and Western blotting. SigmaStat (SSPS Science) was used as a statistical analysis program for all data represented by multiple numerical measurements. FACS Analysis—LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) alone or with null (empty)-Adenovirus as a carrier was used to transfect plasmids into cell lines as described previously (9Fernandez-Salas E. Suh K.S. Speransky V.V. Bowers W.L. Levy J.M. Adams T. Pathak K.R. Edwards L.E. Hayes D.D. Cheng C. Steven A.C. Weinberg W.C. Yuspa S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3610-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Primary keratinocytes and S1 cells transfected or infected with organelle-targeted CLIC4 vectors were analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences). At various times after transfection or infection, cells were trypsinized and collected in 1 ml of medium and assayed in the presence or absence of propidium iodide (0.5 μg/ml, PI). AnnexinV—Transfected cultures were analyzed for the presence of cell surface annexinV as a measure of apoptotic death. Briefly, cells were trypsinized from dishes at specific times after transfection, centrifuged and incubated with an allophycocyanin-conjugated annexinV (BD Biosciences) as described by the manufacturer. Cells were then washed, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 10 min, diluted in buffer, and analyzed by flow cytometry. To analyze annexinV staining by confocal microscopy, cells were cultured in 60-mm plates, initially stained with propidium iodide/PBS (2 μg/ml) for 2 min, washed with PBS once, then stained with annexinV reagents (BD Biosciences) as described by the manufacturer. Stained cells were fixed using 2% paraformaldehyde dissolved in annexinV-binding buffer (BD Biosciences), washed with PBS ten times, mounted with fluorescent protective medium (Dako), and analyzed using the Zeiss-510 confocal microscope (Zeiss). The annexinV-positive cells were manually counted from the confocal micrograph and divided by the number of Hoechst-stained cells to generate the percentage of annexinV-positive cells. Eight randomly picked fields were used to generate the average percentage of the annexinV-positive cells for each treatment. TUNEL—Cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and then washed with PBS several times. After dehydrating the surface of the plate with methanol, quadrants were drawn on plates using a PAP pen, washed with PBS ten times, and then the fixed cells were rehydrated with PBS. The cells were permeabilized using PBS/0.1% Triton X-100 solution for 10 min, then washed twice with PBS, and a TUNEL assay (Roche Applied Science) was performed as described by the manufacturer. Stained cells were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratory) and analyzed by confocal microscopy. The average percentage of TUNEL-positive cells was quantified using the random field method as described for the annexinV assay. Active Caspase3 Assay—Primary keratinocytes were infected with organelle-targeted CLIC4 adenovirus, harvested at 16 h post-infection, and subjected to caspase3 assay (BioVision) as described by the manufacturer. Fluorescence was measured by using a fluorometric plate reader (fMax, Molecular Devices). Cells were fixed on culture dishes in 2% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 30 min and extensively washed with PBS. Fixed cells were permeabilized with cold methanol for 6 min, and dried briefly, and desired quadrants were drawn using a PAP pen. Cells were re-hydrated and extensively washed with PBS, treated in 100 mm glycine for 30 min, equilibrated with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min, washed with PBS, and then blocked for 1 h or overnight in 0.5% bovine serum albumin/PBS. The cells were incubated with primary antibody of interest for 2 h, washed three times with PBS, and incubated in the dark with secondary antibody for 1 h. The plates were washed three times in PBS, treated with Hoechst nuclear stain/PBS (1 μg/ml) for 3 min, washed three times with PBS, and finally washed twice with ddH2O for 3 min. Plates were mounted with fluorescent protective mounting solution (Dako), and cells were analyzed with the Zeiss-510 confocal microscope. Post embedding immunoelectron microscopy (19Tobin G.J. Li G.H. Fong S.E. Nagashima K. Gonda M.A. Virology. 1997; 236: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was performed using LR White resin (Polysciences, Inc.) slightly modified from the manufacture's procedures. Briefly, cell pellets were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Tousimis Research) in PBS for 2 h, rinsed in cold PBS, dehydrated in a series of ice-cold graded ethanol, infiltrated in 1:1 mixture of 100% ice-cold ethanol and LR White resin, then in pure LR White resin overnight in 4 °C, and cured at 55 °C for 24 h. Thin sections were mounted on 200-mesh nickel grids and incubated in a serial dilution of primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. The grids were washed with PBS containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20 for 2 h, then incubated in 1:100 dilution of immunogoldconjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at room temperature. The grids were washed as above and stained in uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The digital images were obtained with an electron microscope (Hitachi H7000) equipped with a digital camera system (Gatan). A Variety of Stress-inducing Agents Cause Endogenous CLIC4 Nuclear Translocation in Keratinocytes—In resting keratinocytes, ∼60% of CLIC4 is localized in the perinuclear area in mitochondria and 40% is cytosolic (8Fernandez-Salas E. Sagar M. Cheng C. Yuspa S.H. Weinberg W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36488-36497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To determine if CLIC4 intracellular localization was altered in stressed cells, agents that are DNA-damaging, metabolic inhibitors or cytotoxic were tested on primary mouse keratinocytes. Translocation of endogenous CLIC4 from the cytoplasmic compartment into the nucleus was detected in virtually all of the cells (see inset for cell density) after DNA-damaging agents (etoposide, adriamycin, and mitomycin), metabolic inhibitors (cycloheximide and actinomycin D), camptothecin, and TNF-α (Fig. 1A). Time required for the nuclear translocation was different for each chemical treatment (Fig. 1, legend). Nevertheless, the translocation occurred prior to appearance of apoptotic bodies indicating that endogenous CLIC4 nuclear translocation may be a common event preceding the cellular response to stress. When apoptosis-inducing chemicals were used at higher concentrations, the nuclear translocation occurred more rapidly (data not shown). Within the limits of confocal analysis, the level of endogenous mitochondrial CLIC4 did not appear to be altered. CLIC4 antibody is a monospecific anti-peptide and affinity-purified antibody, and the immunostained signal can be eliminated with the addition of blocking peptide (data not shown), indicating the confocal image of immunostained CLIC4 is not an artifact. Exogenous HA-CLIC4 (see Fig. 4C) and GFPCLIC4 (Fig. 1B) fusion proteins also translocated to the nucleus upon TNF-α or etoposide treatment, further supporting physical translocation of CLIC4 from the cytosol to the nucleus after stimuli. In contrast, cytoplasmic or nuclear-targeted GFP were localized in the appropriate intracellular compartment and did not migrate to the nucleus in response to TNF-α or etoposide treatment (Fig. 1B). Typically, greater than a 7-fold increase of endogenous CLIC4 nuclear content was detected by subcellular fractionation early after treatment of primary keratinocytes with TNF-α or etoposide (Fig. 1C), supporting the confocal microscopy data. However, we do not see a corresponding decrease of cytosolic CLIC4 in the fractionation experiments as suggested in the confocal analysis. This could be due to residual mitochondrial contamination of the cytosolic fraction or reflect a concentration difference within the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm resulting in more intense nuclear staining by microscopy. Alternatively, nuclei from a stressed cell might be leaky during the subcellular fractionation procedure.Fig. 4CLIC4 nuclear translocation is regulated by N terminus transmembrane domain (TM) and C terminus nuclear localization signal (NLS).A, series of CLIC4 deletion mutant proteins with “His-V5 C terminus tag” (designated with the shaded circle) were constructed. The constructs shown here include wild-type (Full), lacking NLS domain (-NLS), missing the C terminus half (-C), lacking N terminus TM (-TM), and missing the N terminus half (-N). B, S1 keratinocytes were transfected with the deletion constructs and 36 h later they received no other treatment (-TNF) or were exposed to TNF-α (+TNF) for 2 h, and CLIC4 subcellular localization was detected by immunostaining with anti-V5 antibody, followed by confocal microscopy. C, the CLIC4-NLS mutant construct (HA-CLIC4ΔNLS) with “HA N terminus tag” containing four amino acid substitutions at the NLS motif (KVVAKKYR to TVVAITYG) was used to transfect S1 keratinocytes, followed by TNF-α (4 h) or etoposide (6 h) exposure at 24 h post-transfection. Subcellular location was detected by immunostaining using HA tag antibody and confocal microscopy. Hoechst nuclear staining is represented in the inset. D, S1 keratinocytes transfected with deletion mutant plasmid constructs were assayed by AnnexinV or TUNEL at 24 h post-transfection, and the apoptotic cells were detected by confocal microscopy. The average percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated by manually counting AnnexinV- or TUNEL-positive cells from eight random fields of confocal images.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Endogenous CLIC4 Translocates to the Nucleus in Human Osteosarcoma Cells Undergoing p53-mediated Apoptosis—The human CLIC4 promoter contains functional p53-binding elements, and CLIC4 is up-regulated during doxycycline-induced p53-mediated apoptosis in p53 Tet-On Saos-2 cells (9Fernandez-Salas E. Suh K.S. Speransky V.V. Bowers W.L. Levy J.M. Adams T. Pathak K.R. Edwards L.E. Hayes D.D. Cheng C. Steven A.C. Weinberg W.C. Yuspa S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3610-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In response to doxycycline treatment, endogenous CLIC4 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus within 24 h, a time when these cells enter the apoptotic program (Fig. 1D). Thus CLIC4 nuclear translocation is associated with apoptosis induced through an endogenous pathway as well as from treatment with exogenous cytotoxic agents. The response is also detected in human cells as well as murine cells. Because endogenous CLIC4 nuclear translocation also occurs in p53 null cell lines (Saos-2 and Ak1B) following TNF-α or etoposide, that translocation itself is a p53 independent event (Ref. 8Fernandez-Salas E.

Endogenous CLIC4 Physically Interacts with the Nuclear Transport Complexes during the Nuclear Translocation Process—Treatment of mouse keratinocytes with TNF-α or etoposide induced an interaction of endogenous CLIC4 with Ran, Importin-α, and NTF-2 (Fig. 2A). Nuclear transport factor (NTF)-2 is an active component of the nuclear import machinery, suggesting that CLIC4 is transported into the nucleus by an NTF-2 nuclear transport complex. Reverse immunoprecipitation verified the physical interaction of CLIC4 with Ran, Importin-α, and NFT-2 (data not shown). In Saos-2 cells (data not shown) and mouse keratinocytes, a low level of interaction with NTF-2 and Ran can also be detected in untreated cells, and the interaction with Importin-α may be constitutive (Fig. 2A), suggesting that nuclear trafficking may be occurring to some extent in resting cells. Confocal images and cell fractionation both suggest a low level of nuclear CLIC4 is constitutive, particularly in p53 Tet-On Saos cells (Fig. 1D). Confocal analyses sh"

All three share a common pattern of localization, and it was recently demonstrated that aurora-B, INCENP, and survivin are present in a complex in Xenopus eggs and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The presence of aurora-B kinase in the complex and its ability to bind the other components directly suggest that INCENP and survivin could potentially be aurora-B substrates. This hypothesis was recently proven for INCENP in vitro. Here we report that human survivin is specifically phosphorylated in vitro by aurora-B kinase at threonine 117 in its carboxyl α-helical coil. Mutation of threonine 117 to alanine prevents survivin phosphorylation by aurora-B in vitro but does not alter its localization in HeLa cells. By contrast, a phospho-mimic, in which threonine 117 was mutated to glutamic acid, was unable to localize correctly at any stage in mitosis. Mutation at threonine 117 also prevented immunoprecipitation of INCENP with survivin in vivo. These data suggest that phosphorylation of survivin at threonine 117 by aurora-B may regulate targeting of survivin, and possibly the entire passenger complex, in mammals.

It is broadly assumed that the active component in the passenger complex is the aurora-B kinase. Although the consensus phosphorylation sites for some kinases are known, a reliable consensus motif for aurora-B remains to be determined. Recently a consensus signature for the yeast aurora-kinase, Ipl1, was determined, as (K/R)X(S/T)(I/L/V) (where X is any residue (4Cheeseman I.M. Anderson S. Jwa M. Green E.M. Kang J. Yates J.R.

A different consensus has been observed for phosphorylation of INCENP by aurora-B, where it has been proposed that the phosphoacceptor residue is immediately preceded by two tandem basic residues (13Honda R. Korner R. Nigg E.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3325-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). However, a consensus sequence for aurora-B is still being developed. INCENP is phosphorylated by aurora-B in its conserved carboxyl IN-box (13Honda R. Korner R. Nigg E.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3325-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 14Bishop J.D. Schumacher J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 4: 27577-27580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at these sites also stimulates aurora-B kinase activity, suggesting a positive feedback loop. However, a multiple alanine mutant incapable of being phosphorylated did not act as a dominant-negative mutant (13Honda R. Korner R. Nigg E.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3325-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Xenopus and fission yeast survivin have also been shown to enhance the activity of aurora-B (3Bolton M.A. Lan W. Powers S.E.

Cell. 2003; 14: 3325-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Ark1 (aurora) can phosphorylate fragments of Bir1 (survivin) in vitro (15Leverson J.D. Huang H.-K. Forsburg S.L. Hunter T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1132-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, to date, there is no evidence that survivin is a substrate of aurora-B in higher eukaryotes. Here we report that aurora-B phosphorylates survivin in vitro at a site that is important for the in vivo localization of survivin in human cells. Molecular Biology and Preparation of Recombinant Proteins—All constructs were made by PCR with Pfu-turbo (Stratagene) or vent (New England Biolabs) using standard methods and subcloned into pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences), pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), pEGFP (Clontech) as indicated. Constitutively inactive aurora-B kinase, aurora-BK106R, and the survivin point mutations, survivinT117A and survivinT117E, were created using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All constructs were confirmed by automated sequencing. Recombinant GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 by a 3-h induction with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C (for aurora-B) and a 3-h induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C (for survivin). GST-tagged proteins were purified from bacteria using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) as described in Ref. 6Wheatley S.P. Carvalho A. Vagnarelli P. Earnshaw W.C. Curr.

GST-aurora-B kinase and GST-aurora-BK106R were similarly eluted, dialyzed overnight against three changes of 50% glycerol in 50% buffer (100 mm HEPES, 50 mm EGTA, 1 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 20 mm MgCl2, 50 mm sucrose, pH 7.7), and then stored at -20 °C.

Briefly, 2.5 μg of substrate and 2 μg aurora-B kinase or aurora-BK106R were used/20-μl reaction. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and stopped by boiling samples in Laemmli buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol. Reactions were run on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed overnight. Gels were then dried and exposed to Kodak autoradiography OMAX film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Mass Spectrometry—Protein identification was accomplished by peptide mass fingerprinting and sequence data base searching (18Jensen O.N. Larsen M.R. Roepstorff P. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1998; 2: 74-89Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein samples were phosphorylated in vitro as detailed above, run on SDS-PAGE, and isolated by band excision after staining with colloidal Coomassie (Pierce). In-gel digestion of protein with 12.5 ng/μl trypsin (Promega) in 50 mm NH4HCO3, 5 mm CaCl2 was performed as described previously (19Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7820) Google Scholar), and then samples were desalted and concentrated using miniaturized sample desalting/concentration techniques (20Gobom J. Nordhoff E. Mirgorodskaya E. Ekman R. Roepstorff P. J. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 34: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed using a PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager DE™STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix. For accurate mass determination, we used a Micromass Q-TOF (Waters Corp.) in nanospray mode with 50/50 acetonitrile/water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as a solvent. Peptide ion signals were assigned to an accuracy of <50 ppm and examined against the NCBI protein sequence data base using the MS-Fit tool (prospector.ucsf.edu/ucsfhtml4.0/msfit.htm). Cell Culture, Transfection, and Microscopy—Adherent HeLa cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin. To isolate stable cell lines expressing GFP-tagged forms of survivin, HeLa cells were resuspended to 5 × 106 cells/ml in Optimem (0.4 ml/transfection), transferred to 0.4-mm cuvettes (Bio-Rad), and electroporated in the presence of 10-20 μg of GFP-tagged pcDNA3.1 constructs (0.3 kV, 0.975 microfarads; Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II). Clones were then grown in the presence of G418, and expression of GFP was assessed by fluorescence microscopy. All tissue culture reagents were from Invitrogen (Invitrogen). Cells expressing GFP-tagged constructs were fixed for 5 min with 4% formaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized by a 2-min treatment with 0.15% Triton-X-100 in PBS, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, and then immunoprobed with anti-aurora-B (AIM1, 1/250, BD Biosciences) followed by Texas Red anti-mouse secondary (1/100, Vector ESP). Cells were then washed in PBS and stained with 1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 10 min. All solutions were prewarmed to 37 °C. TIFF images were collected with IP Lab Software, using a CCD camera (model RTEA, Princeton Instruments inc.) fitted to a Zeiss Axoplan 2 microscope (Objective ×100, NA 1.4). Immunoprecipitation—HeLa cells were seeded at 2 × 106 cells/10-cm Petri dish. To arrest cultures in mitosis (as indicated), colcemid (Sigma) was added 24 h after seeding. Cells were harvested 36 h after seeding and incubated for 30 min in 500 μl of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8), 137 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholate with 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 μg/ml each of the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, pepstatin A). Cleared lysates were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 2.5 μg of monoclonal anti-GFP (3E6, Molecular Probes) with occasional mixing. Protein G- (or A)-Sepharose beads were then added (250 μl of a 20% slurry in lysis buffer), and samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Samples were then washed and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were first incubated with secondary antibodies alone to identify non-specific and IgG bands. Loading and immunoprecipitation efficiency was determined by immunoprobing with polyclonal anti-survivin antibody (1/500, Abcam), as described in (7Carvalho A. Carmena M. Sambade C. Earnshaw W.C. Wheatley S.P. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2987-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Membranes were immunoprobed with anti-aurora-B (1/250, AIM1; BD Biosciences) and anti-INCENP (1/500, 1186) as indicated. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were used at 1/10,000 diluted in 3% milk in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20. Labeling was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). In Vivo [32P]Phosphate Labeling of Cells—Phosphorylation levels were assessed as described in Ref. 21Ashcroft M. Kubbutat M.H. Voudsen K.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 1751-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar. HeLa cell lines stably expressing survivin-GFP or survivinT117AGFP were plated at 1 × 106 cells/10-cm Petri dish. The following day, each culture was transfected with 6 μg of cDNA encoding pEGFP, or pEGFP-aurora-B kinase using FuGENE 6, according to the instructions (Roche Applied Science). Transfection was estimated at 40-60% as judged using a parallel HeLa culture that was previously expressing no other GFP construct. Forty-eight hours later, cultures were treated for 16 h with 100 ng/ml colcemid to induce a mitotic arrest (as indicated). Cells were then washed twice with 10 ml of phosphate-free medium (DME, Sigma), incubated at 37 °C for 4 h with phosphate-free medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum (PAA Laboratories), 0.75% sodium bicarbonate, 25 mm HEPES, and 1 mCi of 32P-labeled sodium orthophosphate (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were then harvested, and immunoprecipitation was performed as described above with the exception that phosphatase inhibitors NaF (50 mm), ZnCl2 (2 mm), and β-glycerophosphate (1 mm) were included. Phosphorylation levels were assessed by autoradiography and PhosphorImager analysis (Storm 860 PhosphorImager, Amersham Biosciences). To assess loading, blots were immunoprobed with polyclonal anti-survivin antibody (1/500, Abcam), as described above. Survivin is an Aurora-B Substrate in Vitro—To determine whether aurora-B can phosphorylate survivin, we performed an in vitro kinase assay using recombinant GST-aurora-B and GST-survivin. As shown in Fig. 1, GST-aurora-B phosphorylated GST-survivin (lane 1) but not GST alone (lane 2). To demonstrate that the phosphorylation was due to the activity of aurora-B and not a contaminating kinase, we expressed and purified a kinase-inactive form of aurora-B, GST-aurora-BK106R. No phosphorylation of GST-survivin was detected when GST-aurora-BK106R was substituted for the wild-type protein in the kinase assay (lane 3). Aurora-B Phosphorylates Threonine 117 in the Carboxyl Terminus of Survivin—To map the aurora-B phosphoacceptor site(s) on survivin, we constructed a number of GST fusions, including two truncation mutants (1-90 and 98-142), and a series of survivin GST-peptides of ∼30 amino acids (1-30, 30-67, 60-90, 90-120, 108-142). In an in vitro kinase assay, aurora-B phosphorylated the carboxyl (98-142) half of survivin but not the amino-terminal end (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2). Phosphorylation of survivin was also detected in amino acid stretches 90-120 and 108-142 (Fig. 2A, lanes 6 and 7). These data are summarized schematically in Fig. 2B. Within these regions there are three putative phosphorylation sites, threonines 97, 117, and 127. Common to all phosphorylated constructs is threonine residue 117 (Fig. 2B, red bar). Interestingly, of the three putative phosphorylation sites, threonine 117 and its flanking amino acids most closely resemble the Ipl1 consensus sequence (4Cheeseman I.M. Anderson S. Jwa M. Green E.M. Kang J. Yates J.R. II II Chan C.S. Drubin D.G. Barnes G. Cell. 2002; 111: 163-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), although this residue is not tightly conserved outside mammals (Fig. 2C). In parallel with the in vitro labeling of survivin fragments, we used a mass spectrometry approach to identify the aurora-B phosphorylation site(s) on survivin (Table I). Using these methods, we obtained sequence coverage of 58% for survivin and 70% for GST. When full-length recombinant GST-fused human survivin was phosphorylated in vitro using GST-aurora-B, MALDI-TOF analysis revealed peptides that corresponded exactly with the non-phosphorylated forms but not with the phosphorylated forms for peptides containing both Thr97 and Thr127. By contrast, a peptide covering residue Thr117 was present only in the phosphorylated form (116ET(phospho)NNK120). This peptide was found in a non-phosphorylated form when the same reaction was prepared using GST-aurora-BK106R, instead of GST-aurora-B (data not shown). The MALDI-TOF data were verified using nanoelectrospray ionization with the Q-TOF tandem mass spectrometer (data not shown). We conclude that the primary in vitro aurora-B phosphorylation site on survivin is residue Thr117.Table IMassfinger printing of human survivin carboxyl-terminal peptide sequences Residues of interest are bold and underlined.Peptide sequencePeptide massIdentified?Phosphopeptide massIdentified?Thr9791KQFEELTLGEFLK1031581.8522Yes1661.8185No92QFEELTLGEFLK1031453.7573Yes1533.7236NoThr117116ETNNK120605.2889No685.2552YesThr127122KEFEETAK129981.4887Yes1061.4550No123EFEETAKK130981.4887Yes1061.4550NoAla117116EANNK120575.2783YesNAaNA, not applicableNA113IAKEANNK120887.4945YesNANAa NA, not applicable Open table in a new tab To confirm these data, we mutated threonine 117 to alanine. In agreement with our prediction, aurora-B did not phosphorylate GST-survivinT117Ain vitro, as determined by autoradiography (Fig. 2D, lane 2) and corroborated by mass spectrometric analysis (Table I, Ala117). Threonine 117 Is Critical for Survivin Localization in Vivo—To begin to determine the functional significance of threonine 117 phosphorylation in the cell, we made GFP fusion constructs of survivin bearing point mutations that prevent (T117A) or mimic (T117E) phosphorylation. When introduced into adherent HeLa cells, GFP-tagged survivinT117A localized normally at all stages of mitosis (Fig. 3A). By contrast, localization of survivinT117E-GFP was disrupted throughout mitosis. The protein was dispersed throughout the cytoplasm and was excluded from the chromosomes (Fig. 3B). In the presence of survivinT117E-GFP, all stages of mitosis were observed, and aurora-B (Fig. 3B) and endogenous survivin (data not shown) localized normally. These data suggest that, to localize correctly, survivin must not be phosphorylated at threonine 117. Furthermore, because the endogenous aurora-B kinase localized correctly in cells expressing the diffusely localized survivinT117E, this suggests that the kinase is not targeted incorrectly by this survivin mutant, i.e. that the mutant does not exert a dominant-negative effect (Fig. 3B). Threonine 117 Mutants Cannot Associate with INCENP in Vivo—Next we used immunoprecipitation to determine whether the association of survivin with its partner proteins INCENP and aurora-B kinase was impaired in threonine 117 mutants. GFP-tagged versions of survivin were immunoprecipitated from mitotic HeLa cells stably expressing survivin-GFP, survivinT117A-GFP, or survivinT117E-GFP using anti-GFP antibodies. Blots from these immunoprecipitations were probed with antibodies against INCENP and aurora-B. As shown in Fig. 4A, survivin-GFP formed a complex with INCENP in vivo (lane 2), but survivinT117A-GFP and survivinT117E-GFP lysates did not (lanes 3 and 4, respectively). By contrast, aurora-B was present in all immunoprecipitations, although it was noted that some aurora-B associated with the negative control (data not shown). These observations offer an important insight into the role of survivin in the chromosomal passenger complex (see below). Survivin Is Phosphorylated in Vivo—To determine whether survivin is phosphorylated in vivo, we labeled cells expressing GFP-tagged versions of both survivin and aurora-B kinase with [32P]phosphorus. This enabled us to immunoprecipitate both proteins from the cultures using anti-GFP antibodies and to use aurora-B autophosphorylation as a positive control. As shown in Fig. 4B, phosphorylated survivin-GFP was detected both in cells expressing GFP and in cells expressing GFP-aurora-B (lanes 1 and 3). This phosphorylation is likely to be at a residue(s) other than Thr117, as survivinT117A-GFP was also phosphorylated (lane 4), and wild-type survivin-GFP phosphorylation was unaffected either by overexpression of active GFP-aurora-B (activity demonstrated by the presence of autophosphorylated species (lane 2, asterisk)) or by expression of kinase-dead aurora-B (lane 3). We conclude that although survivin is a phosphoprotein, phosphorylation on Thr117, if it occurs in vivo, either happens during a very limited window of the cell cycle or occurs at low levels undetectable by these assays. INCENP stimulates the activity of its partner aurora kinase in vitro, as shown for Ipl1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (22Kang J.-S. Cheeseman I.M. Kallstrom G. Velmurugan S. Barnes G. Chan C.S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 155: 763-774Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar), AIR-2/aurora-B in Caenorhabditis elegans (14Bishop J.D. Schumacher J.M. J. Biol.

Cell. 2003; 14: 3325-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Furthermore, INCENP is phosphorylated by its aurora partner (14Bishop J.D. Schumacher J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 4: 27577-27580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 22Kang J.-S. Cheeseman I.M. Kallstrom G. Velmurugan S. Barnes G. Chan C.S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 155: 763-774Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and this phosphorylation is required for the enhancement of kinase activity (13Honda R. Korner R. Nigg E.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3325-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 14Bishop J.D. Schumacher J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 4: 27577-27580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (215) Google Scholar). These observations suggest the existence of a positive feedback mechanism for regulation of aurora kinase activity. It has also been reported that Xenopus survivin stimulates aurora-B activity in vitro (3Bolton M.A. Lan W. Powers S.E. McCleland M.L. Kuang J. Stukenberg P.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3064-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), although this is disputed for the human protein (13Honda R. Korner R. Nigg E.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3325-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). In fission yeast, Bir1/survivin is a substrate of Ark1/aurora (15Leverson J.D. Huang H.-K. Forsburg S.L. Hunter T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1132-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and this also enhances Ark1 activity (16Petersen J. Hagan I.M. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 590-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Aside from these effects on aurora kinase activity, no evidence has yet been obtained for a role of INCENP or survivin phosphorylation on the distinctive localization behavior of the chromosomal passenger proteins in mitosis (1Earnshaw W.C. Bernat R.L. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1991; 100: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Here we report that human survivin is a direct substrate of aurora-B kinase in vitro. Using a combination of molecular dissection and mass spectrometry, we demonstrated that aurora-B phosphorylates survivin on threonine 117. Interestingly, 115KET(N118) shares some similarity with the consensus signature published for budding yeast Ipl1, (K/R)X(S/T)(I/L/V), (where X is any residue (4Cheeseman I.M. Anderson S. Jwa M. Green E.M. Kang J. Yates J.R. II II Chan C.S. Drubin D.G. Barnes G. Cell. 2002; 111: 163-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar)). However, alignment of survivin sequences from a number of species revealed that Thr117 is only conserved amongst the mammals, although Xenopus has a serine at this position (115KFS117) that could also be targeted by aurora-B. Thus, if phosphorylation is important for the regulation of survivin function or localization (see below), this regulation may differ between mammals and other vertebrates. In fact, chicken survivin-GFP, which lacks a phosphoacceptor residue corresponding to Thr-117, does not localize correctly in human cells. 2S. P. Wheatley, A. Carvalho, and W. C. Earnshaw, unpublished observation. Phosphorylation of survivin at Thr117 appears to be important for its localization as a phospho-mimic mutant (survivinT117E) failed to localize to centromeres, whereas a non-phosphorylatable mutant (survivinT117A) localized correctly when expressed in HeLa cells. Interestingly, aurora-B kinase localized normally in cells expressing survivinT117E. As INCENP, aurora-B, and survivin are all mutually dependent for their localization in mitosis (2Adams R.R. Wheatley S.P. Gouldsworthy A.M. Kandels-Lewis S.E. Carmena M. Smythe C. Gerloff D.L. Earnshaw W.C. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1075-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 6Wheatley S.P. Carvalho A. Vagnarelli P. Earnshaw W.C. Curr.

Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2987-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), this observation suggests that survivinT117E must be defective in its ability to interact with aurora-B and/or INCENP; otherwise, the delocalized survivin would have been expected to be associated with the pool of delocalized aurora-B. Prompted by these compelling localization data, we investigated the ability of survivinT117A-GFP and survivinT117E-GFP to interact with INCENP and aurora-B in vivo. Immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP antibodies revealed that although wild-type survivin-GFP associated with INCENP, neither mutant form did. Thus, our data suggest that phosphorylation of survivin at residue Thr-117 by aurora-B kinase may regulate the formation of the chromosomal passenger complex, which is required for correct localization of all three proteins. Importantly, it should be noted that endogenous wild-type survivin is still present in these cells. As survivin is thought to function as a homodimer, and introduction of our mutant forms did not have a dominant-negative impact, it may be that T117A-GFP and aurora-B localize normally, because they are carried by the endogenous survivin. Hence, the true effect of mutating these residues may be more severe than we have observed. We were unable to detect a significant difference in the level of survivin-GFP phosphorylation in vivo in asynchronous or prometaphase arrested cultures co-expressing aurora-B-GFP. However, survivin is also phosphorylated by the mitotic regulator, CDK1 (23O'Connor D.S. Grossman D. Plescia J. Li F. Villa A. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13103-13107Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), and has putative CK2 sites (24Mahotka C. Wenzel M. Springer E. Gabbert H.E. Gerharz C.D. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6097-6102PubMed Google Scholar); thus, the contribution that aurora-B makes to the phosphorylation status of survivin may be insufficient for us to detect over the contributions of other kinases. Furthermore, if aurora-B phosphorylates survivin at the metaphase-anaphase transition (as discussed below), the transience of this event may preclude our ability to detect this modification. Our observations provide support for the notion that the movements of the chromosomal passengers are regulated by phosphorylation. Interestingly, the localization of aurora-B itself to centromeres is independent of its kinase activity, but kinase-inactive aurora-B does not transfer to the anaphase spindle and equatorial cortex (25Murata-Hori M. Wang Y. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 894-899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), and cells expressing aurora-BK109R subsequently fail in cytokinesis (26Terada Y. Tatsuka M. Suzuki F. Yasuda Y. Fujita S. Otsu M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that aurora kinase (Ipl1) activity peaks during spindle formation in mitotic budding yeast (27Buvelot S. Tatsutani S.Y. Vermaak D. Biggins S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). As the kinetics of spindle formation and chromosome movements are different between S. cerevisiae and mammalian cells, and Ipl1 is the only aurora kinase in budding yeast, it will be interesting to determine how the levels of aurora-B activity correlate with the movements of the chromosomal passenger complex in mammalian cells. Indeed, from the work of Bischoff et al. (28Bischoff J.R. Anderson L. Zhu Y. Mossie K. Ng L. Souza B. Schryver B. Flanagan P. Clairvoyant F. Ginther C. Chan C.S. Novotny M. Slamon D.J. Plowman G.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3052-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar), aurora-B activity (referred to as aurora-1) was reported to be highest from metaphase through to telophase. Our findings, together with the data from Bischoff et al. (28Bischoff J.R. Anderson L. Zhu Y. Mossie K. Ng L. Souza B. Schryver B. Flanagan P. Clairvoyant F. Ginther C. Chan C.S. Novotny M. Slamon D.J. Plowman G.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3052-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar) suggest a potential explanation for one of the most intriguing aspects of chromosomal passenger behavior, the transfer of the proteins from the centromere to the spindle midzone at anaphase onset. If aurora-B were to phosphorylate survivin at the metaphase-anaphase transition, when its activity is reported to be highest, this might alter the association of survivin with the chromosomes, thereby releasing the chromosomal passengers to target to other subcellular compartments, such as the midzone microtubules and cleavage plane. We thank Dr. Ciaran Morrison for initial assistance with aurora-B kinase assays; Dr. Margaret Ashcroft for guidance on in vivo phospholabeling; and Dr. Neville Ashcroft for critical comments on the manuscript.

Endothelial cell migration and survival during neovascularization are regulated by adhesion proteins, including integrin α5β1. Integrin α5β1 is poorly expressed on normal quiescent blood vessels, but its expression is induced on tumor blood vessels and in response to angiogenic factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor, interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor-α, and the angiomatrix protein Del-1. We show here that α5β1 expression, and hence function, during angiogenesis is regulated by the transcription factor Hox D3, a homeobox gene that also controls the expression of endothelial cell integrin αvβ3 and urokinase-type plasminogen activator. Hox D3 expression in endothelial cells enhances integrin α5 protein and message expression, whereas Hox D3 antisense inhibits its expression. Hox D3 promotes α5expression during angiogenesis in vivo, whereas inhibition of α5 expression by Hox D3 antisense suppresses angiogenesis. Hox D3 binds directly to the promoters of the integrin α5 and β3 subunits, inducing subunit expression. As Hox D3, integrin αvβ3, and integrin α5β1 are expressed on tumor blood vessels but not on normal quiescent vessels, these studies suggest that Hox D3 coordinately regulates the expression of integrin α5β1 and integrin αvβ3 during angiogenesis in vivo.

In contrast, Hox D3 antisense inhibits angiogenesis and suppresses expression of integrin αvβ3 and uPA (25Boudreau N. Andrews C. Srebow A. Ravanpay A. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 26Taniguchi Y. Komatsu N. Moriuchi T. Blood. 1995; 85: 2786-2794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the current studies, we found that Hox D3 regulates integrin α5β1 expression. As integrin α5β1 and Hox D3 are both expressed by tumor endothelium but not by normal endothelium, these results suggest that Hox D3 regulates integrin α5β1 expression in tumor endothelium. Thus, Hox D3 may provide a switch to activate a program of angiogenesis that includes expression of both during αvβ3 and α5β1 angiogenesis. Once integrins α5β1 and αvβ3 are expressed, angiogenesis depends on each integrin as antagonists of each can block angiogenesis in vivo (10Brooks P.C. Montgomery A.M. Rosenfeld M. Reisfeld R.A. Hu T.

CAM Assays—Chicken embryos (McIntyre Poultry, Ramona, CA) were stimulated with 3 μg of recombinant murine Del-1 and 30 ng of recombinant human bFGF, IL-8, TNFα, or human VEGF (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) or saline in 30 μl as described (16Kim S.

Bell K. Mousa S. Varner J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1345-1362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Ten embryos were used per treatment group. Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test. In Vitro Cell Culture—Endothelial cells (human microvascular endothelial cells) were cultured in EGM (complete growth medium containing bFGF, VEGF and serum from Clonetics, San Diego, CA). Cell lysates were prepared by as described (17Kim S. Harris M. Varner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33920-33928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). HMEC-1 immortalized human microvascular endothelial cells (36Ades W. Candal F.J. Swerlick R.A. George V.G. Summers S. Bosse D.C. Lawley T.J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 683-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were a gift from T. Lawley, Emory University. Cell adhesion and ligand binding assays were performed as described (16Kim S. Bell K. Mousa S. Varner J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1345-1362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). HMEC-1 cells were cultured as described previously (25Boudreau N. Andrews C. Srebow A. Ravanpay A. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). HMEC-1 were transfected with HA/Hox D3 or CMVβgal using Effectene (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and stable pools of transfected cells were selected using 35 μg/ml G418. The HA/Hox D3 expression plasmid was constructed by cloning the Hox D3 coding sequence into a CMV-driven expression plasmid (pcDNA3). The insert plus promoter were excised using Kpn/NotI and inserted in-frame into the pHM6 epitope expression vector under control of the CMV promoter (Roche Applied Science). The sequence of the resulting HA/Hox D3 expression vector was confirmed by ABI sequencing at the Biomolecular Resource Center at the University of California, San Francisco. RT-PCR—RNA was extracted from CAMs using Qiagen (Valencia, CA) RNA easy kits. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed using Quantum™ RNA 18 S internal competitive standards (Ambion, Woodward, TX). Specific cDNA primers were chicken GAPDH forward (5′-CTACACACGGACACTTCAAGGGCA-3′), chicken GAPDH reverse (5′-TCCAGACGGCAGGTCAGGTCAACA-3′), and chicken Hox D3 forward (5′-AAAGAGATACACGGGGACAGCA-3′), chicken Hox D3 reverse (5′ AGAGATGAGTTAGACCAAAGAT-3′). Products were chicken GAPDH (598 bp) and chicken GAPDH (170 bp). Immunoprecipitation of DNA Bound to Hox Proteins—Hox-bound DNA was recovered by a modification of methods described previously (37Fragoso G. Hager G.L. Methods. 1997; 11: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 38Orlando V. Paro R. Cell. 1993; 75: 1187-1198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). 8 × 106 HMEC-1 were treated with 1% formaldehyde for 1, 5, 30, and 60 min; 5 min of fixation yielded the best results and was used for further studies (37Fragoso G. Hager G.L. Methods. 1997; 11: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cells were then solubilized in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were prepared as described (37Fragoso G. Hager G.L. Methods. 1997; 11: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Nuclei were confirmed to be intact using a hemocytometer and 10-20 μg of intact nuclei were resuspended in Workman and Langman's buffer (37Fragoso G. Hager G.L. Methods. 1997; 11: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The intact nuclei were restriction-digested with 100 units of HaeIII or PvuII. Following digestion, nuclei were lysed by shearing through a 21-gauge needle in RIPA, and 10 μl of anti-HA (Roche Applied Science), anti-HoxB3 (Covance, Princeton, NJ), or control IgG was added overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were precipitated by addition of 50 μl of 10% w/v protein A-Sepharose. Pellets were then washed in 5 times in RIPA, and formaldehyde cross-links were reversed by heating for 1 h at 60 °C. Proteinase K was added for 1 h to digest associated proteins, and the remaining DNA was purified by extraction with phenol/chloroform. A fraction of the recovered DNA was end labeled with [32P]dCTP to confirm both length and presence of DNA remaining at this step. Analysis of Isolated Genomic Sequences—To screen for the presence of promoter sequences in Hox D3-bound genomic DNA, 1 μg of pellet or supernatant DNA was amplified with the following primers: β3 integrin-F, 5′-atgtggtcttgccctcaaca-3′ corresponding to bp 9-26, and R 5′-ctcgcatctcgtccgcct 3′-corresponding to bp 574-591 of the published sequence (GenBank™ accession number L28832). Amplification was for 35 cycles at an annealing temperature of 50 °C. The α5 integrin promoter was amplified using the following primers: F 5′-ttaggagctgaaggtttgggt-3′ corresponding to bp 11-32 and R 5′-cagggaagagcgctatg-3′ corresponding to bp 933-953 of published sequence (GenBank™ accession number U48214). Amplification was for 35 cycles at an annealing temperature of 55 °C. The sequences of the resulting PCR products were subsequently confirmed by Big Dye Terminator at the Biomolecular Resource Center, University of California, San Francisco. Slot blot analysis was performed using 1 ng of genomic DNA obtained from pellets or 10 ng from supernatants following Hox immunoprecipitation as described (38Orlando V. Paro R. Cell. 1993; 75: 1187-1198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). DNA was diluted in 10× SSC and spotted onto Hybond N+ nylon membranes using a slot blot apparatus. DNA was then denatured in 1.5 m NaCl and 0.5 m NaOH and subsequently neutralized with 1.5 m NaCl and 0.5 m Tris, pH 7.2. Integrin β3 promoter (600 bp), integrin α5 promoter (900 bp), or MMP14 promoter (1.4 kb) probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming. Blots were hybridized with 1 × 106 cpm of probe/ml of hybridization buffer (Hybridsol I, Oncor, Gaithersburg, MD) overnight at 45 °C and washed with 1% SSC, 0.1% SDS, and 0.2% SSC and 0.5% SDS at 45 and 68 °C, respectively, and exposed to x-ray film overnight. Promoter Assays—The 600-bp PCR product corresponding to the β3 integrin promoter was cloned into the PGL3 luciferase reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Site-directed mutagenesis of two adjacent ATTA Hox consensus sites in the β3 promoter were introduced using a QuikChange Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the following primer, 5′-ggcaagaaaaaacttagtgaagcttaaaggactgaaccgg-3′. A 1.4-kb region of the MMP-14 promoter cloned into the PGL3 luciferase reporter vector was a gift from J. Madri (Yale University, New Haven CT). Luciferase assays were performed 72 h following transient transfection of HMEC-1 with promoter/reporter constructs. Luciferase activity was detected using the Luciferase Assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Transfection efficiency was quantified by co-transfection with CMV-LacZ, and β-galactosidase activity was determined using the Galactolight kit (Tropix, Bedford MA). In Situ Hybridization and Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization—7 μm paraffin-embedded human breast tissue sections were deparaffinized by heating at 80 °C for 30 min followed by two washes in xylene for 5 min as described (27Uyeno L.A. Newman-Keagle J.A. Cheung I. Hunt T.K. Young D.M. Boudreau N. J. Surg. Res. 2001; 100: 46-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Sections were rehydrated through an ethanol series, post-fixed for 5 min with 4% paraformaldehyde, digested with 1 μg/ml proteinase K (Sigma) for 10 min, and hybridized using 800 ng/ml digoxigenin-labeled Hox D3 riboprobes generated by using a Roche Applied Science RNA Digoxigenin labeling kit with either T7 or Sp6 RNA polymerase as described (25Boudreau N.

As α5β1 plays a key role in regulating tumor angiogenesis (16Kim S. Bell K. Mousa S. Varner J.A. Am. J.

Immunohistochemical staining was performed on frozen biopsies of various tumors to detect integrin α5β1 (red) and von Willebrand factor (green), a marker of vascular endothelium. We found that integrin α5β1 is expressed on many of the smaller vessels and some of the larger vessels in each tumor type so far examined (seen as yellow in merged images of α5β1 and von Willebrand factor staining), including squamous cell, colon, ovarian, non-small cell lung, bladder, and breast carcinomas, as well as glioblastoma and melanoma (Fig. 1). Some integrin α5β1 expression is also observed on tumor cells in melanoma and bladder carcinoma. In contrast, α5β1 is not expressed on blood vessels in normal tissues, such as normal ovary (Fig. 1). Thus, integrin α5β1 expression is up-regulated on vascular endothelium in a wide variety of tumors. Growth Factor Regulation of α5β1Expression—To evaluate the mechanisms regulating α5β1 expression in tumor angiogenesis, we examined the expression of this integrin in response to various growth factors known to promote tumor angiogenesis. We previously observed that bFGF, but not VEGF, up-regulates integrin α5β1 expression in vivo (16Kim S. Bell K. Mousa S. Varner J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1345-1362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). To evaluate further the roles of various angiogenic growth factors in the regulation of α5β1 expression, chick chorioallantoic membranes were stimulated with saline, IL-8, TNFα, or the angiogenic extracellular matrix protein Del-1, which is also expressed in many tumors (32Hidai C.

Frozen sections of these CAMs were immunostained to detect von Willebrand factor, a marker of blood vessels (green), and integrin α5β1 expression (red).

By contrast, the evidence for sialylation in protostomes has been scarce and somewhat controversial. In the present study, we characterize a Drosophila sialyltransferase gene, thus providing experimental evidence for the presence of sialylation in protostomes. This gene encodes a functional α2-6-sialyltransferase (SiaT) that is closely related to the vertebrate ST6Gal sialyltransferase family, indicating an ancient evolutionary origin for this family. Characterization of recombinant, purified Drosophila SiaT revealed a novel acceptor specificity as it exhibits highest activity toward GalNAcβ1-4GlcNAc carbohydrate structures at the non-reducing termini of oligosaccharides and glycoprotein glycans. Oligosaccharides are preferred over glycoproteins as acceptors, and no activity toward glycolipid acceptors was detected. Recombinant Drosophila SiaT expressed in cultured insect cells possesses in vivo and in vitro autosialylation activity toward β-linked GalNAc termini of its own N-linked glycans, thus representing the first example of a sialylated insect glycoconjugate. In situ hybridization revealed that Drosophila SiaT is expressed during embryonic development in a tissue- and stage-specific fashion, with elevated expression in a subset of cells within the central nervous system. The identification of a SiaT in Drosophila provides a new evolutionary perspective for considering the diverse functions of sialylation and, through the powerful genetic tools available in this system, a means of elucidating functions for sialylation in protostomes.

Sialic acids compose a large family of negatively charged nine-carbon α-keto acids and are typically located at the non-reducing termini of glycans. In mammals, sialic acids have been implicated in a number of important biological processes, such as the regulation of turnover of circulating glycoproteins and erythrocytes, pathogen-host recognition, immune system functioning, and nervous system development (reviewed in Refs. 1Schauer R. Glycoconj. J. 2000; 17: 485-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar and 2Angata T. Varki A. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 439-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). In addition, alterations in sialic acid biosynthesis often correlate with malignant transformation and tumor progression (3Fukuda M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2237-2244PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kim Y.J. Varki A. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, the biosynthesis of sialylated glycoconjugates includes a number of enzymatic reactions that convert the precursor sugar, uridine-diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine, into the donor sugar, cytidine monophosphate N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-Neu5Ac) 1The abbreviations used are: CMP-Neu5Accytidine monophosphate N-acetylneuraminic acidNeu5AcN-acetylneuraminic acidLacNAcGalβ1-4GlcNAcLacdiNAcGalNAcβ1-4GlcNAcHPTLChigh performance thin layer chromatographyPNGaseFpeptide-N4-(N-acetyl-β-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase FHAhemagglutininRCA-IR. communis agglutinin ISiaTα2-6-sialyltransferaseLNnTlacto-N-neotetraoseLNTlacto-N-tetraose.

This donor molecule is used by sialyltransferases for the linkage-specific sialylation of glycoconjugates. Sialyltransferases usually exhibit strict acceptor specificity, and synthesize one type of linkage between sialic acid and acceptor substrates. Their expression is often regulated, and specific patterns of sialylation may vary at different developmental stages (5Harduin-Lepers A. Vallejo-Ruiz V. Krzewinski-Recchi M.A. Samyn-Petit B.

The combined characterization of the biochemical activity and the expression pattern of each sialyltransferase provide an indication of the structure and spatial-temporal distribution of sialylated glycoconjugates, and is thus essential for understanding the in vivo functions of sialic acid. cytidine monophosphate N-acetylneuraminic acid N-acetylneuraminic acid Galβ1-4GlcNAc GalNAcβ1-4GlcNAc high performance thin layer chromatography peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-β-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase F hemagglutinin R. communis agglutinin I α2-6-sialyltransferase lacto-N-neotetraose lacto-N-tetraose.

Structurally, all vertebrate sialyltransferases have a similar molecular architecture. (i) They are type II transmembrane glycoproteins that predominantly reside in the trans-Golgi compartment and have a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail that is not important for their catalytic activity. (ii) They have a transmembrane anchor domain that contributes to Golgi retention. (iii) They include a stem region of highly variable length (from 20 to 200 amino acids) that is followed by a large C-terminal catalytic domain (5Harduin-Lepers A. Vallejo-Ruiz V.

Experiments with insect Sf9 cells stably expressing two mammalian glycosyltransferases, β1-4-galactosyltransferase and α2-6-sialyltransferase, revealed the biochemical potential of these cells to provide a sugar donor for sialylation (24Hollister J.R. Jarvis D.L. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, endogenous sialyltransferase activity was not detected (25Hollister J.R. Shaper J.H. Jarvis D.L. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 26Jarvis D.L. Finn E.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1288-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, it was suggested that in insect cells the sialylation pathway may be present as a highly specialized biochemical process that occurs in a tissue- and/or developmental stage-specific manner, or perhaps that sialic acids are present in only a small number of protostome species (2Angata T. Varki A. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 439-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar, 27Marchal I. Jarvis D.L. Cacan R. Verbert A. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The availability of complete genomic information recently made Drosophila a powerful model system for elucidating the biochemical components of insect glycosylation pathways. Searches of the Drosophila genome data base revealed the presence of several genes that encode putative orthologues of vertebrate enzymes of the sialic acid biosynthetic pathway, including Neu5Ac phosphate synthase, CMP-Neu5Ac synthase, CMP-Neu5Ac/CMP antiporter, and sialyltransferase (GadFly data base (28FlyBase Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar); CAZY data base (29Coutinho P.M.

Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). 2V. M. Panin, unpublished data. A recent study confirmed that Drosophila has a functional Neu5Ac phosphate synthase with significant homology to the human orthologue, which indicates the possibility of a vertebrate-type pathway for CMP-sialic acid biosynthesis in Drosophila (31Kim K. Lawrence S.M. Park J. Pitts L. Vann W.F. Betenbaugh M.J. Palter K.B. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Evidence for the presence of sialylated structures in Drosophila has, however, only been reported in one study, and the nature of these sialylated glycoconjugates has not been analyzed further (21Roth J. Kempf A. Reuter G. Schauer R. Gehring W.J. Science. 1992; 256: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identify and characterize the apparently single vertebrate-type sialyltransferase gene of Drosophila melanogaster, SiaT. We demonstrate that this gene encodes a functional α2-6-sialyltransferase, which is structurally and functionally related to the ST6Gal family of vertebrate sialyltransferases, yet has a distinct acceptor specificity. Analysis of the Drosophila SiaT expression pattern during embryonic development reveals a distinct pattern of expression in the central nervous system, which suggests possible functions of the SiaT gene in neural development.

GalNAc-benzyl, lacto-N-tetraose, and lacto-N-neotetraose were from Calbiochem. Disaccharides with a hydrophobic aglycone, LacNAc-Rg and LacdiNAc-Rg (where Rg is O-(CH2)8CO2CH3 (32Hindsgaul O. Kaur K.J. Srivastava G. Blaszczyk-Thurin M. Crawley S.C. Heerze L.D. Palcic M.M. J. Biol.

Gal-NAcβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-2Manα1-O(CH2)7CH3 was from Dr. Johannis P. Kamerling (Utrecht University, The Netherlands). Drosophila mucin-D glycoprotein (33Kramerov A.A. Arbatsky N.P. Rozovsky Y.M.

Moreland M. Schweingruber H. Tiemeyer M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3549-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)) were kindly provided, respectively, by Dr. Andrei Kramerov (UCLA) and Dr. Michael Tiemeyer (Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, University of Georgia). Biotinylated Sambucus nigra (SNA), Ricinus communis agglutinin I (RCA-I), and Wistaria floribunda (WFA) lectins were from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Merck HPTLC Silica Gel 60 F254 plates were from EM Science (Gibbstown, NJ). IgG-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow beads were from Amersham Biosciences. CMP-[14C]Neu5Ac (12.0 GBq/mmol, 740 KBq/ml) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. PNGaseF and β-N-acetylhexosaminidasef were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Purified rabbit IgG was from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Asialo-α1-acid glycoprotein was prepared by acid hydrolysis in 0.02 n HCl for 1 h at 80 °C. Expression Constructs—Construct for the expression of HA-tagged full-length Drosophila SiaT (designated D. SiaT) protein was prepared as follows: (i) by introducing an XbaI site after the last codon of D. SiaT open reading frame in cDNA clone GH27778 by PCR; (ii) in-frame ligation of double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding HA tag (35Niman H.L. Houghten R.A. Walker L.E. Reisfeld R.A. Wilson I.A. Hogle J.M. Lerner R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4949-4953Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) followed by 6 histidines and a stop codon into this XbaI site; and (iii) by subcloning the resulting DNA construct into pRmHA-3 expression vector (36Bunch T.A. Grinblat Y. Goldstein L.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1043-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In order to make a construct expressing D. SiaT with N-terminal protein A tag, we PCR-amplified a DNA fragment encoding the IgG-binding domain of Staphylococcus aureus protein A from plasmid pRL715 (a gift from Dr. K. Severinov (37Opalka N. Mooney R.A. Richter C. Severinov K. Landick R. Darst S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)), ligated this DNA in-frame with PCR-amplified DNA fragment of GH27778 encoding 86-451 amino acids of D. SiaT protein, and then inserted the resulting DNA into pMT/BiP/V5-HisA vector (Invitrogen) in-frame with the BiP signal sequence (38Kirkpatrick R.B. Ganguly S. Angelichio M. Griego S. Shatzman A. Silverman C. Rosenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19800-19805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The final construct expressed a D. SiaT fusion protein in which the first 85 amino acids, including the endogenous signal peptide and a part of the stem region, were replaced with BiP signal peptide followed by the IgG-binding domain of S. aureus protein A. Cell Culture—Drosophila S2 cells were maintained and transfected as described (39Panin V.M. Shao L. Lei L. Moloney D.J. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29945-29952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells were grown as a suspension culture in Erlenmeyer flasks with orbital shaking at 110 rpm using the media described (26Jarvis D.L. Finn E.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1288-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Generation of recombinant baculovirus and production of recombinant protein in baculovirus-infected cells was performed using the Bac-to-Bac expression system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protein Purification—For purification of protein A-tagged D. SiaT protein, we collected medium from Sf9 cells 72 h after infection with recombinant baculovirus. This medium was incubated with IgG-Sepharose beads on a rotator at 4 °C overnight. Afterward, the beads were extensively washed with phosphate-buffered saline and assay buffer and used in sialyltransferase assays. The amount of purified protein was quantified by Coomassie staining of SDS gels loaded with D. SiaT and a protein standard (bovine serum albumin). Sialyltransferase Assays—Unless otherwise stated, D. SiaT activity was measured in 50 mm cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5, 1% Triton CF-54 (v/v), 3 mm oligosaccharide acceptor, 50 μg of glycoprotein or 12.5 μg of glycolipids, and 108 μm CMP-[14C]Neu5Ac (22.7 mCi/mmol) in a total volume of 20 μlat37 °C for 2 h. Before the assays, IgG-SiaT beads were first autosialylated in the presence of 100 μm CMP-Neu5Ac for 1.5 h at 37 °C in order to eliminate competition between autosialylation and the tested acceptors. During assays, IgG-SiaT beads were kept in suspension using a shaking water bath. The reactions were within linearity range for at least 3 h, and no more than 10% of CMP-Neu5Ac and substrates were consumed in any assay. Oligosaccharide samples were spotted directly on HPTLC plates and developed in 1-propyl alcohol/aqueous ammonia/water (6:1:2.5) solvent system. Glycoproteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography and quantification using the Storm imaging system (Amersham Biosciences). Gangliosides were desalted as described (40Williams M.A. McCluer R.H. J. Neurochem. 1980; 35: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) and analyzed by HPTLC in a solvent system of chloroform, methanol, and 0.02% CaCl2 (55:45:10). An aliquot of Drosophila glycolipids was also treated with hydrofluoric acid to remove phosphoethanolamine residues as described (34Seppo A. Moreland M. Schweingruber H. Tiemeyer M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3549-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). After the sialyltransferase assays, Drosophila glycolipids were desalted on Sephadex G-25 columns (41Dahms N.M. Schnaar R.L. J. Neurosci. 1983; 3: 806-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzed by HPTLC in a buffer system of chloroform, methanol, and 0.25% aqueous potassium chloride (10:10:3). LacNAc-Rg and LacdiNAc-Rg acceptors were also analyzed by HPTLC in the same buffer system without prior desalting. When GalNAc-benzyl was used as an acceptor, the unincorporated donor was removed by Sep-Pak C18 (Waters) column, and then incorporated radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting (32Hindsgaul O. Kaur K.J. Srivastava G. Blaszczyk-Thurin M. Crawley S.C. Heerze L.D. Palcic M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17858-17862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Km and Vmax values for asialofetuin and lactoferrin were estimated based on the calculated amount of terminal LacNAc or LacdiNAc structures, i.e. 8.8 LacNAc termini per asialofetuin molecule (based on Ref. 42Green E.D. Adelt G. Baenziger J.U. Wilson S. Van Halbeek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18253-18268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Terminal LacdiNAc concentration of lactoferrin was estimated at 2.6 LacdiNAc termini per lactoferrin based on Coddeville et al. (43Coddeville B. Strecker G. Wieruszeski J.M. Vliegenthart J.F. van Halbeek H. Peter-Katalinic J. Egge H. Spik G. Carbohydr. Res. 1992; 236: 145-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Because the degree of sialylation can vary between different batches of lactoferrin, we estimated the ratio of sialylated LacdiNAc termini in our lactoferrin sample by comparing D. SiaT-mediated incorporation of [14C]Neu5Ac into Vibrio cholerae sialidase-treated and non-treated lactoferrin. We did not detect any difference in the amount of Neu5Ac incorporation between these two samples; hence we assumed that the ratio of sialylated to non-sialylated LacdiNAc in our commercial lactoferrin sample was negligible. Thus, 2.6 mol of non-sialylated LacdiNAc termini were assumed to be present on each mole of lactoferrin. Linkage Analysis—The linkage and terminal position of incorporated sialic acids were examined using a battery of exoglycosidases. After modification by D. SiaT, glycoprotein and oligosaccharide acceptors were treated with α2-3-sialidase (Streptococcus pneumoniae), α2-3,6-sialidase (Clostridium perfringens), α2-3,6,8-specific (V. cholerae) or α2-3,6,8,9-sialidase (Arthrobacter ureafaciens) (all from Sigma). The position of sialic acids was also examined by β1-3,4,6-galactosidase (bovine testes, Sigma) treatment. The acceptor sugar residue on D. SiaT was determined by the combination of β1-2,3,4,6-N-acetylglucosaminidase from S. pneumoniae (Calbiochem) and β1-2,3,4,6-N-acetylhexosaminidasef (New England Biolabs) digestions. All experiments with glycosidase treatments included a control reaction (mock treatment) with identical conditions except for the absence of the corresponding glycosidase. The digestion products of oligosaccharides were analyzed by HPTLC, and those of glycoproteins were subjected to PAGE, followed by autoradiography. Lectin Blotting—SDS-PAGE-separated glycoproteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, blocked in PBTS (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween, 0.05% saponin) overnight, and incubated with the corresponding biotinylated lectins in PBTS at 5 μg/ml (SNA) or 10 μg/ml (WFA) concentrations for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washes, lectin binding was visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (ABC Vectastain Elite kit, Vector Laboratories) followed by chemiluminescence detection (Pierce). Large Scale Sialyltransferase Assay and 1H NMR—For the preparative scale sialyltransferase assay, 1 mg of D. SiaT (bound to IgG beads), 100 nmol of GalNAcβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-2Manα1-O(CH2)7CH3, and 150 nmol of CMP-NeuAc were incubated in 50 mm cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5, at 25 °C for 72 h in 1.5-ml final volume. Every 12 h an aliquot of CMP-NeuAc (70 nmol) was added to the reaction mixture. The sialylated product was desalted on Sep-Pak C18 cartridges as described (32Hindsgaul O. Kaur K.J. Srivastava G. Blaszczyk-Thurin M. Crawley S.C. Heerze L.D. Palcic M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17858-17862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the sample was lyophilized twice from 99.8% D2O (Cambridge Isotopes Labs) and finally dissolved in 99.96% D2O. 1H NMR spectra were collected at 14.1 tesla (600-MHz proton frequency) and 300 K on a Varian Inova NMR spectrometer. Chemical shifts are referenced relative to internal acetone (δ 2.225 ppm). NMR data were processed using a software package developed by Dr. J. A. van Kuik (Bijvoet Center, Department of Bio-organic Chemistry, Utrecht University). Immunostaining and in Situ Hybridization—Immunostaining of D. SiaT-expressing S2 cells was performed as described (44Panin V.M. Papayannopoulos V. Wilson R. Irvine K.D. Nature. 1997; 387: 908-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). We used primary monoclonal mouse anti-HA antibody at 1:1000 (Babco), polyclonal rabbit anti-Lva antibody at 1:5000 (a gift from Dr. John Sisson, The University of Texas, Austin), Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse (1:500), and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (1:140) antibodies (both from Jackson ImmunoResearch). D. melanogaster Canton-S embryos were collected on apple juice plates at 25 °Cas described (45Rothwell W.F. Sullivan W. Sullivan W. Ashburner M. Hawley R.S. Drosophila Protocols. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 141-157Google Scholar). In situ hybridization of Drosophila embryos was performed using a published protocol (46Lehmann R. Tautz D. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 44: 575-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) with digoxigenin-labeled RNA probe (produced with DIG RNA labeling mix from Roche Applied Science) and anti-DIG antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science). Images were obtained with Axioplan 2 fluorescent microscope (Zeiss). Identification of a Putative Drosophila Sialyltransferase Gene—By searching the complete Drosophila genome data base with the L-sialyl motif consensus sequence (10Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 34: 157-165PubMed Google Scholar), we identified a gene, located at 60D14 on 2R chromosome (GadFly CG4871), with homology to known sialyltransferases. Searches of the Drosophila EST data base (47Rubin G.M. Hong L. Brokstein P. Evans-Holm M. Frise E. Stapleton M. Harvey D.A. Science. 2000; 287: 2222-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) identified a cDNA clone, GH27778, with homology in the 5′-prime sequence to the predicted mRNA of CG4871. The sequence of this clone revealed that it included an open reading frame corresponding to the predicted open reading frame of CG4871, confirming that hypothetical gene CG4871 indeed represents an active transcription unit. This gene has been referred to as ST6Gal in the Drosophila genome data base based on its sequence similarity to vertebrate sialyltransferases, but as this name does not accurately reflect its actual enzymatic activity (see below), we instead designate it as SiaT. Similar to vertebrate sialyltransferases, this gene encodes a putative type II transmembrane protein with an N-terminally located signal peptide/anchoring domain, a stem region, and a C-terminal presumptive catalytic domain with high homology to the corresponding domain of vertebrate sialyltransferases (Fig. 1, A and B). The closest vertebrate homologues of Drosophila SiaT (designated D. SiaT) are β-galactoside α2-6-sialyltransferases, including human ST6Gal II (7Takashima S. Tsuji S. Tsujimoto M. J. Biol.

BLAST searches also revealed an Anopheles gambiae (mosquito) gene, agCG56989 (GenBank™ accession number EAA04038), encoding a putative sialyltransferase with high sequence homology to D. SiaT (E-value: 3e-89). Multiple sequence alignment with the catalytic domains of known vertebrate sialyltransferases confirmed a closer relationship of D. SiaT to ST6Gal sialyltransferases, as compared with ST3Gal, ST6GalNAc, or ST8Sia sialyltransferas"
https://openalex.org/W2030319354,"The Hsp70-interacting E3-ubiquitin ligase CHIP has been implicated in the decision as to whether a target protein enters the refolding or the degradation pathway. To further characterize the activity of CHIP we purified untagged Homo sapiens and Drosophila melanogaster CHIP (hCHIP, dCHIP). In contrast to other E3-ubiquitin ligases, both hCHIP and dCHIP proteins formed homodimers at physiological concentrations. We identified a predicted coiled-coil region in a mixed charge segment of the hCHIP and dCHIP sequence and found it to be necessary and sufficient for dimer formation. A mutant of hCHIP lacking this segment (hCHIPΔ-(128–229)) was incapable of dimer formation, but the segment by itself (hCHIP-(128–229)) readily dimerized. Furthermore, we demonstrated that dimerization is a prerequisite for activity of hCHIP in the reconstituted ubiquitination assay. Control of dimerization may thus provide a mechanism for regulation of CHIP activity.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 603-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar and 2.Cyr D.M. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 368-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is based on the observation that in vivo overproduced CHIP is found in activation- and folding-competent chaperone complexes with glucocorticoid receptor, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, and Erb2, leading to ubiquitination of these substrates and acceleration of their degradation through the proteasome (3.Meacham G.C. Patterson C. Zhang W. Younger J.M. Cyr D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 4.Xu W. Marcu M. Yuan X. Mimnaugh E. Patterson C. Neckers L. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent study suggested that heat-denatured polypeptides, captured in an aggregation prone conformation by chaperones, might also be substrates for CHIP-dependent ubiquitination (6.Murata S. Minami Y. Minami M. Chiba T. Tanaka K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The domain organization of CHIP comprises three TPR motifs in the N-terminal region that mediate interaction with Hsp90 and Hsp70, a region with a high number of positively and negatively charged residues (mixed charge region) of unknown function, and a C-terminal RING-finger-type E3 ligase motif, a socalled U box (see Fig. 1) (7.Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R132-R134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 8.Ballinger C.A. Connell P. Wu Y. Hu Z. Thompson L.J. Yin L.Y. Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Based on these criteria, CHIP proteins can be identified in a variety of eukaryotic organisms ranging from Caenorhabditis elegans to man. Arabidopsis thaliana CHIP shows a significant degree of identity only to the U box of hCHIP. In contrast, the homology of this protein to the TPR motifs of hCHIP is very weak, and it does not contain a mixed charge region. It nevertheless seems to function as a bona fide CHIP protein (9.Yan J. Wang J. Li Q. Hwang J.R. Patterson C. Zhang H. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 861-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). No CHIP homologues exist in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. CHIP was recently identified as an E3-ubiquitin ligase by several laboratories based on the criteria of (i) self-ubiquitination, (ii) ubiquitination of several substrates including unspecific bacterial proteins (Hsp70 and Raf-1 kinase) and denatured substrate proteins such as luciferase, and (iii) a physical and/or functional interaction of CHIP with E2 enzymes such as UbcH5A that act specifically in the degradation of misfolded and aberrant proteins (6.Murata S. Minami Y. Minami M. Chiba T. Tanaka K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 10.Hatakeyama S. Yada M. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Nakayama K.I. J. Biol.

Here we have purified two native CHIP homologues from Homo sapiens (hCHIP) and Drosophila melanogaster (dCHIP) and analyzed their biochemical and biophysical properties. We found that CHIP proteins form dimers via a putative coiled-coil domain located within the mixed charge region. Dimerization was essential for the E3 ligase activity of CHIP, which could have important consequences on both its mode of action and regulation. Cloning of UbcH5C and Wild-type and Mutant CHIP Proteins—The cDNA encoding H. sapiens UbcH5C was obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR from HeLa cell mRNA and was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pGM10 (13.Wiederkehr T. Pretot R.F. Minvielle-Sebastia L. RNA. 1998; 4: 1357-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) producing an N-terminal His6 fusion protein. The cDNAs encoding hCHIP and dCHIP were obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR from HeLa cell and D. melanogaster mRNA, respectively, and cloned into the bacterial expression vector pUHE21–2fdΔ12 (14.Gamer J. Bujard H. Bukau B. Cell. 1992; 69: 833-842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) yielding the plasmids pUHE21-hCHIP and pUHE21-dCHIP, which produce untagged native proteins. pUHE21-hCHIPΔ-(128–229) was generated by PCR amplification using pUHE21-hCHIP as a template and PCR primers P1 (5′-GCG GAT CCC TGC TCC TTG GCC AGG C-3′) and P2 (5′-GCG GAT CCT ACC TGT GTG GCA AGA TCA G-3′). The PCR product was cut at the introduced BamHI sites and circularized by self-ligation, leading to a vector encoding for hCHIP with amino acids 128–229 deleted. hCHIP-(128–229) was generated by PCR using pUHE21-hCHIP plasmid as template and PCR primers P3 (5′-GCT CTA GAT CAG TCG GGG ATG TCT CGC TTC-3′) and P4 (5′-CGG GAT CCA TGG CTC GGC TGA ACT TCG GGG ACG-3′). The PCR product was cloned into the pUHE21–2fdΔ12 expression vector. Purification of UbcH5C and Wild-type and Mutant CHIP Proteins— Hexahistidine-tagged UbcH5C protein was produced in XL1-Blue and purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Ni-NTA, Qiagen). Production of hCHIP and dCHIP in the bacterial host FI8202 (15.Fiedler U. Weiss V. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3696-3705Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) was induced at A600 = 0.7–0.8 with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C. From five liter cultures, 30 g (wet cell weight) was obtained and resuspended in buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 0.4 mg/ml lysozyme. After cell lysis by sonification and ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, the supernatant was precipitated with 40% ammonium sulfate. The pellets were resuspended in buffer A, dialyzed against the same buffer, and loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column (50 × 150 mm) that was equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 2 column volumes of buffer A, and bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 100% buffer B (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 1 m KCl, 5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) over 2 column volumes. hCHIP-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer A and loaded onto an SP Sepharose column (16 × 150 mm). The column was washed with 2 column volumes of buffer A, and bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of buffer B (5 column volumes, 0–100%). The peak fractions were pooled and applied to a gel filtration column (Superdex 200 high load 16/60, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A. Highly pure hCHIP-containing fractions were pooled, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Production of hCHIPΔ-(128–229), harvesting, and lysis of cells as well as ammonium sulfate precipitation were performed as indicated above for hCHIP. The cell lysate was applied to a Source 30Q column (Hi Prep 16/10, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 2 column volumes of buffer A. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient over 5 column volumes from 0 to 50% buffer B. hCHIPΔ-(128–229)-containing fractions were pooled and applied to a Superdex 75 column (HR10/30, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A. For the production of hCHIP-(128–229), XL1-Blue cells harboring the hCHIP-(128–229)-encoding plasmid were grown, induced, and lysed as described above for hCHIP. Proteins were precipitated with 55% ammonium sulfate, and the pellet was resuspended and dialyzed against buffer C (25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). hCHIP-(128–229) was purified by subsequent chromatography on Source 30Q (16 × 10 mm) and Resource S (6 ml, Amersham Biosciences) columns. The columns were equilibrated with buffer C, and bound proteins were eluted with 5 column volumes of a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in buffer C. The hCHIP-(128–229)-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated using a Vivaspin 0.5-ml concentrator (10,000 molecular weight cut-off, Sartorius). Aliquots of the purified protein were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Mass Spectrometric Analysis—The CHIPΔ-(128–229) protein was identified by mass spectrometry. The protein band was excised from a Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel and digested in gel with trypsin as described (16.Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7735) Google Scholar). We analyzed the tryptic peptides by nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry as described (17.Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar) using a QSTAR Pulsar mass spectrometer (MDS Sciex) equipped with a nanoES ion source (MDS Proteomics). Sequence searches were performed with the Protein and Peptide Software Suite (MDS Proteomics) using the NCBI nonredundant protein data base. CD Spectroscopy—Far UV CD spectra were collected between 195 and 250 nm with a Jasco J-715 Spectropolarimeter for hCHIP, hCHIPΔ-(128–229), and hCHIP-(128–229). The measurements were performed in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 5 mm MgCl2 at protein concentrations of 10 μm in 1-mm cuvettes at temperatures ranging from 20 to 85 °C. Gel Filtration Analysis—Gel filtration analysis was carried out at 4 °C at a constant flow of 0.5 ml/min on Superdex 200 (high load 16/60), Superdex 75 (HR10/30), and Superose 12 (HR10/30) columns (Amersham Biosciences) in PBS containing 1 mm DTT for hCHIP-(128–229) or in buffer A containing 1 mm DTT at 4 °C. Samples were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C followed by brief centrifugation at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C. To obtain a calibration curve, marker proteins (Bio-Rad) were run under identical conditions. Chemical Cross-linking—Samples were incubated in buffer A containing 1 mm DTT for 10 min at 30 °C. Glutaraldehyde was added to a final concentration of 0.025%, and the incubation was continued for 10 min unless otherwise indicated. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (containing Tris), followed by a 10-min incubation at room temperature. Bioinformatics—Coiled-coil predictions were done with the Coils program (18.Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3441) Google Scholar) from the ExPASy proteomics tool collection interface (www.expasy.ch) according to the recommendations of the distributor. Ubiquitination Assays—Ubiquitination assays were performed with Escherichia coli proteins derived from a ΔdnaK52 strain (WKG 191 (19.Kelley W.L. Georgopoulos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar)). Unless otherwise indicated standard reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 50 nm E1 (Calbiochem/Boston Biochemicals), 1 μm recombinant purified UbcH5C, either purified hCHIP, dCHIP, or hCHIPΔ-(128–229) protein at 1 μm, and 6 μm ubiquitin (Sigma). In addition, the assays contained 2 mm ATP, an ATP regenerating system (20 mm creatine phosphate, 0.1 mg/ml creatine kinase), 10 mm DTT, and 5 mm MgCl2. The activity of hCHIP, dCHIP and hCHIPΔ-(128–229) was assayed in the presence of 1.5 μm human Hsp90 unless otherwise indicated. The ubiquitination assays were incubated for 3 h at 20, 30, or 37 °C and stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After electrophoresis and Western blotting, the ubiquitinated proteins were detected with ubiquitin-specific antisera (Sigma). In the hCHIP-(128–229)-mediated inhibition experiments, hCHIP and hCHIP-(128–229) were incubated with 4 mm sodium deoxycholate. hCHIP and increasing amounts of hCHIP-(128–229) were mixed and dialyzed against PBS for 5 h at room temperature. Ubiquitination assays and Western blot analysis were performed as indicated above. Antibody Generation—Avian antisera directed against CHIP were commercially produced by Q-biogene (Heidelberg, Germany) using a purified histidine-tagged hCHIP mutant protein lacking the TPR domain. The antibodies were detected with a secondary rabbit anti-chicken IgY (Sigma) antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase followed by ECF™ (Amersham Biosciences) visualization. To characterize CHIP proteins biochemically, we cloned the coding sequences for hCHIP and dCHIP and produced the corresponding full-length, untagged proteins in bacteria. Both proteins were purified to apparent homogeneity by subsequent anion exchange, cation exchange, and size exclusion chromatography. To our knowledge this is the first purification of full-length untagged CHIP proteins (Fig. 2a). Both CHIP proteins were active in a reconstituted ubiquitination assay containing E1, His6-UbcH5C, ubiquitin, and E. coli proteins as substrates (Fig. 2, b and c), whereas omission of any component of the ubiquitination cascade did not allow the ubiquitination reaction to occur (Fig. 2b, lanes 1–4). dCHIP was less efficient in ubiquitination (Fig. 2c), which is not surprising given the fact that the E2 used was of human origin. Quaternary Structure of CHIP—Since some of the TPR motif-containing proteins with which CHIP is thought to compete for binding to the C termini of the Hsp90 dimer are dimers themselves (e.g. HOP/Sti1 (20.Prodromou C. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Woolfson D.N. Regan L. Panaretou B. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 754-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar)), whereas others are monomeric (e.g. FKBP52 (21.Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Kanelakis K.C. Radanyi C. Renoir J.-M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36980-36986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar)), we were interested in analyzing the quaternary structure of CHIP. We therefore analyzed hCHIP and dCHIP by size exclusion chromatography. Neither of the CHIP proteins migrated according to their calculated molecular mass (∼35 kDa); rather, they eluted within a volume corresponding to a 120-kDa (hCHIP) and a 75-kDa (dCHIP) globular protein (Fig. 3). The observed masses therefore exceed the theoretical molecular weight 3.6- and 2.6-fold, respectively. Within the analyzed protein concentration range (2–8 μm; Fig. 3 and results not shown) the CHIP proteins eluted at exactly the same position. To analyze whether the aberrant migration behavior on gel filtration columns was due to the unusual shape of the CHIP proteins or to multimer formation, we analyzed the potential oligomerization by chemical cross-linking of CHIP using glutaraldehyde followed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. At a 1 μm concentration of hCHIP and dCHIP, both proteins were almost completely cross-linked within 10 min (Fig. 4a, lanes 4 and 8). The predominant cross-linked species exhibited an apparent molecular mass of about 70 kDa, consistent with the mass of a CHIP dimer. Under the same conditions, control proteins migrated at the size corresponding to their monomeric molecular weights (Fig. 4a, lane 9 and results not shown). Because the physiological concentration of CHIP is likely to be even smaller than 1 μm (3.Meacham G.C. Patterson C. Zhang W. Younger J.M. Cyr D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar), we repeated the cross-linking experiment at a 200 nm concentration of hCHIP, followed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, SDS-PAGE, and silver staining. Again, the predominant cross-linked species migrated at 70 kDa, which corresponds to a CHIP dimer. Especially at higher protein concentrations, higher molecular weight bands were also detectable that migrated at the molecular weight of a CHIP tetramer (Fig. 4b, lanes 2–5, and results not shown). Similar experiments were conducted at different temperatures and salt concentrations, and revealed that predominantly dimer bands were formed at temperatures between 25–39 °C and at NaCl concentrations of 25–500 mm (results not shown). In analytical ultracentrifugation and static light scattering experiments, hCHIP appeared as dimers and higher order oligomers (data not shown). Both methods, however, are relatively insensitive, and we therefore attribute the observed higher order oligomers to the high protein concentrations that had to be used. Taken together, these results indicate that under physiological conditions CHIP adopts a dimeric quaternary structure. A Putative Coiled-coil Domain Is Sufficient for CHIP Dimerization—To obtain insights into the molecular nature of the dimerization, we analyzed the sequence of the CHIP proteins. A coiled-coil domain, which is known to mediate protein-protein interactions (recently reviewed in Ref. 22.Burkhard P. Stetefeld J. Strelkov S.V. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 82-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar), was predicted by the Coils algorithm (18.Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3441) Google Scholar) within the mixed charge region in hCHIP, dCHIP, and to a lesser extent in the C. elegans CHIP. We cloned, expressed, and purified a fragment of hCHIP corresponding to the predicted coiled-coil domain with a calculated molecular mass of 12.4 kDa (see Fig. 1). The purification procedure was followed with an avian α-CHIP antibody. In gel filtration the fragment eluted at an apparent molecular mass of 32 kDa (Fig. 5a). Chemical cross-linking with glutaraldehyde revealed that hCHIP-(128–229), like the full-length proteins, adopted a predominantly dimeric structure (Fig. 5b), demonstrating that the coiled-coil region of CHIP is sufficient to promote the dimerization of the protein. hCHIPΔ-(128–229) Is Monomeric and Has No E3 Ligase Activity—The dimerization of CHIP raised the interesting question of whether the quaternary structure is required for activity. Therefore, we created a deletion mutant, hCHIPΔ-(128–229), lacking the putative dimerization domain of the protein (see Fig. 1). Because our hCHIP antiserum did not detect the hCHIPΔ-(128–229) variant, we confirmed the identity of the deletion mutant protein by mass spectrometry (results not shown; see “Experimental Procedures”). Surprisingly, the protein eluted on gel filtration columns at an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa (Fig. 6a), which is almost twice the calculated mass (22.8 kDa). However, upon treatment with glutaraldehyde, hCHIPΔ-(128–229), in contrast to full-length hCHIP, migrated according to its calculated molecular mass on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6b, lanes 3–6). It is noteworthy that even though the incubation time in this experiment was prolonged up to 30 min, still no higher molecular mass oligomers of hCHIPΔ-(128–229) were detected. Under these conditions the full-length hCHIP cross-links completely to higher oligomers. These results demonstrate that the mixed charge region of hCHIP contains a dimerization domain that is both necessary and sufficient for the formation of the quaternary structure. The deletion of the predicted coiled-coil domain could compromise the folding of the remaining TPR and U box domains. Therefore, we analyzed the secondary structure content of hCHIP, hCHIPΔ-(128–229), and hCHIP-(128–229) (Fig. 7) by circular dichroism spectroscopy. The recorded spectra indicated for all three proteins (hCHIP, hCHIPΔ-(128–229, hCHIP-(128–229)) a similar high degree of α-helicity. For the full-length hCHIP protein and the hCHIPΔ-(128–229) deletion mutant protein these data can be explained by the presence of the TPR motifs, which consist mainly of α-helices (23.Scheufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G. Pegoraro S. Moroder L. Bartunik H. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Cell. 2000; 101: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). In contrast, TPR motifs cannot explain the spectra of hCHIP-(128–229), because they are not present in this construct. A high degree of α-helicity, however, would also be consistent with a coiled-coil domain as predicted for hCHIP-(128–229) by the Coils algorithm. In addition to determining the overall content of secondary structure elements, we used circular dichroism spectroscopy to monitor the thermal stability of the three proteins. These experiments revealed significant differences in the structural stability of wild-type and mutant proteins. The spectra indicate that wild type hCHIP keeps a significant degree of α-helicity up to a temperature of 37 °C, whereas hCHIPΔ-(128–229) loses secondary structure already at temperatures above 20 °C. To rule out the possibility that a lack of biochemical activity could be due to the loss of structure of the mutant protein, we performed the reconstituted ubiquitination assay at 20 °C (Fig. 8, left panel). Whereas hCHIP showed full activity, hCHIPΔ-(128–229) was completely inactive at all temperatures tested. As expected, at 30 °C no ubiquitination activity was detected (Fig. 8, right panel, compare lanes 1–4 with lanes 5–8). Therefore, we conclude that the dimerization of hCHIP is important for its E3 activity.Fig. 8hCHIPΔ-(128–229) does not act as an E3 ligase. A reconstituted ubiquitination assay was performed with E. coli extract as substrate in the presence of all components (lanes 1 and 5), in the absence of E2 (lanes 2 and 6) or hCHIP (lanes 3 and 7), and in the presence of hCHIPΔ-(128–229) instead of hCHIP (lanes 4 and 8) at 20 °C (left panel) and 30 °C (right panel). The reaction was terminated by SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western blot analysis using ubiquitinspecific antisera.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) hCHIP-(128–229) Inhibits CHIP-mediated Ubiquitination—If the dimerization of CHIP is important for activity, any treatment that disrupts CHIP dimers is expected to result in inactivation. We therefore preincubated hCHIP with increasing amounts of hCHIP-(128–229) (up to 25-fold) for 30 min at 30 °C and then tested for ubiquitination activity in our standard assay. However, only a very weak inhibitory effect was observed (results not shown). We hypothesized that the hCHIP dimers and/or hCHIP-(128–229) dimers were thermodynamically or kinetically too stable to allow the formation of heterodimers. To test for this possibility, we tried to monomerize hCHIP using low, nondenaturing concentrations of a wide variety of detergents and chaotropic agents. We found that only sodium deoxycholate was able to monomerize hCHIP, as evidenced by cross-linking (results not shown). Deoxycholate, however, inhibited the ubiquitination activity of hCHIP with kinetics similar to its promotion of monomeriziation (results not shown). We, therefore, first monomerized hCHIP and hCHIP-(128–229) with deoxycholate, mixed both proteins at various ratios ranging from 1:0 to 1:20 (hCHIP:hCHIP-(128–229)), and then dialyzed the samples against PBS for an extended time before performing the ubiquitination assay. Not surprisingly, deoxycholate-treated hCHIP was inhibited in its ubiquitination activity (Fig. 9, lane 1), whereas deoxycholate-treated and afterward dialyzed hCHIP exhibited an activity comparable with that of untreated hCHIP (lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, assays containing increasing amounts of hCHIP-(128–229) showed a concentration-dependent decrease in the amount of ubiquitination (Fig. 9, lanes 4 and 5). These results allow the conclusion that hCHIP-(128–229) can inhibit the ubiquitination activity of hCHIP in a concentration-dependent manner only if hCHIP has been previously monomerized. After dimer formation an exchange of partners could not be observed, arguing for a relatively high stability of the dimer. In this study, we determined the quaternary structure of the Hsp70 co-chaperone, CHIP, from H. sapiens and D. melanogaster. Using two independent methods we showed that hCHIP forms dimers, and even at the lowest concentrations tested (200 nm) no monomeric CHIP was detectable. In vivo the amount of hCHIP has been estimated to account for 0.04% of total cellular proteins (5.Connell P. Ballinger C.A. Jiang J. Wu Y. Thompson L.J. Höhfeld J. Patterson C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), resulting in a concentration of hCHIP of around 300 nm. hCHIP thus should largely be dimeric in vivo. The dimerization is mediated by a part of the mixed charge region that is predicted to form a coiled coil. For hCHIP we showed that this domain is necessary and sufficient for dimerization. The CHIP dimers could be in an equilibrium with a tetrameric or even higher oligomeric state, because we observed low abundance bands of corresponding molecular weights in our cross-linking assays, analytical ultracentrifugation, and static light scattering experiments. The formation of such oligomeric states is, however, very concentration-dependent, and higher order oligomers become prominent only at unphysiologically high concentrations. What might be the biological significance of the dimeric state of CHIP? There are several possible explanations. First, dimerization of hCHIP could be essential for efficient competition with the Hsp70-Hsp90-organizing protein Hop for binding to the C termini of the Hsp90 dimer. hCHIP has been shown to reprogram complexes of chaperones with substrates such as the glucocorticoid receptor and redirect the substrates to degradation (5.Connell P. Ballinger C.A. Jiang J. Wu Y. Thompson L.J. Höhfeld J. Patterson C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Hsp90, Hsp70, and their co-chaperones, among them Hop, can be found in these complexes. For both proteins, Hop and hCHIP, it has been shown that the conserved C-terminal EEVD motifs of Hsp90 and Hsp70 are essential for binding (23.Scheufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G. Pegoraro S. Moroder L. Bartunik H. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Cell. 2000; 101: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). Because Hop is a dimeric protein and, in addition, more abundant in mammalian cells than CHIP, dimerization of CHIP may contribute to its ability to compete with Hop in the binding to chaperone-substrate complexes. Second, our results demonstrate that the enzymatic activity of hCHIP depends on the association of two inactive monomers. This could raises the attractive possibility that regulation of dimer formation could control the ubiquitination activity of CHIP. Although no regulatory partner proteins of CHIP have been identified thus far, the situation could be similar to the case of the tumor suppressor protein BRCA1, which is only active as a functional E3 ligase when in a heterodimeric complex with BARD1 (24.Ruffner H. Joazeiro C.A. Hemmati D. Hunter T. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5134-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 25.Hashizume R. Fukuda M. Maeda I. Nishikawa H. Oyake D. Yabuki Y. Ogata H. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14537-14540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Both proteins, BRCA1 and BARD1, carry RING domains, and their dimerization via a four-helix bundle brings the active sites into close apposition. In this context it is interesting that CHIP was recently found to promote trimerization, nuclear localization, and transcriptional activation of the heat shock factor HSF1 through physical interaction with HSF1 and Hsp70 (26.Dai Q. Zhang C. Wu Y. McDonough H. Whaley R.A. Godfrey V. Li H.-H. Madamanchi N. Xu W. Neckers L. Cyr D.M. Patterson C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5446-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). This activity was independent of the ubiquitination activity of CHIP, and it is tempting to speculate that monomeric CHIP interacts with its coiled-coil domain with the coiled-coil domain of HSF1 and with its TPR domain with Hsp70, thereby abrogating the Hsp70-mediated inhibition of HSF1. It was surprising to find that CHIP is not very thermostabile. By circular dichroism spectroscopy a significant loss of secondary structure was observed in wild-type hCHIP at temperatures above 37 °C. However, ubiquitination assays performed at these temperatures yielded only a slight reduction in ubiquitination efficiency. It is therefore possible that CHIP is stabilized at high temperatures by its interaction with chaperones, substrates, and/or E2 enzymes. Our finding that hCHIP-(128–229) can act in a dominant negative fashion to inhibit the function of CHIP also raises the possibility that this fragment could be used as a biotechnological tool to down-regulate the undesired CHIP-mediated degradation of substrates such as the mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR ΔF508) or glucocorticoid receptor (3.Meacham G.C. Patterson C. Zhang W. Younger J.M. Cyr D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 5.Connell P. Ballinger C.A. Jiang J. Wu Y. Thompson L.J. Höhfeld J. Patterson C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In addition, hCHIP-(128–229) may interfere with CHIP-mediated activation of HSF1 and therefore be used to down-regulate the heat shock response. We thank A. Lustig for the performance of analytical ultracentrifugation experiments, M. Vogel for help with circular dichroism spectroscopy, and P. Czarnecki and A.

https://openalex.org/W2078950716,"Endosomal Na+/H+ exchangers are important for salt and osmotolerance, vacuolar pH regulation, and endosomal trafficking. We show that the C terminus of yeast Nhx1 interacts with Gyp6, a GTPase-activating protein for the Ypt/Rab family of GTPases, and that Gyp6 colocalizes with Nhx1 in the endosomal/prevacuolar compartment (PVC). The gyp6 null mutant exhibits novel phenotypes consistent with loss of negative regulation of Nhx1, including increased tolerance to hygromycin, increased vacuolar pH, and decreased plasma membrane potential. In contrast, overexpression of Gyp6 increases sensitivity to hygromycin, decreases vacuolar pH, and results in a slight missorting of vacuolar carboxypeptidase Y to the cell surface. We conclude that Gyp6 is a negative regulator of Nhx1-dependent trafficking out of the PVC. Taken together with its GTPase-activating protein-dependent role as a negative regulator of Ypt6-mediated retrograde traffic to the Golgi, we propose that Gyp6 coordinates upstream and downstream events in the PVC to Golgi pathway. Our findings provide a possible molecular link between intraendosomal pH and regulation of vesicular trafficking.

Taken together with its GTPase-activating protein-dependent role as a negative regulator of Ypt6-mediated retrograde traffic to the Golgi, we propose that Gyp6 coordinates upstream and downstream events in the PVC to Golgi pathway. Our findings provide a possible molecular link between intraendosomal pH and regulation of vesicular trafficking. The acidification of compartments along the biosynthetic, endocytic, and secretory pathway is critical for their cellular function (1Mellman I. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 39-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The low pH environment generated by the vacuolar H+-pumping ATPase is essential for a number of well defined processes, such as the activation of endoproteases and the dissociation of receptor-ligand complexes. In addition to providing an optimal environment for cargo, compartmental pH appears to play a signaling role in controlling vesicular traffic. For example, van Weert et al. (2van Weert A.W. Dunn K.W. Geuze H.J. Maxfield F.R. Stoorvogel W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 821-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 3van Weert A.W. Geuze H.J. Stoorvogel W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 74: 417-423PubMed Google Scholar) showed that intraorganellar acidification was important for late endosome to vacuole trafficking, whereas inhibition of the vacuolar proton pump induces retrograde transport from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) 1The abbreviations used are: TGNtrans-Golgi networkBCECF2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluoresceinCPYcarboxypeptidase YGAPGTPase-activating proteinGEFGTP/GDP exchange factorGFPgreen fluorescent proteinHAhemagglutininMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidNHENa+/H+ exchangerNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidPVCprevacuolar compartment. to the Golgi. In addition to the vacuolar H+-pumping ATPase, the intraendosomal acidification machinery includes a chloride channel and a Na+/H+ exchanger. The activities of these transporters are predicted to be crucial in regulating compartmental pH, consistent with the recent discovery of specific endosomal isoforms of the CLC and NHE gene families in organisms ranging from yeast to human (4Nass R.

Mutations in the CLCN5 gene lead to Dent's disease, clinically manifested as low molecular weight proteinuria, and provide a link between endosomal acidification and regulation of receptor-mediated endocytosis in the proximal kidney tubule (9Lloyd S.E.

In yeast, disruption of the endosomal Na+/H+ exchanger NHX1 leads to defective vesicular trafficking out of the prevacuolar compartment/late endosome, resulting in enlargement of the PVC and a vacuolar protein sorting phenotype (vps44; 10). trans-Golgi network 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein carboxypeptidase Y GTPase-activating protein GTP/GDP exchange factor green fluorescent protein hemagglutinin 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid Na+/H+ exchanger nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid prevacuolar compartment. Although it is increasingly apparent that there is a critical requirement for specific luminal ionic concentration and pH in vesicular trafficking, the molecular basis for this requirement is unknown. The existence of a transmembrane pH sensor protein in the endosomes, which communicates the acidity of the lumen to regulatory proteins in the cytosol, has been postulated (10Bowers K. Levi B.P. Patel F.I. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4277-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 11Zeuzem S. Zimmermann P. Schulz I. J. Membr.

Hypertens. 2002; 11: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). One intriguing regulatory mechanism involves the intraendosomal pH-dependent association of vesicles with a member of the Arf family of small GTPases, its cognate GDP/GTP exchange factor ARNO, and other coat proteins in pancreatic microsomal vesicles and proximal tubule endosomes (11Zeuzem S. Zimmermann P. Schulz I. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 125: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 14Maranda B. Brown D. Bourgoin S. Casanova J.E. Vinay P. Ausiello D.A. Marshansky V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18540-18550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, although the identity of the hypothetical pH sensor remains to be defined, there are emerging insights into the regulatory role of pH in vesicular trafficking. In this work, we forge a new link between endosomal pH and trafficking by demonstrating an interaction between the C-terminal tail of yeast Nhx1 and Gyp6, a protein that activates GTP hydrolysis on the Ypt/Rab family of small GTPases (15Strom M. Vollmer P. Tan T.J. Gallwitz D. Nature. 1993; 361: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). There are six Gyp proteins in yeast which share a conserved catalytic GTPase-activating (GAP) domain. Of the 11 Ypt family members in yeast, Ypt6, the homolog of the mammalian Rab6 GTPase, plays a role in retrieval of proteins from the endosome to the Golgi (16Luo Z. Gallwitz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 791-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Ypt7 is required for fusion of vesicles derived from endosome with the vacuole, through an interaction with the HOPS complex and Vam7, a homolog of the neural SNAP25 protein (17Price A. Seals D. Wickner W. Ungermann C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1231-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 18Ungermann C. Price A. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8889-8891Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Importantly, the preferred substrates of Gyp6 in vitro are Ypt6 and Ypt7 (15Strom M. Vollmer P. Tan T.J. Gallwitz D. Nature. 1993; 361: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Evidence presented in this work supports a functional coupling between Nhx1-dependent events at the donor compartment and Ypt6/Ypt7-regulated vesicle fusion at the acceptor compartment(s). Our functional data, taken together with the physical interaction between Gyp6 and Nhx1, indicate that Gyp6 is a negative regulator of Na+/H+ exchange activity of Nhx1. Because the GAP activity of Gyp6 serves to terminate the active signal in Ypt6-GTP, Gyp6 can also be considered a negative regulator of Ypt6-mediated vesicle fusion in the PVC to Golgi retrograde pathway. Furthermore, we show that Ypt6 and Nhx1 function along the same pathway. We propose a model in which reciprocal interaction of Nhx1 and Ypt6 with a common negative regulator serves to coordinate anterograde and retrograde traffic in the Golgi to PVC pathway. Yeast Strains and Growth Media—Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain PJ64-4A (19James P. Hallady J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used for the yeast two-hybrid screen. Deletion mutants of strain BY4741 (MAT a his3D1 leu2D0 met15D0 ura3D0) and BY4742 (MAT α his3D1 leu2D0 lys2D0 ura3D0) used in this study were purchased from ResGen, Invitrogen. NHX1 deletion in the same background was made essentially as described by Nass et al. (20Nass R. Cunningham K.W. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26145-26152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). All yeast strains were grown in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) or SC medium (minimal medium containing 2% glucose, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and without ammonium sulfate; BIO 101, Inc.). Histidine (30 μg/ml), leucine (0.l mg/ml), uracil (30 μg/ml), methionine (0.1 mg/ml), and lysine (0.1 mg/ml) were added when needed. Growth assays of hygromycin B and low pH sensitivity were in APG medium (10 mm arginine, 8 mm phosphoric acid, 2% glucose, 2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm KCl, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and trace minerals and vitamins). Growth assays were performed by inoculating 1 ml of APG medium with overnight cultures grown in selective SC medium. Cells were washed three times with sterile distilled deionized water prior to inoculation. Growth was monitored by measuring A600 nm after culturing for 24 h at 30 °C. Two-hybrid Screening—A Gal4-based yeast two-hybrid system (19James P. Hallady J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to screen for Nhx1-interacting proteins. The last 119 amino acids from the C-terminal tail of Nhx1 were cloned into the “bait” vector pGAD-C1 (pGAD-NHX1515–633) and used to screen a yeast pGBD-C1 genomic DNA library. 3.5 × 105 Trp+ and Leu+ colonies were screened on quadruple drop-out plates (-Leu, -Trp, -His, and -Ade). Individual colonies containing potentially positive clones were isolated, retested for interaction with Nhx1 on quadruple drop-out plates supplemented with 20 μg/ml X-α-gal (Clontech). Plasmid pGBD-GYP6271–459, containing the C-terminal region of GYP6, was isolated from a positive clone and transformed into Library Efficiency DH5α-competent cells (Invitrogen) for amplification, followed by restriction analysis and sequencing. Recombinant DNA Techniques—The GYP6 gene was cloned by amplification of genomic DNA from S. cerevisiae using PCR and the following primers: sense 5′-CGCGGCACGCGTAAGGATGTCTTACAATGGGCG-3′ and antisense 5′-GGCGCGCGGCCGCTTATTGGCTTATTTTCTTTTGTTC-3′ containing the NotI and MluI restriction sites, respectively. The GYP6 open reading frame was inserted behind the PGK promoter and N-terminally tagged with GFP, CFP, or His6. Plasmid pUG23-GYP8-CFP was a gift from Prof. Dieter Gallwitz (21De Antoni A. Schmitzova J. Trept H.H. Gallwitz D. Albert S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41023-41031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Plasmid harboring NHX1 tagged with either a C-terminal triple HA epitope or GFP tag, under the control of NHX1 endogenous promoter, was described earlier (4Nass R. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21054-21060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). An inverse PCR based strategy was used to generate deletion fragments of the 119-amino acid C-terminal tail of Nhx1 in pGAD-C1 vector (22Gama L. Breitwieser G.E. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 814-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Deletions were confirmed by sequencing. Plasmids were then transformed into PJ64-4A yeast strain along with the C-terminal fragment of GYP6 in pGBD-C1 (pGBD-GYP6271–459) and assayed for reporter gene activation as described above. Extraction of GYP6 from Membranes—Total membrane preparations from yeast strains expressing His::GYP6 and NHX1::HA were prepared as described by Wells and Rao (23Wells K.M. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3401-3407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and treated with one of the following: 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm EDTA, 300 mm KCl, 600 mm NaCl and 50 mm Na2CO3, on ice for 15 min with occasional vortexing. To pellet the insoluble fraction, the mixture was centrifuged at 65,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min in Beckman TLA100.3 rotor. Both soluble (supernatant) and insoluble (pellet) fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Pull-down Assay—Total membrane preparations (1 mg) from yeast expressing His::GYP6 or NHX1::HA or both were solubilized in buffer containing 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm imidazole, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and incubated overnight with Ni-NTA agarose beads at 4 °C. The beads were then washed four times with wash buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm imidazole, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). Proteins were eluted by incubating Ni-NTA beads with 150 mm imidazole buffer and separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and detected with anti-His (Clontech; 1:8,000 dilution) and anti-HA (Covance; 1:2,000 dilution) monoclonal antibodies. Fluorescence Microscopy—Yeast cells were grown in selective medium at 30 °C to logarithmic phase. A 1-ml culture was briefly centrifuged to pellet the cells. The cells were then washed twice with 50 mm succinic acid and 2% glucose solution, pH 5.5, and then resuspended in 50 μl of the same solution. Cell suspensions of 4 μl were dropped on poly-l-lysine-treated coverslips and placed on slides. Samples were viewed on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope equipped with an Ultraview confocal scanner from PerkinElmer Life Sciences using a Zeiss 100× oil immersion lens. Digitized images (16-bit) were acquired with a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER camera and Ultraview imaging software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). FM4-64 staining of the PVC was done in the same solution using a protocol described by Shin et al. (24Shin M.E. Ogburn K.D. Varban O.A. Gilbert P.M. Burd C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41388-41393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) which specifically labels this compartment. CPY Plate Assay—Yeast cultures were freshly grown in SC medium (A600 = 4) and washed with deionized and distilled water. 5-μl aliquots of the dilutions indicated in figure legends were spotted on a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) which was placed on the surface of YPD or SC plates and incubated at 30 °C for 12–18 h. The membranes were lifted and washed with deionized and distilled water to remove all cells. Proteins adsorbed on the membrane were detected by immunoblotting using monoclonal CPY antibody (Molecular Probes; 1:2,000 dilution). Vacuolar pH Measurements—To measure vacuolar pH, seed cultures were grown and washed as described above and then used to inoculate 0.2-ml cultures within a clear bottomed, black 96-well microtiter plate. Growth was monitored by measuring A600 nm after culturing for 18 h at 30 °C in specified growth medium (APG, pH 4.0 and 2.7). Cells were then collected by centrifugation, resuspended in the same specified growth medium containing 50 μm BCECF-acetoxymethyl ester, and incubated at 30 °C for 20–30 min (see Ref. 25Plant P.J. Manolson M.F. Grinstein S. Demaurex N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37270-37279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Cells were collected again by centrifugation, washed three times, resuspended in 200 μl of APG growth medium at the indicated pH, and immediately used for fluorescence measurement. Fluorescent intensity and absorbance values were acquired using a BMG FLUOstar Optima multimode plate reader with accompanying BMG FLUOstar Optima Version 1.20-0 software (BMG Labtechnologies, Durham, NC). Single emission fluorescence intensity readings at 450 nm (I450) and 490 nm (I490) excitation wavelengths and A600 nm readings were acquired, and background fluorescence was measured using BCECF-free cultures. At the end of each experiment, a calibration curve of fluorescence intensity versus pH was obtained for each yeast strain tested by incubating yeast cultures in 200 μl of experimental medium containing 50 mm MES, 50 mm HEPES, 50 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 0.2 m ammonium acetate, 10 mm NaN3,10 mm 2-deoxyglucose, 50 μm carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, titrated to five different pH values within the range of 4.0 to 8.0 using 1 m NaOH (25Plant P.J. Manolson M.F. Grinstein S. Demaurex N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37270-37279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, given that the pKa value of BCECF is near 7.2 (data not shown), the I490 /I450 could not be used to estimate accurately pH values below 5.0, which is the case for vacuolar pH when yeast are gown in low pH media. Thus, as an alternative, background-subtracted I490 values normalized to cell density (NI490) were plotted versus pH (Fig. 1). The figure shows that NI490 values decrease as pH decreases within a pH range of 5.0–4.0. To estimate vacuolar pH, experimental NI490 values from a given strain were compared with a calibration curve generated from the same yeast strain, as growth and the amount of dye loaded varied between strains (data not shown). Data are reported as means ± S.E., and statistical comparisons were performed with Student's two-tailed t tests (paired or unpaired, as appropriate); significance was assumed at the 5% level. Measurement of [14C]Methylammonium Accumulation—Cells were grown in SC with the required supplements to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.4–0.5, washed twice to remove potassium, and resuspended at the same concentration in a potassium starvation medium containing 2% glucose, 50 mm succinic acid (adjusted to pH 5.5 with Tris), and 1% casein hydrolysate (Sigma). After a 4-h incubation, the cells were centrifuged, washed, resuspended in water, and stored on ice. For uptake measurements, the cells were diluted to O.D. 10 in medium containing 4% glucose, 1% casein hydrolysate, and 50 mm succinic acid adjusted to pH 5.5 with Tris. After a 5-min preincubation, [14C]methylamine hydrochloride (0.2 mm and 2.5 μCi/ml final concentration; ICN) was added from concentrated stock solutions. After 40 min of incubation, the transport reaction was stopped by diluting samples of 100 μl with 10 ml of ice-cold 20 mm MgCl2, and cells were collected by vacuum filtration through a 0.45-μm pore size nitrocellulose filter (Millipore HAWP) and washed three times on the filter with 20 mm ice-cold MgCl2. Moist filters were dissolved with 1 ml of N,N,-dimethyl formamide, then 10 ml of scintillation mixture was added (Cytoscint from ICN), and radioactivity was monitored using a Beckman LSA 1801 liquid scintillation counter. The N-terminal transporter domain of the NHE family of Na+/H+ exchangers contains 12 well conserved membrane-spanning segments followed by a more variable C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of 150–350 amino acids (26Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su T. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7942-7949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In representative members of the plasma membrane subfamily of NHE, regulation of exchanger activity by growth hormones, Ca2+/calmodulin, cytoskeletal attachment, and other signaling cascades is well established and is mediated through numerous protein-protein interactions via the C-terminal domain (27Wakabayashi S. Ikeda T. Iwamoto T. Pouvssegur J. Shigekawa M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12854-12861Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 28Lin X. Barber D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Similar information on the newly recognized intracellular subfamily of NHE, which include yeast Nhx1 and human NHE6 and NHE7 (6Numata M. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17387-17394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 7Brett C.L. Wei Y. Donowitz D. Rao R. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1031-C1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), is lacking. To find proteins interacting with Nhx1, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the C-terminal 119 amino acids of Nhx1 cloned into plasmid pGBD-C1 as bait, in conjunction with the yeast genomic library YL2H-C1 (19James P. Hallady J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A total of 3.4 × 105 colonies were screened on quadruple selection (Trp-, Leu-, Ade-, and His-) media, from which several positive clones were obtained. One of these was identified as the C-terminal 188-amino acid fragment of Gyp6, a GAP for the Rab family GTPase, Ypt6. The Nhx1 interacting region of Gyp6, from residue 271 to 459, lies mostly outside the conserved catalytic domain of the Gyp family, which extends from residues 33 to 310 (30Will E. Gallwitz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12135-12139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because the long C-terminal tails of mammalian NHE have discrete subdomains that have been associated with binding to individual physiological partners, we sought to identify the minimal stretch of amino acid sequence in Nhx1 required for interaction with Gyp6. Fig. 2 shows the results from the two-hybrid assay between GYP6271–459 and a set of deletions in the Nhx1 tail domain. The C-terminal 64 amino acids (row f), but not the N-terminal 55 amino acids (row e), of the Nhx1 tail were capable of activating reporter genes in the two-hybrid assay, although the strength of the signal was somewhat less than that of the original 119-amino acid fragment (row d). Extending the length of the C-terminal polypeptide to 85 and 101 amino acids visibly improved the strength of the interaction, as shown in Fig. 2 (rows h and g). Conversely, smaller deletions that removed the extreme C-terminal sequences failed to maintain the two-hybrid interaction (rows i–k). However, the C-terminal 30 amino acids of Nhx1 alone failed to show significant interaction (not shown). Based on these data, we conclude that the extreme C-terminal sequences (about 30 amino acids) of Nhx1 are important but not sufficient for the two-hybrid interaction with Gyp6. It is likely that the intact three-dimensional structure of the C terminus of Nhx1, rather than a discrete sequence motif, mediates binding to Gyp6. Membranes derived from yeast expressing full-length Gyp6 tagged at the N terminus with His6 and C-terminally HA-tagged Nhx1 were solubilized and bound to Ni-NTA beads as described under “Materials and Methods.” The eluates were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-His and anti-HA antibodies to identify Gyp6 and Nhx1, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3, Nhx1-HA was pulled down with His-Gyp6 on the Ni-NTA column, confirming a physical interaction between the two proteins. Of the six Gyp family members that have been described so far in yeast (21De Antoni A. Schmitzova J. Trept H.H. Gallwitz D. Albert S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41023-41031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), little is known about Gyp6 other than its substrate preferences in vitro (30Will E. Gallwitz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12135-12139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We reasoned that colocalization of Gyp6 and Nhx1 in the same membrane compartment would allow a putative functional interaction between the two proteins. Although hydropathy analysis predicts no transmembrane spans in Gyp6, we show here that it is a membrane-associated protein. Following ultracentrifugation of total cell extracts in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (see “Materials and Methods”), His-Gyp6 was entirely associated with the membrane pellet, similar to that observed for Nhx1-HA. To determine the nature of the membrane association, total membrane fractions were washed under a variety of conditions designed to remove peripherally associated proteins, i.e. low ionic strength (20 mm EDTA), high salt (300 mm KCl or 600 mm NaCl), or high pH (50 mm Na2CO3, pH 11). These treatments were able to extract significant amounts of Gyp6 from the pellet to the supernatant fractions (Fig. 4). In contrast, Nhx1 remained in the pellet, as expected for an integral membrane protein. The membrane association of Gyp6 was not altered in the Δnhx1 mutant (not shown). Interestingly, treatment of membranes with 1% Triton X-100 at 0 °C efficiently extracted Nhx1 but not Gyp6. Because proteins associated in lipid rafts are characterized by insolubility in cold Triton X-100, it is possible that Gyp6 localizes to raft domains. Similar results have been reported for the membrane-associated Gyp1 protein (31Du L.L. Novick P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1215-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Gyp1 and Gyp5 have been shown to localize to the Golgi and cytosol, respectively, whereas Gyp8 was recently localized to a compartment distinct from the Golgi, resembling the PVC (21De Antoni A. Schmitzova J. Trept H.H. Gallwitz D. Albert S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41023-41031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 31Du L.L. Novick P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1215-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In preliminary studies using confocal microscopy, we found that GFP-tagged Gyp6 appeared as one or two intensely fluorescent spots/cell, next to the vacuole (not shown). This was reminiscent of our previous observations with Nhx1-GFP (4Nass R. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21054-21060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and suggested that Gyp6, like Nhx1, localized to the prevacuolar compartment in yeast. Fig. 5 confirms the colocalization of CFP-Gyp6 with GFP-Nhx1 in the PVC, which was stained with FM4-64 according to the protocol of Shin et al. (24Shin M.E. Ogburn K.D. Varban O.A. Gilbert P.M. Burd C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41388-41393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that we did not see any obvious change in localization of Gyp6 in the Δnhx1 mutant or vice versa (not shown), arguing against a scaffolding function for the Nhx1 tail in mediating membrane attachment or localization of Gyp6. We also found that CFP-Gyp8 does indeed localize to the PVC, along with GFP-Gyp6 (not shown). Although the GAP activity of Gyp6 is well documented in vitro, there are no phenotypes reported on the deletion or overexpression of Gyp6, and little is known about the physiological role of this protein. A purified glutathione S-transferase fusion of Gyp6 was shown to activate GTP hydrolysis of Ypt6, suggesting a role in Ypt6-mediated retrograde trafficking to the Golgi (16Luo Z. Gallwitz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 791-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 30Will E. Gallwitz D. J. Biol.

However, significant GAP activity was also observed with purified Ypt7, which is involved in PVC to vacuole trafficking (30Will E. Gallwitz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12135-12139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, deletion of NHX1/VPS44 was previously shown to disrupt trafficking out of the PVC (10Bowers K. Levi B.P. Patel F.I. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4277-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that the role of Nhx1 in vesicular traffic may be mediated in part by its interaction with Gyp6, particularly in light of our finding that these two proteins colocalize in the PVC. Here, we show four novel phenotypes associated with Gyp6 which demonstrate its role in vesicular trafficking along the Golgi-PVC-vacuole pathway in yeast and are consistent with a functional interaction with Nhx1. Gyp6-overexpressing Cells Show a CPY Missorting Defect—It is well known that vacuolar protein sorting (vps) mutants display an aberrant secretion of CPY and other vacuolar hydrolases into the extracellular medium (32Rothman J.H.

https://openalex.org/W2065039664,"The NC1 domains of human type IV collagen, in particular α3NC1, are inhibitors of angiogenesis and tumor growth (Petitclerc, E., Boutaud, A., Prestayko, A., Xu, J., Sado, Y., Ninomiya, Y., Sarras, M. P., Jr., Hudson, B. G., and Brooks, P. C. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 8051–8061). The recombinant α3NC1 domain contained a RGD site as part of a short collagenous sequence at the N terminus, designated herein as RGD-α3NC1. Others, using synthetic peptides, have concluded that this RGD site is nonfunctional in cell adhesion, and therefore, the anti-angiogenic activity is attributed exclusively to αvβ3 integrin interactions with non-RGD motifs of the RGD-α3NC1 domain (Maeshima, Y., Colorado, P. C., and Kalluri, R. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 23745–23750). This nonfunctionality is surprising given that RGD is a binding site for αvβ3 integrin in several proteins. In the present study, we used the α3NC1 domain with or without the RGD site, expressed in HEK 293 cells for native conformation, as an alternative approach to synthetic peptides to assess the functionality of the RGD site and non-RGD motifs. Our results demonstrate a predominant role of the RGD site for endothelial adhesion and for binding of αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins. Moreover, we demonstrate that the two non-RGD peptides, previously identified as the αvβ3 integrin-binding sites of the α3NC1 domain, are 10-fold less potent in competing for integrin binding than the native protein, indicating the importance of additional structural and/or conformational features of the α3NC1 domain for integrin binding. Therefore, the RGD site, in addition to non-RGD motifs, may contribute to the mechanisms of endothelial cell adhesion in the human vasculature and the anti-angiogenic activity of the RGD-α3NC1 domain."

Once activated, these highly conserved protein kinase cascades can elicit cellular responses such as transcriptional activation of response genes, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and cell cycle arrest. The mechanism of pathway activation by environmental stresses is in most cases unknown. We have analyzed the activation of the budding yeast “cell integrity” MAPK pathway by heat shock, hypoosmotic shock, and actin perturbation, and we report that different stresses regulate this pathway at different steps. In no case can MAPK activation be explained by the prevailing view that stresses simply induce GTP loading of the Rho1p GTPase at the “top” of the pathway. Instead, our findings suggest that the stresses can modulate at least three distinct kinases acting between Rho1p and the MAPK. These findings suggest that stresses provide “lateral” inputs into this regulatory pathway, rather than operating in a linear “top-down” manner.

Both extracellular signaling molecules and intracellular stresses frequently elicit their specific cellular responses through highly conserved signal transduction modules consisting of protein kinase cascades culminating in the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; GAP, GTPase-activating proteing.1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; GAP, GTPase-activating proteing. (1.Waskiewicz A.J. Cooper J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). MAPKs are a family of serine/threonine protein kinases that are activated by an unusual mechanism involving dual threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation, which is catalyzed by a family of MAPK kinases (MAPKKs). These in turn are phosphorylated and activated by a family of MAPKK kinases (MAPKKKs), and the three kinases of a particular MAPK module are frequently physically associated with each other (sometimes with the help of noncatalytic scaffold proteins) in multimeric complexes (2.Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). In contrast to the highly conserved molecular architecture of the MAPK cascade, the mechanisms whereby various stimuli activate MAPK activity appear to be quite diverse.Perhaps the most extensively investigated instance of MAPK activation involves signal transduction by receptor tyrosine kinases, which activate a MAPK cascade in response to extracellular growth factors (3.van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). Activation of the receptor upon growth factor binding promotes the recruitment of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos to the plasma membrane, where Sos encounters its target GTPase, Ras, leading to GTP loading of Ras. GTP-bound Ras then stimulates a MAPK cascade involving the kinases Raf or Raf-B (MAPKKK), MEK (MAPKK), and ERK (MAPK) (4.Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar).In contrast to the detailed understanding of MAPK cascade activation by growth factors, much less is known about how MAPK pathways are stimulated by cellular stresses. One stress-responsive MAPK that has been extensively studied in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the Slt2p/Mpk1p MAPK, which is activated by the related (and redundant) MAPKKs Mkk1p and Mkk2p, which are in turn activated by the MAPKKK Bck1p (5.Heinisch J.J. Lorberg A. Schmitz H.P. Jacoby J.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). This signaling module has been called the “cell integrity” MAPK cascade, as it is required for proper construction of the cell wall in order to prevent cell lysis (6.Paravicini G. Cooper M. Friedli L. Smith D.J. Carpentier J.L. Klig L.S. Payton M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4896-4905Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 7.Levin D.E. Bartlett-Heubusch E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1221-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Mpk1p is activated in response to various stresses, and Mpk1p activation serves to protect yeast cells from stress by inducing transcription of genes that promote cell wall remodeling and by contributing to the cell cycle arrest triggered by the morphogenesis checkpoint, which delays mitosis until cells have successfully built a bud (5.Heinisch J.J.

Rev. 1998; 62: 1264-1300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Genetic studies established that Pkc1p, the sole protein kinase C homologue in S. cerevisiae, is absolutely required for any activity in the cell integrity MAPK pathway, and acts upstream of the MAPKKK Bck1p (10.Kamada Y. Jung U.S. Piotrowski J. Levin D.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 11.Lee K.S. Levin D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 172-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Several additional functions, independent of the MAPK pathway, have also been ascribed to Pkc1p (12.Perez P. Calonge T.M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Pkc1p activity in turn requires the binding of GTP-loaded Rho1p (13.Kamada Y. Qadota H. Python C.P. Anraku Y. Ohya Y.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5931-5938Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), and GTP loading of Rho1p is mediated by the partially redundant guanine nucleotide exchange factors Rom1p and Rom2p (15.Ozaki K.

By analogy to the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway, it has been suggested that stresses activate the cell integrity pathway by stimulating GTP loading of Rho1p, thereby activating Pkc1p to phosphorylate Bck1p, initiating activation of the kinase cascade (5.Heinisch J.J. Lorberg A. Schmitz H.P. Jacoby J.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 9.Gustin M.C. Albertyn J. Alexander M. Davenport K. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

These include heat shock, hypoosmotic shock, actin depolymerization, and treatment with chlorpromazine, caffeine, vanadate, zymolyase, Congo red, calcofluor, rapamycin, and mating pheromone (8.Harrison J.C.

A simplifying hypothesis to accommodate these observations is that there is a common stressful consequence of all of these treatments that causes cells to activate Mpk1p (10.Kamada Y. Jung U.S. Piotrowski J. Levin D.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). A number of plasma membrane glycoproteins (Wsc1p-3p, Mid2p) that influence Mpk1p activity have been identified, and it is thought that these proteins might act as “stress sensors” that somehow detect cellular stress and transduce a signal to activate Rom1p/Rom2p (16.Philip B. Levin D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 22.Gray J.V. Ogas J.P. Kamada Y. Stone M. Levin D.E. Herskowitz I.

However, these putative stress sensors appear to be dispensable for Mpk1p activation in response to actin depolymerization (8.Harrison J.C. Bardes E.S. Ohya Y. Lew D.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 417-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) or rapamycin (18.Krause S.A. Gray J.V. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 588-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that different stresses might employ distinct pathways to activate Mpk1p. Precedent for stress-specific regulation of MAPK pathways is provided by findings on the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Sty1p pathway, in which it appears that although other stresses activate Sty1p through regulation of its upstream kinases, heat shock activates Sty1p primarily through regulation of Sty1p-directed phosphatases (25.Shieh J.C. Martin H. Millar J.B. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2799-2807PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Shiozaki K. Shiozaki M. Russell P. Mol. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1653-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).In this report, we have dissected the requirements for activation of the cell integrity pathway by different stresses. Our findings are inconsistent with the view that all stresses activate the pathway in a “top-down” manner by stimulating Rho1p GTP loading, resulting in the activation of a linear Pkc1p/Bck1p/Mkk1,2p/Mpk1p kinase cascade. We find that different stresses can activate the pathway by different mechanisms, in one case regulating the core kinases Mkk1,2p/Mpk1p themselves rather than Rho1p or Pkc1p. Thus, different stresses activate Mpk1p through signaling pathways that impact the MAPK cascade at different levels.MATERIALS AND METHODSMedia, Growth Conditions, Stresses, and Drug Treatments—Yeast media (YEPD rich media, synthetic media lacking specific nutrients, and sporulation media) have been described (49.Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 1-933PubMed Google Scholar). For heat shock cells were grown to mid-log phase in media supplemented with 1 m sorbitol at 24 °C and then shifted to 39 °C for 35 min. For Lat-B treatment cells were grown to mid-log phase in media supplemented with 1 m sorbitol at 30 °C and then treated with Lat-B (BioMol Research Laboratories, Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA) at 100 μm for 2 h. For hypoosmotic shock, cells were grown to mid-log phase in media supplemented with 1 m sorbitol at 24 °C, diluted 10-fold into water for ∼1 min, and immediately pelleted and frozen at –80 °C.Strains, Plasmids, and PCR Manipulations—Standard media and methods were used for plasmid manipulations (50.Ausubel F.M.

Open table in a new tab To express Rho1pQ68H in yeast, a 2-kb HindIII/SacI fragment containing RHO1Q68H (29.Madaule P. Axel R. Myers A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), yielding pDLB2257. Integration at the RHO1 genomic locus was targeted by digestion with MluI leaving the endogenous RHO1 gene intact.To express Bck1–20p in yeast, a 6.5-kb XhoI/NotI fragment from pRS314BCK1–20 (11.Lee K.S. Levin D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 172-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) was cloned into pRS306 (51.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), yielding pDLB1774. Integration at the BCK1 genomic locus was targeted by digestion with MluI. Because the MluI site is in the BCK1 promoter, this plasmid can also be integrated next to bck1ΔLEU2.To analyze cells lacking Pkc1p activity, we employed strains in which the only copy of Pkc1p was expressed from the GAL1 promoter (8.Harrison J.C. Bardes E.S. Ohya Y. Lew D.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 417-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These strains were grown in osmotically stabilized dextrose-containing media for at least 36 h to repress Pkc1p.To express Mkk1p in yeast, the MKK1 open reading frame was amplified using primers H83 (5′-CATGCCATGGCTTCACTGTTCAGACCCCCAGAATCTGCG-3′) and H140 (5′-GATCGAGCTCGTATGAATCTTGTATGGAG-3′), digested with NcoI and SacI (sites underlined in primers), and cloned into the corresponding sites in pDLB1610. This expression vector contains a pRS304 backbone (51.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), CDC42 promoter (52.Moskow J.J. Gladfelter A.S. Lamson R.E.

EcoRI/SacI fragments containing the promoter, epitope tags, and MKK1 sequences were then transferred to pRS314 yielding pDLB823 (CEN HA-MKK1).To create the MKK1DD mutant, altering residues Ser-377 and Thr-381 to Asp, we employed an overlap PCR strategy with the end primers H83 and H140 (described above) and complementary “overlap” primers H141 (5′-CCGTTAACGACCTAGCCACAGACTTCACGG-3′) and H142 (5′-CCGTGAAGTCTGTGGCTAGGTCGTTAACGG-3′). The MKK1DD PCR product was subcloned as described above to make pDLB824 (CEN HA-MKK1DD). Overexpression of activated Pkc1p was performed using pDL242 (53.Watanabe M. Chen C.Y. Levin D.E. J. Biol.

McCusker J.H. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1541-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using primers Z288 (5′-CCCCAGTGCTATTAATAGTTTACAATAAAATAGGATCGACGTTGCTATTGCAGCTGAAGCTTCGTACGC-3′) and Z289 (5′-GTAATTTATCAAAACGAAAAGTGTTTGTATAATAGGAGAAAAACAATTCTAGCATAGGCCACTAGTGGATCTG-3′), the linear product was transformed into yeast, and hygromycin-resistant transformants were screened by PCR using primers Z289 and Z292 (5′-CATCTTTCTTTGAACACCGC-3′) to detect homologous recombination yielding ptp2::hygR.Biochemical Procedures—Procedures for cell lysis, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting were as described (8.Harrison J.C. Bardes E.S. Ohya Y. Lew D.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 417-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).RESULTSEffect of RHO1Q68H on Mpk1p Activity—As mentioned in the Introduction, the activity of Pkc1p and subsequent kinases in the cell integrity pathway requires GTP-bound Rho1p. Although it is thought that stresses trigger an increase in GTP loading of Rho1p and in Pkc1p activity, technical limitations have thus far precluded direct measurement of the amount of Rho1p-GTP or of the activity of Pkc1p in vivo. In the case of the mitogenic growth factors that promote GTP loading of Ras, one of the major findings that established the paradigm was that oncogenic mutants of Ras that lock the protein in its GTP-bound state mimic constitutive signaling by the receptors, leading to constitutive ERK activation and uncontrolled proliferation (28.Der C.J. Finkel T. Cooper G.M. Cell. 1986; 44: 167-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). By analogy, we reasoned that expression of a GTP-locked mutant of RHO1 should lead to constitutive Mpk1p activation. Mpk1p activity can be monitored using a phosphospecific antibody that recognizes only the doubly phosphorylated (threonine and tyrosine) form of Mpk1p. Using this reagent, we compared Mpk1p activity in wild-type cells to that in cells that expressed the GTP-locked RHO1Q68H allele (29.Madaule P. Axel R. Myers A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 779-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), analogous to the GTP-locked oncogenic Ras mutant RasQ61H (28.Der C.J. Finkel T. Cooper G.M. Cell. 1986; 44: 167-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar).Previous studies showed that overexpression of RHO1Q68H from the strong GAL1 promoter triggered the accumulation of multiple transcripts known to be responsive to Mpk1p activity (30.Roberts C.J. Nelson B. Marton M.J. Stoughton R. Meyer M.R. Bennett H.A. He Y.D. Dai H. Walker W.L. Hughes T.R. Tyers M. Boone C. Friend S.H. Science. 2000; 287: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar), indicating that Mpk1p had indeed been activated by excess GTP-Rho1p. However, GAL1-RHO1Q68H also caused dramatic actin depolarization, through a pathway that required Pkc1p but not Mpk1p (31.Delley P.A. Hall M.N. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). This result raised the possibility that Mpk1p activation in GAL1-RHO1Q68H strains was the result of actin stress induced by overexpression. To assess whether more physiological (and therefore less disruptive) activation of Rho1p would activate Mpk1p, we introduced a single integrated copy of RHO1Q68H expressed from the RHO1 promoter into a wild-type strain (in addition to wild-type RHO1). Single-copy RHO1Q68H caused detectable but much less severe actin depolarization than GAL1-RHO1Q68H (data not shown), suggesting that limited hyperactivation of Pkc1p took place, but the cells were viable and proliferated normally. However, the activity of Mpk1p in cells with a single integrated copy of RHO1Q68H was indistinguishable from that in wild-type cells (Fig. 1A). The simplest interpretation of this result is that additional GTP loading of Rho1p (without overexpression) does not automatically elevate Mpk1p activity. Alternatively, constitutive activation of Rho1p might provoke adaptive desensitization of the pathway, returning Mpk1p activation to basal levels. If these cells were desensitized, then we would expect that they would no longer activate Mpk1p in response to stress. However, activation of Mpk1p in response to stress from heat shock, hypoosmotic shock, or actin depolymerization was completely unaffected by RHO1Q68H (Fig. 1B). This stress responsiveness was not because of Rho2p (which has some functional overlap with Rho1p (15.Ozaki K. Tanaka K. Imamura H. Hihara T. Kameyama T. Nonaka H. Hirano H. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2196-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 32.Schmidt A. Bickle M. Beck T. Hall M.N. Cell. 1997; 88: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar)), because similar results were obtained in cells lacking Rho2p (Fig. 1B). These results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that Mpk1p regulation occurs simply by modulating Rho1p GTP loading, and imply that significant regulation of the cell integrity pathway must occur downstream from Rho1p, presumably by regulating the activity of one or more of the downstream kinases.Regulatory or Permissive Roles for the Cell Integrity Kinases?—For each of the kinases upstream of Mpk1p in the cell integrity pathway, one can ask whether regulation of that kinase is important for the activation of Mpk1p in response to a given stress. Previous studies demonstrated that these kinases are each absolutely required for Mpk1p activity (10.Kamada Y. Jung U.S. Piotrowski J. Levin D.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 11.Lee K.S. Levin D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 172-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 13.Kamada Y. Qadota H.

Biol. 1993; 13: 3076-3083Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), but that requirement does not discriminate whether a given kinase plays an active role in stress-mediated Mpk1p activation or a passive role providing a constitutive pathway input that is then modulated at a level downstream of that kinase by stress-responsive signaling pathways. In the latter scenario, it should be possible to dispense with a particular kinase entirely yet retain stress-responsive Mpk1p activity if an alternative source for the constitutive pathway input could be found. In the studies reported below, we have employed mutant alleles of BCK1 and MKK1 to provide a constitutive pathway input in the absence of the normally essential upstream kinases (Pkc1p and Bck1p, respectively).To provide a constitutive pathway input in the absence of Pkc1p, we employed the previously described BCK1–20 allele (11.Lee K.S. Levin D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 172-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The lethality of the PKC1 deletion is suppressed by the dominant BCK1–20 allele, a result that we confirmed in our strain background (Fig. 2A). Bck1p is a large 1478-amino acid kinase with a C-terminal catalytic domain (residues 1175 to 1440), and Bck1–20p contains a missense mutation immediately upstream of the kinase domain (Ala-1174 to Pro) (11.Lee K.S. Levin D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 172-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Bck1–20p is thought to encode a constitutively activated, Pkc1p-independent form of Bck1p that mimics Pkc1p-phosphorylated Bck1p, although the Pkc1p-targeted phosphorylation sites on Bck1p have not yet been mapped (11.Lee K.S. Levin D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 172-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Suppression of pkc1Δ and bck1Δ phenotypes by activated alleles of Bck1p and Mkk1p.

Wild type (DLY1), mkk1Δ mkk2Δ (DLY4351), or bck1Δ (DLY3994) cells carrying vector alone (pRS314), MKK1 (pDLB823), or MKK1DD (pDLB824) plasmids as indicated were streaked onto –trp media (left plate) and also onto a YEPD plate containing 10 mm caffeine (right plate). Cells lacking activity of the Pkc1p/Mpk1p pathway cannot grow on this media (see text). In the absence of Bck1p, wild type Mkk1p is inactive and cannot support pathway activity. bck1Δ cells carrying MKK1DD, however, are viable on caffeine suggesting that Mkk1pDD is activated and does not require Bck1p for its function.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To provide a constitutive pathway input in the absence of Bck1p, we constructed the MKK1DD allele. In other MAPK cascades, MAPKK activation by the MAPKKK involves the phosphorylation of two conserved serine residues on the MAPKK (34.Yan M. Templeton D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19067-19073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1123-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Mutation of these residues to aspartic acid mimics phosphorylation, yielding constitutively active MAP-KKs (26.Shiozaki K. Shiozaki M. Russell P. Mol. Biol.

By analogy to these earlier studies we generated a mutant, MKK1DD, predicted to encode an activated version of Mkk1p. Mkk1pDD was expressed at levels comparable with those of wild-type Mkk1p (data not shown), and it was functional by the criterion that it could rescue the caffeine sensitivity of mkk1Δ mkk2Δ cells (Fig. 2C) (yeast cells lacking components of the cell integrity pathway are unable to grow on medium containing 10 mm caffeine, presumably because of thei"

We previously demonstrated that antibiotic production in Streptomyces coeli-color A3(2) and Streptomyces lividans can be enhanced by RNA polymerase (RNAP) mutations selected for the rifampicin-resistant (Rifr) phenotype. Here, we have shown that the introduction of a certain RifrrpoB mutation into a B. subtilis strain resulted in cells that overproduce an aminosugar antibiotic 3,3′-neotrehalosadiamine (NTD), the production of which is dormant in the wild-type strain. Mutational and recombinant gene expression analyses have revealed a polycistronic gene ntdABC (formally yhjLKJ) and a monocistronic gene ntdR (formally yhjM) as the NTD biosynthesis operon and a positive regulator for ntdABC, respectively. Analysis of transcriptional fusions to a lacZ reporter revealed that NTD acts as an autoinducer for its own biosynthesis genes via NtdR protein. Our results also showed that the RifrrpoB mutation causes an increase in the activity of σA-dependent promoters including ntdABC promoter. Therefore, we propose that unlike the wild-type RNAP, the mutant RNAP efficiently recognized the σA-dependent promoters, resulting in the dramatic activation of the NTD biosynthesis pathway by an autoinduction mechanism.

The ability of bacteria to survive in a wide range of adverse environmental conditions depends on diverse molecular mechanisms that adjust gene expression pattern in response to changing environment.

Rifampicin (Rif) inhibits transcription initiation by blocking the β subunit of bacterial RNAP (1Wehrli W. Knusel F. Schmid K. Staehelin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Many Rif-resistant (Rifr) mutants have been isolated and characterized in various bacteria, notably Escherichia coli. To our knowledge, most Rifr mutations are found within the rpoB gene that encodes the β subunit of RNAP (3Ezekiel D.H. Hutchins J.E. Nature. 1968; 220: 276-277Google Scholar, 4Wehrli W. Knusel F.

E. coli RifrrpoB mutations that suppress the auxotrophy due to lack of stringent response were demonstrated to affect the transcription of stringently controlled genes by destabilizing the RNAP-stable RNA promoter complex (7Zhou Y.N. Jin D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2908-2913Google Scholar). Recently, we successfully activated the secondary metabolism (antibiotic production) by introducing certain RifrrpoB mutations in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) and Streptomyces lividans (8Hu H. Ochi K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 1885-1892Google Scholar, 9Hu H. Zhang Q. Ochi K. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3984-3991Google Scholar, 10Lai C. Xu J. Tozawa Y. Okamoto-Hosoya Y. Yao X.

On the basis of those findings, we proposed that improvement of RNAP by introduction of a Rifr mutation can be useful to elicit bacterial ability by altering the gene expression in a variety of microorganisms. The members of the genus Bacillus produce several antibiotics to inhibit growth of the competing organisms in nature. Neotrehalosadiamine (3,3′-diamino-3,3′-dideoxy-α,β-trehalose; NTD), which is an aminosugar antibiotic produced by Bacillus pumilus (12Tsuno T. Ikeda C. Numata K. Tomita K. Konishi M. Kawaguchi H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1986; 39: 1001-1003Google Scholar) and Bacillus circulans (13Numata K. Satoh F. Hatori M. Miyaki T. Kawaguchi H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1986; 39: 1346-1348Google Scholar), inhibits growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae (but not Escherichia coli), although the inhibitory mechanism is not yet elucidated. Unlike B. pumilus and B. circulans, Bacillus subtilis normally does not produce this antibiotic. However, we found that one of the Rifr mutations isolated here activates the dormant ability to produce NTD in B. subtilis. In this paper, the mechanism by which production of this antibiotic is activated by the Rifr mutation is discussed.

Open table in a new tab To monitor the promoter activities of ntdABC and ntdR, each upstream region (490 bp from the translational start codon) was amplified by PCR with the primer pairs PntdA-F and PntdA-R for ntdABC promoter and PntdR-F and PntdR-R for ntdR promoter. The amplified fragment was cloned into pCR2.1 and fully sequenced to confirm the correct sequence. Each EcoRI fragment containing the upstream region of ntdABC or ntdR was inserted into the EcoRI site of pDL2 (16Fukuchi K. Kasahara Y. Asai K. Kobayashi K. Moriya S. Ogasawara N. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1573-1583Google Scholar), resulting in plasmids pDL2-PntdA and pDL2-PntdR, respectively. For overexpression of NTD biosynthesis operon in B. subtilis, the 430-bp fragment encoding N-terminal part of NtdA was synthesized by PCR with primers ntdA-F and ntdA-R and cloned at the EcoRV site of pHASH120 by a TA cloning method as described by Ohashi et al. (17Ohashi Y. Ohshima H. Tsuge K. Itaya M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2003; 221: 125-130Google Scholar), resulting in pHASH120-ntdA. Similarly, for overexpression of ntdBC (but not ntdA) in B. subtilis, the 240-bp fragment encoding the N-terminal part of NtdB was amplified by PCR with primers ntdB-F and ntdB-R and cloned into pHASH120, resulting in pHASH120-ntdB. To express the NTD biosynthesis operon in E. coli, the full length of the ntdABC coding region (3.2 kb) was amplified by PCR with the primers ntdA-F2 and ntdC-R. The EcoRI-BamHI fragment was cloned into the corresponding region of pUC18, generating pUC18-ntdABC. A part of the fragment containing PCR errors was replaced with the other corresponding fragment. To generate pMutinT3-ntdR, the DNA fragment containing a Shine-Dalgarno sequence, and the N-terminal coding region was amplified by PCR with the primers ntdR-F and ntdR-R. A HindIII-BamHI fragment was cloned into pMutinT3 (18Moriya S. Tsujikawa E. Hassan A.K. Asai K. Kodama T. Ogasawara N. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 179-187Google Scholar), resulting in a plasmid pMutinT3-ntdR. For disruption of the ntdR gene, the partial internal coding region of ntdR gene (510 bp) was amplified by PCR with the primers ΔntdR-F and ΔntdR-R and cloned into plasmid pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). The EcoRI fragment containing the partial ntdR gene was subcloned into pUC18 (Takara), resulting in pUC18-ntdR. A 1.3-kb SmaI fragment containing the neo gene derived from pBEST501 (19Itaya M. Kondo K. Tanaka T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4410Google Scholar) was inserted at the EcoRV site within the ntdR gene in pUC18-ntdR, creating pUC18-ntdR::neo. To determine the transcriptional start point of ntdR, the PCR fragment synthesized with PntdR-F and ntdR-R2 was cloned into pCR2.1 and fully sequenced. An EcoRI-SalI fragment was subcloned into plasmid pUB18, which is plasmid pUB110 (20Gruss A. Ehrlich S.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 231-241Google Scholar) containing multicloning sites derived from pUC18, generating pUB18-ntdR. For the expression of His-tagged NtdR, the PCR fragment synthesized with ntdR-F2 and ntdR-R2 was cloned into pCR2.1 and fully sequenced. A BamHI-SalI fragment containing the full length of the ntdR coding region was inserted into the expression vector pQE80L (Qiagen), generating pQE80L-NtdR. E. coli harboring the resultant plasmid can express His6-tagged NtdR protein, which is extended with Met-Arg-Gly-Ser-His6-Gly-Ser at the N terminus. For the selection of B. subtilis transformants, Rif (2 μg/ml), erythromycin (Erm; 0.5 μg/ml), spectinomycin (100 μg/ml), neomycin (3 μg/ml), and chloramphenicol (5 μg/ml) were used. For the selection of E. coli transformants, ampicillin (100 μg/ml) was used. NTD Production—B. subtilis cells were precultured in S7N medium at 37 °C for 12 h with vigorous shaking. The cultures were then diluted 50-fold in a fresh S7N medium and cultivated for the indicated time under the same conditions. The growth of E. coli was monitored in M9 medium supplemented with 0.1% yeast extract. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; final concentration 10 mm) was added to the growth medium when the culture reached A650 = 0.5. Antibiotic activity was determined by the paper disk-agar diffusion assay using S. aureus 209P as the test organism. The culture supernatants (50 μl) obtained after centrifugation were applied onto a paper disk (diameter 8.0 mm; Advantec), and the paper disk was placed on a half-strength Mueller Hinton agar (Difco) plate inoculated with S. aureus 209P. Isolation and Purification of NTD—The culture supernatant (400 ml) of strain TI91R5 prepared after 24-h cultivation was adsorbed on a column of Dowex 50W × 8 (NH4+ form). The column was eluted with 250 ml of 50 mm ammonium acetate and 100 ml of 1 m NH4OH solutions, successively. The second eluate was concentrated in vacuo, subjected to a SiO2 gel column chromatography, and then eluted with 300 ml of 65% CH3CN solution. The active fractions were collected and evaporated to yield a brown material. This material was chromatographed using a column packed with Sephadex LH-20 resin in 50% CH3OH to obtain a brown solid (140 mg). The brown solid (20 mg) was further purified by high pressure liquid chromatography (Capcell pack NH2, 4.6 × 150 mm; Shiseido) using 90% CH3CN as a mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and monitored by refractive index. The resulting compound (purity >95%) was analyzed by mass spectrometry and13C NMR spectrometry. High resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR-ESI-MS) was performed on a Brucker Daltonics ApexII 70e mass spectrometer. 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Brucker DRX600 spectrometer operating at 150.09 MHz. Transposon Mutagenesis—For transposon mutagenesis, the temperature-sensitive mini-Tn10-containing vector pIC333 was used as described by Steinmetz and Richter (21Steinmetz M. Richter R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1761-1763Google Scholar). We selected colonies that were resistant to spectinomycin but sensitive to Erm and then tested for their ability to produce NTD by cultivating the isolates for 24 h in S7N medium. The mutants resistant to both spectinomycin and Erm were not subjected to the NTD production test. NTD-nonproducing mutants were selected for further analysis. Assay for β-Galactosidase Activity—Strains were grown aerobically in S7N medium, and samples were withdrawn every 1 h during 10-h cultivation. β-Galactosidase activity was measured as described previously (22Inaoka T. Ochi K. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3923-3930Google Scholar). Thermostable β-galactosidase (BgaB) activity was also measured by the same method, except that the samples were incubated at 62 °C. Primer Extension—Strain 84R5 for ntdABC or 61884 harboring pUB18-ntdR for ntdR was grown in S7N medium and harvested at t0 (the time points of transition from exponential to stationary phase) or t4 (4 h after t0), with corresponding A650 of 1.5 and 8.0, respectively. The total cellular RNAs were prepared using the Isogen reagent (Nippon Gene). To remove the contaminated DNA, the prepared RNAs were treated with 10 units of DNase I (amplification grade; Invitrogen) at 25 °C for 15 min. DNase I was inactivated by the addition of EDTA and heat treatment at 65 °C for 10 min. After ethanol precipitation, a total of 50 μg of RNA was incubated with 1 pmol of an infrared dye-labeled primer, IRD800-ntdA (5′-IRD800-TTGTTTCCACCGCTCGTTTAC-3′) (Aloka) for ntdABC or IRD800-ntdR (5′-IRD800-TCCGAGCTAAATAATTGGGAGTG-3′) for ntdR, at 80 °C for 15 min. After annealing, 5 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 10 μl of 5-fold First-Strand buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 375 mm KCl, and 15 mm MgCl2) and 5 μl of dNTP mix (10 mm each of dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP) were added. To 50 μl of this reaction mixture, 200 units of SuperScript II (Invitrogen) was added followed by incubation at 42 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, 1 μl of RNase mixture (Ambion) was added to the reaction mixture and further incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After ethanol precipitation, primer extension and sequencing reactions with the corresponding primer were run on polyacrylamide gel. Analysis was done using DNA sequencing system LIC-4200L(S)-2 (LI-COR). Purification of His6-tagged Protein—E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring pQE80L-NtdR was grown aerobically to A650 = 0.6 at 37 °C in L medium supplemented with 1% glucose. IPTG was then added to a final concentration of 2 mm, and the culture was further incubated for 4 h. E. coli cells were harvested and disrupted by sonication. The cell lysate was centrifuged (8,000 × g for 10 min) to remove insoluble material. The soluble His6-tagged protein was purified using the TALON purification kit (Clontech) as described in the manufacturer's manual. The purified protein was dialyzed against 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). The RNAP holoenzyme containing His6-tagged β′ subunit was purified as described by Fujita and Sadaie (23Fujita M. Sadaie Y. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 221: 185-190Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—DIG Gel Shift Kit (Roche Applied Science) was used for the gel retardation assay. The internal region (100 bp) between ntdA and ntdR was amplified with primers PntdR-R and PntdA-R (see Table II) and used for the labeling reaction. The 100-fold diluted probe was incubated at 25 °C for 15 min with or without His6-tagged NtdR, varying amounts of NTD, trehalose, and neotrehalose in 15 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 30 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Tween 20, and poly(dA-dT)). DNA and DNA-protein complexes were separated on 7% nondenaturing PAGE, transferred onto a membrane (Hybond-N+; Amersham Biosciences), and detected as described in the manufacturer's manual. A Rifr RNAP Mutation Activates Neotrehalosadiamine Production—To investigate the effect of rpoB mutation in B. subtilis, we isolated a number of spontaneous Rifr mutants on L agar plate containing 100 μg/ml Rif. Of these isolates, 40 strains were tested for their ability to produce antibiotic. As a result, a total of 16 mutants were found to produce a significantly increased amount of antibiotic. Antibiotic production by the mutant 84R5 is shown in Fig. 1 as an example. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that all the mutants with enhanced antibiotic production had an identical mutation at Ser-487 (corresponding to Ser-531 in E. coli) to Leu (rpoB5) in RNAP β-subunit. The other mutants were found to have a substitution mutation of His-482 (corresponding to His-526 in E. coli) to Arg (rpoB2), Tyr (rpoB6), or Pro (rpoB32) (Table III). Since all of the rpoB5-back-cross transformants tested produced antibiotic as much as 84R5, rpoB5 mutation was responsible for the observed activation of antibiotic production.Table IIIMutations found in rpoB gene in Rifr mutantsStrainRelevant genotypeNucleotide substitutionAmino acid substitutionHomologous rpoB positionsRif resistanceaDetermined after 12 h of incubation on L agar plate.Antibiotic productionbAntibiotic production was determined after 24 h of cultivation in S7N medium as described in the legend to Fig. 1. −, no inhibition zone; ++, inhibition zone of 25 mm.E. coliS. coelicolorμg/ml61884wt(rpoB+)<0.1−84R5rpoB51460C→T487S→L531S442N>100++84R2rpoB21445A→G482H→R526H437H>100−84R6rpoB61444C→T482H→Y526H437H>100−84R32rpoB321445A→C482H→P526H437H>100−a Determined after 12 h of incubation on L agar plate.b Antibiotic production was determined after 24 h of cultivation in S7N medium as described in the legend to Fig. 1. −, no inhibition zone; ++, inhibition zone of 25 mm. Open table in a new tab When B. subtilis strain 61884 is grown in S7N medium, cells produce the dipeptide antibiotic bacilysin after 8 h of cultivation (15Inaoka T. Takahashi K. Ohnishi-Kameyama M. Yoshida M. Ochi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2169-2176Google Scholar). A mutant TI91, which does not produce bacilysin, cannot accumulate antibiotic activity against S. aureus (15Inaoka T. Takahashi K. Ohnishi-Kameyama M. Yoshida M. Ochi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2169-2176Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the introduction of the rpoB5 mutation into the mutant TI91, designated TI91R5, activated the antibiotic production (data not shown). Moreover, the rpoB5 mutation did not influence the expression of the bacilysin biosynthesis operon (data not shown). Consequently, the rpoB5 mutation was thought to activate a novel gene(s) for antibiotic production in B. subtilis. Therefore, we isolated the antimicrobial substance produced by TI91R5 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The purified antimicrobial substance was positive for ninhydrin reaction and adsorbed in a cation exchange column chromatography. No UV maximum was observed in the aqueous solution. HR-ESI-MS and 13C NMR spectral data demonstrated that this antimicrobial substance is identical to NTD which was previously isolated from B. pumilus (12Tsuno T. Ikeda C. Numata K. Tomita K. Konishi M. Kawaguchi H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1986; 39: 1001-1003Google Scholar) and B. circulans (13Numata K. Satoh F. Hatori M. Miyaki T. Kawaguchi H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1986; 39: 1346-1348Google Scholar). The chemical properties are summarized in Table IV. NTD production of strain 84R5 reached as high as 500-1000 μg/ml after 24 h of cultivation, whereas the parental rpoB+ strain produced less than the detectable level (<1 μg/ml) (data not shown).Table IVChemical properties of the isolated compound and NTDIsolated compoundNTDaThe data on the physico-chemical property are from Tsuno et al.

Open table in a new tab Identification of the Genes Involved in NTD Production—To identify the genes involved in NTD synthesis, we performed transposon mutagenesis of strain 84R5 using the mini-Tn10 delivery vector pIC333 (21Steinmetz M. Richter R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1761-1763Google Scholar). Of the 1,800 mutant isolates with mini-Tn10 insertion tested for NTD production, we found three mutants were unable to produce NTD. These three mutants were all found to have a Tn10-insertional mutation within the polycistronic operon yhjLKJ (we renamed ntdABC in this study) (Fig. 2). Even when the ntdA downstream genes (ntdB and ntdC) was expressed from a powerful S10 promoter originating from the large S10 ribosomal gene cluster in strain Y8-19 (rpoB5 ntdA::Tn10), NTD production was no longer detected, indicating that blocking the NTD synthesis by Tn10 insertion was not simply due to polar effect on ntdB and ntdC (Fig. 2). The gene products of ntdA, ntdB, and ntdC were putatively identified to be pyridoxal phosphate-dependent aminotransferase, hydrolase, and NADH-dependent dehydrogenase, respectively. To confirm whether NTD synthesis is dependent upon ntdABC transcription, we replaced its promoter in rpoB+ strain 61884 with a S10 promoter. The resulting recombinant TI139 carrying S10 promoter-dependent ntdABC produced NTD just as strain 84R5 (Fig. 2), suggesting that the activation of NTD production by rpoB5 mutation resulted from the activation of ntdABC promoter. The ntdR gene (formerly yhjM), which locates inversely in the upstream region of ntdABC operon, encodes a putative LacI family transcriptional regulator. To elucidate the possible function of NtdR protein on NTD production, we constructed the ntdR interruption mutant (TI125R5) carrying IPTG-inducible spac promoter-dependent ntdR (Fig. 2). Strain TI125R5 did not accumulate NTD without the ntdR induction (in the absence of IPTG). On the other hand, the NTD production in TI125R5 was induced when IPTG was added into the culture broth. These results suggest that NtdR protein takes part in the regulatory mechanism for NTD production. The ntdABC Operon Encodes a Complete Set of Genes for NTD Biosynthesis—We also investigated whether or not the ntdABC operon was the structural gene for NTD biosynthesis. The ntdABC operon was cloned into a high copy number plasmid, pUC18, and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) under the control of lac promoter (see “Experimental Procedures”). An E. coli strain harboring pUC18-ntdABC displayed a prolonged growth lag phase compared with the vector control (Fig. 3A), although no growth inhibition was observed when a high concentration (1,000 μg/ml) of NTD was added exogenously. TLC analysis revealed that a ninhydrin-positive spot with a corresponding retention factor of NTD was detected in the culture broth of cells expressing ntdABC (Fig. 3B). Moreover, the peak at m/z 363 that represents the mass of NTD [M + Na]+ was also detected in the culture broth, as determined by ESI-MS spectrometry analysis (Fig. 3C). In contrast, no peak was detected at m/z 363 when a sample from the cells harboring the vector control was analyzed (data not shown). The amount of NTD produced by the ntdABC-harboring E. coli was ∼5 μg/ml. These results strongly indicate that ntdABC operon contains a complete set of genes required for NTD biosynthesis. This is another instance of “exogenous” antibiotic production in E. coli, following the previous report on erythromycin production in E. coli (24Pfeifer B.A. Admiraal S.J. Gramajo H. Cane D.E. Khosla C. Science. 2001; 291: 1790-1792Google Scholar). Transcriptional Analysis of NTD Biosynthesis Gene and Its Regulator—The pDL2-derivative plasmids allow the creation of the promoter-lacZ fusion at the amyE locus via a double crossover event (16Fukuchi K. Kasahara Y. Asai K. Kobayashi K. Moriya S. Ogasawara N. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1573-1583Google Scholar). To monitor the transcription of ntdABC and ntdR, we constructed a strain carrying ntdABC-lacZ or ntdR-lacZ transcriptional fusion. The transcription level of ntdABC in rpoB5 mutant was 20-50-fold higher than that in the rpoB+ st"

In the present study, we observed that the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels in serum and its gene expression in adipose tissue were up-regulated in aged OLETF rats, model animals of obese type 2 diabetes. To study the mechanism of PAI-1 up-regulation, we examined the effect of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and the product of lipid peroxidation (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE)), both of which are endogenously generated under carbonyl stress. Stimulation of primary white adipocytes by either AGE or HNE resulted in the elevation of PAI-1 in culture medium and at mRNA levels. The up-regulation of PAI-1 was also observed by incubating the cells in high glucose medium (30 mm, 48 h). The stimulatory effects by AGE or high glucose were inhibited by antioxidant, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, and reactive oxygen scavenger, probucol, suggesting a pivotal role of oxidative stress in white adipocytes. We also found that the effect by HNE was inhibited by antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine and that a specific inhibitor of glutathione biosynthesis, l-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine, augmented the effect of subthreshold effect of HNE. Bioimaging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by a fluorescent indicator, 6-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, revealed ROS production in white adipocytes treated with AGE or HNE.

The pathological conditions of diabetes with obesity have been widely associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive carbonyl species (RCS), which may be key intermediates leading to diabetic complications. RCS originates from a multitude of mechanistically related pathways, like glycation (10Thornalley P.J. Langborg A. Minhas H.S. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar) and lipid peroxidation (11Fu M-X. Requena J.R. Jenkins A.J. Lyons T.J. Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9982-9986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Glycation, a spontaneous amino-carbonyl reaction between reducing sugars and proteins, is a major source of RCS production. The complex reaction sequence is initiated by the reversible formation of a Schiff base, which undergoes an Amadori rearrangement to form a relatively stable ketoamine product during early glycation. A series of further reactions involving sugar fragmentation and formation of α-dicarbonyl compound yield stable advanced glycation end products (AGEs) under chronic hyperglycemia (12Vlassara H. Ann. Med. 1996; 28: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 13Singh R. Barden A. Mori T. Beilin L. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 129-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1970) Google Scholar). Carbonyl stress also leads to the intracellular formation of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), one of the active end products of lipid peroxidation. Interestingly, RCS and AGEs can exert their detrimental cellular effects by increasing ROS production (14Lander H.M. Tauras J M. Ogiste J.S. Hori O. Moss R.A. Schmidt A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17810-17814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar), thereby forming a vicious cycle of ROS and RCS production. In the present study, to investigate the mechanisms underlying increased PAI-1 levels in obese diabetic conditions, we performed both in vivo and in vitro studies. For in vivo studies, gene expression and secretion of PAI-1 were measured in visceral adipose tissue using OLETF (Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima fatty) rats, model animals of obese type II diabetes (15Kawano K. Hirashima T. Mori S. Saitoh Y. Kurosumi M. Natori T. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 1422-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In parallel with the progression of diabetes, serum levels of both AGE and malondialdehyde derived from lipid peroxidation were shown to increase (16Nakamura S. Makita Z. Ishikawa S. Yasumura K. Fujii W. Yanagisawa K. Kawata T. Koike T. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 895-899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Tsuji T. Mizushige K. Noma T Murakami K. Ohmori K. Miyatake A. Kohno M. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2001; 38: 868-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For in vitro studies, we examined the effects of AGE and HNE on the PAI-1 activity and its gene expression in rat white adipocytes differentiated in vitro. We focused on the role of carbonyl stress in the upregulation of PAI-1 expression. Animals—Male OLETF rats, model animals of Type II diabetes mellitus established in 1990 at Tokushima Research Institute (Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) (15Kawano K. Hirashima T. Mori S. Saitoh Y. Kurosumi M. Natori T. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 1422-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), were generously supplied at 4 weeks of age. Male LETO (Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka) rats served as normal controls. These animals were kept in an air-conditioned room (23 ± 2 °C, 55 ± 5% humidity) lighted 14 h a day (06:00 to 20:00) and were maintained on a standard diet and water ad libitum. These rats were sacrificed at 12, 20, 30, and 50 weeks of age, and blood was collected for determination of the plasma PAI-1 and 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). Immediately after decapitation, visceral fat was dissected out and frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in a deep freezer (–80 °C) until use. At 29 weeks of age, OLETF and LETO rats were divided into four groups, which were injected with probucol (3, 10, or 30 mg/kg subcutaneously) or vehicle (0.1% Me2SO containing ethanol) for 7 days. Cell Culture—White fat precursor cells were isolated from epididymal fat pad of 4-week-old male Wistar-Imamichi rats. Briefly, the minced tissue was incubated in a HEPES-buffered solution, pH 7.4, containing 0.2% collagenase type II (Sigma) for 20 min at 37 °C with vortexing every 5 min. After incubation, the tissue remnants were filtered through a 250-μm nylon screen into plastic test tubes. The tubes were placed on ice for at least 30 min to allow the mature white fat cells and lipid droplets to float on the surface of the cell suspension. The infranatant (stromal-vascular fraction) was collected and filtered through a 25-μm nylon screen to remove cell aggregates. The stromalvascular fraction containing precursor cells was pelleted by a centrifugation for 10 min at 700 × g and resuspended in the culture medium. The cells were plated in six-well multiplates and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (containing 5.55 mm glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 nm insulin, 25 mg/ml sodium ascorbate, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 4 mm glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were grown at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air and characterized morphologically on days 11–13 after plating. At this stage, the cells were recognized to be differentiated to mature white adipocytes. AGE-BSA at the concentrations of 0.01, 0.03, 0.1 and 0.3 mg/ml and nonglycated BSA as a control at the concentrations of 0.1 and 0.3 mg/ml were added to the cells. The cells were exposed to AGE-BSA or BSA for 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 h. Antioxidants such as 10 μm pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC) and 50 μm probucol were added to the culture medium 9 h prior to the harvest of the cells. HNE dissolved with 0.1% Me2SO at the concentrations of 3, 10, 30, and 100 μm were added to the cells. The cells were exposed to HNE for 2, 4, 8, and 16 h. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), a precursor of glutathione, and l-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine (BSO), a γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase inhibitor, were added to the cells for 24 h at the concentrations of 1, 5, and 20 mm and 10, 50, and 100 μm, respectively. Preparation of AGE—AGEs were prepared by incubating 50 mg/ml BSA (fraction V, fatty acid-free, low endotoxin; Sigma) with 0.5 m glucose-6-phosphate in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (10 mm, pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 4 weeks as described (18Doi T. Vlassara H. Kirstein M. Yamada Y. Striker G.E. Striker L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2873-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 19Esposito C. Cerlach H. Brett J. Stern D. Vlassara H. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 1387-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Unmodified BSA was incubated under the same conditions without glucose-6-phosphate as controls. Unincorporated sugar was removed by dialysis against PBS. The concentrations of glycated BSA and control BSA was measured by the method of Lowry et al. (20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Measurement of PAI-1 Levels in Serum and Culture Medium—PAI-1 levels were determined by measuring of active PAI-1 in the culture medium as follows. After 9–11 days of culture, the medium was replaced with 1 ml of fresh medium with 0.1% instead of 10% fetal bovine serum. AGE-BSA or HNE was added at concentrations of 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, or 0.3 mg/ml or 3, 10, 30, or 100 μm, respectively. In some cells, antioxidants (10 μm PDTC or 50 μm probucol), a glutathione precursor (1, 5, or 20 mm NAC), or a γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase inhibitor (10, 50, or 100 μm BSO) was added to the culture medium 9 h or 24 h prior to the harvest of cells. For the high glucose experiments, the cells were incubated in 30 mm glucose for 48 h. During the last 24 h of incubation, the medium was replaced with 1 ml of fresh medium containing 30 mm glucose with 0.1% instead of 10% fetal bovine serum. In some experiments, the cells were incubated in 30 mm glucose in combination with antioxidants (10 μm PDTC or 50 μm probucol) for 48 h. After incubation, PAI-1 concentrations of the culture medium were determined using a rat PAI-1 ELISA kit (Molecular Innovations, Royal Oak, MI) and were expressed as nanograms of active PAI-1 released from white adipocytes/mg of cell protein. Protein contents of the cells were determined as follows. The cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped from dishes with rubber policemen into 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and were sonicated for 15 s. After precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid, the proteins were measured by the method of Lowry et al. (20Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PAI-1 levels in the serum were detected using the same ELISA kit. Because we used ELISA kit plated on t-PA antigen, the amount and activity of PAI-1 are simultaneously monitored. Measurement of 8-OHdG in Serum—Serum samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was used for determination of 8-OHdG by a competitive ELISA (8-OHdG Check; Japan Institute for Control of Aging, Fukuroi, Shizuoka, Japan). Detection of PAI-1 mRNA by Northern Blotting—Total RNAs was isolated from visceral adipose tissue or white fat cells by using Isogen (Nippongene, Toyama, Japan) and 10 μg of total RNAs/lane were separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel containing 6% formaldehyde, followed by blotting onto nylon filters (Hybond-N; Amersham Biosciences). The blots were prehybridized in Expresshybri solution (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 68 °C and then hybridized with 32P-labeled rat PAI-1 cDNA probe for 1 h at the same temperature. Ribosomal RNAs of 28 S stained with ethidium bromide were utilized as an internal control for the amounts of total RNAs loaded. PAI-1 mRNA levels and 28 S ribosomal RNAs were quantified on autoradiograms using Fluor-S laser scanning densitometry (Fluor-S MultiImager; Bio-Rad). The levels of PAI-1 mRNA were expressed as fold increases over controls after correcting with 28 S ribosomal RNA levels. Intracellular ROS Fluorescence Imaging—To detect intracellular ROS, 6-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) (Molecular Probe, Eugene, OR) was used. DCF-DA diffuses into cells and is hydrolyzed by intracellular esterases to polar 6-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein. This nonfluorescent fluorescein analog is trapped in cells and can be oxidized to highly fluorescent 6-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein by intracellular oxidants. The cells on day 9 of culture were exposed to 0.1 mg/ml AGE-BSA or 30 μm HNE for 8 h. After washing twice with PBS(+), 10 μm of DCF-DA was loaded for cells for 30 min. Some cells were pretreated with 10 μm of PDTC for 9 h or 20 mm of NAC for 24 h. Then cells were examined under an inverted fluorescent microscope (IXE70; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an excitation (470–490 nm) and emission (515 nm) filter for fluorescein. Digital images of the fluorescent microscope images were obtained with a CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) and stored in a Macintosh G3 (Apple Japan, Tokyo, Japan). Detection of IκB-α by Western Blotting—Rat white adipocytes on day 9 were exposed to 0.1 mg/ml of AGE for 15 min or 30 μm of HNE for 15 min and were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and lysed with lysis buffers (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2% SDS, 6% β-mercaptoethanol, 1% glycerol). Each whole cell lysate was then treated with sample buffers for 5 min at 100 °C. The samples were run on 10% SDS-PAGE slab gels. The gel was transblotted on a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond ECL; Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with skim milk (10 mg/ml) for blocking. After washing, the nitrocellulose membranes were immunoblotted with a polyclonal anti-IκB-α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or monoclonal anti-actin (Chemicon international, Temecula, CA) and then with polyclonal peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham Biosciences) or anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Biosciences) as a secondary antibody. Bound antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized by exposure of the membrane to autoradiography films. The intensity of each band was quantitatively analyzed using Fluor-S laser scanning densitometry (Flour-S MultiImager; Bio-Rad). Enhanced Expression of PAI-1 in Adipose Tissue from OLETF Rats—We examined the serum levels of PAI and its gene expression in adipose tissue from OLETF rats. The serum PAI-1 levels in OLETF rats began to increase at the age of 20 weeks and reached a maximum at the age of 50 weeks, whereas those in control LETO rats remained unchanged (Fig. 1A). The PAI-1 mRNA levels in visceral fat of OLETF rats, but not in LETO rats, increased in parallel with the progression of serum PAI-1 (Fig. 1B). The serum glucose levels of OLETF rats at the ages of 12, 20, 30, and 50 weeks were 120.2 ± 5.6, 160.7 ± 15.2, 397.4 ± 30.5, and 367.5 ± 66.8 mg/dl, respectively, whereas there were no changes in those of LETO rats (123.2 ± 6.5, 121.3 ± 7.6, 123.3 ± 2.9, and 117.2 ± 10.4, respectively). Thus, we confirmed that OLETF rats developed spontaneous and persistent hyperglycemia after the age of 20 weeks as originally described (15Kawano K. Hirashima T. Mori S. Saitoh Y. Kurosumi M. Natori T. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 1422-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), which we found correlated well with the increased expression of PAI-1 in visceral fat. Correlation between Serum PAI-1 and Serum 8-OHdG—The relationship between the serum PAI-1 and the serum 8-OHdG (8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine) levels is represented in Fig. 2A. In OLETF rats, a significant correlation was observed between the serum PAI-1 and the 8-OHdG levels (Fig. 2A; r = 0.65, p < 0.001). In contrast, there was no correlation between those two parameters in control LETO rats (Fig. 2A, r = 0.10, NS). Thus, serum PAI-1 could be associated with oxidative stress during the development of diabetes in OLETF rats. Therefore, we examined the effect of probucol, a potent antioxidant, on PAI-1 activity, its gene expression, and serum 8-OHdG concentration. At the age of 30 weeks, the increased levels of serum PAI-1, 8-OHdG and adipose tissue PAI-1 mRNA in OLETF rats were suppressed by successively injected probucol in a dose-dependent manner. However, in LETO control rats, there was no increase in either serum PAI-1 or 8-OHdG level, which was not affected by probucol. Moreover, enhanced expression of PAI-1 mRNA in visceral fat was never observed in vehicle-injected 30-week-old LETO rats (Fig. 2, B and C). Up-regulation of PAI-1 Expression in White Adipocytes by AGEs—Because up-regulation of PAI-1 was observed in in vivo studies using OLETF rats, we performed in vitro studies by directly examining the effect of AGEs on PAI-1 expression in white fat cells in primary culture. AGE-BSA increased PAI-1 activity in culture medium released from white adipocytes differentiated in culture. As shown in Fig. 3A, white adipocytes on days 9–11 exposed to AGE-BSA for 8 h showed a concentration-dependent increase in PAI-1 with a significant elevation at concentrations of 0.1 and 0.3 mg/ml. Time course studies indicated that cells treated with 0.1 mg/ml AGE-BSA showed a steady increase in PAI-1 accumulation in the media by 8 h, and the rate of PAI-1 accumulation was reduced markedly thereafter (Fig. 3B). The PAI-1 accumulation in AGE-BSA-treated cells during 8 h of incubation was approximately twice as high as that in BSA-treated cells. To clarify whether or not the AGE-BSA-induced stimulation of PAI-1 secretion involves activated transcription, PAI-1 mRNA expression was studied by Northern blotting. AGE-BSA induced a concentration-dependent increase in PAI-1 mRNA in white adipocytes (Fig. 3C). White adipocytes exposed to 0.1 mg/ml of AGE-BSA showed a time-dependent increase in PAI-1 mRNA (Fig. 3D). Inhibition of AGE- and High Glucose-induced Increase in PAI-1 Expression by Antioxidant (PDTC) and Reactive Oxygen Scavenger (Probucol)—We further investigated the involvement of oxidative stress in the up-regulation of PAI-1 expression by AGE. As shown in Fig. 4, AGE enhanced PAI-1 expression at both protein and mRNA levels, which could be inhibited by either PDTC (antioxidant) or probucol (reactive oxygen scavenger). Moreover, to examine whether this effect of AGE can be observed also by hyperglycemia, the cells were incubated in high glucose for 48 h. Thirty mm glucose induced an increase in PAI-1 activity and gene expression compared with the control cells incubated in conventional medium (5.55 mm glucose). This enhancement by high glucose was also inhibited by PDTC or probucol (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Inhibition of hyperglycemia-induced increase in PAI-1 expression by antioxidant (PDTC) and reactive oxygen scavenger (probucol). The cells on days 9–11 were incubated with 30 mm glucose (hyperglycemia) or 5.55 mm glucose (normoglycemia) for 48 h. Ten μm PDTC or 50 μm probucol was simultaneously added to the culture. During the last 24 h of incubation, the medium was replaced with 1 ml of fresh medium containing 30 mm glucose and PDTC or probucol with 0.1% instead of 10% fetal bovine serum. PAI-1 concentrations in culture media were measured by ELISA and total RNAs extracted from cells were subjected to Northern blotting.

The effect of an increasing concentration of HNE on PAI-1 expression was determined (Fig. 6, A and C). HNE at concentrations of 30 and 100 μm increased PAI-1 expression 8 h after addition. Time course studies indicated that Me2SO-treated control cells showed a steady increase in PAI-1 accumulation in the media by 8 h, and the rate of PAI-1 accumulation was reduced markedly thereafter. The addition of HNE (30 μm) significantly increased the accumulation of PAI-1 during 8 h of incubation twice as high as Me2SO-treated cells (Fig. 6B). The PAI-1 mRNA levels began to increase 4 h after the addition of HNE and reached a maximum at 8 h (Fig. 6 D). Inhibition of HNE-induced Increase in PAI-1 Expression by Antioxidant (NAC) and Augmentation of Subthreshold Effect of HNE on PAI-1 Expression by a Glutathione Synthesis Inhibitor (BSO)—As shown in Fig. 7, the increases in PAI-1 activity and PAI-1 mRNA by 30 μm HNE were inhibited dose-dependently by antioxidant (NAC). On the other hand, at concentrations of 10–100 μm, a glutathione synthesis inhibitor, l-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine, which favors intracellular redox environment to reduced state, augmented the effect of subthreshold concentration of HNE (3 μm) on PAI-1 expression (Fig. 8).Fig. 8Augmentation of the effect of HNE in PAI-1 activity and its gene expression by a glutathione synthesis inhibitor, BSO. The cells on days 9–11 were treated with 30 μm HNE or 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide for 8 h. BSO at concentrations of 10, 50, and 100 μm was added to the culture for 24 h. PAI-1 concentrations in culture media were measured by ELISA, and the total RNAs extracted from cells were subjected to Northern blotting. A, augmenting effects of BSO on PAI-1 concentrations.

The fluorescent microscopic images are shown in Fig. 9 (A and B). Cells stimulated with 0.1 mg/ml AGE-BSA for 8 h showed substantial fluorescence 30 min after the addition of 10 μm DCF-DA, whereas minimum fluorescence was observed in unglycated BSA-treated cells. The increase in the fluorescence of white adipocytes stimulated by AGE-BSA was markedly inhibited by 10 μm PDTC (Fig. 9A). Moreover, the stimulatory action of AGE was mimicked by exogenously added HNE. The generation of ROS stimulated by HNE in white adipocytes was blocked by pretreatment with antioxidant, NAC (Fig. 9B). Furthermore, to examine whether the ROS generation under enhanced carbonyl stress could activate the transcription factor NF-κB, we monitored the degradation of IκB-α, an inhibitory subunit of NF-κB, in rat white adipocytes exposed to AGE or HNE. As shown in Fig. 9C, Western blotting revealed that both AGE and HNE markedly reduced IκB-α levels, which were blocked by pretreatment with PDTC or NAC, respectively. A variety of observations suggests that elevated levels of plasma and adipose tissue PAI-1 are frequently found in obese humans (7McGill J.B. Schneider D.J. Arfken C.L. Lucore C.L. Sobel B.E.

Yamashita S. Miura M. Fukuda Y. Takemura K. Tokunaga K. Matsuzawa Y. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Increased plasma PAI-1 levels may contribute to the impaired endogenous fibrinolysis and the increased cardiovascular risk of patients with visceral fat accumulation and/or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Despite this well documented link between elevated PAI-1 levels and obesity, little is known about the origin of this plasma inhibitor in obesity or about signals that control its biosynthesis. In the present study, we first showed that circulating PAI-1 was progressively increased during the development of diabetes and hyperglycemia in OLETF rats, and this elevation of PAI-1 accompanied a concomitant increase in PAI-1 mRNA from visceral fat, suggesting that visceral fat tissue can be an important source of elevated PAI-1 in circulation.

https://openalex.org/W2072769231,"Fast synaptic inhibition in the mammalian central nervous system is mediated primarily via activation of the γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABAA-R). Upon agonist binding, the receptor undergoes a structural transition from the closed to the open state. This transition, known as gating, is thought to be associated with a sequence of conformational changes originating at the agonist-binding site, ultimately resulting in opening of the channel. Using site-directed mutagenesis and several different GABAA-R agonists, we identified a number of highly conserved charged residues in the GABAA-R β2 subunit that appear to be involved in receptor activation. We then used charge reversal double mutants and disulfide trapping to investigate the interactions between these flexible loops within the β2 subunit. The results suggest that interactions between an acidic residue in loop 7 (Asp146) and a basic residue in pre-transmembrane domain-1 (Lys215) are involved in coupling agonist binding to channel gating.

Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 569-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar). Experimental evidence suggests that the GABA-binding site lies within an asymmetric pocket formed at the interface between the α and β receptor subunits (5Boileau A.J. Newell J.G. Czajkowski C. J.

The channel “gate” in the GABAA-R is believed to be formed by charged residues in the TM1-TM2 loop (9Karlin A.L. Nat. Rev.

The binding of agonist triggers a complex structural transition that results in the opening of the gate, allowing ions to flow through the channel. The mechanisms by which this occurs remain poorly defined. γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor transmembrane domain TM2-TM3 linker piperidine 4-sulfonate analysis of variance CuSO4:1,10-phenanthroline dithiothreitol acetylcholine-binding protein nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor transmembrane domain TM2-TM3 linker piperidine 4-sulfonate analysis of variance CuSO4:1,10-phenanthroline dithiothreitol acetylcholine-binding protein nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The nature of the coupling between binding and channel opening in this receptor family has been recently investigated in several laboratories. Interactions between charged residues in the flexible loops 2 and 7 in the extracellular domain and those in the short linker between the second and third transmembrane domains (TM2-3L) of the GABAA-R α1 subunit have been implicated in the process of receptor activation (12Kash T.L. Jenkins A. Kelley J.C. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Nature. 2003; 421: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent report suggests that the pre-TM1 region is critical for receptor activation in the closely related serotonin (5-HT3) receptor (13Hu X.-Q. Zhang L. Stewart R.R. Weight F.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46583-46589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this study, we used site-directed mutagenesis and a number of GABAA-R agonists of varying efficacies to examine the contribution of the corresponding flexible loops in the GABAA-R β2 subunit to receptor activation. Based on previous studies (12Kash T.L. Jenkins A. Kelley J.C. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Nature. 2003; 421: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 13Hu X.-Q. Zhang L. Stewart R.R.

Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1758-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and the presence of highly conserved charged residues (see Fig. 1), we hypothesized that interactions between charged residues in these domains are crucial for coupling agonist binding to channel gating. We tested this hypothesis using a charge reversal double mutant approach, by inverting the hypothetical interacting pair of residues (e.g. Asp146-Lys215 to Lys146-Asp215), and then assaying receptor function. A strong restoration of function relative to either of the single mutant receptors is consistent with a strong interaction between the charged residues. Mutagenesis—Full-length cDNAs encoding the GABAA-R α1 (human), γ2 (human), and β2 (rat) subunits were expressed via the pCIS2 vector, which contains one copy of the strong promoter from cytomegalovirus and a polyadenylation sequence from simian virus 40. Point mutations in the GABAA-R β2 subunit were created using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and confirmed as described previously (12Kash T.L. Jenkins A. Kelley J.C. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Nature. 2003; 421: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). 2Mutagenic primer sequences are available upon request. GABAA-Rs were expressed in HEK293 cells, maintained, and transfected as described (15Krasowski M.D. Nishikawa K. Nikolaeva N. Lin A. Harrison N.L. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 41: 952-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Electrophysiology and Data Analysis—Recordings were made 48-72 h after transfection at room temperature (20-22 °C) using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique (15Krasowski M.D. Nishikawa K. Nikolaeva N. Lin A. Harrison N.L. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 41: 952-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Concentration-response curves were determined for GABA in wild-type and mutant GABAA-Rs as described (12Kash T.L. Jenkins A. Kelley J.C. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Nature. 2003; 421: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The relative efficacies (ϵ) of piperidine 4-sulfonate (P4S) and taurine were defined as ϵ = Imax(partial)/Imax(GABA), where Imax(partial) is the maximal current elicited by a saturating concentration of either P4S or taurine, and Imax(GABA) is the maximal current elicited by a saturating concentration of GABA. All data are reported as means ± S.E. Statistical significance was assessed using either Student's two-tailed unpaired t test or, where appropriate, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the appropriate post-test. Cross-linking experiments were performed essentially as described previously (16Horenstein J. Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. Akabas M.H. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Cu:phen solutions were prepared by diluting stock solutions of CuSO4 and 1,10-phenanthroline (Sigma) to 100 and 400 μm, respectively, in buffer. In experiments in which dithiothreitol (DTT) was used, a 10 mm solution was made fresh daily in buffer. When GABA was co-applied with Cu:phen, a saturating GABA concentration was used to ensure that all of the channels were in the activated state during the period of reagent application. The percent modulation was ((IGABA(after) - IGABA(before))/(IGABA(before))) × 100, where IGABA(before) is the peak current of the initial GABA applications, and IGABA(after) is the peak current of the GABA test pulses after the application of reagent. Molecular Modeling—The molecular model of a GABAA-R β2 subunit was built using a previously described homopentameric GABAA-R α1 subunit model as a template (12Kash T.L. Jenkins A. Kelley J.C. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Nature. 2003; 421: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 17Bertaccini E. Trudell J.R. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 2001; 48: 141-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primary sequence of a GABA-R β2 subunit was threaded onto the backbone coordinates of one of the α subunits in a model of the GABAA-R α1 homopentamer using the Homology module of Insight II (Version 2000.1, Accelrys, San Diego, CA). Short loops were generated where gaps occurred in the alignment between the two sequences. The β2 subunit was optimized in the presence of the remaining α1 subunits to preserve appropriate intersubunit contacts. We refined the entire model using the autorotomer feature in the Biopolymer module of Insight II. Backbone atoms (carbon, α-carbon, and nitrogen) of each residue were then tethered to their initial coordinates with a force constant of 100 kcal/A2; coulombic interactions were calculated with the default cell multipole method with a constant dielectric of 1; and the structure was optimized with the Discover module of Insight II. The structure was relaxed by performing 5000 1-fs steps of molecular dynamics at 400 K and was then re-optimized with the Discover module to a derivative of 1 kcal/Å2. Characterization of Mutations in the TM2-TM3 Linker of the GABAA-R β2Subunit—The amino acid sequences of the GABAA-R β subunits were aligned and compared with those of the GABAA-R α1 and α2 subunits and the acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP) (Fig. 1). Previous reports have suggested that TM2-3L of the GABAA-R α subunit is involved in receptor activation (12Kash T.L. Jenkins A. Kelley J.C. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Nature. 2003; 421: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 18O'Shea S.M. Harrison N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22764-22768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To determine whether this domain in the GABAA-R β2 subunit plays a similar role, we created point mutations R269A, R269D, L272A, K274D, and K279D at positions corresponding to mutations in the GABAA-R α subunit that are important for receptor function (12Kash T.L. Jenkins A. Kelley J.C. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Nature. 2003; 421: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 18O'Shea S.M. Harrison N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22764-22768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The mutant receptors were then characterized by determining GABA concentration-response curves. A comparison of the GABA responses of the wild-type α1β2γ2s GABAA-R (Fig. 2A) and the mutant α1β2(R269A)γ2s GABAA-R (Fig. 2B) demonstrates the decreased sensitivity of the mutant receptor to GABA. The β2(R269A) and β2(K274D) mutations caused a significant reduction in GABA sensitivity, whereas the GABA sensitivity of the β2(L272A), β2(R269D), and β2(K279D) mutations was indistinguishable from that of the wild-type receptor (Fig. 2C and Table I).Table IProperties of single mutant receptorsGABAA-REC50 for GABAnH for GABAImaxnμMpAWild-type17 ± 21.2 ± 0.1680 ± 20049β2(R269A)57 ± 17ap < 0.05 (values that are significantly different compared with the wild-type receptor value using Student's unpaired t test).1.0 ± 0.2880 ± 2108β2(R269D)16 ± 21.4 ± 0.1590 ± 806β2(L272A)22 ± 61.3 ± 0.21400 ± 240ap < 0.05 (values that are significantly different compared with the wild-type receptor value using Student's unpaired t test).8β2(K274D)111 ± 32bp < 0.01.1.5 ± 0.1700 ± 9012β2(K279D)11 ± 21.0 ± 0.1450 ± 308β2(E52K)26 ± 91.1 ± 0.2700 ± 1005β2(D56K)57 ± 11bp < 0.01.1.3 ± 0.1145 ± 30ap < 0.05 (values that are significantly different compared with the wild-type receptor value using Student's unpaired t test).7β2(D139K)163 ± 25cp < 0.001.1.3 ± 0.1420 ± 809β2(D146K)177 ± 33cp < 0.001.1.7 ± 0.1cp < 0.001.470 ± 7013β2(E147K)23 ± 91.0 ± 0.1720 ± 1509β2(R141E)31 ± 61.3 ± 0.2670 ± 2208β2(R142E)19 ± 31.1 ± 0.2760 ± 2009β2(K215D)104 ± 17bp < 0.01.1.4 ± 0.11380 ± 4208β2(R216D)27 ± 41.0 ± 0.11100 ± 1908β2(N217D)18 ± 21.2 ± 0.1740 ± 2308a p < 0.05 (values that are significantly different compared with the wild-type receptor value using Student's unpaired t test).b p < 0.01.c p < 0.001. Open table in a new tab Determination of Agonist Efficacy in Mutants—The potency of the agonist (measured here as the EC50 for GABA) can be influenced at either step in the simplified receptor activation pathway: agonist binding or isomerization from the closed to open state (18O'Shea S.M. Harrison N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22764-22768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 19del Castillo J. Katz B. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1957; 146: 369-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With high efficacy agonists (E > 10), slight reductions in the ability of the agonist-bound receptor to isomerize from the closed to open state typically produce a reduction in sensitivity to agonist, but little reduction in maximal response. This can create a problem in the interpretation of the effects of receptor mutations, as the effects of modest changes in efficacy can closely resemble the effects of mutations that alter agonist binding affinity (20Colquhoun D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 924-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). The use of low efficacy agonists (“partial agonists”) circumvents this problem. Mutations that alter agonist efficacy will reduce the maximal current elicited by a saturating concentration of partial agonist (20Colquhoun D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 924-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). We used the low efficacy GABAA-R agonist P4S (7Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 67-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Corringer P.J. Le Novere N. Changeux J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Neurobiol. 2001; 48: 141-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to investigate the effects of these mutations. A comparison of the saturating P4S responses of the wild-type α1β2γ2s GABAA-R (Fig. 2D) and the mutant α1β2(R269A)γ2s GABAA-R (Fig. 2E) in HEK293 cells demonstrates the reduction in the relative efficacy (ϵ) of P4S for the mutant receptor. The β2(R269A) and β2(K274D) mutations caused a significant reduction in P4S relative efficacy, whereas the relative efficacy of P4S for the β2(L272A), β2(R269D), and β2(K279D) mutations was indistinguishable from that for the wild-type receptor (Fig. 2F). Characterization of Mutations in Loops 2 and 7 of the GABAA-R β2Subunit—To determine the role of charged residues in these domains, we created the following β2 subunit mutations: E52K, D56K, D139K, R141E, R142E, D146K, and E147K. The β2(D56K), β2(D139K), and β2(D146K) mutations caused a significant reduction in GABA sensitivity, whereas the β2(E52K), β2(E147K), β2(R141E), and β2(R142E) mutations had no effect on GABA sensitivity (Table I). In addition, the β2(D56K), β2(D139K), and β2(D146K) mutations caused a significant reduction in the relative efficacy of P4S, whereas this was unchanged in the β2(E147K) and β2(E52K) mutations (Fig. 3A). We also examined receptor sensitivity to another partial agonist, taurine, and found that the mutations reduced the relative efficacy in a similar manner (Fig. 3B). Characterization of Mutations in the Pre-TM1 Region of the GABAA-R β2Subunit—A previous report has suggested that a cluster of conserved basic residues in the pre-TM1 region of the 5-HT3 receptor are involved in receptor activation (13Hu X.-Q. Zhang L. Stewart R.R. Weight F.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46583-46589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To determine whether these residues have a similar role in the GABAA-R β2 subunit, we created the following β2 subunit mutations: K215D, R216D, and N217D. GABA sensitivity was significantly reduced by the β2(K215D) mutation and was unchanged by the β2(R216D) and β2(N217D) mutations (Table I). The β2(K215D) and β2(R216D) mutations caused a significant reduction in P4S relative efficacy, whereas the β2(N217D) mutation had no effect (Fig. 3A). Taurine relative efficacy was significantly reduced in the β2(K215D) mutation, but was unchanged in the β2(R216D) and β2(N217D) mutations (Fig. 3B). Characterization of Charge Reversal Double Mutants—Using charge reversal double mutants, we previously demonstrated that specific residues in loops 2 and 7 interact with TM2-3L of the GABAA-R α1 subunit (12Kash T.L. Jenkins A. Kelley J.C. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Nature. 2003; 421: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). To determine whether similar interactions might occur in the GABAA-R β2 subunit, we created and characterized the following double mutants: E52K,K274D, D56K,K274D, D139K,K274D, D146K,K274D, and E147K,K274D. All of these double mutant receptors were less sensitive to GABA compared with the wild-type receptor (Table II). We also created and characterized a second series of double mutants in which charges were exchanged between loops 2 and 7 and the pre-TM1 region in the GABAA-R β2 subunit. In several of these double mutant receptors, notably β2(D146K,K215D), the sensitivity to GABA was substantially restored, approaching the EC50 for the wild-type receptor, and significantly improved relative to the corresponding single mutants (Table II). In addition, the relative efficacy of P4S for the β2(D146K,K215D) double mutant receptor was enhanced relative to that for β2(D146K) (Fig. 4B).Table IIProperties of double mutant receptorsGABAA-REC50 for GABAnH for GABAImaxnμMpAWT17 ± 21.2 ± 0.1680 ± 20049β2(E52K,K274D)70 ± 13ap < 0.01 (values that are significantly different compared with the wild-type receptor value using Student's unpaired t test).1.3 ± 0.2360 ± 809β2(D56K,K274D)101 ± 8bp < 0.001.1.2 ± 0.1360 ± 4011β2(D139K,K274D)109 ± 29ap < 0.01 (values that are significantly different compared with the wild-type receptor value using Student's unpaired t test).1.3 ± 0.1402 ± 859β2(D146K,K274D)234 ± 52ap < 0.01 (values that are significantly different compared with the wild-type receptor value using Student's unpaired t test).1.5 ± 0.1cp < 0.05.250 ± 7011β2(E147K,K274D)88 ± 23ap < 0.01 (values that are significantly different compared with the wild-type receptor value using Student's unpaired t test).1.4 ± 0.1750 ± 15011β2(E52K,K215D)66 ± 3ap < 0.01 (values that are significantly different compared with the wild-type receptor value using Student's unpaired t test).1.1 ± 0.1460 ± 406β2(D56K,K215D)43 ± 9cp < 0.05.1.2 ± 0.11000 ± 8012β2(D139K,K215D)33 ± 4cp < 0.05.1.0 ± 0.1950 ± 1608β2(D146K,K215D)26 ± 41.2 ± 0.11200 ± 14010β2(E147K,K215D)62 ± 11cp < 0.05.1.3 ± 0.3910 ± 2309β2(D56K,R216D)73 ± 18ap < 0.01 (values that are significantly different compared with the wild-type receptor value using Student's unpaired t test).0.9 ± 0.1ap < 0.01 (values that are significantly different compared with the wild-type receptor value using Student's unpaired t test).990 ± 1809β2(D139K,R216D)63 ± 13ap < 0.01 (values that are significantly different compared with the wild-type receptor value using Student's unpaired t test).1.1 ± 0.1790 ± 12010β2(D146K,R216D)68 ± 16ap < 0.01 (values that are significantly different compared with the wild-type receptor value using Student's unpaired t test).1.0 ± 0.1cp < 0.05.1204 ± 19014β2(E147K,R216D)65 ± 13ap < 0.01 (values that are significantly different compared with the wild-type receptor value using Student's unpaired t test).1.0 ± 0.11060 ± 12013a p < 0.01 (values that are significantly different compared with the wild-type receptor value using Student's unpaired t test).b p < 0.001.c p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab Disulfide Trapping Experiments—To examine the relative proximity and mobility of the domains investigated in this study, a disulfide bond trapping technique was utilized (16Horenstein J. Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. Akabas M.H. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 21Yu H. Kono M. McKee T.D. Oprian D.D.

We analyzed the interaction between cysteine residues inserted at potential contact points by examining the effects of oxidation and reduction on the function of wild-type and double mutant receptors. The ability to induce disulfide bond formation was assayed by studying the effect of the oxidizing reagent Cu:phen on receptor function. In the wild-type receptor, application of Cu:phen or the reducing agent DTT had no effect on receptor function in the absence or presence of GABA (Fig. 5A). Similarly, the single mutant receptors incorporating D56C, D139C, D146C, K215C, or K274C were also unaffected by Cu:phen or DTT (data not shown). Application of Cu:phen alone and in the presence of GABA significantly inhibited receptor function in all of the loop 2 and 7 and TM2-3L double cysteine mutants (Fig. 5D). This effect was reversed following incubation with 10 mm DTT (Fig. 5B). In double cysteine mutants between loops 2 and 7 and the pre-TM1 region, Cu:phen alone had no effect, whereas Cu:phen plus GABA significantly inhibited receptor function (Fig. 5, C and E). All of the mutants investigated in this study were unaffected by treatment with the reducing agent DTT (10 mm), indicating there were no spontaneously formed disulfide bonds (data not shown). TM2-TM3 Linker Mutations—Recent work has begun to illuminate the mechanisms of receptor activation in the Cys loop ligand-gated ion channel superfamily. In particular, studies of inherited mutations in the glycine receptor (23Rajendra S. Lynch J.W. Pierce K.D. French C.R. Barry P.H. Schofield P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18739-18742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) (24Gomez C.M. Maselli R. Gammack J. Lasalde J. Tamamizu S. Cornblath D.R. Lehar M. McNamee M. Kuncl R.W. Ann. Neurol. 1996; 39: 712-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) first revealed the importance of the TM2-3L region. Naturally occurring mutations in TM2-3L have been reported to have strong inhibitory (23Rajendra S. Lynch J.W. Pierce K.D. French C.R. Barry P.H. Schofield P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18739-18742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or facilitatory (24Gomez C.M. Maselli R. Gammack J. Lasalde J. Tamamizu S. Cornblath D.R. Lehar M. McNamee M. Kuncl R.W. Ann. Neurol. 1996; 39: 712-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) effects on receptor function that are unrelated to agonist binding, leading to the idea that this loop is intimately involved in the coupling of ligand binding to ion channel opening. In this study, we have identified two mutations in TM2-3L of the β2 subunit (R269A and K274D) that interfere with receptor function by reducing agonist efficacy. Furthermore, we investigated the role of other basic residues located in TM2-3L of the β2 subunit (Arg269 and Lys279) and found that only the basic residue at position 274 is sensitive to a charge reversal mutation, suggesting that it is uniquely involved in electrostatic interactions important for receptor activation. This study also confirms the importance of TM2-3L of the GABAA-R β2 subunit in receptor activation, as previously reported for the α1, α2, β2, and β3 subunits (12Kash T.L. Jenkins A. Kelley J.C. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Nature. 2003; 421: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 14Sigel E. Buhr A. Baur R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1758-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 18O'Shea S.M. Harrison N.L. J. Biol.

An interesting difference between the α1 and β2 subunits was observed here because β2(L272A) failed to alter receptor function, whereas the α1 ortholog (L277A) reduces GABA sensitivity dramatically (EC50 = 278 μm) (26Topf N. Jenkins A. Baron N. Harrison N.L. Anesthesiology. 2003; 98: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Pre-TM1 Mutations—Of the three mutations in the pre-TM1 cluster of basic residues in the β2 subunit, only K215D had a significant effect on receptor function, producing a large decrease in GABA sensitivity. This mutation also reduced the relative efficacy of both taurine and P4S, suggesting that the major effect is a reduction in agonist efficacy. It is also worth noting that, although there are residues homologous to the pre-TM1 region in AChBP, they are not included in the structure because they are disordered (27Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). Our model (Fig. 5A) predicts that those residues should be in a β strand, as an α helix would be less than half as long and would not reach the top of TM1. Loop 2 and 7 Mutations—Three charge reversal mutations in loops 2 (D56K) and 7 (D139K and D146K) inhibited receptor function, apparently by reducing agonist efficacy. These data confirm an early report suggesting that mutations in loop 7 of the β2 subunit interfere with gating/coupling rather than with the GABA-binding site (28Amin J. Dickerson I.M. Weiss D.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 317-323PubMed Google Scholar). The role of these residues appears to be conserved across the receptor superfamily, as homologous mutations in the glycine receptor α1 subunit have similar effects on receptor function (29Schofield C.M. Jenkins A. Harrison N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34079-34083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We noted with interest that the E147K mutant had no effect on receptor function, whereas the neighboring residue Asp146 appeared to be critical for receptor function. This result appears less surprising upon inspection of a model of the β2 subunit. The molecular model provides a plausible explanation for this, as the Asp146 side chain appears to be positioned close to a group of positively charged residues, whereas the Glu147 side chain is located on a hydrophilic surface of the subunit, facing the extracellular space (Fig. 6B). Double Mutant Experiments Reveal Asp146-Lys215 Interactions—After establishing that the charged residues located in these domains appeared to be involved in receptor activation, we used a charge reversal double mutant approach to examine the interactions between these domains. This approach has been used successfully to identify intramolecular interactions in transmembrane (30Donahue P.J. Sainz E. Akeson M. Kroog G.S. Mantey S.A. Battey J.F. Jensen R.T. Northup J.K. Biochemistry. 1999; 28: 9366-9372Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and soluble (31Makhatadze G.I. Loladze V.V. Ermolenko D.N. Chen X. Thomas S.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 1135-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) proteins. Our results with the D146K,K215D double mutant strongly suggested that an interaction between these residues is critical for optimal receptor activation. Although we did observe small differences in function between the D146K,K215D mutant and the wild-type GABAA-R, this is not surprising, as the reversal of a charged pair may alter the energetics of the interaction (30Donahue P.J. Sainz E. Akeson M. Kroog G.S. Mantey S.A. Battey J.F. Jensen R.T. Northup J.K. Biochemistry. 1999; 28: 9366-9372Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and hence perturb the functional properties of the protein (31Makhatadze G.I. Loladze V.V. Ermolenko D.N. Chen X. Thomas S.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 1135-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). To determine the proximity of the domains investigated in this study, we performed engineered disulfide trapping experiments, the results of which indicate that loops 2 and 7 are located in close proximity to TM2-3L, independent of the presence of agonist. One potential explanation is that interactions between loops 2 and 7 and TM2-3L are involved in stabilizing the closed state of the receptor. By contrast, loops 2 and 7 appear to be located within close proximity of the pre-TM1 region only in the presence of GABA, suggesting that these domains move relative to one another during the open or desensitized state. It is of interest to note that a recent study that examined state-selective incorporation of hydrophobic probes in the nAChR identified loop 7 of the nAChR α1 subunit as a region that undergoes a conformational change during receptor activation (32Leite J.F. Blanton M.P. Shagholi M. Dougherty D.A. Lester H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13054-13059Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Based on these results, we propose that there are intramolecular interactions between loop 7 and the pre-TM1 region that are important for receptor activation. This idea is structurally reasonable based on our molecular model (Fig. 6A), which incorporates both the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the GABAA-R. We also note with interest the high degree of similarity between the molecular model we present here and the recently published structure of the nAChR (33Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 424: 949-955Crossref Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). Functional Asymmetry between α and β Subunits—An intriguing result was the failure of charge reversal double mutants in the β2 subunit between loops 2 and 7 and TM2-3L to restore receptor function. This finding contrasts with our previous data from studies of the α1 subunit, where we found evidence for coupling between orthologous residues in loops 2 and 7 (Asp57 and Asp149) and Lys279 in TM2-3L (12Kash T.L. Jenkins A. Kelley J.C. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Nature. 2003; 421: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). These differences in intradomain interactions between α and β subunits may reflect local dissimilarities in structure or an asymmetry in the propagation of conformational change within the individual subunits. A possible origin for such differences could be the asymmetric nature of the agonist-binding site itself, which is believed to constrict upon binding GABA (7Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 67-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The constriction of this cleft between adjacent subunit polypeptides implies that the adjacent domains of the α and β subunits are essentially pulled in opposite directions, thereby resulting in an asymmetric change in subunit structure. This would be consistent with reports of asymmetric motion within the extracellular domains of nAChR subunits following receptor activation (34Unwin N. Miyazawa A. Li J. Fujiyoshi Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1165-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Our latest results suggest that there may also be asymmetric conformational change in the extracellular domain following agonist binding in the GABAA-R and that, within the β subunit, the structural changes initiated upon agonist binding are coupled to the transmembrane domain via interactions between loop 7 and the pre-TM1 region."
https://openalex.org/W1996642042,"Capillary morphogenesis is a crucial angiogenic response of endothelial cells. Although fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) potently induces capillary morphogenesis, the contribution of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) in this response has not been clarified well. Here we examined the role of VEGF signaling in FGF-2-induced capillary morphogenesis by murine brain capillary endothelial cells (IBE cells) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. FGF-2-treated IBE cells rapidly extended on Matrigel in association with actin reorganization. Chimeric protein, of which the extracellular domain of VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) fused to immunoglobulin Fc, inhibited FGF-2-induced cell extension, resulting in decreased capillary morphogenesis. Blocking antibody against VEGFR-1 inhibited FGF-2-induced capillary formation. Also, anti-VEGF-A antibody inhibited FGF-2-induced capillary morphogenesis, which was restored by the addition of placental growth factor-1. Similar results were obtained by the experiments with human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Expression of kinase-inactive c-Akt in IBE cells showed impaired capillary morphogenesis promoted by FGF-2. Conversely, stable cell lines expressing activated c-Akt demonstrated ligand-independent capillaries, which were resistant to the treatment with anti-VEGFR-1 blocking antibody. Upstream of c-Akt, calmodulin-dependent signals seemed to be involved. Taken together, signals via VEGFR-1 were required for FGF-2-induced capillary morphogenesis by endothelial cells, and c-Akt activity seemed to be involved in this process. Capillary morphogenesis is a crucial angiogenic response of endothelial cells. Although fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) potently induces capillary morphogenesis, the contribution of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) in this response has not been clarified well. Here we examined the role of VEGF signaling in FGF-2-induced capillary morphogenesis by murine brain capillary endothelial cells (IBE cells) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. FGF-2-treated IBE cells rapidly extended on Matrigel in association with actin reorganization. Chimeric protein, of which the extracellular domain of VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) fused to immunoglobulin Fc, inhibited FGF-2-induced cell extension, resulting in decreased capillary morphogenesis. Blocking antibody against VEGFR-1 inhibited FGF-2-induced capillary formation. Also, anti-VEGF-A antibody inhibited FGF-2-induced capillary morphogenesis, which was restored by the addition of placental growth factor-1. Similar results were obtained by the experiments with human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Expression of kinase-inactive c-Akt in IBE cells showed impaired capillary morphogenesis promoted by FGF-2. Conversely, stable cell lines expressing activated c-Akt demonstrated ligand-independent capillaries, which were resistant to the treatment with anti-VEGFR-1 blocking antibody. Upstream of c-Akt, calmodulin-dependent signals seemed to be involved. Taken together, signals via VEGFR-1 were required for FGF-2-induced capillary morphogenesis by endothelial cells, and c-Akt activity seemed to be involved in this process. Angiogenesis is an important biological response in many pathophysiological conditions, such as embryonic development, collateral vessel formation following arterial occlusion, and solid tumor growth (1Folkman J.

A prototype VEGF, VEGF-A, transduces its signals through fms-like tyrosine kinase (Flt-1)/VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1) and kinase insert domain receptor (KDR)/fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk-1)/VEGFR-2 (4Dvorak H.F.

VEGF-A induces a variety of cellular responses of endothelial cells, such as proliferation, migration, capillary morphogenesis, secretion of proteases to digest basement membranes of vessels, survival, and vascular permeability. Many studies have shown that VEGF-A-mediated endothelial cell behaviors were largely regulated through VEGFR-2 (7Shibuya M. Ito N. Claesson-Welsh L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1999; 237: 59-83PubMed Google Scholar, 8Veikkola T. Karkkainen M. Claesson-Welsh L. Alitalo K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 203-212PubMed Google Scholar). By using receptor-specific blocking antibodies, however, it was shown that signals via VEGFR-1 were involved in actin reorganization and motility of endothelial cells (9Kanno S. Oda N. Abe M.

Signals via VEGFR-1 regulated nitric oxide release and subsequent capillary morphogenesis (10Bussolati B. Dunk C. Grohman M. Kontos C.D. Mason J. Ahmed A. Am. J.

Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) regulate a panel of cellular responses, such as bone remodeling, survival of neuronal cells, pulmonary development, and angiogenesis (11Ornitz D.M. Itoh N. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 3005.1-3005.12Crossref Google Scholar). Their signals are transduced via FGF receptor-1 (FGFR-1) to -4 (12Klint P. Claesson-Welsh L. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D165-D177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proangiogenic functions of prototype FGF, FGF-1 and -2, have been extensively studied, and a number of signaling molecules have been identified to act downstream of FGFR (13Javerzat S. Auguste P. Bikfalvi A. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 483-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 14Kanda S. Shono T. Kanetake H. Curr. Top. Biochemical Res. 2000; 2: 225-232Google Scholar). FGFR-1 is a major receptor expressed in endothelial cells, and its intracellular domain sufficiently transduces signals leading to tube formation (15Kanda S. Landgren E. Ljungstrom M. Claesson-Welsh L. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 383-395PubMed Google Scholar). FGFR-2 is also expressed at a lesser extent in endothelial cells. However, signals via the intracellular domain of FGFR-2 failed to induce tube formation (16Nakamura T. Mochizuki Y. Kanetake H. Kanda S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), suggesting that FGF-induced tube formation seems to require signals via FGFR-1. Recently, several studies have shown that VEGF signaling was required for FGF-2-induced cellular responses of endothelial cells. Angiogenic activity of FGF-2 was modulated by VEGF-A in an autocrine mechanism (17Seghezzi G. Patel S. Ren C.J. Gualandris A. Pintucci G. Robbins E.S. Shapiro R.L. Galloway A.C. Rifkin D.B. Mignatti P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1659-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Antagonizing VEGFR-2 inhibited both VEGF-A- and FGF-2-promoted angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo (18Tille J.C. Wood J. Mandriota S.J. Schnell C. Ferrari S. Mestan J. Zhu Z. Witte L. Pepper M.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 1073-1085PubMed Google Scholar). VEGF-C and -D transduce their signals via VEGFR-3 and -2, resulting in stimulation of lymphangiogenesis (19Jussila L. Alitalo K. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 673-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). FGF-2 also regulates cellular responses of endothelial cells of lymphatic vessels (20Pepper M. Wasi S. Ferrara N. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 210: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 21Pepper M.S. Mandriota S.J. Jeltsch M. Kumar V. Alitalo K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the blockade of VEGFR-3 signaling inhibited FGF-2-induced lymphangiogenesis (22Kubo H. Cao R. Brakenhielm E. Makinen T. Cao Y. Alitalo K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8868-8873Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that FGF-2-mediated proangiogenic responses require VEGF-mediated signaling. However, molecular mechanisms regarding how VEGF modifies FGF signaling have not been elucidated well. In the present study, we show that signals via VEGFR-1 were necessary but not sufficient for FGF-2-induced capillary morphogenesis by endothelial cells. Signals via VEGFR-1 regulated FGF-2-induced actin polymerization and cell extension possibly through c-Akt. Reagents and Antibodies—Mouse VEGF-A (164 amino acids), human VEGF-A (165 amino acids), human placenta growth factor-1 (PlGF-1), mouse Flt-1/Fc chimera, blocking antibodies against mouse VEGFR-1, mouse VEGFR-2, mouse VEGF-A, human VEGFR-1, human VEGFR-2, and human VEGF-A were obtained from R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN.

Anti-Myc monoclonal antibody-immobilized agarose was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA. Anti-phospho c-Akt (Ser at 473), anti-c-Akt, and anti-phosphorylated MAPK polyclonal antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA. Growth factor-reduced Matrigel matrix was purchased from BD Biosciences. Cell Culture—Murine brain capillary endothelial cells (denoted IBE cells) (15Kanda S. Landgren E. Ljungstrom M. Claesson-Welsh L. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 383-395PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen), 75 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (Sigma), 10 ng/ml human recombinant epidermal growth factor (Roche Applied Science), and 5 μg/ml bovine insulin (Sigma). HUVECs and their culture medium were obtained from BioWhittaker, Inc., Walkersville, MD. HUVECs were cultured in endothelial basal medium (EBM)-2 supplemented with 2% FBS, 20 ng/ml FGF-2, 20 ng/ml VEGF-A, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 20 ng/ml insulin-like growth factor-I, and 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone. Porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells expressing human VEGFR-2 (denoted KDR/PAE cells) (23Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were kind gifts from Dr. Carl-Henrik Heldin (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden) and were routinely cultivated in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% FBS and 200 μg/ml G418. Murine spleen endothelial cells (MSS31 cells; 24Yanai N. Satoh T. Obinata M. Cell Struct. Funct. 1991; 16: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) were kind gifts from Drs. M. Abe and Y. Sato (Department of Vascular Biology, Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan) and were cultured in α-modification of minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Transfection of cDNA Encoding Kinase-inactive or Activated Mutant of c-Akt into IBE Cells—cDNA encoding either histidine- and c-Myc-tagged kinase-inactive c-Akt or constitutively active c-Akt in pUSE plasmid was transfected into IBE cells by the use of TFL-6 liposome, which was a kind gift from Dr. Hiroshi Kikuchi (Daiichi Pharmaceuticals, Tokyo, Japan). Eighteen G418-resistant clones from each transfection were picked up and examined by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting. Capillary Morphogenesis Assay—Capillary morphogenesis assay was described elsewhere (25Kanda S. Suematsu T. Miyata Y. Mochizuki Y. Nomata K. Kanetake H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8244-8249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In brief, IBE cells were suspended in Ham's F-12 medium containing 0.25% BSA and seeded onto growth factor-reduced Matrigel® in wells of 24-well plates. Cells were treated or left untreated with the indicated samples. Twenty four hours later, capillary morphogenesis was examined under phase-contrast microscopic observation. For HUVECs, cells suspended in a culture medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum were inoculated onto growth factor-reduced Matrigel® with or without treatment and were cultured for 24 h. To quantify the length of capillaries, three different phase-contrast photomicrographs (×10 objectives) per well were taken, and the length of each capillary was measured using NIH image software (version 1.64). Capillary length was expressed as fold increase in that of unstimulated cells. Determination of Actin Reorganization—Actin reorganization was examined as described before (26Nakamura T. Kanda S. Kohno T. Yamamoto K. Maeda K. Matsuyama T. Kanetake H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7610-7623Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) with minor modification. Cells were cultured on coverslips pre-coated with Matrigel in the presence or absence of indicated samples. After 6 h, cells were washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl (TBS), followed by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in TBS for 3 min, washed with TBS, and incubated with TRITC-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) for 20 min. After washing and mounting, photographs were taken under fluorescence microscopy. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—To examine the expression of ectopically introduced c-Akt, cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (27Kanda S. Lerner E.C. Tsuda S. Shono T. Kanetake H. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10105-10111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and c-Akt was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody-immobilized agarose, and immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. After electronic transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), the blots were probed with anti-Akt antibodies. To examine the phosphorylation status of c-Akt, IBE cells were suspended in Ham's F-12 medium containing 0.25% BSA and seeded onto growth factor-reduced Matrigel with or without the indicated reagents. After 2 h, cells were lysed, and c-Akt was immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Akt antibody. To examine the tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-2, KDR/PAE cells were serum-starved for 2 h and then either stimulated or left unstimulated with the indicated ligands for 8 min. For the study of the blocking ability of anti-receptor antibodies, cells were treated with the indicated antibodies for 2 h and then stimulated with ligand. To assess blocking ability of anti-VEGF-A antibodies, VEGF-A was preincubated with either the antibodies or normal goat IgG for 30 min at 37 °C and then added to the cells. To determine the activation of MAPK, MSS31 cells grown in wells of 24-well plates were incubated with medium containing 0.5% FBS for 16 h. The medium was changed to the fresh one and treated with antibody or normal goat IgG for 2 h. Cells were stimulated or left unstimulated with the indicated ligand for 8 min and lysed in boiled SDS sample buffer. Total cell proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and activation of MAPK was examined by immunoblotting using phosphospecific antibody. In Vitro Kinase Assay for VEGFR-1—The method was described previously (15Kanda S. Landgren E. Ljungstrom M. Claesson-Welsh L. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 383-395PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, IBE cells grown on 15-cm dishes were serum- and growth factor-starved for 16 h. Culture medium was changed to fresh Ham's F-12 medium containing 0.25% BSA and the indicated antibody. After 2 h, cells were either stimulated or left unstimulated with VEGF-A for 8 min and lysed. Mouse VEGFR-1 was immunoprecipitated, washed, and incubated with [γ-32P]ATP, followed by SDS-PAGE. Gels were fixed and treated with 1 m KOH to remove phosphorylated serine. Gels were dried and examined by Image Analyzer BAS 5000 (Fuji), followed by exposure on x-ray films (Amersham Biosciences). For HUVECs, cells grown in 10-cm dishes were serum-starved for 2 h in the presence or absence of anti-VEGFR-1 antibody. Cells were either stimulated or left unstimulated with VEGF-A for 8 min, and in vitro kinase assay was performed as described above. FGF-2-induced Capillary Morphogenesis of Murine Brain Capillary Endothelial Cells Is Blocked by the Inhibition of Signals via VEGFR-1—Capillary morphogenesis is composed of a series of cellular responses such as cell motility, changes of cell shape, and cell-cell contact. FGF-2 and VEGF-A are potent stimulators for capillary morphogenesis of endothelial cells in culture. To examine whether VEGF-A-mediated signaling affects FGF-2-driven capillary morphogenesis, we first determined the abilities of each reagent that may block mouse and human VEGF signaling. First, we used KDR/PAE cells to assess anti-mouse VEGF-A blocking antibody. As shown in Fig. 1A, mouse VEGF-A potently induced autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2 in KDR/PAE cells. Pretreatment of mouse VEGF-A with anti-mouse VEGF-A antibody, but not control goat IgG, abolished tyrosine autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2, suggesting that the antibody could efficiently block activity of mouse VEGF-A. IBE cells endogenously express VEGFR-1 (15Kanda S. Landgren E. Ljungstrom M. Claesson-Welsh L. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 383-395PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse VEGFR-1 was immunoprecipitated from the lysates of VEGF-A-treated IBE cells in the presence of either control goat IgG or anti-mouse VEGFR-1, and in vitro kinase assay was performed. As shown in Fig. 1B, VEGF-A-induced autophosphorylation of mouse VEGFR-1 in IBE cells was inhibited dose-dependently by anti-mouse VEGFR-1 antibody. IBE cells do not express particular amounts of VEGFR-2. Therefore, mouse spleen endothelial cells (MSS31 cells), which express both VEGFR-1 and -2 (28Namba K. Abe M. Saito S. Satake M. Ohmoto T. Watanabe T. Sato Y. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 106-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), were used to examine anti-mouse VEGFR-2 antibody. MSS31 cells in the presence or absence of the indicated IgG were either stimulated or left unstimulated with VEGFR-1-specific ligand, PlGF-1, or VEGF-A and total cell extracts were examined to detect activated MAPK. As shown in Fig. 1C, VEGF-A, but not PlGF-1, induced MAPK activation, suggesting that VEGF-A activated MAPK through VEGFR-2 in MSS31 cells. Treatment of cells with anti-mouse VEGFR-2 antibody, but not control goat IgG, inhibited VEGF-A-induced MAPK activation in MSS31 cells. We next examined whether blocking antibody against human VEGF-A or chimeric protein, of which extracellular domain of VEGFR-1 was fused to immunoglobulin Fc (Flt-1/Fc chimera), could inhibit human VEGF-A activity. As shown in Fig. 1D, human VEGF-A induced autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2 in PAE cells. Pretreatment of human VEGF-A with anti-human VEGF-A or Flt-1/Fc chimera inhibited human VEGF-A-induced autophosphorylation. To assess the blocking ability of anti-human VEGFR-1, VEGF-A-induced autophosphorylation of VEGFR-1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was examined. HUVECs were preincubated with either control goat IgG or anti-human VEGFR-1 antibody, and cells were stimulated with VEGF-A. Human VEGFR-1 was immunoprecipitated from the lysates of these cells, and in vitro kinase assay was performed. As shown in Fig. 1E, autophosphorylation of VEGFR-1 was dose-dependently decreased by the treatment with anti-human VEGFR-1 antibody. Finally, we examined the effect of anti-human VEGFR-2 antibody on VEGF-A-induced autophosphorylation of human VEGFR-2 in KDR/PAE cells. As shown in Fig. 1F, autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2 was decreased by the treatment of cells with anti-human VEGFR-2 antibody. Taken together, these antagonists to mouse and human VEGF-A, VEGFR-1, and VEGFR-2 were able to inhibit VEGF-A-mediated signaling in mouse and human endothelial cells. Because we were unable to confirm the blocking ability of anti-VEGF-A and VEGF receptor antibodies against porcine VEGF-A or VEGF receptors, and MSS31 cells failed to demonstrate capillary morphogenesis on Matrigel, IBE cells and HUVECs were used throughout the following biological and biochemical studies. FGF-2 promotes capillary morphogenesis of IBE cells, when cultured on Matrigel matrix (25Kanda S. Suematsu T. Miyata Y. Mochizuki Y. Nomata K. Kanetake H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8244-8249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Cells extended and contacted with each other, resulting in network formation. Kinetic study revealed that IBE cells rapidly spread and crawled on the surface of Matrigel matrix when treated with FGF-2 (Fig. 2B). At 6 h after seeding, spread cells touched each other and began to form slit-like structures between elongated cells. In the absence of FGF-2, most cells stayed in a round-shape and failed to fuse by themselves. These observations suggest that FGF-2 regulated cell shape and cell-cell contact. We also examined the filamentous actin of IBE cells 6 h after seeding. As shown in Fig. 2C, FGF-2 induced actin polymerization, and lamellipodium was also observed on the edge of extended cells (arrowhead in Fig. 2C). The result suggests that FGF-2-induced extension of IBE cells involved actin reorganization. We next examined the role of VEGF signaling in FGF-2-induced capillary morphogenesis of IBE cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, Flt-1/Fc chimera potently inhibited FGF-2-induced capillary morphogenesis. Cell aggregation was observed in the presence of Flt-1/Fc chimera. However, cell extension was markedly attenuated. Polymerized actin and lamellipodium were hardly observed in cells treated with Flt-1/Fc chimera (Fig. 3B), suggesting that actin reorganization was affected. VEGF-A failed to induce capillary morphogenesis of IBE cells, possibly due to the extremely low amount of VEGFR-2 protein (15Kanda S. Landgren E. Ljungstrom M. Claesson-Welsh L. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 383-395PubMed Google Scholar). VEGF-A-mediated signaling leading to capillary morphogenesis is transduced via VEGFR-2 (29Koolwijk P. Peters E. van der Vecht B. Hornig C.

Commun. 2003; 306: 1056-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Expression of VEGFR-2 protein to a certain degree may be required for VEGF-A-induced capillary morphogenesis of endothelial cells. We also examined the effect of Flt-1/Fc chimera on FGF-2-induced proliferation and migration of IBE cells. However, Flt-1/Fc chimera neither affected the proliferation nor the migration of IBE cells induced by FGF-2 treatment. 2S. Kanda, Y. Miyata, and H. Kanetake, unpublished data. Whereas Flt-1/Fc chimera inhibits signaling through both VEGFR-1 and -2, we examined the effect of blocking antibodies against mouse VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-2 on FGF-2-induced capillary morphogenesis. As shown in Fig. 3C, antibody against VEGFR-1, but not VEGFR-2, efficiently inhibited FGF-2-induced capillary morphogenesis by suppressing cellular extension. We further examined the role of VEGFR-1-mediated signaling in FGF-2-induced capillary morphogenesis by using VEGFR-1-specific ligand, PlGF-1. PlGF-1, but not -2, was used because effects of neuropillin 1 and/or heparan sulfate proteoglycan could be ignored (33Hauser S. Weich H.A. Growth Factors. 1993; 9: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 34Mamluk R. Gechtman Z. Kutcher M.E. Gasiunas N. Gallagher J. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24818-24825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3D, PlGF-1 alone failed to induce capillary morphogenesis of IBE cells, suggesting that signals via VEGFR-1 were not sufficient to induce capillary morphogenesis. Also, PlGF-1 showed no additive effect on FGF-2-induced capillary morphogenesis. Blocking antibody against mouse VEGF-A inhibited FGF-2-induced capillary morphogenesis. IBE cells secrete VEGF-A, which was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R & D Systems), and FGF-2 did not increase its secretion. 2S. Kanda, Y. Miyata, and H. Kanetake, unpublished data. It is therefore possible that anti-VEGF-A antibody inhibited constantly secreted, endogenous VEGF-A activity. PlGF-1 restored anti-VEGF-A-inhibited capillary morphogenesis. Thus, signals via VEGFR-1 were required in FGF-2-induced capillary morphogenesis. Signals via VEGFR-1 Are Required for FGF-2-induced Capillary Morphogenesis by HUVECs—Because IBE cells did not express particular amounts of VEGFR-2 protein, the results demonstrated above may be specific for endothelial cells lacking expression of VEGFR-2 protein. We therefore examined the effect of Flt-1/Fc chimera on FGF-2-induced capillary morphogenesis of HUVECs. HUVECs used in the present study expressed both functional VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 proteins, which were assessed by immune complex kinase assay.2 As shown in Fig. 4A, FGF-2 and VEGF-A induced capillary morphogenesis of HUVECs. Flt-1/Fc chimera inhibited FGF-2-induced capillary morphogenesis of HUVECs. Blocking antibody against VEGFR-1, but not VEGFR-2, markedly inhibited FGF-2-induced capillary morphogenesis. VEGF-A-induced capillary morphogenesis was inhibited by anti-VEGFR-2 antibody but not anti-VEGFR-1 antibody (Fig. 4B), as shown previously (29Koolwijk P. Peters E. van der Vecht B. Hornig C.

FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1316-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These results indicate that even in the presence of functional VEGFR-2, signals via VEGFR-1 would be required for FGF-2-induced capillary morphogenesis. We also examined the effect of anti-human VEGF-A antibody on FGF-2-induced capillary morphogenesis. Anti-human VEGF-A blocking antibody inhibited FGF-2-mediated capillary morphogenesis, and again, PlGF-1 restored the inhibition of FGF-2-induced capillary morphogenesis by anti-human VEGF-A antibody (Fig. 4C), suggesting that FGF-2-induced capillary morphogenesis of HUVECs required signals via VEGFR-1. c-Akt Seems to Be Involved in VEGFR-1-mediated Signaling Required for FGF-2-induced Capillary Morphogenesis—We have shown previously (25Kanda S. Suematsu T. Miyata Y. Mochizuki Y. Nomata K. Kanetake H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8244-8249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) that FGF-2-induced capillary morphogenesis of IBE cells and HUVECs was not attenuated by a specific inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase/Erk kinase PD98059. In addition, an inhibitor of phospholipase C-γ, U-73122, also failed to block FGF-2-induced capillary morphogenesis. 3S. Kanda, unpublished observations. VEGFR-1 is able to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase and phospholipase C-γ (35Seetharam L. Gotoh N. Maru Y. Neufeld G. Yamaguchi S. Shibuya M.

These observations suggest that VEGFR-1-mediated activation of these signaling molecules do not seem to be involved in the blockade of FGF-2-induced capillary morphogenesis. Recently, it has been shown that c-Akt was involved in capillary morphogenesis of endothelial cells (37Kureishi Y. Luo Z. Shiojima I. Bialik A. Fulton D. Lefer D.J. Sessa W.C. Walsh K. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1004-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar, 38Lee M.J. Thangada S. Paik J.H. Sapkota G.P. Ancellin N. Chae S.S. Wu M. Morales-Ruiz M. Sessa W.C. Alessi D.R. Hla T. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 693-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). We examined the kinetics of c-Akt activity in IBE cells by phospho-specific antibody during culture on Matrigel. However, phosphorylation of c-Akt was not altered in IBE cells by culture period or FGF-2 treatment (data not shown). This result may be explained by the chronic stimulation of c-Akt by endogenous VEGF-A. To test the possibility whether c-Akt is involved in FGF-2-induced capillary morphogenesis, we generated stable IBE cell lines expressing kinase-inactive c-Akt. As shown in Fig. 5A, clones 9 and 17 expressed kinase-inactive c-Akt (denoted KDAkt-9 and -17 cells, respectively). To examine the c-Akt activity in these cells, phosphorylation of c-Akt in cells cultured on Matrigel with FGF-2 for 4 h was examined. Although the total amount of c-Akt was higher in KDAkt-9 and -17 cells than in Mock cells, relative phosphorylation of serine residue at 473 was lower in KDAkt cells (Fig. 5B). Also, epidermal growth factor failed to increase phosphorylation of c-Akt in KDAkt cells, but not Mock cells. 3S. Kanda, unpublished observations. By using these cell lines, we examined the effect of FGF-2 on capillary morphogenesis. As shown in Fig. 5C, both KDAkt-9 and -17 cells failed to form capillary morphogenesis induced by FGF-2 treatment. Some cells formed aggregates, but cellular extension was significantly attenuated in these cells. We next examined the capillary morphogenesis in stable IBE cell lines expressing activated c-Akt. As shown in Fig. 5D, clone 13 and 14 expressed activated c-Akt (denoted CAAkt-13 and -14 cells, respectively). Compared with empty vector-transfected cells (Mock), both cell lines exhibited FGF-2-independent capillary morphogenesis (Fig. 5E). Treatment of cells with blocking antibody against VRGFR-1 only weakly, but not significantly, inhibited FGF-2-induced capillary morphogenesis. These results suggest that c-Akt activity seems to be involved in FGF-2-induced capillary morphogenesis. Regulation of kinase activity of c-Akt is largely dependent on the lipid products of PI 3-kinase (39Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 40Brazil D.P. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 657-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). However, we have shown previously (25Kanda S. Suematsu T. Miyata Y. Mochizuki Y. Nomata K. Kanetake H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8244-8249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) that PI 3-kinase inhibitors failed to inhibit FGF-2-induced capillary morphogenesis by IBE cells and HUVECs. In addition, PI 3-kinase activity was not elevated in cell treated with FGF-2 during culture, and Flt-1/Fc chimera did not decrease its activity, suggesting that activation of PI 3-kinase did not seem to be involved in the regulation of c-Akt. Another mechanism used to activate c-Akt is Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (41Yano S. Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. Nature. 1998; 396: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we used calmodulin antagonists, W13 and calmidazolium chloride, in capillary morphogenesis assay. As shown in Fig. 6A, both W13 and calmidazolium chloride dose-dependently inhibited FGF-2-induced capillary morphogenesis of IBE cells. Phosphorylation of c-Akt was inhibited in IBE cells treated with calmidazolium chloride as well as anti-mouse VEGFR-1 antibody (Fig. 6B). Thus, it seems likely that c-Akt activity is responsible for FGF-2-induced capillary morphogenesis by endothelial cells, possibly regulated through VEGFR-1 in a calmodulin-dependent manner. Assays for differentiation of endothelial cells, such as capillary morphogenesis, tube formation, and in vitro angiogenesis assay (42Auerbach R. Auerbach W. Polakowski I. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 51: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 43Montesano R. Eur. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 22: 504-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 44Vailhe B. Vittet D. Feige J.J.

Res. 2002; 91: 877-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), are composed of a series of cellular responses. Cell-cell contact, cell-matrix interaction, cell motility, cell proliferation, and protease production may be involved. Among them, cell-cell contact and cell-matrix interaction are essential components in all kinds of assays. In the present study, we show here that FGF-2-induced extended morphology of endothelial cells, which was preferentially involved in flattened morphology of endothelial cells of angiogenic microvessels in vivo (46Paku S. Paweletz N. Lab. Investig. 1991; 65: 334-346PubMed Google Scholar), required signals via VEGFR-1. Blocking antibody against VEGFR-1 as well as VEGF-A inhibited extension of IBE cells and HUVECs cultured on Matrigel. Addition of PlGF-1 to these cells restored anti-VEGF-A-mediated inhibition of cell extension, suggesting that signaling through VEGFR-1 by endogenous VEGF-A was required for FGF-2-mediated changes of cell shape. Inhibition of cell extension by blocking of VEGFR-1-mediated signaling was not observed in cells expressing constitutively active c-Akt, suggesting that c-Akt activity regulated through VEGFR-1 seemed to be required for FGF-2-mediated morphological change of endothelial cells. Downstream molecule of c-Akt might be Rac, because Rac was regulated by c-Akt (38Lee M.J. Thangada S. Paik J.H. Sapkota G.P. Ancellin N. Chae S.S. Wu M. Morales-Ruiz M. Sessa W.C. Alessi D.R. Hla T. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 693-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and was involved in the regulation of endothelial cell morphology (47Connolly J.O. Simpson N. Hewlett L. Hall A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2474-2485Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). A recent study (48Autiero M. Waltenberger J. Communi D. Kranz A. Moons L. Lambrechts D. Kroll J. Plaisance S. De Mol M. Bono F. Kliche S. Fellbrich G. Ballmer-Hofer K. Maglione D. Mayr-Beyrle U. Dewerchin M. Dombrowski S. Stanimirovic D. Van Hummelen P. Dehio C. Hicklin D.J. Persico G. Herbert J.M. Communi D. Shibuya M. Collen D. Conway E.M. Carmeliet P. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 936-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) has shown that PlGF phosphorylated different tyrosine residues in VEGFR-1 from that of VEGF-A, resulting in the enhancement of VEGF-A-mediated activation of VEGFR-2. VEGF-A can also promote heterodimerization of two different VEGFRs, VEGFR-1 and -2. These ideas raise the possibility that signals via VEGFR-2 may also participate in FGF-2-induced capillary morphogenesis. PlGF induces migration and proliferation of endothelial cells (36Landgren E. Schiller P. Cao Y. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 49Ziche M. Maglione D. Ribatti D. Morbidelli L. Lago C.T. Battisti M. Paoletti I. Barra A. Tucci M. Parise G. Vincenti V. Granger H.J. Viglietto G. Persico M.G. Lab. Investig. 1997; 76: 517-531PubMed Google Scholar). These responses may be modulated by endogenous VEGF-A. However, blocking antibody against VEGFR-2 never inhibited FGF-2-induced capillary morphogenesis; nevertheless, it could inhibit VEGF-A-promoted capillary morphogenesis as well as autophosphorylation of VEGFR-2 or MAPK activation. Although VEGF-A induced capillary morphogenesis of HUVECs, PlGF-1 itself failed to induce this response, suggesting that PlGF-mediated VEGFR-2 activation is not sufficient to induce capillary morphogenesis of endothelial cells. In this study, PlGF restored anti-VEGF-A antibody-mediated inhibition of capillary morphogenesis. PlGF induced activation of VEGFR-2 in coordination with VEGF-A. Thus, it seems likely that signals via VEGFR-1 are solely involved in FGF-2-induced capillary morphogenesis of endothelial cells. In the present study, we showed that c-Akt activity was required for subsequent capillary morphogenesis induced by FGF-2. FGF-2 did not up-regulate VEGF-A secretion in IBE cells. In parallel, phosphorylation of c-Akt in IBE cells was not altered during culture in the presence or absence of FGF-2. However, anti-VEGFR-1 antibody down-regulated the phosphorylation of c-Akt (Fig. 6B), suggesting that VEGFR-1 actually contributed to maintain c-Akt activity at a certain level. Thus, it seems likely that in the presence of c-Akt activity, additional signaling pathways via FGF receptor, such as c-Fyn (50Tsuda S. Ohtsuru A. Yamashita S. Kanetake H. Kanda S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 1354-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), may coordinately regulate actin-based capillary morphogenesis of endothelial cells. It has also been shown that VEGFR-1-regulated nitric oxide production was involved in capillary morphogenesis of endothelial cells (10Bussolati B. Dunk C. Grohman M. Kontos C.D. Mason J. Ahmed A. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 993-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). c-Akt phosphorylates endothelial nitric-oxide synthase, thereby activating its activity (51Chen Z.P. Mitchelhill K.I. Michell B.J. Stapleton D. Rodriguez-Crespo I. Witters L.A. Power D.A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Kemp B.E.

Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3056) Google Scholar). However, FGF-2-induced capillary morphogenesis was not blocked by the treatment of cells with the nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor, NG-monomethyl-l-arginine. 4S. Kanda, unpublished observations. The result suggests that the nitric oxide-dependent mechanism does not seem to be involved in FGF-2-induced morphological changes of endothelial cells. In conclusion, the present study adds a novel function of VEGFR-1 in angiogenesis. Signals through VEGFR-1 may also be a potent target of anti-angiogenic therapy. Blockade of signaling through both VEGFR-1 and -2 may be more efficient to inhibit angiogenesis in vivo than blocking signals solely through VEGFR-2. We appreciate Drs. Carl-Henrik Heldin, Yasufumi Sato, and Mayumi Abe for their generous gifts of PAE cells expressing human VEGFR-2 and MSS31 cells, respectively. We are also grateful to T. Shimogama, M. Yoshimoto, and members of Nagasaki University Radioisotope Center for their excellent help."

They exert their actions through a specific high affinity binding site on the major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor, the γ-aminobutyric acid, type A (GABAA) receptor channel, where they act as positive allosteric modulators. To start to elucidate the relative positioning of benzodiazepine binding site ligands in their binding pocket, GABAA receptor residues thought to reside in the site were individually mutated to cysteine and combined with benzodiazepine analogs carrying substituents reactive to cysteine. Direct apposition of such reactive partners is expected to lead to an irreversible site-directed reaction.

This interaction was studied at the level of radioactive ligand binding and at the functional level using electrophysiological methods. Covalent reaction occurs concomitantly with occupancy of the binding pocket. It stabilizes the receptor in its allosterically stimulated conformation. Covalent modification is not observed in wild type receptors or when using mutated α1H101C-containing receptors in combination with the reactive ligand pre-reacted with a sulfhydryl group, and the modification rate is reduced by the binding site ligand Ro15-1788.

They are heteromeric protein complexes consisting of five subunits, which are arranged pseudo-symmetrically around a central Cl–-selective ion channel (1Macdonald R.L. Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev.

Pharmacol. Rev. 1995; 47: 181-233Google Scholar), including compounds acting at the benzodiazepine binding site. Benzodiazepines belong to the classic ligands of this site and exert their anxiolytic, sedative, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsive action by positive allosteric modulation of different isoforms of the GABAA receptor channel. An antagonist acting at this site is also in clinical use (22Hunkeler W. Mohler H. Pieri L. Polc P. Bonetti E.P. Cumin R. Schaffner R. Haefely W.

The abovementioned residues lining either the benzodiazepine binding site or the GABA binding site are all homologous to residues suggested to form the binding site of acetylcholine on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (43Galzi J.-L.

Perez J.J. Loew G.H. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1994; 2: 1029-1049Google Scholar) have been undertaken with the aim to characterize spatial properties of the benzodiazepine binding pocket. These studies used either in vivo effects or chloride flux experiments in combination with radioligand binding studies on brain membranes of a large number of structurally related compounds. Derived models for the binding pocket are complex and suggest distinct but partially overlapping binding sites for ligands differing in their allosteric effect, but a consensus view failed to emerge. A drawback of brain studies is the heterogeneity of GABAA receptors.It is obviously important to map all the amino acid residues participating in the formation of the benzodiazepine pocket relative to the ligands of this site in a recombinant receptor. Initial approaches have indicated that the pending phenyl residue of classic benzodiazepines may be located close to γ2Phe-77 (50Sigel E. Schaerer M.T. Buhr A. Baur R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 1097-1105Google Scholar) and α1His-101 (51McKernan R.M. Farrar S. Collins I. Emms F. Asuni A. Quirk K. Broughton H. Mol.

Recently, a novel technique to elucidate relative position of a ligand in its binding pocket has been successfully applied in several cases (53Perret P. Sarda X. Wolff M. Wu T.T. Bushey D. Goeldner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25350-25354Google Scholar, 54Kreimeyer A. Laube B. Sturgess M. Goeldner M. Foucaud B. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 4394-4404Google Scholar, 55Allman K. Page K.M.

Balestre M.N. Klotz P. Rognan D. Barberis C. Mouillac B. Hibert M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40010-40019Google Scholar). The technique has been described in detail (60Foucaud B. Perret P. Grutter T. Goeldner M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 170-173Google Scholar). In this approach, receptors in which residues thought to reside in the binding pocket are individually mutated to cysteine and then combined with binding site ligands carrying substituents reactive to cysteine. Direct apposition of such reactive substituents with a cysteine residue is expected to lead to a covalent reaction. Given a series of controls, such engineered site-directed reactions provide reliable information on the orientation of a ligand within its binding site.We applied here this novel approach to the benzodiazepine binding site. We show that this strategy works in the present case and describe the covalent interaction of α1H101C with a reactive group attached to the C-atom in diazepam normally carrying a Cl atom. We show in addition that γ2Ala-79 is most probably located in the access pathway of the ligand to its binding pocket.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSynthesis of the Reactive Substance7-Isothiocyanato-5-phenyl-1,3-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one— Thiophosgen (63 μl, 0.828 mmol, 2 eq.) was slowly added to a stirred solution of 7-amino-5-phenyl-1,3-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one(110 mg, 0.414 mmol) and sodium hydrogenocarbonate (70 mg, 0.828 mmol, 2 eq.) in 10 ml of an aqueous solution of tetrahydrofuran (50%). The resulting mixture was stirred 15 min at room temperature. 40 ml of 5% aqueous solution of NaHCO3 was added to the reaction mixture, and after evaporation of the tetrahydrofuran, the aqueous layer was extracted with CH2Cl2. the organic layer was washed with 5% aqueous solution of NaHCO3, dried over Na2SO4, and evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by chromatography on silica gel eluted by heptane/ethyl acetate 1/1. NMR 1H (300 MHz-CDCl3): δ = 3.41 (s, 3H), 3.75 (d, J = 10.8 Hz, 1H), 4.83 (d, J = 10.8 Hz, 1H), 7.14 (d, J = 2.4 Hz, 1H), 7.26–7.60 (m, 7H). IR (KBr): σ = 2104 cm–1, s (–NCS).7-Nitro-5-phenyl-3-chloro-1,3-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one— N-Chlorosuccinimide (2.5 g, 187 mmol, 55 eq.) in portions of 500 mg was added over 2 days to a solution of nitrazepam (1 g, 3.39 mmol) in CCl4. A catalytic amount of azoisobutyro nitrile was added, and the solution was heated to reflux (2 days). The solvent was removed under reduced pressure, and the residue was dissolved in Et2O. The solid N-chlorosuccinimide in excess was removed by filtration, and the Et2O was evaporated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by chromatography on silica gel eluted by heptane/AcOEt 7/3, giving 22% of the desired Cl compound. NMR 1H (200 MHz-CDCl3): δ = 3.57 (s, 3H), 5.63 (s, 1H), 6.70 (s, 1H), 7.35–8.51 (m, 8H).Construction of Receptor SubunitsThe cDNAs coding for the α1, β2, and γ2S subunits of the rat GABAA receptor channel have been described elsewhere (61Lolait S.J. O'Carroll A.-M. Kusano K. Muller J.-M. Brownstein M.J. Mahan L.C. FEBS Lett. 1989; 246: 145-148Google Scholar, 62Malherbe P. Draguhn A. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Möhler H. Mol. Brain Res. 1990; 8: 199-208Google Scholar, 63Malherbe P. Sigel E. Baur R. Persohn E. Richards J.G. Möhler H. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 2330-2337Google Scholar). The mutant subunits α1H101C, γ2T73C, γ2D75C, γ2A79C, and γ2T81C were prepared using the QuikChange™ mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For cell transfection, the cDNAs were subcloned into the polylinker of pBC/CMV (64Bertocci B. Miggiano V. Da Prada M. Dembic Z. Lahm H.-W. Malherbe P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1416-1420Google Scholar). This expression vector allows high level expression of a foreign gene under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The α subunit was cloned into the EcoRI, and the β and γ subunits were subcloned into the SmaI site of the polylinker by standard techniques.Transfection of Recombinant GABAA Receptor in Cultured CellsThe cells were maintained in minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin by standard cell culture techniques. Equal amounts (total of 20 μg of DNA/90-mm dish) of plasmids coding for GABAA receptor subunits were transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells (ATCC CRL 1573) by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (65Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar). After overnight incubation, the cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and refed with medium.Membrane PreparationApproximately 60 h after transfection the cells were harvested by washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 560 × g. The buffer containined 10 mm potassium phosphate, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm K-EDTA, pH 7.4. Cells were homogenized by sonication in the presence of 10 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm EDTA. Membranes were collected by three centrifugation-resuspension cycles (100,000 × g for 20 min) and then used for ligand binding or stored at –20 °C.Binding AssaysMembranes were resuspended in the buffer mentioned above using a tip sonifier. Resupended cell membranes were incubated in a total volume of 0.1–0.4 ml for 90 min on ice in the presence of [3H]Ro15-1788 (78.6 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or [3H]flunitrazepam (71–84 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and various concentrations of competing ligands. In the case of displacement studies using NCS compound this compound was present for 20–30 min. Membranes (5–80 μg of protein/filter) were collected by rapid filtration on GF/C filters presoaked in 0.3% polyethylenimine. After three washing steps with 5 ml of buffer, the filter-retained radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 100 μm Ro15-1788 or 100 μm flunitrazepam, respectively. Data were fitted by using a nonlinear least-squares method to the equations, B(c) = Bmax/(1 + (Kd/c)n), for binding curves, and B(c) = Bmax/(1 + (c/IC50)n), for displacement curves with a single component, where c is the concentration of ligand, B is binding, Bmax is maximal binding, Kd is the dissociation constant, and n is the Hill coefficient. IC50 values were converted to Ki values according to the Cheng-Prusoff equation (66Cheng Y.C. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard.Wash-out Procedure for Reactive SubstancesNCS compound was dissolved in dioxane at a concentration of 20 mm. A stock solution was kept at –20 °C and used at most for 2 months. Cl compound was freshly dissolved in Me2SO at a concentration of 5 mm. Final dilutions were prepared immediately before the experiment. We estimated that ∼25% of the NCS compound was reacted in buffer alone within 1 h. Membranes were incubated with different NCS compound in total volume of 0.2 ml for 30–60 min on ice. Maximal final solvent concentration during this incubation was 1%. Subsequently, 1.8 ml of ice-cold buffer were added and the sample was centrifuged at 14,000 × gmax at 2 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was removed, and 2 ml of ice-cold buffer was added to the pellet, followed by sonication. Centrifugation was performed again, and the whole procedure repeated. After the third centrifugation the supernatant was removed leaving ∼50 μl in the tube, and 0.31 ml of ice-cold buffer was added. After sonication a binding assay was performed in a total volume of 0.4 ml. During this procedure 30–70% of the protein was lost. Controls containing no reactive substance allowed standardization in each experiment and were set to 100% binding. In some cases, NCS compound was reacted with free cysteine to inactivate it. For this purpose 100 μm of NCS compound was preincubated for 1 h together with 100 mm cysteine.Expression in Xenopus OocytesCapped cRNAs were synthesized (Ambion, Austin, TX) from the linearized pCMV vectors containing the different subunits, respectively. A poly-A tail of about 400 residues was added to each transcript using yeast poly-A polymerase (United States Biologicals, Cleveland, OH). The concentration of the cRNA was quantified on a formaldehyde gel using Radiant Red stain (Bio-Rad) for visualization of the RNA and known concentrations of RNA ladder (Invitrogen) as standard on the same gel. cRNA combinations were precipitated in ethanol/isoamylalcohol 19:1 and stored at –20 °C. For injection, the alcohol was removed and the cRNAs were dissolved in water. Oocytes were injected with 50 nl of the cRNA solution. The combination of wild type or mutated α1, β2, and γ2 subunits was expressed at 10 nm:10 nm:50 nm (67Boileau A.J. Baur R. Sharkey L.M. Sigel E. Czajkowski C. Neuropharmacology. 2002; 43: 695-700Google Scholar). The injected oocytes were incubated in modified Barth's solution (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 0.34 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at 18 °C for at least 24 h before the measurements. Xenopus laevis oocytes were prepared, injected, and defoliculated as described previously (14Sigel E. Baur R. Trube G. Möhler H. Malherbe P. Neuron. 1990; 5: 703-711Google Scholar, 68Sigel E. J. Physiol. 1987; 386: 73-90Google Scholar).Two-electrode Voltage ClampElectrophysiological experiments were performed by the two-electrode voltage clamp method at a holding potential of –80 mV. The perfusion medium contained 90 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.4). To quantify GABA sensitivity, agonist concentrations between 0.1 and 10,000 μm were applied for 20 s and a wash-out period of 4–20 min was allowed to ensure full recovery from desensitization. Current responses were fitted to the Hill equation: I = Imax/(1 + (EC50/A)n), where I is the current amplitude at a given concentration of GABA (A), Imax is the maximum current amplitude, EC50 is the concentration of agonist eliciting half maximal current amplitudes, and n is the Hill coefficient. Allosteric potentiation via the benzodiazepine site and covalent reaction were measured at a GABA concentration eliciting 8–12% of the maximal GABA current amplitude by coapplication of GABA and the drugs acting at the benzodiazepine binding site. Unless mentioned otherwise, oocytes were only exposed to a single drug in addition to GABA, to avoid contamination, and the perfusion system was cleaned by washing with Me2SO for the same reason.Receptor Modification by NCS CompoundModification by NCS compound was measured as follows. GABA was applied several times until a reproducible response was obtained. Oocytes were then superperfused during 1 min with NCS compound freshly diluted to 20 μm in perfusion medium. Maximal final dioxane concentration was 0.1%. This concentration of dioxane did not affect the response to GABA in control experiments. Treatment was followed by several GABA applications in intervals of 4 min to reach a steady level. The irreversible stimulation was then calculated as Stimulation = ((Iafter NCS/Ibefore NCS) –1) × 100%. Where indicated, NCS compound was inactivated by preincubating 20 μm NCS compound in medium containing 10 mm cysteine for either 2 or 90 min. Control experiments showed that 10 mm cysteine did not significantly alter the response to GABA. The rate of modification was determined by repeatedly exposing an oocyte to 1 μm NCS compound in medium for 5 s every 4 min. The current amplitude elicited by GABA was always determined 3 min after NCS exposure. In control experiments the NCS solution also contained 1 μm Ro15-1788. To determine the reaction rate, relative increases in current amplitudes (stimulation) were plotted against cumulative application time of the NCS compound. Data were fitted to the equation, y = A*(1 – exp(–k*t)), where A is the final current amplitude, k the pseudo first order rate constant, and t is the time (KaleidaGraph, Synergy Software).RESULTSApproach—Our aim was to work out a strategy to reveal a reliable positioning of a benzodiazepine ligand in its binding pocket on GABAA receptors. In a first step, the diazepam or the flunitrazepam molecule was chemically modified such as to become reactive with a cysteine residue. Two molecules, an isothiocyanato and an alpha-chloro amido derivative respectively, were synthesized (Fig. 1). In a second step, it had to be shown that these modified molecules still retained affinity for the benzodiazepine binding site. In a third step, several of the residues in the binding pocket were individually mutated to cysteine, and it had to be demonstrated that the mutated receptors still bound benzodiazepine ligands. In a fourth step, functional mutated receptors were exposed to the modified, reactive ligand, and a covalent reaction was taken as evidence that the mutated residue and the reactive atom of the engineered ligand were directly apposed.Binding and Functional Properties of the Cysteine-reactive Ligands—Fig. 2 documents that a molecule in which the Cl– group in diazepam is replaced with a NCS group still is able to displace [3H]flunitrazepam from wild type α1β2γ2 receptors. Thus, the reactive molecule retained affinity for the benzodiazepine binding site. The Ki value for displacement of [3H]flunitrazepam was 3170 ± 1081 nm (mean ± S.D., n = 3). The Cl compound retained a higher affinity. Its Ki value for displacement of [3H]flunitrazepam was 262 ± 25 nm (mean ± S.D., n = 3). At the functional level, we only tested the NCS compound. It stimulated wild type α1β2γ2 receptors 113 ± 7% with an EC50 of 0.65 ± 0.12 μm (n = 4), showing that chemical modification left the positive allosteric properties intact. This was determined using concentrations of NCS compound up to 10 μm. At higher concentrations further stimulation, which was insensitive to Ro15-1788, was noted, possibly due to action at the low affinity binding site for benzodiazepines (69Walters R.J. Hadley S.H. Morris K.D. Amin J. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1274-1281Google Scholar).Fig. 2NCS compound retains affinity for the benzodiazepine binding site. Specific binding to wild type α1β2γ2 receptors expressed in HEK-293 cells is displaced in increasing concentrations of NCS compound. Three additional experiments gave similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Binding Properties of GABAA Receptors Carrying a Cysteine Point Mutation—Several amino acid residues putatively located in or near the benzodiazepine binding pocket were individually mutated to cysteine. We started with an investigation of α1H101Cβ2γ2, α1β2γ2T73C, α1β2γ2D75C, α1β2γ2A79C, and α1β2γ2T81C. Fig. 3 documents that the mutation to cysteine of histidine 101 of the α1 subunit does not compromise [3H]Ro15-1788 binding. Similarly, all mutated receptors investigated here retained at least some affinity for ligands of the benzodiazepine binding site. Table I summarizes these binding data. α1β2γ2F77C was not investigated, because it has been reported to be unable to recognize ligands of the benzodiazepine binding site (34Teisseré J.A. Czajkowski C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 4977-4986Google Scholar).Fig. 3High affinity of [3H]Ro15-1788 to α1H101Cβ2γ2 receptors expressed in HEK-293 cells.

Amyloids are thought to form by conversion of the native protein structure to a generic cross-β structure, identified by a characteristic x-ray diffraction pattern (12Sunde M. Serpell L.C. Bartlam M. Fraser P.E. Pepys M.B. Blake C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 729-739Google Scholar). However, an unusual property of Ure2 fibrils is their ability to maintain native-like ligand binding properties within the fibrillar arrays (8Bousset L. Thomson N.H. Radford S.E. Melki R.

Consistent with this, Ure2 fibrils formed by standing at subambient temperatures show a Fourier transform infrared spectrum consistent with native-like helical content (8Bousset L. Thomson N.H. Radford S.E. Melki R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2903-2911Google Scholar), and the cross-β x-ray diffraction band becomes apparent only after incubation of the protein close to the Tm (14Bousset L. Briki F. Doucet J. Melki R. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 141: 132-142Google Scholar). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging of these “native-like” fibrils shows them to be homogeneous, with a height of around 12 nm and a periodicity of around 50 nm (8Bousset L. Thomson N.H.

The ability of poly-Gln or poly-Asn regions to aggregate by forming a hydrogen bonded β-sheet structure is thought to cause disease (24Perutz M.F. Johnston T. Suzuki M. Finch J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Nature. 2002; 416: 507-511Google Scholar) or by sequestration of other vital cellular proteins (29Nucifora F. Sasaki M. Peters M.F. Huang H. Cooper J.K. Yamada M. Takahashi H. Tsuji S. Troncoso J. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Science. 2001; 291: 2423-2428Google Scholar, 30Chen S. Berthelier V. Yang W. Wetzel R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 173-182Google Scholar). There is evidence for poly-Gln and other amyloid diseases that the species most damaging to cells are protofibrils, or intermediates formed early in the aggregation process, rather than large fibrillar aggregates (31Haass C. Steiner H. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 859-860Google Scholar, 32Walsh D.M. Klyubin I. Fadeeva J.V. Cullen W.K. Anwyl R. Wolfe M.S. Rowan M.J. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 2002; 416: 535-539Google Scholar). ThT binding provides a convenient method to measure the effect of different environmental factors on the kinetics of amyloid formation (9Zhu L. Zhang X.J. Wang L.Y. Zhou J.M. Perrett S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 235-254Google Scholar, 33Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44284-44296Google Scholar). The time course of Ure2 amyloid formation monitored by ThT binding shows a sigmoidal curve, representing a lag time, an exponential growth phase, and a plateau region (7Schlumpberger M. Wille H. Baldwin M.A. Butler D.A. Herskowitz I. Prusiner S.B. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 440-451Google Scholar, 8Bousset L. Thomson N.H. Radford S.E. Melki R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2903-2911Google Scholar, 9Zhu L. Zhang X.J. Wang L.Y. Zhou J.M. Perrett S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 235-254Google Scholar). The lag time can be circumvented by seeding with preformed amyloid-like fibrils (5Taylor K.L. Cheng N. Williams R.W. Steven A.C. Wickner R.B. Science. 1999; 283: 1339-1342Google Scholar, 6Thual C. Komar A.A. Bousset L. Fernandez-Bellot E. Cullin C. Melki R. J. Biol.

Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 440-451Google Scholar) and is protein concentration-dependent (6Thual C. Komar A.A. Bousset L. Fernandez-Bellot E. Cullin C. Melki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13666-13674Google Scholar, 9Zhu L. Zhang X.J. Wang L.Y. Zhou J.M. Perrett S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 235-254Google Scholar). This is consistent with a nucleation-dependent mechanism (34Jarrett J.T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Cell. 1993; 73: 1055-1058Google Scholar, 35Kelly J.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 824-826Google Scholar), where the lag time reflects the kinetic barrier to association of a sufficient number of molecules to form a thermodynamically stable nucleus or seed. However, once this stable nucleus is formed, exponential growth from the fibril ends is then observed, until steady-state conditions are reached. Results from a number of laboratories indicate that conditions that produce this characteristic increase in dye binding for Ure2 also lead to the eventual appearance of well formed amyloid-like fibrils, visualized by EM or AFM (5Taylor K.L. Cheng N. Williams R.W. Steven A.C. Wickner R.B. Science. 1999; 283: 1339-1342Google Scholar, 6Thual C. Komar A.A. Bousset L. Fernandez-Bellot E. Cullin C. Melki R. J. Biol.

Oligomeric particles or rods of Ure2 have been observed by EM (6Thual C. Komar A.A. Bousset L. Fernandez-Bellot E. Cullin C. Melki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13666-13674Google Scholar) and AFM (8Bousset L. Thomson N.H. Radford S.E. Melki R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2903-2911Google Scholar). However, the relationship between the time course of changes in ThT binding and evolution of amyloid-like structure has not been investigated for Ure2. AFM offers particular advantages over EM, in that hydrated samples can be observed directly, in air, without requirement for staining. In addition, AFM can detect the presence of aggregated species as well as differences in fibril morphology which are not apparent in EM images (8Bousset L. Thomson N.H. Radford S.E. Melki R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2903-2911Google Scholar, 36Stine W.B. Snyder S.W. Ladror U.S. Wade W.S. Miller M.F. Perun T.J. Holzman T.F. Krafft G.A. J.

Here we compare the time course of structural changes monitored by ThT binding and AFM and examine the role of different parts of the Ure2 PrD sequence on the kinetics of fibril formation. Materials—ThT and Tris were from Sigma. Ure2 and N-terminal variants, 15Ure2, Δ15–42Ure2, 42Ure2, and 90Ure2 (see Fig. 1) were produced in Escherichia coli with a short His tag and purified as described previously (9Zhu L. Zhang X.J. Wang L.Y. Zhou J.M. Perrett S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 235-254Google Scholar, 16Perrett S. Freeman S.J. Butler P.J.G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 331-345Google Scholar). 42Ure2 was constructed as described previously for the other mutants (16Perrett S. Freeman S.J. Butler P.J.G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 331-345Google Scholar). Proteins were stored at –80 °C and defrosted in a 25 °C water bath immediately prior to use. Samples were prepared in 50 mm KH2PO4-Na2HPO4 buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl, or in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl as described (9Zhu L. Zhang X.J. Wang L.Y. Zhou J.M. Perrett S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 235-254Google Scholar) and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove any aggregated protein. Amyloid Formation—The kinetics of amyloid formation of Ure2 proteins was monitored using ThT binding fluorescence as described previously (7Schlumpberger M. Wille H. Baldwin M.A. Butler D.A. Herskowitz I. Prusiner S.B. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 440-451Google Scholar, 9Zhu L. Zhang X.J. Wang L.Y. Zhou J.M. Perrett S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 235-254Google Scholar, 33Uversky V.N. Li J.

Incubation was at a constant temperature of 25 or 37 °C with shaking, as described previously (9Zhu L. Zhang X.J. Wang L.Y. Zhou J.M. Perrett S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 235-254Google Scholar). Alternatively, proteins were incubated without shaking at 4 or 25 °C. NaN3 (0.02% w/v) was added to prevent bacterial growth. The pH range of buffers used was 7.5–8.4 (at 25 °C), and the protein concentration range was 15–40 μm for full-length Ure2 and 30–140 μm for Ure2 mutants. The pH values given in the text are correct at the temperature of incubation, allowing for the temperature dependence of the pH of Tris buffer. At regular time intervals, 10-μl aliquots were removed from the reaction mixture and assayed for ThT binding, as described previously (9Zhu L. Zhang X.J. Wang L.Y. Zhou J.M. Perrett S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 235-254Google Scholar). Samples were incubated in parallel whenever possible. When comparing the time course of amyloid formation by ThT binding and AFM, samples were taken simultaneously from the same reaction vessel whenever possible. AFM—A 10-μl drop of the protein sample was deposited on freshly cleaved mica, allowed to stand for 10 min in air, then washed with three 200-μl aliquots of distilled deionized water, before drying for 4 min in a stream of nitrogen. Tapping mode AFM was performed using a Nanoscope IIIa Multimode-AFM instrument (Digital Instruments) under ambient conditions. Super-sharp silicon tips (Silicon-MDT Ltd.) with resonance frequency of about 106 kHz were used at a scan rate of 1–2 Hz. Once the tip was engaged, the set point value was adjusted to minimize the force exerted on the sample while maintaining the sharpness of the image. Height measurements of granular and fibrillar particles were performed manually using the software provided with the Nanoscope instrument. To compare the size distribution of granules over time, the maximal height of every granular particle detected within a representative scan area of fixed size was measured for each time point. To determine the distribution of heights of fibrils, the height profiles were measured perpendicular to the fibril over a region greater than the periodicity of height variations within an individual fibril. The average peak height for each fibril was recorded (maximal variation around 1 nm). Mean heights were obtained by fitting to a Gaussian curve. The errors shown are the standard deviation. Scanning different regions of the mica surface confirmed that the distribution of particles or fibrils was uniform and that the scan areas sampled were representative, with the exception that protofilaments were deposited preferentially at the edge of the grids, suggesting that they are more easily dislodged from the mica surface by the washing process than mature fibrils. This has important consequences for the interpretation of the data because it indicates that although protofilament formation clearly precedes fibril formation, protofilaments are present earlier and more abundantly than apparent from the AFM assay procedure. This may explain in part the increased tendency to observe protofilaments when fibrils are grown in situ on the mica (39Goldsbury C. Kistler J. Aebi U. Arvinte T. Cooper G.J.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 33-39Google Scholar). Ure2 Mutants 15Ure2 and Δ15–42Ure2 Show an Increase in the Lag Time Detected by ThT Binding—ThT binding provides a convenient method to assay the effect of different factors on the kinetics of amyloid formation (9Zhu L. Zhang X.J. Wang L.Y. Zhou J.M. Perrett S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 235-254Google Scholar, 33Uversky V.N. Li J. Fink A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44284-44296Google Scholar). We compared the ThT-monitored kinetics of amyloid formation for full-length Ure2 and a series of PrD deletion mutants. The mutants examined were 15Ure2, which lacks the first stretch of repetitive sequence; Δ15–42Ure2, which retains all the Asn/Gln repeat regions, but lacks the island of “normal” random sequence within the PrD; 42Ure2, which lacks the first 41 residues of the PrD; and 90Ure2, in which the entire Asn/Gln repeat region has been deleted (Fig. 1). The WT and mutant Ure2 proteins were compared under a range of incubation conditions, including different temperatures (4, 25, and 37 °C), buffer systems (sodium/potassium phosphate or Tris-HCl), and with or without agitation. Representative curves for a variety of conditions are shown in Fig. 2. The mutants 42Ure2 and 90Ure2 showed a negligible increase in ThT binding fluorescence even at maximal protein concentrations. This is consistent with the requirement of residues 1–65 for induction or maintenance of the prion state in vivo (2Masison D.C. Wickner R.B. Science. 1995; 270: 93-95Google Scholar, 40Masison D.C. Maddelein M.L. Wickner R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12503-12508Google Scholar). Interestingly, the mutant 15Ure2 consistently showed a sigmoidal time course monitored by ThT binding, similar to that for WT Ure2, but with a longer lag time (Fig. 2). Δ15–42Ure2 showed greatly reduced binding to ThT compared with 15Ure2 or WT. However, under certain conditions (particularly in Tris buffer at relatively high protein concentrations), the limited increase in ThT binding for Δ15–42Ure2 could be seen to be sigmoidal, revealing a lag time slower than for WT Ure2 and similar to 15Ure2 at the same protein concentration (Fig. 2B). This suggests a role of both Asn/Gln repeat (residues 1–14) and nonrepeat (residues 15–42) regions of the PrD in nucleation of amyloid structure. However, it also indicates that deletion of either one of these two regions does not ablate the ability to form an amyloid-like structure. Characterization of the Ure2 Dimer by AFM—AFM height imaging provides a convenient method to characterize the morphology of biological macromolecules at submolecular resolution without requirement for staining (36Stine W.B.

Typically, the sample is adsorbed onto mica, and the surface is scanned with an oscillating or “tapping” tip on a microcantilever. The variations in height can then be represented by a gray scale, ranging from white (high) to black (low), to form the image. A characteristic of AFM imaging is that the size of the scanning tip relative to the size of protein oligomers or fibrils results in an overestimation of the width, whereas the height of the sample above the mica surface can be measured with accuracy and reproducibility. Nevertheless, the height of biological molecules measured by AFM tends to be smaller than the diameter measured by other structural methods, which may reflect the absence of stain, the degree of hydration, and/or compression by the AFM tip. To calibrate the height of the Ure2 dimer by AFM, we prepared a series of dilutions of Ure2 and the mutants Δ15–42Ure2 and 90Ure2 in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.4, 0.2 m NaCl at 25 °C. Under these conditions the protein shows a minimal tendency to aggregate and is expected to be predominantly dimeric at micromolar protein concentrations (16Perrett S. Freeman S.J. Butler P.J.G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 331-345Google Scholar), although species with sedimentation values corresponding to monomers and tetramers are detected under similar buffer conditions at 15 °C, depending on the protein concentration (6Thual C. Komar A.A. Bousset L. Fernandez-Bellot E. Cullin C. Melki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13666-13674Google Scholar). After adsorption of a 1 μm protein solution of WT or mutant Ure2 onto mica, AFM imaging reveals a homogenous population of spherical particles (Fig. 3). The predominant species has a height of 2.6 ± 0.5 nm (Fig. 3C, upper panel). The WT sample contained a minor population (less than 5%) of larger particles (Fig. 3A), which have heights in the range 4–8 nm (data not shown). At lower protein concentrations, an additional peak at 1.3 ± 0.3 nm appears (Fig. 3C, lower panel), consistent with population of the monomer. Identical peaks are observed for WT Ure2, Δ15–42Ure2, and 90Ure2, indicating that the PrD does not contribute to the height of the Ure2 monomer or dimer as measured by AFM. Comparison of Time Course of Structural Changes Monitored by ThT Binding and AFM—To ascertain the structural basis of the differences in kinetics detected by ThT binding for Ure2 and the PrD mutants described above, we measured the time course of structural changes in parallel by ThT binding and tapping mode AFM. In each case, aliquots were removed from the reaction vessel for assay. Fig. 4 shows a comparison of the time course measured by the two methods for Ure2 incubated in phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, at 37 °C with shaking. Under these conditions, abundant well formed fibrils are formed within 24 h, as detected by EM, and the time course of ThT binding is highly reproducible and relatively rapid (9Zhu L. Zhang X.J. Wang L.Y. Zhou J.M. Perrett S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 235-254Google Scholar), so that a plateau is reached within 12 h (Fig. 4A). The initial Ure2 protein solution was found to contain a variety of sizes of granular particles (Fig. 4, B and E, 0 h), ranging in height from 1 to 85 nm, although greater than 90% of the particles were less than 20 nm in height. The larger particles appear to be dispersed or precipitated after the onset of shaking and are concluded to represent amorphous aggregates. Occasional fibrillar structures are also detected in the initial sample (Fig. 4E, 0 h). The presence of a low concentration of preformed fibrils, or nuclei for fibril formation, could account for the linear rather than exponential dependence of the lag time on initial Ure2 concentration, as discussed previously (9Zhu L. Zhang X.J. Wang L.Y. Zhou J.M. Perrett S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 235-254Google Scholar). Changes in the height distribution of granular particles over the time course of the ThT-monitored curve were examined by recording the heights of all granules within a representative 2-μm square at hourly time points between the onset of incubation (0 h) and the onset of fibril formation (7 h). Within the lag phase region (0–2 h), there was a marked increase in the number of particles of height 4–6 nm, which was then followed (2–3 h) by an increase in particles of height 8–12 nm (Fig. 4C), coinciding with an increase in ThT binding fluorescence (Fig. 4A). Given the height of the Ure2 dimer of 2.6 ± 0.5 nm (Fig. 3), this then suggests that the 4–6-nm particles that appear during the lag phase are tetramers or hexamers, whereas the 8–12-nm particles are likely to represent larger oligomers. The earliest fibril-like structures appear late in the exponential phase of ThT binding (6 h) and have a height of around 5 nm, thus resembling the protofilaments observed for other amyloidogenic proteins (28Bucciantini M.

These are succeeded by 8-nm fibrils (7 h) and then 12-nm fibrils (8 h). Significant numbers of fibrillar structures are not detected until ThT binding has already reached a plateau (Fig. 4, A, D, and E). However, the number of protofilaments is underestimated in the AFM assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). It is therefore likely that both protofilaments (5 nm; also 2.5 nm, see below) and larger granules (8–12 nm) contribute to the onset of ThT binding. Continued monitoring of the fibril heights and morphology reveals further structural changes over time, with little further variation in the ThT binding fluorescence (Fig. 4). Early in the plateau phase (8 h), the majority of fibrils have a height of around 12 nm and a relatively smooth appearance, although the height is observed to vary with a periodicity of 40–70 nm, similar to the “native-like” fibrils produced after a week of standing in Tris buffer at 4 °C (8Bousset L. Thomson N.H. Radford S.E. Melki R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2903-2911Google Scholar). Over the course of the following hours and days of incubation at 37 °C, there was a gradual decrease in the mean fibril height, until at 7 days the fibril heights resolved into two peaks, indicating the presence of two distinct fibril types (Fig. 4D). (Fitting the combined data to a two-peak Gaussian gives a height of 11.8 ± 0.9 nm for the fibril type that dominates early in the plateau phase, and a height of 9.0 ± 1.2 nm for the fibril type that dominates at extended incubation times.) The other change that is apparent over this time period is that most fibrils no longer appear smooth, but have a clearly distinguishable twisted or zigzag morphology (Fig. 5A). Careful inspection reveals that the small proportion of “twisted” fibrils present at time points when 12-nm fibrils dominate (twisted fibrils indicated by arrows in Fig. 5A, 8 h) consistently have heights of around 8 nm. This then indicates that as well as protofilaments, at least two additional types of fibr"

A large body of work investigating the mechanisms underlying receptor-G protein interactions supports a network of interactions between signaling pathways that converge and diverge at multiple levels, enabling cells to coordinate responses to diverse environmental stimuli (4Brady A.E.

The hitherto existing knowledge of GPCR signal transduction pathways are founded largely upon experimental data obtained by the individual stimulation of the receptor of interest by specific ligands, either in heterologous expression systems or native tissues. Yet, under physiological conditions cells are permanently co-stimulated by various agonists. Investigations using receptor co-stimulation with agonists have recently shown cooperative effects of Gi/o and Gs (5Yao L. Arolfo M.P. Dohrman D.P. Jiang Z. Fan P. Fuchs S. Janak P.H. Gordon A.S.

Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), as well as Gβγ-mediated glucocorticoid receptor transactivation (9Schmidt P. Holsboer F. Spengler D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 553-564PubMed Google Scholar). Such synergistic signaling mechanisms have been suggested to play an important role in signal adaptation (8Quitterer U. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and may have a significant role in both physiological and pathophysiological processes (5Yao L. Arolfo M.P. Dohrman D.P. Jiang Z.

Investigations of GPCRs expressed in surrogate cell systems have greatly modified our understanding of the pharmacological properties of GPCRs and consequently of the mechanistic drug-receptor models used to simulate drug action (10Tate C.G. Grisshammer R. Trends Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 426-430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 11Kenakin T. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 349-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). One of the prominent recent additions to our understanding of GPCR action is the occurrence of constitutive, agonist-independent GPCR activity (12Milligan G. Bond R.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 468-474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 13Milligan G. Bond R.A. Lee M. Trends Pharmacol.

Pharmacol. 2002; 366: 381-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Currently, all models consider agonist-independent activity secondary to spontaneous isomerization of the receptors between the inactive and active receptor state(s), which couple(s) to the G protein; agonists are considered to preferentially bind to the active receptor state, whereas inverse agonists preferentially bind to the inactive receptor state (11Kenakin T. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 349-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Despite initial concerns, the physiological relevance of constitutive GPCR activity is now accepted, and it appears not only to be a common property of GPCRs but, in various instances, also to be involved in the initiation or progression of disease (15Seifert R. Wenzel-Seifert K. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2002; 366: 381-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Various polymorphic GPCR variants have been shown to be highly constitutively active (15Seifert R. Wenzel-Seifert K. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2002; 366: 381-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 16Spiegel A.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 143-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), but also certain wild-type GPCRs, such as the histamine H3 receptor, exhibit high constitutive activity in vivo (17Morisset S. Rouleau A. Ligneau X. Gbahou F. Tardivel-Lacombe J. Stark H. Schunack W. Ganellin C.R. Schwartz J.C. Arrang J.M. Nature. 2000; 408: 860-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Moreover, viral infection of cells may also result in the expression of virally encoded GPCRs that exhibit high levels of constitutive activity (18Casarosa P. Menge W.M. Minisini R. Otto C. van Heteren J. Jongejan A. Timmerman H. Moepps B. Kirchhoff F. Mertens T. Smit M.J. Leurs R. J. Biol.

To date, the impact of constitutive GPCR activity on signaling properties on co-expressed GPCRs has not been studied in full detail, despite the potential (patho)physiological relevance. In the present study, we investigated the potential cross-talk between a variety of Gi/o- and constitutively active Gq/11-coupled receptors using a heterologous expression system. Our data indicate that both activated histamine H1R and HCMV-encoded receptor US28 can result in the propagation of Gi/o-coupled receptor dependent signaling. Therefore, active Gq/11-coupled receptors constitute a regulatory role in the regulation of Gi/o-coupled receptor signaling events. As a consequence, the synergistic activation of signaling cascades that is observed upon co-expression of constitutively active receptors may be modulated by ligands acting at either Gi/o- or Gq/11-coupled receptors.

DNA Constructs—Δ(2–22)-US28 and the HA-tagged versions of both wild-type and Δ(2–22)-US28 were generated by PCR as described previously (18Casarosa P. Menge W.M. Minisini R. Otto C. van Heteren J.

The single amino acid mutation for US28-R129A was introduced using the Altered Sites® II in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega, Madison, WI) as described earlier (22Waldhoer M. Casarosa P.

All constructs were verified by dideoxy sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 African green monkey kidney cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mml-glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected using the DEAE-dextran method as described previously (23Casarosa P. Bakker R.A. Verzijl D. Navis M. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Smit M.J. J. Biol.

[3H]Inositol Phosphate Formation—Cells were seeded in 24-well plates and labeled overnight in inositol-free culture medium supplemented with 1 μCi/ml myo-[2-3H]inositol 24 h after transfection. Subsequently, the medium was aspirated, and cells were incubated with drugs for 1 h at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and 20 mm LiCl. Incubations were stopped by aspiration of the culture medium and the addition of cold 10 mm formic acid. After 90 min of incubation at 4 °C, [3H]inositol phosphates were isolated by anion exchange chromatography as we described previously (23Casarosa P. Bakker R.A. Verzijl D. Navis M. Timmerman H.

Reporter Gene Assay—Cells transiently co-transfected with pNF-κB-Luc (125 μg/1·107 cells, Stratagene) and plasmid DNA encoding the various receptors (25 μg/1·107 cells) were seeded in 96-well blackplates (Costar) in serum-free culture medium and incubated with drugs. After 48 h, cells were assayed for luminescence by aspiration of the medium and the addition of 25 μl/well luciferase assay reagent (0.83 mm ATP, 0.83 mm d-luciferin, 18.7 mm MgCl2, 0.78 μm Na2H2P2O7, 38.9 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 0.39% (v/v) glycerol, 0.03% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 2.6 μm dithiothreitol). After 30 min luminescence was measured for 3 s/well in a Victor2 Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). H1R Binding Studies—COS-7 cells used for radioligand binding studies were harvested 48 h after transfection and homogenized in ice-cold H1-binding buffer. The COS-7 cell homogenates were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C in 50 mm Na2/K-phosphate buffer (pH = 7.4) in 400 μl with 1 nm [3H]mepyramine. The nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm mianserin. The incubations were stopped by rapid dilution with 3 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Na2/K-phosphate buffer (pH = 7.4). The bound radioactivity was separated by filtration through Whatman GF/C filters that had been treated with 0.3% polyethyleneimine. Filters were washed twice with 3 ml of buffer, and radioactivity retained on the filters was measured by liquid scintillation counting. 5-HT1BR Binding Studies—COS-7 cells used for 5-HT1BR binding studies were harvested 48h after transfection and homogenized in ice-cold 5-HT1BR-binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), containing 4 mm CaCl2, 100 μm ascorbic acid, and 10 μm pargyline). 5-HT1BR binding studies were performed using ∼7 nm [3H]5-HT. The COS-7 cell homogenates were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 5-HT1BR-binding buffer in 400 μl with 7 nm [3H]5-HT. The nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm GR-127935. The incubations were stopped by rapid dilution with 3 ml of ice-cold 5-HT1BR-binding buffer. The bound radioactivity was separated by filtration through Whatman GF/C filters that had been treated with 0.3% polyethyleneimine. Filters were washed twice with 3 ml of buffer, and radioactivity retained on the filters was measured by liquid scintillation counting. A KD of 6.8 nm was subsequently used to calculate the expression levels of the 5-HT1BR (25Dickenson J.M. Hill S.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 348: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). US28 Receptor Binding Studies—The transfected COS-7 cells used for radioligand binding studies were seeded in 24-well plates; 48 h after transfection, binding was performed on whole cells for 3 h at 4 °C using [125I]CCL5 (RANTES) in binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin). After incubation, cells were washed four times at 4 °C with binding buffer supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 0.1 μm unlabeled CCL5. ELISA—48 h after transfection, receptor expression in COS-7 cells was measured using an ELISA as described previously (18Casarosa P. Menge W.M. Minisini R. Otto C. van Heteren J. Jongejan A.

A mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody was used as primary antibody and a goat anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase conjugate as secondary antibody. The 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine liquid substrate system for ELISA was used as substrate, and the optical density was measured in a Victor2 at 450 nm. Analytical Methods—All data shown are expressed as means ± S.E. The data from radioligand-binding and functional assays data were evaluated by a nonlinear, least squares curve-fitting procedure using Graphpad Prism® (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Constitutive H1R Activity and Inverse Agonistic Properties of Antihistamines—Transient expression of human H1R in COS-7 cells resulted in a high affinity binding site for the H1R radioligand [3H]mepyramine (KD = 1.7 ± 0.2 nm, Bmax = 4.6 ± 0.1 pmol/mg protein, data not shown). H1R activates both PLC- and NF-κB-mediated enhancement of gene transcription as measured by the accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates and NF-κB-driven reporter gene assays, respectively, in an agonist-dependent and -independent manner (Fig. 1). Moreover, the H1R-selective antagonist mepyramine acts as an inverse H1R agonist for the constitutive H1R-mediated activation of these signal transduction pathways. These data are in agreement with previous results indicating the constitutive H1R activity and inverse H1R agonistic properties of various antihistamines (24Bakker R.A. Schoonus S. Smit M.J. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 26Bakker R.A. Wieland K. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 387: R5-R7Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The H1R-mediated effects on PLC and NF-κB activation are PTX-insensitive (see also Fig. 2A), indicating that the Gi/o family of G proteins is not involved in these H1R-mediated responses (24Bakker R.A. Schoonus S. Smit M.J. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 26Bakker R.A. Wieland K. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 387: R5-R7Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have shown that constitutive H1R-mediated activation of these pathways can be enhanced selectively via co-expression of G proteins that belong to the Gq/11 family of G proteins (24Bakker R.A. Schoonus S. Smit M.J. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), confirming that the H1R is coupled to Gαq/11 proteins for modulation of these signaling events in these cells.Fig. 2Effects of co-expression of Gi/o-coupled receptors, together with human H1R, on NF-κB activation.A, effects of PTX treatment (100 ng/ml) on NF-κB activation in cells expressing either human H1R or H1R together with either 5-HT1BR or the adenosine A1 receptor. B, effects of co-expression of H1R together with the muscarinic M2 receptor on NF-κB activation. Also the effects of the muscarinic agonist carbachol (10 μm; Car) and the effects of PTX (100 ng/ml) and mepyramine (10 μm; Mep) on this agonist treatment are shown. Shown are representative experiments, each performed in triplicate. RLU, relative light unit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Constitutive Activation of NF-κB by the h5-HT1BR—We evaluated the human 5-HT1BR for constitutive activity upon transient expression of this receptor in COS-7 cells. Expression of the receptor was verified by [3H]5-HT radioligand binding studies, indicating 5-HT1BR expression levels of ∼310 fmol/mg protein (data not shown). We also assessed the capacity of 5-HT1BRs to mediate activation of NF-κB. In 5-HT1BR-expressing cells the selective 5-HT1B agonist CGS-12066A (CGS) (27Neale R.F. Fallon S.L. Boyar W.C. Wasley J.W. Martin L.L. Stone G.A. Glaeser B.S. Sinton C.M. Williams M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1987; 136: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and 5-HT stimulate NF-κB activation only ∼0.6-fold (Fig. 1D). Despite the functional 5-HT1BR expression in these cells, we did not detect constitutive 5-HT1BR activation in our reporter gene assay, as the selective inverse 5-HT1BR agonist SB-224289 (28Selkirk J.V. Scott C. Ho M. Burton M.J. Watson J. Gaster L.M. Collin L. Jones B.J. Middlemiss D.N. Price G.W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) was without effect on basal NF-κB activation in 5-HT1BR-expressing cells (data not shown). Consistent with the notion of a Gi/o-coupled 5-HT1BR receptor, 5-HT1BR-mediated NF-κB activation was PTX-sensitive (Fig. 1D), indicating the involvement of Gi/o proteins in 5-HT1BR-mediated NF-κB activation. 5-HT1BR Signaling in Cells Co-expressing H1R—In agreement with previous reports on agonist-mediated signaling (25Dickenson J.M. Hill S.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 348: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 29Selbie L.A. Hill S.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 87-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), stimulation of COS-7 cells co-expressing H1R and 5-HT1BR with 10 μm CGS, a selective 5-HT1BR-agonist (27Neale R.F. Fallon S.L. Boyar W.C. Wasley J.W. Martin L.L. Stone G.A. Glaeser B.S. Sinton C.M. Williams M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1987; 136: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), results in a marked elevation of the inositol phosphate accumulation (Fig. 1C). Surprisingly, however, treatment of cells co-expressing both H1R and 5-HT1BR with 10 μm CGS resulted in a robust PLC and NF-κB activation, yielding almost the same efficacy as histamine (His), which was completely sensitive to the inverse H1R agonist mepyramine (10 μm, Fig. 1, C and D), indicating the importance of constitutive H1R activity for the observed response to CGS. CGS is without effect on H1R-mediated NF-κB activation in cells transfected with only H1R-cDNA (Fig. 3A), whereas mepyramine (10 μm) does not influence CGS-induced 5-HT1BR-mediated NF-κB activation in cells transfected with only the 5-HT1BR-cDNA (data not shown), indicating that these ligands are selective for their respective receptors. Moreover, also in [3H]5-HT and [3H]mepyramine binding studies both ligands turned out to behave as selective ligands (data not shown). H1R expression levels were unaffected by co-expression of 5-HT1BR as determined by [3H]mepyramine radioligand binding studies (Bmax = 4.6 ± 1.3 pmol/mg protein, data not shown). As seen in Figs. 2A and 3, A and C, co-expression of both GPCRs not only results in CGS-induced 5-HT1BR-mediated NF-κB activation but also in a 2–3-fold increase in basal NF-κB activation. The fold over basal activation of NF-κB by histamine is reduced from 4.8 ± 0.4-fold (n = 76), when H1R is expressed alone, to 3.3 ± 0.5-fold (n = 9)-fold, upon co-expression of the 5-HT1BR. These data do not reflect a suppression of the response to histamine when H1R is co-expressed with 5-HT1BR; however, because of the increase in the level of basal signaling, it does result in a reduced fold of stimulation. The constitutive NF-κB activation observed upon co-expression of both GPCRs is partially PTX-sensitive but was completely inhibited by mepyramine (Fig. 2A). PTX treatment of the cells had no effect on mepyramine-treated cells (Fig. 2A). H1R is known to exhibit stereospecificity toward the enantiomers of the partial inverse H1R agonist cetirizine (24Bakker R.A. Schoonus S. Smit M.J. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 26Bakker R.A. Wieland K. Timmerman H. Leurs R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 387: R5-R7Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Indeed, the inhibition of CGS-induced NF-κB activation by the enantiomers of cetirizine is found to be stereospecific in cells coexpressing H1R and 5-HT1BR (Fig. 3B). The PTX-sensitive increase in basal H1R-mediated NF-κB activation that is observed upon 5-HT1BR co-expression, but not the constitutive H1R activity itself, is potently inhibited by the inverse 5-HT1BR agonist SB-224289 (28Selkirk J.V. Scott C. Ho M. Burton M.J. Watson J. Gaster L.M. Collin L. Jones B.J. Middlemiss D.N. Price G.W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, C and D). SB-224289 inhibited constitutive NF-κB activation in cells coexpressing H1 and 5-HT1B receptors to the level of basal NF-κB activation as observed in H1R-expressing cells not expressing the 5-HT1BR, indicating the presence of constitutive 5-HT1BR-activity upon co-expression with H1R (Fig. 3C). The observed pIC50 value of 8.0 ± 0.2 is in good agreement with literature data for SB-224289 acting on 5-HT1BR (28Selkirk J.V. Scott C. Ho M. Burton M.J. Watson J. Gaster L.M. Collin L. Jones B.J. Middlemiss D.N. Price G.W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). SB-224289 is without effect on H1R-mediated NF-κB activation in cells only expressing the H1R, indicating that SB-224289 does not exert its effects of inhibition of constitutive NF-κB activation in cells co-expressing H1 and 5-HT1B receptors by acting at H1Rs. 2R. A. Bakker, P. Casarosa, H. Timmerman, M. J. Smit, and R. Leurs, unpublished data. Effects of Co-expression of Other Gi/o-coupled Receptors on Constitutive H1R Activity—To test whether these observations are exclusive for 5-HT1BR, we co-expressed H1R with other Gi/o-coupled receptors: the adenosine A1 and the muscarinic M2 receptors. Co-expression of H1R with the A1 or M2 receptor indeed resulted in a similar increase in basal NF-κB activation, which was largely PTX-sensitive (Fig. 2). As observed after co-expression with the 5-HT1BR, PTX-insensitive NF-κB activation is fully inhibited by mepyramine, indicating that the increased NF-κB activation depends on constitutive H1R signaling. Stimulation of the M2 receptor with the muscarinic agonist carbachol results in a further increased mepyramine- and PTX-sensitive NF-κB activation (Fig. 2B). We also tested the ability of a Gi/o-coupled α2A adrenergic receptor, in which the C terminus is fused to a Gαo subunit that harbors a mutation that renders the Gαo insensitive to PTX (α2A-GoC351I) (20Wise A. Watson-Koken M.A. Rees S. Lee M. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), to enhance NF-κB activation of co-expressed H1Rs. As expected, stimulation of the α2A receptor with the specific agonist clonidine resulted in a PTX-insensitive increase in NF-κB activation that could be fully inhibited by mepyramine, indicating that the PTX-insensitive GαoC351I subunit fused to the α2A receptor mediates NF-κB activation via H1R (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2056063805,"Metal-responsive transcription factor 1 (MTF-1) specifically binds to metal response elements (MREs) associated with a number of metal- and stress-responsive genes. Human MTF-1 contains a cysteine-rich cluster, -632Cys-Gln-Cys-Gln-Cys-Ala-Cys638-, conserved from pufferfish to humans far removed from the MRE-binding zinc finger domain and just C-terminal to a previously mapped serine/threonine-rich transcriptional activation domain. MTF-1 proteins containing two Cys→Ala substitutions (C632A/C634A) or a deletion in this region altogether (Δ(632-644)) are significantly impaired in their ability to induce Zn(II)- and Cd(II)-responsive transcription of a MRE-linked reporter gene in transiently transfected mouse dko7 (MTF-1-/-) cells in culture under moderate metal stress but retain the ability to drive basal levels of transcription in a MRE-dependent manner in vivo and in vitro. In addition, the mutated proteins respond to induction by Zn(II) or Cd(II) with nuclear translocation and MRE binding activities comparable with wild-type MTF-1. Attempts to rescue the Δ(632-644) deletion mutant phenotype by inserting similar Cys-rich sequences from Drosophila MTF-1 were unsuccessful, suggesting that the structure of this motif within intact human MTF-1, rather than the simple presence of multiple closely spaced Cys residues, is required for function. This cysteine cluster therefore functions at a step subsequent to nuclear translocation and MRE-binding DNA to naked promoter-containing DNA and appears to be specifically required for MTF-1 to activate transcription in the presence of inducing heavy metal ions.

Zinc and other transition metal ions play diverse roles in many biological processes, serving as structural components of proteins (1Laity J.H. Lee B.M. Wright P.E. Curr. Opin. Struct.

However, all metal ions become cytotoxic at high intracellular concentrations. Metal-responsive control of gene expression allows organisms to regulate the available concentration of beneficial metal ions such as zinc, copper, and iron within an acceptable range while removing toxic heavy metals that play no biological function such as cadmium, lead, mercury, and arsenic.

The primary distinguishing feature of the domain organization of MTF-1 proteins (Fig. 1A) is a highly conserved MRE-binding domain composed of six tandemly arranged Cys2-His2 zinc fingers that are known (18Giedroc D.P.

The zinc finger domain is flanked by nuclear localization and nuclear export signals required for intracellular trafficking in and out of the nucleus (23Saydam N. Georgiev O. Nakano M.Y. Greber U.F.

Redox Signal. 2000; 2: 739-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Multiple C-terminal transcriptional activation domains including acidic, proline-rich, and serine/threonine-rich regions are thought to mediate the interaction of MTF-1 with the transcriptional machinery under both basal and metal-induced conditions (26Radtke F. Georgiev O. Müller H.-P. Brugnera E. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2277-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Endogenous MTF-1 is extensively phosphorylated and becomes more so upon heavy metal stress. This post-translational modification clearly plays an important role in the signal transduction pathway of this stress response (27Saydam N. Adams T.K. Steiner F. Schaffner W. Freedman J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20438-20445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 28LaRochelle O. Stewart G. Moffatt P. Tremblay V. Seguin C. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 591-601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies are consistent with the hypothesis that one or more of the zinc fingers might play a metalloregulatory role by activating MRE-binding and/or transcriptional activation directly upon reversible binding of zinc. Current evidence suggests that zinc fingers F5 and F6 increase the stability of the MRE complex formed by structural fingers F1-F4 (29Chen X. Agarwal A. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11152-11161Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 30Chen X. Chu M. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12915-12925Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 31Apuy J.L.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15164-15175Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and that fingers F1, F5, and F6 are essential for MTF-1 to activate gene expression from an endogenous metallothionein promoter packaged in chromatin (32Jiang H. Daniels P.J. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30394-30402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) but not from a promoter containing tandemly linked MREs present on extra-chromosomal DNA (33Bittel D.C.

Physiol. 2000; 185: 464-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this study, we identify and characterize a cysteine-rich regulatory site outside of the zinc finger domain, C-terminal to the serine/threonine-rich transcriptional activation domain. This region of the protein is required for Zn(II) and Cd(II) sensing in vivo under moderate metal stress and appears to function directly in transcriptional activation. Plasmids—The expression plasmid pChMTF-1 (26Radtke F. Georgiev O. Müller H.-P. Brugnera E. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2277-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) in which transcription of the human MTF-1 cDNA is driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter was modified by fusing coding sequences for a c-Myc epitope tag (EQKLISEEDL) to the C terminus of the MTF-1 gene to generate c-Myc-pChMTF-1. Cysteine-to-alanine mutations, deletion of MTF-1 amino acids 632-644, and human/Drosophila MTF-1 chimeras were constructed with the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene) using appropriate primers and pChMTF-1 or c-Myc-pChMTF-1 as a template. All of the constructs were completely sequenced to verify that the desired mutations were present and that other alterations had not been inadvertently introduced. The luciferase reporter plasmid pLucMRE was constructed by inserting four tandem repeats of the MREa sequence (GGCTTTTGCACTCGTCCCGGCT) from the human metallothionein-IIA gene (35Koizumi S. Suzuki K. Ogra Y. Yamada H. Otsuka F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) into the HindIII and SalI sites of pLuc-MCS (Stratagene) upstream of a basal promoter that drives transcription of firefly luciferase. pSVβ-galactosidase (Promega) contains the E. coli lacZ gene, transcription of which is driven by the SV40 early promoter and enhancer. The reporter (4×MREd-OVEC) and β-globin reference (OVEC-REF) genes used in the in vitro transcription experiments have been described previously (36Westin G. Gerster T. Muller M.M. Schaffner G. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 6787-6798Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Mouse dko7 cells (9Heuchel R. Radtke F. Georgiev O. Stark G. Aguet M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2870-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), which express no MTF-1, were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DME, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (pen-strep, Hyclone) at 37 °C in a water-saturated atmosphere containing 5% CO2. HEK293 cells were cultured as described previously (17Zhang B. Egli D. Georgiev O. Schaffner W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4505-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Transient Transfection—Chelex-treated DME (used as described below) was prepared by passing 500 ml of FBS- and pen-strep-supplemented DME through a column (2.5 × 9 cm) containing Chelex 100 Resin (Bio-Rad) to remove metals. CaCl2 (1.55 mm), MgSO4 (0.67 mm), and FeCl3 (3.9 μm) were then added to restore the original concentration. In transfection experiments for luciferase assays, 3 × 105 cells were plated in each well of 6-well tissue culture plates. After waiting for the cells to attach (1-2 h), each well was washed with 1 ml of DME (without FBS and pen-strep) and 1.5 ml of Chelex-treated DME was then added. After 18-24 h, the cells were washed with 1 ml of DME (without FBS and pen-strep) and 1 ml DNA solution in DME (without FBS and pen-strep) containing pLucMRE (200 ng/ml), pSVβ-galactosidase (200 ng/ml), and MTF-1 expression plasmid (concentration as indicated in the figure legends) and 4 μl/ml LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) was added. After 4 h, 1 ml of DME (without FBS and pen-strep) was added to each well. 18-20 h after DNA addition to the cells, medium was replaced with DME (without FBS, but with pen-strep) containing metals as indicated in the figure legends. 10 h after metal induction, cells were lysed by washing each well twice with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and adding 250 μl of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) containing 0.5 mm DTT and 0.2% Triton X-100. The wells were briefly scraped, and the cell lysate was transferred to a Microfuge tube and centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a clean Microfuge tube, quick frozen in liquid N2, and stored at -80 °C until luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed. Transfection experiments for immunoblotting were performed as above with the exception that 3 × 106 cells were plated on 150-mm tissue culture plates and volumes of media, DNA solution, and so forth were 10-fold larger than those for the experiments performed in 6-well dishes. Metal treatment was for 8 h. After metal treatment, the cells were washed twice with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by scraping in 5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were recovered by centrifugation, and cytosolic and nuclear extract fractions were prepared using the NE-PER kit (Pierce) as recommended by the manufacturer, quick frozen in liquid N2, and stored at -80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216202) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Luciferase and β-Galactosidase Assays—Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed in a Packard Lumicount luminometer in 96-well assay plates. Luciferase assays contained 100 ml of a solution containing 40 mm Tricine (pH 7.8), 0.5 mm ATP, 10 mm MgSO4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT, 0.5 mm coenzyme A, 0.15 mg/ml luciferin (Sigma), and 5-50 μl of cellular (or cytosolic) extract. β-Galactosidase assays of 5-50 μl of cellular (or cytosolic) extract were performed in the same instrument using the Galacto-Light Plus chemiluminescent reporter assay kit (Tropix) as recommended by the manufacturer. Immunoblotting—Protein samples were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membrane (Hybond-P, Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was blocked by incubation in solution TBS-T (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk and then probed with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody directed against the c-Myc epitope (Invitrogen) diluted (1:5000) in TBS-T. After incubation for 1 h at 25 °C, the filter was washed in TBS-T at 25 °C, once for 15 min and then 3 times for 5 min each. Bound antibody was detected with the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences) using Kodak X-Omat AR Blue film (Eastman Kodak Company). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed according to Radtke et al. (7Radtke F. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Hergersberg M. Gariglio M. Dembic Z. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1355-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) with a 30-bp 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe containing a single copy of a consensus MRE-s sequence (7Radtke F. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Hergersberg M. Gariglio M. Dembic Z. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1355-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The binding reaction (20 μl) was carried out in a buffer containing 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 12% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.6 mm DTT, 0.5 μg of poly(dI·dC), 20 μg of nuclear extract protein, and 20 fmol of probe. Reactions were fractionated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (4% gel) in 0.0225 m Tris borate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.5 mm EDTA at room temperature. Labeled bands were detected with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Transcription—In vitro transcription assays were performed according to Mueller-Storm et al. (38Mueller-Storm H.P. Sogo J.M. Schaffner W. Cell. 1989; 58: 767-777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and Zhang et al. (39Zhang B. Georgiev O. Hagmann M. Günes C. Cramer M. Faller P. Vasak M. Schaffner W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8471-8485Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Reactions (15 μl) contained 40 μg of nuclear extract protein from HEK293 cells, 40 ng of a MRE-linked reporter construct (4xMREd-OVEC), and 40 ng of a reference plasmid in which β-globin transcription was driven by the SV40 early promoter (OVEC-REF). Reactions also contained 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 8.5% glycerol, 20 mm KCl, 7 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.15 mm DTT, 1.5 units of RNasin, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 0.5 mm each of ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP, and Zn(II) as indicated in the legend to Fig. 6. Some reactions (see legend to Fig. 6) were complemented with 39 μg of nuclear extract protein prepared from 293 cells that had been transfected with an MTF-1 expression plasmid prepared according to Schreiber et al. (40Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3916) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed at 30 °C for 60 min and fractionated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of 8 m urea. Products were visualized with a PhosphorImager. Mutations in the C-terminal Region of MTF-1—MTF-1 includes a region of 32 amino acids beginning in the C-terminal portion of the serine/threonine-rich domain (residues 613-644 in human MTF-1) (26Radtke F. Georgiev O. Müller H.-P. Brugnera E. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2277-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 41Muller H.P. Brungnera E. Georgiev O. Badzong M. Muller K.H. Schaffner W. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1995; 21: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) that is strikingly conserved (Fig. 1A) (42Giedroc D.P. Chen X. Apuy J. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2001; 3: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This region is composed largely of hydrophobic residues, but it also contains the sequence 629EEACQCQCACRD641, which includes a number of potential metal-liganding amino acids. The role of these amino acids in metal-responsive transcription has not been directly tested, but it is possible that they could function in zinc recruitment or participate in the response of MTF-1 to metals other than zinc. To examine the role of cysteines in the C-terminal region of MTF-1, we constructed several mutations in the protein coding sequence. The mutations included deletion of 13 amino acids (Δ(632-644)) as well as cysteine-to-alanine mutations at positions 632 (C632A), 653 (C653A), or 696 (C696A) and a double substitution at positions 632 and 634 (C632A/C634A). In addition, two chimeric proteins were created in which sequences from the MTF-1 of D. melanogaster (17Zhang B. Egli D. Georgiev O. Schaffner W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4505-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) were inserted into the deletion site of Δ(632-644). The insertions contained amino acids 547-559 (Δ(632-644)+dMTF-(547-559)) or 547-565 (Δ(632-644)+dMTF-(547-565)) of the Drosophila protein. Although the exact sequence of the C-terminal region of the fly protein is not closely related to the human, mouse, and pufferfish sequences, Drosophila MTF-1 as well as the putative MTF-1 from mosquito contains an analogous cysteine-rich peptide in the same general region within the protein (Fig. 1C) (42Giedroc D.P. Chen X. Apuy J. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2001; 3: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). As described below, these constructs allowed us to test whether this region could replace the endogenous cysteine-rich element in the human protein. Metal-responsive Transcription Mediated by MTF-1 Derivatives—To assess the ability of our MTF-1 derivatives to affect transcription, we took advantage of a transient transfection assay with mouse dko7 cells, which express no endogenous MTF-1 (9Heuchel R. Radtke F. Georgiev O. Stark G. Aguet M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2870-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Plasmids directing expression of MTF-1 were based on pChMTF-1 (26Radtke F. Georgiev O. Müller H.-P. Brugnera E. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2277-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) in which transcription of human MTF-1 cDNA is driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. The MTF-1 expression plasmids were transformed along with reporter plasmid pLucMRE, which contains four tandem MRE sequences inserted just upstream of a basal promoter driving transcription of firefly luciferase. To control for transfection efficiency, each transfection also included the plasmid pSVβ-galactosidase in which transcription of Escherichia coli lacZ is driven by the SV40 early promoter. When transient transfection assays were performed with the wild-type MTF-1 expression plasmid (pChMTF-1), we observed metal-induced expression of the luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 2). Treatment of transfected cells with 20 μm Zn(II) or 6 μm Cd(II) resulted in ∼2-fold and 10-fold induction of luciferase activity, respectively. Normalized levels of luciferase expression were calculated from the ratio of activities of luciferase and β-galactosidase in extracts of transfected cells. This value was arbitrarily set to 1 for the ratio obtained with the wild-type construct at a concentration of 10 ng/ml in the absence of metal treatment. To allow for quantitative comparisons between experiments performed with different constructs or with different metal treatments, at least four independent “normalization” transfections using these conditions were included in each set of assays described below. The level of luciferase expression detected under these conditions is many-fold over the background (see below). Interestingly, we observed increased levels of metal responsiveness if the cells were cultured briefly (18-24 h) using medium that had been treated to remove contaminating heavy metals (see “Experimental Procedures”). Presumably, this depletes endogenous stores of zinc (43Suhy D.A. Simon K.D. Linzer D.I.H. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9183-9192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and possibly other metals. All of the dko7 cell transfections were performed in this manner. We performed several controls for the transient transfection assays. Metal induction was dependent on the presence of the MTF-1 cDNA in the expression plasmid as well as on the presence of MRE sequences in the reporter, and luciferase expression increased in a dose-dependent fashion as the amount of pChMTF-1 was increased (data not shown). Although cysteine-to-alanine substitutions at residues 632, 653, and 696 had no effect on MTF-1 function, both basal and metal-induced luciferase expression were markedly decreased in transfections with plasmids containing cDNAs encoding the C632A/C634A and Δ(632-644) variants (Fig. 2). With the possible exception of the moderate induction (approximately 2-fold) by Cd(II) with the C632A/C634A variant, metal induction is largely lost. Transfections with constructs containing coding sequences for the two human Drosophila chimeric proteins also resulted in very low levels of luciferase expression, similar to that of the parent Δ(632-644) construct in which the Drosophila sequences were inserted. Interestingly, the Δ(632-644)+dMTF-(547-559) construct while mediating low absolute levels of expression did appear to mediate 2- to 3-fold induction by Zn(II) and Cd(II). Expression and Metal-induced Nuclear Translocation of MTF-1 Derivatives—In the absence of inducing metals, MTF-1 is localized primarily in the cytosol of cells and metal treatment leads to rapid nuclear translocation (23Saydam N.

To facilitate immunological detection of our MTF-1 derivatives, we constructed expression plasmids for MTF-1 proteins that included a C-terminal 10 amino acid extension derived from c-Myc. This c-Myc tag provided an epitope for recognition of the fusion proteins by a highly specific anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody directed against the 10 residue peptide. Luciferase expression levels mediated by MTF-1 and c-Myc-MTF-1 in transfections performed under the conditions used in the experiments in Fig. 2 were essentially identical (data not shown). To assess nuclear localization, transient transfections were performed with the c-Myc-MTF-1 expression plasmids and extracts of cytosolic and nuclear proteins were prepared, fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and subjected to immunoblot analysis with the anti-c-Myc antibody (Fig. 3A). In the absence of metal treatment, proteins with the mobility expected for MTF-1 (≈100 kDa) (28LaRochelle O. Stewart G. Moffatt P. Tremblay V. Seguin C. Biochem.

We have previously shown that the central region of perilipin A targets and anchors it to lipid droplets, at least in part via three moderately hydrophobic sequences that embed the protein into the hydrophobic core of the droplet. The current study examines the roles of the amino and carboxyl termini of perilipin A in facilitating triacylglycerol storage. Amino- and carboxyl-terminal truncation mutations of mouse perilipin A were stably expressed in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, which lack perilipins. Triacylglycerol content of the cells was quantified as a measure of perilipin function and was compared with that of cells expressing full-length perilipin A or control cells lacking perilipins. The amino-terminal sequence between amino acids 122 and 222, including four 10-11-amino acid sequences predicted to form amphipathic β-strands and a consensus site for cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and the carboxyl terminus of 112 amino acids that is unique to perilipin A were critical to facilitate triacylglycerol storage. The precocious expression of full-length perilipin A in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes aided more rapid storage of triacylglycerol during adipose differentiation. By contrast, the expression of highly truncated amino- or carboxyl-terminal mutations of perilipin failed to serve a dominant negative function in lowering triacylglycerol storage during adipose differentiation.

We conclude that the amino and carboxyl termini are critical to the function of perilipin A in facilitating triacylglycerol storage. Triacylglycerols packaged within the lipid droplets of adipocytes provide the most abundant form of stored energy in the body. Lipid droplets are spherical structures composed of a core of neutral lipids coated by a phospholipid monolayer into which specific proteins are embedded. The study of lipid droplet-associated proteins is an emerging field of inquiry. Only a few of the component proteins have been identified, and little is known about the structural properties that define lipid droplet-associated proteins and facilitate their functions in lipid metabolism. The aim of the current study is to begin to define functional domains of perilipins, the first identified mammalian lipid droplet-associated proteins. Perilipins coating the surfaces of adipocyte lipid droplets serve as gatekeeper proteins controlling both the storage and release of triacylglycerol. The translation of alternatively spliced mRNAs produces three protein isoforms of perilipin: perilipins A, B, and C (1Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Moos Jr., M.C. Londos C. Kimmel A.R. Proc.

Both the storage and hydrolysis of triacylglycerols in adipocyte lipid droplets are highly regulated processes. Under basal conditions, when the body is in the fed state, perilipin A of adipocytes is minimally phosphorylated and functions to reduce the access of cytosolic lipases to stored triacylglycerols (4Brasaemle D.L.

In support of this mechanism, the ectopic expression of perilipin A in fibroblasts leads to increased storage of triacylglycerols in lipid droplets relative to that of control cells lacking perilipins, through decreased rates of lipolysis (4Brasaemle D.L.

When energy production is required, systemic catecholamine levels increase, enabling activation of β-adrenergic receptors on the adipocyte plasma membrane. β-Adrenergic receptor activation triggers a signaling cascade that activates adenylyl cyclase and subsequently cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). 1The abbreviations used are: PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PAT, perilipin, adipophilin, and TIP47 family of structurally related lipid droplet-associated proteins; HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; AFABP, adipocyte fatty acid binding protein; TAG, triacylglycerol.

Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is both an abundant intracellular triacylglycerol lipase in adipocytes and a substrate for PKA; the phosphorylation of PKA sites in HSL triggers the translocation of the lipase from the cytosol to the surfaces of lipid droplets (11Sztalryd C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 5011-5015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) where lipolysis then occurs. A recent study has found that the presence of perilipins on the surfaces of lipid droplets is required to dock HSL onto lipid droplets (11Sztalryd C. Xu G. Dorward H. Tansey J.T. Contreras J.A. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1093-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that perilipins may be HSL-binding proteins. Furthermore, mutagenesis of the three amino-terminal PKA site serines of perilipin A to alanines interfered with the docking of HSL on perilipin-coated lipid droplets (11Sztalryd C. Xu G. Dorward H. Tansey J.T. Contreras J.A. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1093-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), implying a role for perilipin phosphorylation in lipase docking. Therefore, the structure of perilipin A likely includes a sequence or domain that binds lipases, as well as sequences or domains that shield stored triacylglycerols from lipases. The structure of lipid droplets with a hydrophobic rather than aqueous core surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer necessitates that perilipins and related proteins possess structural motifs and properties that have not yet been characterized in proteins integral to membranous compartments of the cell. We have recently demonstrated that the sequence contained within the central 25% of the primary amino acid sequence of perilipin A, which includes three moderately hydrophobic stretches surrounding an acidic region, is required to target and anchor perilipins to lipid droplets (15Garcia A. Sekowski A. Subramanian V. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 625-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Therefore, the hydrophobic amino acid sequences within the central domain of perilipin A are most likely embedded into the lipid droplet core, while the more highly charged amino and carboxyl termini are most likely oriented away from the surface of the lipid droplet and folded into functional domains. We hypothesize that the amino and carboxyl termini are critical to perilipin function in modulating rates of both basal and stimulated lipolysis. In the current study, we have tested this hypothesis by stably expressing amino- and carboxyl-terminal truncation mutations of perilipin A in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and quantifying triacylglycerol content of the cells as a test of perilipin function under basal, or non-stimulated, conditions. During the differentiation of cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the expression of perilipin A begins between 48 and 72 h after the initiation of differentiation by the addition of dexamethasone, isobutylmethylxanthine, and insulin to the culture media of confluent monolayers of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (16Brasaemle D.L. Barber T. Wolins N.E. Serrero G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2249-2263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of HSL is initiated at approximately the same time (17Cornelius P. MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 99-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), leading to an increase in cytosolic lipase activity concomitant with increased expression of the proteins that facilitate glucose and fatty acid uptake, transport, and metabolism and the enzymes that catalyze triacylglycerol synthesis (17Cornelius P. MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 99-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Thus, the timing of the initiation of perilipin expression is critical to facilitate triacylglycerol storage in an increasingly lipolytic environment. To study the effects of precocious expression of full-length perilipin A on triacylglycerol accumulation during adipocyte differentiation, confluent monolayers of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes stably expressing ectopic perilipin A were induced to differentiate, and the triacylglycerol content of the cells was compared with that of control cells lacking ectopic perilipins. Finally, a comparable experiment tested potential dominant negative effects of perilipins truncated at either the amino or carboxyl terminus on triacylglycerol accumulation during adipose differentiation.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9378-9387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Triacylglycerol content was expressed either on a per 100-mm dish basis or relative to total cellular protein content measured by the bicinchoninic acid method (21Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and differentiating 3T3-L1 adipocytes using RNeasy minicolumns (Qiagen) according to the protocols of the manufacturer. RNA was separated electrophoretically in 1% agarose gels using NorthernMax™-Gly reagents (Ambion, Inc.) RNA was transferred electrophoretically to MagnaCharge nylon membranes (Osmonics), and the membranes were probed with 32P-labeled cDNA probes for perilipins, HSL, adipose fatty acid-binding protein (AFABP), and 18 S rRNA. Expression of Truncation Mutations of Perilipin A in Cells—The schematic diagram of perilipin A depicted in Fig. 1 indicates the putative structural motifs encoded by the amino acid sequence and the sites of truncation relative to those motifs (summarized in Table I). A conserved sequence of 105 amino acids at the amino terminus of perilipin A (amino acids 17-121) is highly similar to amino-terminal sequences in the related lipid droplet-associated proteins adipophilin (32% identical, 65% similar) and TIP47 (38% identical, 60% similar) (1Greenberg A.S.

To test whether this conserved domain plays a role in the protection of stored triacylglycerols from soluble lipases, we prepared mutated perilipins with truncations at five sites within this region by removing the sequences encoding the first 33, 54, 81, 91, and 121 amino acids corresponding to mutations named N1-N5; removal of the first 81 amino acids (mutation N3) deletes the first consensus PKA site, while removal of the first 121 amino acids (N5) deletes the entire highly conserved domain. An additional truncation mutation, N6, removed the first 182 amino acids including all 5 of the 10-11 amino acid sequences predicted to form amphipathic β-strands (23Londos C. Brasaemle D.L. Schultz C.J. Segrest J.P. Kimmel A.R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), and mutation N7 removed the first 222 amino acids including the second PKA consensus site. Truncation mutation N8 lacks an additional 10 amino acids. The names of these truncation mutations do not correspond to our earlier report that described sequences involved in targeting perilipin A to lipid droplets (15Garcia A. Sekowski A. Subramanian V. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 625-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar); mutation N3 from the current study corresponds to N1 of the previous study, while current mutations N5, N6, N7, and N8, correspond to mutations N2, N3, N4, and N5 of the previous study, respectively.Table ISummary of perilipin truncation mutationsName of the constructAmino acids expressedFull-length1-517N134-517N255-517N382-517N492-517N5122-517N6183-517N7223-517N8233-517C11-489C21-429C31-405C41-364C51-324 Open table in a new tab Carboxyl-terminal truncation mutations removed the final 28 amino acids including PKA consensus sites 5 and 6 (C1); the last 88 amino acids including PKA consensus sites 4, 5, and 6 (C2); the last 112 amino acids including the entire perilipin A-specific carboxyl terminus (C3); and the last 153 amino acids including all of the carboxyl terminus following the third hydrophobic sequence (C4) (Table I and Fig. 1) that embeds perilipins into lipid droplets 2V. Subramanian, A. Garcia, A. Sekowski, and D. L. Brasaemle, unpublished results. (15Garcia A. Sekowski A. Subramanian V. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 625-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Carboxyl-terminal truncation mutation C5 removes the entire 193 amino acid carboxyl terminus following the central acidic motif. The names of the first four of these carboxyl-terminal truncation mutations correspond to the names of perilipin mutations in our earlier report on perilipin sequences that serve as lipid droplet-targeting motifs; however, current perilipin mutation C5 was named mutation C6 in that study (15Garcia A. Sekowski A. Subramanian V. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 625-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The 13 amino- and carboxyl-terminal truncation mutations of perilipin A described in the current study all targeted to lipid droplets when expressed in cultured 3T3-L1 preadipocytes; a previous study showed data for ten of these constructs (15Garcia A. Sekowski A. Subramanian V. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 625-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The three forms of mutated perilipin that were not included in the previous report include N1 and N2, which have deletions in shorter amino-terminal sequences than those previously reported, and N4, which has a truncation of an intermediate length to those previously reported. The targeting of these additional forms of mutated perilipin to lipid droplets was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy experiments (not shown) and immunoblotting of proteins from lipid droplet fractions. Fig. 2 depicts immunoblots of the lipid droplet fractions from 3T3-L1 preadipocytes stably expressing the eleven forms of mutated perilipins that are further characterized in Fig. 3; all 11 forms of truncated perilipins were detected in lipid droplet fractions. Prior to harvesting lipid droplets from cells stably expressing the mutated perilipins, the cells were incubated for 24 h with oleic acid complexed to albumin to increase triacylglycerol synthesis and storage and concomitantly stabilize the ectopic perilipins (19Brasaemle D.L. Barber T. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9378-9387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), thus increasing perilipin content. Although lipid loading of cells increased the cellular content of the most highly truncated forms of perilipins (N6, N7, C3, C4) to a modest extent, neither the protein levels of these mutated perilipins nor the triacylglycerol content increased during lipid loading to the extent observed in cells expressing longer forms of perilipins. Nonetheless, our previous studies have shown that truncated forms of perilipins are efficiently translated (15Garcia A. Sekowski A. Subramanian V. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 625-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and that the protein levels of ectopic perilipins are driven by the capacity of cells to synthesize triacylglycerols that stabilize perilipins (19Brasaemle D.L. Barber T. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9378-9387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and hence are not limited by efficiency of the retroviral expression system. Thus, these highly truncated perilipins may lack the structural motifs required for triacylglycerol-mediated stabilization of the protein.Fig. 3Triacylglycerol content of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes stably expressing full-length perilipin A or truncation mutations of perilipin.

This effect was potentiated by the simultaneous addition of the glutathione (GSH) synthesis inhibitor dl-buthionine-(R,S)-sulfoximine or the protein kinase C activators 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and bryostatin 1. In addition TPA decreased the intracellular GSH content, caused ERK activation, and potentiated the As2O3-provoked activation of p38 and JNK. The addition of N-acetyl-l-cysteine, the PKC inhibitor GF109203X, and the MEK/ERK inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 attenuated both apoptosis induction and GSH decrease, whereas the p38 inhibitor SB203580 and the JNK inhibitor SP600125 were ineffective. TPA also potentiated ERK activation and GSH depletion when added simultaneously to cadmium chloride (CdCl2) and doxorubicin. However, TPA only enhanced apoptosis in the case of CdCl2, which is a GSH-sensitive agent, whereas it reduced the toxicity of doxorubicin and other DNA-specific drugs. Finally, preincubation for 14-24 h with TPA did not potentiate but, instead, attenuated the As2O3- and CdCl2-provoked apoptosis. The same result was obtained by preincubation with bryostatin 1 and other differentiation inducers. It is concluded that TPA increases the apoptotic action of As2O3, an effect mediated by ERK activation and GSH depletion.

However, the increase in apoptosis is only effective in non-differentiated cells. Arsenic is a widespread environmental contaminant with mutagenic, teratogenic, and carcinogenic effects (1Léonard A. Merian E. Metals and Their Compounds in the Environment. Occurrence, Analysis, and Biological Relevance. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1991: 751-774Google Scholar). Despite this, arsenicals have been used for many years as therapeutic agents. In particular, arsenic trioxide (As2O3) has recently attracted great attention because of its capacity to cause complete remission of newly diagnosed and relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia. In fact, at physiologically tolerable concentrations (<5 μm in plasma), As2O3 readily destroys acute promyelocytic leukemia cells by apoptosis, with a mechanism that involves the degradation of the promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptorα fusion oncoprotein, generally expressed in this type of leukemia (2Miller W Jr., H. Schipper H.M. Lee J.S. Singer J. Waxman S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3893-3903Google Scholar). Moreover, albeit with lower efficacy, this agent causes apoptosis in other cell types, indicating that it may also be useful for the treatment of other malignancies (2Miller W Jr., H. Schipper H.M. Lee J.S. Singer J. Waxman S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3893-3903Google Scholar, 3Murgo A.J. Oncologist. 2001; 6: 22-28Google Scholar, 4Wang Z.Y. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 2001; 48: 72-76Google Scholar). For this reason it is of great interest to analyze the molecular mechanisms responsible for cell death induction by arsenic along with the factors that may modulate (either potentiating or reducing) its toxicity. One of the most relevant aspects in the regulation of cell death is the signaling of apoptosis by serine/threonine kinases, a broad category of kinases that includes among others the calcium-dependent protein kinases (PKCs) 1The abbreviations used are: PKCcalcium-dependent protein kinaseAc-DEVD-pNAN-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-nitroanilineBSOdl-buthionine-R,S-sulfoximineERKextracellular signal-regulated protein kinaseGSHreduced glutathioneMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseNACN-acetyl-l-cysteineTPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetateVD31α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3Z-VAD-Fmkbenzyloxy-carbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketoneMEKmitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinaseJNKc-Jun NH2-terminal kinase. and the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (5Cross T.G.

Cell Res. 2000; 256: 34-41Google Scholar). 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) is a powerful PKC activator that has been commonly reported to inhibit the generation of apoptosis by receptor activation (6Sarker M.

Sakata K. Takekawa M. Endo T. Imai K. Hareyama M. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 963-971Google Scholar). Nevertheless, this phorbol ester has occasionally been observed to potentiate apoptosis induction (14Jun C.D. Pae H.O. Kwak H.J. Yoo J.C. Choi B.M. Oh C.D. Chun J.S. Paik S.G. Park Y.H. Chung H.T. Cell. Immunol. 1999; 194: 36-46Google Scholar, 15Cartee L. Smith R. Dai Y. Rahmani M. Rosato R. Almenara J. Dent P. Grant S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 1313-1321Google Scholar). Among the three main members that integrate the MAPK family in mammalian cells, the stress-activated protein kinase 1 (c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs)) and stress-activated protein kinase 2 (p38) are generally associated to apoptosis induction. By contrast, the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK1/2, p44/42) are generally associated to mitogenesis and as such inversely related to apoptosis (5Cross T.G. Scheel-Toellner D. Henriquez N.V. Deacon E. Salmon M. Lord J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 34-41Google Scholar). However, there are also some cases in which the ERKs may exert a pro-apoptotic action (16Kummer J.L. Rao P.K. Heidenreich K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20490-20494Google Scholar, 17Bhat N.R. Zhang P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 112-119Google Scholar, 18Wang X. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol.

For instance, PKC activates the MEK/ERK pathway via Raf-1 phosphorylation (20Carroll M.P. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1249-1256Google Scholar, 21Marquardt B. Frith D. Stabel S. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3213-3218Google Scholar), which might account at least in part for the capacity of TPA and other PKC activators to modulate apoptosis. calcium-dependent protein kinase N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-nitroaniline dl-buthionine-R,S-sulfoximine extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase reduced glutathione mitogen-activated protein kinase N-acetyl-l-cysteine 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 benzyloxy-carbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase. Some authors have recently examined the capacity of TPA to modulate the toxicity of As2O3 in human myeloid cells, with non-coincident results. For instance, Sordet et al. (22Sordet O. Rébé C. Leroy I. Bruey J.M. Garrido C. Miguet C. Lizard G. Plenchette S. Corcos L. Solary E. Blood. 2001; 97: 3931-3940Google Scholar) indicate that TPA-differentiated cells exhibited an increased susceptibility to apoptosis induction by As2O3, which was associated to a decrease in reduced glutathione (GSH) intracellular content and to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. However, other authors indicate that the phorbol ester did not affect (23Huang X.J. Wiernick P.H. Klein R.S. Gallagher R.E. Med. Oncol. 1999; 16: 58-64Google Scholar) or even reduce (24Iwama K. Nakajo S. Aiuchi T. Nakaya K. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 92: 518-526Google Scholar) the generation of apoptosis by As2O3. These discrepancies led us to examine the capacity of TPA and some related compounds to modulate the apoptotic action of As2O3 and other cytotoxic agents in U-937 promonocytic leukemia cells using different experimental conditions. The obtained results indicated that the generation of apoptosis by the GSH-sensitive agents As2O3 is potentiated by the simultaneous addition of TPA or bryostatin 1. The increase in apoptosis is mediated by ERK activation and seems to be a consequence, at least in part, of GSH depletion. However, after a prolonged preincubation TPA does not potentiate and instead decreases the As2O3 toxicity, an effect also obtained by preincubation with other differentiation inducers. Materials—All components for cell culture were obtained from Invitrogen. Bryostatin 1 and GF109203X were obtained from Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA), cadmium chloride and sodium butyrate were from Merck, 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole was from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany), and monochlorobimane was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR).

Anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated antibody was from DAKO Diagnósticos, S. A. (Barcelona, Spain). All other reagents were from Sigma. Cells and Treatments—U-937 human promonocytic leukemia cells (25Sundström C. Nilsson K. Int. J. Cancer. 1976; 17: 565-577Google Scholar) and HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells (26Collins S. Gallo R. Gallagher R. Nature. 1977; 270: 347-349Google Scholar) were routinely grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 0.2% sodium bicarbonate and antibiotics in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. For experiments, 16 h before the initiation of the treatments the cells were seeded at either 105 (for long term treatments, 16-48 h) or 2 × 105 (for short term treatments, 1-8 h) cells/ml. Stock solutions of TPA (20 mm), bryostatin 1 (0.1 mm), etoposide (20 mm), camptothecin (10 mm), GF109203X (2.42 mm), PD98059 (20 mm), U0126 (2.63 mm), SB203580 (20 mm), SP600125 (20 mm), LY294002 (20 mm), Z-VAD-Fmk (25 mm), monochlorobimane (200 mm), Ac-DEVD-pNA (5 mm), and N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC, 3 m) were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide. A stock solution of doxorubicin (20 mm) was prepared in distilled water. A stock solution of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3, 1 mm) was prepared in ethanol. All these solutions were stored at -20 °C. Stock solutions of arsenic trioxide and cadmium chloride (100 mm) were prepared in distilled water, and stock solutions of 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (10 μg/ml) and propidium iodide (1 mg/ml) were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline. These solutions were stored at 4 °C. dl-Buthionine-R,S-sulfoximine (BSO) was dissolved in distilled water at 50 mm, and sodium butyrate was dissolved in RPMI 1640 at 100 mm just before application. Determination of Apoptosis—Distinctive characteristics of apoptotic cells were the presence of chromatin condensation/fragmentation and the acquisition of sub-G1 DNA content. To examine chromatin structure, cells were fixed with ethanol, stained with 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole, and examined by fluorescence microscopy. To measure DNA content, cells were permeabilized, stained with propidium iodide, and examined by flow cytometry. These procedures were described in detail elsewhere (27Galán A. García-Bermejo M.L. Troyano A. Vilaboa N.E. De Blas E. Kazanietz M.G. Aller P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11418-11424Google Scholar). Measurement of Caspase-3 Activity—Samples of 4 × 106 cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 50 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.03% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5), kept on ice for 30 min, and finally centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Samples containing aliquots of the supernatants (corresponding to 10 μg of total protein), 8 μl of Ac-DEVD-pNA, and phosphate-buffered saline to complete 200 μl were prepared in triplicate in 96-well microtiter plates and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The absorption was measured by spectrophotometry at 405 nm. Determination of Cell Differentiation—Cell differentiation was assessed by measuring the surface expression of CD11b/CD18 and CD11c/CD18 leukocyte integrins. With this aim indirect immunofluorescence assays were carried out using the Bear 1 (anti-CD11b) and HC1/1 (anti-CD11c) monoclonal antibodies in combination with flow cytometry following the previously described procedure (28Rius C. Cabañas C. Aller P. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 188: 129-134Google Scholar). Measurement of GSH Levels—The total cellular GSH content was determined by fluorometry after cell loading with monochlorobimane following the previously described procedure (29Troyano A. Fernández C. Sancho P. De Blas E. Aller P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47107-47115Google Scholar). Immunoblot Assays—To obtain total cellular protein extracts cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed by 5 min of heating at 100 °C followed by sonication in Laemmli buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. The extracts were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted onto membranes, and immunodetected as previously described (27Galán A. García-Bermejo M.L. Troyano A. Vilaboa N.E. De Blas E. Kazanietz M.G. Aller P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11418-11424Google Scholar). Apoptosis Induction—Fig. 1 shows the capacity of TPA and As2O3, alone and in combination to induce the expression of apoptotic markers in human myeloid cells. As2O3 caused a concentration-dependent (Fig. 1A) and time-dependent (Fig. 1B) increase in the frequency of U-937 promonocytic cells with fragmented chromatin, which is characteristic of apoptosis. TPA (20 nm) was almost innocuous in itself (∼8% of apoptotic cells at 24 h of treatment versus 4% in untreated cells) but greatly potentiated the apoptotic action of As2O3 when both agents were simultaneously applied. The potentiation by TPA of the As2O3-provoked cell death was confirmed by measuring the frequency of cells with a decreased (sub-G1) DNA content, which is also an indicator of apoptosis (Fig. 1C), and was further corroborated by measuring the stimulation of caspase-3 activity (Fig. 2A) and the capacity of the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-Fmk to inhibit cell death (Fig. 2B). TPA also potentiated the As2O3-provoked apoptosis in HL-60 human promyelocytic cells (Fig. 1D), showing that the phenomenon is not restricted to the U-937 cell line. On the basis of the results here obtained, the concentration of 4 μm As2O3 was adopted for further experiments except when otherwise indicated.Fig. 2Stimulation of caspase-3 activity and effect of caspase inhibition.A, extracts from untreated U-937 cell cultures (Cont) and cultures treated for the indicated time periods with As2O3 alone or with TPA were used to determine the caspase-3 activity using as substrate Ac-DEVD-pNA. The results are represented in relation to untreated cells (Cont), which was given the arbitrary value of one. B, frequency of apoptosis in U-937 cell cultures treated for 24 h with As2O3 alone or with TPA either in the absence (-) or the presence of 50 μm Z-VADFMK (+Z-VAD). As2O3 was used at 4 μm. All other conditions were as in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) TPA is a potent PKC activator as well as a differentiation inducer of myeloid cells. For this reason we found it of interest to examine whether the generation of apoptosis by arsenic could be altered by the simultaneous administration of 10 nm VD3 or 0.75 mm sodium butyrate, which in our experiments induced myeloid cell differentiation (28Rius C.

Dev. 1989; 28: 39-46Google Scholar), or 10 nm bryostatin 1, which is a PKC activator (albeit with different isoform specificity than TPA) (31Kraft A.S. Smith J.B. Berkow R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1334-1338Google Scholar) and differentiation inducer (32Vrana J.A. Sauders A.M. Chellappan S.P. Grant S. Differentiation. 1998; 63: 33-42Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 3 indicate that bryostatin 1 potentiated the As2O3-provoked apoptosis, but VD3 and sodium butyrate were ineffective. This indicates that the stimulatory action of TPA on apoptosis is not related with differentiation induction. MAPK Activation—As indicated above PKC activation may in turn activate the ERK pathway. For this reason, immunoblot assays were carried out to determine the activation of ERK1/2, as measured by their increased phosphorylation, in cells treated with As2O3 and TPA either alone or in combination. It was found that arsenic alone did not significantly cause ERK activation (Fig. 4B), whereas this kinase was greatly activated by TPA alone (Fig. 4A) and by the combination of As2O3 plus TPA (Fig. 4B). The activation was already observed at 1 h of treatment and still persisted at 24 h. To analyze whether there is a cause-effect relationship between ERK activation and potentiation of apoptosis by TPA we made use of appropriate pharmacological inhibitors, namely the PKC inhibitor GF109203X (33Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Google Scholar) and the MEK/ERK inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 (34Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Google Scholar, 35Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Google Scholar). Other more direct experimental approaches were not employed due to the poor efficacy of transfection of U-937 cells (result not shown). Control assays indicated that 1 μm GF109203X, 2.5 μm U0126, and 20 μm PD98059 prevented the As2O3 plus TPA-induced ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 4C), proving the efficacy of the inhibitors and confirming that PKC activation in fact precedes and regulates ERK activation. As shown in Fig. 4, D and E, the kinase inhibitors attenuated apoptosis in As2O3 plus TPA-treated cells, indicating that under these experimental conditions ERK activation effectively mediates apoptosis induction. The same result was obtained using bryostatin 1 instead of TPA (Fig. 4D). As demonstrated by kinetic assays, the kinase inhibitors were only effective when applied at the same time as TPA plus As2O3 or shortly thereafter (up to 4 h, approximately) (Fig. 4F). For comparison we also measured the behavior of p38 and JNK since these kinases may be also activated by TPA in U-937 cells (36Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16917-16923Google Scholar). As indicated in Fig. 5A, treatment with As2O3 alone induced the phosphorylation/activation of p38 and JNK, which was potentiated by TPA. The administration of 10 μm SB20358, specific for p38 (37Frantz B. Klatt T. Pang M. Parson J. Rolando A. Williams H. Tocci M.J. O'Keefe S.J. O'Neill E.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13846-13853Google Scholar), or 10 μm SP600125, specific for JNK (38Han Z. Boyle D.L. Chang L. Bennet B. Karin M. Yang L. Manning A.M. Firestein G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 73-81Google Scholar), the maximum concentrations that were non-toxic in long term treatments, reduced kinase activation (Fig. 5B) but did not attenuate apoptosis (Fig. 5C). This suggests that p38 and JNK are not primarily responsible for the potentiation by TPA of the As2O3-provoked apoptosis. Changes in GSH Content—It has been described that As2O3 is a GSH-sensitive agent, in the sense that its toxicity is enhanced after GSH depletion (39Dai B. Weinberg R.S. Waxman S. Jing Y. Blood. 1999; 93: 268-277Google Scholar, 40Cai X. Shen Y.L. Zhu Q. Jia P.M. Zhou L. Huang Y. Zhang J.W. Xiong S.M. Chen S.J. Wang Z.Y. Chen Z. Chen G.Q. Leukemia (Baltimore). 2000; 14: 262-270Google Scholar). This was corroborated by us using BSO, a specific inhibitor of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase activity, the rate-limiting enzyme for GSH biosynthesis (41Griffith O.W. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7558-7560Google Scholar). In fact BSO reduced the intracellular GSH content (Fig 6A, left panel) and enhanced the generation of apoptosis by As2O3 (Fig. 6A, right panel). In addition, it was reported that TPA-differentiated myeloid cells exhibited lower GSH content than non-differentiated cells (22Sordet O. Rébé C. Leroy I. Bruey J.M. Garrido C. Miguet C. Lizard G. Plenchette S. Corcos L. Solary E. Blood. 2001; 97: 3931-3940Google Scholar). For these reasons, we wanted to measure the alteration of GSH levels in cells treated with As2O3 and TPA alone and in combination and in the absence or the presence of the PKC and MAPK inhibitors. For comparison we also measured the GSH content in cells treated with the differentiation inducer VD3. The results, represented in Fig. 6, B-D, were as follows. (i) Treatment with 4 μm As2O3 alone (which as indicated above moderately induced apoptosis but failed to induce ERK activation) did not decrease the GSH content (Fig. 6B). (ii) Treatment with TPA alone (which as indicated above did not cause significant apoptosis but induced ERK activation) caused GSH depletion (Fig. 6B). Of note, no GSH decrease was observed in cells treated for 24-72 h with VD3 (Fig. 6B) although at 72 h of treatment the cells expressed differentiation markers (results not shown). (iii) The combination of As2O3 plus TPA (which as indicated above greatly induced apoptosis as well as ERK activation) caused a greater GSH decrease than TPA alone (Fig. 6B). (iv) The GSH depletion caused by TPA alone or by As2O3 plus TPA was attenuated by the PKC and ERK inhibitors (which as indicated above attenuated apoptosis) but was not affected by the p38 and JNK inhibitors (which also failed to prevent apoptosis) (Fig. 6C). Similar results were obtained using bryostatin 1 instead of TPA (Fig. 6C). And (v), the administration of PD98059 7 h after As2O3 plus TPA was unable to restore the GSH level (Fig. 6D), which is congruent with the above-indicated inability of the ERK inhibitor to prevent apoptosis at this time of treatment. Taken together these results indicate the existence of a strict correlation between ERK activation, GSH depletion, and potentiation of apoptosis in As2O3 plus TPA-treated cells. Moreover, they suggest that GSH depletion is not a mere consequence of cell death or differentiation induction. Finally, experiments were carried out using NAC, a GSH-increasing agent earlier employed by other authors in combination with As2O3 (39Dai B. Weinberg R.S. Waxman S. Jing Y. Blood. 1999; 93: 268-277Google Scholar, 42Hu X.M. Hirano T. Oka K. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 2003; 52: 47-58Google Scholar). We found that the administration of 10 mm NAC did not prevent ERK activation (result not shown) but restored the GSH content (Fig. 6E, left panel) and reduced apoptosis (Fig 6E, right panel) in As2O3 plus TPA-treated cells. Of note, the possibility that such attenuation of apoptosis could be due to arsenic scavenging by NAC may be ruled out since NAC did not reduce the toxicity of As2O3 plus LY294002, an inhibitor of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway that potentiated the As2O3-provoked apoptosis (Fig. 6E, right panel), and NAC also failed to prevent the As2O3-provoked activation of HSP70 expression, a stress-inducible protein (Fig. 6F). These results, which are fully consistent with earlier observations (39Dai B. Weinberg R.S. Waxman S. Jing Y. Blood. 1999; 93: 268-277Google Scholar, 42Hu X.M. Hirano T. Oka K. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 2003; 52: 47-58Google Scholar), support the existence of a cause-effect relationship between GSH depletion and potentiation of apoptosis in our experimental model. Effects of Other Cytotoxic Drugs—The preceding results strongly suggest that the potentiation of As2O3-provoked apoptosis by TPA could be the consequence, at least in part, of GSH depletion. If this was the case we could predict a similar potentiation of apoptosis when the phorbol ester is used in combination with other GSH-sensitive agents but probably not with GSH-insensitive drugs. Earlier observations indicated that GSH depletion enhanced the toxicity of the heavy metal cadmium (43Ochi T. Otsuka F. Takahashi K. Ohsawa M. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1988; 65: 1-14Google Scholar, 44Galán A. Troyano A. Vilaboa N.E. Fernández C. De Blas E. Aller P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1538: 34-86Google Scholar) but did not affect the toxicity of anti-DNA topoisomerase drugs in myeloid cells (29Troyano A. Fernández C. Sancho P. De Blas E. Aller P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47107-47115Google Scholar, 45Fernandes R.S. Cotter T.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 675-681Google Scholar). Hence, we decided to compare the effect of BSO and TPA on U-937 cells treated with cadmium chloride (CdCl2, 40 μm) and with the antitumor anti-DNA topoisomerase drugs etoposide (0.5 μm), camptothecin (50 nm), and doxorubicin (0.5 μm). As expected, BSO potentiated apoptosis in the case of CdCl2 but not in the case of the anti-topoisomerase drugs (Fig. 7A), and according to our prediction, TPA only potentiated apoptosis in the case of CdCl2 (Fig. 7B). Indeed, TPA reduced the toxicity of the anti-topoisomerase drugs (Fig. 7B), which is consistent with the commonly reported protective action of the phorbol ester (6Sarker M. Ruiz-Ruiz C. López-Rivas A. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 172-181Google Scholar, 7Herrant M. Luciano F. Loubat A. Auberger P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4957-4968Google Scholar, 8Söderson T.S. Poukkula M.

Imai K. Hareyama M. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 963-971Google Scholar). Of note, the different effect of TPA on the toxicity of CdCl2 and anti-topoisomerase drugs may not be attributed to a different behavior of ERKs or GSH. In fact, TPA potentiated ERK activation (Fig. 7C) and exacerbated GSH depletion (Fig. 7D) by both CdCl2 and doxorubicin. Moreover, GF109203X and PD98059 restored the GSH level in both CdCl2 plus TPA- and doxorubicin plus TPA-treated cells (Fig. 7D). However, although the kinase inhibitors attenuated apoptosis induction by CdCl2 plus TPA (as in the case of As2O3 plus TPA), they did not attenuate and even increased apoptosis in the case of doxorubicin plus TPA (Fig. 7E). Taken together, these results corroborate the conclusion that the unusual pro-apoptotic action of TPA and ERKs in the case of As2O3 is due to the GSH sensitivity of this agent. Effect of Preincubation with TPA—In all the preceding experiments, TPA was administered simultaneously to As2O3 or the other cytotoxic drugs. Hence, new experiments were carried out in which the cells were preincubated for different times with the phorbol ester before treatment with As2O3. Some of the obtained results are represented in Fig. 8. Preincubation with TPA for up to 6 h was still compatible with a potentiation of apoptosis. However, preincubation for 14-24 h, a treatment period that suffices to induce the expression of differentiation markers (46Rius C. Aller P. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 395-401Google Scholar, and results not shown), did not potentiate and, instead, attenuated the As2O3-provoked apoptosis (Fig. 8, A and B) and, accordingly, decreased caspase-3 activity (Fig. 8C). The decrease in apoptosis occurred despite the reduced GSH level, which remained below 40% of control value during the whole period of As2O3 treatment (result not shown). Using this experimental design, similar results were obtained when the cells were treated with CdCl2 or anti-topoisomerase drugs instead of As2O3 (Fig. 8D) or when they were preincubated for 24 h with bryostatin 1 or for 48 h with the differentiation inducers VD3 and sodium butyrate instead of TPA (Fig. 8E). The results in this work corroborate earlier observations indicating that As2O3 and CdCl2 cause death by apoptosis in myeloid leukemia cells and that the toxicity of these agents is exacerbated by GSH depletion (39Dai B. Weinberg R.S. Waxman S. Jing Y. Blood. 1999; 93: 268-277Google Scholar, 44Galán A. Troyano A. Vilaboa N.E. Fernández C. De Blas E. Aller P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1538: 34-86Google Scholar). The increase in toxicity may be manifested as an increase in the frequency of apoptosis (Refs. 39Dai B. Weinberg R.S. Waxman S. Jing Y. Blood. 1999; 93: 268-277Google Scholar and 40Cai X. Shen Y.L. Zhu Q. Jia P.M. Zhou L. Huang Y. Zhang J.W. Xiong S.M. Chen S.J. Wang Z.Y. Chen Z. Chen G.Q. Leukemia (Baltimore). 2000; 14: 262-270Google Scholar and results in this work) or even as a change in the mode of death from apoptosis to necrosis (44Galán A. Troyano A. Vilaboa N.E. Fernández C. De Blas E. Aller P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1538: 34-86Google Scholar), 2C. Fernández, A. M. Ramos, P. Sancho, D. Amrán, E. de Blas, and P. Aller, unpublished results. depending on the experimental conditions. By contrast, the toxicity of anti-DNA topoisomerase drugs was apparently insensitive to GSH depletion, a result also consistent with earlier observations in the myeloid cell model (29Troyano A. Fernández C. Sancho P. De Blas E. Aller P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47107-47115Google Scholar, 45Fernandes R.S. Cotter T.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 675-681Google Scholar). The dependence of As2O3 and CdCl2 toxicity on GSH content may be explained by the capacity of arsenic and cadmium ions to directly react with GSH (43Ochi T. Otsuka F. Takahashi K. Ohsawa M. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1988; 65: 1-14Google Scholar, 47Scott N. Hatlelid K.M. MacKenzie N.E. Carter D.E. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 102-106Google Scholar). Thus, GSH depletion may lead to a decrease in GSH-metal interactions, increasing the intracellular concentration of free arsenic and cadmium ions and, hence, their toxicity. In particular, the increase in metal ion concentration could exacerbate mitochondrial dysfunction, since it is known that arsenic and cadmium directly target the mitochondria (48Larochette N. Decaudin D. Jacotot E. Brenner C. Marzo I. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Xie Z. Reed J. Kroemer G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 249: 413-421Google Scholar, 49Belyaeva E.A. Glazunov V.V. Korotkov S.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 405: 252-264Google Scholar). In addition, GSH depletion might potentiate cell death by facilitating the accumulation of reactive oxygen species due to the reduction in glutathione peroxidase activity (50Dickinson D.A. Froman H.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 1019-1026Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the relevance of this mechanism in the present experiments is questionable, since treatment with low As2O3 concentrations did not produce a detectable increase in peroxide levels in the U-937 cell system (51Jing B.Y. Dai J. Chalmers-Redman R.M. Tatton W.G. Waxman S. Blood. 1999; 94: 2102-2111Google Scholar). 2C. Fernández, A. M. Ramos, P. Sancho, D. Amrán, E. de Blas, and P. Aller, unpublished results. As indicated above, TPA was reported to potentiate (22Sordet O. Rébé C. Leroy I. Bruey J.M. Garrido C. Miguet C. Lizard G. Plenchette S. Corcos L. Solary E. Blood. 2001; 97: 3931-3940Google Scholar) and reduce (24Iwama K. Nakajo S. Aiuchi T. Nakaya K. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 92: 518-526Google Scholar) the generation of apoptosis by As2O3 in myeloid leukemia cells. Our present results indicate that both types of response are possible, depending on the conditions of treatment. Thus, TPA potentiated apoptosis when applied simultaneously to, or shortly before As2O3 and CdCl2 but decreased apoptosis after a prolonged (14-24 h) incubation period. This contrasts with the response of anti-topoisomerase drugs, the toxicity of which was always reduced by TPA independently of the conditions of treatment. The potentiation of As2O3 toxicity by TPA was mediated by PKC activation, since the same result was obtained using bryostatin 1 instead of TPA, and apoptosis was attenuated by the PKC inhibitor GF109203X. The action of PKC was in turn mediated by ERK activation, since GF109203X prevented the TPA plus As2O3-provoked ERK phosphorylation, and the potentiation of apoptosis by TPA or bryostatin 1 was reduced by the ERK inhibitors U0126 and PD98059. This infrequent pro-apoptotic effect of ERKs, normally considered as a survival-inducing kinase, contrasts with the apparent irrelevance of p38 and JNK, normally considered as pro-apoptotic kinases. In fact, TPA potentiated the activation p38 and JNK, but SB203580 and SP600125 failed to reduce the TPA plus As2O3-provoked apoptosis. Concerning the reduction of As2O3 and CdCl2 toxicity after a prolonged preincubation with TPA, we may reasonably suppose that this is a consequence of differentiation. In fact, U-937 cells treated with TPA for 14-24 h already express differentiation markers, and the toxicity of As2O3 was also decreased by preincubation with other differentiation inducers, namely bryostatin 1, sodium butyrate, and VD3. The resistance of differentiated myeloid cells to apoptosis induction by diverse cytotoxic agents has been also documented by other authors (11Sordet O. Bettaieb A. Bruey J.M. Eymin B. Droin N. Ivarsson M. Garrido C. Solary E. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 351-361Google Scholar, 52Solary E. Bertrand R. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Blood. 1993; 81: 1359-1368Google Scholar, 53Xu H.M. Tepper C.G. Jones J.B. Fernandez C.E. Studzinski G.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 369-374Google Scholar, 54Shiiki K. Yoshikawa H. Kinoshita H. Takeda M. Ueno A. Nakajima Y. Tasaka K. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 939-940Google Scholar). Because differentiation and apoptosis are alternative, mutually excluding pathways (55Hass R. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1994; 5: 359-371Google Scholar), a restraint in apoptosis may be expected once the differentiation program has been executed. Finally, the present results indicate that GSH depletion is a key factor linking ERK activation and potentiation of apoptosis in As2O3 plus TPA-treated cells. This conclusion is supported by the concurrence of multiple evidences. In fact (i) TPA-mediated ERK activation always correlated with GSH decrease (Fig. 4, A and B, versusFig. 6B and Fig. 7, C versus D) no matter the effect of TPA on apoptosis, and the administration of ERK inhibitors restored the GSH content (Figs. 6C and 7D). Moreover, treatment with As2O3 alone did not cause ERK activation nor GSH decrease (Fig. 4BversusFig. 6B). (ii) The apoptotic action of As2O3 was potentiated after GSH depletion by BSO and TPA, and this potentiation was abrogated when the GSH level was restored by NAC (Fig. 6). (iii) Treatment with TPA alone caused GSH decrease without significant apoptosis (Fig. 6BversusFig. 1), indicating that GSH depletion is not a mere consequence of cell death in this type of experiment. And (iv) finally, TPA-mediated ERK activation and GSH depletion correlated with apoptosis increase only in the case of GSH-sensitive agents such as As2O3 and CdCl2. By contrast, TPA and ERKs played their canonical, anti-apoptotic role when used with GSH-insensitive, anti-DNA topoisomerase drugs (Fig. 7). Hence, we may reasonably conclude that ERK activation leads to GSH depletion, which in turn accounts at least in part for the increased apoptosis in TPA plus As2O3-treated cells. Experiments are in course to determine the mechanism(s) responsible for GSH depletion, i.e. synthesis inhibition or accelerated loss. In addition, it remains to be investigated whether the conclusions here obtained may be extended to other antitumor drugs, e.g. cisplatin, a GSH-sensitive drug (29Troyano A. Fernández C. Sancho P. De Blas E. Aller P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47107-47115Google Scholar), the toxicity of which may be potentiated by ERK activation (18Wang X. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39435-39443Google Scholar)."

Occasionally, the RAG proteins mediate two other alternative DNA rearrangements in vivo: the rejoining of signal and coding ends and the transposition of signal ends into unrelated DNA. In contrast, truncated, catalytically active “core” RAG proteins readily catalyze these reactions in vitro, suggesting that full-length RAG proteins directly or indirectly suppress these undesired reactions in vivo. To discriminate between direct and indirect suppression models, full-length RAG proteins were purified and characterized in vitro. From mammalian cells, full-length RAG-1 is readily purified with core RAG-2 but not full-length RAG-2 and vice versa. Despite differences in DNA binding activity, recombinase containing either core or full-length RAG-1 or RAG-2 possess comparable cleavage, rejoining, and end-processing activity, as well as similar usage preferences for canonical versus cryptic recombination signals. However, recombinase containing full-length RAG-2, but not full-length RAG-1, exhibits dramatically reduced transposition activity in vitro. These data suggest RAG-mediated transposition and rejoining are differentially regulated by the full-length RAG proteins in vivo (the former directly by RAG-2 and the latter indirectly through other factors) and argue that noncore portions of the RAG proteins have little or no direct influence over V(D)J recombinase site specificity.

In the first phase, two lymphoid cell-specific proteins, RAG-1 and RAG-2, collaborate to organize two discrete recombination signal sequences (RSS) abutting different receptor coding segments into a synaptic complex. Both RSSs in the synaptic complex contain conserved heptamer and nonamer elements, but the spacing between these elements in the two RSSs is typically different: in one RSS, the separation is 12 bp, whereas in the other, it is 23 bp. Within the synaptic complex, the RAG proteins coordinately introduce DNA double-strand breaks at both RSSs, positioned between the heptamer and adjacent coding sequence. The cleavage reaction generates two distinct DNA intermediates: blunt 5′-phosphorylated signal ends and coding ends terminating in covalently sealed DNA hairpin structures (4Roth D.B. Zhu C.

Broken DNA intermediates are generated in two biochemical steps: first strand nicking at the 5′ end of the heptamer, followed by a direct transesterification reaction in which the 3′-OH exposed in the nicking step attacks the phosphodiester on the antiparallel DNA strand (7McBlane J.F. van Gent D.C.

In the second phase of V(D)J recombination, signal ends are generally ligated to form precise signal joints, but coding ends are frequently processed and joined to create imprecise coding joints.

Coding joint formation additionally requires the activity of Artemis and DNA-PKcs, which collaborate in the resolution of hairpinned coding ends (9Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R.

As full-length RAG proteins were found difficult to purify due to insolubility, cell-free assays of RAG activity were established by using truncated and catalytically active core regions of RAG-1 and RAG-2 (3Gellert M.

These core regions represent the minimal portions of RAG-1 and RAG-2 necessary to support rearrangement of exogenous and integrated substrates in cell culture assays of V(D)J recombination (11Sadofsky M.J.

Besides catalyzing the reactions that generate classical V(D)J recombination intermediates, the core RAG proteins have been shown to catalyze other DNA strand cleavage and strand transfer reactions in vitro, including the nicking of DNA hairpins (16Besmer E.

Gellert M. van Gent D.C. Science. 1998; 280: 301-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), a mechanistically related reaction in which signal ends are inserted into unrelated DNA via transposition (20Agrawal A.

Gellert M. Cell. 2000; 101: 625-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Since the core RAG proteins readily catalyze rejoining and transposition in vitro, one might expect that these events would frequently be observed in vivo. Interestingly, although evidence for their occurrence in vivo has been reported (23Morzycka-Wroblewska E. Lee F.E. Desiderio S.V. Science. 1988; 242: 261-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 24Messier T.L. O'Neill J.P. Hou S.M. Nicklas J.A.

Cell. 1988; 55: 1099-1107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), they are nevertheless quite rare (especially transposition), raising the possibility that the regions of RAG-dispensable for V(D)J recombination play a central role in suppressing these unwanted DNA rearrangements. Consistent with this hypothesis, full-length RAGs support significantly less HJ formation than core RAGs in V(D)J recombination assays performed in NHEJ-deficient cells (26Sekiguchi J.A. Whitlow S. Alt F.W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1383-1390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and accumulate signal ends to 10-fold lower levels than their core counterparts without affecting the level of coding ends produced (27Steen S.B. Han J.O. Mundy C. Oettinger M.A. Roth D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3010-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results provide evidence that full-length RAG post-cleavage complexes are rapidly disassembled in vivo, thereby imposing a limited window of opportunity for HJ formation and transposition to occur (27Steen S.B. Han J.O. Mundy C. Oettinger M.A. Roth D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3010-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Whether post-cleavage complex disassembly is the only mechanism to avoid these unwanted reactions, or whether the full-length RAG proteins provide an additional level of protection by suppressing them directly remains unclear. In addition to accumulating HJs and signal ends in vivo, the core RAG proteins exhibit a modest reduction in recombination activity relative to full-length RAGs (11Sadofsky M.J. Hesse J.E. McBlane J.F. Gellert M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5644-5650Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 12Sadofsky M.J. Hesse J.E. Gellert M.

Sudarsanam P. Oettinger M.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Moreover, core RAG proteins exhibit defects in targeting specific antigen receptor loci relative to full-length RAG proteins (28Kirch S.A. Rathbun G.A. Oettinger M.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4881-4886Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 29Liang H.E. Hsu L.Y. Cado D. Cowell L.G. Kelsoe G. Schlissel M.S.

Hartwig N.G. de Groot R. van Gent D.C. van Dongen J.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 203-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In principle, the recombination defects associated with core RAG proteins in vivo may be manifested at either the cleavage or joining phase of V(D)J recombination, and may be attributed to impaired or altered DNA binding or cleavage activity of the recombinase itself, loss of potential targets of post-translational modification, or modified association with protein factors involved in regulating V(D)J recombinase activity, its interaction with DNA targets, or the repair of its cleavage products. Defining the molecular mechanisms by which the dispensable regions of the RAG proteins modulate the activity of the core recombinase would be greatly facilitated by obtaining full-length RAG proteins for study in vitro. We report here that, when fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP), full-length RAG-1 is readily purified when coexpressed in mammalian cells with core MBP-RAG-2 but not full-length MBP-RAG-2 and vice versa. All-core recombinase and recombinase containing either full-length RAG-1 or full-length RAG-2 exhibit some differences in DNA binding activity, yet when normalized for these differences, they possess comparable cleavage, rejoining, and end-processing activity, as well as similar usage preferences for canonical versus cryptic recombination signals. However, recombinase containing full-length RAG-2, but not full-length RAG-1, exhibits dramatically reduced transposition activity in vitro. These data suggest RAG-mediated transposition and rejoining are differentially regulated by the full-length RAG proteins in vivo (the former directly by RAG-2, the latter indirectly through other factors), and argue that non-core portions of the RAG proteins have little or no direct influence over V(D)J recombinase site specificity. Expression Vectors—Eukaryotic expression constructs encoding core RAG-1 or core RAG-2, each fused at the amino terminus to MBP without additional sequence tags (pcMR1 and pcMR2, respectively), have been described previously (32Swanson P.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7790-7801Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Versions of these constructs encoding either full-length MBP-RAG-1 (pcMR1FL) or full-length MBP-RAG-2 (pcMR2FL) were assembled by PCR and/or subcloning by using pcRAG1 or pcRAG2 as a source for non-core RAG sequences (33Lin W.C. Desiderio S. Science. 1993; 260: 953-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The prokaryotic expression construct pET11d-hHMG-1 has been described elsewhere (34Ge H. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17136-17140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fusion proteins used in this study are depicted in Fig. 1. Cell Culture, Protein Expression, and Purification—The 293 human embryonic kidney cell line was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics and maintained under standard humidified conditions (37 °C and 5% CO2). RAG-1 and RAG-2 fusion proteins were coexpressed in 293 cells using a polyethyleneimine (PEI) transfection protocol modified slightly from Durocher et al. (35Durocher Y. Perret S. Kamen A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: E9Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Three hours before transfection, 10 ml of fresh medium was added to each 10-cm dish of 293 cells (∼2 × 106 cells/dish). To a mixture containing pcMR1 or pcMR1FL and pcMR2 or pcMR2FL (5 μg of each, in pairwise combinations) in 0.9% NaCl (1-ml volume) was added 30 μg of PEI (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA; 1 μg/μl aqueous solution). After vortexing briefly, samples were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min and then added to each dish of cells. Cells were harvested at 48 h post-transfection. Typically, RAG proteins were purified from 14 dishes of transfected cells; DNA-PEI preparations were scaled up accordingly. The ratio of DNA to PEI necessary to achieve optimal transfection efficiency was determined empirically by analyzing the percentage of GFP+ cells by flow cytometry 48 h after transfection with a GFP reporter construct. 2L. Wang and P. C. Swanson, unpublished data. Each cell pellet, representing seven dishes of harvested cells, was resuspended in 3.75 ml of buffer A (10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25% Tween 20), loaded into a Dounce tissue grinder, and subjected to 20 strokes of a type A pestle. The resulting lysate was clarified by centrifugation in a SW50.1 rotor for 40 min at 4 °C. Supernatant obtained from two pellets (14 dishes) was pooled and passed over amylose resin (New England Biolabs, 1-ml bed volume) equilibrated in buffer A, washed with 10 ml of buffer A (the final five lacking Tween 20), and eluted with buffer A containing 10 mm maltose (also lacking Tween 20). Protein-containing samples were dialyzed against buffer R (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) for 3 h. Aliquots were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. The RAG protein samples shown in Fig. 1 were all prepared in parallel and are representative of results obtained from two other independent purifications. Polyhistidine-tagged human HMG-1 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified following a procedure published previously (36Swanson P.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1340-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide Binding Assays—Intact, pre-nicked, and pre-cleaved 12- and 23-RSS substrates were assembled and purified as described previously (32Swanson P.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7790-7801Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 37Li W. Swanson P. Desiderio S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6932-6939Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Diagrams of these substrates are shown in Fig. 1. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed under the same conditions as described previously (38Swanson P.C. Desiderio S. Immunity. 1998; 9: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Protein-DNA complexes were visualized from dried gels by autoradiography using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). In-gel Cleavage and Transposition Assays—Preformed RAG-RSS complexes were assayed for cleavage and transposition activity using in-gel enzyme assays as described previously (32Swanson P.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7790-7801Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 39Swanson P.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Plasmid Cleavage and Hybrid Joint Assays—These assays were performed using the plasmid V(D)J recombination substrate pJH200 (40Hesse J.E. Lieber M.R. Gellert M. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1987; 49: 775-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions (10 μl final volume) containing various amounts of cMR1/cMR2 (wild-type or D600A mutant), cMR1/FLMR2, or FLMR1/cMR2 (as noted in the text) and 25 ng of pJH200 (supercoiled or AatII linearized) were assembled under binding conditions used for EMSA, except that 1 mm CaCl2 was substituted with 1 mm MgCl2. Reactions were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and then diluted 2-fold with TE (10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA). An aliquot of the diluted sample (15 μl) was fractionated on a 7% native polyacrylamide gel (1× TBE, 19:1 acrylamide:(bis)acrylamide), and reaction products were transferred to nylon membrane (Zeta Probe GT, Bio-Rad) in 0.5× TBE for 18 h at 20 V and at 4 °C. Membranes were subjected to Southern blotting using a 5′-32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe (JH7181, 5′-ACCTCAGAACTCCA-TCTGGATTTGTTCAGAACGCTCGGTTGC-3′). The membrane was incubated for 2 h at 42 °C in hybridization buffer (6× SSPE, 5× Denhardt's reagent, 20% formamide, 100 μg/ml single-stranded salmon sperm DNA, 0.1% SDS, and 1.25% dextran sulfate), and then incubated with the probe for 18 h under the same conditions. Membranes were washed twice for 15 min at 60 °C in buffer WB (2× SSC, 0.1% SDS) and hybridization products visualized using a PhosphorImager. For detection of hybrid joints, PCRs (100 μl) were assembled containing an aliquot (2 μl) of the remaining diluted sample as a template, HJ primers A (JH7265R; 5′-GACATGGCTCGATTGGCG-3′) and B (JH7419R; 5′-CTACCCACTGCTCTGTTC-3′) (500 pmol each) and native Taq polymerase (2.5 units; Invitrogen) in PCR buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, 200 μm each dNTP, 1.5 mm MgCl2). PCRs were subjected to initial denaturation (95 °C, 5 min), 25 cycles of amplification (95 °C for 15 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 20 s), and a final extension (72 °C for 5 min) using a PTC-100 Thermal Cycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA). As a positive control, a fragment of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene on pJH200 was amplified from the same reaction sample volume by 15 cycles of PCR under the above conditions using gene-specific primers (CATFOR, 5′-ACCAGACCGTTCAGCTGGA-3′; CATREV, 5′-CTCACCCAGGGATTGGCTGAG-3′). PCR products were resolved on 2% agarose gels (1:1 agarose:Amplicizeagarose (Bio-Rad)) and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. Where noted, PCR products were gel-isolated and cloned using the TOPO XL PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen). Randomly selected clones were sequenced. Disintegration Assay—This assay was performed using the branched substrates and reaction conditions described by Melek and Gellert (22Melek M. Gellert M. Cell. 2000; 101: 625-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, cMR1/cMR2 (wild-type or D600A mutant), cMR1/FLM2, or FLMR1/cMR2 (∼50 ng each) was incubated with a radiolabeled branched substrate (∼0.02 pmol) in the presence of Ca2+ under binding conditions as used for EMSA (10-μl reaction volume) for 10 min at 25 °C. Subsequently, MgCl2 was added to a final concentration of 5 mm, and samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by adding 2 volumes of loading buffer (95% formamide, 10 mm EDTA) and heated for 2 min at 75 °C. Reaction products were fractionated on 15% polyacrylamide-urea gels and visualized using a PhosphorImager. Purification of Coexpressed Core and Full-length RAG Proteins—Early attempts to purify full-length RAG proteins were largely unsuccessful due to poor protein solubility. Thus, all biochemical assays of RAG activity have been conducted with more readily purified truncated, catalytically active core forms of RAG-1 and RAG-2. We were interested in determining whether full-length RAG-1 and RAG-2 are more amenable to purification when expressed as MBP fusion proteins. Based on our previous experience indicating that core MBP-RAG-1/2 proteins are recovered in higher yield and with greater activity when the two proteins are coexpressed, rather than individually expressed, in mammalian cells, and evidence suggesting that RAG-1 and RAG-2 form a complex in the absence of DNA (41Bailin T. Mo X. Sadofsky M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4664-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 42Swanson P.C. Desiderio S. Mol. Cell.

Spanopoulou E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16325-16331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we speculated that coexpression of core MBP-RAG-1 with full-length MBP-RAG-2 might promote the solubility of full-length MBP-RAG-2 via RAG-1-RAG-2 interactions and vice versa. To explore this possibility, we cotransfected 293 cells with expression constructs encoding either the core or full-length forms of MBP-RAG-1 (cMR1 and FLMR1, respectively) and MBP-RAG-2 (cMR2 and FLMR2, respectively) in pairwise combinations (Fig. 1A). The coexpressed RAG proteins were purified by amylose affinity chromatography and analyzed by staining SDS-polyacrylamide gels with silver (Fig. 1B). We find that FLMR2 is readily purified when coexpressed with cMR1, but its recovery is poor when coexpressed with FLMR1. Similarly, FLMR1 is purified when coexpressed with cMR2 but not FLMR2. The yields of both RAG proteins in the cMR1/FLMR2 and FLMR1/cMR2 preparations were about 2-fold less than their counterparts in the cMR1/cMR2 preparation. The observed reduction in the yield of cMR1/FLMR2 relative to cMR1/cMR2 is not attributable to differences in RAG-2 expression, as levels of cMR2 and FLMR2 in whole cell lysates were comparable as assessed by immunoblotting using anti-MBP antibodies (data not shown). In contrast, FLMR1 is consistently present at ∼2-fold lower levels than cMR1 in whole cell lysates, providing a partial explanation for the poorer recovery of FLMR1/cMR2 compared with cMR1/cMR2. The reason why full-length RAG-1 is expressed at lower levels than core RAG-1 in 293 cells remains unclear. The biochemical basis of the poor recovery of coexpressed full-length RAG-1 and full-length RAG-2 is also unknown but, based on earlier reports (3Gellert M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), is probably attributed to the poor solubility of the full-length RAG-1-RAG-2 complex. Recombinase Incorporating FLMR1 or FLMR2 Displays Altered RSS Binding Activity Compared with All-core Recombinase—To assess how the inclusion of the dispensable portion of RAG-1 and/or RAG-2 into the V(D)J recombinase affects the DNA binding activity of the protein complex, the four purified RAG protein preparations were tested by EMSA for their ability to form single or paired RSS complexes with intact, prenicked, or pre-cleaved RSS substrates (Fig. 1C). Core RAG-1 and RAG-2 assemble two distinct protein-DNA complexes on a single RSS, termed SC1 and SC2 (Fig. 2, lane 1). Both of these complexes were shown previously to contain a RAG-1 dimer, and either one (SC1) or two (SC2) subunits of RAG-2 (32Swanson P.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7790-7801Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Compared with cMR1/cMR2, cMR1/FLMR2 forms complexes of similar mobility (Fig. 2, compare lane 4 to lane 5), but their abundance relative to their all-core counterparts is about 4-fold less, as judged by comparison to 2-fold serial dilutions of cMR1/cMR2. Interestingly, the ratio of SC1 to SC2 is ∼5:1 in the cMR1/cMR2 samples, whereas this ratio is ∼ 1:1 in the cMR1/FLMR2 sample, suggesting that the carboxyl-terminal portion of RAG-2 helps promote SC2 formation. In contrast to cMR1/cMR2 and cMR1/FLMR2, discrete protein-DNA complexes were not observed by EMSA for FLMR1/cMR2 under these conditions, although a broad band is detected whose mobility lags comparable complexes containing core RAG-1 (Fig. 2, compare lane 4 to lane 6). For FLMR1/FLMR2, only faint binding could be detected, reflecting the low abundance of protein in the sample. Hence, further studies compared the activities of only the first three RAG protein preparations. Certain architectural DNA binding factors of the HMG box family, of which HMG-1 is a prototypical member, are known to promote the assembly of RSS complexes containing core RAG-1 and RAG-2 and stimulate RAG-mediated cleavage within these complexes in vitro (36Swanson P.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1340-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 45van Gent D.C. Hiom K. Paull T.T. Gellert M.

Med. 1997; 185: 2025-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous results (32Swanson P.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7790-7801Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), SC1 and SC2 formed with cMR1/cMR2 are supershifted in the presence of HMG-1 (yielding HSC1 and HSC2, respectively) without significantly altering their relative distributions (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1 and 4). Complexes assembled with cMR1/FLMR2 are similarly supershifted when HMG-1 is present, but, unlike the cMR1-cMR2 complexes, HSC2 becomes slightly more abundant relative to HSC1 (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 2 and 5). Discerning how HMG-1 affects the DNA-binding properties of FLMR1/cMR2 is problematic, since full-length RAG-1 does not form discrete, resolvable protein-DNA complexes. However, the position of maximum signal intensity within this region is slightly supershifted compared with samples lacking HMG-1, suggesting HMG-1 is incorporated into protein-DNA complexes containing full-length RAG-1 (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 3 and 6).

https://openalex.org/W2014742624,"We have previously demonstrated that viral particles with the properties of nonenveloped hepatitis C virus (HCV) nucleocapsids occur in the serum of HCV-infected individuals (1). We show here that nucleocapsids purified directly from serum or isolated from HCV virions have FcγR-like activity and bind “nonimmune” IgG via its Fcγ domain. HCV core proteins produced in Escherichia coli and in the baculovirus expression system also bound “nonimmune” IgG and their Fcγ fragments. Folded conformation was required for IgG binding because the FcγR-like site of the core protein was inactive in denaturing conditions. Studies with synthetic core peptides showed that the region spanning amino acids 3–75 was essential for formation of the IgG-binding site. The interaction between the HCV core and human IgG is more efficient in acidic (pH 6.0) than in neutral conditions. The core protein-binding site on the IgG molecule differs from those for C1q, FcγRII (CD32), and FcγRIII (CD16) but overlaps with that for soluble protein A from Staphylococcus aureus (SpA), which is located in the CH2-CH3 interface of IgG. These characteristics of the core-IgG interaction are very similar to those of the neonatal FcRn. Surface plasmon resonance studies suggested that the binding of an anti-core antibody to HCV core protein might be “bipolar” through its paratope to the corresponding epitope and by its Fcγ region to the FcγR-like motif on this protein. These features of HCV nucleocapsids and HCV core protein may confer an advantage for HCV in terms of survival by interfering with host defense mechanisms mediated by the Fcγ part of IgG."
https://openalex.org/W2059842315,"CTXϕ is a filamentous bacteriophage that encodes cholera toxin and integrates into the Vibrio cholerae genome to form stable lysogens. In CTXϕ lysogens, gene expression originating from the rstA phage promoter is repressed by the phage-encoded repressor RstR. The N-terminal region of RstR contains a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding element similar to the helix-turn-helix of the cI/Cro family of phage repressors, whereas the short C-terminal region is unrelated to the oligomerization domain of cI repressor. Purified His-tagged RstR bound to three extended 50-bp operator sites in the rstA promoter region. Each of the RstR footprints exhibited a characteristic staggered pattern of DNase I-accessible regions that suggested RstR binds DNA as a dimer-of-dimers. In gel permeation chromatography and cross-linking experiments, RstR oligomerized to form dimers and tetramers. RstR was shown to be tetrameric when bound to operator DNA by performing mobility shift experiments with mixtures of RstR and a lengthened active variant of RstR. Binding of RstR to the high affinity O1 site could be fit to a cooperative model of operator binding in which two RstR dimers associate to form tetrameric RstR-operator complexes. The binding of RstR dimers to the left or right halves of O1 operator DNA was not observed in mobility shift assays. These observations support a model in which protein-protein contacts between neighboring RstR dimers contribute to strong operator binding. CTXϕ is a filamentous bacteriophage that encodes cholera toxin and integrates into the Vibrio cholerae genome to form stable lysogens. In CTXϕ lysogens, gene expression originating from the rstA phage promoter is repressed by the phage-encoded repressor RstR. The N-terminal region of RstR contains a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding element similar to the helix-turn-helix of the cI/Cro family of phage repressors, whereas the short C-terminal region is unrelated to the oligomerization domain of cI repressor. Purified His-tagged RstR bound to three extended 50-bp operator sites in the rstA promoter region. Each of the RstR footprints exhibited a characteristic staggered pattern of DNase I-accessible regions that suggested RstR binds DNA as a dimer-of-dimers.

The molecular mechanisms that regulate bacteriophage lysogeny have been most extensively studied in phage lambda and its close relatives that infect Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (1.Ptashne M. A Genetic Switch. 2nd Ed. Blackwell Scientific, Cambridge1992Google Scholar, 2.Susskind M. Youderian P. Hendrix R.W. Roberts J.W. Stahl F.W. Weisberg R.A. Lambda II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983: 347-363Google Scholar). For these bacteriophages, the bistable switch from lysogenic to lytic development involves the interplay of two antagonistic transcriptional repressors, CI and Cro in the case of λ, that bind to the same set of regulatory sites in the bacteriophage control regions. A similar regulatory network controls lysogeny in Ø80 (3.Ogawa T. Ogawa H. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 537-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), HK022 (4.Oberto J. Weisberg R.A. Gottesman M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 207: 675-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and the unrelated bacteriophage P2 (5.Saha S. Haggard-Ljungquist E. Nordstrom K. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, the regulation of lysogeny in a wide variety of other bacteriophages has not been investigated. CTXϕ encodes the genes for cholera toxin, the virulence factor primarily responsible for the watery diarrhea characteristic of the disease cholera. Nontoxigenic strains of Vibrio cholerae can be readily transduced to toxin-producing strains by lysogenization with CTXϕ, a process known as lysogenic conversion (6.Waldor M.K. Mekalanos J.J. Science. 1996; 272: 1910-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). Like other filamentous bacteriophage, CTXϕ does not have a truly lytic growth phase. However, CTXϕ lysogens exhibit several characteristics found in other temperate bacteriophages: 1) CTXϕ lysogens contain the CTX prophage stably integrated into the V. cholerae genome and 2) the CTX prophage expresses a transcriptional repressor, RstR, that represses the expression of CTXϕ replication genes and provides immunity to secondary infection by CTXϕ (7.Waldor M.K. Rubin E.J. Pearson G.D. Kimsey H. Mekalanos J.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 917-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 8.Kimsey H.H. Waldor M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7035-7039Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). CTXϕ shares genetic and morphological similarities with the E. coli filamentous bacteriophage fd. Similarities in gene sequence and gene order indicate that many elements of the pathway for phage assembly and secretion are conserved (6.Waldor M.K. Mekalanos J.J. Science. 1996; 272: 1910-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar, 9.Davis B.M. Lawson E.H. Sandkvist M. Ali A. Sozhamannan S. Waldor M.K. Science. 2000; 288: 333-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A novel region of the CTXϕ genome known as the “RS region” encodes rstA and rstB, two genes whose products are required for the replication and integration of the CTXϕ chromosome, respectively (7.Waldor M.K. Rubin E.J. Pearson G.D. Kimsey H. Mekalanos J.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 917-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The RS region also encodes the transcriptional repressor RstR, which is divergently transcribed from rstA. rstA is expressed from a strong promoter in intergenic region 2 (ig-2), the 138-bp region separating rstA from rstR (8.Kimsey H.H. Waldor M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7035-7039Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1A). Expression of rstA is strongly repressed in CTXϕ lysogens, and RstR is the only V. cholerae factor required for rstA repression in E. coli (7.Waldor M.K. Rubin E.J. Pearson G.D. Kimsey H. Mekalanos J.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 917-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). RstR encodes a 13-kDa protein with an N-terminal helix-turn-helix (HTH) 1The abbreviation used is: HTH, helix-turn-helix.1The abbreviation used is: HTH, helix-turn-helix. element similar to the HTH present in the Cro/cI superfamily of repressors (7.Waldor M.K. Rubin E.J. Pearson G.D. Kimsey H. Mekalanos J.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 917-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). This sequence similarity extends to regions surrounding the bi-helical HTH motif, suggesting that the entire N-terminal region of RstR folds into an α-helical domain similar to that of CI repressor (10.Wintjens R. Rooman M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 294-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The short C-terminal region of RstR is unrelated to the oligomerization domain of CI repressor. Three distinct CTXϕ variants have been described. CTXETϕ (derived from O1 El Tor V. cholerae), CTXCLϕ (derived from classical V. cholerae), and CTXCalcϕ (derived from O139 Calcutta V. cholerae) are largely identical, but each encodes a unique RstR repressor and adjacent ig-2 region (8.Kimsey H.H. Waldor M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7035-7039Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 11.Davis B.M. Kimsey H.H. Chang W. Waldor M.K. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6779-6787Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each RstR allele specifically represses expression of its neighboring rstA gene but is unable to repress rstA expression from a heterologous CTXϕ. These observations led to the proposal that each RstR repressor binds exclusively and specifically to cognate operators in its neighboring ig-2 sequences (8.Kimsey H.H. Waldor M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7035-7039Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Here we show that purified RstRET binds to three operator sites in the rstA promoter region. Unlike many bacterial HTH repressors, RstR binds to extended 50-bp operators, forming tetrameric repressor-operator complexes. The pathway for formation of these complexes appears to involve the cooperative interaction of two RstR dimers bound to neighboring sites in operator DNA. Our model for RstR binding bears similarities, as well as interesting differences, to the “pairwise” cooperative binding of lambda CI dimers to adjacent operator sites in the lambda control region. Plasmids and Strains—E. coli XL1-Blue (recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 hsdR17 supE44 relA1 lacZΔM15/F′::Tn10 lacIQ) (Stratagene, La Jolla CA) was used for routine cloning and for the overexpression of RstR6H. The ig-2 fragments 312, 309, and 301 were generated by the polymerase chain reaction with the appropriate primers and pCTX-Kn as template DNA. The resulting PCR products were cloned into plasmid PCRII (Invitrogen), and the DNA sequence of the resulting plasmids was determined. RstR6H Expression Vector—The rstR coding sequence was amplified by PCR from pCTX-Kn using the primers RSTR1 (5′-CCCCATGGCGAAGATAAAAGAA) and RSTR4 (5′-GCGGATCCAGCACCATGATTT) and ligated to PCR2.1 (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid, pHK297, was digested with NcoI and BamHI, and the rstR-containing fragment was isolated and ligated to the expression vector pQE60 (Qiagen) previously digested with NcoI and BamHI. The resulting plasmid, pH-K300, encodes RstR6H with an additional alanine residue after the initiator methionine (because of the introduction of the NcoI restriction site) and the sequence GSRSHHHHHH-COOH after the terminal alanine residue of RstR. RstR-CBD-6H was constructed by cloning a PCR product encoding the 52-amino acid chitin-binding domain of Bacillus circulans from plasmid pTXB1 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) into the unique BamHI site in pHK300. RstR6H Purification—A 10-liter fermentor culture of E. coli strain XL1-blue (Stratagene) containing pHK300 was grown with aeration at 37 °C in Luria broth supplemented with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin. RstR6H expression was induced at an A600 of 0.8 by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 16 h, the cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 100 ml of chilled buffer A (0.05 m NaH2PO4, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.0), and lysed by two passes in a French pressure cell at 24,000 psi. Cell debris was sedimented at 100,000 × g for 1 h (S100 fraction), and RstR6H was purified by Ni2+ chelation affinity chromatography as follows. Two ml of a 50:50 slurry of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) in buffer A was added to 35 ml of S100 extract, and the mixture was gently mixed on ice for 1 h. The slurry was transferred to a small chromatography column and washed with ∼150 ml of buffer A, followed by 35 ml of buffer A containing 0.1 m imidazole. RstR6H was eluted in 5 ml of buffer A containing 0.3 m imidazole (pH unadjusted). The RstR6H-containing fraction (2.5 ml) was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C versus 200 ml of buffer A. RstR6H was further purified by a second round of affinity chromatography using the above procedure. The final eluate (1 ml) was dialyzed overnight versus buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.25 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0), and the aliquots were stored frozen at –70 °C. The lengthened RstR-CBD-6H protein was purified similarly. RstR6H concentrations were determined by UV absorption at 280 nm, using a molar extinction coefficient of 8,370 m–1 cm–1 (12.Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5058) Google Scholar). After SDS-PAGE, the proteins bands were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and subjected to N-terminal sequencing. CD spectra were obtained at 25 °C on a Jasco 810 spectropolarimeter, using a 0.1-cm quartz sample cell. For CD analysis, RstR6H was first dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 0.25 m NaF. Gel Mobility Shift Assay—The ig-2 DNA fragments were liberated from the PCRII cloning vector by EcoRI digestion, fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and purified using a Qiaquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). DNA was radiolabeled using T4 DNA polymerase and [α-32P]dATP. Synthetic O1 DNA probes were made by radiolabeling one oligonucleotide with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and annealing to a complementary unlabeled oligonucleotide. The resulting DNA fragments were purified on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and extracted using the “soak and crush” method (13.Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 5.51Google Scholar). DNA binding reactions were as follows: 20-μl binding reactions contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA, and 5,000 cpm probe DNA (1–2 fmol). RstR6H dilutions were prepared in cold reaction buffer immediately prior to use. The binding reactions were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. In experiments with 309 probe, an incubation on ice for 20 min prior to gel electrophoresis was found to significantly improve the stability of RstR-DNA complexes. Where probes were digested with AluI, the digested DNA was added directly to binding reactions without further purification. For mixing experiments with RstR6H and RstR-CBD-6H, the protein mixtures were prepared in binding buffer plus 50 mm dithiothreitol to prevent covalent dimer formation through the single cysteine residue present in RstR6H and RstR-CBD-6H. The RstR mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min prior to the addition to DNA binding reactions, as described above. One microliter of a buffered dye solution (0.1% bromphenol blue) was added to each sample, and the aliquots were loaded onto 6% acrylamide DNA retardation gels (0.5× TBE) and electrophoresed at 10V/cm. The gels were dried directly to blotting paper and exposed to autoradiographic film. For quantitation of bound and free DNA, the dried gels were scanned with a Molecular Dynamics STORM PhosphorImager and quantitated using ImageQuant software. For DNA binding experiments, the fraction of total DNA bound was calculated as counts bound/(counts bound + counts free) without any corrections. Phosphorimaging data from a preliminary DNA binding experiment were collected after 16 and 62 h of exposure. These data yielded essentially identical binding curves, indicating that the response of the phosphorimaging device was linear over a wide range of exposure levels. DNase I Footprint Assay—DNase I footprint assays were performed as previously described (14.Bruist M.F. Glasgow A.C. Johnson R.C. Simon M.I. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 762-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). End-labeled DNA probes were generated by PCR with one 5′-radiolabeled primer and a second nonradiolabeled primer. DNA probes were purified by nondenaturing PAGE and eluted using the crush and soak method. The reactions were carried out in 30 μl containing 50,000 cpm of labeled DNA fragment and purified RstR6H, as described above for gel shift experiments. Binding proceeded for 30 min at room temperature. 0.2 unit of DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX) was added, and the incubation was continued for 1 min. The G+A sequencing ladders were generated as previously described (15.Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (9013) Google Scholar). Dried DNA pellets were resuspended in loading buffer (95% formamide, 18 mm Na2EDTA, 0.025% SDS, 0.01% xylene cyanol, and bromphenol blue) and heated to 90 °C for 2 min prior to loading onto pre-run 8% sequencing gels. The gels were dried to blotting paper and exposed to autoradiographic film. Gel Permeation Chromatography—Gel permeation was performed on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (total volume, 24 ml), using an Amersham Biosciences fast protein liquid chromatography system. The column was equilibrated in buffer B plus 5 mm dithiothreitol and calibrated with a set of molecular weight markers (Fluka) as shown in Fig. 4. RstR6H samples (0.2 ml) were preincubated at 30 °C for 30 min and chromatographed at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. 0.5-ml fractions were collected, and RstR6H was detected in an immobilized immunoassay using mouse anti-RstR antisera. To confirm the presence of RstR, the column fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-RstR antisera. Formaldehyde Cross-linking—Formaldehyde was added to RstR6H (0.1–0.3 mg/ml) in buffer B to a final concentration of 1% and incubated for 10 min at 22 °C. Cross-linking was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer and heating to 95 °C for 5 min. The samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (0.1 m dithiothreitol) on 10% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were stained with a colloidal Coomassie G-250 staining kit (Invitrogen). Calculations—A reaction describing the equilibrium binding of two RstR dimers to DNA to form tetrameric complexes with no intermediates is as follows, 2R2+OKA↔R4O where R2 is a free RstR dimer, O is free operator DNA, and R4O is the bound complex. KA, the apparent equilibrium association constant, is as follows. KA=[R4O]/[R2]2[O] For a highly cooperative binding reaction, it is useful to define the following equation, Θ/(1-Θ)=KA[R2]2 where Θ is the fraction of total binding sites occupied in DNA binding experiments (16.Tinoco I. Sauer K. Wang J.C. Physical Chemistry: Principles and Applications in Biological Sciences. 2nd Ed. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1985: 573Google Scholar). Preferring to describe binding in terms of the apparent dissociation constant, KD, we determined the following equation. Θ/(1-Θ)=[R2]2/KD(Eq. 4) Rearranging Equation 4 gives Θ=[R2]2/(KD+[R2]2)(Eq. 5) We approximated [R2] ≈ [RTotal]/2, because the dimer:tetramer equilibrium constant is in the micromolar range, whereas DNA binding occurs at nanomolar RstR concentrations. A monomer-dimer equilibrium was not considered here but could play a role in operator binding. Trial-and-error fitting of theoretical binding curves and linear regression analyses of the Hill plot was carried out using GraphPad Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego CA). RstR Binds to Multiple Sites in the rstA Promoter Region— RstR containing a C-terminal polyhistidinyl tag (RstR6H) was overexpressed and purified from E. coli by two rounds of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”). This material was about 95% pure, as estimated from SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (see Fig. 4B). As predicted from the gene sequence, the final material yielded a single band of ∼14 kDa after SDS-PAGE. The N-terminal sequence of the 14-kDa band was found to be AKIKER. Residues 2–6 were identical to positions 2–6 of the predicted RstR sequence, whereas the alanine at position 1 is the result of cloning the rstR gene into the expression plasmid vector. The apparent lack of an N-terminal methionine residue indicates that the initiator formyl-methionine is proteolytically removed in E. coli. Far UV circular dichroism spectra of RstR6H showed clear minima at 208 and 222 nm, indicating that RstR contains α-helical secondary structure. By analyzing β-galactosidase expression from an rstA::lacZ reporter plasmid, we previously showed that a 290-bp DNA fragment containing the ig-2 region from CTXϕET contained both the PrstA promoter and sequences sufficient for rstR-mediated transcription repression of PrstA (8.Kimsey H.H. Waldor M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7035-7039Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A similar DNA fragment, extending from –168 to +88 relative to the rstA transcription start site, was used to investigate DNA binding by purified RstR6H in mobility shift assays. As shown in Fig. 1, RstR6H retarded the migration of the 256-bp 312 probe, giving rise to three more slowly migrating bands. The more quickly migrating shifted band probably represents repressor binding to a high affinity binding site, whereas the second and third shifted bands indicate successive binding of RstR6H to two additional sites. In further mobility shift experiments, RstR6H did not bind to ig-2 DNA probes derived from CTXϕCl or CTXϕCalc (data not shown). The rstR-ig-2 regions of all three CTXϕ genomes are widely divergent, and individual RstR repressors exclusively repress expression of their neighboring rstA promoter (8.Kimsey H.H. Waldor M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7035-7039Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 17.Kimsey H.H. Nair G.B. Ghosh A. Waldor M.K. Lancet. 1998; 352: 457-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We conclude from these observations that RstR6H binds specifically to regulatory sequences within the ig-2 region of CTXϕET. To map RstR6H binding sites in ig-2, mobility shift assays were performed with two smaller, overlapping probes. RstR6H retarded the mobility of labeled 301 DNA (–77 to +43) to a single more slowly migrating species (Fig. 1B). Binding occurred over a relatively small range of repressor concentrations (<10-fold), with half-maximal binding occurring at ∼3.5 nm RstR6H. RstR6H shifted the 309 probe (–168 to –7) to two more slowly migrating bands. Upon titration of RstR6H into the 309 binding reactions, the more quickly migrating shifted form (band 1) diminished in intensity and the more slowly migrating species (band 2) accumulated, suggesting that RstR6H binds sequentially to two sites in 309. Half-maximal binding to 309 occurred at ∼20 nm RstR6H. To refine the mapping of RstR binding sites, end-labeled 301 and 309 probes were digested with the restriction endonuclease AluI and the resulting subfragments were used in mobility shift assays. AluI cuts 301 once at position –4, resulting in two labeled subfragments. Neither 301 subfragment was shifted by RstR6H, indicating that the RstR binding site in 301 overlaps or is very close to this AluI site (data not shown). Similarly, AluI digestion of 309 at position –80 resulted in two subfragments, neither of which was shifted by RstR6H (data not shown). One interpretation of this experiment is that the two potential RstR binding sites in 309 both overlap the AluI site at –80. Alternatively, only one binding site overlaps the (–80)AluI site, but RstR binding to a neighboring site requires that RstR first bind to the AluI-containing site. These experiments physically map three RstR binding sites in ig-2; one high affinity binding site overlaps the AluI restriction site at position –4, whereas two lower affinity binding sites are located near the AluI site at position –80. The high affinity binding site in 301 was named O1, and the two promoter-distal binding sites were named O2 and O3. DNase I Protection Analysis of RstR6H Binding—The precise positions of RstR binding sites in ig-2 was determined by DNase I protection assay (18.Galas D.J. Schmitz A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 3157-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). Because full-length ig-2 DNA was too large for high resolution footprint analysis, the above-mentioned 301 and 309 DNA fragments were radiolabeled and used as probes in these experiments. Fig. 2A shows DNase I protection data for each strand of the 301 probe. Fig. 3 summarizes all of the DNase I protection experiments. RstR6H protected an unusually large 50-bp region (+17 to –32) in 301 corresponding to the high affinity O1 binding site. Complete occupancy of O1 occurred abruptly with increasing RstR6H concentrations, similar to the binding pattern observed in mobility shift assays (Fig. 1). Two footprinted regions, each ∼50 bp in length, were identified in 309 as corresponding to the promoter-distal sites O2 and O3. These footprints extended from positions –40 to –150. The region between O2 and O3 contained an unusual number of DNase I hypersensitive sites on both strands, suggesting that this region of the DNA is bent or distorted upon RstR binding. Interestingly, the footprints show that only the O2 site spans the single AluI restriction site in 309 (Fig. 3). Therefore, our previous mobility shift results indicate that RstR cannot stably bind to the isolated O3 site present on one of the AluI subfragments. Taken together, these data suggest that RstR can only bind to O3 if RstR is first bound to the neighboring O2 site.Fig. 3Summary diagram of RstR6H footprints in ig-2. The shaded areas indicate DNase I-protected regions, and unmarked bases indicate positions that remain DNase I-susceptible after RstR binding. Stars denote DNase I-hypersensitive sites; open circles denote partially protected sites. The rstA and rstR transcription start sites are depicted with angled arrows, and their –10 and –35 consensus sites are shown in bold type. The AluI restriction sites at positions –80 and –6 are shown boxed. The four potential half-site operator sequences in O1 are identified by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The O1, O2, and O3 footprints included sites that remained DNase I-accessible and positions that became hypersensitive to DNase I attack after RstR6H binding. These DNase I-exposed sites clustered in short 2–3-bp regions and were interspersed with strongly protected regions 6–11 bp in length (Fig. 3). A similar pattern was observed on the opposite DNA strand, although shifted 3 bp in the 3′ direction. This offset pattern is expected if the minor groove of relatively short regions remain exposed after RstR binding, because DNase I cuts in the minor groove and the nearest backbone ribose-phosphate groups are about 3 bp apart in the 3′ direction (19.Drew H.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 176: 535-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). This protection pattern is seen more clearly when the footprint data are mapped onto a planar projection of DNA, as shown in Fig. 2B. Displaying the data in this way revealed another feature of the RstR binding sites: DNase I-exposed regions occurred on one face of the DNA helix in one half of the footprint, as shown by the exposed patches forming a line parallel to the primary DNA helical axis. This pattern shifted ∼3 bp, representing a 100° turn about the DNA helical axis, to a different face of the DNA helix in the remaining half of the footprint. A similar DNase I protection pattern was observed in the O2 and O3 footprints (data not shown). This pattern is most easily explained if one RstR moiety, probably a dimer, bound to the face of the DNA helix opposite each set of exposed sites. Each half-region is sufficiently large (20–25 bp) to present two consecutive major groove elements required for binding the two HTH elements of an RstR dimer. RstR Is Tetrameric When Bound to Operator DNA—After affinity purification, the oligomeric state of RstR6H was probed by gel permeation chromatography and formaldehyde cross-linking. As shown in Fig. 4A, RstR6H eluted as two peaks with Mr values of ∼24,000 and ∼46,000. We suggest that these peaks represent a mixture of dimers and tetramers (predicted Mr values of ∼28,000 and 56,000 for dimers and tetramers, respectively). The apparent molecular weights deviated from the predicted values for dimers and tetramers, a discrepancy that may be due to RstR6H folding into a more compact shape than a typical globular protein. When increasingly dilute RstR6H samples were chromatographed, the peak corresponding to dimers increased in size relative to the tetramer peak, indicating that tetramers dissociate into dimers. We estimated the apparent dimer/tetramer dissociation constant, Ktet, to be ∼0.5 μm monomer RstR6H. Therefore, RstR6H would be primarily dimeric, or possibly monomeric, at the nanomolar concentrations where DNA binding is observed. As shown in Fig. 4B, RstR6H could be cross-linked to dimers using formaldehyde (apparent Mr = ∼28 kDa). The size and pattern of RstR footprints suggested to us that RstR binds operator DNA as a dimer-of-dimers. To determine precisely the oligomeric state of RstR when bound to operator DNA, we employed the mixed oligomer technique devised by Hope and Struhl (20.Hope I.A. Struhl K. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2781-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). A lengthened variant of RstR repressor, RstR-CBD-6H, was mixed with RstR6H and used in mobility shift assays of O1 operator binding. RstR-CBD-6H contains 52 additional C-terminal residues and retards O1 DNA to a greater extent than RstR6H in mobility shift assays (Fig. 5). RstR activity was unaffected by the C-terminal addition in RstR-CBD-6H, because the purified fusion protein bound O1 DNA with an affinity comparable with that of RstR6H. As shown in Fig. 5, a total of five shifted bands were observed when mixtures of RstR6H(short) and RstR-CBD-6H(long) were incubated with labeled O1 DNA. The slowest and fastest migrating complexes co-migrated with the RstR-CBD-6H and RstR6H complexes, respectively. The bands of intermediate mobility represent complexes that contain distinct mixtures of “short” and “long” forms of RstR. If RstR bound to its operator as a tetramer, five complexes corre"

Only heterotrimeric laminin-5CCG with at least subdomains LG1–3, but not the single chains, supported binding of soluble α3β1 integrin, proving the coiled-coil domain of laminin-5 to be essential for its interaction with α3β1 integrin. The N-glycosylation sites in wild-type α3 chain were mapped by mass spectrometry. Their location in a structural model of the LG domain suggested that large regions on both faces of the LG1 and LG2 domains are inaccessible by other proteins. However, neither heterotrimerization nor α3β1 integrin binding was affected by the loss of N-linked glycoconjugates. After the proteolytic cleavage between the subdomains LG3 and LG4, the LG4–5 tandem domain dissociated from the rest of the G domain. Further, the laminin-5CCG molecule with the α3′LG1–3 chain showed an increased binding affinity for α3β1 integrin, indicating that proteolytic processing of laminin-5 influences its interaction with α3β1 integrin.

Laminin-5 differs from the other members of the laminin superfamily not only in its distinct chains, α3, β3, and γ2, and its biochemical processing, but also in its tissue distribution, its subcellular localization, and its cellular receptors. Laminin-5 is the major component of anchoring filaments, which are an essential part of the dermal-epidermal junction (14Burgeson R.E. Christiano A.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). They link epithelial cells to the underlying connective tissue via the basal membrane. This sheet-like extracellular matrix consists of a lamina densa, a dense meshwork containing laminins other than laminin-5 and type IV collagen, which are interconnected by nidogen (15Timpl R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 618-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Laminin-5 plays an important part in the assembly of the basal membrane (2Colognato H. Yurchenco P.D. Dev.

Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Genetically or immunologically induced defects in laminin-5 function cause severe disorders in the basal membrane, manifested as skin blisters, which may be lethal (1Tunggal P. Smyth N. Paulsson M.

Sonnenberg A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 411-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Via its N-terminal arms, laminin-5 interacts with extracellular matrix components including other laminin molecules (25Champliaud M.-F. Lunstrum G.P. Rousselle P. Nishiyama T. Keene D.R. Burgeson R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1189-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and type VII collagen (26Rousselle P. Keene D.R. Ruggiero F. Champliaud M.-F. van der Rest M. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Thus laminin-5 may support cell-matrix contacts both directly and indirectly. In a previous paper, we described the production of a soluble α3β1 integrin, a specific receptor for laminin-5 (27Eble J.A. Wucherpfennig K.W. Gauthier L. Dersch P. Krukonis E. Isberg R.R. Hemler M.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10945-10955Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Here, we report the production of recombinant laminin-5CCG molecules, which comprise 15 heptad repeats of the CC domain and the G domain with different numbers of LG subdomains. Using these laminin-5 fragments, the molecular interaction of α3β1 integrin with its high affinity ligand was studied, bringing new evidence for the location of the α3β1 integrin binding site and its conformational constraints, as well as demonstrating the effect of proteolytic processing of the laminin-5 G domain on α3β1 integrin binding. Antibodies and Cell Culture—Antibodies were from the following sources. The rat monoclonal antibody (mAb) against a pentahistidine sequence was from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). The goat polyclonal antibodies (pAb) against GST was from Amersham Biosciences. The rat mAb against the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (clone 3F10) was from Roche Applied Science, and the pAb against the LG4–5 tandem domain of human laminin-5 was from Dr. P. Rousselle (Institute de Biologie et Chemie des Proteines, Lyon, France). The murine mAb BM165 against the LG1 domain of human laminin-5 (25Champliaud M.-F. Lunstrum G.P. Rousselle P. Nishiyama T. Keene D.R. Burgeson R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1189-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and the activating β1 integrin rat mAb 9EG7 (from Dr. D. Vestweber, University of Muenster, Germany) were purified from hybridoma supernatants following standard protocols. Biotinylation of BM165 was performed with a 500-fold molar surplus of Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) for 2 h at room temperature with subsequent dialysis to remove unbound biotinylation reagent. Generation of the α3′ Chain Constructs—The cDNA fragment flanked by NheI and BglII restriction sites, which encodes the authentic signal sequence of the laminin-5 α3 chain, an oligohistidine tag, a short spacer sequence, the C-terminal 15 heptad repeats of CC domain, and the N-terminal 182 amino acids of subdomain LG1 (amino acids 688–1155 of laminin-5 α3 chain sequence (28Ryan M.C. Tizard R. VanDevanter D.R. Carter W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22779-22787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) was generated by standard PCR using the vector pCDNA-α3ALam5 (provided by G. Meneguzzi, INSERM U385, Nice, France) (17Vidal F. Baudoin C. Miquel C. Galliano M.F. Christiano A.M. Uitto J. Ortonne J.P. Meneguzzi G.

The BglII-NotI-flanked cDNA fragment encoding the rest of the G domain of the laminin-5 α3 chain was generated by reverse transcription PCR. The NheI-BglII- and BglII-NotI-flanked cDNA fragments were cloned jointly into the pIRES-YFP and afterward into pIRES-neo2 (both vector from Clontech) to obtain the expression vectors encoding the α3′LG1–5 chain. To generate C-terminally shortened fragments, stop codons were introduced by PCR at the 3′-end of the cDNA-sequence encoding the respective LG subdomains. The following primers with the respective restriction sites, underlined and named in parentheses, were used to generate the following constructs: α3′LG1–3, forward primer 5′-ACT GCT TCT CAT CGA TGA CC-3′ (ClaI) and reverse primer 5′-TCC AGC ACA CTG GTT AAT TAA TCT AGA TTA CTG CAA CAG CTG GTT GAT AC-3′ (PacI); α3′LG1–2, forward primer 5′-TGG AGG TTA CCC ACC TGA TT-3′ (BstE II) and reverse primer 5′-TTA ATT AAT CTA GAT TAA CTC AAT TGT CCT CCT CTG G-3′ (PacI); α3′LG1, forward primer 5′-TGG AGG TTA CCC ACC TGA TT-3′ (BstE II) and reverse primer 5′-TTA ATT AAT CTA GAT TAC TTC CTC CTC CTT CTA CAA GGC TC-3′ (PacI). The indicated restriction sites were used to substitute the α3′LG1–5 sequence within the pIRES-YFP and pIRES-neo2 vectors for the shorter fragments. Generation of the GST-β3′ and GST-γ2′ Constructs—Both the β3′ and the γ2′ construct were first generated as a bicistronic eukaryotic expression vector pL5B3-IRES-L5C2. Using this vector, two individual bacterial expression vectors were designed which code for each of the two laminin chains fused to an N-terminal GST moiety. The β3′ cDNA in pL5B3-IRES-L5C2 was generated in several steps. A XbaI-NotI-flanked cDNA fragment encoding the authentic signal sequence, the biotin ligase recognition sequence, a short (Gly)3 spacer, and the C-terminal 15 heptad repeats (amino acids 1060–1170) of the human laminin-5 β3 chain (29Gerecke D.R. Wagman D.W. Champliaud M.-F. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11073-11080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was generated by standard PCR using the vector p92–85 (provided by G. Meneguzzi) and two pairs of partially overlapping primers 5′-CAC TCT AGA ACC ATG AGA ACC ATT CTT CCT CTT GTG TTT TGC CCT GCC TGG CCT CCT GC-3′ (forward primer LB3-F1 with the XbaI site underlined) and 5′-CAT CTT CTG GGC TTC GAA GAT GCC GCC CAG GGG CCT GGC ATG CAG GAG GCC AGG CAG GGC-3′ (LB3-R1), as well as 5′-CTT CGA AGC CCA GAA GAT GGA GCT GAG GGG CGG CGG CCT TGC GGA AGG TGC CAG CGA GC-3′ (forward primer LB3-F2) and 5′-CAC GCG GCC GCT CAC TTG CAG GTG GCA TAG TAG AGC ACG CGC C-3′ (reverse primer LB3-R2 with the NotI site underlined). Similarly, an NheI-ApaI-flanked cDNA fragment encoding the authentic signal sequence, the HA epitope sequence, a (Gly)3 spacer, and the C-terminal 15 heptad repeats (amino acids 1074–1193) of the human γ2 chain (30Vailly J. Verrando P. Champliaud M.-F. Gerecke D. Wagman D.W. Baudoin C. Aberdam D. Burgeson R. Bauer E. Ortonne J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) was generated by standard PCR using vector pPCR1.3–52 (provided by G. Meneguzzi) and two pairs of partially overlapping primers 5′-GTG GCT AGC ACC ATG CCT GCG CTC TGG CTG GGC TGC TGC CTC TGC TTC TCG CTC CTC CTG-3′ (forward primer LC2-F1 with the NheI site underlined) and 5′-GGG ACG TCG TAT GGG TAG GGC CTG GCC CGG GCT GCG GGC AGG AGG AGC GAG AAG CAG AGG-3′ (reverse primer LC2-R1), as well as 5′-CCC TAC CCA TAC GAC GTC CCA GAC TAC GCT GGC GGC GGC CAG ATG GTG ATT ACA GAG GCC-3′ (forward primer LC2-F2) and 5′-CAC GGG CCC TCA CTG TTG CTC AAG AGC CTG GGT ATT GTA GCA GCC-3′ (reverse primer LC2-R2 with the ApaI site underlined). The β3′ and γ2′ chains encoding cDNA fragments were inserted together with a NotI-NheI-flanked IRES sequence into the eukaryotic expression vector pRC-CMV (Stratagene) leading to the vector pL5B3-IRES-L5C2. The cDNA fragments encoding the signal sequence-free β3′ and γ2′ chains with an N-terminally fused GST domain were generated by standard PCR using the vector pL5B3-IRES-L5C2 and primer pairs containing the restriction sites that were necessary to insert the constructs into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences). The primers for the pGEX-GST-β3′-construct were 5′-GTC GAC TTC GAA GCC CAG AAG ATG G-3′ (forward primer LB3-F3 with the SalI site underlined) and 5′-GGC TCG AGT CAC TTG CAG GTG GCA TAG-3′ (reverse primer LB3-R3 with the XhoI site underlined). The primers for the pGEX-GST-γ2′-construct were 5′-GTC GAC TAC CCA TAC GAC GTC CCA G-3′ (LC2-F3 with the SalI underlined) and 5′-CTC GAG TCA CTG TTG CTC AAG AGC C-3′ (reverse primer LC2-R3 with the XhoI site underlined). All sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Medigenomix, Martinsried, Germany). Establishing α3′ Chains Producing 293 Cell Clones—Human epithelial kidney cells (HEK) 293 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 1.75 mml-glutamine. The pIRES-neo2 vectors containing the α3′ chain-encoding cDNAs were transfected into 293 cells using the Trans-Fast™ transfection reagent (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stably transfected clones were selected in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin. Positive clones were established by screening for their production of α3′ chains in a sandwich ELISA. Isolation of Recombinantly Expressed α3′ Chains—The 293 cell clones producing the different α3′ chains were grown in serum-free medium for 2 days. To avoid processing of the α3′LG1–5 chain, 25 μm BMP-1 isoenzyme inhibitor-1 (Fibrogen) and 1 μg/ml aprotinin were added. Cell supernatants were harvested and supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (ICN Biomedicals) and 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. α3′ chains were precipitated with 60% ammonium sulfate, dialyzed against Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.0, and loaded onto a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow column (Qiagen). After washing the resin with 20 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, the α3′ chains were eluted with an imidazole steps of 40, 100, and 250 mm in the same buffer. After dialysis against PBS, pH 7.4, protein concentration was determined by the BCA method (Pierce). Purity of the α3′ chains was evaluated in SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Isolation of GST-β3′ and GST-γ2′ Chains—Bacteria transformed with the expression vectors pGEX-GST-β3′ or pGEX-GST-γ2′ were grown at 37 °C and induced for 4 h with 1 m isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (BioTech Trade & Service GmbH, St. Leon-Rot, Germany). Bacteria were then centrifuged, resuspended in PBS containing 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, and lysed by freeze-thaw cycling, by incubation with 1 mg/ml lysozyme (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) for 30 min, and by sonication three times for 30 s. The GST-β3′- or GST-γ2′-containing inclusion bodies were centrifuged and dissolved in PBS containing 8 m urea, 30 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. After centrifugation, the solubilized GST-tagged laminin chains were dialyzed against PBS, pH 7.4. They were isolated by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentration and purity were tested by BCA (Pierce) and SDS-PAGE. Enzymatic Modifications of the Laminin-5CCG Fragments—The α3′LG1–5 chain was processed proteolytically with plasmin (Roche Diagnostics) at an enzyme:substrate ratio of 20 units/mg in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, at 26 °C overnight. Deglycosylation of the α3′ chains was achieved with PNGase F (Roche Diagnostics) at an enzyme: substrate ratio of 5 units/μg at 37 °C overnight. To remove the GST moiety, the GST-γ2′ chain was treated with thrombin (Sigma) for 1 h at 26 °C at an enzyme:substrate ratio of 10 units/mg. The digestion was stopped by addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The GST-free γ2′ chain was found in the flow-through of a GSH column. Mapping the Sites of N-Glycosylation within the Laminin-5 α3 Chain—The wild-type laminin-5 was isolated from supernatant of SCC 25 cells as described previously (27Eble J.A. Wucherpfennig K.W. Gauthier L. Dersch P. Krukonis E. Isberg R.R. Hemler M.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10945-10955Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). After electrophoretic separation of the three laminin-5 chains, the α3 chain was excised from the gel and subsequently digested with PNGase F and trypsin as described in Ref. 31Küster B. Wheeler S.F. Hunter A.P. Dwek R.A. Harvey D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 82-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar. The N-glycans and tryptic peptides were extracted from the gel and analyzed by MALDI and/or electrospray mass spectrometry. Nano-electrospray was carried out using a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) in positive ion mode (ESI(+)). A Z-spray atmospheric pressure ionization source was used with the source temperature set to 80 °C and a desolvation gas (N2) flow rate at 75 liters/h. Peptide preparations were dissolved in 5–10 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetate and acetonitrile (1:1) and were applied to nanospray capillaries. The capillary tip was set to a potential of 1.1 kV, and the cone voltage was 40 V. For collision-induced dissociation experiments double and triple charged precursor ions were selected in the quadrupole analyzer and fragmented in the collision cell using collision gas (argon) at 2.5 × 10–5 mbar and collision energies of 20–30 eV. Acquisition and analysis of data were performed with the MassLynx Windows NT PC data system. NaI was used as mass standard for calibration, and mass accuracy of all measurements was within 0.1 atomic mass unit. Peptide and glycan maps by MALDI mass spectrometry were obtained using Reflex III mass spectrometer (Bruker, Bremmen, Germany) and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as matrix. Sandwich ELISA to Detect Laminin-5 α3′ Chains and Heterotrimeric Laminin-5CCG Molecules—To screen α3′ chain-producing 293 cell clones and to prove the heterotrimeric nature of the self-assembled laminin-5CCG molecules, sandwich ELISAs were performed. The oligohistidine-tagged α3′ chains or the GST-bearing GST-β3′/γ2′ heterodimers were captured with immobilized antibodies against the oligohistidine tag and the GST moiety, respectively, which were coated at 5 μg/ml to microtiter plates at 4 °C overnight. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, ammonium sulfate-concentrated supernatants of transfected clones, 25 mm octyl-β-d-glycopyranoside-extracted cell pellets, or solutions of heterotrimeric laminin-5CCG molecules at 2 μg/ml were added to the wells. After washing the wells, bound α3′ chains and heterotrimeric laminin-5CCG molecules were detected by 10 μg/ml biotinylated BM165 followed by 1:1000 alkaline phosphatase-conjugated extravidin (Sigma). Enzymatic conversion of p-nitrophenyl phosphate by alkaline phosphatase was measured at 405 nm in an ELISA reader (Dynatech, Alexandria, VA). Binding of α3β1 Integrin to Laminin-5CCG Molecules—Microtiter plates were precoated with capturing antibodies against the oligohistidine tag or against GST (10 μg/ml in TBS, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, washing buffer) at 4 °C overnight. After two washing steps with the washing buffer and after blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin solution in washing buffer, laminin-5CCG molecules or its individual chains (2 μg/ml in 1% bovine serum albumin and washing buffer) were captured with precoated antibodies. Soluble α3β1 integrin was added in 1% bovine serum albumin in washing buffer, supplemented with 1 mm MnCl2 and a 3-fold molar excess of the integrin-activating mAb 9EG7, or in the presence of 10 mm EDTA (nonspecific background) for 2 h at room temperature. After two washing steps with 50 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, bound α3β1 integrin was fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution in the same buffer and detected with a rabbit antiserum against the integrin β1 subunit and an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody, as described previously (27Eble J.A.

Recombinant Production of α3′ Chains—cDNAs were generated encoding laminin-5 α3′ chains, which share the authentic signal sequence, an oligohistidine tag, and the C-terminal 15 heptad repeats of the CC domain but differ in the numbers of LG subdomains. Thus, the constructs contained the subdomains LG1–5, called α3′LG1–5, the subdomains LG1–3, called α3′LG1–3, the subdomains LG1–2, called α3′LG1–2, or LG1 only, called α3′LG1, with the prime indexing our shorter recombinant constructs as opposed to the wild-type α3 chain (Fig. 1A). All α3′ chains were produced and secreted by transfected HEK 293 cells (Fig. 1B), which do not produce endogenous β3 and γ2 chains. The amount of secreted α3′ chains in the culture medium drastically declined with decreasing numbers of LG subdomains (Fig. 1B), this being particularly evident for the constructs α3′LG1–2 and α3′LG1. When protease inhibitors were added to the culture medium of cells transfected with these α3′ constructs, the yields of proteins in the supernatants clearly increased (Fig. 1B, inset), indicating that they were prone to proteolytic degradation. Nevertheless, ELISA signals shown in the inset of Fig. 1B developed over a much longer time than those in Fig. 1B, and yields of the α3′LG1–2 and α3′LG1 chains were not in adequate amounts for further characterization. Hence, only the isolation of the larger α3′ chains, α3′LG1–5 and α3′LG1–3, was pursued (Fig. 2). Similar to the wild-type α3 chain, the G domain of the α3′LG1–5 construct was specifically cleaved, albeit not completely (lane α3′LG1–5 in Fig. 2), presumably within the sequence connecting the LG3 and LG4 subdomains. This proteolytic processing of the α3′LG1–5 chain was only prevented entirely by a combination of the serine protease inhibitor aprotinin and the BMP-1 isoenzyme inhibitor-1, which is a selective inhibitor for a small family of astacin-like metalloproteases including BMP-1 and the mammalian tolloids. Addition of both protease inhibitors allowed the isolation of the non-processed α3′LG1–5 chains, referred to as np-α3′LG1–5, with an apparent molecular mass of 135 kDa (lane np-α3′LG1–5 in Fig. 2). On the other hand, the partial processing of α3′LG1–5 chain in the cell culture system (lane α3′LG1–5 in Fig. 2) could be brought to completion by in vitro digestion of the isolated chain by plasmin, resulting in the fully processed α3′LG1–5 chain, called fp-α3′LG1–5, with an apparent molecular mass of 90 kDa (lane fp-α3′LG1–5 in Fig. 2). After proteolytic cleavage in the spacer sequence between LG3 and LG4, the LG4–5 tandem domain dissociated from the rest of the α3′ chain (see below and Fig. 7). After its dissociation the tandem domain could be detected in the plasmin digest of the α3′LG1–5 chain by immunoblotting with a specific polyclonal antiserum against LG4–5 domain (lane fp-α3′LG1–5 in Fig. 2C), whereas it seemed to be completely degraded under cell culture conditions (lane α3′LG1–5 in Fig. 2C), showing that proteases other than plasmin are responsible for the degradation of the dissociated LG4–5 tandem repeat in the cell culture medium, although plasmin cleaves th"

A cross-talk between the cGMP and cAMP pathways has been proposed to exist.

Recently, a mouse strain lacking cGKI, which is the PKG isoform normally present in smooth muscle, was generated (7Pfeifer A. Klatt P. Massberg S. Ny L. Sausbier M. Hirneiss C. Wang G.X. Korth M.

Intact smooth muscles of these animals are not relaxed by NO or cGMP, but their responses to cAMP are essentially unaltered (7Pfeifer A. Klatt P. Massberg S. Ny L. Sausbier M. Hirneiss C. Wang G.X.

However, a detailed characterization of the cGMP and cAMP dependencies is difficult in intact tissue in which diffusion and metabolism of nucleotide analogues might influence the responses, and the effects on Ca2+ sensitivity cannot be directly assessed and distinguished from effects on intracellular Ca2+ levels. We have explored cGMP- and cAMP-dependent relaxation mechanisms of smooth muscle using PKG-deficient (cGKI–/–) and wild type (cGKI+/+) mice. The effects of cGMP on intracellular [Ca2+] and force were examined in intact preparations of small intestine. Using α-toxin-permeabilized preparations in which the concentration of free Ca2+ can be held constant, the effects of cGMP and cAMP on Ca2+ sensitivity were examined. The following questions were addressed. 1) Does cGMP-mediated relaxation of agonist-induced contractions of intact intestinal smooth muscle involve a reduction of intracellular [Ca2+], a decreased Ca2+ sensitivity, or both? 2) Is cGMP-induced relaxation of intestinal smooth muscle dependent on PKG? 3) Are cGMP and cAMP able to desensitize the contractile machinery to Ca2+ in the absence of PKG? 4) In what concentration range can cGMP desensitize the contractile system to Ca2+ via PKG-independent (e.g. PKA) pathways? (5Cornwell T.L. Lincoln T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1146-1155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) To what extent can the smooth muscle cells compensate via up-regulation of the related PKA pathway or via resetting of the light chain phosphorylation/dephosphorylation systems for a chronic loss of PKG-activity? A preliminary report of some of these results has been presented previously (26Arner A Bonnevier J Fassler R. Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Biophys. J. 2002; 82 (abstr.): 424Google Scholar). Animals and Smooth Muscle Preparations—PKG knock-out mice (cGKI–/–) and their wild type controls (cGKI+/+) were obtained as described previously (7Pfeifer A. Klatt P. Massberg S. Ny L. Sausbier M. Hirneiss C. Wang G.X. Korth M. Aszodi A. Andersson K.E. Krombach F. Mayerhofer A. Ruth P. Fassler R. Hofmann F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3045-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The animals were killed by cervical dislocation. The distal part of the small intestine was cut in centimeter-long pieces. The longitudinal (external) muscle layer was peeled off using microscope and forceps and mounted for experiments, intact or chemically skinned. Experiments on Intact Preparations—Muscle strips measuring 4 × 1 mm with a thickness of ∼0.05 mm were cut using microscissors and stainless steel surgical blades. The strips were mounted in open organ baths at 22 °C using thin silk thread between a stainless steel pin on an adjustable stand and a Grass FT03 transducer (Grass Instruments, Freeport, IL) for recording of isometric force. The preparations were equilibrated in physiological saline solution (PSS) (solution composition see below) with 1.6 mm Ca2+ for 1 h at a passive tension corresponding to optimal length for active force. In each muscle preparation, a reference contraction was recorded after adding 10 μm carbachol to the PSS. We measured the initial peak (after ∼50 s) and the sustained force (after 20 min) of the contractions. The initial peak force was used as reference for all of the latter force responses. The strips were then relaxed and treated with 100 μm 8Br-cGMP (a cell-permeable cGMP analogue). Preliminary experiments showed that the effect of 8-Br-cGMP was obtained within 5 min. Therefore, we treated the preparations with 8-Br-cGMP for 20 min to ensure full intracellular effect of 8-Br-cGMP. Preparations were then activated with 10 μm carbachol (100 μm 8-Br-cGMP still present). Peak and sustained forces were measured and expressed relative to the reference force. These experiments were carried out on wild type (cGKI+/+) and knock-out mice (cGKI–/–) examined in parallel. Measurements of Intracellular [Ca2+]—Fura-2 technique was used to measure intracellular Ca2+ changes as described previously (27Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 28Himpens B. Somlyo A.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1988; 395: 507-530Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Muscle strips were incubated in 0.5 ml of PSS with 10 μm acetoxymethyl ester of fura-2 (Fura-2/AM) dissolved in Me2SO premixed with Pluronic F127 (final concentrations, 1 and 0.02%, respectively). Prior to loading, the preparations were kept in PSS at 4 °C for 30 min to minimize non-cytosolic compartmentalization of Fura-2/AM (29Roe M.W. Lemasters J.J. Herman B. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Loading was performed under dark conditions at 22 °C for 4 h with gentle shaking. After loading, the muscle strips were thoroughly washed in PSS and mounted with aluminum foil clips on a myograph for measuring isometric tension (DSC-6BE-4-110-force transducer, Eurosensor, London, United Kingdom) in a 1-ml cuvette (22 °C). The set-up was mounted on the stage of an inverted Nikon (TMD) microscope. The preparation was illuminated with alternating wavelengths (340 and 380 nm), and the emitted fura-2 fluorescence was measured through a 500-nm interference filter (bandwidth, 40 nm) and recorded via a ×10 objective using a photomultiplier (R 374, Hamamatsu Photonics). The fluorescence and force signals were recorded with an Analog Devices RTI board and a personal computer. The fluorescence intensities were integrated, and a 340/380 intensity-ratio value was obtained approximately every 50 ms. After mounting, the strips were allowed to equilibrate for ∼30 min. They were then stimulated with carbachol (10 μm). Fluorescence signals and force were recorded during the initial 4 min of the contraction and again after 25 min of stimulation. The strips were then relaxed in PSS, and fluorescence and force were recorded for 1 min. The strips were thereafter treated with 8-Br-cGMP (100 μm) for 20 min followed by a second stimulation with carbachol (10 μm) and recording of fluorescence and force. Experiments on α-Toxin-permeabilized Preparations—The small strips were wrapped at both ends with aluminum foil and mounted horizontally on the extended arm of a force transducer (AE 801, SensoNor a.s., Horten, Norway) and a steel pin enabling length adjustment using small holes in the aluminum. The experiments were performed at room temperature (22 °C) in the surface tension bubble of small plastic cups containing 140 μl of solution. The solution was continuously stirred throughout the experiments using small stirring magnets. The strips were equilibrated for approximately 45 min in HEPES-buffered PSS (see below) before a test contraction using 10 μm carbachol was made. The preparations were permeabilized using α-toxin essentially as described previously (30Kitazawa T. Kobayashi S. Horiuti K. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5339-5342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The strips were thoroughly relaxed in Ca2+-free HEPES-buffered PSS for 10 min. The preparations were transferred to relaxing solution for 5 min before being treated with relaxing solution with Staphylococcus aureus α-toxin (5000–10,000 units/ml) for 45 min. Finally, the preparations were kept 25 min in α-toxin-free relaxing solution containing 10 μm of the calcium ionophore A23187. After the α-toxin-skinning procedure, a reference contraction was recorded in contracting (pCa 4.5) solution. Each strip was held in relaxing solution for 10 min before being exposed to increasing [Ca2+] (pCa 7.0, 6.8, 6.6, 6.4, 6.2, 6.0, and 4.5) for 6 min at each concentration or until a steady force level had been reached. Force was expressed relative to the maximal contraction at pCa 4.5. In separate experiments, permeabilized strips were activated with intermediate [Ca2+] (pCa 6.2) resulting in a submaximal sustained contraction. At the plateau of the contraction, increasing concentrations of 8-Br-cGMP or the cAMP analogue cBIMPS were added to the solution. The drop in force induced by 8-Br-cGMP and cBIMPS was expressed relative to force of the submaximal contraction. In another set of experiments, permeabilized submaximally activated (pCa 6.2) preparations were treated with 10 μm GTPγS. The rise in force induced by GTPγS was expressed relative to force of the submaximal contraction. Solutions—The HEPES-buffered PSS contained (in mm) NaCl 118, KCl 5, Na2HPO4 1.2, MgCl2 1.2, CaCl2 1.6, HEPES 24, and glucose 10. The pH was adjusted to 7.4. The Ca2+-free PSS was made by omitting CaCl2. Prior to use, the PSS was gassed with 100% O2 for at least 15 min. The solutions used for permeabilized preparations were stored at –20 °C until usage. The relaxing solution (pCa 9) contained (in mm) TES 30, phosphocreatine 10, Na2ATP 5.14, magnesium acetate 7.92, K+-methanesulfonate 46.6, and EGTA 10. The maximal contracting solution was made by replacing EGTA with CaEGTA. Ionic strength and free [Mg2+] were held constant by varying [K+-methanesulfonate] and [magnesium acetate]. pH was adjusted to 7.1 at room temperature. [Ca2+] was varied by mixing relaxing and contracting solutions and thereby obtaining the desired CaEGTA/EGTA ratio (30Kitazawa T. Kobayashi S. Horiuti K. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5339-5342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Otto B. Steusloff A. Just I. Aktories K. Pfitzer G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 496: 317-329Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Statistics—All of the values are given as mean ± S.E. with the number of observation within parentheses. Curve fitting was performed using routines in SigmaPlot 2000 (SPSS Inc.). Analysis of variance was performed using Statistica for Windows (StatSoft Inc.). Force recordings from intact longitudinal muscle preparations from the small intestine of wild type (cGKI+/+) and PKG-deficient (cGKI–/–) mice are shown in Fig. 1, panel A. Carbachol (10–5m) evoked a sustained contraction in both cGKI+/+ and cGKI–/– preparations. In the cGKI+/+ mice, a second activation in the presence of 100 μm 8-Br-cGMP resulting in a transient contraction with an initial peak response followed by a sustained force component was markedly inhibited (to ∼20% of the maximal force) and replaced by irregular phasic contractions. The peak force was slightly decreased (to ∼70% of the reference force). In cGKI–/– mice, no effect of 8-Br-cGMP was observed. Fig. 1, panel B, summarizes these results. To explore the mechanisms involved in the cGMP inhibition of force, we measured changes in intracellular [Ca2+] and force in preparations from cGKI+/+ mice before and after treatment with 100 μm 8-Br-cGMP. Fig. 2 shows the transients in force and the 340/380-nm light intensity ratio of fura-2 as a measure of changes in intracellular [Ca2+]. Force after the initial peak was inhibited by 8-Br-cGMP (Fig. 2, panel A). These changes were associated with lowered intracellular [Ca2+] (Fig. 2, panel B). To obtain a measure of the changes in Ca2+ sensitivity of force, we related the force values to the activation-induced increase in 340/380-intensity ratio. The activation-induced increase was calculated by subtracting the fura-2 ratio determined in the relaxed state between contractions from all of the values recorded after activation. As seen in Fig. 2, panel C, the ratio of active force to the fura-2 signal decreased after 8-Br-cGMP treatment, suggesting that the lower sustained force after 8-Br-cGMP treatment involved a decreased sensitivity to Ca2+ as well as a decrease in total intracellular [Ca2+]. As seen in Fig. 2, panel A, activation with carbachol in the absence of 8-Br-cGMP was associated with a second peak of contraction after ∼50 s where the increase of force occurred without an increase in intracellular [Ca2+] (Fig. 2, cf. panels B and C). In the presence of 8-Br-cGMP, the second peak was still present and at approximately the same point in time (note that error bars in the time-direction are within the size of the symbols). The calcium dependence of force was identical in cGKI+/+ and cGKI–/– preparations permeabilized with Staphylococcus aureus α-toxin (Fig. 3A). Force at saturating [Ca2+] was ∼50% carbachol (10–5m) induced force and ∼50% of equal magnitude to high K+ (80 mm KCl) induced responses in the intact muscle for both the cGKI+/+ and cGKI–/– groups. At submaximal [Ca2+] (pCa 6.2), the addition of 10 μm GTPγS was associated with a 2-fold increase in force, indicating increased sensitivity to Ca2+. The responsiveness to GTPγS was similar in cGKI+/+ and cGKI–/– preparations (Fig. 3B). The relaxant effects of 8-Br-cGMP and the cAMP analogue cBIMPS were examined at a submaximal Ca2+ concentration (pCa 6.2), giving ∼50% of the force at saturating [Ca2+]. As seen in the Fig. 4, upper panel, the cGKI+/+ preparations relaxed in a dose-dependent manner in response to increasing concentrations of the cGMP analogue. If cGKI+/+ or cGKI–/– preparations were exposed to 100 μm 8-Br-cGMP at maximal [Ca2+] (pCa 4.5). no effect on force was noted, suggesting that the inhibition of force observed at submaximal [Ca2+] was because of a change in Ca2+ sensitivity rather than a general effect on force generation. Preparations from cGKI–/– mice relaxed to a small extent in response to maximal [8-Br-cGMP] (100 μm). Similar experiments were performed using the cAMP analogue cBIMPS. Fig. 5 summarizes the effects of 8-Br-cGMP and cBIMPS on force at submaximal Ca2+. The cGKI+/+ preparations relaxed in response to 8-Br-cGMP with an apparent half-maximal response (EC50) ∼50 nm. The cGKI–/– preparations relaxed slightly at the highest concentrations of 8-Br-cGMP. The estimated EC50 for 8-Br-cGMP (Fig. 5, panel C) was >250 times higher (EC50 ∼10 μm), and the maximal extent of relaxation was ∼50% in the cGKI–/– compared with the cGKI+/+ preparations. The relaxant responses to 8-Br-cGMP in the cGKI+/+ preparations (Fig. 5, open circles, panel A) deviated from the fitted dose-response relationship. No saturation was reached at the highest concentrations. If we assume that the additional relaxation at higher 8-Br-cGMP concentrations is the result of a cGKI-independent mechanism similar to that responsible for the small relaxation in the cGKI–/– preparations, we can obtain an estimate of the 8-Br-cGMP dependence of the cGKI by correcting for this component. Therefore, cGMP responses from cGKI–/– were subtracted from the cGKI+/+ responses, rendering a modified relationship (Fig. 5, panel A, open squares), which was adequately described by a hyperbolic relationship with EC50 ∼10 nm. The cAMP analogue cBIMPS relaxed both cGKI+/+ and cGKI–/– preparations with an EC50 of ∼1 μm to a similar maximal extent in both the cGKI–/– and cGKI+/+ preparations. In cBIMPS experiments, concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 μm were examined. The lowest concentration gave ∼50% of the relaxant response, and no differences were observed between the cGKI+/+ and the cGKI–/– preparations. The maximal extent of relaxation at saturating [cBIMPS] was identical in the two groups. The relaxant effect of cGMP in intact smooth muscle of the small intestine involves a decrease in intracellular [Ca2+] as well as a reduced Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile activation. We show using α-toxin-permeabilized preparations of cGKI–/– mice that the Ca2+-desensitizing effect of 8-Br-cGMP in small intestinal smooth muscle is dependent on activation of PKG. In the lower cGMP concentration range (<1 μm), the tissues lacking PKG did not relax. The experiments on cGKI–/– tissues enabled us to correct for PKG-independent effects without using pharmacological tools, and we determined the EC50 value for 8-Br-cGMP to ∼10 nm in the intestinal smooth muscle. This EC50 value corresponds well to the apparent activation constants (Ka) estimated for the purified cGMP kinase (18 and 71 nm, for types I α and I β) (32Kawada T. Toyosato A. Islam M.O. Yoshida Y. Imai S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 323: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and with the EC50 value in permeabilized rabbit femoral artery preparations (8 nm) (17Lee M.R. Li L. Kitazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5063-5068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). At high concentrations (10 and 100 μm), a small relaxant effect of 8-Br-cGMP was also observed in cGKI–/– animals. One likely mechanism is that 8-Br-cGMP activates cAMP-dependent kinase at these higher concentrations. Using the cGKI–/– tissues where PKG is completely absent, we estimate the EC50 value for this mechanism to be ∼10 μm, which is consistent with the Ka values of 8-Br-cGMP for purified cAMP-dependent kinase (6.3 μm) (32Kawada T. Toyosato A. Islam M.O. Yoshida Y. Imai S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 323: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the action of cGMP is partially mediated by the activation of PKA (23Cornwell T.L. Arnold E. Boerth N.J. Lincoln T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1405-C1413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data from intestinal muscle show that a maximal Ca2+ desensitization via PKG can be achieved at concentrations not activating PKG-independent pathways. In view of the almost 1000-fold difference in EC50 values, it seems unlikely that a substantial cross-activation of PKA by cGMP contributes to Ca2+ desensitization. However, in extreme situations, e.g. in response to large doses of NO donors, cGMP appears to be able to reach levels high enough to activate PKA and contribute to relaxation by desensitization (8Sausbier M. Schubert R. Voigt V. Hirneiss C. Pfeifer A. Korth M. Kleppisch T. Ruth P. Hofmann F. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 825-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Because cGMP, even at 100 μm, failed to relax intact carbachol activated cGKI–/– tissues, we conclude that PKA and other PKG-independent relaxation mechanisms are not involved in the 8-Br-cGMP-induced relaxation in this case. It has also been suggested that cAMP can cross-activate PKG and that PKG activation might contribute to the responses at high cAMP levels (21Lincoln T.M. Cornwell T.L. Taylor A.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C399-C407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Jiang H. Colbran J.L. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1015-1019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The EC50 values for the cAMP analogue cBIMPS appeared essentially unaltered in the cGKI–/– compared with cGKI+/+ tissues. We did not examine the cBIMPS responses in the very low concentration range, although we obtained measurements at the estimated EC50 values in both cGKI–/– and cGKI+/+ tissues. Thus, our data do not suggest a major involvement of PKG in the cAMP-mediated relaxation, although a minor cross-talk of cAMP with PKG in the submicromolar range cannot be ruled out. A chronic lack of PKG activity in the cGKI–/– mice is associated with significant alterations in animal physiology (7Pfeifer A. Klatt P. Massberg S. Ny L. Sausbier M. Hirneiss C. Wang G.X. Korth M. Aszodi A. Andersson K.E. Krombach F. Mayerhofer A. Ruth P. Fassler R. Hofmann F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3045-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Young (32 days) cGKI–/– animals are hypertensive, which could reflect a lack of PKG-mediated relaxation of blood vessels. The gastrointestinal tract is altered with distension of cecum, signs of pyloric stenosis, and hypertrophy of the gastric fundus. Furthermore, erectile function is impaired (25Hedlund P. Aszodi A. Pfeifer A. Alm P. Hofmann F. Ahmad M. Fassler R. Andersson K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 2349-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Using α-toxin-permeabilized preparations where the intracellular signaling systems are intact, we could examine the Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile system. The Ca2+ dependence of force and small G-protein-mediated Ca2+ sensitization were identical in cGKI–/– and cGKI+/+ animals. Thus, the long term changes in signaling magnitude of the PKG pathway does not lead to changes in Ca2+ sensitivity nor in the ability to increase Ca2+ sensitivity via the Rho-Rho kinase pathway. Furthermore, the related PKA relaxation pathway is not up-regulated as a compensatory mechanism in the cGKI–/– animals, showing that the cellular activities of PKA and PKG pathways are independently regulated. In conclusion, we have determined the EC50 for 8-Br-cGMP and PKG to 10 nm in intestinal smooth muscle. Cross-activation of PKA occurs at 1000-fold higher concentrations. Long term removal of PKG is not associated with up-regulation of PKA activity, showing that the activities of the PKA and PKG are independently regulated in a long term perspective. The signaling pathway, rhoA-myosin light chain phosphatase, targeted during PKG-induced desensitization to Ca2+ is unaffected by chronic loss of PKG."

The Escherichia coli γ complex loads the β sliding clamp onto DNA in an ATP-dependent reaction in which ATP binding and hydrolysis modulate the affinity of the γ complex for β and DNA. This is the second of two reports (Williams, C. R., Snyder, A. K., Kuzmič, P., O'Donnell, M., and Bloom, L. B. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 4376–4385) addressing the question of how ATP binding and hydrolysis regulate specific interactions with DNA and β. Mutations were made to an Arg residue in a conserved SRC motif in the δ′ and γ subunits that interacts with the ATP site of the neighboring γ subunit. Mutation of the δ′ subunit reduced the ATP-dependent β binding activity, whereas mutation of the γ subunits reduced the DNA binding activity of the γ complex. The γ complex containing the δ′ mutation gave a pre-steady-state burst of ATP hydrolysis, but at a reduced rate and amplitude relative to the wild-type γ complex. A pre-steady-state burst of ATP hydrolysis was not observed for the complex containing the γ mutations, consistent with the reduced DNA binding activity of this complex. The differential effects of these mutations suggest that ATP binding at the γ1 site may be coupled to conformational changes that largely modulate interactions with β, whereas ATP binding at the γ2 and/or γ3 site may be coupled to conformational changes that have a major role in interactions with DNA. Additionally, these results show that the “arginine fingers” play a structural role in facilitating the formation of a conformation that has high affinity for β and DNA.

Sliding clamps tether DNA polymerases to their templates, enabling the polymerases to rapidly incorporate thousands of nucleotides into a growing polymer without dissociating from DNA. Crystal structures of sliding clamps from bacteria, bacteriophage, and humans have revealed a mechanism by which this is possible (1Kong X.-P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J.

Sliding clamps are composed of individual subunits that assemble into rings with a central opening large enough to encircle duplex DNA. These ring-shaped clamps must be assembled on DNA by the activity of a clamp loader that uses energy derived from ATP to power its mechanical task (reviewed in Ref. 5O'Donnell M. Jeruzalmi D. Kuriyan J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R935-R946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, the clamp loader is composed of seven subunits, three copies of the dnaX gene product, δ, δ′, χ, and Ψ (6Maki S. Kornberg K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6555-6560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Naktinis V. Turner J. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6536-6545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DnaX proteins form the motor of the clamp loader, and each is capable of binding and hydrolyzing 1 molecule of ATP during the clamp loading process. In vivo, two forms of the DnaX protein are produced: a full-length gene product (τ) and a truncated gene product (γ) with the same sequence, but only about two-thirds the length of τ (9Blinkowa A.L. Walker J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1725-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 10Tsuchihashi Z. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The clamp loader at the replication fork most likely contains two copies of the τ subunit and a single copy of γ (7Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Naktinis V. Turner J. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13348-13357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 8Pritchard A.E. Dallman H.G. Glover B.P. McHenry C.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6536-6545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The unique C-terminal end present in τ interacts with other enzymes and coordinates the activities present at the replication fork, whereas the N-terminal domain shared by the τ and γ subunits provides the activities required for clamp loading. Thus, the γ complex containing three copies of the γ subunit is fully active as a clamp loader. For the γ complex to catalyze the assembly of clamps on DNA, its interactions with the clamp and DNA must change during the course of a single clamp loading reaction. The γ complex must bind β and DNA with high affinity to bring the two macromolecules together, but then its affinity must be reduced so that it can release the clamp on DNA. ATP binding and hydrolysis promote conformational changes within the γ complex that expose and then mask binding sites for the clamp and DNA to modulate its affinity for these macromolecules. Biochemical and structural studies have identified a distinct β-interacting element on the δ subunit (12Naktinis V. Onrust R. Fang F. O'Donnell M. J. Biol.

In contrast, no single subunit has been shown to bind DNA with high affinity, and a DNA-binding domain within the γ complex has not yet been identified. The γ, δ, and δ′ subunits form the heart of the clamp loader, and a γ3δδ′ complex is capable of loading clamps onto DNA in an ATP-dependent reaction (18Onrust R. Stukenberg P.T. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21681-21686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Onrust R. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11766-11772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Olson M.W.

The five subunits in the γ3δδ′ complex are arranged in a ring (21Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 429-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Each of the five subunits is composed of three domains that form a C-shape. These subunits are arranged in parallel, where the C-terminal domains are aligned on one end of the complex and the N-terminal domains on the other (see Fig. 1A). The major intersubunit contacts responsible for forming the ring are made between the C-terminal domains. The three domains that are present in each subunit are connected by flexible linker regions that allow movement of the N-terminal domains relative to the more rigidly fixed C-terminal domains. The β-interacting element is located on the N-terminal domain of δ and is physically blocked by the δ′ subunit (13Jeruzalmi D. Yurieva O. Zhao Y. Young M. Stewart J. Hingorani M. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 417-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 21Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 429-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of γ3δδ′ suggests a mechanism whereby successive movement of each of the N-terminal domains upon binding ATP would expose this region of δ, increasing the affinity of the γ complex for β (depicted in Fig. 1A). Like the complete clamp loader, the γ3δδ′ complex contains three ATP-binding sites located in the N-terminal domains of the γ subunits (22Podobnik M. Weitze T.F. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Structure. 2003; 11: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These ATP-binding sites are located at the interfaces of adjacent subunits within the pentameric ring. The ATP-binding site of γ1 is located at the δ′-γ1 interface, that of γ2 at the γ1-γ2 interface, and that of γ3 at the γ2-γ3 interface (see Fig. 1). The subunits adjacent to the ATP-binding sites project an Arg residue toward the binding site. This Arg residue is part of a conserved SRC sequence motif that is found in other clamp loaders and that has been proposed to be analogous to the “arginine finger” of GTPase-activating proteins that stimulate GTP hydrolysis (21Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 429-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 23Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Chem. 2003; 278: 14406-14413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of these Arg residues in the γ complex has demonstrated that they do contribute to ATP hydrolysis (25Johnson A. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14406-14413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This architecture of the ATP sites within the complex explains how ATP binding to individual γ subunits may be communicated to adjacent subunits to promote coordinated conformational changes within the entire complex. This is the second of two reports (37Williams C.R. Snyder A.K. Kuzmič P. O'Donnell M. Bloom L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4376-4385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) addressing the question of how ATP binding and hydrolysis are coupled to changes in the γ complex that affect its interactions with β and DNA. Our approach was to assess the role of ATP at individual sites within the γ complex by characterizing the effects of mutations of the Arg residues within the conserved SRC motifs on the activities of the γ complex. Due to the asymmetry in the γ complex, two distinct types of ATP-binding sites are present: one at a δ′-γ interface and two at γ-γ interfaces. Site-directed mutagenesis of Arg in the SRC motif of δ′ affects the ATP site at the δ′-γ1 interface, whereas site-directed mutagenesis of the Arg residues in the γ subunits affect the ATP sites at the γ1-γ2 and γ2-γ3 interfaces (Fig. 1B). Our results show that these two classes of mutations have differential effects on the interactions of the γ complex with β and DNA and suggest that one subset of ATP sites is important for regulating the interaction with β, whereas the second subset is important for regulating the interaction with DNA. The materials and methods that were used are described in the accompanying article (37Williams C.R. Snyder A.K. Kuzmič P. O'Donnell M. Bloom L.B. J. Biol.

Enzymes—Site-directed mutagenesis, protein purification, and assembly of mutant γ complexes were done as described previously (25Johnson A. O'Donnell M. J. Biol.

Protein Concentrations—Concentrations of wild-type and mutant γ complexes were determined using a Bradford-type assay (Bio-Rad protein assay) with a bovine serum albumin standard.

Anisotropy Measurements in Equilibrium and Steady-state Assays—A QuantaMaster QM-1 fluorometer (Photon Technology International) equipped with a 75-watt xenon arc lamp, an excitation monochromator, and dual emission monochromators was used for steady-state anisotropy measurements. Samples were excited with vertically polarized light, and emission of vertically (IVV) and horizontally (IVH) polarized light was measured simultaneously in a T-format. Anisotropy (r) was calculated from polarized intensities as described in the accompanying article (37Williams C.R. Snyder A.K. Kuzmič P. O'Donnell M. Bloom L.B. J. Biol.

There were no changes in the total intensities of RhX and pyrene as a function of the γ complex concentration, indicating that there were no changes in effective quantum yields during the course of the experiment. Therefore, anisotropy changes can be interpreted simply in terms of changes in rotational motion (26Otto M.R. Lillo M.P. Beechem J.M. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 2511-2521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 27Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1999: 291-320Crossref Google Scholar). RhX was excited at 580 nm, and its emission was measured at 610 nm. Pyrene was excited at 345 nm, and its emission was measured at 375 nm. Labeling of β—β was labeled with N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide as described by Griep and McHenry (28Griep M.A. McHenry C.S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5210-5215Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Labeled protein was purified from free pyrenylmaleimide by gel filtration chromatography using Bio-Gel P6DG resin (Bio-Rad) and elution buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5). Fractions containing β eluted in the void volume and were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. β Binding Assay—The anisotropy of pyrene on β was measured in separate assays containing constant concentrations of β and ATP and a range of γ complex concentrations. At each γ complex concentration, 82 μl of assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) was placed in a cuvette, and background signals were measured. Each of the reagents was then added sequentially, and polarized intensities were measured after each addition. First, β (4 μl) was added to obtain a signal for free β; the γ complex (10 μl) was added to obtain a signal for the ATP-independent binding reaction (total volume of 96 μl); and finally, ATP (4 μl) was added to obtain a signal for the ATP-dependent interaction. Final concentrations were calculated based on the total volume (100 μl) after addition of ATP. Two independent experiments were done for each γ complex, and one of the two is shown in Fig. 3. Dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated by fitting the titration data to Equation 1,robs=(Kd+βo+γc)-(Kd+βo+γc)2-4βoγc2βo(rb-rf)+rf(Eq. 1) where robs is the observed anisotropy; βo and γc are the initial concentrations of β and γ complex, respectively; and rb and rf are the anisotropy values for bound and free pyrene-labeled β, respectively. The value of rf was set to the experimentally determined value of 0.140, and values of rb were determined by fitting data for the γ complex, β, and ATP in Fig. 3 (A and C). The value of rb (0.204) obtained from these fits was fixed in experiments in which data did not reach this saturating value. DNA Binding Assay—The anisotropy of an RhX probe on a single-stranded oligonucleotide 50 nucleotides in length was measured in assays in which the γ complex concentration was varied and the DNA, β, and ATP concentrations were kept constant. Sequential additions were made as described for β binding assays. At each γ complex concentration, background signals were obtained for buffer and ATP (82 μl) prior to adding DNA (4 μl) to obtain a signal for free DNA. A signal for γ complex binding was obtained upon addition of the γ complex (10 μl for a total volume of 96 μl), and then β (4 μl) was added. Final concentrations were calculated based on the total volume (100 μl) after addition of β. These assays are not truly equilibrium binding assays because the γ complex hydrolyzes ATP at a significant rate in a DNA-dependent reaction. In these experiments, the concentration of ATP was sufficiently high that the fraction of DNA bound did not change during the course of our measurements. Two independent measurements were made, and one is shown. Steady-state Clamp Loading Assays—These assays were performed using the procedure described for DNA binding assays, but with the substitution of primed template DNA for ssDNA. Data are shown for measurements made after addition of all components (DNA, the γ complex, and β). Kinetics of ATP Hydrolysis by the Wild-type γ Complex and SRC Mutants—An earlier study demonstrated that γ complexes containing δ′R158A and γR169A mutations formed stable complexes that bound 3 molecules of ATP; however, the rates of ATP hydrolysis by the mutant complexes were reduced in steady-state assays (25Johnson A. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14406-14413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this work, hydrolysis of ATP under pre-steady-state conditions was measured for the wild-type γ complex (γc-WT), the γ complex containing a mutation of Arg-158 to Ala in the δ′ subunit (γc-δ′R158A), and the γ complex containing a mutation of Arg-169 to Ala in each γ subunit (γc-γR169A) in the absence of β using the assay based on the fluorescence of E. coli phosphate-binding protein covalently labeled at Cys-197 with N-(2-(1-maleimidyl)ethyl)-7-(diethyl-amino)coumarin-3-carboxamide (MDCC-PBP) described in the accompanying article (37Williams C.R. Snyder A.K. Kuzmič P. O'Donnell M. Bloom L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4376-4385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The increase in MDCC fluorescence that occurs upon binding the inorganic phosphate product of ATP hydrolysis is measured in real time. Sequential mixing assays were performed by incubating each of the γ complexes (0.25 μm) with ATP (400 μm) for 0.5 s prior to adding primed template DNA (1.0 μm) and MDCC-PBP (4.0 μm) to give the final concentrations indicated (Fig. 2). The primed template DNA substrate consisted of a 30-nucleotide primer annealed to a 105-nucleotide template (the sequence is given under “Experimental Procedures”). γc-δ′R158A gave an initial lag, followed by a relatively rapid monophasic increase in fluorescence resulting from a presteady-state burst of ATP hydrolysis that was complete in ∼600–700 ms (Fig. 2, middle trace). This burst phase preceded a slower linear increase due to steady-state hydrolysis. γc-WT gave a biphasic increase in fluorescence during the pre-steady-state phase of the hydrolysis reaction, followed by a slower linear increase during the steady-state phase (Fig. 2, upper trace). For γc-WT, the first pre-steady-state phase was complete in ∼80–100 ms, and the second phase continued until ∼700 ms. In contrast, γc-γR169A, the γ complex containing three γR169A mutations, showed only a linear increase in fluorescence, indicating that no burst of product formation occurred (Fig. 2, lower trace). The γc-δ′R158A Mutant Has Reduced Affinity for the β Clamp—To further characterize the effects of mutations of Arg residues within conserved SRC motifs on the activity of the γ complex, the binding of wild-type and mutant complexes to β was measured under equilibrium conditions. An anisotropy-based assay in which β was covalently labeled with N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide was used to measure these protein-protein interactions. Previous studies in another laboratory have demonstrated that β is specifically labeled at one of its four cysteines (Cys-333) with thiol-reactive probes, including pyrenylmaleimide (28Griep M.A. McHenry C.S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5210-5215Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This Cys residue is located on the opposite face of β to which the γ complex and core polymerase bind (1Kong X.-P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 29Naktinis V. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1996; 84: 137-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Control experiments in our laboratory demonstrated that labeling β did not affect its activity in replication assays (data not shown), as has been reported by others (28Griep M.A. McHenry C.S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5210-5215Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 30Leu F.P. Georgescu R. O'Donnell M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 315-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The anisotropy of pyrene increased when the γ complex bound β and decreased its rate of rotational diffusion. The observed anisotropy is a population-weighted average of free and bound species, enabling binding constants to be determined from titration experiments. Binding assays contained a constant concentration of β (30 nm) and a range of γ complex concentrations from 0 to ∼500 μm (Fig. 3). At each γ complex concentration, components were successively added to the cuvette, and the anisotropy of pyrene was measured following each addition. First, β was added to a cuvette containing assay buffer to obtain a signal for free β (Fig. 3, closed squares); the γ complex was added to obtain a signal for the ATP-independent binding reaction (open circles); and finally, ATP was added to measure a signal for the ATP-dependent binding reaction (closed circles). This titration procedure provides internal controls for each measurement and directly shows whether addition of any one component increases the anisotropy of the probe. The interaction between β and γc-WT was ∼3 orders of magnitude weaker in the absence of ATP than in its presence, as has been reported (12Naktinis V. Onrust R. Fang F. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13358-13365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The average dissociation constants (Kd) with S.D. values determined from two independent experiments were 0.10 ± 0.05 and 151 ± 6 nm for γc-WT in the presence and absence of ATP, respectively. Values of 3.2 nm and 2.8 μm have been reported previously for γ complex binding of β in the presence and absence of ATP, respectively (12Naktinis V. Onrust R. Fang F. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13358-13365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). 2Due to signal-to-noise limitations of this experiment, concentrations of pyrene-labeled β less than ∼20–30 nm could not be used. The high concentration of β relative to the Kd determined for γc-WT in the presence of ATP means that there is likely to be significant error associated with this value even though it is experimentally reproducible (Kd = 0.10 ± 0.05 for two independent experiments). Ideally, the equilibrium binding constants should be measured at concentrations within about a factor of 10 of the Kd value. Based on our values and those reported previously (12Naktinis V. Onrust R. Fang F. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13358-13365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), the Kd for γc-WT binding to β in the presence of ATP is clearly in the low nanomolar range and ∼3 orders of magnitude lower than the Kd value in the absence of ATP. In the absence of ATP, the affinities of the mutant γ complexes were not significantly different from that of γc-WT; average Kd values (with S.D.) of 123 ± 1 and 220 ± 35 nm were calculated from two independent experiments for γc-δ′R158A and γc-γR169A, respectively. In contrast, larger differences in affinities were observed in the ATP-dependent binding interactions. Most significantly, the affinity of γc-δ′R158A for β did not increase appreciably; the Kd decreased to 51 ± 4 nm in the presence of ATP, a <3-fold change. Addition of ATP to the γc-γR169A mutant increased its binding to β to a greater degree. The value of its Kd decreased by a factor of ∼20 to 10 ± 8 nm, a change that is more comparable with that for γc-WT. The γc-γR169A Mutant Has Reduced Affinity for DNA— Binding experiments with β demonstrated that mutation of the SRC motif in δ′ had a different effect on the β binding activity of the γ complex than mutation of the SRC motifs in the γ subunits. To determine whether these mutations could also affect the DNA binding activity of the γ complex, the association of wild-type and mutant γ complexes with DNA was measured in a second fluorescence anisotropy-based assay. An ssDNA substrate 50 nucleotides in length was covalently labeled with RhX on the 5′-end (ssDNA-RhX). Assays contained constant concentrations of ssDNA-RhX (50 nm) and β (800 nm, when present) and a range of γ complex concentrations. In these experiments, each component was added sequentially to a cuvette containing ATP and buffer, and polarized intensities were measured after each addition. For each γ complex concentration, ssDNA-RhX was added to the cuvette first (Fig. 4, closed squares), followed by the γ complex (open circles) and finally β (closed c"

Combined HPLC and mass spectrometric analysis has enabled us to detect in tissues of C. reflexa two new types of xanthophylls: lutein-5,6-epoxide and 9-cis-violaxanthin. We have isolated the LHCIIb complex from thylakoids and analyzed chlorophyll and carotenoid composition. The data show that the 9-cis-violaxanthin is present in amounts similar to that of neoxanthin in most plants. On the other hand, lutein-5,6-epoxide was found to be in substoichiometric quantities, suggesting a peripheral location similar to the loosely-associated all-trans-violaxanthin and also enabling suitable accessibility for the de-epoxidase (VDE). Absorption spectroscopy revealed close similarities of the excited state energies of neoxanthin and 9-cis-violaxanthin in vitro and in intact LHCIIb complex. Resonance Raman analysis clearly indicates a cis conformation of violaxanthin in the complex, confirming the pigment analysis data and proving that not only does violaxanthin replace neoxanthin as an intrinsic component of LHCIIb in C. reflexa but it also adopts the same 9-cis conformation of neoxanthin. These results suggest that the N1 binding site of LHCIIb preferentially binds 9-cis-5,6-epoxy carotenoids, which has implications for the features of this binding site and its role in the photosystem II antenna assembly and stability.

In autotrophic higher plants, the first process of photosynthesis, the absorption of light, is carried out primarily by an array of pigment-binding proteins called the light-harvesting complexes (LHCs). 1The abbreviations used are: LHCIIbthe major light harvesting complex of photosystem IIPSIIphotosystem IIBBYPSII preparationVDEviolaxanthin deepoxidaseXCxanthophyll cycleRRresonance RamanHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. With very few exceptions, these complexes bind a predictable set of pigments, namely the chlorophylls a and b, the β,ϵ-carotenoid lutein and the β,β-carotenoids neoxanthin and violaxanthin. the major light harvesting complex of photosystem II photosystem II PSII preparation violaxanthin deepoxidase xanthophyll cycle resonance Raman high performance liquid chromatography. The major LHC of photosystem II, termed the LHCIIb, is the most studied of the LHC systems. It contains more than 40% of all the pigments bound within photosynthetic membranes (2Peter G.F. Thornber J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16745-16754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the membrane LHCIIb exist in a form of a trimer, which is fairly stable in vitro. Biochemical analyses of purified LHCIIb trimers have shown they bind two molecules of lutein, one of neoxanthin and a substoichiometric quantity of violaxanthin per protein monomer (3Bassi R. Pineau B Dainese P. Marquardt J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 4Ruban A.V. Lee P.J. Wentworth M. Andrews J.Y. Horton P. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 616-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The binding sites of these carotenoids within the LHCIIb protein complex have been identified and appear to be highly carotenoid-specific. Electron crystallography indicates that two lutein molecules take on a crossbrace formation and are bound at sites L1 and L2 associated with the two membrane-spanning α-helixes (6Kuhlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Nature. 1991; 350: 130-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 7Kuhlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis experiments suggest that the neoxanthin binding site, N1, is associated with the more peripheral transmembrane helix C (8Croce R. Remelli R. Varotto C. Breton J. Bassi R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The location of the violaxanthin binding site, V1, is less clear, but it appears to be peripheral to the complex with a binding strength which is less than either L1, L2, or N1 and which depends largely on the oligomeric state of the LHCIIb complex (4Ruban A.V. Lee P.J. Wentworth M. Andrews J.Y. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10458-10465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 5Hobe S. Niemeier H. Bender A. Paulsen H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 616-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Higher levels of V1 occupation have been observed in plants grown under high light environments that enhance the amount of violaxanthin in antenna compared with those for plants grown under low light (9Verhoeven A.S. Adams III W.W. Demmig-Adams B. Croce R. Bassi R. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This environmentally dependent binding of violaxanthin to LHCIIb reflects a role of violaxanthin in the xanthophyll cycle and the plant requirements for photoprotective energy dissipation (10Niyogi K.K. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 333-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar). In LHCIIb, lutein bound in the L1 and L2 sites interact mainly with chlorophyll a and may perform a photoprotective role through chlorophyll triplet quenching (11Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29613-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Of these two sites, L1 appears to be specifically important for correct protein folding and maintaining protein stability (11Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29613-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 12Plumley F.G. Schmidt G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1999; 96: 10056-10061Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Neoxanthin, like lutein, is tightly bound and not easily removed from the purified protein (4Ruban A.V. Lee P.J. Wentworth M. Andrews J.Y. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10458-10465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) where it occupies the N1 binding site regardless of the growth conditions experienced by the plant. Evidence from biochemical, spectrophotometric and mutagenesis analyses indicate that neoxanthin in the N1 binding site correlates with chlorophyll b molecules (4Ruban A.V. Lee P.J. Wentworth M. Andrews J.Y. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10458-10465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 11Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29613-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the close stoichiometric relationship between chlorophyll b and neoxanthin found in chlorophyll b-containing photosynthetic tissue (15Bungard R.A McNeil D. Morton J.D. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1997; 24: 205-214Google Scholar, 16Plumley F.G. Schmidt G.W. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 689-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the L1 site, the occupation of the N1 binding site of LHCIIb is not essential for protein folding (5Hobe S. Niemeier H. Bender A. Paulsen H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 616-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 11Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29613-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, monomerization of trimers in vitro results in significant losses of neoxanthin (as well as chlorophyll b) and decreased affinity of binding, suggesting a possible role for the N1 neoxanthin in maintaining trimer stability (4Ruban A.V. Lee P.J. Wentworth M. Andrews J.Y. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10458-10465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Indeed, thylakoids isolated from xanthophyll mutants of Arabidopsis lacking neoxanthin exhibit very low levels of trimers in non-denaturing gels (17Tardy F. Havaux M. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. 1996; 34: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 18Hurry V. Anderson J.M. Chow W.S. Osmond C.B. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 639-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 19Lokstein H. Tian L. Polle J.E.W. DellaPenna D. BBA-Bioenergetics. 2002; 1553: 309-319Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar). It is also interesting to note that the minor PSII antenna complexes, CP29, CP26 and, in particular, CP24 have reduced amounts of neoxanthin, if any, and do not form trimers in vivo or in vitro (20Bassi R. Caffarri S. Photosynth. Res. 2000; 64: 243-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). LHCIIb reconstitution experiments and analyses of antenna preparations from mutant plants lacking neoxanthin demonstrate that the neoxanthin-binding site is not occupied by other xanthophylls (11Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29613-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 17Tardy F. Havaux M. J. Photochem. Photobiol.

Tian L. Polle J.E.W. DellaPenna D. BBA-Bioenergetics. 2002; 1553: 309-319Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These observations suggest a high specificity of the N1 site for neoxanthin. In previous work, we described the unusual carotenoid composition of the parasitic angiosperm Cuscuta reflexa. This plant lacks neoxanthin and instead contains an unusually high concentration of lutein-5,6-epoxide while maintaining photosynthetic capacity and LHCIIb trimers that are otherwise largely indistinguishable from the neoxanthin-containing complexes found in all other higher plants studied to date (1Bungard R.A.

Jeschke W.D. Scholes J.D. Quick W.P. Planta. 1998; 205: 506-513Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the present work we identify another xanthophyll, 9-cis-violaxanthin, present in unusually high concentrations in C. reflexa thylakoids. Also, we further analyzed the biochemical and spectral properties of isolated LHCIIb to establish which carotenoid, if any, replaces neoxanthin in this plant. Alternative carotenoid binding in the N1 site of LHCIIb provides new insights into xanthophyll binding site specificity and its implications for LHCIIb structure and function. We also identify novel types of peripherally associated antenna xanthophylls and their participation in the xanthophyll cycle. Plant Material and Experimental Conditions—Plant material from C. reflexa Roxb. (dodder) used for HPLC/MS pigment analysis and thylakoid preparations from which LHCIIb protein was subsequently isolated was grown on Coleus blumei L. as the host species. Host plants were grown in peat-based potting mix in a glasshouse with temperatures in the range 18–32 °C (but most often between 22 and 26 °C) under natural light supplemented by metal halide lamps for 3 h at the beginning and end of the day to give a total day-length of 16 h. Spinach plant material used in similar analysis was obtained fresh from a market. Thylakoid and LHCII Isolation—Thylakoids were prepared from C. reflexa stems and spinach leaves as described previously (1Bungard R.A. Ruban A.V. Hibberd J.M. Press M.C. Horton P. Scholes J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1135-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thylakoid extracts were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at –80 °C. LHCs were purified from thylakoids by isoelectric focusing as previously described (22Ruban A.V. Young A. Pascal A. Horton P. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The protein band identified as enriched in LHCIIb was further purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation as described in by Ruban et al. (23Ruban A.V. Phillip D. Young A. Horton P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7855-7859Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), except that sucrose gradients were comprised of six sucrose layers of 0.2–0.7 m in 0.1 m increments. LHCIIb monomers were prepared by phospholipase A2 treatment of LHCIIb trimers for 36 h in the presence of 20 mm CaCl2 at a chlorophyll concentration of 0.5 mm, followed by purification on a sucrose gradient as described previously (4Ruban A.V. Lee P.J. Wentworth M. Andrews J.Y. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10458-10465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). HPLC/MS Analysis of Pigments—The carotenoids and chlorophyll composition of intact tissue and LHCIIb were analyzed by HPLC/MS with HPLC coupled to positive-ion, atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation mass spectrometry (APCI-MS). For this analysis, a Waters 2790 HPLC system (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA) was coupled to a Micromass LCT Time-of-Flight mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation). The HPLC separation of carotenoids was achieved by a protocol modified from Bungard et al. (15Bungard R.A McNeil D. Morton J.D. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1997; 24: 205-214Google Scholar), with modifications designed to resolve isomer fractions among the xanthophyll pigments. Reverse-phase HPLC was carried out on a 100 mm × 8 mm Waters NovaPak C18 radial compression column (4-micron particle size; Waters Corporation), preceded by two guard columns (4 mm × 2 mm C18; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). Entire plant tissue and LHCIIb samples were extracted by grinding or homogenizing in 100% acetone followed by centrifugation and filtration through a 0.2-μm pore size nylon syringe filter. Samples (40 μl) were injected by a Waters Alliance 2790 Autosampler (Waters Corporation). A three-step solvent system was employed to separate pigments. First, the xanthophyll pigments were eluted with 1.0 ml min–1 acetonitrile and methanol (92:8) over 17 min. This was followed by the application of a 1-min linear gradient to 2.0 ml min–1 acetonitrile and ethyl acetate (68:32), which was then maintained for 3.5 min to elute chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b. Finally, β-carotene was eluted by the application of a 3-min linear gradient to a mixture of ethyl acetate and hexane (50:50) also at 2.0 ml min–1, which was maintained for 1.5 min. Separated pigments from the HPLC were run directly through a Water 996 PDA (Waters Corporation) for spectrophotometric analysis and then into the mass spectrometer. In the APCI-MS analysis, the temperature of the ion source was maintained at 80 °C. Nitrogen drying (or bath) gas was used at a flow rate of 560 liters h–1 and the probe heated to 400 °C. The APCI carrier gas was nitrogen and an optimum combination of fragmentation and ion current was obtained at a Carona voltage of 4000 V. The range 100 m/z to 2500 m/z was scanned over ∼75 μs with 0.9 s of data being summed into one mass scan. Carotenoids were identified and quantified by comparing absorption spectra and retention times with published data and purified standards, and by analysis of furanoid re-arrangements and iodine-catalyzed isomerization products together with mass data obtained through APCI-MS analysis. For the furanoid re-arrangement of carotenoids, around 5–10 nmol of pure carotenoid was dissolved in 100% acetone at room temperature and 1 μl of a 1% HCl solution in water was added. For the carotenoid isomerization, around 5–10 nmol of pure carotenoid was dissolved in 0.5 ml of 100% benzene and 2.5 μl of 100% benzene containing 0.2 mm iodine added before 30 min of exposure to dim laboratory light at room temperature. Absorption and Resonance Raman Spectroscopy—Room temperature absorbance measurements of LHCIIb were carried out with an Agilent 8453 spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies Ltd, Singapore) using a similar procedure to that previously described (24Ruban A.V. Horton P. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1102: 30-38Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The 77K absorption spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary E5 double-beam scanning spectrophotometer. Measurements at 77 K were performed using a helium flow cryostat (Air Liquide). Low temperature RR spectra were obtained using a Jobin-Yvon U1000 Raman spectrophotometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled CCD detector (Spectrum One, Jobin-Yvon, France). Excitation was provided by Coherent Argon (Innova 100) laser lines at 457.9 and 488.0 nm (Coherent). Pigment Composition of Intact Tissue and Purified LHCIIb—Table I presents the chlorophyll and carotenoid composition of intact tissue and purified LHCIIb from C. reflexa and spinach. Fig. 1 shows representative HPLC and APCI-MS chromatograms of this same tissue, identifying each xanthophyll through its mass. Intact tissue of C. reflexa and spinach showed pigment compositions consistent with previous reports (1Bungard R.A. Ruban A.V. Hibberd J.M. Press M.C. Horton P. Scholes J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1135-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). C. reflexa contained lutein and the xanthophyll cycle carotenoids violaxanthin, antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin similar to spinach and most higher plants. C. reflexa, however, did not contain neoxanthin and instead contained relatively high concentrations of lutein-5,6-epoxide (Lx) (up to around 18% of the total xanthophyll pool) and another xanthophylls that we identify as 9-cis-violaxanthin (9cV, Fig. 2) (up to around 7% of the total xanthophylls pool). 9-cis-violaxanthin was identified from its mass (Fig. 1), by furanoid rearrangement to confirm the existence of two epoxy functional groups, 2R. A. Bungard, A. M. Snyder, and B. M. Clark, unpublished data. by comparison to isomers produced from iodine-catalyzed photoisomerization of all-trans-violaxanthin (Fig. 2), and through comparison with petal tissue from Viola tricolor, which has been shown to be enriched in 9-cis-violaxanthin (25Molnár P.

The 9-cis isomer of violaxanthin in C was distinguished from the other isomers by comparing absorption spectra with that previously reported and by comparing absorption spectra and retention times with tissue enriched in 9-cis-violaxanthin (25Molnár P. Szabolcs J. Phytochemistry. 1980; 19: 623-627Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A high proportion of the total carotenoid content of purified LHCIIb from spinach was made up of lutein and neoxanthin at around 62 and 27% of the total xanthophyll pool, respectively (Table I). All other carotenoid concentrations decreased as a proportion of the total xanthophyll pool when LHCIIb was compared with intact tissue. LHCIIb from C. reflexa showed a similar trend relative to intact tissue in that the total xanthophyll pool was enriched in lutein (also around 64% of the total xanthophylls). However, most surprising was that the 9-cis-violaxanthin isomer was the only other carotenoid to increase as a proportion of the total xanthophyll pool, from less than 7% in entire tissue, to around 24% in LHCIIb of C. reflexa. In comparison to spinach, LHCIIb from C. reflexa also contained trace amounts of several other carotenoids which mass spectrometry revealed to possess mass values equal to lutein-5,6-epoxide and antheraxanthin, with a dominant ion signal of 585.4 m/z in MH+ APCI-MS analysis (Fig. 1). Comparison of the carotenoid composition of intact tissue with that of purified LHCIIb clearly indicates principal differences between the two unusual xanthophylls lutein-5,6-epoxide and 9-cis-violaxanthin in C. reflexa. One, lutein-5,6-epoxide, is a good substrate for deepoxidation, as reported earlier (1Bungard R.A. Ruban A.V. Hibberd J.M. Press M.C. Horton P. Scholes J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1135-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It is present in relatively high concentrations in intact tissue, but is relatively depleted in LHCIIb where it is bound to LHCIIb in the substoichiometric amounts and is likely to be a peripherally associated pigment, similar to violaxanthin, probably in the same binding site V1. On the other hand, 9-cis-violaxanthin, was largely inactive in deepoxidation reactions and hard to remove by further LHCIIb purification steps such as sucrose gradient centrifugation. Moreover, it is present in LHCIIb in amounts similar to those of neoxanthin in control plants (one per monomer), suggesting that it could be occupying the N1 site. Fig. 3 compares the structures of neoxanthin and 9-cis-violaxanthin. Half of the molecules of these pigments are identical compositionally and structurally, both having the 9-cis conformation. The other halves are different: while violaxanthin contains epoxide in the end group, neoxanthin possesses an allene group attached to it. Modeling the steric structures using energy minimization routines produces very similar three-dimensional configurations of these two molecules (Fig. 3B). The cis motif is the most distinct feature, responsible for the L-shape configuration of both molecules, whereas differences in the other groups produce only variations in the head-group orientation. For 9-cis-violaxanthin, the end group is more perpendicularly aligned with respect to the backbone of the molecule in comparison to the corresponding neoxanthin head-group orientation. The reasons for a weak efficiency of de-epoxidation of 9-cis-violaxanthin could be the specificity of de-epoxidase only to the all-trans epoxy xanthophylls as well as the poor accessibility due to the tight association and intrinsic location of the binding site. Neoxanthin and 9-cis-violaxanthin reveal very similar excited state energies. Fig. 4 displays their absorption spectra in comparison to the absorption spectra of all-trans-violaxanthin and lutein-5,6-epoxide. Indeed, neoxanthin and 9-cis-violaxanthin not only have identical 0-0, 0-1, and 0-2 energies but also very similar absorption spectra at around 330 nm. This 330 nm absorption is characteristic of cis isomer carotenoids and is further evidence of the cis nature of violaxanthin from Cuscuta LHCIIb and also is an indication of the similarity between neoxanthin and 9-cis-violaxanthin bound to LHCIIb. All-trans-violaxanthin and lutein-5,6-epoxide have also very similar spectral features, different from those of neoxanthin and 9-cis-violaxanthin. The major electronic transitions are ∼5-nm downshifted and the cis peak at around 330 nm is absent. This is consistent with the fact that both these xanthophylls have nine conjugated double bonds and the same all-trans conformation. With this evidence, and the assumption that lutein-5,6-epoxide and 9-cis-violaxanthin have the same or similar binding sites in vivo as violaxanthin and neoxanthin, respectively, it could be expected that the absorption characteristics LHCIIb from C. reflexa and spinach may be indistinguishable. Absorption and Resonance Raman Spectra of LHCIIb from C. reflexa—Room temperature absorption spectra of LHCIIb from C. reflexa and spinach are almost identical (data not shown) and comparable with those previously reported from isolated trimeric LHCIIb complexes (1Bungard R.A.

Andrews J.Y. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10458-10465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This indicates unchanged chlorophyll composition and organization of the pigment population associated with the protein. To investigate the xanthophyll absorption properties in detail we have measured the low temperature absorption spectrum of C. reflexa LHCIIb and analyzed the fine structure using the second derivative method. Fig. 5 represents the Soret band absorption spectrum of LHCIIb monomers measured at 77 K. As was recently found, the xanthophyll absorption region of the LHCIIb monomer is simpler than that of the trimer (26Ruban A.V. Pascal A.A. Robert B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It is represented by two 0-0 transitions belonging to the two different types of xanthophylls. One absorbing at 494–495 nm has been assigned to two lutein molecules being in approximately similar environments (26Ruban A.V. Pascal A.A. Robert B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The other component, peeking at 485 nm, has been assigned to the neoxanthin in neoxanthin-containing LHCIIb. This component is approximately half the intensity of the lutein band, since there are two luteins and only one neoxanthin per LHCIIb monomer in usual plant tissue. The second derivative spectrum represented on Fig. 5 shows the lutein feature at 494 nm and the smaller component at 485 nm. There is also a 457-nm band, which matches the position of the 0-1 transition of neoxanthin in neoxanthin-containing LHCIIb. Since neoxanthin is totally missing from the LHCIIb from C. reflexa, these spectrophotometric components are most likely to correspond to the 0-0 and 0-1 transitions of 9-cis-violaxanthin, which replaces neoxanthin but has a very similar absorption spectrum in vitro (Fig. 3). In order to obtain direct information on the configuration of the LHCIIb xanthophyll absorbing in the 485-nm region we employed the RR spectroscopy. The method has proven to be non-destructive for many photosynthetic preparations and provide selective information about the type and conformation of carotenoids in multipigment systems (27Ruban A.V. Pascal A.A. Robert B. Horton P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24862-24870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Fig. 6A presents the conformation-sensitive Raman region, ν2, for LHCIIb monomer from the control plant spinach (1Bungard R.A. Ruban A.V. Hibberd J.M. Press M.C. Horton P. Scholes J.D. Proc. Natl.

Regions characteristic of 9-cis conformation at 1124 and 1132 cm–1 have the same position and amplitude, suggesting identical xanthophyll configurations absorbing around 485–488 nm. The positi"

ATP binding and hydrolysis promote conformational changes within the γ complex that modulate its affinity for the clamp and DNA, allowing it to accomplish the mechanical task of assembling clamps on DNA. This is the first of two reports (Snyder, A. K., Williams, C. R., Johnson, A., O'Donnell, M., and Bloom, L. B. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 4386–4393) addressing the question of how ATP binding and hydrolysis modulate specific interactions with DNA and β. Pre-steady-state rates of ATP hydrolysis were slower when reactions were initiated by addition of ATP than when the γ complex was equilibrated with ATP and were limited by the rate of an intramolecular reaction, possibly ATP-induced conformational changes. Kinetic modeling of assays in which the γ complex was incubated with ATP for different periods of time prior to adding DNA to trigger hydrolysis suggests a mechanism in which a relatively slow conformational change step (kforward = 6.5 s-1) produces a species of the γ complex that is activated for DNA (and β) binding. In the absence of β, 2 of the 3 molecules of ATP are hydrolyzed rapidly prior to releasing DNA, and the 3rd molecule is hydrolyzed slowly. In the presence of β, all 3 molecules of ATP are hydrolyzed rapidly. These results suggest that hydrolysis of 2 molecules of ATP may be coupled to conformational changes that reduce interactions with DNA, whereas hydrolysis of the 3rd is coupled to changes that result in release of β.

Sliding clamps increase the overall efficiency of DNA synthesis by tethering DNA polymerases to the templates. In the absence of the sliding clamp, Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III is capable of incorporating about one dozen nucleotides in a single binding event. However, when it is bound to the β sliding clamp, the processivity of the DNA polymerase III core (composed of the α, ϵ, and θ subunits) increases to thousands of nucleotides (1Fay P.J. Johanson K.O. McHenry C.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 976-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sliding clamps remain tightly associated with template DNA while, at the same time, allowing the polymerase to move rapidly along DNA as it incorporates nucleotides. This is possible because the clamps are composed of protein subunits that are assembled in a ring-shaped structure with a central opening large enough to encircle duplex DNA (2Kong X.-P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). The E. coli β clamp is composed of two identical crescent-shaped monomers, whereas the human proliferating cell nuclear antigen clamp contains three, but the overall structures of both complexes are strikingly similar (2Kong X.-P.

The E. coli DNA polymerase III clamp loader is composed of seven different subunits; three copies of the dnaX gene product; and a single copy each of δ, δ′, χ, and Ψ (4Maki S. Kornberg K. J. Biol.

The mechanical task of assembling clamps on DNA requires that protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions change during a single cycle of a clamp loading reaction. The clamp loader must initially have a high affinity for clamps and DNA to bring the clamp to DNA, but then must have a decreased affinity to release the clamp on DNA and to avoid competing with the polymerase for loaded clamps. ATP binding and hydrolysis by the DnaX subunits drive conformational changes within the clamp loader that rapidly modulate its affinity for clamps and DNA. This change in affinity must be rapid enough to support DNA synthesis on the lagging strand, where a clamp must be loaded for every 1–2-kb Okazaki fragment that is synthesized every 1–2 s. Modulation of the β and DNA binding activities of the clamp loader requires the coordinated activities of a minimum of five of the seven γ complex subunits, three γ subunits, δ, and δ′ (21Onrust R.

Structure. 2003; 11: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) that expose this region of δ, allowing the clamp loader to bind with high affinity and to open the β clamp. ATP binding also increases the affinity of the clamp loader for DNA (30Bloom L.B. Turner J. Kelman Z. Beechem J.M. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol.

Subsequent binding to a primed template DNA triggers ATP hydrolysis, reducing the affinity of the clamp loader for β and DNA (31Ason B. Bertram J.G. Hingorani M.M. Beechem J.M. O'Donnell M.

This reduced affinity is likely to be produced by conformational changes that mask β-and DNA-binding domains. Dissociation of the ADP-bound clamp loader from β and DNA allows the clamp to close and gives the polymerase access to the newly loaded clamp. The precise nature of the ATP-induced conformational changes within the clamp loader is not yet known. Successive binding of ATP to each of the three γ subunits could potentially promote a series of conformational changes that ultimately produce an activated complex. Structural data for a minimal E. coli clamp loading complex (γ3δδ′) suggest that conformational changes that occur in each γ subunit are translated to the δ subunit, pulling it away from δ′ and exposing the β-binding domain (24Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 429-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar).

In this study, ATP hydrolysis and clamp loading reactions were measured under pre-steady-state conditions to define ATP-dependent steps. A key experiment was to measure the kinetics of ATP-dependent conformational changes by incubating the γ complex with ATP for different periods of time (0–1000 ms) to differentially populate conformational states that are formed upon binding ATP. DNA was then added to trigger ATP hydrolysis and to probe the relative populations of species present.

Primed templates were annealed by incubating the 30-nucleotide primer with the 105-nucleotide template at 80 °C for 5 min and then allowing the solution to cool slowly to room temperature. For ATPase assays, the mole ratios of primer to template were 1.15:1 in annealing reactions and 1.2:1 in anisotropy assays. These primed templates were used without further purification (31Ason B.

Assay buffer used for all experiments contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The concentration of β was determined from its absorbance at 280 nm and the extinction coefficient (17Gao D. McHenry C.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1986; 261: 11460-11465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Concentrations of γ complex were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and the calculated extinction coefficient. This concentration was verified by amino acid analysis following acid hydrolysis of the protein (performed by the Protein Chemistry Core Facility, Biotechnology Program, University of Florida). A sample for amino acid analysis was prepared by dialyzing the γ complex against 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) at 4 °C to remove glycerol and other buffer components that interfere with the analysis. The concentration of this dialyzed protein was also determined by three other methods for comparison: 1) its absorbance at 280 nm in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride (pH 6.5), 2) its concentration in a Bradford-type assay (Bio-Rad protein assay) using a bovine serum albumin standard, and 3) its concentration in a Bradford-type assay (Bio-Rad protein assay) using an IgG standard. The amino acid analysis and absorbance measured under denaturing conditions yielded concentrations of 1.6 μm and 1.7 μm, respectively (the same within experimental error). Both Bradford-type assays overestimated the concentration of protein by factors of 1.2 and 3.0 using the bovine serum albumin and IgG standards, respectively. E. coli Phosphate-binding Protein (PBP)—PBP was purified and labeled with N-(2-(1-maleimidyl)ethyl)-7-(diethylamino)coumarin-3-carboxamide (MDCC; Molecular Probes, Inc.) by the method described by Brune et al.

The active-site concentration of MDCC-PBP was determined by titration with potassium phosphate standards. In each preparation, the concentration of active PBP correlated with the fraction of PBP that was labeled. This concentration of active MDCC-PBP was used in all calculations of Pi concentrations in ATPase assays. Pre-steady-state ATPase Assays—ATP hydrolysis by the γ complex was measured using MDCC-PBP to report on Pi produced from the reaction. The increase in the fluorescence of MDCC-PBP upon binding Pi was measured in real time during the course of reactions as described (31Ason B. Bertram J.G. Hingorani M.M. Beechem J.M. O'Donnell M.

Assay buffers contained a phosphate mop consisting of 0.14 units/ml purine-nucleotide phosphorylase (Sigma) and 168 μm 7-methylguanosine (Sigma) to remove Pi contamination from buffer components. Control reactions that contained no ATP were used to determine the intensity of MDCC-PBP in the absence of Pi (If), and reactions with 200 μm potassium phosphate gave a signal for completely bound MDCC-PBP (Ib) under a given set of experimental conditions. The fraction of MDCC-PBP bound to Pi at any time (t) during a hydrolysis reaction (xb(t)) was calculated using the following equation: xb(t) = (Iobs(t) - If)/(Ib - If), where Iobs(t) is the observed intensity at time t. The fraction bound was converted to the concentration bound by multiplying by the concentration of active MDCC-PBP. The concentration of Pi bound to MDCC-PBP is plotted as a function of time in Figs. 1, 4, and 5 to illustrate the number of molecules of ATP hydrolyzed per molecule of γ complex.Fig. 4Kinetics of ATP hydrolysis upon incubation of the γ complex with ATP for a defined period of time prior to addition of DNA. Sequential mixing experiments were performed in which the γ complex was incubated with ATP for 15 (cyan), 48 (orange), 98 (gray), 250 (red), 500 (blue), or 1000 (green) ms prior to addition of DNA and MDCC-PBP. The increase in the fluorescence of MDCC-PBP upon binding Pi was measured as a function of time and used to calculate the concentration of Pi produced by hydrolysis and bound to MDCC-PBP. The concentration of MDCC-PBP·Pi is plotted as a function of time on time scales of 0.4 s (upper panel) and 2 s (lower panel). Data were collected at 1-ms intervals for the first 2 s and at 5-ms intervals from 2 to 12 s (not shown). The solid black curves through the data were calculated by fitting the data to the model shown in Fig. 5A. The final concentrations were 0.27 μm γ complex, 400 μm ATP, 1.0 μm DNA, and 2.7 μm MDCC-PBP in assay buffer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 5Kinetic modeling of ATP hydrolysis reactions.A, the kinetic model and rate constants used to fit data in Fig. 4 are shown. This model has two key features. First, addition of ATP (T) to the γ complex (GC) initially forms a GC1TTT state, which converts to a new species (GC2TTT) relatively slowly. Both of these species are present when the γ complex is equilibrated with ATP (preincubation times ≥250 ms). The GC2TTT complex is activated for binding DNA and subsequent ATP hydrolysis. A second feature of this model is that 2 of the 3 molecules of ATP are hydrolyzed rapidly, forming ADP (D) and Pi (P) with DNA release upon hydrolysis of the 2nd molecule. The 3rd molecule is hydrolyzed slowly after the complex is no longer bound to DNA. In fitting the data, the DNA binding rate constant (konN = 300 μm-1 s-1) (31Ason B. Bertram J.G. Hingorani M.M.

Corrie J.E.T. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) and dissociating from MDCC-PBP (koffP = 13.6 s-1) (35Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E.T. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) were set to values that were measured directly in other work. All other rate constants were derived from fitting the data in Fig. 4 to the model shown using DynaFit (39Kuzmič P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). The steady-state portions of the reactions are described by a pseudo first-order reaction that “recycles” the final ADP-bound state to the initial ATP-bound state. This pseudo first-order approximation is reasonable because only a very small fraction of the ATP substrate (<0.2%) is consumed on the time scale of the reaction. B, the kinetic model shown in A requires an additional step to generate the lag in ATP hydrolysis in reactions in which the γ complex is not preincubated with ATP. A single mixing assay was performed in which the γ complex (0.27 μm) was added to ATP (500 μm), DNA (1.0 μm), and MDCC-PBP (2.7 μm) to give the final concentrations indicated in assay buffer. The solid black curve through the data was calculated from the model and rate constants in A with the inclusion of the two steps shown above the graph. A rapid step (kp1 = 65 s-1) that initially forms the GC1TTT state was added, and the final recycling step in A was changed so that the GC4DDD state regenerated the GC0TTT state rather than the GC1TTT state. The rate constants kp1 and krec were fit as adjustable parameters, but all other rate constants were set to the values shown in A. The first turnover of ATP is biphasic under these assay conditions, although the two phases are difficult to identify by visual inspection alone. The dashed gray line through the data shows the calculated time course for hydrolysis of the first 2 molecules of ATP, which occurs at a more rapid rate than hydrolysis of the remaining ATP molecule.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Assays were done using an Applied Photophysics SXMV stopped-flow apparatus and either single or sequential mixing protocols at 20 °C. Data were collected for a total of 12 s at intervals of 1 ms for the first 2 s and 5 ms thereafter. In single mixing experiments, the γ complex, MDCC-PBP, and DNA were placed in one syringe, and ATP was placed in a second. Reactions were initiated by mixing equal volumes from the two syringes. In sequential mixing experiments, the γ complex and β, when present, were placed in one syringe; ATP was placed in the second; and the third contained DNA and MDCC-PBP. The contents of the first two syringes were incubated in an aging loop for 15, 48, 98, 250, 500, or 1000 ms prior to adding the contents of the third syringe. Concentrations for each experiment are indicated under “Results.” ATPγS Chase Assays—Chase assays were performed as described for ATPase assays using the sequential mixing protocol with an incubation time of 1000 ms. In these assays, ATPγS was included in the third syringe along with DNA and MDCC-PBP. Final concentrations are given under “Results.” Pre-steady-state Fluorescence Anisotropy Experiments—Stopped-flow fluorescence anisotropy assays were done using a Biologic SFM-4 stopped-flow apparatus (Molecular Kinetics, Pullman, WA) equipped with four independently driven reagent syringes and a 30-μl cuvette (Model FC-15) with a 1.5-mm path length as described (31Ason B.

For each experiment, vertically (IVV) and horizontally (IVH) polarized emission intensities were measured at 1-ms intervals for 8 s, and 19–20 stopped-flow runs were signal averaged. Anisotropy (r) was calculated from polarized intensities using Equation 1,r=(IVV-gIVH)/(IVV+2gIVH)(Eq. 1) where g is the g-factor calculated by dividing the vertically polarized emission by the horizontally polarized emission measured when samples are excited with horizontally polarized light. Total intensities (Itot) were also calculated for each reaction (Equation 2).Itot=IVV+2gIVH(Eq. 2) There were no changes in the total intensities of X-rhodamine isothiocyanate (RhX) as a function of time, indicating that there were no changes in effective quantum yields during the course of the experiment. Therefore, anisotropy changes can be interpreted simply in terms of changes in rotational motion (37Otto M.R. Lillo M.P. Beechem J.M. Biophys.

We report the kinetics for the opening of the GluR1Qflip channel, an α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor subunit of the ionotropic glutamate receptors. Using a laser-pulse photolysis technique that permits glutamate to be liberated photolytically from γ-O-(α-carboxy-2-nitrobenzyl)glutamate (caged glutamate) with a time constant of ∼30 μs, we show that, after the binding of glutamate, the channel opened with a rate constant of (2.9 ± 0.2) × 104 s–1 and closed with a rate constant of (2.1 ± 0.1) × 103 s–1. The observed shortest rise time (20–80% of the receptor current response), i.e. the fastest time by which the GluR1Qflip channel can open, was predicted to be 35 μs. This value is three times shorter than those previously reported. The minimal kinetic mechanism for channel opening consists of binding of two glutamate molecules, with the channel-opening probability being 0.93 ± 0.10. These findings identify GluR1Qflip as one of the temporally efficient receptors that transduce the binding of chemical signals (i.e. glutamate) into an electrical impulse.

These findings identify GluR1Qflip as one of the temporally efficient receptors that transduce the binding of chemical signals (i.e. glutamate) into an electrical impulse. The rate at which a ligand-gated ion channel opens is important to know because it has major implications in signal transmission and regulation. First, knowing the constants for the channel-opening rate will allow one to predict more quantitatively the time course of the open channel form of the receptor as a function of neurotransmitter or ligand concentration, which determines the transmembrane voltage change and in turn controls synaptic neurotransmission. Second, that knowledge will provide clues for mechanism-based design of compounds to regulate receptor function more effectively. Third, characterizing the effect of structural variations on the rate constants for channel opening will offer a test of the function, which is relevant to the time scale on which the receptor is in the open channel form, rather than in the desensitized form, i.e. ligand-bound, but closed channel form. Examples of structural variations include those due to RNA editing, RNA splicing, and site-specific mutations for investigating the structurefunction relationship. Finally, knowing the channel-opening rate constants will be required to understand quantitatively the integration of nerve impulses that arrive at a chemical synapse or that originate from the same synapse, but from different receptors responding to the same chemical signals (neurotransmitters) such as glutamate.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 89-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By no means, however, is this “slow” time scale actually slow: even early studies of the native AMPA receptors show that, within a few milliseconds, the receptors desensitize (20Raman I.M. Trussell L.O. Neuron. 1992; 9: 173-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 21Fleck M.W. Bahring R. Patneau D.K. Mayer M.L. J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 75: 2322-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). By inference, the channel must open faster. In this study, we used a laser-pulse photolysis technique to release biologically active glutamate from biologically inert caged glutamate or γ-O-(α-carboxy-2-nitrobenzyl)glutamate with a time constant of ∼30 μs (Fig. 1) (22Wieboldt R. Gee K.R. Niu L. Ramesh D. Carpenter B.K. Hess G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8752-8756Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and characterized the kinetic mechanism of glutamate-induced channel opening prior to channel desensitization. We found that the GluR1Qflip channel opens in response to the binding of the natural neurotransmitter glutamate with a rate constant of 29,000 s–1 and closes with a constant of 2100 s–1. Once bound to glutamate, the receptor has a 0.93 probability to open. We offer possible interpretations for the biological significance of these results in the context of other glutamate receptors. Expression of cDNA and Cell Culture—The original cDNA encoding GluR1Qflip in a pBluescript vector was provided by Prof. Steve Heinemann (Salk Institute) and cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). The plasmid was propagated in an Escherichia coli host (DH5α) and purified using a kit from QIAGEN Inc. (Valencia, CA). HEK-293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C. GluR1Qflip was transiently expressed in these cells using a calcium phosphate method (23Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4823) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, HEK-293 cells were also cotransfected with a plasmid encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP; a generous gift from Prof. Ben Szaro, State University of New York at Albany). GFP was used as an intracellular marker, and green cells were selected for recordings. The weight ratio of the plasmid for GFP to that for GluR1 was 1:10, and the GluR1 plasmid was used for transfection at ∼3–5 μg/35-mm dish. Transfected cells were allowed to grow for >48 h before use. Whole-cell Current Recording—Recording electrodes were pulled from glass capillaries (World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL) and fire-polished. The electrode resistance was ∼3 megaohms when filled with the electrode solution. The electrode solution contained 110 mm CsF, 30 mm CsCl, 4 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 adjusted with CsOH). The external bath solution contained 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 adjusted with NaOH). All chemicals were from commercial sources. The GFP fluorescence in cells was visualized using an Axiovert S100 microscope with a fluorescent detection system (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY). The whole-cell current was recorded using an Axopatch 200B amplifier at a cutoff frequency of 2–20 kHz with a built-in, 4-pole Bessel filter and digitized at sampling frequency of 5–50 kHz using a Digidata 1322A apparatus (Axon Instruments, Inc., Union City, CA). The data acquisition software used was pCLAMP8 (Axon Instruments, Inc.). Laser-pulse Photolysis—The setup for the laser-pulse photolysis experiment has been described previously (24Hess G.P. Grewer C. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 291: 443-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 25Niu L. Grewer C. Hess G.P. Techniques in Protein Chemistry. Vol. VII. Academic Press, Inc., New York1996: 139-149Google Scholar). γ-O-(α-Carboxy-2-nitrobenzyl)glutamate (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) (22Wieboldt R. Gee K.R. Niu L. Ramesh D. Carpenter B.K. Hess G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8752-8756Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) was dissolved in the external bath buffer and applied to a cell using a cell-flow device (see below). Once a HEK-293 cell was in the whole-cell mode, it was lifted from the bottom of the dish and suspended in the external bath solution. After the cell was equilibrated with caged glutamate for 250 ms, the laser was fired to liberate the free glutamate. A single laser pulse at 355 nm with a pulse length of 8 ns was generated from a Minilite II pulsed Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (Continuum, Santa Clara, CA) tuned by a third harmonic generator. The laser light was coupled to a fiber optic (FiberGuide Industries, Stirling, NJ), and the power was adjusted to 200–800 μJ, as detected by a joulemeter (Gentec, Quebec, Canada). To vary the concentration of the photolytically released glutamate in kinetic measurements, the power of the laser was adjusted, and/or the concentration of the caged glutamate was varied. To determine the concentration of the photolytically released glutamate, at least two glutamate solutions with known concentrations were used to measure the current amplitudes from the same cell before and after a laser pulse. The free glutamate solution was applied to the cell using the cell-flow device (see below). The current amplitudes obtained from the cell-flow measurements were compared with the amplitude from the laser measurement, with reference to the dose-response relationship. These measurements also permitted us to monitor any damage to the receptors and/or the cell for successive laser experiments with the same cell. Cell-flow Measurements—The cell-flow device (26Udgaonkar J.B. Hess G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8758-8762Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) was used to deliver either caged glutamate for laser-pulse photolysis or free glutamate to monitor the cell damage and to calibrate the concentration of photolytically released glutamate. The cell-flow device consisted of a U-tube with an aperture of ∼150 μm. The linear flow rate, controlled by two peristaltic pumps, was 4 cm/s. A HEK-293 cell was placed 50–100 μm away from the U-tube aperture. The rise time of the glutamate-induced whole-cell current response (10–90%) was 2.3 ± 0.1 ms, an average of the measurement from >100 cells expressing the receptor. When free glutamate was used, the amplitude of the whole-cell current was corrected for receptor desensitization during the rise time by a method described previously (26Udgaonkar J.B. Hess G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8758-8762Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This correction is necessary because the observed current amplitude depends on the rise time of the amplitude, the fraction of the open channel (i.e. the percentage of the channel that is open), and the desensitization rate constant. The reduction in the current amplitude due to desensitization is particularly significant when the receptor of interest desensitizes rapidly, as does the GluR1 receptor (6Derkach V. Barria A. Soderling T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3269-3274Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 16Partin K.M. Fleck M.W. Mayer M.L. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6634-6647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Robert A. Irizarry S.N. Hughes T.E. Howe J.R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5574-5586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The method used to correct the receptor desensitization during the rise time is based on hydrodynamic theories that describe fluid flowing over a spherical object, such as, by approximation, a HEK-293 cell suspended in the external bath solution. When a solution flows over a cell, the time that the ligand molecules in the solution mix with receptors on the cell surface varies because of uneven flow rates of the ligands over the spherical surface of a cell. This asynchronization in mixing distorts both the rate and amplitude of the current rise. By the correction method, the time course of the current is first divided into a constant time interval, and then the observed current (Iobs) is corrected for the desensitization that occurs during each time interval (Δt). After the current is determined for each of n constant time intervals (nΔt = tn, where tn is equal to or greater than the current rise time), the corrected total current (IA) is given by Equation 1,IA=(eαΔt-1)∑i=1n(Iobs)Δti+(Iobs)Δtn(Eq. 1) where α represents the rate constant for receptor desensitization, and (Iobs)Δti represents the observed current during the ith time interval. IA obtained from this correction method is independent of the flow speed of the solution. The validity of this method was demonstrated using several independent approaches (26Udgaonkar J.B. Hess G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8758-8762Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). (The current correction program was kindly provided by Prof. George P. Hess, Cornell University.) All recordings were made with cells that were voltage-clamped at –60 mV, pH 7.4, and 22 °C. Each data point is an average of at least three measurements collected from at least three cells unless otherwise noted. Linear regression and nonlinear fitting (Levenberg-Marquardt and simplex algorithms) were performed using Origin Version 7 software (Origin Lab, Northampton, MA). Uncertainties are reported as S.E. of the fits unless noted otherwise. Glutamate-induced GluR1Qflip Response—A typical glutamate-induced whole-cell response is illustrated in Fig. 2A. The current through the GluR1Qflip homomeric channel expressed in HEK-293 cells increased rapidly, indicating channel opening, and then returned toward the base line, indicating desensitization. As a control, both non-transfected cells and cells expressing only GFP gave no response even at 10 mm glutamate, a concentration that otherwise would have evoked a maximal current response for the transfected cells expressing GluR1Qflip (see the dose-response curve in Fig. 3A). The receptor desensitization was rapid (Fig. 2B) and essentially complete (Fig. 2A), which is consistent with previous observations (6Derkach V. Barria A. Soderling T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3269-3274Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 15Mosbacher J. Schoepfer R. Monyer H. Burnashev N. Seeburg P.H. Ruppersberg J.P.

Hughes T.E. Howe J.R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5574-5586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A first-order rate was adequate to describe >95% of the progression of the desensitization reaction at all concentrations of glutamate. This analysis agreed with those previously reported (6Derkach V. Barria A. Soderling T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3269-3274Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 15Mosbacher J. Schoepfer R. Monyer H. Burnashev N. Seeburg P.H. Ruppersberg J.P.

(17Robert A. Irizarry S.N. Hughes T.E. Howe J.R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5574-5586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) described an additional but minor (0.5–2%) desensitization process with a much slower rate. The desensitization rate constant increased with increasing glutamate concentration, but eventually became invariant (Fig. 2B). The mean value of the maximal rate constant, independent of ligand concentration, was 230 s–1 or a time constant of ∼4 ms.Fig. 3Whole-cell current amplitude as a function of glutamate concentration or dose-response relationship.A, the whole-cell currents from different cells were normalized to the current obtained at 1 mm glutamate, and the current amplitude at 10 mm was set to 100%. The best fit parameters using Equation 2 (solid line) were as follows: K1 = 0.53 ± 0.06 mm, Φ = 0.19 ± 0.04, and IMRM = 123 ± 5. ○, measurements for HEK-293 cells expressing only GluR1Qflip; □, measurements for HEK-293 cells expressing both GluR1Qflip and GFP. The observed whole-cell current was corrected for desensitization (see “Materials and Methods”). B, shown is a minimal kinetic mechanism for the channel opening of GluR1Qflip. The mechanism involves two ligand-binding steps. A, the active unliganded form of the receptor; L, the ligand (glutamate); AL and AL2, ligand-bound closed channel forms; AL2, the open channel form of the receptor. For simplicity, it is assumed that glutamate binds to the two sites with equal affinity (designated by K1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Based on the magnitude and profile of the desensitization rate, we evaluated whether the presence of GFP affected the kinetic properties of GluR1Qflip expressed in the green fluorescent HEK-293 cells (the green color was due to the expression of GFP) because the green cells were selected for measurements. We found that the desensitization rate constant obtained from green cells expressing both GFP and GluR1Qflip at a given glutamate concentration was statistically no different from the rate constant obtained from non-green cells expressing only GluR1Qflip (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the relative current amplitude determined under the same conditions was comparable (Fig. 3A). Therefore, we concluded that the presence of GFP in the same cell did not affect the kinetic property of GluR1Qflip, and GFP was thus used for convenient identification of cells expressing GluR1Qflip. In addition, a nearly linear correlation was observed between the intensity of the green fluorescence and the amplitude of the receptor response from the same cell. It has been documented that the desensitization rate observed using whole cells is slower than that using outside-out patches for the same receptor (6Derkach V. Barria A. Soderling T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3269-3274Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 16Partin K.M. Fleck M.W. Mayer M.L. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6634-6647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Robert A. Irizarry S.N. Hughes T.E. Howe J.R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5574-5586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The largest difference reported is 2.9-fold (16Partin K.M. Fleck M.W. Mayer M.L. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6634-6647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reason for this discrepancy in rate is not known, although several explanations have been proposed (6Derkach V. Barria A. Soderling T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3269-3274Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 16Partin K.M. Fleck M.W. Mayer M.L. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6634-6647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Robert A. Irizarry S.N. Hughes T.E. Howe J.R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5574-5586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including the slower solution exchange rate with a whole cell because of its geometry and/or the faster desensitization rate constant observed with outside-out patches because of the altered kinetic properties of the receptor in such a membrane configuration (27Tong G. Jahr C.E. J. Neurophysiol. 1994; 72: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, our purpose for measuring desensitization (shown in Fig. 2B) was to use the desensitization rate constant as a relative measure to test whether the presence of GFP in the same cell affected the desensitization rate of the receptor. Furthermore, the magnitude of the desensitization rate we observed using the whole-cell recording was consistent with values reported by others. For instance, at 1 mm glutamate, the desensitization time constant we obtained was 6 ms (or a rate constant of 160 s–1). This value was identical, within experimental error, to the value observed in the whole-cell recording of the same receptor by both Partin et al. (16Partin K.M. Fleck M.W. Mayer M.L. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6634-6647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Derkach et al. (6Derkach V. Barria A. Soderling T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3269-3274Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Minimal Kinetic Mechanism for Channel Opening—Fig. 3A shows the dose-response relationship, established with the current amplitude corrected for receptor desensitization (see “Materials and Methods”), as a function of glutamate concentration. The relationship is described by Equation 2,IA=IMRML2L2+Φ(L+K1)2(Eq. 2) where IA represents the current amplitude, L is the molar concentration of the ligand, IM is the current/mole of receptor, and RM is the moles of receptor in the cell. Φ is the reciprocal of the channel-opening equilibrium constant, and K1 is the intrinsic dissociation constant for the ligand. The derivation of Equation 2 was based on a minimal kinetic mechanism for channel opening, shown in Fig. 3B. This mechanism is a general one for ligand-gated ion channels (28Katz B. Thesleff S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1957; 138: 63-80Crossref Scopus (956) Google Scholar), including glutamate receptors (20Raman I.M. Trussell L.O.

For simplicity, it was assumed that the intrinsic equilibrium dissociation constant (K1) for both ligand-binding steps was the same (see below for additional discussion of this mechanism). Accordingly, the best fit of the dose-response curve yielded K1 = 0.53 ± 0.06 mm using Equation 2. The K1 value from this study is comparable with the reported values of EC50 (the ligand concentration that corresponds to 50% of the maximal response), ranging from ∼0.5 to 0.7 mm (6Derkach V. Barria A. Soderling T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3269-3274Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 16Partin K.M. Fleck M.W. Mayer M.L. J.

Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 590-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Characterization of Caged Glutamate with GluR1Qflip in HEK-293 Cells—In this study, we used a laser-pulse photolysis technique to characterize the channel-opening kinetics for the GluR1Qflip homomeric receptor. This technique permits rapid photolytic release of free glutamate, with t½ ∼ 30 μs, from its photolabile precursor or caged glutamate (Fig. 1) (22Wieboldt R. Gee K.R. Niu L. Ramesh D. Carpenter B.K. Hess G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8752-8756Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To use this technique, the caged glutamate must be biologically inert with respect to the GluR1Qflip receptor expressed in HEK-293 cells. As shown in Fig. 4, the glutamate-elicited receptor responses in the presence and absence of caged glutamate had identical current amplitudes and desensitization rates. In this test, the concentration of caged glutamate was 2 mm, the highest used in the laser experiments. Therefore, this result (Fig. 4) demonstrated that the caged glutamate did not activate the GluR1Qflip channel, nor did it inhibit or potentiate the glutamate response. This conclusion is consistent with the earlier characterization of the caged glutamate using endogenous glutamate receptors in rat hippocampal neurons (22Wieboldt R. Gee K.R. Niu L. Ramesh D.

A major drawback to their pharmacological application is that these repetitive sequences are highly immunogenic, being therefore the deletion of this characteristic desirable. Based on sequence homology and epitope mapping analyses, an artificial repetitive sequence (PSTAD) was engineered.

Our findings indicate that the insertion of defined motifs into a proline-rich framework constitutes a suitable alternative to construct a chimeric protein with extended half-life in blood. Despite its relevance, little is known about the structural requirements that are to be filled by a given protein to remain in blood. This applies even for a long lived blood protein such as the albumin, where detailed knowledge of its structure and function has already been gained (1Peters T. All about Albumin: Biochemistry, Genetics, and Medical Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996: 188-284Google Scholar). The mean residence time in the bloodstream is distinctive for each particular protein and seems to rely on a combination of several mechanisms including proteolytic degradation, hepatic uptake, endothelium permeability, renal excretion, and immunogenic reactions (2Monfardini C. Veronese F.M. Bioconjugate Chem. 1998; 9: 418-450Google Scholar). In addition, post-translational modifications such as site-specific carbohydrate attachment (3Rifai A. Fadden K. Morrison S.L.

The presence of endogenous receptors for certain molecules also regulates their mean residence time in blood (7Hopkins C.R. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 508-521Google Scholar, 8French A.R.

Although scarce evidence is at hand, the existence of linear amino acid motifs involved in the bloodstream half-life of proteins might be postulated (11Kim J.K. Tsen M.F. Ghetie V. Ward E.S. Eur. J.

Other approaches rely on genetic and chemical techniques to create chimeras between a desired protein and a normal constituent of the mammalian plasma that would eventually act as a carrier (19Ashkenazi A.

This strategy resembles that displayed by several pathogen-derived molecules that recognize and remain attached to circulating proteins such as immunoglobulins, albumin, fibronectin, or fibrinogen through the evolutionary acquisition of specific binding domains (22Frick I.M.

Trypanosoma cruzi, the protozoan parasite causative of the Chagas' disease, displays an alternative strategy to improve the pharmacokinetic properties of its trans-sialidase (TS), 1The abbreviations used are: TStrans-sialidaseGSTglutathione S-transferase from Schistosoma japonicumHRMhybrid repetitive motifPBSphosphate-buffered salineSAPAshed acute phase antigenTATtyrosine aminotransferase from rat livertβelimination half-lifeTS-HRMTS with 21 associated HRM repeatsTS-SAPATS with 13 associated SAPA repeatsTS-3RTS with three associated SAPA repeats. a bloodstream-borne virulence factor (25Frasch A.C. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 282-286Google Scholar). The presence of a repetitive domain termed shed acute phase antigen (SAPA) on the TS C terminus, although not involved in catalysis (26Campetella O.E. Uttaro A.D. Parodi A.J. Frasch A.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 64: 337-340Google Scholar), raises its half-life in blood (12Buscaglia C.A. Alfonso J. Campetella O. Frasch A.C. Blood. 1999; 93: 2025-2032Google Scholar, 27Buscaglia C.A. Campetella O. Leguizamón M.S. Frasch A.C. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 177: 431-436Google Scholar). This enhanced serum persistence allows the enzyme to be systemically distributed, thus ensuring the interaction with its target tissues during infection (28Leguizamón M.S. Mocetti E. Garcia Rivello H. Argibay P. Campetella O. J. Infect. Dis. 1999; 180: 1398-1402Google Scholar, 29Mucci J. Hidalgo A. Mocetti E. Argibay P.F. Leguizamón M.S. Campetella O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Today. 1992; 8: 378-381Google Scholar), when genetically fused to TS stabilizes the enzyme in blood to a similar extent as SAPA (12Buscaglia C.A. Alfonso J. Campetella O. Frasch A.C. Blood. 1999; 93: 2025-2032Google Scholar). Therefore, both amino acid sequences provide a simple and valuable tool for the elucidation of peptidic motifs underlying the maintenance of proteins in the circulation. Unfortunately, both SAPA and Tc13 are highly immunogenic, being two of the major antibody targets during the acute phase of T. cruzi infection (31Affranchino J.L. Ibáñez C.F. Luquetti A.O. Rassi A. Reyes M.B. Macina R.A. Aslund L. Pettersson U. Frasch A.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 34: 221-228Google Scholar). Molecular dissection of both features (i.e. immunogenicity and stabilization capacity) is therefore highly desirable. trans-sialidase glutathione S-transferase from Schistosoma japonicum hybrid repetitive motif phosphate-buffered saline shed acute phase antigen tyrosine aminotransferase from rat liver elimination half-life TS with 21 associated HRM repeats TS with 13 associated SAPA repeats TS with three associated SAPA repeats. In the present work, we took advantage of sequence alignments and B-cell epitope mapping information from both T. cruzi antigens to design a novel artificial repetitive motif (termed the hybrid repetitive motif (HRM)). As SAPA and Tc13, this motif carries the ability to stabilize reporter proteins in the circulation but displays significantly lower immunogenicity. Critical amino acid residues involved in the pharmacokinetics properties of HRM were identified by a site-directed mutagenesis approach. Results achieved were extended to peptide motifs present in shed proteins from other pathogenic microorganisms, suggesting an analogous strategy to disseminate their virulence factors inside the vertebrate host. Mice—C3H/HeJ and BALB/cJ 60–90-day-old female mice bred in our facilities were indistinctly used. All assays were approved by the ethical committee of our institute. Recombinant Proteins—The minimal DNA unit coding for two 5-amino acid-long repeats of the HRM molecule was generated by annealing the oligonucleotide 5′-pCGATCCCTCTACGGCCGACCCAAGTACTGC-3′ (where p means 5′ phosphorylated oligonucleotide) to its complementary sequence. Oligonucleotides (250 pmol each) were mixed, boiled for 5 min, and incubated overnight at 16 °C with 1,000 units of T4 DNA ligase and 75 μm ATP. Five units of FspI restriction endonuclease were included in the ligation mixture to release tail-to-tail ligated products. DNA-modifying enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), unless otherwise stated. Fragments showing maximal extent of polymerization were purified from agarose gels and subjected to a second round of ligation as described above. DNA fragments showing the desired molecular mass were purified, incubated for 1 h at 72 °C with Taq polymerase in the presence of dATP 0.4 mm, and subsequently cloned into the pGEM T-easy vector (both from Promega (Madison, WI)). The accuracy and the actual number of repeats were determined by DNA sequencing. To obtain the TS-HRM fusion protein, this insert was subcloned into the EcoRI site located at the 3′ end of the TS gene in the pTSac plasmid (12Buscaglia C.A. Alfonso J. Campetella O. Frasch A.C. Blood. 1999; 93: 2025-2032Google Scholar) constructed in pTrcHisA vector (Invitrogen). The HRM-encoding fragment was also subcloned into the EcoRI site of pGEX-1λT vector (Amersham Biosciences) to obtain the GST-HRM protein. A similar strategy was carried up to generate each HRM mutant molecule. The following oligonucleotides annealed to their complementary sequences were used: 5′-pAGCACGGCGGATGGCTCAACGGCGGATCCC-3′ (where p means 5′ phosphorylated oligonucleotide) for the HRM-P construct; 5′-pCCGTCAACCGCGAACCCGAGCACCGCGAAT-3′ for the HRM-N construct, and 5′-pAGCACGGCGAAACCGTCAACGGCGAAACCC-3′ for the HRM-K construct. Ligation assays were performed as before but in the presence of SmaI for the HRM-P and HRM-K constructs and SspI for the HRM-N constructs. EcoRI adaptors (5′-AATTCTCAGGT-3′ and 5′-ACCTGAG-3′) were annealed and ligated to the purified blunt-ended fragments for their direct cloning into the pTSac. To obtain shorter HRM extensions, the corresponding annealed oligonucleotides were subjected to a single ligation round, and then the pool was ligated to the annealed 5′-AATTCACCTCAACGGCCGACCCCTCAACTGC-3′ and 5′-GCAGTTGAGGGGTCGGCCGTTGAGGTG-3′ oligonucleotide pair and cloned in the EcoRI site of the pTSac. A clone containing seven repetitive units in frame with the TS, as determined by DNA sequencing, was selected. The entire rat liver tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) cDNA (GenBank™ NM 012668) was gently provided by Dr. C. Nowicki in a plasmid constructed in pET24 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and amplified by PCR (primers 5′-ACTCGAGAAGGCCAGATGGGACGTG-3′ and 5′-CGGTACCATATTTGTCACACTCCTCCT-3′). After XhoI/KpnI digestion (sites underlined in the sequences), the amplicon was inserted upstream of the HRM containing 21 repetitive units encoding sequence previously subcloned into the EcoRI site of pTrcHisA (Invitrogen). The degenerate repetitive sequence of the sialidase from Actinomyces viscosus strain DSM43798 (32Henningsen M. Roggentin P. Schauer R. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1991; 372: 1065-1072Google Scholar) (GenBank™ X62276/L06898) was obtained by KpnI/SacI digestion of a plasmid containing the whole nanH gene, a kind generous of Drs. R. Schauer and P. Roggentin. The fragment was ligated to EcoRI adaptors constructed with the oligonucleotide pairs 5′-AATTCTAATCACGAGCT-3′/5′-CGTGATTAG-3′ and 5′-AATTCGCCTCAGGGTAC-3′/5′-CCTGAGGCG-3′ and inserted into the pTSac as above. The C terminus of the sialidase A encoded by the nanA gene from Streptococcus pneumoniae (33Camara M. Boulnois G.J. Andrew P.W. Mitchell T.J. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3688-3695Google Scholar) (GenBank™ number Q59959) was amplified from genomic DNA using the primers 5′-CGAATGGAATGAACGGAA-3′ and 5′-TATACTCTGCGATTTCAT-3′. The PCR product was cloned into the pGEM T-easy vector, released by EcoRI digestion, and subcloned into the pTSac. The same strategy was employed to clone the hydrophilic extension of a TS-like gene from Trypanosoma carassii (34Agüero F. Campo V. Cremona L. Jager A. Di Noia J.M. Overath P. Sánchez D.O. Frasch A.C. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 7140-7144Google Scholar) (GenBank™ number AY249142) (primers 5′-ATCCTTCCGTTGTGAAAC-3′/5′-TCAATCTTGTCCGACTTTAGG-3′) and the C terminus of the EspF protein from the enteropathogenic Escherichia coli O145:NM strain (35McNamara B.P. Donnenberg M.S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 166: 71-78Google Scholar, 36Elliott S.J. O'Connell C.B. Koutsouris A. Brinkley C. Donnenberg M.S. Hecht G. Kaper J.B. Infect.

All constructs were subjected to DNA sequencing, and the molecular properties of the encoded proteins were predicted with the aid of the LaserGene software (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI). Expression, Purification, and in Vitro Evaluation of Recombinant Proteins—TS and TAT recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene) and purified to homogeneity, as judged by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE, by immobilized metal affinity chromatography through Ni2+-charged Hi-Trap chelating columns using the His tag located at their N termini provided by their respective cloning vectors, followed by ion exchange chromatography through MonoQ columns (both from Amersham Biosciences). GST, GST-SAPA (12Buscaglia C.A. Alfonso J. Campetella O. Frasch A.C. Blood. 1999; 93: 2025-2032Google Scholar), and GST-HRM proteins were purified by affinity chromatography through GSTrap columns (Amersham Biosciences) following manufacturers' guidelines. Pharmacokinetics Studies—Mice were intravenously injected with 3 μg (30–40 pmol) of the indicated TS recombinant protein contained in 0.2 ml of PBS by the retro-ocular sinus. Blood samples were taken from the tail at different intervals as required by each experimental design. Sera were assayed for remnant TS activity by measuring the transference of the sialyl residue from sialyl-lactose (Sigma) to [14C]lactose (Amersham Biosciences) as described (37Leguizamón M.S. Campetella O.E. González Cappa S.M. Frasch A.C. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3441-3446Google Scholar). Results were calculated in cpm/μl of plasma as enzyme source. Specific TS activity, thermal inactivation at 37 °C, and proteolytic degradation in normal mouse plasma (12Buscaglia C.A. Alfonso J. Campetella O. Frasch A.C. Blood. 1999; 93: 2025-2032Google Scholar, 27Buscaglia C.A. Campetella O. Leguizamón M.S. Frasch A.C. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 177: 431-436Google Scholar) rendered similar values for every chimeric TS generated (data not shown). TAT and TAT-HRM proteins were labeled with 125I (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using IODO-GEN-coated tubes (Pierce), and unincorporated 125I was removed by Hi-Trap Desalting columns (Amersham Biosciences). About 1.5 × 106 cpm (specific activities: TAT, 145,000 cpm/μg; TAT-HRM, 475,000 cpm/μg) were given intravenously in 0.2 ml of PBS. Fractions of the sera collected at different times postinjection were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and labeled proteins were quantified by 1D Image Analysis software (Eastman Kodak Co.) after autoradiography. In all cases, results were expressed relative to values found at the 3-min postinjection time that was taken as 100%. The intravascular half-life values (t of the elimination phase, tβ) were determined from the second part of the decay curve by least squares regression using the slope of a curve fitted to the data points (16Chapman A.P. Antoniw P. Spitali M. West S. Stephens S. King D.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 780-783Google Scholar, 38Pollock R.R. French D.L. Metlay J.P. Birshtein B.K. Scharff M.D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 2021-2027Google Scholar). Animal Immunization and Antibody Evaluation—Mice were administered with four intravenous doses (10 μg/each) of recombinant TS proteins every 10 days by the retro-ocular route. One week after the last dose, the reactivity of sera toward the SAPA or HRM repetitive motif was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Briefly, polystyrene microplates (Maxisorp; NUNC a/s, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with GST-SAPA or GST-HRM (100 ng/well, about 1.6 pmol of GST-SAPA, or 2.3 pmol of GST-HRM) in PBS overnight. Wells coated with GST were used as negative controls. The amount of GST fusion proteins in each plate was tested assaying three wells/plate with proper dilutions of an anti-GST rabbit serum. Plates were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in PBS for 2 h at room temperature, and then serial serum dilutions (100 μl/well) were seeded and incubated for 1 h. Reaction was revealed by the addition of peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) followed by 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (Roche Diagnostics). Each sample was tested in triplicate. Sera obtained from naive animals and assayed in the same plate were taken as negative controls. SPOT Assays—B-cell epitope mapping of antigen Tc13 was achieved by SPOT assay as described (39Alvarez P. Leguizamón M.S. Buscaglia C.A. Pitcovsky T.A. Campetella O. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7946-7949Google Scholar). Briefly, filters containing peptide spots (Sigma) were treated with casein-based blocking buffer and sera from either rabbits or mice immunized with a GST-Tc13 fusion protein (12Buscaglia C.A. Alfonso J. Campetella O. Frasch A.C. Blood. 1999; 93: 2025-2032Google Scholar) emulsified in Freund's adjuvant were tested at 1:200 dilution. After extensive washings, secondary antibodies coupled to alkaline phosphatase (DAKO Corp., Carpinteria, CA) were added at 1:1,000 dilution, and a reaction was developed with 5-Br-4-Cl-3-indolyl phosphate/3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (both from Sigma). Statistical Analyses—Student's t test was used. Design of a Novel Motif Derived from T. cruzi Repetitive Antigens—Both SAPA (SSAHSTPSTPAD) and Tc13 (PKSAE) repetitive antigens from T. cruzi were shown to extend the half-life of associated proteins in blood (12Buscaglia C.A. Alfonso J. Campetella O. Frasch A.C. Blood. 1999; 93: 2025-2032Google Scholar), thus providing a model to search for primary sequences involved in this phenomenon. Sequence alignments indicate that the Tc13 repetitive unit resembles the PSTPAD sequence embedded in the SAPA repetitive unit (Fig. 1A). To design a novel repetitive sequence with potential biotechnological applications, two parameters were considered: the minimum amino acid length required and its potential immunogenicity. In this context, the second SAPA proline (PSTPAD) was precluded from the design, since it plays a central role in SAPA antigenicity (39Alvarez P. Leguizamón M.S. Buscaglia C.A. Pitcovsky T.A. Campetella O. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7946-7949Google Scholar). To disclose the antigenic organization of the Tc13 repeat, we scanned for its B-cell linear epitopes through the SPOT technique (40Frank R. Overwin H. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 66: 149-169Google Scholar). Sera from Tc13 repeat-immunized mice and rabbits were tested against peptides covering the five possible hexamers that can be constructed with the repeat sequence. As shown in Fig. 1B, both species highlight a similar epitope (KSAE for rabbits and KSAEP for mice), indicating the presence of a single antigenic determinant per repeat unit. It can also be concluded from these assays that the lysine residue is involved in Tc13 immunogenicity, whereas the counterpart serine residue in SAPA (PSTPAD) does not participate in the epitope structure of this molecule (39Alvarez P. Leguizamón M.S. Buscaglia C.A. Pitcovsky T.A. Campetella O. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7946-7949Google Scholar). Taking these results altogether, both the second proline from SAPA and the lysine from Tc13 were excluded, and the 5-amino acid-long motif PSTAD named HRM was designed (Fig. 1A). Sera from rabbits and mice immunized with either GST-SAPA or GST-Tc13 antigens were unable to recognize TS-HRM (not shown), confirming that the main B-cell epitopes present in both parental sequences were disrupted. The HRM Motif Extends the Bloodstream Half-life of Genetically Fused Proteins—The use of TS as a reporter protein in pharmacokinetic assays was previously validated (12Buscaglia C.A. Alfonso J. Campetella O. Frasch A.C. Blood. 1999; 93: 2025-2032Google Scholar). It also provides some experimental advantages such as its easy enzymatic activity measurement and the absence of specific inhibitors in normal mammalian serum (41Leguizamón M.S. Russomando G. Luquetti A. Rassi A. Almiron M. González-Cappa S.M. Frasch A.C. Campetella O. J. Infect. Dis. 1997; 175: 1272-1275Google Scholar). Therefore, 21 HRM units were inserted in frame at the C terminus of TS (TS-HRM; Fig. 2A). This addendum is roughly equivalent in mass to nine SAPA repeats, thus slightly above the threshold of eight SAPA units determined to improve the TS permanence in the circulation (12Buscaglia C.A. Alfonso J. Campetella O. Frasch A.C. Blood. 1999; 93: 2025-2032Google Scholar). TS-HRM protein was injected into mice by the intravenous route, and remnant TS activity was monitored in blood samples collected at different times postinjection. As controls, three different TS proteins previously characterized (12Buscaglia C.A. Alfonso J. Campetella O. Frasch A.C. Blood. 1999; 93: 2025-2032Google Scholar) were used (see Fig. 2A). All of these proteins exhibit similar specific TS activity when assayed in vitro (data not shown) and were thus administered in equimolar amounts (35–40 pmol/mouse). As shown in Fig. 2B, TS-HRM and TS-SAPA displayed similar half-lives (tβ of 40 and 39 h, respectively) and can be detected in the bloodstream up to 3 days postinjection. In contrast, TS without any C-terminal extension was absent from circulation, and only 10% of the input of the TS harboring three SAPA repeats (TS-3R) remained after 24 h. In a separate set of experiments, a TS with only seven HRM-associated motifs, roughly equivalent in mass to three SAPA units, was also tested, displaying a similar half-life to that estimated for the TS-3R molecule (tβ of 24 versus 18 h, respectively), thus suggesting that HRM and SAPA motifs share similar pharmacokinetic characteristics. To assay whether the effect of the HRM motif can be extended to proteins other than TS, the rat liver TAT was chosen as a mammalian protein model. The purified recombinant TAT and TAT-HRM proteins were 125I-labeled and administered intravenously. From the plotting of the autoradiographic signals derived from SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2C), the half-life of the TAT-HRM was extended about 6 times when compared with that of TAT (from 1.3 to 7.9 h). Findings displayed in Fig. 2 indicate that the HRM motif abridges all the molecular features involved in the stabilization properties of both SAPA and Tc13 parental sequences. The HRM Motif Displays Lower Immunogenicity than SAPA—To evaluate the immunogenic properties of the HRM repeat, mice were intravenously administered with four doses either of TS-HRM, TS-3R, or TS-SAPA (10 μg/each, Fig. 2A) and the specific antibody response directed against the repetitive domains was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Although intravenous injection often leads to poor immune responses, high titers of SAPA directed antibodies were detected in TS-SAPA-immunized animals (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the TS-3R protein that contains only three SAPA-repeats and is rapidly cleared from the circulation (Fig. 2B) elicits a similar humoral response as TS-SAPA (Fig. 3). In contrast, the HRM motif displays a significantly reduced immunogenicity although it harbors 21 repetitive units. Reactivity of sera from TS-HRM-immunized animals remained under the cut-off value at the end of the immunization schedule (Fig. 3). Overall, selected amino acid replacements introduced to generate the HRM molecule significantly impair its immunogenic properties, probably by disruption of both SAPA and Tc13 B-cell epitopes (see above and Fig. 1). Therefore, the designed HRM repetitive motif retains the ability to lengthen the permanence of associated proteins in blood while exhibiting a remarkable reduction in its immunogenic properties. Mapping of Residues Involved in HRM Stabilization Properties—Critical amino acid residues involved in the HRM-mediated blood stability were then searched by site-directed mutagenesis. For this purpose, several constructs derived from the HRM sequence were designed and cloned at the TS C terminus. Recombinant proteins having similar mass addenda to TS-HRM were assayed (for molecular properties, see Fig. 4A). Since the repetitive antigens used herein are embedded in a proline framework (Fig. 1A), we first tested the effect of a longer interproline distance in the pharmacokinetics of the HRM molecule. A repeat unit with prolines spaced by 10 residues was built by replacing prolines for glycine in alternating repeats (PSTADGSTAD, termed HRM-P). As shown in Fig. 4B, the TS-HRM-P fusion protein renders a similar bloodstream half-life value as compared with the parental TS-HRM molecule (tβ of 38 and 40 h, respectively). The second relevant feature displayed by both SAPA and HRM is a biased amino acid composition toward negatively charged residues (Figs. 1A and 2A). Therefore, we replaced the aspartate residue of HRM either for asparagine (PSTAN, termed HRM-N) or lysine (PSTAK, termed HRM-K). The TS-HRM-N recombinant protein displayed the same in vivo performance (tβ = 39 h) as the TS-HRM, indicating that this modification imposes minor constraints on its stabilization properties (Fig. 4B). Conversely, replacement of aspartate by lysine significantly drops the mean residence time of the TS-HRM-K molecule in blood (tβ = 11 h; Fig. 4C). This value is similar to that recorded for the TS without a C terminus extension and then even below that of the TS-3R molecule (tβ of 9 and 18 h, respect"

Moreover, a UQ2 reductase assay with a UQ-related inhibitor (C49) revealed different inhibition kinetics between the wild-type mGDH and UQ8-free mGDH. From these findings, we propose that the native mGDH bears two ubiquinone-binding sites, one (QI) for bound UQ8 in its molecule and the other (QII) for UQ8 in the ubiquinone pool, and that the bound UQ8 in the QI site acts as a single electron mediator in the intramolecular electron transfer in mGDH.

Our understanding of the interaction with UQ or its involvement in catalytic reactions in membrane-bound PQQ-containing dehydrogenases, however, is limited. The UQ reduction site (interacting with bulk UQ) in mGDH has been shown to be located near the membrane surface (20.Miyoshi H. Niitome Y. Matsushita K. Yamada M. Iwamura H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1412: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), which idea was strengthened from the findings that its C-terminal periplasmic domain, interacting peripherally with the membrane, possesses the UQ reduction site (21.Elias MD.

Among other primary dehydrogenases, both the FAD-containing succinate dehydrogenase and the subunit NuoM of NADH-UQ oxidoreductase in E. coli include at least one UQ-binding site (23.Yankovskaya V.

In the E. coli cytochrome bo3 complex, bound UQ8 at the QH site acts as a transient electron reservoir between the two-electron oxidation of the UQH2 pool and the one-electron (at a time) reduction of oxygen at the heme-copper center (30.Sato-Watanabe M.

However, there are no reports available on a bound UQ such as this in PQQ-containing dehydrogenases or on its physical role in the intramolecular electron transfer in primary dehydrogenases. Here we have discovered a bound UQ8 in the E. coli mGDH molecule and have postulated its functional role in the enzyme turnover. By comparing EPR spectra and the effects of inhibitors on UQ2 reductase activity between native and UQ8-free mGDHs, we propose that mGDH possesses two UQ-binding sites, QI for bound UQ8 and QII for bulk UQ pool, and that UQ8 at the QI site functions as a single electron transfer gate in mGDH. Because mGDH has a simpler structure compared with other dehydrogenases, it can be a model for elucidating the mechanism of intramolecular electron flow to bulk UQ. Materials—UQn were kindly provided by Eizai Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). UQ analogues were synthesized as described previously (35.Sakamoto K. Miyoshi H. Matsushita K. Nakagawa M. Ikeda J. Ohshima M. Adachi O. Akagi T. Iwamura H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were of analytical grade and obtained from commercial sources. Bacterial Strains—The E. coli K-12 strains used in this study were W3110 (IN (rrnD-rrnE) rph-1) (36.Yamada M. Talukder A.A. Nitta T J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1838-1846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), MU1227 (cyo+ cyd+ ubiA::cml) (37.Suzuki K. Ueda M. Yuasa M. Nakagawa T. Kawamukai M. Matsuda H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1994; 58: 1814-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and YU654 (W3110, ubiA::cml). YU654 was constructed by transferring ubiA::cml from MU1227, which was performed by P1 transduction (38.Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). W3110 and YU654 were used as host strains for purification of the wild-type mGDH and ΔUbiA mGDH, respectively. Purification of the Wild-type mGDH and ΔUbiA mGDH—W3110 cells harboring pUCGCD1 (39.Yamada M. Asaoka S. Saier Jr., M.H. Yamada Y. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 568-571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and YU654 (ubiA::cml) cells harboring pUCGCD1 were grown in LB medium (1% Bacto-tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 0.5% NaCl) containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) for 8 h at 30 °C under aeration conditions (150 rpm). Harvesting of cells and the preparation of membrane fractions were carried out as described by Yamada et al. (6.Yamada M. Sumi K. Matsushita K. Adachi O. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12812-12817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of mGDH from membrane fractions was performed at 4 °C by the following procedure modified from the previous one (6.Yamada M. Sumi K. Matsushita K. Adachi O. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12812-12817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with two column chromatographies of DEAE-Toyopearl (Toyo Soda) and ceramic hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad). In the case of purification with Triton X-100, membrane fractions (∼10 mg/ml of protein) were washed with 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (KPB) (pH 7.0) containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and subsequently mGDH was solubilized from the washed membrane with 10 mm KPB (pH 7.0) containing 1.0% Triton X-100 and 100 mm KCl. The solubilized sample was dialyzed and then applied onto a DEAE-Toyopearl column as described previously (6.Yamada M. Sumi K. Matsushita K. Adachi O. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12812-12817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 1 mm KPB (pH 6.8) containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The dialysate was applied onto a ceramic hydroxyapatite column (1-ml bed volume/∼5 mg of protein) equilibrated with 1 mm KPB (pH 6.8) containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The column was washed with 10 bed volumes of 2 mm KPB (pH 6.8) containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The enzyme was eluted by a linear gradient composed of 10 bed volumes of 3 mm KPB (pH 7.0) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 10 bed volumes of 12 mm KPB (pH 7.0) containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The active fractions that resulted at ∼6 mm KPB (pH 7.0) were pooled. In the case of purification with DM, membrane fractions (∼10 mg/ml of protein) were washed with 10 mm KPB (pH 7.0) containing 0.04% DM, and the washed membrane fractions were subjected to solubilization for 60 min in the presence of 10 mm KPB (pH 7.0) containing 0.2% DM and 100 mm KCl. The suspension was centrifuged at 86,000 × g for 90 min, and the supernatant obtained was dialyzed against the same buffer without DM. The dialysate was applied onto a DEAE-Toyopearl column (1-ml bed volume/∼10 mg of protein) equilibrated with 10 mm KPB (pH 7.0) containing 0.1% DM. The column was washed with 10 bed volumes of the same buffer and successively with 10 bed volumes of 10 mm KPB (pH 7.0) containing 0.02% DM. The enzyme was eluted by a linear gradient composed of 10 bed volumes of the same buffer and 10 bed volumes of 10 mm KPB (pH 7.0) containing 0.02% DM and 120 mm KCl. The active fractions eluted at ∼70 mm KCl were pooled and dialyzed against the same buffer containing 0.02% DM. The dialysate was applied onto a ceramic hydroxyapatite column (1-ml bed volume/∼5 mg of protein) equilibrated with 10 mm KPB (pH 7.0) containing 0.02% DM. The column was washed with 10 bed volumes of 200 mm KPB (pH 7.0) containing 0.02% DM. mGDH was eluted by a linear gradient composed of 10 bed volumes of 200 mm KPB (pH 7.0) containing 0.02% DM and 10 bed volumes of 1 m KPB (pH 7.0) containing 0.02% DM. The active fractions (at ∼700 mm KPB, pH 7.0) were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mm KPB (pH 7.0) containing 0.02% DM. In all cases, the active fractions (pooled after the ceramic hydroxyapatite column) were concentrated by a DEAE-Toyopearl column (1-ml bed volume/∼10 mg of protein) in which the enzyme adsorbed was eluted with a small volume of 10 mm KPB (pH 7.0) containing the respective detergents (0.2% Triton X-100 or 0.1% DM) and 150 mm KCl and were then finally dialyzed against 10 mm KPB (pH 7.0) to reduce salt concentration in the enzyme solution. These concentrated materials were found to have a homogeneity of ∼95% (judging from SDS-7% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and were used as the purified wild-type mGDH with Triton X-100 or wild-type mGDH and ΔUbiA mGDH with DM. Quantitation of Bound Ubiquinone in Purified Wild-type and ΔUbiA mGDHs—Approximately 30 nmol of enzyme were treated with 10 bed volumes of 100% ethanol in the presence of 30 nmol of UQ10 as an internal standard and incubated for 1 h with gentle shaking at 30 °C. The solution was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min to remove denatured protein molecules. The supernatant was mixed with 2.5 bed volumes of n-hexane for 1 min. The upper phase was collected and dried, and the residue was then resolved in 0.1 ml of HPLC solvent (ethanol/methanol/acetonitrile, 4:3:3 v/v). The resolved materials were subjected to reverse-phase HPLC using a Zorbax ODS column (Mitsuitoatsu) at the flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The elution was monitored at 278 nm by using an SPD-M6A photodiode array detector (Shimadzu). UQ was identified by comparison of its migration with those of standard UQs (UQ8 and UQ10), and the content was estimated from the ratio of the peak area to that of the internal standard UQ10. Treatment of Purified Wild-type mGDH with an Excess Amount of C49 Inhibitor—Approximately 10 nmol of purified wild-type mGDH were incubated with 10 μmol of a synthetic capsaicin analogue, C49 (35.Sakamoto K. Miyoshi H. Matsushita K. Nakagawa M. Ikeda J. Ohshima M. Adachi O. Akagi T. Iwamura H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), for 1 h at 25 °C. The following procedures were then carried out at 4 °C. The enzyme sample was charged on a DEAE-Toyopearl column that had been equilibrated with 10 mm KPB (pH 7.0) containing 0.1% DM. The column was washed with 10 bed volumes of the same buffer. The enzyme was eluted with the same buffer containing 150 mm KCl, and the eluted enzyme was dialyzed against 10 mm KPB (pH 7.0). Bound UQ8, in this eluted mGDH, was extracted and quantitated by reverse-phase HPLC as described above. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption and Ionization Time-of-flight Mass Spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF/MS)—Compounds eluted from the reverse-phase HPLC column were collected, dried, and resolved in 0.1 ml of 100% ethanol. The resolved materials were placed on the analyzing plate. The molecular mass of these compounds was determined on a Voyager MALDI-TOF/MS device (Perseptive Biosystems). The spectra obtained by this process were analyzed using Micromass software. EPR Spectroscopy—X-band (9.36 GHz) continuous wave spectra were recorded on an Elexsys E-500 spectrophotometer (Bruker) at 20 K, which was equipped with an Oxford helium cryostat (ESR 900). The concentrated enzyme solution (30 μm) in extra high quality quartz tubes (5-mm outer diameter) was frozen in liquid nitrogen. The applied microwave power was 0.1 mW; field modulation frequency, 100 kHz; field modulation amplitude, 1 G; and temperature, 20 K. In the power saturation experiments, the microwave power was varied between 200 μW and 10 mW, and the temperature was varied between 6 and 77 K. Spectral intensity was estimated by the double integration of spectra and the compared obtained values to that from the signal of Methylobacterium extorquens MDH (30 μm) on the assumption that the PQQ in the MDH is in the 100% semiquinone radical form. Measurement of Protein and Enzyme Activities—Protein content was determined according to the Dulley and Grieve method (40.Dulley J.R. Grieve P.A. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 64: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Holoenzyme formation was performed by incubating the purified enzyme in 10 mm 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (pH 7.0) containing 30 μm PQQ and 1 mm MgCl2 for 30 min at 25 °C. Using the holoenzyme thus prepared, the following enzyme activities were measured. Phenazine-methosulfate reductase activity was measured spectrophotometrically (U-2000A, Hitachi) with phenazine methosulfate and dichloroindophenol as an electron mediator and acceptor, respectively, as described previously (17.Elias MD. Tanaka M. Izu H. Matsushita K. Adachi O. Yamada M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7321-7326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). UQ2 reductase activity was spectrophotometrically measured as described by Elias et al. (17.Elias MD. Tanaka M. Izu H. Matsushita K. Adachi O. Yamada M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7321-7326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Inhibition of UQ2 reductase activity was examined by incubating the reaction mixture with different concentrations of inhibitor for 4 min before starting the reaction. One unit of phenazine-methosulfate reductase or UQ2 reductase activity is defined as 1 μmol of dichloroindophenol or UQ2, respectively, reduced/min, both of which correspond to 1 μmol of glucose oxidized/min. In UQ2 reductase assay, the Km and Vmax values and the Ki value for C49 were estimated on the basis of the Lineweaver-Burk plots. Absolute absorption spectra of apoform and holoform of the wild-type mGDH and ΔUbiA mGDH were taken before and after the addition of glucose as described (21.Elias MD. Tanaka M. Sakai M. Toyama H. Matsushita K. Adachi O. Yamada M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48356-48361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Determination of Bound UQ in mGDH—To examine whether bound UQ occurs in mGDH, the extract from the wild-type mGDH purified with DM was analyzed by a reverse-phase HPLC column. As shown in Fig. 1a, a compound corresponding to the position of UQ8 was detected at 17 min of retention time, which showed an absorption spectrum with a peak at 278 nm. Based on comparison of the retention time and absorption spectrum with those of standard UQs, it was suggested that the compound extracted is UQ8. The fraction at 17 min of retention time was then collected and subjected to MALDI-TOF/MS analysis. The obtained mass (727.44) of the compound in the fraction was found to be identical with that of UQ8. We further examined the UQ8-free mGDH (ΔUbiA mGDH) purified from the ubiA::cml strain, being defective of UQ biosynthesis. No such peak corresponding to that of UQ8 was detected in the ΔUbiA mGDH (Fig. 1b). Quantitative determination of UQ was performed by calculation of the peak area and by comparison with that of UQ10 as an internal standard (Fig. 1a). As a result, 0.9 ± 0.02 mol of UQ8/1 mol of mGDH was recovered from the wild-type mGDH purified with DM. In contrast, only a trace amount of UQ8 was detected from the wild-type mGDH purified with Triton X-100. This observation is consistent with the fact that bound UQ8 was lost in purified E. coli cytochrome bo complex when Triton X-100 was used as a detergent (30.Sato-Watanabe M. Mogi T. Ogura T. Kitagawa T. Miyoshi H. Iwamura H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28908-28912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether this UQ8 in the purified wild-type mGDH can be removed by the addition of UQ analogue, we incubated the purified wild-type mGDH with an excess amount of C49, a capsaicin analogue shown to be a competitive inhibitor against UQ2 in mGDH of E. coli (35.Sakamoto K. Miyoshi H. Matsushita K. Nakagawa M. Ikeda J. Ohshima M. Adachi O. Akagi T. Iwamura H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The recovery of UQ8 after treatment with a 1000-fold excess of C49 was identical to that without the inhibitor. Taken together, our results suggest that one molecule of UQ8 tightly binds to a specific site in the native mGDH molecule and the site seems to be different from the site for bulk UQ8. EPR Spectra of the Wild-type mGDH and ΔUbiA mGDH— mGDH occurs as an apoenzyme in E. coli (9.Matsushita K. Arents J.C. Bader R. Yamada D.M. Adachi O. Postma P.W. Microbiology (Read.). 1997; 143: 3149-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and the active holoenzyme is reconstituted with authentic PQQ and a divalent cation. The incorporated PQQ is reduced to PQQH2 by the addition of glucose. To elucidate the role of bound UQ8 in intramolecular electron transfer during the catalytic reaction of mGDH, EPR spectra were recorded on the holoenzymes of wild-type and ΔUbiA mGDHs purified with DM, and the obtained spectra were compared. No significant EPR signals were detected from both types of apo-mGDHs (Fig. 2). A small signal appeared at g = 2.0034 in the wild-type holo-mGDH (Fig. 2a). The signal was largely increased by the addition of glucose and then decreased by the subsequent addition of ferricyanide, an artificial single electron acceptor (data not shown). These results indicate the existence of a single electron acceptor inside the wild-type mGDH molecule, which may receive one electron from PQQH2 to form a PQQH semiquinone radical. We assume that the bound UQ8 in the enzyme, which was demonstrated above, acts as the single electron acceptor from PQQH2. On the other hand, completely different patterns of EPR spectra were observed when the ΔUbiA mGDH was examined. A large signal at g = 2.0034 was observed in the holo-ΔUbiA mGDH without the addition of glucose, suggesting generation of a semiquinone radical of PQQ. The signal was decreased by the addition of glucose (Fig. 2b). This reduction may be due to the formation of PQQH2 from the semiquinone radical. In the control experiments, an EPR signal was detected neither from PQQ only nor from PQQ plus Mg2+ in the same buffer as was used for the experiments with mGDH protein. Spectra obtained from both glucose-PQQ wild-type mGDH and PQQ-ΔUbiA mGDH showed almost the same features with a small shoulder at the lower field side and a broadened half-signal at the higher field side of the first derivative spectrum, suggesting rhombic anisotropy. This feature did not change when the microwave power was varied between 200 μW and 10 mW at 20 K, and only saturation broadening of the signals was observed at the higher powers.

E1A, an adenoviral oncoprotein, is known to inhibit TGF-beta-induced transactivation through binding to Smad proteins. Recently, an EID-1 (E1A-like inhibitor of differentiation-1) and EID-2 (EID-1-like inhibitor of differentiation-2) were identified. In this study, we examined the effect of EID-2 on Smad-mediated TGF-beta signaling. Here, we show that EID-2 inhibits TGF-beta/Smad transcriptional responses. EID-2 interacts constitutively with Smad proteins, and most strongly with Smad3. Stable expression of EID-2 in the TGF-beta1-responsive cell line inhibits endogenous Smad3-Smad4 complex formation and TGF-beta1-induced expression of p21 and p15. These results suggest that EID-2 may function as an endogenous suppressor of TGF-beta signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1963972537,"Two nearly identical, <i>gst</i>D21(L) and <i>gst</i>D21(S) mRNAs, whose polyadenylation sites differ by 19 nucleotides, are transcribed from the intronless glutathione <i>S</i>-transferase D21 gene in <i>Drosophila</i>. Both mRNAs are intrinsically very labile, but exposure to pentobarbital renders them stabilized beyond what can be attributed to transcriptional activation. We have reconstituted this PB-mediated mRNA stabilization in a transgene (D21L) that contains the full-length <i>gst</i>D21(L) sequence. We have also constructed a similar transgene (D21L-UTR), which matches D21L but excluded the native 3′-UTR. D21L-UTR produces a relatively stable RNA, whose stability is unaffected by pentobarbital. Following pentobarbital treatment of wild-type flies, the levels of <i>gst</i>D21(L) and <i>gst</i>D21(S) mRNAs hold at a relatively constant ratio (L/S) of 1.4 ± 0.2. In transgenic flies, heat shock induction of D21L mRNA changed the L/S ratio to 0.6 ± 0.1, and it was further reduced to 0.3 ± 0.1 as D21L mRNA accumulated in the presence of PB. The ratio returned nearly normal (1.1 ± 0.1) as the D21L mRNA decayed over 12 h after terminating induction. In constrast, when D21L-UTR was present, the ratio remained constant (1.7 ± 0.2) even under various induction conditions and during recovery. Thus, the 3′-UTR, which was the critical difference between these two transgenes, must have some role in determining the L/S ratio. Induced D21L mRNA alone is not sufficient to cause reversible changes in the ratio. Such changes require the presence of pentobarbital. Therefore, pentobarbital may regulate this L/S ratio by affecting the choice of polyadenylation sites for the <i>gst</i>D21 mRNAs through sensing the concentrations of the native 3′-UTR sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2004835869,"Previously, the histidine residue at position 16 in the mature T4 pyrimidine dimer glycosylase (T4-PDG) protein has been suggested to be involved in general (non-target) DNA binding. This interpretation is likely correct, but, in and of itself, cannot account for the most dramatic phenotype of mutants at this position: their inability to restore ultraviolet light resistance to a DNA repair-deficient Escherichia coli strain. Accordingly, this residue has been mutated to serine, glutamic, aspartic acid, lysine, cysteine, and alanine. The mutant proteins were expressed, purified, and their abilities to carry out several functions of T4-PDG were assessed. The mutant proteins were able to perform most functions tested in vitro, albeit at reduced rates compared with the wild type protein. The most likely explanation for the biochemical phenotypes of the mutants is that the histidine residue is required for rapid turnover of the enzyme. This role is interpreted and discussed in the context of a reaction mechanism able to account for the complete spectrum of products generated by T4-PDG during a single turnover cycle."
