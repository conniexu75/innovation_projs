https://openalex.org/W2021232512,"Microsomal cytochrome P450 family 1 enzymes play prominent roles in xenobiotic detoxication and procarcinogen activation. P450 1A2 is the principal cytochrome P450 family 1 enzyme expressed in human liver and participates extensively in drug oxidations. This enzyme is also of great importance in the bioactivation of mutagens, including the N-hydroxylation of arylamines. P450-catalyzed reactions involve a wide range of substrates, and this versatility is reflected in a structural diversity evident in the active sites of available P450 structures. Here, we present the structure of human P450 1A2 in complex with the inhibitor α-naphthoflavone, determined to a resolution of 1.95 Aå. α-Naphthoflavone is bound in the active site above the distal surface of the heme prosthetic group. The structure reveals a compact, closed active site cavity that is highly adapted for the positioning and oxidation of relatively large, planar substrates. This unique topology is clearly distinct from known active site architectures of P450 family 2 and 3 enzymes and demonstrates how P450 family 1 enzymes have evolved to catalyze efficiently polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon oxidation. This report provides the first structure of a microsomal P450 from family 1 and offers a template to study further structure-function relationships of alternative substrates and other cytochrome P450 family 1 members.

Enzymes of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 5CYP and P450 are generic terms for a cytochrome P450 enzyme. Individual P450s are identified using a number-letter-number format based on amino acid sequence relatedness. superfamily play a significant physiologic role in the detoxication of foreign compounds and the biosynthesis of endogenous compounds, including steroid hormones, bile acids, and cholesterol. The enzymes comprising P450 families 1, 2, and 3 contribute most extensively to the biotransformation of xenobiotics to more polar metabolites that are more readily excreted. In humans and most mammals, family 1 contains three well characterized P450 monooxygenases; 1A1, 1A2, and 1B1. These enzymes are generally distinguished from P450s in other families by their capacity to oxidize a variety of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). 6The abbreviations used are: PAH, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon; ANF, α-naphthoflavone; PEG, polyethylene glycol; PDB, Protein Data Bank. Moreover, the expression levels of the three enzymes are induced by exposure to PAHs (1Nebert D.W. Dalton T.P. Okey A.B. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23847-23850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). The induction is mediated by a ligand-activated transcription factor, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which is a basic-loop-helix PAS domain protein that binds to enhancer elements flanking the CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1 genes and stimulates transcription. The oxidation of PAHs is generally protective. However, some P450-catalyzed reactions can transform these relatively inert compounds into genotoxic metabolites that can initiate mutagenesis and cancer. Human P450 1A2 is notable among family 1 enzymes for the capacity to N-oxidize arylamines, the major metabolic process in the bioactivation of arylamines to potent mutagenic or carcinogenic compounds (2Kim D. Guengerich F.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2005; 45: 27-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). α-Naphthoflavone (ANF), a prototype flavonoid, is known to competitively inhibit P450s of family 1, albeit at different concentrations, and has been used to discriminate between P450 family 1 enzymes (3Shimada T. Yamazaki H. Foroozesh M. Hopkins N.E. Alworth W.L. Guengerich F.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 1048-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Flavonoids have gained recent interest in view of their potential therapeutic and prophylactic effects on P450-mediated chemical carcinogenesis (4Hodek P. Trefil P. Stiborova M. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2002; 139: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). CYP1A2 is the principal family 1 enzyme expressed in human liver, and CYP1A2 contributes significantly to the hepatic metabolism of drugs, as recently reviewed (5Agundez J.A. Curr. Drug Metab. 2004; 5: 211-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Among liver P450 drug-metabolizing enzymes, P450 1A2 plays a predominant role in the metabolic clearance of caffeine and melatonin as well as of marketed drugs such as flutamide, lidocaine, olanzapine, tacrine, theophylline, triamterene, and zolmitriptan. Large inter-individual differences in CYP1A2 expression levels and catalytic activity contribute to significant differences between individuals in drug clearance. The basis for this variation is only partially understood. This report provides the first structural characterization of human CYP1A2 and is the first structure of a microsomal P450 from family 1. The structure reveals an enzyme that is highly adapted for the oxidation of relatively large, planar molecules such as (heterocyclic) arylamines and PAHs and provides a basis for understanding the unique roles this enzyme plays in the biotransformation of xenobiotics. CYP1A2 exhibits less than 40% amino acid sequence identity when compared with other structurally characterized mammalian microsomal P450s 2A6 (6Yano J.K. Hsu M.H. Griffin K.J. Stout C.D. Johnson E.F.

The P450 1A2 active site cavity complements the sizes, shapes, and chemical properties of the substrate binding sites determined for other human drug-metabolizing P450s, contributing to the overall capacity of P450s to oxidize a vast array of structurally dissimilar substrates. Expression and Purification of hP450 1A2—Plasmid vectors were constructed to express modified forms of human P450 1A2 in Escherichia coli. The modifications were designed to facilitate crystallization by removing the N-terminal transmembrane helical domain to reduce aggregation, increase solubility, and eliminate a flexible appendage that is not part of the catalytic domain. In the expression construct, the native sequence upstream of the polyproline motif at residue 42 was modified to correspond to a modified, truncated N-terminal sequence successfully employed for crystallization of P450s 2C5/3LVdH (8Williams P.A.

This was achieved using a forward PCR primer that encoded a 5′-NdeI restriction site, the modified N-terminal sequence MAKKTSSKGKL, and sequence encoding the native protein beginning at codon 42. The reverse primer encoded a HindIII restriction site, a stop codon, four histidine codons, and seven C-terminal codons of the protein. Following PCR amplification from a plasmid template containing the human CYP1A2 cDNA (17Quattrochi L.C. Pendurthi U.R. Okino S.T. Potenza C. Tukey R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6731-6735Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) kindly provided by Robert Tukey, University of California San Diego (UCSD), using high fidelity Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen), the PCR fragment was isolated and digested with the appropriate endonucleases for ligation into the pCWori vector. A series of alternative constructs was also generated that deleted the transmembrane helical domain but retained different portions of the native linker region preceding the proline-rich motif at the beginning of the catalytic domain. For the D24 construct used in this study, double-stranded oligonucleotides with appropriate overhangs were ligated into the initial expression vector designated G1, which had been digested with the endonucleases NdeI and NcoI. The D24 construct encodes residues 26-515 of the protein, preceded by codons for Met and Ala. Sequences of the primer pairs used in the design of the G1 and D24 constructs are provided in supplemental Table S1. Sequence analysis verified the construction of each expression vector for the predominant allelic variant CYP1A2*1A (GenBank™: P05177). E. coli strain DH5α was transformed with a CYP1A2 expression plasmid together with an expression plasmid for the chaperones GroEL and GroES (pGro7, Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan) to further improve the yield and stability of the proteins. Transformants were selected based on ampicillin and chloramphenicol resistance. Conditions for the growth, harvest, and purification of the proteins by metal ion affinity chromatography and CM-Sepharose chromatography in the presence of the detergent CYMAL-5 (Anatrace) closely followed procedures described previously (18Wester M.R. Stout C.D. Johnson E.F. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 357: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All buffers used for purification, storage, and crystallization of the protein contained 10 μm ANF to stabilize the modified human P450 1A2 constructs (19Sandhu P. Guo Z. Baba T. Martin M.V. Tukey R.H. Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 168-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The concentration of the protein was estimated by UV-visible difference spectroscopy for the CO-complex of the dithionite-reduced enzyme versus the reduced enzyme. Protein Crystallization—The modified CYP1A2 proteins were crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion. The vapor diffusion experiments were conducted at 298 K over a standard well solution (0.5 ml) composed of 10% PEG 3350, 20% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl in a Hepes buffer, pH 7.4. Protein drops were set up in a ratio of 1:1 protein detergent solution to precipitant solution. The setup allowed us to fine-tune the equilibration rate by only changing the precipitant solution in the experiment while holding the well solution constant. The protein detergent solution contained 1.25 μl of a concentrated protein solution mixed with detergent solution to contain 7.5 mm CYMAL-6 and 0.01 mm C12E8 (Anatrace). A precipitant solution containing 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5), 10% PEG 3350, and 50 mm ammonium iodide yielded crystals for the G1 construct from a protein solution at a concentration of 390 μm in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 μm ANF, 500 mm NaCl, and 20% glycerol. Crystals of the D24 construct were obtained by mixing a protein solution (400 μm) in N-(2-acetamido)-iminodiacetic acid buffer (pH 6.5) containing 10 μm ANF, 600 mm NaCl, and 20% glycerol with precipitant solution composed of 11% PEG 3350 and 75 mm ammonium nitrate in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5). Structure Determination—The G1 construct was crystallized initially. A complete data set to 2.9 Aå resolution was collected on a single crystal, using synchrotron radiation at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory beamline 9-1. Prior to x-ray exposure, the crystal was short-soaked in a cryoprotectant solution containing 0.05 m NaCl, 0.08 m NH4I, 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 8% PEG 3350, 5% glycerol, and 25% ethylene glycol before being flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data integration and scaling employed HKL2000 (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). A molecular replacement solution in space group P1 could be obtained with Phaser (22McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar) using the structure of CYP2A6 (PDB accession number 1Z10) as a probe. Four CYP1A2 molecules were independently positioned in the unit cell. Model building and comparison with electron density maps was done with the computer program O (23Jones T.A. Kjeldgaard M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 173-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) and iterated with refinement of the atomic coordinates and grouped B-factors by simulated annealing and/or minimization using CNS (24Brunger A.T.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) with the application of non-crystallographic symmetry restraints. This allowed construction of an initial CYP1A2 model for residues 42-513 of the native protein with the exception of an exterior loop encompassing residues 294-305. Statistics on data collection, processing, and refinement are provided in Table 1. Although the G1 construct produced crystals that exhibited higher symmetry, the diffraction quality could not be extended to higher resolution.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsHuman P450 1A2 constructG1D24D24Data collectionSpace groupP1P212121I222Used wavelength (Aå)0.980.980.98Resolution limit (Aå)aValues between parentheses indicate data in the highest resolution shell2.90 (2.98–2.90)2.45 (2.51–2.45)1.90 (1.95–1.90)Cell parametersa, b, c (Aå)63.45, 101.22, 103.3563.48, 181.78, 220.0879.63, 80.82, 175.82α, β, γ (°)81.97, 90.48, 88.12X-ray sourceBL9–1 SSRLBL11–1 SSRLBL11–1 SSRLTotal observations207212391400192055Unique reflectionsaValues between parentheses indicate data in the highest resolution shell532668946541139Completeness of all data (%)aValues between parentheses indicate data in the highest resolution shell94.4 (74.0)99.2 (99.6)92.2 (95.2)Mean I / σaValues between parentheses indicate data in the highest resolution shell15.6 (1.9)7.9 (1.3)4.0 (1.5)Rsym value (%)aValues between parentheses indicate data in the highest resolution shell,bRsym = ΣhΣj| [I(h) ] – I(h)j|/ΣhΣj [I(h) ], where I(h) is the intensity of an individual reflection and [I(h) ] is the mean intensity of that reflection9.6 (60.6)7.8 (53.0)9.2 (39.4)RefinementResolution range (Aå)25.0–2.9040.0–2.4529.5–1.95Reflections used505128887638022Reflections used in Rfree set268447021871Rcryst/RfreecRcryst or Rfree = Σ||Fo| – |Fc||/Σ|Fo|, where Fo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure factors, respectively0.250/0.2820.236/0.2810.226/0.267Protein atoms14840150903846Solvent atoms0129160Heme atoms17217243ANF atoms848421r.m.s. deviationdRoot mean square deviations relate to the Engh and Huber parameters (21)Bond angles (°)1.341.302.00Bond lengths (Aå)0.0070.0070.019a Values between parentheses indicate data in the highest resolution shellb Rsym = ΣhΣj| [I(h) ] – I(h)j|/ΣhΣj [I(h) ], where I(h) is the intensity of an individual reflection and [I(h) ] is the mean intensity of that reflectionc Rcryst or Rfree = Σ||Fo| – |Fc||/Σ|Fo|, where Fo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure factors, respectivelyd Root mean square deviations relate to the Engh and Huber parameters (21Four Collaborative Computing Project Number Acta Crystallogr.

All diffraction data were collected at 100 K on crystals that were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen upon harvesting. The CCP4 programs MOSFLM and SCALA (21Four Collaborative Computing Project Number Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) were used to process the data. Structures for both space groups could be solved with the CYP1A2 model initially obtained for the G1 construct as a probe in molecular replacement searches using Phaser (22McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar). Crystals in space group P212121 generally diffracted to 2.5 Aå resolution and have four copies of P450 1A2 in complex with ANF in the asymmetric unit. Statistical analysis on a data set of one of these crystals collected to a limiting resolution of 2.45 Aå is presented in Table 1. A high resolution data set to 1.95 Aå resolution, collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory beamline 11-1 on a single crystal belonging to space group I222, was used to build and refine the final model (PDB: 2HI4). The CYP1A2 model encompasses residues 34-513 of the native protein and includes the missing loop that could not be built in the initial model determined for the G1 construct. Nine residues at the N terminus and 6 residues at the C terminus of the truncated and His-tagged construct could not be traced in the electron density maps. During later stages of refinement, 160 water molecules were added, and the inhibitor ANF was modeled in the distal active site pocket above the heme prosthetic group, as evidenced by 2|Fo| - |Fc| σA-weighted electron density maps contoured at 1σ. Data collection and refinement statistics are provided in Table 1 together with statistics describing the stereochemical features of the protein model. Protein Design and Structure Determination—CYP1A2 was modified to remove the N-terminal transmembrane domain to improve solubility and to reduce aggregation as described previously for the crystallization of other microsomal P450s (6Yano J.K.

Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13196-13201Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Expression of CYP1A2 as a conditional membrane protein suitable for crystallization was achieved in two ways. In the G1 construct, a short hydrophilic sequence that has been successfully employed previously for the crystallization of other human P450 enzymes was substituted for the native N-terminal sequence upstream of the proline-rich motif at the beginning of the catalytic domain (18Wester M.R. Stout C.D. Johnson E.F. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 357: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The alternative D24 construct employed a truncation of the wild-type CYP1A2 sequence (GenBank™ P05177) for which residues 3-26, including the transmembrane signal anchor domain, were deleted. Both proteins crystallized under similar conditions but produced crystals that belonged to three different space groups. This appears to reflect shifts in the crystal packing to accommodate the longer N-terminal sequence of the D24 construct, resulting in denser intermolecular packing interactions, a lower crystal solvent content, and a better diffraction quality. Nevertheless, conformational differences in the catalytic domain were not evident for structures obtained from crystals belonging to space groups I222 or P212121 for the D24 construct and space group P1 for the G1 construct. Root mean square deviation values for the pairwise superimposition of Cα traces of the three respective models do not exceed 0.55 Aå. The final model was refined against data to a resolution of 1.95 Aå obtained for a single crystal in space group I222 and encompasses residues 34-513 of the native protein (PDB: 2HI4). Data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table 1. Human P450 1A2 Structure—The structure of P450 1A2 exhibits the 12 α-helices and 4 β-sheets designated A-L and 1-4, respectively, which are generally seen for the canonical P450 fold (Fig. 1). Several additional helices, some of which are also seen in other P450 structures, are present and indicated by prime or double prime designations. When compared with mammalian P450s of known structure, the most conserved regions are the core of the protein forming the heme binding site and the proximal surface that is thought to provide binding sites for the redox partners, NADPH cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase and cytochrome b5 (25Poulos T.L. Johnson E.F. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 2005; (Ortiz de Montellano, P. R., ed) Third Ed., pp. , Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York: 87-114Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The most divergent regions between known P450 structures are the portions that form the distal surfaces of the substrate binding cavity, the helix B-C and F-G regions and the C-terminal loop following helix L. Mammalian microsomal P450 enzymes generally have a large insertion between helices F and G, which exhibits a reverse amphipathicity that constitutes part of a hydrophobic surface on the tip of the protein close to the transmembrane domain. This hydrophobic surface forms part of the juxtamembrane surface of the catalytic domain of eukaryotic P450s (8Williams P.A. Cosme J. Sridhar V. Johnson E.F. McRee D.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 121-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 26Ozalp C. Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4629-4637Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Two short α-helices, F′ and G′, are generally observed in this region for other mammalian P450 structures. In the P450 1A2 structure, both helix F′ and G′ are 310 helical fragments rather than α-helices. Nevertheless, a reverse amphipathicity is maintained. This insertion and hydrophobic surface are not generally seen in soluble prokaryotic P450 structures. P450 1A2 shares less than 40% amino acid sequence identity with either P450 3A4 or structurally characterized family 2 P450s. Therefore, as would be expected based on the low sequence identities, the P450 1A2 structure differs from those of families 2 and 3 in the lengths and local structures of loop regions connecting conserved secondary structure elements. A structure-based sequence alignment of P450s 1A2, 2A6, and 3A4 is provided in supplemental Fig. S1. An additional β-sheet (β3′) is present between helices H and I, as well as an additional small α-helix (K″) residing at the proximal surface. Furthermore, the region connecting helices C and D shows a serine-rich insertion, which forms a loop that extends into the solvent. Another remarkable feature of the P450 1A2 structure is the disruption of helix F as it crosses the distal surface of the active site cavity (Fig. 2). P450 family 2 structures (6Yano J.K. Hsu M.H.

In the P450 1A2 structure, the α-helical hydrogen-bonding pattern is lost at Val-220 and Lys-221, causing one helical turn in the middle of helix F to unwind. Two water molecules fill the space thus created, giving rise to water-bridged contacts between Val-220 carbonyl oxygen and Thr-223 Oγ, and Lys-221 carbonyl oxygen and His-224 amide nitrogen, respectively. The bending of helix F brings the C-terminal portion of the helix in toward the core of the protein, closing down the active site cavity. Substrates bind in the cavity located above the distal surface of the heme prosthetic group. In the P450 1A2 structure of the ANF complex, the active site is closed without evident solvent or substrate access channels. The volume of the cavity was estimated to be 375 Aå3, which is larger than that of P450 2A6 (260 Aå3) (Fig. 2). The rather compact, closed active site cavity topologies of P450 1A2 and P450 2A6 contrast with the much more open active site architectures displayed by P450 3A4 (Fig. 2) and P450 2C8, with volumes of 1385 Aå3 and 1438 Aå3, respectively. Human P450 1A2 in Complex with α-Naphthoflavone—The protein was purified and crystallized in the presence of ANF. The structure and numbering of ANF are shown in Fig. 3. The presence of ANF in the active site cavity was well defined by 2|Fo| - |Fc| σA-weighted electron density maps calculated for a model that did not include ANF (Fig. 4). The orientation of the ANF molecule is clearly indicated by the curvature of the electron density map and further supported by electron density for the carbonyl group and the phenyl group, which were defined by the narrowing of the map at the bond connecting the phenyl ring to the benzo(h)chromen-4-one moiety. This indicates that ANF binds in a single preferred orientation, which places the phenyl ring close to the heme iron.FIGURE 4Detailed view of the binding of α-naphthoflavone in the human P450 1A2 active site.

https://openalex.org/W2026465800,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is produced inside the intestine and is known as a poison that inhibits cellular respiration at the level of cytochrome oxidase. However, sulfide is used as an energetic substrate by many photo- and chemoautotrophic bacteria and by animals such as the lugworm Arenicola marina. The concentrations of sulfide present in their habitats are comparable with those present in the human colon. Using permeabilized colonic cells to which sulfide was added by an infusion pump we show that the maximal respiratory rate of colonocyte mitochondria in presence of sulfide compares with that obtained with succinate or L-alpha-glycerophosphate. This oxidation is accompanied by mitochondrial energization. In contrast, other cell types not naturally exposed to high concentration of sulfide showed much lower oxidation rates. Mitochondria showed a very high affinity for sulfide that permits its use as an energetic substrate at low micromolar concentrations, hence, below the toxic level. However, if the supply of sulfide exceeds the oxidation rate, poisoning renders mitochondria inefficient and our data suggest that an anaerobic mechanism involving partial reversion of Krebs cycle already known in invertebrates takes place. In conclusion, this work provides additional and compelling evidence that sulfide is not only a toxic compound. According to our study, sulfide appears to be the first inorganic substrate for mammalian cells characterized thus far."
https://openalex.org/W2076461297,"Little is known about the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in feces and their potential health consequences. Patients and healthcare professionals have observed that feces often smell abnormal during gastrointestinal disease. The aim of this work was to define the volatiles emitted from the feces of healthy donors and patients with gastrointestinal disease. Our hypotheses were that i) VOCs would be shared in health; ii) VOCs would be constant in individuals; and iii) specific changes in VOCs would occur in disease. Volatile emissions in health were defined in a cohort and a longitudinal study. Subsequently, the pattern of volatiles found in the cohort study were compared to that found from patients with ulcerative colitis, Campylobacter jejuni, and Clostridium difficile. Volatiles from feces were collected by solid-phase microextraction and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. In the cohort study, 297 volatiles were identified. In all samples, ethanoic, butanoic, pentanoic acids, benzaldehyde, ethanal, carbon disulfide, dimethyldisulfide, acetone, 2-butanone, 2,3-butanedione, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, indole, and 4-methylphenol were found. Forty-four compounds were shared by 80% of subjects. In the longitudinal study, 292 volatiles were identified, with some inter and intra subject variations in VOC concentrations with time. When compared to healthy donors, volatile patterns from feces of patients with ulcerative colitis, C. difficile, and C. jejuni were each significantly different. These findings could lead the way to the development of a rapid diagnostic device based on VOC detection."
https://openalex.org/W2133865221,"TonB-dependent receptors (TBDRs) are outer membrane proteins mainly known for the active transport of iron siderophore complexes in Gram-negative bacteria. Analysis of the genome of the phytopathogenic bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc), predicts 72 TBDRs. Such an overrepresentation is common in Xanthomonas species but is limited to only a small number of bacteria. Here, we show that one Xcc TBDR transports sucrose with a very high affinity, suggesting that it might be a sucrose scavenger. This TBDR acts with an inner membrane transporter, an amylosucrase and a regulator to utilize sucrose, thus defining a new type of carbohydrate utilization locus, named CUT locus, involving a TBDR for the transport of substrate across the outer membrane. This sucrose CUT locus is required for full pathogenicity on Arabidopsis, showing its importance for the adaptation to host plants. A systematic analysis of Xcc TBDR genes and a genome context survey suggested that several Xcc TBDRs belong to other CUT loci involved in the utilization of various plant carbohydrates. Interestingly, several Xcc TBDRs and CUT loci are conserved in aquatic bacteria such as Caulobacter crescentus, Colwellia psychrerythraea, Saccharophagus degradans, Shewanella spp., Sphingomonas spp. or Pseudoalteromonas spp., which share the ability to degrade a wide variety of complex carbohydrates and display TBDR overrepresentation. We therefore propose that TBDR overrepresentation and the presence of CUT loci designate the ability to scavenge carbohydrates. Thus CUT loci, which seem to participate to the adaptation of phytopathogenic bacteria to their host plants, might also play a very important role in the biogeochemical cycling of plant-derived nutrients in marine environments. Moreover, the TBDRs and CUT loci identified in this study are clearly different from those characterized in the human gut symbiont Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, which allow glycan foraging, suggesting a convergent evolution of TBDRs in Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes."
https://openalex.org/W2010122020,"Glycosylation plays a major role in the remarkable chemical diversity of flavonoids in plants including <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. The wide diversity encoded by the large family-1 glycosyltransferase (UGT) gene family makes it difficult to determine the biochemical function of each gene solely from its primary sequence. Here we used transcriptome coexpression analysis combined with a reverse genetics approach to identify a gene that is prominent in determining the flavonoid composition of <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Using transcriptome coexpression analysis accessible on the ATTED-II public data base, the expression pattern of a UGT gene, <i>UGT89C1</i>, was found to be highly correlated with known flavonoid biosynthetic genes. No C-7 rhamnosylated flavonols were detected in either of two T-DNA <i>ugt89c1</i> mutants. This specific metabolite deficiency in the mutants was complemented by stable transformation with the genomic fragment containing intact <i>UGT89C1</i>. Glutathione <i>S</i>-transferasefused recombinant UGT89C1 protein converted kaempferol 3-<i>O</i>-glucoside to kaempferol 3-<i>O</i>-glucoside-7-<i>O</i>-rhamnoside and recognized 3-<i>O</i>-glycosylated flavonols and UDP-rhamnose as substrates, but not flavonol aglycones, 3-<i>O</i>-glycosylated anthocyanins or other UDP-sugars. These results show that UGT89C1 is a flavonol 7-<i>O</i>-rhamnosyltransferase. The abundance of <i>UGT89C1</i> transcripts in floral buds was consistent with the flavonoid accumulation of C-7 rhamnosylated flavonols in <i>Arabidopsis</i> organs. Our present study demonstrates that the integration of transcriptome coexpression analysis with a reverse genetic approach is a versatile tool for understanding a multigene family of a metabolic pathway in <i>Arabidopsis</i>."
https://openalex.org/W2078712181,"Selenium is a micronutrient that is essential for the production of normal spermatozoa. The selenium-rich plasma protein selenoprotein P (Sepp1) is required for maintenance of testis selenium and for fertility of the male mouse. Sepp1 trafficking in the seminiferous epithelium was studied using conventional methods and mice with gene deletions. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated that Sepp1 is present in vesicle-like structures in the basal region of Sertoli cells, suggesting that the protein is taken up intact. Sepp1 affinity chromatography of a testicular extract followed by mass spectrometry-based identification of bound proteins identified apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2) as a candidate testis Sepp1 receptor. In situ hybridization analysis identified Sertoli cells as the only cell type in the seminiferous epithelium with detectable ApoER2 expression. Testis selenium levels in apoER2-/- males were sharply reduced from those in apoER2+/+ males and were comparable with the depressed levels found in Sepp1-/- males. However, liver selenium levels were unchanged by deletion of apoER2. Immunocytochemistry did not detect Sepp1 in the Sertoli cells of apoER2-/- males, consistent with a defect in the receptor-mediated Sepp1 uptake pathway. Phase contrast microscopy revealed identical sperm defects in apoER2-/- and Sepp1-/- mice. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated an interaction of testis ApoER2 with Sepp1.

Selenium exerts its biological roles as selenocysteine, which is incorporated into the primary structure of selenoproteins. The selenoenzymes typically contain a single selenocysteine residue that functions at the active site. In human beings, 25 genes that encode selenoproteins have been identified (4Kryukov G.V.

They include the glutathione peroxidases, the thioredoxin reductases, and the iodothyronine deiodinases.Sepp1 (selenoprotein P) is a unique member of the mouse and human selenoprotein families, because it contains 10 selenocysteine residues (5Burk R.F.

It is an extracellular glycoprotein proposed to function both in oxidant defense and as a selenium transport protein. Most Sepp1 is produced and secreted by the liver, although other tissues produce it as well. Sepp1 is associated with isolated cell membranes (7Wilson D.S. Tappel A.L. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1993; 51: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), but specific receptors for its uptake have not been identified.Selenium deficiency results in the production of abnormal spermatozoa. Feeding a selenium-adequate diet reverses this effect. We recently demonstrated that Sepp1-/- male mice have dramatically reduced testis selenium levels, produce abnormal spermatozoa that appear identical to those of selenium-deficient wild type mice, and are infertile (8Olson G.E.

Unlike selenium-deficient wild type animals, the sperm defects, testis selenium levels, and infertility of Sepp1-/- males are not reversed by dietary selenium supplementation. These findings demonstrate a requirement for Sepp1 in male fertility.The present study was undertaken to define the uptake mechanism and trafficking pathway by which Sepp1 delivers its selenium to developing germ cells. We demonstrate that a member of the lipoprotein receptor family (10Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. CMLS Cell. Mol.

The Vanderbilt Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal protocols. Rats and mice were housed in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC)-approved facility on a 14 h:10 h light:dark cycle with food and water provided ad libitum; diets were either standard laboratory chow or a Torula yeast diet supplemented with 0.25 parts/million selenium as sodium selenite (11Burk R.F. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Sepp1-/- mice were produced and genotyped by PCR as described previously (9Hill K.E. Zhou J. McMahan W.J. Motley A.K.

The primers for identifying the Sepp1 genotypes included primer 1 (5′-GCCATCAGGGCTCAGTGCAG-3′), primer 2 (5-GGTGTTGGGTCGTTTGTTCGGATCG-3′), and primer 3 (5′-GGATGCCTGCAGAAGACACAAGTA-3′). Homozygous wild type (Sepp1+/+) mice yielded a 600-bp PCR product with primers 1 and 2, whereas Sepp1-/- mice yielded a 500-bp PCR product using primers 1 and 3. ApoER2 null mice (strain name B6:129S6-Lrp8tm1Her/J, The Jackson Laboratory) were provided by Dr. Edwin Weeber, Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Vanderbilt University, and were genotyped by PCR. The PCR primer pair to identify homozygous (apoER2-/-) mice was 5′-GATTGGGAAGACAATAGCAGGCATGC-3′ and 5′-GCTTGTTGGAATTCAGCCAGTTACC-3′ and yielded a 420-bp PCR product; the primers to identify wild type mice were 5′-CCACAGTGTCACACAGGTAATGTG-3′ and 5′-ACGATGACCCCAATGACAGCAGCG-3′, which yielded a 520-bp product. Mice were sacrificed using CO2, and their organs were removed and immediately utilized in the following protocols.Materials—Mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against rat Sepp1 have been previously described (12Read R.

Naruse, Kaketsuken, The Chemo-Sero-Therapeutic Research Institute, Kumamoto, Japan. IgG was purified from hybridoma culture medium using protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). Affinity-purified rabbit anti-peptide antibodies to mouse ApoER2 were produced commercially (Rockland Immunochemicals Inc.). Two peptides, CEVRRIDLVKRDYSR and CPDGSDESKAT, representing motifs in the extracellular domain of mouse ApoER2 were conjugated to hemocyanin for immunization. Immune serum was affinity-purified on peptide-agarose affinity columns.Affinity Purification and Proteomic Identification of Testicular Sepp1-binding Proteins—Sepp1 was purified from rat plasma using a monoclonal antibody affinity column (14Himeno S. Chittum H.S. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15769-15775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and then coupled to AminoLink Plus resin at pH 10.0 (Pierce). The Sepp1-AminoLink resin was stored in a column buffer of TNI (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 0.05% sodium azide) containing 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.2% Triton X-100. A membrane preparation was prepared from the testes of adult Sprague-Dawley rats. The testes were suspended in ice-cold TNI and homogenized with a Brinkman polytron set at medium power for five 5-s bursts. The suspension was centrifuged at 40,000 revolutions/min for 30 min in a Beckman TLA100.3 rotor, the cytosol was discarded, and the pellet was washed by resuspension in TNI followed by centrifugation at 40,000 revolutions/min for 30 min in a Beckman TLA100.3 rotor. Membrane proteins were solubilized at 4 °C in TNI containing 0.2% Triton X-100, and insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 40,000 revolutions/min for 30 min in a Beckman TLA100.3 rotor. The Triton-soluble fraction was adjusted to 1 mm each CaCl2 and MgCl2 and then incubated with the Sepp1-AminoLink resin. The column was washed with 10 volumes of column buffer, and bound proteins were sequentially eluted with 1 m NaCl, 1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, followed by 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.5. The acid-eluted fraction was neutralized with 1 m Tris base, dialyzed against water, and lyophilized to powder. Polypeptides in the acid-eluted fraction were trypsin-digested and identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry by the Vanderbilt Proteomics Laboratory in the Mass Spectrometry Research Center using the Sequest algorithm and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Blast programs.SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Protein samples were diluted in SDS sample buffer containing 50 mm dithiothreitol and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. SDS-PAGE was performed on 10% BisTris NuPAGE Novex acrylamide gels (Invitrogen). Polypeptides were visualized with Coomassie Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blot analyses. Blots were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) and blocked in Odyssey blocking buffer (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Blots were then incubated in primary antibody diluted 1:2,500-1:5,000 in Odyssey blocking buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20; parallel control blots substituted equivalent levels of the appropriate non-immune IgG. Blots were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4, 0.025% sodium azide) containing 0.1% Tween (PBST) and then incubated in secondary antibody of Alexa 680-conjugated goat anti-rat or goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) diluted 1:5,000 in PBST. Blots were washed in PBST and imaged using an Odyssey infrared imager.Cloning of Mouse Testis ApoER2—Total RNA was isolated from mouse testes using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and a fulllength ApoER2 cDNA was amplified with a one-step reverse transcription (RT)-PCR System (Invitrogen) using primers corresponding to the N terminus (P1 = 5′-ATGGGCCGCCCAGAACTGGGCGCG) and C terminus (P2 = 5′-GGGCAGTCCATCATCTTCAAGACTTAATGCCAC-3′) of mouse ApoER2 (15Brandes C.

PCR products were separated on 1.2% agarose gels (E-gels, Invitrogen), and DNA was extracted from excised bands using a Qiaex II gel extraction kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Nested PCR analysis of the RT-PCR product was performed using primer pairs representing the predicted N terminus of mature ApoER2 (P3 = 5′-GGGCCAGTCAAGGAGTGTGAAGAG-3′) and a sequence in the epidermal growth factor homology domain (P4 = 5′-GTAGTCCCGCTTCACCAGGTCTAT-3′). To sequence testis ApoER2, the full-length RT-PCR product was cloned into pCR4-TOPO plasmid (Invitrogen), and the cDNA of three clones was sequenced in both directions (Gene Pass, Nashville, TN).Bacterial expression of the extracellular domain of testis ApoER2 was performed using the pBAD102/DTOPO plasmid (Invitrogen). The PCR product obtained with the nested PCR reaction described above was ligated into the plasmid, and protein expression was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The His6-tagged fusion protein was purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Invitrogen), and its purity was evaluated by SDS-PAGE.Immunocytochemistry—Mouse and rat testes were fixed 1 h at 4 °C with 4% formaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. The tissue was then rinsed in phosphate buffer and infiltrated overnight at 4 °C in phosphate buffer containing 20% sucrose. Tissues were then placed in OCT (optimal temperature cutting compound, Fisher Scientific, Atlanta GA), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70 °C. Cryosections were rinsed with TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm sodium chloride, 0.025% sodium azide) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) and blocked with TBST containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% glycine. Sections were then incubated in monoclonal rat anti-mouse Sepp1 or mouse anti-rat Sepp1 diluted in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. Control slides were incubated with equivalent levels of non-immune rat or mouse IgG. Sections were washed three times for 5 min in TBST and then incubated for 1 h in affinity-purified Cy3- or Cy5-conjugated secondary antibodies to rat or mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Slides were washed three times for 5 min in TBST and mounted in 50% glycerol in TBS. Specimens were examined using phase contrast, differential interference contrast, and fluorescence microscopy; fluorescence images comparing experimental and control specimens used identical exposures. At least three animals were used for each experiment and representative figures are shown.Immunostaining was also performed on enzyme-dissociated testicular cells. Testes were minced in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Sigma) and then gently agitated at 32 °C for 30 min in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1.0 mg/ml collagenase, 0.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 25 μg/ml DNase (Sigma). The cells were rinsed three times in Hanks' balanced salt solution and immunostained as described above.Co-immunoprecipitation Analyses—A Triton X-100 lysate of mouse testis membranes prepared as described above was incubated with rat anti-mouse Sepp1 conjugated to AminoLink beads for 1 h. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 1 min, and the pellet was washed three times in TBST. The final pellet was incubated in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, heated to 75 °C for 5 min, and centrifuged. The supernatant fraction was used for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis as described above.In Situ Hybridization—Non-isotopic in situ hybridization was performed (16Olson G.E. Winfrey V.P. NagDas S.K. Melner M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51266-51274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) using digoxigenin-labeled sense and anti-sense ApoER2 riboprobes and formaldehyde-fixed cryosections of mouse testis. Digoxigenin (Dig) 3The abbreviations used are: Dig, digoxigenin; RT, reverse transcription.-labeled nucleotides and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-Dig antibody were obtained from Roche Diagnostics. Hybridizations were performed overnight at 58 °C using identical concentrations of sense or antisense probes.Analysis of Sperm Phenotypes—The caput and cauda regions of the epididymis were minced in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. Released spermatozoa were examined by phase contrast microscopy either prior to or following fixation with 4% formaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4.Measurement of Tissue Selenium Levels—Selenium was measured using a modification of the fluorometric assay of Koh and Benson (17Koh T.S. Benson T.H. J. Assoc. Off. Anal. Chem. 1983; 66: 918-926PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sheehan T.M. Gao M. Clin. Chem. 1990; 36: 2124-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Tissue and blood plasma were digested in a mixture of perchloric and nitric acids and then reduced with hydrochloric acid followed by derivatization with 2,3-diaminonaphthalene. Fluorescence was measured using an excitation wavelength of 375 nm and an emission wavelength of 525 nm and compared with a sodium selenite standard curve. The detection limit of this assay is 1 ng of selenium.RESULTSLocalization of Sepp1 in Rat and Mouse Testes—We previously demonstrated that Sepp1, the major form of selenium in plasma, is required to maintain testis selenium, normal sperm development, and male fertility (8Olson G.E. Winfrey V.P. Nagdas S.K. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Biol. Reprod. 2005; 73: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 9Hill K.E. Zhou J. McMahan W.J. Motley A.K. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13640-13646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). However, it is not known how the selenium content of Sepp1 is delivered to spermatogenic cells. To identify cell types of the seminiferous epithelium involved in Sepp1 uptake and trafficking, cryosections of rat and mouse testes were immunostained with monoclonal antibodies to rat or to mouse Sepp1. In both species, Sepp1 localized to punctate foci at the basal aspect of the seminiferous epithelium within Sertoli cells (Fig. 1, A and C). Neither peritubular cells nor spermatogenic cells displayed detectable immunostaining with anti-Sepp1. Control specimens, prepared by substituting equivalent levels of non-immune IgG for anti-Sepp1, displayed no detectable immunostaining (Fig. 1B). As an additional control, testes of Sepp1-/- mice were immunostained with anti-Sepp1, and no fluorescence was detected (Fig. 1D). Because these animals lack Sepp1, this result demonstrates a lack of antibody cross-reactivity with other tissue proteins. Suspensions of collagenase-dissociated testis cells were also immunostained with anti-Sepp1. Sepp1 localized both to the basal surface of Sertoli cells and to vesicle-like elements within their basal cytoplasm, but no Sepp1 staining was detected in spermatogenic cells (Fig. 2). These data indicate that Sertoli cells function in Sepp1 uptake from the interstitial fluid and suggest that they might utilize a receptor-mediated pathway for Sepp1 uptake.FIGURE 2Merged fluorescence and phase contrast images of collagenase-dissociated mouse testicular cells immunostained with rat anti-mouse Sepp1. In A, a single Sertoli cell and a cluster of late spermatids associated with its apical surface are shown, whereas B shows three Sertoli cells and associated spermatogenic cells. Nuclear staining, in blue, is also shown in A. Sepp1 immunoreactivity localizes to punctate elements (arrows) concentrated in the basal aspect of the polarized Sertoli cells (SC). No Sepp1 staining is detected within spermatogenic cells (arrowheads) or late spermatids (Sp).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Identification of Testicular Sepp1-binding Proteins—To identify candidate membrane receptors for Sepp1, a Triton X-100 lysate of rat testis membranes was prepared and fractionated on a rat Sepp1 affinity column.

Mouse testis mRNA was amplified by RT-PCR using a primer pair representing the N and C termini of the mouse ApoER2 mRNA coding sequence (15Brandes C. Kahr L. Stockinger W. Hiesberger T.

A ∼2.3-kb cDNA product was observed (Fig. 3A), suggesting it represented a different splice variant(s) than the ∼2.6-kb ApoER2 cDNA from mouse brain. Nested PCR analysis was then performed using internal primers located in the extracellular domain to compare the testis ApoER2 cDNA to a mouse brain ApoER2 cDNA encoding five ligand-binding repeats, including numbers 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8 (Fig. 3B). PCR of the testis ApoER2 cDNA yielded a single amplicon of ∼830 bp (Fig. 3B, lane 1), whereas the brain cDNA yielded a larger single band of the predicted size of 941 bp (Fig. 3B, lane 2). Electrophoretic comparison of the full-length testis and brain cDNAs revealed that the testis cDNA was ∼300-bp shorter than the brain cDNA (Fig. 3C). These data suggested that the testis and brain cDNAs differed in the structure of both their extracellular and cytoplasmic domains and represented distinct ApoER2 splice variants. To identify the testis ApoER2 isoform, the 2.3-kb RT-PCR product was subcloned into a pCR plasmid, and three clones were fully sequenced. All testis ApoER2 clones lacked ligand-binding repeat 8 in the extracellular domain as well as a 59-amino-acid insert in the cytoplasmic domain that is encoded by exon 19 (Fig. 3D). In addition, two of three testis clones possessed a 13-amino-acid insertion in the extracellular domain immediately following ligand-binding repeat 7, which contains a furin cleavage site (Fig. 3D). The two testis ApoER2 variants, with and without the furin cleavage site, encoded full-length polypeptides of 782 amino acids (86,383 Da) and 769 amino acids (84,998 Da).FIGURE 3A, RT-PCR amplification of mouse testis RNA with primers (P1, P2), representing the N and C termini of mouse brain ApoER2 (see panel D), yielded an amplicon of ∼2.3 kb.

Control specimens hybridized with sense ApoER2 Dig riboprobes displayed no detectable signal (Fig. 4B). This result supports the idea that Sertoli cell ApoER2 expression is linked to Sepp1 uptake.FIGURE 4Nonisotopic in situ hybridization using antisense (A) and sense (B) Dig-ApoER2 riboprobes on mouse testis cryosections.

To test for in vivo binding between Sepp1 and ApoER2, monoclonal anti-mouse Sepp1 conjugated to Affi-gel plus beads was utilized for immunoprecipitation of mouse testis membrane lysates. Immunoprecipitation pellets were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 5B). Staining with anti-Sepp1 revealed a single band of Mr ∼ 50,000 in the IP pellets that co-migrated with purified mouse Sepp1 (Fig. 5B, lane 1). Companion blot lanes stained with a rabbit anti-peptide antibody to mouse ApoER2 displayed a major immunoreactive band of Mr ∼ 85,000, the predicted size of the processed testicular ApoER2 isoform (Fig. 5B, lane 2). In addition, two faint but specifically stained bands of higher molecular mass were also detected. They may represent incompletely processed ApoER2 precursor(s) or other ApoER2 isoforms expressed at low levels in the testis. Companion control lanes stained using non-immune IgG displayed no positive bands (Fig. 5B, lane 3). These data demonstrate that Sepp1 and ApoER2 form a complex in vivo.FIGURE 5A, lane 1, Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE showing a purified bacterial fusion protein representing the extracellular domain of testis ApoER2.

To understand how eIF4E affects cell proliferation and survival, we studied mRNA targets that are translationally responsive to eIF4E.Microarray analysis of polysomal mRNA from an eIF4E-inducible NIH 3T3 cell line was performed. Inducible expression of eIF4E resulted in increased translation of defined sets of mRNAs. Many of the mRNAs are novel targets, including those that encode large- and small-subunit ribosomal proteins and cell growth-related factors. In addition, there was augmented translation of mRNAs encoding anti-apoptotic proteins, which conferred resistance to endoplasmic reticulum-mediated apoptosis.Our results shed new light on the mechanisms by which eIF4E prevents apoptosis and transforms cells. Downregulation of eIF4E and its downstream targets is a potential therapeutic option for the development of novel anti-cancer drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2153445234,"TWEAK cytokine has been implicated in several biological responses including inflammation, angiogenesis, and osteoclastogenesis. We have investigated the role of TWEAK in regulating skeletal muscle mass. Addition of soluble TWEAK protein to cultured myotubes reduced the mean myotube diameter and enhanced the degradation of specific muscle proteins such as CK and MyHCf. The effect of TWEAK on degradation of MyHCf was stronger than its structural homologue, TNF-alpha. TWEAK increased the ubiquitination of MyHCf and the transcript levels of atrogin-1 and MuRF1 ubiquitin ligases. TWEAK inhibited phosphorylation of Akt kinase and its downstream targets GSK-3beta, FOXO1, mTOR, and p70S6K. Furthermore, TWEAK increased the activation of NF-kappaB transcription factor in myotubes. Adenoviral-mediated overexpression of IkappaB alpha deltaN (a degradation-resistant mutant of NF-kappaB inhibitory protein IkappaB alpha) in myotubes blocked the TWEAK-induced degradation of MyHCf. Chronic administration of TWEAK in mice resulted in reduced body and skeletal muscle weight with an associated increase in the activity of ubiquitin-proteasome system and NF-kappaB. Finally, muscle-specific transgenic overexpression of TWEAK decreased the body and skeletal muscle weight in mice. Collectively, our data suggest that TWEAK induces skeletal muscle atrophy through inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome and NF-kappaB systems."
https://openalex.org/W2147262033,"N1-acetyl-N2-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AMFK) is a major metabolite of melatonin in mammals. To investigate whether AFMK exists in plants, an aquatic plant, water hyacinth, was used. To achieve this, LC/MS/MS with a deuterated standard was employed. AFMK was identified in any plant for the first time. Both it and its precursor, melatonin, were rhythmic with peaks during the late light phase. These novel rhythms indicate that these molecules do not serve as the chemical signal of darkness as in animals but may relate to processes of photosynthesis or photoprotection. These possibilities are supported by higher production of melatonin and AFMK in plants grown in sunlight (10,000-15,000 microW/cm2) compared to those grown under artificial light (400-450 microW/cm2). Melatonin and AFMK, as potent free radical scavengers, may assist plants in coping with harsh environmental insults, including soil and water pollutants. High levels of melatonin and AFMK in water hyacinth may explain why this plant more easily tolerates environmental pollutants, including toxic chemicals and heavy metals and is successfully used in phytoremediation. These novel findings could lead to improvements in the phytoremediative capacity of plants by either stimulating endogenous melatonin synthesis or by adding melatonin to water/soil in which they are grown."
https://openalex.org/W2069145276,"Excessive release of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) during loading and/or injury of the cartilage matrix may contribute to the onset or progression of osteoarthritis. This pathological role may be related to the ability of bFGF to decrease proteoglycan synthesis and to antagonize the activity of anabolic growth factors in cartilage such as insulin-like growth factor-1 and bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7 or OP-1). Matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), a catabolic cartilage-degrading enzyme, is dramatically up-regulated by inflammatory cytokines or by fibronectin fragments in articular chondrocytes. In this study, we investigated MMP-13 production by bFGF using human articular chondrocytes. Endogenous concentration of bFGF in synovial fluids collected from arthritis patients and asymptomatic subjects showed a good linear correlation with the endogenous levels of MMP-13. bFGF stimulation of MMP-13 was mediated at the transcriptional level and, at least in part, by stimulation of interleukin-1 production. Also, our findings suggest that bFGF stimulation of MMP-13 required the activation of multiple MAPKs (ERK, p38, and JNK) by bFGF, and more importantly, bFGF activation of protein kinase C (PKC) δ played a key role in the MMP-13 stimulation. Indeed, PKCδ is the only isoform associated with MMP-13 stimulation among the PKC isoforms tested. PKCδ controls the bFGF response by regulating multiple MAPK pathways. Our results suggest that PKCδ activation is a principal rate-limiting event in the bFGF-dependent stimulation of MMP-13 in human adult articular chondrocytes.

Under normal conditions, chondrocytes maintain a dynamic equilibrium between synthesis and degradation of ECM components. Although the causative events in the etiology of OA remain to be clearly defined, OA is characterized by a disruption of matrix equilibrium leading to progressive loss of cartilage tissue and clonal expansion of cells in the depleted regions. In the early stages of OA, cells respond with a transient induction of matrix synthesis (e.g. increases in the expression and/or protein secretion of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7 or OP-1)). This de novo ECM synthesis cannot overcome the concurrent catabolic processes (1Middleton J.F. Tyler J.A. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1992; 51: 440-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 2Keyszer G.M.

The resulting degradation of cartilage ECM may exacerbate the imbalance by enhancing the local activity of systemic regulatory factors, including growth factors and cytokines. Matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13 or collagenase-3) is the most potent enzyme that degrades type II collagen (the principal component of articular cartilage) and is normally expressed during cartilage development and ECM remodeling. MMP-13 is highly expressed in several pathological contexts, including OA (3Salminen H.J. Saamanen A.M. Vankemmelbeke M.N. Auho P.K. Perala M.P. Vuorio E.I. Ann. Rheum.

In rabbit or rodent injury models of OA, MMP-13 expression was stimulated by injury and correlated with cartilage degradation (6van den Berg W.B. Curr. Opin.

Biorheology. 2002; 39: 247-258PubMed Google Scholar). Clinical studies in human patients have shown that MMP-13 is not expressed in normal adult cartilage but is highly expressed in OA at sites of cartilage degradation (8Mitchell P.G. Magna H.A. Reeves L.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 97: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Recently, transgenic mouse studies demonstrated that cartilage-targeted overexpression of activated MMP-13 alone is sufficient to cause the cartilage degradation characteristic of OA (9Neuhold L.A. Killar L. Zhao W. Sung M.L. Warner L. Kulik J. Turner J. Wu W. Billinghurst C. Meijers T. Poole A.R. Babij P. De-Gennaro L.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). However, despite evidence supporting a central role of MMP-13 in OA pathogenesis, the factors regulating MMP-13 production and the critical process governing stimulation of chondrocyte MMP-13 remain to be explored. The important mitogenic roles of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF or FGF-2) in regulating cell proliferation in the growth plate and articular cartilage are well established. In contrast, bFGF appears to play a complex role in the synthesis and degradation of the ECM in adult articular cartilage. Evidence suggests that bFGF is pathologically associated with joint destruction (10Qu Z. Huang X.N. Ahmadi P. Andresevic J. Planck S.R. Hart C.E. Rosenbaum J.T. Lab. Investig. 1995; 73: 339-346PubMed Google Scholar, 11Tchetina E.V. Squires G. Poole A.R. J. Rheumatol. 2005; 32: 876-886PubMed Google Scholar) and stimulation of MMP-13 (12Wang X. Manner P.A. Horner A. Shum L. Tuan R.S. Nuckolls G.H. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2004; 12: 963-973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Chondrocyte proliferation resulting in cluster formation is a histological hallmark of OA cartilage. The mechanism that initiates cluster formation in OA cartilage is unknown, but it may be a consequence of cellular alterations that reduce the ability of cartilage to effectively establish normal repair tissue. Previous results from our laboratories (13Loeser F.R. Chubinskaya S. Pacione C. Im H.-J. Arthritis Rheum. 2005; 52: 3910-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and others (14Quintavalla J. Kumar C. Daouti S. Slosberg E. Uziel-Fusi S. J. Cell. Physiol. 2005; 204: 560-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), using a three-dimensional cell culture system, suggest that bFGF plays a role in the formation of cell clusters similar to those seen in OA cartilage. Basic FGF also significantly reduces proteoglycan synthesis and antagonizes the biological effects mediated by cartilage anabolic growth factors such as BMP7 and IGF-1 (13Loeser F.R. Chubinskaya S. Pacione C. Im H.-J. Arthritis Rheum. 2005; 52: 3910-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Antagonistic effects of bFGF on the cellular response to BMP/TGFβ in articular chondrocytes (15Sonal D. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and osteoblasts (16Nakayama K. Tamura Y. Suzawa M. Harada S.I. Fukumoto S. Kato M. Miyazono K. Rodan G.A. Takeuchi Y. Fujita T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 827Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) have been attributed to the interruption of the Smad-mediated signaling. Multiple factors operate in concert to control the overall metabolism of cartilage in vivo. Basic FGF is one of these factors. Joint damage by various causes such as obesity, mechanical joint injury, or simply aging may change the structure of cartilage (17Lohmander L.S. Felson D. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2004; 12: S49-S52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These structural changes alter the articular cartilage homeostasis (18Iannone F. Lapadula G. Aging Clin. Exp. Res. 2003; 15: 364-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and may modulate chondrocyte-mediated gene expression, including growth factors and cytokines that may have impact on chondrocyte metabolism. Upon joint damage, continued use is likely to accelerate the pathological process, thus emphasizing the importance of prevention and early management of joint trauma. One of the factors that immediately responds to cartilage injury is bFGF (19Vincent T. Hermansson M. Bolton M. Wait R. Saklatvala J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8259-8264Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Basic FGF is produced by chondrocytes (20Shida J.I. Jingushi S. Izumi T. Ikenoue T. Iwamoto Y. J. Orthop. Res. 2001; 19: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), stored in the ECM, and released from the cartilage matrix upon cartilage injury (19Vincent T. Hermansson M. Bolton M. Wait R. Saklatvala J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8259-8264Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 21Vincent T.L. Hermansson M.A. Hansen U.N. Amis A.A. Saklatvala J. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Thus, bFGF has a potential pathophysiological role in the development of arthritis where it may serve as link between altered cell signaling and mechanical damage to cartilage. Basic FGF activates multiple signal transduction pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), in various cell types. The MAPKs activate transcription factors by phosphorylation, which in turn regulates the expression of a broad spectrum of genes that modify cellular functions. Recent evidence suggests that mechanical injury of cartilage is associated with the release of bFGF from ECM (19Vincent T. Hermansson M. Bolton M. Wait R. Saklatvala J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8259-8264Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The released bFGF is thought to mediate an immediate response in articular cartilage by stimulating and sustaining ERK activation. Basic FGF-activated ERK1/2 results in the translocation of phosphorylated ERK1/2 into the nucleus followed by binding of Elk-1 to its response element in a number of target genes such as c-fos, which represents a critical transcriptional suppressor of ECM components in rat lung fibroblasts (22Carreras I.

In this study, we addressed the molecular mechanisms and the signaling events that control MMP-13 production in response to bFGF signaling associated with human adult articular cartilage homeostasis.

Chondrocytes were isolated by enzymatic digestion of ankle articular cartilage (grade 0 or 1, which has no sign of cartilage degeneration) using Pronase followed by overnight digestion with collagenase-P as described previously (13Loeser F.R.

Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (complete media) for 5 days before the experiments. Chondrocyte Stimulation and Immunoblotting—Cells were serum-starved by changing media to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 with antibiotics for 1 day. For inhibitor studies, cells were preincubated with individual pathway-specific chemical inhibitors for 30 min before stimulation with bFGF or IL-1β.

Cell lysates were prepared using modified cell lysis RIPA buffer: 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% deoxycholate, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm glycerol phosphate, 1 mm NaVO4, with 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). Total protein concentrations of both media and cell lysates were determined by a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Pierce). An equal amount of protein was resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and was transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblot analysis as described previously (25Im H.-J. Pacione C.

Immunoreactivity was visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) and the Signal Visual Enhancer system (Pierce), which magnifies the signal. Reagents and Plasmids Constructs—Total and phospho-specific PKC isoforms antibodies, except anti-phospho-PKCϵ (Upstate), were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories and Cell Signaling, respectively. Phospho-specific PKCϵ antibody was purchased from Upstate and Calbiochem. Total and phospho-specific PYK2 (Thr-402) and phospho-FAK were purchased from Upstate and Chemicon. Anti-MMP-13 and β-actin antibodies were purchased from R&D Systems and Abcam, respectively. Optimal doses were obtained for the chemical and peptide inhibitors used in our studies to ensure specific effects on signaling pathways operative in human adult articular chondrocytes. These inhibitors include bisindolylmaleimide I (BIM) (10 μm), rottlerin (PKCδ-specific inhibitor, 4 μm), and GÖ6976 (selective inhibitor of Ca2+-dependent PKC isozymes such as PKCα/β, 5 nm), PKC-ϵ translocation inhibitor peptide and a scrambled peptide (negative control) for PKC signaling studies. To study Raf-MAPK signaling cascades, we used the following agents: Raf1 kinase peptide inhibitor (20 μm) as an inhibitor of Raf, PD098059 (20 μm), which blocks activation of MEK1/2, SB203580 (10 μm) for p38, and SP600125 (20 μm) for JNK. All chemicals were purchased from Calbiochem. Basic FGF and IL-1β were kindly provided by the NCI, National Institutes of Health, and Amgen, respectively.

Adenovirus encoding GFP was infected in parallel as a control at a multiplicity of infection of 200. Four hours after the transduction, the cells were fed with complete media and incubated for 6 h at 37 °C in a humidified environment containing 5% CO2. The cells were then treated with bFGF at the concentration of 100 ng/ml in serum-free media followed by further incubation for 24 h. Synovial Fluids—Normal synovial fluid was aspirated within 24 h of death from the knee joints of human organ donors (courtesy of the Gift of Hope Organ and Tissue Donor Network, Elmhurst, IL). Synovial fluid samples from organ donors with no documented history of joint diseases were used as controls for this study. With the approval of the Institutional Review Board for Human Investigations, synovial fluid was also collected from consenting OA and RA patients who were undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic arthrocentesis as part of their evaluation and therapy at the Section of Rheumatology, Rush University Medical Center. The patient cohort covered a broad spectrum of ages and disease severities for both OA and RA. OA was defined according to the classification criteria disseminated by the American College of Rheumatology (29Altman R. Asch E. Bloch D. Bole G. Borenstein D. Brandt K. Christy W. Cooke T.D. Greenwald R. Hochberg M. Arthritis Rheum. 1986; 29: 1039-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (5363) Google Scholar). Samples were centrifuged to remove cells and cell debris, divided into aliquots, and immediately stored at –80 °C until the assay was performed. Measurement of Endogenous bFGF and MMP-13 Concentrations—We used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with a sensitivity of <7 and 250 pg/ml for measuring endogenous concentrations of bFGF (BIOSOURCE International) and MMP-13 (R&D System), respectively, in synovial fluid samples according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, standard curves were generated in duplicate parallel to the preparation of mixtures containing 1 volume of standard diluent buffer (50 μl) and 1 volume of each sample of synovial fluid (50 μl). Multiple sample plates were then covered and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Samples and standards were decanted, and the wells were washed four times with 400 μl of wash buffer. Biotinylated anti-bFGF or anti-MMP-13 (Biotin Conjugate) solution (100 μl) was pipetted into each well and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After washing the wells again four times, 100 μl of streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase working solution was added to each well and incubated for 30 min at room temperature followed by the addition of stop solution. The absorbance of each well was read at 450 nm. A chromogen blank composed of 100 μl each of Stabilized Chromogen and Stop Solution was used to establish a zero base line for the plate reader. The bFGF or MMP-13 concentrations for samples were calculated from the standard curve. Reverse Transcription and PCR—Reverse transcription (RT) was carried out with 500 ng of total cellular RNA using either real time or One-Step RT-PCR system (Invitrogen) following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. For all experiments, optimal conditions were determined by initially generating cycle number-dependent expression curves, and test reactions were performed in the linear range for the PCR amplification. The same amounts of total RNA or genomic DNA (25Im H.-J. Pacione C. Chubinskaya S. van Wijnen A.J. Sun Y. Loeser F.R. J. Biol.

The assessment for GAPDH was performed in parallel. The One-Step RT-PCR system was performed using 30 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 40 s in the presence of 50 pmol of sense and antisense primers. The primer sequences and the conditions for their use are summarized in Table 1. The resulting PCR products were resolved in 1.5% agarose gels and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide and UV transillumination. Integrated density values for test genes were normalized relative to GAPDH values to yield a semi-quantitative assessment. For real time PCR, the primer sets specific to human genes and optimized conditions were used to generate <200-bp coding regions, spanning two exons and an intron as we performed previously (30Yang G.

The Renilla vector (pRL-TK) was co-transfected as an internal control, and the luciferase activity representing promoter activity was measured using the dualluciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and a luminometer (Berthold). In samples containing combinations of plasmids (i.e. co-transfections with MEKK cDNA construct with MMP-13 promoter/luciferase reporter construct), we adjusted the total amount of DNA concentration to <5 μg per 100 μl of cell-nucleofector solution complex for the entire sets of experiments to minimize the toxic effect observed at higher DNA concentrations. Immunohistochemistry—Full thickness cartilage slices from human ankle joints were cultured in 1.0 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Following a 2-day recovery period, the tissue explants were treated with or without bFGF (100 ng/ml) under serum-free conditions (mini-ITS). Following 9 days of incubation, the slices were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for overnight and embedded in paraffin, and 8 μm sections were prepared. The paraffin sections were deparaffinized and digested by chondroitinase ABC. The sections were then incubated with anti-MMP-13 antibody (mouse monoclonal, Cell Signaling) overnight after blocking endogenous peroxidase with 2% H2O2 in methanol and blocking nonspecific IgG binding with 10% goat serum. These antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-labeled rabbit anti-goat IgG (1:20 dilution) and stained with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrachloride (FAST tablet set; Sigma). Gel Shift Assay (Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays)—Gel shift assay was performed by using commercial AP-1 electrophoretic mobility shift assay kit (Panomics) for studying the formation of the specific nuclear DNA-AP-1 complex that represents AP-1 activation. Nuclear extracts prepared from human adult articular chondrocytes were incubated with the biotin-labeled double-stranded AP-1 consensus sequences (5′-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA-3′). The mixture was separated on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, and the shifted bands that correspond to the DNA-protein complexes were visualized by chemiluminescence imaging. Unlabeled double-stranded wild type oligonucleotides were used to determine the binding specificity of the assay. Statistical Analyses—The statistical significance of results was determined by analysis of variance, using StatView 5.0 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Data interpretation was performed by statistical normalization as assessed with histograms, and a 0.05 significance level was used for all statistical tests. Endogenous Levels of bFGF and MMP-13 Are Increased in Arthritic Patients—Evidence suggests that bFGF is pathologically associated with joint destruction and MMP-13 stimulation (10Qu Z. Huang X.N.

We further addressed the links of bFGF signals to the pathogenesis of cartilage degeneration by measuring the level of bFGF in human synovial fluid collected from normal and OA patients.

https://openalex.org/W2021292814,"Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a potent lipid mediator, is a ligand for a family of five G protein-coupled receptors (S1P1–5) that have been shown to regulate a variety of biological responses important for cancer progression. The cellular level of S1P is low and tightly regulated in a spatio-temporal manner through its synthesis catalyzed by two sphingosine kinases, denoted SphK1 and SphK2. Many stimuli activate and translocate SphK1 to the plasma membrane by mechanisms that are dependent on its phosphorylation. Much less is known about activation of SphK2. Here we demonstrate that epidermal growth factor (EGF) as well as the protein kinase C activator, phorbol ester, induce rapid phosphorylation of hSphK2 which was markedly reduced by inhibition of MEK1/ERK pathway. Down-regulation of ERK1 blocked EGF-induced phosphorylation of SphK2. Recombinant ERK1 phosphorylated hSphK2 in vitro and increased its enzymatic activity. ERK1 also was found to be in a complex with hSphK2 in vivo. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that hSphK2 is phosphorylated on Ser-351 and Thr-578 by ERK1 and that phosphorylation of these residues is important for EGF-stimulated migration of MDA-MB-453 cells. These studies provide the first clues to the mechanism of agonist-mediated SphK2 activation and enhance understanding of the regulation of SphK2 activity by phosphorylation and its role in movement of human breast cancer cells toward EGF.

This suggests that SphK1 and SphK2 might also have overlapping and/or complementary functions. In agreement, both SphK1 and SphK2 were required for EGF-induced migration of MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells (17Hait N.C. Sarkar S. Le Stunff H. Mikami A. Maceyka M. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Biol.

In this study, we show that EGF as well as PMA induce rapid phosphorylation of SphK2, which is mediated by ERK1. Furthermore, we found that phosphorylation of SphK2 not only results in an increase in its enzyme activity, but is also important for its ability to enhance EGF-induced chemotaxis of human breast cancer cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—[γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences and [32P]orthophosphate from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.

All constructs were sequenced to verify the desired mutation.Labeling of Cellular hSphK2—Naïve or transfected HEK 293 cells were serum-starved overnight in phosphate-free DMEM, metabolically labeled in the same medium with [32P]orthophosphate (70 μCi/ml) for 2.5 h at 37 °C, then treated as indicated in figure legends. Cells were harvested in cold PBS and hSphK2 was immunoprecipitated from lysates with anti-SphK2 antibody or pulled down with Ni-NTA-agarose as described below. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transblotted to nitrocellulose, and incorporation of 32P in hSphK2 was determined with a phosphorimager or by densitometry after exposing to x-ray film. Identification of the 32P-labled SphK2 band was confirmed by Western blotting.In Vitro Phosphorylation of hSphK2—Recombinant V5-His-tagged SphK2s expressed in HEK 293 cells were purified with Ni-NTA-agarose (33Pitson S.M.

After centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min at 4°C, equal amount of cell-free lysates were incubated with buffer A-equilibrated Ni-NTA resin for 30 min at 4 °C with constant agitation. Following centrifugation at 1000 × g, the Ni-NTA-agarose was washed with Buffer A, then Buffer A containing 50 mm imidazole and 1 m NaCl, and bound proteins eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol containing 150 mm imidazole. The buffer was exchanged and imidazole removed with Microcon YM-10 centrifugal filter (10 kDa cutoff, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The eluted recombinant SphK2 proteins were examined by silver staining SDS-PAGE gels and by immunoblotting with anti-V5 or anti-SphK2 antibodies. In vitro phosphorylation of these proteins was performed by incubating with 0.4 ng/μl of purified recombinant active ERK1 (Stressgen, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada) or 0.05 unit/μl of purified recombinant ERK2 (New England Biolabs), 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP, and 4 mm MgCl2 at 25 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped with 2× SDS sample buffer for SDS-PAGE and autoradiography or placed on ice for SphK2 enzyme activity assays. Incorporation of 32P into hSphK2 was determined as described above and normalized to SphK2 protein determined by immunoblotting.Immunoprecipitation, Pull Down, and Western Blotting— Cell lysates were precleared by incubation with protein A/G-agarose and then incubated with SphK2 antibody for 18 h at 4 °C with agitation. Immunecomplexes were isolated by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with protein A/G-agarose. Agarose beads were washed extensively, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and bound proteins analyzed by Western blotting. For pull down of V5-His-SphKs, equal amounts of lysates were incubated with Ni-NTA-agarose in lysis buffer containing 10 mm imidazole for 30 min at 4 °C with constant agitation. Protein-bound Ni-NTA-agarose was recovered by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min, washed, and proteins eluted with buffer containing 150 mm imidazole. Bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and Super-Signal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce).Chemotaxis Assays—Chemotaxis was measured in a modified Boyden chamber using polycarbonate filters (25 × 80 mm, 12 μm pore size) coated with collagen type IV (10 μg/ml) as described (17Hait N.C.

For each experiment, data from triplicate samples were calculated and expressed as means ± S.D.Statistical Analysis—Experiments were repeated at least three times with consistent results. Statistics were performed using SigmaStat statistical software version 2.0.RESULTSEGF and PMA Stimulate Phosphorylation of hSphK2—It has been shown that agonist-induced activation of hSphK1 results from its phosphorylation at Ser-225 by ERK1/2 (14Pitson S.M.

This phosphorylation was not only involved in translocation of SphK1 to the plasma membrane, it was essential for its oncogenic properties (15Pitson S.M. Xia P. Leclercq T.M. Moretti P.A. Zebol J.R. Lynn H.E. Wattenberg B.W. Vadas M.A. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In contrast, little is known of the mechanisms of SphK2 activation. Since SphK1 and SphK2 are highly homologous, it was of interest to examine whether activation of hSphK2 also proceeds via its phosphorylation. To this end, HEK 293 cells ectopically expressing hSphK2 were metabolically labeled with 32Pi and 32P incorporation into hSphK2 determined after immunoprecipitation with a specific antibody. hSphK2 was constitutively phosphorylated (Fig. 1A), and 32P incorporation was markedly increased after treatment with EGF (Fig. 1, A and C), which is known to stimulate SphK2 (17Hait N.C.

This increase in phosphorylation was accompanied by significantly increased SphK2 activity measured in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1B).The PKC activator, PMA, has been shown to stimulate SphK1 by inducing its phosphorylation (13Johnson K.R.

Indeed, PMA stimulated phosphorylation of hSphK2 in a time-dependent manner, increasing 32P incorporation by more than 8-fold within 20 min (Fig. 1D).Recently, a 36-amino acid N-terminally extended SphK2 splice variant, SphK2-L (21Billich A.

EGF and PMA also markedly enhanced phosphorylation of ectopically expressed hSphK2-L (Fig. 1E).ERK1/2 Phosphorylates hSphK2 in Vivo—The NetPhos phosphorylation web site (34Blom N. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2476) Google Scholar) predicts that hSphK2 possesses 33 potential serine and threonine (but no tyrosine) phosphorylation sites, including putative sites for PKC, PKA, ERK, and casein kinase. ERK1/2 are closely related members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family that have been implicated in phosphorylation and activation of SphK1 (14Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A. Zebol J.R. Lynn H.E.

Similar results were obtained with PD98059, another MEK1/2 inhibitor (Fig. 2C). Moreover, the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478, which also inhibited EGF-induced activation of ERK1/2 (data not shown), likewise inhibited EGF-induced phosphorylation of hSphK2 (Fig. 2D). Collectively, these data suggest that ERK1/2 might be the kinase(s) that phosphorylates SphK2 downstream of EGFR.FIGURE 2MEK1/2 and EGFR inhibitors block EGF-mediated hSphK2 phosphorylation. HEK 293 cells transfected with either hSphK2 or empty vector were serum-starved overnight in phosphate-free DMEM and metabolically labeled with 32Pi for 2.5 h.

Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-hSphK2 antibody, proteins separated by SDS-PAGE, and 32P incorporation analyzed by autoradiography. Duplicate unlabeled samples were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-V5 antibody (A–D), anti-SphK2, or anti-pERK1/2 (B).

Treatment of HEK 293 cells ectopically expressing hSphK2 with PMA dramatically increased phosphorylation of hSphK2 (Fig. 3A). Moreover, this PMA-induced phosphorylation was inhibited by GF109203X (Fig. 3A), a specific PKC inhibitor (37Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V.

Of note, PMA also activated MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, as determined with phospho-specific antibodies, which was completely abolished by GF109203X (Fig. 3B), suggesting that PMA activates MEK1/2 that in turn regulates ERK1/2.

Interestingly, each repeat sequence of OAA showed a high degree of similarity to those of a myxobacterium, Myxococcus xanthus hemagglutinin, and a marine red alga Eucheuma serra lectin. A systematic binding assay with pyridylaminated oligosaccharides revealed that OAA exclusively binds to high mannose (HM)-type N-glycans but not to other N-glycans, including complex types, hybrid types, and the pentasaccharide core or oligosaccharides from glycolipids. OAA did not interact with any of free mono- and oligomannoses that are constituents of the branched oligomannosides. These results suggest that the core disaccharide, GlcNAc-GlcNAc, is also essential for binding to OAA. The binding activity of OAA to HM type N-glycans was dramatically decreased when α1–2 Man was attached to α1–3 Man branched from the α1–6 Man of the pentasaccharide core. This specificity of OAA for HM-type oligosaccharides is distinct from other HM-binding lectins.

Little is known about the evolutionary history of plant lectins because of limited data on lectins from lower plants, including marine algae. Previously, we have identified macroalgal lectins (11Kawakubo A. Makino H. Ohnishi J. Hirohara H. Hori K. J. Appl. Phycol. 1997; 9: 331-338Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 12Kawakubo A. Makino H.

ESA-2 has a sequence that is highly homologous with myxobacterium, Myxococcus xanthus hemagglutinin (MBHA) (13Romeo J.M. Esmon B. Zusman D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The structural similarity between lectins of a prokaryotic bacterium and eukaryotic macro algae led us to focus on lectins from cyanobacteria, which are evolutionarily classified between bacteria and macro algae. We surveyed for lectins in 19 cyanobacteria species, and among the 6 positive species we have purified and partially characterized a novel lectin from a freshwater cyanobacterium, Oscillatoria agardhii (16Sato Y. Murakami M. Miyazawa K. Hori K. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 2000; 125: 169-177Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the lectin, termed OAA, also showed a high degree of similarity to ESA-2 and MBHA (16Sato Y. Murakami M. Miyazawa K. Hori K. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 2000; 125: 169-177Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cyanobacterial lectins have also attracted attention since they show potent anti-HIV activity. The HIV-inactivating proteins, cyanovirin-N (CV-N) and scytovirin, from Nostoc ellipsosporum and Scytonema varium, respectively, are both high mannose oligosaccharide-binding lectins (17Bewley C.A.

In the present work we have elucidated the primary structure and detailed carbohydrate binding specificity of OAA, a lectin from cyanobacterium. We found that OAA has exclusive binding specificity for high mannose N-glycans that is similar to ESA-2 and has a highly conserved overall sequence with ESA-2 and MBHA. Moreover, we found that OAA potently inhibits HIV replication in MT-4 cells. Materials—O. agardhii lectin (OAA) was prepared as described previously (16Sato Y. Murakami M. Miyazawa K. Hori K. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 2000; 125: 169-177Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and kept at –20 °C until used. Concanavalin A (ConA) was purchased from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). TPCK-trypsin was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Asp-N was obtained from Takara (Kyoto, Japan), and lysylendopeptidase was from WAKO (Osaka, Japan). Pyridylaminated (PA) oligosaccharides were purchased from Takara. Mannobioses (Man α1–2 Man, Man α1–3 Man, Man α1–6 Man), mannotriose (Man α1–6 [Man α1–3] Man), and mannopentaose (Man α1–6 [Man α1–3] Man α1–6 [Man α1–3] Man) were from Funakoshi (Tokyo, Japan). Recombinant glycosylated HIV-1 IIIB gp120 (baculovirus) was purchased from ImmunoDiagnostics, and bovine thyroglobulin was from WAKO (Osaka, Japan). All other chemicals used in this study were of the highest purity available. Enzymatic Digestion and Separation of Peptides—First OAA was subjected to S-pyridylethylation as described previously (16Sato Y. Murakami M. Miyazawa K. Hori K. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 2000; 125: 169-177Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). 100 μgof S-pyridylethylated (PE) OAA was digested with TPCK-trypsin (enzyme/substrate = 1/100 (w/w)) in 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.5, at 37 °C for 24 h. Asp-N digestion (enzyme/substrate = 1/50 (w/w)) was performed using the same amount of PE-OAA in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, at 37 °C for 18 h. For lysylendopeptidase (LEP) digestion, PE-OAA (100 μg) was denatured in 8 m urea and subsequently digested with LEP (enzyme/substrate = 1/100 (w/w)) at 37 °C for 18 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0. For the isolation of peptide fragments, each digest was separated by reverse-phase HPLC on a YMC PROTEIN-RP column (6.0 × 250 mm) using a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Amino Acid Sequence Analysis—Amino acid compositions were determined with an amino acid analyzer (Shimadzu) after hydrolyzes of samples in 6 n HCl containing 3% phenol at 166 °C for 20 min. The amino acid sequences of intact protein and peptides generated by enzyme digestion were determined by an automated-protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems 477A) connected to 3-phenyl-2-thiohydantoin of amino acid (PTH) analyzer (120A). C-terminal Amino Acid Sequence Analysis—OAA (5 nmol) was denatured by heating at 60 °C for 20 min in the presence of 0.5% SDS in 50 μl of 0.1 m pyridine, acetic acid, pH 5.6. The denatured protein was digested with 3 μl of carboxypeptidase Y (1 mg/ml), and the amino acids produced at each time point (0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 60 min) were determined by amino acid analysis calibrating with the internal standard of norleucine (5 nmol). Molecular Weight Determination of Protein and Peptides—The molecular weights of native OAA, PE-OAA, and peptide fragments were determined by electron spray ionization (ESI) -mass spectrometry (LCQ, Finingan). Sequence Data Processing—Homologous sequences were identified with the BLAST program. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the amino acid sequences by DNASIS Pro software (Hitachi, Japan). The degrees of confidence for the phylogenetic trees were estimated by the bootstrap procedure. Preparation of PA Oligomannoses—Pyridylamination of each oligomannose was performed according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol (a pyridylamination reagent kit, Takara) using a semi-automated PA derivatization apparatus (Palstation, Takara). Briefly, 20 μl of 2-aminopyridine in acetic acid was added to 50 nmol of lyophilized oligomannoses (mannobioses, mannotriose, and mannopentaose) and heated at 90 °C for 60 min. Twenty μl of borane-dimethylamine, acetic acid was then added, and the mixture was heated at 80 °C for 60 min. Excess reagents were removed by normal phase HPLC on a TSKgel NH2-60 column (4.6 × 250 mm) using a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 50 mm acetic acid, triethylamine, pH 7.3, at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at 40 °C. The eluate was monitored at an excitation wavelength of 310 nm and an emission wavelength of 380 nm, and the peak was fractionated. Quantification was performed by drying each PA oligosaccharide in a SpeedVac and subjecting them to gas phase acid hydrolysis in 4 n HCl, 4 m trifluoroacetic acid (1/1, v/v) at 100 °C for 4 h. An aliquot of hydrolysate was applied to reverse-phase HPLC on a TSKgel ODS-80TM column (4.6×150 mm). Elution was done with 10% methanol in 0.1 m ammonium acetate buffer at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at 40 °C. The resultant PA mannose was quantified by comparing the retention time and the peak area with authentic PA mannose (Takara) in the HPLC. Binding Assay by the Centrifugal Ultrafiltration-HPLC Method—The oligosaccharide binding properties of OAA and ConA were examined using a centrifugal ultrafiltration-HPLC method as described by Katoh et al. (20Katoh H. Satomura S. Matsuura S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, 90 μl of 500 nm OAA in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 10 μl of 300 nm PA oligosaccharide were mixed and kept at room temperature for 60 min. The reaction mixture was then ultrafiltered (10,000 × g for 30 s) with Nanospin Plus (Gelman Science) with a molecular weight cut-off value of 10,000 to recover unreacted PA oligosaccharides. An aliquot of the filtrate was applied to a TSKgel ODS 80TM column (4.6×150 mm) and eluted with 10% methanol in 0.1 m ammonium acetate buffer at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at 40 °C. The eluate was monitored at an excitation wavelength of 320 nm and an emission wavelength of 400 nm, and unbound PA oligosaccharide (O unbound) was quantified. The amount of bound PA oligosaccharide (O bound) was obtained by the formula O bound = O added – O unbound, where O added represents the amount of added PA oligosaccharide, which was determined from the filtrate of reaction solution without a lectin. The binding activity (O bound/O added) was calculated as a ratio of the amount of bound PA oligosaccharide to that of added and expressed as % binding. As a reference, the oligosaccharide binding property of ConA was examined under the same conditions described above except with the reaction buffer, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2 to meet the metal ion requirements of ConA. Kinetic Binding Analysis—The association constant and the number of carbohydrate binding sites in OAA were determined with an HM-type PA heptasaccharide (Man α1–6 [Man α1–3] Man α1–6 [Man α1–3] Manβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–4GlcNAc-PA) as follows. Ninety μl of 15 nm OAA was reacted with 10 μl of the PA heptasaccharide (100–500 nm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, on an ice bath for 60 min. The amount of bound PA oligosaccharide in each reaction mixture was determined by the centrifugal ultrafiltration-HPLC method, and the data were used for Scatchard plot analysis. Anti-HIV Activity of OAA—In vitro evaluation of anti-HIV activity of OAA was performed by a colorimetric assay as described by Pauwels et al. (21Pauwels R. Balzarini J. Baba M. Snoeck R. Schols D. Herdewijn P. Desmyter J. De Clercq E. J. Virol. Methods. 1988; 20: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-3,5-diphenylformazon (MTT, Sigma-Aldrich) was used to detect the viability of both HIV-1- and mock-infected MT-4 cells in the presence of a test compound at various concentrations. Human T-cell leukemia virus-IIIB HIV-1 was the strain used. Interaction of OAA with gp120—Direct interaction of OAA with the HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 was analyzed by surface plasmon resonance using a BIAcore 2000 system. For the immobilization on the chip, carboxymethylated dextran-coated sensor chips (CM5, Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) were activated with a 7-min pulse of N-hydroxysuccinimide/N-ethyl-N′-dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide, and recombinant glycosylated HIV-1 IIIB gp120 (baculovirus) was immobilized to give 600 resonance units (RU). The unreacted groups on the sensor surface were blocked with 1 m ethanolamine. A control channel was treated in the same manner without ligand injection. Binding experiments were performed at a flow rate of 30 μl/min using a running buffer, pH 7.4, consisting of 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Surfactant P20, and 3 mm EDTA. The sensor surface was regenerated by 100 mm HCl and 100 mm NaOH. As a reference the interaction of OAA with bovine thyroglobulin (1617 RU) immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip was also analyzed in the same way. Kinetic parameters (ka, kd, KA, and KD) were calculated by fitting the data to the Langmuir model for 1:1 binding using the BIAevaluation 3.0 software (BIA-core international AB, Sweden). To examine the involvement of high mannose oligosaccharides on the interaction of OAA with gp120, the reaction mixtures of 25 nm OAA and bovine thyroglobulin at various concentrations (0.04, 0.2, 1, and 5 μm) were injected into the flow cell with immobilized gp120 (600 RU) on a CM5 sensor chip. Amino Acid Sequence of OAA—First, 38 amino acids from the N terminus of PE-OAA were sequenced (Fig. 1). To determine the remaining sequence, PE-OAA was digested with trypsin, Asp-N, or lysylendopeptidase. The digested peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC and designated T1-T9 for trypsin, A1-A8 for Asp-N, and L1-L2 for lysylendopeptidase (data not shown). A complete amino acid sequence of OAA was determined by overlapping the sequences of peptide fragments generated by cleavage with trypsin and Asp-N. Peptides A-8 and A-5 established the connections between T-5 and T-8 and between T-8 and T-3, respectively (Fig. 1). The C-terminal amino acid sequence of OAA was determined by sequential digestion of intact OAA with carboxypeptidase Y followed by amino acid analyses to predict Thr-Thr-Leu-COOH (data not shown). This partial sequence was only found at the C-terminal end of peptide A-4, and the amino acid composition of peptide A-4 coincided with that obtained from sequencing data. This indicates that sequencing of A-4 peptide was complete and ended with Thr-Thr-Leu. Thus, peptide A-4 was assigned to the C terminus. The molecular mass of each peptide determined by ESI-mass spectrometry agreed with the value calculated from the sequence, confirming the validity of the overlap. OAA was composed of 132 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass (13924.9) that agreed with the value (13924.1) of native and S-pyridylethylated OAA determined by ESI-mass spectrometry. Thus, the protein contained no cysteine and no carbohydrates. Although there are two triplet sequences (Asn-47—Gly-48—Thr-49 and Asn-67—Asn-68—Ser-69) for N-glycosylation sites in the molecule, OAA did not show sugar staining of the protein band transferred on a nitrocellulose membrane after SDS-PAGE. The sequence comprised two homologous domains, each consisting of the N- (67 residues) and C-terminal halves (65 residues) with 75% sequence identity between them. Hydropathy analysis revealed a hydrophobic region in the middle of each repeat domain and hydrophilic regions at both ends of the domain. OAA was predicted to have a high degree of β-structure (50% of the protein) that presumably contributes to the high stability of this protein (data not shown). Structural Similarities with Other Proteins—OAA showed extremely high sequence similarity with an agglutinin, MBHA, from the Gram-negative bacterium M. xanthus (13Romeo J.M. Esmon B. Zusman D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6332-6336Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 14Cumsky M.G. Zusman D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1981; 256: 12596-12599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as a lectin, ESA-2, from the marine red alga E. serra, which has preferential affinity for HM type N-glycans4 (Fig. 2). Furthermore, a putative protein deduced from the genome sequence of Pseudomonas fluorescens PfO-1 showed a considerable sequence similarity to OAA (Fig. 2). ESA-2 and MBHA are composed of four tandemly repeated homologous domains of 67 amino acids. In contrast, the molecular size of OAA and a putative protein from P. fluorescens were just half of the other two lectins and contained only two tandemly repeated domains. The degrees of similarity of Pseudomonas protein, ESA-2, and MBHA with OAA at their N-terminal portions (each 132 residues) were 62.1, 62.1, and 62.9% for identical amino acids, respectively. Both N and C termini of each repeated domain were conserved among these lectins (Fig. 2). From a phylogenetic tree constructed based on pairwise comparison of the amino acid sequences, both bacterial lectins from P. fluorescens and M. xanthus were evolutionarily closer, as expected from their taxonomic classifications (Fig. 3). In contrast, marine algal lectin ESA-2 showed a larger evolutionary distance to the bacterial lectins than the cyanobacterial lectin OAA. These results correlated well with the taxonomic positions of the producing organisms, and these lectins seem to be evolved from bacterial origin. On the other hand, OAA showed no sequence similarity with other cyanobacterial lectins; that is, MAL from Microcystis aeruginosa (22Jimbo M. Yamaguchi M. Muramoto K. Kamiya H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) or the HIV-inactivating lectins MLV from Microcystis viridis lectin (23Yamaguchi M. Ogawa T. Muramoto K. Kamio Y. Jimbo M.

Of the 46 kinds of PA oligosaccharides tested, OAA showed strict binding specificity for HM type N-glycans (14–26) as shown in Fig. 5. No significant interaction was observed for any other types of N-glycans including complex (1–13), hybrid (27–29), a pentasaccharide core and its relatives (30–32), or oligosaccharides from glycolipids (33–40). These results clearly demonstrate that OAA recognizes the branched moiety of HM type N-glycans. We also observed that HM-type N-glycan binding of OAA is affected by the structures of the branched oligomannosides. The binding activity of OAA for the oligosaccharides (14, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24, and 25) bearing nonreducing terminal α1–3 Man branched from the α1–6 Man arm of the pentasaccharide core were consistently higher than 97%, except for the oligosaccharides 24 and 25 (60.9 and 69.9%, respectively). In contrast, binding activity of OAA was remarkably reduced toward the oligosaccharides (16, 18, 20, 21, and 23), which have α1–2 Man attached to the α1–3 Man mentioned before. This was most evident by a comparison of the activities with 14 (97.4%) and 23 (0%). The presence of the nonreducing terminal α1–3 Man residue branched from the α1–6 arm of pentasaccharide core appears to be critical for binding with OAA. In addition, the presence of another nonreducing terminal α1–3 Man, which constitutes a part of the pentasaccharide core, also appears to slightly contribute to the binding, as indicated by the lower activities with the oligosaccharides 24 and 25 that lack the mannose residue and by comparison of binding activities between 24 (60.9%) and 14 (97.4%). These results suggest that the α1–3 Man residue of core structure might establish an additional contact with OAA. Interestingly, OAA did not interact with free mono- (46), di- (41–43), tri- (44), and pentamannosides (45), which are constituents of the branched oligomannosides. This result suggests that the portion of the reducing terminal disaccharide, GlcNAc-GlcNAc, of HM N-glycans is also essential for interaction with OAA. The unique binding nature of this lectin was most obvious when the binding activities of the oligosaccharides 14 (97.4%) and 45 (0%) were compared. In contrast to OAA, ConA, a high mannose binding lectin, bound to bi-antennary complex type N-glycans (1), a core pentasaccharide (30), oligomannoses (41–45), and HM-type glycans (14–23) in this assay system. The relative binding of ConA for these oligosaccharides was comparable with previous work (25Baenziger J.U. Fiete D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2400-2407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Gupta P. Oscarson S. Raju T.S. Stanley P. Toone E.J. Brewer F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). ConA could discriminate a biantennary complex type N-glycan from a triantennary complex type (25.1% for 1, 0% for 2). In contrast to OAA, ConA showed no fine discrimination for HM glycans, exhibiting consistently high binding activities (Fig. 5). The rank order of the affinities of ConA for oligomannoses was Man α1–6 ([Man α1–3] Man α1–6 [Man α1–3] Man (45, 88.4%) > Man α1–2 Man (41, 44.7%) > Man α1–6 [Man α1–3] Man (44, 32.5%) > Man α1–3 Man (42, 21.6%) > Man α1–6 Man (43, 13.9%).FIGURE 4The structures of PA oligosaccharides used in this study.

https://openalex.org/W1988970127,"Selenoprotein P (Sepp1) has two domains with respect to selenium content: the N-terminal, selenium-poor domain and the C-terminal, selenium-rich domain. To assess domain function, mice with deletion of the C-terminal domain have been produced and compared with Sepp1–/– and Sepp1+/+ mice. All mice studied were males fed a semipurified diet with defined selenium content. The Sepp1 protein in the plasma of mice with the C-terminal domain deleted was determined by mass spectrometry to terminate after serine 239 and thus was designated Sepp1Δ240–361. Plasma Sepp1 and selenium concentrations as well as glutathione peroxidase activity were determined in the three types of mice. Glutathione peroxidase and Sepp1Δ240–361 accounted for over 90% of the selenium in the plasma of Sepp1Δ240–361 mice. Calculations using results from Sepp1+/+ mice revealed that Sepp1, with a potential for containing 10 selenocysteine residues, contained an average of 5 selenium atoms per molecule, indicating that shortened and/or selenium-depleted forms of the protein were present in these wild-type mice. Sepp1Δ240–361 mice had low brain and testis selenium concentrations that were similar to those in Sepp1–/– mice but they better maintained their whole body selenium. Sepp1Δ240–361 mice had depressed fertility, even when they were fed a high selenium diet, and their spermatozoa were defective and morphologically indistinguishable from those of selenium-deficient mice. Neurological dysfunction and death occurred when Sepp1Δ240–361 mice were fed selenium-deficient diet. These phenotypes were similar to those of Sepp1–/– mice but had later onset or were less severe. The results of this study demonstrate that the C terminus of Sepp1 is critical for the maintenance of selenium in brain and testis but not for the maintenance of whole body selenium. Selenoprotein P (Sepp1) has two domains with respect to selenium content: the N-terminal, selenium-poor domain and the C-terminal, selenium-rich domain.

Calculations using results from Sepp1+/+ mice revealed that Sepp1, with a potential for containing 10 selenocysteine residues, contained an average of 5 selenium atoms per molecule, indicating that shortened and/or selenium-depleted forms of the protein were present in these wild-type mice. Sepp1Δ240–361 mice had low brain and testis selenium concentrations that were similar to those in Sepp1–/– mice but they better maintained their whole body selenium. Sepp1Δ240–361 mice had depressed fertility, even when they were fed a high selenium diet, and their spermatozoa were defective and morphologically indistinguishable from those of selenium-deficient mice. Neurological dysfunction and death occurred when Sepp1Δ240–361 mice were fed selenium-deficient diet. These phenotypes were similar to those of Sepp1–/– mice but had later onset or were less severe. The results of this study demonstrate that the C terminus of Sepp1 is critical for the maintenance of selenium in brain and testis but not for the maintenance of whole body selenium.

Hill K.E. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2005; 25: 215-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Rat Sepp1 cDNA codes for 366 amino acid residues, 10 of which are selenocysteines and 17 cysteines (2Hill K.E. Lloyd R.S. Yang J.-G. Read R. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10050-10053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two domains with respect to selenium content are discernable. The N-terminal 244 residues include 1 selenocysteine and 7 cysteines. Two potential redox motifs: 40UXXC43 and 153CXXC156 are present in this domain, allowing the prediction that it has enzymatic properties (3Saito Y. Sato N. Hirashima M. Takebe G. Nagasawa S. Takahashi K. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The smaller C-terminal domain comprises 122 amino acid residues: 9 of them are selenocysteines and 10 are cysteines. Thus, the C-terminal one-third of the protein contains 90% of its selenium, raising the possibility that this domain plays a role in selenium transport. Each domain, then, has been postulated to have a distinct function. Sepp1 was purified from rat plasma using a monoclonal antibody to the N-terminal domain. After applying the purified protein to a heparin column, we eluted 4 isoforms using a pH gradient (4Chittum H.S. Himeno S. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry analysis identified the isoforms as sharing the same amino acid sequence but terminating at positions corresponding to UGAs (which code for selenocysteines) in the open reading frame (5Ma S. Hill K.E. Caprioli R.M. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12749-12754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition to the full-length protein, isoforms terminating at the second, third, and seventh in-frame UGAs were identified. Others have studied Sepp1 synthesis in cell culture and have even identified a form with termination at the first in-frame UGA (6Stoytcheva Z. Tujebajeva R.M. Harney J.W. Berry M.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 9177-9184Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Production of the isoforms found in plasma might occur by termination of translation at UGAs that, if read through, would dictate insertion of selenocysteine or by removal of C-terminal fragments of the full-length protein. The latter possibility might constitute a mechanism of selenium delivery. In any case, the discovery of the isoforms supported the postulates that the two domains had distinct functions. Mouse Sepp1 has 84% sequence identity with the rat protein and the same apparent domains. Mice with the Sepp1 gene (Sepp1) deleted have been produced and found to have depressed whole body selenium caused by excessive selenium excretion in the urine (7Burk R.F. Hill K.E. Motley A.K. Austin L.M. Norsworthy B.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1760: 1789-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, they have sharply depressed testis and brain selenium concentrations and dysfunction of those two organs (8Hill K.E. Zhou J. McMahan W.J. Motley A.K. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13640-13646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Feeding a high selenium diet prevented brain dysfunction (9Hill K.E. Zhou J. McMahan W.J. Motley A.K. Burk R.F. J. Nutr. 2004; 134: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), but abnormal spermatozoa were produced regardless of the dietary selenium content (10Olson G.E. Winfrey V.P. Nagdas S.K. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Biol. Reprod. 2005; 73: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). When hepatic Sepp1 synthesis was suppressed by hepatic-specific deletion of the tRNA for selenocysteine, a sharp decrease in kidney selenium occurred, leading to the hypothesis that Sepp1 transports selenium to the kidney in a specific manner (11Schweizer U. Streckfuss F. Pelt P. Carlson B.A. Hatfield D.L. Köhrle J. Schomburg L. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). All these findings support the hypothesis that Sepp1 is involved in selenium transport and metabolism in the mouse. As a strategy to investigate the two domains of Sepp1 in vivo, mice with deletion of the C-terminal domain have been produced. We have named the resulting truncated protein Sepp1Δ240–361 to reflect the deletion of amino acid residues 240–361. These residues correspond to residues 245–366 in the rat protein and include 9 of 10 selenocysteines. The present report describes the production and characterization of these mice.

Naruse of Kaketsuken, The Chemo-Sero-Therapeutic Research Institute, Kumamoto, Japan. All other chemicals were of reagent grade. Strategy for Production of Sepp1 Mutant Mouse Expressing Truncated Sepp1—Selection of the mouse genomic DNA clone MG6138 subclone 10 used for the production of Sepp1–/– mice has been described (8Hill K.E. Zhou J. McMahan W.J. Motley A.K. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13640-13646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). This subclone and downstream overlapping subclone 8 were used to produce a mutant mouse in which the C-terminal 122 amino acid residues of Sepp1 were deleted. The deleted portion of the DNA clone contains 8 in-frame TGAs that encode 8 selenocysteine residues in the protein. The second of the two TGAs remaining in the expressed transcript was adjacent to the termination codon that was inserted. Construction of Knock-out Vectors—MG6138P1 DNA was prepared and digested with BamHI. The fragments from the digest were ligated into pBluescript II and transformed into Escherichia coli. Bacterial colonies were screened by PCR, using primers SeP4342 (5′-CGCAGAACGCACAAAGAATGTAGATGGC-3′) and SePBsuR (5′-GTACCCTTAGGCCAGAAGAGGGCACTGGG-3′). Clone P1 10 contained a 12-kb fragment of genomic DNA, and was used for construction of a Sepp1 knock-out vector (8Hill K.E. Zhou J. McMahan W.J. Motley A.K. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13640-13646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Clone P1 8 was used in conjunction with clone P1 10 to construct a truncated Sepp1 vector (SePMTKNT). The SePMTKNT vector was constructed using the following procedure (Fig. 1): 1) Clone P1 8 was used as template for amplification of a PCR fragment that introduced an in-frame stop codon (TAA) immediately following the second in-frame TGA codon of Sepp1. The sense primer (5′-ACTCTGCCTCCTTCAGGCTTGCACCACCACCACAGGCATAGGGGCCAGCACAGGCAGGGTCACTTAGAGAGCTGATAAGATCTGCAAGTGAAGG-3′), containing the inserted termination codon (bold, underlined), an introduced BglII site (italics), and the antisense primer (5′-CAATGTGAGCATGCTGAACAATAAAGACACACACTTGAAAG-3′) produced a PCR fragment of 1.3 kb. The PCR product was cut with EcoNI and SphI and was ligated with clone P1 8 digested with the same enzymes, replacing the wild-type sequence and resulting in SeP8_BglII+ (length: 6.3 kb). 2) Clone P1 10 was cut with SpeI, and the resulting DNA fragment was cloned into pBC resulting in pBC-[SpeI]. 3) Ligation of the following 3 pieces: (a) KpnI/HindIII digest of pBC[SpeI] (length: 1.1 kb); (b) SphI/KpnI digest of pBC[SpeI] (length: 4.5 kb); and (c) HindIII/SphI digest of SeP 8_BglII+ (length: 1.8 kb) resulted in pBC[K-S]_BglII+ (length: 7.4 kb). 4) A 3.7-kb BglII fragment excised from pACN-1 was ligated to pBC[K-S]_BglII+ vector linearized with BglII, yielding SePMTKIN (length: 11.1 kb). 5) Ligation of the following 3 pieces: (a) NotI/XhoI digest of pTK1-TK2-C (length: 4.6 kb); (b) NotI/KpnI digest of SePMTKIN (length: 8.3 kb); and (c) XhoI/KpnI digest of pBC[SpeI] (length: 8.4 kb) resulted in SePMTKNT (length: 21.3 kb). After linearization with NotI, the two SECIS elements were retained, and total homology with Sepp1 genomic DNA was 13 kb. Generation of Sepp1Δ240–361 Mice—ES cell transformation with SePMTKNT and blastocyst injection were carried out in the Mouse Core Facility at the University of Utah using published procedures (14Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Cell. 1987; 51: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar, 15Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Nature. 1990; 346: 847-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). PCR assays were used to determine the genotype of ES cells and adult mice as described previously (8Hill K.E. Zhou J. McMahan W.J. Motley A.K. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13640-13646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The primers used to screen for ES-positive cells were MoSePA11 (5′-CCAACTTGTAATCTATCAGTTAGGAGCTGCA-3′) and ACNeoS1 (5′-CCTTCTATCGCCTTCTTGACGAGTTCTTC-3′). Cells containing the mutant gene gave a PCR product of 2.7 kb. The primers used to screen tissue DNA were MoSePS18 (5′-GCAGGAGCATCTTGGCAGCAGT-3′) and MoSePA19 (5′-CACTGACAGGATTCAGTGACTTTCTCCT-3′). PCR product sizes are: wild type (Sepp1+/+) 370 bp; homozygote (Sepp1Δ240–361) 450 bp. Animal Husbandry—Adult mice expressing only Sepp1Δ240–361 (homozygotes) or expressing full-length Sepp1 and Sepp1Δ240–361 (heterozygotes) were transferred to the animal facility at Vanderbilt University from the University of Utah. The Sepp1Δ240–361 and Sepp1–/– strains received from Utah were backcrossed 10 times with C57BL/6 mice, producing the congenic strains that were used for the studies presented here. Sepp1Δ240–361 mice were produced by mating heterozygotes. Pups were weaned 21 days after birth, and their genotypes were determined by PCR. Sepp1–/– pups were obtained by mating Sepp1+/– breeding pairs. Mice were housed in plastic cages with aspen shavings as bedding material. The light:dark cycle was 10 h:14 h. Breeding mice received rodent chow (Lab Diet 5001, Richmond, IN) while nursing dams received rodent maternity chow (Lab Diet 5015). Male mice were used for experiments and they received pelleted Torula yeast-based diet supplemented with selenium as required for each study. The basal form of the Torula-yeast diet contained <0.02 mg selenium/kg (8Hill K.E. Zhou J. McMahan W.J. Motley A.K. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13640-13646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Sodium selenite was added to this diet during mixing to give the desired selenium content. The diet was mixed and pelleted to our specifications by Harlan-Teklad (Madison, WI). All mice received food and water ad libitum. The Vanderbilt University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved animal protocols for studies at Vanderbilt and the corresponding University of Utah committee approved the protocols used to generate the mutant mouse. In experiments that required tissues to be harvested, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and exsanguinated by removal of blood from the inferior vena cava. Blood was treated with Na2EDTA (1 mg/ml) to prevent coagulation and plasma was separated by centrifugation. Liver, kidney, testis, and brain were harvested and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Plasma and tissues were stored at –80 °C until assayed. Fertility Studies—Sepp1Δ240–361 and C57BL/6 male mice (2–3 months of age) were exposed to C57BL/6 female mice for periods of 4 days. The female mice were examined for evidence of pregnancy beginning at day 14 after initial exposure to a male. If there was no evidence of a pregnancy by day 21, the female was exposed to a different male for a 4-day period. Each male was thus exposed to 6 different females, and the numbers of pregnancies and progeny were recorded. Analysis of Spermatozoa from Sepp1Δ240–361 Mice—The caput and cauda regions of the epididymis were minced in Dulbecco's PBS. The sperm suspension was fixed by adding an equal volume of 4% formaldehyde buffered with 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and spermatozoa were examined by phase contrast microscopy. Biochemical Measurements—Plasma glutathione peroxidase activity was measured by the coupled method with 0.25 mm hydrogen peroxide as substrate (16Lawrence R.A. Burk R.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 71: 952-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (2900) Google Scholar). Plasma Sepp1 was measured by ELISA. The monoclonal antibody 9S4 was used as the capture antibody, and the polyclonal antibody preparation 695, obtained from a rabbit immunized with rat Sepp1, was used as the detection antibody. Antibody preparation 695 had been immunoaffinity-purified from serum using a mouse Sepp1 column. The ELISA protocol required coating wells of a microtiter plate with 9S4 (0.1 μg/well), followed by blocking with Block Ace (Serotec, Ltd, Raleigh, NC). After washing, the plate was incubated with sample (50 μl of preprepared plasma) and purified antibody preparation 695 (50 μl of 1 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (whole molecule) was used to detect the amount of 695 bound to Sepp1 or Sepp1Δ240–361 captured by 9S4. TMB Microwell Peroxidase Substrate System (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) was used for color development with 1 n H2SO4 as the stop solution. The developed color was measured at 450 nm with a Multiskan Spectrum plate reader (ThermoElectron Corporation, Vantaa, Finland). Plasma samples were prepared prior to assay by dilution in PBST (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20) containing 2% rat plasma cleared of Sepp1 by monoclonal antibody 8F11 (17Read R. Bellew T. Yang J.-G. Hill K.E. Palmer I.S. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17899-17905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) immunoaffinity purification. Typically 0.1 μl of normal mouse plasma was used in the ELISA assay. Larger amounts were required for plasma from selenium-deficient mice. Each assay plate contained a standard curve constructed with 9S4 immunoaffinity-purified mouse Sepp1 (0–7.5 ng of Sepp1). The immunoaffinity column was prepared according to the manufacturer's directions using 9S4 monoclonal antibody and Amino-link Coupling Gel (Pierce). Selenium was measured using a modification of the fluorometric assay of Koh and Benson (18Koh T.S. Benson T.H. J. Assoc. Off. Anal. Chem. 1983; 66: 918-926PubMed Google Scholar, 19Sheehan T.M.T. Gao M. Clin. Chem. 1990; 36: 2124-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The lower limit of detection of this assay is 1 ng of selenium. Purification and Mass Spectrometry Studies of Sepp1Δ240–361— Plasma was obtained from Sepp1Δ240–361 mice. Sepp1Δ240–361 was purified using a 9S4 immunoaffinity column. Purified protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 10% Ready Gel (Bio-Rad). After staining with Coomassie Blue, the protein band was excised. After 1 h of in-gel digestion with Trypsin Gold (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), the peptides were identified by LC-MS. The LC-MS/MS analyses were performed on a Thermo-Finnigan LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a ThermoFinnigan Surveyor LC pump and autosampler, NanoSpray source (Thermo Electron), and Xcalibur 1.4 instrument control and data analysis software. HPLC separation of the tryptic peptides was achieved with 100 mm × 11 cm C-18 capillary column (Monitor C18, 5 micron, 100 Å, Column Engineering), at 0.7 μl min–1 flow rate. Solvent A was H2O containing 0.1% formic acid and solvent B was acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid. The gradient program was: 0–3 min, linear gradient from 0 to 5% B; 3–5 min, 5% B; 5–50 min, linear gradient to 50% B; 50–52 min, linear gradient to 80% B; 52–55 min, linear gradient to 90% B; 55–56 min, 90% B in solvent A. MS/MS scans were acquired using an isolation width of 2 m/z, an activation time of 30 ms, and activation Q of 0.250 and 30% normalized collision energy using 1 microscan and ion time of 100 for each MS/MS scan. The mass spectrometer was tuned prior to analysis using the synthetic peptide TpepK (AVAGKAGAR); some parameters may have varied slightly from experiment to experiment, but typically the tune parameters were as follows: spray voltage of 2.0 kV, a capillary temperature of 160 °C, a capillary voltage of 60 V and tube lens 130 V. Initial tandem MS analysis was performed using data-dependent scanning in which one full MS spectrum, using a full mass range of 400–2000 amu, was followed by 3 MS/MS spectra. Peptides and modified peptides were identified using the SEQUEST algorithm (20Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Yates J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (5385) Google Scholar) and the SEQUEST Browser software (Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA) using the mouse subset of the Uniref100 data base and the search was appropriately modified using differential modifications to account for the selenocysteine residues in the sequence. In addition, lists of theoretical or SEQUEST identified peptides were created, and each peptide was run through P-Mod software to check for possible sequence variance or variable cleavage (21Hansen B.T. Davey S.W. Ham A.-J. Liebler D.C. J. Proteome Res. 2005; 4: 358-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Once the candidate sequence was identified, a targeted analysis was performed in which the peptide mass was selected for MS/MS analysis and fragment ions were selected for MS/MS/MS fragmentation to confirm the identification of the fragment ions. 75Se Labeling of Mice—Sepp1+/+ and Sepp1Δ240–361 mice were injected intraperitoneally with 10 μCi of [75Se]selenite in 0.15 m NaCl. Blood was obtained from the mice 3.5 h after 75Se administration. Plasma was separated by centrifugation and subjected to SDS-PAGE, along with a lane of molecular weight markers. After staining with Coomassie Blue, the gel was dried and exposed to Kodak XAR film. Statistics—Results were analyzed using Student's t test or using analysis of variance with post hoc analysis for statistical differences using Tukey's Multiple Comparison test. Significance was set at p < 0.05. All calculations, including statistical comparison of survival curves, were performed on a Macintosh G5 using GraphPad Prism Ver 4.0b (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Generation of Sepp1 Mutant Mice Expressing Sepp1Δ240–361— Mutant mice were produced in which protein synthesis was expected to terminate at the second UGA of Sepp1. This truncation of Sepp1 was accomplished by insertion of a TAA immediately after the second in-frame TGA (Fig. 1). The deletion was intended to result in a truncated plasma protein containing 239 amino acid residues, only one of which was a selenocysteine. For construction of the deletion mutant targeting vector, a 13-kb SpeI fragment of a mouse genomic P1 DNA clone was used (8Hill K.E. Zhou J. McMahan W.J. Motley A.K. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13640-13646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). A Neo® cassette capable of self-excision when passing through the male germ line of mice was inserted at a BglII site engineered into exon 5, just after the second TGA of the Sepp1 gene. In between this TGA and the BglII site, a true stop codon (TAA) was also introduced to ensure the termination of translation. Presence of Truncated Sepp1 in Plasma and Verification of Its Translation Termination Site—Plasma was collected from Sepp1+/+ and Sepp1Δ240–361 mice that had been injected with a tracer dose of [75Se]selenite. The plasma was subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 2A). The 75Se band in the Sepp1+/+ mouse plasma migrated at 49,000 Da (lane 1), and there was no corresponding band in Sepp1Δ240–361 mouse plasma (lane 3). Rather, a somewhat less intense band migrated at 41,200 Da in lane 3. The predicted peptide masses of Sepp1 and Sepp1Δ240–361 are 40,692 Da and 27,053 Da, respectively. The N-terminal domain of rat Sepp1 is heavily glycosylated (22Ma S. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Caprioli R.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9703-9711Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and the presence of carbohydrate might contribute to the reduced migration of the mouse proteins, leading to an increase in the weight estimates by SDS-PAGE. Excess Sepp1+/+ plasma was applied to lane 2. 75Se is seen to extend downward from the main band in this lane, indicating the presence of 75Se-containing molecules that were smaller than the major one(s). Immunoaffinity purification of Sepp1 from plasma of Sepp1Δ240–361 mice was carried out. Mass spectrometry of trypsin digests of the purified protein yielded a coverage map with the C-terminal amino acid being serine at position 239 (Fig. 2B). The analysis of that peptide at the C terminus of Sepp1Δ240–361 is shown in Fig. 2C. These results verify that the mutant mice have a form of Sepp1 in their plasma that is truncated after the serine residue at position 239. Plasma Selenium Biomarkers in Sepp1Δ240–361 Mice—The two plasma selenoproteins, Sepp1 and glutathione peroxidase, are often used as selenium biomarkers (23Xia Y. Hill K.E. Byrne D.W. Xu J. Burk R.F. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2005; 81: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). These biomarkers were compared in the three groups of mice with different Sepp1 status: Sepp1Δ240–361 mice, Sepp1+/+ mice, and Sepp1–/– mice (Table 1). All mice were selenium replete, having been fed a diet supplemented with 1.0 mg of selenium/kg. Glutathione peroxidase was the only selenium biomarker in the plasma of the Sepp1–/– mice, and its activity in them corresponded to a plasma selenium concentration of 66 μg of selenium/liter (Table 1). Extrapolating to the other groups on the basis of glutathione peroxidase activity, plasma from the Sepp1Δ240–361 mice would contain 80 μg of selenium/liter and plasma from the Sepp1+/+ mice would contain 77 μg of selenium/liter in the form of glutathione peroxidase.TABLE 1Plasma selenium biomarkers in Sepp1Δ240–361, Sepp1–/–, and Sepp1+/+ MiceMiceaMice were fed a diet supplemented with 1 mg of selenium/kg as selenite for 3-7 months from weaning.nSeleniumbValues are means ± S.D.Sepp1bValues are means ± S.D.Glutathione peroxidasebValues are means ± S.D.μg/litermg/literunits/literSepp1+/+6375 ± 16cValues with the same superscript are different from one another, p < 0.001.29 ± 4dValues with the same superscript are different from one another, p < 0.001.348 ± 61Sepp1Δ240-3616178 ± 11cValues with the same superscript are different from one another, p < 0.001.42 ± 3dValues with the same superscript are different from one another, p < 0.001.359 ± 104Sepp1-/-966 ± 14cValues with the same superscript are different from one another, p < 0.001.Not detectable298 ± 74a Mice were fed a diet supplemented with 1 mg of selenium/kg as selenite for 3-7 months from weaning.b Values are means ± S.D.c,d Values with the same superscript are different from one another, p < 0.001. Open table in a new tab The Sepp1 concentration value for Sepp1Δ240–361 mouse plasma was higher than the one for Sepp1+/+ mouse plasma. The immunoassay recognizes predominantly the N terminus of the protein, and thus the results are essentially a molar comparison of Sepp1 and Sepp1Δ240–361. Based on the Sepp1-predicted peptide mass of 40,692 Da, the Sepp1+/+ mice had 0.71 μmol/liter and the Sepp1Δ240–361 mice had 1.03 μmol/liter. In the Sepp1Δ240–361 mice, the protein had one selenium atom per molecule so it should have contributed 82 μg of selenium/liter plasma. When this value is added to the 80 μg of selenium/liter calculated to be in glutathione peroxidase, a total plasma selenium concentration of 162 μg/liter is estimated to be accounted for by the two selenoproteins. This compares favorably with the determined selenium concentration of 178 μg/liter (Table 1) and supports the validity of using this assay to determine the molar concentration of Sepp1Δ240–361. If Sepp1 in the Sepp1+/+ mice had contained the full 10 selenium atoms per molecule, it would have contributed 560 μg of selenium/liter plasma. When the 77 μg of selenium/liter calculated to be in glutathione peroxidase is subtracted from the 375 μg/liter that was determined, only 298 μg of selenium/liter are available for the selenium content of Sepp1. Thus, some of the Sepp1 molecules in Sepp1+/+ mouse plasma must contain fewer than 10 selenium atoms. Based on the above calculations, Sepp1 contains"

In this study, we determined the biochemical characteristics of HpaG, the first harpin identified from a Xanthomonas species, under plant apoplast-like conditions using electron microscopy and circular dichroism spectroscopy. We found that His6-HpaG formed biologically active spherical oligomers, protofibrils, and β-sheet-rich fibrils, whereas the null HR mutant His6-HpaG(L50P) did not. Biochemical analysis and HR assay of various forms of HpaG demonstrated that the transition from an α-helix to β-sheet-rich fibrils is important for the biological activity of protein. The fibrillar form of His6-HpaG is an amyloid protein based on positive staining with Congo red to produce green birefringence under polarized light, increased protease resistance, and β-sheet fibril structure. Other harpins, such as HrpN from Erwinia amylovora and HrpZ from Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, also formed curvilinear protofibrils or fibrils under plant apoplast-like conditions, suggesting that amyloidogenesis is a common feature of harpins. Missense and deletion mutagenesis of HpaG indicated that the rate of HpaG fibril formation is modulated by a motif present in the C terminus. The plant cytotoxicity of HpaG is unique among the amyloid-forming proteins that occur in several microorganisms. Structural and morphological analogies between HpaG and disease-related amyloidogenic proteins, such as Aβ protein, suggest possible common biochemical characteristics in the induction of plant and animal cell death.

In many Gram-negative plant pathogenic bacteria, the hrp (hypersensitive response and pathogenicity) genes, which mostly encode proteins necessary for type III protein secretion systems, are involved in the secretion of harpins (1Kim J.-G. Park B.K. Yoo C.H. Jeon E. Oh J. Hwang I. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3155-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 2Galan J.E. Collmer A.

The HR in plants is an early defense response that restricts the growth of plant pathogens by causing cell death. The plant HR is similar to programmed cell death, or apoptosis, in animal cells, and the biochemical changes that occur during the HR in plant cells have been well documented (5Pennell R.I. Lamb C. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1157-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 6Vila M. Przedborski S. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 7Greenberg J.T.

A. 1996; 93: 12094-12097Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Two categories of HR exist in plants, pathogen-driven and harpin protein-dependent. A typical pathogen-driven HR occurs when a pathogen carrying an avirulence gene enters the intracellular environment of a plant carrying its cognate resistance gene. The second type of HR results from the activity of bacterial harpins outside of plant cells, including those found in Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, Erwinia amylovora, Erwinia chrysanthemi, and Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. glycines (1Kim J.-G.

In Ralstonia solanacearum, a harpin-like protein, PopA, has been shown to induce an HR in nonhost tobacco plants (13Arlat M. Van Gijsegem F. Huet J.C. Pernollet J.C. Boucher C.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Among the harpins, HrpN (3Wei Z.M. Laby R.J. Zumoff C.H. Bauer D.W. He S.Y. Collmer A. Beer S.V. Science. 1992; 257: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), HrpZ (9He S.Y. Huang H.C. Collmer A. Cell. 1993; 73: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), and HrpW (11Kim J.F. Beer S.V. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5203-5210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are well characterized HR elicitors. We previously reported the identification of a harpin, HpaG, which is produced by X. axonopodis pv. glycines 8ra (1Kim J.-G. Park B.K. Yoo C.H. Jeon E. Oh J. Hwang I. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3155-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and we discovered that an hpaG mutant lacking the ability to induce an HR was much less virulent in susceptible soybean cultivars. HpaG induces an HR in various nonhost plants, but it exhibits specificity for those plants; HpaG induces an HR in tobacco and pepper plants but not in tomato or Chinese cabbage (1Kim J.-G. Park B.K. Yoo C.H. Jeon E. Oh J. Hwang I. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3155-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In a previous study (4Kim J.-G. Jeon E. Oh J. Moon J.S. Hwang I. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6239-6247Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we reported that HpaG has two predicted α-helices (motifs 1 and 3) in the N- and C-terminal regions, and that a Gln and Gly repeated sequence (motif 2; QGQGQGQGG) is located between the two α-helices (Fig. 1, A and B). The motif 2 region is homologous to the prion-forming domain (PrD) of a yeast prion protein, Rnq1p (14Resende C.G. Outeiro T.F. Sands L. Lindquist S. Tuite M.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1005-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Using mutagenesis and deletion analysis, we deduced that 23 amino acids in motif 1 are essential for inducing the HR. This was confirmed by showing that a synthetic peptide comprising these 23 amino acids was capable of eliciting an HR, and a single amino acid change at residue 50 from leucine to proline abolished this activity (4Kim J.-G. Jeon E. Oh J. Moon J.S. Hwang I. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6239-6247Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of HR induction by HpaG and other harpins are far from being completely understood. Harpins are believed to act on plant cell walls because a physical interaction of HrpZ with plant cell walls has been observed in P. syringae pv. syringae (15Hoyos M.E. Stanley C.M. He S.Y. Pike S. Pu X.-A. Novacky A. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1996; 9: 608-616Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been demonstrated that HrpZpsph from P. syringae pv. phaseolicola associates with synthetic bilayer membranes and mediates the formation of an ion-conducting pore that is permeable to cations (16Lee J. Klusener B. Tsiamis G. Stevens C. Neyt C. Tampakaki A.P. Panopoulos N.J. Noller J. Weiler E.W. Cornelis G.R. Mansfield J.W. Nurnberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 289-294PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, HrpN from E. amylovora and Pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii was found to depolarize plant cell membranes (17Ahmad M. Majerczak D.R. Pike S. Hoyos M.E. Novacky A. Coplin D.L. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2001; 14: 1223-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18Pike S.M. Adam A.L. Pu X.-A. Hoyos M.E. Laby R. Beer S.V. Novacky A. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1998; 53: 39-60Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and PopA from R. solanacearum has pore-forming activity and integrates into the liposomes and membranes of Xenopus laevis (19Racape J. Belbahri L. Engelhardt S. Lacombe B. Lee J. Lochman J. Marais A. Nicole M. Nurnberger T. Parlange F. Puverel S. Keller H. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 1406-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This unusual membrane permeability is speculated to be the cause of cellular dysfunction and death; however, additional biochemical details about harpins are required to explain how they destabilize membranes to cause HRs. Under physiological conditions, various innocuous and soluble proteins polymerize to form insoluble amyloid fibrils. As amyloid fibrils or fibril precursors, these proteins not only lack their biological activities but may also be harmful to organisms, causing a variety of human neurodegenerative and amyloid-related diseases, such as Alzheimer disease (20Dobson C.M. Nature. 2003; 426: 884-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (3757) Google Scholar, 21Sherman M.Y. Goldberg A.L. Neuron. 2001; 29: 15-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). Although the etiology and pathogenesis of amyloid-related diseases are not fully understood, the drastic structural changes in amyloid proteins that create their unique β-sheet fibrils are the most important events in amyloid disease (22Barrow C.J.

Here, we present a Xanthomonas harpin, HpaG, as an amyloid-forming protein. Based on biochemical analyses of HpaG, we demonstrate that α-helices and amyloidogenesis are key features related to the biological activity of harpins. We also show that HpaG shares common biochemical characteristics with amyloid disease-related proteins responsible for neuronal degeneration and cell death. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—The construction of the plasmids pJ14 (hpaG in pET14b), pHGM76 (hpaG[L50P] in pET14b), and pTHG67 (hpaGΔC66 in pET14b) have been described in previous reports (1Kim J.-G. Park B.K. Yoo C.H. Jeon E. Oh J. Hwang I. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3155-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 4Kim J.-G. Jeon E. Oh J. Moon J.S. Hwang I. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6239-6247Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. Purification of HpaG and Other Harpins—We purified His6-tagged HpaG (His6-HpaG), HpaG derivatives, and other harpins (His6-HrpN, His6-HrpZ, His6-XopA, and His6-XopA(F48L/M52L)) as described previously (1Kim J.-G. Park B.K. Yoo C.H. Jeon E. Oh J. Hwang I. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3155-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We used Superdex-75 HR 10/30 or Superdex-200 HR 10/30 (Amersham Biosciences) to obtain highly purified His6-HpaG. The concentration of the purified protein was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The HpaG and HpaG(L50P) peptides were synthesized as described previously (4Kim J.-G. Jeon E. Oh J. Moon J.S. Hwang I. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6239-6247Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Molecular Weight Estimation—We estimated the molecular weights of purified His6-HpaG and His6-HpaG(L50P) using a Superdex-200 HR 10/30 column with an AKTA explorer FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and the molecular weight of the eluted protein was estimated by a calibration curve prepared using the elution times measured for protein standards (Bio-Rad and Amersham Biosciences) ranging from 1.35 to 670 kDa (thyroglobulin (670 kDa), γ-globulin (158 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B12 (1.35 kDa)). Preparation of XVM2 and Apoplastic Fluid—The hrp induction minimal medium XVM2 (pH 6.7, 20 mm NaCl, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.16 mm KH2PO4, 0.32 mm K2HPO4, 0.01 mm FeSO4, 10 mm fructose, 10 mm sucrose, 0.03% casamino acid) was prepared as described previously (29Wengelnik K. Marie C. Russel M. Bonas U. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Apoplastic fluid was obtained from tobacco leaves using gentle centrifugation as described previously (30Lopez-Millan A.F. Morales F. Abadia A. Abadia J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 873-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 31Lopez-Millan A.F. Morales F. Abadia A. Abadia J. J. Exp. Bot. 2001; 52: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Leaves were excised at the base of the petiole with a razor blade, and the petiole was immersed in deionized water. The leaves were then rolled and placed into a plastic syringe. Leaf-filled syringes were centrifuged at 4 °C. The first centrifugation was performed at a low speed (2,500 × g, 15 min) to remove the xylem sap from the main vein. Apoplastic fluid was obtained after a second centrifugation for 15 min at 4,000 × g and 4 °C. In Vitro Harpin Aggregation—Freshly purified His6-HpaG, HpaG derivatives, and other harpins dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) were filtered through a Millipore Millex-GV 0.22-μm filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and then adjusted to a final concentration of 40 μm. For in vitro harpin aggregation, samples were incubated without agitation in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 10 mm NaCl to mimic the salt concentration in the intercellular space of plant tissues (30Lopez-Millan A.F. Morales F. Abadia A. Abadia J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 873-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 32Schulte R. Bonas U. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) at 27 °C for 14 days. To observe harpin aggregation under plant apoplast-like conditions, we used XVM2 hrp-inducing medium (29Wengelnik K. Marie C. Russel M. Bonas U. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and apoplastic fluid from tobacco leaves. For the XVM2 and apoplastic fluid conditions, proteins at 25 μm were diluted 5-fold (to 5 μm) with XVM2 or apoplastic fluid and then incubated at 27 °C. The final pH of the diluted samples was 7.2. The aggregation state of His6-HpaG and its derivatives under plant apoplast-like conditions was examined immediately after dilution (designated as 0 h) and at time points up to 3 days. Electron Microscopy of HpaG and Other Harpins—Purified His6-HpaG, HpaG derivatives, and other harpins were negatively stained with a 4% uranyl acetate solution on a Formvar carbon-coated grid, and samples were viewed under a transmission electron microscope (JEM 1010; JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV using magnifications of ×40,000–60,000. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy— CD spectra between 190 and 260 nm were measured on a spectropolarimeter (J-715; Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) using quartz cells with a 1-mm path length at 27 °C. A scanning rate of 100 nm/min, a time constant of 1 s, a bandwidth of 1 nm, and a resolution of 0.5 nm were used. The spectra of samples containing 5 μm HpaG and its derivatives or 40 μm HpaG peptides and HpaG(L50P) peptide were recorded. Congo Red (CR) Binding and Birefringence—A 500 μm stock solution of CR (Sigma) was prepared in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and 150 mm NaCl. CR binding or red-shift assay was carried out as described previously (27Chapman M.R. Robinson L.S. Pinkner J.S. Roth R. Heuser J. Hammar M. Normark S. Hultgren S.J. Science. 2002; 295: 851-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar, 33Klunk W.E. Jacob R.F. Mason R.P. Method Enzymol. 1999; 309: 285-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Mixtures of 10 μm CR and 40 μm His6-HpaG fibrils were incubated at room temperature for 30 min before spectral analysis. Absorbance spectra in the region between 300 and 700 nm were recorded for the His6-HpaG fibril-CR mixture, as well as for CR and His6-HpaG. The corrected His6-HpaG fibril-CR spectrum was obtained by subtracting the spectrum of His6-HpaG alone from the His6-HpaG fibril-CR spectrum (uncorrected). For the apple green birefringence test (34Fandrich M. Forge V. Buder K. Kittler M. Dobson C.M. Diekmann S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15463-15468Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), aliquots (7 μl) of an HpaG fibril suspension (40 μm in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 10 mm NaCl) were allowed to dry on a glass slide. The fibrils were stained using a freshly filtered CR solution (0.2% in H2O). Excessive or nonspecific CR staining was removed by washing twice for 1 min with 20% ethanol. Samples were analyzed under a Leica DM RXP light microscope (Leica Microsystems AG, St. Gallen, Switzerland) equipped with a polarizer. Proteinase K Resistance Assay—To assess the resistance of aggregated HpaG to proteinase K, fibrils of His6-HpaG at 40 μm were treated with proteinase K to a final concentration of 14 μg/ml, and the reaction mixtures were brought to 37 °C with agitation. Aliquots were removed at the indicated times and transferred to SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and boiled for 3 min. Samples were run on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Design of Missense Mutations in Motifs 2 and 3—Site-directed mutagenesis of motifs 2 and 3 of HpaG (Fig. 1B) was designed based on the secondary structure of the protein using the HNN secondary structure prediction method (35Barettino D. Feigenbutz M. Valcarcel R. Stunnenberg H.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 541-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and Protean (DNAstar Lasergene software; DNAstar, Inc., Madison, WI). Construction of Missense Mutations in Motifs 2 and 3—Site-directed mutagenesis of hpaG was performed using the PCR-mediated megaprimer method (36Combet C. Blanchet C. Geourjon C. Deleage G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar) to obtain missense mutations in motifs 2 and 3. In the first PCR, pHpaGMT was used as the template DNA with M13–20 and individual mutagenic primers (supplemental Table S2). The PCR conditions and extraction of PCR products from agarose gels were described in a previous report (1Kim J.-G. Park B.K. Yoo C.H. Jeon E. Oh J. Hwang I. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3155-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the second PCR, pJ14 DNA was used as the template, whereas the T7 promoter primer and the mega-primers of the gel elution product from the first PCR were used as primers. The reaction conditions were the same as in the first PCR. The products were purified by phenol and chloroform extraction, and the DNA was precipitated with ethanol. After digestion with NdeI and BamHI, the PCR products were fused to the corresponding sites in the pET14b vector to generate pG1, pG2, and pC1 (supplemental Table S1). To produce pG3, the T7 promoter primer and the megaprimer used to construct pG1 were employed as primers, and pG2 was used as the DNA template for PCR. For pC2 construction, mutagenic primer HpaGc2 was used in the first PCR, and pC1 was employed as template DNA for the second PCR. Plant Assays—To test for the HR, tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Samsun NN) were injected with various concentrations of His6-HpaG and HpaG derivatives obtained at various times. Plant responses were observed 12–24 h after injection. HpaG Forms Biologically Active Spherical Oligomers—To determine the biochemical characteristics of HpaG, we purified soluble His6-HpaG (15.6 kDa). Freshly purified His6-HpaG separated by size exclusion chromatography showed one major peak at 58.9 kDa, corresponding to a tetramer (Fig. 2A); however, the null HR mutant, His6-HpaG(L50P), was purified as a monomer (Fig. 2A). Freshly purified His6-HpaG exhibited bead- and annular-like spherical forms similar to the spherical oligomers (amylospheroid) of Aβ protein under EM (Fig. 2B). These forms of HpaG induced an HR, whereas His6-HpaG(L50P) did not form bead-like oligomers and failed to induce an HR (Fig. 2, C and D). Fibril Formation by HpaG—Because purified His6-HpaG formed a clear gel after 10 days at 27 °C, we observed the process of fibril formation by His6-HpaG daily for 10 days in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 10 mm NaCl at 27 °C under EM. The fibrillization of 40 μm His6-HpaG proceeded via spherical oligomers and protofibrillar intermediates after 0–8 days of incubation, and curvilinear and partially elongated protofibrils of various sizes were detected after 4–8 days of incubation (Fig. 3A). Mature His6-HpaG fibrils were detected after 10 days and appeared as 5–7-nm-wide fibers of various lengths (Fig. 3A). To study HpaG aggregation under plant apoplast-like conditions, we examined fibril formation in XVM2 and apoplastic fluid. Initially, the concentration of the proteins was lowered to 5 μm, which was the minimum concentration for CD spectroscopic analysis; however, at 5 μm, CD spectroscopy of the HpaG peptide was impossible. Therefore, we increased the concentration of the HpaG peptide to 40 μm for CD spectroscopic analysis. In XVM2, the formation of His6-HpaG fibrils was faster than in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 10 mm NaCl (Fig. 3, A and B). Partially elongated fibrils of His6-HpaG were detected within 1 day of incubation, and mature fibrils were detected after 3 days of incubation (Fig. 3B), whereas curvilinear forms were detected at 0 h. In apoplastic fluid, His6-HpaG formed insoluble precipitates; however, curvilinear forms and fibrils were detected within 1 day of incubation in the soluble fraction (Fig. 3C). In the case of His6-HpaGΔC66, curvilinear and fibrillar forms were observed at 0 h and mature fibrils were detected within 12 h of incubation in XVM2 (Fig. 3D). When the HR inducing activity of the protofibrils and fibrillar forms of His6-HpaG and His6-HpaGΔC66 was measured at various protein concentrations, both forms were capable of inducing an HR (Fig. 3, A, B, and D). In contrast, the null HR mutant His6-HpaG(L50P) did not form mature fibrils (Fig. 3E) and failed to induce an HR (Fig. 3E). These results suggest that the formation of HpaG fibrils under plant apoplast-like conditions is closely related to the HR inducing activity of the protein. HpaG Forms β-Sheet-rich Fibrils—To determine the transition in the secondary structure of HpaG during oligomerization, we used CD spectroscopic analysis. At 10 h, freshly prepared solutions of 5 μm His6-HpaG in XVM2 generated a CD spectrum with minima at 208 and 222 nm, characteristic of a primarily α-helical protein, but the amplitude of positive band in 195 nm was reduced by approximately one-third compared with that for 5 μm His6-HpaG in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 10 mm NaCl (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. S1). This might have been due to the high absorbance of inorganic salts and other components present in XVM2 at 195 nm. After 3 days, the CD spectrum of HpaG changed to a minimum at 220 nm, which is indicative of transition to a β-sheet (217 ± 5 nm) (Fig. 4A). The CD spectrum of His6-HpaGΔC66 indicated an α-helix at 0 h, but a β-sheet-rich conformation was observed after 12 h at 27 °C (Fig. 4B), which is consistent with the mature fibrils detected by EM after a 12-h incubation (Fig. 3D). Mature fibril formation and transition to a β-sheet from an α-helix by His6-HpaGΔC66 was much faster than by His6-HpaG. A CD spectrum of His6-HpaG(L50P) suggested a randomly coiled structure, confirming that the N-terminal α-helical structure is important for HR eliciting activity (Fig. 4A). This was further corroborated by the CD spectra of HpaG peptide (H2N-NQGISEKQLDQLLTQLIMALLQQ-COOH) and HpaG(L50P) peptide (H2N-NQGISEKQLDQLLTQLIMAPLQQ-COOH). HpaG peptide showed a typical α-helical structure, whereas HpaG(L50P) peptide showed a randomly coiled structure (Fig. 5A). The observation of partially elongated fibrils of the HpaG peptide and the loss of HR inducing activity and fibril-forming ability of the HpaG(L50P) peptide (Fig. 5B) indicate that the N-terminal α-helix motif of HpaG is critical for fibril formation and harpin function.FIGURE 5CD spectra and EM analyses of HpaG peptide and HpaG(L50P) peptide. A, CD spectra of freshly prepared 40 μm HpaG peptide and HpaG(L50P) peptide in XVM2. B, protofibrils (curvilinear) and bundles of HpaG peptide fibrils were detected within 1 day of incubation (upper panels) at 27 °C, whereas HpaG(L50P) peptide did not form protofibrils or fibrillar structures during the same period (lower panels) at 27 °C. Time point 0 h is defined as the moment immediately following dilution of the proteins in XVM2 (scale bars = 200 nm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) HpaG Is an Amyloid Protein—To determine whether the fibrillar form of HpaG is amyloid, we performed a binding assay with CR. Like other amyloid proteins, His6-HpaG fibrils retained the ability to bind CR, causing a red shift in the spectrum with a maximum difference in absorbance between CR alone and CR bound to His6-HpaG fibrils at ∼541 nm (Fig. 6A). Polarized microscopic analysis showed that CR-stained His6-HpaG aggregates exhibited green-yellow birefringence (Fig. 6B). Fibrils of His6-HpaG were also relatively resistant to protease compared with soluble His6-HpaG (Fig. 6C), which is characteristic of the fibrillar Aβ protein and other disease-associated fibril-forming proteins. Fibril Formation Rate Is Modulated by Motif 3—To determine whether motif 2 or 3 influences HpaG fibril formation, we used site-directed mutagenesis to generate missense mutations in motif 2 (HpaG-C1 and HpaG-C2) and motif 3 (HpaG(L93P), HpaG(L101P), and HpaG(L93P/L101P)) (Fig. 1B). The HR inducing activity of these mutants was the same as that of wild-type HpaG (Fig. 1B); however, those proteins with missense mutations in motif 3 showed more rapid fibril f"
https://openalex.org/W2072156470,"The catabolic pathways of branched-chain amino acids have two common steps. The first step is deamination catalyzed by the vitamin B<sub>6</sub>-dependent branched-chain aminotransferase isozymes (BCATs) to produce branched-chain α-keto acids (BCKAs). The second step is oxidative decarboxylation of the BCKAs mediated by the branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase enzyme complex (BCKD complex). The BCKD complex is organized around a cubic core consisting of 24 lipoate-bearing dihydrolipoyl transacylase (E2) subunits, associated with the branched-chain α-keto acid decarboxylase/dehydrogenase (E1), dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3), BCKD kinase, and BCKD phosphatase. In this study, we provide evidence that human mitochondrial BCAT (hBCATm) associates with the E1 decarboxylase component of the rat or human BCKD complex with a <i>K<sub>D</sub></i> of 2.8 μm. NADH dissociates the complex. The E2 and E3 components do not interact with hBCATm. In the presence of hBCATm, <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> values for E1-catalyzed decarboxylation of the BCKAs are enhanced 12-fold. Mutations of hBCATm proteins in the catalytically important C<i>XX</i>C center or E1 proteins in the phosphorylation loop residues prevent complex formation, indicating that these regions are important for the interaction between hBCATm and E1. Our results provide evidence for substrate channeling between hBCATm and BCKD complex and formation of a metabolic unit (termed branched-chain amino acid metabolon) that can be influenced by the redox state in mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2063865760,"DNA replication, as with all macromolecular synthesis steps, is controlled in part at the level of initiation. Although the origin recognition complex (ORC) binds to origins of DNA replication, it does not solely determine their location. To initiate DNA replication ORC requires Cdc6 to target initiation to specific DNA sequences in chromosomes and with Cdt1 loads the ring-shaped mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) 2–7 DNA helicase component onto DNA. ORC and Cdc6 combine to form a ring-shaped complex that contains six AAA+ subunits. ORC and Cdc6 ATPase mutants are defective in MCM loading, and ORC ATPase mutants have reduced activity in ORC·Cdc6·DNA complex formation. Here we analyzed the role of the Cdc6 ATPase on ORC·Cdc6 complex stability in the presence or absence of specific DNA sequences. Cdc6 ATPase is activated by ORC, regulates ORC·Cdc6 complex stability, and is suppressed by origin DNA. Mutations in the conserved origin A element, and to a lesser extent mutations in the B1 and B2 elements, induce Cdc6 ATPase activity and prevent stable ORC·Cdc6 formation. By analyzing ORC·Cdc6 complex stability on various DNAs, we demonstrated that specific DNA sequences control the rate of Cdc6 ATPase, which in turn controls the rate of Cdc6 dissociation from the ORC·Cdc6·DNA complex. We propose a mechanism explaining how Cdc6 ATPase activity promotes origin DNA sequence specificity; on DNA that lacks origin activity, Cdc6 ATPase promotes dissociation of Cdc6, whereas origin DNA down-regulates Cdc6 ATPase resulting in a stable ORC·Cdc6·DNA complex, which can then promote MCM loading. This model has relevance for origin specificity in higher eukaryotes. DNA replication, as with all macromolecular synthesis steps, is controlled in part at the level of initiation.

This model has relevance for origin specificity in higher eukaryotes. Jacob and Brenner (1Jacob F. Brenner S. C. R. Hebd. Seances Acad. Sci. 1963; 256: 298-300PubMed Google Scholar) described the replicon model in 1963 that outlined in general terms how DNA replication might start at a specific location within chromosomes. This model formed the basis for discovery of initiator proteins that recognize origins of DNA replication. The bacterial initiator, DnaA (2Fuller R.S. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5817-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), recognizes the bacterial origin of DNA replication, oriC, by binding to multiple 9-mer DnaA boxes within the origin (3Fuller R.S. Funnell B.E. Kornberg A. Cell. 1984; 38: 889-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). However, DnaA also binds frequently to DnaA boxes outside of DNA replication origins, and these sites do not promote initiation of DNA replication (4Roth A. Messer W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar); therefore, the origin is defined by a combination of specific protein-DNA interactions, including DnaA, histone-like protein HU, and integration host factor proteins and an arrangement of DNA sequences that form multiple binding sites in a specific conformation (5Messer W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 355-374PubMed Google Scholar). It is only this particular conformation that allows the initiator to promote origin unwinding, to recruit other DNA replication proteins such as the DnaB helicase and helicase loading protein DnaC to the DNA, and consequently to initiate DNA synthesis (5Messer W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 355-374PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism that specifies the location of origins of DNA replication in eukaryotic chromosomes is less clear particularly in mammalian cells, but it involves a combination of sequence specific protein-DNA interactions, epigenetic factors, and cell cycle timing (6Aladjem M.I. Fanning E. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 7Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, specific DNA sequences are known to contribute the location of origins of DNA replication in chromosomes (8Diffley J.F. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2819-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 9MacAlpine D.M. Bell S.P. Chromosome Res. 2005; 13: 309-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 10Xu W. Aparicio J.G. Aparicio O.M. Tavare S. BMC Genomics. 2006; 7: 276Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Knowledge of such sequences led to the discovery of the origin recognition complex (ORC) 3The abbreviations used are: ORC, origin recognition complex; MCM, mini-chromosome maintenance protein; pre-RC, pre-replicative complexes; ARS, autonomously replicating sequence; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate).3The abbreviations used are: ORC, origin recognition complex; MCM, mini-chromosome maintenance protein; pre-RC, pre-replicative complexes; ARS, autonomously replicating sequence; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). (11Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar), a six-subunit complex. Homologues of ORC exist in all eukaryotic species. Yeast origins contain several conserved genetic elements (12Marahrens Y. Stillman B. Science. 1992; 255: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar); the A element, which serves as a binding site for ORC (11Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar), the B1 element, which is partially involved in ORC binding (13Rao H. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2224-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 14Rowley A. Cocker J.H. Harwood J. Diffley J.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2631-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and the B2 element as a potential binding site for loading the mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins (15Wilmes G.M. Bell S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 16Zou L. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3086-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). ORC in higher eukaryotes does not bind specifically to DNA but has a preference for AT-rich (17Giordano-Coltart J. Ying C.Y. Gautier J. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 18Vashee S. Cvetic C. Lu W. Simancek P. Kelly T.J. Walter J.C. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1894-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) or supercoiled DNA (19Remus D. Beall E.L. Botchan M.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Our understanding of how DNA sequences or locations within the chromosome are selected as sites of initiation of DNA replication is still poor since it is unclear what defines a start site for initiation of DNA replication. S. cerevisiae ORC binds to origins in a DNA sequence-specific fashion; however, this feature is not conserved in higher eukaryotes. But because the protein components required for initiation of DNA replication are conserved, it is expected that studies of how this process occurs in yeast will shed light on the process in all eukaryotes. In budding yeast it has been shown that the Orc1 subunit in ORC has to be in the ATP-bound form for ORC to bind DNA (11Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar, 20Klemm R.D. Austin R.J. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 493-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Orc1-dependent ATPase, stimulated by an arginine residue in an adjacent Orc4 subunit, is also regulated in a DNA sequence-specific manner (20Klemm R.D. Austin R.J. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 493-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), but this ATPase activity has no influence on the selection of DNA sequences as origins of DNA replication (21Bowers J.L. Randell J.C. Chen S. Bell S.P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 967-978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Although ATP-bound ORC can bind to origins of DNA replication specifically, its affinity cannot explain why some DNA sequences are selected as origins and others are not, e.g. ORC binding sites have been identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis that do not act as replication sites (10Xu W. Aparicio J.G. Aparicio O.M. Tavare S. BMC Genomics. 2006; 7: 276Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Another protein involved in the sequential assembly of pre-replicative complexes (pre-RCs) at origins of DNA replication is the Cdc6 protein (cdc18 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe) (22Cocker J.H. Piatti S. Santocanale C. Nasmyth K. Diffley J.F. Nature. 1996; 379: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 23Kelly T.J. Martin G.S. Forsburg S.L. Stephen R.J. Russo A. Nurse P.

Brown G.W. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1566-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Cdc6 is a member of the AAA+ family of proteins and has striking amino acid sequence similarity with Orc1, the largest subunit of ORC (28Bell S.P. Mitchell J. Leber J. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Cell. 1995; 83: 563-568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 29Muzi-Falconi M. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12475-12479Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Together with ORC and Cdt1, Cdc6 is required for loading the MCM proteins onto origin DNA (30Donovan S. Harwood J. Drury L.S.

Williams G.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7219-7229Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Cdc6 binds to and changes the structure of ORC, and together they bind cooperatively to origin DNA with higher DNA sequence specificity than ORC binding alone (37Mizushima T. Takahashi N. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1631-1641PubMed Google Scholar, 38Speck C. Chen Z. Li H. Stillman B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Specific nucleotides within the origin DNA are required for ORC·Cdc6·DNA complex formation, and Orc1 ATPase mutants are less efficient in forming the ORC·Cdc6·DNA complex (38Speck C. Chen Z. Li H. Stillman B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We were interested in understanding how Cdc6 contributes to the selection of certain DNA sequences in chromosomes of yeast to function as origins of DNA replication, a process with potential relevance to origin selection in higher eukaryotes. Because Cdc6 is also an AAA+ protein, like Orc1–5 (38Speck C. Chen Z. Li H. Stillman B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 39Clarey M.G.

Biomol. Struct. 2006; 35: 93-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), we analyzed the contribution of Cdc6 ATPase activity to ORC·Cdc6 and ORC·Cdc6·DNA complex assembly and its impact on the selection of DNA sequences as origins of DNA replication. Proteins—ORC expressed in insect cells from recombinant baculoviruses and Cdc6 expressed in Escherichia coli were purified to apparent homogeneity as described (11Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar, 20Klemm R.D. Austin R.J. Bell S.P.

Cell. 1997; 88: 493-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. 2.5 pmol of ORC and 2.5 pmol of Cdc6 were incubated for 30 min on ice in 12 μl of ATPase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm potassium glutamate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) containing 2.5 pmol of DNA (when indicated) and 100 μm ATP (unless otherwise indicated). After the incubation 5 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was added and the reaction was started by moving the tubes from ice into a room temperature water bath. At 15, 30, 45, and 60 min 2-μl aliquots were removed and stopped with 0.5 μl of 2% SDS stop solution. 1 μl of the samples were consequently spotted on TLC plates and developed. DNA Probes—DNA probes and competitor DNA (290 bp of GC-rich DNA) used in the gel shift and/or footprinting experiments were prepared as described (12Marahrens Y. Stillman B. Science. 1992; 255: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 38Speck C. Chen Z. Li H. Stillman B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). For the ATPase experiments a 91-bp fragment (residue 790–880) was amplified from plasmid pARS1WT or from the various mutant pARS1 plasmids (in the case of the A–, B1–, B2– fragment, an oligo (B1–) primer, and a A–, B2-template DNA was used). For ARS607 and ARS607A–, a 91-bp fragment was amplified from pARS607 with primer ARS 607 forward 91 bp (5′-CTTACGCTGGGTATTTTTTTTTTGG-3′) and primer ARS607 reverse 91 bp (5′-GAGCTTTGTCTTGTTTATATTTAGTTACG-3′). For ARS607A– a modified primer was used to create a linker scanning mutation as in pARS1 A– using primer ARS 607 A-REV 91 bp (5′-GAGCTTTGTCTTGTCCTCGAGGAGTTACGTTGGG-3′). Glycerol Gradients, Footprints, and Gel Shifts—Experiments were performed as described (38Speck C. Chen Z. Li H. Stillman B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Determination of Dissociation Constants—Dissociation constants were determined using a gel shift assay. Gel shift reactions were performed as described previously (38Speck C. Chen Z. Li H. Stillman B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) in the absence of competitor DNA. After challenging the complex with 100-fold cold competitor DNA (ARS1 291 bp) aliquots were loaded onto a continuously running gel in the cold room at the indicated time points. koff, R values, and t½ rates were determined using KaleidaGraph 4.0 (Synergy software). All experiments were repeated at least twice with similar results. Cdc6 ATPase Is Induced by ORC·Cdc6 Complex Formation—ORC and Cdc6 have been shown to form a stable complex in the presence of a slowly hydrolysable ATP analogue, ATPγS, but not in the presence of ATP (38Speck C. Chen Z. Li H. Stillman B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that ATP hydrolysis regulates complex stability. To address this question in more detail we analyzed ATPase activities and complex formation of ORC and Cdc6 (Fig. 1). Cdc6 on its own had no ATPase activity as reported (31Randell J.C. Bowers J.L. Rodriguez H.K. Bell S.P. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 41Elsasser S. Lou F. Wang B. Campbell J.L. Jong A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1723-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The ORC ATPase activity was similar to what has been reported (20Klemm R.D. Austin R.J. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 493-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In contrast to a recent study (31Randell J.C. Bowers J.L. Rodriguez H.K. Bell S.P. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) that used different salt conditions, we found very robust ATPase activity when Cdc6 was added to ORC, a 2.5-fold induction over the ATPase activity of ORC alone. This result suggests that ORC and Cdc6 form at least a transient complex in the absence of DNA that induces either ORC or Cdc6 ATPase activity. To identify the active ATPases in the ORC·Cdc6 complex we analyzed two Cdc6 ATPase mutants (Cdc6 E224G and Cdc6 N263A) and an ORC ATP hydrolysis mutant (ORC4R/5A) in ATPase assays. Cdc6 E224G has a mutation in the highly conserved Walker B motif (31Randell J.C. Bowers J.L. Rodriguez H.K. Bell S.P. Mol.

Cdc6 belongs to the class of AAA+ proteins, and mutations in Walker B or sensor 1 motifs frequently interfere with the ability of AAA+ proteins to hydrolyze ATP (40Erzberger J.P. Berger J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2006; 35: 93-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The two Cdc6 mutants individually displayed no ATPase activity, similar to wild type Cdc6 (Fig. 1A). The addition of Cdc6 N263A to ORC did not change the ATPase activity, in contrast to wild type Cdc6. Cdc6 E224G addition to ORC led to a reduction of overall ATPase activity. These results suggest that Cdc6 is a major ATPase within the ORC·Cdc6 complex. To analyze the contribution of ORC toward ATPase activity of the ORC·Cdc6 complex, we analyzed an ORC4R/5A double mutant (Fig. 1B). Mutations in the arginine finger of ORC4 (ORC4R) have been shown to abolish Orc1-dependent ATPase (21Bowers J.L. Randell J.C. Chen S. Bell S.P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 967-978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). ORC5A carries a mutation in the Walker A motif of Orc5 that blocks ATP binding to ORC5; however, this mutation has no significant phenotype in vitro and in vivo (20Klemm R.D. Austin R.J. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 493-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 44Takahashi N. Yamaguchi Y. Yamairi F. Makise M. Takenaka H. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. J. Biol.

Cell. 1995; 6: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We measured ATPase of the combined ORC4R/5A mutant in the absence and presence of Cdc6 (Fig. 1B). ORC4R/5A showed a very weak ATPase that was dependent on high but physiological relevant ATP concentrations (up to 1 mm). The addition of Cdc6 to the ORC4R/5A mutant lead to a significant increase in ATPase activity, and this was dependent on high ATP concentrations as well. High ATP concentrations, however, had no effect on the ORC·Cdc6-induced ATPase (data not shown). These results show that ORC4R/5A can stimulate Cdc6 ATPase. Taken together, the ORC and Cdc6 ATPase data suggest that both ORC and Cdc6 are active ATPases in the ORC·Cdc6 complex since ATPase mutants in both ORC and Cdc6 did not abolish ATPase activity completely. Cdc6 ATPase Regulates ORC·Cdc6 Stability—Using glycerol gradient sedimentation, we have shown that in the presence of ATP, ORC and Cdc6 did not form a stable complex, whereas in the presence of the non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue, ATPγS, a stable ORC·Cdc6 complex was observed (38Speck C. Chen Z. Li H. Stillman B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This suggests that ATPase activity controls the stability of the ORC·Cdc6 complex in the absence of DNA. The ORC mutants ORC-4R, an Orc1-dependent ATP hydrolysis mutant (21Bowers J.L. Randell J.C. Chen S. Bell S.P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 967-978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and ORC-1A, an Orc1 ATP binding mutant (20Klemm R.D. Austin R.J. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 493-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), did not form a stable ORC·Cdc6 complex in the presence of ATP (38Speck C. Chen Z. Li H. Stillman B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These results indicate that ORC ATPase in the ORC·Cdc6 complex does not regulate ORC·Cdc6 complex stability, suggesting that it is the Cdc6 ATPase that is responsible. This possibility was examined by analyzing Cdc6 ATPase mutants for their ability to form a stable complex with ORC (Fig. 1, C and D). Cdc6 E224G and Cdc6 N263A were fractionated either individually or together with ORC in the presence of ADP, ATP, or ATPγS by glycerol gradient sedimentation (Fig. 1C). Cdc6 E224G and Cdc6 N263A individually fractionated as monomers. The Cdc6 ATPase mutants co-fractionated with ORC in the presence of ATP and ATPγS, as seen by the disappearance of monomeric Cdc6 and concomitant appearance of Cdc6 in the peak fraction containing ORC, which was verified by Western blot with anti-Cdc6 antibodies (Fig. 1D). In the absence of ORC, Cdc6 E224G and N263A were not found in the fraction corresponding to the ORC·Cdc6 (Fig. 1D). Previously we have shown that in the presence of ADP, ORC and Cdc6 do not form a complex (38Speck C. Chen Z. Li H. Stillman B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This is also true for Cdc6 E224G; however, Cdc6 N263A formed a weak complex with ORC in the presence of ADP, probably due to inefficient exchange of ATP for ADP. The results so far show that Cdc6E224G and Cdc6N263A were capable of forming a stable complex with ORC in the presence of ATP, which was not true for wild type Cdc6 protein. The results suggest that, in the absence of DNA, the Cdc6 ATPase negatively regulates ORC·Cdc6 complex stability. Because Orc1 and Orc5 ATP binding or ATPase activity have no influence on ORC·Cdc6 complex stability (38Speck C. Chen Z. Li H. Stillman B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), it is the Cdc6 ATPase within the ORC·Cdc6 complex that regulates complex stability. DNA Sequence-dependent ATPase Induction in the ORC·Cdc6·DNA Complex—Because the ORC·Cdc6 complex is assembled on DNA, we were interested in determining how DNA modulates the ATPase activity in the complex. In performing these experiments, wild type and mutant versions of origin DNAs were used as well as nonspecific natural DNAs that do not function as an origin in yeast. Thus, the relationship between origin binding and ATPase activity could be assessed. The ATPase of ORC, ORC4R/5A, Cdc6, and the two Cdc6 ATP hydrolysis mutants (Cdc6 E224G and Cdc6 N263A) were analyzed in the absence and presence of GC-rich non-origin DNA, ARS1 origin DNA (containing the A, B1, and B2 elements), and mutant ARS1 A– or A–B1–B2– DNA (Fig. 2). Note that both the A and B2 elements are ORC binding sites; B2 is only used as an ORC binding site in the absence of a functional A element (11Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar, 38Speck C. Chen Z. Li H. Stillman B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Cdc6 had no ATPase in the absence or presence of DNA (Fig. 2A, lanes 1, 4, 7, 10, and 13). In the absence of DNA, ORC is an ATPase (lane 2), and the addition of Cdc6 to ORC led to a 2.5-fold increase in ATPase compared with ORC alone (Fig. 2A, lane 3). GC-rich DNA and ARS1 A–B1–B2–, which do not support initiation of DNA replication, ORC·DNA, and ORC·Cdc6·DNA complex formation (38Speck C. Chen Z. Li H. Stillman B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), did not suppress ORC ATPase activity (Fig. 2A, compare lane 2 with lanes 5 and 14). Rather, they induced ORC·Cdc6 ATPase activity 5-fold stronger than the ATPase in the presence of ORC alone (Fig. 2A, compare lane 2 with lanes 6 and 15). This result suggests that transient binding of ORC and Cdc6 to GC-rich DNA activates the ATPase in either ORC or Cdc6. ARS1 origin DNA suppressed ORC ATPase by 8–10-fold (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 8) as reported (20Klemm R.D. Austin R.J. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 493-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). ARS1 DNA also promoted stable complex formation of the ORC·Cdc6·ARS1 complex (38Speck C. Chen Z. Li H. Stillman B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The addition of ARS1 DNA to reactions containing ORC and Cdc6 suppressed the ATPase activity of ORC·Cdc6 about 5-fold compared with the ATPase activity in the absence of DNA (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 3 and 9). An ARS1 A– mutant, which supports weak binding of ORC but does not support ORC·Cdc6 complex formation on DNA (38Speck C. Chen Z. Li H. Stillman B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), suppressed ORC ATPase activity likely due to the weaker, non-perfect ORC binding site within the B2 element (Fig. 2A, compare lane 2 with lane 11). Interestingly, the ARS1 A– mutant did not suppress ORC·Cdc6 ATPase but resulted in a similar ATPase as the ORC·Cdc6 complex in the absence of DNA (Fig. 2A, compare lane 3 with lane 12). This result suggests that ORC can bind to the ARS1 A– via the weak ORC binding site within the B2 element but that addition of Cdc6 triggers ATPase activity that disrupts the ORC·Cdc6 binding to the ARS1 A– DNA. These data indicate that ORC·Cdc6 complex formation on DNA is regulated by ATPase activity and that the ORC and the ORC·Cdc6 complexes differ in the way they respond to non-origin DNA sequences, as exemplified by the striking differences between ARS1 and ARS1 A– DNA. Cdc6 Is the Active ATPase in the ORC·Cdc6·DNA Complex—Next we were interested in identifying the DNA-regulated ATPase within the ORC·Cdc6·DNA complex. We, therefore, analyzed mutant versions of these proteins, including ORC4R/5A and Cdc6 E224G and N263A for their ability to regulate ORC·Cdc6 ATPase activity. ORC4R/5A, a very weak ATPase, was reproducibly suppressed by ARS1 DNA but not by GC-rich DNA or ARS1 A–B1–B2– (Fig. 2B, lanes 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14). The addition of Cdc6 to ORC4A/5A resulted in stronger ATPase in the presence and absence of DNA, similar to the case of ORC and Cdc6, indicating that ORC ATPase is not the major ATPase within the ORC·Cdc6·DNA complex (Fig. 2B, lanes 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15). Interestingly, based on the Cdc6·activated ATPase, this mutant complex was still able to distinguish between DNAs that acted as an origin and DNAs that did not. The two Cdc6 mutants, Cdc6 E224G (31Randell J.C. Bowers J.L. Rodriguez H.K. Bell S.P. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and N263A, did not increase the ATPase when compared with ORC alone in the absence or presence of any DNA (Fig. 2, C and D). Interestingly, the dominant negative Cdc6 E224G mutant resulted in reducing the ATPase of ORC in solution or in complex with non-origin GC-rich or ARS1 A– and A–B1–B2– DNA (Fig. 2D).

Bertram L. Cell. 2005; 120: 545-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms causing sporadic and familial (FAD) forms of AD are not yet known, and the physiological functions of APP and PSs are also unclear. APP is a type 1 transmembrane protein whose proteolytic processing generates long soluble N-terminal fragments, a family of short soluble amyloid-β peptides (Aβ) (2Glenner G.G. Wong C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4114) Google Scholar, 3Golde T.E. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and a second intracellular C-terminal fragment named AICD from “APP intracellular domain,” which is likely involved in gene regulation (4Gao Y.

Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Aβ peptides, as water-soluble oligomers or insoluble aggregates, are toxic species suspected to cause neurodegeneration and synaptic loss that, together with reactive gliosis and intracellular tangles of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein, represent the classical neuropathological hallmarks of the disease (6Selkoe D.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1054-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). PSs are multitransmembrane proteins, which may accumulate as endoproteolyzed heterodimers of N- and C-terminal fragments associated with other membrane proteins (i.e. nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2) to form high molecular weight complexes (7De Strooper B.

The hypothesized role of PSs mutations in the genesis of FAD is apparently linked to the enhanced APP cleavage and formation of Aβ-(x-42) isoforms, increasing the activity of the multiproteic γ-secretase complex (6Selkoe D.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1054-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). If we consider that there is a significant phenotypical heterogeneity among patients, and even among familial patients bearing the same genetic mutation, it seems likely that other proteins modulate APP and PS functions. In fact, APP and PSs are in the center of a network of protein-protein interactions whose significance for the regulation of Aβ formation and generally for AD development is under extensive investigation (13McCarthy J.V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In addition to their proteolytic roles culminating in Aβ production, PSs have been shown to interact with various proteins involved in the regulation of γ-secretase activity, cell survival, development, and signaling. In particular, PSs are implicated in Notch and Wnt signaling, cell-cell adhesion, vesicular transport, apoptosis, calcium signaling, phosphorylation and degradation of β-catenin, modulation of ERK1,2, and phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase activity (13McCarthy J.V.

On the other side, the APP C-terminal domain is recognized by a plethora of adaptors and signaling molecules, the role of which for AD development is still unclear (18da Cruz e Silva E.F. da Cruz e Silva O.A.

Besides its involvement in signal transduction pathways mediated by tyrosine kinase receptors, GRB2 may also anchor to a number of proteins involved in cell signaling and vesicular trafficking, such as dynamin and synapsin (23McPherson P.S.

GRB2 is composed of a central SH2 domain flanked by two SH3 domains and interacts through its SH2 domain with the C-terminal 682YENPTY687 motif of APP upon the specific phosphorylation of Tyr-682 (numbering on APP695 isoform) (28Pawson T.

Chem. 2004; 279: 25374-25380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). At present, it is unclear whether APP may have a role in some of the cell activities in which GRB2 participates or whether GRB2 modulates or affects APP function or even amyloid formation. Here we provide evidence that GRB2 interacts with APP and PS1 in vesicular structures dispersed in the cytosol and mainly in the pericentriolar material at the centrosome, a crucial region for microtubule nucleation, cell cycle progression, migration, cytokinesis, and cellularization (30Doxsey S. Zimmerman W. Mikule K. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 303-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). We also provide evidence that APP and PS1 modulates the centrosomal translocation or phosphorylation of ERK1,2 during mitosis and that the activation of ERK1,2 depends on phosphorylation of tyrosine 682 of APP and on APP cleavage. These findings therefore raise the possibility that perturbations in MEK/ERK signaling may constitute a common metabolic pathway modulated by both gene products that cause familial AD. Recombinant Constructs—APP695 wild type, APPY653F, APPY682A, Y687A, and Y682A/Y687A mutants have been described previously (31Zambrano N. Bruni P. Minopoli G. Mosca R. Molino D. Russo C. Schettini G.

The human APP695 cloned into the pRc/CMV vector (Invitrogen), as described previously, was the template for mutagenesis reaction (QuikChange ® mutagenesis kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A set of primers, 5′-GAGCAGATGCAACCGGTCCCCCGCCACAGC-3′ sense and 5′-GCTCAAGAACTTGGCGGTTGGATTTTCG-3′ antisense, were designed to add the AgeI site and remove the stop codon to the 3′ end of APP.

Human PS1 DNA was cloned into the HindIII, XhoI site of the expression vector pcDNA3.1-V5 (Invitrogen). The PS1 mutants H163R and L286V were prepared by mutagenesis reaction (Stratagene) using pcDNA3.1-PS1-V5 (Invitrogen) as template and the following specific primers: H163R sense 5′-GGTGCTATAAGGTCATCgtTGCCTGGCTTATTA-3′ and H163R antisense 5′-TAATAAGCCAGGCAacGATGACCTTATAGCACC-3′; L286V sense 5′-CGCTTTTTCCAGCTgTCATTTACTCCTCAAC-3′ and L286V antisense 5′-GTTGAGGAGTAAATGAcAGCTGGAAAAAGCG-3′.

Human GRB2 gene was cloned into the BamHI/XbaI site of the expression vector pcDNA3.1-V5/Hist (Invitrogen) to obtain the histidine tag. To get a fusion protein between GRB2 and glutathione S-transferase (GRB2-GST), the human GRB2 cDNA was cloned into the EcoRI/AgeI site of the expression vector pGEX-4T-2 (GE Healthcare). siRNAs corresponding to β-secretase BACE1 was done as described previously (32Kao S.C. Krichevsky A.M. Kosik K.S. Tsai L.H. J. Biol.

Results obtained from siRNA2 are shown. RT-PCR was done in H4 wild type cells and H4-BACE1 transfected cells grown to confluence, and total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Two micrograms of total RNA were subjected to reverse transcriptase (RT) first strand synthesis using the Superscript kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Equal amounts of the RT product were then used for PCR of BACE1 or BACE2 using specific primers.

Cell Cultures—H4 cells and H4 cells stably expressing BACE1 with a C-terminal FLAG tag were kindly provided by Prof. Roger M. Nitsch (University of Zurich) and maintained in the presence of 500 μg/ml G418. MEF APP/APLPs null cells were kindly provided by Dr. U. Mueller, and MEF cells wild type and PS-/- (genetically deficient in PS1 and PS2) have been described previously (33Herreman A. Serneels L. Annaert W. Collen D. Schoonjans L. De Strooper B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 461-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) and were provided by Dr. B. De Strooper. All cell lines were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (EuroClone, Paignton-Devon, UK) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), l-glutamine (EuroClone, Paignton-Devon, UK), and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin) (EuroClone, Paignton-Devon, UK), unless explicitly stated otherwise. Transient transfections were carried out using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Diagnostics) and Jet Pei transfection reagent (PolyPlus transfection France) and then incubated for 48 h. Immunoprecipitation Experiments—Cultured cells were lysed in a buffer containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1× Complete ® (Roche Applied Science), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% cholic acid, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, and 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.6. After a 10-min centrifugation at 1,500 rpm, cell lysates were either cold methanol-precipitated, and the resulting pellets analyzed by Western blotting after protein counting (Bio-Rad protein assay), or immunoprecipitated with different antibodies as specified under “Results.” The antigen-antibody complexes were collected by protein G-agarose beads (GE Healthcare), which were then electrophoresed by Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE, and electroblotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and proteins were probed with specific antibodies diluted in PBS plus 1% normal goat serum, hybridized with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and detected by ECL (GE Healthcare). Centrosome Purification—The isolation of centrosomes from cells was done as described previously (34Millecamps S. Gentil B.J. Gros-Louis F. Rouleau G. Julien J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1745: 84-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cells (1-3 × 107) were treated with 5 μg/ml cytochalasin B and 10 μg/ml nocodazole for 2 h at 37 °C and then harvested, centrifuged, and washed with a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 8% (w/v) sucrose. Cells were then lysed in 10 ml of lysis buffer containing 1 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors (Complete ® from Roche Applied Science) and centrifuged at 2,500 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was adjusted to 10 mm Hepes, digested with 2 units/ml DNase I for 30 min on ice, then underlaid with 60% sucrose solution (in 10 mm Pipes, pH 7.2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol), and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. Centrosomes sedimented onto the cushion were resuspended and loaded onto a discontinuous gradient consisting of 70% sucrose at the bottom followed by 50 and 40% layers and centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 1 h. Fractions of 600 μl were collected and diluted in 1 ml of 10 mm Pipes buffer, pH 7.2. Centrosomes were obtained by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min (35Moritz M. Zheng Y. Alberts B.M. Oegema K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 775-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Immunoelectron Microscopy—H4 cells were embedded in 12% gelatin, 2.3 m sucrose and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Ultrathin cryosections are obtained by a Reichert-Jung Ultracut E with FC4E cryoattachment and collected on copper-Formvar carbon-coated grids. Immunogold localization was performed using the antibody for GRB2 C23 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and 10 nm protein A-gold-conjugated. All samples are examined on a Philips CM10 or Fei Tecnai 12G2 electron microscope. Immunocytochemistry, FRET Studies—Wild type H4 cells and transfected H4 cells grown to 80% confluence on slides were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, blocked with 0.1 m glycine, and treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 3 min. After removal of the detergent, cells were then incubated with the different primary antibodies in PBS plus 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h and finally incubated with antigen-specific secondary antibodies (Alexa 488- or 568-conjugated, from Invitrogen). Cells were then mounted by Mowiol and analyzed on MRC 1024 ES confocal microscope (Bio-Rad), equipped with a Nikon Eclipse TE 300 inverted microscope with a ×60 objective lens. Fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) was investigated through spectral analysis and then measured using the acceptor photobleaching method. FRET experiments have been performed on a Leica TCS SP2, AOBS spectral system operating with a 20-milliwatt argon laser (for 488 nm laser line) and a 1.2-milliwatt He-Ne laser (for 543 nm laser line). The FRET couples used were Alexa 488 as donor (λex499 nm, λem520 nm) and Alexa 568 as acceptor (λex579 nm, λem603 nm), the Forster radius being 62 Å, or EGFP as donor (λex499 nm, λem520 nm) and Alexa 568 as acceptor (Forster radius = 60 Å). Emission spectra were collected by exciting the donor molecules at 488 nm (laser power, 10%) and acquiring the fluorescence spectrum from 500 to 700 nm with a bandwidth of 10 nm to check the presence of acceptor fluorescence because of energy transfer. To verify the occurrence of FRET, we performed acceptor photobleaching using 543 nm laser line (laser power, 100%) for 5-10 min, the variability depending from cell to cell. Comparing the donor emission spectrum before and after the complete acceptor photobleaching (acquired in the same conditions), it is possible to observe a significant change of the donor peak depending on the energy transfer. To control the bleaching, we also collected acceptor emission spectra exciting at 543 nm (laser power, 15%) and collecting the fluorescence from 550 to 750 nm, bandwidth of 10 nm, before and after acceptor photobleaching. To determine FRET efficiency, we performed acceptor photobleaching experiments simply collecting donor and acceptor emission intensities measured in different cells. To acquire donor fluorescence we opened the donor channel from 500 to 540 nm (Dλem520 nm), and for the acceptor channel we collected the fluorescence from 590 to 630 nm (Aλem603 nm). By analyzing donor fluorescence intensity before (IDA,pre) and after the complete bleaching (IDA,post) of the acceptor molecules, it is possible to evaluate the efficiency (E) as shown in Equation 1, E=1-IDA,perIDA,post∀IDA,post>IDA,pre(Eq.1) No FRET was observed if the primary or secondary antibody was omitted. Further controls are described under “Results.” APP-GRB2 Interaction in Cultured Cells—To characterize the interaction occurring between APP and GRB2, we used mouse embryonal fibroblasts not expressing endogenous APP or APP-like proteins (MEFapp). As a first approach we transfected MEFapp cells with human APP695, or its Y682A and Y687A tyrosine mutants, which may modulate the interaction with GRB2 (29Zhou D. Noviello C. D'Ambrosio C. Scaloni A. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25374-25380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and we performed a series of immunoprecipitations (IP) and co-IP experiments. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an antibody specific for the C terminus of APP (51-2700) and, after Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE, were immunoblotted with the same antibody. These experiments showed that APP695 is fully processed independently on the tyrosine mutation tested, as demonstrated by the presence of mature and immature APP isoforms (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, the co-IP of APP with an anti-GRB2 antibody was dependent on Tyr-682 but not on Tyr-687 (Fig. 1A). Accordingly, the mutation Y653F does not hamper the possibility to interact with GRB2, whereas the double mutant Y682A/Y687A abolished the interaction (Fig. 1A). Conversely, IP with antibodies specific for the C terminus of APP (51-2700 and F25608) co-immunoprecipitated GRB2 (Fig. 1B, top panel). As expected, this interaction appears to be dependent on Tyr-682 and not on Tyr-687 (Fig. 1B, bottom panel), thus confirming the specific interaction of APP-GRB2 and the importance of the Tyr-682 phospho-site. To further confirm the occurrence of APP-GRB2 direct interaction, we performed pulldown experiments using a Sepharose-conjugated GRB2-GST purified fusion protein. As shown in Fig. 1C, GRB2-GST fusion protein pulled down APP695 only in cell lysates from APP695-transfected MEFapp cells. To test whether the APP-GRB2 interaction also occurs between endogenous proteins, we performed IP experiments in H4 human cells. In this cell line, the APP 51-2700 antibody co-precipitated all isoforms of APP and GRB2. Conversely, the antibody to GRB2 co-precipitated both APP and GRB2 as well (Fig. 1D). Localization of APP-GRB2 Interaction into the Cell—In order to identify the intracellular site of APP-GRB2 interaction, we performed immunofluorescence experiments and confocal microscopy analysis (36Matsumoto B. Cell Biological Application of Confocal Microscopy. Academic Press, San Diego2002Google Scholar) in human H4 cells. The two antigens co-localized in a discrete, intensely fluorescent spot in the nuclear area reminiscent of the centrosomal region (Fig. 2A). GRB2 is present at the centrosome, in the cytosol, and also at the plasma membrane in any cell type we have so far tested (H4, SH-SY5Y, HEK293, C6, rat cortical astrocytes and neurons, and mouse and human fibroblasts), although with heterogeneous distribution among each different cell type. APP, detected by a specific antibody directed to the N-terminal region, was also present at the centrosome, in structures resembling the ER, in the perinuclear region, and at the cell surface (Fig. 2A). Although the peak of co-localization is at the centrosome, we observed a co-localization also in the punctate cytosolic staining, in the perinuclear region, and also partially at the plasma membrane. The proof that GRB2 localized in the centrosome area stemmed from a double immunofluorescence experiment using antibodies for γ-tubulin, a typical centrosomal marker (37Stearns T. Evans L. Kirschner M. Cell. 1991; 65: 825-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). γ-Tubulin co-localized with GRB2 in a large dot next to the nuclear region (Fig. 2A). Similar data were obtained using pericentrin as a centrosomal marker. To further prove that GRB2 and APP co-localized in the centrosome area, we transfected H4 cells with vectors encoding for a histidine-tagged GRB2 construct (GRB2-his) and an EGFP-tagged APP695 (APP-EGFP). Immunostaining with an antibody specific for the histidine tag Alexa 568-conjugated showed that a fraction of both transfected proteins co-localized in the perinuclear region and at the centrosome (Fig. 2A). These experiments indicate that in human H4 cells APP and GRB2 co-localize in scattered cytosolic structures and mainly at the centrosome. The centrosome is a very peculiar region of the cell,"
https://openalex.org/W2075728882,"Receptors for extracellular nucleotides are the focus of increasing attention for their ability to cause release of plasma membrane vesicles (microparticles, MPs). Here, we show that monocyte-derived human dendritic cells (DCs) stimulated with a P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) agonist undergo a large release of MPs endowed with procoagulant activity. Functional and Western blot studies revealed that MPs contain the membrane-bound form of tissue factor (TF), a glycoprotein acting as essential cofactor of activated factor VII and triggering blood coagulation. Quiescent DCs express the membrane-bound (full length), as well as truncated alternatively spliced TF forms. DC reactivity to anti-TF Abs disappeared almost completely on stimulation with ATP or benzoyl ATP (BzATP), as shown by immunoblot and confocal microscopy analysis. Concurrently, TF reactivity and activity appeared in the vesicular fraction, indicating that MPs are important carriers for the dissemination of full-length TF form. Activity of MP-bound TF, comparable to that of relipidated recombinant TF, was dose dependently inhibited by the addition of a specific anti-human TF antibody. We infer that a large fraction of this protein, and its procoagulant potential, are ""deliverable"" after physiological or pathological stimuli. These findings might have implications for triggering and propagating coagulation in healthy and atherosclerotic vessels."
https://openalex.org/W2073288227,"Background Podocalyxin is a CD34-related transmembrane protein involved in hematopoietic cell homing, kidney morphogenesis, breast cancer progression, and epithelial cell polarization. Although this sialomucin has been shown to block cell adhesion, the mechanisms involved remain enigmatic. It has, however, been postulated that the adaptor proteins NHERF-1 and 2 could regulate apical targeting of Podocalyxin by linking it to the actin cytoskeleton. Principal Findings Here, in contrast, we find that full-length Podocalyxin acts to recruit NHERF-1 to the apical domain. Moreover, we show that ectopic expression of Podocalyxin in epithelial cells leads to microvillus formation along an expanded apical domain that extends laterally to the junctional complexes. Removal of the C-terminal PDZ-binding domain of Podocalyxin abolishes NHERF-1 recruitment but, surprisingly, has no effect on the formation of microvilli. Instead, we find that the extracellular domain and transmembrane region of Podocalyxin are sufficient to direct recruitment of filamentous actin and ezrin to the plasma membrane and induce microvillus formation. Conclusions/Significance Our data suggest that this single molecule can modulate NHERF localization and, independently, act as a key orchestrator of apical cell morphology, thereby lending mechanistic insights into its multiple roles as a polarity regulator, tumor progression marker, and anti-adhesin."

Transcription in cells of Archaea and Bacteria is catalyzed by a single RNA polymerase (RNAP), 2The abbreviations used are: RNAP, RNA polymerase; TBP, TATA-binding protein; TFB, transcription factor B; pol II, polymerase II; IB, inclusion bodies; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. whereas eukaryotic cells contain three different types of RNAPs (I, II, and III) that carry out specialized functions. Despite their morphological similarity to Bacteria, Archaea have a transcriptional machinery that is more akin to the eukaryotic machinery (1Thomm M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 18: 159-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Bell S.D. Jackson S.P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 208-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 3Geiduschek E.P. Ouhammouch M. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1397-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Like eukaryotes, Archaea use extrinsic transcription factors for initiation. The process of transcription initiation in Archaea can be dissected in three steps. The general transcription factor TATA-binding protein (TBP) interacts with the archaeal TATA box, transcription factor B (TFB) stabilizes the binding of TBP to the promoter. The TBP-TFB promoter complex mediates recruitment of RNAP (4Hausner W. Wettach J. Hethke C. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30144-30148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 5Bell S.D. Jackson S.P. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 222-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These extrinsic factors show the major structural features of eukaryotic TBP and TFIIB and interact with DNA and RNAP in a similar fashion as their eukaryotic counterparts (6Wettach J. Gohl H.P.

Cell. 1999; 4: 971-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This exceptional degree of similarity between the archaeal and eukaryotic transcriptional machineries extends also to the RNAP. Archaeal RNAP consist of 11 or 12 different subunits (8Langer D. Hain J. Thuriaux P. Zillig W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5768-5772Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 9Darcy T.J. Hausner W. Awery D.E. Edwards A.M. Thomm M. Reeve J.N. J.

Blackwell Publishing, Oxford, UK2006: 185-198Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar) that display a high level of primary sequence similarity to the subunits present in eukaryotic RNAPII. With the exception of subunits RPB8 and RPB9, orthologs of other RNAPII subunits have been identified in all archaeal genomes studied so far. A recent in silico study revealed a high degree of conservation of subunits shared by pol II and Archaea in particular in the regions of RNAP comprising the catalytic center and protein-protein binding studies showed a similar pattern of subunit interactions between the subunits of pol II and of Pyrococcus RNAP (11Goede B. Naji S. von Kampen O. Ilg K. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30581-30591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although very similar to eukaryotic RNAP in subunit composition and transcription initiation factor requirement the archaeal machinery is less complex than the eukaryotic machinery. Equivalents of the eukaryotic factors TFIIH and TFIIF are missing in archaeal genomes. Eukaryotic TFIIE is a heterodimer consisting of subunits α and β (12Meinhart A. Blobel J. Cramer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48267-48274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The archaeal homolog of TFIIE, TFE, is monomeric and corresponds to the essential N-terminal half of TFIIEα, which is required for basal and activated transcription in vitro and interacts with TBP and RNAPII (13Ohkuma Y. Hashimoto S. Wang C.K. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4856-4866Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 14Maxon M.E. Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar).

Recently, the reconstitution of the archaeal RNAP from the methanogen Methanocaldococcus jannaschii has been reported (20Werner F. Weinzierl R.O. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and was used as a tool to define the minimal set of subunits for an active pol II-like enzyme. The macromolecular complex consisting of subunits A′A″B′B″DLNP was the minimal active assembly in nonspecific assays and the RNAP reconstituted in the absence of subunit K or subunits F/E′ was still capable of specific transcription. The activity of the recombinant Methanocaldococcus enzyme was stimulated at weak promoters by archaeal TFE and this activation was dependent upon the presence of the E′/F subcomplex (Ref. 21Ouhammouch M.

The reconstituted core enzyme lacking subunits E′ and F (ΔE′F) was used to investigate the effects of subunits E′, F, and TFE on RNAP activity. We found that promoter-dependent activity of the core enzyme was at low temperatures strictly dependent upon the presence of E′. Furthermore, we provide a model dissecting the roles of the core enzyme, E′, and TFE in open complex formation. Cloning and Expression Procedures—The open reading frames encoding the P. furiosus RNAP subunits were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA using oligonucleotides corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ end of the open reading frames and introducing restriction sites. For the RNAP reconstitution experiments the PCR products were cloned into pET-30a-c(+) (Novagen) or pET151/D-TOPO (Invitrogen), and verified by sequencing (Geneart). The resultant expression plasmids were transformed into BL21Star(DE3)Codon Plus (Stratagene) and expression of the subunits was induced during logarithmic growth of the cells by addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 0.5 mm. The cultures were then incubated overnight at 20 °C. Recombinant Subunits Purification—The His6-tagged subunits B, A′, A″, and K were highly insoluble and expressed in inclusion bodies (IB) in Escherichia coli cells. It was necessary to purify these subunits under denaturing conditions. The cell pastes were resuspended in lysis buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm PMSF, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.3 mg/ml lysozyme) and sonicated. After centrifugation the pellets containing the IBs were extensively washed in IB buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 (Pierce), 1 mm PMSF, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The IBs were solubilized in binding buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 1 mm PMSF, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 1 h at room temperature. After centrifugation the supernatants were loaded onto a Ni-NTA column (HisTrapFF, GE Healthcare) and further washed with washing buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 6 m urea, 1 mm PMSF, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The refolding of the column-bound proteins was achieved by washing the column with decreasing linear urea gradient ranging from 6 to 0 m in refolding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm PMSF, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The refolded proteins were eluted with imidazole gradients ranging from 10 to 300 mm imidazole in refolding buffer. No further purification was required. The solubilized subunits were stored at –80 °C until they were used for reconstitution of wild type and core enzyme. Cell pellets containing the recombinant RNAP subunits D, E′, H, F, N, L, and P were resuspended in lysis buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 15% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.3 mg/ml lysozyme), sonicated, and centrifuged. The supernatants containing soluble His6-tagged D and E′ subunits were loaded on a Ni-NTA column (HisTrapFF, GE Healthcare) and the proteins were eluted with imidazole gradients from 10 to 200 mm in binding buffer B (20 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.8, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Tween 20, 1 mm PMSF, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). To purify the thermostable subunits H, F, N, L, and P, the supernatants containing these subunits were heated for 20 min at 90 °C. The samples were centrifuged and the thermostable extract containing His6-tagged subunits F or H was loaded on Ni-NTA columns (HisTrapFF, GE Healthcare) and purified as described above. The thermostable extracts containing the untagged N or L subunits were dialyzed against MonoQ binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 10 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and loaded on a MonoQ column (Mono Q 5/50 GL, GE Healthcare). The proteins were eluted with linear salt gradients in binding buffer ranging from 10 mm to 1 m NaCl. The thermostable extract containing the untagged P subunit was dialyzed against SP buffer (40 mm NaHEPES, pH 7, 10 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and loaded on a HiTrap SP HP column (1 ml, GE Healthcare). The proteins were eluted with salt gradients in SP buffer from 10 mm to 1 m NaCl. The untagged subunits (L, N, and P) were further purified by Superdex 75 chromatography. The concentrated proteins were loaded on a Superdex 75 column (HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 prep grade, GE Healthcare) equilibrated with a buffer containing 40 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.3, 250 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. In Vitro Assembly of the Recombinant RNAP—500 μg of all 11 subunits were combined in a final volume of 0.5 ml. The mixture was transferred to a dialysis frame (Slide-A-Lyzer 3.5k, Pierce) and denatured in transcription buffer (TB) (40 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.3, 250 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 μm ZnSO4, 1 mm PMSF, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 6 m urea for 20 min. The dialysis frame with the denatured subunits was then transferred into TB with 3 m urea for another 20 min. Renaturation was achieved by dialysis in TB for 1 h. The renatured RNAP assemblies were heated for 10 min at 70 °C to remove misfolded aggregates, and loaded on an analytic Superdex 200 or onto a Superose 6 column (200 10/300 GL, GE Healthcare). Promotor-directed in Vitro Transcription Assay—In vitro transcription assays were performed as described (27Hethke C. Geerling A.C.M. Hausner W. de Vos W. Thomm M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Standard transcription reactions contained 300 ng of gdh promoter, 42 nm TBP, 55 nm TFB, and 10 nm purified or recombinant RNAP in a total volume of 25 μl of transcription buffer (40 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.3, 250 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The amounts of DNA template, TBP, TFB, and purified RNAP, reconstituted RNAP, or ΔE′F RNAP used for the experiments described in Fig. 5 are indicated in the legend. NTPs were added to a concentration of 40 μm (ATP, GTP, and CTP) and 2 μm UTP and [α-32P]UTP at 0.15 MBq (110 TBq/mmol). The components were added at 4 °C and then incubated at 70 °C for 30 min. Labeled transcripts were analyzed by electrophoresis in 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide urea gels as described (27Hethke C. Geerling A.C.M. Hausner W. de Vos W. Thomm M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The transcription products were visualized using an Image Plate and Image Analyzer (FLA-500, Fuji, Japan). Immobilized in Vitro Transcription Assays and Isolation of Stalled Ternary Complexes—Biotinylated C-minus cassettes of the gdh promoter attached to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were used as DNA templates for stalling of transcription complexes at position +20 (23Spitalny P. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30497-30505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Stalling of complexes was achieved by omitting CTP from the nucleotide mixture. A standard reaction contained 168 fmol of immobilized DNA template, 70 nm ΔE′F RNAP, 285 nm TBP, 60 nm TFB, 40 μm ATP and GTP, 2 μm UTP, and 0.15 MBq of [α-32P]UTP (110 TBq/mmol) in 25 μl of transcription buffer not containing glycerol. Ternary complexes were isolated as reported previously (23Spitalny P. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30497-30505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and all washing and resuspending steps were carried out with preheated (60–70 °C) transcription buffer. Standard immobilized transcription reactions were incubated for 30 min at 60 or 70 °C and stopped by the addition of loading dye as described (23Spitalny P. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30497-30505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) followed by denaturation for 3 min at 95 °C. KMnO4 Footprinting of Initiation Complexes—Footprinting experiments were performed using immobilized templates labeled with [γ-32P]ATP on the free 5′-end of the nontemplate DNA strand. DNA templates were attached to magnetic beads via the biotin-labeled 5′-end of the coding DNA strand as described previously (23Spitalny P. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30497-30505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A footprinting reaction contained 168 fmol of DNA template, 70 nm purified RNAP or 70 nm RNAPΔE′F, 285 nm TBP, and 60 nm TFB in 25 μl of transcription buffer not containing β-mercaptoethanol. Complexes were incubated for 5 min at 60 or 70 °C, isolated, washed with transcription buffer (60 or 70 °C), and resuspended in transcription buffer preheated to 60 or 70 °C. KMnO4 was added to a final concentration of 23 mm. The samples were incubated for 5 min at 60 or 70 °C as indicated. The reaction was stopped and exposed to piperidin treatment as described previously (23Spitalny P. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30497-30505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Determination of Heparin Stability of Open Complexes—The stability of open complexes was measured using a modification of a heparin challenge assay (28Toulokhonov I. Landick R. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 361: 644-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). 26 nm RNAP or 58 nm ΔE′F RNAP were preincubated 5 min at 60 or 70 °C as indicated in Fig. 5C with 286 nm TBP, 60 nm TFB, and 200 ng of gdh promoter in transcription buffer in 50-μl reactions. Heparin was added to the reaction to a final concentration of 800 μg/ml. At this concentration of heparin single round conditions were established (data not shown). At various times 10-μl aliquots were transferred to tubes containing 5 μl of NTP mixture (40 μm ATP, GTP, CTP, 2 μm UTP, 0.09 MBq of [α-32P]UTP (110 TBq/mmol)) in transcription buffer and transcribed 10 min at 60 or 70 °C as indicated. Reactions were stopped by the addition of loading dye following denaturation for 3 min at 95 °C. For the 100% value, an aliquot was taken prior to heparin addition and incubated with NTPs as described above. Purification and in Vitro Assembly of the P. furiosus RNAP Subunits—All P. furiosus RNAP subunits were expressed and purified in recombinant form in E. coli. The largest subunits B, A′, and A″ and the small subunit K were insoluble and were purified under denaturing conditions. The other subunits were soluble. The purified subunits analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining are shown in Fig. 1. For the in vitro assembly assay all 11 subunits were combined in equimolar amounts. When this fraction was assayed in specific transcription assays in the presence of TBP and TFB using the homologous glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) promoter as template a run-off transcript was detected (Fig. 2A, lane 1). This result provides evidence that an active Pyrococcus RNAP can be reconstituted simply by combining all purified subunits. This fraction was subjected to stepwise dialysis against transcription buffers containing decreasing urea concentrations (6, 3, and 0 m). After this step the specific activity of this fraction was greatly increased (Fig. 2A, lane 2). This finding indicates that the denaturation and renaturation procedure enhances the formation of specific protein-protein contact between RNAP subunits. When this fraction was heated for 10 min at 70 °C to remove misfolded aggregates as described (20Werner F. Weinzierl R.O. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) the specific RNAP was slightly reduced (Fig. 2A, lane 3) indicating that the heat treatment and centrifugation step leads also in part to denaturation of active RNAP molecules. The assembled complexes after the heat treatment step were purified by Superdex 200 column chromatography (Fig. 2B). Superdex 200 size-exclusion chromatography showed that the RNAP eluted as a single homogenous peak. This RNAP eluted in the same fractions as endogenous RNAP and the marker protein ferritin (molecular mass 440,000). When the activity of RNAP was assayed in specific run-off transcription assays performed at 70 °C, fractions 18–24 of the column were capable of specific transcription (Fig. 2B). When the activity in the various fractions was analyzed the highest activity was found in later eluting fractions 22–24, which did not contain the highest amount of RNAP. The subunit composition of the various fractions did not differ significantly but the reconstituted RNAP contained substoichiometric amounts of subunits E′ and F (Fig. 3, lane 1). Subunits E′ and F eluted as a distinct nearly stoichiometric complex in fractions 33 and 34 (data not shown). When subunit E′ was added to the various fractions and the synthesis of run-off transcripts was studied at 60 °C, a clear E′-induced activation of transcription was observed in all fractions (Fig. 2B, lower panel). The E′-dependent stimulation of transcription was increased in the later eluting fractions representing the enzyme fractions with higher specific activity. The mechanism of E′-induced stimulation of transcription will be addressed in the following sections of this paper in more detail but these experiments indicate that two fractions of reconstituted RNAP exist, one fraction with lower specific activity (∼2.2 nmol of UMP/mg) that was only slightly activated by E′ and a second fraction of high specific activity (∼6.9 nmol of UMP/mg) that was strongly activated by E′. The active fraction could be also separated from the less active fraction by Superose 6 gel filtration chromatography (data not shown). The reason for the different activities of these fractions is presently unclear. Probably, the first eluting and less active RNAP fraction contained still some aggregated subunits and subunits containing misfolded domains or helices that were inactive or less active. To investigate the interaction of subunits E′ and F with the active core of RNAP in more detail, the RNAP was reconstituted in the absence of these subunits. This ΔE′F RNAP showed a similar elution profile like the enzyme reconstituted from 11 subunits (Fig. 2C). An active RNAP was eluted in fractions 19–26. This finding indicates that the enzyme lacking these subunits was capable of synthesizing specific run-off transcripts. The ΔE′F RNAP is therefore also designated as core enzyme here. The most active fractions of the core enzyme were eluting later (fractions 23–26) indicating that the lower activity of fractions 19–21 containing higher amounts of RNAP (see SDS-PAGE of RNAP fractions in Fig. 2B) was not caused by a lower content of subunits E′ and F in these fractions. Although both fractions appear to be suitable for characterization of the reconstituted ΔE′F enzyme we used the RNAP with higher specific activity for the more detailed analyses of the E′-core enzyme interaction described later in this paper. When the activities of the reconstituted and the core enzyme were compared under standard conditions (70 °C) with that of the endogenous RNAP, the less active fractions of reconstituted RNAP showed ∼20%, the highly active fractions 50% of the activity of the endogenous RNAP (Fig. 2D). Fraction 25 of the core enzyme displayed ∼40% of the activity of the endogenous RNAP. At 60 °C, the activity of the endogenous RNAP was reduced by a factor of ∼2, that of the more active reconstituted RNAP by a factor of ∼4, and that of the core enzyme by a factor of ∼8 (Fig. 2D). Synthesis of the run-off transcripts was strictly dependent upon the presence of TBP and TFB. This finding indicates that the run-off products were synthesized by an Archaea RNAP dependent upon the presence of Archaea transcription factors. This result and our finding that no RNA synthesis was observed at temperatures <55 °C (data not shown) exclude the possibility that the activity observed is due to E. coli RNAP. Recombinant RNAP Activity in Promoter-directed in Vitro Transcription—To characterize the enzymatic catalytic properties of the recombinant enzyme, we performed specific in vitro transcription assays using a variety of archaeal promoters as templates. Beside the gdh promoter analyzed in Fig. 2, the reconstituted enzyme synthesized run-off transcript from linearized templates containing the aaa+atpase, hsp20, phr, and malE promoters from P. furiosus and the tRNAVal promoter from Methancoccus vannielii (data not shown). The recombinant enzyme was able to transcribe the gdh promoter in a temperature range from 60 to 80 °C specifically (data not shown). These results indicated that the reconstituted enzyme is able to initiate transcription at canonical archaeal promoters containing a TATA box and a BRE element. We conclude that the recombinant P. furiosus RNAP can perform all the steps required for specific in vitro transcription, from RNAP promoter recruitment via TBP and TFB to promoter escape and elongation. The quantification of the reconstituted RNAP activity show that this enzyme has about 40–50% (Fig. 2D and Fig. 3) of the specific activity of the endogenous enzyme purified from Pyrococcus cells (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 3). The ΔE′F RNAP showed a specific activity of 5.3 nmol of UMP/mg of protein. To test the functional role of individual subunits in promoter-dependent transcription, RNAP was reconstituted in the absence of one of the small subunits, K, N, H, and K. Very similar results were obtained as reported by Werner and Weinzierl (20Werner F. Weinzierl R.O. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) for the M. jannaschii RNAP. The ΔK showed almost the same level of activity like the complete enzyme, the ΔN showed low activity and leaving out subunit H or P from reconstitution reactions almost completely abolished activity (data not shown). Subunit E′ Stimulates Transcription at Low Temperatures—Pyrococcus enzyme reconstituted in the absence of E′ and F showed reduced but still significant activity in standard transcription assays at the gdh promoter (Fig. 2D). Therefore, the E′F subcomplex is not absolutely required for promoter directed in vitro transcription assays conducted at 70 °C. Recent proteomic results have shown that cellular levels of subunit E′ in the methanogen Methanococcoides burtonii are higher at low growth temperature (29Goodchild A. Saunders N.F.W. Ertan H. Raftery M. Guilhaus M. Curmi P.M.G. Cavicchioli R. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) suggesting a specific role of this subunit in transcription at low temperatures. This finding had prompted us to investigate the effect of subunit E′ on transcription of endogenous and reconstituted Pyrococcus RNAP at low temperatures (see also Fig. 2B and Fig. 4). At 55 °C, the activity of the endogenous RNAP was very low and only slightly stimulated by E′ (Fig. 4A). At 60 °C, the weak basal activity levels were strongly stimulated upon addition of E′. The activity was increased with the amount of E′ added and was maximal in the presence of 300 ng (553 nm) of E′ per reaction. At 70 °C, the activity of RNAP was high and only moderately stimulated by E′ (Fig. 4A). As reported for some other archaeal promoters a ∼1.5 stimulation of specific transcription from the gdh promoter was observed after addition of TFE and this activation was further increased slightly when both E′ and TFE were added to transcription reactions (Fig. 4A, right panel). These findings suggest a specific effect of subunit E′ on transcription at low temperatures and therefore transcription at 60 °C was analyzed in more detail. At 60 °C the activities of reconstituted and the core enzyme were stimulated significantly by the addition of increasing amounts of E′ (Fig. 4B). In the presence of 553 nm E′, the activity of the reconstituted enzyme was stimulated 3-fold, that of the core enzyme 7-fold (Fig. 4B). Compared with the endogenous RNAP the reconstituted RNAP was more susceptible to stimulation by E′. This can be explained by our finding that the recons"

Arginine-rich peptides have been shown to facilitate uptake of high molecular mass cargos into cells, but the mechanism of uptake is complex and may involve multiple receptors. In this report, we show that a derivative of the aminoglycoside antibiotic neomycin, in which all of the ammonium groups have been converted into guanidinium groups, can carry large (>300 kDa) bioactive molecules across cell membranes. Delivery occurs at nanomolar transporter concentrations and under these conditions depends entirely on cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Conjugation of guanidinoneomycin to the plant toxin saporin, a ribosome-inactivating agent, results in proteoglycan-dependent cell toxicity. In contrast, an arginine-rich peptide shows both heparan sulfate-dependent and -independent cellular uptake. The high selectivity of guanidinoneomycin for heparan sulfate suggests the possibility of exploiting differences in proteoglycan compositions to target delivery to different cell types.

Advances in genomics and proteomics have identified high molecular mass biomolecules and their analogs as potential therapeutic agents. The ability of a cell to take up a high molecular mass drug and to release it into the cytoplasm in an active form represents, however, a major obstacle for the development of these agents. For biological macromolecules effective delivery entails minimal exposure to conditions that may denature or otherwise disrupt activity. Numerous approaches for the physical control of drug localization and release significantly improve the pharmacokinetic features of bioactive molecules, but they typically do not address the inherent challenge of transport of the therapeutic agent across cell membranes. Delivery procedures based on passive diffusion encounter problems due to charged groups, and carriers that exploit endogenous membrane transporters limit the size of potential drug candidates. Certain polybasic proteins have been shown to enhance the cellular uptake of biomolecules (1Ryser H.J.-P. Science. 1968; 159: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Over the past 15 years, tremendous progress has been made in advancing the basic science, applications, and preclinical evaluation of these and other cationic cell transduction domains (2Dietz G.P. Bahr M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 85-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 3Wadia J.S. Dowdy S.F. Adv. Drug Del. Rev. 2005; 57: 579-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In 1988, the human immunodeficiency virus 1 Tat protein was shown to cross lipid bilayers and enter the nucleus (4Frankel A.D. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1988; 55: 1189-1193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2353) Google Scholar, 5Green M. Loewenstein P.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 1179-1188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). Subsequently, numerous other naturally occurring and chimeric peptides have been found to exhibit efficient translocation properties. A data base search, inspired by Tat, identified a number of membrane-permeable peptides that contain clustered arginine residues (6Futaki S. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2005; 57: 547-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 7Futaki S. Biopolymers Pept. Sci. 2006; 84: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Further exploration of stereochemistry and composition identified d-Tat and Arg9 as competent transporters (6Futaki S. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2005; 57: 547-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 7Futaki S. Biopolymers Pept. Sci. 2006; 84: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Additionally, significant activity was observed for branched arginine-rich oligomers (8Futaki S. Nakase I. Suzuki T. Zhang Y. Sugiura Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7925-7930Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that the presence of guanidinium moieties represents the critical feature responsible for efficient cell membrane permeability. In fact, guanidinium-containing peptoids (9Wender P.A. Mitchell D.J. Pattabiraman K. Pelkey E.T. Steinman L. Rothbard J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 13003-13008Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar) and β-peptides exhibit useful cell uptake properties (10Umezawa N. Gelman M.A. Haigis M.C. Raines R.T. Gellman S.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 368-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Short polyproline-based helices appended with guanidinium groups (11Fillon Y.A. Anderson J.P. Chmielewski J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 11798-11803Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), highly branched guanidinium-rich dendritic oligomers (12Chung H.H. Harms G. Seong C.M. Choi B.H. Min C. Taulane J.P. Goodman M. Biopolymers. 2004; 76: 83-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and heterocyclic guanidinium vectors also serve as cell transporters (13Fernández-Carneado J. Van Gool M. Martos V. Castel S. Prados P. de Mendoza J. Giralt E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 869-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The mechanistic understanding of the cellular uptake and internalization of arginine-rich peptides and their analogs has yet to be fully elucidated. Endocytosis-based mechanisms have been both supported and questioned, but some of the early studies may have suffered from artifacts generated by cell fixation. Electrostatic interactions of the positively charged peptides with membrane phospholipids have been proposed as the first step in the transduction process (14Rothbard J.B. Jessop T.C. Wender P.A. Adv. Drug. Deliv. Rev. 2005; 57: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 15Rothbard J.B. Jessop T.C. Lewis R.S. Murray B.A. Wender P.A. J. Am. Chem.

An alternative model that has recently been gaining support is the interaction of the positively charged peptides with negatively charged cell surface proteoglycan receptors (18Tyagi M. Rusnati M.

Recently, we described a new family of synthetic RNA ligands, coined “guanidinoglycosides” (Fig. 1), in which the amino groups of naturally occurring aminoglycoside antibiotics were converted to guanidinium groups. These compounds exhibit high affinity and selectivity for RNA targets that are naturally recognized by Arg-rich domains (21Luedtke N.W. Baker T.J. Goodman M. Tor Y. J. Am. Chem.

Soc. 2003; 125: 12374-12375Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Here, we explore the cellular requirement for uptake, as well as the delivery potential of guanidinoglycosides. We demonstrate that (i) the cellular binding and uptake of guanidinoneomycin at low concentration depends exclusively on heparan sulfate; (ii) in contrast, the uptake of arginine-rich peptides in the same concentration range follows both heparan sulfate-dependent and -independent pathways; (iii) guanidinoneomycin will transport high molecular mass and bioactive cargo into cells at low concentration in a completely proteoglycan-dependent manner; and (iv) effective guanidinoneomycin-mediated delivery can be achieved with little or no cellular toxicity.

All cell lines were grown under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air and 100% relative humidity in F12 growth medium supplemented with 7.5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin sulfate, and 100 units/ml of penicillin G. Synthesis of Guanidinoneomycin-Biotin, Neomycin-Biotin, and Arg9-Biotin—Synthesis of guanidinoneomycin-biotin and neomycin-biotin is described in the supporting information. Arg9-biotin and Arg9-BODIPY were synthesized using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)/HBTU (O-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate) chemistry as described in the supporting information. Inhibition Experiments—Wild-type CHO cells were grown to confluence on 6-well tissue culture plates, harvested with 10 mm EDTA (37 °C, 10 min), washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and incubated in suspension with biotinylated FGF-2 (10 ng/ml) (25Wei G. Bai X. Sarkar A.K. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7857-7864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) in F12 medium for 1 h at 4 °C in the presence of increasing concentrations of guanidinoneomycin (100 nm to 1.8 mm). The cells were then stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin-Cy5 (BD Biosciences) for 20 min, washed three times with PBS, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells were also incubated in F12 medium containing 0.5 μm Arg9-BODIPY and increasing concentrations of guanidinoneomycin (1–300 μm) for 1 h at 37 °C and analyzed by flow cytometry. Preparation of Fluorescently Tagged Guanidinoneomycin-Biotin, Neomycin-Biotin, and Arg9-Biotin and Cell Uptake Studies—Biotinylated compounds were stored in water at -20 °C. After thawing at room temperature, compounds were diluted into F12 medium to 1 μm. To this solution, streptavidin-PE-Cy5 (BD Biosciences) was added in a 1:1000 dilution to achieve a ratio of 1:3 of fluorophore to biotin. To ensure completion of the biotin-streptavidin reaction, the solution was gently mixed and allowed to incubate at room temperature, shielded from light for 30 min. Following this incubation, compounds were diluted to the desired concentration in growth medium. For experiments done at 4 °C solutions were incubated on ice for 30 min. Wild-type and mutant CHO cells were grown to confluency on 6-well tissue culture plates. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with the fluorescent-tagged guanidinoneomycin-, neomycin-, or Arg9-biotin for 1 h at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were washed with PBS, released with EDTA, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Microscopy—Cells were cultured on Lab-Tek chambered coverglass slides (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in F12 medium. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h in 1 ml of 60 nm guanidinoneomycin coupled to streptavidin-Alexa-488 (Molecular Probes) at 37 °C. Guanidinoneomycin-A488 was prepared by incubating 1 μm guanidinoneomycinbiotin with 6 μg of streptavidin-Alexa-488 in 1 ml of medium. Hoechst 33342 (2 μg/ml; Molecular Probes) was added to cells for the last 20 min of incubation. Cells were washed three times with F12 medium before live cell imaging. Microscopic images were acquired on an Olympus IX70 DeltaVision Spectris Image Deconvolution system, equipped with a temperature and atmospherically controlled stage. Images were deconvolved (10 cycles) using SoftWoRx Explorer Suite software. Saporin Delivery—A conjugate of saporin and biotinylated guanidinoneomycin was prepared by mixing streptavidinylated saporin (Advanced Targeting Systems) with biotinylated compound in 1:4 ratio. Wild-type CHO and pgsA cells were incubated with guanidinoneomycin-biotin, guanidinoneomycin-biotin and saporin or the conjugate of guanidinoneomycin-biotin and streptavidinylated saporin in complete growth medium for 4 days at 37 °C. CellTiter-Blue (Promega) was added to the medium and cells were incubated for an additional 4 h to measure viability. Uptake of Guanidinoneomycin Depends on Heparan Sulfate— Neomycin is a member of a family of aminoglycoside antibiotics that inhibit protein synthesis in bacteria (26Chambers H.F. Brunton L.L. Lazo J.S. Parker K.L. Goodman & Gilman’s The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. 11th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York2006: 1155-1171Google Scholar). Conversion of the amino groups to guanidinium groups alters the properties of the glycoside, allowing it to interact with cell surface heparan sulfate. To study its interactions with cells, we synthesized biotinylated guanidinoneomycin, as well as biotinylated neomycin and biotinylated Arg9 for comparison (Fig. 1). Biotinylation facilitates conjugation of the carriers to fluorophores and its versatility allows for the preparation and testing of a variety of analogs in different assays. Fluorescent streptavidin-phycoerythrin-cychrome (streptavidin-PE-Cy5) conjugates of biotinylated guanidinoneomycin, neomycin, and Arg9 were incubated with CHO cells and uptake was measured by flow cytometry. As described below, these measurements reflect both binding and internalization of the conjugates but are referred to as “uptake” for the sake of clarity. Uptake of the fluorescent guanidinoneomycin conjugate occurred at concentrations as low as 10 nm and proportionately increased up to a concentration of 1 μm, the highest concentration tested (Fig. 2, upper panels, blue lines). Cells also took up the neomycin conjugate but much less efficiently than the guanidinylated derivative (middle panel, blue lines). Uptake of the Arg9 peptide occurred in a more complex manner, exhibiting two classes of receptors expressed by different cells in the population (lower panel, blue lines). Incubation with heparin at concentrations as low as 100 ng/ml blocked uptake of the fluorescent guanidinoneomycin conjugate (Fig. 3), suggesting a high affinity of the compound for the negatively charged residues in heparin. These data also suggested the possibility that cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans might represent one class of receptors that mediate binding and uptake. To test this idea, the fluorescent guanidinoneomycin conjugate was incubated with pgsA cells, a mutant that makes <2% of the wild-type level of chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate chains (Table 1) (23Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Guanidinoneomycin uptake in pgsA cells was barely detectable up to concentrations of 100 nm and was over 20-fold lower than that observed with wild-type cells, even at 1 μm (Fig. 2, upper panels, green lines). At higher concentrations, a second, glycosaminoglycan-independent mode of uptake began to emerge. The same trend was observed for the fluorescently tagged neomycin, with internalization being more efficient in wild-type cells than pgsA cells (Fig. 2, middle panels, green lines). The signal from pgsA cells was not affected by trypsin, indicating interactions with a non-proteinaceous receptor.TABLE 1Glycan-deficient cell lines CHO, Chinese hamster ovary cells.StrainGlycan alterationEnzymatic defectWild-type CHONormalNoneCHO pgsAGlycosaminoglycan-deficientXylosyltransferase (XTII) (23Esko J.D.

Multiple populations of cells exhibiting differential binding or uptake capacity were observed in pgsA cells and in wild-type cells. These data suggest that the internalization of Arg9 follows both glycosaminoglycan-dependent and -independent pathways. Analysis of the mean fluorescence values showed that uptake of the compounds occurred in proportion to concentration, but did not saturate (Fig. 2b). Because of this, no further experiments to measure affinity were attempted. To further study the uptake of guanidinoglycosides, other mutant CHO cells were examined (Table 1, Fig. 3). pgsG cells, mutants lacking all glycosaminoglycans due to a deficiency in glucuronyltransferase I (24Bai X.M. Wei G. Sinha A. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13017-13024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), showed a reduction in binding and uptake similar to pgsA cells. Reintroduction of the gene for glucuronosyltransferase I (pgsG + GlcATI) restored binding and uptake, demonstrating their dependence on glycosaminoglycans. Cells selectively lacking heparan sulfate (pgsD) 27) also exhibited dramatically reduced binding and uptake of fluorescent guanidinoneomycin. Because pgsD cells express higher than normal levels of chondroitin sulfate on the cell surface, these findings demonstrate the specificity of binding and uptake for heparan sulfate. Examination of Lec2 cells, which lack sialic acid residues, excluded participation of sialylated glycoproteins and glycolipids (data not shown). To test the dependence of guanidinoglycoside uptake on heparan sulfate in other cells, we incubated human HeLa ovarian carcinoma cells with fluorescent guanidinoneomycin. A robust signal was obtained, and treatment of the cells with heparin lyases reduced uptake (Fig. 3). The extent of reduction was not as great by enzymatic treatment as by genetic inactivation of heparan sulfate formation in CHO cells, presumably due to incomplete digestion of heparan sulfate chains. Similar results were also obtained for STO mouse fibroblast cells (data not shown), indicating that heparan sulfate on other cells can also mediate uptake of guanidinoneomycin. To distinguish between cell surface binding and internalization, wild-type CHO cells were incubated with the fluorescent guanidinoneomycin conjugate at 4 °C, where only surface binding occurs. The extent of labeling at 4 °C was reduced by ∼6-fold compared with incubations performed at 37 °C (Fig. 4, inset), suggesting that ∼85% of the fluorescence signal at 37 °C was due to internalization. Binding at 4 °C was sensitive to trypsin and heparinase treatment, consistent with binding to membrane proteoglycans. Incubation of pgsA cells showed that at low concentrations binding was entirely dependent on expression of glycosaminoglycans. At higher concentrations, a second class of binding sites was detected that did not show saturability (Fig. 4). Binding to wild-type cells at higher concentrations represents the sum of both classes of binding sites. Subtraction of the fluorescent values obtained from the mutant (pink line) from those obtained from the wild-type (blue line) yielded a binding curve (green line) that presumably reflects the contribution of the proteoglycans (Fig. 4). Guanidinoneomycin Inhibition of FGF-2 and Arg9 Binding to Cell Surface Heparan Sulfate—The binding and uptake studies described above predicted that guanidinoneomycin would inhibit binding of ligands that are known to interact with heparan sulfate, such as basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) (29Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar, 30Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Prior studies have shown that biotinylated FGF-2 will bind to wild-type CHO cells in a heparan sulfate-dependent manner (24Bai X.M. Wei G. Sinha A. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13017-13024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). When mixed with increasing concentrations of guanidinoneomycin, binding was inhibited, with an IC50 value of ∼20 μm (Fig. 5a). In contrast, neomycin, the parent aminoglycoside, did not inhibit binding of FGF-2, which is consistent with its reduced affinity for heparan sulfate (data not shown). Guanidinoneomycin also blocked fluorescent-Arg9 binding and uptake (Fig. 5b). However, inhibition of Arg9 was incomplete, saturating at the same level of fluorescence intensity as observed when fluorescent Arg9 was incubated with pgsA cells (Fig. 5b, inset). These data show that Arg9 and guanidinoneomycin bind to a common set of glycosaminoglycan-dependent sites and support the idea that Arg9 also has one or more glycosaminoglycan-independent mechanisms of uptake. Guanidinoneomycin Internalization and Cytoplasmic Delivery of Cargo—To study uptake of guanidinoneomycin in live cells, wild-type and glycosaminoglycan-deficient pgsA cells were incubated with a conjugate prepared from guanidinoneomycin-biotin and streptavidin-Alexa-488. Deconvolution fluorescence microscopy demonstrated uptake into punctate vesicles (Fig. 6a), whereas uptake was not observed in pgsA cells (Fig. 6b). Inclusion of heparin (50 μg/ml) in the incubation medium completely abolished uptake in wild-type cells (data not shown), but washing the cells with heparin (350 μg/ml) after incubation with the fluorescent guanidinoglycoside conjugate had little effect on vesicle fluorescence, consistent with the idea that the punctate structures were intracellular. With longer incubation, more diffuse cytoplasmic staining was observed as well (data not shown). To probe the mechanism of uptake, wild-type cells were incubated with the fluorescent guanidinoneomycin conjugate in the presence of sucrose, which has been shown to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis through dissociation of the clathrin lattice (31Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), and amiloride, which specifically blocks macropinocytosis through inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange (23Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 32Kaplan I.M. Wadia J.S. Dowdy S.F. J. Controlled Release. 2005; 102: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Cells treated with sucrose showed a marked decrease in internalization of guanidinoneomycin, whereas amiloride had no effect (Fig. 6c). These data indicate that guanidinoneomycin is likely internalized into cells via clathrin-dependent endocytosis, consistent with other studies indicating that proteoglycans undergo constitutive internalization (33Williams K.J. Fuki I.V. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that much of the internalized fluorescent guanidinoneomycin was present in endocytic vesicles or lysosomes but with time some will appear in the cytoplasm. To examine whether guanidinoneomycin could deliver large cargo into the cytoplasm, streptavidinylated saporin was conjugated to guanidinoneomycin-biotin. Saporin, a Type I ribosome-inactivating toxin from Saponaria officinalis seeds, does not kill cells due to lack of cell surface receptors (34Flavell D.J. Curr. Top Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 234: 57-61PubMed Google Scholar). However, conjugation of saporin to a ligand for which receptors exist leads to cell death (34Flavell D.J. Curr. Top Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 234: 57-61PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7, the guanidinoneomycin-saporin complex killed wild-type CHO cells with an LD50 of ∼2 nm. No cell toxicity was observed for unconjugated guanidinoneomycin-biotin or for free saporin at concentrations up to 100 nm. Mutant pgsA cells were resistant to toxin within this range of concentration but succumbed at higher concentrations, similarly to cells treated with neomycin-saporin or unconjugated saporin at high concentration. Taken together, these data show that guanidinoneomycin can deliver at very low concentrations large, bioactive cargo into the cytoplasm in a heparan sulfate-dependent manner. Cationic transduction domains, such as the Arg-rich Tat peptide, have been demonstrated to effectively cross lipid bilayers and enter cells (7Futaki S. Biopolymers Pept. Sci. 2006; 84: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Importantly, such relatively short peptides have also been shown to facilitate the uptake of diverse molecular cargos, from small molecules to oligonucleotides and proteins. These observations support the notion that such molecular transporting vehicles can eventually be used to facilitate cellular delivery of impermeable therapeutic agents. A natural peptidic backbone (or sequence) is unnecessary for delivery, because several guanidinium-containing derivatives have been shown to function in a similar manner to Arg-rich peptides. Here, we have evaluated the cell surface requirements for the uptake of guanidinoneomycin, a carbohydrate-based, nonoligomeric guanidinium-rich derivative of the naturally occurring aminoglycoside antibiotic. Like their oligo-arginine counterparts, guanidinoneomycin can deliver high molecular mass cargos, but with much greater selectivity for cell surface heparan sulfate. Thus, guanidinylated glycosides such as guanidinoneomycin may provide the opportunity to develop cell-selective delivery tools, exploiting the differences in proteoglycan expression among different cell types (35Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). A universal feature of cell transduction domains, independent of backbone structure, is the presence of a number of guanidinium groups. Bearing a fixed positive charge, these groups can readily form charge-charge interactions with negatively charged groups present in macromolecules, such as phosphate groups in nucleic acids, sulfate and carboxyl groups in glycosaminoglycans, and polar head groups of acidic phospholipids enriched in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. The guanidinoglycosides bind more avidly than the corresponding aminoglycosides, presumably due to the higher basicity of the guanidinium groups and their ability to form charged, paired hydrogen bonds with sulfate groups. Apparently, net charge plays a key role in efficacy, as cell transduction domains typically contain between 5 and 11 clustered guanidino groups (3Wadia J.S. Dowdy S.F. Adv. Drug Del. Rev. 2005; 57: 579-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 9Wender P.A. Mitchell D.J. Pattabiraman K. Pelkey E.T. Steinman L. Rothbard J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 13003-13008Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar, 22Luedtke N.W. Carmichael P. Tor Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 12374-12375Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The studies reported here also demonstrate that the three-dimensional distribution and density of guanidinium groups confer preferred interactions. Thus, exogenously supplied guanidinoneomycin preferentially interacts with heparan sulfate chains associated with cell surface proteoglycans, and not with other acidic glycans, such as chondroitin sulfate, which actually has a higher average charge density per unit length compared with heparan sulfate. Guanidinoneomycin can also bind to a second class of lower affinity receptors when added at higher concentrations. While the proteoglycan-dependent receptors became saturated at low micromolar concentrations of guanidinoneomycin, the binding to this second, non-heparansulfate-dependent class of receptors did not plateau. This finding indicates that these receptors are abundant and may constitute a major part of the cell surface, such as the polar heads of the phospholipids (15Rothbard J.B. Jessop T.C. Lewis R.S. Murray B.A. Wender P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 9506-9507Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). The ability to alter the number and spatial distribution of guanidinium groups on glycoside-based scaffolds may aid in the design of even more specific derivatives. A major finding reported here is the use of guanidinoglycosides to facilitate the cytoplasmic delivery of bioactive cargo, such as streptavidinylated saporin (∼130 kDa) and phycoerythrin (∼300 kDa). The use of saporin as a probe of cytoplasmic delivery has several advantages, including greater sensitivity and the capacity to kill cells by inhibition of protein synthesis. The dependence of cytoplasmic delivery on heparan sulfate and its sensitivity to sucrose suggests that the guanidinoneomycin conjugates may bind to membrane proteoglycans and “piggy-back” into the cell during clathrin-dependent endocytosis. A portion of membrane proteoglycans undergoes constitutive internalization and degradation in lysosomes (33Williams K.J. Fuki I.V. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Although it is tempting to speculate that the punctate structures labeled by fluorescent guanidinoneomycin represent a pool from which saporin complexes escape or are transported into the cytosol, further studies are needed to determine the actual compartment from which cytosolic cargo originates. Guanidinoglycosides present several advantages over peptide/oligomer-based transport vehicles: 1) The mechanism of uptake and delivery of polyarginine appears to be more complicated, because both heparan sulfate-dependent and -independent pathways exist; 2) Non-peptidic and non-oligomeric structures may display enhanced in vivo stability; 3) Aminoglycoside-degrading enzymes, and by inference enzymes that degrade guanidinoglycosides, have not yet been described in animal cells, whereas multiple proteases exist that can degrade arginine-rich peptides; 4) Guanidinoglycosides may offer greater flexibility in conjugation chemistry as compared with peptide-based delivery agents; 5) The chemical synthesis of guanidinoglycosides allows for divergent synthesis of multiple conjugates; and 6) The use of cleavable linkers might further facilitate the delivery of small and large molecules and their release within the cytoplasm. In summary, we have shown the capacity of guanidinoglycosides to deliver high molecular mass, bioactive cargos into cells. At low concentration, cellular uptake occurs exclusively by heparan sulfate-dependent receptors. This behavior may provide a window of opportunity to exploit differences in expression of cell surface proteoglycans for the development of more effective and selective cellular delivery vehicles.

https://openalex.org/W2129372622,"NM23-H1 is a member of the NM23/NDP kinase gene family and a putative metastasis suppressor. Previously, a screen for NM23-H1-interacting proteins that could potentially modulate its activity identified serine-threonine kinase receptor-associated protein (STRAP), a transforming growth factor (TGF)-β receptor-interacting protein. Through the use of cysteine to serine amino acid substitution mutants of NM23-H1 (C4S, C109S, and C145S) and STRAP (C152S, C270S, and C152S/C270S), we demonstrated that the association between these two proteins is dependent on Cys145 of NM23-H1 and Cys152 and Cys270 of STRAP but did not appear to involve Cys4 and Cys109 of NM23-H1, suggesting that a disulfide linkage involving Cys145 of NM23-H1 and Cys152 or Cys270 of STRAP mediates complex formation. The interaction was dependent on the presence of dithiothreitol or β-mercaptoethanol but not H2O2. Ectopic expression of wild-type NM23-H1, but not NM23-H1(C145S), negatively regulated TGF-β signaling in a dose-dependent manner, enhanced stable association between the TGF-β receptor and Smad7, and prevented nuclear translocation of Smad3. Similarly, wild-type NM23-H1 inhibited TGF-β-induced apoptosis and growth inhibition, whereas NM23-H1(C145S) had no effect. Knockdown of NM23-H1 by small interfering RNA stimulated TGF-β signaling. Coexpression of wild-type STRAP, but not STRAP(C152S/C270S), significantly stimulated NM23-H1-induced growth of HaCaT cells. These results suggest that the direct interaction of NM23-H1 and STRAP is important for the regulation of TGF-β-dependent biological activity as well as NM23-H1 activity.

In humans, the eight NM23 genes that have been identified to date, NM23-H1, NM23-H2, NM23-H3, NM23-H4, NM23-H5, NM23-H6, NM23-H7, and NM23-H8, encode NDP kinases or homologous isoforms (2Ishikawa N.

Cancer Inst. 1994; 86: 1838-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The ability of NM23 family proteins to regulate such a diverse set of cellular processes has recently been linked to their ability to modulate signal transduction by a diverse set of growth factors, such as transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), 2The abbreviations used are: TGF, transforming growth factor; TβR, transforming growth factor-β receptor; STRAP, serine-threonine kinase receptor-associated protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DTT, dithiothreitol; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.2The abbreviations used are: TGF, transforming growth factor; TβR, transforming growth factor-β receptor; STRAP, serine-threonine kinase receptor-associated protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DTT, dithiothreitol; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. nerve growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor-1 (8Otero A.S.

These results suggest that the identification of additional binding partners of NM23 proteins will provide greater insight into the regulation and biological function of NM23 family proteins. STRAP interacts with both PDK1 (3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1) and TGF-β receptor. Through this interaction, STRAP positively regulates PDK1 and negatively regulates TGF-β signaling by stabilizing the association between TGF-β receptor and Smad7 (15Seong H.-A. Jung H. Choi H.-S.

DNA Construction and Plasmids—The NM23-H1 mutants were generated by the PCR method. In brief, pBluescript containing a full-length NM23-H1 (pBS-NM23-H1; GenBank™ accession number X73066) was used as the template for amplification with either the T3 (5′-ATTAACCCTCACTAAAG-3′) or T7 (5′-AATACGACTCACTATAG-3′) primer, in conjunction with one of the following mutant primers containing alterations in the nucleotide sequence of NM23-H1: for NM23-H1 Cys4 → Ser (NM23-H1(C4S)), sense 5′-ATGGCCAACTCAGAGCGTACC-3′, antisense 5′-GGTACGCTCTGAGTTGGCCAT-3′; for NM23-H1 Cys109 → Ser (NM23-H1(C109S)), sense 5′-GGAGACTTCTCGATACAAGTT-3′, antisense 5′-AACTTGTATCGAGAAGTCTCC-3′; for NM23-H1 Cys145 → Ser (NM23-H1(C145S)), sense 5′-TACACGAGCTCAGCTCCAGAAC-3′, antisense 5′-GTTCTGAGCTGAGCTCGTGTA-3′.

To generate FLAG epitope-tagged fusion proteins of NM23-H1 mutants, amplified PCR products were digested with EcoRV and XbaI and ligated into pFLAG-CMV2. A ClaI/NotI fragment of each mutant in pBluescript was ligated into the ClaI/NotI site of pEBG to generate glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of NM23-H1 mutants. Site-directed mutagenesis of STRAP was carried out using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and the following mutant primers containing alterations in the nucleotide sequence of STRAP (GenBank™ accession number BC000162): for STRAP Cys152 → Ser (STRAP(C152S)), sense 5′-AGCTCTGTGGTCGAGTGAGGATA-3′, antisense 5′-TAT CCTCACTCGACCACAGAGCT-3′; for STRAP Cys270 → Ser (STRAP(C270S)), sense 5′-TCCTATTCACTCAGTGAGATTTA-3′, antisense 5′-TAAATCTCACTGAGTGAATAGGA-3′.

Briefly, cells grown on sterile coverslips were transfected with an expression vector encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP), together with the indicated expression vectors. After 24 h, the cells were treated with TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml for HeLa, 2 ng/ml for HaCaT) for 20 h and then fixed with ice-cold 100% methanol and washed three times with PBS. The cells were then stained with a bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33258) and visualized under a fluorescence microscope as described previously (15Seong H.-A. Jung H. Choi H.-S. Kim K.-T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42897-42908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by counting the number of GFP-positive cells with apoptotic nuclei and dividing this by the total number of GFP-positive cells. Preparation of Nuclear Fractions—Hep3B cells (∼4 × 105 cells/60-mm dish) transfected with the indicated combinations of expression vectors (for Smad3, STRAP, wild-type NM23-H1, and NM23-H1(C145S)) were harvested and washed twice with PBS and then resuspended in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were solubilized by pipetting, and the lysate was incubated on ice for 10 min and then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 6 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) was separated from the insoluble pellet. Pellets were resuspended by pipetting in 100 μl of buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20% glycerol) and then incubated on ice for 20 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 6 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant (nuclear fraction) was collected in a chilled microcentrifuge tube. Autophosphorylation and Phosphotransferase Assay of NM23-H1—To assay autophosphorylation of NM23-H1, ∼3 μg of purified recombinant wild-type or mutant NM23-H1 were incubated with 1 μm [γ-32P]ATP (0.2 mCi/ml) at room temperature for 10 min in a 20-μl reaction volume containing TMD buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (pH 8.8) and incubated at room temperature for an additional 10 min. Proteins were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE, and the wet gel was subjected to autoradiography at -70 °C. To assay the phosphotransferase activity of NM23-H1, ∼3 μg of purified recombinant His-NM23-H1 were incubated with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 15 min at room temperature in a final volume of 100 μl of TMD buffer. The reaction products were concentrated with a Centricon-30 (Millipore, Billerica, MA) to a final volume of less than 50 μl. Five μl of the concentrated sample were incubated with unlabeled wild-type or mutant NM23-H1 (12 μg) in a final volume of 30 μl of TMD buffer for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5 volumes of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (pH 8.8), incubated at room temperature for an additional 10 min, and then resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. The wet gel was subjected to autoradiography at -70 °C. Assay of NM23-H1 NDP Kinase Activity—The NDP kinase assay was performed in TMD buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT) as described previously (20Freije J.M. Blay P. MacDonald N.J. Manrow R.E. Steeg P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5525-5532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In brief, 3 μg of purified recombinant wild-type or mutant NM23-H1 were incubated with 1 μm [γ-32P]ATP (0.2 mCi/ml) and 100 μm GDP in TMD buffer in a final volume of 20 μl for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 50 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). The reaction mixture (2 μl) was spotted onto 20 × 20-cm polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates (Merck), and reaction products were resolved by capillary action in 0.75 m KH2PO4, pH 3.65. The TLC plates were dried and exposed to film, and the formation of [γ-32P]GTP was visualized by autoradiography. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting Analysis—HaCaT cells (2 × 105 cells/60-mm dish) transiently transfected with the indicated expression vectors or siRNA duplexes (NM23-H1 or control siRNA) were washed with ice-cold PBS and then treated with hydroxyurea (2 mm) for 20 h to synchronize the cells in G0/G1. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed after treatment with 10% serum for 24 h in the presence or absence of TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) as follows. Cells were trypsinized, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with a solution (1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide and 1 mg/ml RNase A. Flow cytometry was carried out using a FACSCalibur-S system (BD Biosciences), and the data were analyzed using the ModFitLT version 3.0 (PMac) program. Immunofluorescence Cytochemistry—Immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously (15Seong H.-A. Jung H. Choi H.-S. Kim K.-T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42897-42908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In brief, Hep3B cells growing on sterile coverslips were transfected with the indicated expression vectors. The coverslips were placed on ice, and cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and then incubated with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed with PBS, treated with 0.2% Triton X-100, and rewashed with PBS. Mouse anti-FLAG (M2) antibody diluted 1000-fold in PBS or rabbit anti-NM23-H1 antibody diluted 200-fold in PBS was applied for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were then washed three times with PBS and then incubated with Alexa Fluor-594 anti-mouse secondary antibody or Alexa Fluor-488 anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1000-fold dilutions) at 37 °C for 1 h. Cell nuclei were stained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The coverslips were washed three times with PBS and then mounted on glass slides using Gelvatol. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized on a Leica Dmire2 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Germany). NM23-H1 Physically Interacts with STRAP in Vivo—To identify proteins that interacted with NM23-H1, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen using the full-length human NM23-H1 as a bait, as described previously (18Seong H.-A. Kim K.-T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9655-9662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Screening of a human HeLa cDNA library led to the identification of eight distinct positive clones (data not shown). Among them, one clone was found to encode STRAP, a TGF-β receptor-interacting protein (23Datta P.K. Chytil A. Gorska A.E. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34671-34674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Based on this previous result, we investigated whether NM23-H1 interacted with STRAP in mammalian cells by performing a set of cotransfection experiments using GST- and FLAG-tagged eukaryotic expression vectors. FLAG-STRAP was detected in association with NM23-H1 only when coexpressed with GST-NM23-H1 (Fig. 1A, top). These data corroborated the results of the yeast two-hybrid screen and demonstrated that NM23-H1 physically interacts with STRAP in cells. To confirm the physical association between NM23-H1 and STRAP, we performed a coimmunoprecipitation analysis of endogenous proteins using an anti-STRAP antibody or preimmune IgG as a control. NM23-H1 was present in anti-STRAP immune complexes from all cell lines examined, including 293T, Hep3B, and SK-N-BE(2)C (18Seong H.-A. Kim K.-T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9655-9662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) cells (Fig. 1B), demonstrating that NM23-H1 physically interacts with STRAP in vivo. To determine the subcellular localization of NM23-H1 and STRAP, immunofluorescence confocal microscopy was performed using Hep3B cells transfected with expression vectors encoding FLAG-STRAP and FLAG-NM23-H1. Both STRAP and NM23-H1 were distributed mainly in the cytoplasm and colocalized with each other, as seen in the merged image in Fig. 1C. These results indicated that NM23-H1 interacts with and colocalizes with STRAP in vivo. Cysteine Residues of NM23-H1 and STRAP Participate in NM23-H1-STRAP Complex Formation—Protein-protein interactions are mediated by disulfide linkages as well as prototypical protein binding domains in the interacting proteins (17Jung H. Kim T. Chae H.-Z. Kim K.-T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15504-15510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Although STRAP contains six WD40 repeat regions (23Datta P.K. Chytil A. Gorska A.E. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34671-34674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), NM23-H1 lacks any of the typical protein binding domains that would potentially mediate its interaction with the WD40 domains of STRAP. We speculated that the interaction of NM23-H1 and STRAP is mediated by cysteine residues present in the two proteins. 293T cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors encoding FLAG-NM23-H1 or the FLAG-tagged NM23-H1 substitution mutants NM23-H1(C4S), NM23-H1(C109S), and NM23-H1(C145S), together with an expression vector for GST-tagged wild-type STRAP (GST-STRAP). GST-STRAP was precipitated using glutathione-Sepharose beads, and complex formation between NM23-H1 and STRAP was examined by immunoblot using an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 2A). There was a dramatic decrease in complex formation in cells expressing NM23-H1(C145S), compared with wild-type NM23-H1, whereas complex formation was not influenced in cells expressing NM23-H1(C4S) and NM23-H1(C109S) (Fig. 2A, top, lanes 5–8). These results suggested that Cys145 of NM23-H1 plays a critical role in the association of NM23-H1 with STRAP. The amount of STRAP and NM23-H1 in each sample was similar (Fig. 2A, middle and bottom), indicating that the observed difference in complex formation was not due to differences in STRAP and NM23-H1 expression levels. The WD40 repeats of STRAP are functional motifs that are generally involved in protein-protein interactions and the assembly of multiprotein complexes (24Komachi K. Johnson A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6023-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To determine whether cysteine residues within the WD40 repeat regions of STRAP (Cys152 and Cys270) affected complex formation between NM23-H1 and STRAP, 293T cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids encoding wild-type and mutant forms of GST-NM23-H1 and FLAG-STRAP. Coexpression of NM23-H1(C145S) with either STRAP (C152S) or STRAP(C270S) resulted in a significant decrease in complex formation between NM23-H1 and STRAP (Fig. 2B, top, lanes 4 and 6), whereas coexpression of wild-type NM23-H1 with either STRAP (C152S) or STRAP(C270S) resulted in only a slight decrease in complex formation, as compared with the expression of wild-type NM23-H1 and wild-type STRAP (Fig. 2B, top, lane 1 versus lanes 3 and 5). These results indicated that both Cys152 and Cys270 of STRAP play an important role in its association with NM23-H1. In addition, mutation of Cys270 of STRAP, which is within the sixth WD40 repeat, had a somewhat stronger effect on complex formation compared with mutation of Cys152, which is within the fourth WD40 repeat (Fig. 2B, lane 1 versus lanes 3 and 5, lane 2 versus lanes 4 and 6). To further examine the roles of Cys152 and Cys270 of STRAP in its association with NM23-H1, we generated a double substitution mutant of STRAP, STRAP(C152S/C270S), and examined its binding properties in the in vivo binding assay.

https://openalex.org/W2149936418,"Thyroid hormone (triiodothyronine, T3) is known to activate transcription by binding heterodimers of thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs). RXR-TRs bind to T3 response elements (TREs) composed of direct repeats of the sequence AGGTCA spaced by four nucleotides (DR-4). In other TREs, however, the half-sites can be arranged as inverted palindromes and palindromes (Pal). Here we show that TR homodimers and monomers activate transcription from representative TREs with alternate half-site placements. TRβ activates transcription more efficiently than TRα at an inverted palindrome (F2), and this correlates with preferential TRβ homodimer formation at F2 in vitro. Furthermore, reconstruction of TR transcription complexes in yeast indicates that TRβ homodimers are active at F2, whereas RXR-TRs are active at DR-4 and Pal. Finally, analysis of TRβ mutations that block homodimer and/or heterodimer formation reveal TRE-selective requirements for these surfaces in mammalian cells, which suggest that TRβ homodimers are active at F2, RXR-TRs at DR-4, and TR monomers at Pal. TRβ requires higher levels of hormone for activation at F2 than other TREs, and this differential effect is abolished by a dimer surface mutation suggesting that it is related to composition of the TR·TRE complex. We propose that interactions of particular TR oligomers with different elements play unappreciated roles in TRE-selective actions of liganded TRs in vivo. Thyroid hormone (triiodothyronine, T3) is known to activate transcription by binding heterodimers of thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs).

TR activity is primarily regulated by thyroid hormone (as 3,5,3′-triiodo-l-thyronine (T3)), which alters the conformation of the receptor C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) to promote dissociation of corepressors and association of coactivators (6Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, TR activity is also influenced by the sequence, arrangement, and promoter context of the TRE (2Laudet V. Gronemeyer H. The Nuclear Receptor Facts Book. 1st Ed. Academic Press, London2002: 87-112Google Scholar, 3Yen P.M. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1097-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar).

In addition, TRE sequence and arrangement influence the magnitude of response to unliganded and liganded TRs, T3 concentration dependence, dominant negative activities of mutants that arise in resistance to thyroid hormone syndrome, and the direction and extent of response to TRβ isoform-selective ligands (9Williams G.R.

Improved understanding of the molecular basis of these effects could help us to harness these selective activities. TRs bind to DNA either as heterodimers with the closely related retinoid X receptor (RXR) or as homodimers and monomers, and each species exhibits preferences for different TREs (reviewed in Refs. 1Desvergne B. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 100: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar and 2Laudet V. Gronemeyer H. The Nuclear Receptor Facts Book. 1st Ed. Academic Press, London2002: 87-112Google Scholar). TREs are composed of degenerate repeats of the sequence AGGTCA, with the half-sites arrayed as direct repeats spaced by four nucleotides (DR-4), inverted repeats spaced by four to six nucleotides (IPs) or palindromes (Pal). Heterodimers of RXRs and TRs bind each of these elements, with a strong preference for DR-4. In contrast, TRβ homodimers bind strongly to IP elements, weakly to DR-4, and not all to Pal (9Williams G.R. Zavacki A.M. Harney J.W. Brent G.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1888-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 14Kurokawa R. Yu V.C. Naar A. Kyakumoto S. Han Z. Silverman S. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K.

Chem. 1993; 268: 10221-10227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, both TRs can bind to DNA elements as monomers. The fact that different oligomeric forms of TR bind to DNA and exhibit clear preferences for different TREs raises the possibility that the nature of the response element could influence TR action and T3 response by recruitment of distinct TR transcription complexes with unique activities. It is clear that RXR-TRs are important mediators of T3 action. TR binding to RXRs in vivo has been verified by observations that TRs consistently copurify as complexes with RXRs from cell and tissue extracts (1Desvergne B. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 100: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 3Yen P.M. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1097-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). Moreover, analysis of RXR knock-out mice reveals defective T3 responses (3Yen P.M. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1097-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar, 20O'Shea P.J. Williams G.R. J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 15073-15083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Furthermore, native TREs are often comprised of DR-4 elements, which bind preferentially to RXR-TRs (1Desvergne B. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 100: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 3Yen P.M. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1097-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar), and in vitro DNA binding properties of RXR-TRs are consistent with roles in T3 response; RXR-TRs form stable complexes with DNA that persist in the presence of hormone (23Yen P.M.

Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis confirms that RXR-TRs occupy DR-4 elements in the Xenopus laevis TRβ and thyroid hormone/bZIP promoters at late stages of embryogenesis (26Sachs L.M. Shi Y.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13138-13143Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Potential roles of other TR oligomers are not as well understood. An RXR gene knock-out fails to affect TR action in ear development, implying that alternate TR species could regulate this process (27Barros A.C. Erway L.C. Krezel W. Curran T. Kastner P. Chambon P. Forrest D. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 2933-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Moreover, the fact that unliganded TRs repress transcription more efficiently at IP elements than DR-4 elements has been attributed to preferential recruitment of homodimers, which bind corepressors more efficiently than RXR-TRs (9Williams G.R. Zavacki A.M. Harney J.W. Brent G.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1888-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 10Yoh S.M. Privalsky M.L. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 900-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it has been shown that TR can bind to an unusual TRE in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in the absence of RXR in the frog oocyte chromatin assembly system (31Hsia S.C. Shi Y.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4043-4052Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Roles of alternate forms of TR in T3 activation are even less clear. Although the fact that TR homodimers dissociate rapidly from cognate TREs and T3 suppresses homodimer formation on DNA has been taken as an argument against a role for this species in T3 activation (1Desvergne B. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 100: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), other studies reveal that TR-TR·DNA complexes are stabilized by coactivators (32Diallo E.M. Thompson D.L. Koenig R.J. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 40: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and that T3 response at IP-6 elements is often independent of coexpressed RXR in transfections (9Williams G.R. Zavacki A.M. Harney J.W. Brent G.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1888-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 33Piedrafita F.J. Bendik I. Ortiz M.A. Pfahl M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 563-578PubMed Google Scholar). Most strikingly, a recent study revealed that RXR expression was only required for optimal T3 response at subsets of positively regulated genes in a mouse preneuronal cell line (34Diallo E.M. Wilhelm Jr., K.G. Thompson D.L. Koenig R.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2007; 264: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, there are several indications that alternate TR oligomers contribute to T3 induction. Study of the actions of different TR oligomers in mammalian cells is often complicated by endogenous expression of RXR and NR coregulators. To overcome this difficulty, we (35Walfish P.G.

Chem. 2001; 276: 3929-3936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) have examined TR action in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This species is devoid of known NRs and NR coregulators and can be used to reconstruct defined TR transcription complexes in a eukaryotic cell background. These studies indicate that TRs indeed activate transcription at selected TREs in the absence of RXR (35Walfish P.G. Yoganathan T. Yang Y.F. Hong H. Butt T.R. Stallcup M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3697-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 39Wu Y. Xu B. Koenig R.J. J. Biol.

Xu B. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3929-3936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). RXR-TR heterodimer and TR homodimer surfaces have also been defined. There are contacts between respective LBDs and DBDs of RXRs and TRs (1Desvergne B. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 100: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), whereas TR homodimer formation at DR-4 and IP-6 relies exclusively on LBD-LBD contacts (14Kurokawa R. Yu V.C. Naar A. Kyakumoto S. Han Z. Silverman S. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1423-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 40Zechel C. Shen X.Q. Chen J.Y. Chen Z.P. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H.

We used x-ray structure-directed mutagenesis to define these surfaces and showed that RXR-TRβ heterodimer and TRβ homodimer formation requires a small hydrophobic patch at the junction of helices (H) 10 and H11 in the LBD (17Ribeiro R.C. Feng W. Wagner R.L. Costa C.H. Pereira A.C. Apriletti J.W. Fletterick R.J. Baxter J.D. J. Biol.

This surface (LBD dimer surface) resembles those seen in x-ray structures of other NR LBD heterodimers and homodimers (reviewed in Ref. 2Laudet V. Gronemeyer H. The Nuclear Receptor Facts Book. 1st Ed. Academic Press, London2002: 87-112Google Scholar). The TRβ interface (DBD heterodimer surface) that contacts the RXR DBD was detected in an x-ray structure of an RXR·TRβ DBD complex on a DR-4 element (44Rastinejad F. Perlmann T. Evans R.M. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), and mutation of this surface inhibits RXR-TR heterodimer formation at DR-4 in vitro (17Ribeiro R.C. Feng W.

The same structure reveals another difference between TRs and RXRs; the TRβ DBD contains an α-helical C-terminal extension (CTE) that is absent from RXR and mediates additional DNA contacts (44Rastinejad F. Perlmann T. Evans R.M. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The requirements for these surfaces in T3 response in vivo are not known. In this study, we compare actions of wild type and mutant TRs at different TREs in yeast and in mammalian cells. Although the data confirm that RXR-TRs activate transcription at DR-4, they suggest that TRβ homodimers and monomers mediate T3 response at IP-6 and Pal, respectively. We propose that TRE half-site orientation dictates the composition of the active form of TR in vivo and that this effect should be considered in analysis of TR activity and design of selective TR modulators.

The presence of the mutation(s) was verified by DNA sequencing using Sequenase kits (Stratagene). FLAG and Myc-tagged TR expression vectors were created by PCR amplification of the TRβ cDNA and insertion into FLAG and Myc vectors (Clontech) at appropriate restriction sites. Mammalian Cell Culture, Electroporation, and Luciferase Assays—Human promonocyte U937, HEK, HeLa, and U2-OS cells were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 subcultured in media RPMI 1640 with 10% newborn bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Transfections were carried out as described previously (45Leitman D.C. Costa C.H. Graf H. Baxter J.D. Ribeiro R.C. J. Biol.

Luciferase activity was analyzed by standard methods (luciferase assay system, Promega).

Cells were grown overnight with T3 at a final concentration of 1 μm, harvested, washed, resuspended in Z buffer, and lysed with glass beads (425–600 μm) before centrifugation. The supernatant was collected, and the protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method using bovine serum albumin as a standard.

Cell Extracts, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting— HeLa cells were cotransfected with 5 μg of pCMV-Myc-TRβ1 and 5 μg of pCMV-Tag2B-FLAG-TRβ1 by electroporation at 240 V and 950 microfarads. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested. Samples of whole cell extracts were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C for 1 h, sonicated, and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min. 100 μl (400 μg of total protein) of supernatant was diluted with 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, and 4 μg of rabbit anti-FLAG antibody (Rockland, Inc.) was added. After incubation overnight at 4 °C, 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to each sample, and the lysates were incubated for 1 h at 4°C. The beads then were washed six times with TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline; 25 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, containing 0.05% Tween 20), suspended in 2× SDS sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol, heated for 10 min at 95 °C, and resolved on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. After transferring to Immun-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad), the membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBS-T and incubated with primary antibody, mouse Myc-TRβ1 antibody (Clontech), at 1:1000 (w/v) dilution in 1% nonfat milk in TBS-T. After washing with TBS-T, immunoblots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse-IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 1% TBS-T, and proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). TRβ, but Not TRα, Is Superactive at an IP-6 Element (F2)— First, we first compared the actions of two major hormone-binding TR isoforms (TRα1 and TRβ1) at TRE-dependent reporters in cell culture (Fig. 1A). TRβ gave significantly larger T3 responses at an IP-6 element (F2) than TRα, 30–40-fold versus 6-fold. By contrast, the two TR isoforms gave comparable T3 responses at a DR-4 element (4–5-fold), and T3 responses were weaker with TRβ at Pal (2–3-fold versus 4–5-fold for TRα). Western blotting of transfected cell extracts with an antibody against an N-terminal FLAG tag in both TRs revealed similar expression levels (Fig. 1A, inset). Moreover, varying the amounts of TR expression vector confirmed that differential effects were not related to differences in amounts of TR required for optimal activation at each element (not shown). Analysis of DNA binding preferences of TRs and RXR-TRs confirms that TRβ homodimerizes on DNA in vitro and that TRα does not (Fig. 1B). TRβ homodimers bind strongly to F2 and, to a lesser extent, to DR-4. As expected, T3 inhibited TRβ homodimer formation at both elements, although significant residual binding of liganded TRβ at F2 was detected in the presence of hormone. In the same gels, TRβ and TRα bound weakly to all three TREs as monomers. Moreover, in parallel, both TRs formed heterodimers with RXR at all three TREs, with preferential binding to DR-4 (DR-4 > F2 > Pal). Thus, TRβ activates transcription more efficiently at F2 than TRα, and this correlates with enhanced homodimer formation at F2 in vitro. TRβ Homodimers Activate Transcription at F2 in Yeast—To determine the extent to which different TRβ oligomers activate transcription in eukaryotes, we assembled different TR transcription complexes in yeast stably transfected with TRE-dependent reporters and examined the effects of a mutation in the TR LBD dimer surface (TRβL422R) in each context (17Ribeiro R.C. Feng W. Wagner R.L. Costa C.H. Pereira A.C. Apriletti J.W. Fletterick R.J. Baxter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14987-14995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). TRβ homodimers and RXR-TRs were both active in yeast but exhibited distinct TRE preferences (Fig. 2, A–C). In accordance with our previous results, TRβ gave weak T3 response at all three elements, regardless of the presence of coexpressed RXR, and these responses were enhanced by GRIP1 (35Walfish P.G. Yoganathan T. Yang Y.F. Hong H. Butt T.R. Stallcup M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3697-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). With TRβ and GRIP1, large T3 responses were obtained at F2, and these were inhibited by the TRβL422R mutation (Fig. 2A). By contrast, T3 responses obtained with TRβ and GRIP1 at DR-4 and Pal were smaller and were enhanced by the same mutation (Fig. 2, B and C). Thus, TR-TR homodimers are active at F2, whereas homodimer formation places a constraint on T3 response at other elements. Although RXR did not enh"

We report that the tellurium immunomodulating compound ammonium trichloro(dioxoethylene-O,O'-)tellurate (AS101) protects dopaminergic neurons and improves motor function in animal models of PD. It is effective when administered systemically or by direct infusion into the brain. Multifunctional activities of AS101 were identified in this study. These were mainly due to the peculiar Tellur(IV)-thiol chemistry of the compound, which enabled the compound to interact with cysteine residues on both inflammatory and apoptotic caspases, resulting in their inactivation. Conversely, its interaction with a key cysteine residue on p21(ras), led to its activation, an obligatory activity for AS101-induced neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, AS101 inhibited IL-10, resulting in up-regulation of GDNF in the SN. This was associated with activation of the neuroprotective kinases Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinases, and up-regulation of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. Inhibition of caspase-1 and caspase-3 activities were associated with decreased neuronal death and inhibition of IL-1beta. We suggest that, because multiple mechanisms are involved in the dysfunction and death of neurons in PD, use of a multifunctional compound, exerting antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and neurotrophic-inducing capabilities may be potentially efficacious for the treatment of PD."
https://openalex.org/W1976191139,"Although tobacco appears highly addictive in humans, there has been persistent controversy about the ability of its psychoactive ingredient nicotine to induce self-administration behavior in laboratory animals, bringing into question nicotine's role in reinforcing tobacco smoking. Because of ethical difficulties in inducing nicotine dependence in naïve human subjects, we explored reinforcing effects of nicotine in experimentally-naive non-human primates given access to nicotine for periods of time up to two years. Five squirrel monkeys with no experimental history were allowed to intravenously self-administer nicotine by pressing one of two levers. The number of presses on the active lever needed to obtain each injection was fixed (fixed-ratio schedule) or increased progressively with successive injections during the session (progressive-ratio schedule), allowing evaluation of both reinforcing and motivational effects of nicotine under conditions of increasing response cost. Over time, a progressive shift toward high rates of responding on the active lever, but not the inactive lever, developed. The monkeys' behavior was clearly directed toward nicotine self-administration, rather than presentation of environmental stimuli associated with nicotine injection. Both schedules of reinforcement revealed a high motivation to self-administer nicotine, with monkeys continuing to press the lever when up to 600 lever-presses were needed for each injection of nicotine. Thus, nicotine, by itself, in the absence of behavioral or drug-exposure history, is a robust and highly effective reinforcer of drug-taking behavior in a non-human primate model predictive of human behavior. This supports the use of nicotinic ligands for the treatment of smokers, and this novel preclinical model offers opportunities to test future medications for the treatment of nicotine dependence."

This leads to a massive release of SV, with their incorporation into the presynaptic plasma membrane and consequent surface exposure of SV luminal epitopes (8Rigoni M. Caccin P. Gschmeissner S.

The presence of LysoPC on the external leaflet of the presynaptic plasma membrane and of FA on both sides, caused by SPANs or by the addition of LysoPC and FA mixture (LysoPC + FA), promotes the formation of the hemifusion intermediate and its transition to an open pore. At the same time, this change in lipid composition of the membrane inhibits the reverse process (i.e. the fission and retrieval of SV). A balanced SV exocytosis-endocytosis cycle is at the basis of synaptic transmission at nerve terminals (18Murthy V.N. De Camilli P. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 701-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 19Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 509-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar, 20Ryan T.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). SPANs promote exocytosis and inhibit endocytosis and, therefore, disrupt this finely tuned balance, causing the fusion of SV and formation of nerve terminal bulges decorated with the luminal domain(s) of SV proteins on their surface (9Rigoni M.

EM analysis reveals that nerve terminals are almost completely depleted of SV, with disappearance of both the “ready-releasable” pool and of the much larger “reserve” SV pool (3Chen I.L. Lee C.Y.

Science. 2005; 310: 1626-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), more surprising is the depletion of the “reserve” SV pool (21Rizzoli S.O. Betz W. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar), since the membrane changes induced by LysoPC + FA are predicted to act predominantly on SV bound to the presynaptic membrane or which can rapidly enter in contact with its cytosolic leaflet. These SV have been defined as rapidly releasable vesicles, to be distinguished from the reserve pool of vesicles whose release is caused by the rise of the nerve terminal cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, which follows an extensive stimulation (21Rizzoli S.O. Betz W. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 22Ceccarelli B. Hurlbut W.P. Mauro A. J.

Using primary cultures of different types of neurons, we found that the synaptic bulging induced by SPANs and LysoPC + FA is followed by a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i. At the same time, the mitochondrial membrane potential collapses. Upon SPAN or lipid mixture incubation, mitochondria change shape and appear to accumulate within bulges characterized by high calcium. Based on these findings, we present here a general model of nerve terminal blockade induced by SPANs or by the LysoPC + FA mixture that explains the release of both the recycling and the reserve pools of SV.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Cultures—Rat cerebellar granular neurons (CGNs) were prepared from 6-day-old Wistar rats as previously described (9Rigoni M.

All experiments were performed using SCMNs differentiated for 5-8 days in vitro.Fura2-AM Loading and Image Acquisition—Neurons grown on 24 mm coverslips were incubated in complete medium with 3 μm Fura-2/AM and 0.02% pluronic (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 37 °C and then washed. To prevent Fura-2 leakage and sequestration, 250 μm sulfinpyrazone (Sigma) was present throughout the loading procedure and [Ca2+]i measurements. After loading, cells were bathed in Krebs-Ringer buffer (KRH, in the case of CGNs) or E4 medium (Extra-4, in the case of SCMNs). KRH composition was as follows: 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 6 mm glucose, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. E4 composition was as follows: 120 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Coverslips were mounted on a thermostated chamber (Medical System Corp.), placed on the stage of an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Axiovert 100 TV; Zeiss), equipped for single cell fluorescence measurements and imaging analysis (27Giacomello M.

Samples were alternatively illuminated at 340 and 380 nm (every 15 s for 20-30 min after SPAN addition and every 10 s for 15-20 min after lipid exposure) through a ×40 oil immersion objective (numerical aperture 1.30; Zeiss), exposure times of 100 ms. Data were analyzed with MATLAB™ (The Math-Works, Natick, MA) and ImageJ version 1.35.Lipid Mixture Preparation, Neurotoxins, and Inhibitors—1-Myristoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine (mLysoPC; Sigma) and oleic acid (OA; Sigma) mixture (mLysoPC + OA) was prepared as previously described (8Rigoni M.

Notexin, taipoxin, and textilotoxin were purchased from Venom Supplies; β-bungarotoxin was from Sigma. Their purity was controlled by SDS-PAGE, and their PLA2 activity was measured with the Cayman secretory PLA2 assay kit. ω-Conotoxin MVIIC was from Latoxan, and nimodipine was from Tocris. Ionomycin and monensin were purchased from Calbiochem.Mitochondrial Imaging—SCMNs or CGNs were loaded with tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRE) (10 nm; Molecular Probes) in medium supplemented with the multidrug resistance pump inhibitor CsH (1.6 μm final concentration) (28Bernardi P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Petronilli V. Di Lisa F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 687-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) for 30 min at 37 °C. Fluorescence images were acquired with a Leica AD MIRE3 inverted microscope, equipped with a Leica DC500 CCD camera, ×63 oil immersion objective (NA 1.4), using an exposure time of 50 ms. Data were collected using Leica FW4000 software and analyzed with Leica Deblur and ImageJ version 1.35. The average fluorescence of isolated mitochondria exposed to SPANs or the lipid mixture was recorded as a function of time. Intensity variations were expressed as a percentage of the initial value. Data represent the average of at least five regions of interest. For morphological staining of mitochondria, CGNs were incubated with 300 nm Mitotracker Red (Molecular Probes) for 15 min at 37 °C and then washed; images were acquired as above.Measurement of Cellular ATP—CGNs (300,000/13-mm coverslip) were transfected at 5 days in vitro with cytosolic luciferase with a standard Lipofectamine™2000 procedure, using 1.5 μg of DNA. Measurements of cell luminescence were performed 24 h after transfection in cells pretreated or not with 25 nm taipoxin or the mLysoPC + OA lipid mixture (25 μm for 15 min; n = 4 for each condition) as described (29Jouaville L.S.

Cells were constantly perfused with a modified Krebs-Ringer buffer (mKRB: 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm Na3PO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 1mm CaCl2, 20 mm HEPES, 5.5 mm glucose, pH 7.4, at 37 °C) with 20 μm luciferin. Complete equilibration in the chamber with the new medium was obtained in 5 s. Under these conditions, the light output of a coverslip of transfected cells was in the range of 5,000-10,000 counts/s versus a background lower than 100 counts/s.In addition, the cellular ATP content was determined in CGNs, plated in a Petri dish (2 × 106 cells), at 7 days in vitro by a luciferin luciferase assay (ATP Bioluminescent Assay kit CLS II; Roche Applied Science) with an LKB Wallac 1250 luminometer. After treatment (mKRB, 25 μm lipid mixture for 15 min or 25 nm taipoxin for 60 min), cells were diluted in Tyrode buffer medium (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm glucose, 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.7), and ATP was extracted by adding 0.3 m perchloroacetic acid. Samples were kept on ice for 5 min and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 10 min. The pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 7.7 ± 0.1 with a buffer solution of KHCO3 (1 m) and KOH (1 m); the suspension was centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was used for the analysis. The ATP content of each sample was estimated using the internal standard method in which 25 pmol of ATP were added twice to the assay. Analysis was repeated on triplicates for each condition. In both procedures for ATP content assay, the number of cells analyzed in each condition was equal, as determined by protein concentration measurement.Electron Microscopy—CGNs were plated onto 13-mm polylysin-coated Thermanox coverslips (Nunc) and, after 6 days in culture, exposed to either SPANs (6 nm for 1 h) or mLysoPC + OA (25 μm for 15 min). Samples were then fixed for 1 h at room temperature in 2.5% glutaraldeyde (EM grade; Applichem) in phosphate buffer. Cells were then washed repeatedly with phosphate buffer and subjected to secondary fixation with 1% osmium tetroxide for 30 min, followed by extensive washes. Samples were then dehydrated with ascending grades of ethanol, araldite-embebbed for 2 days, and stained with aqueous uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Sections were imaged in a Jeol 1010 electron microscope equipped with a 2,000 × 2,000-pixel digital camera (GATAN).RESULTSCytosolic [Ca2+]i Increases in Nerve Terminals Exposed to Snake Presynaptic PLA2 Neurotoxins—A rise in intrasynaptic Ca2+, such as that caused by prolonged nerve stimulation, is known to trigger SV mobilization from the reserve pool (21Rizzoli S.O. Betz W. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 22Ceccarelli B. Hurlbut W.P. Mauro A. J. Cell Biol. 1972; 54: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 23Ushkaryov Y.A. Volynski K.E. Ashton A.C. Toxicon. 2004; 43: 527-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We thus hypothesized that the extensive SPAN-induced release of SV, leading to a complete impairment of the nerve terminal, could indeed be caused by a rise in [Ca2+]i. To test this possibility, we have used primary cultures of rat cerebellar granular cells and spinal cord motor neurons. Cells were loaded with the intracellular calcium indicator Fura-2 and then treated with either SPANs or LysoPC + FA mixture. Fig. 1A shows three video images of Fura-2 loaded CGNs taken at different time points after application of 25 nm taipoxin, a SPAN isolated from the venom of Oxyuranus scutellatus scutellatus. The images are pseudocolor-coded and report the ratio of the probe emission intensity at 510 nm following alternative excitation at 340 and 380 nm. The 340/380 ratio is a function of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), whereby an increase in [Ca2+]i is encoded as a shift of the pseudocolors from blue to red (video provided as supplemental Movie 1). A significant increase of the 340/380 ratio was observed in the bulges already at 10 min after toxin application, and the rise continued with time. In contrast, [Ca2+]i was unchanged in cell bodies. This selected localization of the Ca2+ rise is likely to result from the specific binding, and therefore action, of the toxin at nerve terminals. The larger surface to volume ratio of nerve terminals compared with the cell body is also to be considered (see below). Fig. 1C shows a quantitative analysis of the 340/380 fluorescence ratio changes measured at the level of different bulges and a cell body (Fig. 1B) as a function of time. Individual bulges differ significantly in their rate of [Ca2+]i rise, but the overall trend is similar. Very similar results were obtained in SCMNs and with structurally different snake PLA2 neurotoxins (i.e. notexin, β-bungarotoxin, and textilotoxin (not shown)), indicating that the results obtained here are not restricted to a single neuronal subtype or to the SPAN used. Incubation with control medium did not alter the level and distribution of intracellular Ca2+ (Fig. S1 and supplemental Movie 2).Lysophosphatidylcholine/Fatty Acid Mixture Causes an Increase in [Ca2+]i in Cultured Neurons—A similar result was obtained when CGNs were treated with the LysoPC + FA lipid mixture (Fig. 2A). Again, [Ca2+]i increased with time within the bulges induced by the lipid mixture, but in this case a rise was also detected at the level of cell bodies (black trace). The complete time course of the increase in [Ca2+]i in different bulges and in a cell body is shown in Fig. 2C. The ability of the lipid mixture to increase [Ca2+]i both at the level of bulges and cell bodies, compared with the restricted action of SPANs on neurites, was expected on the basis of the fact that LysoPC and FA can partition into the plasma membrane at any site, whereas SPANs bind specifically to the presynaptic membrane of nerve terminals (2Kini R.M. Venom Phospholipase A2 Enzymes: Structure, Function, and Mechanism. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Chichester, UK1997Google Scholar, 30Rossetto O. Morbiato L. Caccin P. Rigoni M. Montecucco C. J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 1534-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the larger [Ca2+]i increase in the presynaptic regions compared with the cell body could also be influenced by the different surface/volume ratio of the two compartments. Any modification of the homeostatic mechanisms controlling Ca2+ at the plasma membrane is expected to cause substantial variations in the tiny cytosolic rim of the presynaptic membrane, whereas the same modification should take longer to affect the bulk [Ca2+]i in the cell body.FIGURE 2Increase of [Ca2+]i induced by an equimolar mixture of lysophosphatidylcholine and oleic acid (mLysoPC + OA) in cultured neurons. A, three pseudocolor images from a movie of CGNs loaded with Fura2-AM and treated with 25 μm mLysoPC + OA for 15 min. At variance from SPAN-treated neurons, [Ca2+]i appears to increase also in the cell body, although its increase is lower than within nerve bulges. Scale bar, 10 μm. B, fluorescent images from the experiment in A at t = 0 and at t = 15 min. C, analysis of the 340/380 fluorescence ratio of the selected boxed region as a function of time. Each trace shows the ratio changes of individual regions of interest. The phenomenon was highly reproducible in many experiments performed with different neuron preparations, and the one shown here is very representative of the ensemble.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)supplemental Fig. S2 shows that the component of the LysoPC + FA lipid mixture most effective in raising the intracellular Ca2+ concentration is LysoPC and that FA, when added alone, had no effect. However, the two molecules clearly synergize in order to produce the effect shown by the mixture in Fig. 2C and in Supplemental Fig. 2A. This finding parallels the neuroparalytic effects that the lipid mixture and the two lipids alone have on the neuromuscular junction of the hemidiaphragm preparation (8Rigoni M. Caccin P. Gschmeissner S. Koster G. Postle A.D. Rossetto O. Schiavo G. Montecucco C. Science. 2005; 310: 1678-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).Mechanisms of [Ca2+]i Increase inside Nerve Terminals Poisoned with Lysophosphatidylcholine/Fatty Acid Mixtures—These findings rise the question as to whether the Ca2+ increase triggered by the toxins or by the lipid mixture derives from Ca2+ influx from the extracellular medium or depends on Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores, or both. To address this question, the experiments shown in Fig. 2 were repeated in CGNs incubated with medium without CaCl2 and supplemented with 150 μm EGTA (Ca2+-free buffer) (Fig. 3B). SPANs could not be used in these tests as Ca2+ is strictly required for their phospholipase activity (2Kini R.M. Venom Phospholipase A2 Enzymes: Structure, Function, and Mechanism. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Chichester, UK1997Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the lipid mixture caused a very small Ca2+ rise and at very late time points (Fig. 3, compare A and B). This Ca2+ increase is small and must derive from intracellular stores. In order to distinguish in our primary neuronal culture the different Ca2+-containing compartments on the basis of their luminal pH, we used a simple procedure (31Fasolato C. Zottini M. Clementi E. Zacchetti D. Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20159-20167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were first treated with ionomycin in Ca2+-free buffer. This Ca2+ ionophore exchanges Ca2+ for 2H+ and can very effectively release the cation but only from organelles with neutral/alkaline pH lumena (primarily ER, mitochondria) (32Fasolato C. Pozzan T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19630-19636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A very small and transient rise in [Ca2+]i was observed in control cells under these conditions (Fig. 3C). The acidic pH of other organelles (Golgi, secretory vesicles, and lysosomes) was then collapsed by the addition of monensin, and this induced a much larger increase in [Ca2+]i, indicating that most Ca2+ stores in these cells have an acidic luminal pH (Fig. 3C). Monensin was ineffective without ionomycin (not shown). The experiments presented in Fig. 3, D and E, demonstrate that the residual late rise of [Ca2+]i shown in Fig. 3B derives mainly from intracellular acidic compartments. Indeed, in the experiments presented in Fig. 3D, neurons were first preincubated with 1 μm ionomycin in Ca2+-free buffer and then exposed to 25 μm mLysoPC + OA. Under these conditions, the lipid mixture still elicited a late Ca2+ rise, indicating that it acted on stores insensitive to ionomycin. A complete suppression of the Ca2+ rise by mLysoPC + OA was achieved by the concomitant pretreatment with ionomycin and monensin (Fig. 3E).FIGURE 3Origin of [Ca2+]i increase within synaptic bulges induced by mLysoPC + OA. CGNs were exposed to 25 μm mLysoPC + OA for 15 min in the presence (A) or absence (B) of extracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+-free buffer: KRH without CaCl2 + EGTA 150 μm). C, control neurons were sequentially exposed to ionomycin and monensin (1 and 5 μm, respectively) in Ca2+-free buffer to determine the increase in [Ca2+]i contributed by the emptying of internal Ca2+ stores. D, cells were pretreated with 1 μm ionomycin (final concentration) in Ca2+-free buffer and then incubated with 25 μm mLysoPC + OA for 15 min in the same medium, whereas in E, cells were pretreated with monensin (5 μm, final concentration) in addition to ionomycin in Ca2+-free buffer and then exposed to the lipid mixture. Lipid mixture was added at t = 0. F, the result of the same experiment performed in C on cells pretreated with 25 μm mLysoPC + OA for 15 min in Ca2+-free buffer. These traces refer to experiments performed on the same cell culture and are representative of three different sets of experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Last, but not least, it should be noted that neurons exposed to the lipid mixture in Ca2+-free buffer showed a higher response to ionomycin with respect to control neurons, and most bulges did not respond at all to monensin (Fig. 3, compare F with C). This latter observation suggests that, following exposure to the lipid mixture, there is an intracellular partition of fatty acids, which are known to act similarly to monensin and to quench transmembrane proton gradients (33Wojtczak L. Schonfeld P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1183: 41-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Intracellular acidic compartments, that under normal conditions cannot be emptied by ionomycin, become thus available to its action. Indeed, the same result was obtained when neurons were pretreated in Ca2+-free buffer with the protonophore carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl hydrazone, a well known quencher of transmembrane pH gradients (not shown).In order to investigate the nature of Ca2+ influx through the plasma membrane, neurons were incubated with the P/Q and N-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (VDCC) inhibitor ω-conotoxin MVIIC and with the L-channel inhibitor nimodipine. This treatment did not prevent the rise of [Ca2+]i caused by the lipid mixture, although a very small reduction in the rate of the Ca2+ increase was observed in some neurons treated with these VDCC inhibitors (Fig. 4, compare A and B). Using isolated neuromuscular junction preparations, whose VDCCs are well characterized and known to be effectively inhibited by ω-conotoxin MVIIC (34Wright C.E. Angus J.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 119: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we did not observe any change in the paralysis time induced by SPANs (not shown). Control experiments performed with neurons treated with these channel inhibitors and depolarized with 55 mm KCl showed about 50% reduction in the calcium influx (Fig. 4, compare C and D). Taken together, these results indicate that these synaptic VDCCs may contribute to the rise of [Ca2+]i induced by SPANs in primary cultures of neurons but are clearly dispensable. One possible explanation is that LysoPC + OA induces in cultured neurons a nonspecific increase in the membrane permeability for small molecules, as it was shown to occur for cultured vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells (35Leung Y.M. Xion Y. Ou Y.J. Kwan C.Y. Life Sci. 1998; 63: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus"

Nuclear import of GR occurs rapidly and is mediated through the importin α/β karyopherin import pathway. By contrast, nuclear export of GR occurs only slowly under most conditions, despite a dependence on active signaling. In this study we have defined a nuclear retention signal (NRS) in the hinge region of GR that actively opposes the nuclear export of GR as well as the nuclear export mediated through an ectopic CRM1-dependent nuclear export signal (NES).

Herrlich P. Schutz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). GR is a modular protein that features a central DNA binding domain (DBD) and a C-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD). Two activation functions (AF-1 and AF-2Gustafsson J.A. Carlstedt-Duke J. Wrange O. Okret S. Wikstrom A.C. J. Steroid Biochem. 1986; 24: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) are located in the N terminus and the LBD of the receptor, respectively (2Gustafsson J.A. Carlstedt-Duke J. Wrange O.

Cell. 1986; 46: 645-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). GR is directly and indirectly involved in both the activation and suppression of genes that are involved in cell differentiation, glucose uptake and homeostasis, inflammation, response to stress, neuronal function, lipid metabolism, and cancer (4Charmandari E. Kino T. Chrousos G.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1024: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 5Chrousos G.P. Charmandari E. Kino T. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation by GR is tightly controlled. The regulation of function by segregation in subcellular compartment has been proposed to act as an important regulatory checkpoint for a number of transcription factors, including steroid receptors (6Nguyen T. Sherratt P.J. Nioi P. Yang C.S. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32485-32492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 7Ghisletti S. Meda C. Maggi A. Vegeto E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2957-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Unlike other steroid receptors, such as estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor, that are nuclear in the absence of steroid, naive GR is largely cytoplasmic (8Picard D. Kumar V. Chambon P. Yamamoto K.R. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm GR is maintained in an inactive hsp90 cochaperone complex that includes hsp70, immunophilins, p23, and other factors (9Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, GR dissociates from the chaperone complex, homodimerizes, and rapidly translocates to the nucleus to regulate target gene expression (10Madan A.P. DeFranco D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3588-3592Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 11Sackey F.N. Hache R.J. Reich T. Kwast-Welfeld J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol.

Nuclear import of GR is accomplished through two nuclear localization signals as follows: NL1, located in a hinge-like region of GR that separates the DBD from the LBD; and NL2, which is within the LBD (13Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3333-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). NL1 is a basic NLS that mediates the nuclear import of GR through interaction with importin α and importin 7 (14Jewell C.M. Webster J.C. Burnstein K.L. Sar M. Bodwell J.E. Cidlowski J.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 55: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15Savory J.G. Hsu B. Laquian I.R. Giffin W. Reich T. Hache R.J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Cell.

NL2 is strictly steroid-dependent, and both the sequence within the LBD that includes NL2 and the karyopherins that determine NL2-mediated nuclear import remain to be identified. Using a mutant GR that lacks NL1 (GRNL1–), we have previously demonstrated that NL2 is an agonist-specific NLS that mediates the incomplete localization of GR to the nucleus in cells treated with cortisol or the synthetic steroid dexamethasone (15Savory J.G.

Furthermore, this reduced nuclear occupancy correlates with a strong decrease in GR transcriptional regulatory potential. Upon hormone withdrawal, GR reassociates rapidly into a cochaperone complex, but only slowly redistributes to the cytoplasm over periods that can extend over 12–24 h (11Sackey F.N. Hache R.J. Reich T. Kwast-Welfeld J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1191-1205PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hache R.J. Tse R. Reich T. Savory J.G. Lefebvre Y.A. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1279-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Furthermore, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), digitonin cell permeabilization, and other assays have shown that this slow export from the nucleus occurs for both liganded and steroid-withdrawn receptor (17Hache R.J.

The mechanism through which this slow transfer of GR from the cytoplasm to the nucleus is accomplished is not understood. For other transcription factors and nuclear proteins, export from the nucleus is accomplished when nuclear export signals (NESs) interact with karyopherins, collectively referred to as exportins (20Mosammaparast N. Pemberton L.F. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 547-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Most of the known NESs are composed of hydrophobic amino acid; however, they are highly diverse with only a loose consensus (21Fried H. Kutay U. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 1659-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 22Weis K. Cell. 2003; 112: 441-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The prototypical exportin for nuclear protein export is exportin1 or CRM1. CRM1 binds to short leucine- or isoleucine-rich sequences. CRM1 recognition of an NES requires the cooperative binding of RanGTP and is inhibited by leptomycin B (23Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar, 24Stade K. Ford C.S. Guthrie C. Weis K. Cell. 1997; 90: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). Previous studies from our group and other groups suggest that nuclear export of GR may be accomplished by both CRM1-dependent and -independent mechanisms (15Savory J.G. Hsu B. Laquian I.R. Giffin W. Reich T. Hache R.J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 25Liu J. DeFranco D.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 40-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Export of steroid-withdrawn GR from the nucleus has been found to be sensitive to leptomycin B treatment and thus is likely CRM-1-dependent, whereas export of liganded GR appears to occur independently of CRM1 (15Savory J.G. Hsu B. Laquian I.R. Giffin W. Reich T. Hache R.J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Recently we noted that a KKK-NNN substitution of amino acids 513–515 of rat GR within NL1 not only impaired NL1 activity but also led to an accelerated redistribution of GR to the cytoplasm upon the withdrawal of steroid treatment (15Savory J.G. Hsu B. Laquian I.R. Giffin W. Reich T. Hache R.J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This suggested that the GR NL1 either functioned directly as, or overlapped with, an active nuclear retention signal (NRS) for the receptor. Active retention of GR within the nucleus had been proposed previously to be an additional regulatory step for the receptor, and enhanced export of GR has been shown to reduce its transcriptional potential (26Kino T. Souvatzoglou E. De Martino M.U. Tsopanomihalu M. Wan Y. Chrousos G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25651-25656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Factors such as hsp90 and the 14-3-3σ protein have been suggested to promote nuclear and cytoplasmic retention of GR, respectively (26Kino T. Souvatzoglou E. De Martino M.U. Tsopanomihalu M. Wan Y. Chrousos G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25651-25656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 27Tago K. Tsukahara F. Naruse M. Yoshioka T. Takano K. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2004; 213: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, specific determinants on GR required for retention have not been defined. In this study we have sought to define the NRS activity in GR that overlaps with the receptor NL1 and to determine its relevance to GR function. Our findings indicate that the GR NRS overlaps closely with NL1 and can be partially separated in peptides. In-line replacement of across the hinge region of GR containing NL1 with the NLS region from the SV40 T antigen compromised NRS activity in full-length GR. Notably, this substitution strongly decreased the activation of a mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) reporter gene by GR without affecting the recruitment of GR to the MMTV promoter. Therefore, active retention of GR in the nucleus inhibits nuclear export and appears to play an important role in determining the transcriptional regulatory potential of the receptor. Cell Culture—COS-7 cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, nonessential amino acids, and sodium pyruvate. Cells were replated the day prior to transient transfection with FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) or Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), with transfections performed according to the manufacturers' recommendations.

Transfection was stopped after 16 h by adding 1 ml of phenol red-free media containing 20% fetal bovine serum. 16 h pre-FRAP, cells were withdrawn from serum. 1–2 h pre-FRAP, the cells were treated with 1 μm cortisol to induce nuclear localization of GR, and 20 μg/ml cycloheximide was added 1 h pre-FRAP to prevent synthesis of new protein over the course of the experiment. During FRAP, coverslips with cells were placed in a Bio-Rad FCS2 chamber system and maintained at 37 °C in cortisol- and cycloheximide-containing media, over the course of the experiment. Cells were imaged using 3% laser power on a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 microscope equipped with an argon-ion laser and LaserSharp software. Photobleaching of GFP was done at 100% laser power for 5–20 passes. Image analysis was performed using Image-J software (National Institutes of Health). Transcription Assays—COS-7 cells were transfected in triplicate with FuGENE (Roche Applied Science), as per the manufacturer's instructions, using 6–18 ng of GR expression vector, 250 ng of–237 MMTV-luciferase reporter, 25 ng of CMV-Renilla luciferase as an internal control, and sufficient pEGFP-C1 empty vector to bring the total DNA to 0.5 μg. Cells were treated with 10 nm dexamethasone for 16 h and lysed in Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega), and the luminescence was evaluated using a Lumistar luminometer. Activity was normalized to the CMV internal control and compared with fold induction of WT GR. All experiments were repeated independently a minimum of three times. Localization and Hormone Withdrawal Assays—COS-7 cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips in 6-well dishes. 16 h after plating the cells were transfected with 0.3 μg of DNA using Lipofectamine. Cells were withdrawn from serum for 16 h before treatment was initiated as described in individual experiments. Steroid withdrawal was accomplished by rinsing the cells five times for 5 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C and then transferring cells to serum- and phenol red-free media. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and mounted on slides with Vectashield 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining solution (Vector Laboratories). 100–200 cells were scored per slide in each experiment, using a Zeiss Axiovert microscope equipped with a xenon lamp to visualize GFP construct-containing cells. Each experiment was performed a minimum of three times in duplicate. In Vitro Binding Assays and Purification of Proteins—GST and NES-GST-GR constructs were produced with the TnT® quick-coupled transcription/translation systems (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine for NES-GST-GR proteins as per the manufacturer's instructions. One-third of the in vitro translated mixture was incubated with 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) in 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (binding buffer), rotated for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by three washes in binding buffer. CRM1 and RanQ69L were expressed and purified under native conditions as described previously (23Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar, 28Askjaer P. Jensen T.H. Nilsson J. Englmeier L. Kjems J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33414-33422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). For binding assays, 500 ng of CRM1 and 500 ng of GTP-loaded RanQ69L were incubated with NES-GST-GR proteins in binding buffer for 1 h at 4°C. The beads were then washed with binding buffer and resuspended in SDS buffer. Western Blotting—Whole cells lysates from transfected COS-7 cells in 60-mm dishes were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, and Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)). Protein yields were determined by the Bradford assay. Samples were separated on 6–10% SDS-acrylamide transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed with JL-8 Living Colors antibody (BD Biosciences). For the analysis of CRM1 binding to the GR-hinge constructs, eluted proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with anti-Exportin-1/CRM1 (BD Biosciences). The membrane was then dried, and radiolabeled GST fusion proteins were visualized by PhosphorImager. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIPs were performed essentially as described previously (29Wiper-Bergeron N. Wu D. Pope L. Schild-Poulter C. Hache R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2135-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with 10 nm dexamethasone for 60 min and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were then rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and washed sequentially with buffer I (0.25% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 6.5) and buffer II (200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 6.5). Cell pellets were resuspended and sonicated. Supernatants were collected and diluted, followed by immunoclearing with 4 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA, 65 μl of protein A-Sepharose slurry for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was performed with antibodies to Gal4 DBD, GR (M-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polymerase II (N-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-acetyl-histone 4 (Upstate) at 4 °C overnight. After immunoprecipitation, 45 μl of protein A-Sepharose and 2 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA were added, and the incubation was continued for another 1 h. Precipitates were washed and extracted three times in 100 μl of 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3. Eluates were kept at 65 °C overnight to reverse cross-links. DNA was purified and amplified by PCR using the following primers for the MMTV promoter: –270 and –247, +61 and +84. The Addition of a Strong NLS to the GRNL1– Receptor Fails to Reconstitute GR Nuclear Retention—We have previously shown that the redistribution of GR to the cytoplasm from the nucleus in COS7 cells following the withdrawal of steroid treatment occurs only very slowly, taking over 24 h for complete redistribution (15Savory J.G. Hsu B. Laquian I.R. Giffin W. Reich T. Hache R.J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). By contrast, the return of a GR containing a K513N/K514N/K515N substitution that inactivates NL1 (GRNL1–) was much more rapid, reaching completion within 2–4 h, albeit from a starting point in which the receptor was only 50–60% nuclear (15Savory J.G. Hsu B. Laquian I.R. Giffin W. Reich T. Hache R.J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). One simple potential explanation for this result is that the GR NL1 opposed nuclear export, although this is a property that has not been previously described for other NLSs. To test whether the addition to GRNL1– of a strong NLS alone would be sufficient to promote GR nuclear retention, we introduced the classical SV40 T antigen NLS sequence into a GFP GRNL1– construct between the N-terminal GFP and the GR (Fig. 1A, GFPSV40 GRNL1–). GFPSV40GRNL1– was cytoplasmic in its naive state prior to steroid treatment, and like WT GFPGR, it translocated rapidly and efficiently to the nucleus following treatment with the natural steroid cortisol (Fig. 1B, Cort) or the synthetic steroid dexamethasone (data not shown). By contrast, upon withdrawal of steroid treatment, which leads to rapid loss of bound ligand and reassociation of GR with the heat shock protein cochaperone complex (15Savory J.G. Hsu B. Laquian I.R. Giffin W. Reich T. Hache R.J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), redistribution of GFPSV40GRNL1– to the cytoplasm remained markedly accelerated compared with GFPGR, approaching the rate of redistribution seen for GFPGRNL1– (Fig. 1C). To directly determine whether this increased rate of redistribution of GFPSV40GRNL1– reflected an enhanced rate of nuclear export, we directly assessed the nuclear export rates of our constructs in live cells (Fig. 1, D and E). Our assay, which we have previously validated in detail (19Walther R.F. Lamprecht C. Ridsdale A. Groulx I. Lee S. Lefebvre Y.A. Hache R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37858-37864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), employs FRAP to study the movement of GFP-labeled proteins between nuclei in naturally multinucleated cells (for example, up to 10% of COS7 cells may contain more than one nucleus). As illustrated schematically in Fig. 1D, a fluorescent nuclear protein with a strong NLS that is undergoing rapid nuclear export will be seen to transfer from its original nucleus to its photobleached twin, with the rate of transfer reflecting 50% of the rate of export plus reimport (once in the cytoplasm, the protein could be reimported into either nucleus). As shown previously (19Walther R.F. Lamprecht C. Ridsdale A. Groulx I. Lee S. Lefebvre Y.A. Hache R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37858-37864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), liganded GFPGR redistributed only very slowly from the untreated nucleus to the photo-bleached nucleus in the presence of cortisol, such that little transfer was detected 1 h following photobleaching (Fig. 1E). By contrast, the liganded GFPSV40GRNL1–, which localized as strongly to the nucleus as GFPGR, displayed an accelerated rate of nucleo-cytoplasmic exchange comparable with that of GFPGRNL1–. Moreover, we observed the same result for the constructs remaining in the nucleus when FRAP was performed 30 min subsequent to cortisol withdrawal (data not shown). Together, these results indicated that the GR NL1 NLS overlaps with a nuclear retention activity that is distinct from a strong NLS, but which inhibits the export of GR from the nucleus. Furthermore, they suggested that the NRS activity inhibited both the CRM1-dependent and CRM1-independent nuclear export of GR. Amino Acids 500–525 of GR Contain an NRS That Overlaps Closely with NL1—The GR NL1 motif is localized to the hinge region of the receptor that separates the DBD and LBD of the receptor (13Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3333-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). To determine whether this region of GR was sufficient for NRS activity and to determine whether this activity could actively oppose nuclear export, we expressed variations of amino acids 500–525 of the GR hinge containing NL1 in the context of a GST-GFP fusion construct in which nuclear import was driven by the SV40 NLS and nuclear export mediated by the human immunodeficiency virus reverse CRM1-dependent nuclear export signal (Fig. 2A). In the first instance, a GSTGFP fusion protein containing the reversal of GR cDNA sequence that encodes hinge amino acids 500–525 (NESGSTGR525–500GFPNLS) was observed to move rapidly between nuclei in FRAP (Fig. 2B). Indeed, the rate of movement of NESGSTGR525–500GFPNLS was indistinguishable from that of a construct lacking a cDNA insert (data not shown and see Ref. 19Walther R.F. Lamprecht C. Ridsdale A. Groulx I. Lee S. Lefebvre Y.A. Hache R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37858-37864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A construct containing the K513N/K514N/K515N substitution in NL1 (NESGSTGR500–525NL1–GFPNLS) moved between nuclei with similar ease. By contrast, movement of the fusion protein containing the WT GR hinge was markedly retarded. Inhibition of nuclear export did not simply result from the presence of two strong NLSs on this construct as an NESGSTGRGFP construct lacking the SV40 NLS was also completely nuclear but similarly impaired in nuclear export (data not shown). The reduced nuclear export of the WT GR 500–525 construct appeared unlikely to reflect a substantial alteration of the interaction between the fusion proteins and CRM1, as all three constructs when translated in vitro showed the same ability to interact with GSTCRM1 in a pulldown assay (Fig. 2C). Next, in an attempt to distinguish between NL1 and the NRS within the GR sequence, we performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis within the GR hinge and measured the effect of these substitutions on nuclear export within the context of NES-GST-GR-GFP-NLS (Fig. 3). Two of the AAA substitutions made (510–512 and 507–508) appeared to have at least a modest effect on NRS activity at 30 min post-FRAP (Fig. 3B). However, only the 507–508 AA substitution (509 is already Ala in WT GR), which showed the most complete transfer at 30 min visually (Fig. 3B), also showed a significantly enhanced initial rate of transfer following FRAP compared with the WT GR hinge control (Fig. 3C). These results suggested that L507A/E508A substitution might substantially cripple NRS activity in full-length GR, which would then allow us to investigate the importance of NRS activity for GR function. GFPGR507,508AA was cytoplasmic in the presence of steroid and transferred rapidly to the nucleus upon cortisol or dexamethasone treatment in a"
https://openalex.org/W2074956094,"Background The adult mammalian retina is an important model in research on the central nervous system. Many experiments require the combined use of genetic manipulation, imaging, and electrophysiological recording, which make it desirable to use an in vitro preparation. Unfortunately, the tissue culture of the adult mammalian retina is difficult, mainly because of the high energy consumption of photoreceptors. Methods and Findings We describe an interphase culture system for adult mammalian retina that allows for the expression of genes delivered to retinal neurons by particle-mediated transfer. The retinas retain their morphology and function for up to six days— long enough for the expression of many genes of interest—so that effects upon responses to light and receptive fields could be measured by patch recording or multielectrode array recording. We show that a variety of genes encoding pre- and post-synaptic marker proteins are localized correctly in ganglion and amacrine cells. Conclusions In this system the effects on neuronal function of one or several introduced exogenous genes can be studied within intact neural circuitry of adult mammalian retina. This system is flexible enough to be compatible with genetic manipulation, imaging, cell transfection, pharmacological assay, and electrophysiological recordings."
https://openalex.org/W2035909582,"Background Host innate immunity contributes to malaria clinical outcome by providing protective inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-γ, and by shaping the adaptive immune response. Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) is the etiologic agent of the most severe forms of human malaria. Natural Killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes of the innate immune system that are the first effectors to produce interferon-γ in response to Pf. However, the molecular bases of Pf-NK cell recognition events are unknown. Our study focuses on the role of Pf erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1), a major Pf virulence factor. PfEMP1 is expressed on parasitized-erythrocytes and participates to vascular obstruction through the binding to several host receptors. PfEMP1 is also a pivotal target for host antibody response to Pf infection. Methodology/Principal Findings Using genetically-engineered parasite mutant strains, a human genetic deficiency, and blocking antibodies, we identified two receptor-ligand pairs involved in two uncoupled events occurring during the sensing of Pf infection by NK cells. First, PfEMP1 interaction with one of its host receptor, chondroitin sulfate A, mediates the cytoadhesion of Pf-infected erythrocytes to human NK cell lines, but is not required for primary NK cell activation. Second, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), another host receptor for PfEMP1, is mandatory for NK cell interferon-γ response. In this case, ICAM-1 acts via its engagement with its host ligand, LFA-1, and not with PfEMP1, consistent with the obligatory cross-talk of NK cells with macrophages for their production of interferon-γ. Conclusion/Significance PfEMP1-independent but ICAM-1/LFA-1-dependent events occurring during NK cell activation by Pf highlight the fundamental role of cellular cooperation during innate immune response to malaria."
https://openalex.org/W2085360136,"Neisseria meningitidis is a human pathogen that causes septicemia and meningitis with high mortality. The disease progression is rapid and much remains unknown about the disease process. The understanding of disease development is crucial for development of novel therapeutic strategies and vaccines against meningococcal disease. The use of bioluminescent imaging combined with a mouse disease model allowed us to investigate the progression of meningococcal sepsis over time. Injection of bacteria in blood demonstrated waves of bacterial clearance and growth, which selected for Opa-expressing bacteria, indicating the importance of this bacterial protein. Further, N. meningitidis accumulated in the thyroid gland, while thyroid hormone T4 levels decreased. Bacteria reached the mucosal surfaces of the upper respiratory tract, which required expression of the meningococcal PilC1 adhesin. Surprisingly, PilC1 was dispensable for meningococcal growth in blood and for crossing of the blood-brain barrier, indicating that the major role of PilC1 is to interact with mucosal surfaces. This in vivo study reveals disease dynamics and organ targeting during meningococcal disease and presents a potent tool for further investigations of meningococcal pathogenesis and vaccines in vivo. This might lead to development of new strategies to improve the outcome of meningococcal disease in human patients."
https://openalex.org/W2089837806,"The number of alveolar macrophages is decreased during Pneumocystis pneumonia (Pcp), partly because of activation of apoptosis in these cells. This apoptosis occurs in both rat and mouse models of Pcp. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids from Pneumocystis-infected animals were found to contain high levels of polyamines, including spermidine, N1-acetylspermine, and N1-acetylspermidine. These BAL fluids and exogenous polyamines were able to induce apoptosis in alveolar macrophages. Apoptosis of alveolar macrophages during infection, after incubation with BAL fluids from Pneumocystis-infected animals, or after incubation with polyamines was marked by an increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species, activation of caspases-3 and -9, DNA fragmentation, and leakage of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytoplasm. When polyamines were depleted from the BAL fluids of infected animals, the ability of these BAL fluids to induce apoptosis was lost. Interestingly, the apoptosis inducing activity of the polyamine-depleted BAL fluids was restored when polyamines were added back. The results of this study suggested that Pneumocystis infection results in accumulation of high levels of polyamines in the lung.

Immunol. 2003; 10: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This change may be due to decreased precursor cell recruitment or maturation, increased efflux of cells from the lung, increased apoptosis rate, or a combination of these factors. Apoptosis is a normal event in development or tissue turnover (22Sordet O. Rébé C. Plenchette S. Zermati Y. Hermine O. Vainchenker W. Garrido C. Solary E. Dubrez-Daloz L. Blood. 2002; 100: 4446-4453Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) and can also be a response to disease states or infectious agents (23Khelef N. Guiso N. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 134: 27-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Klingler K. Tchou-Wong K.M. Brandli O. Aston C. Kim R. Chi C. Rom W.N. Infect.

However, some infectious agents, especially those that survive and replicate inside host cells, inhibit apoptosis of the infected cells (26Balcewicz-Sablinska M.K. Keane J. Kornfeld H. Remold H.G. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2636-2641PubMed Google Scholar, 27Goebel S. Lüder C.G. Lugert R. Bohne W. Gross U. Tokai J. Exp. Clin. Med. 1998; 23: 351-356PubMed Google Scholar, 28Sukumaran S.K. Selvaraj S.K. Prasadarao N.V. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 6012-6022Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Apoptosis of cells occurs via two pathways, the extrinsic and the intrinsic. These two pathways are initiated through different stimuli and employ different cascades but are often both active (29Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3764) Google Scholar) and converge at the point of the caspase-3 protease activation. The extrinsic pathway is stimulated by the binding of ligands or specific antibodies to “death domain” receptors, including TNF-α receptors 1 or 2 (30Chen G. Goeddel D.V. Science. 2002; 296: 1634-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar), Fas (also called CD95 or APO-1), TRAIL-R1 and -R2, death receptor 3, and death receptor 6. The pro-apoptotic signals are transduced to the cytoplasm of the cell by adapter proteins that are recruited to the cytoplasmic portions of the death receptors. The bound adapter proteins then activate the first in a series of cytoplasmic proteases, the initiator caspases-8 and -10; they in turn activate downstream caspases, including executioner caspases-3, -6, and -7. These proteases lead to cell death by digesting crucial cell proteins.The intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway is activated by signals within the cell or by cleavage of Bid by the activated form of caspase-8 or -10 from the extrinsic pathway (29Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3764) Google Scholar). Other stimuli that may injure the mitochondrial membrane include polyamines or acetylpolyamine oxidase products (31Chaturvedi R. Cheng Y. Asim M. Bussière F.I. Xu H. Gobert A.P. Hacker A. Casero Jr., R.A. Wilson K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40161-40173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 32Stefanelli C. Stanić I. Zini M. Bonavita F. Flamigni F. Zambonin L. Landi L. Pignatti C. Guarnieri C. Caldarera C.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 875-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The damage to the mitochondrial membrane or the formation of pores by the pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family induces a change in the mitochondrial membrane potential and the impairment of mitochondrial respiration, causing leakage of pro-apoptotic factors, such as cytochrome c, from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm. Cytochrome c binds to Apaf-1, which in turn recruits and activates caspase-9 to form the apoptosome. Activation of the mitochondrial pathway also results in cleavage of caspase-3, with subsequent activation of the other executioner caspases, just as with the extrinsic pathway. Many infections and disease processes induce apoptosis of host cells. Pneumocystis may also enhance its survival by stimulating apoptosis in host alveolar macrophages.One possible trigger for apoptosis is increased polyamine levels. Polyamines are implicated in the initiation of apoptosis of several cell types, either through direct action (32Stefanelli C. Stanić I. Zini M. Bonavita F. Flamigni F. Zambonin L. Landi L. Pignatti C. Guarnieri C. Caldarera C.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 875-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) or via the reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as H2O2 (11Fraser I.P. Takahashi K. Koziel H. Fardin B. Harmsen A. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 1305-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) produced during the back-conversion of polyamines through the action of spermine and spermidine acetyltransferase (SSAT), spermine oxidase, and acetylpolyamine oxidase (APAO) (33Casero Jr., R.A. Pegg A.E. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). These factors upset the redox potential of the cytoplasm and cause mitochondrial membrane damage and leakage of pro-apoptotic factors. The primary polyamines putrescine, spermine, and spermidine are all implicated in initiation of apoptosis, but spermine and N1-acetylspermine are more often involved in the direct toxic effects of polyamines on the membrane potential of the mitochondria (32Stefanelli C. Stanić I. Zini M. Bonavita F. Flamigni F. Zambonin L. Landi L. Pignatti C. Guarnieri C. Caldarera C.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 875-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 34Stefanelli C.

Spermine can directly activate caspase-3 in macrophage-like cell lines (35Stefanelli C. Bonavita F.I. Pignatti C. Flamigni F. Guarnieri C. Caldarera C.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Polyamines can affect the activity of transcription factors such as NF-κB (36Shah N. Thomas T. Shirahata A. Sigal L.H. Thomas T.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14763-14774Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and AP-1 (37Kuramoto N. Inoue K. Gion K. Takano K. Sakata K. Ogita K. Yoneda Y. Brain Res. 2003; 967: 170-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), which in turn control the transcription of many other genes. Polyamines can also repress the transcription of genes through the stabilization of highly condensed chromatin (38Pollard K.J. Samuels M.L. Crowley K.A. Hansen J.C. Peterson C.L. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5622-5633Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).We hypothesized that alveolar macrophage numbers were reduced during Pcp because of increased apoptosis of these cells and that abnormally high levels of polyamines were a stimulus for this apoptosis. The results of this study indicated that alveolar macrophages from animals with Pcp underwent apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway, with mitochondrial damage and activation of caspases-3 and -9. Furthermore, polyamines were increased in the lungs of animals with Pcp, and exogenous polyamines induced apoptosis similar to that seen in Pcp. Finally, depletion of polyamines from BAL fluids of animals with Pcp suppressed their ability to induce ROS production and apoptosis of alveolar macrophages.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Antibodies to the activated form of caspases-3 and -9 and GAPDH were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). Procaspase-9 antibody was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Bleomycin, spermidine, spermine, N8-acetylspermidine, N1-acetylspermine, and all other chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma, except where noted. The purity of purchased polyamines was assessed by HPLC using the method of Merali (39Merali S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21017-21022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and was determined to be greater than 99% for each polyamine.Rodent Models of Pcp—Pneumocystis organisms for transtracheal inoculation were obtained from previously infected Sprague-Dawley rats or BALB/c mice. Lungs of infected animals were homogenized in a Tenbroeck homogenizer (Fisher). The homogenate was centrifuged for 3 min at 300 × g to remove large aggregates. The clarified supernatant was adjusted to 100 trophozoites per 1000× oil immersion field and used as the inoculum. Each immunosuppressed rat was transtracheally instilled with 200 μl of this inoculum (40Bartlett M.S. Fishman J.A. Queener S.F. Durkin M.M. Jay J.A. Smith J.W. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1988; 26: 1100-1102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas each mouse received 150 μl of inoculum with of 130 trophozoites per 1000× oil immersion field. The unused inoculum was slow-frozen in complete media (RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% FBS, 1 mm pyruvate, 1% nonessential amino acids, 14 mm glucose, 17.9 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin) containing 7% Me2SO. Only inoculum without bacterial or fungal contaminants, as assessed by culture, was instilled into animals. Frozen and fresh inoculum organisms were equally efficient at producing Pneumocystis infections.Three groups of Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Sprague-Dawley Inc.), 120–140 g in weight, were used as follows: Normal, immunocompetent and uninfected; Dex, immunosuppressed with 1.8 mg/liter dexamethasone in drinking water; and Dex-Pc, immunosuppressed and transtracheally inoculated with Pneumocystis.Female BALB/c mice (Harlan Sprague-Dawley Inc.), 18–20 g, were similarly immunosuppressed, except that 7.2 mg/liter dexamethasone in drinking water was given for 2 weeks prior to transtracheal inoculation of organisms (41Bartlett M.S. Queener S.F. Durkin M.M. Shaw M.A. Smith J.W. Diagn. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 1992; 15: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Dexamethasone-treated mice were referred to as Dex mice, and Pneumocystis-infected Dex mice were called Dex-Pc mice. Some mice were immunosuppressed by weekly intraperitoneal injection of anti-CD4 antibody (GK1.5) as described previously (42Bartlett M.S. Current W.L. Orazi A. Bauer N.L. Neiman R.S. Queener S.F. Smith J.W. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 1994; 1: 511-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Kolls J.K. Habetz S. Shean M.K. Vazquez C. Brown J.A. Lei D. Schwarzenberger P. Ye P. Nelson S. Summer W.R. Shellito J.E. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2890-2894PubMed Google Scholar). A pilot experiment was performed to determine the optimal dosage and duration of antibody treatment. The result indicated that 300 μg of the antibody achieved 95% depletion of CD4+ cells after a single injection as determined by flow cytometry. Transtracheal inoculation of mouse-derived Pneumocystis murina organisms (7.8 × 106) was carried out 5 days after initiation of anti-CD4 injections as described previously (41Bartlett M.S. Queener S.F. Durkin M.M. Shaw M.A. Smith J.W. Diagn. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 1992; 15: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 42Bartlett M.S. Current W.L. Orazi A. Bauer N.L. Neiman R.S. Queener S.F. Smith J.W. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 1994; 1: 511-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These immunosuppressed mice were called CD4-depleted (CD4-dep.), whereas Pneumocystis-infected CD4-dep. mice were referred to as CD4-Pc mice. All mice were given drinking water containing 0.5 mg/ml tetracycline from the time of their arrival to the end of the study.All animal studies described were approved by the Indiana University Animal Care and Use Committee. Experiments were carried out under the supervision of veterinarians. Animals were housed in the Indiana University Laboratory Animal Resource Center, an American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care approved facility.Analysis of Pneumocystis Pneumonia in Rats and Mice—Animals were allowed to develop Pneumocystis pneumonia over a period of 6–10 weeks. At the end of the study period, or when animals became agonal as assessed by veterinarians, they were sacrificed by injection of 0.8 ml/kg ketamine mixture (ketamine hydrochloride (80 mg/ml), atropine (0.38 mg/ml), and acepromazine (1.76 mg/ml)) and transection of the aorta. Giemsa-stained lung impression smears were used to assess trophozoite burden in infected animals. Trophozoites were counted in at least 20 random ×1000 microscopic fields for each sample. Cyst burdens were similarly determined from silver-stained impression smears. Results were expressed as averages ± S.D. for three independent experiments; each experiment used 8–10 animals of each condition.Isolation and Enumeration of Rat and Mouse Alveolar Macrophages from BAL Fluids—Alveolar macrophages were isolated from rats and mice as described previously (21Lasbury M.E. Durant P.J. Bartlett M.S. Smith J.W. Lee C.H. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 2003; 10: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 44Lasbury M.E. Durant P.J. Lee C.H. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 2003; 50: S637-S638Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Briefly, sterile, pyrogen-free 0.9% saline (7–9 ml for rats and 1 ml for mice per lavage) was instilled into and recovered from rat lungs via a 14-gauge or mouse lungs via a 16-gauge angiocath (BD Biosciences). A total of 100 ml of saline was recovered from each rat, whereas 10 ml of saline was recovered from each mouse. For isolation of alveolar macrophages, the lavage fluids were incubated on tissue culture plastic dishes for 45 min at 37 °C with 5% CO2, and the nonadherent cells were washed away with sterile PBS. The adhered cells were recovered from the surface by gentle tapping after incubation in 0.5 ml of ice-cold 5 mg/ml xylocaine in complete media for 15 min on ice (45Nielsen H. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Immunol. Scand. 1987; 95: 81-84Google Scholar). The recovered cells were washed in PBS and diluted as needed. The XTT in vitro toxicology kit (Sigma) was used to assess viability of isolated alveolar macrophages from rats and mice of all conditions according to the manufacturer's instructions. Alveolar macrophages were allowed to adhere to wells of a 96-well plate at a concentration of 50,000 cells/well. Fifty microliters of XTT reagent was then added, and absorbance at 450 nm was read. Normal alveolar macrophages were used as the control and assigned a viability of 100%. Results were presented as averages ± S.D. from five independent experiments using quadruplicate wells of each condition in each experiment. The viability of adherent cells from Normal rats and mice was generally greater than 96% by trypan blue exclusion. The purity of alveolar macrophages was greater than 97% as determined by anti-reactive macrophage antigen staining (21Lasbury M.E. Durant P.J. Bartlett M.S. Smith J.W. Lee C.H. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 2003; 10: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Urea Determination—To determine the dilution of the alveolar lining fluid (ALF) during bronchoalveolar lavage, urea was assayed in peripheral blood and in BAL fluids. Urea passes freely from blood to alveolar lining fluid and vice versa (46Rennard S. Basset G. Lecossier D. O'Donnell K. Pinkston P. Martin P. Crystal R. J. Appl. Physiol. 1986; 60: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar); therefore, concentrations in serum and ALF are equal. Five microliters of diluted serum (1:5 in H2O) or concentrated BAL fluid (2:1 by vacuum centrifugation) were incubated with the proprietary chromogenic, urea-complexing reagent of the urea assay kit (Biochain, Hayward, CA). Samples were read at 520 nm after a 20-min incubation at room temperature. Sample absorbance was divided by the absorbance of the urea standard supplied with the kit and then multiplied by the dilution of the sample and the concentration of the supplied standard (50 mg/dl). Urea concentration in serum was divided by that in BAL fluid to determine the dilution of the ALF. Results were presented as average dilution ± S.D. for three independent assays of each condition. Each independent assay included triplicate samples from at least two animals of each condition.Assessment of Caspase Activation—Alveolar macrophages were allowed to adhere to tissue culture plastic as described above, washed two times with PBS, and scraped in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysed cells were further sheared in a glass homogenizer for 20 strokes and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined using the Coomassie Plus reagent (Pierce). Ten micrograms of protein from alveolar macrophages of each condition was denatured in 6 μl of 4× Laemmli buffer (Invitrogen) by boiling for 10 min. The proteins in each sample were electrophoresed at 100 V on a 10% BisTris polyacrylamide gel (NuPAGE, Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked and then incubated with 1:5000 dilution of a rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody or anti-cleaved caspase-9 antibody in blocking buffer (100 mm TBST, 5% nonfat milk). After washing the blot in 100 mm TBST three times, an HRP-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000 dilution in blocking buffer; BD Biosciences) was added for 1 h. The blot was washed again and the activated caspase-3 or caspase-9 was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). To ensure even loading, the constitutively expressed GAPDH protein was assessed in an identical manner.TUNEL Assay—Alveolar macrophages from Normal rats (1 × 106) or mice (5 × 105) were allowed to adhere on a slide, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 25 min, washed twice in PBS for 5 min each, and permeabilized in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. After rinsing again in PBS, the slides were covered with equilibration buffer (200 mm potassium cacodylate, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.6, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5 mm cobalt chloride) for 5 min and then incubated with the biotinylated nucleotide mix (1:100) and terminal dexoynucleotide transferase (1:100) for 60 min at 37 °C from the DeadEnd colorimetric TUNEL assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). The slides were washed in 2× SSC for 15 min, rinsed in PBS, and then treated with 0.3% H2O2 for 5 min to inactivate the endogenous peroxidase activity. The H2O2 was washed off with PBS, and the slides were incubated in 100 μl of streptavidin-HRP (1:500) for 30 min. After washing in PBS to remove the excess streptavidin-HRP, the slides were incubated with diaminobenzidine substrate (1:50), diaminobenzidine chromagen (1:20), and 5 μl of H2O2 until the stain was visible. At least 300 alveolar macrophages were counted from each slide, and averages ± S.D. were obtained for at least 5 animals or 10 independent alveolar macrophage aliquots from each condition.Cytosolic Cytochrome c in Alveolar Macrophages—One million alveolar macrophages were tested for cytosolic cytochrome c levels using the Function ELISA cytochrome c kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). The macrophages, in 500 μl of lysis buffer (supplied with the kit), were homogenized in a glass pestle (20 strokes) and then centrifuged to pellet cellular debris. One hundred microliters of the supernatant was assessed by capture ELISA. The cellular extract was bound to a cytochrome c antibody attached to the ELISA plate, followed by reaction with a biotinylated detecting antibody to cytochrome c and with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The signal was detected by oxidation of trimethylbenzidine substrate by HRP, and the color produced was read at 450 nm on a Vmax kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Experimental values were converted to nanograms/ml using a cytochrome c standard curve. Averages ± S.D. were obtained from quadruple replicates in each assay of at least five separate experiments.Polyamine Determination—Spermine, spermidine, N1-acetylspermine, and N1-acetylspermidine levels in BAL fluids and alveolar macrophages were assessed. Briefly, BAL fluid samples or alveolar macrophages from animals were sonicated for a total of 2 min in 15-s intervals on ice. Nuclei and cell ghosts in the sonicated samples were removed by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 5 min. The clarified BAL fluids and alveolar macrophage cell lysates were boiled in a water bath for 2 min. The boiled samples were clarified by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 5 min, and the final supernatant was used for polyamine determination by HPLC using the AccQ.Fluor kit"
https://openalex.org/W2109790859,"ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 are aggrecanases responsible for the breakdown of cartilage aggrecan in osteoarthritis. Multiple ADAMTS-4 cleavage sites have been described in several matrix proteins including aggrecan, versican, and brevican, but no concise predictive cleavage motif has been identified for this protease. By screening a 13-mer peptide library with a diversity of 108, we have identified the ADAMTS-4 cleavage motif E-(AFVLMY)-X(0,1)-(RK)-X(2,3)-(ST)-(VYIFWMLA), with Glu representing P1. Several 13-mer peptides containing this motif, including DVQEFRGVTAVIR and HNEFRQRETYMVF, were shown to be substrates for ADAMTS-4. These peptides were found to be specific substrates for ADAMTS-4 as they were not cleaved by ADAMTS-5. Modification of these peptides with donor (6-FAM) and acceptor (QSY-9) molecules resulted in the development of fluorescence-based substrates with a Km of ∼35 μm. Furthermore, the role of Glu at P1 and Phe at P1′ in binding and catalysis was studied by exploring substitution of these amino acids with the d-isomeric forms. Substitution of P1 with dGlu was tolerable for binding, but not catalysis, whereas substitution of P1′ with dPhe precluded both binding and catalysis. Similarly, replacement of Glu with Asp at P1 abolished recognition and cleavage of the peptide. Finally, BLAST results of the ADAMTS-4 cleavage motif identified matrilin-3 as a new substrate for ADAMTS-4. When tested, recombinant ADAMTS-4 effectively cleaved intact matrilin-3 at the predicted motif at Glu435/Ala436 generating two species of 45 and 5 kDa.

Clark I. Kevorkian L. Edwards D. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). ADAMTS-2, -3, and -14 have been identified as procollagen N-proteinases. ADAMTS-13 maintains hemostasis through the proteolysis of von Willebrand factor following platelet binding. ADAMTS-7 and ADAMTS-12 have been shown to cleave cartilage oligomeric matrix protein. ADAMTS-1, -4, and -5 have been identified as proteoglycanases, cleaving aggrecan, versican, and brevican. ADAMTS-8, -9, -15, -16, and -18 also have been grouped in this family, but their activity toward aggrecan is substantially less compared with the other three members (2Collins-Racie L.A.

Gene knockout of ADAMTS-5, but not ADAMTS-4, expression in mice has been shown to be chondroprotective in a surgical mouse model of OA (6Glasson S. Sheppard B. Blanchet T. Carito B. Tavares J.

Tortorella M.D. Malfait A.M. Yang Z. Arner E.C. Griggs D.W. Arthritis Rheum. 2007; 56: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Inhibition of ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 activity may represent a viable option for slowing down the progression of cartilage deterioration in OA. Alignment of the known sequences flanking the ADAMTS-4 cleavage sites in the proteoglycan substrates, aggrecan, versican, and brevican, led to the proposal of a 24-amino acid consensus motif (9Sandy J. Westling J. Kenagy R. Iruela-Arispe M. Verscharen C. Rodriguez-Manzaneque J. Zimmermann D. Lemire J. Fischer J. Wight T. Clowes A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13372-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, a glutamic acid residue occupied P1 (100% conserved) with P2′ occupied by the basic amino acids, Arg or Lys. The authors speculated that activity of ADAMTS family members toward proteoglycan substrates was primarily dictated by an extended 23-amino acid motif N-terminal to the scissile bond, and a short 3-amino acid motif downstream of the site of cleavage. However, unlike the scissile bonds in the aggregating proteoglycans, the site of ADAMTS-4 proteolysis in α2-macroglobulin (α2M) is Met690/Gly691, with no requirement for Glu at P1 (10Tortorella M. Arner E. Hills R. Easton A. Korte-Sarfaty J. Fok K. Wittwer A. Liu R. Malfait A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17554-17561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Yet, P1′ to P3′ in α2M, Gly-Arg-Gly, is remarkably similar to downstream sequences in aggrecan and brevican, implying that P′ amino acids may be more important in recognition and catalysis than sequences upstream of the scissile bond. ADAMTS-4 has also been shown to undergo autocatalytic C-terminal truncation, producing 40- and 53-kDa species. Similar to α2M, Glu at P1 is not required for recognition and catalysis at these sites, with P1 comprised of Lys or Thr and P1′ and P2′ being Phe and Arg, respectively (11Flannery C. Zeng W. Corcoran C. Collins-Racie L. Chockalingam P. Hebert T. Mackie S. McDonagh T. Crawford T. Tomkinson K. LaVallie E. Morris E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42775-42780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The site of cleavage in cartilage oligomeric matrix protein has not been determined, except that a 110-kDa fragment is released upon treatment with ADAMTS-4 (12Dickinson S.C. Vankemmelbeke M.N. Buttle D.J. Rosenberg K. Heinegard D. Hollander A.P. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Because a relatively concise consensus motif for ADAMTS-4 catalysis has not been established, the assay of ADAMTS-4 activity has relied on the use of natural or recombinant forms of aggrecan, or peptides spanning the known sites of proteolysis in aggrecan of no less than 27 amino acids in length (13Miller J. Liu R. Davis G. Pratta M. Trzaskos J. Copeland R. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 314: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Detection of the proteolytic products then must rely on HPLC or the use of anti-neoepitope antibodies such as the monoclonal antibody BC-3, which recognizes the neoepitope ARGS located on the C-terminal fragment arising from proteolysis at Glu373/ Ala374 in the interglobular domain of aggrecan (14Hughes C.E. Caterson B. Fosang A.J. Roughley P.J. Mort J.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 799-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Due to the size of the substrates and the time period of incubation (0.5 to 2 h), kinetic analysis of protease activity is cumbersome at best. Peptide phage display has been demonstrated to be a valid means of determining the consensus motifs for a number of proteases including MMP-11 (15Pan W. Arnone M. Kendall M. Grafstrom R. Seitz S.

Motifs derived from such an analysis have been shown to be physiologically relevant and used to determine preferred as well as possible alternate protease substrates. The peptides identified have also found utility as substrates suitable for kinetic analysis of protease activity. In this report we, 1) describe the screening of a 108 random 13-mer peptide phage library, resulting in the determination of a 7-amino acid cleavage motif for ADAMTS-4; 2) demonstrate that this motif is specific for ADAMTS-4 and peptides based on this motif are poor substrates for ADAMTS-5; 3) confirm the importance of the P1 glutamic acid in catalysis and substrate recognition; 4) describe the development of a novel fluorogenic peptide substrate and kinetic assay amenable to high throughput screening of ADAMTS-4 inhibitors; and 5) report the results of a BLAST search of the cleavage motif, revealing matrilin-3 as a substrate of ADAMTS-4. Expression and Purification of ADAMTS-4—Full-length recombinant human ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 were cloned and expressed in Drosophila Sf9 cells as previously described (18Abbaszade I. Liu R.Q. Yang F.

The purified ADAMTS-4 preparation was composed almost solely of the 70-kDa active form. Activity was assessed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent activity assay employing a 36-mer peptide, spanning the site of proteolysis in the interglobular domain of aggrecan, and labeled at the C-terminal with biotin. Upon cleavage of the peptide substrate, the C-terminal proteolytic fragment was detected by BC-3 monoclonal antibody, recognizing the sequence ARGS (13Miller J. Liu R. Davis G. Pratta M. Trzaskos J. Copeland R. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 314: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Purified ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 were formulated at a final concentration of 20 nm in 100 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 10 μm CaCl2, 0.05% Brij, pH 7.5 (MMP buffer), and stored at –80 °C. Peptide Phage Display—A substrate phage library containing 108 polypeptide sequences displaying 13 amino acids of randomized sequence equimolar at each position for all amino acids except cysteine was constructed at Dyax Corp. (Cambridge, MA) (36Ley, C. A., Luneau, C. J., and Ladner, R. C. (June 19, 2001) U. S. Patent 6,906,176Google Scholar). N-terminal to each displayed randomized sequence were two streptavidin-binding peptide sequences. If the associated randomized peptide sequence was a substrate for ADAMTS-4, these streptavidin-binding epitopes would be cleaved from the phage particle. Non-substrate phage clones that retained the streptavidin-binding epitopes would then be captured by streptavidin-coated surfaces. Initially the library was buffer exchanged in Reaction Buffer by incubating a total of 1012 phage in 500 μl of TBS (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) plus 1× Roche Complete protease inhibitors minus EDTA (Roche) with 2 mg of streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynal M280, Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature in a total volume of 200 μl. The beads were washed 7 times with TBST (TBS, 10% Triton X-100, 10% Tween) and once with TNT (5 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 10% Triton X-100, pH 7.5). Phage were then eluted from the beads with 200 μl of 15 μm biotin in TNT for 1 h at room temperature, followed by precipitation with 50 μl of 20% PEG8000, 3.5 m NH4OAc for 1 h on ice. The phage were then resuspended with 500 μl of Reaction Buffer containing 1× protease inhibitors and incubated with 1.1 nm ADAMTS-4 for 1 h at room temperature. Uncleaved phage were removed using 5 mg of streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. Cleaved phage released into the supernatant, and not captured by the beads, were amplified and purified to provide 1012 phage for further processing through four rounds of selection. Screening was performed using 96-well plates coated with streptavidin (Pierce) and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. Individual phage clones were incubated with ADAMTS-4 in Reaction Buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. Treated and untreated phage were then transferred to streptavidin plates and incubated for 1 h at room temperature, washed 5 times with PBST (phosphate-buffered saline, 10% Tween), and bound phage were assayed by incubation with an antiphage antibody (anti-M13-horseradish peroxidase, GE Healthcare) and developed with TMB peroxidase substrate (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD). Peptide Sequence Analysis and Motif Generation—A multiple alignment of the peptide sequences was produced with the ClustalW program (20Thompson J.D. Higgins D. Gibson T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar) using the BLOSUM-30 matrix (21Henikoff S. Henikoff H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10915-10919Crossref PubMed Scopus (4227) Google Scholar). The Pratt motif discovery program was used to identify the conserved patterns in the aligned epitope sequences (22Brazma A. Jonassen I. Ukkonen E. Vilo J. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1996; 4: 34-43PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide sequence logo figures (23Schneider T.D. Stephens R.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6097-6100Crossref PubMed Scopus (2381) Google Scholar) were generated by the local implementation of the WebLogo package (24Crooks G.E. Hon G. Chandonia J.M. Brenner S.E. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1188-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (7851) Google Scholar). Assay of Proteolytic Activity—Peptides and peptide arrays were either synthesized in house or purchased from New England Peptide (Waltham, MA), or Jerini AG (Berlin, Germany) and were not less than 95% pure. Proteolysis and identification of the scissile bond of substrate peptides was determined by incubating a 10 μm solution of the peptide with 400 pm ADAMTS-4 or ADAMTS-5 for 18 h at 37 °C. 5 μl of each digest was analyzed by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) on a 75 μm × 150-mm Pepmap column (LC Packings, San Francisco, CA) coupled to a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Micromass, Beverly, MA). No prior knowledge of peptide mass was needed. Spectra were acquired in MS mode and MS/MS mode at 1 s/scan. Where MS was not required, 90 μl of each digest was analyzed by RP-HPLC on a 4.6 × 150-mm Vydac C-18 column (The Separations Group, Hesperia, CA) with detection at 214 nm. Direct kinetic fluorescent analysis of peptide turnover was determined using 6-Fam/QSY-9 (6-carboxyfluorescein, QSY-9-maleimide, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) fluorescently quenched peptides detailed in Tables 3 and 4. Briefly, a 1 μm solution of peptide in MMP buffer was incubated with 400 pm ADAMTS-4 or ADAMTS-5 at 37 °C in a total volume of 100 μl. Fluorescence at 519 nm was monitored over a 60-min period with excitation of 495 nm.TABLE 3Synthetic peptides based on peptide B05 identified from the screenAc-HNEFRQRETYMVF-NH2KHNEFRQRETYMVFKGKKHNDFRQRETYMVFKGKKHN(e)FRQRETYMVFKGKEFRQRETYMVFKGKK(6-Fam)-HNEFRQRETYMVFC(Qsy-9)-KGK Open table in a new tab TABLE 4Blast results of motif E-(AFVLMY)-X(0,1)-(RK)-X(2,3)-(ST) for extracellular matrix-relevant proteinsProteinSequence(s)Cartilage homeoprotein 1300-307: EFeRrssSCartilage matrix protein precursor (matrilin-1)292-299: ELvKkfiS418-424: EL.ReiaSMatrilin-2 precursor22-27: EA.Rer.S672-679: EVvKqfvT931-936: EV.Rkl.TMatrilin-3 precursor98-104: EFtKvk.T435-442: EArRlvsTMatrilin-4 precursor532-538: EL.ReiaSChondroadherin precursor (cartilage leucine-rich protein)137-144: ELpRgllSCartilage intermediate layer protein 1 precursor302-308: EFvRae.TCartilage intermediate layer protein 2 precursor677-683: EAlKlw.S Open table in a new tab Proteolysis of Matrilin-3 by ADAMTS-4—Recombinant human matrilin-3 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and reconstituted in MMP buffer at a concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. One μg of matrilin-3 (750 nm) was incubated with 1.5 nm ADAMTS-4 in a total volume of 25 μl at 37 °C. N-terminal protein sequencing was performed by automated Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems model 494 Procise sequencer. The digests were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE), transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and stained with Coomassie Blue. The bands of interest were excised and placed into the blot cartridge of the sequencer and the samples were run using blot cycles. Model 610A version 2.1 software was employed for data acquisition and processing. SC81956 (s)-2-dimethylamino-N-hydroxy-3,3-dimethyl-4-[(4-phenoxyphenyl)sulfonyl]butanamide) was synthesized at Pfizer and is a potent nanomolar inhibitor of both ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5. ADAMTS-4 Fails to Cleave a Commercially Available Peptide Substrate Array—A commercial peptide array comprised of 360 fluorescently quenched peptides of 8 amino acids in length, bearing known proteolytic consensus motifs (Jerini AG) was screened for ADAMTS-4 activity. No ADAMTS-4 specific cleavage of the 360 peptides was detected, demonstrating narrow substrate specificity for ADAMTS-4 (data not shown). Peptide Phage Display Yields 50 Unique Sequences Cleaved by ADAMTS-4—In that a small peptide substrate for ADAMTS-4 had not been identified using existing commercial peptide arrays, and that truncation of longer peptides based on sequences spanning the sites of proteolysis found in aggrecan failed to identify a shorter peptide amenable for using quench/fluorescent-based substrates for kinetic analysis of proteolytic activity, it was reasoned that a larger peptide library composed of random sequences could identify short peptides cleaved by ADAMTS-4. ADAMTS-4 was screened against a peptide phage library comprised of ∼108 random 13-amino acid peptides equal-molar for all 20 amino acids except cysteine. This library was screened for peptides that could be cleaved by ADAMTS-4 after binding streptavidin immobilized on polystyrene magnetic beads. Non-cleaved phage was removed by serial incubation with streptavidin beads and the cleaved phage amplified for the next round of selection. After the third and fourth rounds of selection, 96 randomly picked clones were screened for peptide cleavage by phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The phage clones cleaved in the shortest time of incubation were considered preferred substrates. Fifty unique substrate phage clones that gave the best cleavage were identified and aligned using the ClustalW algorithm (20Thompson J.D. Higgins D. Gibson T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar). This multiple alignment was then analyzed by the Pratt motif discovery program to identify possible amino acid sequence motifs. After identification of the major motif, the sequences were manually realigned by introducing another gap into some members to maximize the multiple alignments and increase the sensitivity of detecting other important contextual amino acids (Table 1). After manual re-alignment and re-analysis it was determined that E-(AFVLMY)-X(0,1)-(RK)-X(2,3)-(ST)-(VYIFWMLA) was the predominant motif. As expected, Glu is the most important amino acid in the ADAMTS-4 consensus motif and if we assume that Glu is P1 (based on the fact that Glu is P1 in the 5 cleavage sites in aggrecan), then each amino acid can be assigned a position. After Glu, the next most important amino acid for recognition is Arg or Lys (basic amino acids) at P2′/P3′ followed by Thr or Ser (alcohol containing amino acids) at P5′/P6′/P7′.TABLE 1Multiple sequence alignment of the ADAMTS-4 epitope sequences with corresponding average percentage of phagemid cleavage and the derived ADAMTS-4 cleavage motif Open table in a new tab Peptides Identified from Phage Library Are Specific for ADAMTS-4 and Amenable to Kinetic Analysis of Activity—All 50 peptides identified from the peptide phage screen were synthesized and analyzed for ADAMTS-4-mediated cleavage by RP-HPLC. Two peptides that displayed the greatest turnover were peptides B05 (HNEFRQRETYMVF) and B06 (DVQEFRGVTAVIR) (Table 1). LC/MS/MS analysis of peptide B06 was carried out following digestion with ADAMTS-4. Fig. 1 shows the results for peptide B06 with two peptide peaks being identified. After ADAMTS-4 cleavage, one peak with a retention time of 12.151 min was identified as non-cleaved B06, whereas the peak eluting at 11.158 min was identified as the C-terminal fragment of B06 arising from cleavage at Glu/Phe (Fig. 1). The N-terminal fragment was not resolved. Incubation of this same peptide with ADAMTS-5 failed to produce a cleaved product, and only full-length B06 was detected by LC/MS/MS (data not shown). Similarly, no cleavage products were detected for the remaining 48 peptides when assayed with ADAMTS-5, as determined by RP-HPLC. Of the 50 peptides identified from the phage screen, only a subset of the synthesized peptides were analyzed by LC/MS/MS to determine the scissile bond, namely peptides B05, B06, B07, and A08 as well as a peptide based solely on the identified cleavage motif where X-residues were replaced with Ala (data not shown). Fluorescently quenched versions of B06 and B05 were synthesized using 6-Fam and QSY-9. To increase the solubility of each peptide, the N- and C-terminals were not capped, and amino acids KGK were added to the C terminus, K(6-Fam)-DVQEFRGVTAVIRC(Qsy-9)-KGK (Table 2, peptide 6) and K(6-Fam)-HNEFRQRETYMVFC(Qsy-9)-KGK (Table 3, peptide 6), respectively. Both peptides were found to give a maximal rate of fluorescence increase at a concentration of 1 μm with an ADAMTS-4 concentration of ∼400 pm. Peptide concentrations above 1 μm exhibited an inner filter effect, and the fluorescent yield dropped proportionately with increasing peptide concentration. Following a 10-min equilibration of peptide B06 to allow the sample to warm to 37 °C, a linear increase in fluorescence was detected for the first 40 min upon addition of ADAMTS-4 (Fig. 2). A slight increase in substrate conversion was noted from 40 to 60 min, indicated by the slight upward curvature of the activity trace possibly due to enhanced solubility of the peptide over time at this temperature. ADAMTS-5 failed to cleave peptide B06, and therefore did not generate a fluorescent signal above background. Similar data were obtained with peptide B05 for both ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 (data not shown).TABLE 2Synthetic peptides based on peptide B06 identified from the screenAc-DVQEFRGVTAVIR-NH2Ac-DVQDFRGVTAVIR-NH2Ac-DVQ(e)FRGVTAVIR-NH2Ac-DVQE(f)RGVTAVIR-NH2Ac-DVQ(e)(f)RGVTAVIR-NH2K(6-Fam)-DVQEFRGVTAVIRC(Qsy-9)-KGK Open table in a new tab Km values for the 6-Fam/QSY-9 derivatives of B05 and B06 could not readily be determined. Although these peptides were significantly more soluble than the non-fluorescent versions because of the addition of the KGK tails, solubility above 100 μm was not achievable, and thus meaningful substrate curves could not be generated. Km values could be approximated using the non-fluorescent versions in competition with the 6-Fam/QSY-9 derivatives. The IC50 of the “cold” peptides, Ac-NEFRQRETYMVF-NH2 (Table 3, peptide 1) for B05, and Ac-DVQEFRGVTAVIR-NH2 (Table 2, peptide 1) for B06, were calculated to be ∼35 μm (Fig. 3). As to whether this value represents the true Km for each peptide, it must be stressed that the competing peptides were significantly different in that they lacked the 6-Fam and QSY-9 labels, as well as the C-terminal KGK extension to aid solubility; therefore, the true Km could be higher. A1 μm solution of fluorescently quenched peptide B06 was incubated with 400 pm ADAMTS-4 for 1 h at 37 °C. Approximately 31% of the peptide was hydrolyzed in this 1-h period, yielding a velocity of 310 nm/h. The turnover rate of ADAMTS-4 for this peptide substrate was calculated to be 0.22 s–1. Because the peptide concentration was significantly less than the estimated Km for this peptide, kcat/Km could be calculated directly and was found to be 215,000 m–1 s–1. Similar analysis of fluorescently quenched peptide B05 yielded a kcat/Km value of 160,000 m–1 s–1 for ADAMTS-4 (data not shown). Substitution of P1 and P1′ with d-Isomeric Amino Acids—To gain a better understanding of peptide binding/catalysis by ADAMTS-4, the stereochemistry of P1 and P1′ of peptide B06 was modified. Three peptides were synthesized, containing dGlu at P1 (Table 2, peptide 3), dPhe at P1′ (Table 2, peptide 4), or dGlu at P1 with dPhe at P1′ (Table 2, peptide 5). These peptides were assayed in competition with the 6-Fam/QSY-9 fluorescently quenched peptide B06 (Table 2, peptide 6). Interestingly, the dGlu-modified peptide (Table 2, peptide 3) was able to compete and inhibit cleavage of the fluorescent peptide substrate, displaying an IC50 of ∼10 μm (Fig. 4). The modified peptide containing dPhe at P1′ (Table 2, peptide 4) was shown to be unfavorable, in that competition with the fluorescent substrate was not detected, indicating that the peptide does not bind the active site of ADAMTS-4. Similarly, substitution of P1 and P1′ with dGlu and dPhe, respectively (Table 2, peptide 5), was also unfavorable, in that this peptide was unable to compete and inhibit cleavage of the fluorescent substrate. To confirm that the dGlu containing peptide is a competitive, non-cleavable peptide inhibitor of ADAMTS-4, reverse phase chromatographic analysis of peptide Ac-DVQ(e)FRGVTAVIR-NH2 was performed (Table 2, peptide 3). Following incubation with ADAMTS-4 for 18 h, no cleavage of the scissile bond was detected, demonstrating that the orientation of the Glu at P1 is critical for catalysis (data not shown). Similar results were obtained for the P1 dGlu variant of peptide B05 (Table 3, peptide 4); the d-isomeric peptide was able to compete for substrate binding with an IC50 of 8 μm, but was not cleaved by ADAMTS-4 (data not shown).

PAPP-A cleaves IGFBP-4 and IGFBP-5, whereas PAPP-A2 cleaves only IGFBP-5. The pappalysins contain three Lin12-Notch repeat (LNR1–3) modules, previously considered unique to the Notch receptor family in which they function to regulate receptor cleavage. In contrast to the Notch receptor where three LNR modules are tandemly arranged, LNR3 is separated by more than 1000 residues from LNR1–2 in the pappalysin sequence. Each of the three LNR modules of PAPP-A is required for proteolysis of IGFBP-4, but not IGFBP-5. However, we here find that a C-terminal truncated variant of PAPP-A, which lacks LNR3 and therefore activity against IGFBP-4, cleaves IGFBP-4 when co-expressed with a PAPP-A variant, which is mutated in the active site. This suggests that LNR3 from the inactive subunit interacts in trans with LNR1–2 of the truncated PAPP-A subunit to form a functional trimeric LNR unit. We also show that formation of such a functional LNR unit depends on dimerization, as dissociation of a mutated non-covalent PAPP-A dimer results in reduced activity against IGFBP-4, but not IGFBP-5. Using PAPP-A/PAPP-A2 chimeras, we demonstrate that PAPP-A2 LNR1–2, but not LNR3, are functionally conserved with respect to IGFBP proteolysis. Additionally, we find that a sequence stretch C-terminal to LNR3 and single residues (Asp1521, Arg1529, and Asp1530) within this are required for LNR functionality.

The pappalysins also contain three Lin12-Notch repeat (LNR) modules, previously considered unique to the Notch receptor family. But in contrast to the Notch receptors, which invariably contain three tandemly arranged LNR modules, two of the LNR modules of the pappalysins (LNR1–2) are located together within the sequence of the proteolytic domain, and the third (LNR3) is located C-terminal to the CCP modules, separated by more than 1000 residues from LNR1–2. In the Notch receptor, several studies indicate that the LNR modules are involved in the regulation of ligand-induced receptor cleavage by metzincin metalloproteinases of the ADAM family (21Brou C.

This cleavage is critical for the subsequent intramembrane processing of the receptor by γ-secretase and hence Notch signaling (23Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Saxena M.T. Griesemer A. Tian X. Pan D.J.

Although the underlying mechanism is unknown, mutation or deletion of the LNR modules has been found to cause ligand-independent cleavage of the Notch receptor (25Rand M.D. Grimm L.M.

Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1993; 74: 319-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 28Kopan R. Schroeter E.H. Weintraub H. Nye J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1683-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). It is therefore believed that the LNR modules function to restrain access to the cleavage site when ligand is not bound and that receptor ligand binding relieves this effect. Recent data demonstrated that each of the three LNR modules is required for PAPP-A proteolysis of IGFBP-4, but not IGFBP-5 (29Boldt H.B. Kjaer-Sorensen K. Overgaard M.T. Weyer K. Poulsen C.B.

It was therefore speculated that the three LNR modules of PAPP-A, although separated in the primary structure, interact with each other to determine PAPP-A substrate specificity. We here report data suggesting that within the disulfide-linked PAPP-A homodimer, such a functional LNR unit is formed in trans by the interaction between LNR1–2 of one subunit and LNR3 of the other subunit. By means of PAPP-A/PAPP-A2 chimeras, we show that the LNR1–2 modules, but not LNR3, are functionally conserved. We also identify a region C-terminal to LNR3, and several charged residues within this region, as critical for PAPP-A LNR functionality.

Antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 0.01% Tween 20 (PBST) and 1% bovine serum albumin. PBST was used for washing. A double monoclonal ELISA was used for detection of the PAPP-A dimer. In this assay, plates were coated with mAb 234-5 and sample incubation (100 μl containing 25 nm of PAPP-A or PAPP-A mutant) was followed by incubation (1 h at 37 °C) with PBS to which 0–1 m NaCl was added. Biotinylated mAb 234-5, followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated avidin (P0347, DAKO), was used for detection. Washing after incubation with peroxidase-conjugated avidin was carried out using PBST supplemented with 200 mm NaCl to avoid nonspecific binding.

Briefly, reactions (total sample volume of 20 μl) were carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5, at an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:160 (0.1 nm proteinase and 16 nm substrate), in the presence (IGFBP-4) or absence (IGFBP-5) of 50 nm IGF-II (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories). Following incubation for 2 h at 37 °C, reactions were stopped by addition of 10 mm EDTA and stored at –20 °C. Cleavage products were separated by 10–20% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. The degree of cleavage was determined by quantification of band intensities using a Typhoon imaging system (Amersham Biosciences), and background levels (mock signal) were subtracted. The degree of cleavage by wild-type PAPP-A under these conditions (2 h incubation) was ∼60%. The affect on proteolysis of PA(1133–1547) was analyzed by the addition of ∼100 nm to the reaction. To assay the proteolytic activity of dissociated wild-type PAPP-A or the PA(C381A/C652A/C1130A) mutant dimer, a 96-well plate coated with mAb 234-5 was incubated (1 h at 37 °C) with 100 μl of culture medium containing 25 nm proteinase, washed in PBST, and incubated (1 h at 37 °C) with PBS with or without an additional 0.5 m NaCl. Following washing and equilibration in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5, reaction mixtures containing radiolabeled substrate (as described above) were added directly to the wells (total sample volume of 50 μl). After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C, 10 μl of reaction sample was stopped by the addition of 10 mm EDTA and stored at –20 °C. When assaying the IGFBP-4 proteolytic activity of PAPP-A/PAPP-A2 chimeric proteins, proteinase levels were adjusted to have the same activity against IGFBP-5 (40% cleavage after 2 h incubation), and were tested for IGFBP-4 proteolytic activity by time course experiments (reaction mixtures as described above using a total sample volume of 70 μl). Samples of 10 μl were stopped (as described above) at each time point (from 0 to 24 h). The initial cleavage rate of the chimeras was determined as the inclination of the linear phase of curves from the IGFBP-4 time course experiments (% cleavage of IGFBP-4 plotted as a function of time), and plotted relative to the wild-type PAPP-A IGFBP-4 cleavage rate. Chemical Cross-linking—Proteins contained in serum-free culture medium (∼20 μg/ml) and dialyzed against 50 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, were incubated with 0.05 or 0.5 mm EGS (ethylene glycolbis(succinimidyl succinate), Pierce) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) for 30 min at room temperature. Samples (30 μl) of the reaction mixtures were quenched with 5 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, 1 m glycine, pH 7.5, and mixed with SDS-PAGE loading buffer with reductant (20 mm dithiothreitol). Cross-linked adducts were separated by 5–15% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Western blotting as described above. Size Exclusion Chromatography—Samples (600 μl) of PAPP-A wild-type and the PAPP-A C381A/C652A/C1130 mutant contained in diluted (1:2) culture medium were loaded onto a Superose 6 10/300 GL column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5. The flow rate was 0.3 ml/min and 0.3-ml samples were collected. The amount of protein contained in each fraction was measured by ELISA (as described above). Native PAGE—Proteins were loaded on a native 5–10% Tris glycine gels (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) prepared without SDS, electrophoresed for 3 h at 10 mA, and visualized by Western blotting as described above using an anti-c-Myc antibody (mAb 9E10) as primary antibody and secondary peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (P260, DAKO). To allow detection of PAPP-A by anti-c-Myc mAb, PA-P2(1529–1547), containing PAPP-A2 residues 1550–1558 followed by the c-Myc epitope in the C terminus was used. Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—Surface plasmon resonance experiments were carried out on a BIAcore T100 instrument (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) using series S CM5 sensor chips and coupling reagents supplied by the manufacturer. Immobilization of anti-c-Myc (9E10) was performed by first activating the surface of the sensor chip with a mixture of coupling reagents EDC/NHS followed by injection of purified mAb 9E10 (30 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0) at 25 °C. Remaining activated groups were blocked by 1 m ethanolamine. The level of mAb 9E10 immobilization corresponded to 10,000 resonance units. Purified c-Myc-tagged IGFBP-4 (3Laursen L.S. Overgaard M.T.

Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, α-actinin-1, a major F-actin cross-linking protein, was identified as a binding partner for the C-terminal domain of metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5b (mGlu5b receptor). Co-expression, co-immunoprecipitation, and pull-down experiments showed a close and specific interaction between mGlu5b receptor and α-actinin-1 in both transfected HEK-293 cells and rat striatum. The interaction of α-actinin-1 with mGlu5b receptor modulated the cell surface expression of the receptor. This was dependent on the binding of α-actinin-1 to the actin cytoskeleton. In addition, the α-actinin-1/mGlu5b receptor interaction regulated receptor-mediated activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Together, these findings indicate that there is an α-actinin-1-dependent mGlu5b receptor association with the actin cytoskeleton modulating receptor cell surface expression and functioning.

Together, these findings indicate that there is an α-actinin-1-dependent mGlu5b receptor association with the actin cytoskeleton modulating receptor cell surface expression and functioning. Glutamate and aspartate are the major excitatory neuro-transmitters in the mammalian central nervous system (1Mayer M.L. Westbrook G.L. Prog. Neurobiol. 1987; 28: 197-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar, 2Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). These excitatory amino acids act on glutamate receptors and play an important role in many physiological functions, including learning, memory, and development (3Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 521-527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Glutamate receptors are widely distributed in the central nervous system and include three subtypes of ionotropic glutamate receptors (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid, NMDA, 3The abbreviations used are: NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartic acid; mGlu, metabotropic glutamate; PSD, postsynaptic density; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CAMKII, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; CaR, calcium-sensing receptor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; MEKK, MEK kinase. and kainate receptors) and a family of G protein-coupled metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors that act through different second messenger pathways. Eight members of the mGlu receptor family have been identified and categorized into three subgroups on the basis of their sequence homology, agonist selectivity and signal transduction pathway. Group I contains the mGlu1 and mGlu5 receptor subtypes, which are coupled to phospholipase C in transfected cells and have quisqualic acid as their most potent agonist (4Pin J.P. Duvoisin R. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). The mGlu5 receptor is expressed in two splice variants, mGlu5a and mGlu5b, which differ in that mGlu5b has a 33-amino acid insert in the intracellular C-terminal domain. Interestingly, both subtypes of mGlu5 are heavily expressed in striatum with the consideration that mGlu5b might be considered as an “adult” variant and mGlu5a is more a “neonatal” variant (5Romano C. Smout S. Miller J.K. O'Malley K.L. Neuroscience. 2002; 111: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The actin-based cytoskeleton is connected to the plasma membrane via a lattice-like network of actin-binding proteins that form the membrane skeleton or membrane-associated cytoskeleton (6Bennett V. Gilligan D.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 27-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The major structural component of the membrane skeleton is spectrin (also referred to as fodrin in nonerythroid cells), a flexible rod-shaped molecule composed of homologous, but non-identical α- and β-subunits. Other actin-binding proteins, like filamin A and α-actinin, also participate in the maintenance of this membrane-associated cytoskeleton and are essential for the anchoring of transmembrane proteins. Α major F-actin cross-linking protein (7Lazarides E. Burridge K. Cell. 1975; 6: 289-298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), present in both muscle and non-muscle cells, is α-actinin. There are four α-actinin genes, two non-skeletal muscle isoforms, α-actinin-1 and -4, and two skeletal muscle isoforms, α-actinin-2 and -3 (8Faulkner G. Pallavicini A. Formentin E. Comelli A.

All of them share a general structure, which can be divided into three functionally distinct domains: the N terminus containing two calponin homology domains that bind to actin filaments (9Castresana J. Saraste M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 149-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), a central region composed of four spectrin-like motifs (10Davison M.D. Critchley D.R. Cell. 1988; 52: 159-160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), which acts as a switchboard for interactions with multiple proteins, and the C terminus, which contains EF-hand domains responsible for Ca2+ binding (11Trave G.

Members of the α-actinin family, namely α-actinin-1, -2, and -4, are abundantly represented in postsynaptic density (PSD) excitatory synapses (15Walikonis R.S. Jensen O.N. Mann M. Provance Jr., D.W.

Engler J.A. Sheng M. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 47: 734-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Recently, the spatial expression of α-actinin-2 in the rat central nervous system has been analyzed. The highest levels of the protein are found in the striatum, cortex, and hippocampus, where α-actinin-2 interacts with both the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptor (18Dunah A.W. Wyszynski M.

Also, α-actinin-1 showed a high expression level in neurons of striatum, whereas the cerebellum and other subcortical structures showed only weak labeling (21Kremerskothen J. Teber I. Wendholt D. Liedtke T. Bockers T.M. Barnekow A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 678-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the present study we carried out a GAL-4-based yeast two-hybrid screen to identify mGlu5b partners in adult brain. Using a C-terminal tail region of the receptor as bait we identified α-actinin-1 and -4 as novel binding partners of the mGlu5b receptor. We focus on the characterization of α-actinin-1-mGlu5b interaction, because both proteins are heavily expressed in the same adult brain area, the striatum. This interaction might have relevant physiological consequences, because we demonstrate, in the present work, that α-actinin-1 controls the cell surface expression and functioning of mGlu5b receptor. Plasmid Constructs—Two EcoRI-XhoI fragments of the C-terminal tail of the mGlu5b receptor were subcloned into the bait vector pHybLexA/Zeo (Invitrogen). One fragment coding for amino acids 828-1006 (LmGlu5b) was amplified using TaqDNA polymerase (Sigma) and the following primers: FLmGlu5b (5′-GGCTGGAATTCAAACCGGAGAGAAATGTGCG-3′) and RLmGlu5b (5′-GCCTCGAGTCACAGCGACGGCGCATC-3′). For the second fragment coding for amino acids 828-932 (SmGlu5b) the following primers were used: RLmGlu5b (5′-AGACTCGAGGTCACAAATGTTGCCCCCGG-3′) and the same FLmGlu5b. Human α-actinin-1 cloned in the HindIII restriction site of pEYFP-N1 (Clontech) was kindly provided by Dr. Carol Otey, Dept. of Cell and Molecular Physiology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Several human α-actinin-1-GST fusion proteins were made by PCR amplification and cloning into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) using the following primers: RFA1 (5′-CCGCTCGAGTTAGAGGTCACTCTCGCCGTACAGC-3′) and FFA1 (5′-CCGGAATTCATGGACCATTATGATTCTCAG-3′) for the fusion protein GST-α-actinin-1, RFA1 and FF1A1 (5′-CCGGAATTCACGGAGGAGCATGCCCGACAGCAGC-3′) for the fusion protein GST-α-actinin-1-(619-892), RFA1 and FF2A1 (5′-CCGGAATTCAATGAGTTCCGGGCCTCCTTCAACC-3′) for the fusion protein GST-α-actinin-1-(746-892), RFA1 and FF3A1 (5′-CCGGAATTCCGAGACAGCCGACACAGATACAGC-3′) for the fusion protein GST-α-actinin-1-(816-892), and FFA1 and RF4A1 (5′-CCGCTCGAGTCACGGGACATGAAGTCAATGAAGGCC-3′) for the fusion protein GST-α-actinin-1-(1-816). To perform FRET experiments the mGlu5b receptor was subcloned into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of pGFP2-N3 vector (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the primers Fm5 (5′-CCCGTTGAATTCCTTTCCTAAAATG-3′) and Rm5 (5′-CCGCCAGGATCCCGCAACGATGAAGAACT-3′) to generate the construct mGlu5b-GFP2. Also, four human α-actinin-1-YFP fusion proteins were made by PCR amplification and cloning into the HindIII sites of pEYFP-N1 (Clontech) using the following primers: Rmut (5′-CTGCAGAATTCGAAGCTTGAGGTC-3′) and Fmut1 (5′-CCCAAGCTTATGGAGATCCGGAGGCTGGAGCG-3′) for the fusion protein α-actinin-1-(358-892)-YFP, Rmut and Fmut2 (5′-CCCAAGCTTATGAACGAGTTCCGGGCCTCCTTCAA-3′) for the fusion protein α-actinin-1-(746-892)-YFP and Rmut and Fmut3 (5′-CCCAAGCTTATGTCCCGCGAGACAGCCGACACAG-3′) for the fusion protein α-actinin-1-(816-892)-YFP, Fmut4 (5′-CCCAAGCTTATGGACCATTATGATTCTCAGC-3′) and Rmut4 (5′-CCCAAGCTTGTCAATGAAGGCCTGGAATGTC-3′) for the fusion protein α-actinin-1-(1-815)-YFP. Yeast Two-hybrid System—Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed as described previously (20Burgueño J. Blake D.J. Benson M.A. Tinsley C.L. Esapa C.T. Canela E.I. Penela P. Mallol J. Mayor Jr., F.

Briefly, a bait strain was created by transforming pHybLex-LmGlu5b into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain L40 as described in the manufacturer's instructions (Hybrid Hunter, Invitrogen). The bait strain was co-transformed with an adult mouse brain cDNA library constructed in the Gal4-activating domain vector pPC86 (Invitrogen), and transformants were plated onto minimal yeast media lacking histidine, tryptophan, uracil, and lysine, containing 300 mg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen) and 5 mm 3-aminotriazole. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 5 days, and yeast colonies that grew on histidine-deficient media were re-streaked onto fresh selective plates and assayed for β-galactosidase activity as per the manufacturer's instructions. Prey plasmids were isolated from yeast and electroporated into Escherichia coli XL-1Blue electrocompetent cells (Stratagene). The 5′-end of each clone was sequenced using a vector primer. To confirm the interaction in yeast, purified prey plasmids were re-transformed with the pHybLex-LmGlu5b and pHybLex-SmGlu5b baits and with the bait empty bait vector pHybLex/Zeo and tested for growth on selective plates and β-galactosidase activity. For liquid β-galactosidase assays 1.5 ml of each culture, grown for 48 h at 30 °C, was spun, and the pellet was re-suspended in 200 μl of Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, pH 7.0). A small amount of glass beads (425-600 μm, Sigma) was added, and the mixture was sonicated for 5-10 min. After cell lysis, the samples were spun to pellet the cell debris. 100 μl of supernatant was transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube, and 700 μl of Z buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol (27 μl/10 ml) was added. 150 μl of 2.5 mg/ml ortho-nitrophenyl-β-galactoside (Sigma) was added to the sample, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. The absorbance was read at 420 nm and referred to the amount of protein present in each sample. For strong enzymatic reactions (i.e. when the color started to appear after a few minutes of incubation), a 1:10 dilution of the yeast lysate was used and the absorbance at 420 nm was multiplied by 10. Antibodies—The primary antibodies were: rabbit anti-mGlu5a/b receptor polyclonal antibody (Upstate), rabbit anti-α-actinin polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), mouse anti-α-actinin monoclonal antibody (Sigma), mouse anti-NR1 monoclonal antibody (Upstate), rabbit anti-GST polyclonal antibody (22Ciruela F.

Cell Culture, Transfection, and Membrane Preparation—HEK-293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. HEK-293 cells growing in 25-cm3 dishes or 20-mm coverslips were transiently transfected with 10 μg of DNA encoding for the proteins specified in each case by calcium phosphate precipitation (23Jordan M. Schallhorn A. Wurm F.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested at either 24 or 48 h after transfection. Neuronal striatal primary cultures were obtained as described previously (24Chan W.Y. Soloviev M.M. Ciruela F. McIlhinney R.A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2. Membrane suspensions from rat striatum or from transfected HEK cells were obtained as described previously (25Casadó V. Canti C. Mallol J. Canela E.I. Lluis C. Franco R. J. Neurosci.

Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a semi-dry transfer system and immunoblotted with the indicated antibody and then HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1/60,000), HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (1/60,000), or HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG TrueBlot™ (1/1,000).

Expression of GST Fusion Proteins and Pull-down Assays—Recombinant fusion proteins GST, GST-α-actinin-1, GST-α-actinin-1-(1-816), GST-α-actinin-1-(619-892), GST-α-actinin-1-(746-892), and GST-α-actinin-1-(816-892) were expressed in the E. coli BL21 strain (Invitrogen) with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma) for 3 h at 37 °C and purified on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (22Ciruela F.

Membranes from HEK-293 transiently transfected with the mGlu5b receptor were solubilized in ice-cold lysis buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) for 30 min at 4 °C. The solubilized material was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was pre-cleared with 100 μl of the 50% suspension (v/v) of glutathione-agarose beads for 1 h with constant rotation at 4 °C. After the pre-clearing, supernatants were transferred to a clean tube containing GST, GST-α-actinin-1, GST-α-actinin-1-(1-816), GST-α-actinin-1-(619-892), GST-α-actinin-1-(746-892), or GST-α-actinin-1-(816-892) coupled to the glutathione-agarose and incubated overnight with constant rotation at 4 °C. Subsequently, the beads were washed twice with ice-cold lysis buffer, twice with ice-cold lysis buffer containing 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and once with PBS and aspirated to dryness with a 28-gauge needle. Subsequently, 30 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (8 m urea, 2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 375 mm Tris, pH 6.8) was added to each sample. Immune complexes were dissociated by heating to 37 °C for 2 h and resolved by SDS-PAGE in 7.5% gels and immunoblotted as described above. Immunoprecipitation and Immunocytochemistry—For immunoprecipitation, membranes from transiently transfected HEK cells were solubilized in ice-cold lysis buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) for 30 min on ice. In the case of rat striatum membranes these were solubilized in 2% SDS in PBS and then diluted with 5 volumes of ice-cold 2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 in PBS (28Müller B.M. Kistner U. Kindler S. Chung W.J.

In both cases, the solubilized preparation was then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant (1 mg/ml) was processed for immunoprecipitation, each step of which was conducted with constant rotation at 0-4 °C. The supernatant was incubated overnight with the indicated antibody. Next 40 μl of a suspension of protein G cross-linked to agarose beads was added, and the mixture was incubated overnight. The beads were washed and treated as described above. For immunocytochemistry, transiently transfected HEK-293 cells, or rat neuronal striatal primary cultures, were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and washed with PBS containing 20 mm glycine (buffer A) to quench the remaining free aldehyde groups. Cells were permeabilized with buffer A containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Blocking was performed using buffer A containing 1% bovine serum albumin (buffer B). Cells were labeled for 1 h at room temperature with the indicated primary antibody, washed for 30 min in buffer B, and stained with the corresponding secondary antibodies for another hour. Samples were rinsed and then examined using a confocal microscope (29Sarrió S. Casadó V. Escriche M. Ciruela F. Mallol J. Canela E.I. Lluis C. Franco R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5164-5174Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 30Luján R. Ciruela F. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 1285-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To test the specificity of the antibodies we omitted or replaced the primary antibodies with buffer B. Under these conditions, no selective labeling was observed. FRET Experiments Analyzed by Fluorometry—Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were rapidly washed twice in PBS, detached, and re-suspended in the same buffer. To control the number of cells, the protein concentration of the samples was determined using a Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin dilutions as standards. Cell suspension (20 μg of protein) was distributed in duplicate into 96-well microplates (black plates with a transparent bottom). Plates were read in a Fluostar Optima Fluorometer equipped with a high energy xenon flash lamp, using a 10 nm bandwidth excitation filter at 400 nm (393-403 nm), and 10 nm bandwidth emission filters corresponding to a 506-515 nm filter (Ch 1) and a 527-536 nm filter (Ch 2). Gain settings were identical for all experiments to keep the relative contribution of the fluorophores to the detection channels constant for spectral un-mixing. Quantitation of FRET was performed as described previously (31Canals M. Marcellino D. Fanelli F. Ciruela F. De Benedetti P. Goldberg S.R. Fuxe K. Agnati L.F. Woods A.S. Ferre S. Lluis C. Bouvier M. Franco R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46741-46749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The contribution of each fluorophore to both detection channels was calculated from the readings obtained by expressing each GFP variant separately. The spectral signatures of the different receptors fused to either GFP2 or YFP did not significantly vary from the determined spectral signatures of the fluorescent proteins alone. Linear un-mixing was performed according to Zimmermann et al. (32Zimmermann T. Rietdorf J. Girod A. Georget V. Pepperkok R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and was used to determine the fluorescence emitted by each of the fluorophores. Biotinylation of Cell Surface Proteins—Cell surface proteins were biotinylated as described previously (33Ciruela F. Soloviev M.M. McIlhinney R.A.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 34Burgueño J. Canela E.I. Mallol J. Lluis C. Franco R. Ciruela F. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 300: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with the mGlu5b receptor in the absence, or presence, of α-actinin-1-YFP constructs were washed three times in borate buffer (10 mm H3BO3, pH 8.8; 150 mm NaCl) and then incubated with 50 μg/ml Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) in borate buffer for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times in borate buffer and again incubated with 50 μg/ml Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin in borate buffer for 10 min at room temperature, and then 13 mm NH4Cl was added for 5 min to quench the remaining biotin. Cells were washed in Tris-buffered saline, disrupted with three 10-s strokes in a Polytron, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was solubilized in ice-cold lysis buffer (see above) for 30 min and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was incubated with 80 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma) for 1 h with constant rotation at 4 °C. The beads were washed and treated as described above and processed for immunoblotting. Extracellular Signal-regulated Kinase Assay—Before stimulation with quisqualic acid transiently transfected HEK-293 cells were serum-starved for 16 h by replacing the usual culture medium for normal Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without glutamine and fetal bovine serum but containing 2 mm sodium pyruvate and 1 unit/ml glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (Roche Applied Science) to eliminate glutamate from the medium. After stimulation, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and scraped into 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 45 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, and 1 mm NaVO4 in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Lysed cells were centrifuged for 20 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C, and equal protein concentrations were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto Immobilon-P membrane, and incubated with rabbit anti-ERK1/2 (1/40,000) or mouse anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (1/2,500). Quantitative analysis of detected bands was performed by using densitometric scanning (35Ferré S. Karcz-Kubicha M. Hope B.T. Popoli P. Burgueño J. Casadó V. Fuxe K. Lluis C. Goldberg S.R. Franco R. Ciruela F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11940-11945Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—To identify intracellular proteins interacting with the mGlu5b receptor, a region containing 178 amino acids of the C-terminal tail of the receptor (amino acids 828-1006) were fused in-frame with LexA in the pHybLexA/Zeo vector (LmGlu5b, Fig. 1A) and used to screen a mouse brain cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid system. Of the seven clones, from the 1 × 106 total transformants screened that were found to grow onto nutritional-deficient plates and activated the β-galactosidase assay, three were identified as different isoforms of the actin binding protein α-actinin, one clone for α-actinin-1, and another two for α-actinin-4. The isolated α-actinin-1 clone comprises amino acids 369-892 that include part of the spectrin-like motif and the Ca2+ binding domain (Fig. 1B). To determine the region of the C-terminal domain of the mGlu5b receptor that interacted with α-actinin-1, another LexA fusion protein missing the last 74 amino acids of the former LmGlu5b was constructed (SmGlu5b, Fig. 1A) and tested for its ability to bind α-actinin-1. This shorter fusion protein could not interact with α-actinin-1 as tested using a liquid β-galactosidase assay (Fig. 1A, inset panel), thus mapping the interacting domain to within amino acids 932-1006 of mGlu5b receptor. This region is common in both mGlu5a and mGlu5b receptor isoforms and close to the described Ca2+/calmodulin binding motifs (36Minakami R. Jinnai N. Sugiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20291-20298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). α-Actinin-1 Binds to the C-terminal Domain of mGlu5b Receptor—By means of pull-down experiments we tested the ability of naturally expressed full-length mGlu5b receptor to associate with GST fusion proteins containing different regions of α-actinin-1 (Fig. 2, left part). As shown in Fig. 2, an immunoreactive band of ∼130 kDa corresponding to the mGlu5b receptor could be detected in the crude extracts from HEK-293 cells transiently expressing the receptor (Fig. 2, Crude). This band was observed in pull-down assays when cell lysates were incubated with GST-α-actinin-1, GST-α-actinin-1-(619-892), GST-α-actinin-1-(746-892), and GST-α-actinin-1-(816-892) (Fig. 2, lanes 1-4, respectively), but was not detected either with GST-α-actinin-1-(1-816) fusion protein or with GST alone (Fig. 2, lanes 6 and 5, respectively). This result shows that the naturally expressed mGlu5b receptor binds specifically to a region in the α-actinin-1 protein located within amino acids 816 and 892. On the other hand, the binding of the mGlu5b receptor to this region was not altered by the presence of 2 mm Ca2+ or 5 mm EDTA (data not shown). Interestingly, this C-terminal region of α-actinin-1 (76 amino acids) displays 70% amino acid sequence identity (84% similarity) across the α-actinin-1, -2, and -3 isoforms (37Robison A.J.

Interaction of the mGlu5b Receptor and α-Actinin-1 in Transfected HEK-293 Cells and in Rat Striatum—The association of the mGlu5b receptor and α-actinin-1 was subsequently studied in transfected HEK-293 cells by double immunolabeling experiments and co-immunoprecipitation. By confocal microscopy analysis of HEK-293 cells transiently co-transfected with the cDNA encoding for the mGlu5b receptor and α-actinin-1-YFP, a marked overlap in the distribution of the two proteins was found at the plasma membrane level (Fig. 3). Interestingly, when the double immunolabeling experiment was performed in HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with the cDNA encoding the mGlu5b receptor and either α-actinin-1-(358-892)-YFP, a-actinin"

A zinc finger protein, Schnurri-2 (SHN-2), was recently demonstrated to regulate bone morphogenetic protein-dependent adipogenesis and lymphogenesis. However, the role of SHN-2 in bone is not known. Here, we investigated the effects of Shn-2 deficiency on bone metabolism and cell function in Shn-2-null mice. Lack of SHN-2 expression reduced bone remodeling by suppressing both osteoblastic bone formation and osteoclastic bone resorption activities in vivo. Shn-2 deficiency suppressed osterix and osteocalcin expression as well as in vitro mineralization. Conversely, Shn-2 overexpression enhanced osteocalcin promoter activity and bone morphogenetic protein-dependent osteoblastic differentiation. Shn-2 deficiency suppressed Nfatc1 and c-fos expression leading to reduction of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive cell development in vivo as well as in the cultures of bone marrow cells. These studies demonstrate that SHN-2 regulates the activities of critical transcription factors required for normal bone remodeling.

These studies demonstrate that SHN-2 regulates the activities of critical transcription factors required for normal bone remodeling. Adult bone is remodeled to meet continuously changing structural and metabolic requirements. To maintain bone mass, resorption by osteoclasts must be balanced by the formation of bone by osteoblasts. In bone diseases such as osteoporosis the balance between formation and resorption is lost, leading to reduced bone mass, which increases the risk of fractures (1Raisz L.G. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 3318-3325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar, 2Martin T.J. Sims N.A. Trends Mol.

Identification of molecules involved in adult bone mass determination is critical to better understand the function of such molecules and may render clues for treatment of bone diseases such as osteoporosis. Several molecules have been reported to modulate adult bone mass in mouse models. Genetic analyses of high bone mass trait in the C3H strain and Balb strain identified a mutation in ALOX15 that may be responsible for increase in adult bone mass (3Klein R.F. Allard J. Avnur Z.

These molecules mostly act on osteoblasts to modulate only one of the two arms of bone remodeling.

Cell. 2006; 10: 461-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and it is also required for positive selection of thymocytes (21Takagi T. Harada J. Ishii S. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 1048-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). SHN-2 competitively inhibits NF-κB binding and leads to the suppression of type 2 helper T cell differentiation (22Kimura M.Y. Hosokawa H. Yamashita M. Hasegawa A. Iwamura C. Watarai H. Taniguchi M. Takagi T. Ishii S. Nakayama T. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Recently, SHN-3, another member of the Schnurri family, was reported to suppress adult bone mass levels through RUNX2 protein degradation (23Jones D.C. Wein M.N. Oukka M. Hofstaetter J.G. Glimcher M.J. Glimcher L.H. Science. 2006; 312: 1223-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). However, SHN-3 shares only limited homology with SHN-2 (17Wu L.C. Gene Expr. 2002; 10: 137-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Here, we report on Shn-2 deficiency-suppressed bone formation as well as bone resorption. Shn-2 deficiency reduced the expression levels of osteoblastic transcription factor osterix as well as osteoclastic transcriptional factors, nuclear factor of activated T cells (Nfat) c1 and c-fos. Shn-2 overexpression enhanced promoter activity of osteocalcin, which is downstream of master regulators in osteoblasts. Furthermore, Shn-2 overexpression activated bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-induced osteoblastic differentiation. Thus, Shn-2 is a novel regulator of adult bone remodeling. Animals—Shn-2 knock-out mice were described previously (21Takagi T. Harada J. Ishii S. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 1048-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Male BALB/c background 12-week-old Shn-2 knock-out mice and wild type littermates (n = 7) were used for the studies of bone mineral density (BMD), two-dimensional micro-computed tomography (μCT), bone histomorphometric analysis, bone marrow cell cultures, and measurement of BMP-induced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. For experiments on the evaluations of time course study of two-dimensional micro-CT, we used 1-, 4-, and 8-week-old Shn-2-deficient mice and wild type littermates (n = 3). All the animal experiments were approved by the Animal Welfare Committee of Tokyo Medical and Dental University. Measurement of BMD and μCT Analysis of Bone—BMD was measured based on dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) as described previously (24Kitahara K. Ishijima M. Rittling S.R. Tsuji K. Kurosawa H. Nifuji A. Denhardt D.T. Noda M. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 2132-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, BMD (g/cm2) of the femora and tibia were subjected to dual x-ray absorptiometry using a device specifically designed for small animals (PIXI; GE Luner, Madison, WI). Two-dimensional μCT data were collected using the Musashi system (Nittetsu-ELEX, Osaka, Japan). For the evaluation of cortical bone volume, total cortical bone area as well as cortical thickness in the midshaft was measured. Calvarial thickness and bone area were measured in the coronal section of parietal bone. For cancellous bone, bone volume/tissue volume values were evaluated using μCT slices at the sagittal section of femora as well as coronal section of spine (L4) as described previously (24Kitahara K. Ishijima M. Rittling S.R. Tsuji K. Kurosawa H. Nifuji A. Denhardt D.T. Noda M. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 2132-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Histomorphometric Analysis and Skeletal Preparation—Bone formation rate (BFR) in cortical and cancellous regions in femora was measured in the undecalcified section as previously described (24Kitahara K. Ishijima M. Rittling S.R. Tsuji K. Kurosawa H. Nifuji A. Denhardt D.T. Noda M. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 2132-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the decalcified section, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinucleated cells were counted as osteoclasts to evaluate osteoclast number/bone surface and osteoclast surface/bone surface. Skeletal preparation was performed as described previously (25Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 379-381Google Scholar). Briefly, day 3 mice skins were removed and fixed in 95% EtOH overnight and then stained Alcian blue (15 mg/100 ml in 80% EtOH) followed by alizarin red (5 mg/100 ml in 2% KOH). RNA Extraction, cDNA Synthesis, and PCR—RNA was extracted from mouse femur, MC3T3E1 cells, and RAW264.7 cells based on the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using 1 μg of the total RNA and Molony murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. Amplification was performed as described previously (26Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2002-2007Crossref Scopus (25832) Google Scholar). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). The quantification was done as described previously (27Salingcarnboriboon R. Yoshitake H. Tsuji K. Obinata M. Amagasa T. Nifuji A. Noda M. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 287: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Expression values were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The primers for real-time reverse transcription PCR were as follows: Shn-2, forward, 5′-GCC GCC CAC CCT GAC TTA C-3′, reverse, 5′-CTT CTC ATC CAC ACT GCT CTT GC-3′; Col1a1, forward, 5′-CTG ACT GGA AGA GCG GAG AG-3′, reverse, 5′-GCA CAG ACG GCT GAG TAG G-3′; Runx2, forward, 5′-TGG CTT GGG TTT CAG GTT AGG G-3′, reverse, 5′-TCG GTT TCT TAG GGT CTT GGA GTG-3′; osterix, forward, 5′-AGC GAC CAC TTG AGC AAA CAT C-3′, reverse 5′-CGG CTG ATT GGC TTC TTC TTC C-3′; Alp, forward, 5′-GCT ATC TGC CTT GCC TGT ATC TG-3′, reverse, 5′-AGG TGC TTT GGG AAT CTG TGC-3′; Rankl, forward, 5′-CCT GAG GCC CAG CCA TTT-3′, reverse, 5′-CTT GGC CCA GCC TCG AT-3′; osteoprotegerin (Opg), forward, 5′-TAC CTG GAG ATC GAA TTC TGC TT-3, reverse, 5′-CCA TCT GGA CAT TTT TTG CAA A-3′;c-fos, forward, 5′-CCG TGT CAG GAG GCA GAG C-3′, reverse 5′-GCA GCC ATC TTA TTC CGT TCC C-3′; Nfatc1, forward, 5′-AGC CCA AGT CTC ACC ACA GG-3′, reverse, 5′-CAG CCG TCC CAA TGA ACA GC-3′; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, forward, 5′-AGA AGG TGG TGA AGC AGG CAT C-3′, reverse, 5′-CGA AGG TGG AAG AGT GGG AGT TG-3′. Cells—Primary osteoblasts were obtained from the outgrowth cultures of bone fragments of calvariae taken from wild type and Shn-2-deficient mice. These cells were used for measurement of BMP-induced ALP activity. Bone marrow cells were flushed out after the proximal epiphyseal ends were removed from right tibiae of wild type and Shn-2-deficient mice and used for mineralized nodule formation assay and osteoclast development. Osteoclas-togenesis was examined both in bone marrow cells and splenocytes obtained from wild type and Shn-2-deficient mice. The MC3T3E1 osteoblastic cell line was obtained from RIKEN (Saitama, Japan). These cells were used for experiments of real-time PCR, overexpression of Shn-2, and luciferase assays. The RAW264.7 cell line was purchased from the Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and maintained with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. These cells were used for experiment of RANKL (100 ng/ml)-induced Shn-2 mRNA expression. Bone Marrow Cultures—Marrow cells were plated in 24-well plates (2.0 cm2/well) at a density of 2 × 106 cells/well. Tartrateresistant acid phosphatase-positive osteoclast-like multinucleated cells were formed in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml antibiotics-antimycotics mixture, 10 nm 1.25(OH)2 vitamin D3, and 100 nm dexamethasone. The medium was changed every 3-4 days. For mineralized nodule formation, bone marrow cells were cultured in a standard growth medium containing 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid and 10 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate. The medium was changed every 3-4 days. The cultures were stained in a saturated solution of alizarin red on day 21. The area of mineralized nodules/total dish surface was measured by using the Luzex-F automated image analyzer (Nireco). Measurement of ALP Activity—ALP activity measurement was made in primary osteoblasts by using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate (28Maeda Y. Tsuji K. Nifuji A. Noda M. J. Cell Biochem. 2004; 93: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium. Cell differentiation was induced by treatment with 100 ng/ml rhBMP-2 in a standard growth medium. Transfections and Reporter Assays—MC3T3E1 cells (1 × 105 cells/well in six-well tissue culture plates) were transfected with various combinations of the following plasmids using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent: reporter constructs (12×GCCG/luciferase, 1.1 kb osteocalcin-gene-2/luciferase), Shn-2 expression vector, and empty vector as a control. After 24-72 h of incubation, cell extracts were prepared and used to measure luciferase activity based on the Dual Luciferase™ reporter assay system (Promega), and the values were normalized against the efficiency of transfection using the same system. Both firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured by AutoLumat (LB953; EG & G Brethhold). Osteoclastogenesis in Stromal Cell-free Condition—Lymphocytes and monocytes were obtained from spleen by using Lympholite-M (Cedarlane) according to the manufacturer's protocol. These cells were cultured for 12 h with 5 ng/ml macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and non-adherent cells were further cultured in the presence of 30 ng/ml M-CSF for 3 days. RANKL (100 ng/ml) was added with 30 ng/ml M-CSF, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinucleated cells were counted as osteoclasts. Statistical Evaluations—The results were presented as mean values ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test to evaluate differences between the two groups. Analysis of variance was performed when the examined experimental groups exceeded three groups. Tukey's multiple comparison test was applied as post hoc test. p values <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Cortical bone is the major component of adult bone mass. Shn-2 deficiency reduced cortical bone mass with respect to the levels of cortical thickness and cortical bone area in femora (Fig. 1, A-C) and in calvarial bone (Fig. 1, D and F). Because the size and length of femur of Shn-2-deficient mice were smaller than wild type (21Takagi T. Harada J. Ishii S. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 1048-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we also evaluated the values of cortical thickness and cortical area normalized against those of femur length and found that Shn-2 deficiency reduced cortical bone parameters after normalization as well (data not shown). This observation was further supported by reduction in BMD in Shn-2-deficient mice (Fig. 1, G and H). Thus, Shn-2 deficiency reduced total bone mass. With respect to dynamic parameters, Shn-2 deficiency suppressed the levels of BFR as well as mineral apposition rate (MAR) and mineralizing surface (MS/BS) in the periosteal regions of cortical bone (Fig. 1I). These observations indicated that SHN-2 is required for the activities of individual osteoblastic cells (mineral apposition rate) as well as the mineralizing surface (MS/BS) to maintain BFR. We also counted osteoblast number as defined by Parfitt et al. (29Parfitt A.M. Drezner M.K. Glorieux F.H. Kanis J.A. Malluche H. Meunier P.J. Ott S.M. Recker R.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1987; 2: 595-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (4914) Google Scholar) because MS/BS represent osteoblast surface but do not represent the number of osteoblast. Although Shn-2 deficiency tended to suppress the number of osteoblast, it was not statistically significant (data not shown). Molecular bases for such Shn-2 deficiency phenotype in bone mass were further examined based on mRNA expression levels in whole bone in vivo. Messenger RNA expression levels of osteoblastic phenotype-related genes such as osterix and osteocalcin were suppressed in the bones of the Shn-2-deficient mice (Fig. 1, J and K). Expression of other maker genes, including Col1a1, Runx2, and Alp, tended to be decreased in Shn-2-deficient mice though they were not statistically significant. Therefore, Shn-2 deficiency suppressed bone formation activity in vivo at the messenger RNA levels. We examined the bones of mice at younger stages, including the time points of 1, 4, and 8 weeks after birth. Although overall contour of the cortical bone in the cross-section of the midshaft was similar (Fig. 2A), cortical bone volume (Fig. 2B) and cortical thickness (Fig. 2C) were less in Shn-2-deficient mice compared with wild type 1 week after birth; this reduction was similarly observed in 4-, 8-, and 12-week-old mice (Fig. 2, A-C). In younger mice such as 3 days old, examination of skeletal preparation did not reveal major defects (Fig. 2D). Thus, SHN-2 is required for the regulation of osteoblasts. Although Shn-2 deficiency resulted in overall reduction in the levels of parameters in bone mass as represented by the data in whole limb bone BMD (Fig. 1, G and H), there was a regionally and temporally limited mild increase in bone volume/tissue volume in the cancellous bone envelope in the metaphysis of Shn-2-deficient mice (Fig. 3A). This phenotype was limited to 8- and 12-week-old mice and was not observed in 4-week-old mice (Fig. 3, A and B). These data indicated that Shn-2 deficiency reduced bone mass (including cortical and cancellous) after mice were 1 week old. However, they were associated with regional (limited to metaphyseal region) cancellous bone increase at the adult stage (8 and 12 weeks). To further elucidate this point, in addition to cortical bone we conducted analyses on the dynamic bone formation parameters in cancellous bone envelope. The data revealed that Shn-2 deficiency suppressed the levels of cancellous MS/BS, mineral apposition rate, and BFR (Fig. 3C), consistent with the observation on these parameters in cortical bone (Fig. 1I). Although Shn-2 deficiency suppressed bone formation activities in cancellous bone, trabecular bone volume was increased in the metaphysis of long bone. To see whether this phenotype was restricted to long bone or not, we also evaluated trabecular bone volume in spine. Trabecular bone volume at the lumbar spine also increased in 12-week-old Shn-2-deficient mice compared with wild type (Fig. 3, A and D). Previously reported animal models, such as mice deficient in SHN-3, TOB, and CIZ, only revealed osteoblastic phenotype, but not osteoclastic phenotype (5Yoshida Y. Tanaka S. Umemori H. Minowa O. Usui M. Ikematsu N. Hosoda E. Imamura T. Kuno J. Yamashita T. Miyazono K. Noda M. Noda T. Yamamoto T.

Med. 2005; 201: 961-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In contrast to these previous models, Shn-2 mutation “suppressed” bone resorption parameters, including osteoclast number/BS and osteoclast surface/BS levels (Fig. 3, E and G). Thus, Shn-2 deficiency has a unique feature in that it causes reduction in both osteoblastic and osteoclastic activities in vivo to lead to low turnover state in bone. To better understand how SHN-2 acts in cells, we examined Shn-2 expression in osteoblastic cells. We tested whether SHN-2 is functionally involved in the differentiation of osteoblastic cells using bone marrow cells of the wild type and Shn-2-deficient mice. Shn-2 deficiency suppressed the levels of mineralized nodule formation in bone marrow cells cultured in the presence of β-glycero-phosphate and ascorbic acid (Fig. 4, A and B). During the differentiation of osteoblasts in these bone marrow cell cultures, BMP signaling was reported to play a critical role (31Lecanda F. Avioli L.V. Cheng S.L. J. Cell Biochem. 1997; 67: 386-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 32Takeuchi Y. Watanabe S. Ishii G. Takeda S. Nakayama K. Fukumoto S. Kaneta Y. Inoue D. Matsumoto T. Harigaya K. Fujita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49011-49018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined SHN-2 involvement in BMP signaling. For those experiments, we prepared cells outgrown from the explants of minced calvarial bones. The basal levels of ALP in these wild type and Shn-2-deficient cells derived from the calvaria were similar (Fig. 4C, lane 1 versus 3). BMP-2 enhanced ALP activity ∼3-fold in wild type cells, whereas Shn-2 deficiency suppressed this BMP effect on ALP down to 2-fold (Fig. 4C, lane 2 versus 4; p < 0.05). To further examine Shn-2 expression in osteoblastic cell line, we examined MC3T3E1 cells. Shn-2 mRNA was expressed in osteoblastic MC3T3E1 cells (Fig. 5A). During the cultures of MC3T3E1 cells, Shn-2 mRNA levels increased ∼2.5-fold within 4 days in culture along with the increase in the expression levels of alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 5B, Alp). After day 4 in culture, Shn-2 mRNA levels stayed at steadily high levels, whereas the mRNA levels of osteoblastic differentiation marker genes, such as Alp, Runx2, osterix, and type I collagen (Col1a1) gradually increased up to day 21 (Fig. 5B). Therefore, Shn-2 expression levels were increased along with maturation of osteoblasts during the early differentiation stage.FIGURE 5Shn-2 expression in osteoblast-like cells in vitro. A, Shn-2 mRNA expression was detected in bone in vivo and in MC3T3E1 cells. B, MC3T3E1 cells were cultured for 21 days. RNA was extracted at the indicated time points. Expression levels of Col1a1, Runx2, osterix, Alp, and Shn-2 were estimated based on real-time PCR system. Expression levels of genes related to osteoblastic phenotypes were gradually increased in these cells. Expression level of Shn-2 was enhanced in these cells up to day 4 and kept at similar expression level up to day 21.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Shn-2 overexpression in osteoblastic cell line MC3T3E1 promoted BMP-2 enhancement in the expression levels of Alp, osterix, and Runx2 mRNAs (Fig. 6, A-C). These data revealed that SHN-2 is a positive regulator of osteoblastic differentiation, which acts at least in part by modulating BMP actions in these cells. To examine the mode of SHN-2 modulation of BMP signaling, BMP-induced transcriptional events were studied. Shn-2 overexpression by itself enhanced ∼3-fold the expression of luciferase reporter gene linked to the BMP response elements, 12 × GCCG, in MC3T3E1 cells (Fig. 6D, lane 1 versus 3). This enhancement was similar to that observed in the cells receiving BMP treatment alone (Fig. 6D, lane 2 versus 3). Under this condition, Shn-2 overexpression enhanced luciferase levels ∼2-fold more than those observed in the BMP-induced transcriptional activation (Fig. 6D, lane 2 versus 4). To see whether SHN-2 affects transcription of authentic promoter of gene encoding osteoblastic phenotype, a 1.1-kb osteocalcin promoter construct was transfected into MC3T3E1 cells. Overexpression of Shn-2 enhanced the activity of osteocalcin promoter (Fig. 6E). These observations indicate that SHN-2 enhances bone formation and osteoblastic differentiation at least in part through its action on transcriptional events that are involved in osteoblastic differentiation. Shn-2-deficient mice exhibited in vivo osteoclastic phenotype in bone whereas Shn-3-deficient mice did not (23Jones D.C. Wein M.N. Oukka M. Hofstaetter J.G. Glimcher M.J. Glimcher L.H. Science. 2006; 312: 1223-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We therefore pursued the mode of this SHN-2 action in osteoclas-togenesis. Bone marrow cells were cultured in the presence of vitamin D3 and dexamethasone. Shn-2 deficiency suppressed the development of osteoclasts in the bone marrow cell culture (Fig. 7, A and B). As bone marrow cell cultures contain both stromal cells and progenitor cells for osteoclasts, we wished to test whether SHN-2 contributes to osteoclastogenesis in progenitor cells. For this purpose, spleen cells, which contain osteoclast progenitors but less stromal cells, were subjected to osteoclastogenesis assay in cultures in the presence of M-CSF and soluble receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL). Shn-2 deficiency in spleen cells reduced the development of osteoclasts in culture (Fig. 7C). These data revealed that SHN-2 acts as an endogenous modulator to support osteoclastogenesis. With regard to osteoclast function, Shn-2-deficient cells could form an actin ring and resorb dentin slice (data not shown), suggesting that absence of SHN-2 impaired in RANKL-dependent osteoclast development but not function. To examine Shn-2 expression during osteoclastic cell differentiation, RAW264.7 cells were treated with RANKL. RAW264.7 cells differentiated into tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinucleated cells in the presence of RANKL without M-CSF as reported previously (33Hirotani H. Tuohy N.A. Woo J.T. Stern P.H. Clipstone N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13984-13992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effects of RANKL alone could be observed in these cells. Shn-2 mRNA expression levels in RAW264.7 cells were enhanced by RANKL treatment (Fig. 7D). Thus, Shn-2 expression is under the control of RANKL signaling, and at the same time it is supporting osteoclast development. Shn-2 deficiency suppressed the function of osteoblast, which is the main source of RANKL and OPG. Impaired osteoclastogenesis in Shn-2 deficiency would be caused by the suppression of the induction of RANKL by osteoblasts. Thus, we analyzed expression levels of Rankl as well as Opg in bone. We found that Rankl expression levels were enhanced by Shn-2 deficiency (Fig. 8A), whereas expression levels of Opg tended to decrease in Shn-2 deficiency without statistical significance (Fig. 8B). Rankl/Opg ratio significantly increased in Shn-2-deficient mice (Fig. 8C). Therefore, impaired osteoclastogenesis in Shn-2 deficiency occurred despite the elevated Rankl. Because osteoclastogenesis is under the control of RANKL signaling, we analyzed expression levels of the genes downstream of this signaling. Expression level of c-fos was decreased in the bones of Shn-2-deficient mice (Fig. 8D). Because c-fos-deficient mice were reported to exhibit severe osteopetrosis due to impaired osteoclastogenesis (34Grigoriadis A.E. Wang Z.Q. Cecchini M.G. Hofstetter W. Felix R. Fleisch H.A. Wagner E.F. Science. 1994; 266: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) and c-fos targets NFATc1 (35Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Nature. 2003; 423: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (4976) Google Scholar, 36Zelzer E. Olsen B.R. Nature. 2003; 423: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), we also examined the expression level of Nfatc1. Expression levels of Nfatc1 were decreased in the bones of Shn-2-deficient mice (Fig. 8E). These results suggest that SHN-2 is involved in the RANKL-induced signals to promote osteoclast development. Although the interactions between RANKL and BMP on osteoclastogenesis remain unclear, BMP has been recently reported to positively regulate osteoclastic activities in vivo (37Okamoto M. Murai J. Yoshikawa H. Tsumaki N. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2006; 21: 1022-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Our preliminary data also indicated that BMP treatment enhanced RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in wild type spleen cells, whereas such BMP enhancement in osteoclastogenesis was suppressed in Shn-2-deficient cells. We report here that SHN-2 is a novel transcriptional regulator of bone cell function and bone mass. Shn-2 deficiency caused reduction in whole bone BMD in vivo and suppressed bone formation as well as bone resorption parameters. Thus, SHN-2 plays a role in both arms of bone metabolism involved in bone turnover and remodeling. Shn-2 deficiency resulted in reduction in osterix and down-stream osteocalcin gene expression. We also found that overexpression of Shn-2 enhanced the levels of this gene. Thus, SHN-2 would be a modulator of at least one of the two master regulatory molecules of osteoblastic differentiation, osterix. Overexpression experiments indicated that SHN-2 by itself enhanced BMP response element-dependent transcription, possibly due to the enhancement of endogenous BMP. This SHN-2 action was observed to be augmented in the case of the simultaneous presence of exogenously added BMP. Furthermore, even in the absence of BMP, SHN-2 alone enhanced the osteocalcin gene in the 1.1-kb promoter, indicating that SHN-2 is acting on the gene either alone or in combination with the endogenous BMP signaling. We also observed that in the absence of SHN-2, suppression of osterix in bone was observed. However, Runx2 suppression was not obvious, suggesting that SHN-2 may act to modulate the function of osteoblastic master regulatory molecules more at the stages of osterix action that is downstream to the RUNX2 action. As it is obvious that SHN-2 per se is dispensable for osteoblastic differentiation, the importance of SHN-2 activity is to modify the levels of differentiation in osteoblastic cell lineages. Shn-2 deficiency decreased the length of long bone (data not shown) as well as the body weight (20Jin W. Takagi T. Kanesashi S.N. Kurahashi T. Nomura T. Harada J. Ishii S. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 461-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 21Takagi T. Harada J. Ishii S. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 1048-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, the reason why Shn-2 deficiency causes short stature remains unclear. In growth plate, the columnar structures and primary spongiosa appeared normal. As Shn-2 deficiency slightly increased the length of growth plate, Shn-2 deficiency may result in failure to remodel calcified cartilage. As observed in in vivo analyses, one of the important points in SHN-2 actions is to regulate both osteoclastic and osteoblastic cells. Molecular analyses of osteoclastic activities indicated that deficiency of Shn-2 per se suppressed c-fos and Nfatc1 expression levels in vivo. In the presence of RANKL, Shn-2 enhanced the levels of osteoclastic differentiation in RAW264.7 cells and also the promoter activity of Nfatc1 (data not shown). Therefore, in osteoclastic differentiation SHN-2 would again be a transcriptional modulator of the promoter of Nfatc1, possibly by working together with other transcriptional factors or modulators such as NFATc1 by itself. Bone formation and bone resorption would be often regulated simultaneously in the same direction (2Martin T.J. Sims N.A. Trends Mol. Med. 2005; 11: 76-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 38Harada S. Rodan G.A. Nature. 2003; 423: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar, 39Winslow M.M. Pan M. Starbuck M. Gallo E.M. Deng L. Karsenty G. Crabtree G.R. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 771-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), called coupling. Such a coupling event is important for the body to maintain bone mass. For instance, enhancement of bone formation in the event of loss of bone due to the increase in bone resorption would benefit the maintenance of bone mass (39Winslow M.M. Pan M. Starbuck M. Gallo E.M. Deng L. Karsenty G. Crabtree G.R. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 771-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 40Felsenberg D. Boonen S. Clin. Ther. 2005; 27: 1-11Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Although understanding the mechanisms of this coupling is important, molecular bases for these coupling phenomena have not yet been fully elucidated (34Grigoriadis A.E. Wang Z.Q. Cecchini M.G. Hofstetter W. Felix R. Fleisch H.A. Wagner E.F. Science. 1994; 266: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 36Zelzer E. Olsen B.R.

Compensatory mechanisms would provide for repair of lost bone to resume bone mass level under physiological conditions. However, in the case of postmenopausal osteoporosis, enhancement in bone resorption exceeds that of bone formation to end up with eventual bone loss (1Raisz L.G. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 3318-3325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar, 36Zelzer E. Olsen B.R. Nature. 2003; 423: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). As SHN-2 acts positively in both bone formation and resorption, this molecule plays a role at least in part to support the coupling events during the remodeling cycle to maintain adult bone mass. Our preliminary experiments of co-culture assays using osteoblasts and spleen cells from wild type and Shn-2-deficient mice revealed that Shn-2 deficiency in both osteoblasts and osteoclasts suppressed osteoclasto-genesis (data not shown). This observation supported that SHN-2 plays a role in both osteoblasts and osteoclast to support osteoclastogenesis. Shn-2 deficiency has been reported to suppress adipogenesis by reducing the BMP signaling in fat tissue (20Jin W. Takagi T. Kanesashi S.N. Kurahashi T. Nomura T. Harada J. Ishii S. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 461-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and lymphogenesis by suppressing conversion from the double positive thymocytes into single positive cells, respectively (21Takagi T. Harada J. Ishii S. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 1048-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 22Kimura M.Y. Hosokawa H. Yamashita M. Hasegawa A. Iwamura C. Watarai H. Taniguchi M. Takagi T. Ishii S. Nakayama T. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). BMP has been recently reported to positively regulate osteoclastic activities in vivo (37Okamoto M. Murai J. Yoshikawa H. Tsumaki N. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2006; 21: 1022-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and also has been implicated in regulation of immune cells (42Bleul C.C. Boehm T. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 5213-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Our observations on SHN-2 action in bone coincides with these notions on the close relationship between bone, fat, and immune system although a direct relationship among those still needs to be elucidated. It is intriguing to note those mice deficient in Shn-2 and those deficient in Shn-3 exhibit opposite phenotypes, i.e. osteopenia versus osteosclerosis, respectively (23Jones D.C. Wein M.N. Oukka M. Hofstaetter J.G. Glimcher M.J. Glimcher L.H. Science. 2006; 312: 1223-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In addition, Shn-2-deficient mice revealed osteoclastic phenotype whereas Shn-3-deficient mice did not. Although zinc finger motifs are present in both molecules, overall homology is relatively low (<30%) (17Wu L.C. Gene Expr. 2002; 10: 137-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These features suggest that the two molecules would not compensate each other but rather they would be required for distinct functions in the regulation of bone metabolism. In conclusion, SHN-2 is a novel regulator of bone cells that plays a role in the maintenance of the bone mass, acting via positive regulation of transcription factors required for the functions of osteoblasts and osteoclasts."
https://openalex.org/W1970989354,"The MADD variant of the IG20 gene is necessary and sufficient for cancer cell survival. Abrogation of MADD, but not the other IG20 splice variants, can render cancer cells more susceptible to spontaneous as well as TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor α-related apoptosis-inducing ligand)-induced apoptosis. Both types of apoptosis in cells devoid of MADD can be inhibited by expression of CrmA or dominant-negative FADD, thereby suggesting that endogenous MADD may be targeting caspase-8 activation. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that MADD down-modulation could lead to caspase-8 activation at the death receptors without an apparent increase in the recruitment of death-inducing signaling complex components such as FADD. Further, we found that MADD can directly interact with death receptors, but not with either caspase-8 or FADD, and can inhibit caspase-8 activation. These results clearly demonstrate the importance of MADD in the control of cancer cell survival/death and in conferring significant resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In addition, our results indicate the therapeutic potential of MADD abrogation in enhancing TRAIL-induced selective apoptosis of cancer cells."

It is widespread in the western United States, although it has only been present there for just over 100 years. As a result, there has been very little time for diversity to accumulate in this region. Much of the diversity that has been detected among North American isolates is at loci that mutate too quickly to accurately reconstruct large-scale phylogenetic patterns. Slowly-evolving but stable markers such as SNPs could be useful for this purpose, but are difficult to identify due to the monomorphic nature of North American isolates.To identify SNPs that are polymorphic among North American populations of Y. pestis, a gapped genome sequence of Y. pestis strain FV-1 was generated. Sequence comparison of FV-1 with another North American strain, CO92, identified 19 new SNP loci that differ among North American isolates.The 19 SNP loci identified in this study should facilitate additional studies of the genetic population structure of Y. pestis across North America."

With few exceptions, FBPase exists in nearly all organisms (2Tejwani G.A. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1983; 54: 121-194PubMed Google Scholar) and at some level in nearly all tissues (3Yanez A.J. Nualart F. Droppelmann C. Bertinat R. Brito M. Concha I.I. Slebe J.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 197: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Mammalian FBPases are tetrameric and adopt distinct quaternary states. In the absence of AMP, the enzyme is in an active R-state conformation, whereas the AMP-bound form assumes an inactive T state that differs from the R-state by a 15° rotation between “top” and “bottom” subunit pairs (4Zhang Y.

In principle, hormonal control of levels of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2), a potent inhibitor of FBPase in mammals, determines flux through the gluconeogenic pathway (8Pilkis S.J.

Biofactors. 1999; 10: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Little is known, however, regarding the regulation of FBPases in prokaryotes, organisms that lack Fru-2,6-P2. Prokaryotic organisms express a diverse group of FBPases, classified by levels of sequence homology. The Type I enzyme, which is the subject of this investigation, is the most widely distributed among living organisms, being the primary FBPase in Escherichia coli, most bacteria, a few Archaea, and all eukaryotic organisms known to possess the gluconeogenic pathway (10Fraenkel D.G.

Many bacteria also express a second kind of FBPase (Type II), which in E. coli is encoded by the glpX gene (13Donahue J.L. Bownas J.L. Niehaus W.G. Larson T.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5624-5627Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The physiological role of the Type II enzyme in E. coli is unclear, but it may be the principle FBPase in other organisms (13Donahue J.L. Bownas J.L. Niehaus W.G. Larson T.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5624-5627Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 15Movahedzadeh F. Rison S.C.G. Wheeler P.R. Kendall S.L. Larson T.J. Stoker N.G.

Microbiol. 2003; 180: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Some organisms of the phyla Firmicutes and Fusobacteria, and several of the class Bacteroides, also possess a third kind of FBPase (Type III), whereas Type IV FBPase is prevalent in Archaea and Type V in thermophilic Archaea and at least one hyperthermophilic bacterium (17Fujita Y. Yoshida K.-I. Miwa Y. Yanai N. Nagakawa E. Kasahara Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4309-4313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Stec B. Yang H. Johnson K.A. Chen L. Roberts M.F. Nat. Struct.

Structure. 2004; 12: 949-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Type I FBPase in E. coli most likely generates anabolic precursors for nucleotide, polysaccharide, and aromatic amino acid biosynthesis from gluconeogenic substrates (10Fraenkel D.G. Horecker B.L. J. Bacteriol. 1965; 90: 837-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Fraenkel D.G. Pontremoli S. Horecker B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1966; 114: 4-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Fructose-6-phosphate-1-kinase (PFK) and FBPase define a futile cycle (20Pilkis S.J. El-Maghrabi M.R. Claus T.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 755-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Fraenkel and Horecker (10Fraenkel D.G. Horecker B.L. J. Bacteriol. 1965; 90: 837-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who originally identified the enzyme in E. coli, reported the constitutive expression of FBPase under all growth conditions and suggested the need for a mechanism of metabolic control. Subsequent studies of FBPases in bacteria demonstrated only 2–3-fold variations in enzyme levels under different conditions of growth (10Fraenkel D.G. Horecker B.L. J. Bacteriol. 1965; 90: 837-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Chin A.M. Feldheim D.A. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2424-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22Oh M.-K. Rohlin L. Kao K.C. Liao J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13175-13183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Futile cycling, nonetheless, is minimal under both glycolytic (23Chambost J.-P. Fraenkel D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2867-2869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and gluconeogenic (24Daldal F. Fraenkel D.G. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 390-394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) growth conditions. AMP is the only known physiological inhibitor of E. coli FBPase (25Sedivy J.M. Babul J. Fraenkel D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1656-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar); however, AMP levels remain relatively constant under all growth conditions (26Franzen J.S. Binkley S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 236: 515-519Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Additionally, an E. coli strain, deficient in wild-type FBPase but complemented with an AMP-insensitive mutant of FBPase, exhibits normal growth (25Sedivy J.M. Babul J. Fraenkel D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1656-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Hence, AMP is an unlikely dynamic regulator of E. coli FBPase in vivo. Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) on the other hand relieves AMP inhibition (27Babul J. Guixe V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 225: 944-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 28Marcus F. Edelstein I. Rittenhouse J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 119: 1103-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and could be a physiological activator of FBPase in E. coli (14Hines J.H. Fromm H.J.

Biophys. 1983; 225: 944-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). PEP activates the Type I enzyme from thermophilic bacterium Flavobacterium thermophilum HB8 (29Yoshida M. Oshima T. Imahori K. J. Biochem. 1973; 74: 1183-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and the non-homologous Type II and Type III enzymes from E. coli (13Donahue J.L. Bownas J.L. Niehaus W.G. Larson T.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5624-5627Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and the genus Bacillus (30Opheim D.J. Bernlohr R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 250: 3024-3033Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 31Fujita Y. Freese E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 254: 5340-5349Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Before our previous investigation (14Hines J.H. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18386-18393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the only proposed mechanism for PEP activation was the possible competition between PEP and AMP for a common site on the Type III enzyme from Bacillus licheniformis (30Opheim D.J. Bernlohr R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 250: 3024-3033Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The first crystal structure of an FBPase from bacteria revealed several bound sulfate anions, one of which is at a putative site of allosteric activation (14Hines J.H. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18386-18393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). New conditions of crystal growth have resulted here in structure determinations of E. coli FBPase with bound PEP and with bound citrate. These structures confirm the site of allosteric activation implied by the ligation of sulfate. Unlike AMP, PEP concentrations in bacteria can fluctuate by more than 10-fold between glycolytic and gluconeogenic conditions of growth (32Lowry O.H. Carter J. Ward J.B. Glaser L. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6511-6521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Variations in PEP concentration could be the basis of coordinate regulation of FBPase and PFK, as PEP is also an inhibitor of the latter enzyme (33Blangy D. Buc H. Monod J. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 31: 13-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). We report the direct activation of E. coli FBPase by PEP, citrate, and similar metabolites, providing strong evidence of feed-forward activation of gluconeogenesis in bacteria belonging to distinct phylogenetic groups. PEP and citrate may activate these bacterial FBPases directly by stabilizing the R-state tetramer and indirectly by blocking the AMP pocket via the insertion of a conserved aromatic side chain (Phe15). On the basis of sequence conservation, the anion activation site is present in FBPases from a variety of organisms, including distantly related Flavobacteria. FBPases from organisms within this class should be activated by PEP, a prediction supported by the literature (29Yoshida M. Oshima T. Imahori K. J. Biochem. 1973; 74: 1183-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A consensus sequence for the allosteric activator site suggests a widespread mechanism of regulation in central metabolism in bacteria and other microbes. Materials—Fru-1,6-P2, Fru-2,6-P2, NADP+, oxaloacetate, cis-aconitate, and α-glycerophosphate came from Sigma. PEP, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, fumarate, and malate came from MP Biomedicals. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglucose isomerase were from Roche Applied Sciences. All other chemicals were of reagent grade or equivalent. Crystallization of R-state Complexes—Native and selenomethionine-substituted proteins were prepared as previously described (14Hines J.H. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18386-18393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Crystals were grown by hanging drop in vapor diffusion VDX-plates (Hampton Research). PEP-bound crystals grew from droplets containing 2 μl of a protein solution (15 mg/ml selenomethionine-substituted FBPase, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 mm Fru-1,6-P2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm PEP) and 2 μl of a precipitant solution (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.6, 16% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 1500, and 20% (w/v) sucrose) and were equilibrated over 500 μl of precipitant solution. Citrate-bound crystals were grown similarly using the same protein solution (without PEP) and a precipitant solution containing 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.3, 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, and 20% (w/v) sucrose. Equal-dimensional crystals (0.2–0.3 mm) grew within 3 days at 22 °C under each of the conditions. Data Collection—Crystals were frozen directly in a cold stream of nitrogen without additional cyroprotectants. Data were collected at Iowa State University on a Rigaku R-AXIS IV++ rotating anode/image plate system using CuKα radiation from an Osmic confocal optics system at a temperature of 110 K. The program d*trek (34Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar) was used to index, integrate, scale, and merge intensities, which were then converted to structure factors using the CCP4 (35Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) program TRUNCATE (36French G.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1978; 34: 517-525Crossref Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Structure Determination and Refinement—A molecular replacement solution was obtained from the program AMORE (37Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) using a single subunit from sulfate-bound E. coli FBPase (PDB accession identifier 2GQ1), from which all ligand and water molecules had been removed. Manual adjustments in the conformation of specific residues employed the program XTALVIEW (38McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graph. 1992; 10: 44-46Crossref Google Scholar). The resulting model underwent simulated annealing from 3000 to 300 K in steps of 25 K followed by 100 cycles of energy minimization and thermal parameter refinement using CNS (39Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). Force constants and parameters of stereochemistry were from Engh and Huber (40Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2548) Google Scholar). Restraints for thermal parameter refinement were as follows: 1.5 Å2 for bonded main-chain atoms, 2.0 Å2 for angle main-chain atoms and angle side-chain atoms, and 2.5 Å2 for angle side-chain atoms. Ligands (fructose 6-phosphate and PEP or citrate) and water molecules were fit to omit electron density until no improvement in Rfree was evident. Water molecules with thermal parameters above 50 Å2 or more than 3.2 Å from the nearest hydrogen bonding partner were removed from the final model. Structure and Sequence Comparisons of FBPases—Dimer and tetramer models of FBPase were constructed from single subunits and used in pairwise least squares superpositions between E. coli and porcine liver enzymes using the CCP4 programs PDBSET (41Evans P. MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology. Cambridge, UK1992Google Scholar) and LSQKAB (42Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect A. 1976; 32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2380) Google Scholar). Individual displacements between Cα positions in structures were measured using XTALVIEW (38McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graph. 1992; 10: 44-46Crossref Google Scholar). The canonical R and T states of porcine FBPase used in superpositions have PDB identifiers 1CNQ and 1EYK, respectively, whereas the IT and IR states have identifiers 1Q9D and 1YYZ, respectively. Because the angle of rotation between subunit pairs in various quaternary states of FBPases is sensitive to the subset of residues employed in the least squares fit, the previously established residues used to compare E. coli and porcine FBPases were used for all alignments (14Hines J.H. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18386-18393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignments of Type I FBPases employed the program ClustalW (43Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). Optimal global pairwise alignments, which served as the basis for calculating sequence identity, utilized the program ALIGN (44Pearson W.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 63-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar). Kinetic Experiments—Assays for FBPase activity employed the coupling enzymes phosphoglucose isomerase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and monitored formation of NADPH by either absorbance at 340 nm or fluorescence emission at 470 nm (7Iancu C.V. Mukund S. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19737-19745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Coupling enzymes were dialyzed against a 1000-fold volume of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, to remove ammonium sulfate that would otherwise be present at ∼3mm in all assays. Assays (total volume, 2 ml) were performed at 22 °C in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, with 100 μm EDTA and 150 μm NADP+. Saturating levels of Fru-1,6-P2 (40 μm) and MgCl2 (10 mm) were used to measure specific activity and anion activation effects. Assays were initiated by the addition of 1.4 μg of enzyme (enzyme-initiated assays) or by incubating the enzyme in assay mixtures for 1–2 h at 22 °C without MgCl2 and subsequently initiating the reaction by the addition of metal (enzyme incubation assays). Equations (legend of Fig. 2) were fit to kinetic data using the program IGORPRO (WaveMetrics). Dynamic Light Scattering—Experiments were performed in the assay buffer without coupling enzymes and Mg2+. Samples of E. coli FBPase with subunit concentrations of 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 14 μm were incubated in the presence and absence of 5 mm PEP for 2 h before light scattering measurements at 22 °C. Data were collected in 1-s intervals subdivided into 10 s acquisitions on a Protein Solutions DynaPro dynamic light scattering instrument. Instrumentation software (DYNAMICS V6) facilitated the determination of diffusion coefficients from time correlation curves and the use of such data in the estimation of molecular masses. Estimation of Metabolite Concentrations in E. coli—Amounts of metabolites are often reported in units of mol/g dry weight of bacteria and may be converted to concentrations subject to several assumptions; the cytoplasm is homogenous, the cytoplasmic volume is the free-solution volume of the metabolite, and the total concentration of metabolite is its free concentration. At an optimal osmolarity of 0.28 osmol/liter, Cayley et al. (45Cayley S. Lewis B.A. Guttman H.J. Record Jr., T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 281-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) determined a cytoplasmic volume of 2.08 ± 0.06 × 10–6 liter/mg of dry weight of bacteria. Division by this value converts mol/g dry weight of bacteria to molar concentration. Enzyme Purity—Native and selenomethionine-substituted enzymes are kinetically and structurally indistinguishable (14Hines J.H. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18386-18393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Preparations of enzyme here give specific activities of 35–40 units/mg, appear as single bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (purity level of at least 95%), and have a single residue type (methionine or selenomethionine) at the N terminus. Time-dependent Loss of E. coli FBPase Activity—Activity of E. coli FBPase diminishes upon dilution into assay buffers (Fig. 1). Relative activity falls to ∼70% after 2 min and reaches a threshold of ∼35% after 1 h. Similar results occur in the presence or absence of substrate (40 μm Fru-1,6-P2), reducing agents (5 mm dithiothreitol or β-mercaptoethanol), glycerol, salts (20 mm NaCl, KCl, NH4Cl, or NaC2H3O2), and several buffers (50 mm Tris-malonate, Hepes-NaOH, Tris-HCl, or MES-NaOH). Inorganic sulfates (20 mm Na2SO4, K2SO4, or (NH4)2SO4) and to a lesser extent inorganic phosphates (KH2PO4 or NaH2PO4) reduce activity loss. 5 mm PEP or citrate prevents time-dependent loss of activity while decreasing relative activity by ∼20% (Fig. 1). On the other hand, 5 μm AMP increases the rate of activity loss, reaching a threshold value of ∼15% relative activity. By way of comparison, relative activity is ∼70% in the presence of 5 μm AMP in enzyme-initiated assays. 5mm PEP (Fig. 1) or citrate (not shown) blocks the effects of 5 μm AMP. In contrast to the E. coli enzyme, dilution and PEP have no discernable effect on the activity of porcine FBPase (Fig. 1). Even after incubation in the assay buffer for 4 h at 22 °C, porcine FBPase retains full activity. Variation of Kinetic Parameters with Assay Protocol—Kinetic parameters for E. coli FBPase, determined in the absence of PEP, differ for assays initiated by the addition of enzyme (no incubation) and initiated by the addition of Mg2+ after incubation of the enzyme under conditions of assay (Table 1). Incubation of enzyme for 1 h before initiation increases the Km for Fru-1,6-P2 and the Ka for Mg2+ and decreases kcat. AMP inhibition, cooperative in enzyme-initiated assays (Hill coefficient, ∼1.7), increases dramatically in incubation assays and is noncooperative (Hill coefficient, ∼0.8). Kinetic parameters from incubation assays that include 1 mm PEP, however, are similar to those of enzyme-initiated assays (Table 1).TABLE 1Kinetic parameters for wild-type E. coli and porcine FBPasesEnzymekcatKm Fru-1,6-P2Ka Mg2+Hill Mg2+I0.5 AMPHill AMPs-1μmmmμmE. coliaAssays were initiated by the addition of enzyme.24 ± 31.7 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.118.1 ± 0.51.67 ± 0.08E. colibThe enzyme was incubated for 1 h in assay mixture.

Open table in a new tab Metabolic Activators of E. coli FBPase—Activation by citrate, PEP, and other effectors is evident only in incubation assays. In enzyme-initiated assays, 1 mm PEP has little effect. PEP (or citrate) concentrations of 1–5 mm weakly inhibit enzyme activity, but inhibition is small relative to the magnitude of activation attributed to these ligands in incubation assays. Incubation of E. coli FBPase for 2 h (see “Experimental Procedures” for specific conditions) individually with intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle or 3-carbon intermediates of glycolysis increase relative activity by as much as 500% (Fig. 2). PEP, citrate, 3-phosphoglycerate, cis-aconitate, isocitrate, oxaloacetate, and α-ketoglutarate enhance enzyme activity at concentrations up to 5 mm. PEP is the most potent activator, achieving nearly full activation at ∼50 μm. Citrate exhibits maximal activation comparable with PEP at a concentration of ∼1mm. Relative velocity increases hyperbolically with the concentration of PEP and citrate (Fig. 2), with 50% of maximum activation (A0.5) coming at 27 ± 2 and 210 ± 10 μm, respectively. Concentrations of 10 mm malate or fumarate exhibit weak activation (data not shown). PEP and citrate are antagonists of AMP inhibition (Table 1). The concentration of AMP causing 50% inhibition (I0.5) in incubation assays is 2.2 μm, but in the presence of 40 μm, 1 mm, and 2 mm PEP increases to 6.1, 20, and 44 μm, respectively. The nonlinear variation of I0.5 for AMP with the concentration of PEP probably stems from cooperativity in AMP binding and/or changes in the quaternary state of the enzyme. Citrate (2 mm) increases the I0.5 for AMP to 10 μm. As illustrated in Fig. 1, 5 μm AMP causes no measurable inhibition in the presence of 5 mm PEP (or citrate, not shown). Alternatively, the A0.5 for PEP is 27 ± 2 μm in the absence of AMP and increases to 1.4 ± 0.2 mm in the presence of 40 μm AMP. In contrast to the E. coli enzyme, PEP (2 mm) has no effect on AMP inhibition in porcine FBPase. R-state Structures of E. coli FBPase—R-state crystals of E. coli FBPase belong to the space group I222 for both PEP-bound (a = 44.7, b = 83.1, c = 174.4 Å) and citrate-bound (a = 45.3, b = 83.3, c = 173.4 Å) structures and are isomorphous to crystals of the E. coli enzyme grown in the presence of high concentrations of sulfate (Ref. 14Hines J.H. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18386-18393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar; PDB identifier 2GQ1). Unit cell parameters here and for crystals of the sulfate-ligated enzyme differ by less than 3%. The models for the PEP and citrate complexes (Table 2) are complete except for some residues of the dynamic loop (residues 46–62) for which there is no interpretable electron density. Electron density is present for a molecule of Fru-6-P bound to the active site, but no density appears for inorganic phosphate or Mg2+. Disorder in the dynamic loop may stem from the absence of bound metal and phosphate. The absence of bound phosphate and Mg2+ could be a consequence of low pH and/or non-saturating concentrations of metal ion and/or phosphate. One molecule of PEP or citrate binds per monomer to the same allosteric activator site (Fig. 3). PEP and citrate bind to FBPase stoichiometrically with one water molecule and form extensive networks of hydrogen bonds between top (C1–C2) and bottom (C3–C4) dimers of E. coli FBPase (Fig. 4). Interactions between ligands and protein appear in Table 3.TABLE 2Statistics of data collection and refinement of R-state complexes of E. coli FBPasePEP-bound (PDB ID 2OX3)Citrate-bound (PDB ID 2OWX)Resolution (Å)75.03-2.18 (2.32-2.18)43.84-2.18 (2.32-2.18)Total reflections/unique reflections115,644/17,26188,622/17,445Average redundancy6.7 (6.0)5.1 (4.4)% Com"
https://openalex.org/W2075792257,"ExoS (453 amino acids) is a bi-functional type III cytotoxin produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Residues 96-219 include the Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) domain, and residues 234-453 include the 14-3-3-dependent ADPribosyltransferase domain. Earlier studies also identified an N-terminal domain (termed the membrane localization domain) that comprises residues 51-77 and includes a novel leucine-rich motif that targets ExoS to the perinuclear region of cultured cells. There is limited information on how ExoS or other type III cytotoxins enter and target intracellular host proteins. Type III-delivered ExoS localized to both plasma membrane and perinuclear region, whereas ExoS(ΔMLD) was localized to the cytosol. Plasma membrane localization of ExoS was transient and had a half-life of ∼20 min. Type III-delivered ExoS co-immunoprecipitated 14-3-3 proteins and Rab9, Rab6, and Rab5. Immunofluorescence experiments showed that ExoS colocalized with Rab9, Rab6, and Rab5. Fluorescent energy transfer was detected between ExoS and 14-3-3 proteins but not between ExoS and Rabs proteins. Together, these results indicate that type III-delivered ExoS localizes on the host endosomes and utilizes multiple pathways to traffic from the plasma membrane to the perinuclear region of intoxicated host cells.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen that causes urinary tract, respiratory system, and gastrointestinal infections as well as dermatitis and soft tissue, bone, and joint infections (1Bodey G.P. Bolivar R. Fainstein V. Jadeja L. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1983; 5: 279-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa is also responsible for a variety of systemic infections, particularly in patients with severe burns, cystic fibrosis, and cancer and AIDS patients who are immunocompromised (2Mendelson M.H. Gurtman A. Szabo S. Neibart E. Meyers B.R. Policar M. Cheung T.W. Lillienfeld D. Hammer G. Reddy S. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1994; 18: 886-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa produces multiple cellular effectors that contribute to colonization, invasion, and cytotoxicity, including four type III cytotoxins: ExoS, ExoT, ExoU, and ExoY (3Frank D.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). ExoS is a bi-functional cytotoxin that encodes a Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP) domain (residues 96-219) and a 14-3-3-dependent ADP-ribosyltransferase domain (residues 234-453) (4Barbieri J.T. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2000; 290: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Iglewski et al. (5Iglewski B.H. Sadoff J. Bjorn M.J. Maxwell E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Deletion of the MLD did not inhibit type III secretion of ExoS from P. aeruginosa or delivery of ExoS into mammalian cells, but it interfered with the ADP-ribosylation of Ras (11Pederson K.J. Krall R. Riese M.J. Barbieri J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1381-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This showed the importance of intracellular localization for efficient ADP-ribosylation of host proteins. Upon internalization, many bacterial AB exotoxins exploit the mammalian cell retrograde trafficking systems and escape into the cytosol from different organelles, including endosomes, Golgi, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (13Sandvig K. van Deurs B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Among these, the trafficking routes between endosomes and trans-Golgi network (TGN) are diverse and involve multiple pathways, including early, late, or recycling endosomes. Ricin is transported to the Golgi complex independent of recycling endosomes (Rab11), late endosomes (Rab7 and Rab9) (14Sandvig K. van Deurs B. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 949-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 15Melby E.L. Prydz K. Olsnes S. Sandvig K. J. Cell.

Cell. 2001; 12: 2099-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and appears to exploit more than one pathway. Similarly, shiga toxin B utilizes a direct early/recycling endosome to TGN trafficking that circumvents late endosomes (17Mallard F. Antony C. Tenza D. Salamero J. Goud B. Johannes L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 973-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), which is controlled by specific t-SNARE, early endosomal v-SNARE, and GTPase Rab6A′ (18Mallard F. Tang B.L. Galli T. Tenza D. Saint-Pol A. Yue X. Antony C. Hong W. Goud B. Johannes L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Retrograde trafficking of cholera toxin from the plasma membrane to the Golgi involves multiple endocytosis pathways to allow cholera toxin access to the Golgi/ER (19Lencer W.I. Saslowsky D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1746: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Inhibition of endocytosis by clathrin-, caveolin-, or ARF6-dependent mechanisms did not block cholera toxin movement into the cell or attenuate toxicity (20Kirkham M. Fujita A. Chadda R. Nixon S.J. Kurzchalia T.V. Sharma D.K. Pagano R.E. Hancock J.F. Mayor S. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 21Massol R.H. Larsen J.E. Fujinaga Y. Lencer W.I. Kirchhausen T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3631-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In BSC1 cells, although inhibition with dynamin and ARF6 pathways together blocked transport of cholera toxin into the cell by light microscopy, these inhibitors did not affect toxin potency. The molecular identity of this pathway remains to be identified, but it likely involves the membrane cholesterol and sphingomyelin homeostatic machinery (19Lencer W.I. Saslowsky D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1746: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Recently, the retrograde trafficking of Pseudomonas exotoxin A was observed to involve both Rab9-dependent and Rab9-independent pathways (22Smith D.C. Spooner R.A. Watson P.D. Murray J.L. Hodge T.W. Amessou M. Johannes L. Lord J.M. Roberts L.M. Traffic. 2006; 7: 379-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Partial localization of exotoxin A within the detergent-resistant membrane may permit a choice of trafficking routes, controlled by host lipid- and protein-sorting signals (22Smith D.C. Spooner R.A. Watson P.D. Murray J.L. Hodge T.W. Amessou M. Johannes L. Lord J.M. Roberts L.M. Traffic. 2006; 7: 379-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Intracellular localization of several type III cytotoxins has been observed previously. YopM localizes to the nucleus and stimulates the activity of PRK2 and RSK1 kinases (23Skrzypek E. Cowan C. Straley S.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 1051-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 24McDonald C. Vacratsis P.O. Bliska J.B. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18514-18523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). YopH localizes to the focal adhesion complexes and is essential for anti-phagocytosis and virulence (25Persson C. Nordfelth R. Andersson K. Forsberg A. Wolf-Watz H. Fallman M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 828-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). YopE localizes to cytoplasmic granules and the perinuclear region (26Frithz-Lindsten E. Holmstrom A. Jacobsson L. Soltani M.

Chem. 2004; 279: 2747-2753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, how type III toxins traffic in intoxicated cells has not been established. This study shows that type III-delivered ExoS localizes temporally on the plasma membrane and associates with markers of early and late endosomes. Materials—HeLa cells (CCL-2) were from the ATCC. Tissue culture media and sera were from Invitrogen. Reagents for molecular and cell biological techniques were from New England Biolabs or Invitrogen, and chemicals were from Sigma, unless noted. DNA primers were from Operon Technologies. Bacterial Strains and Construction of Vectors—P. aeruginosa strain PA103 (ΔexoU, exoT::Tc) with a pUCP derivative to express the indicated form of ExoS was cultured as described previously (10Pederson K.J. Pal S. Vallis A.J. Frank D.W. Barbieri J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 11Pederson K.J. Krall R. Riese M.J. Barbieri J.T. Mol.

ExoS-KDD and ExoSΔMLD-KDD were generated by QuikChange using ExoS R146K, E381D (29Riese M.J. Goehring U.M. Ehrmantraut M.E. Moss J. Barbieri J.T. Aktories K. Schmidt G. J. Biol.

Primers are as follows: positive, 5′-AGCGGGATATGGAACTACAAGAATGACAAAGACATTCTTTATAAC-3′, and negative, 5′-ATCGATGTCAGCGGGATATCGAACTACAAGAATGACAAAGACATTCTTTATAACAAAGAAACC-3′. ExoS-KDD-3xFLAG and ExoSΔMLD-KDD-3xFLAG were generated by subcloning. pUCP-ExoS-KDD and pUCPExoS ΔMLD-KDD were digested with SalI/BamHI. Fragments encoding 3xFLAG (SalI/BamHI) was subcloned into the digested vector. 3xFLAG positive (+) primers were as follows: 5′-TCGACAGACTACAAAGACCATGACGGTGATTATAAAGATCATGACATCGATTACAAGGATGACGATGACAAGTGAG-3′. 3xFLAG negative (-) primers were as follows: 5′-GATCCTCACTTGTCATCGTCATCCTTGTAATCGATGTCATGATCTTTATAATCACCGTCATGGTCTTTGTAGTCTG-3′. After ligation, vectors were electroporated into P. aeruginosa PA103 (ΔexoU, exoT::Tc) and selected by carbenicillin resistance. Construction of RasWT and Ras(C181S,C184S)—pET16b c-H-Ras vector was a gift from H. Fu (Emory University) (30Ganesan A.K. Frank D.W. Misra R.P. Schmidt G. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7332-7337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A QuikChange PCR was performed to generate Ras(C181S,C184S); primers were as follows: +,5′-GAGAGTGGCCCCGGCTCCATGAGCTCCAAGTGTGTGCTCTCC-3′, and -,5′-GGAGAGCACACACTTGGAGCTCATGGAGCCGGGGCCACTCTC-3′. The PCR product was DpnI-digested, ligated into pEGFP-N1, and transformed into Escherichia coli TG1. A second PCR was performed to amplify His-Ras(C181S,C184S), using BglII/SalI as restriction sites. The PCR product was cloned into pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech) to express His-Ras(C181S,C184S) in mammalian cells. Using pET16b c-Ha-Ras as template, a PCR was performed to amplify the H-RasWT gene, and the PCR product was subcloned into pEGFP-C1 vector with KpnI and BamHI restriction site. Primers were as follows: +,5′-GATCGATCGGTACCCATATGACAGAATACAAGCTT-3′, and -,5′-GATCGATCGGATCCTCAGGAGAGCACACACTTG-3′. PCR products were sequenced to confirm mutations. Cell Culture Growth—HeLa cells were cultured in complete medium (minimum essential medium + 10% fetal calf serum, nonessential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, sodium bicarbonate and penicillin/streptomycin) and maintained in a 37 °C humidified 5% CO2 (v/v) incubator. Transfection and Cellular Fractionation of HeLa Cells—HeLa cells were seeded in 85-mm dishes with 3 × 105 cells the day before use. Cells were grown to 70% confluency and transfected with Lipofectamine and Plus reagent-mediated liposome transfer system (Invitrogen), as described by manufacturer, using 1 μg of indicated DNA (31Pederson K.J. Vallis A.J. Aktories K. Frank D.W. Barbieri J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Total DNA was normalized with pCMV10Luc (luciferase) (Kent Wilcox, Medical College of Wisconsin). After 18-24 h, transfected cells were washed twice with PBS, suspended in 10 ml of homogenization buffer (HB1) (250 mm sucrose, 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4), washed in 300 μl of HB1, suspended in 300 μl of HB2 (HB1 plus 1% mammalian protease inhibitor mixture set III (Sigma) and 0.5 mm EDTA). Cells were lysed by passage 20 times through a 25-gauge needle. The whole-cell lysate was centrifuged for 5 min at 2000 rpm in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C, and the pellet (nuclei and unbroken cells) and postnuclear supernatant (PNS) were collected. The PNS was centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g, and the pellet (membrane) and supernatant (cytosol) were collected. Samples were normalized to volume equivalent with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled, and stored at -20 °C. Type III Delivery of ExoS into HeLa Cells—HeLa cells were cultured in 6-well plates to 70% confluency and transfected with 200 ng of the indicated plasmid. After 18-24 h, cells were infected at a multiplicity of 8:1 (bacteria:HeLa cells) of P. aeruginosa PA103 ΔexoU, exoT::Tc (pUCP) (32Schweizer H.P. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 97: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) as control, and the indicated ExoS construct, including pUCPExoS (33Kulich S.M. Frank D.W. Barbieri J.T. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or pUCPExoS R146K, E379D, E381D, termed KDD. After 3.5 h, HeLa cells were washed with PBS and treated with 100 μg/ml gentamicin and 200 μg/ml ciprofloxacin to kill extracellular bacteria. At the indicated time, cells were washed twice with PBS, and lysates were prepared and subjected to subcellular fractionation or cells were treated with 1% paraformaldehyde and examined by direct fluorescence, subjected to immunofluorescence analysis, or phase-contrast microscopy. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HeLa cells seeded on coverslips in 6-well plates were infected with P. aeruginosa PA103 ΔexoU, exoT::Tc (pUCP-ExoS-KDD) at an m.o.i. of 8:1 (bacteria:HeLa). Four hours postinfection, cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 4% formaldehyde (15 min at room temperature), which was followed by three washes with PBS. Cells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 20 min at room temperature and then incubated with individual antibodies. For Rab6/ExoS double staining, cells were incubated with rabbit α-Rab6 IgG (1:500) and mouse α-HA IgG (1:1,000) for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times with PBS, incubated with goat α-rabbit IgG-Alexa-488 (1:500) and goat α-mouse IgG-Alexa-568 (1:500). For Rab5 and Rab9 staining, cells were first stained with either mouse α-Rab5 IgG (1:500) or mouse α-Rab9 IgG (1:200), followed by incubation with goat α-mouse IgG-Alexa-488. Next, cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS, and stained with prelabeled mouse α-HA IgG-(Fab)2-Alexa-568 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Zenon prelabeling kit, Molecular Probes). Cells were then washed, mounted, and observed under a ×60 oil objective. Images were captured with a Ropor camera using Metamorph software and cropped in Adobe Photoshop. Confocal images were obtained on a Leica TCS SP2 laser scanning confocal microscope at the Bryant Imaging Facility, Medical College of Wisconsin. Incidence of fluorescence between two flurochromes was determined as described in ImageJ software. Briefly, ICQ numbers of the boxed regions of analyzed figures were calculated by ImageJ plugin intensity correlation analysis (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Typical values are as follows: random (or independent) staining ICQ =∼0; dependent staining 0 < ICQ ≤ +0.5; and segregated (or exclusive) staining 0 > ICQ ≥ -0.5. For quantification of the percentage plasma membrane localization, random fields of HeLa cells were scored by a blinded observer. Plasma membrane association of ExoS was scored by focusing through the entire cell. Mouse α-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody was from Covance (catalog number MMS-101P); mouse α-Rab9 antibody was from Calbiochem (catalog number 552101). Rabbit α-Rab6 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (C-19). Mouse α-Rab5 antibody was from BD Transduction Laboratories (catalog number R60020-050). Mouse α-Rab4 antibody was from BD Transduction Laboratories (catalog number 610888). AlexaFluor goat α-mouse or α-rabbit IgG was from Molecular Probes. Sheep α-human TGN46 was from Serotec (catalog number AHP500). Rabbit α-calnexin was from Stress-Gen (catalog number SPA-865). Immunoblot Analysis—The PNS was subjected to SDS-PAGE (11-12%) and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. Membranes were incubated with the indicated primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature, washed with PBS, and then incubated for 1 h with goat α-mouse-HRP IgG or goat α-rabbit-HRP IgG (1:40,000; Pierce). HRP was developed with SuperSignal (Pierce) and exposed to x-ray film, which was developed in a film processor or digitized with an Alpha-Inatech 8900 imaging system. Mouse α-HRas antibody was from BD Transduction Laboratories (catalog number R02120-150). Mouse α-GFP antibody was from Covance (catalog number MMS-118P). Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) of Host Protein Bound to Type III-delivered ExoS—HeLa cells were plated in 150-mm dishes and grown to 90% confluency. Cells were infected with P. aeruginosa expressing a vector control (pUCP), ExoSΔMLD-KDD, or ExoS-KDD at an m.o.i. of 8:1 (bacteria:HeLa). Note, both ExoSΔMLD-KDD and ExoS-KDD used in this co-IP had a 3xFLAG (Sigma) epitope engineered onto the C terminus (Fig. 1). After 4-5 h of infection, HeLa cells were harvested, and 600 μl of PNS were collected as described in the cell fractionation protocol. NaCl was added to a final concentration of 150 mm. One hundred and fifty μl of 3x-FLAG antibody-conjugated agarose beads (50% slurry, Sigma) were aliquoted into a microcentrifuge tube. The beads were washed twice with HB2 buffer to remove glycerol. PNS (500 μl) were added to the beads, and the tubes were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C ona wheel rotator. The beads were pelleted with a pulse spin; the supernatant was discarded, and the beads were washed three times with TBS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% mammalian protease inhibitor mixture set III (Sigma), and 0.5 mm EDTA) for 10 min each. The beads were incubated overnight in 150 μg of 3xFLAG peptide in 100 μl of TBS buffer. The suspension was pulse-spun, and the supernatant was analyzed for proteins that were co-immunoprecipitated with ExoS by two-dimensional IEF SDS-PAGE as described previously (34Sun J. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32794-32800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). After extraction, beads were boiled to determine ExoS that remained bound to beads following extraction with the 3xFLAG peptide. Mouse α-FLAG M2 affinity gel was from Sigma (catalog number A2220). 3xFLAG peptide was from Sigma (catalog number F4799). MALDI-TOF Analysis—Bands from five gels were excised and subjected to trypsin digestion (1 μg; Promega, Madison, WI) in 50 μl of 100 mm NH4HCO3, pH8, at 37°C for 24 h. After digestion, gel slices were sonicated twice in 200 μl of 80% acetonitrile and 1% formic acid (in H2O) for 10 min. Eluted material was combined and evaporated, and the pellet was dissolved in 15 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (in H2O). Peptide solutions were desalted with C18 Zip Tips (Millipore, Bedford, MA) that had been equilibrated successively in 15 μl of acetonitrile, 15 μl of 50% acetonitrile (H2O), and 15 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (H2O). Resin was washed twice with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (H2O). Peptides were eluted in 2 μl of 60% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (H2O saturated with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) and applied to a sample plate to air-dry. Samples were ionized by an N2 UV laser using a PE-pro mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). Two hundred laser shots were conducted at an accelerating voltage of 25,000 and laser intensity of 2075 (repetition rate 3 Hz). Scans were processed using Biosystems Voyager 6004 software. Peptide fingerprinting was used to identify proteins present in the band, using Protein Prospector (University of California, San Francisco). Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) Determinations—DNA encoding 14-3-3-γ, 14-3-3-ϵ, or 14-3-3-β was subcloned into pYFP-C1 (Clontech), and DNA encoding ExoS-KDD, ExoS-ΔMLD-KDD, or ExoS-(1-416)-KDD was subcloned into pCFP-N1 (Clontech). HeLa cells cultured on coverslips were co-transfected with 150 ng of pYFP-14-3-3-γ and 150 ng of either p-ExoS-KDD-CFP or p-ExoS-(1-416)-KDD-CFP. Control experiments showed that this ratio of the acceptor to donor yielded optimal FRET measurements (data not shown). 18 h posttransfection, cells were fixed and mounted onto microscope slides. Acceptor photobleach experiments were carried out with a Leica TCS SP2 laser scanning confocal microscope according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the YFP signal in a selected region of interest was bleached with a 514 nm laser until fluorescence was <20% of the original intensity; Fig. 7A shows the bleached area as a box. Average fluorescence intensity of donor (D, CFP) and acceptor (A, YFP) before (pre) and after photobleach (post) was measured. FRET efficiency was calculated with Equation 1, FRETeff=Dpost−DpreDpostfor Dpost>Dpre Control experiments were performed with one frame of photobleach with 0% laser power (35Centonze V.E. Sun M. Masuda A. Gerritsen H. Herman B. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 360: 542-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Tetanolysin Experiments—HeLa cells were permeabilized with tetanolysin (List Biologicals, Campbell, CA) using a procedure adapted from Ahnert-Hilger et al. (36Ahnert-Hilger G. Wegenhorst U. Stecher B. Spicher K. Rosenthal W. Gratz M. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). At the first indication of cell rounding, P. aeruginosa-infected HeLa cells (6-well plate) were washed with PBS at room temperature and incubated in 6 ml total of ice-cold HG1 buffer (20 mm PIPES, 2 mm Na+-ATP, 4.8 mm Mg(CH3COO)2, 150 mm potassium glutamate, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and KOH to obtain pH 7.0) with 2.4 μg of tetanolysin for 15 min and then washed with ice-cold HG1 buffer. Next, 6 ml of total of HG1 buffer containing 20 nm [32P]adenylate phosphate-NAD (10 μCi) were added, and cells were incubated for 40 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were washed in PBS and lysed with the addition of 100 μl of sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. ADP-ribosylation of Ras by Type III-delivered ExoS—pEGFP-His-Ras (C181S,C184S) and pEGFP-His-Ras(WT) were generated, and 600 ng of plasmid encoding GFP-Ras(C181S,C184S) or GFP-RasWT were transfected into HeLa cells. After ∼18 h, cells were intoxicated with P. aeruginosa strain PA103(ΔexoU, exoT::Tc) (pUCPExoS) for 3 h when cells were washed, collected, lysed in sample buffer, and subjected to 11% SDS-PAGE. Ras proteins were detected by ECL, using mouse α-Ras IgG as the primary antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories). Ratio of ADP-ribosylation was calculated as electrophoretically shifted Ras(C181S,C184S) divided by unshifted Ras(C181S,C184S) and analyzed by densitometry. siRNA Knockdown Assay—Protocol is based on Ambion siRNA protocol. Briefly, siPORT™ Amine and NeoFX transfection reagents were mixed with siRNA oligonucleotides and incubated with HeLa cells for 48 h in complete media. Rab9 siRNA was designed by Ambion, and Rab6A/A′ siRNA was designed as described previously (37Del Nery E. Miserey-Lenkei S. Falguieres T. Nizak C. Johannes L. Perez F. Goud B. Traffic. 2006; 7: 394-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Knockdown efficiency of the respective Rab protein was calculated by Western blot as described above for immunoblot analysis. Primers are as follows: Rab9 siRNA+, 5′-GCAGUGUAUCAUCUACUAAtt-3′, and -,5′-UUAGUAGAUGAUAUACACUGCtg-3′; Rab6A/A′siRNA+,5′-GACAUCUUUGAUCACCAGAtt-3′, -,5′-UCUGGUCAAAGAUGUCtt-3′. Type III-delivered ExoS Associates with the Plasma Membrane and Perinuclear Region—How type III cytotoxins localize and traffic within mammalian cells is not clear. To limit toxic effects on the host cell, several noncatalytic forms (ExoSΔMLD-R146K,E379D,E381D) (ExoSΔMLD-KDD) and ExoS(R146K, E379D, E381D) (ExoS-KDD) were used to monitor the intracellular localization of type III-delivered ExoS (Fig. 1). In Fig. 2, the infection was stopped when wild type ExoS (ExoS-WT) fully round the cells. At this time, intoxication with P. aeruginosa expressing pUCP, ExoSΔMLD-KDD, and ExoS-KDD had minimal effect on cell morphology (Fig. 2A). ExoS-WT expression was detectable but less than the noncatalytic ExoS-KDD or ExosΔMLD-KDD due presumably to the toxic nature of the protein. Low expression of the catalytically active ADP-ribosyltransferase domain in transiently transfected mammalian cells has also been observed (38Pederson K.J. Barbieri J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Type III-delivered ExoSΔMLD-KDD localized throughout HeLa cells, whereas ExoS-KDD localized on both the plasma membrane and the perinuclear region (Fig. 2A). Because both ExoSΔMLD-KDD and ExoS-KDD have an HA epitope, the HA epitope did not appear responsible for the observed intracellular localization. HeLa cells infected with ExoSΔMLD-KDD or ExoS-KDD were separated to soluble and membrane fractions by ultracentrifugation. Western blot analysis showed that ExoSΔMLD-KDD was present in the cytosol, whereas ExoS-KDD was distributed in both the membranes and cytosol (Fig. 2B). Cells were pretransfected with pGFP, and GFP was used as an internal control for efficiency of cell fractionation. To determine whether the plasma membrane localization was an intrinsic property of type III-delivered ExoS, localization of transfected ExoSΔMLD-KDD and ExoS-KDD was examined. ExoSΔMLD-KDD localized throughout the cells, whereas ExoS-KDD accumulated near the perinuclear region without apparent plasma membrane association (Fig. 2C); quantification of the staining is also shown. This indicates that the MLD-depende"
https://openalex.org/W2066203052,"The localized activation of circulating glucocorticoids in vivo by the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) plays a critical role in the development of the metabolic syndrome. However, the precise contribution of 11β-HSD1 in the initiation of adipogenesis by inactive glucocorticoids is not fully understood. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts can be terminally differentiated to mature adipocytes in a glucocorticoid-dependent manner. Both inactive rodent dehydrocorticosterone and human cortisone were able to substitute for the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone in 3T3-L1 adipogenesis, suggesting a potential role for 11β-HSD1 in these effects. Differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells caused a strong increase in 11β-HSD1 protein levels, which occurred late in the differentiation protocol. Reduction of 11β-HSD1 activity in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, achieved by pharmacological inhibition or adenovirally mediated delivery of short hairpin RNA constructs, specifically blocked the ability of inactive glucocorticoids to drive 3T3-L1 differentiation. However, even modest increases in exogenous 11β-HSD1 expression in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, to levels comparable with endogenous 11β-HSD1 in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, were sufficient to block adipogenesis. Luciferase reporter assays indicated that overexpressed 11β-HSD1 was catalyzing the inactivating dehydrogenase reaction, because the ability of both active and inactive glucocorticoids to activate the glucocorticoid receptor were largely suppressed. These results suggest that the temporal regulation of 11β-HSD1 expression is tightly controlled in 3T3-L1 cells, so as to mediate the initiation of differentiation by inactive glucocorticoids and also to prevent the inhibitory activity of prematurely expressed 11β-HSD1 during adipogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2102135923,"The strand-biased mutation spectrum in vertebrate mitochondrial genomes results in an AC-rich L-strand and a GT-rich H-strand. Because the L-strand is the sense strand of 12 protein-coding genes out of the 13, the third codon position is overall strongly AC-biased. The wobble site of the anticodon of the 22 mitochondrial tRNAs is either U or G to pair with the most abundant synonymous codon, with only one exception. The wobble site of Met-tRNA is C instead of U, forming the Watson-Crick match with AUG instead of AUA, the latter being much more frequent than the former. This has been attributed to a compromise between translation initiation and elongation; i.e., AUG is not only a methionine codon, but also an initiation codon, and an anticodon matching AUG will increase the initiation rate. However, such an anticodon would impose selection against the use of AUA codons because AUA needs to be wobble-translated. According to this translation conflict hypothesis, AUA should be used relatively less frequently compared to UUA in the UUR codon family. A comprehensive analysis of mitochondrial genomes from a variety of vertebrate species revealed a general deficiency of AUA codons relative to UUA codons. In contrast, urochordate mitochondrial genomes with two tRNAMet genes with CAU and UAU anticodons exhibit increased AUA codon usage. Furthermore, six bivalve mitochondrial genomes with both of their tRNA-Met genes with a CAU anticodon have reduced AUA usage relative to three other bivalve mitochondrial genomes with one of their two tRNA-Met genes having a CAU anticodon and the other having a UAU anticodon. We conclude that the translation conflict hypothesis is empirically supported, and our results highlight the fine details of selection in shaping molecular evolution."

Here we show that following tumor necrosis factor-α stimulation, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) association with IKK is increased. A heptad repeat in IKKγ, helix 2 (HLX2), mediates PP2A recruitment. Two other heptad repeats downstream of HLX2, termed coiled-coil region 2 (CCR2) and leucine zipper (LZ), bind HLX2 and negatively regulate HLX2 interaction with PP2A. HTLV-1 transactivator Tax also binds HLX2, and this interaction is enhanced by CCR2 but reduced by LZ. In the presence of Tax, PP2A-IKKγ binding is greatly strengthened. Interestingly, peptides spanning CCR2 and/or LZ disrupt IKKγ-Tax and IKKγ-PP2A interactions and potently inhibit NF-κB activation by Tax and tumor necrosis factor-α. We propose that when IKK is resting, HLX2, CCR2, and LZ form a helical bundle in which HLX2 is sequestered. The HLX2-CCR2-LZ bundle becomes unfolded by signal-induced modifications of IKKγ or after Tax binding. In this conformation, IKK becomes activated.

I-κBα and I-κBβ in turn become serine-phosphorylated by IKK and are targeted for polyubiquitination and degradation by proteasome (for a recent review, see Ref. 1Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3344) Google Scholar). This leads to nuclear accumulation of NF-κB and activation of mRNA transcription of a large array of cellular genes, including that of I-κBα. The surge in mRNA and protein synthesis of I-κBα is then accompanied by its transport to the nucleus and the redistribution of NF-κB/I-κBα complex back to the cytoplasm (1Hayden M.S. Ghosh S.

The core IKK consists of two highly homologous catalytic subunits α and β of 85 and 87 kDa in sizes, respectively, and a 48-kDa regulatory subunit, IKKγ/NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO, referred to as IKKγ herein) (5Yamaoka S.

Ben Neriah Y.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4057) Google Scholar). Both IKKα and IKKβ contain NH2-terminal kinase domains followed by leucine zippers (LZ) and helix-loop-helix domains that mediate protein-protein interactions important for IKK oligomerization and kinase activity (6Karin M.

Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). IKKγ also contains extensive helical regions and leucine zipper domains that are involved in protein-protein interaction (5Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E.

It is not clear what other protein components are present in the holo-IKK enzyme complex in addition to IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ (6Karin M. Ben Neriah Y.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4057) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the stoichiometry of IKK holoenzyme is α1β1γ2 or β2γ2, with each IKK holoenzyme containing two IKKγ subunits (8Miller B.S. Zandi E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36320-36326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Finally, tetramerization of IKKγ has also been reported to be important for IKK activation (9Tegethoff S. Behlke J. Scheidereit C. Mol. Cell.

Although the mechanisms for IKK activation have been extensively studied, the molecular events that control rapid IKK down-regulation are not well understood.

While IKKγ is essential for IKK activation, the mechanism through which IKKγ controls IKK activity remains unclear. We have shown that via a tripartite interaction, Tax, PP2A, and IKKγ form a stable ternary complex, wherein PP2A activity is inhibited or diminished due to its interaction with Tax (16Fu D.X.

In essence, IKK is activated by serine phosphorylation upon extracellular stimulation. Phospho-IKK then becomes rapidly inactivated by IKKγ-associated PP2A, returning it to the resting state. These results suggest that in HTLV-I infected or transformed cells, PP2A inhibition by IKKγ-bound Tax maintains IKK in an active, phosphorylated state, causing constitutive phosphorylation and degradation of I-κB (16Fu D.X.

IKKγ contains multiple α-helical heptad repeats that include HLX1 (helix-loop-helix 1), CCR1 (colied-coil region 1), HLX2, CCR2, and LZ (leucine zipper). HLX1 and CCR1 regions are important for IKKγ interaction with IKKα and IKKβ (25May M.J. Marienfeld R.B. Ghosh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45992-46000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 26May M.J. D'Acquisto F. Madge L.A. Glockner J. Pober J.S. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 289: 1550-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). In this study, the protein-protein interaction of IKKγ, PP2A, and Tax is investigated. We have localized HLX2 heptad repeat of IKKγ to be the primary binding domain of PP2A and Tax and have shown additionally that HLX2, CCR2, and LZ interact with one another dynamically to modulate PP2A recruitment and Tax interaction. Our results suggest that the structures of HLX2, CCR2, and LZ possibly alternate between a helical bundle (closed/inactive conformation) and an extended α-helix (open/active conformation) to regulate the accessibility of HLX2 to PP2A. Tax, through its interaction with HLX2 and CCR2, maintains IKKγ in an open/active conformation. Although this structure avidly recruits PP2A, the latter is inhibited by Tax, thereby keeping IKK constitutively active. CCR2 and LZ peptides possibly stabilize the HLX2-CCR2-LZ bundle, thereby keeping IKKγ in a closed conformation and preventing PP2A and Tax from binding IKKγ. These data indicate that the dynamic interaction of HLX2-CCR2-LZ heptad repeats modulates the recruitment of PP2A and allows IKKγ to function as a molecular switch that can turn IKK on or off rapidly. HTLV-1 Tax Interaction with IKKγ and PP2A keeps the switch at the “on” position and IKK constitutively active.

For the yeast three-hybrid assays, tax cDNA was placed under the control of the Met-25 promoter on HO-pMET-poly-KanMX4-HO vector (28Tirode F. Malaguti C. Romero F. Attar R. Camonis J. Egly J.M. J.

The activities of β-galactosidase were measured using an “enhanced β-galactosidase assay kit (CPRG)” purchased from Gene Therapy Systems (San Diego, CA) as prescribed by the vender and normalized against the absorbance unit of each culture.

Antibodies against HA, KT3, and EE epitopes were obtained from Covance Inc. Glutathione S-transferase Pulldown Assays—For production of GST-IKKγ fusion proteins, the coding sequences for full-length IKKγ and truncated variants were generated using standard PCR methods as above. Constructs were ligated into the NcoI/EcoRI insertion site of pGEX-2T. Bacterial lysis, recombinant protein purification, and binding to glutathione beads was done as described previously (16Fu D.X.

For GST pulldown experiments, 500 ng each of purified GST, GST-IKKγ, or GST-IKKγ truncated variants were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 1.0 ml of cell lysate from 293T cells transfected with the EE-PP2A Aα expression plasmid. Cell lysate was prepared by incubating ∼7 × 106 cells with 1 ml of a buffer solution containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 0.15% Nonidet P-40, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Incubation of the lysate with the beads, washing, and subsequent immunoblots were done as reported previously (16Fu D.X. Kuo Y.L. Liu B.Y. Jeang K.T. Giam C.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1487-1493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), except that 120 μl of a 50% slurry of prewashed glutathione-Sepharose 4B was added to each binding reaction. S-Agarose PullDown—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were transfected with one or more of the following constructs: H6/S-PP2ACα, EE-PP2AAα, HA-IKKγ, and PP2ACα. PCR was used to generate the hexa-histidine and RNase S-peptide-tagged (H6/S)-PP2ACα cDNA, which was ligated into the EcoRI/NotI insertion site of pTriEx-4Neo. Cell lysates from the transfected 293T cells were used for the S-agarose pulldown assay. Lysis buffer contained 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (as prescribed by Roche Applied Science). Cell lysate, obtained by incubating 7 × 106 cells with 1 ml of lysis buffer, was mixed with 0.2 ml of S-protein-agarose beads (Novagen) at 4 °C for 2 h. Beads from each sample were washed four times with a buffer solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, then boiled for 7 min with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting as described previously (16Fu D.X.

Co-immunoprecipitation—For IKKγ-HA immunoprecipitation, transfected 293T cells were harvested and washed twice with cold PBS, lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and incubated on ice for 15 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Lysates were precleared by incubation with 20 μl of 50% slurry of protein G-agrose (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Anti-HA-agarose (Covance) was mixed with the precleared cell lysates and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The reaction mixtures were then washed three times with cold lysis buffer, boiled for 7 min with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and analyzed by immunoblots as described (16Fu D.X. Kuo Y.L. Liu B.Y. Jeang K.T. Giam C.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1487-1493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The IKKγ immunoprecipitation was done similarly, except that IKKγ antibody was used. Immunoprecipitation of whole cell lysates prepared from Jurkat and MT4 cells was similar as above except an anti-PP2A A subnit antibody and 107 cells each were used; and the lysis buffer contained only 0.1% Trition X-100. DNA Transfection, TNF-α Induction, and Luciferase Reporter Assay—The coding sequences for influenza HA-VP16 activation-domain fusion (HAVP), HAVP-CCR2, HAVP-LZ, and HAVP-CCR2-LZ were generated by PCR and ligated into the EcoRI/BamHI insertion site of pcDNA 3.1. HEK293T cells were seeded in 24-well plates (2.5 × 104 cells/well) and transfected using the calcium phosphate (Invitrogen) method with 1 μg of E-selectin-luciferase reporter, 0.5 μg of pRL-TK (Renilla luciferase internal control), and the expression plasmid for the respective IKKγ peptides (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2 μg). The total amount of DNA was normalized by the addition of pcDNA3.1. For TNF-α induction, at 40 h post-transfection, 2 ng/ml human TNF-α (Sigma) was added, and incubation was continued for 8 h. At the end of TNF-α treatment, the recipient cells were lysed with a reporter lysis buffer (luciferase reagent, Promega). Luciferase activity was detected with a luminometer after mixing 10 μl of extract with 25 μl of luciferase substrate (Promega). For NF-κB activation by Tax, 0.5 μg of Tax expression vector was transfected into 293T cells. PP2A Associates with Activated IKK—We have shown previously that the catalytic C subunit of PP2A (PP2Ac), Tax, and IKK form a stable ternary complex (16Fu D.X. Kuo Y.L. Liu B.Y. Jeang K.T. Giam C.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1487-1493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To investigate the physiological role of PP2A in regulating IKK, we used co-immunoprecipitation to measure their association in the presence or absence of extracellular stimulation. As shown in Fig. 1, only weak IKK-PP2A binding was detectable in 293T cells that were resting (Fig. 1, lane 3). Interestingly, when 293T cells were stimulated with TNF-α, concurrent with IKK activation and I-κB degradation, PP2A binding to IKK was greatly increased (Fig. 1, lane 4). We interpret these data to suggest that the recruitment of PP2A to IKK is responsible for the rapid down-regulation of IKK following TNF-α signaling. To determine whether Tax and IKKγ interact with the PP2A holoenzyme, 293T cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids for HA-tagged IKKγ, EE-tagged PP2A Aα (A subunit), and His/S-peptide-tagged PP2A Cα (C subunit) in different combinations. Co-immunoprecipitation with HA antibody indicated that both PP2ACα and PP2AAα interact with IKKγ (Fig. 2A). Likewise, pull down of PP2A Cα using agarose beads conjugated with RNase-S-protein showed that PP2A Cα interacted with both IKKγ and PP2A Aα (Fig. 2B). As might be expected, IKKβ was also detected in the pull-down of PP2A Cα.4 We next examined interactions between PP2A B subunits and IKKγ. Here again, 293T cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids for HA-IKKγ and each of three KT3-tagged PP2A B subunits: Bα, B′γ, and B″72, respectively. Immunoprecipitation with HA antibody indicated that IKKγ associated with all three B subunits (Fig. 2C). This suggests that IKKγ probably interacts with multiple isoforms of PP2A holoenzyme containing different B subunits and is consistent with previous data showing the C subunit to be the direct mediator of the interaction. To confirm a direct interaction between PP2A holoenzyme with IKKγ in vivo, immunoprecipitation was carried out for cell lysates derived from an HTLV-1-transformed T cell line, MT4, and an HTLV-1-unrelated T cell line, Jurkat, using the PP2A A subunit antibody. As expected, PP2A A antibody co-precipitated both the PP2A A and C subunits (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4). Importantly, IKKγ also co-precipitated with the PP2A A subunit (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4). Consistent with the notion that PP2A binding to IKK becomes increased in the presence of Tax, a higher level of IKKγ was found to associate with PP2A in the MT4 cell lysate (compare Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4). Finally, purified PP2A enzyme comprising largely of A and C subunits (from Upstate Biotechnology Inc.; Fig. 3B, lane 5) was mixed with GST-IKKγ or GST in the presence or absence of purified, bacterially derived Tax protein (16Fu D.X. Kuo Y.L. Liu B.Y. Jeang K.T. Giam C.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1487-1493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and incubated with glutathione-agarose beads to pull down GST-IKKγ or GST and the associated proteins. As shown in Fig. 3B, no interaction between PP2A with GST was detectable irrespective of the addition of Tax (lanes 1 and 3). While a weak association between PP2A and GST-IKKγ could be seen (lane 2), a much stronger binding of both PP2A A and C subunits to GST-IKKγ was observed in the presence of Tax. Together, these results support the idea that PP2A holoenzyme becomes recruited to TNF-α-activated or Tax-activated IKK. The HLX2 Domain of IKKγ Interacts with PP2A—To localize the domain(s) of IKKγ that interacts with PP2A, a series of IKKγ COOH-terminal truncations were made wherein the various helical domains of IKKγ were successively deleted. These truncations were designed based on the paircoil and multicoil programs of Bonnie Berger (29McDonnell A.V. Jiang T. Keating A.E. Berger B. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 356-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The deletions were fused with GST to facilitate their purification and analysis. Extracts from 293T cells transfectants transiently expressing EE-PP2A Aα were then incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads charged with purified GST-tagged IKKγ-1-86, IKKγ-1-188, IKKγ-1-253, IKKγ-1-307, or full-length IKKγ-1-419. Because PP2A C and A subunits are tightly associated, the capture of EE-PP2A Aα by the GST fusions with various IKKγ deletions was used as a surrogate for PP2A binding. Proteins bound to the beads were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with either anti-EE or anti-GST antibody. The pulldown experiment revealed the following order of binding affinities to PP2A Aα: IKKγ-1-253 ≫ IKKγ-1-307, IKKγ-1-419 ≫ IKKγ-1-188. Binding of PP2A to IKKγ-1-86 was not detectable (Fig. 4). Based on this result, we conclude that the primary PP2A-binding site of IKKγ resides in the HLX2 domain, between amino acid residues 188 and 253. In a complementary approach, the coding sequences of IKKγ deletions and PP2A Cα were fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain (BD) and the VP16 activation domain (AD), respectively, and introduced into a Saccharomyces cerevisiae reporter strain, L40, for two-hybrid analysis (27Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 30Shih H.M. Goldman P.S. De Maggio A.J. Hollenberg S.M. Goodman R.H. Hoekstra M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13896-13901Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In agreement with the results above that point to the importance of IKKγ-188-253, the two-hybrid system also revealed the affinity of interaction between IKKγ derivatives and PP2A Cα in an order similar to the pulldown results, i.e. BDIKKγ-1-253 > BDIKKγ-1-307 > BDIKKγ-1-419 >>> BDIKKγ-1-188 and BDIKKγ-151-419 (Fig. 5A, solid bars). Neither BDIKKγ-1-86 nor BDIKKγ-151-307 interacted with PP2A Cα (Fig. 5A, solid bars). Because the protein sequence and overall structure of S. cerevisiae and human PP2A C subunits are highly homologous, the human PP2A Cα expressed here most likely exists as a holoenzyme with the S. cerevisiae A and B subunits. The NH2-terminal helical domains of IKKγ have been shown to be critical for binding IKKα and IKKβ (25May M.J. Marienfeld R.B. Ghosh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45992-46000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 26May M.J. D'Acquisto F. Madge L.A. Glockner J. Pober J.S. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 289: 1550-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). This domain may also be important for the integrity of IKKγ structure such that a deletion of IKKγ amino acid residues 1-150 drastically reduced binding to PP2A Cα (Fig. 5, A and B). In aggregate, these data suggest that the region spanning the HLX2 heptad repeat (amino acids 188-253) is critical for PP2A interaction. Importantly, inclusion of the COOH-terminal CCR2 (amino acids 254-303) and LZ (amino acids 304-365) heptad repeats significantly attenuated HLX2 interaction with PP2A (Fig. 5A, BDIKKγ-1-307 and BDIKKγ-1-419, respectively) suggesting that CCR2 and LZ heptad repeats negatively modulate the accessibility of HLX2 to PP2A. Tax Enhances PP2A-IKKγ Binding by Interacting with HLX2 and CCR2 Domains—A similar yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed to map the Tax-binding domain in IKKγ. In contrast to the results described above, BD-IKKγ-1-307, which contained both the HLX2 and CCR2 region, was found to bind Tax the strongest, followed by BD-IKKγ-1-253 and BD-IKKγ-1-419 (Fig. 5A, open bars). Weak interaction was detected for BD-IKKγ-1-188, -151-419, and -151-307 (Fig. 5A, open bars). Little or no interaction between Tax and IKKγ-1-86 was found. These results suggest that Tax and PP2A bind to distinct, but overlapping, regions of IKKγ. Here again, the LZ domain exerted a negative influence on Tax-IKKγ binding also, but unlike PP2A-IKKγ interaction, CCR2 increased Tax-IKKγ binding (compare Fig. 5A, BDIKKγ-1-253 and BDIKKγ-1-307, open bars). We next investigated how Tax affects IKKγ interaction with PP2A. To this end, a yeast three-hybrid system was employed wherein tax gene was placed under the control of the Met25 promoter (kindly provided by J. M. Egly; Ref. 28Tirode F. Malaguti C. Romero F.

In this study, we generated a novel sequence-specific antigene molecule ""Zorro LNA"", which simultaneously binds to both strands, and that induced effective and specific strand invasion into DNA duplexes and potent inhibition of gene transcription, also in a cellular context. By comparing the Zorro LNA with linear LNA as well as an optimized bisPNA (peptide nucleic acid) oligonucleotide directed against the same target sites, respectively, we found that the Zorro LNA construct was unique in its ability to arrest gene transcription in mammalian cells. To our knowledge, this is the first time that in mammalian cells, gene transcription was blocked by a nucleic acid analog in a sequence-specific way using low but saturated binding of a blocking agent. This offers a novel type of antigene drug that is easy to synthesize."
https://openalex.org/W2107528785,"The artificial intervention of biological rhythms remains an exciting challenge. Here, we proposed artificial control strategies that were developed to mediate the collective rhythms emerging in multicellular structures. Based on noisy repressilators and by injecting a periodic control amount to the extracellular medium, we introduced two typical kinds of control models. In one, there are information exchanges among cells, where signaling molecules receive the injected stimulus that freely diffuses toward/from the intercellular medium. In the other, there is no information exchange among cells, but signaling molecules also receive the stimulus that directionally diffuses into each cell from the common environment. We uncovered physical mechanisms for how the stimulus induces, enhances or ruins collective rhythms. We found that only when the extrinsic period is close to an integer multiplicity of the averaged intrinsic period can the collective behaviors be induced/enhanced; otherwise, the stimulus possibly ruins the achieved collective behaviors. Such entrainment properties of these oscillators to external signals would be exploited by realistic living cells to sense external signals. Our results not only provide a new perspective to the understanding of the interplays between extrinsic stimuli and intrinsic physiological rhythms, but also would lead to the development of medical therapies or devices."
https://openalex.org/W1969087016,"Osmotic down shock causes an immediate influx of Ca2+ in yeast, likely through a membrane stretch-sensitive channel. To see how this channel is constituted and regulated, we screened the collection of 4,906 yeast gene deletants for major changes in this response by luminomtery. We discovered deletants that responded very strongly to much milder down shocks than wild-type required, but show little changes in up-shock response. Of all the possibilities (general metabolism, ion distribution, cytoskeleton, cell wall, membrane receptors, etc.), most of the over-responders turned out to be deleted of proteins functioning in the biogenesis of phospholipids, sphingolipids, or ergosterol. Other over-responders are annotated to have vesicular transport defects, traceable to lipid defects in some cases. The deletant lacking the de novo synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, opi3delta, is by far the strongest over-responder. opi3 deletion does not cause non-specific leakage but greatly sensitizes the force-sensing Ca2+-influx mechanism. Choline supplementation normalizes the opi3delta response. Thus, the osmotic-pressure induced stretch force apparently controls channel activities through lipids. This unbiased examination of the yeast genome supports the view that forces intrinsic to the bilayer are determined by the geometry of the lipids and these forces, in turn, govern the activities of proteins embedded therein."
https://openalex.org/W2122635824,"In vitro differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells is often used to study hematopoiesis. However, the differentiation pathway of lymphocytes, in particular natural killer (NK) cells, from ES cells is still unclear. Here, we used a multi-step in vitro ES cell differentiation system to study lymphocyte development from ES cells, and to characterize NK developmental intermediates. We generated embryoid bodies (EBs) from ES cells, isolated CD34+ EB cells and cultured them on OP9 stroma with a cocktail of cytokines to generate cells we termed ES-derived hematopoietic progenitors (ES-HPs). EB cell subsets, as well as ES-HPs derived from EBs, were tested for NK, T, B and myeloid lineage potentials using lineage specific cultures. ES-HPs derived from CD34+ EBs differentiated into NK cells when cultured on OP9 stroma with IL-2 and IL-15, and into T cells on Delta-like 1-transduced OP9 (OP9-DL1) with IL-7 and Flt3-L. Among CD34+ EB cells, NK and T cell potentials were detected in a CD45− subset, whereas CD45+ EB cells had myeloid but not lymphoid potentials. Limiting dilution analysis of ES-HPs generated from CD34+CD45− EB cells showed that CD45+Mac-1−Ter119− ES-HPs are highly enriched for NK progenitors, but they also have T, B and myeloid potentials. We concluded that CD45−CD34+ EB cells have lymphoid potential, and they differentiate into more mature CD45+Lin− hematopoietic progenitors that have lymphoid and myeloid potential. NK progenitors among ES-HPs are CD122− and they rapidly acquire CD122 as they differentiate along the NK lineage."

Human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a cytokine that promotes the proliferation and maturation of neutrophils, eosinophils, and macrophages from bone marrow progenitors. We fused GM-CSF to Bcl-XL and examined the capacity of this chimera to bind human cells through the GM-CSF receptor and prevent apoptosis.

Bcl-2 family proteins are central regulators of programmed cell death. Their function is to integrate survival and death signals that are generated inside and outside cells and mediate the commitment step to cell death. After this point, an execution phase begins with release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and caspase activation. Downstream caspase activation triggers the morphological and biochemical changes associated with efficient cell catabolism (1Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev.

Granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) 2The abbreviations used are: GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; Lfn, lethal factor receptor-binding domain; Tat, human immunodeficiency virus trans-activator of transcription; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; PI, propidium iodide; sts, staurosporine; AgTyr490, tyrphostin AG490; BFU-E, burst-forming unit-erythroid; CFU-GM, colony-forming unit-granulocyte/macrophage; SCF, stem cell factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; IL, interleukin. was originally discovered by the capacity to stimulate both granulocyte and macrophage colony growth from precursor cells in mouse bone marrow (14Burgess A.W. Metcalf D. Blood. 1980; 56: 947-958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that this cytokine has other functions mainly arising from its ability to affect the cell number and the activation state of more mature cells such as granulocytes, macrophages, and eosinophils particularly during immune and inflammatory reactions. The functions of GM-CSF are mediated by binding to a specific receptor comprised of a GM-CSF specific α chain and, in humans, a signal transducing β subunit, which is shared with IL-3 and IL-5 receptors (15Kitamura T. Sato N. Arai K. Miyajima A. Cell. 1991; 66: 1165-1174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 16Tavernier J. Devos R. Cornelis S. Tuypens T. Van der Heyden J. Fiers W. Plaetinck G.

GM-CSF receptors are found in tissues derived from hematopoietic cells as well as in other cell types including those in the nervous system, such as astro-cytes, oligodendrocytes, bone marrow-derived microglia, and to a lesser extent on neurons (18Sawada M. Itoh Y. Suzumura A. Marunouchi T. Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 160: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The predominant clinical use of GM-CSF is to accelerate marrow recovery after cancer chemotherapy and considerable interest has focused on the use of GM-CSF in stem cell transplantation either for peripheral blood mobilization of stem cells to allow peripheral blood stem cell collection or after autologous stem cell transplantation to decrease the duration of neutropenia (19Hubel K. Dale D.C. Liles W.C. J. Infect. Dis. 2002; 185: 1490-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). GM-CSF also induces destruction of tumor cells in vitro by stimulating peripheral blood monocytes (20Grabstein K.H. Urdal D.L. Tushinski R.J. Mochizuki D.Y. Price V.L. Cantrell M.A. Gillis S. Conlon P.J. Science. 1986; 232: 506-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), enhances dendritic cell maturation (21Basak S.K. Harui A. Stolina M. Sharma S. Mitani K. Dubinett S.M.

Ther. 2005; 12: 18-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Augmentation of stem cell expansion could increase the supply of cells for dendritic cell vaccines for cancer immunotherapy (22Slukvin I.I. Vodyanik M.A. Thomson J.A. Gumenyuk M.E. Choi K.D. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 2924-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To further enhance cell survival by reducing apoptosis in cells expressing GM-CSF receptors, we fused the gene of the human growth factor, GM-CSF, to the gene for the human pro-survival protein Bcl-XL. We find that a chimeric protein comprised of GM-CSF and Bcl-XL significantly extends monocyte survival beyond the activity of GM-CSF and may afford an improved treatment for monocytopenia. Construction of the GM-CSF-Bcl-XL Plasmid—The GM-CSF cDNA digested with NdeI and BamHI (New England Biolab, Beverly, MA) was ligated with the cDNA of human Bcl-XL digested with BglII and EcoRI. The fused cDNA was then cloned into the plasmid pET28b(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI) digested with NdeI and EcoRI. Protein Expression—Escherichia coli BL21 DE3 (strain One-Shot® BL21DE3, Invitrogen) was used to express the GM-CSF-Bcl-XL fusion protein. Recombinant bacteria (transformed with the expression plasmid pET28+ containing the cDNA for GM-CSF-Bcl-XL) were grown in 1L of Super Broth (3.2% tryp-tone, 2.0% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, pH 7.5, KD Medical, Columbia, MD) containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin (Sigma) in 2-liter flasks at 37 °C. Protein expression was induced by addition of 1 mm of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma) when the A600 reached 0.8-1 OD. After 3 h incubation, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g, and after resuspension in His tag binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 20 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl), pellets were lysed by French press. The inclusion bodies with cellular debris were collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g and washed four times with 20 ml of binding buffer. The supernatant from the final centrifugation was removed, and the inclusion bodies were dissolved in 30 ml of binding buffer containing 6 m guanidine HCl. After incubation on ice for 1 h to completely dissolve the protein, the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-micron membrane prior to performing His tag affinity chromatography in denaturating conditions. The column was loaded with the prepared extract and washed with 5 volumes of binding buffer containing 6 m guanidine and 10 volumes of washing buffer (60 mm imidazole, 20 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl) containing 6 m guanidine HCl. The bound protein was eluted with 4 volumes of elute buffer (1 m imidazole, 20 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl) containing 6 m guanidine HCl. The eluted protein was reduced by adding 25 mm dithiothreitol and refolded by dropwise dilution in a 100-fold volume of the refolding buffer (0.1 m Tris/Cl, pH 8, 0.5 m arginine, 1 mm oxidized glutathione) followed by incubation at 25 °C for 48-72 h. The protein was concentrated with an Amicon Ultra 15 MWCO 10,000 (Millipore, Bedford MA) until a concentration ≥1 mg/ml and dialyzed against PBS. The quality of purified proteins was analyzed by 4-20% SDS-PAGE stained with Brilliant Blue R and Western blotting using a His tag primary antibody (Novagen). The concentration of GM-CSF-Bcl-XL was determined by a colorimetric assay (BCA kit, Pierce). Final yield of GM-CSF-Bcl-XL was between 2-5 mg/liter of culture. The protein was sterilized by filtration through a 0.22 micron membrane and was stored at 4 °C. Binding Assay—To determine the binding affinity of unlabeled proteins relative to that of GM-CSF, HL60 cells were plated in 96-well plates in binding buffer (RPMI containing 1% bovine serum albumin) and incubated with 125I-GM-CSF 10 nm with and without different concentrations of unlabeled proteins. After 30 min in ice, the cells were centrifuged and washed with binding buffer and then counted. Cell Lines and Cell Viability Assay—HL-60, HeLa, A431, and J774A1 cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Buffy coats and aphaeresis of normal healthy donors were obtained from the National Institutes of Health Blood Bank. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated on Ficoll gradients. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells were resuspended in RPMI, 10% fetal calf serum (Biofluids, Rockvile MD) and incubated for 2 h in tissue culture dishes 150 × 25 mm. The medium, which contains nonadherent cells, was removed, and the cells were washed two times with complete RPMI. The adherent monocytes/macrophages were gently scraped and centrifuged. Monocyte/macrophage cells were incubated at concentrations of 1 × 105 cells/ml in 96-well microtiter plates, overnight, and treated with various concentrations of purified proteins for the required time in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, 20% fetal calf serum, 10 ng/ml IL-3, 10 ng/ml IL-6, 10 ng/ml G-CSF. To access the biological activity of the recombinant protein, different kinds of assay were performed. Cell viability was determined with the Celltiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Promega, Madison WI). The number of viable cells was determined by quantitation of the ATP present, which signals the presence of metabolically active cells. The amount of ATP was measured as luminescence produced by the mono-oxygenation of luciferin catalyzed by the Ultra-Glo-luciferase. Calculation of apoptotic cells was performed using the ApoOne Homogeneous Caspase 3/7 Assay kit (Promega) and by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. The caspase 3/7 protease activity was measured as fluorescent intensity subsequent to the cleavage of the substrate bis-N-carbobenzyloxy-DEVD-rhodamine 110. For FACS analysis, HL-60 cells (1 × 106 cells/sample) were labeled with Annexin V-FITC (Apoptosis Detection kit, Trevigen), Hoechst 33342, and propidium iodide (PI) (Vybrant Apoptosis Assay kit #5, Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's specifications. The cells were analyzed using a dual laser FACSVantage SE flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Annexin V-FITC and PI signals were excited using a 488-nm laser light and their emissions captured using bandpass filters set at 530 ± 30 and 613 ± 20 nm, respectively. Hoechst 33342 was excited using a 351-nm UV laser light and its emission captured with a bandpass filter set at 450 ± 20 nm. Cell Quest Acquisition and Analysis software (BD Biosciences) was used to acquire and quantify the fluorescence signal intensities and to graph the data as bivariate dot density plots. Fluorescence emissions of individual fluorophores were corrected for spectral overlap using electronic compensation. Human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors from a single donor (Stem Cell Technologies) were seeded at 600 cells/dish for the measurement of burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) and colony-forming unit-granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM) in complete or incomplete methylcellulose-based medium (Stem Cell Technologies). The components of the complete methylcellulose medium were: 1.0% methylcellulose in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, 30% fetal bovine serum, 1% bovine serum Albumin, 10-4 2-Mercaptoethanol, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 ng/ml rh stem cell factor, 10 ng/ml GM-CSF, 10 ng/ml IL-3, and 3 units/ml erythropoietin. The incomplete methylcellulose medium does not contain the added cytokines and growth factors. Expression of GM-CSF-Bcl-XL—In an attempt to prevent death of cells of the myeloid lineage, we designed a GM-CSF-Bcl-XL fusion protein that may be able to deliver Bcl-XL into cells to inhibit apoptosis. The cDNA of human Bcl-XL was fused to the 3′ end of the cDNA for human GM-CSF (Fig. 1A). GM-CSF-Bcl-XL protein expressed in E. coli was insoluble and found in inclusion bodies. After denaturation and purification of the His-tagged protein by affinity chromatography, the protein was refolded by dilution in the presence of glutathione and arginine. The resulting protein was ≥90% homogeneous and had the expected molecular weight as shown by SDS-PAGE and Western blot (Fig. 1B, lane 1). To confirm the folding of the recombinant fusion protein for the GM-CSF receptor, we tested its ability to bind HL-60 cells and to displace radiolabeled GM-CSF. As shown in Fig. 1C, the EC50 of GM-CSF-Bcl-XL, the concentration necessary for 50% competition of 125I-GM-CSF, was 1.54 nm. Although the affinity is 73 times less than the affinity of the cytokine alone (EC50 = 0.021), the calculated value is similar to the values found for other chimeric proteins containing human GM-CSF as the receptor-binding domain and in the nanomolar range (24Kreitman R.J. Pastan I. Blood. 1997; 90: 252-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To compare expression, efficacy, and the importance of the C-terminal membrane anchor of Bcl-XL, a construct, GM-CSF-Bcl-XLΔC, carrying Bcl-XL-(1-209), lacking the C-terminal 24 amino acids, fused to the C terminus of GM-CSF, was also cloned, expressed in E. coli and purified (Fig. 1B, lane 2). GM-CSF-Bcl-XL Stimulates HL-60 Proliferation—We tested the biological activities of the fusion proteins on a myeloid cell line expressing the GM-CSF receptor at the concentration corresponding to that of another GM-CSF chimera at its highest biological activity (25Antignani A. Youle R.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4074-4082Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). As shown in the top panel of Fig. 1D, GM-CSF-Bcl-XL stimulated HL-60 cell proliferation to a greater extent than GM-CSF alone. After 48 h there was a 30% increase in cell number in the presence of the chimera, relative to control cells, perhaps due to an inhibition of a background cell death rate in the cell culture. GM-CSF-Bcl-XL extended cell survival in the presence of the broad specificity kinase inhibitor, staurosporine (sts), from 24 h until at least 72 h. After 48-h incubation in the presence of GM-CSF-Bcl-XL and sts, the number of cells is similar to the number of control cells incubated with PBS and after 72 h only 20% of the cells died compared with 50% in the untreated population. In contrast, GM-CSF is not able to block the cytotoxic effect of sts although the concentration is largely in excess with respect to the GM-CSF-binding sites (24Kreitman R.J. Pastan I. Blood. 1997; 90: 252-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also found that the GM-CSF-Bcl-XL chimera protected HL-60 cells from apoptosis induced by sts (Fig. 1D, bottom) as the caspase activity in cells treated with GM-CSF-Bcl-XL was less than cells treated with either GM-CSF or with PBS (Fig. 1D). The prosurvival activity of GM-CSF-Bcl-XLΔC lacking the C-terminal tail was comparable with that of the chimera of GM-CSF with full-length Bcl-XL (Fig. 1D). This is similar to another Bcl-XL chimeric protein (9Liu X.H. Collier R.J. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46326-46332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) indicating that the C terminus of Bcl-XL is not essential for the prosurvival activity. Since the yield of GM-CSF-Bcl-XL was higher than the yield of GM-CSF-Bcl-XLΔC, we used GM-CSF-Bcl-XL for the subsequent experiments. Antiapoptotic Effect of GM-CSF-Bcl-XL—An early and ubiquitous event in apoptosis is the flipping of phosphatidylserine from the inner to the outer side of the plasma membrane lipid bilayer allowing its detection by the phosphatidyl-binding protein Annexin V. DNA fragmentation distinctive of apoptotic cells can be detected by staining with a nucleic acid dyes such as the fluorophore Hoechst 33342. Both Annexin V and Hoechst 33342 can be used in combination with PI that stains cells with compromised membrane integrity. PI is excluded from early apoptotic cells but enters into cells with an increased membrane permeability occurring at the later stages of apoptosis or during necrosis. Thus, populations of viable, early apoptotic, late apoptotic, and necrotic cells can be accurately distinguished and quantified by FACS analysis based on their different staining patterns (26Hillion J.A. Takahashi K. Maric D. Ruetzler C. Barker J.L. Hallenbeck J.M. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2005; 25: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). GM-CSF-Bcl-XL protected HL-60 cells from apoptosis induced with sts (Fig. 2C) much better than GM-CSF alone (Fig. 2B). The viable cell population negative for Annexin staining (R9), decreased 80% as early, middle, late apoptotic (R10, R3, R5, R6) and necrotic (R7) cell populations increased upon incubation with sts for 4 h (Fig. 2, A and D). GM-CSF increased the viable cell population about 10% (Fig. 2, B and D), whereas incubation with GM-CSF-Bcl-XL increased viable cells by more than 50% (Fig. 2, C and D). Similar results were found by visually counting cells positive for Hoechst and PI. Cell viability of 30% in control cells exposed to 0.1 μm sts for 24 h increased to 60% upon addition of GM-CSF-Bcl-XL (data not shown). Specificity of the Fusion Protein—We determined the effect of GM-CSF-Bcl-XL on two human cell lines not expressing the GM-CSF receptor and on a mouse cell line expressing the GM-CSF receptor, since it is known that murine GM-CSF receptor does not detectably bind human GM-CSF (27Kaushansky K. Shoemaker S.G. Alfaro S. Brown C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1213-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). When GM-CSF-Bcl-XL was added to GM-CSF receptor negative cells or to cells expressing the mouse receptor neither enhancement of proliferation nor protection from apoptosis were detected, in contrast to the human monocytic cell line positive for the GM-CSF receptor (Fig. 3A), indicating that the binding to the human GM-CSF receptor is required for cell protection activity of GM-CSF-Bcl-XL. To assess the role of internalization of the chimeric protein on bioactivity, we inhibited an early endosome compartment of the endocytotic pathway. We incubated HL-60 cells with NH4Cl that raises the endosomal pH by reducing the proton gradient across the membrane and with bafilomycin A that is a specific inhibitor of the endosomal V-ATPase proton pump. We used a concentration of the two compounds that does not cause significant apoptosis activation (Fig. 3B). Both bafilomycin and NH4Cl blocked the activity of GM-CSF-Bcl-XL indicating that the chimeric protein is specifically bound and internalized by the GM-CSF receptor and requires endosomal acidification to mediate apoptosis inhibition. Effect of Bcl-XL on Monocyte/Macrophage Populations—To determine whether the results obtained with HL-60 cells are valid for normal human hematopoietic cells, monocytes from normal donor peripheral blood were incubated with GM-CSF-Bcl-XL in the presence of sts. Although sts was first described as an inhibitor of protein C kinase, it has become clear that it is a broad specificity inhibitor of a diverse array of different kinases (28Ruegg U.T. Burgess G.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; 10: 218-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). We, therefore, assessed the importance of the Bcl-XL portion in the fusion protein prosurvival activity, using another kinase inhibitor, tyrphostin AG490 (AgTyr490). High affinity binding of GM-CSF to its receptor induces activation of the receptor-associated Jak2 kinase by means of transphosphorylation of the kinase after oligomerization of the receptor subunits. AgTyr490 specifically inhibits the activation of Jak2, blocking leukemic cell growth in vitro and in vivo (29Meydan N. Grunberger T. Dadi H. Shahar M. Arpaia E. Lapidot Z. Leeder J.S. Freedman M. Cohen A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Roifman C.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar, 30Quelle F.W. Sato N. Witthuhn B.A. Inhorn R.C. Eder M. Miyajima A. Griffin J.D. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4335-4341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We incubated monocytic cells with different concentrations of GM-CSF-Bcl-XL in the presence of AgTyr490 or sts for 72 h. As shown in Fig. 4A, the prosurvival effect of an excess of GM-CSF alone is partly inhibited by sts and completely inhibited by AgTyr490. In contrast, GM-CSF-Bcl-XL protects from both kinase inhibitors in a dose-dependent manner. At 0.24 μm GM-CSF-Bcl-XL, slightly less than the 0.36 μm concentration of GM-CSF used in this experiment, a 40 and 30% increase in cell viability was measured in the presence of sts and AgTyr490, respectively, whereas GM-CSF increased cell survival 20 and 0%. We also tested another Bcl-XL fusion protein, Lfn-Bcl-XL (9Liu X.H. Collier R.J. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46326-46332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), that inhibits apoptosis in neurons and should function independently of the GM-CSF receptor. Like GM-CSF-Bcl-XL and in a similar dose range (0.7 μm), Lfn-Bcl-XL inhibited apoptosis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells treated with either sts or AgTyr490. Thus, Bcl-XL fusion proteins can protect monocytes/macrophages from apoptosis even when the prosurvival pathway activated by GM-CSF is inhibited. Cytarabine/AraC and daunorubicin, which have been used for the treatment of leukemias and solid tumors, induce apoptosis (31Bruserud O. Tjonnfjord G. Gjertsen B.T. Foss B. Ernst P. Stem Cells. 2000; 18: 343-351PubMed Google Scholar, 32Guchelaar H.J. Vermes I. Koopmans R.P. Reutelingsperger C.P. Haanen C. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 33Guthridge M.A. Stomski F.C. Thomas D. Woodcock J.M. Bagley C.J. Berndt M.C. Lopez A.F. Stem Cells. 1998; 16: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 34Masquelier M. Zhou Q.F. Gruber A. Vitols S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 67: 1047-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, apoptosis of normal myeloid cells results in one of the major side effects of treatment, myelosuppression. Thus, we determined whether GM-CSF-Bcl-XL would inhibit chemotherapy induced apoptosis. Cytarabine/AraC and daunorubicin induce apoptosis of monocytes as measured by caspase 3/7 activity (Fig. 4B). GM-CSF-Bcl-XL is able to reduce the caspase 3/7 activation in monocytes treated with either of these cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs and the inhibition is more efficient than GM-CSF applied at a slightly higher concentration (Fig. 4B). The decrease in the catalytic activity of caspase 3/7 is dose-dependent and a concentration of GM-CSF-Bcl-XL of 2.4 μm reduces caspase activity about 50% (Fig. 4C). We conclude that GM-CSF-Bcl-XL increases cell viability in cells treated with cytotoxic agents by apoptosis inhibition. GM-CSF-Bcl-XL combines two activities, the GM-CSF kinase activation activity and the Bcl-XL apoptosis inhibition activity to offer a unique approach for myeloprotection. GM-CSF-Bcl-XL and CD34+ Cells—We evaluated the effect of GM-CSF-Bcl-XL on hematopoiesis in methylcellulose semi-solid medium colony assays. CD34+ cells are GM-CSF receptor positive pluripotent cells having both the capacity for self-renewal and the ability of sustained differentiation into all mature hematopoietic lineages. The commitment is determined by the subsequent expression of lineage-restricted antigens and the presence of specific growth factors (35Theilgaard-Monch K. Raaschou-Jensen K. Schjodt K. Heilmann C. Vindelov L. Jacobsen N. Dickmeiss E. Bone Marrow Transplant. 2003; 32: 1125-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). When the CD34+ cells from human bone marrow were plated in medium supplemented with the stem cell factor (SCF), erythropoietin, and cytokines specific for myeloid and erythroid differentiation, GM-CSF-Bcl-XL increased the total number of colonies 2-fold (CFU-GM and BFU-E) (Fig. 5A). The growth of the CFU-GM and BFU-E colonies was drastically impaired by cytarabine. Interestingly, incubation of the CD34+ cells with GM-CSF-Bcl-XL selectively protected the CFU-GM colonies relative to the BFU-E colonies (Fig. 5A), consistent with the GM-CSF receptor mediating delivery of the Bcl-XL in a cell type-selective manner. Deprivation of cytokines caused a complete loss of CFU-GM and BFU-E colonies but GM-CSF-Bcl-XL protected the myeloid precursors from cytokine deprivation. The activity of the fusion protein protected myeloid progenitors from cytokine deprivation and from the cytotoxic effect of cytarabine, stimulating the differentiation only of the precursors of the monocyte/macrophage lineage (Fig. 5B). From these data, it appears that both GM-CSF and Bcl-XL domains contribute to the proliferation/protection activity, whereas the differentiation effect can be attributed to the GM-CSF portion. CD34+ bone marrow cells cultured in the presence of Lfn-Bcl-XL, which targets Bcl-XL to cells through either the tumor endothelial marker 8 or capillary morphogenesis protein 2 receptors, protects cells from the cytotoxic effect of cytarabine but does not induce growth or differentiation in essential medium (Fig. 6). Under the conditions of growth factor/cytokine deprivation, no colonies were found in wells containing Lfn-Bcl-XL (data not shown). However, in growth factor supplemented medium, Lfn-Bcl-XL increased the number of progenitor colonies without any significant difference in activity between BFU-E and CFU-GM compared with cells incubated with PBS (Fig. 5). Thus, in contrast to GM-CSF-Bcl-XL, Lfn-Bcl-XL lacked the specificity of CFU-GM relative to BFU-E and lacked the growth factor-mediated growth stimulation. Therefore, GM-CSF-Bcl-XL combines two complementary growth promoting activities that function by distinct mechanisms in one recombinant fusion protein. Excessive apoptosis can be deleterious in a number of human diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders, stroke, AIDS, and myelosuppression as a major side effect after chemotherapy (36Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6205) Google Scholar). Hematopoietic cells are exceptionally prone to apoptosis due to their continual and rapid turnover making the regulation of their rate of cell death particularly important. In the last decade Bcl-2 family fusion proteins that can enter cells have been produced that promote neuron survival. These constructs contain anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins fused to cell-binding and/or entry domains. In mice, delivery of a Tat protein linked to Bcl-XL significantly reduced brain injury due to a variety of insults (10Cao G. Pei W. Ge H. Liang Q. Luo Y. Sharp F.R. Lu A. Ran R. Graham S.H. Chen J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5423-5431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Dietz G.P. Kilic E. Bahr M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 21: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 12Kilic E. Dietz G.P. Hermann D.M. Bahr M. Ann. Neurol. 2002; 52: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and Bcl-XL, fused to a portion of the receptor-binding domain of the anthrax toxin (lethal factor) that mediates cell binding and entry inhibited axotomy-induced apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells after optic nerve transaction (9Liu X.H. Collier R.J. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46326-46332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Lfn-Bcl-XL also increased survival of dorsal horn neurons and ventral horn motoneurons after experimental spinal cord injury in rats (13Nesic-Taylor O. Cittelly D. Ye Z. Xu G.Y. Unabia G. Lee J.C. Svrakic N.M. Liu X.H. Youle R.J. Wood T.G. McAdoo D. Westlund K.N. Hulsebosch C.E. Perez-Polo J.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 2005; 79: 628-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, delivery of Bcl-2 family proteins can prevent apoptosis in vivo. We have created a new chimeric protein by fusing a growth factor, GM-CSF, to target human myeloid cells through the GM-CSF receptor, to Bcl-XL that prevents hematopoietic cell apoptosis during treatment with the cytotoxic drugs utilized in chemotherapy. This fusion protein is the first completely human derived prosurvival chimeric protein reported and is therefore expected to elicit a minimal immunogenic response by the patient compared with proteins constructed with viral or bacterial derived domains. Recombinant GM-CSF-Bcl-XL binds monocytes/macrophages expressing the GM-CSF receptor and delivers Bcl-XL into the cells where it blocks cell death. Its efficacy in apoptosis prevention is higher than the action of GM-CSF alone and the protein remains active due to the activity of the Bcl-XL portion even in the presence of specific drugs that inhibit prosurvival signals from the GM-CSF receptor. Indeed, the functional activity of the Bcl-XL portion is demonstrated as well by a similar increase in cell viability in the presence of kinase inhibitors caused by GM-CSF-Bcl-XL compared with Bcl-XL fused to the receptor-binding domain of the anthrax toxin, Lfn-Bcl-XL. GM-CSF-Bcl-XL protects CD34+ progenitor cells from growth factor deprivation and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. In a medium formulated to support optimal growth of erythroid and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, the GM-CSF domain of the chimera drives the maturation of CD34+ precursors toward the monocyte lineage and the Bcl-XL domain rescues the cells from death induced by cytotoxic drugs. The GM-CSF portion is responsible for maturation, because in the absence of growth factors, only CFU-GM colonies survive. It was demonstrated that Bcl-XL is poorly expressed in renewing primary erythroblasts, whereas it is strongly up-regulated in maturing erythroid cells in a strictly Epo-dependent manner. Retroviral transduction of Bcl-XL in erythroid progenitors did not alter their dependence on renewal factors such Epo, SCF, and dexamethasone during sustained proliferation but allowed the cells to undergo terminal erythropoiesis in the complete absence of Epo (37Dolznig H. Habermann B. Stangl K. Deiner E.M. Moriggl R. Beug H. Mullner E.W. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1076-1085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Essentially Bcl-XL protects the erythrocyte progenitors from apoptosis allowing them to complete their differentiation. Similarly, the GM-CSF portion of the GM-CSF-Bcl-xL fusion protein dictates cellular maturation and Bcl-XL protects the progenitor cells. Therefore, even in absence of cytarabine when the CD34+ cells are treated with GM-CSF-Bcl-XL in medium without SCF and erythropoietin, erythroblasts are not derived from the CD34+ progenitors, only monocytes/macrophages. Bcl-XL appears to have no influence on the developmental pathway and simply protects the appropriate lineage from apoptosis. Similar results have been observed in neuronal differentiation pathways exposed to Lfn-Bcl-XL. 3D. J. Hoeppner, A. Antignani, R. J. Youle, and R. D. McKay, unpublished data. We can conclude that the fusion protein technology is an efficient and promising approach to carry proteins to cells and, in particular, since the GM-CSF receptor is expressed on specific cell types, delivery of Bcl-XL through this binding domain may yield a therapeutically relevant approach to regulating cell viability and preventing or reducing consequences of pathological apoptotic processes. Furthermore, we have produced a prosurvival chimeric protein that is derived solely of human sequences and combines both the prosurvival and differentiation activities of the parent domains.

We also thank Dr. Dragan Maric for the FACS analysis and interpretation of the results."
https://openalex.org/W2008256334,"We have synthesized a novel analog of the general anesthetic etomidate in which the ethoxy group has been replaced by an azide group, and which can be used as a photolabel to identify etomidate binding sites. This acyl azide analog is a potent general anesthetic in both rats and tadpoles and, as with etomidate, is stereoselective in its actions, with the R(+) enantiomer being significantly more potent than the S(-) enantiomer. Its effects on α1β2γ2s GABAA receptors expressed in HEK-293 cells are virtually indistinguishable from the parent compound etomidate, showing stereoselective potentiation of GABA-induced currents, as well as direct mimetic effects at higher concentrations. In addition, a point mutation (β2 N265M), which is known to attenuate the potentiating actions of etomidate, also blocks the effects of the acyl azide analog. We have investigated the utility of the analog to identify etomidate binding sites by using it to photolabel human serum albumin, a protein that binds ∼75% of etomidate in human plasma and which is thought to play a major role in its pharmacokinetics. Using HPLC/mass spectrometry we have identified two anesthetic binding sites on HSA. One site is the well-characterized drug binding site I, located in HSA subdomain IIA, and the second site is also an established drug binding site located in subdomain IIIB, which also binds propofol. The acyl azide etomidate may prove to be a useful new photolabel to identify anesthetic binding sites on the GABAA receptor or other putative targets.

The acyl azide etomidate may prove to be a useful new photolabel to identify anesthetic binding sites on the GABAA receptor or other putative targets. Although it is now widely accepted that general anesthetics exert their effects by binding directly to their protein targets (1Campagna J.A. Miller K.W. Forman S.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 2110-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 2Franks N.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 147: S72-S81Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 3Rudolph U. Antkowiak B. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), information on the precise molecular locations of these binding sites has been slow in coming. Most information has been derived from in vitro electrophysiological experiments in which putative anesthetic targets, ion channels, or receptors, are genetically modified. What this approach provides is information on the molecular determinants of anesthetic sensitivity, but it is usually impossible to tell whether these determinants represent portions of anesthetic binding sites or regions of the channel or receptor that are responsible for transducing anesthetic binding into changes in channel gating. In principle, the most direct approach would be to determine a high resolution crystal structure of the ion channel or receptor in question in the presence and absence of anesthetics. Unfortunately, because of the difficulties in crystallizing membrane proteins, such experiments are still some way off. An alternative strategy that has recently had some success is to use anesthetics that have been modified so that they contain photoactivatable groups. When these anesthetic analogs are illuminated with a bright light, they are converted into highly reactive intermediates, which then, hopefully, bind irreversibly to their targets. The idea of using photoaffinity labeling to identify anesthetic binding sites was first implemented using the volatile anesthetic halothane (4Eckenhoff R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15521-15526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 5Eckenhoff R.G. Shuman H. Anesthesiology. 1993; 79: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Halothane breaks down to form highly reactive ethane radicals when illuminated with ultraviolet light at wavelengths around 250 nm, but at these wavelengths there is likely to be some damage to the protein targets themselves. Subsequent work has attempted to improve on these pioneering studies by synthesizing anesthetic analogs with incorporated diazirine groups (6Eckenhoff R.G. Knoll F.J. Greenblatt E.P. Dailey W.P. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 1879-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 7Husain S.S. Forman S.A. Kloczewiak M.A. Addona G.H. Olsen R.W. Pratt M.B. Cohen J.B. Miller K.W. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 3300-3307Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The diazirine moiety absorbs light at longer wavelengths and has been widely used in photolabeling studies (8Blencowe A. Hayes W. Soft Matter. 2005; 1: 178-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and a number of different photoactivatable anesthetics have been synthesized. A diazirine alcohol derivative, 3-(2-hydroxylethyl)-3-n-pentyldiazirin (azioctanol) has been synthesized and characterized (7Husain S.S. Forman S.A. Kloczewiak M.A. Addona G.H. Olsen R.W. Pratt M.B. Cohen J.B. Miller K.W. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 3300-3307Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and shown to label the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor from Torpedo (9Pratt M.B. Husain S.S.

Two regio-isomers of octanol bearing a diazirine group on the third and seventh carbon (3- and 7-azioctanol, respectively) have been used to locate and delineate an anesthetic binding site on adenylate kinase (10Addona G.H.

A diazirine derivative of the intravenous anesthetic etomidate has also been synthesized (12Husain S.S. Ziebell M.R. Ruesch D. Hong F. Arevalo E. Kosterlitz J.A. Olsen R.W. Forman S.A. Cohen J.B.

In the latter case, two particular methionine residues were shown to be labeled. Other workers have synthesized a diazirine derivative of a neuroactive steroid 3α,5β-6-azi-3-hydroxypregnan-20-one (6-AziP), which was shown to label the mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel VDAC in rat brain membranes (15Darbandi-Tonkabon R.

Chem. 2003; 278: 13196-13206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Despite the widespread use of diazirines, other photolabeling approaches are possible and in this article we describe the use of a novel etomidate analog, which incorporates an acyl azide moiety. The azide group produces a highly reactive nitrene on illumination (as opposed to a carbene as is the case for diazirines) and has been used as the photoactivatable group in a number of studies (16Fleming S.A. Tetrahedron. 1995; 51: 12479-12520Crossref Scopus (290) Google Scholar). We show that the etomidate analog behaves essentially identically to the parent compound etomidate in terms of its interactions with the GABAA receptor and its behavior as a general anesthetic in animals. We test the ability of this novel analog to label proteins using human serum albumin (HSA) as a target protein. Albumin is the most abundant protein in human plasma (600 μm) and is known to bind a very large variety of endogenous and exogenous ligands (17Curry S. Brick P. Franks N.P. Biochim Biophys Acta. 1999; 1441: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 18Ghuman J. Zunszain P.A. Petitpas I. Bhattacharya A.A. Otagiri M. Curry S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 38-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). In the case of etomidate, it is estimated that over 75% of the drug is bound to plasma proteins following an intravenous injection (19Meuldermans W.E. Heykants J.J. Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn Ther. 1976; 221: 150-162PubMed Google Scholar); the locations of the binding sites on HSA, however, are unknown. Using our novel etomidate analog we identify two specific binding sites on human serum albumin. Synthesis of Acyl Azide Etomidate—Fig. 1 shows the molecular structure of the acyl azide analogs of etomidate and the parent compound etomidate, together with the reaction scheme for their synthesis. Both isomers (R(+) and S(-)) of this compound were produced using the same synthetic route (see Fig. 1B) but with starting material (methyl benzylamine) of the appropriate chirality in each case. Methyl benzylamine (I) was treated with triethyl amine and ethyl chloroacetate in dimethylformamide. The resulting methylbenzyl glycine ethyl ester was reacted with formic acid in xylene. The crude methylbenzyl-N-formylglycine ethyl ester (II) was distilled to furnish pure product as a yellow oil (53% yield, b.p. 154–160 °C/0.63 mm Hg). This was then treated with freshly prepared sodium methoxide and methyl formate in tetrahydrofuran at 10 °C, followed by reaction of the resulting c-formyl derivative with hydrochloric acid-potassium thiocyanate resulting in the formation of the thiol (III). Oxidative desulfurization of the thiol (III) in the presence of nitric acid-sodium nitrite afforded the desired methyl ester (IV) in 74% yield as a viscous orange oil, which was used without further purification. This was refluxed for 24 h with four equivalents of hydrazine hydrate in ethanol to yield the hydrazide (V) as a pale yellow oil (83% yield). Subsequent reaction of this hydrazide with nitrous acid resulted in the desired product acyl azide (VI) in moderate yield (40%) as an off-white solid (m.p. 58 °C). If too much hydrochloric acid was used in this last step the hydrochloride salt of the acyl azide, m.p. 108–110°, was isolated. The free acyl azide could be obtained from this by treatment with di-isopropylamine. Ultraviolet absorption spectra of compounds were obtained using a Beckman DU650 spectrophotometer. Octanol-water partition coefficients were measured by weighing compounds directly into disposable UV-transparent cuvettes (Brand, Wertheim, Germany) before addition of 2 ml water and 0.5 ml octanol. The cuvette was then inverted repeatedly over 2–3 min, before separation of the two phases by centrifugation. Concentrations in the two phases were then determined spectrophotometrically. Solutions—R(+)-etomidate was obtained as Hypnomidate (2 mg ml-1 in 35% propylene glycol; Janssen-Cilag Ltd, High Wycombe, UK). S(-)-etomidate was synthesized according to previously described procedures (20Godefroi E.F. Janssen P.A. Vandereycken C.A. Vanheertum A.H. Niemegeers C.J. J. Med. Chem. 1965; 8: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. For all experiments, S(-)-etomidate solutions were made up using a stock solution of 2 mg ml-1 in 35% propylene glycol. For the electrophysiological and photolabeling experiments, acyl azide solutions were made up using concentrated stocks in ethanol. The highest concentration of ethanol used (34 mm) was found to have no effect on GABA-activated currents. In the photolabeling experiments, an equivalent amount of ethanol was added to the control solutions. For the in vivo potency measurements, solutions containing the acyl azide were made up from 2 mg ml-1 stock solutions in 35% propylene glycol (tadpole experiments) or from stocks in 100% propylene glycol (upto 6 mg ml-1; rat experiments). In both sets of in vivo experiments, the carrier was found to have no effect by itself. Solutions containing GABA were prepared using concentrated stocks made up in saline on the day of the experiment. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Cell Culture—Modified HEK-293 cells (tsA 201) were maintained in 5% CO2, 95% air in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in growth media (89% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum; 1% penicillin (10,000 units ml-1) and streptomycin (10 mg ml-1)). When the tsA cells were 80% confluent, they were split and plated for transfection onto glass coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine to ensure good cell adhesion. The HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with human cDNAs coding for α1, β2, and γ2s GABAA subunits using the calcium phosphate method. The coding sequences for these three subunits were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK), a vector designed for high expression in mammalian cells. 1 μg of cDNA encoding each subunit was added to each 35-mm diameter well, and 1 μg of a plasmid encoding the cDNA of green fluorescent protein was included to identify cells expressing GABAA receptor cDNAs. Following a 24-h incubation period at 3% CO2 the cells were rinsed with saline and fresh growth medium was added to the wells. The cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2/95% air for 12–72 h before electrophysiological measurements were made. Electrophysiology—Ionic currents evoked by the application of GABA were recorded using the whole cell patch-clamp technique with an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Recording pipettes were pulled from thin-walled borosilicate glass capillaries (Harvard Apparatus, Edenbridge, Kent, UK) using a two-stage vertical puller (Narishige, Tokyo, Japan). After brief fire-polishing, pipettes were back-filled with 0.2 μm-filtered intracellular solution (140 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 11 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, titrated to pH 7.2 with CsOH). These pipettes, with typical resistances of 2.5–4 MΩ, readily formed “giga-ohm” seals with the cells, which upon establishing the whole cell configuration were voltage-clamped at -60 mV. Series resistance was compensated by 80–90%. During recording, cells were bathed in an extracellular solution containing 145 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 5.5 mm d-glucose, 10 mm HEPES, (titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH). All drugs were applied locally to the cell via a double-barreled glass capillary tube as described previously (21Downie D.L. Hall A.C. Lieb W.R. Franks N.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Recordings were filtered at 50 Hz (-3 dB) using an 8-pole Bessel filter (Frequency Devices, Lyons Instruments, Hertfordshire, UK) and digitized at 200 Hz before being stored on a computer hard disk. Data were subsequently analyzed offline using Clampfit software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). All electrophysiological measurements were carried out at room temperature (22 ± 1 °C). Agonist-containing test solutions were typically applied to the cell for 2–5 s. GABA concentration-response data were then fitted using a least squares method to the Hill equation shown in Equation 1.I=Imax[GABA]nH[GABA]nH+EC50nH(Eq.1) For experiments involving anesthetics, test solutions contained the appropriate concentrations of GABA and the anesthetic. High concentrations of anesthetic were found to directly activate receptors in the absence of GABA and therefore to separate this GABA-mimetic effect from the GABA-modulatory effect, the anesthetic was applied before, as well as during, the application of GABA. Anesthetics were typically pre-applied for at least 30 s to ensure that a stable baseline current had been obtained, before application of the GABA-containing test solution. At low concentrations (3 μm or less for R(+)-etomidate), there was no GABA-mimetic effect and pre-application of anesthetics was found to be unnecessary. GABA concentration-response curves in the presence of anesthetic were constructed that were fitted with a Hill equation as before. Anesthetic potentiation (P) was defined by Equation 2 where I0 is the peak of the control GABA-induced current, and I is the peak of the GABA-induced current in the presence of anesthetic.p(%)=100×(I-I0)I0(Eq.2) Values throughout this article are given as means ± S.E. In Vivo Anesthetic Potency Measurements—All experiments were performed in compliance with the United Kingdom Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986. Potency Measurements in Tadpoles—General anesthetic potencies of compounds were determined for 4–6-week-old Rana temporaria tadpoles (Blades Biological, Cowden, Kent, UK) in the pre-limb-bud stage of development. Tadpoles were maintained in an aerated aquarium at 20–22 °C. Groups of 8–12 tadpoles were placed in 400-ml glass beakers containing 300 ml of the anesthetic solution. Stock solutions of acyl azide etomidate were usually made up in the same carrier as used clinically i.e. 2 mg ml-1 in 35% propylene glycol. However, for the highest concentrations of some compounds, a more concentrated stock, 3 mg ml-1, was utilized. The highest concentration of propylene glycol used was 71 mm, which was found to have no effect by itself. The anesthetic end point was defined as the lack of a purposeful and sustained swimming response after a gentle inversion with a smooth glass rod. This was assessed at 10-min intervals over a period of 60 min by which time equilibrium had been reached. After the experiment, tadpoles were returned to fresh tap water where their recovery was monitored. In most cases, normal swimming activity was restored within 1 h. Tadpoles that did not recover were excluded from the analysis. Tadpole concentration-response data were fitted according to the method of Waud (22Waud D.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1972; 183: 577-607PubMed Google Scholar) with a logistic equation of the form in Equation 3,p=100CnCn+(EC50)n(Eq.3) where p is the percentage anesthetized, C is the anesthetic concentration, n is the slope parameter, and EC50 is the concentration required for a half-maximal effect. Potency Measurements in Rats—Experiments were performed on male Sprague-Dawley rats (B & K Universal, London, UK) weighing ∼300 g. Rats were given free access to food and water and were maintained on a 12 h light-dark cycle. Anesthetic solutions were prepared in the same carrier as used clinically, i.e. 35% propylene glycol in water. Anesthetics were administered intravenously through one of the two lateral tail veins using a 24-gauge, 19-mm cannula (Becton Dickinson, Oxford, UK). The cannula was connected to a short length of PTFE tubing using a specially designed stainless steel fitting to ensure a minimal “dead volume” (<15 μl). Solutions were delivered from a 2-ml gas tight syringe (Precision Sampling Corp., Baton Rouge, LA) mounted on a computer-controlled syringe pump. Most experiments were performed using a standard injection protocol that delivered 600 μl of solution over 24 s at a rate of 1500 μl min-1. Animals were restrained during the injection in a specially made plexiglass tube. Immediately after the injection, the animal was placed carefully on its back and was judged as anesthetized if it failed to completely right itself (all four paws on the ground) within 1 min from the start of the injection. Any animal that succeeded in righting itself during this period was scored as awake. Animals were used only once and experiments were carried out at an ambient temperature of 22 ± 1 °C. Quantal dose-response data were fitted to the same logistic equation as before using the Waud method (22Waud D.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1972; 183: 577-607PubMed Google Scholar). Photolysis of Acyl Azide—For photolabeling experiments, solutions of HSA were made up in a 1-ml volume of phosphate-buffered saline (170 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, titrated to pH 7.4 using HCl), before addition of the acyl azide etomidate as a 500× stock solution made up in ethanol. For control experiments in the absence of the acyl azide etomidate, an equivalent amount of ethanol was added instead. Samples were then preincubated for 5 min before transfer to a 4-ml quartz cuvette for exposure to UV light. The cuvette was placed in a polished stainless steel holder for exposures using a 500 watt mercury (xenon) lamp (Lot-Oriel, Leatherhead, Surrey, UK). The light produced by this source was transmitted via a dichroic mirror (280–400-nm reflection band) to remove excess IR radiation, before passing through an interference filter onto the cuvette. Most experiments were performed using a >320 nm band-pass filter (Lot-Oriel). Exposures were controlled using a manual shutter. Samples were continuously mixed during exposure using a small magnetic stirrer. Trypsin Digestion—Following UV exposure, 0.5 ml of the sample was dried down to a volume of about 50 μl using a rotary evaporator (DNA Plus; Jouan Nordic, Denmark), before addition of 0.5 ml of denaturing buffer (6 m guanidine HCl, 0.3 m Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) and incubation for 2 h at 37 °C. The protein was then reduced by addition of 10 μl dithiothreitol (50 mg/ml in denaturing buffer) and incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. Finally, the protein was alkylated to prevent the reformation of disulfide bonds by addition of 80 μl of iodoacetamide (250 mg/ml in denaturing buffer) and incubation at room temperature for a further 30 min. The reduced and alkylated protein was subsequently dialyzed against 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate (pH 7.35) at room temperature for ∼24 h. Protein samples were then digested by addition of 100 μg of “sequencing grade” trypsin and incubation at 37 °C for ∼24 h. Samples were then taken to dryness in a rotary evaporator to yield a white powdery pellet. The ammonium bicarbonate was removed by addition of 5% acetic acid (0.5 ml), after which the sample was again dried down to yield a pellet. This pellet was then resuspended in 5% acetic acid for loading onto HPLC. Analysis by High Performance Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry (HPLC-MS)—Analysis of tryptic peptides of photolabeled HSA was performed using an Agilent 1100 Series HPLC/MS. Generally, a sample volume of 15 μl was used. Peptides were separated on a Vydac C18 column (2.1 mm inner diameter, 250 mm length, Grace Vydac, Strathaven, Lanarkshire, UK) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min at 25 °C. A gradient elution was employed using two solvents, solvent A (0.06% trifluoroacetic acid in water) and solvent B (0.056% trifluoroacetic acid in 80% acetonitrile). The elution profile used was 100% solvent A/0% solvent B to 63% solvent A/37% solvent B over 63 min, then to 25% A/75% B over the next 32 min and then to 2% A/98% B over the next 10 min. The eluent was monitored using a photodiode detector array at wavelengths of 214 nm, 245 nm, and 280 nm. In addition, the output from the HPLC was coupled to an Agilent VL series mass spectrometer, configured to operate in electrospray ionization (ESI) mode. This allowed the detection of positively charged species with mass to charge (m/z) ratios in the range 150–1500. The mass spectrometer was usually configured to run in “scan” mode, whereby the entire m/z range was scanned. However, a “selected ion mode” (SIM) was also used, whereby a defined set of m/z could be searched for selectively, leading to an enhanced signal to noise ratio. HSA Binding Measurements—The extent of binding of etomidate and acyl azide etomidate to HSA was determined by measuring the free aqueous concentration AF of the ligand as a function of total protein concentration PT. Mixtures of HSA and ligand were pre-equilibrated and spun through centrifugal filters with a 10,000 molecular weight cut-off (Centricon YM-10, Millipore, Bedford, MA). The concentration of ligand in the initial spin-though was taken as an estimate of the free aqueous concentration AF. It is easy to show Equation 4,AF=-(PT-AT+K)+(PT-AT+K)2+4KAT2(Eq.4) where K is the ligand dissociation constant and AT is the total ligand concentration. A least-squares fit of the observed data to this equation gave an estimate of the dissociation constant K. Both enantiomers of acyl azide etomidate were synthesized to a high degree of purity (>99%) and the ultraviolet spectra showed a strong absorption band centered at 270 nm (Fig. 1C). (This is in contrast to etomidate which shows a strong absorption band at 240 nm.) The extinction coefficient at the maximum absorption was ϵ270 = 15,500 m-1 cm-1. The absorption at longer wavelengths was still substantial (e.g. ϵ320 = 120 m-1 cm-1) and illumination using a band-pass filter (λ > 320 nm) caused rapid photolysis (Fig. 1C). The time course of photoconversion was roughly exponential with a half-time τ ∼ 8 s. Acyl azide etomidate was stable in aqueous solution, with less than 10% hydrolysis after 4 h. The replacement of the ethyl ether on etomidate for the acyl azide group had very little effect on the overall polarity of the molecule, and the octanol/water partition coefficients were comparable. Table 1 gives the octanol/water partition coefficients for etomidate, acyl azide etomidate, and some related analogs for comparison.TABLE 1Octanol-water partition coefficients and melting points for etomidate and related analogs Open table in a new tab Acyl azide etomidate also displayed a similar in vivo pharmacology to that of the parent compound. This is illustrated by the data in Fig. 2A, which show that the EC50 concentration for loss of righting reflex in tadpoles is 11 ± 2 μm for the R(+) enantiomer and significantly greater for the S(-) enantiomer (36 ± 7 μm), as is the case for etomidate (23Tomlin S.L. Jenkins A. Lieb W.R. Franks N.P. Anesthesiology. 1998; 88: 708-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The R(+) acyl azide etomidate also caused rapid and reversible loss of righting reflex in rats (Fig. 2B) with an ED50 dose of 1.7 ± 0.2 mg kg-1. The in vitro pharmacology of acyl azide etomidate was virtually indistinguishable from that of etomidate. This is illustrated by the data in Fig. 3 for α1β2γ2s GABAA receptors expressed in HEK-293 cells. Both R(+) etomidate and R(+) acyl azide etomidate caused a marked leftwards shift in GABA concentration-response curves. A Hill equation fitted to the control data gave an EC50 of 56 ± 3 μm and a Hill coefficient of nH = 1.3 ± 0.1. These parameters were 11 ± 4 μm and 0.6 ± 0.1 in the presence of 3 μm R(+) etomidate and 11 ± 5 μm and 0.6 ± 0.2 in the presence of 3 μm R(+) acyl azide etomidate. The S(-) enantiomers had no significant effect on the GABA concentration-response curve (Fig. 3, A and B). Both R(+) etomidate and R(+) acyl azide etomidate caused a concentration-dependent and saturable potentiation of GABA-evoked currents (Fig. 3, C and D), which was abolished in receptors which carried the N265M mutation in the β2 subunit (insets to Fig. 3, C and D). This mutation has been shown to block the potentiating action of etomidate (24McGurk K.A. Pistis M. Belelli D. Hope A.G. Lambert J.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 124: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Finally, both R(+) etomidate and R(+) acyl azide etomidate caused a concentration-dependent activation of the α1β2γ2s GABAA receptor in the absence of GABA. This GABA-mimetic effect showed no signs of saturating at high concentrations (Fig. 3, E and F). Having established that R(+) etomidate and R(+) acyl azide etomidate shared very similar in vivo and in vitro pharmacological profiles, we went on to test the ability of R(+) acyl azide etomidate to photolabel a protein target, human serum albumin. This plasma protein is known to play an important role in the pharmacokinetics of etomidate, and ∼75% of etomidate binds to plasma proteins following intravenous injection (19Meuldermans W.E. Heykants J.J. Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn Ther. 1976; 221: 150-162PubMed Google Scholar). We first determined the extent of binding of R(+) etomidate and R(+) acyl azide etomidate to HSA and measured dissociation constants of 176 ± 6 μm and 121 ± 5 μm, respectively. We next developed a protocol using HPLC/MS that would allow the separation a"

Fibulin-4−/− mice die just before birth due to arterial hemorrhage, but fibulin-4+/− mice appear to be outwardly normal. Experiments were therefore performed to determine whether fibulin-4+/− mice display arterial pathologies on a microscopic scale. After preliminary experiments were performed, a second purpose developed, which was to test the hypothesis that any observed pathologies would be ameliorated by housing the animals in enriched cages. Methodology Fibulin-4+/− and wild-type mice were housed either four/cage in standard cages or two per cage in larger cages, each cage containing a tunnel and a wheel. After three weeks the mice were sacrificed, and the aortas perfusion-fixed and excised for light and electron microscopy. Principle Findings When the mice were in standard cages, localized regions of disorganized extracellular matrix and collagen fibers consistently appeared between some of the medial smooth muscle cells in the fibulin-4+/− mice. In the wild-type mice, the smooth muscle cells were closely connected to each other and the media was more compact. The number of disorganized regions per square mm was significantly greater for fibulin-4+/− mice (172±43 (SEM)) than for wild-type mice (15±8) (p<0.01, n = 8). When the mice were in enriched cages, the fibulin-4+/− mice showed significantly fewer disorganized regions than those in standard cages (35±12) (p<0.05, n = 8). The wild type mice also showed fewer disorganized regions (3±2), but this difference was not significant. Conclusions These results indicate that arterial pathologies manifested in fibulin-4+/− mice can be reduced by enriching the housing conditions, and imply that appropriate environments may counteract the effects of some genetic deficiencies."
