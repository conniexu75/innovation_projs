https://openalex.org/W3080788929,"Purpose First, to describe adolescents’ health information sources and knowledge, health literacy (HL), health protective measures, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) during the initial phase of the Covid-19 pandemic in Norway. Second, to investigate the association between HL and the knowledge and behavior relevant for preventing spread of the virus. Third, to explore variables associated with HRQoL in a pandemic environment. Methods This cross-sectional study includes survey data from 2,205 Norwegian adolescents 16–19 years of age. The participants reported on their health information sources, HL, handwashing knowledge and behavior, number of social interactions, and HRQoL. Associations between study variables and specified outcomes were explored using multiple linear and logistic regression analyses. Results Television (TV) and family were indicated to be the main sources for pandemic-related health information. Handwashing, physical distancing, and limiting the number of social contacts were the most frequently reported measures. HL and handwashing knowledge and HL and handwashing behavior were significantly associated. For each unit increase on the HL scale, the participants were 5% more likely to socialize less with friends in comparison to normal. The mean HRQoL was very poor compared to European norms. Being quarantined or isolated and having confirmed or suspected Covid-19 were significantly negatively associated with HRQoL, but seeing less friends than normal was not associated. HL was significantly positively associated with HRQoL, albeit of minor clinical importance. Conclusion Adolescents follow the health authorities’ guidelines and appear highly literate. However, high fidelity requires great sacrifice because the required measures seem to collide with certain aspects that are important for the adolescents’ HRQoL."

To our knowledge, no research has been conducted on mental health problems among patients in Fangcang shelter hospitals. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and major influencing factors of anxiety and depressive symptoms among COVID-19 patients admitted to Fangcang shelter hospitals. From February 23, 2020, to February 26, 2020, we obtained sociodemographic and clinical characteristics information of COVID-19 patients in Jianghan Fangcang Shelter Hospital (Wuhan, China) and assessed their mental health status and sleep quality. Data were obtained with an online questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of a set of items on demographic characteristics, a set of items on clinical characteristics, the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, Self-Rating Depression Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Three hundred seven COVID-19 patients who were admitted to Jianghan Fangcang Shelter Hospital participated in this study. The prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms were 18.6% and 13.4%, respectively. Poor sleep quality and having ≥ two current physical symptoms were independent risk factors for anxiety symptoms. Female sex, having a family member with confirmed COVID-19, and having ≥ two current physical symptoms were independent risk factors for depressive symptoms. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were found to be common among COVID-19 patients in Fangcang Shelter Hospital, with some patients being at high risk."

Having poor knowledge and attitude of the disease among health care providers could bring in impeded effect in the supportive treatment and, it increases the spread of the pandemic. Objective The study aims to assess the knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19, and associated factors among health care providers in Northwest Ethiopia in 2020. Methods Institution based cross-sectional study was conducted from the mid of March to the end of April 2020 among 408 participants who were selected by a simple random sampling technique. Pretested and structured self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. The data were entered using EPI-info v. 7, and were exported to SPSS version 20 for further analysis. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with Knowledge and Attitude towards COVID-19. Variables having p-value < 0.05 were taken as variables which were significantly associated with the dependent variable. Result A total of 408(97.1%) participants have participated in the study. Most of the participants (67.3%) were males. One-third (35.5%) of the participants were nurses. About 62% of the health care providers were Bachelor degree holders. The prevalence of Knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 found to be 73.8% (95%CI: 69.9, 77.9) and 65.7% (95%CI: 61.5, 70.1) respectively. Master degree level of education (AOR = 2.85; 95% CI: 1.25, 6.00) was associated with knowledge of the participants. Similarly, having good knowledge (AOR = 3.17; 95%CI: 1.97, 5.06) was positively associated with the attitude of health care providers towards COVID-19. Conclusion and recommendation Health care providers found to have good knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19. Being Master’s Degree holder and having good knowledge are associated with the knowledge and attitude of the respondents towards COVID-19 respectively. Thus, improving awareness through health education is a significant approach to address the global agenda of COVID-19 Pandemic."

Insights from these analyses provide testable hypotheses and grant direction to drug development efforts in this promising area. The mathematical and analytical tools described in this article may also have broader applications in other areas of biology and chemistry in which ternary complexes are observed. One of the reasons conventional drug development approaches fail to yield a therapeutic agent is a lack of expected in vivo efficacy despite a high degree of target validation by gene knockout or knockdown. In those cases, it is often concluded that the target protein has a scaffolding function in addition to the enzyme activity that was inhibited by the drug candidate molecule (1Rauch J. Volinsky N. Romano D. Kolch W. The secret life of kinases: functions beyond catalysis.Cell. Commun. Signal. 2011; 9 (22035226): 2310.1186/1478-811X-9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Targeted protein degradation has drawn a lot of attention in recent years partly because of its potential to remove the entire protein and reproduce the gene knockout or knockdown phenotypes. Targeting a specific protein for degradation is initiated by recruiting the target protein into a ternary complex with an E3 ubiquitin ligase using a ligand that can bind simultaneously to both (2Sakamoto K.M. Kim K.B. Kumagai A. Mercurio F. Crews C.M. Deshaies R.J. PROTACs: chimeric molecules that target proteins to the Skp1–cullin–F-box complex for ubiquitination and degradation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Drug Discov. 2017; 16 (27885283): 101-11410.1038/nrd.2016.211Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Once a ternary complex is formed, endogenous E2 ubiquitin ligases transfer the ubiquitin to the target protein in a target-oblivious manner as long as the target protein is oriented in such a way that a surface-exposed lysine side chain is available for ubiquitin conjugation (4Deshaies R.J. Joazeiro C.A.P. RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78 (19489725): 399-43410.1146/annurev.biochem.78.101807.093809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar). Certain E3 ligases are known to generate a growing chain of ubiquitin conjugation through Lys48 of the target-conjugated ubiquitin as an acceptor for addition of another ubiquitin. These Lys48-polyubiquitinated proteins are recognized by the cellular proteasome complex and get degraded (5Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. A multiubiquitin chain is confined to specific lysine in a targeted short-lived protein.Science. 1989; 243 (2538923): 1576-158310.1126/science.2538923Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar, 6Lu Y.

There are two different types of ligands that are often utilized for targeted protein degradation: heterobifunctional ligands that are often called PROTAC (proteolysis targeting chimera) (2Sakamoto K.M. Kim K.B. Kumagai A. Mercurio F. Crews C.M. Deshaies R.J. PROTACs: chimeric molecules that target proteins to the Skp1–cullin–F-box complex for ubiquitination and degradation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A heterobifunctional ligand has a ligand for the target protein connected through a linker to another ligand for an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Because of the modular nature of heterobifunctional ligands, they are often the method of choice. The heterobifunctional ligands can be readily constructed from a collection of existing ligands for the target protein and a list of known ligands for different E3 ligases (8Paiva S.L. Crews C.M. Targeted protein degradation: elements of PROTAC design.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2019; 50 (31004963): 111-11910.1016/j.cbpa.2019.02.022Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).

Despite the simplicity in the concept, optimizing the linker type, length, and attachment point to the existing ligand is not a trivial process. All these factors play a role in the overall affinity and efficiency of the ligand for inducing ternary complex formation. Although a large number of the linkers in the literature have a flexible structure in solution, many known X-ray crystal structures of the ternary complex show a tight folding of the linker in such a way to accommodate protein–protein interactions at the interface (19Gadd M.S. Testa A. Lucas X. Chan K.-H. Chen W. Lamont D.J. Zengerle M. Ciulli A. Structural basis of PROTAC cooperative recognition for selective protein degradation.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2017; 13 (28288108): 514-52110.1038/nchembio.2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In this case, the two ligand groups on the heterobifunctional ligand do not act independently of each other. Binding of one end of the ligand to the target protein would cause a large change in the affinity of the other end toward the E3 ligase or vice versa. Such positive or negative cooperativity in two binding events can be critically affected by small changes in the linker length or the structure and by the attachment points of the linker to each of the two ligand groups. Optimizing each of these three components often requires extensive efforts and currently relies largely on empirical outcomes (8Paiva S.L. Crews C.M. Targeted protein degradation: elements of PROTAC design.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2019; 50 (31004963): 111-11910.1016/j.cbpa.2019.02.022Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Objective and quantitative understanding of biochemical properties of ligands during the early phase of the development will be very helpful in guiding the direction of the SAR efforts. A second molecular construct capable of ternary complex formation is known as “molecular glue” (20Neklesa T.K. Winkler J.D. Crews C.M. Targeted protein degradation by PROTACs.Pharmacol. Therapeut. 2017; 174 (28223226): 138-14410.1016/j.pharmthera.2017.02.027Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Molecular glues are smaller (typically <500 Da) than heterobifunctional ligands (mostly ∼1000 Da) (21Che Y. Gilbert A.M. Shanmugasundaram V. Noe M.C. Inducing protein–protein interactions with molecular glues.Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2018; 28 (29980357): 2585-259210.1016/j.bmcl.2018.04.046Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) because dual binding functionality is built into a single pharmacophore without the use of a linker, and they typically show no measurable “hook effect” within a large concentration range, unlike the heterobifunctional ligands. Despite their desirable drug-like properties, molecular glues are difficult to identify and even harder to design in a rational manner, even though progress has been made recently in this direction (22Simonetta K.R. Taygerly J. Boyle K. Basham S.E. Padovani C. Lou Y. Cummins T.J. Yung S.L. von Soly S.K. Kayser F. Kuriyan J. Rape M. Cardozo M. Gallop M.A. Bence N.F. et al.Prospective discovery of small molecule enhancers of an E3 ligase–substrate interaction.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 (30926793): 140210.1038/s41467-019-09358-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Because they lack a modular structure, it is difficult to predict which E3 ligase is most likely to yield a glue-like ligand for the target protein of interest. As a result, heterobifunctional ligands tend to be the preferred method of choice. For targeted protein degradation, ternary complex formation can be considered equivalent to target engagement in the traditional sense of drug action. Although ternary complex formation may not guarantee subsequent polyubiquitination and degradation of the target protein (23Ishoey M. Chorn S. Singh N. Jaeger M.G. Brand M. Paulk J. Bauer S. Erb M.A. Parapatics K. Müller A.C. Bennett K.L. Ecker G.F. Bradner J.E. Winter G.E. Translation termination factor GSPT1 is a phenotypically relevant off-target of heterobifunctional phthalimide degraders.ACS Chem.

Therefore, screening and characterization of ligands often start with an in vitro measurement of ternary complex formation. For traditional drugs that form a binary complex with the target protein, the dose-response curve of the target engagement shows a sigmoidal curve on the semi-log plot, reaching a plateau at sufficiently high ligand concentrations. This behavior is elegantly described by a simple mathematical equation of [B] = [B]max × [L]/([L] + Kd), where [B] is the ligand-bound concentration of the target protein, [B]max is the total target protein concentration, [L] is the free ligand concentration at equilibrium, and Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant of the protein–ligand binary complex. In this binary complex system, two easily measured parameters, [B]/[B]max and Kd, have good predictive value for drug efficacy and potency, respectively. The higher fractional target occupancy, the higher biological response to drug, or efficacy, is expected. The lower the Kd value is, the drug is expected to be more potent or elicit the same biological responses at lower drug concentrations when everything else is equal. In comparison, the dose-response curve of the ternary complex shows the hook effect, or a bell-shaped curve reaching a maximum at certain ligand concentration but falling back down to baseline level at sufficiently high concentrations (12Ohoka N.

Because of this biphasic response, careful dose titration is required for successful degradation of the target using the heterobifunctional ligands. In addition, there are currently no easily measurable biochemical properties that can address the potential efficacy and potency of these molecules as a drug, adding to the long list of challenges in developing therapeutic agents in this mechanism. Currently, no mathematical equation is available to describe the hook effect and full equilibrium binding characteristics of the ternary complex in a universal manner despite widespread occurrence of the ternary complex in multiple scientific disciplines (reviewed in Ref. 33Douglass Jr., E.F. Miller C.J. Sparer G. Shapiro H. Spiegel D.A. A comprehensive mathematical model for three-body binding equilibria.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2013; 135 (23544844): 6092-609910.1021/ja311795dCrossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). It was even demonstrated that solving an exact algebraic equation for the ternary complex as a function of total ligand concentration is mathematically “unsolvable” when the system has cooperativity (33Douglass Jr., E.F. Miller C.J. Sparer G. Shapiro H. Spiegel D.A. A comprehensive mathematical model for three-body binding equilibria.J. Am. Chem.

Cooperative interaction among the components within the ternary complex induced by the heterobifunctional ligands or molecular glue ligands, however, is considered a critical component of efficient target engagement or target degradation (19Gadd M.S. Testa A. Lucas X. Chan K.-H. Chen W. Lamont D.J. Zengerle M. Ciulli A. Structural basis of PROTAC cooperative recognition for selective protein degradation.Nat. Chem.

Lack of proper mathematical and analytical tools to directly address such interaction makes it difficult to relate the experimentally measured data to the equilibrium constants or biochemical properties of the ligand. When the desired outcome of efficient target protein degradation is not achieved, it is difficult to sort out where the problem is and how to fix it. A universal mathematical description of the ternary complex system of all types that can connect the experimentally measured data to the biochemical properties of the complex such as equilibrium constants, potency, and efficacy is sorely desired. In this article, I provide an exact and universal mathematical description of the ternary complex system at equilibrium and its variations that are commonly found in biological systems. This was made possible by solving the mathematical relationships among different components in terms of free ligand concentration at equilibrium rather than total ligand concentration or the initial ligand concentration. Although free ligand concentration is usually not directly measurable, the binary equilibrium equation of [B] = [B]max × [L]/([L] + Kd) is also written in terms of free ligand concentration at equilibrium. This binary equilibrium equation has been universally adopted by scientists of all fields for many decades, and its impact on pharmacology and drug discovery is immeasurable. A similar mathematical equation for the ternary complex that works universally will be extremely valuable. Using mathematical modeling of the system, mechanistic understandings could be obtained for many commonly encountered challenges during development of reagents for targeted protein degradation. Finally, analytical tools were developed that can extract information on potency and efficacy for target engagement, as well as equilibrium constants from the experimental dose-response data. The suite of mathematical tools provided in this article will be helpful in advancing this exciting field of targeted protein degradation and any other discipline involving a ternary complex. An equilibrium binding of a heterobifunctional ligand (L) with its target protein (P) and an E3 ligase (E) shown in Fig. 1A can be completely described by three independent equilibrium constants, KP1, KE1, and α, as defined by Equations 1 – 1, 1 – 2, and 1 – 3 in Fig. 1B. Note that KP1 and KE1 are binary equilibrium dissociation constants, whereas the third parameter, α, is the ratio between the ternary equilibrium dissociation constants (KP2 and KE2) and the corresponding binary equilibrium dissociation constants. As such, α is considered a cooperativity factor by many in the field (19Gadd M.S. Testa A. Lucas X. Chan K.-H. Chen W. Lamont D.J. Zengerle M. Ciulli A. Structural basis of PROTAC cooperative recognition for selective protein degradation.Nat. Chem.

When α is greater than 1, there is a positive cooperativity, whereas a value less than 1 indicates negative cooperativity between the first and second binding events on the same path within the equilibrium diagram. A value of 1 indicates no cooperativity. Universal mathematical equations for this ternary complex system at equilibrium were solved for the first time and are described in Fig. 1B. In short, the concentration of the ternary complex, [PLE], at equilibrium as a function of the free ligand concentration, [L], is given by PLE=fL−f2L−4Pt⋅Et/2 wherefL =Pt+Et+1α⋅LL+KP1L+KE1 where [Pt] and [Et] are total concentrations for the target protein and E3 ligase, respectively. Mathematical equations for the concentration of other species in this diagram and full derivation of these equations are provided in File S1A. Douglas et al. (33Douglass Jr., E.F. Miller C.J. Sparer G. Shapiro H. Spiegel D.A. A comprehensive mathematical model for three-body binding equilibria.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2013; 135 (23544844): 6092-609910.1021/ja311795dCrossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) have previously described a mathematical equation for a ternary complex system, but their solution was limited to a noncooperative system. They have proven that an analytical solution did not exist for a system with a cooperativity. Considering that most ternary complex systems involving heterobifunctional ligands or molecular glues have high degree of cooperativity, a universal solution for the ternary complex system regardless of the cooperativity was critically needed. The equations in this article were solved with the cooperativity factor α built into the model, and the solutions apply universally to all ternary complex systems regardless of α. The key difference between the two mathematical approaches is that the previous work (33Douglass Jr., E.F. Miller C.J. Sparer G. Shapiro H. Spiegel D.A. A comprehensive mathematical model for three-body binding equilibria.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2013; 135 (23544844): 6092-609910.1021/ja311795dCrossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) used total ligand concentration, whereas the current work described the system in terms of the free ligand concentration at equilibrium. An additional benefit of the current work is that these equations are easy to modify to accommodate variations in the system that occur frequently in biological systems as described in detail below. There is a value in being able to calculate the ternary complex concentration in terms of the total ligand concentration because the free ligand concentration is usually not known because of ligand depletion. Although a universal analytical solution does not exist for the concentration of the ternary complex as a function of the total ligand concentration (33Douglass Jr., E.F. Miller C.J. Sparer G. Shapiro H. Spiegel D.A. A comprehensive mathematical model for three-body binding equilibria.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2013; 135 (23544844): 6092-609910.1021/ja311795dCrossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), numeric solution can be easily obtained using the mathematical equations provided in this article. This method is explained in File S1B, and a template is provided with step-by-step instructions in an Excel file in supporting information (BHan_PLEcalc_v1.2_200727.xlsx). The familiar equation for the binary complex system, [B] = [B]max × [L]/([L] + Kd), is also written as a function of the free ligand concentration at equilibrium, and use of total ligand concentration in this equation causes overestimation of the concentration of the bound ligand caused by ligand depletion. The numeric method described in this article can be also used for the binary complex system with a simple modification. The mathematical equations for the two binary complexes in this system, PL and EL, have forms similar to that for a simple binary complex system (Equations 1–8 and 1–10 in File S1A), and the saturation binding curves adopt a sigmoidal shape (open symbols with dotted lines in Fig. 1C) in a manner similar to the simple binary complex systems. The equation for the ternary complex, PLE, takes up a more complicated form (Equations 2 – 1a and 2 – 1b in Fig. 1B) and produces a symmetrical bell-shaped curve (filled circles with a solid line in Fig. 1C) on the semi-log scale, reproducing the well-known hook effect of the heterobifunctional ligands. Unlike the binary complexes (EL and PL) that reach saturated binding at sufficiently high concentrations of the ligand, the ternary complex (PLE) reach"

As positive cases continued to rise in Malaysia, public health laboratories experienced an overwhelming demand for COVID-19 screening. The confirmation of positive cases of COVID-19 has solely been based on the detection of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In efforts to increase the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of COVID-19 screening, we evaluated the feasibility of pooling clinical Nasopharyngeal/Oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swab specimens during nucleic acid extraction without a reduction in sensitivity of qRT-PCR. Pools of 10 specimens were extracted and subsequently tested by qRT-PCR according to the WHO-Charité protocol. We demonstrated that the sample pooling method showed no loss of sensitivity. The effectiveness of the pooled testing strategy was evaluated on both retrospective and prospective samples, and the results showed a similar detection sensitivity compared to testing individual sample alone. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using a pooled testing strategy to increase testing capacity and conserve resources, especially when there is a high demand for disease testing."
https://openalex.org/W3081833922,"A primary virulence-associated trait of the opportunistic fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans is the production of melanin pigments that are deposited into the cell wall and interfere with the host immune response. Previously, our solid-state NMR studies of isolated melanized cell walls (melanin ""ghosts"") revealed that the pigments are strongly associated with lipids, but their identities, origins, and potential roles were undetermined. Herein, we exploited spectral editing techniques to identify and quantify the lipid molecules associated with pigments in melanin ghosts. The lipid profiles were remarkably similar in whole C. neoformans cells, grown under either melanizing or nonmelanizing conditions; triglycerides (TGs), sterol esters (SEs), and polyisoprenoids (PPs) were the major constituents. Although no quantitative differences were found between melanized and nonmelanized cells, melanin ghosts were relatively enriched in SEs and PPs. In contrast to lipid structures reported during early stages of fungal growth in nutrient-rich media, variants found herein could be linked to nutrient stress, cell aging, and subsequent production of substances that promote chronic fungal infections. The fact that TGs and SEs are the typical cargo of lipid droplets suggests that these organelles could be connected to C. neoformans melanin synthesis. Moreover, the discovery of PPs is intriguing because dolichol is a well-established constituent of human neuromelanin. The presence of these lipid species even in nonmelanized cells suggests that they could be produced constitutively under stress conditions in anticipation of melanin synthesis. These findings demonstrate that C. neoformans lipids are more varied compositionally and functionally than previously recognized."
https://openalex.org/W3081008696,"Background In December 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic occurred in Wuhan, China and infection spread rapidly around the world. To limit the rapid spread locally and nationwide, the Chinese government locked down Wuhan city on January 23 and began implementing nationwide intensive community screening on February 16. Method To assess the effectiveness of city lockdown and intensive community screening, we built a modified SIR model by introducing an α value into the classic SIR model. The α value represents the proportion of infected individuals who are not effectively isolated from susceptible individuals at a given time point. Results The accuracy of the modified SIR model was validated using data from Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces. The lockdown of Wuhan city substantially reduced the α value for the rest of China excluding Hubei province, while only slightly reducing the α value for the city itself. Intensive community screening rapidly reduced the α value for Wuhan. Conclusion City lockdown was efficient in controlling the spread of the epidemic from Wuhan to the rest of the country. Nationwide intensive community screening was extremely effective in suppressing the spread locally within Wuhan city. These experiences should urgently be shared with other countries to help halt the progressing worldwide pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3081910947,"Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) is an inner mitochondrial membrane protein complex that links the Krebs cycle to the electron transport system. It can produce significant amounts of superoxide ([Formula: see text]) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2); however, the precise mechanisms are unknown. This fact hinders the development of next-generation antioxidant therapies targeting mitochondria. To help address this problem, we developed a computational model to analyze and identify the kinetic mechanism of [Formula: see text] and H2O2 production by SDH. Our model includes the major redox centers in the complex, namely FAD, three iron-sulfur clusters, and a transiently bound semiquinone. Oxidation state transitions involve a one- or two-electron redox reaction, each being thermodynamically constrained. Model parameters were simultaneously fit to many data sets using a variety of succinate oxidation and free radical production data. In the absence of respiratory chain inhibitors, model analysis revealed the 3Fe-4S iron-sulfur cluster as the primary [Formula: see text] source. However, when the quinone reductase site is inhibited or the quinone pool is highly reduced, [Formula: see text] is generated primarily by the FAD. In addition, H2O2 production is only significant when the enzyme is fully reduced, and fumarate is absent. Our simulations also reveal that the redox state of the quinone pool is the primary determinant of free radical production by SDH. In this study, we showed the importance of analyzing enzyme kinetics and associated side reactions in a consistent, quantitative, and biophysically detailed manner using a diverse set of experimental data to interpret and explain experimental observations from a unified perspective."

However, the perspectives of wheelchair users with spinal cord injury on their fall circumstances and their preferences for fall prevention strategies/interventions remain understudied. Therefore, we aimed to: a) describe the circumstances of falls experienced by wheelchair users with spinal cord injury over a six-month period, b) explore their perspectives of why falls occurred in certain situations, and c) explore their perspectives on recommended content/structure of fall prevention strategies/interventions.This sequential explanatory mixed methods study had two phases. Phase I involved tracking of falls experienced by wheelchair users with spinal cord injury over six months, in which participants completed a survey after experiencing a fall to track the number/circumstance of each fall. Data from the surveys were descriptively reported. Phase II involved a photovoice focus group discussion of the survey findings and their preferences for fall prevention strategies/interventions. Data from the focus group discussion were analyzed using a thematic analysis.Thirty-two participants completed phase I. More than half of the participants fell at least once in six months. Falls commonly occurred in the afternoon during a transfer, or when participants were wheeling over uneven ground. One-third of the falls caused an injury. Eleven participants that fell during phase I participated in the focus group. Two main themes were identified from the discussion: 1) ""circumstances surrounding the falls"" (e.g. when falls occurred, the home is a 'safe space') and 2) ""suggestions and preferences for fall prevention strategies/interventions"" (e.g. fall prevention involves all, fall prevention training available as needed).Fall prevention strategies/interventions should be an integral component of rehabilitation practices across the lifespan. Participants recommend customizing fall prevention strategies/interventions to their specific needs to guide the structure, content, and delivery of targeted fall prevention programs."
https://openalex.org/W3081935472,"Macrophages serve as a first line of defense against infection with the facultative intracellular pathogen, Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn). However, the ability of these innate phagocytic cells to destroy ingested Cn is strongly influenced by polarization state with classically (M1) activated macrophages better able to control cryptococcal infections than alternatively (M2) activated cells. While earlier studies have demonstrated that intracellular Cn minimally affects the expression of M1 and M2 markers, the impact on the broader transcriptome associated with these states remains unclear. To investigate this, an in vitro cell culture model of intracellular infection together with RNA sequencing-based transcriptome profiling was used to measure the impact of Cn infection on gene expression in both polarization states. The gene expression profile of both M1 and M2 cells was extensively altered to become more like naive (M0) macrophages. Gene ontology analysis suggested that this involved changes in the activity of the Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT), p53, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathways. Analyses of the principle polarization markers at the protein-level also revealed discrepancies between the RNA- and protein-level responses. In contrast to earlier studies, intracellular Cn was found to increase protein levels of the M1 marker iNos. In addition, common gene expression changes were identified that occurred post-Cn infection, independent of polarization state. This included upregulation of the transcriptional co-regulator Cited1, which was also apparent at the protein level in M1-polarized macrophages. These changes constitute a transcriptional signature of macrophage Cn infection and provide new insights into how Cn impacts gene expression and the phenotype of host phagocytes."

A grounded theory approach was used throughout the study and a constant comparative method was used in the analysis.Three subcategories were identified from the analysis of interviews with participants: 1) ICT and apps as meaningful and supportive in the rehabilitation process, 2) ICT as a tool in communication and documentation and 3) Barriers to the integration of ICT and apps in the rehabilitation process. From these categories one core category emerged: The potential of a personalized app solution to facilitate coherent person-centred rehabilitation.ICT was perceived as important to integrate in stroke rehabilitation both for assessment, training and to compensate for remaining deficits. The development of a personalized app solution could accommodate stroke survivors' and significant others' need for insight into and overview over the rehabilitation process as well as access to relevant information, which would thereby empower them. Furthermore, a personalized app solution could also facilitate follow-up after discharge and was perceived to ease the communication and documentation within and between sectors, as well as communication with both stroke survivors and significant others."
https://openalex.org/W3081579134,"Objective Increase in alcohol and substance use among college students is a global public health concern. It is associated with the risk of alcohol and substance use disorders to the individual concerned and public health problems to their family and society. Among students there is also the risk of poor academic performance, taking longer to complete their studies or dropping out of university. This study determined the prevalence and patterns of alcohol and substance use of students at the entry to the university. Method A total of 406 (50.7% male) students were interviewed using the Assessment of Smoking and Substance Involvement Test (ASSIST) and the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Tool (AUDIT). Bivariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine associations between substance use and students' socio-demographic characteristics. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the predictors of the lifetime and current alcohol and substance use. Results Lifetime and current alcohol and substance use prevalence were 103 (25%) and 83 (20%) respectively. Currently frequently used substances were alcohol 69 (22%), cannabis 33 (8%) and tobacco 28 (7%). Poly-substance use was reported by 48 (13%) respondents, the main combinations being cannabis, tobacco, and alcohol. Students living in private hostels were four times more likely to be current substance users compared with those living on campus (OR = 4.7, 95% CI: 2.0, 10.9). Conclusion A quarter of the study respondents consumed alcohol and/or substances at the entry to university pushing the case for early intervention strategies to delay initiation of alcohol and substance use and to reduce the associated harmful consequences."

Twenty-four adult dogs were randomly divided into six blocks according to their metabolic body weights (BW0.75); within these groups, dogs were randomized to four treatments: control without prebiotics (CO); inclusion of 0.5% prebiotic blend Yes-Golf (B1); inclusion of 1.0% galactooligosaccharide (GOS); and inclusion of 1.0% prebiotic blend Yes-Golf (B2). The experiment lasted 30 days, with 20 days adaptation and 10 days stool and blood collection. Results were analyzed for normality and means were separated by ANOVA and adjusted by the Tukey test at the significance level of 5.0%. Prebiotic supplementation had no effect on apparent digestibility coefficients (ADC), total stool production and fecal scores (p > 0.05). Prebiotics evaluated also did not alter fecal pH, nor the concentrations of ammonia, lactic acid, short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and most fecal branched chain fatty acids (BCFA) (p > 0.05). The addition of GOS decreased the concentration of iso-valeric acid (p = 0.0423). Regarding immunological variables, concentrations of fecal IgA were not influenced by the treatments. Treatments GOS and B2 increased the total number of polymorphonuclear cells, as well as the oxidative burst in relation to treatments B1 and CO (p < 0.0001). Treatment B2 improved the rate of S. aureus phagocytosis in relation to CO (p = 0.0111), and both the GOS and B2 treatments had a better index for E. coli phagocytosis than the CO treatment (p = 0.0067). In conclusion, there was indication that both prebiotics GOS and B2 at 1.0% inclusion improved the immunity of healthy dogs."
https://openalex.org/W3082829486,"Wind energy offers substantial environmental benefits, but wind facilities can negatively impact wildlife, including birds and bats. Researchers and managers have made major efforts to chronicle bird and bat mortality associated with wind facilities, but few studies have examined the patterns and underlying mechanisms of spatial patterns of fatalities at wind facilities. Understanding the horizontal fall distance between a carcass and the nearest turbine pole is important in designing effective search protocols and estimating total mortality. We explored patterns in taxonomic composition and fall distance of bird and bat carcasses at wind facilities in the Northeastern United States using publicly available data and data submitted to the US Fish and Wildlife Service under scientific collecting and special purpose utility permits for collection and study of migratory birds. Forty-four wind facilities reported 2,039 bird fatalities spanning 128 species and 22 facilities reported 418 bat fatalities spanning five species. Relative to long-distance migratory birds, short-distance migrants were found farther from turbines. Body mass of birds and bats positively influenced fall distance. Turbine size positively influenced fall distance of birds and bats when analyzed collectively and of birds when analyzed separately from bats. This suggests that as turbines increase in size, a greater search radius will be necessary to detect carcasses. Bird and bat fall distance distributions were notably multimodal, but only birds exhibited a high peak near turbine bases, a novel finding we attribute to collisions with turbine poles in addition to blades. This phenomenon varied across bird species, with potential implications for the accuracy of mortality estimates. Although pole collisions for birds is intuitive, this phenomenon has not been formally recognized. This finding may warrant an updated view of turbines as a collision threat to birds because they are a tall structure, and not strictly as a function of their motion."
https://openalex.org/W3081729115,"Freshwater ecosystems play a key role in shaping the global carbon cycle and maintaining the ecological balance that sustains biodiversity worldwide. Surficial water bodies are often interconnected with groundwater, forming a physical continuum, and their interaction has been reported as a crucial driver for organic matter (OM) inputs in groundwater systems. However, despite the growing concerns related to increasing anthropogenic pressure and effects of global change to groundwater environments, our understanding of the dynamics regulating subterranean carbon flows is still sparse. We traced carbon composition and transformations in an arid zone calcrete aquifer using a novel multidisciplinary approach that combined isotopic analyses of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and inorganic carbon (DIC) (δ13CDOC, δ13CDIC, 14CDOC and 14CDIC) with fluorescence spectroscopy (Chromophoric Dissolved OM (CDOM) characterisation) and metabarcoding analyses (taxonomic and functional genomics on bacterial 16S rRNA). To compare dynamics linked to potential aquifer recharge processes, water samples were collected from two boreholes under contrasting rainfall: low rainfall ((LR), dry season) and high rainfall ((HR), wet season). Our isotopic results indicate limited changes and dominance of modern terrestrial carbon in the upper part (northeast) of the bore field, but correlation between HR and increased old and 13C-enriched DOC in the lower area (southwest). CDOM results show a shift from terrestrially to microbially derived compounds after rainfall in the same lower field bore, which was also sampled for microbial genetics. Functional genomic results showed increased genes coding for degradative pathways—dominated by those related to aromatic compound metabolisms—during HR. Our results indicate that rainfall leads to different responses in different parts of the bore field, with an increase in old carbon sources and microbial processing in the lower part of the field. We hypothesise that this may be due to increasing salinity, either due to mobilisation of Cl- from the soil, or infiltration from the downstream salt lake during HR. This study is the first to use a multi-technique assessment using stable and radioactive isotopes together with functional genomics to probe the principal organic biogeochemical pathways regulating an arid zone calcrete system. Further investigations involving extensive sampling from diverse groundwater ecosystems will allow better understanding of the microbiological pathways sustaining the ecological functioning of subterranean biota."
https://openalex.org/W3081917216,"The present study examined the role of exogenous and endogenous attention in task relevant visual perceptual learning (TR-VPL). VPL performance was assessed by examining the learning to a trained stimulus feature and transfer of learning to an untrained stimulus feature. To assess the differential role of attention in VPL, two types of attentional cues were manipulated; exogenous and endogenous. In order to assess the effectiveness of the attentional cue, the two types of attentional cues were further divided into three cue-validity conditions. Participants were trained, on a novel task, to detect the presence of a complex gabor patch embedded in fixed Gaussian contrast noise while contrast thresholds were varied. The results showed initial differences were found prior to training, and so the magnitude of learning was assessed. Exogenous and endogenous attention were both found to facilitate learning and feature transfer when investigating pre-test and post-test thresholds. However, examination of training data indicate attentional differences; with endogenous attention showing consistently lower contrast thresholds as compared to exogenous attention suggesting greater impact of training with endogenous attention. We conclude that several factors, including the use of stimuli that resulted in rapid learning, may have contributed to the generalization of learning found in the present study."
https://openalex.org/W3082061014,"Aluminium salts have been used in vaccines for decades. However, the mechanisms underlying their adjuvant effect are still unclear. Neutrophils, the first immune cells at the injection site, can release cellular DNA together with granular material, so-called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). In mice, NETs apparently play a role in aluminium hydroxide (alum)-adjuvant immune response to vaccines. Although no experimental data exist, this effect is assumed to be operative also in humans. As a first step to verify this knowledge in humans, we demonstrate that the injection of alum particles into human skin biopsies ex vivo leads to similar tissue infiltration of neutrophils and NET-formation. Moreover, we characterized the mechanism leading to alum-induced NET-release in human neutrophils as rapid, NADPH oxidase-independent process involving charge, phagocytosis, phagolysosomal rupture, Ca2+-flux, hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane, and mitochondrial ROS. Extracellular flow and inhibition experiments suggested that no additional energy from oxidative phosphorylation or glycolysis is required for NET-release. This study suggests a so far unappreciated role for neutrophils in the initial phase of immune responses to alum-containing vaccines in humans and provides novel insights into bioenergetic requirements of NET-formation."
https://openalex.org/W3082065203,"Background Drug therapy problems (DTPs) are major concerns of healthcare and have been identified to contribute to negative clinical outcomes. The occurrence of DTPs in heart failure patients is associated with worsening of outcomes. The aim of this study was to assess DTPs, associated factors and patient satisfaction among ambulatory heart failure patients at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital (TASH). Methods A hospital based prospective cross-sectional study was conducted on 423 heart failure patients on follow up at TASH. Data was collected through patient interview and chart review. Descriptive statistics, binary and multiple logistic regressions were used for analyses and P < 0.05 was used to declare association. Results Majority of the patients were in NYHA class III (55.6%) and 66% of them had preserved systolic function. DTPs were identified in 291(68.8%) patients, with an average number of 2.51±1.07.per patient. The most common DTPs were drug interaction (27.3%) followed by noncompliance (26.2%), and ineffective drug use (13.7%). β blockers were the most frequent drug class involved in DTPs followed by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The global satisfaction was 78% and the overall mean score of treatment satisfaction was 60.5% (SD, 10.5). Conclusion Prevalence of DTPs as well as non-adherence among heart failure patients on follow up is relatively high. Detection and prevention of DTPs along with identifying patients at risk can save lives, help to adopt efficient strategies to closely monitor patients at risk, enhance patient’s quality of life and optimize healthcare costs."

The correlation between each indicator and the degree of neurologic deficit was assessed. Kaplan-Meier survival curves based on blood cell ratios were used to analyze the 90-day survival rate of patients with AIS.A total of 663 patients with AIS were enrolled, of which 24 (3.6%) experienced recurrence and 13 (2.0%) died.

https://openalex.org/W3082912162,"We report on aerobic “environmental” bacteria isolated from European honey bees (Apis mellifera). We determined the number of culturable aerobic bacteria in the gut of nurse bees sampled from locations around Australia. Bees from healthy colonies had 107–108 aerobic bacteria per g of bee gut, while bees from colonies with chalkbrood consistently had significantly fewer bacteria (104–105 bacteria per g). When colonies recovered from chalkbrood, bacterial numbers returned to normal levels, suggesting that counting aerobic bacteria in the gut could be used to predict an outbreak of the disease. Furthermore, Western Australian bees from the “Better Bees” program (bred to promote hygienic behaviour) had significantly higher numbers of aerobic gut bacteria compared to regular bees from healthy colonies. Bacteria with the ability to inhibit the chalkbrood pathogen were found in most bees from regular colonies (> 60%) but only in a few “Better Bees” (10%). Phylogenetic analysis of aerobic bacterial isolates that inhibited the chalkbrood pathogen revealed a close relationship (>97% sequence identity) to the genera Bacillus, Klebsiella, Pantoea, Hafnia, and Enterobacter (bacteria that have previously been isolated from honey bees), but we also isolated Maccrococcus and Frigoribacterium species (bacteria that were not previously identified in bees). Finally, we investigated the ability of bacteria to inhibit the chalkbrood fungus Ascosphaera apis. Mass spectroscopy analysis revealed that the bee gut isolates Frigoribacterium sp. and Bacillus senegalensis produce gluconic acid.

https://openalex.org/W3080349800,"SARS-CoV-2 is still rampaging throughout the world while the many evolutionary studies on it are simultaneously springing up. Researchers have simply utilized the public RNA-seq data to find out the so-called SNPs in the virus genome. The evolutionary analyses were largely based on these mutations. Here, we claim that we reliably detected A-to-G RNA modifications in the RNA-seq data of SARS-CoV-2 with high signal to noise ratios, presumably caused by the host’s deamination enzymes. Intriguingly, since SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, it is technically impossible to distinguish SNPs and RNA modifications from the RNA-seq data alone without solid evidence, making it difficult to tell the evolutionary patterns behind the mutation spectrum. Researchers should clarify their biological significance before they automatically regard the mutations as SNPs or RNA modifications. This is not a problem for DNA organisms but should be seriously considered when we are investigating the RNA viruses."

Future changes to these physical Earth system attributes and their effects on agricultural crop yields are highly uncertain. United States agricultural producers will be affected by such changes whether they occur domestically or internationally through international commodity markets. Here we present a replication study of previous investigations (with different models) showing that potential direct domestic climate effects on crop yields in the U.S. have financial consequences for U.S. producers on the same order of magnitude but opposite in sign to indirect financial impacts on U.S. producers from climate effects on crop yields elsewhere in the world. We conclude that the analysis of country-specific financial climate impacts cannot ignore indirect effects arising through international markets. We find our results to be robust across a wide range of potential future crop yield impacts analyzed in the multi-sector dynamic global model GCAM."
https://openalex.org/W3082908677,"Nurses are managing huge number of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which made them highly vulnerable to HIV infection through occupational exposure such as needle stick injuries and splashing of blood/bodily fluids on mucosal surface. This made the practice of post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for HIV crucial among nurses. Therefore, our study aimed to assess knowledge, attitude and practice of PEP for HIV among nurses in Bhutan. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 221 registered nurses working at Jigme Dorji Wangchuck National Referral Hospital, Bhutan between April and June 2017. A structured self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data and analysed using SPSS version 21. Majority (80.1%) of our participants had poor knowledge regarding PEP for HIV. Although half (51.1%) of our participants had heard about PEP, only 3 (1.4%) attended a formal training on PEP for HIV. However, a significant proportion of nurses (92.3%) had positive attitude towards PEP for HIV. Out of 221 respondents, 95(43%) had been exposed to needle stick injuries and splashing of blood/bodily fluids while managing patients. Despite significant number of exposures, only 2 (2.1%) of them took PEP and completed 28 days of prophylaxis. Lack of protective barriers at work place (56.8%) and poor knowledge on personal protective equipment (14.7%) were major perceived causes of exposure among study participants. No PEP service (30.2%) and lack of support to report incidents (22.6%) were two major reasons leading to failure of PEP practice among exposed individuals. Despite positive attitude exhibited by majority of our respondents, the level of knowledge and practice of PEP for HIV among nurses was very low. Therefore, a formal training on PEP and 24 hours accessible PEP service with proper guidelines are recommended to improve the overall knowledge and practice of PEP against HIV among nurses."
https://openalex.org/W3081730778,"The ciliated protozoan Cryptocaryon irritans infects a wide range of marine fish and causes the highly lethal white spot disease. This parasite possesses three morphologically and physiologically distinct life stages: an infectious theront, a parasitic trophont, and an asexually reproductive tomont. In the past few years, several attempts have been made to help elucidate how C. irritans transforms from one stage to another using transcriptomic or proteomic approaches. However, there has been no research studying changes in transcription profiles between different time points of a single C. irritans life stage-the development of this parasite. Here we use RNA-seq and compare gene expression profiles of theront cells collected by 1 and 10 hrs after they emerged from tomonts. It has been shown that infectivity of theront cells declines 6-8 hours post-emergence, and we used this characteristic as a physiological marker to confirm the aging of theront cells. We identified a total of 41 upregulated and 90 downregulated genes that were differentially expressed between young and aging theront cells. Using Blast2Go to further analyze functions of these genes, we show that genes related to energy production are downregulated, but quite surprisingly many genes involved in transcription/translation processes are upregulated. We also show that expression of all nine detectable agglutination/immobilization antigen genes, with great sequence divergence, is invariably downregulated. Functions of other differentially expressed genes and indications are also discussed in our study."

With the development of carbon market, carbon asset has been a popular financial product to invest and the risk management becomes important for government, regulated enterprises and other investors. As carbon prices have tail characteristics, this paper explores the extremal risks between carbon markets in US, Europe and China using tail dependence correlation coefficients. The empirical analysis demonstrates the tail dependence structure between carbon markets in US. and Europe is the same sign, which indicates that it is unwise to hold these two carbon assets as a portfolio. Moreover, the co-movements between European Union Emission Trade Scheme (EU ETS) and China's carbon markets are partly significant, and the operation mechanisms in China should be improved. In addition, the tail dependence test among the carbon pilots in China shows diversity. Hubei carbon trading pilot, located in central China, has extremal dependence with all other selected pilots for its regulatory program operation. The findings give insight to the carbon market regulars to improve the operation mechanism and are also useful for the investors to manage their portfolios, policymakers to make practically applicable regulations, and relevant organizations to develop procedures."
https://openalex.org/W3081603671,"Aims Non-Coeliac Gluten Sensitivity (NCGS) is poorly understood, particularly in terms of its neurological outcomes. We initially conducted a prospective postal survey to investigate its neurological presentation and symptom course. Results from this then motivated a follow-up pilot study utilising brain MRI to characterise potential diagnostic biomarkers for future research. Methods Patients with NCGS were recruited from a specialist centre and completed a prospective postal questionnaire (N = 125). This summarised symptoms experienced, their severity and their course. Onset time was compared by Chi-squared analysis to data from the same centre concerning coeliac disease patients (N = 224). Five respondents on a strict gluten-free diet who self-reported brain fog then attended a pilot study, completing MR brain imaging/questionnaires before/after a gluten challenge. “Baseline” data were assessed for abnormalities, while symptom severity and cerebral blood flow (CBF) were compared before/after challenge. Results Survey participants were aged 47 (85% female). Prevalence of neurological symptoms were: headaches (51%), brain fog (48%), balance issues (31%), tingling (19%). Median symptom resolution time was 48 hours, while onset was 90 minutes; onset pattern was not significantly different compared to CD patients (p = 0.322). Extra-intestinal symptoms worsened by 37%(±28) during a typical reaction. Predominantly non-statistical observations from the brain imaging study are discussed. Conclusions Neurological symptoms in NCGS are common, and onset time is comparable to that in CD. Brain imaging may be a useful future means of investigating physiological injury and responses to gluten in further study."
https://openalex.org/W3082071666,"Purpose Phyllodes tumors (PTs) are biphasic tumors accounting for 0.3–1.5% of all breast tumors. Epithelial membrane proteins (EMPs) have been reported in various malignant tumors but their expression in PTs is unclear. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the expression of EMP1, EMP2, and EMP3 in breast phyllodes tumors (PTs), and to investigate their clinical implications. Methods In total, 185 PTs were used for constructing a tissue microarray. Immunohistochemical staining for EMP1, EMP2, and EMP3 was performed, and the results were analyzed along with the clinicopathologic parameters. Results In total, 185 PTs were included in this study, and comprised 138 benign, 32 borderline, and 15 malignant PTs. In malignant PTs, the epithelial component showed decreased expression of EMP1 (P = 0.027), EMP2 (P = 0.004), and EMP3 (P = 0.032), compared to the benign and borderline PTs. Conversely, stromal component of borderline and malignant PTs showed higher expression of EMP1 (P = 0.027), EMP2 (P = 0.004), and EMP3 (P = 0.032) compared to benign PTs. Expression of EMP1 and EMP3 correlated positively with stromal cellularity and cellular atypia (P < 0.001). In the univariate analysis, stromal EMP3 was associated with shorter disease-free survival (P < 0.001), and shorter overall survival (P = 0.034). Conclusion The expression of EMP1, EMP2, and EMP3 is decreased in the epithelial component and is increased in the stromal component of PT with higher histologic grade. Thus, stromal EMP3 expression may serve as an independent prognostic factor in PT."
https://openalex.org/W3082356970,"Background Globally, tobacco consumption continues to cause a huge burden of preventable diseases. Chile has been leading the tobacco burden ranking in the Latin American region for the last ten years; it has currently a 33. 3% prevalence of current smokers. Methods A microsimulation economic model was developed within the framework of a multi-country project in order to estimate the burden attributable to smoking in terms of morbidity, mortality, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and direct costs of care. We also modelled the impact of increasing cigarettes’ taxes on this burden. Results In Chile, 16,472 deaths were attributable to smoking in 2017, which represent around 16% of all deaths. This burden corresponds to 416,445 DALYs per year. The country’s health system spends 1.15 trillion pesos annually (in Dec 2017 CLP, approx. U$D 1.8 billion) in health care treatment of illnesses caused by smoking. If the price of tobacco cigarettes was to be raised by 50%, around 13,665 deaths and 360,476 DALYs from smoking-attributable diseases would be averted in 10 years, with subsequent savings on health care costs, and increased tax revenue collection. In Chile, the tobacco tax collection does not fully cover the direct healthcare costs attributed to smoking. Conclusion Despite a reduction observed on smoking prevalence between 2010 (40.6%) and 2017 (33.3%), this study shows that the burden of disease, and the economic toll due to smoking, remain high. As we demonstrate, a rise in the price of cigarettes could lead to a significant reduction of this burden, averting deaths and disability, and reducing healthcare spending."

The biological significance of this step is evident from bleeding arising from deficiencies in factors VIIIa or IXa in hemophilia. Here, we assess the mechanism(s) that enforce the distinctive specificity of intrinsic Xase for its biological substrate. Active-site function of IXa was assessed with a tripeptidyl substrate (PF-3688). The reversible S1 site binder, 4-aminobenzamidine (pAB), acted as a classical competitive inhibitor of PF-3688 cleavage by Xase. In contrast, pAB acted as a noncompetitive inhibitor of factor X activation. This disconnect between peptidyl substrate and protein substrate cleavage indicates a major role for interactions between factor X and extended sites on Xase in determining substrate affinity. Accordingly, an uncleavable factor X variant, not predicted to engage the active site of IXa within Xase, acted as a classical competitive inhibitor of factor X activation. Fluorescence studies confirmed the binding of factor X to Xase assembled with IXa with a covalently blocked active site. Our findings suggest that the recognition of factor X by the intrinsic Xase complex occurs through a multistep “dock-and-lock” pathway in which the initial interaction between factor X and intrinsic Xase occurs at exosites distant from the active site, followed by active-site docking and bond cleavage.

The serine proteinases of blood coagulation contain catalytic domains that are structurally similar and resemble trypsin, an ancestral member of the S1 peptidase family of which chymotrypsin is the archetype (1Barrett A.J.

Despite such homology, the trypsin-like proteinases of coagulation exhibit high specificity for their biological substrate(s) (4Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Cofactor proteins in the assembly and expression of blood clotting enzyme complexes.Annu. Rev.

Narrow and distinctive specificity in this family of related proteinases was initially attributed to the recognition of sequences flanking cleavage sites in the cognate substrate akin to the preferential hydrolysis of one peptidyl substrate over the other by any one proteinase (6Perona J.J. Craik C.S. Evolutionary divergence of substrate specificity within the chymotrypsin-like serine protease fold.J. Biol.

However, these active site–centric ideas have gradually ceded to the burgeoning evidence that protein substrate affinity for several of the coagulation enzymes is determined by extended interactions between substrate sites removed from the cleavage site(s) and sites (exosites) on the enzyme or enzyme-cofactor complex distinct from the active site (7Krishnaswamy S. Exosite-driven substrate specificity and function in coagulation.J. Thromb. Hemost. 2005; 3 (15634266): 54-6710.1111/j.1538-7836.2004.01021.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 8Bock P.E.

In these cases, the initial exosite-binding interaction not only drives affinity but also enforces specificity by both restricting and facilitating active-site engagement by the substrate followed by cleavage (7Krishnaswamy S. Exosite-driven substrate specificity and function in coagulation.J. Thromb. Hemost. 2005; 3 (15634266): 54-6710.1111/j.1538-7836.2004.01021.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Such a multistep pathway for substrate recognition is associated with signature disconnects between the kinetics of inhibition of active-site function relative to protein substrate cleavage (9Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Exosites determine macromolecular substrate recognition by prothrombinase.Biochemistry. 1997; 36 (9315846): 12080-1208610.1021/bi970979+Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 10Blat Y.

The activating cleavage of zymogen factor X to the proteinase, Xa, is key for both the initiation of coagulation and the subsequent amplification of flux through the coagulation cascade (11Smith S.A. Travers R.J. Morrissey J.H. How it all starts: initiation of the clotting cascade.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

The latter is achieved by the intrinsic Xase complex, which assembles through reversible interactions between the proteinase IXa, its cofactor VIIIa, and membranes exposing negatively charged phospholipids (4Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Cofactor proteins in the assembly and expression of blood clotting enzyme complexes.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57 (3052293): 915-95610.1146/annurev.bi.57.070188.004411Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). In a manner analogous to the other enzyme complexes of coagulation, the assembly of IXa into intrinsic Xase profoundly increases, by several orders of magnitude, its ability to cleave factor X (13van Dieijen G. Tans G. Rosing J. Hemker H.C. The role of phospholipid and factor VIIIa in the activation of bovine factor X.J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256 (6782101): 3433-3442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These properties of intrinsic Xase explain bleeding in hemophilia A or B associated with defects or deficiencies in either factor VIII or factor IX (14Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. The coagulation cascade: initiation, maintenance, and regulation.Biochemistry. 1991; 30 (1931959): 10363-1037010.1021/bi00107a001Crossref PubMed Scopus (1577) Google Scholar). The prothrombinase complex of coagulation is the closest structural analog of the intrinsic Xase (4Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Cofactor proteins in the assembly and expression of blood clotting enzyme complexes.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57 (3052293): 915-95610.1146/annurev.bi.57.070188.004411Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The most comprehensive evidence for exosite-dependent substrate recognition and its ramifications for multiple aspects of function has been established in numerous studies of prothrombin activation by prothrombinase (7Krishnaswamy S. Exosite-driven substrate specificity and function in coagulation.J. Thromb. Hemost. 2005; 3 (15634266): 54-6710.1111/j.1538-7836.2004.01021.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 15Krishnaswamy S. The transition of prothrombin to thrombin.J. Thromb. Hemost. 2013; 11 (23809130): 265-27610.1111/jth.12217Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Given the similarities between intrinsic Xase and prothrombinase, it follows that some variation on analogous strategies is likely to apply to factor X activation by this enzyme complex as well. However, despite widespread interest in the basic and clinical science of the function of intrinsic Xase, details of the molecular basis for its substrate specificity remain incomplete. This partly reflects the limitations in the ability to compare active-site function of IXa within intrinsic Xase with factor X activation by the enzyme complex. Factor IXa is a notoriously poor enzyme for the cleavage of peptidyl substrates and typically requires the use of very high concentrations of alcohols for measurable rates of peptide hydrolysis (16Stürzebecher J. Kopetzki E. Bode W. Hopfner K.P. Dramatic enhancement of the catalytic activity of coagulation factor IXa by alcohols.FEBS Lett. 1997; 412 (9256238): 295-30010.1016/S0014-5793(97)00811-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 17Neuenschwander P.F.

This requirement limits interpretable kinetic studies comparing peptidyl substrate hydrolysis with factor X activation by intrinsic Xase to infer a role for exosite binding in protein substrate recognition by the enzyme complex. Kinetic limitations aside, there is some evidence implicating a role for exosite binding in the recognition of factor X by intrinsic Xase. Fluorescence studies using intrinsic Xase assembled with IXa in which the active site has been occluded have provided evidence for factor X binding to the enzyme complex with affinity in line with the measured Km (18Lollar P. Parker E.T. Curtis J.E. Helgerson S.L. Hoyer L.W. Scott M.E. Scandella D. Inhibition of human factor VIIIa by anti-A2 subunit antibodies.J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93 (8200986): 2497-250410.1172/JCI117259Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This binding could be prevented by an inhibitory antibody targeting the A2 domain of VIIIa (18Lollar P. Parker E.T. Curtis J.E. Helgerson S.L. Hoyer L.W. Scott M.E. Scandella D. Inhibition of human factor VIIIa by anti-A2 subunit antibodies.J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93 (8200986): 2497-250410.1172/JCI117259Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The potential problem with these findings is that such implied exosite interactions could not be directly related to the productive pathway of factor X recognition by the intrinsic Xase. There is also evidence for the inhibition of X activation by intrinsic Xase by an aptamer targeting a surface of the substrate distant from the cleavage site (19Buddai S.K. Layzer J.M. Lu G. Rusconi C.P. Sullenger B.A. Monroe D.M. Krishnaswamy S. An anticoagulant RNA aptamer that inhibits proteinase-cofactor interactions within prothrombinase.J. Biol.

Whereas the data suggest that these substrate regions may be important in its binding to the enzyme complex, alternate kinetic interpretations have not been ruled out (19Buddai S.K. Layzer J.M. Lu G. Rusconi C.P. Sullenger B.A. Monroe D.M. Krishnaswamy S. An anticoagulant RNA aptamer that inhibits proteinase-cofactor interactions within prothrombinase.J. Biol.

We have now exploited the finding that a fluorogenic peptidyl substrate, H-d-leucyl-phenyl-glycyl-arginine-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (PF-3688), yields an experimentally accessible Km for IXa and intrinsic Xase in the absence of added alcohols. This has allowed interpretable kinetic studies to search for one aspect of the kinetic signature of exosite-dependent recognition of the protein substrate. Our kinetic strategy, combined with binding studies, now implicates an exosite-dependent dock-and-lock strategy for the recognition and cleavage of factor X by the intrinsic Xase. Factor IXa exhibits very weak amidolytic activity toward synthetic peptidyl substrates. Although measurable rates of peptidyl substrate cleavage have required the addition of high concentrations of ethylene glycol or other alcohols, the Km for most substrates remains indeterminate and limited by peptide solubility (16Stürzebecher J. Kopetzki E. Bode W. Hopfner K.P. Dramatic enhancement of the catalytic activity of coagulation factor IXa by alcohols.FEBS Lett. 1997; 412 (9256238): 295-30010.1016/S0014-5793(97)00811-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 17Neuenschwander P.F.

The potential detrimental effect of alcohols on the assembly and stability of intrinsic Xase coupled with the high Km presents hurdles in the analysis of the active function of IXa within the enzyme complex. Initial velocity measurements with PF-3688 revealed reasonable rates in the absence of added alcohols and yielded experimentally accessible Km values for IXa alone and IXa assembled within intrinsic Xase (Table 1). As has also been reported for the analogous prothrombinase complex, incorporation of IXa into the intrinsic Xase complex yielded a modest decrease in the rate and catalytic efficiency of peptidyl substrate cleavage. Given that the rate of cleavage of the cognate protein substrate is vastly increased following the assembly of prothrombinase or intrinsic Xase, the findings illustrate, once again, an obvious disconnect between the constraints affecting the kinetic constants for protein substrate cleavage relative to active-site function.Table 1Kinetics of peptidyl substrate cleavageEnzymeaStudies done with 75 nm IXa or with 75 nm IXa, 90 nm VIIIa, and 100 μm PCPS.InhibitorInhibition typeVmaxbKinetic constants are reported ± 95% confidence limits.KmKiΔF/minµmµmIXaNoneNAcNA, not applicable.0.212 ± 0.006267 ± 16NAIXaNoneNA0.205 ± 0.008213 ± 17NAIXapABCompetitive0.199 ± 0.008200 ± 1739 ± 2.2IXa-VIIIa-PCPSNoneNA0.369 ± 0.039762 ± 111NAIXa-VIIIa-PCPSNoneNA0.321 ± 0.031652 ± 92NAIXa-VIIIa-PCPSpABCompetitive0.343 ± 0.028687 ± 79111 ± 5IXa-VIIIa-PCPSpABCompetitive0.325 ± 0.021669 ± 63117 ± 5a Studies done with 75 nm IXa or with 75 nm IXa, 90 nm VIIIa, and 100 μm PCPS.b Kinetic constants are reported ± 95% confidence limits.c NA, not applicable.

As has been illustrated with several other coagulation proteinases, pAB is expected to act as a competitive inhibitor for substrates that interact in a limited way with the active site (21Evans S.A. Olson S.T. Shore J.D. Aminobenzamidine as a fluorescent probe for the active site of serine proteases.J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257 (7037776): 3014-3017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initial velocity studies of PF-3688 cleavage by IXa alone (Fig. 1A) or in complex with VIIIa and PCPS (Fig. 1B) in the presence of different fixed concentrations of pAB yielded results consistent with classical competitive inhibition. The fitted kinetic constants illustrate that both the Km for PF-3688 and Ki for pAB are modestly increased by a factor of 2–3 when IXa is assembled in the intrinsic Xase (Table 1). The kinetic signature of classical competitive inhibition is that increasing concentrations of inhibitor increase Km without affecting Vmax because inhibition at any one inhibitor concentration can be completely overcome by saturating with substrate. This result implies that pAB and PF-3688 bind in a mutually exclusive way to the active site of IXa in solution or assembled into intrinsic Xase. In contrast to the findings with the peptidyl substrate, initial velocity studies of factor X activation revealed a different inhibition profile by pAB (Fig. 2). Increasing concentrations of pAB markedly decrease Vmax without obviously increasing the Km for factor X. These data imply that pAB binding is not mutually exclusive with factor X binding to intrinsic Xase. Analysis distinguishing between different reversible inhibition types yielded best fits with the model for noncompetitive inhibition (Table 2). When taken with the kinetic pathway for noncompetitive inhibition, the findings illustrate that pAB and factor X can simultaneously bind to the enzyme (Scheme 1). It follows that the affinity of factor X for intrinsic Xase is substantially determined by interactions at sites distinct from the proteinase active site. Indeed, the fitted constants indicate that protein substrate affinity is modestly enhanced by bound pAB and pAB affinity is proportionately enhanced by bound factor X (i.e. α < 1, Scheme 1). Because active-site engagement by the substrate is required for catalysis, such a binding step to form E·S* must follow the initial formation of E·S before factor X can be cleaved to yield product (Scheme 1). Inhibition by pAB arises from a decreased Vmax because some fraction of the enzyme is tied up as E·S·I in the presence of inhibitor regardless of substrate concentration. This redistribution decreases the fraction of the E·S* species and thereby the rate of product formation even at saturating concentrations of substrate. This simple kinetic approach suggests a multistep dock-and-lock pathway for factor X recognition and cleavage by intrinsic Xase. Substrate affinity is enforced by an initial interaction between factor X and the enzyme complex at exosites, removed from the active site, followed by active-site engagement and cleavage. The second binding step affects Vmax and the perceived rate constant for catalysis. These points are evident from the rate expression for the two-step mechanism illustratively derived using the rapid equilibrium expression, v=S·E·kcat1+Ks*S + KEXOKs*1+Ks*(Eq. 1) where kcatobs=VE=kcat 1 + Ks*(Eq. 2) Ksobs=KEXO·Ks*1 + Ks*(Eq. 3) Table 2Inhibition of factor X activation by intrinsic Xase by active site–directed ligandInhibition typeaOther forms of reversible inhibition were eliminated by analysis according to alternate rate expressions as described “under Data Analysis”.V/EbKinetic constants are reported ± 95% confidence limits.KmKiαcMultiplier for Km at saturating pAB and for Ki at saturating factor X.s−1nmµmNoncompetitive2.07 ± 0.0439.4 ± 2.6163 ± 110.52 ± 0.09Noncompetitive1.95 ± 0.0440.2 ± 2.4131 ± 80.37 ± 0.07Noncompetitive2.12 ± 0.0448.1 ± 3.2161 ± 90.34 ± 0.08a Other forms of reversible inhibition were eliminated by analysis according to alternate rate expressions as described “under Data Analysis”.b Kinetic constants are reported ± 95% confidence limits.c Multiplier for Km at saturating pAB and for Ki at saturating factor X.

The scheme illustrates the conversion of substrate (S) to product (P) by the membrane-bound intrinsic Xase complex (E) in the presence of an active site–directed reversible inhibitor (I). KEXO denotes the equilibrium dissociation constant for the exosite-dependent interaction between S and E.

We assessed this possibility by using factor X variants, XS195A and XR15Q, that are expected to retain the ability to engage the intrinsic Xase complex in this way regardless of whether they can engage the active site. Mutation of the catalytic Ser195 to Ala in XS195A yields an alternate substrate but one that does not yield an active product in the initial velocity measurements of Xa formation. The variant XR15Q contains a Gln substitution at the P1 Arg and is expected to be uncleavable because it cannot engage the active site. Initial velocity studies of factor X activation by intrinsic Xase in the presence of different fixed concentrations of XS195A (Fig. 3A) or XR15Q (Fig. 3B) indicated that both variants acted as classical competitive inhibitors of factor X activation. Fitted kinetic constants indicated that competitive inhibition by these variants was achieved with Ki values comparable with the Km for factor X (Table 3). Thus, in accordance with Scheme 1, competitive inhibition of factor X activation requires interference with exosite binding, and this can be accomplished even by the XR15Q variant that is not expected to effectively engage the active site of IXa within intrinsic Xase.Table 3Inhibition of factor X activation by intrinsic Xase by factor X variantsInhibitorInhibition typeaOther forms of reversible inhibition were eliminated by analysis according to alternate rate expressions as described “under Data Analysis”.V/EbKinetic constants are reported ± 95% confidence limits.KmKis−1nmnmXS195ACompetitive1.95 ± 0.0460.4 ± 3.8118 ± 7XS195ACompetitive2.98 ± 0.0696.3 ± 5.2347 ± 20XR15QCompetitive2.18 ± 0.0460.4 ± 338.1 ± 1.6XR15QCompetitive2.80 ± 0.05109.4 ± 5.2114.9 ± 4.4a Other forms of reversible inhibition were eliminated by analysis according to alternate rate expressions as described “under Data Analysis”.b Kinetic constants are reported ± 95% confidence limits. Open table in a new tab We verified the expected properties of XR15Q by examining its potential cleavage following prolonged incubation with a high concentration of intrinsic Xase followed by analysis using SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4). Whereas factor X from plasma was readily cleaved to Xa under these conditions, XR15Q yielded no evidence of Xa formation (Fig. 4). This verifies the inability of the Gln substitution at the P1 residue to allow for adequate active-site engagement and cleavage. We also pursued the corollary approach of examining the ability of these substrate variants to displace pAB from the active site of the intrinsic Xase assembled using IXaS195A. However, fluorescence binding measurements revealed a very weak binding constant for pAB to IXaS195A in solution or assembled within intrinsic Xase, which rendered this approach impractical. Binding measurements were pursued to independently corroborate active site–independent interactions between factor X and intrinsic Xase. We employed a IXa derivative in which the active site was covalently occluded with a fluorescein derivative of a peptidyl chloromethyl ketone. The objective was to use the tethered fluorescent group as a reporter of interactions in the absence of catalysis and with a peptide irreversibly occluding the active site. Studies were pursued with IXa inactivated with a thioester derivative of Phe-Phe-Arg-chloromethyl ketone, which was then modified with fluorescein 5-maleimide to yield fluorescein-5-maleimide (F5M)-FFR-IXa (F-IXai). This derivative has previously proven useful to report interactions within intrinsic Xase (18Lollar P. Parker E.T. Curtis J.E. Helgerson S.L. Hoyer L.W. Scott M.E. Scandella D. Inhibition of human factor VIIIa by anti-A2 subunit antibodies.J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93 (8200986): 2497-250410.1172/JCI117259Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Incremental additions of thrombin cleaved VIII to a reaction mixture containing 50 nm F-IXai, and saturating PCPS produced a large and saturable increase in anisotropy (Δr ∼ 0.07) with fitted constants consistent with a tight interaction between F-IXai and VIIIa on the membrane surface (Fig. 5A). In a second series of studies, intrinsic Xase preformed with 50 nm F-IXai, 100 nm VIIIa, and saturating membranes was titrated with either XS195A or XR15Q (Fig. 5B). Equivalent saturable titration curves were obtained with either variant with a further increase in anisotropy (Δr ∼ 0.04). Combined analysis assuming 1 mol of factor X variant bound/mol of Xase revealed that either variant bound to the enzyme complex with an equilibrium dissociation constant of ∼15 nm. These findings illustrate that factor X can bind with high affinity to intrinsic Xase in a way that is independent of the active site of IXa or the complementary structures flanking the scissile bond in the substrate. The somewhat higher affinity obtained in these binding measurements relative to the affinity for the same variants inferred from the competitive inhibition studies may reflect the modest linkage observed between exosite binding and liganding at the active site within the enzyme complex. The evidence presented in this study parallels the findings with extrinsic Xase (VIIa/tissue factor) and the more comprehensive studies with prothrombinase to illustrate that exosite-dependent protein substrate recognition is a prevalent strategy by which the enzyme complexes of coagulation recognize their cognate substrates (7Krishnaswamy S. Exosite-driven substrate specificity and function in coagulation.J. Thromb. Hemost. 2005; 3 (15634266): 54-6710.1111/j.1538-7836.2004.01021.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 8Bock P.E.

Yet, there is little evidence that has assessed social networks of providers within HIV care networks. The purpose of this study is to provide a cross-sectional analysis of the role medical case managers (MCM), housing providers (HP), and health department staff (HDS), play in a Ryan White-funded area.All MCMs, HPs, and HDS (N = 57) in a Midwest Transitional Grant Area were invited to participate in a social network survey. Social network composition scores, exponential random graph modeling and ANOVA tests were conducted using SPSS and R Studio.Communication in this network was significantly more likely between SW of the same provider type (e.g. MCMs communicating with other MCMs, β = .87, p<.001). HDS reported larger overall social networks (F(2,54) = 4.59, p = <.01), larger networks with other provider types (F(2,54) = 9.23, p<.001), and higher quality of relationships with other provider types (F(2,54) = 3.90, p<.05) than MCM or HP. HDS were more likely to communicate across the system than MCMs or HPs (β = .75, p<.001).HDS play an important role in communicating across provider types in care delivery for HIV. Our results indicate that health departments represent essential agencies for broad dissemination of resources and knowledge, and may bridge communication barriers for coordination of housing support and HIV care delivery."
https://openalex.org/W3081574241,"This study delineates the relative importance of organisational, research discipline and application domain factors in influencing researchers’ data sharing practices in Australia’s national scientific and industrial research agency. We surveyed 354 researchers and found that the number of data deposits made by researchers were related to the openness of the data culture and the contractual inhibitors experienced by researchers. Multi-level modelling revealed that organisational unit membership explained 10%, disciplinary membership explained 6%, and domain membership explained 4% of the variance in researchers’ intentions to share research data. However, only the organisational measure of openness to data sharing explained significant unique variance in data sharing. Thus, whereas previous research has tended to focus on disciplinary influences on data sharing, this study suggests that factors operating within the organisation have the most powerful influence on researchers’ data sharing practices. The research received approval from the organisation’s Human Research Ethics Committee (no. 014/18)."

Overall, 48 90-day-old lambs with an initial weight of 19.04 ± 0.96 kg were observed. Moreover, a randomised block factorial design with four cultivars of Brachiaria brizantha (Marandu, Xaraés, Piatã and Paiaguás grasses) under intermittent stocking (with a pre-grazing canopy height of 40 cm and post-grazing canopy height of 20 cm) for two grazing cycles was used. The following variables were analysed: faecal egg counting, faecal culture, mean corpuscular volume, FAMACHA© score, weight and body condition score, the recovery of larvae from pasture and soil samples, nutritional value and the production and structural components of forage. Lambs grazing Marandu grass demonstrated the highest level of nematode infection (P < 0.05). However, the nutritional value did not differ between cultivars. Marandu grass had the highest pasture density (P < 0.05), while Paiaguás grass had the highest percentage of dead material (P < 0.05). The various genera of gastrointestinal nematodes found in the faecal cultures, regardless of the cultivars, include Haemonchus (92.01%), Trichostrongylus (4.55%), Strongyloides (3.06%) and Oesophagostomum (0.37%). Lambs grazing Xaraés grass had the lowest body weight (P < 0.05). Furthermore, larvae concentrations were highest in Marandu and Paiaguás pastures; infective Haemonchus and Trichostrongylus larvae were recovered from pasture and soil samples. The different cultivars of Brachiaria brizantha produce diverse and relevant microclimatic conditions to contaminate soil, pastures and animals. Animal performance was not compromised despite the Marandu and Paiaguás cultivars having the highest levels of contamination and infection. Based on parasitological aspects, the Brachiaria brizantha cultivars Xaraés and Piatã are recommended for grass-based sheep production systems over the other cultivars since they contribute to the reduction of larval contamination and infection."

The cellular uptake of monosaccharides, polyols, and other small carbon compounds across the membranes of eukaryotic cells is an essential physiological process.

Commun. 2014; 5 (25088546): 452110.1038/ncomms5521Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For both GlcPSe and XylE, a transport mechanism is discussed where the transition between the inward-facing and outward-facing conformations involves a 24° relative rotation of the N- and C-domains around an axis that passes through the substrate-binding site, suggesting that translocation of glucose is coupled with conformational changes associated with the transition between the outward- and inward-facing conformations. The involvement of Asp22 in the H+-binding site was shown by the loss of a pH effect on entrance counterflow in proteoliposomes and of active glucose transport in right-side-out vesicles (8Iancu C.V. Zamoon J. Woo S.B. Aleshin A. Choe J.Y. Crystal structure of a glucose/H+ symporter and its mechanism of action.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

It was proposed that, in the absence of a proton, Asp22 and Arg102 form a salt bridge to juxtapose helices 1 and 4, thereby opening the substrate cavity wide. When the proton binds to Asp22, the salt bridge breaks, and helices 1 and 4 rearrange to decrease the size of the substrate cavity; this then lowers the energetic barrier of the transporter's conformations, and the glucose is transported (8Iancu C.V. Zamoon J. Woo S.B. Aleshin A. Choe J.Y. Crystal structure of a glucose/H+ symporter and its mechanism of action.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

This proposal has been supported by structural studies and molecular dynamics simulations of XylE (11Sun L. Zeng X. Yan C. Sun X. Gong X. Rao Y. Yan N.

A loose relationship: incomplete H+/sugar coupling in the MFS sugar transporter GlcP.Biophys.

It has been proposed that the existence of an H+-binding site is necessary but not a sufficient requirement for H+/sugar symport (21Bazzone A. Zabadne A.J. Salisowski A. Madej M.G. Fendler K. A loose relationship: incomplete H+/sugar coupling in the MFS sugar transporter GlcP.Biophys.

Here we study the pH- and substrate-dependent conformational changes in purified GlcPSe by IR spectroscopy for WT and several H+-binding site mutants, including A167E. This mutation is at a position proposed to play the role of the additional structure element crucial for strict symport. The suggestion is based on the analogy with the residue at position 206 in XylEEc (22Bazzone A. Madej M.G. Kaback H.R. Fendler K. pH regulation of electrogenic sugar/H+ symport in MFS sugar permeases.PLoS One. 2016; 11 (27227677): e015639210.1371/journal.pone.0156392Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The pKa of Asp22 was determined by monitoring pH-induced changes of the COOH vibrational modes of the purified GlcPSe immobilized on a gold layer in an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) cell in analogy to the surface-enhanced absorption IR spectroscopy (SEIRAS) approach used to study the pKa value of Glu325 in LacY, the most-studied MFS transporter (23Grytsyk N. Sugihara J. Kaback H.R. Hellwig P. pKa of Glu325 in LacY.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2017; 114 (28154138): 1530-153510.1073/pnas.1621431114Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The effect of the mutations on the pKa value of Asp22 is discussed. IR difference spectra have been measured to monitor the protonation/deprotonation reactions and coupled conformational changes. Fig. 2 shows the difference spectra that were obtained by subtracting spectra acquired from samples equilibrated at pH 5.5 from spectra collected of samples equilibrated at a pH that completely or almost completely deprotonates Asp22 (pH 9.5 or 8.5, respectively), in the absence of glucose. The grey line shows the inverse reaction and thus a high degree of reaction reversibility. The difference spectra reflect structural reorganization within GlcPSe caused by the shift in pH, including changes in the protein backbone conformations and the protonation state of individual side chains; for example, the COOH vibrational mode of protonated acidic residues is typically ∼1750 cm−1 (24Zscherp C. Schlesinger R. Tittor J. Oesterhelt D. Heberle J.

The position of the COOH vibrational mode that is specific for the hydrophobicity of the environment of a protonated acidic residue is only 4 cm−1 higher than the one recently observed for Glu325 in LacY (23Grytsyk N. Sugihara J. Kaback H.R. Hellwig P. pKa of Glu325 in LacY.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2017; 114 (28154138): 1530-153510.1073/pnas.1621431114Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 26Grytsyk N.

The difference spectra for the same pH step of D22A GlcPSe (Fig. 2B) is almost identical to the WT one, except for the important signal at 1750 cm−1, confirming that this signal arises from Asp22, a residue previously suggested to play a similar role to Glu325 in LacY (23Grytsyk N. Sugihara J. Kaback H.R. Hellwig P. pKa of Glu325 in LacY.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2017; 114 (28154138): 1530-153510.1073/pnas.1621431114Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 26Grytsyk N.

The spectra of both WT and D22A GlcPSe have signals in the so-called amide I region, between 1690 and 1620 cm−1, representing contributions of the protein backbone and individual side chains. The position of the amide I backbone signal is specific for the type of secondary structure. Signals at ∼1650 cm−1 correspond to α-helices, and those at ∼1642 cm−1 indicate disordered structures (27Barth A. Infrared spectroscopy of proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767 (17692815): 1073-110110.1016/j.bbabio.2007.06.004Crossref PubMed Scopus (2591) Google Scholar); β-sheets are commonly observed at ∼1636 and 1670–1690 cm−1. Depending on the environment of each secondary structure element, a shift may take place as described by so-called “doorway” modes identified by calculations on IR modes for KcsA K+ channels (28Stevenson P. Götz C. Baiz C.R. Akerboom J. Tokmakoff A. Vaziri A. Visualizing KcsA conformational changes upon ion binding by infrared spectroscopy and atomistic modeling.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2015; 119 (25861001): 5824-583110.1021/acs.jpcb.5b02223Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In that study, α-helices, which reorganize during ion transport, show shifts to positions usually assigned to β-sheet structures. The signals seen in the amide I range for GlcPSe reflect similar conformational changes. H/D exchange was performed to probe the amide region (Fig. S1). In the amide II region near 1570 cm−1, where the contribution from the protein backbone includes the in-plane N–H bending (40–60%) coupled to the ν(C–N) (20–40%) vibrational mode, characteristic signals are seen at ∼1509 cm−1 (29Vigano C. Smeyers M. Raussens V. Scheirlinckx F. Ruysschaert J.M. Goormaghtigh E. Hydrogen–deuterium exchange in membrane proteins monitored by IR spectroscopy: a new tool to resolve protein structure and dynamics.Biopolymers. 2004; 74 (15137087): 19-2610.1002/bip.20035Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Upon H/D exchange (Fig. S1B), the amide II band intensity decreases, the in-plane N–H (N–D) bending mode uncouples and appears in the 940–1040 cm−1 region, and the ν(C–N) moves to 1488 and 1461 cm−1, mixing with other modes to form a new band called amide II*. The changes in the spectra upon H/D exchange confirm that most of the signals in the difference spectra at positions lower than 1700 cm−1 originate from the protein backbone. Mutations of residues in critical positions for proton transfer and glucose transport activity have been studied at different pH values by SEIRAS. Fig. 3A shows the data obtained for pH 7.5, 8.5, and 9.5, with (spectra d–f) and without (spectra a–c) glucose, in WT GlcPSe. Whereas glucose does not seem to influence the signal at 1750 cm−1, major changes occur in the amide I and II regions, indicating differences in the pH-dependent conformational reorganization of the protein in the presence of glucose. In all spectra, the steps to pH 8.5 and 9.5 are very similar, whereas the steps between pH 8.5 and 7.5 show a significant difference. In an analogous study performed on LacY with the same approach (23Grytsyk N. Sugihara J. Kaback H.R. Hellwig P. pKa of Glu325 in LacY.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2017; 114 (28154138): 1530-153510.1073/pnas.1621431114Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the presence of 4-nitrophenyl-R-d-galactopyranoside did not influence the conformational changes. However, it is noted that 4-nitrophenyl-R-d-galactopyranoside shows very different transport rates, and direct comparison is difficult. I105S was previously studied in GlcPSe to investigate why human GLUT2, which seemingly can have a proton-binding site (Asp22 of GlcPSe is Asp27 of GLUT2), is a uniporter and not a proton symporter (8Iancu C.V. Zamoon J. Woo S.B. Aleshin A. Choe J.Y. Crystal structure of a glucose/H+ symporter and its mechanism of action.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110 (24127585): 17862-1786710.1073/pnas.1311485110Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Close to the proton-binding site, GlcPSe has Ile105, whereas in the same position, GLUT2 has Ser161, which can come within hydrogen bond distance from Asp27. Therefore, it was proposed that I105S GlcPSe would exhibit impaired active glucose transport. Indeed, this mutant had no active glucose transport in right-side-out vesicles and had an attenuated pH effect in the entrance counterflow glucose transport in proteoliposomes, although much less drastically than the D22N mutant (8Iancu C.V. Zamoon J. Woo S.B. Aleshin A. Choe J.Y. Crystal structure of a glucose/H+ symporter and its mechanism of action.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110 (24127585): 17862-1786710.1073/pnas.1311485110Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, we find that I105S substitution does not perturb the signal at 1750 cm−1, although some changes in the amide I and II region suggest smaller structural changes (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, for A167E GlcPSe (Fig. 3D), the signal at 1750 cm−1 and the signal at 1724 cm−1 are lost in the absence of glucose and restored at 2 cm−1 lower position in the presence of the substrate. The introduced Glu167 changes the environment of Asp22, pointing toward an interaction between Asp22 and Glu167, eventually introduced by a conformational change. In XylE, Asp27 (the equivalent of Asp22), interacts with Glu206 (the equivalent of Ala167 in GlcPSe), at both acidic (pH 5.8) and alkaline (pH 9.6) pH, although E206A has only a slight reduction in transport activity (11Sun L. Zeng X. Yan C. Sun X. Gong X. Rao Y. Yan N. Crystal structure of a bacterial homologue of glucose transporters GLUT1-4.Nature. 2012; 490 (23075985): 361-36610.1038/nature11524Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 20Wisedchaisri G.

Commun. 2014; 5 (25088546): 452110.1038/ncomms5521Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Residue 167, identified in analogy to XylEEc, was suggested to play a critical role in the pK switch of the H+-binding site to acidic values, to facilitate H+ release (21Bazzone A. Zabadne A.J. Salisowski A. Madej M.G. Fendler K. A loose relationship: incomplete H+/sugar coupling in the MFS sugar transporter GlcP.Biophys.

Nevertheless, the environments of the proton-binding sites in XylE and GlcPSe vary significantly, with that of XylE being mostly polar (amino acid residues Ser98, Ser102, Arg133, and Glu206), including structural water molecules, whereas that in GlcPSe is mostly hydrophobic, the only charged residue being the critical Arg102. Introducing A167E mutation in GlcPSe seems very disruptive, especially given the proximity of the hydrophobic bulky residue Ile105. Therefore, in analogy to XylE proton-binding site, we also generated the double mutant A167E/I105G; structural modeling suggested a better accommodation of A167E substitution in the double mutant than in the single mutant A167E (Fig. S2). Investigation of the double mutant A167E/I105G (Fig. 3E) pointed to major structural changes. The negative signal at 1750 cm−1 was lost in all cases and replaced by a positive feature at 1732–1720 cm−1. Because positive signals in the difference spectra corroborate with the data collected at more alkaline pH values, there is no easy explanation for this new signal that is in the spectral region typical for protonated acidic residues. It indicates the presence of a protonated residue at alkaline pH, in an environment whose pH-induced changes lead to deprotonation. This would point to a strong reorganization of the residue's microenvironment, enabling a stabilization of the protonated residue despite the buffer alkalization. The introduced Glu167 residue could be contributing here, and also Asp22 could be showing a different signature caused by the modified environment in the mutant. The pKa of Asp22 in WT and different mutants, in the presence and absence of glucose, was determined by plotting the difference in signal intensity at 1750 cm−1 versus pH (Fig. 4). From the ΔIR fit observed (red and black, with and without sugar, respectively), Asp22 has a pKa of 8.5 ± 0.1, a value that agrees remarkably well with the pKa obtained previously by Bazzone et al. (21Bazzone A. Zabadne A.J. Salisowski A. Madej M.G. Fendler K. A loose relationship: incomplete H+/sugar coupling in the MFS sugar transporter GlcP.Biophys. J. 2017; 113 (29262366): 2736-274910.1016/j.bpj.2017.09.038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) for the glucose transport, through a different approach. The mutant I105S GlcPSe, which has a serine in the proximity of the H+-binding site, would have been a possible candidate to perturb the proton binding. However, the pKa of this mutant (8.5 ± 0.1) is similar to that of WT GlcPSe, showing that Asp22 is not interacting with Ser105. The comparison of the data with and without glucose reveals that the pKa of Asp22 in WT and I105S is independent of glucose. For the A167E mutant, the scenario is more complex. Whereas Asp22 has a pKa of 8.5 in the presence of glucose, there is no signal from Asp22 in the absence of sugar, pointing to a major structural reorganization in the environment of the residue, which might be locked in a certain conformation because of the steric disruptions in the proton-binding site (Fig. S2). In the A167E/I105G mutant, the signal of the acidic residue at 1750 cm−1 is lost irrespective of the glucose presence. Most likely Asp22 is deprotonated even at pH 5.5, the lowest pH applied in our experiments. We examined the glucose binding affinity to purified GlcPSe WT and proton-binding site mutants, at pH 7.5 and 9.5, using isothermal calorimetry (ITC). Previous studies showed a lower Kd of glucose in GlcPSe at alkaline pH compared with that at acidic pH (21Bazzone A. Zabadne A.J. Salisowski A. Madej M.G. Fendler K. A loose relationship: incomplete H+/sugar coupling in the MFS sugar transporter GlcP.Biophys.

We found a similar trend by ITC, with Kd of glucose at pH 7.5 being ∼7-fold higher than that at pH 9.5 for the WT transporter"

Factors affecting canine lymphoma progression are unknown and complex, but there is evidence that genetic mutations play an important role. We employed Next Gen DNA sequencing of six dogs with multicentric B-cell lymphoma undergoing CHOP chemotherapy to identify genetic variations potentially impacting response. Paired samples from non-neoplastic tissue (blood mononuclear cells) and lymphoma were collected at the time of diagnosis. Cases with progression free survival above the median of 231 days were grouped as 'good' responders and cases below the median were categorized as 'poor' responders. The average number of variants found was 17,138 per case. The variants were filtered to examine those with predicted moderate or high impacts. Many of the genes with variants had human orthologs with links to cancer, but the majority of variants were not previously reported in canine or human lymphoma. Seven genes had variants found in the cancers of at least two 'poor' responders but in no 'good' responders: ATRNL1, BAIAP2L2, ZNF384, ST6GALNAC5, ENSCAFG00000030179 (human ortholog: riboflavin kinase RFK), ENSCAFG00000029320, and ENSCAFG00000007370 (human ortholog: immunoglobin IGKV4-1). Two genes had variants found in the cancers of at least two 'good' responders but in no 'poor' responders: COX18 and ENSCAFG00000030512. ENSCAFG00000030512 has no reported orthologue in any other species. The role of these mutations in the progression of canine lymphoma requires further functional analyses and larger scale study."

It evaluates the health service provision by understanding maternal perceptions and expectations and promoting adherence to health services. This study aimed to identify the sociodemographic, obstetric, and medical factors contributing to labor satisfaction among postpartum women and examine the association between labor and postnatal satisfaction. Methodology A cross-sectional study using systematic random sampling in a ratio of 1:5 based on the delivery list in a labor room in a tertiary hospital was applied. Information was obtained from medical records for sociodemographic characteristics and obstetric and medical histories. Face-to-face interviews were performed to obtain responses for Malay versions of the Women’s Views of Birth Labour Satisfaction Questionnaire and the Women’s Views of Birth Postnatal Satisfaction Questionnaire. Simple and general linear regression analyses were performed. Results A total of 110 participants responded, accounting for a response rate of 100%. High-risk color codes, the period of gestation, household income, and were significantly associated with maternal satisfaction during labor. The association between labor and postnatal satisfaction was significant. Conclusion Identifying these associated factors and differences may lead to understanding and contributing to specific and targeted strategies for tackling issues related to maternal satisfaction."

Magnetic resonance (MR) scans at 17.6 Tesla and histological analysis were performed after one week, eight and twelve weeks. All in vivo MR measurements were acquired using a flow sensitive phase contrast method for determining vectorial flow. Histological sections were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin, Elastica van Gieson and CD68 staining. Data analysis was performed using Ensight and a Matlab-based “Flow Tool”. The body weight of ApoE-/- mice increased significantly over 12 weeks. WSS values increased in the Western Diet group over the time period; in contrast, in the Chow Diet group the values decreased from the first to the second measurement point. Western Diet mice showed small plaque formations with elastin fragmentations after 8 weeks and big plaque formations after 12 weeks; Chow Diet mice showed a few elastin fragmentations after 8 weeks and small plaque formations after 12 weeks. Favored by high-fat diet, plaque formation results in higher values of WSS. With wall shear stress being a known predictor for atherosclerotic plaque development, ultra highfield MRI can serve as a tool for studying the causes and beginnings of atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W3082094667,"Background Recent studies have reported that after the introduction of rotavirus vaccine the incidence of intussusception did not change among infants, or slightly increased at the age immediately after the first dose. The rotavirus vaccines were introduced in Korea for private market use in 2007–2008. We investigated the incidence of intussusception before (2002–2006) and after (2009–2015) the vaccine introduction in Korea. Methods We conducted an interrupted time series study that used data from the Korean National Health Insurance database to identify infants (<12 months of age) who were diagnosed with intussusception and underwent non-invasive or invasive reduction from 2002 to 2015. According to the recommended ages for immunization, the annual intussusception incidence and the incidence rate ratios were calculated among three age groups, 6–14, 15–24, and 25–34 weeks. Results The annual incidences in infants have decreased over time from 241.7 per 100,000 infants (pre-vaccine period) to 160.1–205.2 per 100,000 infants (post-vaccine period). The incidence rate ratio during the post-vaccine period ranged from 0.66 to 0.85. The incidences of intussusception in all three infant age groups have decreased in post-vaccine period compared to pre-vaccine period (incidence rate ratio range: 0.31–0.65, 0.47–0.75, and 0.68–0.94 in 6–14, 15–24, and 25–34 weeks, respectively). Conclusions The incidence of intussusception in infants did not increase after the rotavirus vaccine introduction in Korea, but rather decreased over the past decades. Since the incidence of intussusception varies according to country or region, continuous monitoring the incidence of intussusception in infants is necessary in each county or region."

This study investigates the effects of economic and sociocultural heterogeneity on trust and cooperation in common-pool resources using a laboratory experiment. The experiment comprises two Investment Games and a Common-Pool Resource Game, with a sample of 344 subjects from the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. By measuring the effects of economic and sociocultural heterogeneity separately as well as combined, this study disentangles the effects of specific heterogeneity types on cooperation in common-pool resources; something that has not been done before. Higher levels of trusting behaviour are found to have a positive effect on cooperation on the micro- and macro-level over time. While theory suggests negative effects of both forms of heterogeneity on cooperation through decreased levels of trust, the results show a surprising positive effect of economic heterogeneity on cooperation, but a negative effect if economic and sociocultural heterogeneity are combined. This study concludes that economic inequality can promote cooperation in CPRs, unless this inequality is lined up with sociocultural differences."
https://openalex.org/W3082062850,"While most studies have viewed strategic flexibility as a capability to cope with the environmental turbulence and promote the product innovation, few of them investigate the mediating mechanism in the relationship between the strategic flexibility and product innovation. According to the resource-based view, we regard the bricolage as a concrete activity of recombining the different resources in the product development process and explore the underlying mechanism. Our results reveal that strategic flexibility has a positive and significant effect on bricolage. The effect of strategic flexibility on product innovation is partially mediated by bricolage. Furthermore, environmental turbulence moderates the relationship between strategic flexibility and bricolage positively. We contribute to the strategic flexibility research by exploring the effect of strategic flexibility on the bricolage and product innovation form a mediating perspective and offering a more nuanced and in-depth understanding of the impact of strategic flexibility. This research also provides new evidence on the effect of strategic flexibility on product innovation in transition economies such as China, where strategic flexibility is essential for firms to adapt to an uncertain environment."
https://openalex.org/W3082096391,"The efficacy of auxinic herbicides, a valuable weed control tool for growers worldwide, has been shown to vary with the time of day in which applications are made. However, little is known about the mechanisms causing this phenomenon. Investigating the differential in planta behavior of these herbicides across different times of application may grant an ability to advise which properties of auxinic herbicides are desirable when applications must be made around the clock. Radiolabeled herbicide experiments demonstrated a likely increase in ATP-binding cassette subfamily B (ABCB)-mediated 2,4-D and dicamba transport in Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S. Watson) at simulated dawn compared to mid-day, as dose response models indicated that many orders of magnitude higher concentrations of N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) and verapamil, respectively, are required to inhibit translocation by 50% at simulated sunrise compared to mid-day. Gas chromatographic analysis displayed that ethylene evolution in A. palmeri was higher when dicamba was applied during mid-day compared to sunrise. Furthermore, it was found that inhibition of translocation via 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) resulted in an increased amount of 2,4-D-induced ethylene evolution at sunrise, and the inhibition of dicamba translocation via NPA reversed the difference in ethylene evolution across time of application. Dawn applications of these herbicides were associated with increased expression of a putative 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase biosynthesis gene NCED1, while there was a notable lack of trends observed across times of day and across herbicides with ACS1, encoding 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase. Overall, this research indicates that translocation is differentially regulated via specific protein-level mechanisms across times of application, and that ethylene release, a chief phytotoxic process involved in the response to auxinic herbicides, is related to translocation. Furthermore, transcriptional regulation of abscisic acid involvement in phytotoxicity and/or translocation are suggested."
https://openalex.org/W3082141561,"Background There are variations in recommendations from different guidelines regarding the indications for repeat lumbar puncture (LP) in young infants with the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. Objective To evaluate the frequency of repeat LPs and the characteristics of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) parameters in repeated sampling and their predictive values for adverse outcomes in a national cohort. Methods This cohort study included infants born January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2014, who had proven or suspected bacterial meningitis within the first 90 days of life at seven paediatric tertiary care hospitals across Canada, and who underwent a repeat LP at the discretion of the treating physicians. Results Forty-nine of 111 infants (44%) underwent repeat LP at a median of 5 (IQR: 3, 13) days after the LP that led to the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. Those who had meningitis caused by gram negative bacilli were more likely to have repeat LP than those with gram positive bacteria (77% versus 57%; p = 0.012). White blood cell (WBC) count on the second spinal tap yielded an area under the curve of 0.88 for predicting sequelae of meningitis at discharge from the hospital, with a cut-off value of 366 × 106/L, providing a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 88%. Conclusion In this multi-centre retrospective cohort study, infants with gram negative meningitis were more likely to have repeated LP. A high WBC on the second CSF sample was predictive of adverse outcome at the time of discharge from the hospital."
https://openalex.org/W3082564993,"The origins of life on Earth have been the subject of inquiry since the early days of philosophical thought and are still intensively investigated by the researchers around the world. One of the theories explaining the life emergence, that gained the most attention recently is the RNA World hypothesis, which assumes that life on Earth was sparked by replicating RNA chains. Since wet lab analysis is time-consuming, many mathematical and computational approaches have been proposed that try to explain the origins of life. Recently proposed one, based on the work by Takeuchi and Hogeweg, addresses the problem of interplay between RNA replicases and RNA parasitic species, which is crucial for understanding the first steps of prebiotic evolution. In this paper, the aforementioned model has been extended and modified by introducing RNA sequence (structure) information and mutation rate close to real one. It allowed to observe the simple evolution mechanisms, which could have led to the more complicated systems and eventually, to the formation of the first cells. The main goal of this study was to determine the conditions that allowed the spontaneous emergence and evolution of the prebiotic replicases equipped with simple functional domains within a large population. Here we show that polymerase ribozymes could have appeared randomly and then quickly started to copy themselves in order for the system to reach equilibrium. It has been shown that evolutionary selection works even in the simplest systems."
https://openalex.org/W3082927782,"Bone metastases are a frequent complication in prostate cancer, and several studies have shown that vitamin D deficiency promotes bone metastases. However, while many studies focus on vitamin D's role in cell metabolism, the effect of chronically low vitamin D levels on bone tissue, i.e. insufficient mineralization of the tissue, has largely been ignored. To investigate, whether poor tissue mineralization promotes cancer cell attachment, we used a fluorescence based adhesion assay and single cell force spectroscopy to quantify the adhesion of two prostate cancer cell lines to well-mineralized and demineralized dentin, serving as biomimetic bone model system. Adhesion rates of bone metastases-derived PC3 cells increased significantly on demineralized dentin. Additionally, on mineralized dentin, PC3 cells adhered mainly via membrane anchored surface receptors, while on demineralized dentin, they adhered via cytoskeleton-anchored transmembrane receptors, pointing to an interaction via exposed collagen fibrils. The adhesion rate of lymph node derived LNCaP cells on the other hand is significantly lower than that of PC3 and not predominately mediated by cytoskeleton-linked receptors. This indicates that poor tissue mineralization facilitates the adhesion of invasive cancer cells by the exposure of collagen and emphasizes the disease modifying effect of sufficient vitamin D for cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W3008545080,"Background The spread of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a leading global public-health challenge. Because not all biological mechanisms of resistance are known, culture-based (phenotypic) drug-susceptibility testing (DST) provides important information that influences clinical decision-making. Current phenotypic tests typically require pre-culture to ensure bacterial loads are at a testable level (taking 2–4 weeks) followed by 10–14 days to confirm growth or lack thereof. Methods and findings We present a 2-step method to obtain DST results within 3 days of sample collection. The first involves selectively concentrating live mycobacterial cells present in relatively large volumes of sputum (~2-10mL) using commercially available magnetic-nanoparticles (MNPs) into smaller volumes, thereby bypassing the need for pre-culture. The second involves using microchannel Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (m-EIS) to monitor multiple aliquots of small volumes (~10μL) of suspension containing mycobacterial cells, MNPs, and candidate-drugs to determine whether cells grow, die, or remain static under the conditions tested. m-EIS yields an estimate for the solution “bulk capacitance” (Cb), a parameter that is proportional to the number of live bacteria in suspension. We are thus able to detect cell death (bactericidal action of the drug) in addition to cell-growth. We demonstrate proof-of-principle using M. bovis BCG and M. smegmatis suspended in artificial sputum. Loads of ~ 2000–10,000 CFU of mycobacteria were extracted from ~5mL of artificial sputum during the decontamination process with efficiencies of 84% -100%. Subsequently, suspensions containing ~105 CFU/mL of mycobacteria with 10 mg/mL of MNPs were monitored in the presence of bacteriostatic and bactericidal drugs at concentrations below, at, and above known MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) values. m-EIS data (ΔCb) showed data consistent with growth, death or stasis as expected and/or recorded using plate counts. Electrical signals of death were visible as early as 3 hours, and growth was seen in < 3 days for all samples, allowing us to perform DST in < 3 days. Conclusion We demonstrated “proof of principle” that (a) live mycobacteria can be isolated from sputum using MNPs with high efficiency (almost all the bacteria that survive decontamination) and (b) that the efficacy of candidate drugs on the mycobacteria thus isolated (in suspensions containing MNPs) could be tested in real-time using m-EIS."
https://openalex.org/W3081963811,"Microwave heating of foods may alter their content. Yet, parents commonly heat infant formula in the microwave oven. The study aimed at understanding whether microwave heating of formula changes its fatty acid (FA) composition. Portions of infant formula were prepared and divided in three parts: control (sampled twice: at the start and after 30 minutes), microwave (sampled twice: after reaching 37°C and 50°C), and water bath (sampled twice: after reaching 37°C and 50°C). In thus obtained samples, a total profile of 25 FA was assessed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Overall, fourteen portions were prepared, which were sampled 84 times yielding 2075 individual total FA level measurements. Few differences were identified between the microwave, control, and water bath groups. Microwave warming to 37°C was associated with increases of C12 (median increased by +0.40%, p = 0.0063), C14 (+0.05%, p = 0.0091), and C4 content (+6.90%, p = 0.0131). Microwaving up to 50°C slightly decreased C16:1trans (-5.00%, p = 0.0463) and C18:2trans1 (-5.13%, p = 0.0231). A paired comparison of pooled control and microwaved samples revealed increases in C12 (+0.18%, p = 0.0490) as well as a loss of C18:2trans1 (also -5.13%, p = 0.0073) and C18:2trans3 (-5.56%, p = 0.0042) after microwave treatment. C18:2trans1 (-2.63%, p = 0.0132) and C18:3trans1 (-2.26%, p = 0.0434) were lower in microwaved samples compared with the water bath. A slightly lower C18:2 content was found in the water bath samples than in the control groups (-0.11%, p = 0.0430). None of these differences would remain significant after a correction for multiple comparisons. Microwave heating of infant formula to 37°C or 50°C might marginally alter its total FA profile. Further studies are required to determine whether it alters the rate of free radical formation."
https://openalex.org/W3082149434,"Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is a severe perinatal complication that can increase risk for mental illness. To investigate the mechanism by which FGR mice develop mental illness in adulthood, we established the FGR mouse model and the FGR mice did not display obvious depression-like behaviors, but after environmental stress exposure, FGR mice were more likely to exhibit depression-like behaviors than control mice. Moreover, FGR mice had significantly fewer dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area but no difference in serotoninergic neurons in the dorsal raphe. RNA-seq analysis showed that the downregulated genes in the midbrain of FGR mice were associated with many mental diseases and were especially involved in the regulation of NMDA-selective glutamate receptor (NMDAR) activity. Furthermore, the NMDAR antagonist memantine can relieve the stress-induced depression-like behaviors of FGR mice. In summary, our findings provide a theoretical basis for future research and treatment of FGR-related depression."
https://openalex.org/W3082727736,"The mean systemic filling pressure (MSFP) represents an interaction between intravascular volume and global cardiovascular compliance (GCC). Intravascular volume expansion using fluid resuscitation is the most frequent intervention in intensive care and emergency medicine for patients in shock and with haemodynamic compromise. The relationship between dynamic changes in MSFP, GCC and left ventricular compliance is unknown. We conducted prospective interventional pilot study following euthanasia in post cardiotomy adult sheep, investigating the relationships between changes in MSFP induced by rapid intravascular filling with fluids, global cardiovascular compliance and left ventricular compliance. This pilot investigation suggested a robust correlation between a gradual increase in the intravascular stressed volume from 0 to 40 ml/kg and the MSFP r = 0.708 95% CI 0.435 to 0.862, making feasible future prospective interventional studies. Based on the statistical modelling from the pilot results, we expect to identify a strong correlation of 0.71 ± 0.1 (95% CI) between the MSFP and the stressed intravascular volume in a future study."
https://openalex.org/W3082864981,"This study analyzed the survival and protective predictors of in-hospital cardiopulmonary cerebral resuscitation (CPCR) to potentially help physicians create effective treatment plans for End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients.We extracted the data of 7,116 ESKD patients who received their first in-hospital CPCR after initial dialysis between 2004 and 2012 from the National Health Insurance Research Database. The primary outcome was the survival rate during the first in-hospital CPCR. The secondary outcome was the median post-discharge survival.From 2004 through 2012, the incidence of in-hospital CPCR decreases from 3.97 to 3.67 events per 1,000 admission days (P for linear trend <0.001). The survival rate for the first in-hospital CPCR did not change significantly across the 9 years (P for trend = 0.244), whereas the median survival of post-discharge survival increased significantly from 3.0 months in 2004 to 6.8 months in 2011 (P for linear trend <0.001). In addition, multivariable analysis identified older age as a risk factor and prior intracardiac defibrillator (ICD) or cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) implantation as a protective factor for in-hospital death during the first in-hospital CPCR.The incidence of in-hospital CPCR and the duration post-discharge among ESKD patients improved despite there being no significant difference in the survival rate of ESKD patients after CPCP. Either ICD or CRT-D implantation may be advisable for ESKD patients with a high risk of sudden cardiac death."
