https://openalex.org/W3184752776,"Personal protective equipment (PPE) is crucially important to the safety of both patients and medical personnel, particularly in the event of an infectious pandemic. As the incidence of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) increases exponentially in the United States and many parts of the world, healthcare provider demand for these necessities is currently outpacing supply. In the midst of the current pandemic, there has been a concerted effort to identify viable ways to conserve PPE, including decontamination after use. In this study, we outline a procedure by which PPE may be decontaminated using ultraviolet (UV) radiation in biosafety cabinets (BSCs), a common element of many academic, public health, and hospital laboratories. According to the literature, effective decontamination of N95 respirator masks or surgical masks requires UV-C doses of greater than 1 Jcm −2 , which was achieved after 4.3 hours per side when placing the N95 at the bottom of the BSCs tested in this study. We then demonstrated complete inactivation of the human coronavirus NL63 on N95 mask material after 15 minutes of UV-C exposure at 61 cm (232 μW cm −2 ). Our results provide support to healthcare organizations looking for methods to extend their reserves of PPE."
https://openalex.org/W3184729366,"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected all age groups worldwide, but older adults have been affected greatly with an increased risk of severe illness and mortality. Nepal is struggling with the COVID-19 pandemic. The normal life of older adults, one of the vulnerable populations to COVID-19 infection, has been primarily impacted. The current evidence shows that the COVID-19 virus strains are deadly, and non-compliance to standard protocols can have serious consequences, increasing fear among older adults. This study assessed the perceived fear of COVID-19 and associated factors among older adults in eastern Nepal. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted between July and September 2020 among 847 older adults (≥60 years) residing in three districts of eastern Nepal. Perceived fear of COVID-19 was measured using the seven-item Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S). Multivariate logistic regression identified the factors associated with COVID-19 fear. Results The mean score of the FCV-19S was 18.1 (SD = 5.2), and a sizeable proportion of older adults, ranging between 12%-34%, agreed with the seven items of the fear scale. Increasing age, Dalit ethnicity, remoteness to the health facility, and being concerned or overwhelmed with the COVID-19 were associated with greater fear of COVID-19. In contrast, preexisting health conditions were inversely associated with fear. Conclusion Greater fear of the COVID-19 among the older adults in eastern Nepal suggests that during unprecedented times such as the current pandemic, the psychological needs of older adults should be prioritized. Establishing and integrating community-level mental health support as a part of the COVID-19 preparedness and response plan might help to combat COVID-19 fear among them."

Detailed scientific analysis of this event is currently underway to come. However, it is very important to have the right facts and figures to take all possible actions that are needed to avoid COVID-19. In the practice and application of big data sciences, it is always of interest to provide the best description of the data under consideration. The recent studies have shown the potential of statistical distributions in modeling data in applied sciences, especially in medical science. In this article, we continue to carry this area of research, and introduce a new statistical model called the arcsine modified Weibull distribution. The proposed model is introduced using the modified Weibull distribution with the arcsine- X approach which is based on the trigonometric strategy. The maximum likelihood estimators of the parameters of the new model are obtained and the performance these estimators are assessed by conducting a Monte Carlo simulation study. Finally, the effectiveness and utility of the arcsine modified Weibull distribution are demonstrated by modeling COVID-19 patients data. The data set represents the survival times of fifty-three patients taken from a hospital in China. The practical application shows that the proposed model out-classed the competitive models and can be chosen as a good candidate distribution for modeling COVID-19, and other related data sets."
https://openalex.org/W3186647381,"Histone H3K4me1 and H3K27ac are enhancer-specific modifications and are required for enhancers to activate transcription of target genes. However, the reciprocal effects of these histone modifications on each other and their roles in enhancers are not clear. Here to comparatively analyze the role of these modifications, we inhibited H3K4me1 and H3K27ac by deleting the SET domains of histone methyltransferases MLL3 and MLL4 and the HAT domain of histone acetyltransferase p300, respectively, in erythroid K562 cells. The loss of H3K4me1 reduced H3K27ac at the β-globin enhancer LCR HSs, but H3K27ac reduction did not affect H3K4me1. This unequal relationship between two modifications was revealed in putative enhancers by genome-wide analysis using ChIP-seq. Histone H3 eviction at putative enhancers was weakened by the loss of H3K4me1 but not by the loss of H3K27ac. Chromatin remodeling complexes were recruited into the β-globin LCR HSs in a H3K4me1-dependent manner. In contrast, H3K27ac was required for enhancer RNA (eRNA) transcription, and H3K4me1 was not enough for it. Forced H3K27ac-induced eRNA transcription without affecting H3K4me1 at the β-globin LCR HSs. These results indicate that H3K4me1 and H3K27ac affect each other in different ways and play more direct roles in nucleosome eviction and eRNA transcription, respectively, at enhancers."
https://openalex.org/W3183171028,"Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in severe detrimental effects on the mental well-being of health care workers (HCW). Consequently, there has been a need to identify health-promoting resources in order to mitigate the psychological impact of the pandemic on HCW. Objective Our objective was to investigate the association of sense of coherence (SOC), social support and religiosity with self-reported mental symptoms and increase of subjective burden during the COVID-19 pandemic in HCW. Methods Our sample comprised 4324 HCW of four professions (physicians, nurses, medical technical assistants (MTA) and pastoral workers) who completed an online survey from 20 April to 5 July 2020. Health-promoting resources were assessed using the Sense of Coherence Scale Short Form (SOC-3), the ENRICHD Social Support Inventory (ESSI) and one item on religiosity derived from the Scale of Transpersonal Trust (TPV). Anxiety and depression symptoms were measured with the PHQ-2 and GAD-2. The increase of subjective burden due to the pandemic was assessed as the retrospective difference between burden during the pandemic and before the pandemic. Results In multiple regressions, higher SOC was strongly associated with fewer anxiety and depression symptoms. Higher social support was also related to less severe mental symptoms, but with a smaller effect size, while religiosity showed minimal to no correlation with anxiety or depression. In professional group analysis, SOC was negatively associated with mental symptoms in all groups, while social support only correlated significantly with mental health outcomes in physicians and MTA. In the total sample and among subgroups, an increase of subjective burden was meaningfully associated only with a weaker SOC. Conclusion Perceived social support and especially higher SOC appeared to be beneficial for mental health of HCW during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the different importance of the resources in the respective occupations requires further research to identify possible reasons."
https://openalex.org/W3183839551,"Targeting MAPK pathway using a combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors is an efficient strategy to treat melanoma harboring BRAF-mutation. The development of acquired resistance is inevitable due to the signaling pathway rewiring. Combining western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and reverse phase protein array (RPPA), we aim to understanding the role of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, a center node of intracellular signaling network, in mediating drug resistance of BRAF-mutant melanoma to the combination of BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) and MEK inhibitor (MEKi) therapy. The mTORC1 signaling pathway is initially suppressed by BRAFi and MEKi combination in melanoma but rebounds overtime after tumors acquire resistance to the combination therapy (CR) as assayed in cultured cells and PDX models. In vitro experiments showed that a subset of CR melanoma cells was sensitive to mTORC1 inhibition. The mTOR inhibitors, rapamycin and NVP-BEZ235, induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in CR cell lines. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrated that rapamycin and NVP-BEZ235 treatment reduced tumor growth in CR xenograft models. Mechanistically, AKT or ERK contributes to the activation of mTORC1 in CR cells, depending on PTEN status of these cells. Our study reveals that mTOR activation is essential for drug resistance of melanoma to MAPK inhibitors, and provides insight into the rewiring of the signaling networks in CR melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W3183581140,"Metformin is the first-line antidiabetic agent for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treatment. Although accumulated evidence has shed light on the consequences of metformin action, the precise mechanisms of its action, especially in the pancreas, are not fully understood. Aquaporin 7 (AQP7) acts as a critical regulator of intraislet glycerol content, which is necessary for insulin production and secretion. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different doses of metformin on AQP7 expression and explore the possible mechanism of its protective effects in the pancreatic islets. We used an in vivo model of high-fat diet in streptozocin-induced diabetic rats and an in vitro model of rat pancreatic β-cells (INS-1 cells) damaged by hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Our data showed that AQP7 expression levels were decreased, whereas p38 and JNK mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) were activated in vivo and in vitro in response to hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. T2DM rats treated with metformin demonstrated a reduction in blood glucose levels and increased regeneration of pancreatic β-cells. In addition, metformin upregulated AQP7 expression as well as inhibited activation of p38 and JNK MAPKs both in vivo and in vitro. Overexpression of AQP7 increased glycerol influx into INS-1 cells, whereas inhibition of AQP7 reduced glycerol influx, thereby decreasing subsequent insulin secretion. Our findings demonstrate a new mechanism by which metformin suppresses the p38 and JNK pathways, thereby upregulating pancreatic AQP7 expression and promoting glycerol influx into pancreatic β-cells and subsequent insulin secretion in T2DM."

The composition of the microbiome was well-known to be associated with health status, and production traits, but published results are difficult to reproduce due to large sources of variation. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the associations of ruminal microbiota and its association with genetic lines selected by somatic cell score (SCS) or milk persistency (PERS), as well as milk production, somatic cell score, fat and protein contents, and fatty acids and proteins of milk, using the principles of compositional data. A large sample of 700 Lacaune dairy ewes from INRAE La Fage feeding the same diet and belonging to two divergent genetic lines selected for SCS or PERS was used. The ruminal bacterial metagenome was sequenced using the 16S rRNA gene, resulting in 2,059 operational taxonomic units affiliated with 112 genera. The abundance data were centred log-transformed after the replacement of zeros with the geometric Bayesian method. Discriminant analysis of the SCS showed differences between SCS+ and SCS- ewes, while for PERS no difference was obtained. Milk traits as fat content, protein content, saturated fatty acids and caseins of milk were negatively associated with Prevotella (R = [-0.08;-0.16]), Suttonella (R = [-0.09;-0.16]) and Ruminococcus (R = [-0.08;-0.16]), and positively associated with Lachnospiraceae (R = [0.09;0.16]) and Christensenellaceae (R = [0.09;0.16]). Our findings provide an understanding of the application of compositional data to microbiome analysis, and the potential association of Prevotella, Suttonella, Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae with milk production traits such as milk fatty acids and proteins in dairy sheep."

Prospective, randomized experimental study; twenty-one adult male Wistar rats were selected. Heart rate (beats minute-1), respiratory rate (breaths minute-1), and paw withdrawal latency (onset of radiant heat until paw withdrawal/seconds) were measured prior (T0) and after (T5, T10, T15, T20) intraplantar injection with saline solution 0,9% (group S), butorphanol 1 mg kg-1 (group B), and tramadol 1 mg kg-1 (group T). Shapiro-Wilk normality test and Friedman test were used to analyze the data expressed by median and range. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Statistical analysis of heart rate showed that there were significant differences between groups at different monitoring times. There were no significant differences in respiratory rate after intraplantar injection in any of the treatment groups. The paw withdrawal latency values at T5, T10, and T15 minutes after intraplantar injection in the group B were significantly higher compared to baseline value and to the values of the other groups. The paw withdrawal latency were no significant changes in the measurements of intragroup in S and T. Intraplantar administration of butorphanol provides a good analgesia and significantly increases paw withdrawal latency compared to tramadol. Intraplantar injection of butorphanol could be useful and safe and safe technique to achieve local analgesia for minor surgical procedures in rats."
https://openalex.org/W3185914177,"The purpose of the study was to evaluate predicted maturity offset (time before age at PHV) and age at PHV (chronological age [CA] minus maturity offset) in a longitudinal sample of 58 under-13 club level soccer players in central Portugal for whom ages at PHV were estimated with the SITAR model. Two maturity offset prediction equations were applied: the original equation which requires CA sitting height, estimated leg length, height and weight, and a modified equation which requires CA and height. Predicted maturity offset increased, on average, with CA at prediction throughout the age range considered, while variation in predicted maturity offset and ages at PHV within CA groups was considerably reduced compared to variation in observed ages at offset and at PHV. Predicted maturity offset and ages at PHV were consistently later than observed maturity offset and age at PHV among early maturing players, and earlier than observed in late maturing players. Both predicted offset and ages at PHV with the two equations were, on average, later than observed among players maturing on time. Intra-individual variation in predicted ages at PHV with each equation was considerable. The results for soccer players were consistent with similar studies in the general population and two recent longitudinal studies of soccer players. The results question the utility of predicted maturity offset and age at PHV as valid indicators of maturity timing and status."
https://openalex.org/W3184763389,"Job satisfaction has gained increasing interest in the world of work and a vast field of research has been stimulated regarding its antecedents. Among these, personality traits have received consistent and significant attention, with a particular emphasis on conscientiousness. To delve deeper and detail these aspects, in the present research, a moderation model was hypothesized, with the aim of investigating the effect of age on the association between conscientiousness (and its subdimensions scrupulousness and perseverance) and job satisfaction. The age-moderated interactions of the other Big Five personality traits were also explored. The study involved 202 Italian workers (92 men, 110 women) with a mean age of 44.82 years (SD = 10.56) who completed the Big Five Questionnaire and the Job Satisfaction Scale. The results showed a positive association between conscientiousness and job satisfaction. This was moderated by age to the extent that it was significant for younger and average-age workers and was less significant for older workers. Similar results were found for the subdomain of perseverance, while the relationship between scrupulousness and job satisfaction was not significant. Furthermore, no age-moderated interaction between the other Big Five personality traits and Job satisfaction were found. Such data supports interactive models that highlight the need to integrate personality traits with other factors in exploring the antecedents of job satisfaction. These findings provide additional elements to an understanding of the factors contributing to workers satisfaction, and could have important applicative implications in a framework for healthy organizations and the well-being movement."

This paper uses data from the 13 major grain producing areas in China from 2009 to 2018 to analyze the coordination of the Internet development level and the agricultural ecological-efficiency, and it further investigates the degree of coupling and coordination between the two. The results of theis study are as follows.(1) The Internet development level of China's 13 main grain production areas has been continuously improving. The average Internet penetration rate increased from 0.25 in 2008 to 0.54 in 2018. (2) The agricultural ecological efficiency of China's main grain production areas has gradually improved. The average value of agricultural ecological efficiency increased from 0.45 in 2009 to 0.79 in 2018. (3) The Internet development level in China's main grain production areas and the continuous improvement of coordination and degree of coupling of the agricultural ecological efficiency show that the interaction between them has led to continuous improvements in the agricultural informatization development and agricultural green development. However, the coordination between the two still has significant room for growth, and there is a certain gap between the different regions."
https://openalex.org/W3186225339,"High yields of RNA are routinely prepared following the two-step approach of high-yield in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase followed by extensive purification using gel separation or chromatographic methods. We recently demonstrated that in high-yield transcription reactions, as RNA accumulates in solution, T7 RNA polymerase rebinds and extends the encoded RNA (using the RNA as a template), resulting in a product pool contaminated with longer-than-desired, (partially) double-stranded impurities. Current purification methods often fail to fully eliminate these impurities, which, if present in therapeutics, can stimulate the innate immune response with potentially fatal consequences. In this work, we introduce a novel in vitro transcription method that generates high yields of encoded RNA without double-stranded impurities, reducing the need for further purification. Transcription is carried out at high-salt conditions to eliminate RNA product rebinding, while promoter DNA and T7 RNA polymerase are cotethered in close proximity on magnetic beads to drive promoter binding and transcription initiation, resulting in an increase in overall yield and purity of only the encoded RNA. A more complete elimination of double-stranded RNA during synthesis will not only reduce overall production costs, but also should ultimately enable therapies and technologies that are currently being hampered by those impurities.

Solid-phase chemical synthesis can, in principle, generate RNAs up to 50 to 100 nt in length, but both yield and purity decrease with increasing lengths (1Lebedev A.V. Koukhareva I.I. Beck T.

Therefore, therapeutics researchers must follow up in vitro T7 RNA polymerase transcription with often very extensive purification methods (32Mellits K.H. Pe’ery T. Manche L. Robertson H.D.

Ribonucleic acid purification.J. Chromatogr. A. 2014; 1355: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Gel or chromatic (HPLC) purification methods are time-consuming, result in a loss of yield, and are imprecise, as the encoded product may not always be readily identified. At long RNA lengths, the resolution in these separations becomes progressively worse, making the purification of the precisely encoded RNA unattainable. A recently developed method removes dsRNA impurities from the in vitro transcription pool by their selective binding to cellulose in an ethanol-based buffer (37Baiersdörfer M. Boros G. Muramatsu H. Mahiny A. Vlatkovic I. Sahin U. Karikó K. A facile method for the removal of dsRNA contaminant from in vitro-transcribed mRNA.Mol. Ther. Nucleic Acids. 2019; 15: 26-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the effectiveness of this method is expected to depend on the relative lengths of double-stranded regions and may remove desired RNAs with natively structured regions. Although researchers have long focused on improving the overall yield of in vitro transcription reactions, we have confirmed with RNA-Seq that the very conditions of high-yield synthesis often drive the correct product into primer extended, double-stranded impurities (24Gholamalipour Y. Mudiyanselage A.K. Martin C.T. 3’ end additions by T7 RNA polymerase are RNA self-templated, distributive and diverse in character-RNA-Seq analyses.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46: 9253-9263Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This not only impacts the overall purity, but also the yield of the encoded RNA. In this research, we present a novel method of in vitro transcription that allows promoter-directed transcription while preventing primer extension activity, thereby dramatically reducing double-stranded impurities. In brief, by increasing salt concentrations in solution, we reduce all protein–nucleic acid interactions. To selectively restore promoter binding, we tether both T7 RNA polymerase and promoter DNA to a solid support (beads). This drives their association even at high salt concentrations. Near elimination of RNA rebinding and extension not only results in a dramatic reduction in longer, primer-extended products, but also nets a dramatic increase in the yield of encoded RNA. The goal of this study is to eliminate RNA product rebinding and subsequent extension activities of T7 RNA polymerase, while retaining promoter-directed transcription. Like almost all protein–nucleic acid interactions, both initial binding of T7 RNA polymerase to its promoter and rebinding of product RNA are stabilized in part by electrostatic interactions between positively charged residues on the RNA polymerase surface and the negatively charged phosphate backbone of the DNA or RNA (38Tahirov T.H.

The structural changes of T7 RNA polymerase from transcription initiation to elongation.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2009; 19: 683Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As a result, increasing salt concentrations should destabilize both promoter DNA binding and product RNA rebinding. We have previously shown that covalently cross-linking an engineered cysteine (A94C) in the N-terminal domain of T7 RNA polymerase to a 3′ thiol-modified template DNA creates a locally high concentration of the promoter near its binding site, allowing promoter binding, even at high salt (42Esposito E.A.

Chem. 2004; 279: 44270-44276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Initiation proceeds well and at least some of these complexes transition to the stable elongation phase (42Esposito E.A. Martin C.T.

Chem. 2004; 279: 44270-44276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Elongation by T7 RNA polymerase is stabilized by the topological locking of the RNA around the template DNA in the enzyme active site (10Liu X. Martin C.T.

Chem. 2009; 284: 36262-36270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and elongation has been shown to be resistant to added salt concentrations up to at least 0.2 M NaCl (40Temiakov D.

Regulation of promoter selection by the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase in vitro.Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 4821-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). By tethering T7 RNA polymerase to its DNA promoter and carrying out transcription at elevated salt concentrations, we can achieve promoter-initiated transcription while preventing product RNA rebinding that otherwise would lead to cis primed extension activity. We expect this approach to reduce substantially the production of longer, double-stranded RNA impurities. In order to tether the polymerase to the promoter DNA and still allow functional initiation and substantial transition to elongation, we bound each, independently to Strep-TactinXT magnetic beads. The N-terminal domain of T7 RNA polymerase (together with a hairpin loop from the C-terminal domain) forms the promoter binding platform (44Cheetham G.M.T. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A.

Template supercoiling by a chimera of yeast GAL4 protein and phage T7 RNA polymerase.Science. 1990; 249: 1261-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, we fused the Strep-tag II peptide (WSHPQFEK), followed by a short and flexible peptide linker (GGS), to the N-terminus of recombinant T7 RNA polymerase (49Schmidt T.G. Skerra A. The Strep -tag system for one-step purification and high-affinity detection or capturing of proteins.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1528-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Herein, we will call this Strep-tagged variant Strep-T7 RNA polymerase. The Strep-tag II peptide has nanomolar binding affinity to specifically engineered Strep-TactinXT-coated magnetic beads (50Yeliseev A. Zoubak L. Schmidt T.G.M. Application of Strep-Tactin XT for affinity purification of Twin-Strep-tagged CB2, a G protein-coupled cannabinoid receptor.Protein Expr. Purif. 2017; 131: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We also used 5′-biotinylated nontemplate DNA to independently bind the promoter DNA to the Strep-TactinXT beads. Biotin is reported to have picomolar binding affinity to Strep-TactinXT-coated magnetic beads (50Yeliseev A. Zoubak L. Schmidt T.G.M. Application of Strep-Tactin XT for affinity purification of Twin-Strep-tagged CB2, a G protein-coupled cannabinoid receptor.Protein Expr. Purif. 2017; 131: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To confirm that the Strep-tag II peptide addition at the N-terminus of T7 RNA polymerase does not affect transcription activity, we performed in vitro transcription reactions using Strep-T7 RNA polymerase and promoter DNA (without a biotin tag) encoding a 24 base RNA (RNA-24) under high-yield transcription conditions. The gel analysis in Fig. S2 demonstrates identical transcription profiles using T7 RNA polymerase and Strep-T7 RNA polymerase. This confirms that the addition of the Strep-tag II peptide has no adverse effect on the activity of T7 RNA polymerase. Similarly, biotinylating the upstream end of the promoter has no effect on promoter function, as also shown in Fig. S2. Finally, we tested these constructs for transcription activity at 0.4 M added NaCl and, as expected for the uncoupled species, observed essentially complete inhibition of transcription in all constructs. Having demonstrated that the DNA and protein modifications do not perturb promoter binding and transcription, we proceeded to test the cotethered system for function. Given that at low salt the dissociation constant for duplex promoter binding by T7 RNA polymerase is ≈4 nM (9Újvári A. Martin C.T. Identification of a minimal binding element within the T7 RNA polymerase promoter.J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) we first preincubated the 5′-biotinylated nontemplate strand, template strand encoding a 24 base RNA and Strep-T7 RNA polymerase at final equimolar concentrations, as described in the Methods section. We then incubated the assembled promoter complex with tetrameric Strep-TactinXT-coated magnetic beads to form the tethered in vitro transcription system illustrated in Figure 1. While elevated salt concentrations weaken both promoter binding and RNA rebinding activities of T7 RNA polymerase, indirectly tethering the polymerase to the promoter (as demonstrated in Fig. 1) should restore promoter binding by increasing the local concentration of promoter DNA compared with free RNA in solution, as observed previously using a direct tethering approach (42Esposito E.A. Martin C.T. Cross-linking of promoter DNA to T7 RNA polymerase does not prevent formation of a stable elongation complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44270-44276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis with our tethered in vitro transcription system, we performed a comparative analysis of transcription between tethered and untethered systems as a function of increasing concentrations of added NaCl. In order to see the direct effect on cis primed extension activity, we selected a template strand that encodes a 24 base RNA (RNA-24) known to serve effectively in 3′ self-extension (24Gholamalipour Y. Mudiyanselage A.K. Martin C.T. 3’ end additions by T7 RNA polymerase are RNA self-templated, distributive and diverse in character-RNA-Seq analyses.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46: 9253-9263Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The gel analysis presented in Figure 2A shows that as added NaCl concentration is increased from 0 M to 0.4 M in 0.1 M intervals, all transcription activity decreases for the untethered system and is negligible at 0.4 M added NaCl. In the tethered system, promoter binding (and transcription) is relatively resistant to increasing concentrations of added salt, as expected. The data also confirm that product RNA rebinding to polymerase is inhibited, as there is a dramatic reduction in the formation of primer extension products. At 0.3 M added NaCl, most of the primer extension activity is inhibited, leading directly to an increase in the encoded RNA yield. At 0.4 M added NaCl, the overall yield is decreased somewhat relative to that at 0.3 M, but the purity of the encoded RNA is at its highest (and the concentration of the encoded RNA is substantially higher than in the untethered control). Overall, the tethered transcription system under high salt produces significantly improved purity and increased yield of the correct length product. Not all encoded RNAs participate in 3′ self-extension (24Gholamalipour Y. Mudiyanselage A.K. Martin C.T. 3’ end additions by T7 RNA polymerase are RNA self-templated, distributive and diverse in character-RNA-Seq analyses.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46: 9253-9263Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To confirm that the described tethering does not have an effect on the fundamental efficiency of promoter-directed transcription, we repeated the above comparative analysis with a template strand encoding another 24 base RNA (RNA-24Alt) that is known not to participate substantially in 3′ self-extension (24Gholamalipour Y. Mudiyanselage A.K. Martin C.T. 3’ end additions by T7 RNA polymerase are RNA self-templated, distributive and diverse in character-RNA-Seq analyses.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46: 9253-9263Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For the untethered system, gel analysis of the products presented in Figure 3A (and quantified in 3B) shows an overall loss of yield in RNA transcription with increasing added NaCl concentration, as expected (more subtly, there is an initial increase in 24 base RNA at 0.1 M added NaCl, which then decreases to barely detectable levels by 0.4 M added NaCl). In contrast, Figure 3, A and B show that the tethered system, while also initially showing an increase in the yield of 24 base RNA with increasing NaCl, continues to transcribe well up to at least 0.3 M added NaCl and produces more 24 base RNA at 0.4 M than at 0 M added NaCl. Close inspection of the gel lanes in Figure 3A suggests that the RNA-24Alt sequence is in fact producing primer extended products at 0 M added NaCl, as evidenced by a broad smear above the 24 base RNA band that decreases with increasing NaCl. Quantification of the extended products is shown in gray at 10× magnification in Figure 3B to better depict this observation. Thus, even for this construct, the intensity of the 24 base RNA band underestimates the total RNA produced. According to the model, inhibition of the primer extension that produces the broad smear would result in higher net amounts of the initially synthesized 24 base RNA, as observed. The results presented in Figures 2 and 3 use DNAs encoding 24 base RNAs with different sequences. To further test the generality of this system, we took the RNA-24 template sequence introduced in Figure 2 and inserted ten bases at position +8 to yield DNA that encodes a 34 base RNA (RNA-34), as shown in Fig. S1. Paralleling the experiment of Figure 2, we compare in Figure 4 untethered and tethered transcription of RNA-34 at low (0 M) and high salt (0.4 M) added NaCl concentrations. As predicted by the general model, the tethered in vitro transcription system produces primarily the encoded 34 base RNA at high salt. This result confirms that the system can be used for RNA of longer lengths to generate high yields of encoded RNA while preventing the formation of self-extended longer RNA impurities. To"

In vitro, sortases are used in sortase-mediated ligation (SML) reactions for a variety of protein engineering applications. Historically, sortase A from Staphylococcus aureus (saSrtA) has been the enzyme of choice to catalyze SML reactions. However, the stringent specificity of saSrtA for the LPXTG sequence motif limits its uses. Here, we describe the impact on substrate selectivity of a structurally conserved loop with a high degree of sequence variability in all classes of sortases. We investigate the contribution of this β7-β8 loop by designing and testing chimeric sortase enzymes. Our chimeras utilize natural sequence variation of class A sortases from eight species engineered into the SrtA sequence from Streptococcus pneumoniae. While some of these chimeric enzymes mimic the activity and selectivity of the WT protein from which the loop sequence was derived (e.g., that of saSrtA), others results in chimeric Streptococcus pneumoniae SrtA enzymes that are able to accommodate a range of residues in the final position of the substrate motif (LPXTX). Using mutagenesis, structural comparisons, and sequence analyses, we identify three interactions facilitated by β7-β8 loop residues that appear to be broadly conserved or converged upon in class A sortase enzymes. These studies provide the foundation for a deeper understanding of sortase target selectivity and can expand the sortase toolbox for future SML applications."

Numerous studies have shown that probiotics enable improving chemotherapy-induced intestinal mucositis, but the beneficial effects of probiotics differ depending on the strain. Therefore, in the present studies we suggest that S . thermophilus ST4 separated from raw milk may assess mucoprotective activity in 5-FU-induced intestinal mucositis. In our causal-comparative study design, fifteen mice were randomized assigned into three groups (n = 5/each group): control group, 5-FU group and 5-FU+ S . thermophilus ST4 group. The control group was orally administrated saline only, and the 5-FU group was followed by intraperitoneal injection of 5-FU for 3 days after 10-day saline administration, and the 5-FU+ S . thermophilus ST4 group was intragastrically subjected for S . thermophilus ST4 once per day during the whole experiment, starting from the first day of the experiment, followed by 5-FU intraperitoneal injection for 3 days after 10-day S . thermophilus ST4 pretreatment. Diarrhea score, pro-inflammatory cytokines serum levels, intestinal histopathology and short chain fatty acid were assessed. Here, we demonstrated the beneficial effects of S . thermophilus ST4 derived from raw milk against 5-FU-induced intestinal mucositis, including body weight reduction, appetite loss and diarrhea. Intrinsically, S . thermophilus ST4 effectively maintained epithelium structure in small intestines and colons as well as reduced the intestinal inflammation. Besides, S . thermophilus ST4 significantly increased the expression of acetic acid, reinforcing the muco-protective effects. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that S . thermophilus ST4 supplementation ameliorates 5-FU-induced intestinal mucositis. This suggests probiotic may serve as an alternative therapeutic strategy for the prevention or management of 5-FU-induced mucositis in the future."

Cultivation and plant management practices are known to influence the phytochemical compositions of agricultural produce. This study aimed to examine the influence of the cultivation practices on the antioxidant activities and secondary metabolites of the organically and conventionally grown P. quadrangularis. Findings revealed organically treated P. quadrangularis plants showed enhancement in their antioxidant properties and secondary metabolites profiles. Among the plant parts, leaves of P. quadrangularis grown organically possessed higher antioxidant activities compared to the conventional in all assays evaluated. The antioxidant activities in the edible parts of the P. quadrangularis fruit have also been enhanced through organic cultivation with significantly higher total phenolic content and DPPH in mesocarp, and the pulp showed higher total flavonoid content, DPPH and FRAP. This observation is supported by a higher level of vitamins and secondary metabolites in the samples. The secondary metabolites profile showed mesocarps were phenolic rich, the pulps were flavonoids rich while leaves showed good composition of phenolics, flavonoids and terpenoids with outstanding antioxidant activities. The common secondary metabolites for organically produced P. quadrangularis in different plant parts include 2-isopropyl-3-methoxycinnamic acid (mesocarp and pulp), myricetin isomers (pulp and leaves), and malvidin-3-O-arabinoside isomers (pulp and leaves).

https://openalex.org/W3183199297,"Iron and other transition metals, such as copper and manganese, are essential for supporting brain function, yet over-accumulation is cytotoxic. This over-accumulation of metals, particularly iron, is common to several neurological disorders; these include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Friedrich's ataxia and other disorders presenting with neurodegeneration and associated brain iron accumulation. The management of iron flux by the blood-brain barrier provides the first line of defense against the over-accumulation of iron in normal physiology and in these pathological conditions. In this study, we determined that the iron chelator PBT434, which is currently being developed for treatment of Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy, modulates the uptake of iron by human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMVEC) by chelation of extracellular Fe2+. Treatment of hBMVEC with PBT434 results in an increase in the abundance of the transcripts for transferrin receptor (TfR) and ceruloplasmin (Cp). Western blot and ELISA analyses reveal a corresponding increase in the proteins as well. Within the cell, PBT434 increases the detectable level of chelatable, labile Fe2+; data indicate that this Fe2+ is released from ferritin. In addition, PBT434 potentiates iron efflux likely due to the increase in cytosolic ferrous iron, the substrate for the iron exporter, ferroportin. PBT434 equilibrates rapidly and bi-directionally across an hBMVEC blood-brain barrier. These results indicate that the PBT434-iron complex is not substrate for hBMVEC uptake and thus support a model in which PBT434 would chelate interstitial iron and inhibit re-uptake of iron by endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier, as well as inhibit its uptake by the other cells of the neurovascular unit. Overall, this presents a novel and promising mechanism for therapeutic iron chelation."

Emphasizing its pivotal nature, autophagy dysfunction contributes to many diseases; nevertheless, development of effective autophagy modulating drugs is hampered by fundamental deficiencies in available methods for measuring autophagic activity or flux. To overcome these limitations, we introduced the photoconvertible protein Dendra2 into the MAP1LC3B locus of human cells via CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, enabling accurate and sensitive assessments of autophagy in living cells by optical pulse labeling. We used this assay to perform high-throughput drug screens of four chemical libraries comprising over 30,000 diverse compounds, identifying several clinically relevant drugs and novel autophagy modulators. A select series of candidate compounds also modulated autophagy flux in human motor neurons modified by CRISPR/Cas9 to express GFP-labeled LC3. Using automated microscopy, we tested the therapeutic potential of autophagy induction in several distinct neuronal models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In doing so, we found that autophagy induction exhibited discordant effects, improving survival in disease models involving the RNA binding protein TDP-43, while exacerbating toxicity in neurons expressing mutant forms of UBQLN2 and C9ORF72 associated with familial ALS/FTD. These studies confirm the utility of the Dendra2-LC3 assay, while illustrating the contradictory effects of autophagy induction in different ALS/FTD subtypes."

The isolates were from Algeria, isolated at the University Hospital Establishment of Oran, between 2011 and 2012. ESBL-KP isolates (n = 193) were screened for several antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) using qPCR followed by Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE). Representative isolates were selected from PFGE clusters and subjected to whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Genomic characterization of the WGS data by studying prophages, CRISPR-Cas systems, Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (MLST), serotype, ARGs, virulence genes, plasmid replicons, and their pMLST. Phylogenetic and comparative genomic were done using core genome MLST and SNP-Based analysis. Generally, the ESBL-KP isolates were polyclonal. The whole genome sequences of nineteen isolates were taken of main PFGE clusters. Sixteen sequence types (ST) were found including high-risk clones ST14, ST23, ST37, and ST147. Serotypes K1 (n = 1), K2 (n = 2), K3 (n = 1), K31 (n = 1), K62 (n = 1), and K151 (n = 1) are associated with hyper-virulence. CRISPR-Cas system was found in 47.4%, typed I-E and I-E*. About ARGs, from 193 ESBL-KP, the majority of strains were multidrug-resistant, the CTX-M-1 enzyme was predominant (99%) and the prevalence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes was high with aac(6')-lb-cr (72.5%) and qnr's (65.8%).

To evaluate the transferring effect of EVs to macrophage, the canine macrophage cell line, DH82, was treated with EVs after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Polarization changes of DH82 were evaluated with quantitative real-time PCR and immunofluorescence analyses. When LPS-induced DH82 was treated with EVDFO, phosphorylation of signal transducer and transcription3 (p-STAT3), which is one of key factor of inducing M2 phase, expression was increased in DH82. Furthermore, treated with EVDFO in LPS-induced DH82, the expression of M1 markers were reduced, otherwise, M2 surface markers were enhanced. Comparing with EVDFO and EVnon.DFO preconditioning in MSCs activated the HIF-1α/COX-2 signaling pathway; Transferring COX-2 through EVDFO could effectively reprogram macrophage into M2 phase by promoting the phosphorylation of STAT3."
https://openalex.org/W3185145551,"Coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) has brought great disasters to humanity, and its influence continues to intensify. In response to the public health emergencies, prompt relief supplies are key to reduce the damage. This paper presents a method of emergency medical logistics to quick response to emergency epidemics. The methodology includes two recursive mechanisms: (1) the time-varying forecasting of medical relief demand according to a modified susceptible-exposed-infected- Asymptomatic- recovered (SEIAR) epidemic diffusion model, (2) the relief supplies distribution based on a multi-objective dynamic stochastic programming model. Specially, the distribution model addresses a hypothetical network of emergency medical logistics with considering emergency medical reserve centers (EMRCs), epidemic areas and e-commerce warehousing centers as the rescue points. Numerical studies are conducted. The results show that with the cooperation of different epidemic areas and e-commerce warehousing centers, the total cost is 6% lower than without considering cooperation of different epidemic areas, and 9.7% lower than without considering cooperation of e-commerce warehousing centers. Particularly, the total cost is 20% lower than without considering any cooperation. This study demonstrates the importance of cooperation in epidemic prevention, and provides the government with a new idea of emergency relief supplies dispatching, that the rescue efficiency can be improved by mutual rescue between epidemic areas in public health emergency."
https://openalex.org/W3186836045,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 that causes COVID-19 has resulted in the death of more than 2.5 million people, but no cure exists. Although passive immunization with COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) provides a safe and viable therapeutic option, the selection of optimal units for therapy in a timely fashion remains a barrier.Since virus neutralization is a necessary characteristic of plasma that can benefit recipients, the neutralizing titers of plasma samples were measured using a retroviral-pseudotype assay. Binding antibody titers to the spike (S) protein were also determined by a clinically available serological assay (Ortho-Vitros total IG), and an in-house ELISA. The results of these assays were compared to a measurement of antibodies directed to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV2 S protein (Promega Lumit Dx).All measures of antibodies were highly variable, but correlated, to different degrees, with each other. However, the anti-RBD antibodies correlated with viral neutralizing titers to a greater extent than the other antibody assays.Our observations support the use of an anti-RBD assay such as the Lumit Dx assay, as an optimal predictor of the neutralization capability of CCP."

The flexible and quantitative nature of single-molecule imaging technology renders it optimal for development of new diagnostic tools. Here we present a proof-of-concept for a single-molecule based, enzyme-free assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2. The unified platform we developed allows direct detection of the viral genetic material from patients’ samples, as well as their immune response consisting of IgG and IgM antibodies. Thus, it establishes a platform for diagnostics of COVID-19, which could also be adjusted to diagnose additional pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W3184722199,"Arthroplasty procedures are commonly performed and contribute to healthcare expenditures seen in the United States. Surgical team members may make selections among implants and materials without always knowing their relative cost. The current study reports on a survey aimed to investigate the perceptions of an academic group about the relative cost and value of commonly used operating room implants and materials related to joint arthroplasty cases using 10 matched pairs of items. Of the 124 persons eligible to take the survey, 102 responded (response rate of 82.3%) including attendings, fellows, residents, physician assistants (PAs), advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) and registered nurses (RNs). On average for the ten pairs of items, the more expensive items were correctly selected by 90.2+/-13.9% (mean+/- standard deviation) of respondents with a range from 54.9% to 100%. Of note, the cost differences were significantly overestimated for 8/10 item pairs. The majority of respondents perceived the more expensive item as the item with the higher clinical value for 9/10 item pairs. Most arthroplasty attendings (91.3%) indicated willingness to use the less expensive item of two similar items. Nonetheless, 17.9% of fellows, residents, PAs, APRNs and RNs indicated that they would not feel comfortable suggesting using the less expensive item. Although attending arthroplasty surgeons stated a desire to consider costs, a knowledge deficit with regards to identifying the extent of cost differences was identified, and a significant portion of the surgical support team reported being hesitant to suggest less expensive options."
https://openalex.org/W3185390186,"Porphyromonas gingivalis, a gram-negative anaerobic bacterium, is associated with the development of periodontal disease. The genetic diversity in virulence factors, such as adhesive fimbriae, among its strains affects the bacterial pathogenicity. P. gingivalis generally expresses two distinct types of fimbriae, FimA and Mfa1. Although the genetic diversity of fimA, encoding the major FimA fimbrilin protein, has been characterized, the genes encoding the Mfa1 fimbrial components, including the Mfa1 to Mfa5 proteins, have not been fully studied. We, therefore, analyzed their genotypes in 12 uncharacterized and 62 known strains of P. gingivalis (74 strains in total). The mfa1 genotype was primarily classified into two genotypes, 53 and 70. Additionally, we found that genotype 70 could be further divided into two subtypes (70A and 70B). The diversity of mfa2 to mfa4 was consistent with the mfa1 genotype, although no subtype in genotype 70 was observed. Protein structure modeling showed high homology between the genotypes in Mfa1 to Mfa4. The mfa5 gene was classified into five genotypes (A to E) independent of other genotypes. Moreover, genotype A was further divided into two subtypes (A1 and A2). Surprisingly, some strains had two mfa5 genes, and the 2nd mfa5 exclusively occurred in genotype E. The Mfa5 protein in all genotypes showed a homologous C-terminal half, including the conserved C-terminal domain recognized by the type IX secretion system. Furthermore, the von Willebrand factor domain at the N-terminal was detected only in genotypes A to C. The mfa1 genotypes partially correlated with the ragA and ragB genotypes (located immediately downstream of the mfa gene cluster) but not with the fimA genotypes."
https://openalex.org/W3185609550,"Dynamically squeezing the left hand (left hand dynamic handgrip) has been shown to be effective in preventing choking under pressure in right-handers in a variety of sports. The current study assessed the effectiveness of the left hand dynamic handgrip in preventing a loss of accuracy of tennis serves in competitive situations. Twenty right-handed highly skilled junior athletes performed eight tennis serves at a target without pressure (pre-test), followed by eight serves under pressure (post-test). Ten of the participants conducted the left hand dynamic handgrip prior to the post-test, while the other ten performed an equivalent handgrip with their right hand. The serving accuracy of the group performing the handgrip with their right hand decreased significantly from pre- to post-test, while the accuracy of the left hand dynamic handgrip group remained stable. The results indicate the left hand dynamic handgrip to be effective in preventing reduced accuracy of the tennis serve in competition situations as a form of choking under pressure. This technique could easily be integrated into tennis players' serving routines and promote stable match performance in competitions."
https://openalex.org/W3186426256,"Heat stress accounts for substantial economic loss in the poultry industry by altering the health and performance of chickens. Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is a water and fat-soluble antioxidant which is readily absorbed from the intestine resulting in maximum bioavailability. Moreover, ALA acts as a coenzyme in glucose metabolism and helps generate other antioxidants. Considering these benefits, we hypothesized that dietary supplementation of ALA would help mitigate heat stress in poultry. A total of 72 Day-old broiler chicks were randomly assigned into three treatment groups: no heat stress (NHS), heat stress with basal diet (HS), and heat stress with alpha-lipoic acid (HS+ALA); each treatment group had 6 replicate pens with 4 birds in each pen (n = 24/group). The allocated birds were raised under standard husbandry practices for 3 weeks. After 21 d, birds in the HS and HS+ALA groups were exposed to heat stress (33°C for 8 hours during the day) for 3 weeks, while the NHS group was reared under normal conditions (22–24°C). The HS+ALA group received a basal finisher diet fortified with ALA (500 mg/kg) during the treatment period (22 to 42 d), while other birds were provided with the basal finisher diet. Weekly body weight and feed intake were recorded. The cecum digesta for volatile fatty acids (VFAs) analysis and 16S rRNA sequencing for the gut microbiota analysis; and the ileum tissue samples for histological and gene expression analyses were collected on d 42. Exposure to heat stress decreased (P&lt;0.05) average daily gain (ADG) and final body weight (FBW) in the HS group compared to the NHS group, the supplementation of ALA improved (P&lt;0.05) ADG and FBW in heat-stressed birds. Furthermore, birds in the HS+ALA group had increased (P&lt;0.05) expression of HSP90 , PRDX1 , GPX3 , SOD2 , OCLN , and MUC2 genes and higher (P&lt;0.05) concentrations of major VFAs (acetate, propionate, and butyrate). The dietary ALA supplementation also improved the villus height and villus height to crypt depth ratio in the HS+ALA group. The microbial diversity analysis revealed significant abundance (P&lt;0.05) of beneficial bacteria Lactobacillus and Peptostreptococcaceae in the cecum of the ALA group. These results indicate that dietary ALA supplementation effectively mitigates the negative effects of heat stress in broilers by improving the expression of heat-shock, tight-junction, antioxidants, and immune-related genes in the intestine, improving villus structures, increasing concentration of major VFAs, and enriching the beneficial microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W3186955607,"Objectives The objective of this paper is to study under which circumstances wearable and health app users would accept a compensation payment, namely a digital dividend, to share their self-tracked health data. Methods We conducted a discrete choice experiment alternative, a separated adaptive dual response. We chose this approach to reduce extreme response behavior, considering the emotionally-charged topic of health data sales, and to measure willingness to accept. Previous experiments in lab settings led to demands for high monetary compensation. After a first online survey and two pre-studies, we validated four attributes for the final online study: monthly bonus payment, stakeholder handling the data (e.g., health insurer, pharmaceutical or medical device companies, universities), type of data, and data sales to third parties. We used a random utility framework to evaluate individual choice preferences. To test the expected prices of the main study for robustness, we assigned respondents randomly to one of two identical questionnaires with varying price ranges. Results Over a period of three weeks, 842 respondents participated in the main survey, and 272 respondents participated in the second survey. The participants considered transparency about data processing and no further data sales to third parties as very important to the decision to share data with different stakeholders, as well as adequate monetary compensation. Price expectations resulting from the experiment were high; pharmaceutical and medical device companies would have to pay an average digital dividend of 237.30€/month for patient generated health data of all types. We also observed an anchor effect, which means that people formed price expectations during the process and not ex ante. We found a bimodal distribution between relatively low price expectations and relatively high price expectations, which shows that personal data selling is a divisive societal issue. However, the results indicate that a digital dividend could be an accepted economic incentive system to gather large-scale, self-tracked data for research and development purposes. After the COVID-19 crisis, price expectations might change due to public sensitization to the need for big data research on patient generated health data. Conclusion A continuing success of existing data donation models is highly unlikely. The health care sector needs to develop transparency and trust in data processing. An adequate digital dividend could be an effective long-term measure to convince a diverse and large group of people to share high-quality, continuous data for research purposes."
https://openalex.org/W3183274140,"Background Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is an important determinant of ovarian reserve in fertility workups in many clinical settings. Thus, we investigated the age dependent decline in AMH specific to the Egyptian population and sought to establish an age dependent reference interval parametrically. Methods Serum samples were collected from 841 apparently healthy women. AMH was measured using an electro-chemiluminescent technique. Box-Cox power transformation was used to make the AMH distribution Gaussian for parametric derivation of reference intervals. Results Power of 0.4 was found optimal for Gaussian transformation of AMH reference values. We demonstrate the strong negative relation between circulating AMH and female age with Spearman’s correlation coefficient of r S = −0.528. Age-specific reference interval was determined for every 5 years of age from 16 to 49, and nomogram was constructed by smoothing the lines connecting adjacent lower and upper reference limits. Conclusion The age-specific reference intervals and the age-AMH nomogram could be valuable in the clinical practice of in reproductive medicine. To our knowledge, this is the first study to confirm AMH levels in Egyptian females. We were able to explore age-related AMH levels specific to Egyptian females in the fertile age group and to treat skewed AMH data in a multi-step scheme using power transformation. Thus, a more accurate nomogram was constructed accommodating a profile delineated for a wide age range and a rescaled AMH axis improving its usability."
https://openalex.org/W3183493659,"Gum arabic (GA) is widely used as an emulsion stabilizer and coating in several industrial applications, such as foods and pharmaceuticals. GA contains a complex carbohydrate moiety, and the nonreducing ends of the side chains are often capped with l-rhamnose; thus, enzymes that can remove these caps are promising tools for the structural analysis of the carbohydrates comprising GA. In this study, GA-specific l-rhamnose-α-1,4-d-glucuronate lyase from the fungus Fusarium oxysporum 12S (FoRham1) was cloned and characterized. FoRham1 showed the highest amino acid sequence similarity with enzymes belonging to the glycoside hydrolase family 145; however, the catalytic residue on the posterior pocket of the β-propeller fold protein was not conserved. The catalytic residues of FoRham1 were instead conserved with ulvan lyases belonging to polysaccharide lyase family 24. Kinetic analysis showed that FoRham1 has the highest catalytic efficiency for the substrate α-l-rhamnose-(1→4)-d-glucuronic acid. The crystal structures of ligand-free and α-l-rhamnose-(1→4)-d-glucuronic acid -bound FoRham1 were determined, and the active site was identified on the anterior side of the β-propeller. The three-dimensional structure of the active site and mutagenesis analysis revealed the detailed catalytic mechanism of FoRham1. Our findings offer a new enzymatic tool for the further analysis of the GA carbohydrate structure and for elucidating its physiological functions in plants. Based on these results, we renamed glycoside hydrolase family 145 as a new polysaccharide lyase family 42, in which FoRham1 is included."
https://openalex.org/W3183591069,"Ceramic analysis has been concerned with categorizing types according to vessel shape and size for describing a given material culture at a particular time. This analysis' long tradition has enabled archaeologists to define cultural units across time. However, going into the analysis of sub-typological variations is rarely done, although their meanings bear significant consequences on the understanding of ties between individuals and social units. This study, aiming to assess whether it is possible to identify social signatures, focuses on a single archaeological ceramic type. For this propose, we selected a corpus of 235 storage jars from two distinct periods: storage jars from the Intermediate Bronze Age (the 25th -20th century BCE); and the Oval Storage Jar type (hereafter: OSJ) from the Iron Age II (the late 9th-early 6th century BCE). The vessels selected were 3-D scanned to extract accurate geometric parameters and analyzed through an advanced shape analysis. The study results show that integrating computational and objective analysis methods, focusing on the ""minute variation"" within a single ceramic type, yields substantial insights regarding the relationship between variability and social units. In addition to the methodological guidelines and the suggested ""work protocol"" for further studies, the results shed light on the social organization of the Intermediate Bronze Age and the Iron Age II in Southern Levant."
https://openalex.org/W3184137080,"Detection of tuberculosis at the point-of-care (POC) is limited by the low sensitivity of current commercially available tests. We describe a diagnostic accuracy field evaluation of a prototype urine Tuberculosis Lipoarabinomannan Lateral Flow Assay (TB-LAM LFA) in both HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients using fresh samples with sensitivity and specificity as the measures of accuracy. This prototype combines a proprietary concentration system with a sensitive LFA. In a prospective study of 292 patients with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis in Uganda, the clinical sensitivity and specificity was compared against a microbiological reference standard including sputum Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra and solid and liquid culture. TB-LAM LFA had an overall sensitivity of 60% (95%CI 51-69%) and specificity of 80% (95%CI 73-85%). When comparing HIV-positive (N = 86) and HIV-negative (N = 206) patients, there was no significant difference in sensitivity (sensitivity difference 8%, 95%CI -11% to +24%, p = 0.4351) or specificity (specificity difference -9%, 95%CI -24% to +4%, p = 0.2051). Compared to the commercially available Alere Determine TB-LAM Ag test, the TB-LAM LFA prototype had improved sensitivity in both HIV-negative (difference 49%, 95%CI 37% to 59%, p<0.0001) and HIV-positive patients with CD4+ T-cell counts >200cells/μL (difference 59%, 95%CI 32% to 75%, p = 0.0009). This report is the first to show improved performance of a urine TB LAM test for HIV-negative patients in a high TB burden setting. We also offer potential assay refinement solutions that may further improve sensitivity and specificity."
https://openalex.org/W3185869656,"Detection of hoof-on and -off events are essential to gait classification in horses. Wearable sensors have been endorsed as a convenient alternative to the traditional force plate-based method. The aim of this study was to propose and validate inertial sensor-based methods of gait event detection, reviewing different sensor locations and their performance on different gaits and exercise surfaces. Eleven horses of various breeds and ages were recruited to wear inertial sensors attached to the hooves, pasterns and cannons. Gait events detected by pastern and cannon methods were compared to the reference, hoof-detected events. Walk and trot strides were recorded on asphalt, grass and sand. Pastern-based methods were found to be the most accurate and precise for detecting gait events, incurring mean errors of between 1 and 6ms, depending on the limb and gait, on asphalt. These methods incurred consistent errors when used to measure stance durations on all surfaces, with mean errors of 0.1 to 1.16% of a stride cycle. In conclusion, the methods developed and validated here will enable future studies to reliably detect equine gait events using inertial sensors, under a wide variety of field conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3186460160,"Schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease caused by trematodes of the Schistosoma genus, affects over 250 million people around the world. This disease has been associated with learning and memory deficits in children, whereas reduced attention levels, impaired work capacity, and cognitive deficits have been observed in adults. Strongly correlated with poverty and lack of basic sanitary conditions, this chronic endemic infection is common in Africa, South America, and parts of Asia and contributes to inhibition of social development and low quality of life in affected areas. Nonetheless, studies on the mechanisms involved in the neurological impairment caused by schistosomiasis are scarce. Here, we used a murine model of infection with Schistosoma mansoni in which parasites do not invade the central nervous system to evaluate the consequences of systemic infection on neurologic function. We observed that systemic infection with S. mansoni led to astrocyte and microglia activation, expression of oxidative stress-induced transcription factor Nrf2, oxidative damage, Tau phosphorylation, and amyloid-β peptide accumulation in the prefrontal cortex of infected animals. We also found impairment in spatial learning and memory as evaluated by the Morris water maze task. Administration of anthelmintic (praziquantel) and antioxidant (N-acetylcysteine plus deferoxamine) treatments was effective in inhibiting most of these phenotypes, and the combination of both treatments had a synergistic effect to prevent such changes. These data demonstrate new perspectives toward the understanding of the pathology and possible therapeutic approaches to counteract long-term effects of systemic schistosomiasis on brain function."
https://openalex.org/W3183623192,"DNA gyrase is a type II topoisomerase that is responsible for maintaining the topological state of bacterial and some archaeal genomes. It uses an ATP-dependent two-gate strand-passage mechanism that is shared among all type II topoisomerases. During this process, DNA gyrase creates a transient break in the DNA, the G-segment, to form a cleavage complex. This allows a second DNA duplex, known as the T-segment, to pass through the broken G-segment. After the broken strand is religated, the T-segment is able to exit out of the enzyme through a gate called the C-gate. Although many steps of the type II topoisomerase mechanism have been studied extensively, many questions remain about how the T-segment ultimately exits out of the C-gate. A recent cryo-EM structure of Streptococcus pneumoniae GyrA shows a putative T-segment in close proximity to the C-gate, suggesting that residues in this region may be important for coordinating DNA exit from the enzyme. Here, we show through site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical characterization that three conserved basic residues in the C-gate of DNA gyrase are important for DNA supercoiling activity, but not for ATPase or cleavage activity. Together with the structural information previously published, our data suggest a model in which these residues cluster to form a positively charged region that facilitates T-segment passage into the cavity formed between the DNA gate and C-gate."
https://openalex.org/W3184260204,"White adipose tissue (WAT) has the capacity to undergo a white-to-beige phenotypic switch, known as browning, in response to stimuli such as cold. However, the mechanism underlying beige adipocyte formation is largely unknown. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is highly induced in WAT and has been implicated in lipid metabolism. Here, we show that ApoE deficiency in mice increased oxygen consumption and thermogenesis and enhanced adipose browning pattern in inguinal WAT (iWAT), with associated characteristics such as increased Ucp1 and Pparγ expression. At the cellular level, ApoE deficient beige adipocytes had increased glucose uptake and higher mitochondrial respiration than wild-type cells. Mechanistically, we showed that ApoE deficient iWAT and primary adipose precursor cells activated the thermogenic genes program by stimulating the production of ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB), a novel adipose browning promoting factor. This was accompanied by increased expression of genes involved in ketogenesis and could be compromised by the treatment for ketogenesis inhibitors. Consistently, ApoE deficient mice show higher serum βHB level than wild-type mice in the fed state and during cold exposure. Our results further demonstrate that the increased βHB production in ApoE deficient adipose precursor cells could be attributed, at least in part, to enhanced Cd36 expression and CD36-mediated fatty acid utilization. Our findings uncover a previously uncharacterized role for ApoE in energy homeostasis via its cell-autonomous action in WAT."

However, the pathophysiology and relationship between thyroidectomy and LPR have not been well investigated. We aimed to evaluate the correlation between thyroidectomy and LPR by assessing changes in LPR-related symptoms and laryngoscopic findings before and after thyroidectomy. Ninety-five patients who underwent thyroidectomy with or without central neck dissection were included. The reflux finding score (RFS) and reflux symptom index (RSI) were investigated one day before surgery and two, four, six, and twelve months after surgery. The RFS scores increased significantly after thyroidectomy and decreased to the preoperative level 12 months after surgery. The RSI scores increased after surgery and decreased gradually by 12 months postoperatively, although it was not statistically significant. The RSI and RFS scores improved with the administration of proton pump inhibitors. In conclusion, LPR-related laryngoscopic findings were exacerbated after uncomplicated thyroidectomy. Further studies using pH-monitoring and esophageal manometry are required to investigate the possible deterioration of LPR itself and the UES pressure after thyroidectomy."
https://openalex.org/W3185605529,"The destruction of freshwater habitat is a major contributor to biodiversity loss in aquatic ecosystems. However, created or restored wetlands could partially mitigate aquatic biodiversity loss by increasing the amount of available habitat across a landscape. We investigated the impact of surrounding terrestrial habitat and water quality variables on suitability for two species of pond-breeding amphibians (bullfrogs [Lithobates catesbeianus] and Blanchard's cricket frogs [Acris blanchardi]) in created permanent wetlands located on an agricultural landscape. We examined tadpole growth and survival in field enclosures placed in ponds surrounded by agricultural, forested, or grassland habitats. We also evaluated the potential for carryover effects of the aquatic environment on terrestrial growth and overwinter survival of cricket frog metamorphs. We found that habitat adjacent to ponds did not predict tadpole growth or survival. Rather, phytoplankton abundance, which showed high variability among ponds within habitat type, was the only predictor of tadpole growth. Cricket frogs emerged larger and earlier from ponds with higher phytoplankton abundance; bullfrogs were also larger and at a more advanced developmental stage in ponds with higher levels of phytoplankton. Overwinter survival of cricket frogs was explained by size at metamorphosis and there were no apparent carryover effects of land use or pond-of-origin on overwinter growth and survival. Our results demonstrate that created ponds in human-dominated landscapes can provide suitable habitat for some anurans, independent of the adjacent terrestrial habitat."

This requires time integration of oxidation currents at certain intervals. Unfortunately, the selection of integration intervals relies on ad-hoc visual identification of peaks on the oxidation currents, which introduces sources of error and precludes the development of automated procedures necessary for analysis and quantification of neurotransmitter levels in large data sets. In an effort to improve charge quantification techniques, here we present novel methods for automatic selection of integration boundaries. Our results show that these methods allow quantification of oxidation reactions both in vitro and in vivo and of multiple analytes in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W3186956733,"Past investigations utilizing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have demonstrated that cocaine use disorder (CUD) yields white matter changes, primarily in the corpus callosum. By applying Bayesian model averaging using multiple linear regression in DTI, we demonstrate there may exist relationships between the impaired white matter and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) polymorphisms. This work explored the two-way and three-way interactions between GAD1a (SNP: rs1978340) and GAD1b (SNP: rs769390) polymorphisms and years of cocaine use (YCU). GAD1a was associated with more frontal white matter changes on its own but GAD1b was associated with more midbrain and cerebellar changes as well as a greater increase in white matter changes in the context of chronic cocaine use. The three-way interaction GAD1a|GAD1b|YCU appeared to be roughly an average of the polymorphism two-way interactions GAD1a|YCU and GAD1b|YCU. The three-way interaction demonstrated multiple regions including corpus callosum which featured fewer significant voxel changes, perhaps suggesting a small protective effect of having both polymorphisms on corpus callosum and cerebellar peduncle."
https://openalex.org/W3176121281,"The Ruminative Thought Style Questionnaire (RTSQ) is a self-report measure that aims to capture rumination globally, unbiased by depressive symptoms. We explored its psychometric properties among university students (N = 1123), as the existing models about the factor structure of the RTSQ have been inconclusive. In a second study (N = 320) we tested its convergent validity compared to the Ruminative Response Scale (RRS) and its construct validity compared to the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (ZSDS). The results of Study 1 suggest that the factor structure of the RTSQ is best described with a 19-item bifactor Exploratory Structural Equation Modelling (ESEM), where most of the variance is explained by the general factor. The model was found to be invariant across genders. The correlations in Study 2 demonstrated that the RTSQ is congruent with the RRS, and that rumination captured by the RTSQ is rather maladaptive, as it was more strongly associated with the brooding subscale of the RRS than with reflective pondering. Significant positive associations were found with depressive symptoms, reaffirming the validity of the RTSQ due to the well-known association between rumination and depressive symptoms. Our results support that RTSQ assesses rumination globally, and it is a valid measure of ruminative thinking style that is rather negatively valenced but does not solely focus on depressive mood and symptoms."

As a result, three isolates were selected and their production of the B2 and B9 were confirmed by HPLC. The three isolates were identified on species level by sequencing their 16S rRNA gene which showed 100% identical to strains of Pediococcus acidilactici. Thus, they were named as P. acidilactici WNYM01, P. acidilactici WNYM02, P. acidilactici WNYM03 and submitted to the Genbank database with accession numbers. They met the probiotic criteria by expressing 90-95% survival rate at pH (2.0-9.0) and bile salt up to 2% for 3 h in addition to their antimicrobial activity against gram positive and negative microorganisms. They also showed no hemolytic activity and common pattern for antibiotic susceptibility. Our three strains were tested individually or in mixture in vivo on rat colitis model compared to ulcerative group. The strains were administrated orally to rats in daily dose containing CFU 109 for 14 days then followed by induction of colitis using acetic acid then the oral administration was continued for more four days. The histology results, the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress biomarkers showed the protective role of the strains compared to the ulcerative group. As a conclusion, we introduce novel three probiotic candidates for pharmaceutical preparations and health applications."

The Fitness-Complexity Algorithm offers a scientific approach to predicting GDP and obtains fruitful results. As a recursion algorithm, the non-linear iteration processes give novel insights into product complexity and country fitness without noise data. However, the Country-Product Matrix and Revealed Comparative Advantage data have abnormal noises which contradict the relative stability of product diversity and the transformation of global production. The data noise entering the iteration algorithm, combined with positively related Fitness and Complexity, will be amplified in each recursion step. We introduce the Shortest Duration Constrained Hidden Markov Model (SDC-HMM) to denoise the Country-Product Matrix for the first time. After the country-product matrix test, the country case test, the noise estimation test and the panel regression test of national economic fitness indicators to predict GDP growth, we show that the SDC-HMM could reduce abnormal noise by about 25% and identify change points. This article provides intra-sample predictions that theoretically confirm that the SDC-HMM can improve the effectiveness of economic fitness indicators in interpreting economic growth."
https://openalex.org/W3186118705,"The (pro)renin receptor [(P)RR] binds to renin and its precursor prorenin to activate the tissue renin-angiotensin system. It is cleaved to generate soluble (P)RR and M8-9, a residual hydrophobic truncated protein. The (pro)renin receptor also functions as an intracellular accessory protein of vacuolar-type H+-ATPase, which plays an essential role in controlling the intracellular vesicular acid environment. Thus, in the kidney, (P)RR may play a role in transporting H+ to urine in the collecting duct. Although blood soluble (P)RR has been recognized as a biomarker reflecting the status of the tissue renin-angiotensin system and/or tissue (P)RR, the significance of urinary soluble (P)RR excretion has not been determined. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the characteristics of urinary soluble (P)RR excretion. Urinary soluble (P)RR excretion was measured, and its association with background factors was investigated in 441 patients. Relationships between changes in urine pH due to vitamin C treatment, which reduce urine pH, and urinary soluble (P)RR excretion were investigated in 10 healthy volunteers. Urinary soluble (P)RR excretion was 1.46 (0.44-2.92) ng/gCre. Urine pH showed a significantly positive association with urinary soluble (P)RR excretion, independent of other factors. Changes in urine pH and urinary soluble (P)RR excretion due to vitamin C treatment were significantly and positively correlated (ρ = 0.8182, p = 0.0038). These data showed an association between urinary soluble (P)RR excretion and urine pH in humans, suggesting that (P)RR in the kidney might play a role in urine pH regulation."
