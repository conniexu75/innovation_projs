https://openalex.org/W1982700980,"Prolonged suppression of cambial growth has apparently caused a decline in radial growth in many mature red spruce, Picea rubens. Surveys indicate that this decline occurs in trees throughout the natural range of red spruce and is independent of elevation, tree size, and age class. In addition, crowns of mature red spruce at high elevations across the northeastern United States have been dying back. Understanding the physiological basis for the growth decline is essential for the judicious management of the red spruce resource. A sequence of events is inferred through which an imbalance of aluminum and calcium in the fine root environment reduces the rate of wood formation, decreases the amount of functional sapwood and live crown, and leaves large trees more vulnerable to extant secondary diseases and insect pests."
https://openalex.org/W2057814327,"The sampling of rare and elusive populations is difficult because the costs of locating such populations are substantial and can exceed actual interviewing costs. There are efficient probability methods that have been developed recently that reduce these costs. If the special populations are geographically clustered, efficient sampling involves the rapid location of segments in which no members of the special population are located with the use of Census data, telephone screening, or incomplete lists. Populations that are not geographicaily clustered can be located by network sampling and use of large previously gathered samples. Characteristics of mobile populations such as the homeless can be estimated by capture-recapture methods."
https://openalex.org/W2018198967,"Slowly changing boundary conditions can sometimes cause discontinuous responses in climate models and result in relatively rapid transitions between different climate states. Such terrestrially induced abrupt climate transitions could have contributed to biotic crises in earth history. Ancillary events associated with transitions could disperse unstable climate behavior over a longer but still geologically brief interval and account for the stepwise nature of some extinction events. There is a growing body of theoretical and empirical support for the concept of abrupt climate change, and a comparison of paleoclimate data with the Phanerozoic extinction record indicates that climate and biotic transitions often coincide. However, more stratigraphic information is needed to precisely assess phase relations between the two types of transitions. The climate-life comparison also suggests that, if climate change is significantly contributing to biotic turnover, ecosystems may be more sensitive to forcing during the early stages of evolution from an ice-free to a glaciated state. Our analysis suggests that a terrestrially induced climate instability is a viable mechanism for causing rapid environmental change and biotic turnover in earth history, but the relation is not so strong that other sources of variance can be excluded."
https://openalex.org/W2070907297,"The reactions of dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5) with H2O and hydrochloric acid (HCl) were studied on ice surfaces in a Knudsen cell flow reactor. The N2O5 reacted on ice at 185 K to form condensed-phase nitric acid (HNO3). This reaction may provide a sink for odd nitrogen (NOx) during the polar winter, a requirement in nearly all models of Antarctic ozone depletion. A lower limit to the sticking coefficient, γ, for N2O5 on ice is 1 × 10-3. Moreover, N2O5 reacted on HCl-ice surfaces at 185 K, with γ greater than 3 × 10-3. This reaction, which produced gaseous nitryl chloride (ClNO2) and condensed-phase HNO3, proceeded until all of the HCl within the ice was depleted. The ClNO2, which did not react or condense on ice at 185 K, can be readily photolyzed in the Antarctic spring to form atomic chlorine for catalytic ozone destruction cycles. The other photolysis product, gaseous nitrogen dioxide (NO2), may be important in the partitioning of NOx between gaseous and condensed phases in the Antarctic winter."
https://openalex.org/W1973492244,"Hybrid zones involving Pseudophryne (Anura: Leptodactylidae) provide direct evidence for the operation of postmating reproductive isolating mechanisms in animals in a natural situation. Significant introgression is prevented by hybrid inviability but there is no evidence for the reinforcement of premating isolating mechanisms. These parapatric hybrid zones are of unknown etiology, but are interpreted as being relatively old and persistent."

https://openalex.org/W2078186376,"Radar images at a 12.5-centimeter wavelength made with the Goldstone radar interferometer in 1980 and 1986, together with lunar radar images and recent Venera 15 and 16 data, indicate that material on the surface and subsurface of Venus has a Fresnel reflectivity in excess of 50 percent. Such high reflectivities have been reported on the surface in mountainous regions. Material of high reflectivity may also underlie lower reflectivity surficial materials of the plains regions, where it has been excavated by impact cratering in some areas."
https://openalex.org/W2001464509,"Ideas about the origin of sedentism and agriculture have been changing in recent years, with a greater emphasis on examining the details of sites case by case. Some new evidence seems to indicate that there was no simple transition or rapid revolution from nomadic subsistence to agriculture and sedentism in the Neolithic. Evidence described from Abu Hureyra, Catal Huyuk, and 'Ain Ghazal suggests that these settlements were not simply either hunting and gathering or farming. In addition, there was probably not a uniform shift at these sites from simple, egalitarian farming villages to large culturally sophisticated settlements. New information supporting these conclusions is given. A discussion is provided concerning whether or not a single factor caused the development of agriculture (which emerged virtually simultaneously throughout the world). Population pressure and climatic change are described as two possible causes. Other workers suggest that evidence from local sites (such as from Abu Hureyra) do not fit these type of general causal models."
