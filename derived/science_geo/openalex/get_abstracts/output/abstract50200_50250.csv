https://openalex.org/W2137128469,"Extensive variations exist in the heavy and light chain components of myosin in vertebrate striated muscles. In the present study, we have characterized a specific contractile property, velocity of shortening, and protein subunit composition of single fibers from adult rabbit soleus muscles. Maximum velocity of shortening (Vmax) was measured using the slack test method, and the myosin composition of these same fibers was determined using an ultrasensitive sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis system. While most fibers were found to have velocities between 0.5 and 1.0 muscle length/s, several had velocities distributed between 1.33 and 2.99 muscle length/s. The fibers in the slower group had myosin subunits that were solely of the slow type; however, those in the faster group contained both fast and slow heavy chains and light chains. The velocity of shortening measured in fibers having both myosin types was highly correlated with the myosin heavy chain composition, with velocity increasing as the proportion of fast-type heavy chain increased. Variations in light chain composition, particularly fast and slow myosin light chain 1, appeared to occur independently of the variations in heavy chain composition, suggesting that some myosin molecules consist of mixtures of slow- and fast-type subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1544140936,"Two forms of cytochrome P-450 were purified to apparent homogeneity from several different preparations of human liver microsomes. One form, designated P-450DB, had relatively high catalytic activity towards the drugs debrisoquine, sparteine, bufuralol (both the (+)- and (-)-isomers), encainide, and propranolol and appears to be the enzyme involved in the polymorphic distribution of oxidative activities towards these substrates in humans. The other form, designated P-450PA, had relatively high phenacetin O-deethylase activity and appears to be involved in the variation of this activity among humans. Polyclonal antibodies raised to the two enzymes were specific for the antigens as judged by immunoelectrophoresis and immuno-inhibition studies. The two enzymes and their activities were distinguished by chromatographic separation, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, amino acid composition, immuno-inhibition studies, and steady-state kinetic assays. Immunochemical studies suggest that each form represents only a small fraction of the total cytochrome P-450 in human liver microsomes. These biochemical studies provide a basis for better understanding the mechanisms which underlie genetic polymorphisms involving P-450 cytochromes in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2167036087,"Forebrain and cerebellar Type II Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases have different subunit compositions. The forebrain holoenzyme, characterized in our laboratory, is a 650-kDa holoenzyme composed of 50-kDa alpha-subunits and 60-kDa beta-subunits assembled in approximately a 3:1 ratio (Bennett, M. K., Erondu, N. E., and Kennedy, M. B. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 12735-12744). The cerebellar isozyme is a 500-kDa holoenzyme composed of alpha-subunits and beta-subunits assembled in almost the converse ratio, approximately four beta-subunits for each alpha-subunit. When compared by tryptic peptide mapping and by immunochemical techniques, the beta-subunits from the two brain regions are indistinguishable and the alpha-subunits appear closely related. The specific activities, substrate specificities, and catalytic constants of the cerebellar and forebrain isozymes are similar, suggesting that the alpha- and beta-subunits contain similar catalytic sites. However, two differences in the properties of the isozymes may result in functional differences between them in vivo. First, the apparent affinity of the cerebellar kinase for Ca2+/calmodulin is 2-fold higher than that of the forebrain kinase. Second, the two isozymes appear to associate differently with subcellular structures. Approximately 85% of the cerebellar kinase and 50% of the forebrain kinase remain in the particulate fraction after homogenization under standard conditions. However, they are present in different amounts in postsynaptic density fractions. Postsynaptic densities prepared from forebrain contain the forebrain isozyme. Immunochemical measurements show that it comprises approximately 16% of their total protein. In contrast, postsynaptic densities prepared from cerebellum contain the cerebellar isozyme, but it comprises only approximately 1-2% of their total protein. Thus, the alpha-subunit may play a role in anchoring Type II Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase to postsynaptic densities."
https://openalex.org/W1558943498,"Proteoglycans were extracted in good yield from the proximal, fibrous portion of adult bovine tendon with 4 m guanidine HCl. They comprise less than 1% of the dry weight of the tissue. Using CsCl density gradient centrifugation, gel chromatography, and ion exchange chromatography, two populations of proteoglycans were separated and purified from other tissue proteins. One was a large, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan with high buoyant density in CsCl. This component appeared to be composed of two or three subpopulations as detected by agarose/polyacrylamide electrophoresis, although they could not be effectively separated from one another for individual characterization. As a group, the large proteoglycans eluted from Sepharose CL-2B with Kav from 0.1-0.5 and their core protein had Mr greater than 200,000 with high contents of glutamic acid, serine, and glycine. The glycosaminoglycan chains had a weight average Mr of 17,000 and more than 98% of the uronic acid was glucuronic acid. This group comprised only 12% of the total proteoglycan of the tissue. The other 88% of the proteoglycans appeared to represent one group of small molecules that eluted from Sepharose CL-2B at Kav = 0.70. They demonstrated buoyant densities in a CsCl gradient ranging from greater than or equal to 1.51 to 1.30 g/ml. Their core protein had an apparent Mr = 48,000 following removal of the glycosaminoglycan chains by digestion with chondroitinase ABC. This core protein had a particularly high content of aspartic acid/asparagine and leucine. The glycosaminoglycan chains had a weight average Mr of 37,000 and were dermatan sulfate containing 73% iduronic acid. Those molecules found at highest buoyant density appeared to have additional glycosaminoglycan chains that were shorter. Proteoglycans were also extracted from the pressure-bearing distal region of this tendon, where contents of proteoglycan per wet weight of tissue were 3-fold higher and as much as 50% of this was as large as the large proteoglycans from the proximal tissue. Preparations of large proteoglycans from both tendon regions contained molecules capable of interacting with hyaluronic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1608557156,"The 2.5-A crystal structure of the calcium-free form of the dimeric venom phospholipase A2 from the Western Diamondback rattlesnake Crotalus atrox, has been refined to an R-factor of 17.8% (I greater than 2 sigma) and acceptable stereochemistry. The molecule is a nearly perfect 2-fold symmetric dimer in which most of the catalytic residues of both subunits face an internal cavity. The restricted access to the putative catalytic sites is especially puzzling as the optimal substrates for this and most other phospholipase A2 are phospholipids condensed in micellar or lamellar aggregates. We point out that substrate access to the internal cavity may be aided by calcium binding which can alter the intersubunit contacts that shield the catalytic network. We also suggest that a system of hydrogen-bonded moieties exists on the surface of the dimer that links the amino terminus to the catalytic system, through an invariant Gln 4 side chain and the backbone of the active center residue, Tyr 73. This hydrogen-bonded network is on a highly accessible surface of the dimer and would appear to contribute to the enzyme's (as opposed to the proenzyme's) special capacity to attack aggregated rather than monomeric substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1575468184,"Methemoglobin and metmyoglobin catalyze the H2O2-dependent oxidation of styrene to styrene oxide and benzaldehyde. The formation of styrene oxide requires molecular oxygen as well as H2O2 but does not, as shown by inhibitor studies, involve the superoxide or hydroxyl radicals. Approximately 38, 67, and 78% of the oxygen in styrene oxide derives from 18O2 in the reactions catalyzed, respectively, by bovine hemoglobin, sperm whale myoglobin, and equine heart myoglobin, whereas 70, 55, and 35% of the oxygen can be shown to be derived from [18O]H2O2. However, a larger fraction of the epoxide oxygen than suggested by the labeling data (perhaps all) derives from molecular oxygen rather than H2O2 because the hemoproteins produce molecular oxygen from the peroxide. The epoxidation of styrene by methemoglobin gives equal amounts of the R and S enantiomers and, as shown by studies with trans-[1-2H]styrene, proceeds with partial (33%) loss of the olefin stereochemistry. The results are rationalized by H2O2-dependent formation of a protein radical that combines with molecular oxygen to give a protein-peroxy radical that oxidizes styrene."
https://openalex.org/W1485794802,"Abstract For the studies on the mechanism of induction of peroxisomal beta-oxidation enzymes and biogenesis of the organelle, we have isolated cDNA clones for rat peroxisomal enoyl-CoA: hydratase-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase bifunctional enzyme. On blotting experiments with liver RNA, the cDNAs hybridized to a 3.0-kilobase RNA which was increased 5-7-fold by the administration of di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate to rats. Nucleotide sequencing was carried out for four cloned cDNAs and one obtained by a primer extension method. By overlapping these sequences with each other, we identified 20 nucleotides of 5'-noncoding, 2,166 nucleotides of coding, and 910 nucleotides of 3'-noncoding regions. The deduced amino acid sequence of the enzyme is composed of 722 residues, and the composition agrees with that of the protein data. The sequence was confirmed by the amino acid compositions and sequence analyses of some of the tryptic peptides. The molecular weight of the mature enzyme is calculated to be 78,511 from the predicted amino acid sequence. The enzyme has no terminal peptide extension as a signal for translocation into peroxisomes."
https://openalex.org/W1935256917,"A sialic acid-binding lectin with high specificity for 9-O-acetyl- and 4-O-acetylsialic acids was purified from the hemolymph of the California coastal crab, Cancer antennarius, by affinity chromatography using bovine submaxillary mucin coupled to agarose. The binding specificity of the crab lectin distinguishes it from other known sialic acid-specific lectins from Limulus polyphemus and Limax flavus which show a broader range of specificity for sialic acids. The purified lectin is homogenous on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electropherograms with a subunit molecular weight of about 36 kDa. The specificity of the lectin for O-acetylsialic acids appears to account for the fact that it agglutinates mouse, rat, rabbit, and horse erythrocytes, which contain O-acetylsialic acids on cell surface glycoconjugates, but not human monkey, sheep, goat, and chicken erythrocytes which contain only NeuAc or N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc). This conclusion was supported by the potent inhibition of hemagglutination by bovine and equine submaxillary mucins which contain 9(7,8)-O-acetyl- and 4-O-acetylsialic acids, respectively, and also by free 9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid (9-O-Ac-NeuAc) and 4-O-Ac-NeuAc relative to NeuAc and NeuGc. Further support for the role of O-Ac-sialic acids in hemagglutination of erythrocytes was obtained by enzymatic modification of human erythrocytes. Sialidase-treated erythrocytes were resialylated with purified sialyltransferases and various CMP-sialic acid donor substrates to contain NeuAc or NeuGc or 9-O-Ac-NeuAc in the Sia alpha 2,3Gal or Sia alpha 2,6Gal linkages. Cells resialylated to contain NeuAc or NeuGc were not agglutinated, but cells resialylated to contain 9-O-Ac-NeuAc were agglutinated with high titer, comparable to that of mice or horse erythrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1527012508,"Four common sialic acids (Sia), NeuAc, N-glycolyl-neuraminic acid (NeuGc), 4-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid (4-O-Ac-NeuAc), and 9-O-Ac-NeuAc were examined for activation to their corresponding CMP-sialic acid conjugates and subsequently for their transfer to glycoprotein oligosaccharides by purified mammalian sialyltransferases. CMP-sialic acid synthetases from calf brain and from bovine and equine submaxillary glands were found to convert NeuAc, NeuGc, and 9-O-Ac-NeuAc to their corresponding CMP-sailic acids. In contrast, no conversion of 4-O-Ac-NeuAc to CMP-4-O-Ac-NeuAc was observed for any of the three synthetases examined. A new procedure for the preparation of CMP-9-O-Ac-NeuAc, CMP-NeuGc, and CMP-NeuAc in high yield and purity was developed, using the calf brain CMP-sialic acid synthetase. Each of these derivatives was tested as donor substrates for six mammalian sialyltransferases purified from porcine, rat, and bovine tissues, including a bovine GalNAc alpha 2,6 sialyltransferase whose purification is described in this report. The sialyltransferases examined represent those which form the Sia alpha 2,6Gal beta 1,4-GlcNAc-, Sia alpha 2,3Gal beta 1,3(4)GlcNAc-, Sia alpha 2,3Gal beta 1,3-GalNAc- and Sia alpha 2,6GalNAc- sequences found on N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharides of glycoproteins. CMP-NeuAc and CMP-NeuGc were equally good donor substrates for all six sialyltransferases. However, transfer of 9-O-Ac-NeuAc from CMP-9-O-Ac-NeuAc varied from only 10% to nearly 70% that of the transfer of NeuAc from CMP-NeuAc. Results are viewed to define the relative roles of direct transfer of these sialic acids and modification of glycosidically bound NeuAc in glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1575885714,"A cancer-associated glycolipid antigen defined by monoclonal antibody 19-9 has the structure NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal Gal beta 1-3GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-Cer. We have (formula; see text) studied its biosynthesis by testing the capacity of a crude microsomal fraction of SW 1116 cells to catalyze the addition of fucosyl or sialyl residues from GDP-fucose or CMP-sialic acid to glycolipid or oligosaccharide precursors. When the tetrasaccharide NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-3GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc (LSTa) is incubated with GDP-[14C]fucose and SW 1116 microsomes, a 14C-labeled oligosaccharide is formed that can be separated from the incubation mixture on an affinity column containing antibody 19-9 bound to protein A-Sepharose. The product migrates slower than LSTa when analyzed by paper or thin-layer chromatography. After treatment with neuraminidase, it co-migrates with the pentasaccharide Gal beta 1-3GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc (formula; see text) (LNF II) in both chromatographic systems. Similar experiments demonstrate that SW 1116 microsomes catalyze the addition of a sialyl residue to the tetrasaccharide Gal beta 1-3GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc to form LSTa. However, when LNF II is incubated with CMP-[14C]sialic acid and SW 1116 microsomes, no 19-9-active product is detected by affinity chromatography or by paper or thin-layer chromatography. Results using glycolipid precursors are consistent with these findings and also demonstrate the presence of the Lewis fucosyltransferase in SW 1116 cells. Thus, the biosynthesis of the sialyl-Lea antigen proceeds by addition of sialic acid to a type 1 precursor chain by a sialyltransferase, followed by addition of fucose by the Lewis fucosyltransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1608246645,"Almost all living organisms studied respond to elevated temperature with a marked inhibition of overall protein synthesis but increased synthesis of a specific set of proteins, the so-called heat-shock proteins. We have prepared a cell-free protein synthesizing system (lysate) from heat-shocked Ehrlich ascites tumor cells that reflects the inhibition of protein synthesis in intact cells at elevated temperatures. We have isolated and partially purified a stimulator of the heat-shocked cell lysate from Ehrlich cells. Through four purification steps, the stimulator is chromatographically identical to eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF-4F), an initiation factor which specifically binds mRNA cap structure. Therefore, we have tested the effects of highly purified reticulocyte eIF-4F on the heat-shocked cell lysate. Protein synthesis is strongly stimulated by addition of highly purified eIF-4F. Synthesis in the heat-shocked lysate is more inhibited at high (70 mM) KCl concentrations, than at lower concentrations, and stimulation by eIF-4F is correspondingly greater at higher KCl concentrations, so that the rate of protein synthesis is returned to control (non-heat-shocked lysate) levels at all KCl concentrations. Furthermore, at 70 mM KCl, in heat-shocked lysates, synthesis of the 68-kDa heat-shock protein is much less inhibited than synthesis of the bulk of non-heat-shock proteins, and eIF-4F stimulates synthesis of 68-kDa protein to a much lesser extent than non-heat-shock proteins. Thus, addition of purified eIF-4F reverses the effects of elevated temperatures on Ehrlich cells that are reflected in lysates. Therefore, we propose that the inhibition of translation in heat-shocked Ehrlich cells is the result of inactivation of eIF-4F function."
https://openalex.org/W1562973495,"DNA methylase activity in the nuclei of somatic cells arrested at G0 increased markedly when the cells were subjected to a mitogenic stimulus. Treatment of mouse splenocytes with Concanavalin A resulted in about 20-fold increase in methylase activity within 20 h starting 12-15 h after Concanavalin A addition. The methylase level in rat liver was elevated approximately 3-fold at about 20-h posthepatectomy. A detailed time course of the increase in methylase activity with respect to the cell cycle revealed that the onset of this event coincided with the entry of the cells into S phase. In both systems, the extent of methylation in CpG sequences is not altered significantly even under conditions of active DNA synthesis which is induced by the mitogenic effect. These results suggest that the cell responds to the mitogenic stimulus by adjusting the DNA methylase activity to enable conservation of the methylation level in DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1649343135,"Guinea pig hearts perfused in vitro with 99% enriched [3-13C]pyruvate and [3-13C]lactate have been examined by 13C NMR spectroscopy at 75.45 MHz. Resonances from the intracellular metabolites, glutamate, aspartate, alanine, citrate, malate, lactate, and acetylcarnitine are detected in the [3-13C]pyruvate-perfused hearts while glutamate is the only metabolite observed in the [3-13C]lactate-perfused hearts. Extracts obtained from individual freeze-clamped hearts run under high resolution conditions show similar distributions of metabolites indicating that the intracellular concentrations of these metabolites are indeed quite dependent upon the substrate being utilized. The excellent signal to noise in the spectra of lactate-perfused hearts allows observation of spin-spin coupling between 13C-enriched nuclei in the various glutamate isotopomers within the intact heart. It is shown that the steady-state distribution of glutamate isotopomers is determined by the amount of 12C- versus 13C-enriched acetyl-CoA entering the citric acid cycle and this provides the basis for a direct determination of substrate utilization by the heart in the presence of competing substrates. Similar information may be derived from the 13C spectrum of an extract prepared from a single [3-13C]pyruvate-perfused heart. Our results indicate that lactate is preferred over glucose by the guinea pig heart even in the presence of insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1519239098,"Mammalian metallothionein is a low molecular weight protein with two metal-binding domains. To determine if metal binding in one domain affects binding in the other, we prepared peptides corresponding to the regions that enfold the two metal-thiolate clusters. Metal reconstitution studies of these peptides revealed stoichiometries of metal binding similar to those observed within the intact molecule. Thus, the alpha domain coordinates 4 Cd(II), 6 Cu(I), or 6 Ag(I) ions regardless of whether the domain is part of the total protein or is studied as a separate peptide. Likewise, the beta domain binds 3 Cd(II), 6 Cu(I), or 6 Ag(I) ions in both the intact protein and as a separate peptide. If cluster B in intact metallothionein is preformed with Cu(I) or Ag(I), cluster A saturates with either 4 mol eq of Cd(II) or 6 mol eq of Ag(I). Similarly, preformation of the A cluster with Cd(II) does not affect the binding of 6 Cu(I) ions in the B cluster. Therefore, the metal-dependent folding of the protein to create one cluster occurs independent of constraints or influences from the other domain. Formation of the protein with a tetrahedrally coordinated metal in one cluster and a trigonally coordinated metal in the other center is possible."
https://openalex.org/W1570474317,"Biosynthesis of sulfated saccharides that are linked to asparagine residues in the cell surface glycoprotein of Halobacterium halobium via a glucose residue involves sulfated dolichyl-monophosphoryl oligosaccharide intermediates (Lechner, J., Wieland, F., and Sumper, M. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 860-866). During isolation and characterization of these lipid oligosaccharides we detected a group of related compounds containing additional unidentified sugar residues. Here we report that: 1) the unknown sugar residues were 3-O-methylglucose, linked peripherally to the lipid-saccharide intermediates; 2) the 3-O-methylglucose residues in the oligosaccharides occur only at the lipid-linked level but are absent at the protein-linked level; 3) cell surface glycoprotein biosynthesis in Halobacteria in vivo is drastically depressed when S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylation is inhibited, indicating that methylation is an obligatory step during glycoprotein synthesis. We propose a mechanism for the transport of lipid oligosaccharides through the cell membrane, involving an intermediate stage in which the saccharide moieties are transiently modified with 3-O-methylglucose."
https://openalex.org/W1523032196,"When [6-3H,6-14C]glucose was given in glucose loads to fasted rats, the average 3H/14C ratios in the glycogens deposited in their livers, relative to that in the glucoses administered, were 0.85 and 0.88. When [3-3H,3-14C]lactate was given in trace quantity along with unlabeled glucose loads, the average 3H/14C ratio in the glycogens deposited was 0.08. This indicates that a major fraction of the carbons of the glucose loads was converted to liver glycogen without first being converted to lactate. When [3-3H,6-14C]glucose was given in glucose loads, the 3H/14C ratios in the glycogens deposited averaged 0.44. This indicates that a significant amount of H bound to carbon 3, but not carbon 6, of glucose is removed within liver in the conversion of the carbons of the glucose to glycogen. This can occur in the pentose cycle and by cycling of glucose-6-P via triose phosphates: glucose—-glucose-6-P—-triose phosphates—-glucose-6-P—-glycogen. The contributions of these pathways were estimated by giving glucose loads labeled with [1-14C]glucose, [2-14C]glucose, [5-14C]glucose, and [6-14C]glucose and degrading the glucoses obtained by hydrolyzing the glycogens that deposited. Only a few per cent of the glucose carbons deposited in glycogen were deposited in liver via glucose-6-P conversion to triose phosphates. Between 4 and 9% of the glucose utilized by the liver was utilized in the pentose cycle. While these are relatively small percentages, since three NADP3H molecules are formed from each molecule of [3-3H]glucose-6-P utilized in the cycle, a major portion of the difference between the ratios obtained with [3-3H]glucose and with [6-3H]glucose is attributable to metabolism in the pentose cycle. Because 3H of [3-3H]glucose is extensively removed during the conversion of the glucose to glycogen within liver the extent of incorporation of the 3H into liver glycogen is not the measure of glucose's metabolism in other tissues before its carbons are deposited in liver glycogen. The distributions of 14C from the 14C-labeled glucoses into the carbons of the liver glycogens mean that at a minimum about 30% of the carbons of the glucose deposited in the glycogen were first converted to lactate or its metabolic equivalent."
https://openalex.org/W1517385423,"To study the specific role of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) residues in prothrombin, we have isolated a series of partially carboxylated prothrombin variants from a patient with a hereditary defect in vitamin K-dependent carboxylation (Goldsmith, G. H., Pence, R. E., Ratnoff, O. D., Adelstein, D. A., and Furie, B. (1982) J. Clin. Invest. 69, 1253-1260). The three variant prothrombins, purified by DEAE-Sephacel, immunoaffinity chromatography, and preparative gel electrophoresis, were indistinguishable from prothrombin in molecular weight, amino acid composition, and NH2-terminal amino acid sequence, with the exception of Gla residues. Variant prothrombin 1, with 8 Gla residues, had 66% of the coagulant activity of prothrombin, one high affinity metal-binding site (Kd = 15 nM), and three lower affinity sites (Kd = 2.7 microM); prothrombin contained two high affinity (36 nM) and four lower affinity sites (Kd = 1 microM). Ca(II) induced a 23% decrease in the intrinsic fluorescence of variant prothrombin 1 fragment 1, compared to a 35% decrease in that of prothrombin fragment 1. The phospholipid binding activity of variant prothrombin 1 was 44% that of prothrombin. Variant prothrombin 2 and variant prothrombin 3, with 4 and 6 Gla residues, respectively, had about 5% of prothrombin coagulant activity and a single high affinity and two lower affinity metal-binding sites and exhibited no phospholipid binding activity. Variant prothrombin 3 fragment 1 and variant prothrombin 2 fragment 1 demonstrated 18 and 13% of Ca(II)-induced fluorescence quenching, respectively. Abnormal prothrombin, with 1 Gla residue, had 8% of prothrombin coagulant activity, a single lower affinity (1 microM) metal-binding site, and 13% Ca(II)-induced fluorescence quenching of the fragment 1 species and did not bind to phospholipid. These results indicate that Gla residues define the metal binding properties of prothrombin. Most, if not all, of the Gla residues are required for complete prothrombin function, and the prothrombin coagulant activity correlates to the phospholipid binding activity of the prothrombin species."
https://openalex.org/W1519681703,"The binding of adrenodoxin to cytochrome P-450scc and the intracomplex electron transfer from the iron-sulfur center to the heme have been studied. Salt sensitivity of the protein complex suggests the participation of electrostatic forces, as is also seen for the complex of adrenodoxin with NADPH-adrenodoxin reductase. Differences in ion specificities for the complexes of adrenodoxin with the other two proteins suggest some differences in binding requirements. Insensitivity of the heme reduction to solution conditions (salt, detergent) and kinetic analysis indicate that the protein complex is formed rapidly and that intracomplex electron transfer then occurs more slowly. Factors governing the rate of this electron transfer were investigated; binding of a series of cholesterol derivatives was used to perturb the spin state, midpoint potential, and reduction rate of the heme, and thus to test for relationships among these parameters. A linear free energy relationship between the substrate-induced midpoint potential and reduction rate is seen, but none of the other parameters (including the strength of substrate binding) are correlated. Data indicate that factors other than spin state (i.e. steric requirements and bonding groups within the steroid-binding site) regulate the strength of steroid binding. The bound steroid then modulates both midpoint potential/reduction rate and spin state but by independent mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1566807664,The beta subunits of equine lutropin and equine chorionic gonadotropin were incubated in 0.013 N HCl for 30 min at 110 degrees C and separated into two fragments by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The amino acid and carbohydrate compositions of both fragments from each subunit were analyzed. The results demonstrated that equine lutropin-beta has a glycosylated COOH-terminal extension that differs only in carbohydrate composition from the COOH-terminal portion of equine chorionic gonadotropin-beta. This is the first demonstration of a glycosylated COOH-terminal extension in a pituitary glycoprotein hormone.
https://openalex.org/W1481998725,"The effects of aging and of liposome treatment on the lateral mobility of phospholipids and proteins in the plasma membrane of cultured rat heart myocytes were studied by fluorescence photobleaching recovery. Both the mobile fraction (R) and the lateral diffusion coefficient (D) of the fluorescent phospholipid N-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazolyl phosphatidylethanolamine were found to depend on the culture's age. Aged myocyte cultures (15 days old) demonstrated higher R and lower D as compared with young ones (5 days old). Treatment of aged cultures with phosphatidylcholine (PC) liposomes, which increases the PC/sphingomyelin (SM) ratio and decreases the cholesterol level, reversed the D value to the level observed in young cultures and decreased R below the value encountered in young cells. Treatments with SM liposomes (which induce cholesterol depletion without altering the PC/SM ratio) and with PC/cholesterol (1:0.9) liposomes (which increase the PC/SM ratio without cholesterol depletion) have indicated that the PC-liposome effect is due to changes in both the PC/SM ratio and in the cholesterol level. Analogous experiments on the mobility of succinyl-concanavalin A receptors yielded similar effects on R, without altering the D value. The changes in the D and R values of the markers studied are most likely initiated by the observed alterations in the myocyte lipid composition under the conditions employed. The possible involvement of changes in the organization of membrane lipids in domains in the observed phenomena is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1488544446,"The growth of Leishmania donovani promastigotes and mouse L cells is differentially inhibited by several inosine analogs with modifications in the imidazole ring. The protozoal and mammalian cells also demonstrate differential metabolism of these analogs. 7-Deazainosine, 7-thia-7,9-dideazainosine, and formycin B were converted to their respective ATP analogs by both cell types. 8-Azainosine was converted to a GTP analog by mouse L cells; L. donovani did not metabolize this nucleoside. 9-Deazainosine and allopurinol riboside were metabolized only to their respective IMP analogs by L cells. L. donovani metabolized 9-deazainosine and allopurinol riboside to their ATP analogs and also metabolized 9-deazainosine to its GTP analog. All nucleosides studied were resistant to cleavage by either organism. From metabolism studies in the presence of a specific enzyme inhibitor, it was deduced that allopurinol riboside, formycin B, and 9-deazainosine were phosphorylated by at least two different routes in the mouse L cells. The metabolism of formycin B was inhibited 65% by the adenosine kinase inhibitor, 5-iodotubercidin, whereas the metabolism of allopurinol riboside (14% inhibition) and 9-deazainosine (0% inhibition) was only slightly affected by this inhibitor. The metabolism of allopurinol riboside and 9-deazainosine by L. donovani was not affected by 5-iodotubercidin. In contrast to the results of L cells, the metabolism of formycin B by L. donovani was also not affected by 5-iodotubercidin. The abilities of mouse L cells and L. donovani to metabolize these inosine analogs to the corresponding nucleotide analogs of ATP or GTP may be considered to be an activating step and correlates well with the respective cytotoxic effects of these compounds."
https://openalex.org/W978210423,"When KB cells were labeled with either 51Cr (1 microCi/ml) or [35S]methionine (5 microCi/ml) and treated with 10 micrograms/ml of adenovirus type 2 (Ad2) at pH 6.0 for 60 min at 37 degrees C, about 25% of the cell-associated 51Cr and 5% of the [35S]methionine were released into the medium. The 51Cr was mainly associated with molecules of 1500 Da or less. When KB cells were labeled with either [3H] choline, alpha-[3H]aminobutyric acid, or [3H]deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose and exposed to Ad2, these molecules were released in amounts much higher than 51Cr. The Ad2-dependent release of choline was found to be dependent on Ad2 concentration, with maximum release (nearly 60%) at 10 micrograms/ml of Ad2, on the length of the incubation with Ad2, with maximum release at about 90 min, and on the medium pH with maximum activity at pH 6.0 to 6.5. Greater than 95% of the choline released was water-soluble and identified as choline phosphate. Less than 5% of the choline released was associated with lipids, and none was released as a phospholipid vesicle or micelle. The ability of Ad2 to release choline was abolished by incubating Ad2 for 10 min at 45 degrees C, whereas the binding of Ad2 to the cells was not affected. Fetal calf serum also blocked Ad2-dependent choline release."
https://openalex.org/W1486349850,"The translocation of the enzymatic moiety of diphtheria toxin, fragment A, across the membranes of pure lipid vesicles was demonstrated. A new assay, which employed vesicles made to contain radiolabeled NAD and elongation factor-2, was used to measure the appearance of the enzymatic activity of the A fragment in the vesicles. When the vesicles were exposed to a low-pH medium in the presence of diphtheria toxin, small molecules, such as NAD, escaped into the extravesicular medium, whereas large molecules mostly remained inside the vesicles. The vesicle-entrapped elongation factor-2 became ADP-ribosylated, indicating the entry of fragment A into the vesicle. The translocation of the A fragment depended upon the pH of the medium, being negligible at pH greater than 7.0 and maximal at pH 4.5. The entire toxin molecule was needed for function; neither the A fragment nor the B fragment alone was able to translocate itself across and react with the sequestered substrates. After exposure of the toxin to low pH, the entry of the A fragment was rapid, being virtually complete within 2-3 min at pH 5.5, and within 1 min at pH 4.7. Translocation occurred in the absence of any protein in the vesicle membrane. These results are consistent with the notion that the diphtheria toxin molecule enters the cytoplasm of a cell by escaping from an acidic compartment such as an endocytic vesicle."
https://openalex.org/W1514573774,"Assembly of tubulin, purified from eggs of the sea urchin Stronglyocentrotus purpuratus, was examined at physiological (18 degrees C) and nonphysiological (37 degrees C) temperatures. Critical concentrations for assembly were 0.71 mg/ml at 18 degrees C and 0.21 mg/ml at 37 degrees C. At tubulin concentrations above 1.2 mg/ml at 18 degrees C and 0.5 mg/ml at 37 degrees C, a concentration-dependent in turbidity and in small-angle light scattering was observed; turbidity and scattering increased rapidly to a peak, then decreased asymptotically toward a steady-state value. Quantitative sedimentation analysis revealed that the mass of assembled polymer reached and maintained a constant level during overshoot of turbidity. Changes in the wavelength dependence of turbidity were consistent with the initial formation of sheets of tubulin, followed by conversion of the sheets to microtubules, both at 18 and 37 degrees C. Examination by negative-stain electron microscopy showed that sheetlike structures predominated during the early stages of overshoot assembly, while complete microtubules were present at steady state. Furthermore, measurements of average polymer length revealed that the overshoots in turbidity and in light scattering are unlikely to be caused by polymer length redistribution. Qualitative observations of solution birefringence suggested that the polymer became progressively more aligned during assembly. These results suggest that the turbidity/light-scattering overshoots reflect changes in the form or in the organization of the assembling polymer, or both."
https://openalex.org/W1578463692,"Anthopleurin-B, the most potent peptide heart stimulant from the sea anemone Anthopleura xanthogrammica, was shown to exist as a single polypeptide chain consisting of 49 amino acid residues. The sequence of the peptide was shown to be: Gly-Val-Pro-Cys-Leu-Cys-Asp-Ser-Asp-Gly- Pro-Arg-Pro-Arg-Gly-Asn-Thr-Leu-Ser-Gly-Ile-Leu-Trp-Phe-Tyr-Pro-Ser- Gly-Cys-Pro-Ser-Gly-Trp-His-Asn-Cys-Lys-Ala-His-Gly-Pro-Asn-Ile-Gly- Trp-Cys-Cys-Lys-Lys. The carboxymethylcysteine derivative, tryptic and chymotryptic peptides (obtained from the derivative and separated by high performance liquid chromatography) were sequenced by manual Edman degradation. Although six carboxymethylcysteine residues were formed by reduction and alkylation of the polypeptide, no cysteine residues were detectable in the native protein, indicating that there are three cystine residues in anthopleurin-B. The amino acid sequence differs in 7 places from anthopleurin-A: at residues 3 (Pro for Ser), 12 (Arg for Ser), 13 (Pro for Val), 21 (Ile for Thr), 24 (Phe for Leu), 42 (Asn for Thr), and 49 (Lys for Gln). These differences are important since anthopleurin-B is about a 12.5-fold better heart stimulant than anthopleurin-A from A. xanthogrammica, anthopleurin-C from Anthopleura elegantissima, and toxin II from Anemonia sulcata."
https://openalex.org/W204802093,"The nature of a transmembrane transport process depends largely on the identity of the reaction that is rate-limiting in the transport cycle. The one-for-one exchange of two chloride ions across the red cell membrane by band 3 can be decomposed into two component reactions: 1) the binding and dissociation of chloride at the transport site, and 2) the translocation of bound chloride across the membrane. The present work utilizes 35 Cl NMR and 37 Cl NMR to set lower limits on the rates of chloride binding and dissociation at the saturated inward- and outward-facing band 3 transport sites (≥10^(5) events site^-1 s^-1 in all cases). At both 0-3 and 37 degrees C, the NMR data specify that chloride binding and dissociation a the saturated transport sites are not rate-limiting, indicating that translocation of bound chloride across the membrane is the slowest step in the overall transport cycle. 

Using these results, it is now possible to describe many features of the kinetic equation for the ping-pong transport cycle of band 3. This transport cycle can be decomposed into two half-reactions associated with the transport of two chloride ions in opposite directions across the membrane, where each half-reaction is composed of sequential binding, translocation, and dissociation events. One half-reaction contains the rate-limiting translocation event that controls the turnover of the transport cycle; in this half-reaction, translocation must be slower than binding and dissociation. The other half-reaction contains the non-rate-limiting translocation event that in principle could be faster than binding or dissociation. However, when the following sufficient (but not necessary) condition is satisfied, both translocation events are slower than binding and dissociation: if the non-rate-limiting translocation rate is within a factor of 10^(2) (0-3 degrees C) or 2 (37 degrees C) of the overall turnover rate, then translocation is rate-limiting in each saturated half-reaction. Thus, even though chloride appears to migrate through a channel that leads from the transport site to solution, the results support a picture in which the binding, dissociation, and channel migration events are rapid compared to the translocation of bound chloride across the membrane. In this case, chloride binding to the transport site can be described by a simple dissociation constant (KD = kappa OFF/kappa ON) rather than by a Michaelis-Menten constant (KM = (kappa OFF + kappa TRANSLOCATION)/KAPPA ON)."
https://openalex.org/W1492259769,"Pseudomonas sp. M grown on mevalonate as the sole source of carbon has 200- to 800-fold induced levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. The enzyme, which was purified to a homogeneous state in 54% yield (final specific activity, 60.5 mumol of NAD+ reduced per min per mg of protein), converted R-mevalonate (Km = 0.15 mM) to S-HMG-CoA. Activity was sensitive to sulfhydryl modifying reagents. The apparent molecular weight of the holoenzyme was 178,000 and that of the subunit 43,000. The enzyme thus appears to be a tetramer. Comparison of a 23-residue amino-terminal sequence with the cDNA-derived sequence of Chinese hamster ovary cell HMG-CoA reductase showed little homology and antibody raised against the Pseudomonas enzyme did not appear to cross-react with rat liver HMG-CoA reductase. Addition of mevalonate to cells growing on glucose was followed by a rapid and biphasic induction of HMG-CoA reductase activity. During phase I, mevalonate or its catabolites may accumulate in intact cells of Pseudomonas sp. M and acetoacetate, a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (Ki = 3.2 mM), may feedback inhibit the enzyme under these conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1513624659,"Several embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell lines were tested in culture for their ability to metabolize all-trans-[3H]retinol, all-trans-[3H]retinyl acetate, and all-trans-[3H]retinoic acid. There was little, if any, metabolism of all-trans-retinol to more polar compounds; we failed to detect conversion to acidic retinoids by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and derivatization. We also did not observe [3H]retinoic acid when EC cells were incubated with [3H]retinyl acetate. Unlike the other retinoids, all-trans-[3H]retinoic acid, even at micromolar levels, was almost totally modified by cells from several EC lines within 24 h. Most of the labeled products were secreted into the medium. Some EC lines metabolized retinoic acid constitutively, whereas others had an inducible enzyme system. A differentiation-defective line, which contains little or no cellular retinoic acid-binding protein activity, metabolized retinoic acid poorly, even after exposure to inducers. At least eight retinoic acid metabolites were generated; many contain hydroxyl residues. Our data lead us to propose that retinol does not induce differentiation of EC cells in vitro via conversion to retinoic acid. Also, the relatively rapid metabolism of retinoic acid by EC cells suggests either that the induction of differentiation need involve only a transient exposure to this retinoid or that one or more of the retinoic acid metabolites can also promote differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1574625292,"Band 3 catalyzes the one-for-one exchange of monovalent anions across the red cell membrane. At least two anion binding sites have been postulated to exist on the transport unit: 1) a transport site that has been observed by saturation kinetics and by 35 Cl NMR studies of chloride binding, and 2) a 35Cl NMR-invisible inhibitory site that has been proposed to explain the inhibition of anion exchange at large anion concentrations. A number of independent studies have indicated that the transport site is alternately exposed to different sides of the membrane during the transport cycle. Yet the role, if any, of the postulated inhibitory site in the transport cycle is not known. Here it is shown that: 1) when the [Cl-], [Br-], or pH is varied, the band 3 transport sites on both sides of the membrane behave like a homogeneous population of simple anion binding sites in 35Cl NMR experiments, and 2) when the [Cl-] is varied, the outward-facing transport site behaves like a simple anion binding site. These results indicate that the postulated inhibitory site has no effect on chloride binding to the transport site. Instead, the results are quantitatively consistent with the ping-pong model (Gunn, R. B., and Frolich, O. (1979) J. Gen. Physiol. 74, 351-374), which states that the transport site is the only site involved in the transport cycle. Expressions are derived for the macroscopically observed characteristics of a ping-pong transporter: these characteristics are shown to be weighted averages of the microscopic properties of the inward- and outward-facing conformations of the transport site. In addition to supporting the simplicity of the transport mechanism, the high pH titration curve for chloride binding to the transport site provides insight into the structure of the site. The macroscopically observed pKA = 11.1 +/- 0.1 in the leaky ghost system indicates that an arginine must provide the essential positive charge in the inward- or outward-facing conformation of the transport site, or in both conformations."
https://openalex.org/W1526944797,"The effects of divalent cations (Zn2+, Cd2+, Ca2+, Mg2+) on the cytosol androgen receptor were determined by sedimentation into sucrose gradients. At low ionic strength (25 mM KCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4), Zn2+ (200 microM total, which calculates to 130 nM free Zn2+ in 10 mM mercaptoethanol) causes a shift in the sedimentation coefficient of the rat Dunning prostate tumor (R3327H) cytosol receptor and rat ventral prostate cytosol receptor from 7.5 +/- 0.3 S to 8.6 +/- 0.3 S. Zn2+ stabilizes the 8.6 S receptor form in salt concentrations up to 0.15 M KCl in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.2. In low ionic strength gradients containing Ca2+ (greater than or equal to 200 microM) or Mg2+ (greater than or equal to 1 mM), the receptor sediments as 4.7 +/- 0.3 S. The dissociating effects of Ca2+ and Mg2+ can be fully reversed by sedimentation into gradients containing Zn2+ (200 microM total) or Cd2+ (10 microM total). In the presence of Zn2+ (200 microM total), Ca2+ (10 microM to 3 mM) converts the receptor to an intermediate form with sedimentation coefficient 6.2 +/- 0.2 S, Stokes radius 73 A, and apparent Mr approximately 203,000. The potentiating effect of Zn2+ on formation of the 8.6 S receptor (in the absence of Ca2+) and the 6.2 S receptor (in the presence of Ca2+) requires both the 4.5 S receptor and the 8 S androgen receptor-promoting factor. Sodium molybdate stabilizes the untransformed cytosol receptor but, unlike Zn2+, does not promote reconstitution of the 8.6 S receptor from its partially purified components. These results indicate that divalent cations alter the molecular size of the androgen receptor in vitro and thus may have a role in altering the state of transformation of the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1608159114,"When CO2/Mg2+-activated spinach leaf ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.39) is incubated with the transition-state analog 2-carboxyarabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate, an essentially irreversible complex is formed. The extreme stability of this quaternary complex has allowed the use of native analytical isoelectric focusing, anion-exchange chromatography, and nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to probe the mechanism of the binding process and the effects of ligand tight-binding on the structure of the protein molecule. Changes in the chromatographic and electrophoretic properties of the enzyme upon tight binding of the inhibitor reveal that the ligand induces a conformational reorganization which extends to the surface of the protein molecule and, at saturation, results in a 16% decrease in apparent molecular weight. Analysis of ligand binding by isoelectric focusing shows that (i) incubating the protein with a stoichiometric molar concentration of ligand (site basis) results in an apparently charge homogeneous enzyme population with an isoelectric point of 4.9, and (ii) substoichiometric levels of ligand produce differential effects on each of the charge microheterogeneous native enzyme forms. These stoichiometry-dependent changes in electrofocusing band patterns were employed as a probe of cooperativity in the ligand tight-binding process. The tight-binding reaction was shown to be negatively cooperative."
https://openalex.org/W1907243625,"Marrow cells induced toward erythroid differentiation by treatment with erythropoietin respond by increasing the rates of iron uptake and hemoglobin synthesis. Study of the enzymes of heme biosynthesis during erythroid differentiation suggests that induction of heme synthesis in these cells is regulated by synthesis of porphobilinogen deaminase. The activities of delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase, gamma, delta-dioxovaleric acid transaminase, delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, and ferrochelatase were not affected significantly by treatment of suppressed marrow cells with erythropoietin over a period of 4 days, whereas that of porphobilinogen deaminase was increased by as much as 3.5-fold by the 3rd day of incubation. The time course of increase in porphobilinogen deaminase activity was parallel to that of the increase in heme synthesis. Moreover, when porphobilinogen deaminase activity was compared in marrow cells exposed to increased levels of erythropoietin in vivo (hyperplastic marrow) and marrow cells exposed to lowered levels of erythropoietin in vivo (suppressed marrow), the activity in the former case was greater than that in normal cells and for the latter type of cell it was lower than normal. Experiments using actinomycin D and cycloheximide suggest that transcription is required for the erythropoietin-induced porphobilinogen deaminase activity, indicating that induction is probably at the level of de novo synthesis of enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1505951281,"We describe a K+ transport system in Methanospirillum hungatei cells depleted of cytoplasmic K+ via an ammonia/K+ exchange reaction (Sprott, G. D., Shaw, K. M., and Jarrell, K. F. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 12602-12608). Ammonia-treated cells contained low concentrations of ATP and were unable to make CH4 or to transport 86Rb+. All of these properties were restored by CaCl2, MgCl2, or MnCl2, and not by CoCl2 or NiCl2. The Rb+ transport system had a Km of 0.42 and Vmax of 29 nmol/min X mg; K+ inhibited competitively. Both H2 and CO2 were required for appreciable transport, whereas air, valinomycin, or nigericin were potent inhibitors. The influx of Rb+ was electrogenic and associated with proton efflux, producing a delta pH (alkaline inside) in acidic media. In the absence of K+ (or Rb+), the activation of CH4 synthesis by Mg2+ produced little change in the cytoplasmic pH, showing that methanogenesis did not elicit a net efflux of protons. The pH optimum for transport was in the range 6.0-7.3 where the transmembrane pH gradient would contribute minimally to the proton motive force. Protonophores at pH 6.3 caused a partial decline in CH4 synthesis and the ATP content and dramatically collapsed Rb+ transport. These and other inhibitor experiments, coupled with the fact that the Rb+ gradient was too large to be in equilibrium with the proton motive force alone, suggest a role for both ATP and the proton motive force in Rb+ transport. Also, a role for K+ in osmoregulation is indicated."
https://openalex.org/W1517524532,"Although 2-O-sulfated L-iduronic acid (IdoA) residues have been known to occur in heparin, 2-O-sulfated D-glucuronic acid (GlcA) residues have been reported only recently (Bienkowski, M. J., and Conrad, H. E. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 356-365). Disaccharides prepared by cleavage of heparin and N-deacetylated chondroitin 6-sulfate with nitrous acid were used to demonstrate a new sulfatase that catalyzed the removal of the 2-O-sulfate substituents from GlcA but not IdoA residues. The deamination products were labeled by NaB3H4 reduction to give disaccharides from heparin and chondroitin sulfate which had reducing terminal 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol ([3H]AManR) and 2,5-anhydro-D-talitol ([3H]ATalR) residues, respectively. IdoA(2-SO4)-[3H]AManR(6-SO4) from heparin and GlcA(2-SO4)-[3H]ATalR(6-SO4) from chondroitin sulfate were purified for use as substrates. GlcA(2-SO4)-[3H]AManR(6-SO4) was prepared by epimerization of IdoA(2-SO4)-[3H]AManR(6-SO4) with hydrazine at 100 degrees C. Lysosomal enzyme preparations from chick embryo chondrocytes and from two normal human fibroblast cell lines catalyzed the removal of the 2-O-SO4 substituent from the uronic acid residues of IdoA(2-SO4)-[3H]AManR(6-SO4), GlcA(2-SO4)-[3H] AManR(6-SO4), and GlcA(2-SO4)-[3H]ATalR(6-SO4). In contrast, a lysosomal enzyme preparation from a human fibroblast cell line deficient in idurono-2-sulfatase (Hunter's-syndrome), which had no activity on the IdoA(2-SO4)-[3H]AManR(6-SO4), converted GlcA(2-SO4)-[3H]AManR(6-SO4) to a mixture of GlcA-[3H] AManR(6-SO4) and [3H]AManR(6-SO4). This enzyme also converted GlcA(2-SO4)-[3H]ATalR(6-SO4) to a mixture of GlcA-[3H]ATalR(6-SO4) and [3H]ATalR(6-SO4). Digestion of both GlcA(2-SO4)-[3H]AManR(6-SO4) and GlcA(2-SO4)-[3H]ATalR(6-SO4) was inhibited by 35SO2-4 and was arrested at the monosulfated disaccharide stage by 1,4-saccharolactone. The glucurono-2-sulfatase exhibited a pH optimum of 4. The results indicate that there exists a separate sulfatase for the removal of sulfate substituents from C-2 of GlcA residues in glycosaminoglycans."
https://openalex.org/W1541204691,"The effect of cholesteryl oleate on the lipoprotein lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis of trioleoylglycerol was determined in monolayers of egg phosphatidylcholine at a constant surface pressure of 24 mN m-1. The phospholipid monolayers contained 1.0 to 7.5 mol % trioleoylglycerol and various amounts (0 to 20 mol %) of cholesteryl oleate. The initial rates of trioleoylglycerol hydrolysis were determined with lipoprotein lipase purified from bovine milk. In phospholipid monolayers containing 5.0 or 7.5 mol % trioleoylglycerol, the further addition of cholesteryl oleate caused a decrease in lipoprotein lipase activity. In contrast, addition of cholesteryl oleate to phospholipid monolayers containing 1.0 or 2.5 mol % trioleoylglycerol enhanced enzyme activity; a 3-fold enhancement was observed with 5.0-7.5 mol % cholesteryl oleate. Based on force-area measurements, the cholesteryl ester-mediated decrease in lipoprotein lipase activity observed at high substrate concentrations may be explained by displacement of trioleoylglycerol from the interface, thereby reducing the interfacial trioleoylglycerol concentration available for enzyme catalysis. One explanation for the cholesteryl oleate-mediated enhancement of lipoprotein lipase activity at low trioleoylglycerol concentrations is that the additional spreading of cholesteryl oleate disrupts microemulsions of trioleoylglycerol, thereby increasing the effective monomer substrate concentration available for enzyme catalysis. Based on these monolayer studies with model systems, we suggest that the relative amount of cholesteryl esters in plasma triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins plays a regulatory role in determining the rate at which triacylglycerols are cleared from the circulation."
https://openalex.org/W1745146471,"The method of competition kinetics, which measures the binding kinetics of an unlabeled ligand through its effect on the binding kinetics of a labeled ligand, was employed to investigate the kinetics of muscarinic agonist binding to rat brain medulla pons homogenates. The agonists studied were acetylcholine, carbamylcholine, and oxotremorine, with N-methyl-4-[3H]piperidyl benzilate employed as the radiolabeled ligand. Our results suggested that the binding of muscarinic agonists to the high affinity sites is characterized by dissociation rate constants higher by 2 orders of magnitude than those of antagonists, with rather similar association rate constants. In contrast, the major differences between the kinetic binding parameters of agonists and antagonists to the low affinity agonist binding sites are in the association rate constants, which were 2-5 orders of magnitude lower for agonists. This demonstrates that there are basic differences in the interactions of agonists with the low and high affinity sites. Our findings also suggest that isomerization of the muscarinic receptors following ligand binding is significant in the case of antagonists, but not of agonists. Moreover, it is demonstrated that in the medulla pons preparation, agonist-induced interconversion between high and low affinity bindings sites does not occur to an appreciable extent."
https://openalex.org/W1541832000,"The regulation of ppp(A2'p)nA-(2-5A)-dependent RNase (RNase L or RNase F) was investigated in NIH 3T3, clone 1 cells using 2-5A-binding and nuclease activity assays. Minimal levels of 2-5A-dependent RNase were detected in actively dividing clone 1 cells; these levels were independently induced by growth arrest or interferon treatment. Accordingly, levels of the RNase were enhanced during growth arrest by confluency regardless of the presence or absence of interferon or antibody to interferon in the media. Measurement of 2-5A-dependent RNase was unaffected by the addition of any of six different proteinase inhibitors to the cells prior to extraction. The expression of 2-5A-dependent RNase in growth-arrested, interferon-treated cells was still relatively low (about one-third to one-half of that found in similarly treated murine Ehrlich ascites tumor cells). Although this amount of 2-5A-dependent RNase could not be detected by 2-5A-mediated ribosomal RNA cleavage, the activity was identified using a more sensitive novel assay for 2-5A-dependent RNase. In addition, introduction of 2-5A or poly(I) X poly(C) into growth-arrested, interferon-treated cells resulted in some inhibition of protein synthesis. The results indicated that the expression of 2-5A-dependent RNase in NIH 3T3, clone 1 cells is regulated under different physiological conditions and that low levels of 2-5A-dependent RNase were insufficient to significantly inhibit encephalomyocarditis virus replication."
https://openalex.org/W1532304282,"We propose a method for obtaining kinetic parameters of unlabeled ligands which is based on analyzing the effect of their competition on the binding kinetics of a labeled ligand. In this method (competition kinetics), the binding kinetics of a labeled ligand are measured in the absence and in the presence of given concentrations of a competing unlabeled ligand. The rate equations appropriate to the particular kinetic model may be solved employing linear homogeneous differential equations. The rate constants appearing in the final integrated expressions can be evaluated by nonlinear regression. We have demonstrated the validity and applicability of the method to study receptor systems, using the muscarinic receptors in rat brain cortex as an experimental system. We have determined the various kinetic parameters of two muscarinic antagonists (N-methyl-4-[3H]piperidyl benzilate and (-)-N-[3H]methylscopolamine) by following directly their binding kinetics. These parameters were compared with those obtained for the same unlabeled ligands in homogeneous and heterogeneous competition studies. In all cases, the parameters obtained by the competition kinetics method were close to those extracted from direct binding kinetics, and in cases where both types of studies were performed on the same preparations, the parameters obtained by the two methods were essentially identical."

https://openalex.org/W1584003371,"Microcalorimetric titrations of calmodulin with Ca2+ and trifluoperazine (TFP) at various molar ratios have been carried out at 25 degrees C and at pH 7.0. Ca2+ binding to calmodulin produces heat (-delta H) in the presence of TFP, while heat is absorbed in the absence of TFP. The total heat produced by Ca2+ binding to all four sites is increased at increasing TFP-to-calmodulin ratios, attaining a plateau at about 7. These results indicate that at the higher ratios, the enthalpy changes (delta H) associated with Ca2+ binding are affected by TFP molecules bound at both high- and low-affinity sites. In addition, the Ca2+ binding reaction of the calmodulin-TFP complex is driven solely by a favorable enthalpy change of -27 kJ/mol of site; the entropy change (delta S) is -35 J/mol/K. These thermodynamic changes are opposite to those for TFP-free calmodulin and distinctly different from other Ca2+ binding proteins such as skeletal and cardiac troponin C and parvalbumin, where the reaction is driven by favorable changes of entropy as well as enthalpy."
https://openalex.org/W1595191335,"Sycamore cells (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) in suspension culture were grown at 25 degrees C in culture medium containing two oxygen concentrations: 250 microM O2 (standard conditions) and 10 microM O2 (O2-limiting conditions). The decrease of O2 concentration in the culture medium did not modify significantly the relative proportion of each phospholipid. In contrast, the molar proportion of fatty acids was dramatically changed in all lipid classes of the cell membranes; the average percentage of oleate increased from 3 to 45% whereas that of linoleate decreased from 49 to 22%. When normal culture conditions were restored (250 microM O2), oleate underwent a rapid desaturation process; the loss of oleic acid was associated with a stoichiometric appearance of linoleic acid at a rate of about 4 nmol of oleate desaturated/h/10(6) cells. Under these conditions, no change in the Arrhenius-type plots of the rate of sycamore cell respiration was observed; the values of the transition temperature and of the Arrhenius activation energy (Ea) associated with the cell respiration as well as with the respiration-associated enzymes remained unchanged. Thus it was concluded that the fact that a strong decrease in the fraction of unsaturated fatty acid residues present in the mitochondria had no effect on electron transport rates and Arrhenius plot discontinuities casts doubt on the significance of such changes in terms of chilling injury. Finally it is suggested that some of the Arrhenius discontinuities observed at the level of membrane enzyme could be the consequence of intrinsic thermotropic changes in protein arrangement independent of lipid fluidity."

This latter was used as coenzyme with either L-aspartate (L-glutamate) aminotransferase and L-glutamate or L-glutamate decarboxylase and alpha-methyl-DL-glutamate to generate [4'-3H]pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate known to be labeled in the R-position. Reaction of the oxidase with the pro-R as well as the pro-R,S-labeled substrates followed by isolation of [4'-3H]pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and 3H2O revealed only half the radioactivity was abstracted from the original substrate in either case. Hence, the oxidase is not stereospecific and equally well catalyzes removal of either pro-R or pro-S hydrogen from the 4-methylene of pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1551344652,"Divalent cationic cyanine dyes, such as 2,2'-[3-[2-(3-butyl-4-methyl-2-thiazoline-2-ylidene)-ethylidene] propenylene]bis[3-butyl-4-methylthiazolinium iodide] and platonin induced large membrane current fluctuation when an electrical potential difference was applied across a planar phosphatidylserine bilayer membrane in medium containing inorganic phosphate (Pi). Without Pi, the dyes did not induce current fluctuation at concentrations of less than 30 microM. Noise analysis of current fluctuation indicated formation of a pathway for ion leakage. From measurements of the interfacial tension between oil and aqueous phases, and of water permeability across liposomal membranes, Pi was concluded to relax the phospholipid bilayer structure, resulting in great reduction in the concentration of the cyanine dye necessary for induction of the leakage-type pathway. In the presence of Pi, cationic ions such as tetrabutyl ammonium and tetraphenyl phosphonium did not induce the leakage-type pathway, although they had electrophoretic effects at high concentrations. These facts suggest that the mechanism of the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation by dicationic cyanine dyes in mitochondria is different from that of cationic uncouplers such as tetrabutyl ammonium ion."
https://openalex.org/W1501574728,"Using 12CO and 13CO liganded protein and 406 nm laser excitation, multiple stretching (upsilon(Fe-CO), upsilon(C-O)) and bending (delta(Fe-C-O)) modes have been identified in the resonance Raman spectra of monomeric and polymeric Glycera hemoglobins. While the monomer fraction Glycera dibranchiata hemoglobin has upsilon(Fe-CO) = 496 cm-1, two distinct upsilon(Fe-CO) modes are found at 498 cm-1 and 520 cm-1 for the polymeric protein fraction. Data for upsilon(Fe-CO) and upsilon(C-O) were employed in an isolated three-body oscillator calculation to obtain approximate values for the Fe-C-O bond angle of 175 +/- 5 degrees for one polymeric component and 160 +/- 5 degrees for both the monomer and the second identifiable polymeric component. The differences in ligand binding geometry between the Glycera hemoglobins and other hemeproteins can be used to rationalize the relatively high values of on and off rates exhibited by the Glycera hemoglobins."
https://openalex.org/W1548426952,"The maximum ability of receptor-estradiol complexes to activate RNA polymerase II and bind to nuclear acceptor sites is reduced 40-50% in senescent rat uteri. A precise, linear stoichiometric relationship exists between acceptor site occupancy and polymerase activity, and this relationship is not altered with aging. Thus, reduced ability of estrogen to stimulate RNA polymerase II in aged rat uteri appears to be due to deficits in binding of receptor-estradiol complexes to nuclear acceptor sites."

https://openalex.org/W1520649629,"Treatment of nucleosomal particles with dimethylmaleic anhydride, a reagent for protein amino groups, is accompanied by a biphasic release of histones H2A plus H2B; one H2A.H2B dimer is more easily released than the other. This behavior allows the preparation of nucleosomal particles containing only one H2A.H2B dimer, which were complemented with 125I-labeled H2A.H2B. These reconstituted particles, which contain one labeled and one unlabeled H2A.H2B dimer, were treated with the amount of reagent needed to release one of the two H2A.H2B dimers. Radioactivity was equally distributed between residual particles and released proteins, which is consistent with equivalent binding sites in the nucleosomal particle for H2A.H2B dimers, rather than with intrinsically different sites. The asymmetric release of H2A.H2B dimers would be caused by a change in the binding site of one dimer following the release of the other. This behavior might be related to the structural dynamics of nucleosomes."
https://openalex.org/W80438786,"Basal as well as GTP-dependent adenylate cyclase activity was partially resistant to porcine pancreatic phospholipase A2, although more activity was degraded at 16 than at 2 degrees C. In contrast, isoproterenol-dependent activity was completely destroyed regardless of the temperature. Snake venom phospholipase A2 destroyed approximately 90% of basal and GTP-dependent adenylate cyclase activity at all temperatures. The difference between the lipases is consistent with earlier evidence that elevated temperature facilitates the entry of some forms of phospholipase into the membrane bilayer. The temperature dependence of adenylate cyclase activation by the GTP analog Gpp[NH]p and its pancreatic phospholipase sensitivity were compared. The Arrhenius plots were markedly similar and biphasic with discontinuities at approximately 8 degrees C. The same temperature-dependent phospholipid phase transition might account, therefore, for both adenylate cyclase properties. Only small amounts of membrane phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidic acid were hydrolyzed by pancreatic phospholipase in a temperature-dependent manner analogous to adenylate cyclase degradation. These results suggest that specific phospholipids support catalysis and adenylate cyclase activation, but that different phospholipids are required for receptor coupling which may occur in a less viscous part of the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1595451768,"The C16-double bond of the biolefinic steroid, androsta-5,16-dien-3 beta-ol (delta 16-ANDO), was regioselectively oxidized by male rat liver microsomes in the presence of NADPH and EDTA to 16 alpha, 17 alpha-epoxyandrost-5-en-3 beta-ol (delta 16-ANDO 16,17 alpha-epoxide), 16 beta,-17 beta-epoxyandrost-5-en-3 beta-ol (delta 16-ANDO 16,17 beta-epoxide), androst-5-ene-3 beta, 16 alpha, 17 beta-triol (delta 16-ANDO 16 alpha, 17 beta-glycol), and androst-5-ene-3 beta, 16 beta, 17 alpha-triol (delta 16-ANDO 16 beta, 17 alpha-glycol). The microsomes hydrolyzed delta 16-ANDO 16,17 alpha-epoxide specifically to the 16 beta, 17 alpha-glycol and delta 16-ANDO 16,17 beta-epoxide to the 16 beta, 17 alpha-glycol and the 16 alpha, 17 beta-glycol in an equal ratio. delta 16-ANDO 16,17 alpha-epoxide was much more susceptible to microsomal hydrolysis than the 16,17 beta-epoxide. The xenobiotic epoxide hydrolase inhibitor, 3,3,3-trichloropropene 1,2-oxide, potently inhibited microsomal hydrolysis of delta 16-ANDO 16,17-epoxides as well as of benzo[a]pyrene 4,5-epoxide and styrene 7,8-epoxide. Addition of 3,3,3-trichloropropene 1,2-oxide accumulated the 16,17-epoxides formed from delta 16-ANDO in the reaction medium with concomitant decrease in the amounts of the 16,17-glycols formed, leading to a conclusion that the 16,17-epoxides played a role as obligatory intermediates in the microsomal delta 16-oxidation of delta 16-ANDO to the 16,17-glycols. Epoxidation of delta 16-ANDO was stereoselectively mediated by a cytochrome P-450 with quite unique properties to form the 16,17 alpha-epoxide as the major oxidation product and the 16,17 beta-epoxide as the minor. The epoxidation was strongly inhibited with CO, activated with 2-diethylaminoethyl 2,2-diphenylvalerate hydrochloride more than twice as much, and little affected with metyrapone and 7,8-benzoflavone. A pretreatment of the animals with 3-methylcholanthrene induced the delta 16-ANDO-epoxidizing activity of their microsomes 1.5 times higher than those from the control animals. However, a pretreatment with phenobarbital reduced the enzyme activity to one-half of the control microsomes. Under the same conditions, microsomal activities of hydroxylation of benzo[a]pyrene and N-demethylation of benzphetamine were significantly induced by the pretreatments with 3-methylcholanthrene and phenobarbital, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1557465421,"Abstract The mobility of 13C specifically labeled branched chain end groups of iso-even fatty acids in intact, live Bacillus thuringiensis cells was studied by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This study apparently represents the first direct observation of branched chain carbon atoms in living cells. End groups were labeled using DL-[beta, delta, delta'-13C]valine as a precursor chain initiator for iso-even fatty acid synthesis after using L-[delta, delta'-14C]L-valine to determine optimal conditions for labeling of the membrane fatty acid end groups. Cell survival in the NMR was determined for various lengths of time at 28 and 39 degrees C. Subsequently, 13C-labeled vegetative cells, sporulating cells (three stages of development), and purified mature spores were analyzed by 13C NMR using corresponding unlabeled cells as controls. Spin lattice relaxation times (T1) were obtained for the enriched iso-branched region at 23.3 ppm and for the natural abundance peak for the glycerol backbone (carbons 1 and 3) of the membrane lipids at 61.7 ppm. The T1 of the glycerol carbons (0.08 s) did not change significantly with stage of development or temperature. The T1 of the iso-even enriched end group changed dramatically from vegetative cells (0.70s) to sporulating cells (0.28 s) at 28 degrees C. A decrease in the T1 was also observed at 39 degrees C from 0.91 s for vegetative cells to 0.54 s for sporulating cells. Accompanying the reduced mobility indicated by the T1 values, there was a general decline in the signal-to-noise ratios of identically acquired spectra as sporulation continued which culminated in the lack of discernible plasma membrane lipid resonances in purified mature spores. The progressive loss of signal appeared to have resulted from a continuous decline in the fraction of plasma membrane fatty acids with sufficient mobility to give signals above background."
