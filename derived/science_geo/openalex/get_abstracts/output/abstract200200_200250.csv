https://openalex.org/W2084558945,"IN current estimates of the genetic hazard of ionizing radiations to man1,2 four important assumptions are made : (1) that the mutagenic effect of a given radiation dose to the gonads is independent of dose-rate ; (2) that the relationship of mutation-rate to accumulated dose is linear ; (3) that the spectrum of radiation-induced mutation is similar to the spectrum of spontaneous mutation, and (4) that a dose of about 30–80 rads induces as much mutation as occurs spontaneously per generation (‘doubling dose’). Assumptions (1), (2) and (3) derive largely from experiments with Drosophila ; assumption (4) derives in part from the fact that a spermatogonial doubling dose of this order was estimated for seven specific genes in the mouse from observations of the spontaneous mutation-rate3,4 and from experiments4 in which adult males were given a high X-ray dose at a high dose-rate (600 rads, 90 rads/min.), the validity of assumptions (1), (2) and (3) being presupposed."

He refers to these as βC, βBC, βCD and βD 1,2. βC is the type most commonly found, but βBC occurred in about 1 per cent of Canadians and βCD in about 4 per cent of American Negroes and even more frequently in Australian Aboriginals. The formation of the different β-globulins B, C and D appears to be genetically controlled and Smithies suggests that each may be determined by one of three allelic genes."

https://openalex.org/W2054949720,"A REPORT was recently published1 of a new antifungal antibiotic, flavofungin, from a previously unreported Streptomyces strain, Streptomyces flavofungini. This species produces, besides flavofungin, another antibiotic. Its presence was demonstrated by the paper-chromatographic examination of the fermentation fluid and of the crude flavofungin. The Streptomyces strain originally isolated produces much more of this antibiotic than of flavofungin, in contrast to its natural variant, which synthesizes flavofungin more abundantly. The second antibiotic can be extracted from the fermentation broth as well as from the mycelium with organic solvents. We succeeded in obtaining hexagonal crystals from various solvent systems (Fig. 1). This new antibiotic was named ‘desertomycin’, after the source (African desert sand) of the Streptomyces strain which produces it."

https://openalex.org/W2012600453,"A MAJOR constituent of factor I isolated from mammalian brain has been shown to be γ-amino-n-butyric acid1. It has been assumed that this material, an inhibitor of the crayfish stretch receptor, is an inhibitory transmitter substance within the mammalian central nervous system2. Recent investigations indeed have shown that γ-amino-n-butyric acid reversibly depresses the potentials arising from the synaptic activation of cells within the cerebral cortex3 but no precise differentiation as to the mode of action of γ-amino-n-butyric acid has been attempted."

https://openalex.org/W2068003663,"WHEN moderate doses of tissue thromboplastin are injected into the jugular vein of rats the circulating blood loses its clotting properties, with the result that no intravascular thrombi are, as a rule, produced. This effect of thromboplastin depends upon its capacity for inducing the formation of thrombin in blood from the plasma prothrombin. In most cases intravenous administration of moderate doses of thrombin to healthy animals does not cause thrombosis, for the clotting mechanism becomes disordered almost immediately after the injections. At the same time the thromboplastic activity of blood shows a sharp decrease, while fibrinogen capable of reacting with thrombin disappears and heparin-like substances appear in the blood. This protective reaction, maintaining the blood in a fluid state in the vascular bed when thrombin arises in it, is brought about by the physiological anticoagulating system. Experiments have shown that in narcotic sleep resulting from inhalation of sulphuric ether, as well as from anæsthesia produced by an intramuscular injection of novocaine on both sides of the spinal column, this anticoagulating system ceases to function. It is this effect that accounts for the fact that coagulation of circulating blood and death from thrombosis have been found to occur in anæsthetized test animals (as opposed to controls in a normal physiological condition) after an intravenous administration of certain doses of thrombin (Table 1)."

https://openalex.org/W2081387034,"NUMEROUS workers have shown that the parotid glands of ruminants secrete saliva continuously, but only a small number of observations have been made on the secretion of both glands in the one animal. Scheunert and his colleagues1 observed that the two parotids of sheep secrete independently of one another and considered it probable that the fistulated parotid secretes only a minimal amount of saliva. Colin2 ascribed the differences in the secretion of the two parotid glands which he observed in the case of an ox to the preference on the part of the animal for chewing on the non-operated side."

https://openalex.org/W2086930956,"THE development of relatively simple techniques for the chromatographic separation of growth-active fractions from plant extracts, and their detection by chromogenic reagents, has led to the conclusion that indoleacetic acid and other indole compounds are the principal naturally occurring growth substances, as detectable in the coleoptile straight-growth test. In many instances, however, the characterization of growth-active fractions as indole or non-indole compounds has been based on insufficient evidence, or lack of awareness as to the sensitivity or specificity of the techniques used. For example, the growth activity in extracts of potato tubers has been ascribed to the presence of several indole compounds1–3, yet no single investigator has demonstrated a correlation between colour reaction and biological activity for chromatograms developed in a number of solvent systems."

https://openalex.org/W2030138191,"METHODS have been devised for the separation of bile acids and their conjugates with glycine or taurine using partition chromatography on columns1,2 or paper3,4. These methods, however, may confuse certain glycine conjugated acids with the unconjugated bile acids containing a greater number of hydroxyl groups4. Thus ambiguous separations may result if unconjugated bile acids are also present in the mixture."

https://openalex.org/W2003367781,"PARTICULATE matter and cells injected sub-cutaneously are normally localized at the site of injection, while the suspending medium diffuses outwards1. Exceptional behaviour might be expected of cells from the bone marrow and spleen, however, for these cells can become established in homologous tissues after intravenous injection into irradiated hosts2. On the other hand, the intravenous route of injection is more effective than the subcutaneous in procuring the functional survival of these cells, as judged by protection against lethal irradiation3, and the adoptive transfer of immunity4. The continued production of a specific antibody by spleen cells was used in the present experiments, to determine their localization after subcutaneous implantation."
