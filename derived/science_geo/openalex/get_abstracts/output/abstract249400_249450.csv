https://openalex.org/W2056284729,"The dynamic spatial redistribution of individuals is a key driving force of various spatiotemporal phenomena on geographical scales. It can synchronise populations of interacting species, stabilise them, and diversify gene pools [1-3]. Human travelling, e.g. is responsible for the geographical spread of human infectious disease [4-9]. In the light of increasing international trade, intensified human mobility and an imminent influenza A epidemic [10] the knowledge of dynamical and statistical properties of human travel is thus of fundamental importance. Despite its crucial role, a quantitative assessment of these properties on geographical scales remains elusive and the assumption that humans disperse diffusively still prevails in models. Here we report on a solid and quantitative assessment of human travelling statistics by analysing the circulation of bank notes in the United States. Based on a comprehensive dataset of over a million individual displacements we find that dispersal is anomalous in two ways. First, the distribution of travelling distances decays as a power law, indicating that trajectories of bank notes are reminiscent of scale free random walks known as Levy flights. Secondly, the probability of remaining in a small, spatially confined region for a time T is dominated by algebraically long tails which attenuate the superdiffusive spread. We show that human travelling behaviour can be described mathematically on many spatiotemporal scales by a two parameter continuous time random walk model to a surprising accuracy and conclude that human travel on geographical scales is an ambivalent effectively superdiffusive process."

Seven mammalian Sir2 homologs have been identified (SIRT1–SIRT7), and it has been speculated that some may have similar functions to Sir2. Here, we demonstrate that SIRT6 is a nuclear, chromatin-associated protein that promotes resistance to DNA damage and suppresses genomic instability in mouse cells, in association with a role in base excision repair (BER). SIRT6-deficient mice are small and at 2–3 weeks of age develop abnormalities that include profound lymphopenia, loss of subcutaneous fat, lordokyphosis, and severe metabolic defects, eventually dying at about 4 weeks. We conclude that one function of SIRT6 is to promote normal DNA repair, and that SIRT6 loss leads to abnormalities in mice that overlap with aging-associated degenerative processes.

The silent information regulator (SIR) genes are nonessential genes required in trans for transcriptional repression of several genomic loci in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae (Klar et al., 1981Klar A.J.

Herskowitz I. Four genes responsible for a position effect on expression from HML and HMR in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 1987; 116: 9-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sir2 is unique among these factors in belonging to a large family of closely related proteins present both in prokaryotic and eukaryotic species (reviewed in Dutnall and Pillus, 2001Dutnall R.N. Pillus L. Deciphering NAD-dependent deacetylases.Cell. 2001; 105: 161-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Sir2 functions in a complex with other Sir proteins to repress transcription at the silent mating type loci and subtelomeric sequences. In addition, Sir2 is part of another multicomponent complex in the nucleolus, where it represses recombination and transcription of rDNA repeats (Gotta et al., 1997Gotta M. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Renauld H. Laroche T. Kennedy B.K. Grunstein M. Gasser S.M.

Sir2 exerts its effects on transcriptional and recombinational silencing via modulation of chromatin structure (Fritze et al., 1997Fritze C.E. Verschueren K. Strich R. Easton Esposito R.

S. cerevisiae Sir2 promotes longevity in yeast mother cells (Kaeberlein et al., 1999Kaeberlein M. McVey M. Guarente L. The SIR2/3/4 complex and SIR2 alone promote longevity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by two different mechanisms.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2570-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar). Cells lacking Sir2 have a reduced replicative life span, and cells with extra copies display a longer life span. Sir2 extends yeast life span by inhibiting recombination in the rDNA repeats, since the recombinational excision and subsequent accumulation of extrachromosomal rDNA circles promotes senescence (Kaeberlein et al., 1999Kaeberlein M.

Increased Sir2 activity in C. elegans and Drosophila also extends life span (Tissenbaum and Guarente, 2001Tissenbaum H.A. Guarente L.

Sirtuin activators mimic caloric restriction and delay ageing in metazoans.Nature. 2004; 430: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1485) Google Scholar); however, the mechanism of life span extension seems to differ from that in yeast. Thus, Sir2-driven increased longevity in C. elegans is dependent on the Daf-16 transcription factor, a critical mediator in the insulin-like signaling pathway, which promotes formation of long-lived dauer larvae under unfavorable environmental conditions and increases stress resistance and longevity in adults (Kenyon, 2001Kenyon C. A conserved regulatory system for aging.Cell. 2001; 105: 165-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Sir2 family members also were suggested to mediate effects of caloric restriction (CR; Sohal and Weindruch, 1996Sohal R.S. Weindruch R. Oxidative stress, caloric restriction, and aging.Science. 1996; 273: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2519) Google Scholar), a dietary regimen capable of extending life span in diverse organisms from yeast to mammals (Cohen et al., 2004Cohen H.Y.

Sirtuin activators mimic caloric restriction and delay ageing in metazoans.Nature. 2004; 430: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1485) Google Scholar). CR likely decreases production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), a potential source of persistent DNA damage proposed to contribute to aging (Balaban et al., 2005Balaban R.S. Nemoto S. Finkel T. Mitochondria, oxidants, and aging.Cell. 2005; 120: 483-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2954) Google Scholar). The evolutionary conservation of a role for Sir2 in regulating life span has fueled speculation that such a role also may be conserved in mammals (Blander and Guarente, 2004Blander G. Guarente L. The sir2 family of protein deacetylases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar, North and Verdin, 2004North B.J. Verdin E. Sirtuins: Sir2-related NAD-dependent protein deacetylases.Genome Biol. 2004; 5: 224Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). There are seven mammalian Sir2 family members, designated SIRT1–SIRT7 (Frye, 2000Frye R.A. Phylogenetic classification of prokaryotic and eukaryotic Sir2-like proteins.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar), with SIRT1 being the most highly related to S. cerevisiae Sir2. However, unlike yeast Sir2, which deacetylates histones exclusively, SIRT1 possesses a large list of substrates, including p53 and forkhead transcription factors, which modulate cellular resistance to oxidative and genotoxic stress (Blander and Guarente, 2004Blander G. Guarente L. The sir2 family of protein deacetylases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). In addition, SIRT1, like Sir2, has been shown to modify chromatin and silence transcription of integrated reporter genes via histone deacetylation (Vaquero et al., 2004Vaquero A. Scher M. Lee D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Human SirT1 interacts with histone H1 and promotes formation of facultative heterochromatin.Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 93-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). However, potential roles of SIRT1 in life span regulation have not yet been documented. SIRT2 and SIRT3 possess deacetylase activity but are cytoplasmic proteins with functions that diverge from those of ySir2 (Blander and Guarente, 2004Blander G. Guarente L. The sir2 family of protein deacetylases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). Little information is available about the functions of the other mammalian SIRTs. Mammals employ various pathways to repair specific types of DNA damage. Mutant mice defective in individual DNA repair pathways frequently show increased genomic instability and hypersensitivity to specific DNA-damaging agents. Double-strand breaks (DSBs), such as those induced by ionizing radiation (IR), are repaired by nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR). Single-stranded DNA lesions are repaired via nucleotide excision repair (NER) or base excision repair (BER), depending on the type of lesion (Hoeijmakers, 2001Hoeijmakers J.H. Genome maintenance mechanisms for preventing cancer.Nature. 2001; 411: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (2995) Google Scholar). In this context, bulky photodimer single-strand lesions induced by UV irradiation are primarily repaired by NER, whereas more simple types of single-stranded lesions usually are repaired by BER. The BER pathway may repair up to one million nucleotides per cell per day (Holmquist, 1998Holmquist G.P. Endogenous lesions, S-phase-independent spontaneous mutations, and evolutionary strategies for base excision repair.Mutat. Res. 1998; 400: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and repairs single-strand breaks (SSBs) that arise spontaneously, such as those from endogenous alkylation, oxidation, and deamination events, as well as small, nonhelix-distorting DNA lesions induced by chemical mutagens such as the alkylating agent methyl-methane sulphonate (MMS; (Lindahl and Barnes, 2000Lindahl T. Barnes D.E. Repair of endogenous DNA damage.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 2000; 65: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, Sancar et al., 2004Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-Kacmaz K. Linn S. Molecular mechanisms of mammalian DNA repair and the DNA damage checkpoints.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2332) Google Scholar). Defects in NHEJ, HR, and NER have been shown to cause aging-like phenotypes in mice and humans. However, there have been no mouse models to study potential effects of BER with respect to aging; since mutations of BER components either are lethal or confer no obvious phenotype (Lombard et al., 2005Lombard D.B. Chua K.F. Mostoslavsky R. Franco S. Gostissa M. Alt F.W. DNA repair, genome stability, and aging.Cell. 2005; 120: 497-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). In this study, we have focused on elucidating the functions of the mammalian SIRT6 protein. We find that SIRT6 is a chromatin-associated protein that is required for normal BER maintenance of genomic integrity in cells. Moreover, SIRT6 deficiency in mice leads to the development of an acute degenerative aging-like phenotype. To gain insight into SIRT6 function, we characterized subcellular and tissue distribution patterns of SIRT6 expression. SIRT6 protein was predominantly nuclear, as assessed by immunostaining mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells with an anti-SIRT6 antibody and human HT1080 cells into which we retrovirally transduced a FLAG-tagged SIRT6 protein (Figures 1A and 1B). Analysis of SIRT6 RNA and protein revealed SIRT6 expression in most mouse tissues (Figures 1C and 1D), with particularly high protein levels in thymus, skeletal muscle, and brain. Overall, these findings are consistent with those of other recent studies (Liszt et al., 2005Liszt G. Ford E. Kurtev M. Guarente L. Mouse Sir2 homolog SIRT6 is a nuclear ADP-ribosyltransferase.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21313-21320Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, Michishita et al., 2005Michishita E. Park J.Y. Burneskis J.M. Barrett J.C. Horikawa I. Evolutionarily conserved and nonconserved cellular localizations and functions of human SIRT proteins.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4623-4635Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). To probe the possibility that SIRT6 might function in the context of chromatin, we asked whether it is associated with a chromatin-enriched biochemical fraction. Isolated nuclei were separated into nucleoplasmic and chromatin/nuclear matrix subfractions, and SIRT6 protein detected by Western analysis. Endogenous SIRT6 protein in mouse ES cells, and retrovirally expressed FLAG-SIRT6 protein in HT1080 cells cofractionated with histones, almost exclusively within the chromatin/nuclear matrix subfraction (Figures 1E and 1F). As a control, the SIRT1 protein was present in both the nucleoplasm and the chromatin/nuclear matrix subfractions in these cells, as expected (Vaquero et al., 2004Vaquero A. Scher M. Lee D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Human SirT1 interacts with histone H1 and promotes formation of facultative heterochromatin.Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 93-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar; reviewed in Guarente and Picard, 2005Guarente L. Picard F. Calorie restriction—the SIR2 connection.Cell. 2005; 120: 473-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). We conclude that SIRT6 is preferentially associated with chromatin within the nucleus. To gain insight into SIRT6 function we generated SIRT6-deficient embryonic stem (ES) cells by replacing SIRT6 with a LacZ gene introduced in frame into the exon 1 (see Figure S1A in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Appropriately targeted ES cells were confirmed by Southern blotting (Figure S1A) and used to generate mice heterozygous for the SIRT6-inactivating mutation (referred to as SIRT6+/−). SIRT6+/− were interbred to obtain homozygous mutant (SIRT6−/−) mice and SIRT6−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). We also generated SIRT6−/− ES cells via the high G418-selection method (Mortensen et al., 1992Mortensen R.M. Conner D.A. Chao S. Geisterfer-Lowrance A.A. Seidman J.G. Production of homozygous mutant ES cells with a single targeting construct.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2391-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar and data not shown). We confirmed absence of SIRT6 RNA and protein in SIRT6−/− cells by RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively (Figure S1B). We also analyzed SIRT6+/− mice for βGal staining and confirmed expression of lacZ from the SIRT6 promoter in most tissues, both in adult mice and in embryos during development (Figure S1C and data not shown). To gain insight into the cellular effects of SIRT6 deficiency, we compared proliferation rates of SIRT6−/− and wild-type control MEFs in culture (Figure 2A). Multiple independent SIRT6−/− MEF lines grew more slowly than wild-type controls. Analysis of BrdU incorporation revealed that exponentially growing SIRT6−/− MEF cultures had a smaller fraction of S phase cells than control wt cultures (Figure 2A). Similarly, exponentially growing SIRT6−/− ES cell cultures had a reduced fraction of BrdU-incorporating cells compared to controls (Figure 2A). Thus, absence of SIRT6 reduces the proliferative rate of multiple cell types. To test for SIRT6 roles in DNA repair, we compared the sensitivity of SIRT6−/− MEFs and ES cells to IR and UV damage. Notably, SIRT6−/− MEFs and ES cells both exhibited increased sensitivity to IR (Figures 2B and 2C), albeit less than cells deficient in XRCC4, a core NHEJ factor. In contrast, SIRT6−/− MEFs exhibited normal UV sensitivity, indicating that SIRT6 deficiency confers hypersensitivity only to specific types of DNA damage (Figure 2D). To confirm that increased IR-sensitivity of the SIRT6−/− cells was a consequence of SIRT6 deficiency, SIRT6−/− MEFs were reconstituted with a retroviral SIRT6 expression vector, which restored SIRT6 expression (Figure S2) and largely reversed the increased IR hypersensitivity of SIRT6−/− MEFs (Figure 2E). Notably, expression of a catalytic mutant form of SIRT6 did not rescue the IR sensitivity (Figure 2E), indicating that the putative enzymatic activity of SIRT6 is required for its function in DNA repair. To investigate whether SIRT6 suppresses genomic instability, metaphase chromosomes were prepared from SIRT6−/− MEFs and analyzed for abnormalities. Strikingly, chromosomal aberrations were significantly increased in SIRT6−/− cells (Figure 3A; Table 1), with increased frequency of several types of anomalies, including fragmented chromosomes, detached centromeres, and gaps. Increased genomic instability of SIRT6−/− MEFs was evident in both early and late passage cultures (data not shown). Spectral karyotype analysis (SKY) revealed chromosomal translocations in SIRT6−/− MEFs (Figure 3B; Table 1). Karyotype analysis of the SIRT6−/− ES cells also revealed increased genomic instability (Figure 3C; Table 1). Together, these results indicate that SIRT6 plays a general role in maintaining genome integrity.Table 1Increased Genomic Instability in SIRT6-Deficient Cells(A) MEFsDAPISKYwtKOwtKOTotal Metaphases96962424Fragments/breaks423Fragments02Gaps518Translocations06Detached centromeres25Dicentric01Other aberrations07Abnormal metaphases (%)8 (7%)36 (38%)0 (0%)9 (34%)p < 0.0001p < 0.01(B) ES Cells—Q-FISHwtXRCC4−/−KO1KO2Metaphases50505050Translocations0112Breaks/fragments5101413Other aberrations0110Total metaphases with abnormalities (%)4 (8%)11 (22%)13 (28%)12 (26%)(A) MEFs were prepared from 13.5-day-old embryos, and metaphases were prepared from passage 1–2 cells.

(B) ES cells of the indicated genotypes were grown, and metaphases prepared as described in Experimental Procedures. Q-FISH was performed, and aberrations scored as indicated. Genomic instability can result from either direct defects in DNA repair or faulty cell cycle checkpoints. We tested whether SIRT6 is required for normal cell cycle checkpoints in response to IR. Cells were irradiated with a range of doses and collected following BrdU labeling or staining with anti-phospho H3, to assess the G1/S and the G2/M checkpoints, respectively. In this analysis, SIRT6−/− and wt cultures were indistinguishable in exhibiting dose-dependent decreases in S phase and mitotic fractions, indicating that the G1/S and G2/M cell cycle checkpoints are not affected by absence of SIRT6 (Figure 4A). We then assessed integrity of DNA DSB repair pathways in SIRT6−/− cells. To test NHEJ, an extrachromosomal plasmid-based recombination assay was used to quantify repair of DNA DSBs introduced by the RAG endonuclease into an immunoglobulin V(D)J recombination substrate (Hesse et al., 1987Hesse J.E. Lieber M.R. Gellert M. Mizuuchi K.

Rathbun G. Oltz E. Stamato T. Jeggo P.A. Alt F.W. Impairment of V(D)J recombination in double-strand break repair mutants.Science. 1993; 260: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Based on this semiquantitative NHEJ assay, SIRT6−/− MEFs repaired RAG-generated DSBs within the range of wt cells (Figure 4B). This conclusion was confirmed by our finding of normal lymphocyte development in young SIRT6−/− mice (see below). To test for chromosomal DSB repair, we performed pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) following exposure of SIRT6−/− or control cells to high doses of IR for various lengths of time and found that SIRT6−/− cells showed similar DSB repair to wt cells (Figure 4C). Further, we analyzed formation and clearance of γH2AX foci, an early marker of the DSB response (Thiriet and Hayes, 2005Thiriet C. Hayes J.J. Chromatin in need of a fix: Phosphorylation of H2AX connects chromatin to DNA repair.Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 617-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and again observed no difference between wt and SIRT6−/− cells (Figure 4D). Together, these observations suggest that the increased DNA damage sensitivity of SIRT6−/− cells is unlikely to result from impaired checkpoints or DSB repair pathways. We next tested whether SIRT6 deficiency affects repair of DNA lesions other than DSBs. Because NER is the main pathway responsible for repairing UV generated bulky adducts and SIRT6−/− MEFs showed normal sensitivity to UV irradiation (Figure 2D), we focused on BER. Monofunctional alkylating agents such as MMS and ROS generation due to oxidative agents such as H2O2 generate lesions that are primarily repaired by BER. In this regard, cells defective in different components of the BER pathway, such as Polβ and PARP-1, showed increased sensitivity to these agents (Sobol et al., 1996Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Requirement of mammalian DNA polymerase-beta in base-excision repair.Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, Trucco et al., 1998Trucco C. Oliver F.J. de Murcia G. Menissier-de Murcia J. DNA repair defect in poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-deficient cell lines.Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2644-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). When SIRT6-deficient MEFs were exposed to MMS or H2O2, they showed markedly increased sensitivity compared to wt cells (Figure 5A). In contrast, cells deficient for XRCC4 showed increased sensitivity only to high doses of these agents, likely due to the high density of SSBs generated during repair under these conditions leading to DSBs. We also found that SIRT6−/− ES displayed increased sensitivity to MMS and H2O2 (Figure 5A). Notably, reconstitution with recombinant wild-type SIRT6, but not the catalytically inactive SIRT6 mutant, reversed the MMS and H2O2 hypersensitivity of SIRT6-deficient MEFs (Figure 5B). Together, these results suggest that the regulation of genomic stability by SIRT6 might be due to a role of SIRT6 in the context of BER. Previous studies have demonstrated that the rate-limiting step in BER is the removal of the 5′-deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) by the dRP lyase domain of Polβ, the major polymerase used for BER in mammalian cells (Sobol et al., 1996Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Requirement of mammalian DNA polymerase-beta in base-excision repair.Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, Srivastava et al., 1998Srivastava D.K. Berg B.J. Prasad R. Molina J.T. Beard W.A. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. Mammalian abasic site base excision repair. Identification of the reaction sequence and rate-determining steps.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21203-21209Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In addition, the isolated dRP lyase domain of Polβ is sufficient to reverse the MMS hypersensitivity of Polβ-deficient cells (Sobol et al., 2000Sobol R.W. Prasad R. Evenski A. Baker A. Yang X.P. Horton J.K. Wilson S.H. The lyase activity of the DNA repair protein beta-polymerase protects from DNA-damage-induced cytotoxicity.Nature. 2000; 405: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of the Polβ dRP lyase domain increased resistance to DNA damage in immortalized wt MEFs (Sobol et al., 1996Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Requirement of mammalian DNA polymerase-beta in base-excision repair.Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Based on these results, we hypothesized that overexpression of the N-terminal Polβ dRP lyase domain might overcome BER defects imposed by lack of SIRT6. Strikingly, overexpression of the Polβ N-terminal domain in SIRT6−/− MEFs via retroviral transduction restored the MMS, IR, and H2O2 sensitivity to wt levels (Figures 5C and S2B). This effect was not a nonspecific consequence of overexpression of the Polβ dRP lyase, as overexpression of this domain in XRCC4-deficient MEFs did not overcome IR hypersensitivity (Figure 5C). Finally, expression of a catalytically inactive form of the N-terminal domain did not rescue sensitivity of the cells, indicating that rescue was dependent on the dRP lyase activity (Figure 5D). Because Polβ functions exclusively in BER, these results further argue that SIRT6 promotes DNA repair and genomic stability by influencing BER. To test whether SIRT6 affects expression of any of the core BER factors, protein levels of Polβ, XRCC1, LigaseIII, Ape1, and PARP-1 were assessed in SIRT6−/− and control MEFs. None of these showed differences between wt and KO cells (Figure S3). In addition, we tested whether SIRT6 colocalizes with BER factors. In this regard, XRCC1 forms foci upon MMS and H2O2 treatment that colocalize with sites of poly-ADP ribose (PAR) formation (El-Khamisy et al., 2003El-Khamisy S.F. Masutani M. Suzuki H. Caldecott K.W. A requirement for PARP-1 for the assembly or stability of XRCC1 nuclear foci at sites of oxidative DNA damage.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5526-5533Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). In contrast to XRCC1, SIRT6 showed diffuse nuclear staining following exposure of cells to either MMS or H2O2 (Figure S4A and data not shown). In addition, both XRCC1 and PAR foci formed normally in SIRT6-deficient cells (Figure S4B). Together, these results suggest that SIRT6 might function in BER through a mechanism that does not directly involve regulation of BER factors. To analyze the role of SIRT6 in vivo, we generated and analyzed SIRT6−/− mice (Figure 6A). SIRT6−/− mice were born at Mendelian frequency (SIRT6−/− 48 [22%], n = 223) and showed no abnormalities at birth (data not shown). The mice developed normally for the first two weeks, with no apparent histologic abnormalities, though reduced body size became apparent early after birth (Figure 6A). Strikingly, at ∼3 weeks of age, the mice underwent several acute degenerative processes and failed to thrive, invariably dying at around postnatal day (P) 24 (Figures 6A and 6B). Occasional SIRT6-deficient mice that died prior to day 20 also exhibited the same deterioration. Defects observed in these mice include acute loss of subcutaneous fat, lordokyphosis, a colitis consisting of erosion of the superficial colonic epithelium, and a severe lymphopenia associated with increased lymphocyte apoptosis (Figures 6C–6G). Indeed, flow cytometric analyses revealed a 50-fold reduction in the number of CD4+–CD8+ double-positive (DP) cells in the thymus and a 10 fold-reduction in the number of splenic lymphocytes and progenitor B cells in the bone marrow (data not shown). In addition, SIRT6−/− mice exhibited osteopenia, with 30% reduction in bone mineral density (Figure 6H), a finding consistent with the lordokyphosis. Since bones are still developi"

HSPC migration out of the BM is a critical process that underlies modern clinical stem cell transplantation. Here we demonstrate that enforced HSPC egress from BM niches depends critically on the nervous system. UDP-galactose ceramide galactosyltransferase-deficient (Cgt(-/-)) mice exhibit aberrant nerve conduction and display virtually no HSPC egress from BM following granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or fucoidan administration. Adrenergic tone, osteoblast function, and bone CXCL12 are dysregulated in Cgt(-/-) mice. Pharmacological or genetic ablation of adrenergic neurotransmission indicates that norepinephrine (NE) signaling controls G-CSF-induced osteoblast suppression, bone CXCL12 downregulation, and HSPC mobilization. Further, administration of a beta(2) adrenergic agonist enhances mobilization in both control and NE-deficient mice. Thus, these results indicate that the sympathetic nervous system regulates the attraction of stem cells to their niche."

These observations have led us to the hypothesis that Klotho and FGF23 may function via a common signal transduction pathway. In this report we show that Klotho binds to multiple FGFRs and functions as a cofactor necessary for FGF signaling activation by FGF23. Expression Vectors—Complementary DNA containing the mouse FGFRs coding region (IMAGE Clone, Invitrogen, supplemental Fig. 1) were cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) expression vector (Invitrogen). Before subcloning, a V5-epitope tag was added to the C terminus and appropriate restriction enzyme sites to the both ends using synthetic oligonucleotides and polymerase chain reaction. Expression vectors for the mouse FGF23 resistant to proteolytic inactivation (R179Q) (18Shimada T. Muto T. Urakawa I. Yoneya T. Yamazaki Y. Okawa K. Takeuchi Y. Fujita T. Fukumoto S. Yamashita T.

Cell Culture and Transfection—All cells except PC12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. PC12 cells were maintained in the same medium with additional 10% horse serum. Stable transformants of 293 cells expressing the full-length transmembrane form of Klotho (293KL) or the extracellular domain of Klotho (293KLΔTM) were isolated after selection with G418 (Invitrogen) for 14 days. Subconfluent 293, 293KL, and 293KLΔTM cells were transfected with the FGFR expression vector plasmids using the Lipofectamine transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A CHO cell line that stably expresses the full-length Klotho (CHOKL) is a gift from Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co. Ltd. (5Imura A. Iwano A. Tohyama O. Tsuji Y. Nozaki K. Hashimoto N. Fujimori T. Nabeshima Y. FEBS Lett. 2004; 565: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Adenovirus Construction—A cDNA encoding the full-length transmembrane form of mouse Klotho with a C-terminal myc-eptope tag or green fluorescent protein (GFP) was inserted into the multiple cloning site of pShuttle-CMV (Qbiogene). After linearization, the shuttle vector was introduced into an electroporation-competent Escherichia coli BJ5183-AD-1 harboring the adenoviral backbone pAdEasy-1 (Stratagene). The recombinant vector was introduced into the adenovirus packaging cell line QBI-HEK293A (Qbiogene) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). The viruses were amplified by several rounds of infection in QBI-HEK293A cells. Subconfluent HeLa cells or PC12 cells were infected with the adenovirus expressing Klotho or GFP (m.o.i. = 3 for HeLa and m.o.i. = 10 for PC12) 36 h before stimulation with FGF23 and then subjected to immunoblot analysis of FGF signaling pathway as described below. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—To prepare cell lysate, cells were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and lysed in the lysis buffer containing inhibitors for phosphatase and proteinase as described previously (2Kurosu H. Yamamoto M. Clark J.D. Pastor J.V. Nandi A. Gurnani P. McGuinness O.P. Chikuda H. Yamaguchi M. Kawaguchi H. Shimomura I. Takayama Y. Herz J. Kahn C.R. Rosenblatt K.P. Kuro-o M.

The lysate of 293KL or 293KLΔTM cells transfected with expression vectors for FGFRs was incubated with agarose beads conjugated with anti-V5 antibody (Sigma) or anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) at 4 °C for 3 h. The beads were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 1% Triton X-100 (TBST) and three times with TBS. The washed beads were suspended in SDS-sample loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The protein transferred to Hybond C Extra membrane (Amersham Biosciences) was incubated with anti-Klotho rat monoclonal antibody KM2119 (19Kato Y. Arakawa E. Kinoshita S. Shirai A. Furuya A.

The signals were detected with SuperSignal West Dura system (Pierce). For detecting Klotho binding to endogenous FGFRs in 293KL cells, cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG-agarose in the same way as described above and then immunoblotted with antibodies against FGFR1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), FGFR2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), FGFR3 (Sigma), or KM2119. Preparation of Conditioned Medium Containing FGF23 (R179Q)—Serum-free conditioned medium was prepared by transfecting 293 cells with the mouse FGF23 (R179Q) expression vector. 293KL cells were stimulated with various doses of the conditioned medium and subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-phospho-ERK antibody. The FGF23 activity in the conditioned medium was determined by comparing ERK phosphorylation with that induced by recombinant human FGF23 of known concentrations. The conditioned medium with the FGF23 activity equivalent to that of 10 ng/ml recombinant human FGF23 was used for the experiments. The same amount of serum-free conditioned medium from mock-transfected 293 cells was used as a negative control. Co-precipitation of Endogenous Klotho and FGFRs from Mouse Kidney— Kidney from a 129 mouse (200 mg) was homogenized in 2 ml of homogenizing buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors. The homogenate was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C after the addition of Triton X-100 (final 1%) and then centrifuged for 12 min at 18,000 × g two times to remove debris. The supernatant was precleared with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) conjugated with 20 μg of normal rabbit IgG for 2.5 h at 4 °C. The precleared lysate was incubated with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose conjugated with 16 μg of anti-FGFR1 antibody or normal rabbit IgG for 2.5 h at 4 °C. The beads were processed in the same way as described above for immunoblot analysis using KM2119 and anti-FGFR1 antibody. The lysate of the kidney immunoprecipitated with anti-Klotho antibody KL11-A (Alpha Diagnostic International) was used as a positive control for Klotho. The mouse FGFR1c with a V5-epitope tag expressed in 293 cells was used as a positive control for FGFR1. FGF23 Pull-down Experiments—Lysate of 293 cells or 293KL cells transfected with the FGFR expression vectors was applied to anti-V5-agarose at 4 °C for 3 h. Serum-free conditioned medium of 293 cells or 293KLΔTM cells was applied to anti-FLAG-agarose at 4 °C for 3 h. The beads were washed four times with TBST and then incubated with conditioned medium of 293 cells transfected with the mouse FGF23 (R179Q) expression vector supplemented with 0.5% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 3 h. The beads were washed three times with Krebs-Ringer-HEPES buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and then three times with the same buffer without Triton X-100. The washed beads were suspended in SDS-sample loading buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-V5 antibody, KM2119, or anti-FGF23 antibody (R&D Systems). Immunoblot Analysis of the FGF Signaling Pathway—Subconfluent 293, 293KL, and 293KLΔTM cells grown on 6-well plates were serum-starved overnight and then treated with various concentrations of recombinant human FGF23 (0, 0.1, 1, 10, or 100 ng/ml, Genzyme), acidic or basic FGF (Upstate) for 15 min. Conditioned medium of 293 cells transfected with the expression vector for mouse FGF23 (R179Q) was also used as a source of FGF23 where indicated. The cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis using antiphospho-FRS2-α antibody (Cell Signaling), anti-phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase (ERK1/2) antibody (Cell Signaling), or anti-ERK antibody (Cell Signaling). To test the hypothesis that Klotho may be involved in FGF signaling, we investigated whether Klotho could directly bind to FGFRs. Four receptor tyrosine kinases are designated as the high affinity FGFRs (FGFR1–4). Alternative RNA splicing generates multiple FGFR isoforms. The extracellular domain of FGFR1 and FGFR2 is composed of either two or three immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) ligand-binding domains. Alternative splicing in the third Ig-like domain exists in FGFR1–3, generating “b” and “c” isoforms (20Eswarakumar V.P. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar). We transfected 293KL cells that stably expressed the full-length transmembrane form of Klotho with various FGFR expression vectors and asked if any of the FGFRs would be immunoprecipitated with Klotho. Klotho bound to almost all FGFR isoforms tested (Fig. 1). However, significant difference in the ability of Klotho to co-precipitate FGFRs was observed between the isoforms: 1) c isoforms were more efficiently co-precipitated with Klotho than b isoforms. The difference between b and c isoforms is located in the C-terminal half of the third Ig-like ligand-binding domain and known to affect binding affinity to FGFs as well (21Ornitz D.M. Xu J. Colvin J.S. McEwen D.G. MacArthur C.A. Coulier F. Gao G. Goldfarb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15292-15297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). 2) FGFR2 was less efficiently co-precipitated with Klotho than FGFR1, FGFR3, and FGFR4. Thus, Klotho may bind to multiple FGFRs with different affinity. To test whether binding of Klotho to FGFRs may affect interaction between FGFRs and FGF23, the ability of FGFRs to pull down FGF23 was examined in the presence and absence of Klotho. FGF23 was pulled down with FGFR1c, -3c, and -4 only in the presence of Klotho (Fig. 2). We tested the possibility that FGF23 might directly bind to Klotho. However, the extracellular domain of Klotho alone failed to pull down FGF23 under these experimental conditions (Fig. 2). These observations indicate that FGF23 show stronger interaction with the Klotho-FGFR complex than with Klotho or FGFR alone. Since Klotho increased binding of FGF23 to FGFRs, it might enhance the ability of FGF23 to activate FGF signaling. To test this possibility, we stimulated 293KL cells or 293 cells with various concentration of recombinant human FGF23 and compared phosphorylation of FGF receptor substrate-2α (FRS2α) and p44/42 MAP kinase (ERK1/2). 3 nm (100 ng/ml) FGF23 failed to induce phosphorylation of FRS2α and ERK1/2 in 293 cells. In contrast, 0.3 nm (10 ng/ml) FGF23 activated FRS2α and ERK1/2 in 293KL cells (Fig. 3A), indicating that Klotho enhanced the cellular sensitivity to FGF23 >10 times without the help of heparin or glycosaminoglycan. The similar results were obtained using two independent 293KL clones (data not shown). In addition, we observed FGF23-induced FRS2α and ERK phosphorylation in 293KLΔTM cells (Fig. 3B), although the levels were reduced relative to those in 293KL cells. Consistent with these findings, endogenous FGFRs in 293KL cells were co-precipitated with the full-length transmembrane Klotho and, to a smaller extent, with the extracellular domain of Klotho (Fig. 3C). We also confirmed that the extracellular domain of Klotho bound to exogenously expressed FGFRs in the same pattern as the full-length Klotho did (supplemental Fig. 2). Based on these observations, we conclude that both the full-length Klotho and the extracellular domain of Klotho function as cofactors necessary for efficient activation of FGF signaling by FGF23 (Fig. 3D). The primary function of FGF23 is to suppress phosphate reabsorption in the renal tubular cells. Indeed, interaction between endogenous Klotho and FGFR was observed in the mouse kidney (supplemental Fig. 3). To test whether the activity of Klotho to enhance FGF23 action might be observed in non-kidney cells as well, we infected PC12 and HeLa cells, which originated from pheochromocytoma and cervical carcinoma, respectively, with adenovirus expressing the full-length Klotho and then stimulated with FGF23. In addition, we stimulated stable transformants of ovary-derived CHO cells expressing the full-length Klotho with FGF23. These non-kidney cells acquired the ability to respond to FGF23 when Klotho was expressed (Fig. 4). Since Klotho binds to multiple FGFRs, it may affect the activity of FGFs other than FGF23. We stimulated 293 or 293KL cells with various doses of acidic and basic FGF and found that Klotho did not enhance their ability to activate FGF signaling but slightly suppressed basic FGF action (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. 4). The fact that FGF23 requires Klotho to activate FGF signaling may explain why Klotho–/– mice develop all the phenotypes observed in Fgf23–/– mice. However, Klotho–/– mice show many phenotypes not described in Fgf23–/– mice, including arteriosclerosis, ectopic calcification in extra-renal tissues, skin atrophy, neuronal degeneration, and pulmonary emphysema (1Kuro-o M. Matsumura Y. Aizawa H. Kawaguchi H. Suga T. Utsugi T. Ohyama Y. Kurabayashi M. Kaname T. Kume E. Iwasaki H. Iida A. Shiraki-Iida T. Nishikawa S. Nagai R. Nabeshima Y. Nature. 1997; 390: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (2811) Google Scholar). This may imply that Klotho affects the activity of multiple FGFs through binding to multiple FGFRs, although the effect of Klotho on acidic and basic FGF was small when compared with its robust effect on FGF23 (supplemental Fig. 4). Precise comparison between Klotho–/– and Fgf23–/– phenotypes may provide a clue to understanding of potential effects of Klotho on the other FGFs besides FGF23. In the absence of Klotho, FGF23 requires exogenous heparin or glycosaminoglycan as a cofactor to stimulate FGF signaling (13Baum M. Schiavi S. Dwarakanath V. Quigley R.

We noticed that the upper band of Klotho was enriched when Klotho was co-precipitated with the high affinity binding partners such as FGFR1c, -3c, and -4 (Fig. 1), suggesting that a sugar chain(s) on the upper band of Klotho may facilitate interaction with these FGFRs. Furthermore, binding of FGFRs to the upper band of Klotho was associated with the ability of the Klotho-FGFR complex to pull down FGF23 (Fig. 2). It is possible that a particular sugar chain(s) on Klotho protein may be involved in the high affinity interaction between FGFRs and FGF23. We also noticed that 293KLΔTM cells predominantly expressed the lower band (supplemental Fig. 2), which might partly explain why 293KLΔTM cells showed weaker response to FGF23 than 293KL cells (Fig. 3B). The fact that the extracellular domain of Klotho can increase cellular sensitivity to FGF23 (Fig. 3B) has raised the possibility that it may function as a paracrine factor in the kidney. Since Klotho is expressed in the distal convoluted tubules (1Kuro-o M. Matsumura Y. Aizawa H. Kawaguchi H. Suga T. Utsugi T. Ohyama Y. Kurabayashi M. Kaname T. Kume E. Iwasaki H. Iida A.

It remains to be determined whether extracellular Klotho peptide could function as a paracrine and/or an endocrine factor in the regulation of FGF23 signaling. It was recently reported that mice defective in βKlotho, a protein that structurally resembles Klotho, showed increased synthesis and excretion of bile acids (22Ito S. Fujimori T. Furuya A. Satoh J.

Interestingly, these phenotypes are identical with those observed in FGFR4 knock-out mice (23Yu C. Wang F. Kan M. Jin C. Jones R.B. Weinstein M. Deng C.X. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2001784394,"DNA nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) is a predominant pathway of DNA double-strand break repair in mammalian cells, and defects in it cause radiosensitivity at the cellular and whole-organism levels. Central to NHEJ is the protein complex containing DNA Ligase IV and XRCC4. By searching for additional XRCC4-interacting factors, we identified a previously uncharacterized 33 kDa protein, XRCC4-like factor (XLF, also named Cernunnos), that has weak sequence homology with XRCC4 and is predicted to display structural similarity to XRCC4. We show that XLF directly interacts with the XRCC4-Ligase IV complex in vitro and in vivo and that siRNA-mediated downregulation of XLF in human cell lines leads to radiosensitivity and impaired NHEJ. Furthermore, we establish that NHEJ-deficient 2BN cells derived from a radiosensitive and immune-deficient patient lack XLF due to an inactivating frameshift mutation in its gene, and that reintroduction of wild-type XLF into such cells corrects their radiosensitivity and NHEJ defects. XLF thus constitutes a novel core component of the mammalian NHEJ apparatus.

The DNA double-strand break (DSB) is probably the most cytotoxic cellular lesion known, with as little as one unrepaired DSB being capable of triggering programmed cell death (Rich et al., 2000Rich T. Allen R.L. Wyllie A.H. Defying death after DNA damage.Nature. 2000; 407: 777-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). DSBs are the principle cytotoxic lesions generated by ionizing radiation (IR) and radiomimetic chemicals, can be caused by mechanical stress on chromosomes, and also arise when DNA replication forks encounter other lesions such as DNA single-strand breaks (Khanna and Jackson, 2001Khanna K.K. Jackson S.P. DNA double-strand breaks: signaling, repair and the cancer connection.Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1801) Google Scholar, Mills et al., 2003Mills K.D. Ferguson D.O. Alt F.W. The role of DNA breaks in genomic instability and tumorigenesis.Immunol. Rev. 2003; 194: 77-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Despite posing threats to genomic integrity, DSBs are nonetheless sometimes generated deliberately for a defined biological purpose. A good example of this is provided by V(D)J recombination, which takes place in developing B and T lymphocytes to provide the basis for the antigen binding diversity of the vertebrate adaptive immune system (reviewed in Gellert, 2002Gellert M. V(D)J recombination: RAG proteins, repair factors, and regulation.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Notably, inefficient or inaccurate repair of programmed or spontaneously arising DSBs can lead to mutations, dicentric or acentric chromosomal fragments and/or chromosomal translocations; and in some cases these have oncogenic potential (Difilippantonio et al., 2002Difilippantonio M.J. Petersen S. Chen H.T. Johnson R. Jasin M. Kanaar R. Ried T. Nussenzweig A. Evidence for replicative repair of DNA double-strand breaks leading to oncogenic translocation and gene amplification.J.

Ferguson D.O. Alt F.W. The role of DNA breaks in genomic instability and tumorigenesis.Immunol. Rev. 2003; 194: 77-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). There are two principle pathways for DNA DSB repair: homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ). These pathways are largely distinct from one another and function in complementary ways to bring about DSB repair (Haber, 2000Haber J.E. Partners and pathways—repairing a double-strand break.Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 259-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). During HR, the damaged chromosome enters into synapsis with an undamaged DNA molecule with which it shares extensive sequence homology: usually its sister chromatid (reviewed in Modesti and Kanaar, 2001Modesti M. Kanaar R. Homologous recombination: from model organisms to human disease.Genome Biol. 2001; 2: R1014Crossref Google Scholar, West, 2003West S.C. Molecular views of recombination proteins and their control.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). By contrast, NHEJ does not require a homologous undamaged partner DNA molecule and moreover does not need extensive sequence homologies between the recombining DNA ends (for reviews see Lieber et al., 2003Lieber M.R. Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Mechanism and regulation of human non-homologous DNA end-joining.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 712-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar and Weterings and Van Gent, 2004Weterings E. Van Gent D.C. The mechanism of non-homologous end-joining: a synopsis of synapsis.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 1425-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, while its ability to ligate essentially any two DNA ends makes NHEJ a very effective pathway of DSB repair, some end-processing is normally required before ligation, making NHEJ an intrinsically mutagenic repair mechanism. Reflecting the key importance of the NHEJ apparatus, mammalian cells bearing defects in core NHEJ components exhibit pronounced hypersensitivity toward IR and other agents that cause DSBs but not toward agents that yield other types of DNA lesions (reviewed in Lieber et al., 2004Lieber M.R. Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. The mechanism of vertebrate nonhomologous DNA end joining and its role in V(D)J recombination.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). When such NHEJ defects are manifested at the whole-animal level, they are also usually associated with defective V(D)J recombination and/or immunoglobulin class-switch recombination, causing severe combined immune-deficiency or related immunodeficiencies (Ferguson and Alt, 2001Ferguson D.O. Alt F.W. DNA double strand break repair and chromosomal translocation: lessons from animal models.Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5572-5579Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, Lieber et al., 2004Lieber M.R. Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. The mechanism of vertebrate nonhomologous DNA end joining and its role in V(D)J recombination.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). At the heart of the NHEJ apparatus in all eukaryotes studied is the enzyme DNA Ligase IV, which directly mediates DNA-strand joining by this pathway (Robins and Lindahl, 1996Robins P. Lindahl T. DNA ligase IV from HeLa cell nuclei.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24257-24261Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition to possessing a canonical DNA ligase catalytic domain, Ligase IV is distinct from other eukaryotic DNA ligases in that it possesses two tandem C-terminal BRCT domains. A key development in our understanding of Ligase IV was the discovery that it exists in a tight complex with the ∼38 kDa “adaptor” protein XRCC4 (Critchlow et al., 1997Critchlow S.E. Bowater R.P.

The XRCC4 gene encodes a novel protein involved in DNA double-strand break repair and V(D)J recombination.Cell. 1995; 83: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Structural studies have revealed that XRCC4 contains a globular N-terminal “head” domain—which might interact with other proteins and/or DNA—and a protruding helical coiled-coil region that contains a motif that interacts directly with the linker region between the two BRCT domains of Ligase IV (Grawunder et al., 1998bGrawunder U.

Biol. 2001; 8: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). XRCC4 is tightly associated with Ligase IV in vivo and is required for its stability (Bryans et al., 1999Bryans M. Valenzano M.C. Stamato T.D. Absence of DNA ligase IV protein in XR-1 cells: evidence for stabilization by XRCC4.Mut. Res. 1999; 433: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that XRCC4 stimulates Ligase IV adenylation and overall activity in vitro and in vivo (Grawunder et al., 1997Grawunder U. Wilm M. Wu X. Kulesza P. Wilson T.E. Mann M.

Subsequently, it was shown that targeted inactivation of the genes for Ligase IV or XRCC4 in mouse cells leads to radiosensitivity and NHEJ defects (Barnes et al., 1998Barnes D.E. Stamp G.

Biol. 1999; 9: 699-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). A striking feature of the Ligase IV-XRCC4 complex is that it functions in NHEJ but not in other DNA repair pathways. This specificity reflects the fact that, despite having an intrinsic capability to bind DNA, the XRCC4-Ligase IV complex is ineffective at recognizing DSBs alone and needs to be physically recruited to these sites by other NHEJ components (McElhinny et al., 2000McElhinny S.A.N. Snowden C.M. McCarville J. Ramsden D.A. Ku recruits the XRCC4-ligase IV complex to DNA ends.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2996-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, Teo and Jackson, 2000Teo S.-H. Jackson S.P. Lif1p targets the DNA ligase Lig4p to sites of DNA double-strand breaks.Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 165-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Two such proteins are the heterodimeric DNA-end binding protein Ku and the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), with which Ku associates (Smith and Jackson, 1999Smith G.C.M. Jackson S.P. The DNA-dependent protein kinase.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). The Ku heterodimer forms a ring-like structure, which binds to DNA ends and has been proposed to initiate the NHEJ process. Upon DNA-PKcs recruitment, Ku translocates inward and potentially allows DNA-PKcs to bridge the broken DNA ends and promote ligation by Ligase IV-XRCC4 (reviewed in Hefferin and Tomkinson, 2005Hefferin M.L. Tomkinson A.E. Mechanism of DNA double-strand break repair by non-homologous end joining.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2005; 4: 639-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Indeed, the XRCC4-Ligase IV complex can interact with Ku and DNA-PKcs in vitro (Chen et al., 2000Chen L. Trujillo K. Sung P. Tomkinson A.E.

The XRCC4 gene product is a target for and interacts with the DNA-dependent protein kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1794-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Other proteins implicated in mammalian NHEJ are as follows: Artemis, whose nuclease function is thought to aid the processing of V(D)J recombination intermediates and certain radiation-induced lesions before they are ligated (Moshous et al., 2001Moshous D. Callebaut I. de Chasseval R. Corneo B. Cavazzana-Calvo M. Le Deist F. Tezcan I. Sanal O. Bertrand Y. Philippe N. et al.Artemis, a novel DNA double-strand break repair/V(D)J recombination protein, is mutated in human severe combined immune deficiency.Cell. 2001; 105: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar); DNA polymerases of the Pol X family that are thought to mediate strand-filling steps in the pathway (for example, Ma et al., 2004Ma Y. Lu H. Tippin B. Goodman M.F. Shimazaki N. Koiwai O. Hsieh C.L. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. A biochemically defined system for mammalian nonhomologous DNA end joining.Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 701-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar); and polynucleotide kinase that modifies certain DNA terminal structures to permit their subsequent ligation (Chappell et al., 2002Chappell C. Hanakahi L.A. Karimi-Busheri F. Weinfeld M. West S.C. Involvement of human polynucleotide kinase in double-strand break repair by non-homologous end joining.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2827-2832Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, Koch et al., 2004Koch C.A.

Xrcc4 physically links DNA end processing by polynucleotide kinase to DNA ligation by DNA ligase IV.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3874-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Although the above factors seem in principle capable of carrying out all the known steps of NHEJ and promote ligation in vitro, it has recently become apparent that at least one additional core NHEJ component in vivo remains to be identified. Thus, work on 2BN cells—derived from a radiosensitive and immune-deficient patient—has revealed them to display a marked NHEJ deficiency that cannot be ascribed to defects in any of the known NHEJ components (Dai et al., 2003Dai Y. Kysela B. Hanakahi L.A. Manolis K. Riballo E. Stumm M. Harville T.O. West S.C. Oettinger M.A. Jeggo P.A. Nonhomologous end joining and V(D)J recombination require an additional factor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 2462-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). With this in mind, we carried out searches for factors that bind to established NHEJ components. Herein, we describe the identification of one such human protein, XLF, and demonstrate that it not only corresponds to a new core NHEJ component but is, in fact, the factor mutated in 2BN cells. Based on our biochemical observation that XLF interacts with the Ligase IV-XRCC4 complex and our findings that XLF is required for efficient repair of DNA DSBs in vivo, we discuss the likely mechanisms by which XLF promotes effective DSB repair in mammalian cells. Due to the pivotal role of XRCC4 in NHEJ, we searched for further XRCC4-interacting proteins. Thus, we conducted a LexA-based yeast two-hybrid screen with full-length XRCC4 as bait (see Experimental Procedures for details). The screen yielded 78 positive clones, out of which we have currently examined 25. Two of these positive and bait-dependent cDNA clones encoded Aprataxin, which has recently been reported to interact with XRCC4 (Clements et al., 2004Clements P.M. Breslin C. Deeks E.D. Byrd P.J. Ju L. Bieganowski P. Brenner C. Moreira M.C. Taylor A.M. Caldecott K.W. The ataxia-oculomotor apraxia 1 gene product has a role distinct from ATM and interacts with the DNA strand break repair proteins XRCC1 and XRCC4.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 1493-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Two further cDNA clones corresponded to N-terminal portions of an as-yet-uncharacterized human open reading frame (FLJ12610) that encodes a predicted full-length protein of ∼33 kDa (Figure 1A). As shown in Figure 1B, the 299 residue FLJ12610 protein is well conserved throughout vertebrate species, with stretches of particularly high sequence conservation in its N-terminal region (residues 34–79) and its middle portion (residues 120–205). The encoded protein also contains a putative nuclear localization sequence at its very C terminus (KRKK). Standard sequence homology and motif searches failed to identify any FLJ12610-related proteins other than the family of its vertebrate orthologs. Strikingly, however, sequence structure comparisons with either the Fugue algorithm (http://www-cryst.bioc.cam.ac.uk/∼fugue/; Shi et al., 2001Shi J. Blundell T.L. Mizuguchi K. FUGUE: sequence-structure homology recognition using environment-specific substitution tables and structure-dependent gap penalties.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar) or the 3D-PSSM algorithm (Fold recognition server, http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/∼3dpssm/; Kelley et al., 2000Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J. Enhanced genome annotation using structural profiles in the program 3D-PSSM.J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar) indicated that the FLJ12610 protein very likely displays a similar structural organization to XRCC4 (Figure 1C; see Table S1 and Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Indeed, when FLJ12610 and its vertebrate family members were compared to the secondary structure and fold databases of these algorithms, FLJ12610 homologs were predicted with high confidence to adopt a fold similar to the structure solved for XRCC4 (Fugue, Z score 4.75 and 4.0, 95% confidence; 3D-PSSM, E value 0.027, 95% confidence). Specifically, this analysis suggested that, like the similarly-sized XRCC4 protein, FLJ12610 encodes a protein containing an N-terminal “head” domain, with the remainder of the protein adopting a coiled-coil structure (Figure 1C). In line with these predictions, sequence comparisons revealed a low level of sequence similarity between FLJ12610 and XRCC4, particularly in the region of XRCC4 that is believed to interact with Ligase IV. In light of these findings and our other data linking FLJ12610 to XRCC4 (see below), we have given it the name “XRCC4-like factor” (XLF). To further study XLF, we raised a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the full-length recombinant protein and used this to examine XLF expression. Thus, we established that XLF is present in a wide range of human cell lines (Figure 4B and data not shown). Furthermore, indirect immunofluorescence staining revealed that XLF, like XRCC4, localizes primarily to the nucleus of human cells (Figure 1D, top). Consistent with these findings, we found that a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-XLF fusion was primarily nuclear (Figure 1D, bottom). The identification of XLF by a yeast two-hybrid screen for XRCC4 interactors suggested that XLF might functionally cooperate with the XRCC4-DNA Ligase IV complex. To begin to explore this possibility, we generated a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-XLF fusion protein in bacteria, purified this, and then used it in protein interaction studies. Thus, we found that GST-XLF efficiently retrieved both XRCC4 and Ligase IV from HeLa nuclear extract (HNE), whereas it did not bind the DNA repair and checkpoint factor Mre11 (Figure 2A) nor various other proteins analyzed (Rad50, DNA-PKcs, and SMC1; data not shown). These interactions between XLF and the XRCC4-Ligase IV were unlikely to be mediated by small amounts of DNA in the extract, as the experiments were carried out in the presence of 50 μg/ml ethidium bromide, which disrupts the majority of protein-DNA interactions. Furthermore, we found that GST-XLF pull-downs can quantitatively deplete extracts of virtually all XRCC4 and Ligase IV (data not shown). To test whether XLF can interact with the XRCC4-Ligase IV complex in vivo, we transfected 293T cells with a vector directing the expression of HA epitope-tagged XLF, made extracts from these, and tested for the presence of HA-XLF, XRCC4, and Ligase IV in anti-HA immunoprecipitates. As shown in Figure 2B, XRCC4 and Ligase IV indeed coimmunoprecipitated with HA-XLF but were not present in control immunoprecipitates with anti-GFP antibodies, nor were they found in HA-immunoprecipitates from extracts of cells transfected with the parental vector (pCDNA3.1). Moreover, we established that endogenous XLF in HNE is associated with XRCC4 (Figure 2C) and Ligase IV (Figure 2D), as both these proteins were specifically coimmunoprecipitated with the rabbit anti-XLF antibody. The XRCC4-XLF interaction was also confirmed in reciprocal immunoprecipitations with a mouse anti-XRCC4 antibody (Figure 2E). Interestingly, we found as a result of cotransfection studies that HA-tagged XLF could be immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG epitope-tag antibody when it was expressed in cells together with FLAG-tagged XLF (Figure 2F; no HA-XLF was precipitated by anti-FLAG antibody in the absence of FLAG-XLF; data not shown). This suggests that multiple XLF proteins interact with the XRCC4-Ligase IV complex and/or that XLF can exist as multimers, as is the case for XRCC4 itself (Junop et al., 2000Junop M.S. Modesti M.

Taken together, the above data reveal that XLF behaves as a bona fide component of the XRCC4-Ligase IV complex. In light of the above data, we speculated that XLF might be involved in the NHEJ pathway of DSB repair. To test this idea, we developed two independent siRNA double-stranded oligonucleotides that target XLF—XLFsi(1) and XLFsi(2)—and showed that each was capable of efficiently downregulating XLF protein levels in human U2OS cells (Figure 3A, top and bottom panels). As a control for subsequent studies, we used an siRNA oligonucleotide that efficiently downregulated XRCC4 (Figure 3A, top). Downregulation of XRCC4 also led to decreased Ligase IV levels, which confirms previous reports indicating that XRCC4 is required for normal Ligase IV protein stability (Bryans et al., 1999Bryans M. Valenzano M.C. Stamato T.D. Absence of DNA ligase IV protein in XR-1 cells: evidence for stabilization by XRCC4.Mut.

Biol. 2000; 10: 165-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Strikingly, we found that cells downregulated for XLF were markedly more radiosensitive than cells downregulated with control siRNA oligonucleotides (Figure 3B). Moreover, the radiosensitivity of XLF-depleted cells was equivalent to that of cells downregulated for XRCC4 (Figure 3B). In line with the above findings, we found that downregulation of XLF also sensitized cells to Bleocin, a drug that generates a high yield of DNA DSBs; and again, the degree of sensitization caused by XLF depletion was similar to that achieved by XRCC4 downregulation (Figure 3C). Taken together, these results indicate that XLF is required for cellular survival in response to DSB-generating agents and furthermore support the contention that XLF and XRCC4 function in the same pathway. NHEJ is a predominant DSB pathway in mammalian cells and is crucial for the efficient random integration of plasmid DNA into the genome of human tissue culture cells (Lou et al., 2004Lou Z. Chen B.P. Asaithamby A. Minter-Dykhouse K. Chen D.J. Chen J. MDC1 regulates DNA-PK autophosphorylation in response to DNA damage.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46359-46362Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, we found that random plasmid integration was markedly impaired in cells downregulated for XRCC4 (Figure 3D). Moreover, downregulation of XLF reduced integration efficiencies to levels comparable to those caused by XRCC4 depletion (Figure 3D). These findings strongly suggested that XLF, like XRCC4, is crucial for DNA DSB repair by NHEJ. To verify this, we used pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to monitor the repair of IR-induced DSBs in vivo. Thus, we transfected U2OS cells with siRNAs targeting XLF, XRCC4, or GFP, and after allowing time for protein downregulation, we treated the cells with 80 Gy of IR. While cells transfected with the control siRNA were able to repair most DSBs quickly after irradiation (loss of the faster-migrating DNA signal), cells downregulated for XLF or XRCC4 displayed much higher levels of broken DNA molecules migrating into the gel, and this was the case both at early and later time points (Figure 3E). These data therefore indicate that both XLF and XRCC4 are required for normal DNA NHEJ as measured by this assay. To further study the requirement of XLF for DSB repair, we analyzed the phosphorylation of histone H2AX on Ser 139 (γH2AX) in response to IR. It has previously been established that phosphorylation of H2AX correlates with DSB formation (Rogakou et al., 1998Rogakou E.P. Pilch"

https://openalex.org/W2049534933,"Acceleration of particles by intense laser-plasma interactions represents a rapidly evolving field of interest, as highlighted by the recent demonstration of laser-driven relativistic beams of monoenergetic electrons. Ultrahigh-intensity lasers can produce accelerating fields of 10 TV m(-1) (1 TV = 10(12) V), surpassing those in conventional accelerators by six orders of magnitude. Laser-driven ions with energies of several MeV per nucleon have also been produced. Such ion beams exhibit unprecedented characteristics--short pulse lengths, high currents and low transverse emittance--but their exponential energy spectra have almost 100% energy spread. This large energy spread, which is a consequence of the experimental conditions used to date, remains the biggest impediment to the wider use of this technology. Here we report the production of quasi-monoenergetic laser-driven C5+ ions with a vastly reduced energy spread of 17%. The ions have a mean energy of 3 MeV per nucleon (full-width at half-maximum approximately 0.5 MeV per nucleon) and a longitudinal emittance of less than 2 x 10(-6) eV s for pulse durations shorter than 1 ps. Such laser-driven, high-current, quasi-monoenergetic ion sources may enable significant advances in the development of compact MeV ion accelerators, new diagnostics, medical physics, inertial confinement fusion and fast ignition."
https://openalex.org/W2125575901,"In the favoured core-accretion model of formation of planetary systems, solid planetesimals accumulate to build up planetary cores, which then accrete nebular gas if they are sufficiently massive. Around M-dwarf stars (the most common stars in our Galaxy), this model favours the formation of Earth-mass to Neptune-mass planets with orbital radii of 1 to 10 astronomical units (AU), which is consistent with the small number of gas giant planets known to orbit M-dwarf host stars. More than 170 extrasolar planets have been discovered with a wide range of masses and orbital periods, but planets of Neptune's mass or less have not hitherto been detected at separations of more than 0.15 AU from normal stars. Here we report the discovery of a 5.5 (+5.5/-2.7) M_earth planetary companion at a separation of 2.6 (+1.5/-0.6) AU from a 0.22 (+0.21/-0.11) M_solar M-dwarf star. (We propose to name it OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb, indicating a planetary mass companion to the lens star of the microlensing event.) The mass is lower than that of GJ876d, although the error bars overlap. Our detection suggests that such cool, sub-Neptune-mass planets may be more common than gas giant planets, as predicted by the core accretion theory."

Here we show that the homeodomain proteins Lmx1a and Msx1 function as determinants of midbrain dopamine neurons, cells that degenerate in patients with Parkinson's disease. Lmx1a is sufficient and required to trigger dopamine cell differentiation. An early activity of Lmx1a is to induce the expression of Msx1, which complements Lmx1a by inducing the proneural protein Ngn2 and neuronal differentiation. Importantly, expression of Lmx1a in embryonic stem cells results in a robust generation of dopamine neurons with a “correct” midbrain identity. These data establish that Lmx1a and Msx1 are critical intrinsic dopamine-neuron determinants in vivo and suggest that they may be essential tools in cell replacement strategies in Parkinson's disease.

These data establish that Lmx1a and Msx1 are critical intrinsic dopamine-neuron determinants in vivo and suggest that they may be essential tools in cell replacement strategies in Parkinson's disease. Most classes of neurons that constitute the central nervous system (CNS) are generated during embryonic development in response to local inductive cues. Such signals regulate gene expression in responding neural progenitors, which results in the generation of specific neuronal subtypes at defined positions of the developing CNS (Jessell, 2000Jessell T.M. Neuronal specification in the spinal cord: inductive signals and transcriptional codes.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2000; 1: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar). Mesencephalic dopamine (DA) neurons, which degenerate in patients with Parkinson's disease, are derived from progenitors located at the ventral midline of the midbrain, while progenitors at adjacent lateral positions generate motor neurons or different types of interneurons (Hynes and Rosenthal, 1999Hynes M. Rosenthal A. Specification of dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons in the vertebrate CNS.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Characterization of the molecular program that controls the generation of DA neurons during development is likely to facilitate the engineering of DA neurons from stem cells that, in turn, may be critical for development of stem cell-based therapies for Parkinson's disease. Factors that control cell patterning and the generation of DA neurons in the ventral midbrain (vMB) remain poorly defined. The induction of DA neurons depends on Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling by ventral midline cells and the activity of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family member 8 (FGF8), secreted by the isthmic organizer (Hynes and Rosenthal, 1999Hynes M.

The primary role of these signaling molecules is to establish a vMB identity at initial stages of neural development. Several characterized transcription factors, including Nurr1, Pitx3, En, and Lmx1b, are involved in the maturation of postmitotic DA neurons but not in the initial specification of these cells (Nunes et al., 2003Nunes I.

Intrinsic determinants acting downstream of Shh and upstream of transcription factors influencing the maturation of DA neurons should exist but have not yet been identified. A unique property of DA neurons is their generation from the midline of the vMB, which is initially occupied by Shh-expressing glial-like floor-plate cells (Placzek and Briscoe, 2005Placzek M. Briscoe J. The floor plate: multiple cells, multiple signals.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 230-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, Placzek et al., 1990Placzek M. Tessier-Lavigne M.

Dodd J. Induction of floor plate differentiation by contact-dependent, homeogenetic signals.Development. 1993; 117: 205-218PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in contrast to most other neurons, the generation of DA neurons must be preceded by a conversion of floor-plate cells into neuronal progenitor cells. How such a conversion occurs, and the identity of factors controlling the transition, is another unresolved question. Studies of the developing spinal cord have provided insights into basic strategies of neuronal cell-fate specification (Jessell, 2000Jessell T.M. Neuronal specification in the spinal cord: inductive signals and transcriptional codes.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2000; 1: 20-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar). At this level, Shh regulates the expression pattern of a set of homeodomain (HD) transcription factors in ventral progenitor cells (Briscoe et al., 2000Briscoe J. Pierani A. Jessell T.M. Ericson J. A homeodomain protein code specifies progenitor cell identity and neuronal fate in the ventral neural tube.Cell. 2000; 101: 435-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). These HD proteins, in turn, control the positional generation of motor neurons and interneurons by activating specific downstream genes that establish the subtype identity of postmitotic neurons (Briscoe et al., 2000Briscoe J.

Control of interneuron fate in the developing spinal cord by the progenitor homeodomain protein Dbx1.Neuron. 2001; 29: 367-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). It seems likely that midbrain DA neurons are specified by similar mechanisms. Based on this assumption, we identified and characterized HD proteins expressed in midbrain DA neuron progenitor cells. We show that Lmx1a and Msx1 are selectively expressed in DA cell progenitors in the vMB and that these HD proteins are critically involved in the process of DA cell-fate specification. Moreover, we provide evidence that Lmx1a and Msx1 can be exploited as tools to engineer DA neurons from stem cells. To identify HD proteins expressed in DA progenitor cells in the vMB, embryonic day (E) 10.5 mouse embryo vMB cDNA was used as a template to screen for HD-encoding transcripts by PCR. This approach, combined with a large-scale in situ hybridization screen, identified Lmx1a and Msx1 as two transcription factors with relevant expression patterns. Whole-mount in situ hybridization at E11.5 showed that Lmx1a and Msx1 were both expressed in the vMB and at the caudalmost part of the diencephalon (Figures 1A and 1B). We applied immunohistochemistry to further examine the expression of Lmx1a and Msx1 relative to defined markers of postmitotic DA neurons, including Nurr1, Lmx1b, Pitx3, and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in DA synthesis (Figures 1F–1K and 1V; data not shown). At E12.5, a stage when DA neurons are actively generated, Lmx1a and Msx1 were coexpressed in DA progenitors located immediately above differentiating DA neurons (Figures 1C–1F). Expression of Lmx1a was maintained in postmitotic Nurr1+/TH+ DA neurons (Figures 1C and 1D), while Msx1 expression was exclusively confined to mitotic DA progenitors that had not yet initiated expression of Nurr1 and TH (Figures 1C, 1E, and 1F). Lmx1a was expressed prior to Msx1 and was first detected in ventral midline cells at E9 (Figure 1G). At this stage, Lmx1a was coexpressed with Nkx6.1, a HD protein that is broadly expressed in ventral progenitor cells (Vallstedt et al., 2001Vallstedt A. Muhr J. Pattyn A. Pierani A. Mendelsohn M. Sander M. Jessell T.M. Ericson J. Different levels of repressor activity assign redundant and specific roles to Nkx6 genes in motor neuron and interneuron specification.Neuron. 2001; 31: 743-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), including motor neuron progenitors located lateral to DA progenitors (Figure 1K). From E9.5 and onward, the expression of Nkx6.1 was progressively extinguished in presumptive DA progenitor cells (Figures 1K–1R). The downregulation of Nkx6.1 expression correlated precisely with the initiation of Msx1 expression at E9.5 (Figures 1O–1R). Msx2 was also expressed in a pattern similar to Msx1 but at lower levels (data not shown). Lmx1b is structurally related to Lmx1a and has previously been implicated in the maturation of DA neurons (Smidt et al., 2000Smidt M.P. Asbreuk C.H. Cox J.J. Chen H. Johnson R.L. Burbach J.P. A second independent pathway for development of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons requires Lmx1b.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). While expressed in vMB progenitors, Lmx1b was not restricted to DA progenitors at early developmental stages (Figures 1S–1V). Also, expression of Lmx1b was downregulated in DA progenitors at E11.5, approximately 2 days before the cessation of midbrain DA neuron generation, while the expression of Lmx1a and Msx1 was maintained throughout this period (Figure 1V; data not shown). Thus, the expression patterns of Lmx1a and Msx1, but not that of Lmx1b, correlate with DA neuron specification. Taken together, a Lmx1a+/Msx1+/Nkx6.1− expression profile defines DA progenitor cells in the vMB. The vMB expression of Lmx1a and Msx1/2 implies that they are induced in response to ventrally derived Shh. To test this assumption, the ability of Shh to induce Lmx1a and Msx1/2 was examined in naive intermediate neural-plate explants isolated from the presumptive forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain levels of the chick neural plate ([i]F, [i]M, [i]H; Figure 2A). Lmx1a and Msx1 were expressed in a fashion similar to in mouse embryos in the vMB of developing chick embryos (Figures 2B–2E). Expression of Otx1, En1, and Gbx2 was examined to monitor the anterior-posterior (AP) identities of explants in these experiments (see Figure S1A in the Supplemental Data available with this article online) (Martinez, 2001Martinez S. The isthmic organizer and brain regionalization.Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2001; 45: 367-371PubMed Google Scholar). In control [i]F, [i]M, and [i]H explants grown for 24 hr in vitro, cells expressed the dorsal progenitor marker Pax7 but not Lmx1a, Msx1/2, or the ventral progenitor marker Nkx2.2 (Figure 2F; data not shown) (Briscoe et al., 1999Briscoe J. Sussel L. Serup P. Hartigan-O'Connor D. Jessell T.M. Rubenstein J.L. Ericson J. Homeobox gene Nkx2.2 and specification of neuronal identity by graded Sonic hedgehog signalling.Nature. 1999; 398: 622-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Exposure of explants to 15 nM Shh resulted in ventralization of progenitor-cell identity as determined by extinction of Pax7 expression and induction of Nkx2.2 (Figure 2G). Notably, under this condition, Lmx1a and Msx1/2 were induced only in midbrain explants preceding the expression of the late DA cell markers Nurr1 and TH (Figure 2G). Together, these data indicate that the ventral induction of Lmx1a and Msx1 depends on Shh signaling and that the ability of Shh to induce these factors is restricted along the AP axis. We next examined whether Lmx1a and/or Msx1 can induce ectopic DA neurons in the chick midbrain. Lmx1a- and Msx1-encoding cDNAs were inserted into retroviral RCAS vectors. Expression vectors were unilaterally transfected into the midbrain of HH stage 10 chick embryos by in ovo electroporation, and embryos were harvested after 60–110 hr of incubation (Briscoe et al., 2000Briscoe J. Pierani A. Jessell T.M. Ericson J. A homeodomain protein code specifies progenitor cell identity and neuronal fate in the ventral neural tube.Cell. 2000; 101: 435-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Interestingly, transfection of Lmx1a, but not Msx1, resulted in extensive induction of ectopic DA neurons in the vMB as indicated by the induction of Nurr1, Lmx1b, and TH (Figures 3A–3E). Induction of DA neurons by Lmx1a was preceded by a respecification of progenitor-cell identity as indicated by induction of Msx1 and suppression of Nkx6.1 expression in lateral progenitor cells (Figures 3F–3I). Also, the number of Lim1/2+ neurons that are normally generated lateral to DA neurons was reduced, indicating that the induction of DA neurons by Lmx1a is accompanied by a loss of other ventral neuronal subtypes (Figure 3J and 3K). Together, these data show that Lmx1a, but not Msx1, is sufficient to induce ectopic DA neurons in the midbrain. Moreover, in line with the sequential induction of Lmx1a and Msx1 observed in mice, these data provide evidence that Lmx1a activates the expression of Msx1 in DA progenitor cells. Forced expression of Lmx1a in dorsal Pax7+ progenitors did not result in the induction of Nurr1+/Lmx1b+ DA neurons despite its ability to induce Msx1 also in the dorsal midbrain (Figure 3M and 3N) (Chizhikov and Millen, 2004bChizhikov V.V. Millen K.J. Control of roof plate formation by Lmx1a in the developing spinal cord.Development. 2004; 131: 2693-2705Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, since the competence of Lmx1a to induce DA neurons is limited to ventral progenitor cells, it is possible that ongoing Shh signaling, or an as yet unidentified Shh-induced activity, may act in parallel to Lmx1a in the induction of these cells. Alternatively, Shh signaling could repress a factor that suppresses the DA cell differentiation program. To test whether Lmx1a is required for the generation of DA neurons, we used siRNA to knock down Lmx1a in the chick vMB. While ventral progenitor-cell expression of Lmx1b was unaffected, Lmx1a was virtually extinguished at 72 hr posttransfection (hpt) of an Lmx1a siRNA (Figures 4B and 4F). In contrast, dorsal expression of Lmx1a was unaffected (Figure 4L). Strikingly, the elimination of Lmx1a resulted in abolished progenitor Msx1 expression and a drastic reduction of postmitotic Nurr1+/Lmx1b+ DA neurons (Figures 4D, 4F, and 4H). In contrast, the generation of Isl1+ motor neurons and Lim1/2+ interneurons was unaltered (Figure 4J; data not shown). Transfection of a control siRNA did not affect the expression of any analyzed marker (Figures 4A, 4C, 4E, 4G, 4I, and 4K). This loss-of-function experiment reveals a requirement for Lmx1a in the generation of DA neurons and also suggests that Lmx1b cannot compensate for the loss of Lmx1a. Our data show that Msx1 alone is not sufficient to induce DA neurons, raising the issue of its function in DA progenitors (Figure 3A). Patterning HD proteins often function as Groucho/TLE-dependent transcriptional repressors (Muhr et al., 2001Muhr J. Andersson E. Persson M. Jessell T.M. Ericson J. Groucho-mediated transcriptional repression establishes progenitor cell pattern and neuronal fate in the ventral neural tube.Cell. 2001; 104: 861-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis revealed that Msx1, but not Lmx1a, contained a putative Groucho/TLE binding eh1 domain, supporting previous data showing that Msx1 can function as a transcriptional repressor (Catron et al., 1995Catron K.M. Zhang H. Marshall S.C. Inostroza J.A. Wilson J.M. Abate C. Transcriptional repression by Msx-1 does not require homeodomain DNA-binding sites.Mol. Cell.

Groucho-mediated transcriptional repression establishes progenitor cell pattern and neuronal fate in the ventral neural tube.Cell. 2001; 104: 861-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Indeed, Msx1 functioned as a Groucho/TLE-dependent repressor in a reporter-gene assay in transfected COS-7 cells (Figure 5A). Msx1 could also interact with a bacterially produced GST-Groucho in vitro (Figure S2). In contrast, Lmx1a did not repress transcription (Figure 5A). Instead, Lmx1a functioned as a transcriptional activator whose activity was enhanced by cotransfection of the LIM-domain binding coactivator Ldb1 (Figure 5B). The gradual extinction of Nkx6.1 expression in DA progenitors correlates with the induction of Msx1 expression (Figures 1O–1Q). We therefore assessed whether Msx1 functions as a Nkx6.1 repressor in vivo. Transfected embryos were analyzed at 20 hpt, a time point when endogenous expression of Msx1 had not been initiated (Figures 5C–5J). To ensure rapid expression, we used an Msx1 expression vector driven by a viral SV40 early promoter (pECE). Expression of Msx1 had essentially extinguished Nkx6.1 expression in vMB progenitors at 20 hpt (Figures 5D and 5F). Nkx6.1 is required for the generation for motor neurons in the spinal cord (Vallstedt et al., 2001Vallstedt A. Muhr J. Pattyn A. Pierani A. Mendelsohn M. Sander M. Jessell T.M. Ericson J. Different levels of repressor activity assign redundant and specific roles to Nkx6 genes in motor neuron and interneuron specification.Neuron. 2001; 31: 743-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and we noted that forced expression of Msx1 reduced the number of Isl1/2+ motor neurons in the vMB (data not shown). Together, these data show that Msx1 is a repressor of Nkx6.1 expression and suggest that Msx1 functions to suppress alternative ventral cell fates in the DA progenitor domain. As shown above, Lmx1a can also repress Nkx6.1 expression (Figure 3I). However, since Lmx1a induces Msx1, it appears likely that Lmx1a-mediated suppression of Nkx6.1 is indirect. Indeed, transfection of pECE-Lmx1a did not result in the repression of Nkx6.1 at 20 hpt, a time point when Lmx1a had not yet induced Msx1 (Figure 5E; data not shown). We next considered the consequences of combined Lmx1a and Msx1 expression in vMB progenitors. Remarkably, cotransfection of pECE-Msx1 and pECE-Lmx1a induced Nurr1+ cells already at 60 hpt, a stage when Nurr1+ cells had not yet been generated on the untransfected control side (Figure 5J). At this early time point, forced expression of Lmx1a alone had not yet induced Nurr1+ cells, and expression of Msx1 alone did not induce Nurr1 (Figures 5H and 5I). Thus, Msx1 appears to influence the timing of DA neuron induction when coexpressed with Lmx1a. The ventral midline of the midbrain is occupied by glial-like Shh+ floor-plate cells prior to the generation of DA neurons (Placzek and Briscoe, 2005Placzek M. Briscoe J. The floor plate: multiple cells, multiple signals.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 230-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, Placzek et al., 1993Placzek M. Jessell T.M. Dodd J. Induction of floor plate differentiation by contact-dependent, homeogenetic signals.Development. 1993; 117: 205-218PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the generation of DA neurons must be preceded by a glial-to-neuronal conversion. Consistent with such a transition, the proneural basic helix-loop-helix protein Ngn2 (Bertrand et al., 2002Bertrand N. Castro D.S. Guillemot F. Proneural genes and the specification of neural cell types.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar) begins to be expressed at the ventral midline of the midbrain at around E10.75, and the expression of Shh becomes downregulated in DA progenitors at E11.5 (Figures 6A–6D). Since our experiments indicate that Msx1 influences the timing of DA neuron production, it seemed possible that Msx1 mediates the suppression of floor-plate characteristics and induces neuronal differentiation in ventral midline cells. To test this possibility, Msx1 was prematurely expressed in transgenic mice using a Shh enhancer (ShhE) (Epstein et al., 1999Epstein D.J. McMahon A.P. Joyner A.L. Regionalization of Sonic hedgehog transcription along the anteroposterior axis of the mouse central nervous system is regulated by Hnf3-dependent and -independent mechanisms.Development. 1999; 126: 281-292PubMed Google Scholar), which is active at least 24 hr before induction of endogenous Msx1 expression in the vMB. Strikingly, premature activation of Msx1 resulted in rapid extinction of Nkx6.1 expression and a marked induction of Ngn2 expression in ventral midline cells already at E9–E9.25 (Figures 6E–6J). Notably, premature Msx1 expression did not affect the induction of Lmx1a (Figures 6G and 6H). The early activation of Ngn2 was accompanied by premature induction of additional markers. Thus, the panneuronal marker Nsg1 and the DA-specific markers Nurr1, Pitx3, and TH were expressed already at E10.5 (Figures 6K–6R). Moreover, the premature induction of DA neurons in ShhE-Msx1 transgenic embryos was associated with a marked downregulation of Shh expression in ventral midline cells already at E10.5 (Figures 6U and 6V). In conclusion, premature induction of Msx1 results in upregulation of Ngn2 expression, a loss of floor-plate characteristics, and premature induction of DA neurons, suggesting that Msx1 controls the timing of DA cell neurogenesis. To examine whether Msx1 is also required for the proper generation of DA neurons, we analyzed Msx1 knockout mouse embryos (Houzelstein et al., 1997Houzelstein D. Cohen A. Buckingham M.E. Robert B. Insertional mutation of the mouse Msx1 homeobox gene by an nlacZ reporter gene.Mech. Dev. 1997; 65: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). At E11.5, Nkx6.1 expression was not completely extinguished in the ventral midline of Msx1 mutant embryos (Figure S3). The progenitor-cell expression of Msx2 and Lmx1a appeared unaffected by the loss of Msx1 function (Figure S3; data not shown). Moreover, as compared to littermate controls, a 40% reduction in the number of Ngn2+ progenitor cells and Nurr1+ DA neurons was observed in mutants (Figure S3). These data support our gain-of-function experiments and reveal a requirement of Msx1 for the proper production of DA neurons in the midbrain. Since DA neurons still can be generated in Msx1 mutants, however, it is feasible that Msx2 or another unidentified activity can partly compensate for the loss of Msx1 in this process. We next examined the ability of Lmx1a, Msx1, and Lmx1b to induce DA cell differentiation in cultured mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells. In these experiments, Lmx1a, Msx1, and Lmx1b cDNAs and an eGFP control were inserted into expression vectors driven by a Nestin enhancer (NesE) (Lothian and Lendahl, 1997Lothian C. Lendahl U. An evolutionarily conserved region in the second intron of the human nestin gene directs gene expression to CNS progenitor cells and to early neural crest cells.Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 452-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The Nestin enhancer is active in neuronal progenitor cells, but not in undifferentiated mES cells or in postmitotic neurons (data not shown). Undifferentiated mES cells were transfected and differentiated into Nestin+ neuronal progenitors by plating on gelatin-coated culture plates in medium containing FGF2, FGF8, and low concentration of Shh (1.7 nM) (Ying et al., 2003Ying Q.L. Stavridis M. Griffiths D. Li M. Smith A. Conversion of embryonic stem cells into neuroectodermal precursors in adherent monoculture.Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, mES cells transfected with the NesE-eGFP generated neural progenitors that expressed En1/2 and Nkx6.1 but not Pax7, Msx1, or Lmx1a (Figures 7A and 7D). Thus, mES cells exposed to FGF2, FGF8, and low concentrations of Shh adopt an identity of ventral progenitors at the midbrain/rostral hindbrain level of the neuraxis. After 8 days of culture, most cells had differentiated into TuJ1+ postmitotic neurons, but none of these cells expressed TH (Figure 7B). Strikingly, transfection of a NesE-Lmx1a vector resulted in an extensive induction of Msx1/2+ cells (and a reduction of Nkx6.1+ cells) after 4–5 days and a robust generation of TuJ1+ neurons that coexpressed TH after 8 days of culture (Figures 7A, 7B, and 7D). Only a few TH+ neurons could be detected after transfection with NesE-Lmx1b, showing that Lmx1a is a much more potent inducer of TH+ neurons (Figure 7D). Importantly, essentially all Lmx1a-induced TH+ neurons coexpressed Nurr1, Pitx3, En1/2, Lmx1a, Lmx1b, and the dopamine transporter (DAT; Figures 7C and 7E; data not shown), a profile of gene expression unique to midbrain DA neurons. Note that Lmx1a expression detected after 8 days corresponds to endogenous protein (Figure 7C; data not shown). Also, almost no Lmx1a-induced TH+ cells were positive for GABA, a neurotransmitter that is not expressed by midbrain DA neurons (Figures 7C and 7E). Consistent with our in vivo observations, Lmx1a was only competent to induce DA neurons in cells that had been ventralized by Shh. When mES cells were cultured in the absence of Shh, mES cell-derived neural progenitors expressed the dorsal progenitor-cell marker Pax7 (Figure 7A). Under these conditions, NesE-Lmx1a induced Msx1/2 expression but no TH+ neurons (Figures 7A and 7B). Together, these data provide strong evidence that Lmx1a can induce the generation of bona fide midbrain DA neurons from ventralized mES-derived neural progenitor cells. Although coexpression of TH, Nurr1, Lmx1a, Lmx1b, En1/2, and DAT defines midbrain DA neurons, these factors are also individually expressed in other neuronal subtypes in the developing CNS (Asbreuk et al., 2002Asbreuk C.H.

Studies suggest that plant respiratory metabolism also scales as the (3/4)-power of mass, and that higher plant and animal scaling follow similar rules owing to the predominance of fractal-like transport networks and associated allometric scaling. Here, however, using data obtained from about 500 laboratory and field-grown plants from 43 species and four experiments, we show that whole-plant respiration rate scales approximately isometrically (scaling exponent approximately 1) with total plant mass in individual experiments and has no common relation across all data. Moreover, consistent with theories about biochemically based physiological scaling, isometric scaling of whole-plant respiration rate to total nitrogen content is observed within and across all data sets, with a single relation common to all data. This isometric scaling is unaffected by growth conditions including variation in light, nitrogen availability, temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration, and is similar within or among species or functional groups. These findings suggest that plants and animals follow different metabolic scaling relations, driven by distinct mechanisms."

To learn how C. elegans Dicer, DCR-1, functions in multiple distinct silencing mechanisms, we used a mass-spectrometry-based proteomics approach to identify DCR-1-interacting proteins. We then generated and characterized deletion alleles for the corresponding genes. The interactors are required for production of three species of small RNA, including (1) small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), derived from exogenous dsRNA triggers (exo-siRNAs); (2) siRNAs derived from endogenous triggers (endo-siRNAs); and (3) developmental regulatory microRNAs (miRNAs). One interactor, the conserved RNA-phosphatase homolog PIR-1, is required for the processing of a putative amplified DCR-1 substrate. Interactors required for endo-siRNA production include ERI-1 and RRF-3, whose loss of function enhances RNAi. Our findings provide a first glimpse at the complex biochemical niche of Dicer and suggest that competition exists between DCR-1-mediated small-RNA pathways."

Furthermore, increased vitamin D activities in homozygous mutants are associated with severe atherosclerosis and widespread soft tissue calcifications; ablation of vitamin D activity from Fgf-23-/- mice, by genetically deleting the 1alpha(OH)ase gene, eliminates atherosclerosis and ectopic calcifications and significantly rescues premature aging-like features of Fgf-23-/- mice, resulting in prolonged survival of Fgf-23-/-/1alpha(OH)ase-/- double mutants. Our results indicate a novel role of Fgf-23 in developing premature aging-like features through regulating vitamin D homeostasis.

https://openalex.org/W2012914676,"Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) provides the cell with a balanced supply of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTP) for DNA synthesis. In budding yeast DNA damage leads to an up-regulation of RNR activity and an increase in dNTP pools, which are essential for survival. Mammalian cells contain three non-identical subunits of RNR; that is, one homodimeric large subunit, R1, carrying the catalytic site and two variants of the homodimeric small subunit, R2 and the p53-inducible p53R2, each containing a tyrosyl free radical essential for catalysis. S-phase-specific DNA replication is supported by an RNR consisting of the R1 and R2 subunits. In contrast, DNA damage induces expression of the R1 and the p53R2 subunits. We now show that neither logarithmically growing nor Go/G1-synchronized mammalian cells show any major increase in their dNTP pools after DNA damage. However, non-dividing fibroblasts expressing the p53R2 protein, but not the R2 protein, have reduced dNTP levels if exposed to the RNR-specific inhibitor hydroxyurea, strongly indicating that there is ribonucleotide reduction in resting cells. The slow, 4-fold increase in p53R2 protein expression after DNA damage results in a less than 2-fold increase in the dNTP pools in Go/G1 cells, where the pools are about 5% that of the size of the pools in S-phase cells.

The rate-limiting step in the formation of DNA precursors is the de novo reduction of ribonucleoside diphosphates to the corresponding deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates by the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) (1Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). In S phase, the mammalian RNR enzyme is composed of the homodimeric R1 and R2 subunits, which together form a heterotetrameric active enzyme. The large R1 protein (90 kDa) carries the active site, whereas the small R2 protein (45 kDa) contains a diferric iron center generating a tyrosyl free radical necessary for catalysis (1Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 2Thelander L. Gräslund A. Metal Ions in Biological Systems.in: Sigel H. Sigel A. 30. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1994: 109-129Google Scholar). An additional mammalian RNR protein, p53R2, was identified in 2000 (3Tanaka H. Arakawa H. Yamaguchi T. Shiraishi K. Fukuda S. Matsui K.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4283-4289Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Like the homologous R2 protein, p53R2 contains a tyrosyl free radical and forms an active RNR complex with the R1 protein in vitro (5Guittet O. Håkansson P. Voevodskaya N. Fridd S. Gräslund A.

S. A. 2003; 100: 3925-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In cycling cells, the S-phase-dependent activity of the RNR complex is limited by the expression and degradation of R2 protein, whereas the R1 protein is present throughout the cell cycle (13Engstrom Y. Eriksson S. Jildevik I. Skog S. Thelander L. Tribukait B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9114-9116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).One unanswered question is how mammalian cells in Go/G1 phase with no R2 protein obtain dNTPs for DNA repair and mitochondrial DNA replication. One possible answer might be by salvage of deoxyribonucleosides. Mammalian cells have four kinases for salvage of deoxyribonucleosides: thymidine kinase 1 and 2, deoxyguanosine kinase, and deoxycytidine kinase (14Sandrini M.P.B. Piskur J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 225-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Three of these, thymidine kinase 2 (mitochondrial), deoxyguanosine kinase (mitochondrial), and deoxycytidine kinase (cytoplasmic), are not cell cycle-specific and could theoretically salvage deoxyribonucleosides in a resting cell (14Sandrini M.P.B. Piskur J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 225-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Another way of obtaining dNTPs is through ribonucleotide reduction. In contrast to the S-phase-specific R2 protein, the R1 protein has a long half-life and is detectable outside the S phase in proliferating cells (13Engstrom Y. Eriksson S. Jildevik I. Skog S. Thelander L. Tribukait B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9114-9116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Mann G.J. Musgrove E.A. Fox R.M. Thelander L. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 5151-5156PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in addition to the S-phase-specific transcription of the R1 gene, this gene has also been found to be transcribed and translated in response to DNA damage in resting mouse fibroblasts (5Guittet O. Håkansson P. Voevodskaya N. Fridd S. Gräslund A. Arakawa H. Nakamura Y. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 274: 40647-40651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (161) Google Scholar). As with the R1 protein, expression of the p53R2 protein is induced by DNA damage (3Tanaka H. Arakawa H. Yamaguchi T. Shiraishi K. Fukuda S. Matsui K. Takei Y. Nakamura Y.

The induction is mediated by the tumor suppressor protein p53, a downstream target of the ATM/ATR Chk1/Chk2 kinase pathways (16Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2619) Google Scholar). The p53 protein homolog p73 has also been shown to induce p53R2 expression after DNA damage (4Nakano K. Bálint E. Ashcroft M. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4283-4289Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Knock-out mice lacking a functional p53R2 gene died from severe renal failure by the age of 14 weeks (17Kimura T. Takeda S. Sagiya Y. Gotoh M. Nakamura Y. Arakawa H. Nat.

Toczyski D. Curr. Opin.

As a consequence, RNR activity increases, and the dNTP pools are elevated 7-fold in logarithmically growing cells, which is about 4-fold higher than the maximal level of dNTP pools during the S phase (24Chabes A. Georgieva B. Domkin V. Zhao X. Rothstein R. Thelander L. Cell. 2003; 112: 391-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Schizosaccharomyces pombe responds in a similar way to DNA damage, with degradation of the small RNR inhibitor protein Spd1 and a 2-fold increase in the dNTP pools (25Liu C. Powell A.K. Mundt K.

Arakawa H. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 440-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and by analogy with the yeast system, it has been assumed that mammalian cells also increase their ribonucleotide reductase activity and dNTP pools after DNA damage (27Ping Lin Z.

There are conflicting reports in the literature, however, regarding the effects of DNA damage on dNTP pools in mammalian cells (29Kunz B.A. Kohalmi S.E. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 339-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).We have studied the levels of R1, R2, and p53R2 proteins and dNTP levels in both logarithmically growing and synchronized cultures of mammalian cells before and after DNA damage and exposure to hydroxyurea. In our experiments, cells always show a low, constitutive level of p53R2 protein expression that is independent of the phase of the cell cycle. However, we have never observed any major increase in the dNTP pools in logarithmically growing or resting mammalian cells after DNA damage. These results are in strong contrast to the pronounced increase in dNTP pools observed in yeast after DNA damage. However, Go/G1-phase mammalian cells expressing the p53R2 protein but not the R2 protein were found to show a significant reduction in their dNTP pools after treatment with the specific RNR inhibitor hydroxyurea, indicating that there is indeed ribonucleotide reduction in Go/G1-phase mammalian cells. Our results emphasize the importance of the low constitutive levels of p53R2, which together with low levels of the R1 protein may be essential for the supply of dNTPs for basal DNA repair and mitochondrial DNA synthesis in Go/G1 cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Mouse fibroblast Balb/3T3 cells (American Type Culture Collection, CCL 163) were grown as previously described (5Guittet O. Håkansson P. Voevodskaya N. Fridd S. Gräslund A. Arakawa H. Nakamura Y. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 274: 40647-40651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Human fibroblast WS1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, CCL 1502) and primary mouse fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Where possible, experiments were performed with all three types of cells to exclude cell type-specific results. However, Balb/3T3 cells gave the highest fraction of S-phase cells after synchronization, and these cells were, thus, used preferentially for S-phase studies. Serum synchronization of cells and UV irradiation were performed as described earlier (30Filatov D. Björklund S. Johansson E. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23698-23704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cell elutriation was performed as described earlier (31Eriksson S. Gräslund A. Skog S. Thelander L. Tribukait B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11695-11700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the following modifications. After trypsinization, Balb/3T3 cells that had been starved of serum for 48 h were resuspended in the spent medium and elutriated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum. After elutriation, the Go/G1 cell fraction was seeded in the spent medium containing 0.5% fresh serum. For the generation of primary embryonic mouse fibroblasts, mouse blastocysts were prepared as described (32Spector D.L. Goldman R.D. Leinwand L.A. Cells, A Laboratory Manual, Vol. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998Google Scholar). Adriamycin and hydroxyurea were added directly to cell cultures to final concentrations of 0.2 μg/ml and 2 mm, respectively.Immunoblotting—Approximately 106 cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested with a rubber policeman, pelleted by centrifugation at 230 × g for 2 min, and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). After freezing and thawing 3 times, cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g and 4 °C for 20 min, and protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method. From 106 Balb/3T3 cells, we obtained 0.32 mg of protein. Equal amounts of protein were loaded in separate lanes and electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Transfer of proteins to a Hybond-C Extra membrane was made as previously described (11Chabes A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17747-17753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). After transfer, the membrane was blocked in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 containing 2% dried milk for 30 min before incubation with either a polyclonal rabbit anti-p53R2 antibody (ab2014, Abcam), a polyclonal rabbit anti-R2 antibody (33Lembo D. Gribaudo G. Hofer A. Riera L. Cornaglia M. Mondo A. Angeretti A. Gariglio M. Thelander L. Landolfo S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11557-11565Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), or a monoclonal mouse anti-R1 antibody, AD203 (13Engstrom Y. Eriksson S. Jildevik I. Skog S. Thelander L. Tribukait B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9114-9116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. A minor cross-reaction was found between the anti-p53R2 and anti-R2 antibodies, but this was not a problem since these two proteins have different electrophoretic mobilities due to their different sizes (5Guittet O. Håkansson P. Voevodskaya N. Fridd S. Gräslund A. Arakawa H. Nakamura Y. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 274: 40647-40651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies were removed by washing the membrane in the same solution as above (but without dried milk) followed by incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was finally washed as previously described (11Chabes A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17747-17753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and detection was done using the ECL-plus system according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences).For absolute quantification of p53R2, R2, and R1 protein levels by immunoblotting, known amounts of pure recombinant proteins were loaded in separate lanes on the gel. After detection, the developed film was scanned, and band intensities were measured with Scion image software (Scion Corp.) and plotted against the amount of each recombinant protein to generate a standard curve. Endogenous p53R2, R2, and R1 proteins in cell extracts were quantified by running immunoblots on the same gel as the one used for the standard curve. The intensities of endogenous p53R2, R2, and R1 bands were then compared with the standard curve, and the actual amount of cellular protein was calculated.Cell Cycle Analysis—Flow cytometry analyses were carried out on approximately 106 cells using a CCA-I flow cytometer according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Partec GmbH, Germany). 5-Bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) staining was done according to the instructions of the manufacturer using a BrdUrd labeling and detection kit (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, cells were incubated with BrdUrd for 30 min. Incorporation of BrdUrd was then detected by incubating the cells with an anti-BrdUrd fluorescent antibody. The cells were then analyzed using a Zeiss Axiovert 40 CFL microscope, with phase contrast (for total number of cells) or by fluorescence microscopy (for BrdUrd-positive cells).Measurement of dNTP Pools—Approximately 107 cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 0.5 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid supplemented with 15 mm MgCl2. The quantification of nucleotides was done according to Hofer et al. (34Hofer A. Ekanem J.T. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34098-34104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. After Freon extraction, 25 μl of the aqueous phase was loaded onto a polyWAX LP 200 × 4.6-mm column for quantification of ribonucleoside triphosphates. The HPLC column was run isocratically in 0.3 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 5.0, with 2% (v/v) acetonitrile at 1 ml/min, allowing the simultaneous separation of all 8 NTPs and dNTPs from each other. For quantification of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate, the remaining part of the sample (475 μl) was passed through a boronate column to remove the ribonucleotides, and 2 ml of the flow-through was collected. 1 ml was loaded onto the HPLC column using the same conditions as described for the ribonucleoside triphosphates. The nucleotides were quantified by measuring the peak heights and comparing them to a standard curve. For quantification of nucleotide pools in mouse skeletal muscle, a male mouse was sacrificed by delocalization of the spinal cord, and a piece of the hind leg muscle was dissected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The tissue was homogenized in ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid with 15 mm MgCl2, and the nucleotides were determined as above. Because we could not determine the number of muscle cells in the sample, we determined each dNTP as the percentage of the total nucleoside triphosphate pool in mouse skeletal muscle cells (CTP + UTP + ATP + GTP). Assuming that the total NTP pool of muscle cells is the same as the total NTP pool in Balb/3T3 cells (reproducibly 10 nmol of NTP/106 cells independently of the cell-cycle phase), we could make an approximate calculation of the concentration of each dNTP in pmol/106 muscle cells.Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant human R2, human R1, human p53R2, and mouse p53R2 proteins were expressed and purified as previously described (5Guittet O. Håkansson P. Voevodskaya N. Fridd S. Gräslund A. Arakawa H. Nakamura Y. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 274: 40647-40651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Recombinant mouse R2 and R1 proteins were expressed and purified to homogeneity as previously described (35Mann G.J. Gräslund A. Ochiai E.-I. Ingemarsson I. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 36Davis R. Thelander M. Mann G.J. Behravan G. Soucy F. Beaulieu P. Lavallée P. Gräslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23171-23176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTSThe p53R2 Protein Is Expressed at Constant, Low Levels throughout the Cell Cycle, and This Basal Level of Expression Is Increased Both in Go/G1- and S-phase Cells after DNA Damage—The expression of the p53R2 gene is slowly induced in logarithmically growing cells after DNA damage in a p53/p73-dependent manner (3Tanaka H. Arakawa H. Yamaguchi T. Shiraishi K. Fukuda S. Matsui K. Takei Y. Nakamura Y. Nature. 2000; 404: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 4Nakano K. Bálint E. Ashcroft M. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4283-4289Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, in these studies the protein also appeared to be present at low levels in undamaged cells, although no special emphasis was placed on this fact. To study the constitutive expression of the p53R2 protein during the cell cycle, mouse Balb/3T3 fibroblast cells were synchronized in Go/G1 phase by serum starvation or synchronized in S phase by serum starvation followed by cultivation in fresh medium supplemented with 20% serum. Synchronization was monitored by flow cytometry (Fig. 1A) and further confirmed by BrdUrd incorporation (Fig. 1B). The levels of the p53R2 protein were the same in both Go/G1- and S-phase-enriched cells as determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 1C, top panel). In agreement with earlier studies (11Chabes A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17747-17753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), R2 protein was hardly detectable in the Go/G1-phase cells but was strongly expressed in the S-phase cells (Fig. 1C, middle panel). The levels of the R1 protein were low in the Go/G1-phase cells and strongly elevated in the S-phase cells (Fig. 1C, bottom panel).Next, we investigated whether Go/G1-phase cells can induce p53R2 expression after DNA damage. To avoid cell type-specific results, we used three different cell types: mouse Balb/3T3, human WS1, and mouse primary fibroblast cells. All cells were starved of serum for a total of 72 h with or without the addition of the DNA damaging agent adriamycin for the final 24 h, a treatment earlier shown to cause induction of p53R2 in logarithmically growing cells (3Tanaka H. Arakawa H. Yamaguchi T. Shiraishi K. Fukuda S. Matsui K. Takei Y. Nakamura Y. Nature. 2000; 404: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Independent of the addition of adriamycin, this method generated close to pure Go/G1-phase cultures (Fig. 2A, bottom panel). Analyses of the content of the p53R2 protein by immunoblotting showed that all three Go/G1-phase cell lines induced expression of the p53R2 protein in response to adriamycin exposure (Fig. 2A, top panel).FIGURE 2Both Go/G1- and S-phase cells induce expression of the p53R2 protein after DNA damage. A, immunoblot (top panel) and flow cytometry (bottom panel) analysis of Balb/3T3 cells, WS1 cells, and primary mouse fibroblasts (primary embryonic mouse (PEM) cells). Cells were synchronized in Go/G1 phase with (+) or without (–) the addition of adriamycin. B, immunoblot (top panels) and flow cytometry (bottom panel) analysis of Balb/3T3 cells starved of serum and then released into S phase with fresh medium supplemented with 20% serum and adriamycin (time point 0). The same amounts of cell extract as in Fig. 1 were used for immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To answer the question of whether S-phase cells would also induce expression of the p53R2 protein after DNA damage, Balb/3T3 cells were starved of serum for 48 h and then released into S phase by replacing the serum-depleted medium with fresh medium supplemented with 20% serum and adriamycin. Exposure to adriamycin caused a 4-h delay in cell cycle progression compared with cells released in fresh medium without the drug (data not shown). However, 22 h after the re-addition of serum, the majority of drug-treated cells were in mid-S phase (Fig. 2B, bottom panel). Although the drug-treated cells expressed high levels of R2 protein (Fig. 2B, middle panel, 22-h lane), they nevertheless induced expression of p53R2 protein (Fig. 2B, top panel; compare the 0-h lane with the 22-h lane). These results clearly show that p53R2 protein is expressed equally well in undamaged Go/G1- and S-phase cells (Fig. 1) and that both Go/G1- and S-phase cells induce expression of p53R2 protein after DNA damage (Fig. 2).Induced Expression of p53R2 Protein after DNA Damage in Logarithmically Growing Mammalian Cells Does Not Result in Elevated dNTP Pools—Although it is easy to understand the rationale behind induction of p53R2 in resting cells after DNA damage, it is less obvious why an S-phase cell with high levels of R2 protein would do so. Would the induction of p53R2 protein lead to increased dNTP pools? To study the effect of p53R2 induction on intracellular dNTP levels, logarithmically growing Balb/3T3 cells were exposed either to adriamycin (present throughout cultivation) or a pulse of UV light. Cells were harvested at different time points after the addition of adriamycin or UV irradiation, and the intracellular dNTP pools (dTTP, dCTP, dATP, and dGTP) were measured by HPLC. Surprisingly, all four dNTPs decreased with time after the addition of adriamycin (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, with the exception of some fluctuations in the dATP pool, the dNTP levels were almost constant in UV-irradiated cells (Fig. 3B). A parallel analysis of the levels of the three different RNR proteins by immunoblot showed that p53R2 increased around 24 h after the addition of adriamycin, as observed earlier (3Tanaka H. Arakawa H. Yamaguchi T. Shiraishi K. Fukuda S. Matsui K. Takei Y. Nakamura Y. Nature. 2000; 404: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3C, top panel). In contrast to the p53R2 protein, both the R2 and R1 protein levels decreased after the addition of adriamycin (Fig. 3C, middle panels). Analysis of cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry showed that mouse fibroblasts leave S phase in a time-dependent manner after the addition of adriamycin (Fig. 3C, bottom panel). This explains the decrease in the R2 protein level since R2 is S phase-specific. Due to the long half-life of the R1 protein, it decreased in amount more slowly than the R2 protein. Similarly to adriamycin, UV irradiation caused induced expression of p53R2 (Fig. 3D, top panel). However, in contrast to adriamycin, this dose of UV radiation only had a small effect on the overall cell cycle distribution (Fig. 3D, bottom panel) and, thus, also had only a small effect on the level of R2 and virtually no effect on the level of R1 (Fig. 3D, middle panels). Similar results were obtained using the human fibroblast WS1 cell line (data not shown). Taken together, these results clearly show that there is no correlation between induced expression of the p53R2 protein and a general increase in the intracellular dNTP pools in a logarithmically growing c"
https://openalex.org/W2060946137,"Steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3/AIB1) is an oncogene frequently amplified and overexpressed in breast cancers. Here we report that SRC-3 interacts with REGgamma, a proteasome activator known to stimulate the trypsin-like activity of the 20S proteasome. RNAi knockdown and gain-of-function experiments suggest that REGgamma promotes SRC-3 protein degradation. Cellular levels of REGgamma expression affect estrogen-receptor target-gene expression and cell growth as a result of its ability to promote degradation of the SRC-3 protein. In vitro proteasome proteolysis assays using purified REGgamma, SRC-3, and the 20S proteasome reinforce these conclusions and demonstrate that REGgamma promotes the degradation of SRC-3 in a ubiquitin- and ATP-independent manner. This work demonstrates the first example of a physiologically relevant endogenous cellular target for the REGgamma-proteasome complex. It also highlights the fact that an alternative mode of proteasome-mediated protein degradation, independent of the 19S proteasome regulatory cap, targets the SRC-3 protein for degradation."

The mechanism by which the enzyme is spatially and temporally controlled is not well understood, particularly because the dependence of calpain on calcium exceeds the submicromolar concentrations normally observed in cells. Here we show that the channel kinase TRPM7 localizes to peripheral adhesion complexes with m-calpain, where it regulates cell adhesion by controlling the activity of the protease. Our research revealed that overexpression of TRPM7 in cells caused cell rounding with a concomitant loss of cell adhesion that is dependent upon the channel of the protein but not its kinase activities. Knockdown of m-calpain blocked TRPM7-induced cell rounding and cell detachment. Silencing of TRPM7 by RNA interference, however, strengthened cell adhesion and increased the number of peripheral adhesion complexes in the cells. Together, our results suggest that the ion channel TRPM7 regulates cell adhesion through m-calpain by mediating the local influx of calcium into peripheral adhesion complexes. m-Calpain is a protease implicated in the control of cell adhesion through focal adhesion disassembly.

Annexin I has been identified as a substrate for the kinase, but the functional significance of annexin I phosphorylation by TRPM7 is not yet understood (11Dorovkov M.V. Ryazanov A.G. J. Biol.

Here we present evidence that TRPM7 is a potent regulator of m-calpain.

We found that expression of TRPM7 in HEK-293 cells produced cell rounding and a loss of cell adhesion that was dependent upon m-calpain. TRPM7-dependent cell rounding occurred without significantly elevating cytosolic calcium concentrations, suggesting that calcium influx through the channel was creating local calcium gradients to activate the protease. Indeed, TRPM7 colocalized with m-calpain at peripheral vinculin-containing adhesion complexes, where presumably, as one of its physiological roles, TRPM7 controls the activity of m-calpain to regulate cell adhesion. Recently, the bifunctional channel has been shown to play a key role in anoxic cell death. The control of m-calpain by TRPM7 may also contribute to some of the cellular events that occur during ischemia, as well as to other pathologies associated with the calcium-dependent protease (32Starling A. de Paula F. Silva H. Vainzof M. Zatz M. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2003; 21: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 33Zatz M. Starling A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 352: 2413-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Materials—All of the chemicals, unless otherwise stated, were from Sigma. The calpain inhibitor ALLM, 2The abbreviations used are: ALLM, N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-methioninal; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; FMK, fluoromethyl ketone; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FRT, Flp recombination target. the caspase 3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK, and the Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 were from Calbiochem. TRPM7-expressing Cell Lines—TRPM7, kinase mutants, and small hairpin RNA-expressing cell lines were made using the Flp-In system (Invitrogen) and the commercially available Flp-In T-Rex 293 cells following the manufacturer's instructions. The Flp-In T-Rex 293 cell line expresses the tetracycline repressor protein (TetR), which in the absence of tetracycline blocks transcription from the cytomegalovirus promoter containing control elements from the bacterial tetracycline resistance operon. The Flp-In T-Rex 293 cell line contains a single, stably integrated FRT site at a transcriptionally active genomic locus, so that target integration of a Flp-In expression vector ensures reproducible isogenic high level gene expression. To make the cell lines, an expression vector (pcDNA5/FRT/TO) containing amino-terminal hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged murine TRPM7 (GenBank™ accession number AF376052), TRPM7-K1645A, TRPM7-G1618D, TRPM7ΔKIN, GFP-KIN, or GFP-CTKIN was cotransfected into the parental cell line with the pOG44 plasmid that expresses Flp recombinase. The respective coding sequences were then integrated into the genome via Flp recombinase-mediated DNA recombination at the specific genomic location. To test the function of the kinase domain, we created cell lines expressing a version of TRPM7 in which the catalytic kinase domain has been removed (293-TRPM7ΔKIN) or one in which the kinase domain has been rendered catalytically inactive (293-TRPM7-K1645A, 293-TRPM7-G1618D). The truncation of the kinase domain was made by changing the TCG codon encoding serine 1501 into a stop codon. The K1645A substitution renders the kinase inactive by mutating a critical invariant lysine to alanine. The G1618D mutation disrupts kinase activity by blocking ATP binding to the P-loop in the catalytic domain. Control experiments have shown that a GST fusion of the kinase domain harboring either the K1645A or G1618D substitutions was soluble but lacked catalytic activity (data not shown). TRPM7-K1645A, TRPM7-G1618D, and TRPMΔKIN were generated using QuikChange (Stratagene) with the following primers: TRPM7-K1645A, 5′-CCT GAA GTC AGG GCA TCT CTA TAT CAT TGC GTC ATT TCT TCC TGA GGT G-3′ and 5′-CAC CTC AGG AAG AAA TGA CGC AAT GAT ATA GAG ATG CCC TGA CTT CAG G-3′; TRPM7-G1618D, 5′-GTA AAG AGG AAA TGG GAG ATG GTT TAC GAA GAG CAG-3′ and 5′-CTG CTC TTC GTA AAC CAT CTC CCA TTT CCT CTT TAC-3′; and TRPM7ΔKIN, 5′-CTG TAG TAG AAG AGC GTA GAC GGA AGA CTCT CCA G-3′ and 5′-CTG GAG AGT CTT CCG TCT ACG CTC TTC TAC TAC AG-3′. shRNA Cell Lines—To fully test the hypothesis that TRPM7 is involved in regulating cell adhesion, we created 293 cells in which native TRPM7 protein levels were lowered by expression of shRNAs that target TRPM7 (34Matsukura S. Jones P.A. Takai D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e77Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We designed six variant shRNAs to target either human, mouse, or rat TRPM7 from the following sequences: M7shRNA1, 5′-GCA AAT GGA GTT ACC CAA AC-3′; M7shRNA2, 5′-GCA TAA ATT CCT TAC CAT TC-3′; M7shRNA3, 5′-GGT TGG ATC CTT GGA ACA AGC-3′; M7shRNA4, 5′-GGA ACA AGC TAT GCT TGA TGC-3′; M7shRNA5, 5′-GGA AAT CTT CCT CCA GGA TAT-3′; and M7shRNA6, 5′-GCA CTC CTC AGT TGC GAA AGA-3′. Cell lines were constructed by first cloning double-stranded oligonucleotides that encoded the shRNAs into the pENTR/H1/TO vector (Invitrogen). Expression from the pENTR/H1/TO vector is driven by RNA polymerase III off a H1 promoter modified to contain two tetracycline operator 2 (TetO2) sites. We screened the pENTR/H1/TO TRPM7 shRNA clones by transfecting them into 293-TRPM7ΔKIN-expressing cells and then evaluated their ability to attenuate TRPM7 expression (supplemental Fig. S1). Four of the best constructs were then used to make TRPM7-shRNA-expressing cell lines. First, pcDNA5/FRT/TO/GATEWAY was created using the Gateway Vector Conversion System (Invitrogen) by blunt end ligation of the Gateway cassette into the NruI and EcoRV sites of pcDNA5/FRT/TO (which removed the cytomegalovirus promotor). A Gateway LR recombination reaction (Invitrogen) was then performed to introduce the shRNA expression cassette into pcDNA5/FRT/TO/GATEWAY. The final GATEWAY vectors expressing shRNAs against TRPM7 (pcDNA5/FRT/TO/GATEWAY-M7shRNA-2, M7shRNA-3, M7shRNA-5, and M7shRNA-6) were used to generate stable cell lines employing the Flp-In system (Invitrogen). A nonsilencing sequence (5′-AAT TCT CCG AAC GTG TCA CGT-3′) was used to make the control cell line 293-shRNA-C (20Aarts M. Iihara K. Wei W.L. Xiong Z.G. Arundine M. Cerwinski W. MacDonald J.F. Tymianski M. Cell. 2003; 115: 863-877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Anti-TRPM7 Antibodies—The TRPM7-specific PLIKC47 antibody (α-C47), which recognizes residues 1816-1863 from rat TRPM7, has been previously described (14Runnels L.W. Yue L. Clapham D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). A second rabbit polyclonal TRPM7 (α-CTERM) was generated using a GST fusion protein with residues 1384-1506 of murine TRPM7 as the antigen. The α-CTERM antibody was purified following protocols that have been described (14Runnels L.W. Yue L. Clapham D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Both α-C47 and α-CTERM are specific and suitable for immunocytochemistry, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation experiments (supplemental Fig. S2). Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation Experiments—293-TRPM7 cells expressing recombinant HA-tagged TRPM7 or channel and kinase variants were lysed after a 24-h treatment with tetracycline using 2 ml of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Igepal CA-630, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and 10 mm iodoacetamide). The proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight from cell lysates from a 60-mm dish with an anti-HA affinity matrix. In the case of GFP-KIN and GFP-CTKIN, expressed proteins were immunoprecipitated using a monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (Roche Applied Science) bound to protein G-agarose. The samples were washed three times in TBST (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20), eluted by boiling in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and then resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting following standard protocols. The monoclonal 12CA5 anti-HA antibody or the monoclonal 7.1 and 13.1 anti-GFP antibodies were used as the primary antibodies (Roche Applied Science). The SuperSignal West Dura maximum sensitive substrate (Pierce) was used for immunochemiluminescence detection. To detect native TRPM7 in the HEK-293 line, cells were lysed from a 10-cm dish using 2 ml of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. TRPM7 was immunoprecipitated overnight from cell lysates using 10 μg of α-C47 antibody absorbed to protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The samples were washed three times in TBST buffer, eluted in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and then resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using the second anti-TRPM7 antibody (α-CTERM). The SuperSignal West Dura maximum sensitive substrate (Pierce) was used for immunochemiluminescence detection. Detection of Talin Cleavage—Talin was detected using a primary monoclonal antibody from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (clone TA205), which recognizes an epitope within the head domain of human talin (amino acids 139-433). Immunokinase Assay—The immunokinase assay was performed as follows. Briefly, 10-cm dishes of cells were grown to confluence and allowed to express the individual proteins by the addition of tetracycline (1 μg/ml) to the medium. After 24 h, the cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and the specific proteins were immunoprecipitated as described above. The immunocaptured proteins were washed four times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% polyoxyethylenesorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20). The wash buffer was replaced by ice-cold reaction buffer (KIN-DET) containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 3.5 mm MnCl2, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.5 mm ATP, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity of 3000 Ci/mmol). The samples were then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a 50-μl reaction, before being terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 6× SDS sample buffer. The samples were then resolved on a 6% SDS-PAGE gel. The gels were dried, and γ-32P incorporation was visualized by autoradiography. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—293-TRPM7 cells were plated onto polylysine coated coverslips and treated with tetracycline for 20 h to analyze the cellular distribution of HA-tagged TRPM7. The cells were fixed at room temperature for 10 min in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) with 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Saponin (Sigma). Primary antibodies against TRPM7 (described above) or the monoclonal 12CA5 anti-HA (Roche Applied Science) were used to visualize TRPM7 by immunofluorescence. A monoclonal antibody against vinculin (HVIN-1 clone; Sigma) was used to image peripheral adhesion complexes. A rabbit polyclonal antibody against m-calpain (Triple Point Biologics, Inc.) was used to visualize the cellular distribution of the protease. A 1:2000 dilution of Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 568 goat antibody to rabbit or mouse (Molecular Probes) was used as the secondary antibody. The images were obtained from a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope using a 488-nm excitation wavelength and a 512-nm band pass emission filter. The pinhole size used was 30 Airy Units, and the contrast/brightness settings were kept the same for each image. Electrophysiological Recordings and Calcium Imaging—The voltage clamp technique was used to evaluate the whole cell currents of TRPM7 expressed in HEK-293 cells as described (14Runnels L.W. Yue L. Clapham D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole cell current recordings of TRPM7-expressing cells were elicited by voltage stimuli lasting 250 ms delivered every 1 s using voltage ramps from -120 to +100 mV. The data were digitized at 2 or 5 kHz and digitally filtered off-line at 1 kHz. The internal pipette solution for macroscopic current recordings contained 145 mm cesium methanesulfonate, 8 mm NaCl, 10 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH. The extracellular solution for whole cell recordings contained 140 mm NaCl, 5mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 20 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose, pH adjusted to 7.4 (NaOH). Calcium imaging was conducted using an IonOptix ratio calcium imaging system. In brief, the cells were plated on 25-mm glass coverslips and incubated with Fura 2/acetoxymethyl (5 μm) for 50 min. After the extracellular Fura 2/acetoxymethyl was washed away, the cells were incubated for an additional 30 min. Fluorescence intensity at 510 nm with 340- and 380-nm excitation was collected at a rate of 1 Hz using a intensified CCD camera (Ionoptix), and the data were analyzed using Ionwizard (Ionoptix). 1 μm ionomycin was applied to each cell and was used as a reference to normalize the changes in the F340/F380 ratio. For Ca2+ imaging the extracellular Tyrode's solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose, pH adjusted to 7.4 (NaOH). Cell Rounding Assay—Changes in 293 cell morphology were scored manually employing the following criteria. The cells that had a fully round cell body with no membrane extension processes were given 1 point. Partially rounded cells with one or two membrane extensions were assigned half a point. Nonrounded cells having three or four membrane extension processes, with a cell morphology similar to wild type HEK-293 cells, were given 0 points. Adhesion Assay—Cell adhesion was measured using a trypsinization assay (36Ortiz-Urda S. Garcia J. Green C.L. Chen L. Lin Q. Veitch D.P. Sakai L.Y. Lee H. Marinkovich M.P. Khavari P.A. Science. 2005; 307: 1773-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼2.5×106 cells were plated onto a 60-mm Falcon tissue culture dish for 24 h and then treated with 0.5 ml of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA for 4 min to stimulate cell detachment. Detached cells in the trypsin-EDTA solution were collected, and the trypsinization was terminated by the addition of 3 ml of culture medium. The number of detached cells was then manually counted using a hemocytometer and expressed as a percentage of the total number of cells on the plate. Rho Activity Assay—Detection of activated Rho was accomplished using a modified GST pull-down purification assay. To detect activated Rho, the pull-down was performed using GST fused to the Rhotekin Rho-binding domain (37Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). The assay was performed by incubating cell lysates with partially purified GST fused to the Rhotekin Rho-binding domain bound to glutathione beads for 1 h (Amersham Biosciences), washing the beads, and then resolving bound Rho by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described (38Habas R. Kato Y. He X. Cell. 2001; 107: 843-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). The cells transfected with ephexin, a Rho-GEF, were used as a positive control. The ephexin expression vector was a gift of Michael Greenberg (Division of Neuroscience, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA). Calpain 2 shRNA Blockade in LTRPC7 Cells—RNA interference of m-calpain (calpain 2) expression was achieved by expression of a shRNA in the pSUPERretro vector specific to human m-calpain. To make the pSUPERretro-CAPN2 vector, the following oligonucleotides were cloned into the BglII-HindIII sites of pSUPERretro (sense, 5′-GAT CCC CGG CAT ACG CCA AGA TCA ACT TCA AGA GAG TTG ATC TTG GCG TAT GCC TTT TTG GAA A-3′; antisense, 5′-AGC TTT TCC AAA AAG GCA TAC GCC AAG ATC AAC TCT CTT GAA GTT GAT CTT GGC GTA TGC CGG G-3′), in which the m-calpain target sequence is 5′-AAG GCA UAC GCC AAG AUC AAC-3′. pSUPERretro-CAPN2 was transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) into LTRPC7 cells (generously provided by Dr. Andrew Scharenberg, University of Washington) (8Nadler M.J.S. Hermosura M.C. Inabe K. Perraud A.-L. Zhu Q. Stokes A.J. Kurosaki T. Kine J.-P. Penner R. Scharenberg A.M. Fleig A. Nature. 2001; 411: 590-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Cells expressing the shRNA targeting m-calpain were selected using 5 μg/ml puromycin for 3 days prior to expression of TRPM7 by the addition of tetracycline (1 μg/ml) to the media. Control experiments showed that nontransfected cells treated with puromycin died within 3 days. Silencing of m-calpain was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting of cell lysates, using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against m-calpain (Triple Point Biologics, Inc.). A monoclonal antibody against μ-calpain (Alexis Biochemicals) was used to show that pSUPERretro-CAPN2 did not affect μ-calpain protein levels. TRPM7 Regulates Cell Adhesion—A previous study had showed that overexpression of TRPM7 induces cell detachment and subsequent cell death (8Nadler M.J.S. Hermosura M.C. Inabe K. Perraud A.-L. Zhu Q. Stokes A.J. Kurosaki T. Kine J.-P. Penner R. Scharenberg A.M. Fleig A. Nature. 2001; 411: 590-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to determine whether TRPM7 is involved in the control of cell adhesion. To study the cellular function of TRPM7, we employed the Flp-In system and Flp-In T-Rex cells (Invitrogen) to generate a HEK-293 cell line that could inducibly overexpress TRPM7 with the addition of tetracycline to the growth medium (293-TRPM7). 293-TRPM7 cells expressed high levels of channel activity and produced whole cell currents with activation kinetics and current-voltage relationships similar to those described earlier (see Fig. 2A) (1Runnels L.W. Yue L. Clapham D.E. Science. 2001; 291: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 8Nadler M.J.S. Hermosura M.C. Inabe K. Perraud A.-L. Zhu Q. Stokes A.J. Kurosaki T. Kine J.-P. Penner R. Scharenberg A.M. Fleig A. Nature. 2001; 411: 590-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). As previously reported, HEK-293 cells that express TRPM7 rounded up within 18-24 h and became loosely attached to tissue culture plates (Fig. 1A) (8Nadler M.J.S. Hermosura M.C. Inabe K. Perraud A.-L. Zhu Q. Stokes A.J. Kurosaki T. Kine J.-P. Penner R. Scharenberg A.M. Fleig A. Nature. 2001; 411: 590-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar, 20Aarts M. Iihara K. Wei W.L. Xiong Z.G.

We tested whether expression of TRPM7 in 293-TRPM7 cells was toxic, because an earlier study by Nadler et al. (8Nadler M.J.S. Hermosura M.C. Inabe K. Perraud A.-L. Zhu Q. Stokes A.J. Kurosaki T. Kine J.-P. Penner R. Scharenberg A.M. Fleig A. Nature. 2001; 411: 590-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar) found that overexpression of TRPM7 in their LTRPC7 cell line led to cell rounding, detachment, and subsequent cell death. Nonexpressing 293-TRPM7 cells had comparable amounts of cell death (less than 10%) to cells expressing TRPM7 for at least 72 h, as assessed by trypan blue exclusion analysis (data not shown). However, expression of TRPM7 in the original LTRPC7 cell line, which expresses two or three times more channel activity than 293-TRPM7 cells, did cause significant cell death (∼25%) (data not shown). In addition, the effect of TRPM7 on cell morphology and adhesion is specific. Expression of TRPM1, TRPC5, lymphocyte α-kinase, and TRPM6 (a second TRPM family member with a kinase domain) in HEK-293 cells failed to produce the morphological changes that were visible when TRPM7 was expressed (data not shown). This finding is consistent with a recent report showing that TRPM6 and TRPM7 are functionally nonredundant (39Schmitz C. Dorovkov M.V. Zhao X. Davenport B.J. Ryazanov A.G. Perraud A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37763-37771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar).FIGURE 1TRPM7 regulates cell adhesion in HEK-293 cells. A, application of tetracycline (TET) induced expression of HA-TRPM7 and produced cell rounding of 293-TRPM7 cells. Knockdown of native TRPM7 in 293-M7shRNA2 cells produced cells that were more spread and had 50% longer extensions than a control cell line expressing a nonsilencing shRNA (293-shRNA-C). The same magnification was used in all four images. B, 293-M7shRNA2 cells adhered more strongly to the substratum than 293-shRNA-C or 293-TRPM7-expressing cells. Adhesion was measured using a trypsinization assay in which ∼2.5 × 106 cells were plated onto 60-mm Falcon tissue culture dishes for 24 h and then treated with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA for 4 min to stimulate cell detachment.

https://openalex.org/W2128880038,"Members of the ribonuclease III (RNase III) family are double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) specific endoribonucleases characterized by a signature motif in their active centers and a two-base 3' overhang in their products. While Dicer, which produces small interfering RNAs, is currently the focus of intense interest, the structurally simpler bacterial RNase III serves as a paradigm for the entire family. Here, we present the crystal structure of an RNase III-product complex, the first catalytic complex observed for the family. A 7 residue linker within the protein facilitates induced fit in protein-RNA recognition. A pattern of protein-RNA interactions, defined by four RNA binding motifs in RNase III and three protein-interacting boxes in dsRNA, is responsible for substrate specificity, while conserved amino acid residues and divalent cations are responsible for scissile-bond cleavage. The structure reveals a wealth of information about the mechanism of RNA hydrolysis that can be extrapolated to other RNase III family members."

https://openalex.org/W2061718114,"Helicobacter pylori vacuolating cytotoxin, VacA, which causes vacuolation of gastric epithelial cells and other types of cultured cells, is known to stimulate apoptosis via a mitochondria-dependent pathway. In the present study, we examined the mechanisms of VacA-induced mitochondrial damage. Intracellular VacA localization was monitored by immunostaining and confocal microscopy; in AZ-521 cells in which cytochrome c release was stimulated, most of VacA was localized to vacuoles rather than mitochondria. VacA reduced the membrane potential of isolated mitochondria without inducing cytochrome c release, suggesting that it did not act directly to induce cytochrome c release from mitochondria and that in intact cells, VacA-induced cytochrome c release involved apoptosis-related factor(s), such as a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein. In agreement, flow cyto-metric analyses using antibodies specific for activated Bax revealed that intracellular Bax was activated by VacA in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Using active form-specific antibodies, we also observed that the Bcl-2 family protein, Bak, was activated. By confocal microscopy, Bax and Bak were activated in AZ-521 cells in which cyto-chrome c release was induced by VacA. In addition, small interfering RNA-induced silencing of the bax gene resulted in reduction of VacA-stimulated cytochrome c release, consistent with a contribution of VacA-induced Bax activation to cytochrome c release. NH4Cl enhanced both VacA-induced vacuolation and Bax activation, whereas Bax activation was not inhibited by bafilomycin A1, which inhibited vacuolation caused by VacA. These results suggest that VacA acts through different signaling pathways to induce apoptosis via Bax activation, independent of vacuolation.

Persistent Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer, and gastric cancer. The vacuolating cytotoxin, VacA, is one of the major pathogenic products of H. pylori and induces vacuoles within various types of cultured cells, not only gastric epithelial cells. Epidemiological studies and animal experiments showed that VacA is a major virulence factor associated with gastric mucosal damage (1Phadnis S.H. Ilver D. Janzon L. Normark S. Westblom T.U. Infect.

Exposure of VacA to acidic conditions resulted in its association with planar lipid bilayers and formation of membrane-associated hexamers (11Torres V.J. McClain M.S. Cover T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2324-2331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These hexamers act as anion-selective, voltage-dependent channels (12Czajkowsky D.M. Iwamoto H.

It is believed that the VacA channel damages susceptible cells by inducing changes in the osmotic balance across certain membranes (including plasma and vacuolar membranes).VacA has been reported to induce apoptosis (14Boquet P.

VacA purified from H. pylori culture medium and recombinant VacA caused fragmentation of nuclear DNA in AGS gastric epithelial cells (15Kuck D. Kolmerer B. Iking-Konert C. Krammer P.H. Stremmel W.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6361-6370Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), and transfection of HeLa cells with these DNAs resulted in the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria plus activation of caspase 3. Willhite et al. (18Willhite D.C. Cover T.L. Blanke S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48204-48209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and Nakayama et al. (19Nakayama M. Kimura M. Wada A. Yahiro K. Ogushi K. Niidome T. Fujikawa A. Shirasaka D. Aoyama N. Kurazono H. Noda M. Moss J. Hirayama T. J. Biol.

VacA also caused mitochondrial damage, leading to a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (20Kimura M. Goto S. Wada A. Yahiro K. Niidome T. Hatakeyama T. Aoyagi H. Hirayama T. Kondo T. Microb. Pathog. 1999; 26: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 21Willhite D.C. Blanke S.R. Cell. Microbiol. 2004; 6: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential occurred substantially before and at a lower concentration of VacA than did cytochrome c release. By confocal microscopy in HeLa cells, exogenously added full-length VacA and intracellularly expressed p37, but not p58, localized to mitochondria (14Boquet P. Ricci V. Galmiche A. Gauthier N.C. Trends Microbiol. 2003; 11: 410-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 17Galmiche A. Rassow J. Doye A. Cagnol S. Chambard J.C. Contamin S. de Thillot V. Just I.

Microbiol. 2004; 6: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). By using a mutant that was deficient in VacA channel activity or a VacA channel inhibitor, it was shown that VacA channel activity was necessary for both cytochrome c release and the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (21Willhite D.C. Blanke S.R. Cell. Microbiol. 2004; 6: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), consistent with a model in which VacA channel activity is critical for mitochondrial damage. A recombinant VacA fragment (VacA418-799), which corresponds to the mid-region of the p58 domain, inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis of AGS cells (22Cho S.J. Kang N.S. Park S.Y. Kim B.O. Rhee D.K. Pyo S. Toxicon. 2003; 42: 601-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Moreover, VacA418-799 increased the expression of several apoptosis-related proteins, including proapoptotic proteins. Some pro-apoptotic Bcl2 family proteins play a central role in inducing apoptosis via a mitochondria-dependent pathway and regulate mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and cytochrome c release (23Degli Esposti M. Dive C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar).To elucidate the mechanism of VacA-induced cytochrome c release and apoptosis, we compared VacA action on intracellular and isolated mitochondria and examined the role of activation of proapoptotic Bcl2 family proteins (Bax and Bak) in VacA-induced cytochrome c release. Here we report that even in cells in which cytochrome c release was induced, VacA was localized to vacuoles rather than mitochondria. In addition, VacA did not induce cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria. VacA, however, stimulated activation of Bax and Bak in AZ-521 cells, in a process that was not affected by the inhibition of vacuolation.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagentsMonoclonal anti-Bax antibody (Clone 3) and mouse anti-cytochrome c antibody (7H8.2C12 and 6H2.B4) were purchased from BD Bioscience. Monoclonal antibody to mtHSP70 (JG1) was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals. Polyclonal antibodies to poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Rabbit anti-Bax-NT and anti-Bak-NT antibodies were purchased from Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions. 5,5′,6,6′-Tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1), Mitotracker RED CM XRos, and species-specific Alexa fluor 633-, 488-, and 564-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes. Recombinant adenovirus carrying a GFP-conjugated Rab7 (GFP-Rab7) expression cassette (Venus-Rab7) was obtained from Dr. I. Nakagawa (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan).Cell CultureHeLa cells and AZ-521 human gastric adenocarcinoma cells (Culture Collection of Health Science Resource Bank, Japan Health Science Fundamental) were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium (EMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum under 5% CO2 at 37 °C.VacA PreparationVacA was purified from H. pylori ATCC49503 strain culture supernatant using anti-VacA by our published procedure (24Yahiro K. Wada A. Yamasaki E. Nakayama M. Nishi Y. Hisatsune J. Morinaga N. Sap J. Noda M. Moss J. Hirayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51013-51021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). VacA was acid-activated during purification, and its concentrations were calculated based on monomeric forms.Assay for Vacuolating ActivityVacuolation was quantified by neutral red accumulation as described by Cover et al. (25Cover T.L. Halter S.A. Blaser M.J. Hum. Pathol. 1992; 23: 1004-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated with freshly prepared 0.05% neutral red in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin and then washed three times with PBS containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin. After the addition of 70% ethanol containing 0.4% HCl, absorbance at 540 nm (Abs 540 nm) was measured.Isolation of Mitochondria from HeLa CellsMitochondria were isolated from HeLa cells as described previously (26Pastorino J.G. Shulga N. Hoek J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7610-7618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). In brief, the HeLa cells were grown overnight, harvested, washed twice in PBS, dispersed in isolation buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 250 mm sucrose) supplemented with 1× complete protease inhibition mixture (Roche Applied Sciences). After chilling on ice for 10 min, the cells were disrupted by 50 strokes of a tight fitting Dounce tissue grinder. The homogenate was centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove unbroken cells and nuclei. The mitochondria-enriched fraction was then pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The mitochondrial pellet was rinsed twice in SEM buffer (250 mm sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, and 10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.4), immediately suspended in SEM buffer, and incubated with VacA as described.Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential and Cytochrome c Release from Isolated MitochondriaIsolated mitochondria, at a final concentration of 0.1 mg protein/ml, were incubated with VacA (720 nm) or CaCl2 (250 mm) in SEM buffer supplemented with 5 mm NH4Cl. After centrifugation (15,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) of VacA-treated mitochondria, supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube. Proteins in samples of pellet (mitochondria) and supernatant were separated by SDS-PAGE in 15% gels and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-cytochrome c antibody (7H8.2C12) as described previously (19Nakayama M. Kimura M. Wada A. Yahiro K. Ogushi K. Niidome T. Fujikawa A. Shirasaka D. Aoyama N. Kurazono H. Noda M. Moss J. Hirayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7024-7028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). After incubation of isolated mitochondria (0.1 mg protein/ml) with VacA (360 or 720 nm), mitochondrial membrane potential was quantified using membrane potential sensitive reagent (JC-1) as described previously (27Reers M. Smith T.W. Chen L.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4480-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). JC-1 forms aggregates (J-aggregate) in polarized mitochondria, resulting in a green-orange emission of 590 nm after excitation at 490 nm. J-aggregate formation, which reflects intensity of mitochondrial membrane potential, was evaluated by measurement of emission at 590 nm (excited at 490 nm).Quantitative Measurement of Cytochrome c ReleaseQuantification of cytochrome c release was executed by flow cytometry as previously described (28Yilmaz O. Jungas T. Verbeke P. Ojcius D.M. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 3743-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In brief, AZ-521 cells were seeded (1.0 × 106 cells in 4 ml of EMEM/dish) in 60-mm culture dishes (IWAKI, Chiba, Japan) and grown overnight, and then the cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of VacA, harvested, treated with digitonin (0.5 mg/ml) in PBS with 100 mm KCl for 5 min on ice, fixed, and incubated in blocking buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 1 h on ice. After washing, the cells were incubated for 1 h on ice with anti-cytochrome c antibody (6H2.B4) in blocking buffer and then for 1 h on ice with species-specific Alexa fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody in blocking buffer before analysis using FACScalibur (BD Bioscience) for detection of Alexa fluor 488 fluorescence levels. We regarded the cells with low fluorescence as having high cytoplasmic cytochrome c levels and those with high fluorescence as having intact mitochondria.Transfection with Bax Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)Use of RNA interference to lower Bax content was performed as previously reported (29Ray S. Almasan A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4713-4723PubMed Google Scholar, 30Park M.T. Kim M.J. Kang Y.H. Choi S.Y. Lee J.H. Choi J.A. Kang C.M. Cho C.K. Kang S. Bae S. Lee Y.S. Chung H.Y. Lee S.J. Blood. 2005; 105: 1724-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In brief, AZ-521 cells were seeded (1.0 × 106 cells in 4 ml of EMEM/dish) in 60-mm culture dishes and grown overnight; 0.2 μm Bax silencer siRNA (Bax-siRNA) duplexes were introduced into the cells using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The cording strand of the Bax-siRNA was 5′-AACAUGGAGCUGCAGAGGAUGAdTdT-3′ (purchased from TAKARA BIO Inc.). Negative Control siRNA (NC-siRNA) purchased from B-Bridge International Inc. was used for nonspecific interference. Silencing of bax gene was determined by measuring of Bax protein expression at 24 h after transfection by Western blotting using anti-Bax-NT antibodies.Quantitative Measurement of Bax ActivationAZ-521 cells were seeded (1.0 × 106 cells in 4 ml of EMEM/dish) in 60-mm culture dishes and grown overnight before incubation with various concentrations of VacA; quantification of Bax activation by flow cytometry using conformation-specific anti-Bax antibody (Clone 3) was performed as described previously (31Dewson G. Snowden R.T. Almond J.B. Dyer M.J. Cohen G.M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2643-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).MTS Assay for Cell ViabilityAZ-521 cells were seeded in 96-well culture plates (2.0 × 104 cells in 0.2 ml of EMEM/well) and grown overnight before incubation with or without VacA (120 nm). Bioreduction of tetrazolium compound (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt; MTS) into a formazan product as an indicator of cell viability was quantified by absorbance at 490 nm (Abs 490 nm) using a CellTiter 96 AQueous nonradioactive cell proliferation assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Immunocytochemistry and Confocal AnalysisAnalysis of VacA Localization—For detection of VacA in mitochondria, AZ-521 cells were seeded (5.0 × 104 cells in 0.2 ml of EMEM/well) and grown overnight on 8-well chamber microscope slides (Nalge Nunc); then the cells were incubated with VacA (120 nm) before incubation with 2 μm Mitotracker RED CMXRos for 15 min at 37 °C, washing with PBS, and fixation with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and then the cells were permeabilized for 5 min at room temperature with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and blocked with 1.5% Block Ace (Snow-Brand, Tokyo, Japan) in PBS. The cells were incubated with anti-VacA and anti-cytochrome c (6H2.B4) antibodies diluted in blocking buffer (0.4% Block Ace in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature, before incubation with species-specific Alexa fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (for anti-VacA antibodies) and species-specific Alexa fluor 633-conjugated secondary antibody (for anti-cytochrome c antibody) diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. For detection of VacA in vacuoles, AZ-521 cells were seeded (2.0 × 104 cells in 0.2 ml of EMEM/well) and grown overnight on 8-well chamber microscope slides before infection with Venus-Rab7; 24 h later, they were treated with VacA (120 nm), fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized for 5 min at room temperature with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and blocked with 1.5% Block Ace in PBS. The cells were incubated with anti-VacA and anti-cytochrome c (6H2.B4) antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature, before incubation with species-specific Alexa fluor 546-conjugated secondary antibody (for anti-VacA antibodies) and species-specific Alexa fluor 633-conjugated secondary antibody (for anti-cytochrome c antibody), diluted in blocking buffer, for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. The images were captured by confocal laser microscopy (model TSC SP2; Leica, Heidelberg, Germany) independently with the 488-, 543-, and 633-nm lines of lasers used for excitation of Alexa fluor 488 (Ar/Kr laser, 488 nm), GFP-Rab7 protein (Ar/Kr laser, 488 nm), Mitotracker RED CMXRos (Green He-Ne laser, 543 nm), and Alexa fluor 633 (Red He-Ne laser, 633 nm), respectively.Analysis of Bax and Bak Activation and Cytochrome c Release—AZ-521 cells were seeded (5.0 × 104 cells in 0.2 ml of EMEM/well) and grown overnight on 8-well chamber microscope slides. Then the cells were incubated with VacA (120 nm) before fixation with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After permeabilization for 5 min at room temperature with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and blocking with 1.5% Block Ace in PBS, the cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with active form-specific anti-Bax or Bak antibodies (anti-Bax-NT antibodies and anti-Bak-NT antibodies, respectively), anti-cytochrome c antibody (6H2.B4), and/or anti-mtHSP70 (JG1) antibody (for mitochondrial marker), diluted in blocking buffer, and then incubated with Alexa fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody against mouse IgG (for anti-cytochrome c antibody), Alexa fluor 546-conjugated secondary antibody against mouse IgG (for anti-mtHSP70 antibody), Alexa fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody against rabbit IgG (for anti-Bax-NT and Bak-NT antibodies), and Alexa fluor 546-conjugated secondary antibody against rabbit IgG (for anti-Bax-NT and Bak-NT antibodies), diluted in blocking buffer, for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. The images were captured by confocal laser microscopy independently with the 488- and 543-nm lines of lasers used for excitation of Alexa fluor 488 (Ar/Kr laser, 488 nm) and Alexa fluor 546 (Green He-Ne laser, 543 nm), respectively.RESULTSVacA Induced Cytochrome c Release and Death of Gastric Epithelial AZ-521 Cells—We confirmed that purified VacA induced cytochrome c release from mitochondria in gastric epithelial AZ-521 cells; the release was enhanced by the addition of 5 mm NH4Cl to the incubation medium (Fig. 1A). We also confirmed that cytochrome c release and PARP cleavage in AZ-521 cells were increased by VacA in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1, B and C). In addition, VacA induced AZ-521 cell death, which was similarly enhanced by 5 mm NH4Cl (Fig. 1D).VacA Localization in AZ-521 Cells in Which It Induced Cytochrome c Release—Intracellularly overexpressed full-length VacA or amino-terminal 37-kDa fragment with GFP at the amino terminus was localized to mitochondria (17Galmiche A. Rassow J. Doye A. Cagnol S. Chambard J.C. Contamin S. de Thillot V. Just I. Ricci V. Solcia E. Van Obberghen E. Boquet P.

In another study, purified toxin applied to intact cells was bound in VacA-induced cytoplasmic vacuoles (32Papini E. de Bernard M. Milia E. Bugnoli M. Zerial M. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9720-9724Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 33Li Y. Wandinger-Ness A. Goldenring J.R. Cover T.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1946-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We evaluated VacA localization in AZ-521 cells in which cytochrome c release was induced (Fig. 2A). In AZ-521 cells incubated with VacA, cytochrome c was dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. In contrast, in cells without VacA treatment, cytochrome c appeared to be associated with mitochondria. To determine whether VacA was associated with mitochondria when cytochrome c was released, we used anti-cytochrome c and anti-VacA antibodies with Mitotracker RED (Fig. 2A). Even in cells that exhibited cytochrome c release, most of the VacA was not associated with mitochondria. Consequently, we considered the possibility that VacA localized to VacA-induced cytoplasmic vacuoles. Membranes of VacA-induced vacuoles reacted with antibodies against proteins identified in late endosomal compartments, such as the small GTPase Rab7 (32Papini E. de Bernard M. Milia E. Bugnoli M.

Luzio J.P. Montecucco C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25339-25344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We used GFP-conjugated Rab7 (GFP-Rab7) as a vacuolar marker. VacA induced cytochrome c release in AZ-521 cells overexpressing GFP-Rab7, just as it did in wild-type AZ-521 cells (Fig. 2B). By confocal microscopy, most of VacA appeared to be colocalized with GFP-Rab7 in cells exhibiting cytochrome c release. Furthermore, we examined VacA localization in AZ-521 cells at the early time points. In cells incubated with VacA for 12 h, which is the time point when cytochrome c release was observed in ∼50% of cells (Fig. 1B), most of VacA was co-localized with GFP-Rab-7 rather than Mitotracker RED (Fig. 2C). In addition, in cells incubated with VacA for 3 or 6 h, which were time points prior to optimal cytochrome c release, most of VacA was co-localized with GFP-Rab-7 rather than Mitotracker RED (Fig. 2, D and E). We have also observed nonmitochondrial localization in HeLa cells by immunostaining and confocal analysis with anti-VacA antibodies and antibody against mitochondrial marker protein, mitochondrial HSP70, using similar experimental conditions (data not shown). From these data, it is likely that, when VacA had induced cytochrome c release, most of the toxin did not localize to mitochondria but rather to vacuoles. Nonmitochondrial localization of VacA suggested the involvement of an intracellular factor(s) in VacA-induced cytochrome c release.FIGURE 2VacA localized to vacuoles, but not mitochondria, in VacA-treated AZ-521 cells in which cytochrome (cyto.) c release was stimulated.

https://openalex.org/W2033161660,"Proapoptotic nuclear receptor family member Nur77 translocates from the nucleus to the mitochondria, where it interacts with Bcl-2 to trigger apoptosis. Nur77 translocation is induced by certain apoptotic stimuli, including the synthetic retinoid-related 6-[3-(1-adamantyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl]-2-naphthalenecarboxylic acid (AHPN)/CD437 class. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism by which AHPN/CD437 analog (E)-4-[3-(1-adamantyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl]-3-chlorocinnamic acid (3-Cl-AHPC) induces Nur77 nuclear export. Our results demonstrate that 3-Cl-AHPC effectively activated Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which phosphorylates Nur77. Inhibition of JNK activation by a JNK inhibitor suppressed 3-Cl-AHPC-induced Nur77 nuclear export and apoptosis. In addition, several JNK upstream activators, including the phorbol ester TPA, anisomycin and MAPK kinase kinase-1 (MEKK1), phosphorylated Nur77 and induced its nuclear export. However, Nur77 phosphorylation by JNK, although essential, was not sufficient for inducing Nur77 nuclear export. Induction of Nur77 nuclear export by MEKK1 required a prolonged MEKK1 activation and was attenuated by Akt activation. Expression of constitutively active Akt prevented MEKK1-induced Nur77 nuclear export. Conversely, transfection of dominant-negative Akt or treatment with a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) inhibitor accelerated MEKK1-induced Nur77 nuclear export. Furthermore, mutation of an Akt phosphorylation residue Ser351 in Nur77 abolished the effect of Akt or the PI3-K inhibitor. Together, our results demonstrate that both activation of JNK and inhibition of Akt play a role in translocation of Nur77 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2030320109,"Migrating birds may have transported the Balea land snail across vast distances to remote islands. Charles Darwin thought that snails might cross oceans by hitching a lift on birds. There has been little direct evidence for this, and snail species that seemed closely related have been separated by taxonomists in part on the grounds of the oceans that divide them. But it looks like Darwin was right again: molecular methods reveal the spectacular transequatorial dispersal of the land snail Balea from Europe to the Azores and the Tristan da Cunha islands, and back again. Darwin was fascinated by the transportation of land snails across great swathes of open ocean by birds — he even immersed snails in sea water to see how long they would survive1. Here we follow a molecular phylogenetic trail that reveals the incredible transequatorial dispersal of the land snail Balea from Europe to the Azores and the Tristan da Cunha islands, and back again. This long-distance dispersal is unexpected for what are proverbially considered the most pedestrian of creatures."
https://openalex.org/W2028659881,"Embryonic cell movement is essential for morphogenesis and the establishment of body shapes1,2, but little is known about its mechanism. Here we report that pregnenolone, which is produced from cholesterol by the steroidogenic enzyme Cyp11a1 (cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, P450scc)3, functions in promoting cell migration during epiboly. Epiboly is a process in which embryonic cells spread from the animal pole to cover the underlying yolk. During epiboly, cyp11a1 is expressed in an extra-embryonic yolk syncytial layer4. Reducing cyp11a1 expression in zebrafish using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides did not perturb cell fates, but caused epibolic delay. This epibolic defect was partially rescued by the injection of cyp11a1 RNA or the supplementation of pregnenolone. We show that the epibolic delay is accompanied by a decrease in the level of polymerized microtubules, and that pregnenolone can rescue this microtubule defect. Our results indicate that pregnenolone preserves microtubule abundance and promotes cell movement during epiboly."
https://openalex.org/W2028791725,"The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) inhibitor Emi1 controls progression to S phase and mitosis by stabilizing key APC/C ubiquitination substrates, including cyclin A. Examining Emi1 binding proteins, we identified the Evi5 oncogene as a regulator of Emi1 accumulation. Evi5 antagonizes SCF(betaTrCP)-dependent Emi1 ubiquitination and destruction by binding to a site adjacent to Emi1's DSGxxS degron and blocking both degron phosphorylation by Polo-like kinases and subsequent betaTrCP binding. Thus, Evi5 functions as a stabilizing factor maintaining Emi1 levels in S/G2 phase. Evi5 protein accumulates in early G1 following Plk1 destruction and is degraded in a Plk1- and ubiquitin-dependent manner in early mitosis. Ablation of Evi5 induces precocious degradation of Emi1 by the Plk/SCF(betaTrCP) pathway, causing premature APC/C activation; cyclin destruction; cell-cycle arrest; centrosome overduplication; and, finally, mitotic catastrophe. We propose that the balance of Evi5 and Polo-like kinase activities determines the timely accumulation of Emi1 and cyclin, ensuring mitotic fidelity."
https://openalex.org/W2139251571,"The chromosomal passenger protein aurora kinases have been implicated in regulating chromosome segregation and cell division. Three aurora kinase homologues were identified (TbAUK1, -2 and -3) in the Trypanosome Genomic Data Base, and their expressions in the procyclic form of Trypanosoma brucei were knocked down individually by using the RNA interference technique. Only a knockdown of TbAUK1 arrested the cells in G2/M phase with each cell showing an extended posterior end, two kinetoplasts, and an enlarged nucleus, apparently the result of an inhibited kinetoplast multiplication and a failed mitosis. There is no mitotic spindle structure in the TbAUK1-depleted cell. The two kinetoplasts moved apart from each other but stopped just before cytokinesis, suggesting that cytokinesis was blocked in its early phase. Overexpression of TbAUK1 in the cells resulted in little change in cell growth. By immunofluorescence, TbAUK1 was primarily localized to the nucleus in interphase and to the mitotic spindle during apparent metaphase and anaphase. Thus, differing from other eukaryotes, TbAUK1 has an apparent triple function in coupling mitosis and kinetoplast replication with cytokinesis in T. brucei. T. brucei polo-like kinase, previously identified as the initiator of cytokinesis without apparent involvement in mitosis in the trypanosome, was either depleted or overexpressed in the TbAUK1-deficient cells. A dominant TbAUK1-depleted phenotype was demonstrated in both cases, suggesting that TbAUK1 plays an essential role in cytokinesis that cannot be affected by changes in the level of T. brucei polo-like kinase. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the function of an aurora B-like kinase is a prerequisite for polo-like kinase action in initiating cytokinesis. TbAUK1 is also the first identified protein that couples both mitosis and kinetoplast replication with cytokinesis in the trypanosome.

TbAUK1 is also the first identified protein that couples both mitosis and kinetoplast replication with cytokinesis in the trypanosome. During cell cycle progression in eukaryotes, mitosis is a critical phase in ensuring that the two daughter cells inherit the same genetic back-ground upon subsequent cell division. Although it represents the shortest phase in the metazoan cell cycle, mitosis is when the cell undergoes the most rapid and dramatic structural reorganizations. The interphase microtubule network de-polymerizes between the end of G2 phase and the beginning of prophase (1Zhai Y. Kronebusch P.J. Simon P.M. Borisy G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The centrosomes, which have duplicated during S phase, migrate around the nucleus and form a spindle, whereas chromatin condenses upon the entry into prophase. After spindle formation and nuclear envelope breakdown, the kinetochores capture the plus ends of microtubules and align the chromosomes at the metaphase plate. Two identical sets of chromosomes then begin to separate by decreasing the length of kinetochore fibers in anaphase A (2Desai A. Maddox P.S. Mitchison T.J. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Further separation of the chromosomes takes place by departing the spindle poles in anaphase B, which is followed by cytokinesis initiation and cell division.These mitotic events in metazoa are tightly controlled by a number of regulatory proteins. Among them, the aurora kinases have received much attention recently for their roles in regulating both chromosome dynamics and cytokinesis (3Andrews P.D. Knatko E. Moore W.J. Swedlow J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 672-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 4Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 842-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). Aurora kinases consist of a family of serine/threonine kinases whose multiple roles are well conserved throughout evolution within each subfamily (5Glover D.M. Leibowitz M.H. McLean D.A. Parry H. Cell. 1995; 81: 95-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). A single homologue was found in budding and fission yeasts. A deletion of the homologue (Ipl1) from budding yeast showed abnormal ploidy, suggesting a role in regulating chromosome segregation and cytokinesis for the missing protein (6Bischoff J.R. Plowman G.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 454-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Three chromosome passenger proteins, aurora A, B, and C, were identified in mammals (7Giet R. Prigent C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3591-3601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Chen H.L. Tang C.J. Chen C.Y. Tang T.K. J. Biomed. Sci. 2005; 12: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 10Yan X. Cao L. Li Q. Wu Y. Zhang H. Saiyin H. Liu X. Zhang X. Shi Q. Yu L. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Aurora A and B are essential for mitosis and have distinct and varying localizations in mammalian cells (6Bischoff J.R. Plowman G.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 454-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Aurora A begins to accumulate on the centrosomes during S phase and becomes heavily concentrated at the spindle poles along the spindle microtubules by mitosis. Aurora B localizes first to chromosomes in the prophase and then concentrates at the centromeres during the prometaphase and metaphase. It plays a crucial function by departing from the chromosomes at the onset of anaphase and relocating to the central spindle, where it has another role in initiating cytokinesis (11Terada Y. Tatsuka M. Suzuki F. Yasuda Y. Fujita S. Otsu M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Consistent with their localizations, aurora A regulates spindle assembly, and aurora B controls chromosome segregation and cytokinesis initiation (4Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 842-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). Aurora C was found in testis and certain tumor cell lines and localized to spindle poles during late mitosis (8Katayama H. Brinkley W.R. Sen S. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2003; 22: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar).Trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of sleeping sickness in human and nagana in cattle in sub-Saharan Africa and also among the most ancient and evolutionarily divergent eukaryotes with many unique biological features (12Baldauf S.L. Science. 2003; 300: 1703-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 13Bapteste E. Gribaldo S. Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 696-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The most apparent is the single mitochondrion in each cell, and the arrangement of mitochondrial DNA in a large disk-like structure, the kinetoplast. Replication of the kinetoplast, which has discrete G1, S, G2, and D phases analogous to the four phases of the nuclear cycle (14Matthews K.R. Gull K. Parasitol. Today. 1994; 10: 473-476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), is well coordinated with mitosis (15McKean P.G. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 600-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) but yet can be uncoupled. T. brucei has multiple life cycle stages, of which the growing procyclic (insect) and bloodstream stages have a number of differences in their cell cycle regulations (16Tu X.M. Wang C.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the procyclic form, inhibition of mitosis does not cause the kinetoplast cycle to come to a complete stop but allows continued kinetoplast segregation, cytokinesis, and cell division, giving rise to cells without nucleus (zoids) (17Ploubidou A. Robinson D.R. Docherty R.C. Ogbadoyi E.O. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4641-4650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Li Z. Wang C.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 20519-20528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Conversely, inhibition of the kinetoplast cycle in the procyclic form with okadaic acid results in multinucleate cells with a single kinetoplast (21Das A. Gale Jr., M. Carter V. Parsons M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3477-3483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetoplast is closely associated with the flagellum basal body, and its segregation depends on the flagellum-mediated separation of replicated basal bodies, representing initiation of cytokinesis (22Ploubidou A. Gull K. Nature. 1991; 352: 731-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The kinetoplast cycle alone can apparently drive up to 20% of the procyclic form cells into cell division without completing mitosis, a phenomenon not observed in the bloodstream form (16Tu X.M. Wang C.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) or any other eukaryotes (20Tu X.M. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20519-20528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 23Tu X.M. Wang C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 97-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a homologue of polo-like kinase in T. brucei (TbPLK) 2The abbreviations used are: TbPLK T. brucei polo-like kinase; RNAi, RNA interference; HA, hemagglutinin; RT, reverse transcription; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; PI, propidium iodide; DAPI, 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; GFP, green fluorescent protein; 2The abbreviations used are: TbPLK T. brucei polo-like kinase; RNAi, RNA interference; HA, hemagglutinin; RT, reverse transcription; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; PI, propidium iodide; DAPI, 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; GFP, green fluorescent protein; is localized in the potential flagellum attachment zones and apparently initiates only cytokinesis without an apparent role in mitosis as is the case with the polo-like kinases in other eukaryotes (24Kumar P. Wang C.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 92-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It further illustrates that the regulatory networks that correlate mitosis and cytokinesis are different in T. brucei.In this study, we identified three aurora kinase homologues in T. brucei. However, only one of them is apparently involved in cell cycle regulation. This aurora kinase, TbAUK1, localizes in the nucleus, is concentrated in the central spindle during mitosis, and plays an essential role in forming mitotic spindles. It controls mitosis, kinetoplast replication, as well as initiation of cytokinesis. Overexpression and depletion of TbPLK in aurora-deficient cells showed a consistently dominant TbAUK1-depleted phenotype, suggesting an essential role of TbAUK1 in regulating cytokinesis in trypanosome.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Cultures—Procyclic form T. brucei strain 29-13 cells (25Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar) were cultivated at 26 °C in Cunningham's medium (26Cunningham I. J. Protozool. 1977; 21: 325-329Crossref Scopus (349) Google Scholar) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biological, Lawrenceville, GA). G-418 (15 μg/ml) and hygromycin B (50 μg/ml) were included in the culture medium to maintain the T7-RNA polymerase and tetracycline-repressor gene constructs in the cells.RNA Interference (RNAi)—Partial cDNA fragments (250-550 bp) of three aurora kinase homologues (designated TbAUK1, -2, and -3; Trypanosome Genomic Data Base accession numbers Tb11.01.0330, Tb03.28C22.460, and Tb09.160.0570) were amplified by PCR using pairs of gene-specific primers and ligated into the pZJM vector by replacing the α-tubulin fragment in the vector (27Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). For the double knockdown of TbAUK1 and TbPLK (Trypanosome Genomic Data Base accession number Tb07.2F2.640), partial cDNA fragments (250-550 bp) of these two genes were amplified, ligated together, and cloned into the pZJM vector. The resulting RNAi constructs were linearized with NotI for integration into the T. brucei rDNA spacer region. Transfection of strain 29-13 with the linearized DNA constructs by electroporation was performed essentially as described previously (20Tu X.M. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20519-20528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The transfectants were selected under 2.5 μg/ml phleomycin with individual cells cloned by limiting dilutions on agarose plates (28Carruthers V.B. Cross G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8818-8821Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The stable transfectants thus selected were grown in the culture medium containing phleomycin.Transcription of the DNA insert was induced by adding 1 μg/ml tetracycline to the medium to switch on the T7 promoter. The double-stranded RNA thus synthesized is expected to lead to specific degradation of its corresponding mRNA in T. brucei (29Bastin P. Ellis K. Kohl L. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3321-3328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Moreira-Leite F.F. Sherwin T. Kohl L. Gull K. Science. 2001; 294: 610-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To evaluate the effect of each RNAi on cell proliferation, cell numbers were counted at different time intervals using a hemocytometer.Semi-quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from T. brucei cells using the TRIzol reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and treated with DNase I (Roche Applied Science) to digest the remaining DNA. RT-PCR was then performed using the one-step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) and a pair of gene-specific primers that differs from the primer pair used in generating the original RNAi construct.Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS) Analysis—Cell samples for FACS were prepared and analyzed as described previously (20Tu X.M. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20519-20528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The propidium iodide (PI)-stained cell samples from FACS analysis were subsequently examined with an Olympus phase-contrast and fluorescence microscope to tabulate the numbers of nuclei and kinetoplasts in individual cells and the numbers of cells with different morphologies in populations of more than 200 cells in each sample.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—For immunofluorescence experiments, cells were harvested, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 8 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4), and fixed with cold methanol at -20 °C for 20 min (16Tu X.M. Wang C.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The fixed cells were washed and blocked in a blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline) at room temperature for 60 min and incubated with the primary antibody at room temperature for another 60 min. The following primary antibodies were used: YL1/2 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA; rat monoclonal antibody against yeast tyrosinated α-tubulin, used at 1:400 dilution); ROD1 (from Dr. Keith Gull, Oxford University; mouse monoclonal antibody against two paraflagellar rod proteins; used without dilution); KMX-1 antibody against mitotic spindles (from Dr. Keith Gull, Oxford University, mouse monoclonal antibody against Physarum polycephalum amoebal tubulin protein); and the HA probe for HA3 tag (sc-7392 RTIC; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rat IgG antibody (diluted 1:400; Sigma), Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (diluted 1:300; Sigma), or Alexa Fluor 488 (A-21422; Molecular Probes) was then applied, and the cells were incubated at room temperature for another 60 min. Slides were mounted in Vectashield in the presence of 1 μg/ml 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and examined with a fluorescence microscope with the facility of confocal microscopy.Overexpression of TbAUK1-3HA in Procyclic Form T. brucei—The full-length gene of TbAUK1 was amplified by PCR using primers that had a HindIII site at the 5′-end and a BamHI site at the 3′-end of the gene. The reverse primer also contained the sequence of a triple hemagglutinin tag (HA tag) to the C terminus of TbAUK1 in-frame with the gene sequence. The PCR-amplified TbAUK1-3HA was cloned into the HindIII/BamHI-digested pLew100 vector (25Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar), which places the expression of the inserted gene under the control of a tetracycline-inducible T7 promoter. The cloned construct was linearized with NotI and transfected into the procylic form T. brucei 29-13 cells (25Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). Stable transfectants were selected under 2.5 μg/ml phleomycin. Expression of TbAUK1-3HA was induced by adding 0.1 μg/ml tetracycline to the culture medium.Overexpression and Knockdown of TbPLK in TbAUK1-depleted Procyclic Form T. brucei—For overexpression, a modified pLew100 vector containing a full-length TbPLK gene with a GFP tag at the C terminus (24Kumar P. Wang C.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 92-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was transfected into the RNAi TbAUK1-depleted procyclic form cells by electroporation as described previously (20Tu X.M. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20519-20528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For double knockdowns, a pZJM plasmid containing the conjugated cDNA fragments of TbPLK and TbAUK1 was linearized and introduced into the procyclic form cells (20Tu X.M. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20519-20528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were selected under 5 μg/ml puromycin. The stable transfectant thus obtained was then induced with 1 μg/ml tetracycline to switch on the T7 promoter, to initiate both the TbAUK1 RNAi and the TbPLK overexpression or the double knockdown simultaneously. After a 1-day induction, the cells were collected, and the levels of TbPLK-GFP, TbPLK, and TbAUK1 mRNAs were examined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and the overexpressed protein by Western blotting. The cell sample after a 1-day induction was also analyzed by FACScan, and the morphology of cells was examined by epifluorescence microscopy as described previously.RESULTSIdentification of Aurora Homologues in Trypanosome Genomic Data Base—Three aurora kinase homologues were identified in the Trypanosome Genomic Data Base and assigned TbAUK1, -2, and -3. They showed 30-40% sequence identity and 50-60% sequence similarity with the human and yeast aurora kinases except for TbAUK3, which has a longer sequence at the C terminus than the others. All three homologues have a signature motif (DFGWSXXXXXXXRXTXCGTXDYLPPE) in the activation loop specific for aurora kinases in the catalytic domain (7Giet R. Prigent C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3591-3601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They also possess the D (destruction)-box (LLXXXPXXRXXLXXXXXHPW) near the C terminus that is common to all aurora kinases (Fig. 1). But none of the three trypanosome auroras has the A-box domain, which is a specific structural feature of mammalian aurora A. Thus, none of the three enzymes could be a close homologue of aurora A. A careful alignment of the protein sequences suggests that all the three auroras are close homologues of aurora B kinase and the yeast aurora Ipl1 (Fig. 1)RNAi of the Expression of Aurora Homologues in Procyclic Form T. brucei—We employed the RNAi technique to knock down expression of the three aurora homologue genes (TbAUK1, TbAUK2, and TbAUK3) in the procyclic form T. brucei. A 250-500-bp DNA fragment corresponding to a unique sequence from the coding region of each gene with no significant sequence identity among the rest of the genomic sequences in the Trypanosome Genomic Data Base was amplified by PCR, cloned into the RNAi vector pZJM, linearized, and transfected into the cells (see “Materials and Methods”).The effects of RNAi on expression of the three TbAUK genes were examined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 2A, insets, and supplemental Fig. 1). In all cases, levels of the targeted mRNAs diminished significantly after 3 days of RNAi.FIGURE 2Effects of TbAUK1 knockdown on the procyclic form T. brucei cells. A, strain 29-13 cells harboring the TbAUK1-RNAi construct were incubated at 26 °C in culture medium without (-Tet) or with (+Tet) 1.0 μg/ml tetracycline with the number of cells monitored daily. The insets show the intracellular mRNA level after 3 days of RNAi as monitored by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. α-Tubulin mRNA (TUB) was assayed as a sampling control. B, time samples of RNAi-induced TbAUK1-depleted cells were collected and stained with PI and analyzed by FACS for DNA content. The plots from FACScan are shown in the left panel, and the percentages of cells in G1, S, and G2/M phases determined by the ModFitLT software are shown in the right panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The potential effects of the aurora RNAi were monitored by daily counting of the numbers of transfected cells after tetracycline induction (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. 1). The results indicated that a knockdown of TbAUK1 led to a significant inhibition of the increase in cells such that the cell number after 4 days was only 12% of that of the uninduced control. A knockdown of TbAUK2 or TbAUK3, however, did not have any detectable effect on the increase of cell number (supplemental Fig. 1).Effect of Aurora Depletion on Cell Cycle Progression—FACS analysis of the cellular DNA content indicated that after 16 h of RNAi on expression of TbAUK1, there were a significant enrichment of G2/M phase cells and a dramatic reduction in G1 cells (Fig. 2B). This apparent arrest of cell cycle progression at G2/M is more immediate than that from knocking down the cdc2-related kinases in our previous studies (20Tu X.M. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20519-20528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 23Tu X.M. Wang C.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 97-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There was also the emergence of a sub-G1 peak, which could represent the apoptotic cells resulting from the drastic cell cycle arrest. After a 24-h knockdown, the G1 phase and S phase cell populations decreased from ∼45 to 13% and 42 to 18%, respectively, whereas the G2/M phase cells increased from 13 to 69% (Fig. 2B). Depletion of TbAUK2 or TbAUK3 produced virtually no detectable shift in the cell population (supplemental Figs. 1 and 2), suggesting that TbAUK1 is the critical kinase involved in regulating entrance into mitosis during cell cycle progression of T. brucei, whereas function of the other two homologues in mitosis, if any, is not easily identified at present. All the subsequent studies were thus focused on TbAUK1.Unusual Morphologies of the TbAUK1-deficient Cells—The PI-stained TbAUK1-depleted procyclic form cells were examined with a fluorescence microscope to tabulate the population of cells with one nucleus + one kinetoplast (1N1K), one nucleus + two kinetoplasts (1N2K), two nuclei + two kinetoplasts (2N2K), or no nucleus + one kinetoplast (0N1K, the zoids). After 8 h of RNAi induction, there was no obvious difference between the induced and the uninduced cells (Fig. 3A). After a 24-h RNAi induction, however, there was a significant decrease in the 1N1K population from 75 to 17%, which was accompanied by an increased population of 1N2K cells from 12-53% (Fig. 3A). This dramatic conversion of 1N1K cells to 1N2K cells within such a short time likely represents a blocked mitosis plus an uninhibited single round of kinetoplast segregation, which is known to occur ahead of mitosis (17Ploubidou A. Robinson D.R. Docherty R.C. Ogbadoyi E.O. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4641-4650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). But this round of kinetoplast segregation is not followed by another round of kinetoplast replication, indicating inhibition of further kinetoplast replication by depleting TbAUK1. Furthermore, cytokinesis initiation leading to large numbers of zoids and 1N1K cells, as we have observed in the G2/M cells through knocking down CycB2 or CRK3 (18Li Z. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20652-20658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 20Tu X.M. Wang C.C. J. Biol.

TbAUK1 is thus probably playing a critical role in promoting mitotic exit, dictating further kinetoplast replication and initiating cytokinesis in the procyclic form T. brucei. This is the first protein identified in our study thus far that plays an apparent role of linking mitosis and kinetoplast replication with cytokinesis. (There was also a slight increase of the 2N2K population from 11 to 18% and an enhancement of the zoid population from 1 to 6%, which may reflect a residual progression of mitosis, kinetoplast replication, and cytokinesis resulting from an incomplete knockdown of TbAUK1 expression.)FIGURE 3Morphological phenotypes of TbAUK1-deficient procyclic form T. brucei.

After 24 h of RNAi, cells in the enhanced 1N2K population had an elongated posterior end and an enlarged and stretched nucleus (Fig. 3B). The two kinetoplasts in these cells moved apart from each other with one lying close to the nucleus and the other moving close to the posterior tip of the cell (Fig. 3B). This separation between two kinetoplasts has been known to signal the initiation of cytokinesis following the completion of mitosis in the procyclic form T. brucei (17Ploubidou A. Robinson D.R. Docherty R.C. Ogbadoyi E.O. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4641-4650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Apparently, the kinetoplast-driven cell cycle in the TbAUK1 knockdown cells has reached the point of initiating cytokinesis, but it is incapable of doing so.Further Characterizations of the TbAUK1-deficient Cells—The TbAUK1-depleted cells were subjected to further immunofluorescence analysis, using the YL1/2 antibody to stain the basal body (31Kilmartin J.V.

https://openalex.org/W2033991006,"Insertions and deletions in coding sequences can alter the reading frame of genes and have profound biological consequences. In 1966, Streisinger proposed that these mutations result from strand slippage, which in repetitive sequences generates misaligned intermediates stabilized by correct base pairing that support polymerization. We report here crystal structures of human DNA polymerase λ, which frequently generates deletion mutations, bound to such intermediates. Each contains an extrahelical template nucleotide upstream of the active site. Surprisingly, the extra nucleotide, even when combined with an adjacent mismatch, does not perturb polymerase active site geometry, which is indistinguishable from that for correctly aligned strands. These structures reveal how pol λ can polymerize on substrates with minimal homology during repair of double-strand breaks and represent strand-slippage intermediates consistent with Streisinger's classical hypothesis. They are thus relevant to the origin of single-base deletions, a class of mutations that can confer strong biological phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2057620884,"The small heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) is an oligomeric, molecular chaperone in vitro. This chaperone activity and other physiological roles attributed to Hsp27 have been reported to depend on the state of self-association. In the present work, we have used sedimentation velocity experiments to demonstrate that the self-association of Hsp27 is independent of pH and ionic strength but increases significantly as the temperature is increased from 10 to 40 °C. The largest oligomers formed at 10 °C are ∼8-12 mer, whereas at 40 °C oligomers as large as 22-30 mer are observed. Similarly, the chaperone activity of Hsp27 as indicated by its ability to inhibit dithiothreitol-induced insulin aggregation also increases with increased temperature, with a particularly sharp increase in activity as temperature is increased from 34 to 43 °C. Similar studies of an Hsp27 triple variant that mimics the behavior of the phosphorylated protein establish that this protein has greatly diminished chaperone activity that responds minimally to increased temperature. We conclude that Hsp27 can exploit a large number of oligomerization states and that the range of oligomer size and the magnitude of chaperone activity increase significantly as temperature is increased over the range that is relevant to the physiological heat shock response."
https://openalex.org/W2074270952,"In order to obtain a comprehensive picture of the molecular events regulating cutaneous photodamage of intact human epidermis, suction blister roofs obtained after a single dose of in vivo ultraviolet (UV)B exposure were used for microarray profiling. We found a changed expression of 619 genes. Half of the UVB-regulated genes had returned to pre-exposure baseline levels at 72 h, underscoring the transient character of the molecular cutaneous UVB response. Of special interest was our finding that several of the central p53 target genes remained unaffected following UVB exposure in spite of p53 protein accumulation. We next compared the in vivo expression profiles of epidermal sheets to that of cultured human epidermal keratinocytes exposed to UVB in vitro. We found 1931 genes that differed in their expression profiles between the two groups. The expression profile in intact epidemis was geared mainly towards DNA repair, whereas cultured keratinocytes responded predominantly by activating genes associated with cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. These differences in expression profiles might reflect differences between mature differentiating keratinocytes in the suprabasal epidermal layers versus exponentially proliferating keratinocytes in cell culture. Our findings show that extreme care should be taken when extrapolating from findings based on keratinocyte cultures to changes in intact epidermis."

Akt or protein kinase B (Akt/PKB) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that functions as a regulator of cell survival and proliferation (27Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S.

Akt/PKB is activated by PI3K through site-specific phosphorylation. Full activation of Akt requires phosphorylation of Ser473 (31Song G. Ouyang G. Bao S. J. Cell Mol.

Some have suggested that Akt could be activated in a PI3K-independent manner (31Song G. Ouyang G. Bao S. J. Cell Mol. Med. 2005; 9: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar, 32Osaki M. Oshimura M. Ito H. Apoptosis. 2004; 9: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar), but the physiological significance of these findings remains poorly established. Akt-binding proteins have also been reported to regulate Akt activity (29Brazil D.P. Park J. Hemmings B.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 293-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). For example, the carboxyl-terminal modulator protein inhibits signaling by direct binding to Akt, leading to reduced phosphorylation at its Ser473 residue. By contrast, proteins like Hsp90 positively regulate Akt by promoting refolding or stabilization (31Song G. Ouyang G. Bao S. J. Cell Mol. Med. 2005; 9: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar). Akt, in response to growth factors and other extracellular stimuli, regulates normal cellular functions, including nutrient metabolism, cell growth, apoptosis, and survival (27Delcommenne M. Tan C.

To ask if abnormal activation of Akt may contribute to ATL development, we investigated the role of the HTLV-1 Tax oncoprotein in this cellular pathway. Here, Tax activation of Akt was found to lead to enhanced downstream AP-1 activity. In the absence of NF-κB activation, this Tax-Akt signaling through AP-1 was sufficient to induce cellular proliferation, maintain cell survival, and promote foci formation.

Cell Culture, Transfection, and AP-1 Reporter Assays—Jurkat, H9, A3.01, and CEM-SS are spontaneous human T-cell lines, whereas C8166-45 (C81), MT4, and HUT102 are human T-cell lines transformed with HTLV-1 and express the viral Tax protein. All cells grow in suspension and were propagated in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF E6i), human fibroblast (BJ), and African green monkey kidney cell line (CV-1) were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FCS and transfected according to the manufacturer's protocol using Lipofectamine and Plus reagent (Invitrogen). 3 h after transfection, the cell culture was replaced with fresh medium. To assay luciferase activity, cells were transfected with plasmid DNA mixture containing reporter plasmids, 100 ng of AP-1-Luc, and 100 ng of RSV-β-galactosidase. Total amounts of plasmid DNA were normalized by the addition of pCDNA3. Cells were washed twice with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then lysed in 1× luciferase lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase assay substrate (Promega) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol, and activity was measured in an Opticom II luminometer (MGM Instruments). β-Galactosidase activity was measured using Galacto-Star (Tropix), as described by the manufacturer. Luciferase activities were normalized for transfection efficiency based on galactosidase readings. All transfections were performed at least three times. Error bars represent S.D. values. Immunofluorescent Microscopy—Cells were cultured on sterile glass coverslips, washed in PBS, and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. To prevent nonspecific binding, cells were first incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. Incubation with primary antibodies was carried out for 1 h at room temperature. Alexa 488- or Alexa 568-conjugated secondary antibodies were then incubated for 45 min at room temperature. DNA was counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (0.1 μg/ml). Coverslips were then mounted in Prolong Antifade (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) on glass slides. A Leica TCS-NP/SP confocal microscope was used to visualize the slides. Immunoprecipitation—For co-immunoprecipitations, HTLV-1-transformed C81 and MT4 cell lines or control cell lines (H9 and CEM-SS) were pelleted by centrifugation, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended into radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4), 1 mm sodium fluoride (NaF), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease mixture from Roche). Total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-Tax (National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program) or anti-p85α or anti-p110α (Upstate Biotechnology) antibodies with agarose beads overnight at 4 °C. The co-immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-P85α, anti-p110α (BD Biosciences), and anti-Tax antibodies (National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program) as indicated. In Vitro Kinase Assays—MEFs were transfected with HA-tagged Akt alone or in combination with different Tax plasmids. 24 h after transfection, cells were starved by culturing in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1% FCS for 12 h prior to exposure to PDGF (20 ng/ml) and before lysis for kinase assay. Cells were washed in cold PBS and lysed in 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4. Equivalent protein concentrations of cell lysates (determined by Bradford assay) were precleared with nonspecific IgG and protein A-Sepharose. After centrifugation, the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. Kinase assays were carried out in kinase assay buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 μm ATP) for 30 min at 37 °C. GST-GSK-3 (GSK-3) peptide (Cell Signaling) was used as a substrate for Akt. Phosphorylated GSK-3 proteins were electrophoresed in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for detection. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and visualized by autoradiography. Cell Proliferation and Apoptosis—Cell proliferation was determined by using either direct cell counting or the Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, after transfection, 50,000-100,000 cells/well were plated in a 96-well plate. After 24, 48, or 72 h, 10 μl of Cell Counting Kit-8 solution (2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt) (Dojindo) was added to each well and incubated for 1-4 h. The cell viability in each well was determined by reading the optical density at 450 nm. After treatment with either LY294002 (20 μm) or mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (100 ng/ml) for 8 h, cells were harvested, and apoptosis was determined using an annexin V/7-amino-actinomycin (7-AAD) apoptosis detection kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, annexin V is a Ca2+-dependent phospholipid-binding protein that has a high affinity for phosphatidylserine and is useful for identifying apoptotic cells with exposed PS. 7-AAD is a standard flow cytometry viability probe and is used to distinguish viable from nonviable cells. Viable cells with intact membranes exclude 7-AAD, whereas the membranes of dead and damaged cells are permeable to 7-AAD. Cells that stain positive for annexin V and negative for 7-AAD are beginning to undergo apoptosis. Cells that stain positive for both annexin V and 7-AAD are either in the end stage of apoptosis, undergoing necrosis, or already dead. Cells that stain negative for both annexin V and 7-AAD are alive and not experiencing measurable apoptosis. Focus Formation Assays—CV-1 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of Akt WT alone or in combination with different Tax plasmids (0.5 μg). 24 h after transfection, cells were removed from the confluent layer with trypsin and plated at 1 × 105 cells/dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 1% FCS. The cultures were maintained in the same medium, with medium changes every 3 days, until the appearance of cell foci was evident (between 21 and 35 days after transfection). Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—Jurkat and C81 cells (5 × 106 cells/ml) were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. The cells were cultured either unstimulated or stimulated with 50 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma). Aliquots of the cell culture supernatant were removed and assayed for levels of PDGF using the human PDGF-BB Quantikine ELISA kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The detection limit for PDGF-BB was 10 pg/ml. Tax Activates Akt/Protein Kinase B—Alterations in many signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation are seen in transformed cells. Akt or protein kinase B (Akt/PKB) is a serine/threonine kinase that impacts numerous cellular processes. PI3K is an upstream regulator of Akt (31Song G. Ouyang G. Bao S. J. Cell Mol. Med. 2005; 9: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar, 32Osaki M. Oshimura M. Ito H. Apoptosis. 2004; 9: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar, 48Dong Z. Huang C. Ma W.Y.

Signal. 2002; 14: 381-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar), and dysregulation of the PI3K-Akt pathway is frequent in many human cancers. Abnormal activation of transcription factors downstream of PI3K/Akt such as NF-κB and AP-1 has also been linked to the promotion of cellular transformation (31Song G. Ouyang G. Bao S. J. Cell Mol. Med. 2005; 9: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar, 32Osaki M. Oshimura M. Ito H. Apoptosis. 2004; 9: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar, 48Dong Z. Huang C. Ma W.Y.

The HTLV-1 Tax oncoprotein is known to activate NF-κB, and this activation has long been considered to be the primary impetus for ATL transformation (50Grassmann R. Aboud M. Jeang K.T. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5976-5985Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Whether other factors besides NF-κB contribute to ATL have not been well defined. In a Rat-1 cell culture model of Tax transformation, the PI3K/Akt pathway was reported to be highly activated (51Liu Y. Wang Y. Yamakuchi M. Masuda S. Tokioka T. Yamaoka S. Maruyama I. Kitajima I. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2514-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Here, the contribution in human and mouse cells of the PI3K/Akt pathway to Tax-induced changes in cell growth was investigated. Nuclear translocation of Akt has been previously described in cells treated with growth factor, and this occurrence is thought to reflect Akt activation (31Song G. Ouyang G. Bao S. J. Cell Mol. Med. 2005; 9: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar, 32Osaki M. Oshimura M. Ito H. Apoptosis. 2004; 9: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar, 48Dong Z. Huang C. Ma W.Y. Anticancer Res. 1999; 19: 3743-3747PubMed Google Scholar, 49Nicholson K.M. Anderson N.G. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 381-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when we transfected fresh primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with GFP-Tax and an HA-Akt plasmid, Akt staining consistent with activation was observed in the nucleus (Fig. 1A). To confirm that this nuclear localization indeed reflected activation, we checked the phosphorylation profile of Akt (using anti-phospho-Ser473 antibody) in Tax-transfected primary MEFs (Fig. 1B) and in three Tax-expressing HTLV-1 transformed T-cell lines (C8166-45, MT4, and HUT102) (Fig. 1C). In both settings, when compared with controls (Fig. 1, B, lanes 1 and 2, and C, lanes 1 and 2), phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473,as a measure of activation, was greatly enhanced in the Tax-expressing cells (Fig. 1, B, lanes 3 and 4, and C, lanes 3-5). Activation of Akt by Tax Is Growth Factor-independent but PI3K-dependent—Constitutive activation of Akt/PKB is frequent in highly invasive cancers (31Song G. Ouyang G. Bao S. J. Cell Mol. Med. 2005; 9: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar, 52Testa J.R. Bellacosa A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10983-10985Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar, 53West K.A. Castillo S.S. Dennis P.A. Drug. Resist. Updat. 2002; 5: 234-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Some investigators have suggested that growth factor (i.e. PDGF)-independent activation of Akt plays an important role in the resistance of cancers to chemotherapy (31Song G. Ouyang G. Bao S. J. Cell Mol. Med. 2005; 9: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar, 37Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5145) Google Scholar, 52Testa J.R. Bellacosa A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10983-10985Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar, 53West K.A. Castillo S.S. Dennis P.A. Drug. Resist. Updat. 2002; 5: 234-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is a particularly aggressive form of cancer that resists chemotherapy (54Kannagi M. Harashima N. Kurihara K. Utsunomiya A. Tanosaki R. Masuda M. Expert Rev. Anticancer Ther. 2004; 4: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We thus wondered if Akt activity in the setting of the HTLV-1 Tax oncoprotein is growth factor-independent. We transfected primary MEFs cultured in low serum medium with combinations of a HA-Akt plasmid with/without a Tax plasmid and with/without PDGF treatment. 48 h after transfection of cells, HA-tagged Akt was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA, and Akt activity was measured by in vitro kinase assays (Fig. 2A). Under such conditions of relative serum deprivation, Akt immunoprecipitated from primary MEF was inactive for in vitro phosphorylation of a glycogen synthase 3-kinase, GS3K, peptide (Fig. 2A, lane 2). PDGF is a survival factor that inhibits apoptosis and promotes cell proliferation through activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway (31Song G. Ouyang G. Bao S. J. Cell Mol. Med. 2005; 9: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar, 55Harrington E.A. Bennett M.R. Fanidi A. Evan G.I. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). When we added PDGF (20 ng/ml) to our cells cultured in low serum medium, this addition was sufficient to activate Akt as measured by phosphorylation of GS3K (Fig. 2A, lane 3). Interestingly, when HA-Akt was immunoprecipitated from Tax-transfected MEFs cultured in low serum medium, this moiety capably phosphorylated GS3K peptide in vitro (Fig. 2A, lane 5) without needing PDGF treatment. These results are consistent with the chemotherapy-resistant profile of ATL cells and suggest that Tax activates Akt in a growth factor-independent manner. The above transfection findings indicate that Akt might be constitutively active in ATL cells regardless of growth factor stimulation. To check this prediction, we cultured HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines, C8166-45 (C81) and MT4, in reduced serum (1% FCS) for 24 h and then assessed their Akt status by Western blotting using anti-phospho-Ser473. Both C81 and MT4 cells maintained high levels of ambiently phosphorylated Akt (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 3), whereas control CEM-SS T-cell line, negative for Tax expression, showed no detectable phospho-Akt (Fig. 2B, lane 1). We next asked whether this Akt-phosphorylation in Tax-expressing cells is PI3K signaling-dependent. PI3Ks are heterodimeric lipid kinases composed of regulatory and catalytic subunits that are encoded by different genes. The regulatory subunits of PI3Ks are encoded by one of the three genes (α, β, and γ), which are also subject to alternative splicing. The p110 catalytic subunit is also encoded by three genes (α, β, and δ). Class IA PI3Ks (p110α-p85α) are activated by receptor tyrosine kinases, and deregulation of their function has been implicated in several human cancers (15Fresno Vara J.A. Casado E. de Castro J. Cejas P. Belda-Iniesta C. Gonzalez-Baron M. Cancer Treat. Rev. 2004; 30: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar, 53West K.A. Castillo S.S. Dennis P.A. Drug. Resist. Updat. 2002; 5: 234-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). To address this question, C81 and MT4 cells were treated for 12 h with two different PI3K inhibitors, either LY294002 (a reversible inhibitor of the PI3K ATP binding site) or wortmannin (an irreversible inhibitor that binds to the p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K) (32Osaki M.

https://openalex.org/W2055614021,"Apo chicken liver bile acid-binding protein has been structurally characterized by NMR. The dynamic behavior of the protein in its apo- and holo-forms, complexed with chenodeoxycholate, has been determined via 15N relaxation and steady state heteronuclear 15N(1H) nuclear Overhauser effect measurements. The dynamic parameters were obtained at two pH values (5.6 and 7.0) for the apoprotein and at pH 7.0 for the holoprotein, using the model free approach. Relaxation studies, performed at three different magnetic fields, revealed a substantial conformational flexibility on the microsecond to millisecond time scales, mainly localized in the C-terminal face of the β-barrel. The observed dynamics are primarily caused by the protonation/deprotonation of a buried histidine residue, His98, located on this flexible face. A network of polar buried side chains, defining a spine going from the E to J strand, is likely to provide the long range connectivity needed to communicate motion from His98 to the EF loop region. NMR data are accompanied by molecular dynamics simulations, suggesting that His98 protonation equilibrium is the triggering event for the modulation of a functionally important motion, i.e. the opening/closing at the protein open end, whereas ligand binding stabilizes one of the preexisting conformations (the open form). The results presented here, complemented with an analysis of proteins belonging to the intracellular lipid-binding protein family, are consistent with a model of allosteric activation governing the binding mechanism. The functional role of this mechanism is thoroughly discussed within the framework of the mechanism for the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids.

The functional role of this mechanism is thoroughly discussed within the framework of the mechanism for the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids. Recent studies have shown that bile acids not only serve as the physiological detergents that facilitate absorption, transport, and distribution of lipid-soluble vitamins and dietary fats but also are the signaling molecules that activate nuclear receptors and regulate bile acid and cholesterol metabolism. In addition, bile acids induce the cytochrome P450 3A family of cytochrome P450 enzymes that detoxify bile acids, drugs, and xenobiotics in the liver and intestine, induce hepatocyte apoptosis, and activate the gene encoding a candidate bile acid transporter protein (1Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M. Luk A. Hull M.V. Lustig K.D. Mangelsdorf D.J. Shan B. Science. 1999; 284: 1362-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar). Given the important role of bile acids, the study of their transport at a molecular level is of special medical and pharmacological interest. In this line it is essential to gain insight into the three-dimensional structures and dynamic behavior of proteins, in their free and complexed forms, involved in bile acid recycling.Interestingly, bile acids have been suggested to be the putative ligands of a group of intracellular lipid-binding proteins (iLBPs) 2The abbreviations used are:iLBP,intracellularlipid-bindingprotein;ASBT,apicalsodium-dependent bile salt transporter; cl-BABP, chicken liver bile acid-binding protein; FABP, fatty acid-binding protein; BABP, bile acid-binding protein; ILBP, ileal lipidbinding protein; MD, molecular dynamics; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; PDB, Protein Data Bank; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; BSEP, bile salt export pump. 2The abbreviations used are:iLBP,intracellularlipid-bindingprotein;ASBT,apicalsodium-dependent bile salt transporter; cl-BABP, chicken liver bile acid-binding protein; FABP, fatty acid-binding protein; BABP, bile acid-binding protein; ILBP, ileal lipidbinding protein; MD, molecular dynamics; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; PDB, Protein Data Bank; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; BSEP, bile salt export pump. or fatty acidbinding proteins (FABP), expressed in the liver of nonmammalian species, and referred to previously as liver basic FABP. FABPs have been classified and described on the basis of the organ that they were initially isolated from, but several instances are known in which more than one FABP type has been shown to be produced by a single tissue. We have reported previously on the higher similarity of liver basic FABPs from nonmammalian species with ileal lipid-binding protein (ILBP) rather than with mammalian liver FABP (2Vasile F. Ragona L. Catalano M. Zetta L. Perduca M. Monaco H. Molinari H. J. Biomol. NMR. 2003; 25: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In agreement with this observation, bile acid binding and transport is emerging as the specific function of the liver nonmammalian subfamily, hence called liver bile acid-binding protein (BABP) (2Vasile F.

At variance, the paralogous proteins expressed in the same tissue but in mammals play a role in fatty acid binding and transport (4Thompson J. Reese-Wagoner A. Banaszak L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A multiple alignment of all the known sequences of nonmammalian liver BABPs with ILBPs is reported in Fig. 1.It has been proposed that internal protein dynamics in iLBPs could be intimately connected with ligand recognition and interaction (2Vasile F.

We report here a structural and dynamic study on chicken liver BABP (cl-BABP), in its apo- and holo-form, combining heteronuclear NMR experiments and 15N NMR relaxation measurements with MD simulations. We investigate the role of the protonation state of a buried histidine on protein dynamics. We discuss here the observed change in dynamics upon ligand binding in terms of an allosteric activation mechanism, i.e. a shift between inactive and active conformations (9Volkman B.F. Lipson D. Wemmer D.E. Kern D. Science. 2001; 291: 2429-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The proposed mechanism for ligand binding in cl-BABP is further analyzed in light of data reported for other members of the iLBP family and discussed as functional to bile acid enterohepatic circulation.MATERIALS AND METHODSProtein Expression and Purification—Recombinant cl-BABP was expressed as soluble protein in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) bearing the recombinant plasmid pET24d. Transformed cells were grown on plates containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin. One liter of LB was inoculated with an overnight culture and incubated at 310 K until cells reached an A600 of 0.8. Protein expression was induced by addition of 0.7 mm isopropylthiogalactopyranoside and incubation continued overnight at 293 K. The cells were harvested and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 10% sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0). After lysis, the supernatant, containing cl-BABP, was loaded on a DEAE-cellulose (Whatman) anion exchange column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8. The same buffer was used for protein elution. Fractions containing cl-BABP were concentrated and resolved on a Sephacryl S-100 HR (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 m NaCl, pH 7.2. cl-BABP was delipidated as described (10Glatz J.F. van der Vusse G.J. Prog. Lipid Res. 1996; 35: 243-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The protein purity was checked by the presence of a single band on SDS-PAGE and by mass spectrometry. The protein yields were 90 mg/liter of bacterial culture. 15N isotope labeling was achieved using M9 minimal media containing 1 g/liter 15NH4Cl, following protocols reported in the literature (11Marley J. Lu M. Bracken C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). The extent of 15N labeling was verified by MALDI mass analysis, and the isotope incorporation was found to be more than 92%. [15N]cl-BABP was obtained in a yield of 50 mg/liter of minimal media. 13C,15N double labeling was obtained with the same procedure using M9 minimal media containing 1 g/liter 15NH4Cl and 4 g/liter 13C-enriched sucrose. The extent of labeling, verified by MALDI mass analysis, was >90%, and yields of 25 mg/liter of minimal media were obtained. Commercial chenodeoxycholic acid (Sigma) was employed for the preparation of holo-cl-BABP with a ligand to protein ratio 5:1, as described previously (8Tochtrop G.P. DeKoster G.T. Covey D.F. Cistola D.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 11024-11029Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).NMR Experiments—NMR data were recorded on Bruker Avance 500, 600, and 700 MHz spectrometers equipped with pulse field gradient triple-resonance probes. 0.5 mm protein samples in phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 and 5.6 and 298 K were employed for structure determination and relaxation measurements.Two-dimensional homonuclear TOCSY (mixing 70 ms) and NOESY (mixing 150 ms) were performed at 500 and 700 MHz on cl-BABP sample at pH 7.0, 298 K. Water suppression was achieved using the excitation sculpting sequence (12Prost E. Sizun P. Piotto M. Nuzillard J.M. J. Magn.

NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3500) Google Scholar) for NOESY. Two-dimensional homonuclear TOCSY and NOESY were also performed at 298 K and pH 5.6, i.e. in the same conditions as those reported previously for the purified protein (2Vasile F. Ragona L. Catalano M. Zetta L. Perduca M. Monaco H. Molinari H. J. Biomol. NMR. 2003; 25: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).

For the sample dissolved in D2O HACACO, (H)CCH-COSY, (H)CCH-TOCSY, H(C)CH-COSY, and H(C)CH-TOCSY experiments were performed (17Powers R. Clore G.M. Bax A. Garrett D.S. Stahl S.J. Wingfield P.T.

Two NOESY-type three-dimensional experiments (mixing 100 ms) were acquired, one optimized for aliphatic and one for aromatic residues.A series of two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC experiments was performed for the apoprotein at different pH values (in the range 4.2-7.4) to allow for measurement of the midpoint of the chemical shift pH-driven titration. Spectra were assigned on the basis of the assignments obtained at pH 7.0 and 5.6.The 15N chemical shift titration data were fitted to Equation 1 to evaluate pKa values (18Hass M.A. Thuesen M.H.

Eleven delays (2.5, 20, 60, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, 600, 800, and 1000 ms) were used for T1 measurements, and nine delays (16.96, 33.92, 50.80, 67.84, 101.76, 135.68, 169.6, 220.48, and 237.44 ms) were used for T2 measurements. The delay in the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill pulse train was set to 0.45 ms. 1H-15N NOE experiments were acquired with an overall recycling delay of 6 s (20Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (1998) Google Scholar). To analyze the exchange contribution to relaxation at pH 7, T1, T2, and 1H-15N NOEs were also measured at 500 MHz, in the same conditions as described for higher field measurements.Relaxation measurements were identically performed at pH 7.0 for holo-cl-BABP complexed with chenodeoxycholate. Data were processed with XWINNMR and NMRPipe (21Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11379) Google Scholar) and analyzed with NMR-View 5.0.3 software package (22Johnson B.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 313-352PubMed Google Scholar).Structure Calculation of Apo-cl-BABP—Volume integration performed on was the three-dimensional 15N-13C NOESY and 1H-15N HSQC-NOESY spectra using NMRView (22Johnson B.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 313-352PubMed Google Scholar). Peak volume calibration was performed using the median method and a routine of NMRView program, and the obtained list of distances was used as input for DYANA (23Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar) calculations. φ angle restraints were derived from JHN,HA coupling constants estimated from three-dimensional HNHA experiments (15Kuboniwa H. Grzesiek S. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). φ angle restraints of 139 ± 30 ° for Jhn,ha coupling constants greater than 8.0 Hz and 60 ± 30 ° for Jhn,ha coupling constants smaller than 5.0 Hz were used as restraints.Amide proton exchange rates were estimated from a series of 1H-15N HSQC spectra performed at different times after dissolving the protein in D2O (data not shown). The partners for all hydrogen bonds were assigned on the basis of preliminary structures obtained by imposing only NOE restraints. Each hydrogen bond was introduced as a restraint on O-N distance of 3.00 Å and HN-O distance of 2.00 Å. The decision was taken to introduce in the calculation only totally unambiguous restraints, i.e. those correlations that were not affected by overlap in any spectra.The restraints were re-examined to check for consistent violations. One hundred calculations were run employing DYANA (23Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar), and the 20 conformers with the lowest residual target function were analyzed. The 20 final DYANA structures were further refined using the AMBER force field, as implemented in the program DISCOVER (Molecular Simulations, San Diego). A dielectric constant of 4 × r was used, and a scaling factor of 10 was used for out-of-plane interactions. Each structure was minimized performing 100 steps of steepest descent and 300 steps of conjugate gradient. The 10 structures with the lowest potential energy were selected for further analysis. The structures were deposited in the PDB with code 1zry.Relaxation Data Analysis—Relaxation times were calculated via least squares fitting of peak intensities, using the rate analysis routine of NMRView program (22Johnson B.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 313-352PubMed Google Scholar). The heteronuclear NOE effects were calculated from the ratio of cross-peak intensities in spectra collected with and without amide proton saturation. The principal components of cl-BABP inertia tensor were calculated using Pdbinertia (A. G. Palmer III, Columbia University). The principal moments of inertia of apo-cl-BABP at pH 7 were calculated on the basis of our NMR structure (PDB code 1zry), whereas at pH 5.6 the representative coordinates from MD simulations were used (see below). For holoprotein, the x-ray structure (PDB code 1tw4) was employed. Isotropic and anisotropic models were tested for apo- and holo-cl-BABP.An initial estimate of the overall correlation time and of principal components and orientation of the diffusion tensor can be reliably determined from the angular dependence of the relaxation rates of a subset of NH vectors assumed to have a negligible component of internal motion and/or exchange contribution to 15N relaxation. The selection of the subset of residues was made following the procedures described in the literature (24Pawley N.H. Wang C. Koide S. Nicholson L.K. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 149-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar): residues with NOE <0.65 were removed from the data set, and residues with low T2 values (T2 ≤ 〈T2 〉 - σT2) were removed from data set unless their corresponding T1 values were high (T1 ≥ 〈T1 〉+ σT1), indicating that they could be affected by anisotropic tumbling.For the axially symmetric model D∥ and D⊥, θ and φ initial estimates were evaluated using the Quadric Diffusion program (A. G. Palmer III, Columbia University) that uses the quadratic representation approach (25Bruschweiler R. Liao X. Wright P.E. Science. 1995; 268: 886-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Relaxation of amide 15N nuclear spins were analyzed using the standard equations assuming, for a diamagnetic protein, dipolar coupling with directly attached protons and a contribution from the 15N chemical shift anisotropy (26Abragam A. Marshall W.C. Wilkinson D.H. Principles of Nuclear Magnetism. Clarendon Press, Oxford, UK1961: 315-316Google Scholar) evaluated as Δσ = -170 ppm. The experimental data were fitted to the LipariSzabo model (27Lipari G. Szabo A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6250-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) using the program MODELFREE (version 4.0). The extended Lipari-Szabo formalism proposes five spectral density functions that depend upon S2 (the generalized motional order parameter), τm (the overall correlation time of rotational diffusion), τe (the effective correlation time), and Rex (the rate of conformational exchange). The five models of motion were iteratively tested in order of increasing complexity, and the model that best fitted the data were selected as described elsewhere (28Mandel A.M. Akke M. Palmer A.G. II I J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 144-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). After model selection, the overall rotational diffusion model parameters and the internal motional parameters for each spin were optimized simultaneously.At pH 7, the exchange contributions were extracted from the relaxation data at three frequencies using the approach described in Ref. 29Phan I.Q.H. Boyd J. Campbell I.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar. The parameter R2 - (R1/2) can be expressed as shown in Equation 2, R2-R12≈c123J(0)+AB02+d123J(0)(Eq. 2) in the assumption of an exponentially decaying autocorrelation function, where c1 = (8π/15)1/2γN Δσ, A=Rex/B02, and d1=-(6π/5)1/2(μ0/4π)γNγHℏrNH-3. Using a plot of R2 - (R1/2) versus B02, the spectral density function J(0) can be calculated from the intercept, I0=(d12/3)J(0), and the exchange constant A can be deduced from the slope, m=(J(0)c12/3)+A, of the line. In principle, any spin for which the data has a slope m>c12I0/d12 will have an exchange contribution. However, taking in consideration experimental and fitting errors, a threshold of 1.3 × 〈m 〉 was used to determine residues subject to exchange (29Phan I.Q.H. Boyd J. Campbell I.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), where 〈m 〉 is the average slope.Theoretical pKa Calculations—All pKa calculations have been performed as described previously (30Antosiewicz J. McCammon J.A. Gilson M.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 415-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar, 31Fogolari F. Esposito G. Viglino P. Molinari H. J. Comput. Chem. 2001; 22: 1830-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The linear Poisson-Boltzmann equation was solved for different charge states, and the electrostatic free energy was used to estimate pKa shifts. The mid-point of the titration for each site is taken as its pKa value. All Poisson-Boltzmann calculations have been performed using the program UHBD (32Wade R.C. Luty B.A. Demchuk E. Madura J.D. Davis M.E. Briggs J.M. McCammon J.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).Molecular Dynamics Simulations—Molecular dynamics simulations were performed using the program GROMACS (version 3.2.1) employing the GROMACS force field (ffgmx2) (33van Aalten D.M. Findlay J.B. Amadei A. Berendsen H.J. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The protocol used was essentially as described previously for β-lactoglobulin (34Fogolari F. Moroni E. Wojciechowski M. Baginski M. Ragona L. Molinari H. Proteins. 2005; 59: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The structure of the bile acid-binding protein was taken from PDB code 1zry, model 1. Protons were added using the program pdb2gmx, in the GRO-MACS suite of programs, for optimization of the hydrogen bond network. The protein was first minimized by 200 steepest descent minimization steps, followed by 200 conjugate gradients steps. Because of lack of solvent in this step, the dielectric constant used was 10. The Poisson Boltzmann equation was used to compute the electrostatic potential around the molecule. The lowest potential region at 0.7 nm from any protein atom was chosen for placing a counterion. The procedure was repeated on the protein and ion(s) until the net charge of the system was 0. The minimized protein and ions were then solvated in a box of SPC water with boundaries at least 1.6 nm away from any protein or ion atom. After addition of solvent molecules and ions to the system, long range electrostatic interactions were treated by particle mesh Ewald method with the following parameters: distance for non-bond interaction cutoff 12 Å and spacing for the fast Fourier transform grid 1.2 Å.The solutes were fixed, and water was energy-minimized by 100 steepest descent minimization steps. A short molecular dynamics run (50 ps) keeping the solutes fixed was performed to let the water soak the system. During this run the time step was set to 1 fs. Finally, the unrestrained system was energy minimized by 200 steepest descent steps and equilibrated in the NTP ensemble for 100 ps.In all molecular dynamics simulations the system was in equilibrium with a temperature bath at 300 K, with relaxation time constant of 0.1 ps. The system compressibility was that of water, 4.5 × 10-5 bar-1. The relaxation time for pressure equilibration was 0.5 ps. The initial velocities were set to 0. Two 3.6-ns MD simulations were performed for the low pH form (with the two histidines protonated) and the neutral pH form (with both histidines deprotonated) of cl-BABP. In both cases 100 ps of equilibration time were employed.The r.m.s.d. from starting structure could be fitted by an exponential with a time constant of 150 ps for both simulated forms, although for the protonated form a much slower, very small but detectable, increase in r.m.s.d. was observed throughout the run. The backbone r.m.s.d. from native, including protein ends and loops, is fluctuating around 2.2 Å after few hundred ps. To make sure that the system was equilibrated (at least in this time range), we repeated all analyses of local fluctuations for the same trajectories truncated at 1.8 ns. No significant difference was found.Snapshots were taken at 100-ps intervals along the simulations, and these 37 snapshots were used for structural analysis. The snapshot exhibiting the smaller average r.m.s.d. with respect to all other snapshots has been taken as the most representative structure in the ensemble.All structural analysis have been performed using the program Mol-Mol (36Musafia B. Buchner V. Arad D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and the analysis programs of GROMACS. Pairwise superposition has been performed using the program ProFit (A. C. R. Martin; www.bioinf.org.uk/software/profit/).RESULTSApo-cl-BABP NMR Assignment and Structure Calculation—Recombinant cl-BABP has been characterized by 1H, 13C, and 15N NMR. The choice of working at pH 7.0 was dictated by the need to perform structural and dynamic comparisons with the protein in its holo-form at neutral pH. Backbone assignment, performed by a combination of classical three-dimensional NMR experiments, was not straightforward especially for the C-terminal region of the protein corresponding to strands F-I. In this region, breaks in the process of assignment were caused by missing correlations due either to fast exchange of amide protons with solvent and/or to conformational exchange (see below). It was therefore necessary to combine the standard three-dimensional backbone assignment strategy with the sequential assignment strategy. Three-dimensional 1H-15N TOCSY/NOESY, performed at pH 5.6, guided the assignment of those amide resonances in fast exchange with solvent at pH 7.0. In this way the assignment was possible for all but six residues, namely Met73, Val90, Ser93, Lys95,Glu99, and Gln100, located in a region of the protein mostly affected by conformational exchange, as revealed by 15 N relaxation analysis (see below). The 1H, 13C, and 15N assignments of apo-cl-BABP have been deposited in the BioMagResBank (entry code 6642).Three-dimensional 1H-15N TOCSY/NOESY spectra obtained at pH 5.6 revealed the presence of double peaks for several residues, and unambiguous assignment was possible for Ser3 (A strand), Gly44 (BC loop), Phe47 (C strand), Asp74 (EF loop), Ala85 (FG loop), Leu89 (G strand), and Gly 104(HI loop). The small difference in chemical shift of major and minor peaks of ∼20-120 Hz indicated a time scale of exchange of the order of 0.001-0.01 s. These double peaks provide an indication of slow exchange processes affecting the protein backbone.Only totally unambiguous restraints, i.e. those correlations that were not affected by overlap in any spectra, were used for structural calculation. In this way a set of 1000 nonredundant NOEs was supplemented as follows: (i) by 26 distance restraints for 13 backbone hydrogen bonds defined on the basis of deuterium hydrogen exchange studies (data not shown), and (ii) by 48 φ angle constraints derived from Jhn-ha coupling constants. It should be stressed that this protein is highly flexible, as revealed both by H/D exchange and relaxation measurements, and several residues did not exhibit long range NOE correlatio"
https://openalex.org/W2018594211,"Mutations in p53 occur at a rate of approximately 70% in hormone-refractory prostate cancer (CaP), suggesting that p53 mutations facilitate the progression of CaP to androgen-independent (AI) growth. We have previously reported that transfection of p53 gain of function mutant alleles into LNCaP, an androgen-sensitive cell line, allows for AI growth of LNCaP in vitro. We herein confirm the in vivo relevance of those findings by demonstrating that the R273H p53 mutation (p53R273H) facilitates AI growth in castrated nude mice. In addition, we demonstrate that H2 relaxin is responsible for facilitating p53R273H-mediated AI CaP. H2 relaxin is overexpressed in the LNCaP-R273H subline. Downregulation of H2 relaxin expression results in significant inhibition of AI growth, whereas addition of recombinant human H2 relaxin to parental LNCaP promotes AI growth. Inhibition of AI growth was also achieved by blocking expression of LGR7, the cognate receptor of H2 relaxin. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis was used to demonstrate that p53R273H binds directly to the relaxin promoter, further confirming a role for H2 relaxin signaling in p53R273H-mediated AI CaP. Lastly, we used a reporter gene assay to demonstrate that H2 relaxin can induce the expression of prostate-specific antigen via an androgen receptor-mediated pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1998070942,"Deregulation of the Rb/E2F pathway in human fibroblasts results in an E2F1-mediated apoptosis dependent on Atm, Nbs1, Chk2 and p53. Here, we show that E2F1 expression results in MRN foci formation, which is independent of the Nbs1 interacting region and the DNA-binding domain of E2F1. E2F1-induced MRN foci are similar to irradiation-induced foci (IRIF) that result from double-strand DNA breaks because they correlate with 53BP1 and gammaH2AX foci, do not form in NBS cells, do form in AT cells and do not correlate with cell cycle entry. In fact, we find that in human fibroblasts deregulated E2F1 causes a G1 arrest, blocking serum-induced cell cycle progression, in part through an Nbs1/53BP1/p53/p21(WAF1/CIP1) checkpoint pathway. This checkpoint protects against apoptosis because depletion of 53BP1 or p21(WAF1/CIP1) increases both the rate and extent of apoptosis. Nbs1 and p53 contribute to both checkpoint and apoptosis pathways. These results suggest that E2F1-induced foci generate a cell cycle checkpoint that, with sustained E2F1 activity, eventually yields to apoptosis. Uncontrolled proliferation due to Rb/E2F deregulation as well as inactivation of both checkpoint and apoptosis programs would then be required for transformation of normal cells to tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2051736585,"The plasma protein histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRGP), which has been identified as an angiogenesis inhibitor, binds to heparan sulfate (HS) in a Zn2+-dependent manner. We wished to test whether this interaction is mechanistically important in mediation of the anti-angiogenic effect of HRGP. Inhibition of angiogenesis by HRGP is exerted through its central His/Pro-rich domain, which is proteolytically released. A 35-amino-acid residue synthetic peptide, HRGP330, derived from the His/Pro-rich domain retains the inhibitory effect on blood vessel formation in vitro and in vivo, an effect dependent on the presence of Zn2+. We now show that HRGP330 binds heparin/HS with the same capacity as full-length HRGP, and the binding is Zn2+-dependent. Peptides derived from the His/Pro-rich domain of HRGP downstream of HRGP330 fail to inhibit endothelial cell migration and display a significantly reduced heparin-binding capacity. An even shorter peptide, HRGP335, covering a 26-amino-acid sequence within HRGP330 retains full heparin/HS-binding capacity. Characterization of the HS interaction shows that there is a tissue-specific HS pattern recognized by HRGP335 and that the minimal length of heparin/HS required for binding to HRGP335 is an 8-mer oligosaccharide.

Angiogenesis, the formation of new capillary blood vessels, is essential during development and physiological conditions, such as wound healing and the menstrual cycle (1Risau W. Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4867) Google Scholar). However, prolonged and excessive angiogenesis has been implicated in a number of pathological processes, for instance rheumatoid arthritis, diabetic retinopathy, and tumor growth (2Folkman J. Nat.

The adult vasculature is tightly regulated by naturally occurring pro- and anti-angiogenic factors. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 3The abbreviations used are: FGF, fibroblast growth factor; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; TIME, telomerase-immortalized endothelial cells; GlcUA, glucuronic acid; HRGP, histidine-rich glycoprotein; HS, heparan sulfate; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; aa, amino acid(s); NS, N-sulfated; BT, biotinylated; cpm, counts/minute. and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are well known stimulators of endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo. To date, a number of endogenous factors negatively regulating angiogenesis have also been identified (4Folkman J. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Immunol. Scand. 2004; 112: 496-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The inhibitors described so far mainly fall into three groups: plasma proteins, basement membrane proteins, and serine protease inhibitors (serpins). A common feature of many of these anti-angiogenic molecules is inhibition of endothelial cell chemotaxis in vitro. We have identified histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRGP) as a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis in vivo (5Olsson A.K. Larsson H. Dixelius J. Johansson I. Lee C. Oellig C. Björk I. Claesson-Welsh L. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). HRGP is a heparin-binding plasma protein highly conserved through vertebrate species (for review, see Ref. 6Jones A.L. Hulett M.D. Parish C.R. Immunol. Cell Biol. 2005; 83: 106-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The N-terminal part of the protein contains two cysteine protease inhibitor (cystatin)-like stretches, hence the classification of HRGP as a member of the cystatin superfamily (Fig. 1A). The central domain is rich in histidine and proline residues, and the human form contains 12 more or less conserved tandem repeats of the pentapeptide HHPHG. Multiple binding partners for HRGP have been reported, such as heparin/heparan sulfate (HS), plasminogen, fibrinogen, tropomyosin, and divalent cations (6Jones A.L. Hulett M.D. Parish C.R. Immunol. Cell Biol. 2005; 83: 106-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The heparin-binding affinity of HRGP can be modulated and is increased in the presence of Zn2+ and at low pH (7Borza D.B. Morgan W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5493-5499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), a common environment in hypoxic tumors. The anti-angiogenic effect of HRGP is mediated via its His/Pro-rich domain, which needs to be released from the full-length protein to exert its effects (5Olsson A.K. Larsson H. Dixelius J. Johansson I. Lee C. Oellig C. Björk I. Claesson-Welsh L. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). HRGP attenuates endothelial cell migration and adhesion to vitronectin in vitro and tumor vascularization and growth in vivo, by interfering with endothelial cell focal adhesion function. We have narrowed down the minimal active domain of HRGP to a 35-amino-acid (aa) peptide, HRGP330, corresponding to a sequence in the His/Pro-rich domain of HRGP (8Dixelius J. Olsson A.K. Thulin Å. Lee C. Johansson I. Claesson-Welsh L. Cancer Res. 2005; 6: 2089-2097Google Scholar).

These modifications occur in clusters defined by the pattern of N-sulfation and give rise to different domains in HS: the poorly modified N-acetylated domains, the more extensively modified N-sulfated (NS) domains, and the N-acetylated/NS domains with alternating N-acetylated and NS disaccharides (20Maccarana M.

In the present study, we have characterized the heparin/HS-binding properties of HRGP330 and the role of this interaction for its inhibitory effect on endothelial cells. Cell Culture—Primary bovine adrenal cortex capillary endothelial cells, a kind gift from Dr. R. Christofferson, Department of Medical Cell Biology, Uppsala University, were cultured on gelatin-coated dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% newborn calf serum and 2 ng/ml FGF-2 (Peprotech). Telomerase-immortalized endothelial (TIME) cells derived from human dermal microvascular endothelial cells were a kind gift from Dr. Martin McMahon, Cancer Research Institute, University of California-San Francisco (24Venetsanakos E. Mirza A. Fanton C. Romanov S.R. Tlsty T. McMahon M. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 273: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). TIME cells were cultured in complete endothelial cell basal medium MV2 (Promocell) without antibiotics on gelatin-coated cell culture plastic. Human embryonic kidney 293-Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% fetal calf serum. Approximately every second month the cells were given 0.25 mg/ml G418 (Calbiochem) to ensure selection of EBNA-1 expression. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and serum were from Invitrogen. Recombinant Protein Production—Full-length human HRGP and the truncation HRGP1-240 (previously referred to as His-2 (5Olsson A.K. Larsson H. Dixelius J. Johansson I. Lee C. Oellig C. Björk I. Claesson-Welsh L. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar)) were produced in human embryonic kidney 293-EBNA cells under serum-free conditions as previously described (5Olsson A.K. Larsson H. Dixelius J. Johansson I. Lee C. Oellig C. Björk I. Claesson-Welsh L. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins contain a His tag (His6) in the N terminus of the coding region, and purification was performed using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). Protein-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4) pH 7.4. Synthetic Peptides—HRGP-derived synthetic peptides HRGP330 (corresponding to aa residues 330-365 in the intact protein), -365 (aa residues 365-397), -398 (aa residues 398-439), and biotinylated HRGP330 (BT-HRGP330) were purchased from Innovagen AB, Lund, Sweden, and HRGP335 (aa residues 335-360) from NeoMPS, San Diego, CA. The peptides were analyzed by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectral analysis. The peptides have the following sequences: HRGP330, DLHPHKHHSHEQHPHGHHPHAHHPHEHDTHRQHPH-COOH; HRGP365, GHHPHGHHPHGHHPHGHHPHGHHPHCHDFQDYG-COOH; HRGP398, PCDPPPHNQGHCCHGHGPPPGHLRRRGPGKGPRPFHCRQIGS-COOH; HRGP335, KHHSHEQHPHGHHPHAHHPHEHDTHG-COOH. The peptides were dissolved in H2O and diluted into Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (final concentration 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) containing 15 μm ZnCl2 or other divalent cations, as indicated. Isolation and Radiolabeling of Saccharides—HS was prepared from porcine tissues by a procedure involving defatting, proteolytic cleavage, and cetylpyridinium chloride precipitation, essentially as described earlier (25Linker A. Hovingh P. Carbohydr. Res. 1973; 29: 41-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). HS from pig intestinal mucosa was a kind gift by G. van Dedem (Diosynth, Oss, The Netherlands). Heparin from bovine lung was purified as described previously (26Lindahl U. Cifonelli J.A. Lindahl B. Rodén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 2817-2820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heparin and HS (200 μg) were radiolabeled by partial N-deacetylation for 15 min at 96 °C in hydrazine monohydrate (Fluka, Switzerland) containing 1% hydrazine sulfate (27Guo Y. Conrad H.E. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), followed by N-re[3H]acetylation of N-unsubstituted GlcNH2 with [3H]acetic anhydride (500 mCi/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) to a specific activity of ∼2.3 - 5.4 × 104 cpm/μg polysaccharide (28Höök M. Riesenfeld J. Lindahl U. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 236-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). HS was quantified by colorimetric determination of hexuronic acid using the metahydroxydiphenyl method (29Blumenkrantz N. Asboe-Hansen G. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 54: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (6019) Google Scholar) with GlcUA as a standard. GlcUA values were arbitrarily multiplied by 3 to convert values to saccharide mass. HS N-sulfated domains were prepared by essentially complete N-deacetylation of HS in hydrazine monohydrate containing 1% hydrazine sulfate for 4 h at 96°C (27Guo Y. Conrad H.E. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) followed by cleavage with HNO2 at pH 3.9 (30Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar), as described earlier (31Kreuger J. Prydz K. Pettersson R.F. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A radioactive label was introduced at the reducing end of the cleavage products by reduction with NaB3H4 (55-65 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), yielding a labeled 2,5-anhydromannitol (aManR) residue (32Pejler G. Bäckström G. Lindahl U. Paulsson M. Dziadek M. Fujiwara S. Timpl R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5036-5043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Remaining anhydromannose residues were reduced with an excess of NaBH4. Unincorporated radioactivity was separated from the labeled material by desalting on a column (1.5 × 7 cm) containing 10 ml of Sephadex G-10 (General Electric Health Care, Uppsala, Sweden). Subsequent size fractionation was performed on a Bio-Gel P-10 (fine, Bio-Rad) column (1 × 200 cm) in 0.5 m NH4HCO3 at a flow rate of 2 ml/h. Fractions corresponding to the different oligosaccharide sizes were pooled and repeatedly evaporated to dryness until neutral in pH. The specific activity for HS oligosaccharides ranged from ∼7.5 × 105 - 5.9 × 106 cpm/nmol oligosaccharide. Heparin oligosaccharides were generated by partial deaminative cleavage of the polysaccharide with nitrous acid at pH 1.5, as described previously (47Spillmann D. Witt D. Linda U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15487-15493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The products were radiolabeled by reduction with NaB3H4 to a specific activity of ∼7.4 × 104 cpm/nmol oligosaccharide. Protein/Oligosaccharide-binding Assays—Binding between radiolabeled polysaccharides/oligosaccharides and peptides was performed in solution as described previously (33Kreuger J. Lindahl U. Jemth P. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 363: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In a typical assay, 3H-labeled heparin, HS, or size-defined oligosaccharides were incubated with 320 pmol of peptide in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 140 mm NaCl, and 15 μm ZnCl2. Controls were performed with carrier bovine serum albumin and radiolabeled oligosaccharides only. After 20 min, the incubation mixtures were filtered through nitrocellulose filters (25 mm diameter, 0.45 μm pore size; Sartorius, Germany) that were then rapidly rinsed. Protein-bound oligosaccharides were released from the filter by 2 m NaCl, and the radioactivity was measured with a Beckman LS 6500 liquid scintillation counter. For determination of affinity constants, 25 pmol of protein/peptide was used, and the ligand (heparin 12-mer) varied between 1.6 and 34 pmol and 3.5 and 65 pmol for measurement with HRGP and HRGP335, respectively. KD values were calculated by nonlinear regression for one binding site using the Kaleidagraph software package using the equation y = [HRGP·heparin]max × [heparin]free/(KD + [heparin]free). Chemotaxis Assay—The chemotaxis assay was performed using a modified Boyden chamber as described earlier (34Auerbach R. Auerbach W. Polakowski I. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 51: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) with 8-μm micropore polycarbonate filters (PFB8-50; Neuro Probe Inc.) coated with type-1 collagen solution at 100 μg/ml (Vitrogen 100; Collagen Corp.). TIME cells that had been starved overnight in 1% fetal calf serum were trypsinized and resuspended at 4 × 105 cells/ml in endothelial cell basal medium, 0.25% bovine serum albumin, and trasylol at 1000 kallikrein-inhibiting units. The cell suspension was added in the upper chamber and VEGF-A (10 ng/ml) (Peprotech) in the lower chamber. HRGP335 was added both in the upper and in the lower chamber at 100 ng/ml. Zn2+ was included or not in the assay medium as 10 μm ZnCl2. After 5 h at 37 °C, cells that had migrated through the filter were stained with Giemsa and counted using the Easy Image Analysis software (Tekno Optik, Sweden). All samples were analyzed in at least six wells for each treatment and at several separate occasions. Statistical significance was calculated using Student's t test. Paxillin Staining—Bovine adrenal cortex capillary endothelial cells were seeded onto gelatin-coated glass culture slides (Falcon) and starved overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/1% newborn calf serum. The cells were stimulated for 15 min with 100 ng/ml HRGP330 that had been pre-incubated or not with a 50× molar excess of a >14-mer heparin fragment. Control cells received vehicle or vehicle plus heparin. The slides were put on ice, washed in ice-cold TBS (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), and fixed in zinc-fix (0.05% calcium-acetate, 0.5% zinc-acetate, 0.5% ZnCl in TBS, pH 6.6, and 0.2% Triton X-100) for 15 min at room temperature. Paxillin was detected using a monoclonal anti-paxillin antibody (#610052; BD Biosciences) diluted 1:400 and a secondary anti-mouse Alexa 488-conjugated antibody (#A-11017; Molecular Probes) diluted 1:1000. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (1 μg/ml; Molecular Probes). The preparations were examined and microphotographed using the 60× objective in a Nikon Eclipse E1000 microscope. Quantification of the number of focal adhesions in the cell body and cell edge in HRGP330-treated cells and cells treated with HRGP330 pre-incubated with heparin was performed by counting the number of focal adhesions in a square of defined size in three randomly chosen areas in eight separate photos from each treatment. Statistical significance was calculated using Student's t test. Binding of Biotinylated HRGP330 to Endothelial Cells—TIME cells were seeded at confluency (20,000 cells/well) in vitronectin-coated 96-well plates. Next day, the cells were put in serum-free medium (endothelial cell basal medium) for five h in 37 °C to remove potentially cell-bound bovine HRGP derived from fetal calf serum in the cell culture medium. The cells were incubated in triplicate for 45 min on ice with 100 ng/ml BT-HRGP330 alone or in combination with a 10-fold molar excess of unlabeled HRGP330, HRGP398, or HRGP. One set of cells was incubated with BT-HRGP330 that had been pre-incubated with a molar excess of heparin. Another set of cells was pre-incubated with a mixture of 10 milliunits each of the heparin lyases heparinase (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan) and heparitinase (Seikagaku) in a final volume of 200 μlof buffer (final concentration 50 units/ml) for 1.5 h before incubation with BT-HRGP330. After the incubation, the cells were washed once in cold TBS and then incubated with streptavidin-conjugated Alexa 680 (Invitrogen catalog number A-21057) at a dilution of 1:1000 for 45 min on ice. After three washes in TBS, the infrared signal from Alexa 680 was detected using the Odyssey Imaging system (Westburg BV). Determination of the Heparin-binding Region in HRGP and Correlation to Anti-angiogenesis—We have previously demonstrated that the anti-angiogenic effect of HRGP is mediated via the His/Pro-rich domain, which can be proteolytically released from HRGP (5Olsson A.K. Larsson H. Dixelius J. Johansson I. Lee C. Oellig C. Björk I. Claesson-Welsh L. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). HRGP binds to heparin in a Zn2+-dependent manner (7Borza D.B. Morgan W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5493-5499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 35Kluszynski B.A. Kim C. Faulk W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13541-13547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To investigate the contribution of the His/Pro-rich region to this interaction, we determined the heparin-binding properties of full-length HRGP and a truncated form corresponding to the N-terminal cystatin domains (HRGP1-240), i.e. lacking the His/Pro-rich domain (Fig. 1A). Using a nitrocellulose filter trapping assay (33Kreuger J. Lindahl U. Jemth P. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 363: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we studied the binding of [3H]acetyl-labeled heparin to HRGP and HRGP1-240 in a Zn2+-containing buffer (Fig. 1B). In the presence of 15 μm Zn2+, HRGP1-240 showed a 9-fold lower heparin binding compared with intact HRGP. This finding indicated that, despite the ability of the N-terminal to bind heparin, the main heparin-binding domain is located outside of this region. In a parallel study, we investigated the anti-angiogenic properties of three synthetic peptides, HRGP330, -365, and -398, derived sequentially from the His/Pro-rich domain of HRGP. Of these three peptides, only HRGP330 was found to retain the anti-angiogenic properties, an effect dependent on the presence of Zn2+ (8Dixelius J. Olsson A.K. Thulin Å. Lee C. Johansson I. Claesson-Welsh L. Cancer Res. 2005; 6: 2089-2097Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The heparin-binding capacity of HRGP330 was comparable with that of intact HRGP, whereas HRGP365 and -398 showed considerably lower binding (Fig. 1B). To further narrow down the heparin-binding domain, a 26-amino-acid peptide within HRGP330, HRGP335, was tested in the filter trapping assay. HRGP335 was able to bind heparin to a similar extent as intact HRGP. Shorter peptides were not retained by the nitrocellulose filter and could therefore not be evaluated in this assay. Moreover, the apparent dissociation constant (KD) of the interaction between HRGP335 and heparin ranged in the same order as for full-length HRGP (10 nm for HRGP and 52 nm for HRGP335; Fig. 1, C and D, respectively). HRGP335 was tested for its ability to inhibit endothelial cell chemotaxis. TIME cells were induced to migrate toward VEGF-A in a modified Boyden chamber in the absence or presence of HRGP335 and Zn2+, respectively (Fig. 1E). The VEGF-A-induced chemotactic response was inhibited by HRGP335, an effect dependent on the presence of Zn2+. These data further support a relation between the anti-angiogenic effect and the heparin-binding capacity of HRGP-derived fragments. Influence of Divalent Cations on the Heparin-binding Ability of HRGP335—Zn2+ is a known ligand for HRGP, and its importance for the binding of HRGP to heparin (7Borza D.B. Morgan W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5493-5499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 35Kluszynski B.A. Kim C. Faulk W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13541-13547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and cell surface HS (36Jones A.L. Hulett M.D. Parish C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38267-38276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) has previously been demonstrated. To investigate whether Zn2+ could be substituted with other divalent cations, [3H]acetyl-labeled heparin was incubated with HRGP335 in the presence of different concentrations of Zn2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Sr2+, and Hg2+. At 20 μm Zn2+, maximal binding of the peptide to heparin was observed (Fig. 2). However, already at 10-15 μm Zn2+, which represents the physiological level, a substantial amount of heparin bound to HRGP335. In contrast, Ni2+, Co2+, and Cu2+ were able to mediate binding between heparin and HRGP335 only at concentrations far above physiologically relevant levels. Other divalent cations, such as Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Sr2+, and Hg2+, were not able to mediate binding between HRGP335 and heparin, even at concentrations as high as 1.5 mm for Mn2+, Sr2+, and Hg2+ or 5 mm for Ca2+ and Mg2+ (data not shown). Taken together these results confirm the importance of Zn2+ for heparin binding to the His/Pro-rich domain of HRGP under physiological conditions. Determination of the Heparin Fragment Size Required for HRGP335 Binding—To elaborate the molecular details of HRGP335 binding to heparin, size-defined [3H]heparin oligosaccharides were tested for their ability to interact with HRGP335. The peptide was incubated with equimolar amounts of 3H-labeled oligosaccharides, and those bound to the peptide were trapped along with the peptide on a nitrocellulose filter (Fig. 3). Oligosaccharides showed increased binding capacity with increasing size, reaching a plateau at the size of a dodecasaccharide. A fraction of hexasaccharides was retained on the filter by HRGP335, although ∼8-fold less than the fraction of dodecasaccharides bound. Octasaccharides showed a 2-fold lower binding than dodecasaccharides, whereas decasaccharides reached almost the level of dodecasaccharides. Tissue-specific Binding of HRGP335 to HS Chains and NS Domains— Because HS (and not heparin) is present on the surface of endothelial cells, we assayed equimolar amounts of HS from different porcine tissues for binding to HRGP335. HS from aorta and intestine showed a 3-6-fold lower binding capacity than HS from lung, liver, kidney, and heart (Fig. 4A). Of all tested HS preparations, liver HS showed the highest affinity for HRGP335. To further investigate the tissue preference seen with full-length HS, we tested the ability of the highly sulfated NS domains from these different HS sources for their binding to HRGP335. NS domains were prepared from the HS of porcine liver and intestine by N-deacetylation and depolymerization by complete deaminative cleavage at pH 3.9 and were then radiolabeled and size-fractionated. NS domains from both tissues were able to bind to HRGP335, although in a different fashion (Fig. 4B). NS octasaccharides from liver showed similar binding properties as heparin fragments, with an increasing proportion of the longer fragments bound. In contrast to oligosaccharides from liver, 8-mer NS domains from intestinal HS showed essentially no binding, whereas deca- and dodecasaccharides contained structural features sufficient for binding. HRGP330-induced Rearrangement of Endothelial Cell Focal Adhesions Requires Interaction with Cell Surface HS—To test whether the anti-angiogenic effect of HRGP330 was dependent on its interaction with HS on the endothelial cell surface, we pre-incubated HRGP330 with a molar excess of heparin. Preincubation with heparin should thus prevent the peptide from interacting with cell surface HS. Evaluation of the effect of HRGP330 pre-incubated with heparin on endothelial cell chemotaxis"

Here we report a new function of human TRAF6, the direct stimulation of apoptosis. The mechanism of apoptosis induction results from the capacity of human TRAF6 to interact and activate caspase 8. Both the C-terminal TRAF domain of human TRAF6, which directly interacts with the death effector domain of pro-caspase 8, and the N-terminal RING domain, which is required for activation of caspase 8, are necessary for the induction of apoptosis. The role of endogenous TRAF6 in regulating apoptosis was confirmed by extinguishing TRAF6 expression with specific small-hairpin RNA that resulted in diminished spontaneous apoptosis and resistance to induced apoptosis. In contrast to the human molecule, murine TRAF6 displayed less ability to induce apoptosis and a greater capacity to stimulate NF-κB activity. Human and murine TRAF6 are similar except in the region between zinc finger 5 and the TRAF domains. Reciprocal transfer of this connecting region completely exchanged the ability of human and murine TRAF6 to induce apoptosis and activate NF-κB. Unique regions of TRAF6 therefore play an important role in determining cell fate.

Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) 2The abbreviations used are: TRAF, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TNF-R, TNF receptor; IL, interleukin; h, human; m, murine; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; Z-, benzyloxycarbonyl-; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; shRNA, small-hairpin RNA; TLR, Toll-like receptor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RFP, red fluorescent protein; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; STS, staurosporine; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; FLICA, fluorochrome-labeled inhibitor of caspase; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; DED, death-effector-domain; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. were first identified as intracellular proteins that were associated with TNF-R2, a member of the TNF receptor (TNF-R) superfamily (1Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immun. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref Scopus (2470) Google Scholar, 2Wu H. Arron J.R. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 1096-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). There are currently known to be six mammalian TRAF family members (TRAF1-6) that play essential roles in signal transduction by TNF-R family members as well as some members of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family and the IL-1R. In addition, a distantly related protein, TRAF7, was recently described that was able to activate AP1 activity and induce apoptosis (3Xu L.G. Li L.Y. Shu H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17278-17282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Therefore, TRAFs play important roles in a variety of essential aspects of host defense. TRAF family members (except TRAF1 and -7) all contain a C-terminal receptor-binding TRAF domain, which is composed of a coiled-coil domain, TRAF-N, and a highly conserved TRAF-C domain. Additionally, all TRAFs except TRAF1 have an N-terminal RING domain followed by one (TRAF7) or more (TRAF1-6) zinc fingers. TRAFs function as adaptor proteins, linking membrane receptors to downstream signaling events. TRAFs are able to interact with a series of kinases, such as TAK1 and MEKK2, which leads to activation of the transcription factors NF-κB and AP1, respectively. The N-terminal RING domain is essential for the activation of downstream signaling cascades, and deletion of this domain causes TRAFs to become inhibitors of receptor signaling (4Zapata J.M. Reed J.C. Sci. STKE 2002. 2002; : PE27Google Scholar, 5Bradley J.R. Pober J.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6482-6491Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 6Kobayashi N. Kadono Y. Naito A. Matsumoto K. Yamamoto T. Tanaka S. Inoue J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1271-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Human (h)TRAF6 was initially identified by a screen for TRAF2-like sequences and subsequently cloned from a cDNA library (7Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). Murine (m)TRAF6 was discovered simultaneously by its capacity to bind CD40 via its TRAF domain (8Ishida T. Mizushima S. Azuma S. Kobayashi N. Tojo T. Suzuki K. Aizawa S. Watanabe T. Mosialos G. Kieff E. Yamamoto T. Inoue J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28745-28748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Murine and human TRAF6 are largely homologous in amino acid sequence except in the connecting region between zinc finger 5 and the TRAF domain, where there are significant differences. mTRAF6 has eight additional amino acids in this region with two additional cysteines and three positively charged arginine residues. This protein sequence divergence suggests the possibility that hTRAF6 and mTRAF6 might have important differences in structural conformation that could cause them to exert contrasting functional activities. Despite these significant changes in protein sequences, no studies have examined differences in the function of human and murine TRAF6 and the potential impact of divergent protein sequence in this connecting region segment of the molecule on functional capabilities. TRAF6 is a unique member of the TRAF family. Unlike other TRAFs, which largely mediate signaling from the TNF-R superfamily, TRAF6 also participates in the signaling pathway from the IL-1LR/TLR superfamily (7Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar, 9Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M.

The spectrum of biological functions of TRAF6 reflects its capacity to interact with a broader array of upstream receptors because of its unique TRAF-C motif. Although TRAF1, TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF5 display similar receptor-binding specificities, TRAF6 recognizes a completely different binding site (Pro-X-Glu-X-X-(aromatic/acidic residue)) in CD40 and RANK, members of the TNF-R superfamily (12Jabara H.

More importantly, sequence inspection has revealed that signaling proteins IRAK (16Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X.

Recently, mTRAF6 has been shown to participate in the assembly of a large NF-κB signaling complex containing ubiquitin ligases, and the kinases TAK1 and TABs (18Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar, 19Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). The RING domain of mTRAF6 is required for NF-κB signaling, likely by acting as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, adding ubiquitin to substrates, one of which is mTRAF6 itself. However, whether hTRAF6 functions in a similar manner remains unclear because of the limited apparent stability of hTRAF6. The difficulty in detecting stable hTRAF6 and the presence of a RING domain with homology to the mTRAF6 RING domain suggested that hTRAF6 might be degraded by a pathway involving ubiquitylation initiated by the putative E3 ligase activity of hTRAF6. The current experiments examined this possibility. Not only was evidence found that hTRAF6 is degraded by a pathway initiated by its own E3 ligase activity and in a RING domain- and caspase-dependent manner, but also a novel role of hTRAF6 in induction of apoptosis was found. Apoptosis induction depends on an interaction of the TRAF domain of hTRAF6 and the DED domain of pro-caspase 8, followed by activation of caspase 8 by a RING domain-dependent mechanism. Importantly, the connecting region between the fifth zinc finger and the TRAF domain governed the magnitude of TRAF6 degradation as well as its ability to activate NF-κB or induce apoptosis. These results indicate a novel and complex role of TRAF6 in cell fate decisions that differs significantly between human and mouse.

Grammer A.C. Wu X. Lipsky P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55855-55865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). pDsRFP-TRAF6 and His-TRAF6 were generated similarly. The YFP-hTRAF6 RING (YFP-TRAF6R) and YFP-hTRAF6TRAF (YFP-TRAF6TD) constructs were generated by standard cloning techniques (see supplemental Table 1 for primers). All other hTRAF6 deletion YFP chimeric protein constructs were generated by ligation of appropriate sites in order to delete the designated fragment from a parental YFP-hTRAF6 plasmid. The YFP-and His-hTRAF6C70A constructs were generated by using a standard mutagenesis kit provided by Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Murine TRAF6 plasmid was described previously (19Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar), and its YFP fusion construct was generated by standard cloning techniques with pEYFP-C1 vector and PCR technique. The hTRAF6 shRNA constructs against three different regions, from nucleotide 131 to 152, 550 to 571, or 572 to 593, which were predicted by the Imgenex web-based shRNA designer program, were generated in the IMG-800 vector (Imgenex, San Diego, CA) using the annealed oligonucleotides shown in supplemental Table 1. The C-terminal-tagged pro-caspase 8-GFP and its inactive mutant (C360S) caspase 8m-GFP plasmids were described previously (34Siegel R.M. Martin D.A. Zheng L. Ng S.Y. Bertin J. Cohen J. Lenardo M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). To generate an N-terminal CFP-tagged inactive pro-caspase 8 construct (CFP-caspase 8c360s), a PCR technique was used with the vector caspase 8m-GFP as a template and the paired primers shown in supplemental Table 1. The caspase 8 deletion constructs were generated similarly. In order to generate an artificial chimera encoding the RING finger of human TRAF6 and the zinc fingers and the TRAF domain of human TRAF2, the fragments encoding the zinc fingers and TRAF domain of human TRAF2 (amino acids 124-498) were amplified using the primers shown in supplemental Table 1. The FRET-based caspase activity indicator CFP-LEVD-YFP was described previously (20He L. Olson D.P. Wu X. Karpova T.S. McNally J.G. Lipsky P.E. Cytometry. 2003; 55: 71-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Other FRET-based caspase indicators CFP-DEVD-YFP (caspase 3), CFP-IETD-YFP (caspase 8), and CFP-LEHD-YFP (caspase 9) were generated using standard cloning techniques with pECFP-C1 and PCR using the primers shown in the supplemental Table 1. The plasmid for hTRAF6 with a murine connecting region between the zinc fingers and TRAF domain, designated as hTRAF6-m20, was generated by an insertion of PCR fragments using mTRAF6 as a template and the primers shown in supplemental Table 1. Similarly, the plasmid containing mTRAF6 and a human connecting region between zinc fingers and TRAF, designated as mTRAF6-h12, was generated with standard PCR techniques. All plasmids were confirmed with DNA sequence analysis. Cell Culture, Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—Cell cultures of HeLa cells and 293 cells, immunoprecipitation using GFP mAb and the subsequent GFP, ubiquitin, and TRAF6 immunoblotting were performed as described (35Schleicher U. Rollinghoff M. Gessner A. J. Immunol. Methods. 2000; 246: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Similar conditions were used to incubate A20 mouse lymphoma cells. Immunoblotting methods using antibodies against PARP and actin were described previously (20He L. Olson D.P. Wu X. Karpova T.S. McNally J.G. Lipsky P.E. Cytometry. 2003; 55: 71-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Chemical Treatment and TRAF6 shRNA Assay—HeLa cells co-transfected with distinct hTRAF6 shRNA vectors or transfected with control IMG 805 vectors alone were selected using the antibiotic G418 at a concentration of 50 μg/ml for 2 days and then treated with 12.5 or 50 μm MG132 (proteasome inhibitor) for an additional 3 h. These treated cells were loaded with the caspase fluorogenic substrate D2R to detect caspase activity following the procedure provided by Pharmingen or directly lysed in RIPA buffer and assessed by TRAF6 Western blotting. Immuofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—HeLa cells grown in exponential phase on glass coverslips in 6-well plates were transfected with YFP chimeric constructs as described above. At 2 and 16 h post-transfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at least for 20 min, washed three times in PBS, then stained with DAPI at a concentration of 5 mg/ml for 20 min, and mounted with anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes). These fixed and DAPI-stained cells mounted on the slides were then photographed for YFP images and nuclear DAPI images that would identify apoptosis-related nuclear fragmentation. When used for immunostaining, cells fixed at 2 h after transfection were blocked with 5% fetal calf serum at room temperature for 1 h, then incubated with 1:200 diluted primary antibody for 1 h (mAb against caspase 2 and polyclonal antibodies against caspase 3 or 8), washed twice in PBS, and finally incubated with 1:500 diluted mouse or rabbit IgG-specific antibodies conjugated with rhodamine for an additional 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times, cells were finally mounted onto microscope slides. YFP images and red rhodamine fluorescence images were taken using confocal microscopy excited with 488 and 543 nm argon-ion laser lines, respectively. The Measurement of Caspase Activity by Caspase-sensitive FRET Probes, Fluorogenic Fluorescence Substrate D2R, and FLICA Using Flow Cytometry—A caspase 6, 8, and 4-sensitive FRET probe CFP-LEVD-YFP was described previously (23He L.

The expression of this intact fusion protein results in intense FRET signals, whereas its cleavage at the LEVD linker or other caspase target linkers leads to a significant loss of the FRET signal. The flow cytometric optical configuration with the FACS DiVa (BD Biosciences) for measuring CFP, YFP, and FRET signals and the method for analyzing FRET-related caspase activity were described previously (23He L.

Similarly, this method was also used to measure caspase 3-, 8-, and 9-related activity in viable cells by using CFP-DEVD-YFP, CFP-IETD-YFP, and CFP-LEHD-YFP probes, respectively. Briefly, HeLa cells were cotransfected with the CFP-LEVD-YFP probe or other caspase-sensitive indicators and RFP-hTRAF6, RFP-hTRAF6c70a, His-hTRAF6, or His-hTRAF6c70a. After overnight culture, transfected cells were analyzed for CFP, YFP, FRET, and RFP signals by flow cytometry. Cells gated for CFP, YFP, and RFP signals in a plot of RFP versus YFP were analyzed for the percentage of FRET-diminished cells to all transfected cells in a plot of CFP versus FRET. An increase of percentage of cells with diminished FRET indicates caspase activation. When caspase activity was measured by using the fluorogenic caspase substrate D2R (36Hug H. Los M. Hirt W. Debatin K.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13906-13911Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), which will emit green fluorescence upon caspase activation, the green signals were collected in FL1 on the FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). When caspase activity of caspase 3 was measured by using FLICA-DEVDase and flow cytometry, a method described previously was employed (23He L. Wu X. Meylan F. Olson D.P. Simone J. Hewgill D. Siegel R.M. Lipsky P.E. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 164: 1901-1913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). FRET Measurement by a λ-Mode Using Confocal Microscopy—A previously described confocal microscopic λ-mode FRET technique was used to document direct protein-protein interaction (37van Rheenen J. Langeslag M. Jalink K. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 2517-2529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 38Xu Q. Brecht W.J. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Huang Y. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e61Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 405-nm line emitted from a violet laser was used to excite only CFP molecules in CFP·YFP complexes, and then the emission spectrum was documented continuously in a 12-nm interval from 440 to 600 nm. CFP → YFP FRET will result in the occurrence of a peak at 524 nm. To compare the FRET signal throughout all samples quantitatively, a ratio of emissions at 524 nm (FRET) to 470 nm (CFP) was calculated with sufficient sample size to achieve statistical significance. Immunofluorescence, Annexin V Staining, and Flow Cytometry—The method for TRAF6 immunostaining for flow cytometric analysis was adapted from one used for heat shock protein immunostaining, which was described previously (40He L. Fox M.H. Radiat. Res. 1999; 151: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly HeLa cells in suspension were fixed in 70% ice-cold methanol for at least 20 min and then exposed to three cycles of pelleting/washing, blocked for nonspecific binding using 5% bovine serum albumin, and then sequentially incubated with a mAb against hTRAF6 (Active Motif, Canada) for 1 h at 37°C and with a mouse IgG-specific antibody conjugated with FITC for an additional hour at 37 °C. Finally the hTRAF6-stained cells were analyzed in FL1 with the FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). The FITC-conjugated annexin V binding assay was carried out to distinguish apoptotic cells using the protocol provided by Pharmingen. The cells with positive and negative annexin V-FITC staining were measured using a FACSVantage DiVa (BD Biosciences) and then sorted for analysis by TRAF6 immunoblotting. Similarly APC-conjugated annexin V binding assay was carried out in cells transfected with YFP-hTRAF6, YFP-mTRAF6, or YFP alone. The percentage of YFP/APC double-positive cells was measured using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). The RING Domain Mediates hTRAF6 Degradation—To visualize the cellular distribution of hTRAF6 and facilitate its detection by Western blotting, a construct was prepared in which full-length hTRAF6 was fused to YFP and then was transfected into HeLa cells. GFP and TRAF6 Western blots were initially carried out to validate the expression of the fusion proteins. It was notable that hTRAF6 was modified within 2 h after transfection and completely degraded after overnight culture (Fig. 1A). It has been reported that the RING domain of mTRAF6 is required for its E3 ligase activity that can catalyze the addition of ubiquitin molecules to a variety of proteins, including TRAF6 itself (18Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). The rapid degradation of hTRAF6 suggested that the RING domain of hTRAF6 might initiate this ubiquitin-mediated autodegradation. To test this possibility, a mutant hTRAF6 with a RING domain mutation (Cys → Ala at amino acid 70, C70A) was prepared. As anticipated, this RING domain mutation prevented modification and degradation of hTRAF6 (Fig. 1B). Stabilization did not depend on the YFP tag as it was also observed with His-tagged proteins in both HeLa and 293 cells (Fig. 1C). Notably, endogenous hTRAF6 was also stabilized by addition of proteasome inhibitors, MG132 (Fig. 1D, left) or lactacystin (Fig. 1D, right). Notably, in HeLa cells TRAF6 is maintained as a distinct band with the molecular mass of unmodified TRAF6, whereas in Jurkat cells, it is maintained as a family of higher molecular weight, presumably modified proteins. Importantly, hTRAF6 was clearly shown to be ubiquitylated by immunoprecipitating expressed YFP-hTRAF6 with antibody to GFP followed by ubiquitin immunoblotting (Fig. 1E). These results strongly indicate that endogenous hTRAF6 is degraded through a RING domain-mediated ubiquitylation pathway. To determine the portions of the hTRAF6 molecule involved in degradation, a series of deletion constructs was prepared (Fig. 1F). Although the intact RING domain was necessary for modification, the RING domain itself was not modified. At a minimum, the RING domain and the zinc fingers were required for modification and preferably a portion of the TRAF domain as well. Finally, this modification was not observed when other TRAFs (TRAF1-3 and -5) were expressed as YFP or CFP fusion proteins in HeLa cells (see Ref. 20He L. Olson D.P. Wu X. Karpova T.S. McNally J.G. Lipsky P.E. Cytometry. 2003; 55: 71-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar and data not shown). Both hTRAF6 RING and TRAF Domains Are Required for Programmed Cell Death—The cellular fate of YFP-hTRAF6 was examined by confocal microscopy (Fig. 2). It was notable that hTRAF6-transfected HeLa cells or 293 cells (data not shown) quickly loosened from the culture dish, rounded up, and finally progressed to apoptosis that was visualized by DNA fragmentation after nuclear staining with DAPI and staining with annexin V, as well as by the induction of PARP cleavage detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 2). Analysis of the activity of a family of hTRAF6 deletion mutants indicated that an intact RING domain as well as the five zinc fingers and parts of the TRAF domain were minimally required for induction of apoptosis assessed either by annexin V binding or PARP cleavage (Fig. 2C). To delineate the activity of hTRAF6 in greater detail, series of chimeric proteins were constructed (Fig. 3A). Expression of the constructs was analyzed by GFP immunoblotting in HeLa cells either 2 or 16 h after transfection (Fig. 3A). The induction of apoptosis in cells expressing the indicated constructs was assessed by annexin V binding and PARP cleavage (Fig. 3B). Human TRAF6, but not human TRAF2, induced apoptosis, although hTRAF2 and hTRAF6 share a structurally similar RING domain (data not shown). Moreover, when the RING domain of hTRAF6 was incorporated into hTRAF2, no modification of the chi-meric protein and no induction of apoptosis were noted. These results confirm that aspects of the hTRAF6 protein other than the required RING domain are necessary for the induction of apoptosis. Human TRAF6 induced apoptosis and also was rapidly degraded. Both effects apparently required the E3 ligase activity of the RING domain. To examine this in greater detail, apoptosis of Jurkat cells was induced by anti-Fas antibody or the chemical inducer of apoptosis, staurosporine (STS). In both circumstances, increased degradation of TRAF6 was induced (Fig. 3C). Notably, however, increased degradation of TRAF6 by anti-Fas or STS was not affected by the C70A RING domain mutation. Thus, the E3 ligase activity of the RING domain of hTRAF6 is required to induce apoptosis but not to target TRAF6 for degradation. hTRAF6 Induces Apoptosis via a Caspase-dependent Pathway—Apoptosis can be mediated through a caspase-dependent pathway and a mitochondria-dependent pathway (21Chinnaiyan A.M. Dixit V.M. Semin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 22Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10964-10967Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). To examine the mechanism of apoptosis induced by hTRAF6, experiments were carried out with a pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD. Addition of Z-VAD largely suppressed the programmed cell death induced by hTRAF6 (Fig. 4A). This protection from apoptosis by Z-VAD was also demonstrated by a decrease of PARP cleavage (data not shown). Notably, further degradation of ubiquitylated hTRAF6 molecules required the activity of functional caspases, as this was inhibited by Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 4B). To confirm hTRAF6-induced caspase activation, a FRET probe, consisting of CFP and YFP separated by a caspase cleavage site (CFP-LEVD-YFP) that has been demonstrated to be cleaved directly by caspases 6, 8, and 4 (23He L.

https://openalex.org/W2153350681,"In multiple myeloma (MM), neoplastic plasma cells accumulate in the bone marrow where their survival, proliferation, and apoptosis are controlled at multiple levels by interaction with the bone marrow microenvironment. Myeloma cells actively control these interactions by activating stromal and endothelial cells for production of survival factors, such as interleukin-6, and suppressing other cell types such as erythroblasts, normal B cell progenitors, and T-cells. In the present study, we identified primary osteoblasts as additional potential targets for myeloma cell-mediated suppression which was partly dependent on the death receptor ligand TRAIL. Besides killing of osteoblasts, myeloma cell lines sensitized osteoblasts to cell death mediated by recombinant TRAIL, whereas primary osteoblasts protected myeloma cells from TRAIL-mediated apoptosis that was mediated by osteoprotegerin (OPG). Besides increase of osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast activity, suppression of bone-forming cells by myeloma cells might contribute to bone loss in MM patients. In addition, clinical development of recombinant TRAIL as anti-myeloma therapy should include evaluation of potential side effects on viability of normal bone cells."
https://openalex.org/W2037330557,"p73β is a structural and functional homologue of p53, a tumor suppressor gene. In this study, we identified a novel p73β-binding protein, p19ras, by the yeast two-hybrid screening method. Alternative splicing of the proto-oncogene H-ras pre-mRNA has led to two distinct transcripts, p19ras and p21ras. In both endogenous and overexpressed systems, we confirmed that p19ras binds to full-length p73β in vivo and in vitro. Coexpression of p19ras with p73β stimulated the transcriptional activity of p73β. Ras proteins are known to be small membrane-localized guanine nucleotide-binding proteins. However, unlike other Ras proteins, p19ras is localized in the nucleus and the cytosol and its interaction with p73β occurred exclusively in the nucleus. Oncogenic MDM2 (mouse double minutes 2) is a known repressor of p73 transcriptional activity. In this study, when p19ras was bound to MDM2, it further inhibited the association of MDM2 to the p73β protein. In addition, p19ras abolished MDM2-mediated transcriptional repression of p73β. Therefore, this study presents a novel pathway of Ras signaling that occurs in the nucleus, involving p19ras and p73β.

Furthermore, the expression level of p73 is not affected by exposure to DNA-damaging agents that increase p53 levels, indicating that the two proteins have distinct cellular functions (8Vikhanskaya F. Marchini S. Marabese M. Galliera E. Broggini M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 935-938PubMed Google Scholar). MDM2 (mouse double minutes 2) is an oncoprotein that is overexpressed in many human cancers (9Jones S.N. Hancock A.R. Vogel H. Donehower L.A. Bradley A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15608-15612Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). It is well established that MDM2 inactivates p53 activity through monomeric ubiquitination of lysine residues of p53 (10Kawai H. Wiederschain D. Yuan Z.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 4939-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 11Li M. Brooks C.L. Wu-Baer F. Chen D. Baer R. Gu W.

In contrast, although p73 binds to MDM2 as well, their interaction does not lead to the proteosomal degradation of p73 (13Balint E. Bates S. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3923-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the binding of p73 to MDM2 results in a dramatic inhibition of p73 transactivating activity (14Maisse C. Guerrieri P. Melino G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 1555-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the binding to a cofactor, p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP), 3The abbreviations used are: CBP, CREB-binding protein (where CREB is cAMP-responsive element-binding protein); GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DTT, dithiothreitol; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; TAD, transactivation domain; DBD, DNA-binding domain; OD, oligomerization domain. 3The abbreviations used are: CBP, CREB-binding protein (where CREB is cAMP-responsive element-binding protein); GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DTT, dithiothreitol; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; TAD, transactivation domain; DBD, DNA-binding domain; OD, oligomerization domain. is required for the transcriptional activity of p73 and that MDM2 competes with p73 for the p300/CBP (15Zeng X. Chen L. Jost C.A. Maya R. Keller D. Wang X. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Oren M. Chen J. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3257-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In a previous report, we demonstrated that Amphiphysin IIb-1 sequesters nascent p73 proteins in the cytoplasm and thus inhibits its transcriptional activity (16Kim K.C. Kim T.S. Kang K.H. Choi K.H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6689-6699Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Using the yeast two-hybrid screening method, we identified a novel p73β-binding protein, p19ras, which is an alternative splicing variant of c-H-ras (17Cohen J.B. Broz S.D. Levinson A.D. Cell. 1989; 58: 461-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Proto-oncogenic Ras family proteins are GTPases that alternatively bind to GDP or GTP and elicit diverse cellular responses, including cell proliferation, differentiation, growth, arrest, and/or apoptosis (18Chen C.Y. Faller D.V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1487-1498PubMed Google Scholar, 19Downward J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 20Macaluso M. Russo G. Cinti C.

Biosci. 1998; 3: 887-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The classical Ras proteins include three members, N-Ras, H-Ras, and K-Ras, and their pre-mRNAs are regulated by alternative splicing. K-Ras4A and K-Ras4B, which were produced by alternative splicing in the last exon of the k-ras gene, displayed differential localization (22Reuther G.W. Der C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 23Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2057) Google Scholar). Likewise, alternative splicing of H-ras precursor mRNA led to the formation of two transcripts, p19ras and p21ras. The differences in their mRNA are that p19mRNA contains exon IDX (intron D exon) and lacks exon E4A, due to an in-frame stop codon (17Cohen J.B. Broz S.D. Levinson A.D. Cell. 1989; 58: 461-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 24Guil S. Gattoni R. Carrascal M. Abián J. Stévenin J. Bach-Elias M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2927-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Recently, stable and abundant expressions of p19ras have been elucidated, but the functional significance of this protein has not been well-studied (25Guil S. de La Iglesia N. Fernandez-Larrea J. Cifuentes D. Ferrer J.C. Guinovart J.J. Bach-Elias M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5178-5187PubMed Google Scholar). In contrary to oncogenic p21ras, p19ras lacks transforming potential. For effective Ras signaling, p21ras protein must undergo post-translational modifications that facilitate its attachment to the plasma membrane (22Reuther G.W. Der C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 23Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2057) Google Scholar). However, p19ras does not have a Ras C-terminal conserved domain that targets the plasma membrane and is shown to be localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus (25Guil S. de La Iglesia N. Fernandez-Larrea J. Cifuentes D. Ferrer J.C. Guinovart J.J. Bach-Elias M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5178-5187PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, p19ras has little GTP binding activity and is devoid of two important GTP-binding sites located in exon E4A of the p21ras (25Guil S. de La Iglesia N. Fernandez-Larrea J. Cifuentes D. Ferrer J.C. Guinovart J.J. Bach-Elias M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5178-5187PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, these findings suggest the presence of fundamental differences in the function and regulation between H-ras splicing variants. In this study, we describe p19ras as a specific binding protein of p73, in which a direct interaction is important for controlling the transcriptional activity of p73. Furthermore, we demonstrate that p19ras activates p73 by alleviating MDM2-mediated p73 inhibition when p19ras directly binds to MDM2 and disrupts the association of MDM2 to p73. Therefore, we present p19ras as a new member of a growing family that interacts with the MDM2 protein to regulate p73 activity. Bait Construction—Full-length p73β was cloned into the pLexA yeast expression vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), digested with EcoRI, and then ligated. The resulting plasmid containing the C-terminal region of p73β was denoted pLexA-73C (248–499 amino acids) and used as bait for the library screening. To confirm bait expression in the yeast system, yeast proteins were prepared by the Horvath and Riezman method, and the lysate was Western blotted using LexA antibodies (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—EGY48 yeast cells were grown in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone, 1% glucose) or synthetic dropout medium lacking the appropriate supplements to maintain selections. Yeast transformation was performed with the lithium acetate method. For the transformation of the bait plasmid, several colonies of EGY48 (p8op-LacZ) on the synthetic dropout/Glu/-Ura plate were cultured in YPD medium. Competent cells were transformed with 1 μg of pLexA-73C and 100 μg of salmon sperm DNA. The human brain library in pB42AD (Clontech) was sequentially transformed into the yeast (p8op-lacZ + pLexA-73C). Approximately 2 × 106 transformants were screened for positive colonies growing on synthetic dropout/Gal/Raf/-Ura/-His/-Trp/-Leu containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (200 μg/ml). To further confirm the presence of interacting proteins, positive transformants were examined for the expression of the lacZ reporter gene by using a filter assay or a whole plate assay. Yeast plasmid DNA was extracted using glass beads and pB42AD-positive plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli XL1-Blue (Clontech). Plasmids were isolated and sequenced, and their interactions with p73β were confirmed after the transformation of the plasmids by using a whole plate assay. In Vitro Binding Assay—A pB42AD yeast-inducible vector fragment was cut and ligated into EcoRI- and XhoI-digested pGEX4T1 prokaryotic expression vectors (Amersham Biosciences). The fusion protein was expressed in BL21 and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Promega, Madison, WI). In vitro translated full-length p73β (Promega) was incubated with the GST fusion proteins coupled to the glutathione-Sepharose bead. After 3 h of incubation at 4 °C, the mixtures were washed three times in PBS containing 1 mm DTT (dithiothreitol). The beads were boiled in 5× Laemmli buffer, proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis), and gels were exposed to x-ray film after drying. Antibody Production—The polyclonal antibody against the p19ras protein was raised from rabbits using the peptide CSRSGSSSSSGTLWDPPG. The sequences were from 152–170 amino acids of the human p19ras with an additional cysteine at the N-terminal end to allow coupling to the keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Preimmune sera from the same rabbits were obtained before immunization. The sera were tested by Western blot analyses from the 293 human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells expressing either the recombinant GFP-p19ras or GFP-p21ras proteins as antigens. The specificity of the purified antibody was further analyzed by a peptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analysis. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 and HeLa cells were obtained from ATCC (American type culture collection) (Manassas, VA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and penicillin-streptomycin (50 units/ml). H1299 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfection was performed by Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) with different plasmid DNA according to manufacturer's instructions. In Vivo Binding Assay—The 293 cells were seeded in 100-mm plates at an initial density of 2 × 106 cells and allowed to grow for 24 h. The cells were transfected with the respective plasmids, further incubated for 42 h, and lysed by sonication. For the confirmation of endogenous interaction of p19ras with p73, 293 cells were treated with 2 m doxorubicin for 24 h to stimulate p73 expression. For immunoprecipitation assays, cell lysates were incubated with an appropriate antibody (0.8 μg) in PBS for 3 h at 4 °C. Following the addition of protein A/G-agarose beads, the reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were washed three times in PBS containing 1 mm DTT, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Samples were analyzed by Western blotting, using the appropriate antibodies to detect protein expressions. The polyclonal antibody against the p73 protein generated from GST-p73β was previously raised in the rabbit (26Kang K.H. Lee J.H. Kim K.C. Ham S.W. Kim M.Y. Choi K.H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 522: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The monoclonal GFP and FLAG antibodies were purchased from Roche Applied Science and Sigma, respectively. The polyclonal HA, MDM2, p21ras, α-tubulin, and retinoblastoma (Rb) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Luciferase Assay—The 293 cells were cultured in 60-mm dishes and transfected with the firefly luciferase p21 reporter gene (500 ng) and pCMVβ (500 ng) (Promega), together with 500 ng of pcDNA-HA73β, pcDNA3-MDM2, and/or pEGFP-p19ras by using the appropriate luminometer tubes. After 38 h of transfection, cells were lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Cell extracts were analyzed with the luciferase reporter assay system using a Lumat LB 9501 Berthold Luminometer. Luciferase activities of the p21-luciferase vector were normalized based on β-galactosidase activity of the cotransfected vector. Immunofluorescence Staining—COS-7 cells were grown on a sterile coverslip in 60-mm dishes and transfected with indicated expression vectors using Lipofectamine. Two days after transfection, cells were fixed with 80% acetone and incubated with mouse anti-FLAG IgG antibody (1:500) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were simultaneously incubated with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) for 30 min. Plates were washed three times in PBS and the fluorescence was photographed using a Nikon microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Preparation of Subcellular Fractions—HeLa cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, harvested by centrifugation, and lysed in Buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 15 min. For cell lysis, 10% of Nonidet P-40 was added and vortexed for 10 s. After centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 30 s, the supernatant (cytosolic extracts) was transferred to a new tube. The pellet was added to ice-cold Buffer C (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.4 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), incubated for 15 min at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant (nuclear extracts) was transferred to new tubes and kept frozen at -70 °C until use. RNA Interference; siRNA of p19ras—PCR primers (5′-ACCAAGTCTTTTGAGGACATCCAC-3′ and 5′-TCACATGGGTCCCGGGGGGTCCCA-3′) were designed to amplify a 256-bp fragment from the 3′ end of the p19ras gene. The PCR products were two separate clones containing the same target region, but in different orientations. The resulting plasmid templates were used in the silencer siRNA mixture kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) to prepare siRNA mixtures according to the manufacturer's protocol. The templates were used in an in vitro transcription reaction to generate double-stranded RNA. After a brief purification step, 15 μg of the resulting double-stranded RNA was digested with Dicer (Ambion) at 37 °C for 16 h. The digestion products were then purified with the siRNA purification units (Ambion) to remove any un-digested double-stranded RNA. The resulting siRNA population was quantitated using a spectrophotometer and visualized on a 20% non-denaturing acrylamide gel. 293 cells were transfected with the p19ras siRNA using Lipofectamin 2000 (Invitrogen). p73 siRNA was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and the siRNA were transfected to HEK293 or SK-OV-3 using transfection reagent provided by the same manufacturer or Lipofectamin 2000 (Invitrogen), respectively, according to provided protocols. Identification of p19ras as a p73-interacting Protein—To identify p73-interacting proteins, we screened a human brain cDNA library with the C-terminal (amino acids 248–499) region of p73 (p73C) using the yeast two-hybrid system. Screening of 2 × 106 yeast transformants led to the isolation of several positive clones. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that cDNA of one clone was identical to the p19ras identified in 2001 (GenBank™ accession number BC006499). The clone contained partial coding sequences (56–170 amino acids) of p19, as we denoted p19rasC in subsequent data. We also confirmed the interaction of p19 with the p73C in yeast by measuring β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 1A). p19ras consisted of an open reading frame of 513 bp that encoded 170 amino acids. H-ras pre-mRNA underwent alternative splicing of the last encoding exon, rendering two mRNAs, one with a stop codon on exon 4A and the other with a stop codon on exon IDX (Fig. 1B). These messages translated into p21 and p19 (H-Ras IDX) proteins, respectively (17Cohen J.B. Broz S.D. Levinson A.D. Cell. 1989; 58: 461-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence alignment of p19 H-Ras IDX with other Ras proteins (H-Ras, K-Ras, and N-Ras) are shown in Fig. 1C, and p19 only lacks the C terminus sequences of p21 ranging from amino acids 152 to 189. Physical Interaction of p73 with p19ras—To determine the interaction of p19ras to the full-length p73β, GST-fused p19rasC (56–170 amino acids) was produced and used in an in vitro binding assay with [35S]methionine-labeled full-length p73β. Consistent with the interaction in yeast, p73β was bound to GST-p19rasC, but not with GST alone (Fig. 2A). To further validate this interaction in vivo, we examined the coprecipitation of full-length HA-p73β and GFP-p19rasC from transiently transfected HEK293 cells. Cell lysates were incubated with anti-GFP antibody, followed by Western blotting with anti-HA antibody. The HA-73β protein was coimmunoprecipitated with GFP-p19rasC (Fig. 2B). Thus, these results confirmed that the full-length p73β interacts with p19rasC both in vivo and in vitro. The expression of endogenous p19ras cDNA was abundant in HeLa, HEK293, and SH-SY5Y cells (data not shown). Under the conditions that stimulate p73 expression using doxorubicin, p19ras immunoprecipitated endogenous p73 from the 293 cells, but p21ras did not (Fig. 2C). Likewise, p73 also immunoprecipitated endogenous p19ras from the 293 cells (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, the specificity of p19 binding to p73 was assessed by determining the interaction of p21rasV (Val-12), a constitutively active form of p21ras (27Wurzer G. Mosgoeller W. Chabicovsky M. Cerni C. Wesierska-Gadek J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), with p73. As shown in Fig. 2E, p21rasV did not interact with p73β under the same conditions as p19ras did. In addition, we examined the in vivo binding of p19ras to p53 family, p53, p73α, and p73β. Results demonstrated that p19ras interacts with both p53 and the p73 isoforms (Fig. 2F). Determination of the Binding Region of p19ras to p73—The next step was to determine the p73β-binding domain of p19ras. Since p19ras can be grouped into regions I, II, and III based on the alignment of other Ras proteins (H-Ras, K-Ras, and N-Ras), we constructed truncated mutants of p19ras. After transfection of the p19ras (p19rasC1, -C2, and -C) mutants and p73β into the HEK293 cells, overexpressed GFP-p19ras was immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were Western blotted using anti-HA antibody to detect p73β. As shown in Fig. 3A, neither region II (p19rasC1) nor region III (p19rasC2) bounded to p73β. Instead, the p19rasC mutant containing the amino acids 56–87 in region I interacted with p73β, suggesting that this is the binding region responsible for the interaction with p73β. Assessment of p19ras-binding Region of p73—To define the region of p73β that is required for the interaction with p19ras, we performed in vivo binding assays with p19ras and a series of truncated proteins that contained distinct domains of p73β. Although the transactivation domain (TAD)-containing region (amino acids 1–131) of p73 did not appear to interact with p19ras, the p73 DNA-binding domain (DBD)-containing region (amino acids 54–310) strongly interacted with p19ras. The p19ras oligomerization domain (OD)-containing region (amino acids 310–499) also interacted with p19ras, but the binding was weaker than with the DBD-containing region as more of GFP-tagged p19ras protein was immunoprecipitated with less amount of p73β-DBD peptide precipitated (Fig. 3B). Therefore, this showed that p19ras interacts with both the DBD and OD of p73β, but its binding is more prominent and sufficient with the DBD. Colocalization and Interaction of p19ras and p73β in the Nucleus— Since p73 predominantly locates in the nucleus, we determined whether p19ras colocalizes with p73 in cultured mammalian cells using immunocytochemistry. The p19ras protein was localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, as detected by anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 4A). Colocalization of p19ras and p73 in the same cell was assessed using double immunofluorescence. HeLa cells were transfected with GFP-p19ras and HA-73β. GFP-p19ras was immunostained with green dye, and HA-73β was visualized by red fluorescence. As shown in Fig. 4B, p19ras and p73 colocalize in the nucleus. To further confirm the colocalization and interaction of p19ras and p73 in the nucleus, H1299 cells were transfected with GFP-p19ras and HA-73β and nuclear, and cytosolic fractions were separated. The extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody and detected by Western blot analysis using the anti-HA antibody. To ensure the complete separation of subcellular fractions, marker proteins (α-tubulin and Rb) were immunoblotted. Therefore, consistent with immunocytochemistry data, p19ras specifically interacts with p73β in the nucleus (Fig. 4C). Increased Transcriptional Activation of p73 by p19ras—To examine whether p19ras could affect p73β-dependent transcriptional activation, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the p73β expression plasmid and a luciferase reporter plasmid containing the p73-responsive element from p21 promoter, together with or without the p19ras expression plasmid. As shown in Fig. 5A, p19ras alone did not induce the luciferase reporter activation and coexpression of p19ras with p73β resulted in the increase of p21-luciferase activity, which was induced by p73 in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, we measured the transcriptional activity of p73β in the presence of p19rasC1, a mutant that does not bind to p73β, to test the necessity of p19ras interaction in the functional activation of p73β. The mutant (p19rasC1) was unable to activate the transcriptional function of p73β (Fig. 5A), indicating that the additional activation of p73β required its physical association with p19ras. Transfection of p19ras siRNA into HEK293 cells effectively decreased both overexpressed GFP-p19ras and endogenous p19ras expression (Fig. 5B, top panel). The silencing of p19ras itself reduced transcriptional activity of p73β in some degrees and further prevented overexpressed p19ras-mediated additional activation of p73 transactivity (Fig. 5B, top panel). Thus, these data coherently demonstrate that p19ras is a positive regulatory protein of p73β. A Direct Interaction of p19ras to MDM2—The binding of MDM2 to p73 does not target p73 for degradation but suppresses the transcriptional function of p73 (13Balint E. Bates S. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3923-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 15Zeng X. Chen L. Jost C.A. Maya R. Keller D. Wang X. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Oren M. Chen J. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3257-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). We investigated whether the p73β activation by p19ras could be the result of inhibiting p73β-MDM2 interaction. First, we examined the amount of p73-MDM2 complexes in the presence of a p19ras in H1299 cells. Expression of p19ras remarkably inhibited the p73β-MDM2 interaction (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, coprecipitated p19ras was detected in the anti-MDM2 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6A), raising the possibility that p19ras could be associated with p73β and/or MDM2. To examine whether p19ras could interact with MDM2, we performed coprecipitation experiments using HEK293 cells transfected with MDM2 and p19ras expression plasmids. As shown in Fig. 6B, p19ras clearly immunoprecipitated with MDM2 in the absence of p73, confirming that MDM2 interacts with the p19ras protein. The interaction of p19ras with MDM2 in Fig. 6B could be mediated by endogenous p73. Thus, we silenced the expression of endogenous p73 by transfecting siRNA of p73 and performed immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293 (Fig. 6C) and p53-null SK-OV-3 cells (Fig. 6D). Regardless of the presence of p73, p19ras directly interacts with MDM2 in both cells. Under the conditions that stimulate p73 expression using doxorubicin, endogenous p19 doxorubicin was still interacted with endogenous MDM2 in the p73 siRNA-transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, we examined the interaction with MDM2 using p73 siRNA-transfected SK-OV-3 cells, which are deficient in p53. We also identified that the p19ras could be directly interacted with MDM2 in the absence of p53 protein (Fig. 6D). Therefore, we demonstrate that the p19ras is directly interacted with MDM2 in the absence of p73, p53, or both proteins. Abrogation of MDM2-mediated p73 Inhibition by p19ras—These results raise the possibility that p19ras may abrogate the inhibitory effect of MDM2 on p73β through its interaction with MDM2. To test the possibility that p19ras blocks MDM2-mediated inhibition of the transcriptional activity of p73β, we first determined the binding region of p19ras to MDM2. As shown in Fig. 6E, p19rasC1 and -C2 lost their association with MDM2 as with p73β, and an interaction was still detected by p19rasC mutant protein. Subsequently, we performed a luciferase assay with MDM2, p73, and p19ras in H1299 cells. Consistent with previous studies, MDM2 significantly reduced the level of p73β-mediated luciferase activity (Fig. 6F). Strikingly, p19ras completely abolished the transcriptional inhibition caused by MDM2 (Fig. 6F). In addition, a p19rasC1 mutant that lacks the interaction with both p73 and MDM2 (Fig. 6E) was not effective in blocking MDM2-induced transcriptional repression of p73 (Fig. 6F), suggesting that p19ras-mediated blockage of the inhibitory effect of MDM2 on p73 requires the association of p19ras to p73, MDM2, or both (Fig. 6F). Since the binding region of p19ras to p73β and MDM2 overlaps, any further conclusion requires more studies. In this study, we report that p19ras, an alternative splicing variant of H-ras, functioned as a direct interacting partner of p73β. Moreover, p19ras was also able to bind to p53 and p73α indicating that t"
https://openalex.org/W2046844405,"Purα and Purβ are structurally related single-stranded DNA/RNA-binding proteins implicated in the control of cell growth and differentiation. The goal of this study was to determine whether Purα and Purβ function in a redundant, distinct, or collaborative manner to suppress smooth muscleα-actin gene expression in cell types relevant to wound repair and vascular remodeling. RNA interference-mediated loss-of-function analyses revealed that, although Purβ was the dominant repressor, the combined action of endogenous Purα and Purβ was necessary to fully repress the full-length smooth muscle α-actin promoter in cultured fibroblasts but to a lesser extent in vascular smooth muscle cells. The activity of a minimal core enhancer containing a truncated 5′ Pur repressor binding site was unaffected by knockdown of Purα and/or Purβ in fibroblasts. Conversely, gain-of-function studies indicated that Purα or Purβ could each independently repress core smooth muscle α-actin enhancer activity albeit in a cell type-dependent fashion. Biochemical analyses indicated that purified recombinant Purα and Purβ were essentially identical in terms of their binding affinity and specificity for GGN repeat-containing strands of several cis-elements comprising the core enhancer. However, Purα and Purβ exhibited more distinctive protein interaction profiles when evaluated for binding to enhancer-associated transcription factors in extracts from fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells. These findings support the hypothesis that Purα and Purβ repress smooth muscle α-actin gene transcription by means of DNA strand-selective cis-element binding and cell type-dependent protein-protein interactions. Purα and Purβ are structurally related single-stranded DNA/RNA-binding proteins implicated in the control of cell growth and differentiation. The goal of this study was to determine whether Purα and Purβ function in a redundant, distinct, or collaborative manner to suppress smooth muscleα-actin gene expression in cell types relevant to wound repair and vascular remodeling. RNA interference-mediated loss-of-function analyses revealed that, although Purβ was the dominant repressor, the combined action of endogenous Purα and Purβ was necessary to fully repress the full-length smooth muscle α-actin promoter in cultured fibroblasts but to a lesser extent in vascular smooth muscle cells. The activity of a minimal core enhancer containing a truncated 5′ Pur repressor binding site was unaffected by knockdown of Purα and/or Purβ in fibroblasts. Conversely, gain-of-function studies indicated that Purα or Purβ could each independently repress core smooth muscle α-actin enhancer activity albeit in a cell type-dependent fashion. Biochemical analyses indicated that purified recombinant Purα and Purβ were essentially identical in terms of their binding affinity and specificity for GGN repeat-containing strands of several cis-elements comprising the core enhancer. However, Purα and Purβ exhibited more distinctive protein interaction profiles when evaluated for binding to enhancer-associated transcription factors in extracts from fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells. These findings support the hypothesis that Purα and Purβ repress smooth muscle α-actin gene transcription by means of DNA strand-selective cis-element binding and cell type-dependent protein-protein interactions.

Although the notion of phenotypic modulation of vascular cell types has existed for several decades, the molecular mechanisms leading to pathologic changes in cell migration, proliferation, or apoptosis are largely unknown. Among the well characterized markers of VSMC differentiation status, smooth muscle α-actin (SMαA) is unique in that its physiological role is not entirely restricted to regulation of vascular contractility (6Schildmeyer L.A. Braun R. Taffet G. Debiasi M. Burns A.E. Bradley A. Schwartz R.J. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2213-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Indeed, experimental evidence indicates that reduced levels of SMαA may alter the tissue-invasive and motile properties of certain fibroblastic cell types in vitro (7Leavitt J. Gunning P. Kedes L. Jariwalla R. Nature. 1985; 316: 840-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 8Ronnov-Jessen L. Petersen O.W. J.

Virmani R. Curr. Opin. Cardiol. 2001; 16: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). On the other hand, enhanced SMαA expression is crucial to myofibroblast differentiation and physiological wound repair (11Gabbiani G. J. Pathol. 2003; 200: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar, 12Desmouliere A. Chaponnier C. Gabbiani G. Wound.

Thus, identification of factors that modulate SMαA expression in myofibroblasts and VSMCs could provide useful targets for therapies designed to either stabilize, or perhaps favorably alter, the phenotypic composition of vascular lesions.Among the multitude of transcription factors implicated in SMαA gene regulation (16Kumar M.S. Owens G.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 17Yoshida T. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 280-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), a group of functionally novel single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding proteins known as Purα, Purβ, and MSY1 have been reported to restrain muscle-CAT (MCAT) enhancer-dependent SMαA gene transcription in both fibroblasts and VSMCs (18Carlini L.E. Getz M.J. Strauch A.R. Kelm Jr., R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8682-8692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These repressor proteins were originally identified based on their ability to interact with opposing strands of a highly conserved, asymmetric polypurine-polypyrimidine (Pur/Pyr) tract located in the 5′ region of the mouse SMαA gene (19Kelm Jr., R.J.

In its double-stranded configuration, the Pur/Pyr sequence contains a consensus MCAT enhancer motif, which serves as a recognition site for transcription enhancer factor 1 (TEF-1) (18Carlini L.E. Getz M.J. Strauch A.R. Kelm Jr., R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8682-8692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Importantly, computer modeling of the extended Pur/Pyr tract coupled with ssDNA-selective chemical modification of genomic DNA in cultured fibroblasts indicated that this region has the propensity to assume a partially unpaired configuration in response to transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) signaling (20Becker N.A.

These findings coupled with results of in vitro DNA binding and cell-based SMαA promoter mutagenesis studies, led to the development of two alternative models for cryptic MCAT enhancer regulation. The salient feature of both models involves ssDNA-specific interactions by endogenous Purα, Purβ, and MSY1, which either mask TEF-1 from other components of the transcription machinery or alter cis-element structure in such a way as to preclude TEF-1 binding to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) (18Carlini L.E. Getz M.J. Strauch A.R. Kelm Jr., R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8682-8692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although speculative, the latter scenario is plausible because several independent studies have demonstrated that Pur and Y-box proteins are individually capable of promoting DNA strand separation in vitro (21MacDonald G.H.

However, based on more recent work, it is now clear that Purα and Purβ have additional targets and mechanistic roles to play in suppressing smooth and cardiac muscle-specific gene transcription depending upon the cell type studied, Pur expression levels, and/or TGFβ1 signaling (25Kelm Jr., R.J.

Although a comprehensive analysis of the tissue expression of Pur paralogs at the protein level has not yet been reported, evidence from RNA transcript analysis suggests that Purα and Purβ are ubiquitously expressed while Purγ exhibits a more restricted distribution (30Liu H. Johnson E.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2417-2426Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). All Pur family members exhibit a substantial degree of homology particularly in domains that confer nucleic acid binding capacity (25Kelm Jr., R.J. Wang S.X. Polikandriotis J.A. Strauch A.R. J. Biol.

By virtue of their ability to interact with high affinity and specificity with single-stranded nucleic acid sequences rich in purine nucleotides of the form (GGN)n, Pur proteins appear to have evolved to regulate cellular processes essential to genetic metabolism, including DNA replication and transcription, RNA transport and localization, and mRNA translation (33Johnson E.M. Anticancer Res. 2003; 23: 2093-2100PubMed Google Scholar). The founding member of this family, Purα, has also been implicated in regulation of cell cycling and proliferation in vitro (34Itoh H.

Despite their structural relatedness, it is unknown at present whether Purα and Purβ are functionally redundant or distinct. Hence, the objective of this study was to perform a rigorous comparative evaluation of mouse Purα and Purβ with the use of gain-of-function and loss-of-function strategies in SMαA-expressing cell types. In combination with results of biochemical assays conducted with purified recombinant proteins, our findings provide insight into the physical and functional interactions that account for the ability of Purα and Purβ to repress SMαA gene expression in a cell-type-specific manner.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture, Transient Transfection, and Reporter Gene Assay—Aortic segments from C57BL/6J mice were obtained following protocols approved by the University of Vermont Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. VSMCs were isolated by cell outgrowth from aortic tissue explants and characterized as previously described (40Schneider D.J. Absher P.M. Ricci M.A. Circulation. 1997; 96: 2868-2876Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 41Chen Y. Kelm Jr., R.J. Budd R.C. Sobel B.E. Schneider D.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 92: 178-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Primary VSMCs were cultivated in a 90% air/10% CO2 incubator at 37 °C in growth medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 1× insulin-transferrin-selenium supplement (Invitrogen), and 20% v/v heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone). For transient transfection studies, primary VSMCs were seeded in six-well plates at a density of 10,000 cells/well and transfected with the use of jetPEI™ reagent at a ratio of 2 μl/μg of plasmid DNA as directed by the manufacturer (Qbiogene). AKR-2B mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) or rat A7r5 VSMCs were cultured and transiently transfected as previously described (42Wang S.X. Elder P.K. Zheng Y. Strauch A.R. Kelm Jr., R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6204-6214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, subconfluent AKR-2B or A7r5 cells seeded in 60-mm dishes were transfected with the use of GenePORTER™ reagent (Gene Therapy Systems) at a ratio of 3 μl/μg of plasmid DNA. After 48-h incubation in growth medium, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and extracted using 1× reporter lysis buffer (Roche Applied Science) supplemented with protease inhibitors. In some cases, transfected cells were growth-arrested by incubation in serum-free medium for 48 h then re-stimulated with either 20% FBS or 5 ng/ml TGFβ1 (R&D Systems) for 6 h prior to harvesting cell lysates. Total protein in transfected cell lysates was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (Sigma) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a protein standard. Commercial immunoassays were used to measure chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) or β-galactosidase reporter proteins as directed by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). Reporter values were corrected for total protein content. Transfections were typically performed in triplicate and repeated two to three times to ensure reproducibility. Data sets were subjected to one-way analysis of variance to identify differences among group means at the p < 0.05 significance level. Post-hoc comparisons were performed using the Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons.Construction of Promoter-Reporter Plasmids and Expression Vectors—Mouse SMαA promoter-reporters and mammalian expression plasmids encoding His-epitope-tagged versions of mouse Purα and Purβ were described previously (18Carlini L.E. Getz M.J. Strauch A.R. Kelm Jr., R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8682-8692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A methodological description of the design and construction of plasmid- and lentiviral-based short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression vectors targeting mouse Purα or Purβ can be found in the supplemental material. All plasmids used for transfection were purified from Escherichia coli cultures by double cesium chloride gradient centrifugation.Western Blotting of Transgene-expressed and Endogenous Proteins—Ectopic expression of His-tagged Purα or Purβ was monitored by Western blotting of lysed cell protein with an RGS(H)4 monoclonal antibody (Qiagen) as previously described (25Kelm Jr., R.J.

Expression of endogenous Pur proteins was similarly assessed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody that recognizes a conserved sequence present in both mouse Purα and Purβ (19Kelm Jr., R.J. Cogan J.G.

Commercial monoclonal antibodies were used for detection of SMαA (clone 1A4, Sigma) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (clone 6C5, Research Diagnostics Inc.).Purification of His-Purα and His-Purβ Expressed in E. coli—Bacterial expression constructs encoding mouse Purα and Purβ with N-terminal His epitope tag were described previously (19Kelm Jr., R.J.

Detailed methods used for the expression, purification, and quality control of His-tagged Purα and Purβ are presented in the supplement materials. His-tagged MSY1 expressed in E. coli was purified and quantified as previously described (19Kelm Jr., R.J. Cogan J.G. Elder P.K. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14238-14245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).Biochemical Assays for DNA Binding and Protein-Protein Interaction—A discontinuous solid-phase DNA binding assay was performed as previously described with some minor modifications (43Kelm Jr., R.J. Elder P.K. Getz M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38268-38275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recombinant His-Purα or His-Purβ was diluted to a final concentration of 50 nm in coating buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 μg/ml BSA. Proteins were passively adsorbed to microtiter wells (Costar® EIA/RIA plate, 96-well Easywash™ high binding) by applying 100 μl of coating solutions and incubating overnight at 4 °C for 16–24 h. Coating solution was removed by aspiration, and wells were rinsed twice with wash buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% v/v Tween 20. Blocking buffer containing 2% w/v BSA (Sigma, EIA grade) dissolved in HEPES buffer was then applied to each well. After 1-h incubation at room temperature, blocking buffer was removed and 100 μl of fluid phase competitor (Purα or Purβ or unlabeled oligonucleotide) diluted in binding buffer (0.2% w/v BSA dissolved in wash buffer) was applied in triplicate. After 10-min incubation at 37 °C, 100 μl of 2 nm 3′-biotinylated ssDNA probe diluted in binding buffer was added. Plates were incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Binding solutions were removed by aspiration, and wells were washed three times. This was followed by addition of 100 μl of ExtraAvidin-HRP (Sigma) diluted 1:2000 in wash buffer to each well and incubation for 30 min at 37 °C. Wells were washed three times, and 100 μl of ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis[3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid]) substrate solution (Chemicon) was added. After 15-min incubation at room temperature, absorbance readings at 405 nm were obtained with a microplate reader. In another set of experiments, the DNA binding assay was performed the same way as described above except that the fluid phase contained differing amounts of 3′-biotinylated single- or double-stranded probes corresponding to selected sequences found in the mouse SMαA 5′-flanking region. Biotinylated or unlabeled oligonucleotides were made by chemical synthesis and purified by reverse phase cartridge (Sigma-Genosys). dsDNA probes were generated by annealing complementary oligonucleotides in which only one of the strands was biotin-labeled. Annealed dsDNA probes were purified by electrophoresis on 4% agarose gels.An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection protein-protein interaction was performed as previously described (42Wang S.X. Elder P.K. Zheng Y. Strauch A.R. Kelm Jr., R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6204-6214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In these experiments, microtiter wells were coated with selected concentrations of His-Purα or His-Purβ. Nuclear or cytosolic extracts derived from either AKR-2B or A7r5 cells served as a source of Pur-interacting factors. Primary and secondary antibodies used for the detection of protein-protein complexes were obtained commercially (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Rabbit polyclonal MSY1 and TEF-1 antibodies were produced by this laboratory (18Carlini L.E. Getz M.J. Strauch A.R. Kelm Jr., R.J. J. Biol.

The effectiveness and specificity of shRNA-mediated knockdown of both exogenous and endogenous Purα and Purβ in fibroblasts or VSMCs was confirmed by transfection and immunoblot analyses (see supplemental data, Fig. S1). Given previous studies indicating that these proteins function as co-repressors of the SMαA promoter (18Carlini L.E. Getz M.J. Strauch A.R. Kelm Jr., R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8682-8692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that knockdown of Purα and/or Purβ in non-differentiated fibroblasts would result in promoter activation. A series of co-transfection experiments was conducted in AKR-2B MEFs with the use of a full-length SMαA promoter-CAT reporter known as VSMP8 (Fig. 1A) and selected Purα- or Purβ-specific shRNA expression plasmids. The VSMP8 promoter construct was chosen, because it contains mouse SMαA sequence (–1074 through the first intron) required for smooth muscle-specific transgene expression in vivo (45Wang J. Niu W. Nikiforov Y. Naito S. Chernausek S. Witte D. LeRoith D. Strauch A. Fagin J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1425-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and, as such, exhibits very weak transcriptional activity in transfected AKR-2B cells due, in part, to negative regulation by endogenous Pur repressor proteins. As shown in Fig. 1B, co-transfection of Purβ shRNA-I resulted in a dose-dependent increase in VSMP8 promoter activity, whereas a scrambled control construct (Purβ Scm) had no effect on this reporter. Corroborative results were obtained in lentiviral-transduced AKR-2B MEFs where stable shRNA-mediated knockdown of Purβ augmented SMαA protein expression (Figs. 1C and S1, see supplemental data).To evaluate whether the effect of Purβ knockdown was promoter context-dependent, a truncated SMαA reporter known as VSMP4 was also tested for responsiveness to Purβ deficiency. As previously documented (18Carlini L.E. Getz M.J. Strauch A.R. Kelm Jr., R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8682-8692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), this mutant reporter exhibits unrestricted MCAT enhancer activity due to the absence of 5′-nucleotides required for strand-specific Pur/Pyr element recognition by endogenous Pur repressors (see Fig. 1A for schematic). Hence it was not surprising to find that expression of Purβ shRNA-I had no discernable effect on the transcriptional activity of VSMP4 in transfected MEFs (Fig. 1D). To assess whether knockdown of Purα would yield analogous results, shRNA constructs demonstrating the maximum efficiency of Purα or Purβ knockdown (Fig. S1, Purα shRNA-I and Purβ shRNA-I) were transfected either individually or in combination into AKR-2B MEFs together with VSMP8 or VSMP4 reporters (Fig. 2A). Knockdown of Purα alone resulted in a modest ∼2-fold enhancement in VSMP8 activity, whereas knockdown of Purβ alone induced VSMP8 by ∼4-fold. Importantly, a synergistic response (∼12-fold activation over reporter only control) was observed in AKR-2B MEFs expressing both Purα and Purβ shRNAs implying that endogenous Pur repressors likely function in a collaborative manner to regulate the transcriptional activity of the full-length SMαA promoter in this cell type. Transient transfection of the same Purα or Purβ shRNA constructs in primary mouse VSMCs yielded similar results, although the extent of de-repression was less pronounced than seen in AKR-2B MEFs (Fig. 2B). Relative to VSMP8, VSMP4 exhibited little or no responsiveness to combined Purα and Purβ knockdown in both cell types. Evaluation of other SMαA reporter constructs containing differing lengths of 5′-flanking region indicated that significant promoter induction in response to co-knockdown of Purα and Purβ in AKR-2B cells minimally required 5′ sequence extending to –195 (Fig. 2A, inset, compare Δ195 to VSMP4). This result coincides with biochemical studies indicating that high affinity binding by purified Purα or Purβ to the purine-rich strand of a Pur/Pyr element is impaired by deleting the GGGA motif from –195 to –192 (Fig. 2, C and D).FIGURE 2De-repression of the SMαA promoter in MEFs and VSMCs in response to knockdown of Purα and/or Purβ and the requirement for Pur/Pyr element integrity. A and B, AKR-2B MEFs or primary C57BL/6J VSMCs were transiently transfected with 2.8 μg of VSMP8 or VSMP4 reporters, 0.2 μg of pCMVβ, and 1.0 μg of expression plasmid encoding the indicated shRNA or scrambled control sequence. pBLCAT3 was used as filler to equalize the amount of DNA transfected at 5.0 μg/dish. Whole cell extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection and assayed for total protein and CAT reporter. To compare the relative effect of shRNAs or scrambled controls on each promoter, corrected CAT values were normalized to values obtained in transfectants in which VSMP8 or VSMP4 were co-transfected with pBLCAT3 filler DNA only (control activity defined as 1 for each reporter). Results are expressed as -fold de-repression (mean ± S.E.). **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001 compared with reporter only control.

Using chromaffin and PC12 cells, we have recently described that the granule-associated GTPase ARF6 plays a crucial role in exocytosis by activating phospholipase D1 at the plasma membrane and, presumably, promoting the fusion reaction between the two membrane bilayers. ARF6 is activated by the nucleotide exchange factor ARNO following docking of granules to the plasma membrane. We show here that GIT1, a GTPase-activating protein stimulating GTP hydrolysis on ARF6, is the second molecular partner that turns over the GDP/GTP cycle of ARF6 during cell stimulation. Western blot and immunofluorescence experiments indicated that GIT1 is cytosolic in resting cells but is recruited to the plasma membrane in stimulated cells, where it co-localizes with ARF6 at the granule docking sites. Over-expression of wild-type GIT1 inhibits growth hormone secretion from PC12 cells; this inhibitory effect was not observed in cells expressing a GIT1 mutant impaired in its ARF-GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity or in cells expressing other ARF6-GAPs. Conversely reduction of GIT1 by RNA interference increased the exocytotic activity. Using a real time assay for individual chromaffin cells, we found that microinjection of GIT1 strongly reduced the number of exocytotic events. These results provide the first evidence that GIT1 plays a function in calcium-regulated exocytosis in neuroendocrine cells. We propose that GIT1 represents part of the pathway that inactivates ARF6-dependent reactions and thereby negatively regulates and/or terminates exocytotic release.

We propose that GIT1 represents part of the pathway that inactivates ARF6-dependent reactions and thereby negatively regulates and/or terminates exocytotic release. The exocytotic mechanism, which has been the topic of intense investigation for decades, has been recognized as a multi-step process. After recruitment and docking at the plasma membrane, secretory granules enter a priming period, which is ultimately followed by the fusion process. Many molecular players that orchestrate the targeting, docking, and fusion of secretory granules with the plasma membrane have been identified (1Jahn R. Lang T. Südhof T.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 519-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). Among them, SNARE (soluble NSF attachment protein receptor) proteins, present on both granule and plasma membranes, have been shown to play an important role in the last journey of secretory granules by assembling into highly stable helical bundles and bridging membranes into close proximity (2Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 3McNew J.A. Weber T. Parlati F. Johnston R.J. Melia T.J. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The membrane fusion process itself continues to be debated, although several observations support the idea that specific lipids are required to achieve opening and expansion of fusion pores. Accordingly, lipid-modifying enzymes make critical contributions for exocytosis in various secretory cell types. For instance, in neurons (4Humeau Y. Vitale N. Chasserot-Golaz S. Dupont J.-L. Du G. Frohman M.A. Bader M.F. Poulain B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15300-15305Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and in neuroendocrine cells (5Vitale N. Caumont A.S. Chasserot-Golaz S. Du G. Wu S. Sciorra V.A. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Bader M.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2424-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), we have previously shown that the plasma membrane-associated phospholipase D1 (PLD1), 3The abbreviations used are: PLD1, phospholipase D1; PA, phosphatidic acid; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PIP5K, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase type I γ; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; GH, growth hormone; ARF, ADP-ribosylation factor; GIT, G protein-coupled receptor kinase interactor; HA, hemagglutinin; shRNA, small hairpin RNA; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MT-2, metallothionein-2. by producing phosphatidic acid (PA), controls the late stages of exocytosis beyond the cytoskeleton-mediated recruitment of secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane. Also, synthesis at the plasma membrane of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) by phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase type I γ (PIP5K) has been described as essential for priming docked vesicles and rendering them fusion competent. The precise functions of these lipids in the exocytotic machinery remain, however, to be clarified. Nevertheless, the potential implication of lipid-modifying enzymes in exocytotic stages close to the membrane fusion process implies a tight temporal and spatial regulation of their enzymatic activity. Several studies have shown that the monomeric ARF6 GTPase plays a crucial role in the exocytotic process by orchestrating both the activation of PLD1 and PIP5K at the plasma membrane. Interestingly, the activation of ARF6 is itself intimately linked to the exocytotic reaction (6Vitale N. Chasserot-Golaz S. Bailly Y. Morinaga N. Frohman M.A. Bader M.F. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). ARF6 associated to secretory granules is activated and further activates its downstream effectors only following the docking of granules to the plasma membrane (6Vitale N. Chasserot-Golaz S. Bailly Y. Morinaga N. Frohman M.A. Bader M.F. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), providing a spatial control of the exocytotic process. Hence, another parameter that requires a tight regulation relates to the length of the reactions, raising the question of the necessary counterpart inactivating ARF6 in the course of exocytosis. Like most small G proteins, ARF6 has little detectable GTPase activity and requires an interaction with a specific GTPase-activating protein (GAP) to return to its GDP-bound form and permit inactivation of the effector pathways. To date, the identity of these “off” signals required to terminate the exocytotic reaction remains unknown. Among the GAPs known to inactivate ARF proteins, GITs and ACAPs are the only subgroups that are active on ARF6, the most divergent protein of the ARF family (7Donaldson J.G. Jackson C.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). GIT1 was originally isolated as a protein interacting with G protein-coupled receptor kinases (8Premont R.T. Claing A. Vitale N. Freeman J.L. Pitcher J.A. Patton W.A. Moss J. Vaughan M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14082-14087Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and subsequently isolated by other groups through the interaction with various other proteins (7Donaldson J.G. Jackson C.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 9Randazzo P.A. Hirsch D.S. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 401-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The GIT family of proteins contains two known members, GIT1/Cat-1/p95 APP1 and GIT2/Cat-2/PKL/p95-APP2/KIAA0148. Both proteins contain an amino-terminal GAP domain that stimulates GTP hydrolysis by all members of the ARF family including ARF6 (10Vitale N. Patton W.A. Moss J. Vaughan M. Lefkowitz R.J. Premont R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13901-13906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In addition, GIT proteins contain various domains for protein interactions, including ankyrin repeats, a SpaII homology domain, the G protein-coupled receptor kinase-binding domain, and a paxillin-binding domain (11Donaldson J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41573-41576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). GIT proteins bind tightly to the Rho-type guanine-nucleotide exchange factors αPIX and βPIX to form oligomeric complexes (12Premont R.T. Perry S.J. Schmalzigaug R. Roseman J.T. Xing Y. Claing A. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 1001-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Together, GIT and PIX are present in focal adhesions and membrane protrusions of epithelial cells and fibroblasts, where they regulate the assembly and turnover of adhesion through scaffolding paxillin, p21-activated kinases, and the focal adhesion kinase (12Premont R.T.

Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In addition, GITs have been implicated in several cellular processes involving cytoskeletal reorganization and vesicular trafficking, including receptor endocytosis (14Claing A. Perry S.J. Achiriloaie M. Walker J.K. Albanesi J.P. Lefkowitz R.J. Premont R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), cell motility (15Di Cesare A.

Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was recently demonstrated that GIT proteins form a ternary complex with Piccolo and βPIX, possibly involved in the organization of the cytoskeletal matrix assembled at active zones, a specialized presynaptic plasma membrane region where synaptic vesicles dock and fuse (13Turner C.E. West K.A. Brown M.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 19Kim S. Ko J. Shin H. Lee J.R. Lim C. Han J.H. Altrock W.D. Garner C.C. Gundelfinger E.D.

However, the role of GIT proteins in neurotransmitter release and regulated exocytosis remains unknown, despite their widespread tissue expression, including in the brain. Here we report that GIT1 is present in neuroendocrine chromaffin and PC12 cells. In secretagogue-activated cells, GIT1 is recruited to the plasma membrane where it co-localizes with ARF6 and is responsible for GTP hydrolysis and ARF6 inactivation. Amperometric analysis of catecholamine release performed on individual chromaffin cells shows that GIT1 reduces the secretory activity. Our data suggest that GIT1 is a component of the exocytotic machinery that inactivates ARF6-dependent reactions and thereby negatively regulates and/or terminates exocytotic release.

ACAP1 and ACAP2 were cloned in the pBK plasmid with the HA tag. GIT1(R39A) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis with a QuikChange mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. The rat metallothionein-2 (MT-2) open reading frame was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR from PC12 cell mRNA as described (23Schweitzer J.K. D'Souza-Schorey C. J. Biol.

Sequences were confirmed by automated sequencing. Rat GIT1 cDNA fragments encoding the 19-nucleotide siRNA sequences ((i) GCAGGCTGAGCTGCTAGTA; (ii) GCACTCAGCAACCGGCTCT) derived from the target transcript and separated from their reverse 19-nucleotide complements by a short spacer were annealed and cloned in front of the H1-RNA promoter from the pSuper vector as described previously (21Vitale N.

The specificity of the sequence was verified by a BLAST search against the gene data bank. For mammalian expression vectors encoding both small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) and GH, a cassette containing the H1-RNA promoter and the silencing sequence was amplified by PCR as described previously (21Vitale N.

To estimate the silencing effect, the GIT1-shRNA plasmids were electroporated in 107 PC12 cells using an AMAXA electroporator (protocol U029), and 72 h post-transfection, cells were used for Western blot and immunofluorescence experiments. The transfection efficiency under these conditions was measured by counting GH-positive cells and was found to be nearly 50% in all conditions tested. Recombinant ARF-GAP1·His6, GIT1·His6, and (Δ45)GIT1·His6 proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (10Vitale N. Patton W.A. Moss J. Vaughan M. Lefkowitz R.J. Premont R.T. J. Biol.

Culture, Transfection, and Assay of GH Release from PC12 Cells—PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with glucose (4500 mg/liter) and containing 30 mm NaHCO3, 5% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Mammalian expression vectors were introduced into PC12 cells together with the GH plasmid pXGH5 (6-well dishes, 80% confluent, 4 μg of each plasmid/well) using GenePorter (Gene Therapy Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 5 h of incubation at 37 °C, 2 ml of culture medium containing fetal bovine serum, horse serum, and antibiotics was added. GH release experiments were performed 48 h after transfection. PC12 cells were washed twice with Locke's solution and then incubated for 10 min with calcium-free Locke's solution (basal release) or stimulated for 10 min with an elevated K+ solution (Locke's containing 59 mm KCl and 85 mm NaCl). The supernatant was collected and the cells harvested by scraping in 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline. The amounts of GH secreted into the medium and retained in the cells were measured using a radioimmunoassay kit (Nichols Institute). The amount of GH secretion is expressed as a percentage of total GH present in the cells before stimulation. Subcellular Fractionation—PC12 cells were washed twice with Locke's solution and then incubated for 10 min with Locke's solution (resting) or stimulated for 10 min with an elevated K+ solution. Medium was removed and cells immediately scraped in 1 ml of sucrose 0.32 m (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0). Cells were broken in a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 800 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting supernatant was further centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 × g to obtain the cytosol (supernatant) and microsomes (pellet enriched in endosomes). The 20,000 × g pellet containing the crude membrane fraction was resuspended in sucrose 0.32 m (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0), layered on a cushion sucrose density gradient (sucrose 1-1.6 m, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0) and centrifuged for 90 min at 100,000 × g to separate the plasma membrane from the secretory granules (20Caumont A.S.

The upper fractions containing SNAP25 (plasma membrane marker) and the pellet containing GH and dopamine-β-hydroxylase (secretory granule markers) were collected and resuspended in buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2) before protein quantification by Bradford measurements. Electrochemical Measurement of Catecholamine Secretion from Single Chromaffin Cells—Chromaffin cells were isolated from fresh bovine adrenal glands and maintained in primary culture essentially as described previously (24Caumont A.S.

Cells cultured on 35-mm Costar plates (Cambridge, MA) at a density of 7.5 × 105 cells/plate were washed with ascorbate-free Locke's solution and placed on the stage of an inverted microscope. Microinjection of GIT1, (Δ45)GIT1, and ARF-GAP1 in 10 mm PIPES, 50 mm potassium glutamate, pH 7.4, was performed with the Eppendorf injection system (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) using commercial glass microcapillaries (Femtotips, Eppendorf). Electrochemical measurements of catecholamine secretion were performed 15-30 min after microinjection as described previously (5Vitale N. Caumont A.S. Chasserot-Golaz S. Du G. Wu S. Sciorra V.A.

Pull-down Assay for Activated ARF6 in PC12 Cells—PC12 cells grown in 100-mm plates were transfected with various plasmids (for each 10 μg/plate) using GenePorter. 48 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with Locke's solution and then incubated for 15 min with Locke's solution (basal release) or stimulated with an elevated K+ solution. Medium was removed and cells immediately scraped in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2,1% Triton X-100, 0,05% cholate, 0.01% SDS, 1 mm dithiothreitol) with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm vanadate). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and immediately incubated with 20 μg of GST·MT-2 fusion protein conjugated with glutathione beads in the presence of 2 mm ZnCl2 for 1 h at 4 °Cwith rocking. The beads were collected and washed five times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm ZnCl2, and protease inhibitors. Bound proteins were eluted at 100 °C for 10 min in 100 μl of SDS loading buffer. 25-μl aliquots were subjected to SDS-PAGE. To compare ARF6 levels precipitated from extracts, Western blots were carried out with anti-HA antibodies. Immunoblotting, Immunofluorescence, and Confocal Microscopy—One-dimensional SDS gel electrophoresis was performed on 10% acrylamide gels in Tris-glycine buffer. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose sheets, and the immunoreactive bands were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). For immunocytochemistry, PC12 cells grown on poly d-lysine-coated glass coverslips were maintained in Locke's solution or stimulated with elevated K+. The cells were then fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.12 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and for a further 10 min in fixative containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Immunostaining was performed as described previously (6Vitale N. Chasserot-Golaz S. Bailly Y. Morinaga N. Frohman M.A. Bader M.F. J.

Quantification was performed using the Zeiss CSLM instrument 3.2 software. Expression and Subcellular Distribution of GIT1 in Chromaffin and PC12 Cells—Reverse transcription-PCR and immunoblot analysis using specific antibodies against GIT1 and GIT2 revealed that GIT1 is the predominant form expressed in chromaffin and PC12 cells (data not shown). Subcellular fractionation experiments indicated that GIT1 is primarily present in the cytosol (Fig. 1A), in agreement with the predominant soluble distribution of GIT1 found in other cell types (12Premont R.T.

We compared the distribution of endogenous GIT1 in subcellular fractions prepared from resting and secretagogue-stimulated PC12 cells. As illustrated in Fig. 1, A and B, stimulation with elevated K+ for 10 min, which initiates calcium-dependent exocytosis in PC12 cells, increased the amount of GIT1 detected in the plasma membrane fraction at the expense of the cytosolic fraction, revealing the translocation of GIT1 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane upon cell stimulation. The intracellular distribution of GIT1 was also examined by immunofluorescence in transfected PC12 cells expressing GIT1-FLAG because we could not detect endogenous GIT1. In resting cells, GIT1-FLAG staining appeared diffuse throughout the cell (Fig. 1C). In contrast, after membrane depolarization by high K+, a clear redistribution of GIT1 to the cell periphery was observed (Fig. 1C). Double labeling experiments revealed that in stimulated cells, GIT1 partially co-localizes with the plasma membrane marker protein SNAP25 (Fig. 1C). A semiquantitative analysis revealed that 11 ± 1% (n = 17 cells) of GIT1 co-localized with SNAP25 in resting cells, whereas in stimulated cells the co-localization level increased to 35.6 ± 2.7% (n = 15 cells). Taken together, these data indicate that secretagogue-evoked stimulation triggers the partial recruitment of cytosolic GIT1 to the cell periphery where exocytosis occurs in secreting cells. Scribble Retains GIT1 at the Plasma Membrane in Stimulated Cells—Scribble is a PDZ domain-containing protein present at the plasma membrane in PC12 cells. PDZ domains are protein-protein interaction modules devoted to the scaffolding of proteins in large multimolecular complexes. Using anti-Scribble antibodies to precipitate the protein from various mammalian cell extracts, we have recently identified the βPIX·GIT1 complex as a major component of the Scribble network (22Audebert S. Navarro C. Nourry C. Chasserot-Golaz S. Lecine P. Bellaiche Y. Dupont J.L. Premont R.T. Sempere C. Strub J.-M. Van Dorsselaer A. Vitale N. Borg J.P. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 987-995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Because in PC12 cells Scribble recruits βPIX to the plasma membrane in response to high K+ stimulation (22Audebert S. Navarro C. Nourry C. Chasserot-Golaz S. Lecine P. Bellaiche Y. Dupont J.L. Premont R.T. Sempere C. Strub J.-M. Van Dorsselaer A. Vitale N. Borg J.P. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 987-995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), we investigated whether Scribble might also be implicated in the anchoring of GIT1. In agreement with our previous study, Scribble is present at the plasma membrane in resting and stimulated PC12 cells (Fig. 2). Anchoring of Scribble at the plasma membrane relies entirely on its amino-terminal region because mutation of a single residue in the ScribblePL mutant (proline 305 changed to leucine) abrogated this membrane localization (Fig. 2). As illustrated in Fig. 2, expression of the ScribblePL mutant that localizes to the cytoplasm prevents the recruitment of GIT1 to the cell periphery upon high K+ stimulation. Thus, as for βPIX, the plasma membrane-bound Scribble is required for the dynamic relocalization of GIT1 in secretagogue-activated PC12 cells, presumably through the formation of a ternary Scribble·βPIX·GIT1 complex (22Audebert S. Navarro C. Nourry C. Chasserot-Golaz S. Lecine P. Bellaiche Y. Dupont J.L. Premont R.T. Sempere C. Strub J.-M. Van Dorsselaer A. Vitale N. Borg J.P. Curr.

GIT1 Is a Functional Element of the Exocytotic Machinery in PC12 and Chromaffin Cells—To establish whether GIT1 plays a role in exocytosis, we expressed various GIT1 proteins (GIT1 wild type, (Δ45)GIT1 in which the amino-terminal zinc finger motif has been deleted, and GIT1(R39A) having its GAP activity on ARF impaired) in PC12 cells. The effect of these proteins on PC12 cell secretion was examined using ectopically expressed GH as a secretory reporter (5Vitale N. Caumont A.S. Chasserot-Golaz S. Du G. Wu S. Sciorra V.A. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Bader M.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2424-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A illustrates the intracellular distribution of these various GIT1 proteins. All of them were cytosolic in resting cells and retained the ability to be recruited to the plasma membrane in stimulated cells. Moreover, we verified that over-expression of these GIT1 variants modified neither the level of total GH in PC12 cells nor its distribution in secretory granules (data not shown). Expression of GIT1 strongly inhibited GH secretion evoked by high K+ (Fig. 3B). In contrast, neither (Δ45)GIT1 nor GIT1(R39A) modified GH secretion (Fig. 3B). Expressio"

It has long been assumed that p53 pathways characterized in mammals apply to other vertebrates as well. Fish provide a useful model for the study of environmental carcinogenesis, and populations of fish inhabiting highly polluted environments provide information on the etiology of pollutant-mediated cancer. In this study, we investigated p53 protein and apoptosis induction in PLHC-1 (desert topminnow hepatocellular carcinoma), RTL-W1 (rainbow trout normal liver), and primary rainbow trout hepatocytes exposed to model chemotherapeutics. All of the chemicals used in these studies have been demonstrated to increase p53 protein levels and induce apoptosis in mammalian cell lines. In contrast, PLHC-1 p53 protein was not induced in response to any model mammalian p53 inducers following 24 h exposures. Additionally, both trout cell types demonstrated this same lack of p53 induction upon exposure to model chemotherapeutic drugs. PLHC-1 cells demonstrated an induction of apoptosis as measured by caspase-3 activation following exposure to all of the chemotherapeutics tested. Our results suggest that fish p53 may be activated differently from that of their mammalian counterparts, and that important differences may exist between phyla in the function and regulation of p53 as well as other mechanisms involved in environmental carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2065139423,"In a previous study of T338C CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) we found that protons and thiol-directed reagents modified channel properties in a manner consistent with the hypothesis that this residue lies within the conduction path, but the observed reactivity was not consistent with the presence of a single thiolate species in the pore. Here we report results consistent with the notion that the thiol moiety can exist in at least three chemical states, the simple thiol, and two altered states. One of the altered states displays reactivity toward thiols like dithiothreitol and 2-mercaptoethanol as well as reagents: mixed disulfides (methanethiosulfonate reagents: MTSET+, MTSES-) and an alkylating agent (iodoacetamide). The other altered state is unreactive. The phenotype associated with the reactive, altered state could be replicated by exposing oocytes expressing T338C CFTR to CuCl2, but not by glutathionylation or nitrosylation of the thiol or by oxidation with hydrogen peroxide. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that substituting a cysteine at 338 can create an adventitious metal binding site.

In such experiments a typical first step is to screen various cysteine-substituted constructs for reactivity using, for example, reagents such as MTSET+ or MTSES- that react with the thiolate anion by means of thiol-disulfide exchange (14Stauffer D.A. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6840-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The result is a pattern of reactivity, usually portrayed as the relative increase, decrease, or no change in conductance. In such an assay, if exposure to a reagent results in no change in conductance, it might be thought that the cysteine in question was not accessible to the reagents. It is recognized by practitioners, however, that a failure to respond could also reflect either the lack of any functional consequence of the reaction or altered reactivity of the engineered cysteine in its non-natural, protein environment. Although the latter possibility is generally recognized, potential mechanisms have not been studied in any detail (7Zhang H. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15856-15864Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 8Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 21Dawson D.C. Liu X. Zhang Z.-R. McCarty N.A. CFTR Chloride Channel.in: Kirk K. Dawson D. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2003: 1-34Google Scholar). We report here evidence that a cysteine substituted into transmembrane segment 6 of CFTR can undergo spontaneous changes in its reactivity toward thiol-directed reagents that can produce conflicting results in a screening assay. These effects appear to be attributable to changes in the chemical state of the cysteine thiol. The goal of the experiments described here was to use thiol reactivity to operationally define different states of the cysteine at position 338 and to compare altered reactivity with that induced experimentally. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the engineered cysteine is a component of an adventitious metal binding site that exhibits a high affinity for copper. Mutagenesis and in Vitro Transcription—The methods used for mutagenesis and in vitro transcription were similar to those reported previously (11Smith S.S. Liu X. Zhang Z.R. Sun F. Kriewall T.E. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 407-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 22Liu X. Smith S.S. Sun F. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, CFTR mutants were generated using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. The sequences in the region of the mutation and in the entire PCR-generated region were confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. The T338C CFTR mutants used in this study were generated on two different CFTR backgrounds, either the conventional WT background or a Cys-less background in which all the 18 endogenous cysteines were substituted with alternative amino acids (serine or leucine). The Cysless CFTR construct was a gift from Drs. Martin Mense and David Gadsby and was used in the pGEMHE vector as previously described by Chan et al. (23Chan K.W. Csanady L. Seto-Young D. Nairn A.C. Gadsby D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 163-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Mense et al. (24Mense M. White D.M. Vergani P. Nairn A.C. Gadsby D.C. Pediatr. Pulmonol. 2002; 24: A58Google Scholar) showed that the single-channel gating of Cys-less CFTR depends on protein kinase A and ATP in a manner similar to that of WT CFTR channels expressed in oocytes. Our preliminary experiments indicated that Cys-less CFTR behaved similarly to WT CFTR in terms of its anion selectivity, the I-V shape, and its non-responsiveness to thiol-directed reagents. To distinguish the two T338C mutants, the construct generated on the Cys-less background is labeled as T338C/Cys-less CFTR and that generated on the WT background is labeled T338C or T338C/WT CFTR. The CFTR cRNAs for Xenopus oocyte injection were synthesized using the in vitro transcription kit, mMessage mMachine or Ambion mMessage mMachine T7 Ultra transcription kit for the Cys-less CFTRs (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). The transcription products were purified and the quality and quantity of the transcripts were assessed on an agarose gel (11Smith S.S. Liu X. Zhang Z.R. Sun F. Kriewall T.E. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 407-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 22Liu X. Smith S.S. Sun F. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Oocyte Preparation and Electrophysiological Recordings—Protocols for preparing oocytes are described in Liu et al. (25Liu X. Zhang Z.R. Fuller M.D. Billingsley J. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 3826-3841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and the methods for whole cell recordings were identical to those described in Liu et al. (25Liu X. Zhang Z.R. Fuller M.D. Billingsley J. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 3826-3841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, individual oocytes were placed in the recording chamber and continuously perfused with frog Ringer solution containing (in mm): 98 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, 5 HEPES-HemiNa, pH 7.4. HEPES was replaced with TAPS to buffer the bathing solution to pH 9.0. All experiments were conducted at pH 7.4 unless specified. The volume of the perfusion chamber was about 100 μl and the flow rate was about 4 ml/min. Room temperature was between 19 and 22 °C. A two-electrode voltage clamp system (TEVC-200, Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN) was used for data acquisition. Oocytes were maintained under open circuit conditions, and periodically, the membrane potential was ramped from -120 to +60 mV over a period of 1.8 s to construct the whole cell I-V plots. The conductance was calculated from the slope of the I-V plot at the reversal potential (gCl at Vm = Erev) using a voltage range from Vm = Erev-10 mV and Vm = Erev + 10 mV. Data are reported as mean ± S.E. Atomic Absorption Measurements—Atomic absorption measurements were carried out using an AA6650 spectrometer (Shimadzu) equipped with a graphite furnace and an autosampler. 20 μl was injected up to 3 times depending on the standard deviation of measurements. The copper concentration was derived by comparing the absorption of the sample with that of a standard curve. Curve Fitting—All the curve fitting was performed in SigmaPlot (SPSS, Chicago, IL) using the built-in exponential functions (rise to maximum) for one or more exponential components. Reagents—Highly polar derivatives of methanethiolsulfonate, MTSET+ (2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate bromide) and MTSES- (sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate) were obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada). 2-Mercaptoethanol (2-ME), dithiothreitol (DTT), iodoacetamide (IAM), S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), and CuCl2 were obtained from Sigma. T338C/WT CFTR Conductance Was Markedly Altered by 2-ME or DTT Prior to Exposure to Exogenous Thiol-directed Reagents 5We use the term “thiol-directed reagents” to refer to species like MTS reagents or IAM that react with the thiolate anion to form, for example, a mixed disulfide or an alkylated thiol. 2-ME and DTT (reduced), although they are widely used in connection with disulfide chemistry, are not, strictly speaking, thiol-directed reagents as they do not react with the thiolate anion. —Exposing oocytes expressing T338C/WT CFTR to 2-ME or DTT during steady state activation led to increases in conductance (without any discernable change in reversal potential) that were rapid (t½ = 20 s), and of variable amplitude and were not seen in oocytes expressing CFTR constructs lacking the cysteine at 338, such as WT, T338A, T338H, T338S CFTR, or Cys-less CFTR. Shown in Fig. 1A is a representative experiment in which exposing an oocyte expressing T338C/WT CFTR to 1 mm 2-ME at steady state activation induced a rapid, over 2-fold increase in conductance (gCl at Vm = Erev). The conductance typically reached a maximum within the mixing time of the chamber, about 20-40 s following exposure. Similar results were obtained using DTT (see also Fig. A1, inset, for summary). In principle, an increase in conductance induced by 2-ME or DTT could reflect several possible mechanisms that are not mutually exclusive, including: 1) breaking an intraprotein disulfide bond, 2) reducing a protein sulfenic acid (Protein-SOH), 3) reducing a glutathionylated cysteine (Protein-SSG), 4) reducing protein nitrosothiol (Protein-SNO), or 5) ligation by thiol-based reducing agents of trace metals reacting with the cysteine thiol to form Protein-S-MLn, where Ln represents other metal ligands that could be derived from the peptide backbone, side chains, or exogenous mobile species such as other Cl- or OH- (26Strothkamp K.G. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 7488-7493Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 27McGuirl M. Brown D. Dooley D. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 336-428Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that the reducing agent effect was the result of breaking an intramolecular disulfide bond, we used a Cys-less CFTR construct in which all 18 endogenous cysteines were replaced with alternative amino acids. Reducing agents had no effect on the conductance of oocytes expressing Cys-less CFTR (Fig. 1B). 6Similarly, exposure to reducing agents was without effect on oocytes expressing either T338A or T338S CFTR, constructs that retain the 18 endogenous cysteines (see below). However, in oocytes expressing T338C/Cys-less CFTR, in which a cysteine was substituted at position 338 in the Cys-less background, 1 mm 2-ME induced a variable increase in conductance similar to that seen in oocytes expressing T338C/WT CFTR (Fig. 1C). These observations indicated that the cysteine substituted at position 338 was necessary and sufficient to account for the effects of reducing agents seen in oocytes expressing T338C/WT CFTR and ruled out the breaking of an intramolecular disulfide bond within a CFTR monomer as a mechanism for the increase in conductance. We also considered the possibility that the reducing agent-induced increase in CFTR conductance might reflect the breaking of a disulfide bond linking two CFTR peptides that form a dimeric channel (28Zerhusen B.

J. 2003; 374: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Recent covalent labeling studies, however, provided strong evidence that a single CFTR polypeptide forms a single anion-conducting pore (31Zhang Z. Cui G. Liu X. Song B. Dawson D. McCarty N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 458-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Furthermore, detailed studies of T338C/WT CFTR suggest that residue 338 lies within the pore (25Liu X. Zhang Z.R. Fuller M.D. Billingsley J. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 3826-3841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) where it exhibits reactivity toward mixed disulfides and alkylating agents that is not consistent with a disulfide bond (see also below). We concluded therefore, that the response depicted in Fig. 1, A and C, implies that the chemical state of the cysteine substituted at position 338 can be altered due to chemical reactions of the cysteine thiol at position 338 that do not involve formation of a disulfide bond with another peptide. The response of individual oocytes expressing T338C/WT CFTR to 2-ME or DTT varied widely, as indicated by the results compiled in Fig. 1, inset A1. Oocytes injected with comparable amounts of mRNA and maintained under identical conditions exhibited initial conductances ranging from 4 to 240 μS, and the response of these oocytes to 2-ME or DTT was proportionately greater in oocytes exhibiting a lower initial conductance. A similar pattern of reactivity was observed in oocytes expressing T338C/Cys-less CFTR (Fig. 1C, inset). The variable response to 2-ME or DTT was observed in oocytes from the same frog that were maintained under identical conditions and tested on the same day. The inverse correlation between the effect of a reducing agent and the initial conductance implies that the low, initial CFTR conductance exhibited by some of the oocytes was due to a reversible modification of the cysteine at position 338. The variability of the response to 2-ME or DTT suggested that, in any particular oocyte, the initial CFTR conductance reflected a mixed population of channels. In some of these channels, the cysteine was in the simple thiol form, S- or SH, whereas in others the thiol was modified to one or more of the thiol reaction products enumerated in the opening paragraph of “Results.” Exposing oocytes to a reducing agent apparently regenerated the simple thiol with a concomitant net increase in conductance. Evidence for a Terminal Oxidation State—In a previous study of T338C CFTR (25Liu X. Zhang Z.R. Fuller M.D. Billingsley J. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 3826-3841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) it became apparent that there was a high degree of variability in the response to thiol-directed reagents even if oocytes had been previously exposed to 2-ME or DTT. This observation led us to suggest that a variable portion of the channels was in a terminal or unreactive oxidation state such as a sulfinic acid or sulfonic acid (32Filomeni G. Rotilio G. Ciriolo M.R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 1057-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 33Sohn J. Rudolph J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10060-10070Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 34Kiley P.J. Storz G. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e400Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 35Poole L.B. Karplus P.A. Claiborne A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2004; 44: 325-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). This phenomenon is explored in more detail in the current study, and the results obtained using a variety of thiol-directed reagents uniformly suggest that whereas a variable subpopulation of T338C channels display altered reactivity that can be rescued by exposure to 2-ME or DTT, there is a second subpopulation of channels that is simply unreactive. Oocytes Expressing T338C/WT CFTR Displayed Highly Variable Reactivity Toward MTSET+ and MTSES-—The disparate response of oocytes expressing T338C CFTRs to 2-ME or DTT is compatible with the notion that, in any individual oocyte, a variable percentage of channels is in the simple thiol form (S-, SH). This hypothesis predicts that a similar variability should be apparent in the response of oocytes to mixed disulfide reagents like MTSET+ and MTSES-, which react only with the thiolate anion (36Roberts D.D. Lewis S.D. Ballou D.P. Olson S.T. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5595-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The results summarized in Fig. 2 support this hypothesis. Shown in Fig. 2, A and B, are representative experiments in which, following activation of T338C/WT CFTR, oocytes not previously exposed to 2-ME and DTT were exposed to 1 mm MTSET+. In one case (Fig. 2A) the initial exposure to MTSET+ produced about a 40% decrease in conductance that persisted following washout of the reagent as expected for a covalent interaction. Subsequent exposure to 2-ME (5 mm) increased the conductance as expected, but to a level greatly exceeding the initial conductance indicating that 2-ME not only reversed the reaction with MTSET+, but also increased the number of cysteines in the simple thiol form. A second exposure to MTSET+ then produced a decrease in conductance greater than that induced by the first exposure. In the second example (Fig. 2B), the initial response to 1 mm MTSET+ was a net increase in conductance. As indicated by the data plotted in Fig. 2B, inset, and C, this increase could be substantial. After a wash, exposure to 5 mm 2-ME increased the conductance further and a second exposure to 1 mm MTSET+ then decreased the conductance to a level that was comparable with that achieved by the first exposure to MTSET+. If the responses to MTSET+ after exposure to 2-ME or DTT, seen here and reported previously, represent the consequence of the reactions of the mixed disulfides with the thiolate anion, then the increase in conductance seen prior to exposure to 2-ME or DTT suggests that this reaction could represent the displacement of some other thiol adduct by the positively charged ethyl(trimethylammonium) thiol moiety. For example, if the altered state of the thiol bears a net negative charge, replacement by MTSET+ could produce a net increase in conductance despite the fact that the deposited group partially occludes the pore (25Liu X. Zhang Z.R. Fuller M.D. Billingsley J. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 3826-3841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The comparable conductance achieved by exposure to MTSET+ before and after 2-ME is expected if MTSET+ reacted not only with channels in the simple thiolate form, but also with those that were reversibly altered. The result was not obtained uniformly, however. In some cases the second exposure to MTSET+ resulted in a conductance significantly higher that the first exposure. The reasons for this are not completely clear, but the difference may indicate that the result of the displacement reaction is variable. This could arise because the population of channels that are sensitive to DTT and 2-ME is heterogeneous in some way not discerned in these studies. The data summarized by the gray triangles in Fig. 2C demonstrates that exposure of different oocytes expressing T338C/WT CFTR to MTSET+ under identical conditions, prior to any exposure to 2-ME and DTT, could result in an increase, a decrease, or no change in conductance! As suggested by the examples shown in Fig. 2B the functional effect of MTSET+ exhibited an inverse correlation with the initial conductance of the oocyte; oocytes with a low initial conductance reacted with an increase in conductance, whereas those with a higher initial conductance reacted with a decrease in conductance. Responses of naïve oocytes to MTSES- were uniformly inhibitory and the magnitude of the inhibition was not as variable as that seen with MTSET+. As indicated in Fig. 2D, pretreating oocytes with 2-ME or DTT altered the subsequent response to MTSET+ (open triangles) and MTSES- (open circles), but did not totally eliminate the variability. In pre-treated oocytes the effect of MTSET+ was uniformly inhibitory, as reported previously (25Liu X. Zhang Z.R. Fuller M.D. Billingsley J. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 3826-3841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but the extent of the inhibition varied widely, ranging from less than 20% to nearly 60% for MTSET+ and from 67 to nearly 93% for MTSES-. The greater average inhibition by MTSES- is consistent with the expected effect of depositing a negative charge in the anion conduction pathway (25Liu X. Zhang Z.R. Fuller M.D. Billingsley J. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 3826-3841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and suggests that, although both reactions may lead to partial obstruction of the pore, the effect of charge is, nevertheless, discernable. The observation that reactivity remains highly variable even after exposure to 10-20 mm 2-ME or DTT suggests that a variable population of the T338C channels is simply unreactive, due perhaps to some higher order oxidation of the thiol (32Filomeni G.

It should be noted that the cysteine at position 338 is essential for the effects of MTS reagents as well as 2-ME and DTT shown above, because neither the conductance due to T338A or T338S CFTR was sensitive to reducing agents or thioldirected reagents. 7X. Liu and D. C. Dawson, unpublished observation. Trapping Thiols with an Alkylating Agent, IAM—The results presented so far are compatible with a scheme in which the total conductance of an oocyte expressing T338C/WT CFTR or T338C/Cys-less CFTR comprises at least three components that we will label as gSH, gSX1, and gSX2, where the total conductance, gCl, is given by Equation 1. gCI=gSH+gSX1+gSX2(Eq. 1) Here gSH represents channels in which the cysteine at 338 is in the simple thiol form (S-,SH), and gSX1 and gSX2 represent channels containing one of two altered forms of the cysteine, one that reverts to the simple thiol in the presence of 2-ME and DTT (gSX1) and another (gSX2) that does not. We sought to isolate populations of altered channels by first trapping those in the thiolate form using an alkylating agent. Such reagents (e.g. IAM, iodoacetic acid, N-ethylmaleimide) form an irreversible, thioether bond with protein thiols and have been widely used to trap thiols in other proteins (12Means G.E. Feeney R.E. Chemical Modification of Proteins. HoldenDay, San Francisco1971Google Scholar, 15Jones J.G. Otieno S. Barnard E.A. Bhargava A.K.

We reasoned that trapping those channels in the thiolate form would enable us to separate the two remaining populations of channels (gSX1 + gSX2) using 2-ME or DTT and then a thiol-directed reagent. On the basis of preliminary experiments we chose IAM as the trapping agent because the predicted reaction results in the deposition of a relatively small substituent that does not carry a net charge (Equation 2) (12Means G.E. Feeney R.E. Chemical Modification of Proteins. HoldenDay, San Francisco1971Google Scholar, 38Hermanson G.T. Bioconjugate Techniques. Academic Press, San Diego1996Google Scholar). (Eq. 2) Fig. 3A contains a representative example (n = 5) of the somewhat surprising result of an attempt to trap thiols using an oocyte exhibiting a very low initial conductance (indicative of a high percentage of reversibly altered channels) that would be predicted to give rise to a large response to 2-ME or DTT. Exposure to millimolar concentrations of IAM, pH 7.4, induced a slow, monotonic increase in conductance. After the conductance reached a steady state, exposing the oocyte to 2-ME was without effect, nor was the conductance altered by exposure to MTSES-, as expected if all reactive thiols were blocked by reaction with IAM. Fig. 3A, inset, contains a plot of the response of several oocytes to IAM, representing a range of initial conductance. The change in conductance induced by IAM exhibited an inverse relationship with the initial conductance reminiscent of that seen with 2-ME or DTT (Fig. 1). This result suggested that the alkylation reaction trapped not only channels in the simple thiolate form, but also those represented by gSX1, channels that were spontaneously altered bu"
https://openalex.org/W2097974621,"The androgen receptor (AR) is fundamental to androgen signalling within the prostate gland, and deregulation of its activity is frequently linked to the development of prostate cancer. Advanced prostate cancer is often treated with chemotherapy and most of these drugs exert their function by generating genotoxic stress such as DNA damage. We have investigated here the effects of genotoxic agents used in chemotherapeutic regimens on AR function and expression. We have discovered that endogenous AR activity in LNCaP cells is inhibited in response to the chemotherapeutic agents etoposide and cisplatin. This loss of AR activity is not caused by a change in cell cycle distribution, a change in subcellular localisation of the AR nor by induction of apoptosis. In addition, we found that inhibition of AR activity in response to genotoxic stress is independent of p53 function. Interestingly, our studies revealed that genotoxic stress inhibits the hormone-stimulated recruitment of AR to androgen response elements. Thus, we report for the first time a mechanism by which the AR activity is inhibited in response to different chemotherapeutic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2087454943,"Insertion of the enteropathogenic Escherichia coli Tir protein into the plasma membrane of intestinal epithelial cells is a crucial event in infection because it provides a receptor for intimate bacterial adherence. This interaction with the bacterial outer membrane protein intimin is also essential in generating a number of signaling activities associated with virulence. Tir can be modified at various sites by phosphorylation and functionally interacts with multiple host proteins. To investigate the mechanism of membrane insertion and to establish a model system in which the multiple interactions/functions of Tir can be uncoupled and independently characterized, we used intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, surface plasmon resonance, and protease digestion assays to show that Tir can insert directly into phospholipid vesicles in a composition-dependent manner to generate the topology reported in vivo. This is the first time that Tir has been shown to insert into membranes in a simple model system in the absence of chemical modification or other factors. These data are consistent with the protein interacting with lipids through two sites. The major site is localized to the transmembrane/intimin-binding domain region and includes Trp235, which is shown to be an effective reporter of interaction. The minor site is located within the C-terminal domain. Together, these data support a model in which Tir is released into the cytoplasm by the type III translocon and then independently inserts into the plasma membrane from a cytoplasmic location.

EPEC pathogenesis is dependent on (a) an active virulence-associated type III secretion system (TTSS) that directly injects “effector” proteins into host cells and (b) the interaction of Tir (translocated intimin receptor; one such effector protein), inserted into the host cell membrane, with the bacterial outer membrane protein intimin (recently reviewed in Refs. 4Nougayrede J.P.

The intimate adhesion of bacteria to host cell membranes as mediated by the intimin-Tir interaction is essential for virulence (6de Grado M. Abe A. Gauthier A. Steele-Mortimer O. DeVinney R.

Maresca M. Kenny B. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Following delivery by the TTSS, Tir inserts into the host cell plasma membrane, adopting a distinct topology composed of a large extracellular loop (the intimin-binding domain (IBD), residues 255–364) and N-terminal (residues 1–233) and C-terminal (residues 385–550) domains, which remain on the cytosolic face of the membrane (7Kenny B.

Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1229-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). These domains are linked by two predicted transmembrane helices (residues 234–254 and 365–384). In this topology, the extracellular domain is available to bind intimin (see Ref. 11Luo Y. Frey E.A. Pfuetzner R.A. Creagh A.L. Knoechel D.G. Haynes C.A. Finlay B.B. Strynadka N.C. Nature. 2000; 405: 1073-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar for the x-ray crystal structure of this interaction), and the N- and C-terminal domains are exposed to the cytoplasm for interaction with host cell proteins. The mechanism by which Tir inserts into the target cell membrane following delivery by the TTSS is poorly understood, and very little detail is available at the molecular level. Ectopic expression of Tir within host cells can produce a functional inserted protein that interacts with intimin (12Campellone K.G. Rankin S. Pawson T. Kirschner M.W. Tipper D.J. Leong J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 407-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), demonstrating that the protein can insert from the cytoplasm and does not require other bacterial factors. However, it remains possible that insertion can be enhanced by bacterial factors (acting as efficiency factors) and/or host factors such as kinases that modify Tir (e.g. phosphorylation). To uncouple the multiple factors involved in Tir localization and function and to investigate the properties described above requires an in vitro model system in which tight control can be maintained over contributing factors. Following expression in vivo, Tir is bound by its TTSS chaperone CesT. This interaction stabilizes the protein in the bacteria and assists in trafficking to the bacterial side of the TTSS (13Thomas N.A. Deng W. Puente J.L. Frey E.A. Yip C.K. Strynadka N.C. Finlay B.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 1762-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 14Abe A. de Grado M. Pfuetzner R.A. Sanchez-Sanmartin C. DeVinney R. Puente J.L. Strynadka N.C. Finlay B.B. Mol.

Previous studies with purified soluble Tir have shown that it adopts a folded structure (16Hawrani A. Dempsey C.E. Banfield M.J. Scott D.J. Clarke A.R. Kenny B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25839-25846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and recent data show that the protein exists as a monomer (as determined by analytical ultracentrifugation), is monodisperse (as determined by dynamic light scattering), and displays cooperative unfolding kinetics (as measured by thermal denaturation circular dichroism). 4P. R. Race, J. H. Lakey, and M. J. Banfield, unpublished data. 4P. R. Race, J. H. Lakey, and M. J. Banfield, unpublished data. Therefore, current evidence shows that Tir can be produced in the absence of CesT and appears to adopt a stable state in solution. To date, some of the best studied examples of proteins that undergo transitions from soluble to membrane-inserted forms are bacterial pore-forming toxins such as the colicins and perfringolysin O (reviewed in Ref. 17Parker M.W. Feil S.C. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2005; 88: 91-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). There are also well characterized examples of proteins that transfer a catalytic domain across membranes upon insertion (e.g. cholera toxin) (reviewed in Ref. 17Parker M.W. Feil S.C. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2005; 88: 91-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SipB, a virulence factor from Salmonella, has been shown to insert into membranes from a soluble state in vitro, translocating a 50-residue hydrophilic domain across the bilayer (18McGhie E.J. Hume P.J. Hayward R.D. Torres J. Koronakis V. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1309-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Generally, these proteins initially adhere to and penetrate through the outer leaflet of membranes. In contrast, Tir has the unusual property of initial interaction and penetration through the inner leaflet. Given the different lipid compositions and membrane environments of these surfaces (fluidity, charge), studying Tir membrane insertion may provide important insights into the general mechanisms used by proteins to insert into membranes. To investigate the mechanism of Tir insertion into the plasma membrane in vivo, we used biophysical and biochemical techniques to probe the protein's interaction with membranes, including a mimic of the human erythrocyte inner leaflet (15% phosphatidylcholine (PC), 10% sphingomyelin (SM), 45% phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and 30% phosphatidylserine (PS)) (19Virtanen J.A. Cheng K.H. Somerharju P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4964-4969Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) as an model of the Tir target membrane and 100% PC as a control model membrane in vitro. These membranes were prepared in the form of small and large unilamellar vesicles, as appropriate. Similar in vitro approaches have been extensively used in the study of how both non-integral membrane proteins and lipid-binding proteins interact with membranes (20Hong Q. Gutierrez-Aguirre I. Barlic A. Malovrh P. Kristan K. Podlesek Z. Macek P. Turk D. Gonzalez-Manas J.M. Lakey J.H. Anderluh G. J. Biol.

Acta. 2004; 1660: 16-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), in addition to the bacterial toxin examples given above. The results are consistent with Tir interacting with membranes via two sites. The first encompasses the transmembrane/IBD region of the protein, which translocates across the membrane; the second is within the C-terminal domain. Data showing that membrane composition is a key determinant of Tir-membrane interaction are also presented. These data not only illustrate that Tir possesses sufficient structural information for insertion into specific membranes (mimicking target composition), but also provide a simple model with which to further study this novel insertion mechanism and the role of accessory factors and/or protein modification. Materials—PC, PS, PE, and SM were purchased from Lipid Products (South Nutfield, UK). All other materials were from Sigma (Poole, UK) unless specified. Generation of Wild-type Tir Constructs—Generation of the full-length (FL-Tir) and C-terminal domain (cTir) constructs of Tir has been described previously (16Hawrani A. Dempsey C.E. Banfield M.J. Scott D.J. Clarke A.R. Kenny B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25839-25846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain (nTir) was generated by PCR using the vector encoding FL-Tir as a template and primers 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATA-3′ (T7 promoter region) and 5′-GCTAGCAACGCTGGAATTTGTTGTTGAAGT-3′ (coding region up to Val228, followed by an NheI site (underlined)). This fragment was cloned into pGEM-T. The pGEM-T/nTir vector was then cut with BamHI and NheI and cloned into pET27b, precut with the same enzymes. For the transmembrane/IBD region deletion mutant (ΔTM-Tir), the N-terminal region of the protein was cloned into pGEM-T as described above using primer 5′-AAGCTTAACGCTGGAATTTGTTGTTGAAGT-3′, which encodes a HindIII site (underlined) rather than an NheI site. The pGEM-T/nTir-HindIII vector was then cut with BamHI and HindIII and cloned into the pET27b/cTir vector, precut with BamHI and HindIII, as described (16Hawrani A. Dempsey C.E. Banfield M.J.

This leads to a vector encoding residues 1–228 and 387–550 with a non-native Lys-Leu linker between the domains. Constructs were checked for any PCR-induced errors by DNA sequencing. All plasmids were transformed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells for protein expression. A schematic representation of the constructs is shown in Fig. 4B. Generation of Tryptophan Mutants—Trp-to-Phe mutants of FL-Tir were generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's protocol. Mutants (underlined) were generated using the following primers: W145F, 5′-CATTAAGTCCTCAAGAATTTAGCAGCTTGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCAAGCTGCTAAATTCTTGAGGACTTAATG-3′ (reverse); W235F, 5′-GATCCTAAATTCTTTGTTTCTGTCGGCGCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGCGCCGACAGAAACAAAGAATTTAGGATC-3′ (reverse); and W443F, 5′-ACACACTTTTCAGATTCCTCTAGCGAAGTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CACTTCGCTAGAGGAATCTGAAAAGTGTGT-3′ (reverse). For all mutagenesis reactions, the template used was pET27b/FL-Tir (wild-type) (16Hawrani A. Dempsey C.E. Banfield M.J. Scott D.J. Clarke A.R. Kenny B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25839-25846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), except for generation of the double mutant W145F/W443F, where W443F was generated using pET27b/FL-Tir(W145F) as a template. Mutagenized PCR products were transformed directly into BL21(DE3) cells for protein expression. Trp-to-Phe mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression and Purification of Wild-type and Mutant Tir Proteins—FL-Tir (wild-type and tryptophan mutants), nTir, cTir, and ΔTM-Tir were expressed and purified essentially as described previously (16Hawrani A.

The proteins used in this study contained a vector-encoded C-terminal herpes simplex virus and His tag (pET27b) and yielded a single band when examined by 15% SDS-PAGE, confirming sample purity. The previously documented (16Hawrani A. Dempsey C.E. Banfield M.J. Scott D.J. Clarke A.R. Kenny B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25839-25846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) unusual SDS-PAGE resolving properties of FL-Tir and cTir were reproduced here and were also observed for nTir (predicted molecular mass of 24 kDa and resolved molecular mass on SDS-polyacrylamide gel of 31 kDa) and ΔTM-Tir (predicted molecular mass of 40 kDa and resolved molecular mass on SDS-polyacrylamide gel of 55 kDa). Protein concentrations were calculated from absorbance at 280 nm using extinction coefficients of 24,750 m–1 cm–1 for FL-Tir; 19,060 m–1 cm–1 for the W145F, W235F, and W445F mutants; 5690 m–1 cm–1 for nTir; 10,810 m –1 cm–1 for cTir; and 16,500 m–1 cm–1 for ΔTM-Tir. Preparation of Lipid Vesicles—Lipids in chloroform/methanol were dried under a stream of nitrogen gas. Dried samples were placed under vacuum for 3 h to remove any remaining organic solvent. The subsequent lipid cake was resuspended in vesicle resuspension buffer by vigorous mixing. Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) were prepared from the lipid suspension (2 mg/ml) by sonication (with a probe) on ice for 8 × 3 min with a 2-min cooling period between each burst. SUV suspensions were then centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 45 min at 20 °C to remove lipid aggregates. For large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs), the lipid suspension (10 mg/ml) was extruded 21 times through two 100-μm polycarbonate filters using a mini extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids). LUV suspensions were centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 45 min at 20 °C to remove lipid aggregates. The formation of a single population of both SUVs and LUVs of suitable size (35–45- and 100–110-nm diameters, respectively) was confirmed by dynamic light scattering. The final SUV and LUV suspensions were stored at 4 °C for 24 h prior to use. The lipid vesicles used in this study were composed of 15% PC, 10% SM, 45% PE, and 30% PS (based on the composition of the human erythrocyte inner leaflet (19Virtanen J.A. Cheng K.H. Somerharju P.

Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence measurements were performed using a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorometer (Varian Inc.). Measurements were performed at 25 °C in vesicle resuspension buffer. SUVs (2 mg/ml) were incrementally added in 20-μl aliquots to 300 μl of wild-type or mutant FL-Tir (0.2 mg/ml), and tryptophan emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 450 nm at 124 nm/min, with excitation and emission slit widths set at 5 nm. The excitation wavelength used was 295 nm. SUVs were used to minimize the effects of light scattering. The intensities were corrected for the dilution factor, and the background was subtracted using appropriate blanks with SUVs only. Data were plotted without smoothing using Excel™ and analyzed by calculation of the barycentric mean of the peaks (23Lakey J.H. Massotte D. Heitz F. Dasseux J.L. Faucon J.F. Parker M.W. Pattus F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 599-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) in the range of 320–370 nm. Binding Experiments Using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)—SPR measurements were performed using a Biacore 2000 system (Biacore AB, Bedfordshire, UK) at 25 °C. SUVs (50 μl, 2 mg/ml) were immobilized on the surface of a Pioneer L1 sensor chip (Biacore AB) in vesicle resuspension buffer at 2 μl/min. Loosely bound lipids were removed by two 10-μl injections of water and equilibrated in buffer at a flow rate of 2 μl/min. The surface of the chip was “blocked” using a 50-μl injection of bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) at 2 μl/min to prevent nonspecific interactions between the analyte and the chip surface. The analytes, FL-Tir (wild-type and tryptophan mutants), nTir, cTir, and ΔTM-Tir (20 μl) were injected at a flow rate of 2 μl/min over the immobilized vesicles. Finally, the chip surface was washed using two injections of buffer containing 1 m NaCl to remove nonspecifically bound proteins from the immobilized vesicles. Following each measurement, the chip was regenerated by washing with 20 mm CHAPS, which removed the membranes along with the bound protein. The chip was considered regenerated (free from lipid) when the base line of the sensorgram returned to the previous level. Trypsin Encapsulation and Protection Assays—For vesicle-encapsulated trypsin assays, LUVs composed of the erythrocyte inner leaflet mixture (10 mg/ml) and containing trypsin were prepared by extrusion. Trypsin (5 mg/ml) in vesicle resuspension buffer was used to hydrate and extrude the lipid mixture. Non-encapsulated trypsin was removed by passage through two 1-ml benzamidine-Sepharose columns (Amersham Biosciences) joined sequentially and equilibrated in vesicle resuspension buffer. Trypsin-containing vesicles were initially incubated in the presence of 20 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride at 25 °C for 5 min. Following the addition of Tir (200 μg), samples were incubated at 37 °C for 40 min. Proteins from the digests were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE. Encapsulated trypsin digestion products were characterized by whole protein MALDI mass spectrometry and either N-terminal sequencing or peptide mass fingerprinting (where protein concentrations were insufficient to permit sequencing). For the protease protection assays, FL-Tir, nTir, cTir, and ΔTM-Tir were mixed with an excess of erythrocyte inner leaflet lipid vesicles (200 μg) and incubated at 20 °C for 1 h to allow protein binding. Trypsin was added to the proteoliposomes, and the mixture was incubated at either 20 or 37 °C for 1–16 h. After the addition of 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, samples were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE. Protein bands were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. For control experiments, Tir proteins were mixed with trypsin in the absence of liposomes. Protected protein fragments were resolved by SDS-PAGE and identified by MALDI mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing (as described for trypsin encapsulation experiments). The Interaction of Tir with Membranes Is Dependent on Lipid Composition—Bioinformatic analysis of the predicted transmembrane regions of Tir revealed the presence of a single tryptophan residue (Trp235) that could act as a fluorescent reporter of membrane interaction. As the lipid composition of membranes can have a major influence on the propensity of proteins to interact with or to insert into lipid bilayers (24Barlic A. Gutierrez-Aguirre I. Caaveiro J.M. Cruz A. Ruiz-Arguello M.B. Perez-Gil J. Gonzalez-Manas J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34209-34216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 25Ray S. Chakrabarti A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2004; 21: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the binding of wild-type FL-Tir to vesicles of varying composition was monitored after the addition of SUVs. The interaction of the protein with vesicles was shown to be composition-dependent. Initially, binding to vesicles composed of either the human erythrocyte inner leaflet mixture (as a mimic of the Tir host cell target membrane) or PC only (as a generic neutral membrane) was investigated. The binding of FL-Tir to the inner leaflet mixture vesicles resulted in a blue shift in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (Fig. 1A), consistent with the transfer of solvent-exposed tryptophan residues to a more hydrophobic phase (21Saito H. Dhanasekaran P. Nguyen D. Deridder E. Holvoet P. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20974-20981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 26Macek P. Zecchini M. Pederzolli C. Dalla Serra M. Menestrina G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The blue shift was accompanied by a quenching of the fluorescence signal (Fig. 1A). When presented as a function of SUV concentration, the shift in the barycentric mean of the data yields a curve describing Tir-SUV interaction (Fig. 1B). The degree of blue shift was proportional to the amount of SUV added up to a molar ratio of 260:1 (lipid/protein), with subsequent additions consistent with saturation of the effect and therefore representing a clear end state for the interaction. Where a blue shift (∼2 nm) was observed for the inner leaflet mixture, the experiment using pure PC vesicles displayed a shift of only ∼0.2 nm (Fig. 1B). Also, where a quenching of fluorescence was observed with the inner leaflet mixture, negligible quenching was observed with pure PC (data not shown). To investigate which of the individual components of the complex inner leaflet mixture may be important for FL-Tir binding, interactions with 7.5:2.5 PC/PS, 7.5:2.5 PC/PE, and 7.5:2.5 PC/SM were investigated. In turn, each of these probed whether negative charge (PS), PE, or SM is important for the interaction. The plots of the barycentric means describing the interactions are shown in Fig. 1B. It is clear that, whereas a small change in fluorescence signal was observed with the 7.5:2.5 PC/PS and 7.5:2.5 PC/PE vesicles, only the interaction with the 7.5:2.5 PC/SM vesicles reproduced the specific saturable effect observed for the interaction with the inner leaflet mixture. Given these results, further experiments focused on vesicles composed of the inner leaflet mixture (as a mimic of the Tir target membrane) and pure PC (as a negative control). These were chosen in an effort to ensure the in vitro studies may be of relevance to in vivo mechanisms. Tir-Membrane Interaction Involves the Region Including Trp235—The tryptophan fluorescence experiments described above demonstrated that Tir interacted best with membranes composed of the inner leaflet mixture, and not pure PC. However, predicting the region of the protein that contributes to this signal (and therefore partitions to the membrane) is complicated by the presence of three tryptophans in the protein's sequence. As mentioned above, one of these is within a predicted transmembrane region (Trp235); there is also one in the N-terminal domain (Trp145) and one in the C-terminal domain (Trp443) (see Fig. 4B). To determine the relative contributions of the three tryptophans to the observed fluorescence change, each residue was independently mutated to phenylalanine (W145F, W235F, and W445F). These mutants were expressed and purified using the same protocol described for the wild-type protein. The far-UV CD spectrum of each purified protein overlays on that of the wild-type protein, suggesting that the overall fold of the protein is maintained (data not shown). Also, the binding of the mutants to lipid vesicles was comparable with that of the wild-type protein as measured by SPR (data not shown), demonstrating that tryptophans at these positions are not essential for lipid binding. The W145F and W443F mutants exhibited blue shifts identical to those observed for the wild-type protein (∼2 nm) (Fig. 2), indicating that regions surrounding these residues do not interact directly with the vesicle bilayer. In contrast, the W235F mutant showed no shift or quenching of the fluorescence signal following the addition of SUVs (Fig. 2). To confirm that the fluorescence blue shift can be completely accounted for by Trp235, the double mutant W145F/W443F was constructed. This protein displayed essentially the same blue shift/fluorescence quench change as observed for the wild-type protein (Fig. 2). In fact, the individual blue shift was slightly larger, as would be expected following the removal of Trp145 and Trp443, which do not contribute to the shift. The Interaction of Tir with Lipids Is Mediated by Two Binding Sites—The interaction of FL-Tir and individual Tir domains with vesicles was further investigated by SPR. SPR can be used to investigate the interaction of proteins with lipid vesicles immobilized on a hydrophobic surface (26Macek P. Zecchini M. Pederzolli C. Dalla Serra M. Menestrina G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 27Malovrh P. Barlic A. Podlesek Z. MaCek P. Menestrina G. Anderluh G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The system employed utilized SUVs (composed of the inner leaflet mixture and pure PC) immobilized on a Pioneer L1 gold chip (28Cooper M.A. Hansson A. Lofas S. Williams D.H. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 277: 196-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) as the ligand and FL-Tir (or individual domains) over a range of concentrations as the analyte. Changes in response as a result of protein binding were measured (Fig. 3A), and the interaction of each of the individual Tir constructs was compared (Fig. 3B). FL-Tir,"
