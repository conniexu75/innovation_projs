Electron micrographs have since shown that various viruses do give hexagonal images. This is clearly the case, for example, for the plant virus of turnip yellow mosaic2 and for an insect virus that infects the larvæ of the crane fly3. We now report finding a similar hexagonal shape for the particles of adenovirus which is a human pathogen."

https://openalex.org/W2026247315,"THE surprising fact that during regeneration of rhodopsin in the dark after sufficient light adaptation the electroretinogram does not begin to increase in size until some 50 per cent rhodopsin has been regenerated was originally demonstrated in cats and frogs1. Fig. 1 (open circles) shows that also in light-adapted man (three cases) there is an initial phase of very slow recovery of the b-wave of the electroretinogram in the dark, followed by a faster rise. On the suspicion that the initial delayed recovery might be due to a general suppression of rod-action on the part of the cones the experiment was repeated with a cone-blind woman. Her electroretinogram (Fig. 1, filled circles), indeed, showed Ho initial period of delay but began to rise immediately, as does regeneration of rhodopsin. It was 3 min. before the controls showed any response at all."

https://openalex.org/W1974423327,IN a previous communication1 the formation of hexosamine in epiphyseal cartilage homogenate of young rabbits was reported.
https://openalex.org/W2041626679,"DURING attempts to modify the development of feather tracts, Saunders had noted the fact that skin wounds in three-day chick embryos failed to heal1. This casual observation, which contrasted curiously with the numerous reports on smooth healing of embryonic transplants and the repair of older skin, seemed to hold a promising clue to the mechanisms of wound healing in general. We therefore undertook a more systematic study of the phenomenon, the first results of which are reported in the following."

https://openalex.org/W2000718300,"WHILE investigating the cytology and cytochemistry of the adenohypophysis of the female rabbit, it was discovered that the fixation of whole pituitaries by immersion in the fixative was unsatisfactory. The reaction of the basophil cells to the periodic acid–Schiff procedure and to the Gram technique was extremely inconstant. It was clear that the total number of basophils was not being demonstrated and there was often much diffuse coloration of cells the exact nature of which it was difficult to determine. Commonly, also, a peripheral rind of distorted cells was produced, the staining of which was atypical."

The present communication describes a similar investigation on the distribution of carbon-14 in both hexose moieties of lactose obtained from the milk of a goat employing sodium formate-14C as the lactose precursor (lactose-14C was obtained through the courtesy of Mr. S. Misler, of these Laboratories)."

https://openalex.org/W1999297027,THE problem of inducible enzyme synthesis is currently receiving much attention because of its obvious value in the study of protein and nucleic acid formation and their interrelationship1.
https://openalex.org/W2020823365,"BECAUSE of the enormously high activity of β-glucuronidase in the preputial gland of the female rat1, this tissue appeared to be a promising source of the purified enzyme. For other tissues employed for this purpose, the specific activity, the degree of purification and the recovery are as follows: ox liver2 (32,000, 800-fold, 5 per cent), calf spleen3 (7,900, 1,400-fold, 1 per cent), calf liver4 (60,000, 9,000-fold, 10 per cent). The specific activity is expressed as µgm. phenolphthalein liberated from phenolphthalein glucuronide by 1 mgm. of protein in 1 hr. at 37° C., and the last two preparations were assayed in presence of deoxyribonucleic acid. A specific activity of 107,000 was observed with the best individual preparation from calf liver4, and this was claimed to represent a purity of 85 per cent."

The descriptions of the neotenic (branchial) form given by these authors show several important discrepancies, and in view of this a re-examination of the species was undertaken."
