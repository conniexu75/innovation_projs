https://openalex.org/W3174093303,"Emerging evidence indicates a fundamental role for the epigenome in immunity. Here, we mapped the epigenomic and transcriptional landscape of immunity to influenza vaccination in humans at the single-cell level. Vaccination against seasonal influenza induced persistently diminished H3K27ac in monocytes and myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs), which was associated with impaired cytokine responses to Toll-like receptor stimulation. Single-cell ATAC-seq analysis revealed an epigenomically distinct subcluster of monocytes with reduced chromatin accessibility at AP-1-targeted loci after vaccination. Similar effects were observed in response to vaccination with the AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 pandemic influenza vaccine. However, this vaccine also stimulated persistently increased chromatin accessibility at interferon response factor (IRF) loci in monocytes and mDCs. This was associated with elevated expression of antiviral genes and heightened resistance to the unrelated Zika and Dengue viruses. These results demonstrate that vaccination stimulates persistent epigenomic remodeling of the innate immune system and reveal AS03's potential as an epigenetic adjuvant."

However, the endogenous antigenicity and clinical potential of such splicing-derived epitopes have not been tested. Here, we demonstrate that pharmacologic modulation of splicing via specific drug classes generates bona fide neoantigens and elicits anti-tumor immunity, augmenting checkpoint immunotherapy. Splicing modulation inhibited tumor growth and enhanced checkpoint blockade in a manner dependent on host T cells and peptides presented on tumor MHC class I. Splicing modulation induced stereotyped splicing changes across tumor types, altering the MHC I-bound immunopeptidome to yield splicing-derived neoepitopes that trigger an anti-tumor T cell response in vivo. These data definitively identify splicing modulation as an untapped source of immunogenic peptides and provide a means to enhance response to checkpoint blockade that is readily translatable to the clinic.

Immune checkpoint blockade has greatly improved outcomes for several malignancies that are challenging to treat. Therapeutic benefit is associated with increased mutational burden (Marabelle et al., 2020Marabelle A. Fakih M. Lopez J. Shah M. Shapira-Frommer R. Nakagawa K. Chung H.C. Kindler H.L.

Coding mutation-derived neoantigens are best studied, but neoantigens can also arise from other processes, such as altered RNA splicing. Two studies analyzing The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data concluded that tumor-specific alternative splicing is abundant and may generate peptides that contribute to epitope repertoires (Jayasinghe et al., 2018Jayasinghe R.G.

Another study demonstrated that peptides translated from retained introns arising from incomplete RNA splicing can be presented by MHC I in cancer cell lines (Smart et al., 2018Smart A.C. Margolis C.A. Pimentel H. He M.X. Miao D. Adeegbe D. Fugmann T. Wong K.K. Van Allen E.M. Intron retention is a source of neoepitopes in cancer.Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36: 1056-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These provided proof-of-concept that splicing-derived peptides may serve as neoepitopes. However, whether splicing-derived neoepitopes elicit an endogenous immune response remains unknown, in part due to the inherent complexity of RNA processing and corresponding challenges with robustly identifying candidate splicing-derived neoantigens. Determining whether splicing alterations can generate bona fide neoantigens is particularly important given the development of multiple clinical-grade compounds that alter RNA splicing via non-overlapping mechanisms. Many compounds, such as pladienolide B, GEX1A, E7107, and H3B-8800, inhibit the SF3b splicing complex’s interactions with RNA (Lee et al., 2016Lee S.C. Dvinge H. Kim E. Cho H. Micol J.B. Chung Y.R.

Recently, a series of “anti-cancer sulfonamides,” including indisulam and E7820, were found to degrade the accessory splicing factor RBM39 by rendering it a neosubstrate for the Ddb1/CUL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase (Han et al., 2017Han T. Goralski M. Gaskill N. Capota E. Kim J. Ting T.C. Xie Y. Williams N.S. Nijhawan D. Anticancer sulfonamides target splicing by inducing RBM39 degradation via recruitment to DCAF15.Science. 2017; 356: eaal3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Additionally, blocking post-translational modifications of splicing factors, which are required for spliceosome assembly and effective splicing catalysis, can robustly perturb splicing. For example, RNA splicing factors are the most heavily arginine-methylated proteins (Musiani et al., 2019Musiani D. Bok J. Massignani E. Wu L. Tabaglio T. Ippolito M.R. Cuomo A. Ozbek U. Zorgati H. Ghoshdastider U. et al.Proteomics profiling of arginine methylation defines PRMT5 substrate specificity.Sci. Signal. 2019; 12: eaat8388Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), thus, drugs that block asymmetric or symmetric arginine dimethylation by inhibiting type I or II protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) potently perturb splicing (Fedoriw et al., 2019Fedoriw A.

Here, we address the central question of whether altered RNA splicing generates immunologically meaningful neoantigens to provoke an effective anti-tumor immune response. We hypothesized that pharmacologic splicing modulation might generate aberrant mRNAs encoding novel proteins, a subset of which could be translated and presented by MHC I as neoepitopes that provoke anti-tumor immunity. We first tested this by treating cancer cell lines with the RBM39-degrader indisulam at doses sub-inhibitory for growth (Figure 1A). This yielded graded RBM39 degradation but little effect on growth (Figures 1B, S1A, and S1B). Across cell lines, ex vivo treatment and drug washout yielded sustained suppression of RBM39 protein following drug removal, with minimal effects on subsequent proliferation or apoptosis (Figures 1C, 1D, S1C, and S1D). Drug treatment also did not notably change MHC I/II, PD-L1, cytokine, or death receptor expression (Figures S1E and S1F). In contrast, identical cells exhibited strikingly durable growth inhibition following engraftment into mice, despite transient drug exposure (Figures 1E, 1F, and S1G). The effect was dose dependent, with increasing drug concentrations causing increased splicing alterations (Figures S1H–S1K), reduced tumor growth (Figures S1L–S1N), and improved survival (Figure S1O).Figure S1Pharmacologic perturbation of RNA splicing impairs tumor growth in vivo, in a dose-dependent fashion dependent on adaptive immunity, related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Left, western blot of RBM39 after in vitro exposure to the indicated concentrations of indisulam for 24 hours in MC38 and CT26 cells.

Due to deleterious mutations, it has remained a challenge to develop highly homozygous inbred lines, a prerequisite to breed hybrid potato. Here, we employed genome design to develop a generation of pure and fertile potato lines and thereby the uniform, vigorous F1s. The metrics we applied in genome design included the percentage of genome homozygosity and the number of deleterious mutations in the starting material, the number of segregation distortions in the S1 population, the haplotype information to infer the break of tight linkage between beneficial and deleterious alleles, and the genome complementarity of the parental lines. This study transforms potato breeding from a slow, non-accumulative mode into a fast-iterative one, thereby potentiating a broad spectrum of benefits to farmers and consumers."

Here, we report the first HLA-I immunopeptidome of SARS-CoV-2 in two cell lines at different times post infection using mass spectrometry. We found HLA-I peptides derived not only from canonical open reading frames (ORFs) but also from internal out-of-frame ORFs in spike and nucleocapsid not captured by current vaccines. Some peptides from out-of-frame ORFs elicited T cell responses in a humanized mouse model and individuals with COVID-19 that exceeded responses to canonical peptides, including some of the strongest epitopes reported to date. Whole-proteome analysis of infected cells revealed that early expressed viral proteins contribute more to HLA-I presentation and immunogenicity. These biological insights, as well as the discovery of out-of-frame ORF epitopes, will facilitate selection of peptides for immune monitoring and vaccine development."
https://openalex.org/W3176005185,"Past human genetic diversity and migration between southern China and Southeast Asia have not been well characterized, in part due to poor preservation of ancient DNA in hot and humid regions. We sequenced 31 ancient genomes from southern China (Guangxi and Fujian), including two ∼12,000- to 10,000-year-old individuals representing the oldest humans sequenced from southern China. We discovered a deeply diverged East Asian ancestry in the Guangxi region that persisted until at least 6,000 years ago. We found that ∼9,000- to 6,000-year-old Guangxi populations were a mixture of local ancestry, southern ancestry previously sampled in Fujian, and deep Asian ancestry related to Southeast Asian Hòabìnhian hunter-gatherers, showing broad admixture in the region predating the appearance of farming. Historical Guangxi populations dating to ∼1,500 to 500 years ago are closely related to Tai-Kadai and Hmong-Mien speakers. Our results show heavy interactions among three distinct ancestries at the crossroads of East and Southeast Asia."
https://openalex.org/W3176104393,"Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) is widely expressed in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). As a dominant inhibitory immune checkpoint (ICP) receptor, cell surface PD-1 is well-known to transduce negative signaling of effector T cell activity during cell-cell contact. However, despite its well-documented inhibitory effects, higher PD-1 expression in TILs is significantly associated with longer survival in TNBC patients. This phenomenon raises an interesting question whether PD-1 harbors positive activity to enhance anti-tumor immunity. Here, we show that PD-1 is secreted in an exosomal form by activated T cells and can remotely interact with either cell surface or exosomal programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), induce PD-L1 internalization via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and thereby prevent subsequent cellular PD-L1: PD-1 interaction, restoring tumor surveillance through attenuating PD-L1-induced suppression of tumor-specific cytotoxic T cell activity. Our results, through revealing an anti-PD-L1 function of exosomal PD-1, provide a positive role to enhance cytotoxic T cell activity and a potential therapeutic strategy of modifying the exosome surface with membrane-bound inhibitory ICP receptors to attenuate the suppressive tumor immune microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W3175469396,"<h2>Summary</h2> Lateral intraparietal (LIP) neurons represent formation of perceptual decisions involving eye movements. In circuit models for these decisions, neural ensembles that encode actions compete to form decisions. Consequently, representation and readout of the decision variables (DVs) are implemented similarly for decisions with identical competing actions, irrespective of input and task context differences. Further, DVs are encoded as partially potentiated action plans through balance of activity of action-selective ensembles. Here, we test those core principles. We show that in a novel face-discrimination task, LIP firing rates decrease with supporting evidence, contrary to conventional motion-discrimination tasks. These opposite response patterns arise from similar mechanisms in which decisions form along curved population-response manifolds misaligned with action representations. These manifolds rotate in state space based on context, indicating distinct optimal readouts for different tasks. We show similar manifolds in lateral and medial prefrontal cortices, suggesting similar representational geometry across decision-making circuits."

Therefore, our findings suggest that disruption of astrocyte self-organization mechanisms could be an underlying cause of neural pathology. Astrocytes, a major glial cell type in the brain, form elaborately branched arbors to directly interact with many different cells and structures (Allen and Lyons, 2018Allen N.J. Lyons D.A. Glia as architects of central nervous system formation and function.Science. 2018; 362: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and control a wide variety of physiological processes that are fundamentally important for proper brain development and function, including synapse formation, regulation of neurotransmission, and establishment of the blood-brain barrier (Baldwin and Eroglu, 2017Baldwin K.T.

Despite these vital functions of astrocytes in the brain, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive the development of astrocyte morphological complexity and regulate astrocyte interactions with other cells are poorly understood. Furthermore, astrocyte dysfunction is implicated in many neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and schizophrenia (Blanco-Suarez et al., 2017Blanco-Suarez E. Caldwell A.L. Allen N.J.

Neurobiol. 2014; 27: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar); however, the extent to which disruptions to astrocyte development and function drive disease pathogenesis is unclear. Astrocytes establish distinct non-overlapping territories to tile the brain, an evolutionarily conserved phenomenon that is present from fruit flies to mammals (Bushong et al., 2002Bushong E.A.

The molecular mechanisms driving astrocyte tiling are unknown but may be mediated through contact inhibition via astrocyte-astrocyte interactions (Distler et al., 1991Distler C. Dreher Z. Stone J. Contact spacing among astrocytes in the central nervous system: an hypothesis of their structural role.Glia. 1991; 4: 484-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Astrocyte tiling is disrupted in disease states and following injury, suggesting that establishment of astrocytic domains is important for normal brain function (Myer et al., 2006Myer D.J. Gurkoff G.G. Lee S.M. Hovda D.A. Sofroniew M.V.

Astrocyte-astrocyte interactions also mediate astrocyte proliferation and maturation (Li et al., 2019Li J. Khankan R.R. Caneda C. Godoy M.I. Haney M.S. Krawczyk M.C. Bassik M.C. Sloan S.A. Zhang Y. Astrocyte-to-astrocyte contact and a positive feedback loop of growth factor signaling regulate astrocyte maturation.Glia. 2019; 67: 1571-1597PubMed Google Scholar) and cell-cell communication (Giaume et al., 2010Giaume C. Koulakoff A. Roux L. Holcman D. Rouach N. Astroglial networks: a step further in neuroglial and gliovascular interactions.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Astrocytes are extensively coupled through gap junctions, and disruptions to gap junction coupling are observed in many disease and injury states (Mayorquin et al., 2018Mayorquin L.C. Rodriguez A.V. Sutachan J.J. Albarracín S.L. Connexin-mediated functional and metabolic coupling between astrocytes and neurons.Front. Mol. Neurosci. 2018; 11: 118Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies suggest that the ability of astrocytes to balance discrete anatomical domains and a functionally coupled network is important for normal brain function. Astrocytes express cell adhesion molecules that may participate in cell-cell interactions (Zhang et al., 2016Zhang Y. Sloan S.A. Clarke L.E. Caneda C. Plaza C.A. Blumenthal P.D. Vogel H. Steinberg G.K. Edwards M.S. Li G. et al.Purification and characterization of progenitor and mature human astrocytes reveals transcriptional and functional differences with mouse.Neuron. 2016; 89: 37-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that astrocyte-expressed neuroligins mediate astrocyte-neuron interactions to synchronize astrocyte morphogenesis with synaptogenesis (Stogsdill et al., 2017Stogsdill J.A. Ramirez J. Liu D. Kim Y.H. Baldwin K.T. Enustun E. Ejikeme T. Ji R.R. Eroglu C. Astrocytic neuroligins control astrocyte morphogenesis and synaptogenesis.Nature. 2017; 551: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, how astrocytes coordinate their development with neighboring astrocytes and balance these contacts with synaptic contacts is unknown. We hypothesized that specific cell adhesion molecules expressed at astrocyte-astrocyte cell junctions might mediate interactions between neighboring astrocytes to regulate astrocyte development and function. Furthermore, we postulated that dysfunction of astrocytic cell adhesions could facilitate the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental brain disorders. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the function of hepatocyte cell adhesion molecule (hepaCAM) in astrocyte and brain development. HepaCAM, also known as GlialCAM, is an astrocyte-enriched cell adhesion molecule that was first identified in human cancer cell lines, participating in cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions to regulate cell migration and proliferation (Lee et al., 2009Lee L.H. Moh M.C. Zhang T. Shen S. The immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecule hepaCAM induces differentiation of human glioblastoma U373-MG cells.J. Cell.

Chem. 2005; 280: 27366-27374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In cultured astrocytes, hepaCAM forms homophilic cis and trans interactions to facilitate the targeting of transmembrane proteins to cell-cell junctions, including MLC1, a membrane protein of unknown function, and the chloride channel ClC-2, for which hepaCAM also serves as an auxiliary subunit (Capdevila-Nortes et al., 2015Capdevila-Nortes X.

Mutations to the extracellular domain (ECD) of hepaCAM cause megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC), a developmental and progressive brain disorder characterized by early-onset macrocephaly, white matter swelling, intellectual disability, and epilepsy (López-Hernández et al., 2011aLópez-Hernández T.

Despite the causal link between hepaCAM mutations and human neurological disorders, the function of hepaCAM in astrocytes during brain development remains poorly understood. In the mouse primary visual cortex (V1) at postnatal day 21 (P21), we found strong hepaCAM expression in astrocytes with concentrated expression at astrocyte-astrocyte contacts (Figures 1A and 1B ). HepaCAM protein expression is evident at P4 and increases during postnatal development (Figure 1C). To investigate the function of hepaCAM in astrocyte development, we used primary rat astrocyte and neuron co-cultures to examine astrocyte morphogenesis following knockdown of hepaCAM with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) (Figures 1D and S1A–S1D). Compared with astrocytes transfected with a scrambled shRNA control (shScr), hepaCAM knockdown (shHep) significantly reduced astrocyte branching complexity (Figures 1E and 1F) and astrocyte length (shScr versus shHep: 2,274.2 ± 44.2 versus 810.8 ± 41.5 μm; p < 0.0001). Additionally, the twisted and overlapping branches of hepaCAM-knockdown astrocytes presented a distinct phenotype from knockdown of astrocytic neuroligins (Stogsdill et al., 2017Stogsdill J.A. Ramirez J. Liu D. Kim Y.H. Baldwin K.T. Enustun E. Ejikeme T. Ji R.R. Eroglu C. Astrocytic neuroligins control astrocyte morphogenesis and synaptogenesis.Nature. 2017; 551: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) such as neuroligin 1 (NL1) (Figures S1E and S1F) and NL2 (Figures S1G and S1H). Moreover, the combined knockdown of NL2 and hepaCAM further reduced astrocyte complexity, suggesting that hepaCAM and NL2 regulate astrocyte morphogenesis through independent pathways (Figures S1G and S1H). Neuroligins mediate astrocyte arborization in response to neuronal contact via interactions with neuronal neurexins (Stogsdill et al., 2017Stogsdill J.A. Ramirez J. Liu D. Kim Y.H. Baldwin K.T. Enustun E. Ejikeme T. Ji R.R. Eroglu C. Astrocytic neuroligins control astrocyte morphogenesis and synaptogenesis.Nature. 2017; 551: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In cultured cells, hepaCAM forms homophilic trans interactions at cell-cell junctions (Capdevila-Nortes et al., 2015Capdevila-Nortes X. Jeworutzki E. Elorza-Vidal X. Barrallo-Gimeno A. Pusch M. Estévez R. Structural determinants of interaction, trafficking and function in the ClC-2/MLC1 subunit GlialCAM involved in leukodystrophy.J. Physiol. 2015; 593: 4165-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Although hepaCAM is highly enriched in astrocytes, neurons express detectable amounts of hepaCAM mRNA (Zhang et al., 2014Zhang Y. Chen K. Sloan S.A. Bennett M.L. Scholze A.R. O’Keeffe S. Phatnani H.P. Guarnieri P. Caneda C. Ruderisch N. et al.An RNA-sequencing transcriptome and splicing database of glia, neurons, and vascular cells of the cerebral cortex.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 11929-11947Crossref PubMed Scopus (2708) Google Scholar). To test whether hepaCAM controls astrocyte morphology via homophilic interactions between astrocytes and neurons, we silenced hepaCAM expression only in neurons and found that neuronal contact-induced astrocyte morphogenesis was not altered, suggesting that astrocytic hepaCAM controls astrocyte morphogenesis in a cell-autonomous manner (Figures S1I–S1K). To determine whether hepaCAM regulates astrocyte morphogenesis in vivo, we used postnatal astrocyte labeling by electroporation (PALE) combined with the PiggyBac transposon system (Chen et al., 2014Chen F. Maher B.J. LoTurco J.J. piggyBac transposon-mediated cellular transgenesis in mammalian forebrain by in utero electroporation.Cold Spring Harb. Protoc. 2014; 2014: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) to introduce shRNA and a membrane-targeted mCherry (mCherry-CAAX) into a sparse population of astrocytes in the mouse cortex at P0 (Figures 1G and 1H). At P7, we found that layer 5 (L5) astrocytes expressing shHep had a significantly smaller territory volume compared with shScr astrocytes (Figures 1I and 1K). At P21, following a period of astrocyte growth and extensive elaboration, the territory volume of shHep astrocytes remained significantly smaller than shScr astrocytes (Figures 1J and 1L). The infiltration of fine astrocyte processes into the neuropil (neuropil infiltration volume [NIV]) was unchanged at P21 (Figures 1M–1O). Taken together, these results show that hepaCAM is required for proper astrocyte territory growth and morphogenesis in the developing mouse cortex. To investigate the molecular mechanisms through which hepaCAM regulates astrocyte morphogenesis, we performed rescue experiments in vitro by expressing mutated versions of an shRNA-resistant human hepaCAM protein with a C-terminal FLAG tag (Figure 2A). Co-expression of wild-type (WT) human hepaCAM with shHep fully rescued astrocyte morphological complexity (Figures 2B and 2C), whereas expression of hepaCAM lacking its intracellular domain (ICD) (ΔC) did not (Figures 2D and 2F). Additionally, expression of WT hepaCAM caused a noticeable straightening of branches not observed in control conditions or with expression of hepaCAM ΔC. Replacing the ECD of hepaCAM with the ECD of the human IL-2 receptor (ΔN) disrupts hepaCAM-mediated cis and trans interactions in vitro (Capdevila-Nortes et al., 2015Capdevila-Nortes X. Jeworutzki E. Elorza-Vidal X. Barrallo-Gimeno A. Pusch M. Estévez R. Structural determinants of interaction, trafficking and function in the ClC-2/MLC1 subunit GlialCAM involved in leukodystrophy.J. Physiol. 2015; 593: 4165-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Co-expression of hepaCAM ΔN with shHep was unable to rescue astrocyte morphological complexity (Figures 2E and 2F), indicating that interactions mediated by the hepaCAM ECD are necessary for proper astrocyte morphogenesis. Furthermore, overexpression (OE) of hepaCAM ΔN with shScr significantly reduced astrocyte complexity, indicating that the ICD of hepaCAM, when uncoupled from its ECD, may have a dominant-negative function (Figures 2E and 2F). Collectively, these results demonstrate that both the intracellular and ECDs of hepaCAM are necessary for proper astrocyte morphogenesis and suggest that hepaCAM regulates astrocyte morphogenesis in vitro by coupling cell adhesion to intracellular signaling mechanisms. Single amino acid substitutions in the extracellular IgV domain of hepaCAM cause MLC in humans (López-Hernández et al., 2011aLópez-Hernández T. Ridder M.C. Montolio M. Capdevila-Nortes X. Polder E. Sirisi S. Duarri A. Schulte U. Fakler B. Nunes V. et al.Mutant GlialCAM causes megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts, benign familial macrocephaly, and macrocephaly with retardation and autism.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2011; 88: 422-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To determine whether disease-causing mutations to hepaCAM impair astrocyte morphogenesis in vitro, we transfected astrocytes with mutant versions of hepaCAM carrying either a dominant (G89S) (Figure 2G) or recessive (R92Q) (Figure 2H) MLC-causing mutation. Both of these mutations impair hepaCAM cis dimerization and localization of hepaCAM to cell-cell junctions (Elorza-Vidal et al., 2020Elorza-Vidal X. Xicoy-Espaulella E. Pla-Casillanis A. Alonso-Gardón M. Gaitán-Peñas H. Engel-Pizcueta C. Fernández-Recio J. Estévez R. Structural basis for the dominant or recessive character of GLIALCAM mutations found in leukodystrophies.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2020; 29: 1107-1120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In astrocytes co-cultured with neurons, hepaCAM mutants were expressed broadly throughout the cell (Figures 2G and 2H), in contrast to the restricted distribution of WT and endogenous hepaCAM (Figure 2B), suggesting that these mutations cause a loss of specific targeting and/or retention at cell-cell junctions. OE of hepaCAM disease mutants (DM) in shScr or shHep astrocytes significantly reduced astrocyte branching complexity (Figure 2I) and substantially altered astrocyte branching organization, causing individual astrocytes to branch onto themselves and form web-like structures (Figures 2G and 2H). These results show that disease-causing mutations in hepaCAM impair astrocyte morphogenesis in a dominant-negative fashion in vitro and suggest that hepaCAM cis interaction and proper hepaCAM localization are required for astrocyte morphogenesis. Previous studies found that hepaCAM is required to localize transmembrane proteins ClC-2 and MLC1 to cell-cell junctions (Capdevila-Nortes et al., 2013Capdevila-Nortes X. López-Hernández T.

Recently hepaCAM was also found to be important for stabilizing the gap junction protein connexin 43 (Cx43) at cell-cell junctions in vitro (Wu et al., 2016Wu M. Moh M.C. Schwarz H. HepaCAM associates with connexin 43 and enhances its localization in cellular junctions.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 36218Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), a finding which we confirmed in astrocyte-only cultures from Hepacam-knockout (KO) mice (Figure S2A). Cx43 forms gap junction channels between neighboring astrocytes, allowing the exchange of ions and small molecules (Figure 3A). Independently of channel activity, connexins also function as cell adhesion molecules to control cell-cell interactions and cell migration (Elias et al., 2007Elias L.A. Wang D.D. Kriegstein A.R. Gap junction adhesion is necessary for radial migration in the neocortex.Nature. 2007; 448: 901-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar; Pannasch et al., 2014Pannasch U. Freche D. Dallérac G.

The immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecule hepaCAM modulates cell adhesion and motility through direct interaction with the actin cytoskeleton.J. Cell. Physiol. 2009; 219: 382-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Given the overlapping functions of hepaCAM and Cx43, we wondered whether these two molecules might work together in regulating astrocyte morphogenesis. Using stimulated emission depletion (STED) and confocal microscopy, we found that hepaCAM and Cx43 frequently co-localized at astrocyte processes in the mouse cortex (Figures 3B, S2B, and S2C). To determine whether hepaCAM and Cx43 interact in the mouse brain, we performed native affinity purifications followed by liquid chromatography-coupled high-resolution mass spectrometry (AP-MS) with two different hepaCAM antibodies and observed co-immunoprecipitation between hepaCAM and Cx43 (Figures S2D and S2E). To probe the functional relationship between hepaCAM and Cx43 in regulating astrocyte morphogenesis, we used an shRNA to knockdown Cx43 (shCx43) in vitro and in vivo (Figures S3A and S3B). In astrocytes co-cultured with neurons, Cx43 knockdown significantly reduced astrocyte morphological complexity similar to hepaCAM knockdown, and the combined knockdown of hepaCAM and Cx43 (shHep + shCx43) did not further reduce astrocyte complexity (Figures 3C and 3D), suggesting that hepaCAM and Cx43 function in the same pathway to regulate astrocyte morphogenesis in vitro. Next, we used PALE combined with the PiggyBac transposon system to knockdown Cx43 in sparse populations of astrocytes in the developing mouse visual cortex. Similar to hepaCAM knockdown, shCx43 astrocytes had a significantly smaller territory volume at P7 (Figures 3E and 3F). At P21, both the territory volume and NIV of shCx43 astrocytes were significantly reduced (Figures 3G–3J), showing that Cx43 knockdown impairs astrocyte morphogenesis in vivo. Because membrane localization of Cx43 was disrupted in astrocyte cultures from Hepacam KO mice (Figure S2A), we hypothesized that hepaCAM might regulate astrocyte morphogenesis by controlling the localization and/or stability of Cx43. To test this, we attempted to rescue the morphology of shHep astrocytes by introducing different shRNA-resistant Cx43 mutant constructs (Figure 4A). WT Cx43 with a C-terminal Myc tag (Cx43-WT) significantly increased the complexity and total process length of astrocytes transfected with shCx43 (Figures S3C–S3E) yet was unable to rescue the complexity of shHep astrocytes (Figures 4B and 4C). Cx43 is a dynamically regulated protein with a half-life of less than 2 h (Beardslee et al., 1998Beardslee M.A. Laing J.G. Beyer E.C. Saffitz J.E. Rapid turnover of connexin43 in the adult rat heart.Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). To test whether stabilizing Cx43 at the membrane could overcome the requirement for hepaCAM and rescue astrocyte morphological complexity, we used previously described Cx43 mutations to disrupt endocytosis, Cx43-Y286A/V289D (Cx43-YA/VD) (Johnson et al., 2013Johnson K.E. Mitra S. Katoch P. Kelsey L.S. Johnson K.R. Mehta P.P. Phosphorylation on Ser-279 and Ser-282 of connexin43 regulates endocytosis and gap junction assembly in pancreatic cancer cells.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2013; 24: 715-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar; Figure 4A). Similar to Cx43-WT, Cx43-YA/VD significantly increased the complexity of shCx43 astrocytes (Figures S3G and S3J) but failed to increase the complexity of shHep astrocytes (Figures 4B and 4C). A previous study suggested that Cx43 OE may produce unwanted side effects due to excess channel function and that Cx43 may also have channel-independent adhesive functions (Elias et al., 2007Elias L.A. Wang D.D. Kriegstein A.R. Gap junction adhesion is necessary for radial migration in the neocortex.Nature. 2007; 448: 901-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). To test whether inhibiting channel function might enable endocytosis-deficient Cx43 to exert its adhesive properties while avoiding potential toxicity due to excess channel function, we generated Cx43-TY (Figure 4A), which lacks both the endocytosis motif and the previously characterized T154A mutation that blocks channel function (Beahm et al., 2006Beahm D.L. Oshima A. Gaietta G.M. Hand G.M. Smock A.E. Zucker S.N. Toloue M.M. Chandrasekhar A. Nicholson B.J. Sosinsky G.E.

Chem. 2006; 281: 7994-8009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Both Cx43-T154A and Cx43-TY rescued the complexity of shCx43 astrocytes (Figures S3F, S3H, S3J, and S3K), indicating that channel function is not required for Cx43-mediated control of astrocyte morphogenesis. In contrast to the punctate expression of Cx43-WT and Cx43-YA/VD in astrocytes co-cultured with neurons, Cx43-T154A and Cx43-TY were distributed throughout the cell (Figure S3L). The T154A mutation was previously shown to increase the invasive properties of human metastatic melanoma cells (Zucker et al., 2013Zucker S.N. Bancroft T.A. Place D.E. Des Soye B. Bagati A. Berezney R. A dominant negative Cx43 mutant differentially affects tumorigenic and invasive properties in human metastatic melanoma cells.J. Cell. Physiol. 2013; 228: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, in addition to blocking channel function, the T154A mutation may also enhance adhesive function of Cx43. Expression of Cx43-TY in shHep astrocytes fully restored the morphological complexity of shHep astrocytes to control levels, whereas the T154A mutant alone did not (Figures 4B and 4C), indicating that stabilizing Cx43 at the membrane, in the absence of Cx43 channel activity, is able to overcome loss of hepaCAM with respect to astrocyte morphogenesis. This effect was specific to hepaCAM and not due to a general increase in astrocyte adhesion, as Cx43-TY did not rescue astrocyte morphological complexity in shNL2 astrocytes (Figures S3M and S3N). To determine whether Cx43-TY could rescue astrocyte morphogenesis in hepaCAM-knockdown astrocytes in vivo, we performed PALE to express shRNA, mCherry-CAAX, and Cx43-TY (Figure 4D). Indeed, expression of Cx43-TY in shHep astrocytes rescued astrocyte territory volume to shScr control levels (Figures 4D and 4E). Collectively, these experiments reveal hepaCAM and Cx43 as important regulators o"
https://openalex.org/W3177132078,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability characterized by persistent impairments in social interaction, speech and nonverbal communication, and restricted or repetitive behaviors. Currently Electroencephalography (EEG) is the most popular tool to inspect the existence of neurological disorders like autism biomarkers due to its low setup cost, high temporal resolution and wide availability. Generally, EEG recordings produce vast amount of data with dynamic behavior, which are visually analyzed by professional clinician to detect autism. It is laborious, expensive, subjective, error prone and has reliability issue. Therefor this study intends to develop an efficient diagnostic framework based on time-frequency spectrogram images of EEG signals to automatically identify ASD. In the proposed system, primarily, the raw EEG signals are pre-processed using re-referencing, filtering and normalization. Then, Short-Time Fourier Transform is used to transform the pre-processed signals into two-dimensional spectrogram images. Afterward those images are evaluated by machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, separately. In the ML process, textural features are extracted, and significant features are selected using principal component analysis, and feed them to six different ML classifiers for classification. In the DL process, three different convolutional neural network models are tested. The proposed DL based model achieves higher accuracy (99.15%) compared to the ML based model (95.25%) on an ASD EEG dataset and also outperforms existing methods. The findings of this study suggest that the DL based structure could discover important biomarkers for efficient and automatic diagnosis of ASD from EEG and may assist to develop computer-aided diagnosis system."
https://openalex.org/W3176565698,"<h2>Summary</h2> To navigate social environments, people must simultaneously hold representations about their own and others' abilities. During self-other mergence, people estimate others' abilities not only on the basis of the others' past performance, but the estimates are also influenced by their own performance. For example, if we perform well, we overestimate the abilities of those with whom we are co-operating and underestimate competitors. Self-other mergence is associated with specific activity patterns in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Using a combination of non-invasive brain stimulation, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and computational modeling, we show that dmPFC neurostimulation silences these neural signatures of self-other mergence in relation to estimation of others' abilities. In consequence, self-other mergence behavior increases, and our assessments of our own performance are projected increasingly onto other people. This suggests an inherent tendency to form interdependent social representations and a causal role of the dmPFC in separating self and other representations."

Abnormalities in self-reported interoception are prevalent features of major depressive disorder (MDD) and may affect treatment outcomes. In the present study, we investigated the psychometric properties of the revised eight-dimensional and 37-item Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness questionnaire (the MAIA-2) in a severely depressed sample, after translating two updated scales (Not-Distracting, Not-Worrying) into German. Specifically, we examined the measure’s internal consistency reliability, sensitivity to change, and minimal important differences (MID) with a focus on patient’s antidepressive responses to treatment. Methods The study enrolled 110 participants (age: M = 46.85, SD = 11.23; female: 55.45%) undergoing hospital treatment, of whom 87 were included in the pre-post analysis. Participants completed a German translation of MAIA-2 and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (pre-/post-treatment). Internal consistency reliability was determined by Cronbach’s α /McDonalds’s ω , sensitivity to change was determined by effect sizes, and MIDs were determined by distribution- (0.5* SD ) and anchor-based approaches (mean change method; ROC curve cut-points). Results Depression severity reduced over the course of treatment (Median = -65.22%), and 34.48% of patients achieved remission. Reliability was appropriate for post-treatment (range of ω : .70-.90), but questionable for two pre-treatment scales (Noticing: ω = .64; Not-Distracting: ω = .66). The eight dimensions of MAIA-2 were sensitive to change (standardized response mean: .32-.81; Cohen’s effect size: .30-.92). Distribution-based MIDs (.38-.61) and anchor-based mean change MIDs (remission vs. partial response: .00-.85; partial response vs. nonresponse: .08-.88) were established on the group level. For six scales, ROC cut-points (remission: .00–1.33; response: -.20–1.00) demonstrated accurate classification to treatment response groups on the individual level. Conclusions This study demonstrated the applicability of the MAIA-2 questionnaire in MDD. The updated version may have led to reliability improvements regarding the revised scales, but subthreshold reliability was evident prior to treatment. The measure’s dimensions were sensitive to change. MIDs were established that corresponded with antidepressive treatment outcomes. Our findings are consistent with a growing area of research which considers somatic feelings as key contributors to mental health."

Taken together, G4 structures are linked to each of the major toxicities observed in C9 FTD/ALS patient neurons. The underlying pathogenesis of the G4C2 HRE involves at least three inter-related pathways, each of which is foundationally linked to aberrant G4 structures. The G4C2 HRE as DNA impairs mRNA transcription and alters the epigenetics of the C9orf72 locus, decreasing C9orf72 protein expression (25Shi Y. Lin S. Staats K.A. Li Y. Chang W.H. Hung S.T.

Moreover, DHX36 plays an active role in SG dynamics, where its loss can trigger spontaneous formation of SGs and changes in their dissolution after a transient stress exposure (53Sauer M.

DHX36 prevents the accumulation of translationally inactive mRNAs with G4-structures in untranslated regions.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, DHX36 has the potential to influence C9orf72 transcription and G4C2-repeat RNA stability, localization, and RAN translation (23Huppert J.L. Balasubramanian S. G-quadruplexes in promoters throughout the human genome.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 406-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar, 44Huang W. Smaldino P.J. Zhang Q. Miller L.D. Cao P.

Here, we find that DHX36 knockdown (KD) and KO selectively suppresses C9RAN translation as well as RAN translation at CGG repeats from reporters in human cells. In contrast, overexpression of WT DHX36, but not a mutant form of DHX36 that lacks helicase activity, enhances RAN translation. These effects are largely translational as we observe suppression of C9RAN translation in an in vitro DHX36 KO cell lysate translation system while observing no significant alterations in reporter RNA in response to KD or overexpression of DHX36. Loss of DHX36 also precludes stress-dependent upregulation of C9RAN translation consistent with its role in SG formation. Taken together, these results suggest modulation of G4 structures at the RNA level by candidate G4 helicases such as DHX36 impact G4C2-repeat expansion translation implicated in C9 FTD/ALS. To determine if DHX36 directly binds to C9 G4 DNA structures, we performed EMSAs with a DNA oligonucleotide composed of five G4C2 repeats with a 3′ unstructured tail shown to be required for G4 binding (47Smaldino P.J.

https://openalex.org/W3173353176,"Introduction During public health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, populations can experience worsening mental health. Prior reports have suggested that Black Americans experienced lower rates of anxiety and depression than White Americans before the pandemic; however, during the pandemic, outcomes may be different as Black Americans have been disproportionately affected in terms of mortality, hospitalization, COVID-19 infection, and job loss. We documented the differential mental health impact of COVID-19 on Black and Non-Black Americans. Methods We analyzed nationally representative longitudinal data from the Understanding America Study COVID-19 Tracking Survey spanning March through November of 2020 to assess differences over time in prevalence of anxiety and depression between Black and non-Black Americans. Results We found that Black Americans were significantly less likely to report symptoms for anxiety, depression, or both during the pandemic. In a given month between March through November of 2020, the odds of Black Americans reporting such symptoms was on average about half that of Non-Black Americans. We also found that in September 2020, the gap in reporting symptoms for depression began to widen gradually. Specifically, since that time, prevalence of depression remained stable among non-Black Americans while it declined gradually among Black Americans. Our main results were robust to adjusting for demographics, risk perceptions, and baseline pre-pandemic mental health status. Conclusions Black Americans maintained significantly better mental health than Non-Black Americans despite their struggle against economic, health, and racial inequalities during the pandemic. We discuss the significance and implications of our results and identify opportunities for future research."

These findings demonstrate the distinct roles of PFC sub-regions in goal-directed behavior and illuminate the candidate neurobehavioral substrates of psychiatric disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder. In everyday life, we continually make decisions based on our goals or go on “autopilot” to get through the day. Normal behaviors can either be goal directed, when performing an action to obtain a specific goal, or habitual, when a stimulus can trigger a well-learned response, regardless of its consequences. The goal-directed system is needed to adapt and remain flexible to changing environments and goals, whereas the habit system reduces cognitive load. However, an excessively dominant habit system can be maladaptive in some circumstances. Problems in the coordination and competition between the goal-directed and habitual systems are seen both in health (Balleine and O’Doherty, 2010Balleine B.W. O’Doherty J.P.

Thus, understanding the neurobiological basis of goal-directed behaviors will provide insight into the etiology of such disorders. To choose optimally, one needs to predict or believe that one’s action will cause the desired outcome (de Wit and Dickinson, 2009de Wit S. Dickinson A.

Whether an outcome (O) is contingent upon an action (A) depends not only on the probability (P) of the outcome occurring following the action (P(A|O)) but also on the probability of the outcome occurring in the absence of that action (P (A|¬O)). One’s sensitivity to changes in action-outcome (A-O) contingencies can be measured using a test of contingency degradation (Balleine and Dickinson, 1998Balleine B.W. Dickinson A.

Persistent responding following degradation of A-O contingencies implies residual habitual control (Balleine and O’Doherty, 2010Balleine B.W. O’Doherty J.P. Human and rodent homologies in action control: corticostriatal determinants of goal-directed and habitual action.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2010; 35: 48-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). Contingency degradation assesses beliefs about the causal nature of contingencies and complements the use of “outcome devaluation” (which tests whether the desire for a goal drives actions) to measure goal-directed behavior (Heyes and Dickinson, 1990Heyes C.

Evidence from human, non-human primate, and rodent studies has identified candidate neural systems for goal-directed behavior in mediating A-O contingencies within sub-regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), including ventromedial PFC (vmPFC), medial PFC (mPFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), as well as the caudate nucleus subcortically (reviewed in Balleine and O’Doherty, 2010Balleine B.W.

In human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, sectors of vmPFC and anterior caudate were more active when subjects’ actions were highly predictive of the outcome than when their actions did not predict the outcome well (i.e., relating to P(A|O)) (Liljeholm et al., 2011Liljeholm M.

Studies of humans with vmPFC damage reveal intact learning of A-O contingencies but reduced awareness of such relationships under certain conditions (O’Callaghan et al., 2019O’Callaghan C. Vaghi M.M.

The vmPFC, however, is a large, heterogeneous region (Roberts and Clarke, 2019Roberts A.C. Clarke H.F. Why we need nonhuman primates to study the role of ventromedial prefrontal cortex in the regulation of threat- and reward-elicited responses.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116: 26297-26304Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar) comprising cytoarchitectonically (and likely functionally) distinct regions that cannot easily be resolved with fMRI and cannot be distinguished in human lesion studies. Localized intervention studies in non-human animals have shed light on the causal role of PFC sub-regions in goal-directed actions. In non-human primates, non-specific ablations of dorsal ACC in macaques impaired their ability to adapt their actions to changes in outcome probabilities (Chudasama et al., 2013Chudasama Y. Daniels T.E. Gorrin D.P. Rhodes S.E. Rudebeck P.H. Murray E.A. The role of the anterior cingulate cortex in choices based on reward value and reward contingency.Cereb.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 13775-13785Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). More selective excitotoxic lesions of area 32 (mPFC) or area 11 (anterior OFC [antOFC]) in marmosets impaired the initial acquisition of A-O contingencies, reflected in their subsequent insensitivity to contingency degradation (Jackson et al., 2016Jackson S.A. Horst N.K. Pears A. Robbins T.W. Roberts A.C. Role of the Perigenual Anterior Cingulate and Orbitofrontal Cortex in Contingency Learning in the Marmoset.Cereb. Cortex. 2016; 26: 3273-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Similar insensitivity has been described in rats with excitotoxic lesions of the prelimbic cortex (PL; variously labeled mPFC/vmPFC), lateral OFC, and the posterior dorsomedial striatum (DMS) (Balleine and Dickinson, 1998Balleine B.W.

In contrast, anterior medial OFC lesions had no effect on this task, while affecting outcome devaluation (Bradfield et al., 2015Bradfield L.A. Dezfouli A. van Holstein M. Chieng B. Balleine B.W.

Thus, while it is clear that altered activity across a number of regions within prefrontal and cingulate cortices in humans and non-human animals can affect goal-directed behavior, differences in the test paradigms used and the extent of cross-species homology in prefrontal function hamper translation of the findings (Laubach et al., 2018Laubach M.

Prefrontal Regulation of Threat-Elicited Behaviors: A Pathway to Translation.Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2020; 71: 357-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). For example, recent studies of vmPFC function in marmosets have highlighted functional discrepancies between this region in rodents versus primates (Roberts and Clarke, 2019Roberts A.C. Clarke H.F. Why we need nonhuman primates to study the role of ventromedial prefrontal cortex in the regulation of threat- and reward-elicited responses.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Consequently, the present study provides a comprehensive comparison of the causal contribution of perigenual ACC, vmPFC, and OFC to goal-directed behavior, as measured by the sensitivity to contingency degradation in a New World primate, the common marmoset. The structural organization of the marmoset PFC bears a greater resemblance to that of humans than to rodents (Burman and Rosa, 2009Burman K.J. Rosa M.G.

Neurol. 2013; 521: 4189-4204Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and hence provides an important bridge between rodent and human studies. Moreover, the animal studies cited above mainly used contingency degradation to assess whether initial learning was goal directed or habit based, but not the subjects’ ability to respond to changes in A-O contingencies in established goal-directed behavior. We modified the classic rodent task (Balleine and Dickinson, 1998Balleine B.W. Dickinson A. Goal-directed instrumental action: contingency and incentive learning and their cortical substrates.Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 407-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar) and used a within-subjects design to ensure that animals were already exhibiting goal-directed actions before repeated acute manipulations in distinct brain regions. We examined the contribution of five prefrontal and cingulate sub-regions: areas 32 (mPFC), 24 (perigenual ACC), the boundary between areas 14 and 25 (area 14-25; caudal vmPFC), 11 (antOFC), and 14 (rostral vmPFC/mOFC) using temporary pharmacological inactivation via local microinfusion of a combination of a GABAA agonist (muscimol) and a GABAB agonist (baclofen) (mus/bac). As inactivation of pre-genual area 24 disrupted the sensitivity to contingency degradation and this region sends dense projections into the anteromedial caudate nucleus, we inactivated the caudate, using the glutamate receptor antagonist CNQX. Because positron emission tomography (PET) and resting-state fMRI have revealed OFC and ACC to be overactive in OCD patients, which may underlie the deficits in goal-directed behavior seen in this disorder (Robbins et al., 2019Robbins T.W. Vaghi M.M. Banca P. Obsessive-compulsive disorder: puzzles and prospects.Neuron. 2019; 102: 27-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), including impaired knowledge of A-O contingencies in contingency degradation (Vaghi et al., 2019Vaghi M.M. Cardinal R.N. Apergis-Schoute A.M. Fineberg N.A. Sule A. Robbins T.W. Action-Outcome Knowledge Dissociates From Behavior in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Following Contingency Degradation.Biol. Psychiatry Cogn. Neurosci. Neuroimaging. 2019; 4: 200-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), we also determined the effects of the overactivation of prefrontal areas in marmosets. We achieved this via a glutamate reuptake inhibitor, dihydrokainic acid (DHK), which increases the extracellular levels of glutamate and enhances the excitability of cortical areas (Alexander et al., 2019Alexander L. Gaskin P.L.R. Sawiak S.J. Fryer T.D. Hong Y.T. Cockcroft G.J. Clarke H.F. Roberts A.C.

We define this operationally as overactivation because of the increased excitability and evidence of enhanced post-synaptic action of synaptically released glutamate by DHK (Muñoz et al., 1987Muñoz M.D. Herreras O.

Before the intra-cerebral infusions, we established that marmosets behaved in a goal-directed manner (Figure 1A). Marmosets were trained to associate each of two actions with a different outcome (juice rewards; Figure 1B; Table S1). The contingency degradation task was divided into 4-day blocks of test sessions. On weeks when there were no degradation probe sessions, animals received baseline control sessions across the 4 days. On weeks when there were degradation probe sessions (a minimum of every other week but often less frequently than that), the first 2 days were control sessions in which animals responded under a variable ratio schedule separately on independent sessions for each of the two rewards (degraded control or nondegraded control). Days 3 and 4 were contingency degradation probe sessions in which the A-O contingencies were modified such that one of the action-reward associations was degraded, whereas the other one was not (degraded probe or non-degraded probe). The marmosets were considered to behave in a goal-directed manner if they reduced their responding following the degradation of one of the A-O associations (i.e., when the juice reward was provided “freely” without the requirement of an instrumental response, and the response-contingent juice reward was the same juice) compared with when it was not degraded (i.e., when “free” and response-contingent rewards were different; Figure 1D). Importantly, marmosets only altered their responding when the A-O associations were degraded (same juice reward presented freely) when compared with sessions in which there were no free rewards (Figure 1D). Together, these results indicated that the reduction in responding was not simply due to the presence of free rewards (nor juice preference or availability of a variety of juices), but because of the weakening of perceived causality between a specific action and outcome. We also provide in Figure S1 time courses of response rates over the sessions (same sessions as presented in Figure 1D) that show an accelerated decline in response rate relatively early in the session, in the degraded condition only. Inspection of individual curves in these sessions shows that the response rates of the animals, while individually variable, nevertheless conform to the general pattern seen in the group data. To quantify sensitivity to contingency degradation, we defined a contingency degradation index (CDI) that took into account the marked individual variability in response rates shown by marmosets (e.g., see Figures 1D and S1). The CDI was defined as the percentage of response rates in degradation probe sessions compared to control sessions and is used as the main behavioral measure in subsequent analysis (Figure 1E; see STAR Methods). A CDI significantly lower in the degraded session than in the non-degraded session was taken as an indication of goal-directed behavior. Marmosets (n = 10) then received drug manipulations in their respective cannulated brain regions (Table 1; see Table S2 for drugs and Table S3 for order of infusions) as depicted in Figure 2 (see Table S4 for cannulation coordinates).Table 1Cannulation locations for each marmoset.SubjectSymbolArea 11, n = 4Area 24, n = 4Area 14-25a, n = 3Area 32, n = 5bArea 14a, n = 5bCaudate nucleus, n = 5bM1•√ (12)–––––M2▪√ (12)√ (12)√ (12)–––M3▴√ (8)√ (12)√ (12)–––M4♦√ (12)√ (12)√ (12)–––M5⬣–√ (12)––––M6○–––√ (12)√ (12)√ (8)M7□–––√ (12)√ (12)√ (8)M8▵–––√ (12)√ (8)√ (0)M9⋄–––√ (12)√ (12)√ (8)M10⎔––√ (0)√ (0)√ (8)M, monkey.

Three-way ANOVA of the CDI in cohort 1 (areas 24, 14-25, 11) revealed a significant three-way interaction between treatment, degradation, and region (F4,41.8 = 5.3, p = 0.0016), which indicated that subsequent post hoc treatment × degradation effects for areas 24 and 11 were regionally specific (see Figure 3). This was further confirmed by permutation tests, (p = 0.002, 999 permutations). There was no such three-way interaction (F < 0.13, p = 0.88) for the second cohort of animals (areas 14 and 32, excluding caudate nucleus), also shown in Figure 3, and no effects of treatment or region on the degradation effect (F2,31.05 = 1.44, p = 0.25; F1,31.05 = 0.13, p = 0.72, respectively). However, there was a significant degradation effect (F1,30.99 = 17.81, p = 0.0002), a result also confirmed by a permutation test (p = 0.00008 with 50,000 permutations). There was no significant region × degradation interaction when comparing only the saline infusions across all brain regions (region × degradation: F5,25.245 = 0.122, p = 0.986). Following either inactivation or overactivation of area 24, the actions of marmosets were insensitive to degradation in A-O contingency (Figure 3A). Marmosets no longer distinguished between a reward that could only be obtained by performing an action (as in the non-degraded session) and one that could be obtained with or without an action (as in the degraded session). Their responding was the same regardless of whether the reward could be obtained freely. Although both inactivation and overactivation of area 24 blunted the sensitivity of marmosets to contingency degradation, their effects on responding differed: only the effects of inactivation were specific to contingency degradation. Overactivation of area 24 made the marmosets respond less, regardless of whether the A-O contingencies were degraded; this was likely due to DHK effects non-specific to contingency degradation, as such effects were also seen in baseline sessions in which no free reward was given (see STAR Methods for descriptions of baseline sessions and Figure 5A ).Figure 5Effects of area 24 and 14 overactivation on baseline sessionsShow full caption(A) Overactivation of area 24 significantly affected responding compared to other manipulations (treatment: F2,10 = 14.846, p = 0.00102), where it significantly decreased responding across juice 1 and 2 when compared to inactivation (p = 0.00210) or saline (p = 0.00220).(B) Area 14 overactivation significantly affected responding in different juice conditions (juice condition × treatment: F2,12.812 = 6.358, p = 0.0121); overactivation specifically decreased responding to juice 2, which is the contingent reward in the non-degraded session in the contingency degradation task, compared to juice 1, which is the contingent reward in the degraded session in the contingency degradation task (p = 0.0038). Responding to juice 2 after overactivation was significantly lower than that following saline (p = 0.0202) or inactivation (p = 0.0232). Conversely, responding to juice 1 after overactivation was not significantly lower than that of saline (p = 0.330) or inactivation (p = 0.556).

The paradigm drift of studies into foreign aid and sustainable economic growth has shown conflicting results that play on researchers to fill the gap of knowledge void. The plurality of studies looked at economic growth and foreign aid in single countries. However, one of the major determinants of sustainable growth such as CO2 emissions and trade goes beyond the boundaries of a country. Deductively, grouped countries or sub-regional studies are needed to ascertain the heterogeneous relationship and cross-sectional dependency among panels grouping. We fill these gaps with the recent empirical methodology to unveil the impact of foreign aid, CO2 emissions, trade openness, and energy consumption on economic growth. Thus a percentage rise in foreign aid corresponds to different significant weights in all panel groupings with exception of Southern African Development Community, which unveiled a non-significant estimate. Whereas trade openness in all panel grouping indicated a significant weight on economic growth. An increase in CO2 emissions has a significant material effect on economic growth in Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, Economic Community of West African States, and Community of Sahel-Saharan States. The impact of energy consumption on economic growth across the panel groupings was statistically significant with Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa having the highest weight impact. These results obtained in this study indicate that foreign aid, energy consumption, trade openness, and CO2 emissions are positively correlated with economic growth. Based on the finding, the significant of the policy implications suggested. (a) The need for a paradigm shift from fossil fuel sources to renewables is encouraged in the various trading blocs (b) The need to embrace carbon storage and capturing techniques to decouple pollutant emissions from economic growth on the continent's growth trajectory."
https://openalex.org/W3173710465,"The thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCC) in the renal distal convoluted tubule (DCT) plays a critical role in regulating blood pressure (BP) and K+ homeostasis. During hyperkalemia, reduced NCC phosphorylation and total NCC abundance facilitate downstream electrogenic K+ secretion and BP reduction. However, the mechanism for the K+-dependent reduction in total NCC levels is unknown. Here, we show that NCC levels were reduced in ex vivo renal tubules incubated in a high-K+ medium for 24-48 h. This reduction was independent of NCC transcription, but was prevented using inhibitors of the proteasome (MG132) or lysosome (chloroquine). Ex vivo, high K+ increased NCC ubiquitylation, but inhibition of the ubiquitin conjugation pathway prevented the high K+-mediated reduction in NCC protein. In tubules incubated in high K+ media ex vivo or in the renal cortex of mice fed a high K+ diet for 4 days, the abundance and phosphorylation of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), a key regulator of ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation and protein folding, were decreased. Conversely, in similar samples the expression of PP1α, known to dephosphorylate Hsp70, was also increased. NCC coimmunoprecipitated with Hsp70 and PP1α, and inhibiting their actions prevented the high K+-mediated reduction in total NCC levels. In conclusion, we show that hyperkalemia drives NCC ubiquitylation and degradation via a PP1α-dependent process facilitated by Hsp70. This mechanism facilitates K+-dependent reductions in NCC to protect plasma K+ homeostasis and potentially reduces BP."
https://openalex.org/W3173702795,"Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is characterized by frequent mutation of VHL protein, a tumor suppressor that functions as the substrate recognition subunit of a Cullin2 RING E3 ligase complex (CRL2VHL). CRL2VHL plays important roles in oxygen sensing by targeting hypoxia-inducible factor-alpha (HIF-α) subunits for ubiquitination and degradation. VHL is also commonly hijacked by bifunctional molecules such as proteolysis-targeting chimeras to induce degradation of target molecules. We previously reported the design and characterization of VHL inhibitors VH032 and VH298 that block the VHL:HIF-α interaction, activate the HIF transcription factor, and induce a hypoxic response, which can be beneficial to treat anemia and mitochondrial diseases. How these compounds affect the global cellular proteome remains unknown. Here, we use unbiased quantitative MS to identify the proteomic changes elicited by the VHL inhibitor compared with hypoxia or the broad-spectrum prolyl-hydroxylase domain enzyme inhibitor IOX2. Our results demonstrate that VHL inhibitors selectively activate the HIF response similar to the changes induced in hypoxia and IOX2 treatment. Interestingly, VHL inhibitors were found to specifically upregulate VHL itself. Our analysis revealed that this occurs via protein stabilization of VHL isoforms and not via changes in transcript levels. Increased VHL levels upon VH298 treatment resulted in turn in reduced levels of HIF-1α protein. This work demonstrates the specificity of VHL inhibitors and reveals different antagonistic effects upon their acute versus prolonged treatment in cells. These findings suggest that therapeutic use of VHL inhibitors may not produce overt side effects from HIF stabilization as previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W3173848215,"The human cytidine deaminase family of APOBEC3s (A3s) plays critical roles in both innate immunity and the development of cancers. A3s comprise seven functionally overlapping but distinct members that can be exploited as nucleotide base editors for treating genetic diseases. Although overall structurally similar, A3s have vastly varying deamination activity and substrate preferences. Recent crystal structures of ssDNA-bound A3s together with experimental studies have provided some insights into distinct substrate specificities among the family members. However, the molecular interactions responsible for their distinct biological functions and how structure regulates substrate specificity are not clear. In this study, we identified the structural basis of substrate specificities in three catalytically active A3 domains whose crystal structures have been previously characterized: A3A, A3B- CTD, and A3G-CTD. Through molecular modeling and dynamic simulations, we found an interdependency between ssDNA substrate binding conformation and nucleotide sequence specificity. In addition to the U-shaped conformation seen in the crystal structure with the CTC0 motif, A3A can accommodate the CCC0 motif when ssDNA is in a more linear (L) conformation. A3B can also bind both U- and L-shaped ssDNA, unlike A3G, which can stably recognize only linear ssDNA. These varied conformations are stabilized by sequence-specific interactions with active site loops 1 and 7, which are highly variable among A3s. Our results explain the molecular basis of previously observed substrate specificities in A3s and have implications for designing A3-specific inhibitors for cancer therapy as well as engineering base-editing systems for gene therapy."

Controlled release with an optimum retentive formulation in the upper stomach would be an ideal formulation for this drug. The aim of the present study was therefore to develop, formulate and optimize floating, bioadhesive, and swellable matrix tablets of ranitidine HCl.

Central composite design (CCD) was used to optimize the formulation and a total of thirteen formulations were prepared. Concentration of HPMC/NaCMC (3:1) (X 1 ) and NaHCO 3 (X 2 ) were selected as independent variables; and floating lag time (Y 1 ), bioadhesive strength (Y 2 ), swelling index at 12 h (Y 3 ), cumulative drug release at 1 h (Y 4 ), time to 50% drug release (t 50% ) (Y 5 ) and cumulative drug release at 12 h (Y 6 ) were taken as the response variables. The optimized batch showed floating lag time of 5.09 sec, bioadhesive strength of 29.69 g, swelling index of 315.04% at 12 h, t 50% of 3.86 h and drug release of 24.21% and 93.65% at 1h and 12 h, respectively, with anomalous release mechanism. The results indicate that sustained release matrix tablet of ranitidine HCl with combined floating, bioadhesive and swelling gastro-retentive properties can be considered as a strategy to overcome the low bioavailability and in vivo variation associated with the conventional ranitidine HCl tablet."
https://openalex.org/W3174018913,"Background In patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) that have spinal cord compression and sensorimotor deficits, surgical decompression is often performed. However, there is heterogeneity in clinical presentation and post-surgical functional recovery. Objectives Primary: a) to assess differences in muscle fat infiltration (MFI) in patients with DCM versus controls, b) to assess association between MFI and clinical disability. Secondary: to assess association between MFI pre-surgery and post-surgical functional recovery. Study design Cross-sectional case control study. Methods Eighteen patients with DCM (58.6 ± 14.2 years, 10 M/8F) and 25 controls (52.6 ± 11.8 years, 13M/12 F) underwent 3D Dixon fat-water imaging. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to segment cervical muscles (MFSS- multifidus and semispinalis cervicis, LC- longus capitis/colli) and quantify MFI. Modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) and Nurick were collected. Results Patients with DCM had significantly higher MFI in MFSS (20.63 ± 5.43 vs 17.04 ± 5.24, p = 0.043) and LC (18.74 ± 6.7 vs 13.66 ± 4.91, p = 0.021) than controls. Patients with increased MFI in LC and MFSS had higher disability (LC: Nurick (Spearman’s ρ = 0.436, p = 0.003) and mJOA (ρ = -0.399, p = 0.008)). Increased MFI in LC pre-surgery was associated with post-surgical improvement in Nurick (ρ = -0.664, p = 0.026) and mJOA (ρ = -0.603, p = 0.049). Conclusion In DCM, increased muscle adiposity is significantly associated with sensorimotor deficits, clinical disability, and functional recovery after surgery. Accurate and time efficient evaluation of fat infiltration in cervical muscles may be conducted through implementation of CNN models."
https://openalex.org/W3173649828,"The emergence of dengue in malaria-endemic countries with limited diagnostic resources, such as Yemen, can be problematic because presumptive treatment of febrile cases as being malaria is a common practice. Co-infections with dengue and malaria are often overlooked and misdiagnosed as being a mono-infection because of clinical similarities. In Hodeidah city, Yemen, the capacity to conduct the diagnosis can be aggravated by the war context. To assess the magnitude of the problem, we determined the proportions of malaria, dengue and co-infection in relation to clinical characteristics among febrile outpatients.This cross-sectional study included 355 febrile outpatients from Hodeidah city during the malaria transmission season (September 2018 -February 2019). Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were collected using a pre-designed, structured questionnaire. Malaria was confirmed using microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), while dengue was confirmed using RDTs.Mono-infection proportions of 32.4% for falciparum malaria and 35.2% for dengue were found, where about two-thirds of dengue patients had a recent probable infection. However, co-infection with falciparum malaria and dengue was detected among 4.8% of cases. There was no statistically significant difference between having co-infection and mono-infection with malaria or dengue in relation to the sociodemographic characteristics. On the other hand, the odds of co-infection were significantly lower than the odds of malaria among patients presenting with sweating (OR = 0.1, 95% CI: 0.05-0.45; p <0.001), while the odds of co-infection were 3.5 times significantly higher than the odds of dengue among patients presenting with vomiting (OR = 3.5, 95% CI: 1.20-10.04; p <0.021). However, there were no statistically significant differences between having co-infection and mono-infection (malaria or dengue) in relation to other clinical characteristics.Mono-infection with malaria or dengue can be detected among about one-third of febrile outpatients in Hodeidah, while almost 5.0% of cases can be co-infected. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics cannot easily distinguish malaria patients from dengue-infected or co-infected ones, reinforcing the necessity of laboratory confirmation and avoidance of treating febrile patients as being presumed malaria cases."
https://openalex.org/W3173843039,"Abstract The inactivation of p53, a tumor suppressor, and the activation of the RAS oncogene are the most frequent genetic alterations in cancer. We have shown that a unique E. coli MazF-MazE toxin–antitoxin (TA) system can be used for selective and effective eradication of RAS -mutated cancer cells. This out of the box strategy holds great promise for effective cancer treatment and management. We provide proof of concept for a novel platform to selectively eradicate cancer cells using an adenoviral delivery system based on the adjusted natural bacterial system. We generated adenoviral vectors carrying the mazF toxin (pAdEasy-Py4-SV40mP-mCherry-MazF) and the antitoxin mazE (pAdEasy-RGC-SV40mP-MazE-IRES-GFP) under the regulation of RAS and p53 , resp. The control vector carries the toxin without the RAS-responsive element (pAdEasy-ΔPy4-SV40mP-mCherry-MazF). In vitro, the mazF-mazE TA system (Py4-SV40mP-mCherry-MazF+RGC-SV40mP-MazE-IRES-GFP) induced massive, dose-dependent cell death, at 69% compared to 19% for the control vector, in a co-infected HCT116 cell line. In vivo, the system caused significant tumor growth inhibition of HCT116 ( KRAS mut /p53 mut ) tumors at 73 and 65% compared to PBS and ΔPY4 control groups, resp. In addition, we demonstrate 65% tumor growth inhibition in HCT116 ( KRAS mut /p53 wt ) cells, compared to the other two control groups, indicating a contribution of the antitoxin in blocking system leakage in WT RAS cells. These data provide evidence of the feasibility of using mutations in the p53 and RAS pathway to efficiently kill cancer cells. The platform, through its combination of the antitoxin (mazE) with the toxin (mazF), provides effective protection of normal cells from basal low activity or leakage of mazF."
https://openalex.org/W3173965611,"Based on several lines of evidence, numerous investigators have suggested that acetaminophen exposure during early development can induce neurological disorders. We had previously postulated that acetaminophen exposure early in life, if combined with antioxidants that prevent accumulation of NAPQI, the toxic metabolite of acetaminophen, might be innocuous. In this study, we administered acetaminophen at or below the currently recommended therapeutic dose to male laboratory rat pups aged 4-10 days. The antioxidants cysteine and mannitol were included to prevent accumulation of NAPQI. In addition, animals were exposed to a cassette of common stress factors: an inflammatory diet, psychological stress, antibiotics, and mock infections using killed bacteria. At age 37-49 days, observation during introduction to a novel conspecific revealed increased rearing behavior, an asocial activity, in animals treated with acetaminophen plus antioxidants, regardless of their exposure to oxidative stress factors (2-way ANOVA; P < 0.0001). This observation would suggest that the initial hypothesis is incorrect, and that oxidative stress mediators do not entirely eliminate the effects of acetaminophen on neurodevelopment. This study provides additional cause for caution when considering the use of acetaminophen in the pediatric population, and provides evidence that the effects of acetaminophen on neurodevelopment need to be considered both in the presence and in the absence of oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W3174092631,"Despite Dual Careers (sports and education) and mobility of students being priorities in the funding policies of the European Commission, migrating student-athletes report severe challenges and decreased performance or dropouts at sport and academic levels. The objective of this study was to depict and assess the perceptions on challenges, support services, and their effectiveness in consideration of specific characteristics of participants and migrations. Based on a meta-synthesis and previous findings, a 50-items questionnaire was developed and completed by 245 student-athletes in 5 European countries. Participants with Dual Careers migration experience (n = 140) were considered for analyses of qualitative and quantitative (ordinal 5pt-Likert-scaled and metric) data on the Dual Career status, migration characteristics, received services, and outcomes. Chi-square-tests were conducted for differences between countries and genders at a significance level of p < .05. Country-related differences were found for experiences and intentions to migrate (X2(12) = 50.52, p<0.001), duration of the migration (X2(16) = 38.20, p = 0.001), financial support (X2(8) = 29.87, p<0.001), and decreased performances in academics (X2(16) = 56.12, p<0.001) and sports (X2(16) = 31.79, p = 0.01). Gender-related difference emerged in financial support (X2(4) = 10.68, p = 0.03), duration of the migration (X2(4) = 14.56, p = 0.01), and decreased academic performance (X2(4) = 10.57, p = 0.03). Tutoring and counselling support was ranked as the most effective support, especially when received from the academic field (4.0±1.0 pt) and others (4.1±0.8 pt), followed by online services from sport and academic sectors (both: 3.9±0.9 pt). Considering the pervasive globalization of sport and education, Dual Career migration can contribute to the development of a European sport culture. The high ratio of migrating student-athletes underlines the relevance of migrations in the field of Dual Careers. This study contributes to the literature by adding insights on practices, challenges, supports, and outcomes perceived by student-athletes migrating in Europe. Moreover, country- and gender-related differences support the consideration of specific characteristics and reveal critical factors in specific target groups. The findings contribute to identifying requirements and effective support measures in Dual Career migrations and can be used to improve support services."
https://openalex.org/W3174613761,"The triangle structure, being a fundamental and significant element, underlies many theories and techniques in studying complex networks. The formation of triangles is typically measured by the clustering coefficient, in which the focal node is the centre-node in an open triad. In contrast, the recently proposed closure coefficient measures triangle formation from an end-node perspective and has been proven to be a useful feature in network analysis. Here, we extend it by proposing the directed closure coefficient that measures the formation of directed triangles. By distinguishing the direction of the closing edge in building triangles, we further introduce the source closure coefficient and the target closure coefficient. Then, by categorising particular types of directed triangles (e.g., head-of-path), we propose four closure patterns. Through multiple experiments on 24 directed networks from six domains, we demonstrate that at network-level, the four closure patterns are distinctive features in classifying network types, while at node-level, adding the source and target closure coefficients leads to significant improvement in link prediction task in most types of directed networks."
https://openalex.org/W3174582101,"Prebiotic supplementation has been studied as a means to enhance growth and health in dairy calves; however, results seem to be inconsistent across studies. The first objective of the future review is to identify, summarize, appraise, and discuss the current literature on the prebiotic supplementation for dairy calves. The second objective is to evaluate the effect of prebiotic supplementation on growth and health of dairy calves. Eligible studies will be non-randomized and randomized controlled trials in English, Spanish, or Portuguese that examined the supplementation of prebiotics to dairy calves (up to 6 months of age) and reported growth or health outcomes. The main growth outcomes will be average daily gain, feed efficiency, and main health outcomes will be fecal score and diarrhea incidence. A search will be conducted in Biosis, CAB Abstracts, Medline, Scopus, and the Dissertations and Theses Database with the support of a UC Davis librarian. Two reviewers independently will screen the titles and abstracts of retrieved studies. The screening of full manuscripts will be performed by one reviewer. The data extraction will be executed based on pre-tested forms. Risk of bias will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. If feasible, a random-effects meta-analysis will be conducted. Heterogeneity will be evaluated with I2 statistic. If possible, publication bias will be investigated by using funnel plots, Begg's adjusted rank correlation, and Egger's test. The certainty of the evidence will be determined using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) approach. The proposed review will contribute to the current knowledge on prebiotic supplementation for dairy calves; this information may guide management decision at the farm level and identify gaps of knowledge to be addressed in future research.

https://openalex.org/W3174924604,"Abstract A prototypic pediatric cancer that frequently shows activation of RAS signaling is embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS). ERMS also show aberrant Hedgehog (HH)/GLI signaling activity and can be driven by germline mutations in this pathway. We show, that in ERMS cell lines derived from sporadic tumors i.e. from tumors not caused by an inherited genetic variant, HH/GLI signaling plays a subordinate role, because oncogenic mutations in HRAS , KRAS , or NRAS (collectively named oncRAS) inhibit the main HH target GLI1 via the MEK/ERK-axis, but simultaneously increase proliferation and tumorigenicity. oncRAS also modulate expression of stem cell markers in an isoform- and context-dependent manner. In Hh -driven murine ERMS that are caused by a Patched mutation, oncHRAS and mainly oncKRAS accelerate tumor development, whereas oncNRAS induces a more differentiated phenotype. These features occur when the oncRAS mutations are induced at the ERMS precursor stage, but not when induced in already established tumors. Moreover, in contrast to what is seen in human cell lines, oncRAS mutations do not alter Hh signaling activity and marginally affect expression of stem cell markers. Together, all three oncRAS mutations seem to be advantageous for ERMS cell lines despite inhibition of HH signaling and isoform-specific modulation of stem cell markers. In contrast, oncRAS mutations do not inhibit Hh-signaling in Hh-driven ERMS. In this model, oncRAS mutations seem to be advantageous for specific ERMS populations that occur within a specific time window during ERMS development. In addition, this window may be different for individual oncRAS isoforms, at least in the mouse."
https://openalex.org/W3175377851,"Introduction The aim of this study was to report 36-month longitudinal changes using the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) in ambulant patients affected by Duchenne muscular dystrophy amenable to skip exons 44, 45, 51 or 53. Materials and methods We included 101 patients, 34 had deletions amenable to skip exon 44, 25 exon 45, 19 exon 51, and 28 exon 53, not recruited in any ongoing clinical trials. Five patients were counted to skip exon 51 and 53 since they had a single deletion of exon 52. Results The difference between subgroups (skip 44, 45, 51 and 53) was significant at 12 (p = 0.043), 24 (p = 0.005) and 36 months ( p ≤ 0 . 001 ). Discussion Mutations amenable to skip exons 53 and 51 had lower baseline values and more negative changes than the other subgroups while those amenable to skip exon 44 had higher scores both at baseline and at follow up. Conclusion Our results confirm different progression of disease in subgroups of patients with deletions amenable to skip different exons. This information is relevant as current long term clinical trials are using the NSAA in these subgroups of mutations."
https://openalex.org/W3174265906,"Small airways are difficult to access. Exhaled droplets, also referred to as particles, provide a sample of small airway lining fluid and may reflect inflammatory responses. We aimed to explore the effect of smoking on the composition and number of exhaled particles in a smoker-enriched study population. We collected and chemically analyzed exhaled particles from 102 subjects (29 never smokers, 36 former smokers and 37 current smokers) aged 39 to 83 years (median 63). A breathing maneuver maximized the number exhaled particles, which were quantified with a particle counter. The contents of surfactant protein A and albumin in exhaled particles was quantified with immunoassays and the contents of the phospholipids dipalmitoyl- and palmitoyl-oleoyl- phosphatidylcholine with mass spectrometry. Subjects also performed spirometry and nitrogen single breath washout. Associations between smoking status and the distribution of contents in exhaled particles and particle number concentration were tested with quantile regression, after adjusting for potential confounders. Current smokers, compared to never smokers, had higher number exhaled particles and more surfactant protein A in the particles. The magnitude of the effects of current smoking varied along the distribution of each PEx-variable. Among subjects with normal lung function, phospholipid levels were elevated in current smokers, in comparison to no effect of smoking on these lipids at abnormal lung function. Smoking increased exhaled number of particles and the contents of lipids and surfactant protein A in the particles. These findings might reflect early inflammatory responses to smoking in small airway lining fluid, also when lung function is within normal limits."
https://openalex.org/W3174751485,"Preclinical research provides evidence for the complement system as a potential common pathway in Stargardt disease (STGD1) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) leading to retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) loss. However, systemic complement activation has not yet been assessed in STGD1 patients. We conducted a cross-sectional case-control study to assess systemic complement activation in STGD1 patients and its association with disease severity.Systemic concentrations of complement component C3 and its degradation product C3d were compared between 80 STGD1 patients and 80 controls that were frequency matched for age and sex. The C3d/C3 ratio was used as parameter of systemic complement activation. Within the STGD1 cohort, we additionally examined the association between the C3d/C3 ratio, demographic and behavioural factors (age, sex, smoking and BMI), and measures of disease severity (age at onset, visual acuity, and area of atrophy).The C3d/C3 ratio did not significantly differ between patients (mean C3d/C3 ratio 3.5±1.4) and controls (mean C3d/C3 ratio 3.6±1.0), mean difference -0.156 (p = 0.804, independent samples t-test). The overall effect size was 8% (95% confidence interval, 3-15%). Elevated C3d/C3 ratios (>8.1) were found in three patients who all had a concomitant inflammatory condition at the time of blood draw. Within the patient cohort, C3 levels were associated with sex (mean difference -134, p = 0.001, independent samples t-test) and BMI (correlation coefficient 0.463, p<0.001, Spearman's Correlation).Systemic complement levels were not elevated in STGD1 patients compared to age and sex matched controls and was not associated with STGD1 severity. Considering the continued absent proof of a systemic contribution of the complement system to RPE loss in STGD1 patients, we hypothesize that complement activation in STGD1 is more likely a local process. In light of upcoming complement-targeted therapies, further studies are needed that measure complement levels in the eye of STGD1 patients."
https://openalex.org/W3175942228,"The translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases Rev1 and Polζ function together in DNA lesion bypass during DNA replication, acting as nucleotide inserter and extender polymerases, respectively. While the structural characterization of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Polζ in its DNA-bound state has illuminated how this enzyme synthesizes DNA, a mechanistic understanding of TLS also requires probing conformational changes associated with DNA- and Rev1 binding. Here, we used single-particle cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structure of the apo Polζ holoenzyme. We show that compared with its DNA-bound state, apo Polζ displays enhanced flexibility that correlates with concerted motions associated with expansion of the Polζ DNA-binding channel upon DNA binding. We also identified a lysine residue that obstructs the DNA-binding channel in apo Polζ, suggesting a gating mechanism. The Polζ subunit Rev7 is a hub protein that directly binds Rev1 and is a component of several other protein complexes such as the shieldin DNA double-strand break repair complex. We analyzed the molecular interactions of budding yeast Rev7 in the context of Polζ and those of human Rev7 in the context of shieldin using a crystal structure of Rev7 bound to a fragment of the shieldin-3 protein. Overall, our study provides new insights into Polζ mechanism of action and the manner in which Rev7 recognizes partner proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3177121194,"Developing large-scale datasets with research-quality annotations is challenging due to the high cost of refining clinically generated markup into high precision annotations. We evaluated the direct use of a large dataset with only clinically generated annotations in development of high-performance segmentation models for small research-quality challenge datasets.We used a large retrospective dataset from our institution comprised of 1,620 clinically generated segmentations, and two challenge datasets (PROMISE12: 50 patients, ProstateX-2: 99 patients). We trained a 3D U-Net convolutional neural network (CNN) segmentation model using our entire dataset, and used that model as a template to train models on the challenge datasets. We also trained versions of the template model using ablated proportions of our dataset, and evaluated the relative benefit of those templates for the final models. Finally, we trained a version of the template model using an out-of-domain brain cancer dataset, and evaluated the relevant benefit of that template for the final models. We used five-fold cross-validation (CV) for all training and evaluation across our entire dataset.Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on our large dataset (mean overall Dice 0.916, average Hausdorff distance 0.135 across CV folds). Using this model as a pre-trained template for refining on two external datasets significantly enhanced performance (30% and 49% enhancement in Dice scores respectively). Mean overall Dice and mean average Hausdorff distance were 0.912 and 0.15 for the ProstateX-2 dataset, and 0.852 and 0.581 for the PROMISE12 dataset. Using even small quantities of data to train the template enhanced performance, with significant improvements using 5% or more of the data.We trained a state-of-the-art model using unrefined clinical prostate annotations and found that its use as a template model significantly improved performance in other prostate segmentation tasks, even when trained with only 5% of the original dataset."
https://openalex.org/W3174702657,"The ATR pathway is one of the major DNA damage checkpoints, and Rad17 is a DNA-binding protein that is phosphorylated upon DNA damage by ATR kinase. Rad17 recruits the 9-1-1 complex that mediates the checkpoint activation, and proteasomal degradation of Rad17 is important for recovery from the ATR pathway. Here, we identified several Rad17 mutants deficient in nuclear localization and resistant to proteasomal degradation. The nuclear localization signal was identified in the central basic domain of Rad17. Rad17 Δ230-270 and R240A/L243A mutants that were previously postulated to lack the destruction box, a sequence that is recognized by the ubiquitin ligase/anaphase-promoting complex that mediates degradation of Rad17, also showed cytoplasmic localization. Our data indicate that the nuclear translocation of Rad17 is functionally linked to the proteasomal degradation. The ATP-binding activity of Rad17, but not hydrolysis, is essential for the nuclear translocation, and the ATPase domain orchestrates the nuclear translocation, the proteasomal degradation, as well as the interaction with the 9-1-1 complex. The Rad17 mutant that lacked a nuclear localization signal was proficient in the interaction with the 9-1-1 complex, suggesting cytosolic association of Rad17 and the 9-1-1 complex. Finally, we identified two tandem canonical and noncanonical destruction boxes in the N-terminus of Rad17 as the bona fide destruction box, supporting the role of anaphase-promoting complex in the degradation of Rad17. We propose a model in which Rad17 is activated in the cytoplasm for translocation into the nucleus and continuously degraded in the nucleus even in the absence of exogenous DNA damage."

However, its role in CKD has not been totally elucidated. This study aimed to evaluate zonulin levels in subjects with diabetic kidney disease (DKD). This case-control study included two cases groups: 1) Advanced DKD cases: T2DM patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60ml/min/1.73m2; 2) Albuminuric T2DM cases: diabetic patients with urinary albumin excretion (UAE) >30mg/g creatinine, but with eGFR>60ml/min/1.73m2. Two control groups were also included: 1) T2DM controls: patients with T2DM without impaired kidney function; 2) Non-T2DM controls: subjects without T2DM and normal renal function. Serum levels of zonulin were measured by ELISA. Eighty-six individuals were included. Zonulin levels was different among study groups (P = 0.003). T2DM controls presented higher zonulin levels than non-T2DM controls [(131.35 (83.0-170.5) vs. 87.25 (54.7-111.8), P = 0.018] and advanced DKD cases [63.72 (45.03-106.0); P = 0.007]. Zonulin showed a positive correlation with eGFR (r = 0.222; P = 0.040), total cholesterol (r = 0.299; P = 0.034), LDL (r = 0.258; P = 0.021), and negative with albuminuria (r = -0.243; P = 0.024) and body fat (r = -0.271; P = 0.014). In the multivariate logistic regression analyses, zonulin levels were independently associated to renal outcomes [OR 0.99 (0.98-0.99, P = 0.012)] after 5-year inclusion. In conclusion, increased zonulin levels in patients with TD2M without renal disease suggest an impaired intestinal permeability. Moreover, its association with renal outcomes could indicate its use as a disease monitoring marker. However, the mechanisms behind this association should be better understood."

This may be partly due to the effect of inflammation in heart function. The impact of antirheumatic drugs on cardiac dysfunction in AA remains controversial. Therefore, we aimed to examine effects of antirheumatic treatment on serum N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in AA patients and its relationship to inflammatory markers.We examined 115 patients with AA (64 rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 31 psoriatic arthritis and 20 ankylosis spondylitis) starting with methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) with or without MTX co-medication. NT-proBNP (measured in serum by ECLIA from Roche Diagnostics), and other clinical and laboratory parameters were evaluated at baseline, after 6 weeks and 6 months of treatment.NT-proBNP levels did not change significantly after 6 weeks and 6 months of antirheumatic therapy (pbaseline-6weeks = 0.939; pbaseline-6months = 0.485), although there was a modest improvement from 6 weeks to 6 months in the MTX only treatment group (median difference = -18.2 [95% CI = -32.3 to -4.06], p = 0.013). There was no difference in the effects of MTX monotherapy and TNFi regimen on NT-proBNP levels. The changes in NT-proBNP after antirheumatic treatment positively correlated with changes in C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Baseline NT-proBNP levels were related to baseline CRP and ESR levels, and some other established markers of disease activities in crude analyses.Circulating levels of NT-proBNP were related to established inflammatory markers at baseline, and the changes in NT-proBNP after antirheumatic treatment were positively related to these markers. Nevertheless, antirheumatic therapy did not seem to affect NT-proBNP levels compared to baseline, even though inflammatory markers significantly improved."

CREB is activated through phosphorylation of an evolutionarily conserved Ser residue (S133) within its intrinsically disordered kinase-inducible domain (KID).

Here we addressed the mechanisms of CREB attenuation following bursts in CREB phosphorylation. We show that phosphorylation of S133 is reversed by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which is recruited to CREB through its B56 regulatory subunits. We found that a B56-binding site located at the carboxyl-terminal boundary of the KID (BS2) mediates high-affinity B56 binding, while a second binding site (BS1) located near the amino terminus of the KID mediates low affinity binding enhanced by phosphorylation of adjacent casein kinase (CK) phosphosites. Mutations that diminished B56 binding to BS2 elevated both basal and stimulus-induced phosphorylation of S133, increased CBP interaction with CREB, and potentiated the expression of CREB-dependent reporter genes.

Montminy M. Transcriptional regulation by the phosphorylation-dependent factor CREB.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar). Conserved throughout metazoan evolution, CREB regulates cell growth, survival, and differentiation and plays instrumental roles in neuronal long-term potentiation, hepatic glucose metabolism, and other physiologic processes (2Altarejos J.Y.

The molecular biology of memory: cAMP, PKA, CRE, CREB-1, CREB-2, and CPEB.Mol. Brain. 2012; 5: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The canonical CREB activation pathway involves its cAMP-inducible phosphorylation on S133 by protein kinase A (PKA) (4Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R.

S133 is located within an ∼60 aa intrinsically disordered region (IDR) termed the kinase-inducible domain (KID) (6Gonzalez G.A. Yamamoto K.K. Fischer W.H. Karr D. Menzel P. Biggs 3rd, W. Vale W.W.

While these stimuli trigger S133 phosphorylation stoichiometries similar to those induced by cAMP and Ca2+, they are relatively weak inducers of CRTC nuclear accumulation and fail to robustly induce CREB-CBP ternary complexes over CRE-containing promoters (17Ravnskjaer K.

Phosphorylation of S142 is induced by circadian entrainment and many of the same stimuli that induce S133, yet this site antagonizes CREB-CBP interaction (25Gau D. Lemberger T. von Gall C. Kretz O.

Processive phosphorylation of S129 by GSK3 following PKA-dependent priming phosphorylation of S133 has been implicated in the inhibition CREB DNA-binding activity (28Grimes C.A. Jope R.S.

Neurochem. 2001; 78: 1219-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), though its stoichiometry and functional importance are uncertain. Our laboratory has investigated a conserved cluster of Ser residues within the KID dubbed the CK cassette that undergoes processive phosphorylation by ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and casein kinases 1 and 2 (CK1, CK2) in response to genotoxic stress (29Shanware N.P.

Within this motif, ATM-dependent phosphorylation of S111 primes processive phosphorylation of S108 by CK2 and S114 and S117 by CK1. Phosphorylation of all four sites enables a fifth, ATM-dependent phosphorylation event on S121 (29Shanware N.P. Trinh A.T. Williams L.M. Tibbetts R.S. Coregulated ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and casein kinase sites modulate cAMP-response element-binding protein-coactivator interactions in response to DNA damage.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6283-6291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although the biochemical implications of the CK cassette have not been fully elucidated, its phosphorylation in response to DNA damage modestly reduced interaction with the KIX domain of CBP (30Shi Y. Venkataraman S.L. Dodson G.E. Mabb A.M. LeBlanc S. Tibbetts R.S. Direct regulation of CREB transcriptional activity by ATM in response to genotoxic stress.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5898-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). More recently, it was shown that ATM- and CK1/2-dependent phosphorylation of CK cassette inhibited CREB DNA-binding activity in a graded manner by promoting an electrostatic, autoinhibitory interaction with the bZip domain (31Kim S.H. Trinh A.T. Larsen M.C. Mastrocola A.S. Jefcoate C.R. Bushel P.R. Tibbetts R.S.

Structural basis for graded inhibition of CREB:DNA interactions by multisite phosphorylation.Biochemistry. 2018; 57: 6964-6972Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). An inhibitory role for the CK cassette is consistent with the modest suppression of CREB transcriptional activity following cellular exposure to DNA damage (30Shi Y. Venkataraman S.L. Dodson G.E. Mabb A.M. LeBlanc S. Tibbetts R.S. Direct regulation of CREB transcriptional activity by ATM in response to genotoxic stress.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although the cellular implications are uncertain, ATM and CK-dependent inhibition of CREB likely contributes to adaptive responses to DNA damage. It is also conceivable that the CK cassette influences CREB activity in response to non-DNA-damaging stimuli. Finally, while the kinases controlling CREB phosphorylation have garnered much attention, comparatively little is known regarding the mechanisms of CREB dephosphorylation. Both PP1 and PP2A have been implicated as S133 phosphatases (33Wadzinski B.E. Wheat W.H. Jaspers S. Peruski Jr., L.F. Lickteig R.L. Johnson G.L. Klemm D.J.

Attenuation of a phosphorylation-dependent activator by an HDAC-PP1 complex.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) while the CK cassette was reported to be dephosphorylated by PP2A through B56-type regulatory subunits (35Shanware N.P. Zhan L. Hutchinson J.A. Kim S.H. Williams L.M. Tibbetts R.S. Conserved and distinct modes of CREB/ATF transcription factor regulation by PP2A/B56gamma and genotoxic stress.PLoS One. 2010; 5e12173Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In this study we show that the CK cassette and S133 are coregulated during canonical CREB activation by cAMP and that recruitment of PP2A-B56 holoenzymes to a constitutive B56-docking motif enhanced by an acidic patch triggers the dephosphorylation of S133 and the CK cassette. Cells expressing CREB with disruptive mutations in this motif exhibits increased S133 phosphorylation and transcription potential. These results highlight the interdependence of CREB phosphorylation mechanisms and establish new models for probing functional impacts of CREB signaling in vivo. Previous work established that, in addition to undergoing stoichiometric phosphorylation following DNA damage, the CK cassette is also phosphorylated independently of DNA damage (31Kim S.H. Trinh A.T. Larsen M.C. Mastrocola A.S. Jefcoate C.R. Bushel P.R. Tibbetts R.S. Tunable regulation of CREB DNA binding activity couples genotoxic stress response and metabolism.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: 9667-9680PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). To investigate the relationship between the CK cassette and canonical regulation of CREB by cAMP, we measured CREB phosphorylation in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) following a pulsatile exposure to forskolin (Fsk), which stimulates cAMP production. Phosphorylation of the CK cassette (pCK-CREB) was induced within 30 min of Fsk exposure as evidenced by a characteristic electrophoretic mobility shift that reflects CK1/2-dependent phosphorylation of S108, S111, S114, and S117 (Fig. 1B) (29Shanware N.P. Trinh A.T. Williams L.M. Tibbetts R.S. Coregulated ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and casein kinase sites modulate cAMP-response element-binding protein-coactivator interactions in response to DNA damage.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6283-6291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Washout experiments revealed that maximal CK cassette phosphorylation persisted for 60 min after Fsk removal, returning to baseline levels after an additional 4 to 6 h while S133 phosphorylation was relatively more labile, returning to baseline levels within 1 h of Fsk washout (Fig. 1, B–D). The phosphorylation and dephosphorylation profiles of S133 were comparable between Creb+/+ and CrebS111A/S111A MEFs (Fig. 1, B and C) suggesting that phosphorylation of the CK cassette does not have a major influence on S133 kinases and phosphatases. Fsk-induced phosphorylation of the CK cassette was blocked by a combination of CK1 (D4476) and CK2 (TBB) inhibitors but not by either inhibitor alone (Fig. 1E). Consistent with previous findings, CK1/CK2 inhibition also suppressed phosphorylation of CREB in response to calicheamicin γ1 (CLM)-induced DNA damage (Fig. 1E). Finally, other agents that induce S133 phosphorylation, including PMA and serum, also increased the pCK-CREB/CREB ratio; however, CK cluster phosphorylation stoichiometry was lower than that seen in Fsk-treated cells (Fig. S1, A and B). From the combined findings we conclude that Fsk triggers coincident phosphorylation of S133 and the CK cassette while the dephosphorylation profiles of the two motifs differ. Recognition of distinct short linear motifs (SLiMs) in substrates is an emerging theme for PP2A regulatory subunits (from four families, B/B55, B’/B56, B’’/PR72, and B’’’/PR93) to control substrate specificities of diverse PP2A holoenzymes. B55 and B56 subunits of PP2A were recently suggested to recognize a bipartite polybasic motif (36Cundell M.J. Hutter L.H. Nunes Bastos R. Poser E. Holder J. Mohammed S. Novak B. Barr F.A.

A dynamic charge-charge interaction modulates PP2A:B56 substrate recruitment.Elife. 2020; 9e55966Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Analysis of CREB amino acid sequence identified two potential B56-docking motifs: a site near the amino-terminus of the KID spanning residues 102 to 107 (binding site 1 (BS1)) and a site near the carboxyl-terminus of the KID spanning residues 148 to 153 (BS2) (Fig. 2A). Of these, only BS1 is positionally conserved in the CREB paralog ATF1 (Fig. 2A). Pull-down assays revealed that a GST-CREB (99–159) fusion protein containing both BS1 and BS2 interacted with B56γ1, a member from the B56 family, but not B55α, a member from B55 family (Fig. S2A). In contrast to CREB (99–159), CREB (99–141) containing only BS1 exhibited weak binding to B56γ1 in GST pull-down assays (Fig. 2, B and C, Fig. S2, B and C). CREB (126–159) containing only BS2 bound to B56γ1 as avidly as CREB (99–159) containing both BS1 and BS2, suggesting that BS2 is the dominant B56-binding motif (Fig. S2, B and C). Consistent with this notion, B56γ1 only weakly associated with the GST-ATF1 (Fig. 2C), and E153A, a mutation to the required residue for B56 binding within BS2, abolished CREB (99–159) binding to B56γ1 (Fig. 2D). Finally, the weak binding of B56γ1 to CREB (99–141) was potentiated by a phosphomimetic S108E mutation (Fig. 2E). This finding is consistent with studies showing that phosphorylation on second or seventh to ninth positions of B56-motifs enhanced the interactions between B56 subunits and their substrates (37Wu C.G.

Cell. 2016; 63: 686-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Because S108 (corresponding to the +7 position of the B56-binding consensus) undergoes phosphorylation following DNA damage (29Shanware N.P. Trinh A.T. Williams L.M. Tibbetts R.S. Coregulated ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and casein kinase sites modulate cAMP-response element-binding protein-coactivator interactions in response to DNA damage.J. Biol.

Using crystal structures of the PP2A-B56γ1 holoenzyme (PDB code:2NPP) and B56γ1-BubR1 substrate peptide complex (PDB code:5JJA), we built structural models for the PP2A-B56γ1 holoenzyme bound to the upstream and downstream CREB motifs (Fig. 2F). These models reveal that BS2 is structurally favorable for placing pS133 to the phosphatase active site (Fig. 2F, right panel). In contrast, the binding of BS1 requires a sharp turn in CREB for pS133 to access the phosphatase active site (Fig. 2F, left panel). The lack of residues to make sharp turns in the spacer between BS1 and pS133 (Fig. 2A) makes this motif energetically ineffective to target the holoenzyme to pS133. Finally, we calculated Kcat (16.0/s) and Km (10.3 μM) of the PP2A-B56γ1 holoenzyme toward a phosphorylated pS133-CREB (129–154) peptide (Fig. 2G). Consistently, the affinity between CREB and B56γ1 was estimated to be between 7.5 and 15 μM by titration pull-down assay (Fig. S2, D and E). Taken together, the in vitro studies implicate BS2 as functional B56-binding motif while BS1 may function as a phosphorylation-dependent B56 recruitment domain. To investigate functional implications of B56-PP2A binding to CREB, we generated a panel of FLAG-tagged CREB mutants in which BS1, BS2, or both motifs were disrupted through substitution of the critical +5 Glu residue with either Ala or Asp. We also introduced eight Ser/Thr to Ala substitutions into the CK cassette (see Experimental procedures) to examine potential impacts on S133 dephosphorylation kinetics. Whereas BS1 mutations (E107D/A) did not appreciably affect pS133 levels, BS2 (E153D/A) mutations caused a 3- to 4-fold increase in baseline S133 phosphorylation (Fig. 3, A and B). pS133 levels were comparable between CREBE153D and CREBE107D/E153D double mutants suggesting that BS2 is the major regulator of S133 dephosphorylation in the absence of stimulation. We also compared S133 phosphorylation levels between FLAG-tagged CREBWT, CREBE107D, and CREBE153D follo"

Dominant fragment ions were found to be H + , CH 2 + , and Sn + . Subsequently, fragment ions were mass-selected. The mass spectrum of the selected ions indicated that only a single peak appeared at the mass number of 120 u, being suggestive of the presence of 120 Sn + ions. The ion energy was set at the range of 20–100 eV. The Sn + ion beam was irradiated to a Si substrate, and a film was then found deposited on the substrate after the ion beam irradiation. An X-ray diffraction measurement showed that the film obtained was metallic Sn. Then, the Sn + ion beam was irradiated to a quartz crystal microbalance substrate. We found that most of the irradiated Sn + ions were adhered to the substrate, at the ion energy levels of 25 and 58 eV, producing the Sn film, whereas a 107 eV Sn + beam caused a significant proportion of Sn atoms in the film to detach from the substrate, probably due to sputtering."

However, limited studies have been conducted in Ghana to identify such clusters.This study aimed to identify high-risk clusters for all-cause and cause-specific neonatal mortality in the Kintampo Districts.Secondary data, comprising of 30,132 singleton neonates between January 2005 and December 2014, from the Kintampo Health and Demographic Surveillance System (KHDSS) database were used. Verbal autopsies were used to determine probable causes of neonatal deaths. Purely spatial analysis was ran to scan for high-risk clusters using Poisson and Bernoulli models for all-cause and cause-specific neonatal mortality in the Kintampo Districts respectively with village as the unit of analysis.The study revealed significantly high risk of village-clusters for neonatal deaths due to asphyxia (RR = 1.98, p = 0.012) and prematurity (RR = 5.47, p = 0.025) in the southern part of Kintampo Districts. Clusters (emerging clusters) which have the potential to be significant in future, for all-cause neonatal mortality was also identified in the south-western part of the Kintampo Districts.Study findings showed cause-specific neonatal mortality clustering in the southern part of the Kintampo Districts. Emerging cluster was also identified for all-cause neonatal mortality. More attention is needed on prematurity and asphyxia in the identified cause-specific neonatal mortality clusters. The emerging cluster for all-cause neonatal mortality also needs more attention to forestall any formation of significant mortality cluster in the future. Further research is also required to understand the high concentration of prematurity and asphyxiated deaths in the identified clusters."
https://openalex.org/W3174097150,"This article introduces DUIA, the Database on Urban Inequality and Amenities. DUIA includes data on the socio-economic development and amenities of 86 cities. The database especially covers cities outside the West, providing new opportunities for comparative research in fields suffering from a dearth of data. DUIA addresses three concerns that have not been resolved by other databases on cities. First, we draw upon remote sensing derived data from the Atlas of Urban Expansion to more accurately define city boundaries. Second, we draw upon survey data stored in IPUMS (Integrated Public Use Microdata Series) to include extensive, harmonized, and disaggregated data. Third, we use open source software and share our scripts to ensure transparency and replicability. DUIA includes information on dwelling and household characteristics, educational attainment, ownership of assets and appliances, and access to amenities. We provide illustrative analyses on asset inequality and water access to demonstrate the potential for the database. Although we also identify several limitations, DUIA represents a step forward in the systematic study of inequality and amenities over time and across cities."
https://openalex.org/W3175468570,"The objective of this research was to comparatively investigate the effect of hot air drying (HA) and hybrid microwave-infrared drying (MI) on physico-chemical characteristics of Thai fermented fish viscera, Tai-Pla , curry powder (TCP). HA was carried out at 60°C, 70°C, and 80°C and MI was carried out at a microwave power of 740, 780, and 810 W with a constant infrared heating power (500 W) for different drying times to obtain the final moisture content ≤ 12.0% and the water activity (a w ) ≤ 0.6. The quality characteristics of TCP were governed by HA temperature and MI output power. TCP dried using HA and MI at all conditions had similar contents of protein, lipid, ash, fiber, and carbohydrate (p&gt;0.05). The fastest drying rate was detected when MI at 810 W for 40 min was applied (p &lt; 0.05). In this condition, TCP had the lowest browning index (A 294 and A 420 ) and the highest lightness ( L* value) (p &lt; 0.05). TCP dried with MI at all powers had higher phenolic content and lower TBARS compared to HA (p &lt; 0.05). However, no significant differences in DPPH • scavenging activity were observed among TPC made by HA and MI (p&gt;0.05). Similar Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra with different peak intensities were observed in all samples, indicating the same functional groups with different contents were found. The bulk density of all TCP ranged from 0.51 g/mL to 0.61 g/mL and the wettability ranged from 24.02% to 26.70%. MI at 810 W for 40 min effectively reduced the drying time (5-fold faster) and lowered the specific energy consumption (18-fold lower) compared to the HA at 60°C for 210 min. Therefore, MI is a promising drying technique to reduce the drying time and improve the overall quality of TCP."

Prehospital trauma care is new to Sri Lanka, and in 2016, a free ambulance service was launched in the Western and Southern provinces.The aim of this study was to identify the proportion of admitted injury patients at a tertiary hospital who used an ambulance to get to the first health facility and examine patient demographics, injury event, and injury type as predictors of ambulance transport.A cross-sectional survey was administered to 405 patients who were admitted to the emergency trauma center at Teaching Hospital Karapitiya (THK) in Galle, Sri Lanka. Descriptive statistics were tabulated to summarize prehospital transportation variables. Logistic regression models were created to examine predictors of ambulance transport, and ArcGIS Pro was used to calculate the distance between injury location and first facility and THK.The proportion of patients with injuries who used an ambulance to get to the first health facility was 20.5%. Factors that were significantly associated with ambulance use were older age, injury mechanism, alcohol use prior to injury, location type, open wound, abrasion, and chest/abdomen injury. Distance from injury location to THK or nearest health facility were not significantly associated with ambulance transport to the first health facility.Among lower acuity injury patients in southern Sri Lanka, 20.5% traveled in an ambulance to the first health facility, while over half used a tuk tuk. Older age and injuries at home were associated with lower odds of ambulance transport. Future studies on predictors of ambulance transport should include patients with more severe injuries, gather detailed data on care provided while in transport and examine the association between prehospital care and clinical outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3176583237,"Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is one of major causes of discontinuing drug development and withdrawing drugs from the market. In this study, we investigated chemical properties associated with DILI using in silico methods, to identify a physicochemical property useful for DILI screening at the early stages of drug development. Total of 652 drugs, including 432 DILI-positive drugs (DILI drugs) and 220 DILI-negative drugs (no-DILI drugs) were selected from Liver Toxicity Knowledge Base of US Food and Drug Administration. Decision tree models were constructed using 2,473 descriptors as explanatory variables. In the final model, the descriptor AMW, representing average molecular weight, was found to be at the first node and showed the highest importance value. With AMW alone, 276 DILI drugs (64%) and 156 no-DILI drugs (71%) were correctly classified. Discrimination with AMW was then performed using therapeutic category information. The performance of discrimination depended on the category and significantly high performance (&gt;0.8 balanced accuracy) was obtained in some categories. Taken together, the present results suggest AMW as a novel descriptor useful for detecting drugs with DILI risk. The information presented may be valuable for the safety assessment of drug candidates at the early stage of drug development."

https://openalex.org/W3173466316,"As we grieve the untimely passing of our mentor Dr. José Baselga, who died at the age of 61 on March 21, 2021, from the devastating Creutzfeldt-Jakob prion disease, we remember with a blend of joy and sorrow our professional and personal relationships with him. José (Josep in Catalan, and Pepe to his family and friends) was born in Barcelona in 1959, and was inspired to study medicine by his father and mother, who were a physician and a nurse, respectively. His father, Dr. Manuel Baselga, was a highly regarded physician in Spain who dedicated his career to occupational health and legal medicine in a time when the industrialization of cities like Barcelona was affecting the health of many workers. In our conversations, José would often remember how his father encouraged him to go to the United States and always do more for his patients. However, they were not the only physicians in the family. José’s sister Eulalia, known affectionately as Lali, also dedicated her career to patient care and became a world-renowned pediatric dermatologist. As José used to say, “Lali is the smartest of us and she works the hardest.” José trained as an internist at the Vall d’Hebron Hospital in Barcelona and quickly found his passion in medical oncology. It was 1984, and at that time the diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer was a discouraging prognosis, and most cancers were being treated with radical chemotherapy regimens. Before finishing his residency, José moved to New York City, where he was accepted into a residency position at King’s County Hospital in Brooklyn. He would often joke about how hard it was to practice medicine in that setting, recalling a time when a patient tried to rob him at gunpoint and he had to remind him that he was his doctor. Luckily, the man realized that it was unwise to mug his own doctor. José would later join Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) for a residency in oncology. There, he had the privilege of working with John Mendelson and Larry Norton and contributed to the preclinical and clinical work that led to the approval of cetuximab and trastuzumab, two therapeutic antibodies that have revolutionized the treatment of cancer. José would later return to Barcelona to lead the Department of Oncology at Vall d’Hebron Hospital. As part of his vision, he made it his mission to bring the hospital to the forefront of medical oncology. He encouraged physicians to participate in cutting-edge multicentric clinical trials, recruited translational scientists, mentored many oncologists, and promoted translational cancer research. All these efforts culminated in the foundation of the Vall d’Hebron Institute of Oncology (VHIO), which is now well known for its bench-to-bedside philosophy and recruits over a thousand patients a year for clinical trials. José had a very special vision for translational cancer research. It was based not on the premise that your work had to use human cell lines or samples but rather that your scientific question should be clinically relevant. This is a very important distinction because, despite his clinical background, he was a fervent believer in basic research. Under his vision it did not matter how basic or fundamental your project was as long as it could ultimately shed light on a clinical question. His common recommendations to young scientists starting such projects were to pay an almost obsessive attention to details, to be familiar with the state of the art, and to use the best experimental approach possible. This is why, in his mind, collaborating with the most relevant people in each field was almost imperative to the success of the projects. After many professional achievements and despite having secured a stable and stimulating job in his hometown, in 2010, José made the bold decision to move to Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and lead the Division of Oncology and Hematology. Although he only spent a few years at MGH, he made important contributions, started many exciting collaborations, and had many fond memories from his time there. He joined MSKCC as the physician-in-chief in 2012, in a move that he would often describe as “going back home.” During his 6 years at MSKCC, José focused on two major areas that, in his opinion, required immediate attention: streamlining the early-phase clinical development and institutionalizing the genomic testing of every single patient. These were two Herculean tasks that he would combine with his management and administrative duties, running a laboratory, and seeing patients. The clinical practice was very important to José, he would often say “I love it; I love seeing patients. It also sends an important message to the younger physicians in the hospital.” In a recent memorial for José’s life, many of his former patients shared stories about their relationship with him, a characteristic of José less known by many of us. One of his patients, the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Jorie Graham, mentioned how José showed extreme empathy by asking her how they could treat her disease by making sure that, in the process, her brain would be intact so she could continue writing her beautiful poetry. José was above all a humanistic physician who cared for his patients with all his heart. As a true believer in basic and translational research, José was always committed to raising funds for this purpose, and those who worked with him recognized his natural ability to do so. As his sister recalls, he organized his first fundraiser as a child when he and his siblings wanted to get a dog for the family. He succeeded. Throughout his career, José would continue to raise funds to help transform institutions and accelerate growth and innovation in both North America and Europe. Following his legacy, his children began a very successful campaign to raise funds for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease research, a kind gesture that would have undoubtedly made him extremely proud. After José’s death, we have had the opportunity to gather virtually with many generations of former mentees across the globe to honor his life and share our personal stories. We have reflected upon our relationships with him and realized the tremendous influence that he had on our careers despite his increasing leadership duties. We directly witnessed this at MSKCC where, as physician-in-chief, José was devoted to our growth and success. José’s agenda was relentless (meetings from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m.), and yet he would never cancel our lab or face-to-face meetings. He helped us recognize our dreams and potential even when we had doubts, and that was the greatest gift he could have given us. We will not sugarcoat the reality of working with José; he was a demanding mentor who expected our highest performance. This philosophy was not always shared by those working with him, but with time we have learned to appreciate the value of a forthright mentor invested in our professional growth. His intense personality reflected a bigger pressing issue: that every day many cancer patients die due to the lack of therapeutic options. Despite this, José was a supportive and caring mentor who led with his heart, compassion, and a clear mission. As we now begin our independent careers, we fondly remember his latest advice and guidance. José also had a charismatic personality, and he would enliven any social gathering with his stories and insightful conversations. Many of these stories about his life, which we might have heard more than once, would give you a good sense on how medicine runs in his blood. Like the time he traveled from Spain to the Amazonian rainforest by air ambulance to help a cancer patient that required immediate medical attention during a vacation. In the stories he shared, his optimism shined through as sparks of inspiration and hope for others. Immense optimism and courage also characterized José in times of uncertainty, and he always bounced back stronger than ever. Several months after his controversial departure from MSKCC, an event that was extremely difficult for him and his family, José was again full of optimism. During a Christmas dinner with all the lab members, he was deciding his next move to continue his war against cancer, and we were all eager to learn about José’s next challenge; we never expected that this would be his final one. In early January 2019, José joined AstraZeneca as the executive vice president for Research and Development Oncology, a position that gave him ample opportunity to further influence the field of oncology and bring innovative treatments to patients. Once again, José showed his unique ability to bring the best people available together by recruiting top physicians and scientists and establishing powerful collaborations, including the recent AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo deal that resulted in the approval of the next-generation HER2 antibody drug conjugate trastuzumab derxtecan. Always a step ahead, José also encouraged AstraZeneca toward the development of new therapies including epigenetic targets, an area that he saw great potential in. In an early interview with AstraZeneca, José said, “Bringing the discovery through to late-stage development chain into one unit will make the process more agile and accelerate our work to bring transformative medicines to patients. This really is a dream job.” We now remain eager to see the fruits of these early discovery projects at AstraZeneca that will likely lead to the approval of more life-saving therapies in years to come. In addition to so many formative professional accomplishments, José’s personal life was also inspiring and characterized by devotion for his wife Silvia and their four children, Marc, Clara, Alex, and Pepe. Above all, José was a loving husband and a dedicated father. Life without him will not be the same for his family, friends, and mentees who yearn for his insight on the important decisions we will face. We are all honored and fortunate to have been touched by his wisdom, passion, optimism, courage, and dedication, which will forever be a source of guidance and inspiration. Cancer researchers, clinical investigators, and patients around the world will continue to benefit from José’s contributions for decades. In the words of Sir Winston Churchill, whom José learned to admire through his interest in biographic novels, “Success is not final, failure is not fatal, it is the courage to continue that counts.” It is this virtue that José embodied, helping him live his mission in advancing treatment and care of many cancer patients. He will remain unforgettable in every way, and his incredible legacy will live on for decades to come.José Baselga Lab at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in 2014 (photo compliments of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We thank Eulàlia Baselga for suggestions."
https://openalex.org/W3174118826,"The environment is a very significant factor in early childhood development. Season of birth (SOB) is a proxy viable for the environment to which the babies are exposed, thus also significant in early development. This study investigates the association between SOB and personality. A total 2,962 college students were included as study participants. The participants were classified into four seasonal groups based on their birth month and underwent a personality assessment using the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI). Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multinomial logistic regression analysis. The male participants born in autumn scored high on the Disorderliness (NS4) subscale (β = 0.055, P = 0.042) and the male participants born in summer and winter scored high on the Extravagance (NS3) subscale (summer: β = 0.072, P = 0.01, winter: β = 0.078, P = 0.003). The difference observed indicates a relationship between the SOB and temperament, especially NS. Our findings suggest that environmental factors may affect temperament in early development, although further research is likely needed to clarify the causality between them."
